Riggs, Jr. USA(Ret)\n\nJune 1, 1916 J,Nov 5, 1998 and to Alys Pickering Jones, wife of General Alan W. Jones\n\nFeb 14 1989 - Oct 7, 1998\n\nVeteran's Day 1998\n\nWashington D.C.\n\nPresident's View\n\nTo start out the new year as president oft* Assoc., I'd like to give you a brief personal sketch so you might better understand from where I'm coming. In 1925 1 was born in Chicago to a New England couple who had already moved to the western suburbs. I grew up in La Grange, graduating from high school in June, 1943'\n\nThe fall of that year found me in the reserve section of the Army Specialized Training Program, studying engineering at the University of Wis., Madison. I was shipped to Ft Benning in Jan. 1944, for Basic Training. While at Henning the ASTP was closed down to first year engineering students so I went with Most Â°four company in March, 1944 to join the 106th at Camp Atterbury. I was assigned to 423rd/H, 3nd platoon, 81mm mortars. I was the recon driver for our platoon. In the Ardennes, for me, it was three and a half days of no sleep, damp wet clothes, cold feet, no food, and not knowing where we were. There also was constant movement, 88mm missiles landing all about, and constant burp guns, machine guns, and small arms fire. Those of you who were there can relate to that story well. I lost my long time high school friend, who was also my room mate at Madison, to the Berga slave labor camp, and the lad who slept next to me on the floor of our barracks died the day before we were liberated.\n\nAfter returning to the Stales, I was reassigned to the Engineers and spent the last months of my army career at Ft Belvoir, VA, being discharged in late Nov., 1945. I entered school almost as soon as I got out, receiving a BS from Northwestern in June, 1949. While in school I met the girl of my dreams, Virginia Margaret Baker, married in Sept 1947. We have one son and three daughters. five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Our son and daughters all live in the West so we are able to have many contacts with them. We are pleased with who they have become.\n\nBesides the 106th Association, my interests are in family, try faith in God, music, golf, airplanes, and old cars. I also like to read mysteries when I find the time. When younger I was active in village government and spent many years on the local high school board. I became chairman of a small professional college and helped steer it toward becoming a part of the Illinois Institute of Technology, being honored with a Doctorate of Engineering.\n\nMy work life has been mostly devoted to engineering sales - forty years with the same company and very enjoyable toward the end. Starting in 1968, I became pan of a group which founded hanks in the Chicago area and later purchased and developed banks in rural Illinois. We sold the holding company and our last bank in 1997. I also spent five years in the airplane business which was mostly fun - not much profit.\n\nSo tar, I've been mightily blessed in my life and look forward to a continuing wonderful experience with the Association and all it's members, this coming year and in the future.\n\nJohn A. Swett, President\n\nJohn A. Swett, President 1998-1999\n\n106th Infantry Division Association\n\n\"H\" Company, 423rd Infantry Regiment\n\n10691 E Northcrest Drive\n\nTucson, AZ 85748\n\n520-722-6016\n\n\"We Band of Brothers.... \"Chaplain, Dr' Duncan Trueman\"\n\n(From the 52nd Annual Reunion Memorial Service, Camp Atterbury Memorial Park - Saturday, 12 Sept 1998)\n\nScripture reading...Nehemiah 4: \"Remember the Lord who is awesome and great, and fight for your Brother,\"\n\nAs we gather for reunion each and every year it is a very special, almost a sacred, time for us' This year is especially meaningful as we gather in this place where once we trained, near the City of Indianapolis, whose people treated us so wonderfully when we were young. It's a very special time for us. It's a very special place for us. It has very special memories\n\nJust a few weeks ago I was weeding out old\n\nletters and documents when I came across, and\n\nread once again, an entry in a diary written during\n\nDecember 1944. The diary had besot written, and\n\nkept, by a comrade and an old friend in my Infantry\n\ncompany. His nante was Sergeant Roy Edgar. He\n\nhailed from the State of Missouri. This is an entry\n\nhe wrote shortly after the Battle of the Bulge had\n\nbegun and after he had heard a radio broadcast from London saying that the 106th had bent destroyed:\n\nThe BBC says we have been annihilated. We are not annihilated. We are still flying our colors, and we intend to hold on.. Believe you me !\"\n\nThat's a real entry in a real diary of a real friend. It was written at a time when there weren't many of us left to fight...and even less to fight with. I share it with you because it says something strong and noble and courageous and determined about the Spirit of that man...and about the spirit of all.\n\nIt's men like that sergeant that we come together to remember. There were thousands like him, Some survived the struggle and are here today. Others never came home. But that incredible spirit is one of the things we come together to remember.\n\nWhat are the things we remember? Our memories are of two kinds.. simply put, \"Places And Faces.\" Your \"Places\" may be different from mine. Some of you remember the long cold, hungry marches, shivering together in crowded boxcars. The confinement, the brutality, the indignity of POW camps. No one can truly share such memories unless he was there.\n\nOn the other hand, others may remember as I do, the long, hard, cold, unrelenting struggle to take back what had been lost.. remember not just St. Vith, but places like Stavelot, Manhay, Houffalize, and others.. fighting from town to nameless town and house to shelled-out house'. killing and being killed. All these are the places you remember and the places I remember.\n\nYour \"Faces\" may also be different front mine. In some instances our failing memories may forget names, but the faces of comrades are printed indelibly upon our minds' And those fitces are the ones we come together today to remember and to honor.\n\nYou remember Dale Carver's verse telling of \"Us as we were then and as We are now\": \"Conceived of this ordeal of fire and lcy earth, this brother-hood of old men came ill be. A kinship stronger far than that by birth was horn' when we were young across the sea. Of the ties that bind others cannot know' hut we were there, that winter long ago.\"\n\nChaplain\n\nDr. Duncan Trueman, 424/AT\n\n29 Overhill Lane, Warwick NY10990\n\n914-986-6376\n\n2\n\n\"We Band of Brothers.... \"Chaplain, Dr. Duncan Trueman\"\n\nAll this.. our \"Places,\" our \"Faces,\" our joys and our tears, our living and our dying have produced a kinship, a tie, a camaraderie to which we cling. It is, indeed, a kinship stronger far than that by birth. Nehemiah was right when we told his people: \"\n\nEvery one of us would have risked his own destruction rather than let a comrade down' Each one would have risked his own neck for every brother who wore our Lion.\n\nCamaraderie was what provided the strength and determination to hang in there.' to take all that the enemy could dish out.. to go forward under fire.. or to risk one's neck, if a buddy was in trouble' Camaraderie!\n\nOne historian wrote in late December 1944:\n\n\"Those still able to fight shook themselves and made this a defining moment in their lives. They didn't like retreating. They didn't like getting kicked around' They didn't like seeing their comrades captured. They didn't like hearing about massacres. They decided they were going to make the enemy pay.\" And pay he did\"\n\nAuthor Steven Ambrose wrote:\n\n\"The \"Bulge\" put our front-line troops (still able to fight) into one of the most God-Awful offensive's of this or any war. The battle that raged thru January was, for the G.I. 's one of the worst of the war...even more miserable than Hurtgen or Metz. It was just a straight ahead attack designed to eliminate The Bulge and return to the German Border. It was fought in conditions so terrible that they can only be marveled al, not really imagined. Only those who were there can know.\"\n\nWhat General Colin Powell once wrote about American G.I.'s has always been true:\n\n\"American soldiers love to win. They respect a leader who holds them to a high standard and pushes them to the limit, as long as they can see a worthwhile objective. American soldiers will gripe constantly about being driven to High Performance. They will swear they'd rather serve somewhere easier. But, at the end of the day they always ask: \"HOW'D WE DO?\"\n\nHow did we do? British Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery very rarely had anything good to say about American soldiers, but he said this about the 106th:\n\n\"They didn't have much to fight with. They didn't have experience. They didn't have a chance in HELL! But TIME was needed. The American soldiers ofthe 106th infantry division stuck it out. Put in a fine performance and gave us time. By Jove, they stuck it out, those chaps,\n\nHow'd we do? History has spoken' They called us \"Brave Rifles!\"\n\nWell.. these are all the things we remember.. Battles lost and Victories won... Places and Faces., and above all we remember the camaraderie that bound us together.\n\nOn January 21, 1945, General Herbert T. Perrin, then commanding our division, wrote a two-page communication addressed to all the officers of the 106th. Its contents were to be shared with all members of the division. I have a copy of it at home, still' In it he commended officers and men alike fix their perfonnance. He included praises received from the Secretary of War, from Eisenhower, from Hodges, from Ridgeway. But it was General Perrin's own statement of pride that meant the most to me.\n\nIt read this way:\n\n\"I am proud of this division and the personnel who compose it. In my service I have belonged to many organizations in which I have been proud to claim membership because of their prior deeds of valor and success. My Greatest Pride is that I can wear the Lion on my shoulder for all the world to know that I am a Brother-in-Arms of the men of the 106th Infantry Division,\"\n\nBrothers-in-arms.. .the things we remember.. .the untellable things of those days that we share.' These explain the \"Ties that Bind.'' These explain the compulsion to come together like this every year. Remember Dale Carver's \"Song for the Infantry?\"\n\n\"We're the minutemen of Concord; we set our countryfree. We are founders ofa Nation , the mighty Infantry. We served Grant at Vicksburg: for Lee we wept and died. In Blue and Grey formation we fought and marched with pride.\"\n\n3\n\n\"We Band of Brothers.... \"Chaplain, Dr. Duncan Trueman\"\n\nMemorial Ceremony' Camp Atterbury - 52nd Annual Reunion - over 600 present\n\nUr Camp Atterbury photographer, Adjutant House; Chaplain Trueman; President Kline;\n\nCol Jack Noel (Camp Commander); Col Jorg Stachel (US Ret); with 106th flag in background\n\nDuring that same civil war there was a song...a little ditty that was sung by Soldiers both Blue and Gray. It tells of the tie that binds, I do not know its tune; I only know its words.They are simple words that convey a simple thought. Perhaps the camaraderie of which they speak can only be described in terms as simple as these, Listen:\n\n\"There are bonds of all sorts in this world of ours, Fetters of friendship and ties of-flowers;\n\nA boy and a girl are bound with a kiss'\n\nBut there's never a bond, old friend like this...\n\nWE HAVE DRUNK FROM THE SAME CANTEEN.\n\n\"It was sometimes water and sometimes milk,\n\nsometimes Applejack, smooth as silk.\n\nWe shared it together amid cold and shell,\n\nAnd I think of you' friend, when I remember so well''. 4.11\n\nWE HAVE DRUNK FROM THE SAME CANTEEN.\n\nAll the faces we remember'''all the unforgettable friends God gave us..'all the Comrades we memorialize'' 'we laughed together.' 'we cried together.. .we fought together'' .we prayed together.. .we loved together' We were brothers' We drank from the same canteen.\n\nMost of us know the story of the it was fought in 1415 in Normandy between the English and the French. The English, though greatly outnumbered, won the battle that day. You may remember the words of encouragement that Shakespeare had the King speak to his soldiers before the battle began'\n\n4\n\n'We Band of Brothers.... \"Chaplain, Dr. Duncan Trueman\"\n\nBut, do you recall the words that same King spoke to his battle-weary veterans who had managed to survive the battle they had won that day ?\n\nWith tears in his eyes he thanked those outnumbered survivors who had fought so valiantly and suffered so much.\n\nThese are the words that Shakespeare gave the King in Henry V,\n\nI leave you these words because these define the ties that bind. Remember these words every time we come together.. .apply these words to everyone who wore our Lion... Think of these words as the 16th of each December passes:\n\n\"This story shall the good man tell his son, and this day shall ne 'ergo by, from now to the ending of the age. But we in it shall be remembered... We few... We very few.. .We Band of Brothers. For he who shed his blood with me today shall be my brother.\n\ncame across these following words which are not my own, and haven't been able to rediscover their author, but 1 share them with you...\n\nA Italia century has passed. A century will also pass in the blink of an eye. Who will sort out truth from falsehood ? God will knovv you I(Those are the veiy words that appear on the monument at Louvremont, aren't they?)\n\nWe look at ourselves in our mirrors each morning and say to ourselves: One day in our youth long ago, the boasting time ended. And everything you boasted about, everything you believed about yourself was put to the test.. your honor.' your Love'' your fidelity.. your faith'' your courage...\n\nIt was all put to the lest!\n\nIlow did you fare in that test long ago?\n\nYou will realize, if you have not already made that great discovery, that all those traits and truths were proven.\n\nWe made choices that only good men could make'. that only the brave and loyal could make.. choices that only those who loved one another could make.. choices that could have been dictated by courage and fitith alone.\n\nWe lived out truth.. even to the death. And truth survived even when some of us did not. And freedom survived. And decency. And your children. And my children.\n\nAnd America.\n\nHow did you fare in that test ? Look in your mirror tomorrow morning and think of those words of Shakespeare. They were written for you\n\n\"This story shall the good man tell his son-- and this day shall ne'er go by, from now to the ending of the age, but we, in it, shall be remembered...\"\n\nGod will know us and so will the history of this great country ....\n\n... We Few... We Very Few .... We Band of Brothers !\n\nDr. Duncan Trziemm, Chaplain\n\n106th Infantry Division Association 52nd Annual Reunion Memorial Service Camp Atterbury, Indiana\n\n12 September, 1998\n\n5\n\nIn Memory of Alys Pickering Jones, wife of General Jones\n\nIN MEMORY OF ALYS PICKERING JONES\n\nFirst Lady of the 106th Infantry Division\n\nBorn 14 February 1899 at Black Hawk, SD, the second child of John and Dorothy Anderson, Alys Jones was orphaned when 5 months old. A wonderful couple, Amazon Nevada and Hannah Pickering, adopted her, and soon moved to Washington State where she grew up. While attending Cheney State Normal School, she met Alan Jones. Upon graduation, they were married on 9 June 1917 in Spokane.\n\nWorld War I was disruptive, Dad volunteered and left for training. Mother taught in a one room school, first through sixth grades. She enjoyed telling that she was paid four 20 dollar gold pieces each month, only to hand her landlord two of them.\n\nAfter Dad finished officers school, Mother joined him and they were stationed on Army posts in Utah, Arkansas, Florida, Texas, and Virginia. In March 1921 they were transferred to the Philippine Islands, where I was born. Returning in August 1923, first to Missouri and then to Fort Benning, GA, Dad was to remain for six years as a student officer and instructor. It was here that their beloved daughter, Hallie, was born. Next, it was off to Oklahoma, Maryland, Virginia, Kansas, Washington State, Washington, DC, and Hawaii. This all sounds like a travel guide; but it indicates the varied life of an US Army officer between the two World Wars; and of Mother's extraordinary talent to create a warm and functioning home, at times under some difficulty.\n\nNext assigned to Washington, DC, with World War II fast approaching, they bought their first and only home on Quebec Street, where Mother was to live for the next 44 years. Quebec St became the base camp, the family center, the home-away-from-home, for children, grand children, cousins, and friends of all generations. Here, a bed, food, drink. eager conversation, and much loving care were always ready. Many Golden Lions visited, giving Mother and Dad much pleasure.\n\nAfter she broke her hip in 1985, it was necessary that she enter The Washington Home and Hospice, which she picked because it is just four blocks from Quebec St. and her neighbors, Fortunately, it is an outstanding facility with a caring staff. And here she died quietly in sleep on 7 October 1998 at the age of 99 years, 7 months, and 3 weeks.\n\nMother and Dad's deep love and respect for and interest in the men oldie 106th Division, and later their families, was ever present. Remember that the average age of his soldiers was that of his son, and so Dad later thought of them, Annual Reunions were special events to which they looked forward and which they enjoyed immensely. The proceedings of the Board were especially interesting to Dad, Proud to be an Honorary Life Member, Mother anticipated each issue of \"The Cub.\" When she could no longer read, I was instructed to start at the beginning and use some expression. Alys Jones was buried on 15 October in Arlington National Cemetery to join her adored husband, on a bright and sunny morning - so like Mother.\n\nWe miss her.\n\nBy her sea,\n\nAlan W.

Riggs, Jr. USA (Ret)\n\nRetired Col. Thomas J. Riggs dies\n\n'Hero* led battalion in Rattle of the Bulge\n\nBy MARIA MIRO JOHNSON\n\nProvidence Joumal Staff Writer\n\nPROVIDENCE -- Thomas J. Riggs, Jr., 82, a World War II battalion commander who was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge, then escaped and struck out on a desperate odyssey to rejoin his unit, died yesterday, November 5, 1998, at Rhode Island Hospital after a week in the intensive-care unit, suffering from pneumonia and heart failure.\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Riggs served as a military Colonel Thomas J. Riggs, Jr,\n\nattache in Mexico, then made a name for himself as a USA(Ret)\n\nbusiness executive in different cities across the country. CO, 81st Engineer Combat Battalion\n\nHe came to Rhode Island in 1960 as a vice president of\n\nPast President, Board member\n\nTextron Inc', a position he held until 1971. He later Order of the Golden Lion\n\nbecame president and chief executive officer of Commander Class\n\nLawson-Hemphill Inc., a manufacturer of textile 106th Infantry Division Assoc,\n\nmachinery in Central Falls.\n\nBut it was his experiences as a military officer and\n\nas a college athlete that were the highlights of his life, his family said yesterday.\n\nMr. Riggs was born in Huntington, W.Va., a son of Thomas and Beulah Riggs, He attended the U'S' Naval Academy in 1935 and 1936, and graduated from the University of Illinois in 194 I with a degree in metallurgic engineering.\n\nHe was captain of the Illinois football team and the Blue team in the 1941 Blue-Gray game, a competition between college all-stars from the country's North and South.\n\nlie joined the Army as an officer in 1942. His leadership and heroism would earn him the Silver Star, the Purple Heart and, from both Belgium and France, the Croix de Guerre. His unit, the 81st Combat Engineer Battalion of the 106th Infantry Division, was given a Presidential Unit Citation for its \"extraordinary heroism, gallantry and determination.\"\n\nA Saturday Evening Post article about the 106th Division said Mr. Riggs, a lieutenant colonel, was \"the outstanding hero of the division,\" in the eyes of his men.\n\nHe was 28 and in charge of 350 men, some of them quite \"green,\" when he was ordered to block a prime road into the Belgian town of St. Vith, which the Germans were pounding with tanks:red infantry.\n\nThough less than ideally equipped -- the six guns of his tank destroyer battalion were so new, they lacked aiming sights -- he and his men held the enemy back for five days. \"He stalked Ole line boldly,\" wrote Journal columnist John Hanlon in a 1985 retrospective, \"so his troops could see he was still there, encouraging scared soldiers to hold on.\"\n\nHanlon noted that even British Gen. Bernard Montgomery, who rarely praised Americans, admired the work of the 106th: \"By Jove, they stuck it out, those chaps.\"\n\nUltimately, though, the division was overwhelmed. A mortar fragment grazed Riggs's head, knocking him out. When he regained consciousness, German soldiers were standing over him.\n\nHe was marched to an assembly point and grouped with 40 other Americans, none from his unit, then marched for 12 days more toward Berlin. Now and then, the Germans would stop near a village to forage for food, and would throw crusts from their sandwiches to the prisoners.\n\n7\n\n1\n\nIn Honor of Col Thomas J. Riggs, Jr. USA (Ret)\n\nWorse than the indignity of being forced to grovel for food, Mr. Riggs hated being separated from his men' \"I guess that was the lowest I ever felt in my stupid life,\" he told Hanlon. \"I felt I had not done the job I was given to do, and that hurt.\"\n\nThe prisoners were taken by rail to a prison camp -- Stalag 4 --outside Berlin. Then, perhaps as punishment for revealing nothing more than his name and serial number, he was sent off alone to a camp in Poland'\n\nOn his 28th day in that camp, he went to the latrine and noticed the usual guard was not there' In that instant, he decided to escape. He walked to a deserted mess hall and climbed atop a walk-in ice chest that was about eight feet tall, and tucked himself snugly against the wall.\n\nHe heard his name being shouted at roll call, and when them was no reply; \"the search was on,\" he told Hanlon' \"Four or five times patrols came through the mess hall. One of them even had ; dogs with them, barking like hell' Each time, the guards opened the ice chest door and looked irt. But nobody checked on top'\"\n\nWhen darkness fell and no guards were near, Mr' Riggs threw himself through double barricade of barbed wire and, having heard that the Russians had taken Warsaw, tried to make his way on foot'\n\nThree nights later, resting in a culvert, he felt a tap on his shoulder and announced, \"I'm an American colonel.\"\n\n\"With that, this guy threw his arms around me and kissed me on both cheeks.\" It Was a; member of the Polish underground, who took him to a house and fed him \"potatoes and that great Polish sausage and warm milk,\" which he ate until he was sick.\n\nThe underground linked Mr' Riggs with a Russian colonel of an armored unit who said, \"Come on, Americanski, I'll have you in Berlin in a couple of weeks and you can meet your own people'\"\n\nThe colonel kept his promise, though he wound up getting there, in Hanlon's words, \"by foot, truck, tank, train, boat and airplane,\" ' via Odessa, Istanbul, Port Said and Naples. , When he finally met up with the American military and said he wanted to rejoin his unit, they told him no. But when Mr. Riggs warned that, they'd have a \"basket case on their hands,\" they relented.\n\nHis men were astonished to see him again,\n\nwhen he arrived at the 81st headquarters' A major came \"roaring out from behind the desk and we hugged. I was a little broken up, all right, and so were the others.\" They celebrated ; into the night.\n\nYesterday afternoon, Mr' Riggs's family unearthed the tissue-paper telegram he sent to â¢ his father: \"Dad. I Am free and in Allied, hands, safe and in good health.\" â¢\n\nHis family recalled his Clark Gable-asque good looks, his charm, dancing ability and athletic grace, as well as his commanding presence in a room. He was \"bigger than life,\": they said, it natural leader, and a ready volunteer when one of his clubs needed a hand.\n\nLt. Col. Thomas J Riggs, Jr.\n\n1944\n\n8\n\nin Honor of Col Thomas J. Riggs, Jr. USA (Ret)\n\nAmong the clubs he belonged to were the Hope Club, the Agawam Hunt and the U'S. Seniors Golf Association.\n\nAmong his honors: being named I-Man of the Year by his alma mater in 1989, the 50th anniversary of the year his college team beat Michigan in a big game. He was also named to the Young Presidents Organization, a national group of company presidents under 40, and was chairman of the Small Business Association's advisory council.\n\nHe was a delegate to the 1980 White House Conference on Small Business and served on the Rhode Island Governor's Small Business Advisory Council' Also in 1980, he was elected director and vice president of the Smaller Business Association of New England.\n\nHe leaves his wife, Virginia Griggs Riggs; six children, Julia Yates of Elgin, Ill', Thomas J. Riggs III of Chicago, Robin Riggs of Cambridge, Mass., Geoffrey Riggs of Los Angeles, Rory Riggs of New York City and Merry Murray Meade of Wellesley, Mass'; and two stepchildren, Barbara Powers of Providence and Dr. Hugh Barrett of Darien, Conn.; and eight grandchildren'\n\nA memorial service will be held in St. Martin Church, Orchard Avenue. Burial with full military honors will take place in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia.\n\nComments at the Arlington burial ceremony by Colonel Earle L. Valenstein, USA(Ret)\n\nB Company, 81st Engineer Combat Battalion Arlington National Cemetery\n\nArlington, Virginia\n\n10 November 1998\n\nAsa Lieutenant commanding the 3rd platoon, B Company, 81 st Engineer Combat Battalion, I served under Colonel Tom Riggs from July 1944 through the unpleasantness of the Battle of the Bulge. Then there was an interlude of nearly half a century before I saw him again in 1988 at the 106th Infantry Division reunion in Roanoke, Virginia, the first I had attended. Each year thereafter I would see him at the Division reunions spending many pleasant moments enjoying the company of the men with whom he had shared extraordinary experiences many years before.\n\nTo say that he was held in high esteem by his men only begins to express their feeling for him. He was revered in a way that can be said of few commanders for his qualifies as a disciplinarian and a leader in engineer troop training, operations, and ultimately in close combat' Affection for him, that has endured through these many years, was most evident at the reunions when the questions were repeatedly asked; \"Is Tom Riggs coming this year? Has Tom Riggs arrived?\" And there was great disappointment this past September when we learned that he could not be with us'\n\nYes, Colonel Tom Riggs was a remarkable person, and to the men of the 81 st Engineer Combat Battalion and, indeed, of all units of the 106th Infantry Division his passing means the loss of a great friend and comrade in arms.\n\nOn behalf of the Officers, the Board of Governors, and men of the 106th Infantry Division Association, Mr. Jack Sulser, Colonel Alan Jones and 1 wish to extend our deepest sympathy to you, Mrs. Riggs, and to the entire Riggs family. We and all Golden Lions, wherever they may be, share your loss with great sadness.\n\n9\n\nIn Honor of Col Thomas J. Riggs, Jr. USA (Ret)\n\nFrom Tom Riggs' Family:\n\nOn November 10, we had a wonderful burial ceremony for Dad at Arlington. He is now safely and peacefully at rest in the right place for a hero such as he' Along with about twenty-five other family members and friends, Col. Alan W. Jones, Jr., 423/HQ I Bn, Col. Earle Valen.stein , B Company, 81st Engineers (who gave a very moving speech at the burial), and Jack Sulser, 423/F, were present. Their presence was much appreciated by the family and much respected by the other attendees. On November 12, yesterday, we had a memorial service for Dad here in Providence which was attended by many friends and loved On.. Thanks for all the support and good wishes of the 106th and the 81\" Engineers. My Dad's days with you men were the proudest of his incredible life' Many times as his faniily has reflected on that life over the past week, our thoughts have turned to the 106th and the 7 days in St. Vith that forever changed the lives of everyone there - and that I believe altered the courseof world history. For those who are interested, donations may be sent in my father's name to:\n\nHospice Care of Rhode Island Foundation\n\nBox H, Annex Station, Providence, RI 02901-9979\n\nSigned by son\n\nGeoffrey Riggs\n\nA report for The CUB from Jack Sulser, 423/F\n\nSubject: Riggs Funeral\n\nTom Riggs was buried at Arlington National Cemtery yesterday with full military honors: casket on the same caisson that carried JFK's body drawn by six gleaming black Clydesdales escorted by a glistening black, riderless horse with empty boots inverted in the stirrups, an 18-piece Army band, a full platoon of riflemen with fixed bayonets; a salute firing squad, bugler, chaplain, the works' Despite a gray, rainy day, all went smoothly. (They average 23 burials a day - not all with such full honors - and the troops are very practical.) The full, extended Riggs family was there, including three grandchildren, one only 4 months old, plus a lot of family and business friends; some 40 in all.\n\nEarle Valenstein, Alan and Lynn Jones, and I represented the Association; and Earle spoke briefly and movingly during the commital. The wreath I obtained was placed by the funeral director near one end of the casket and was very visible throughout; it was the only touch of color in an otherwise dreary scene. It was composed of red, white and blue flowers and had a scarlet ribbon across it with the legend \"106th Division.\" The four of us, plus Helen, thought it looked beautiful. I took a roll of photos before and during the service. If they come out well, you will be able to see for yourselves.\n\nThe family invited everyone to a brunch at their hotel after a damp and chilly morning at the cemetery. Geoffrey Riggs, Tom and Virginia's eldest son who had made most of the, arrangements, thanked everyone for coming, especially the delegation from the 106th Association.\n\nI think you would have been pleased with our farewell to one of the Division's favorite , people. At Alan's suggestion, I asked Ginny Riggs to what charity our members who wished to make a donation in Tom's memory could send their check. She suggested the hospice where arrangements had been made for Tom to spend his fmal days (which in the end proved unnecessary).\n\n10\n\nIn Honor of Col Thomas J' Riggs, Jr. USA (Ret)\n\n(Left) Colonel Thomas J.

Riggs, Jr. USA (Ref) THE CAPARISONED HORSE\n\nThe practice of having the charge of a deceased military officer led in the funeral procession is a survival of an ancient custom of sacrificing a horse at the burial of a warrior. Generally the horse was hooded, sheathed in a cloth or armored covering and bore a saddle with the stirrups inverted and a sword through them. This further symbolized the fact that the deceased had fallen as a warrior and would ride no more\n\nDuring the period ofGenghis Khan and Tamerlane, the Mongols and Tartars believed that the spirit of a sacrificed horse went through \"the gate of the sky\" to serve its master in the after-world.\n\nAccording to European folk belief, the dead horse would find its dead master if permitted to follow him into the hereafter. Otherwise, the dead master's spirit would have to walk. When Gen. Kasimer was buried at Treves as late as 1781, his horse was killed and placed in the grave with the dead general. Some of the Plains Indians in America adopted the custom after they came into possession of horses'\n\nHorses are no longer sacrificed in such cases, but sometimes a riderless horse is still led in the funeral procession as a symbol of a fallen warrior. In about 1800, Blackbird, an Omaha chief, was buried sitting on his favorite horse.\n\nAccording to historical records, Abraham Lincoln was the first President of the United States honored by the inclusion of the caparisoned horse in his funeral cortege, When his body was taken from the White House to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda, the casket was followed by the dead president's horse with its master's boots backwards in the stirrups.\n\nIn order for the caparisoned horse to be used, the man it is honoring must have at one time been mounted, either cavalry or artillery, or have been a general or flag-rank officer'\n\nSince the president of the United States is the commander-in-chief of the armed fort., he is entitled to the use of the horse'\n\nEQUIPMENT FOR THE CAPARISONED HORSE\n\nThe equipment a caparisoned horse bears differs according to its color: if black, the horse carries saddle blanket, saddle and bridle if any other color, the horse carries a hood and cape, along with a blanket, saddle and bridle.\n\nCAPE: The cape buttons at the breast (four buttons) in front of the left legit has a crupper that fits under the horse's tail to hold the cape secure' A crupper is a padded leather strap that is passed around the base of a horse's tail and attached to the saddle or harness to keep it from moving forward. The cape is bordered with a fringe, 3 inch. in length, with a 6-inch tassel, spaced every 4 inch.. The cape hangs to the hock (the joint bending backward in the hind leg) and knees.\n\nHOOD: The hood eovers the head, going back as far as the withers (the highest part of the back of the horse)' It buttons under the jaw bone, along the neck to the breast. The hood has eye slots and extends down the edge of the mouth. It covers the ears, and the ear pieces are fringed. Its bordering is like the cape.\n\nSADDLE BLANKET: The saddle blanket extends from the withers to the flank' In width, it extends half-way down the side of the coastal region. There is a white border 1 1/2 inches in width completely 'encircling the blanket. Stars are placed on the rear comers of the blanket (four inches from the bottom) for generals, with the number of stars indicating the rank.\n\nSADDLE: A pair of spurred boots is placed backwards in the stirrups of the saddle, the tops of which are fastened to the stirrup strap' The officer's field saber and carrier is placed on the \"off side\" of the horse. The carrier is fastened to the saddle, and at the bottom there is a strap going under the horse's abdomen fastening on the \"near side 'to the cantle (the upward-curving rear part of the saddle) by straps and a D-ring, This keeps the saber vertical.\n\nBRIDLE: The bridle consists of a snaffle bit (light and jointed, attached to the bridle and having no curve) and a French halter. It is wom in the regular manner, with one rein. This rein is secured to the pommel (the rounded, upward-projecting front part) of the saddle. The horse is led from the \"near side\" with the ring hand grasping the reins, six inch. from the bit.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS: All of the caparison (the ornamented covering) is black. The hood, saddle blanket and cape are made ofwool or serge (a strong, twilled fabric with diagonal rib). All brass and leather is highly polished,\n\n13\n\nJohn Kline, 423/M, editor, The CUB\n\nPast-President 1997-98 - 106th Infantry Division Association\n\nJan 31, 1998 at Fort Indiantown Gap, Battle of the Bulge Re-enactment, the vehicle is an\n\nauthentic German Jeep, one of the many WWII vehicles displayed during the event.\n\ne-mail: jpk@mm.com Home Page: http://www.mm.com/user/jpk\n\nIt seems this whole last year I have been apologizing for producing a late CUB.

Not just because I suggested two years ago at Roanoke that we meet at Indianapolis in 1998 and utilize the professional services of Armed Forces Reunions, Inc' (AFR). Indeed, A FR and the hotel they selected proved to be great. For the first time we had no need of a host Reunion Committee, meaning that all of our members and their wives could fully enjoy the reunion.\n\nFor most of the 604 people who attended it was the first opportunity to see Indianapolis and Camp Atterbury since we left there on our fateful journey to Europe in 1944' That is probably why there was such a large number of \"first-timers\" at the reunion' Except for War Memorial Circle, which is undergoing extensive repairs, Indianapolis was unrecognizable, but the Scottish Rite Cathedral and Indianapolis Speedway were impressive to visit. Except for the old Camp Chapel, there was also little familiar about Atterbury beyond the firing ranges, which have been expanded and are now among the best in the nation - used by all military services and law enforcement agencies. Several special moments stand out in my mind.\n\nOn Saturday a lengthy article appeared on the reunion in the Indianapolis Star with excellent pictures of John Kline and John Gregory, based on a few hours a reporter and photographer had spent on Wednesday interviewing several members about their wartime experiences. On Friday, Col' Stachel, former Atterbury Commander, arranged for several members to participate in a popular radio call-in show. On my City Tour bus the guide mentioned the author Kurt Vonnegut among \"famous\" people who came from Indianapolis. He was unaware until I told him that Vonnegut was a veteran of our Division. Another famous veteran of the 106th is Charles Guggenheim, whose films have been nominated for the Academy Award eleven times and have won four \"Oscars'\" At the Men's Luncheon President Kline introduced Mack O'Quinn, who is assisting Guggenheim to produce a documentary film about the 350 POWs who were sent from Stalag IXB at Bad Orb to the slave labor concentration camp at Bergs am Elster, a branch of the infamous Buchenwald. We also met another distinguished veteran of the 106th, former Sergeant Major of the Army Bill Bainbridge. The peacetime US Army sports six 4-star generals but only one Sergeant Major of the Army, and he is one of us'\n\nSpeaking of Sergeants, Master Sergeant Coleman of the Indiana National Guard did a great job organizing our visit to Atterbury. The highlight was the Memorial Service held in front of the monument to the 106th Division dedicated in 1992' We heard the deeply moving premiere of a new choral work by one of our members, Preston Barnes, to words by our Poet Laurate, Dale Carver. Not many in the audience were aware that the recorded piano accompaniment to the hyMns we sang was performed by our talented Chaplain, Duncan Trueman, whose talk was again of the highly literary quality we first heard at Mt. Rushmore in 1994' During bag lunch after the service (how familiar was that after 54 years?) we learned we each could have a brick with our name and unit inscribed on the walk around the under-construction museum for $25.\n\nThe next morning the 52nd Annual Reunion became part of Association history. I mentioned several things that seemed especially memorable to me; others will recall different events or people To paraphrase Shakespeare's Henry V's soliloquy \"We band of brothers\" before the battle of Agincourt, quoted by Chaplain Trueman, those members who did not attend the 1998 reunion at Indianapolis \"shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here.\"\n\nThe main thing, of course, is that we get together every year to recall our mutual experience and renew friendships' See you in Schaumburg next year!\"\n\nJack Sulser\n\n21\n\n52nd Annual Reunion, 1998, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nARMED FORCES IFtEUNIONS Incorporated\n\nOctober 9, 1998\n\nMr. John Kline\n\nPast President\n\n106th Infantry Division Association\n\nDear Mr' Kline:\n\nThank you for your thoughtfulness in sending such an unbelievably nice letter of commendation' As owner of AFR it is such music to my ears to know that another wonderful job was completed by our staff. We are very lucky to have DiaimeMoore on board, and proud indeed that we have had the opportunity to assist the 106th Infantry Division Assoeiation. Dianne remarked about how she truly loved your group and how utterly nice everyone was. This is not always the case; you know, groups have personalities like individuals do' There are nasty groups and wonderfully nice groups; yours is the latter and a pleasure doing business with. Hopefully, this will be the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial relationship. Thank you for the kind words of praise that you forwarded to the other units as well.\n\nMuch of the new business we obtain is by virtue of word-of-mouth advertising. Mr. Kline, all of our groups seem to appreciate our services, but not all of the chairmen take the time to so kindly express their satisfaction' Thank you for taking your time to write, and I would certainly like to include your letter of endorsement in our sales kit, which is sent to all prospective clients. We look forward to working with your fine organization again.\n\nWith warmest regards, Ted Dey\n\nPresident\n\n52nd Annual Reunion Attendance -- State Count\n\nBelgium 2 MO 7 VT 1\n\nAL 9 MS 3 WA 2\n\nAR 2 MT 1 WI 13\n\nAZ 4 NC 4 WV 5\n\nCA 11 NE 4\n\nCO 4 NJ 16 Grand Total\n\nCT 5 NM 2\n\nDE 1 NV 1 332\n\nFL 31 NY 18\n\nGA 5 OH 17 Does not include guests or\n\nIA 3 OK 3 wives, just former Division\n\nIL 34 OR 1 members\n\nIN 14 PA 29\n\nKS 2 RI 3\n\nKY 3 SC 6\n\nLA 2 SD 1\n\nMA 6 TN 8\n\nMD 7 TX 12\n\nMI 18 UT 2\n\nMN 6 VA 4\n\n22\n\nrr\n\n(\n\n1\n\nit\n\n52nd Annual Reunion, 1998, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nRUSSELL VILLWOCK'S PAGE\n\nOrder of the Golden Lion Awards\n\nBy Russell Villwock\n\nChairman - Order of the Golden Lion\n\nThe Board of Directors, and the 106th Infantry Division Association, at the 52nd reunion in Indianapolis Indiana, presented four recipients The Order of the Golden Lion Award.

We tend to wonder how they would react, given the same set of circumstances we had in 1943-44-45' I pray to God that they not be faced with those circumstances. I'm convinced that although it seems to be a different sociaety out there these days, that our children are thinking about \"What Happened\" back then. 1 receive literally hundreds of letter on from my website, from relatives of 106th Veterans, as well as many from relatives of other World War II units, seeking information about what their fathers and grand-fathers went through in World War II. I have seen a steady increase in new ASSOCIATE members, (Associates now number 183 out of 1,630 +/- members) showing an intense interest in the history of their relatives.\n\nI am presenting here three letters from relatives of 10601 veterans, one happens to be a letter that was read to me, very much a surprise, from my son. John Swett, now our president, completely surprised me in the final banquet proceeding by reading my son's letter to the audience. His letter along with the other two I am presenting make my heart swell with pride.\n\nI am sure these will also give you some assurance that our children are thinking of us.\n\nJohn Kline, editor\n\nFrom Gay Goodwin, daughter of John Nichols, 81st Engineers, B Company--.\n\nThe movie Saving Private Ryan will most likely give many viewers a flavor of the hardships of battle, but nothing can compare to experiencing an Infantry's reunion. I had the privilege of attending the 52nd Annual Reunion of the 106th Infantry Division where the realities of warhad more of an impact on me than the movie could ever have.\n\nMy reason for attending the reunion was to accompany my father, John Nichols 8Ist/EnWB. It was to be a special time in my life to spend it with my father. I knew that I would come home with many interesting stories and with a little more knowledge of such a historical event.\n\nWhat I was not prepared for was the reception that I would receive and the many ways you all touched my heart. In addition to your memories of people and events, you shared your pride, sorrow, comraderie, a glimpse into my father's past and a lot to laugh about. Although 1 watt one of a few present at the reunion that had no direct connection to the 106th Infantry Division, you accepted me with warmth and open arms as if I had been a part of your past and present lives.\n\nWords cannot express the impact that many of you had on me' It was truly an honor to be in your presence, to meet people that my father had spoken of often and to witness the shared brotherhood that you have continued over the many years.\n\nIt has been easy to relay to others at home some of the stories that you shared with me and to show my enthusiasm for having met such a wonderful group of men and women, but only I can appreciate the way that spending four days with the Brave Rifles has changed my life.\n\nFor the impressive stories, tears, bus trips, drinks around a table, a memorial service, pride and comraderie thank you!! The reunion has meant more to me than I ever imagined.\n\nA special thank you to the men and wives of the 81st ENG/B' You not only shared with me a part of my father's past but you treated me with kindness and I now have the pleasure of knowing you. I think of you often and 1 hope that we meet again'\n\nGay Goodwin\n\n24\n\n52nd Annual Reunion, 1998, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nk.\n\nFrom Nancy Eckert, daughter of Frank Eckert, 424/F\n\n), A letter written to a local newspaper\n\nSeptember30, 1998 Mr. Dick Feagler\n\n-A The Plain Dealer\n\n1801 Superior Avenue\n\nCleveland, OH 44114\n\nDear Mr. Feagler.\n\nAs the daughter of a front-line Infantryman in the Battle of the Bulge, I'd like to comment on your excellent column titled \"American Honor.\" I received a copy of it through the internet from a WWII veterans association'\n\nAt the end of your article, you say \"Or for the men who had lived and grown old and were baffled about why they had been spared'\"\n\nI can think of more than a few reasons but I'll give you some personal ones:\n\nI remember when my Dad was near the end of his career as a shop mechanic and how he told me that all the young guys in the shop called him \"the old man.\" He indignantly told me of taking a magic marker and drawing bathing suits on the Playboy centerfolds posted on the shop walls. This, in the city of Chicago, where Playboy Enterprises began, the first city to be saturated with the new Playboy Magazine' Where Hugh Hefner had his Playboy Mansion only 1 block away from my first apartment in that city. The magazine that ended up legitimizing nudity and changing a great deal about American life to become what's considered now by many to be the \"norm\" in behavior.\n\nA man who was diligent and sensitive, who struggled to make some sense out of his short term--and the longest days of his life--as an infantryman in the Battle of the Bulge before his feet froze so badly he could barely keep up with his squad. A man who took his children along to see war movies when they were young while he struggled to understand about his role and his battle's role in that great war before the Information Age came to be.\n\nA man whom I know was totally faithful to his wife and spent time with his children all through their growing years. Who hung on when we children grew out of the charming and cute stages. I know that small children can be very healing so it must have been very difficult for him when we grew out of the adoring stage and must have accentuated for him the loneliness and sense of loss that he remembered during those battle days.\n\nLast weekend when I went to the summer market near Seattle where I live, I heard a fella mention Clinton and \"the situation.\" He referred to it as the \"Tender Trap.\" I didn't have to turn around to know that it was someone who was probably a WWII veteran, who remembered the movie about playboy Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds called \"The Tender Trap.\" But I did â and of course saw what I expected. I wanted to go back and thank him for softening the edges of this difficult life with his gentle, un-graphic words.\n\nA good and decent generation, growing up with the hardships of the Depression and serving in World War II at the most impressionable time of their lives.\n\nIf this, and only this, were the main reason they were spared, it is enough. I already feel a profound some of loss for what we as a nation are now losing as this generation passes.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNancy Eckert\n\nDaughter of Frank Eckert\n\n106th Infantry Division\n\nSurviving Veteran of the Battle of the Bulge\n\n25\n\n52nd Annual Reunion, 1998, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nFrom Dale Kline, son of John Kline, 423/M - read during the final banquet at the 52nd Annual Reunion, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nDear Veterans of the 106th:\n\nI am writing to you with the deepest of respect' I am a Navy veteran (Vietnam) 1966-70 Although my service to my country was in adifferent era in a different kind of war weal! have a lot in common. We are Americans and proud of it!\n\nLooking at our world today with open eyes I see how important it is to keep hold of our liberties. Yes, we have much to be thankful for in this nation of ours' Power struggles and Political downfalls are everywhere.\n\nI was not in this world December of 1944.1 was not born until 1947. However, during these last 51 years of my life the 106th was alive in my family' Many times my Dad would talk to me and my two brothers about his service to his country' We all were very attentive when he told us of the \"Bulge\"' It seems like during the years that followed in my life we would have times of â¢ \"reflection\" on his war years... .he needed to share these times.... I knew he wanted us to audize how fortunate we were to live and be raised in America.\n\nLater on in my life when 1 matured he shared with me the trials he faced as a prisoner a.m.. â¢ The fateful day in December 1944 up to his liberation on April 13,1945.1 used to sit there listening and imagining what it was like..., and being thankful that he made it home. I would not be here today' Many times I read his diary - The bad weather, the many miles of walking, the food shortage or no food at all.. .the sickness.. .the stress... the abuse. I could go on and on.\n\nA special place is in your hearts for your comrades who did not make it. They are alive in memory and in your hearts!. It is you and those who lost their lives for our country that ntaale it a great nation.\n\nDuring the last several years my Dad has taken a more direct and active role in this association. Helping to firm the foundation that the 106th stands for-\"Courage\"' I am proud of my Dad. I'm sorry I don't let him know it enough. I am proud of his heritage and the union helms with the 106th. I am proud to be an associate with all of you. It is with regrets that 1 can't attend the convention this year.. .to be there with my dad.... But I ant in spirit.\n\nI have had many chances to tell fellow veterans about the 106th.... about the \"Bulge\". I tell them \"My Dad.. .John Kline was in the 106th. They did their best. .and they did it with pride!\" â¢ With gratitude:\n\nDale F.

Editor)\n\nREMEMBRANCES\n\nOF A FATHER'S EXPERIENCE\n\nMy father was a T-5 (Corporal) in Troop B, 18th Cavalry Recon Squadron, 14' Cavalry Group, temporarily attached to the 106' Division in Belgium/Germany in December 1944. Following are a few memories 1 recall him telling me about his POW experiences.\n\nOn his eapture: On Dec. 16th, his unit was stationed immediately south of the village of Bleialf in Germany, just to the west of the Schnee Eifel. Along with other units they held their positions until being ordered to retreat over a hilly semi-circular 2km road to Winterscheid on the morning of the 171h. Sometime during the day, my dad and a group of six others from Troop B lost contact with Capt. Fossland and the rest of the I 8th.\n\nThey had been ordered to destroy some supplies before continuing their retreat, and took a break in a farmhouse to try to get warm. The seven of them were seated in a semi-circle facing the door when all of a sudden the front door kicked open to reveal a German soldier holding some kind of automatic weapon and shouting something, which my father interpreted loosely as \"raise your hands, you're all prisoners\", or words to that effect. My dad's best friend, Bill Partin, sitting next to him, had his M-1 with the butt between his legs on the floor and the barrel pointed above the door. He ever so slowly moved the barrel down so it was aimed at the German, but hurried the shot. As soon as he fired, the German sprayed the room with automatic weapon fire.\n\nMy father found himself on the floor, alive and unhurt, between two fellow Troopers, one being Bill Parlin, who had been stitched across their middles with bullets. Dad recalled trying to help Partin when the German soldier came over to him, stuck the barrel of his weapon in dad's face and said something like \"raus\"; dad said something like \"get outa here\" and pushed the barrel away with his hand so he could tend to Partin.\n\nHe told me that, at the time, he wasn't thinking, that he was very lucky the German\n\n31\n\nWelcome Our New members...\n\ndidn't shoot him on the spot. The German soldier moved his gun barrel to block dad's arms and said \"raus\" again; at this Dad relented and went with his captor' He remembers the time as approximately 3 p.m. He didn't know what happened to Parlin but the Trooper on his other side was dead'\n\nHe said he remembered the woman of the house going down the hill behind the house a short distance, seemingly to take some clothes from the clothesline, but Dad believed she went to find/warn German soldiers that them were American soldiers in her house and that that's how the one soldier knew they were in the farmhouse.\n\nOn his interrogation: Dad said he was taken to some sort of grand looking house where a Captain in the German Army quizzed him' He remembers standing at (G.I.) attention and saluting the officer. (When I asked him why he did that, dad said it was because he was a superior officer). The German asked him, in thickly accented English, a la Eric von Stroheim, or Otto Preminger:\n\n\"Zo, vat do you think uv your Mr. Roosevelt now?\"\n\nDad: \"Oh, he's a pretty good Joe\"'\n\nGerman: (out of his chair and pounding his fist on the desk): \"Vas ist das 'good\n\nJoe'\"?That's how my father told it to me -I'm not sure what is the actual Gennan phrase for \"what does 'good Joe' mean\"?\n\nDad: (shrugging his shoulders): \"That means he's a fine fellow, a good man, like your Hitler\". German: \"Humph\"!\n\nIn the subsequent moment of silence, dad says he pointed to a pair of wool socks on the comer of the desk and asked if he could have them; and the German said yes and handed them to him. He wore those socks in the boxcar during the cold ride to Bad Orb. Those socks helped keep his feet from getting frostbite.\n\nI ant sure this is the way my dad told me the story, although I cannot verify if this is how it actually occurred. It makes me laugh - the incongruity of this Brooklyn-born chip-on-his-shoulder G.I. talking slang to the proper, educated enemy officer and turning his taunt on its ear'\n\nOn the train trip to Bad Orb (Stalag 9B) - few recollections. Crowded, cold. Slept at night with his feet stuck in another G'I.s crotch for warmth. Christmas eve singing 'Silent Night' with a single candle in the boxcar'. Didn't remember how long the train trip to Stalag 9B lasted. Didn't remember how soon he was transferred to Stalag 9A, or how he got there.\n\nOn Ziegenhain (Stalag 9A) - Again, few specific recollections. Generally left alone by the guards' Apparently, any kind of fraternization was prohibited. Dad says the prisoners followed the progress of the allied; advance through a makeshift radio some of the; British prisoners made.\n\nDad recalled taking his helmet to the mess, building and, when the guards or other camp; staff weren't looking, dipping it into a garbage can full of potato peelings, then returning to his; bunk to sort the edible from the non-edible. He , said that was a violation of camp rules and he might have been shot if caught.\n\nHe told me the day that Patton's troops , arrived, the prisoners were aware they were coming; the guards and administration stole, away the night before so there were no guards on hand' Dad said prisoners stayed put because: , 1) of physical debilitation; 2) Atnericans were, on they way; and 3) security problem of walking around a Germany at war.Igi recollections I - I was in Europe in 19114 and located the site of Stalag 9A. Here's bow it happened:\n\nIn the morning I had driven into Bad Orb and spent an hour and a half or so touring around looking for something that might have been a POW compound 40 years before' I didn't see anything, and the two people I asked (one a policeman) didn't know, or pretended not to, or didn't understand my attempt at speaking German. While there I went over to the train station. Bad Orb is in a valley which the tracks follow until they dead-end at the Bad Orb station. I could visualize trains carrying Allied POWs stoppping here to get rid of their prisoners.\n\nA short while later I drove into Zeigenhain from the south (rte 254), first stopping at the train station in `Zeigenhain Sud' (South\n\n32\n\nWelcome Our New members...\n\nZeigenhain) to wonder if this is where POWs arrived from Bad Orb. But nothing in the vicinity looked like a fanner POW compound. drove another mile or so north to the town center, \"parking in the lot of a small museum which is 4:,: situated next to a jail or prison. Across the street I 4\n\nnow a grocery store and walked over there,\n\nWhen I mitered the store the proprietor was waiting on two txtsiomeis so I waited my lure to try to talk to him - I don't walk Guman, never studied it, only know will I've picked up from tv movies. My tint question to him was \"Sprechen sie Anglisch. \"? (I)o you spaik English?). \"Nein\" was f, his aiily'\"Sprechen sie Fnincoise\"?\n\n(Do you speak French?)' \"Nein\", again' \"Okay\", I said. \"We'll do this in English.\" Then, pointing to myself, I said, \"I want to buy ti an apple\" (while at the same time pantomiming ti biting using my hand and Mouth the action of biting into an apple)' epple\", he said happily. Mier asking me in German if I wanted one apple (\"einen\") or one kilo of apples (\"eine\"), or red ones (\"rot\") or green ones (\"gnine\"), I eventually decided on a single apple and paid him the 15 pfennigs he asked. tThen, our transaction complete, I asked t him: \"flier ist Zeigenhain?\" (Is this\n\n3 Zeigenhain?). \"Oh, ja, ja....\" he replied. And continued telling me about the town, showing me a nice foldout, 4-color brochure that described its advantages, in case 1 wanted to locate) my plant here. \"Mein pappa var heir im tier weltkreig\", I said. (My father was here in the war). No answer from him, just a nod. So I continued: \"Er vass soldat Americanische im Stalag noun\" (He was an American soldier in Stalag 9). I still don't quite believe what happened next.\n\nHe grabbed the sides of his head with both hands and said loudly and happily: \"Ach, Stalag neun\"! (Oh my goodness, Stalag nine!). \"Grade aus, grade aus\". I didn't know until later that this meant \"straight ahead\". He took hold of my left arm, shook his head from side to side, and said: \"ni links\"! And he did the same with my right arm, saying \"ni recht\"! (At the time I thought he was telling me not to tum left or right; this turned out to be correct.). He took out a pen and wrote a map on slip of paper that was on the counter: describing to me, in German, the directions he was writing for me: \"Grade aus, drei kilometre\" (straight ahead, three kilometers); \" ni links, ni recht\". Then he pointed to an intersection in the main road, one of two he had drawn: \"sveischish kreuze, links aus\" (tom left at the second intersection). He put a name at that spot, Trutzhain, followed by, in parentheses, \"Stalag 9A\". Then he hustled me out the door, saying: \"grade aus, drei kilometre, grade aus, drei lilometre, auf weidersehen\".\n\nI thought, at the time, and have continued to think since, what an amazing encounter; how lucky I was to have met this gentleman, who could have, for lots of valid personal reasons, claimed not to understand me, or not to recall anything about Stalag 9A, or not to have lived there during the war. Or might have had a relative killed by the Allies and still held bitterness. Endless possibilities, but none surfaced. Instead, he saw fit to work through my poor attempt to speak his native language and gave me the directions I sought, I believe this was meant to happen; that I was meant to know the location of this particular POW camp.\n\nI drove to the second intersection and turnout left, parking in a small area just inside the remnants of a fence. Inside the now-named Trutzhain, I saw paved roads at 90 degrees to each other; remodeled buildings, some of which might have been once-upon-a-timebarracks. I recall the store proprietor, in the midst of \"grade aus\" and all the rest of it, saying the words \"barreken and fentsen\", which I understood at the time to mean I would see remnants of barracks and fencing from the former Stalag 9A.\n\nI walked up and down several streets, criss-crossing, looking at old buildings, and at new ones. I wanted to absorb some of the memory of the human trials that took place there , oh so long ago, now. I took a few photographs as keepsakes. I spoke a prayer. It wasn't for me; it was a tribute to my father' I had returned to the site of one of his most severe privations. In making the trip, in finding Stalag 9A, I had honored his wartime service, as I did all the other G.I.s. Did I understand him a little\n\n33\n\nWelcome Our New members...\n\nbetter? Perhaps. But now I had stood in the place he once did,\n\nMy recollections H - With the help of a business associate in Belgium, 1 located Bleialf and Winterscheid in the winter of 1989.1t was a cold, gray day in December, (actually December 17th!) when we drove into Bleialf and, then after asking directions, to Winterscheid, some two kilometers away. Winterscheid, is a small village, no more than fifty homes and other buildings, including a communal diary barn. It was raining or sleeting, the exact form of the precipitation varied minute to minute. 1 walked the streets of this place, this place that had meant nightmares to my father for years afterwards. And it was about 3 p.m, on December 17th. I did not linger; that was for another time.\n\nMy wife and I vacationed in Belgium in December of 1994. And on the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, we drove to Bleialf and Wintescheid where I walked the streets again, I photographed the only house in Winterscheid that appeared to be old enough to have survived the war, All the others were newer. That old house did have a front door right into the sitting room, and there was a hill behind with a clothesline set up. That old house. The elderly woman who lived there, came out and wanted to know what we were doing (in German, of course), and she made no effort to understand my poor attempt to speak German to her. She didn't want to talk with me, she didn't want her picure taken, she didn't want a picure of her house taken; she was probably suspicious of strangers. She looked of an age to have been alive during the war. But that house, that old house'.'it could have been The farmhouse of fifty years ago, where dad tried to help Bill Parlin. And again, it was around 3 p.m.\n\nFOURNIER, DAVID J.

I had an MOS Bugler (Runner)' On 19 December 1944 1 was close to the front attacking force, almost across the clearing on the outskirts of Schonberg, when the Krauts openend up. A piece od shrapnel went into my throat where it stuck' I coughed it out' It left a big hole in my throat. We were surrendered and taken to the German aid station in Schonberg. When I got to the ais station I passed out and woke up on the operating table' A captured American was operating on me' He told me I was one lucky GI becasue he was looking right at my juglar vien' I would like to find that doctor and the medic who took care of me on the battlefield. I think there was only one. Also a friend of mine who was at the same aid station, who had both his eggs and one arm amputated' There was a big pile of arms and legs outside the operating room and by the street. I spent my POW prison time in Stags 11-B, Fallingbostel, Germany.\n\nMANNING, Ph.d., MICHAEL V.
