        "text": "I've experienced success because of this my whole life and it's likely you have to. Call it Power of Intention, Law of Attraction or whatever. Who cares? It works. When you focus, believe and move forward intentionally toward something you really want, it is as if the universe is conspiring with you. Your brain also conspires as it develops new neural pathways as you strongly envision what you want and what it will feel like when you get it. Then the brain's reticular activating system helps you see, notice, think, realize and ultimately succeed. Put forth a clear intention, believe that it is there for you and experience how it will feel when you get it. Build your new neural pathway and connect with the power of the universe. #mondaymotivation #mondayinspiration #Lifeadvice\n\nDon't spend your life trying to 'find' who you are, as if there's some fixed answer waiting for you. Life isn't a scavenger hunt for a pre-set, pre-determined, immutable identity. Instead, think of it as an opportunity to actively CREATE who you want to be. You're on a quest to craft and shape the person you aspire to become. Understanding the concept of neuroplasticity adds depth to this exploration. The brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself opens up vast possibilities for personal transformation. Neuroplasticity underscores the potential for continuous growth and development, reinforcing the idea that we have the capacity to redefine ourselves at any point in life. Passion and purpose play a pivotal role in this journey of self-creation‚Äîthey are not mere ideals but driving forces that, when harnessed, can lead to a transformative experience. Aligning your work with your core values creates a profound connection between your passion and your purpose. It's through personal growth that this alignment becomes a catalyst for making a more meaningful impact on the world. As you actively shape your identity and leverage neuroplasticity for personal development, you contribute to a bigger and more impactful narrative. The tangible outcomes of this process include not just personal growth but also increased influence and, potentially, financial success.

Considering the off-script pivots I‚Äôve made‚Äîespecially career wise in the last year, I‚Äôm doing pretty well. Still, it‚Äôs a challenge to disregard everyone else‚Äôs drums and march only to the beat of my own. We humans are biologically wired to receive external learning from birth. We come out of the womb as nearly blank slates ready for imprinting. As we grow up, we operate with a rather primitive cocktail of neurochemistry compelling us to seek acceptance of the tribe. That‚Äôs a protective, ‚Äúsafety in numbers‚Äù tactic. When we mimic our family groups or try to fit in with friends, the drumbeat of biology is doing its thing to help us survive. Thankfully, we humans also evolved to be more than the echo of others‚Äô drums. Our large prefrontal cortex empowers us with executive functioning: planning and forethought, expression of unique personality, ability to learn from mistakes, empathy. These self-leadership capabilities provide the evolutionary balance to proactively go from surviving to thriving. We have the neurobiology to ask ‚ÄúWho says?,‚Äù then find our own answers. In recent months, I consciously opted for less input. Fewer podcasts, no new books, minimal trainings and scrolling, very selective viewing. I even pulled back on my own writing and content creation to be sure I wasn‚Äôt on autopilot, just repeating myself. I sought quiet to gain clarity. I‚Äôm deeply grateful to live a life that accommodates the time and open space to ask ‚ÄúWho says?‚Äù‚Ä¶and then receive answers. If you want time and open space to get clarity, coaching can help. Reach out to me to schedule a discovery session.

WHAT DO YOU THINK? Share your thoughts in the comments ü§î Gallup studies show that \"People who use their strengths are six times as likely to be engaged in their job and three times as likely to report having an excellent quality of life.\" It is also easier to strengthen our strengths and neuroscience studies back this up... The human brain forms and strengthens neural pathways based on repetitive action. When we focus on honing our strengths, we're essentially fortifying these existing pathways, driving our performance to its peak. Strengthening these pathways involves enhancing connections that already exist, which requires less energy and effort compared to forming entirely new connections. Now let's compare this to improving our weaknesses. Weak areas represent less traversed neural pathways. The effort to enhance them, whilst admirable, requires vast amounts of time and energy. Their inherent nature means that improvement will often be slow, thus leading to less satisfying results. This does not mean we should ignore our weaknesses completely. However, an efficient strategy is focusing resources on further developing our strengths. These are the areas where we naturally excel, and strengthening them can lead to a significant leap in our overall performance and productivity. So, next time you're designing your personal development plan, remember that neuroscience supports the philosophy of playing to your strengths. #playtoyourstrengths #strengthsdevelopment #breakthrough2grow #neuroscienceinleadership #selfawareness #weaknesses #neuroplasticity\n\nWith so much information and noise around, it can feel like a relief to embrace silence sometimes. However, sometimes we worry about how others perceive our silence. ‚úñ Do they assume I lack progress? ‚úñ Do they view me as unproductive? ‚úñ Do they judge me as unambitious? Well, two things. 1) The likelihood that \"they\" are even thinking all of this about us is slim. (known as the \"spotlight effect\" in behavioral science) 2) We ourselves know what we are doing within that silence. ‚úÖ Learning. ‚úÖ Reflecting. ‚úÖ Strategizing. ‚úÖ Problem-solving. ‚ûï And more. So, to anyone who feels a desire to fill the voids of silence, I hope this acts as a reminder. That silence isn't always empty. ‚ú® It's a space filled with opportunity for growth, creativity, and self-discovery. ‚ú®"
