        "text": "Marketers: The sales decks you build should SUPPORT customer conversations, not BE the conversation. Here's what I’m talking about: ➡️ Flexible > Rigid A great customer meeting shouldn’t involve them listening to your deck slide-by-slide; it should primarily be a two-way dialogue where both you and the customer learn from each other. Not every slide in your deck will fit the conversation, and that's perfectly fine. ➡️ More Visuals > More Copy The salesperson - a real, live human - should be to deliver your message to a customer in the most impactful way. However, visuals can sometimes communicate things more effectively than words alone. This is when the deck really shines. ➡️ Company Narrative > Product Overviews I find sales decks are most often utilized early in the sales process. At this stage, customers are looking for a brief, clear story about what makes your company unique, rather than an exhaustive rundown of every product you have. Save that for another day. There’s still a whole lot more to consider when building sales decks, but by keeping these few key principles in mind, your decks will be better structured to allow for meaningful conversations with customers.\n\nAre you obsessed enough with your customers? Let's find out! Pre-sale (and post-sale), customers want: ● Confidence that the problem and solution category makes sense to consider ● Strong signals that indicate your company has the proven ideal solution for customers just like them ● Easy access to info they need to determine whether to reach out / sign up for a trial ● Experts available for helpful conversations (adapted to their needs, knowledge and situation) ● A solid plan for successful implementation and reaching key goals ● Something convincing to take back to the buyer group, to get internal buy-in ● A fair contract, and a price that makes both parties win ● The option to get varying degrees of help from implementation experts ● A smooth handover from Sales to Implementation and / or Customer Success ● Clear steps to take when they get stuck (and fast response times) ● An accurate way to measure if they are successful, and access to someone who can make sure the numbers get to what the goal was (or higher) ● Someone who can be proactive in seeing where they can improve to reach their goals (this can be feature / process / purchase related) ● Someone who can help them determine and implement their long-term roapmap successfully Delivering this requires teamwork, planning, customer-obsession and close alignment between all customer-facing teams. It requires a lifecycle communication strategy. #gotomarket #customercentric #b2b\n\nIf you don’t understand your customer, you’re going to struggle to sell. And while it seems like common sense to “think like your customer,” so many businesses don't do this well. The worst part? They truly think they understand their customer. But what they actually have is a pile of assumptions based on limited or outdated information. Here are three common errors Chief Customer Officer and sales coach Chris Duprey sees in companies he’s worked with: 1. You’ve never been through your own sales process. You should have an in-depth understanding of what this process looks like. 👉 How to solve it: You can’t understand your sales process until you go through it as a customer. Give it a try. 2. Your whole sales process is about you, not your buyer. Take a look at your website. Take a look at your marketing emails. Check out your sales presentations — everything a buyer sees in the sales process. If you’re like most companies, you’ll see a lot of “we” and “our” and “us.” But how can you put yourself in your buyer’s shoes if you talk more about your solution than the problems they’re facing? 👉 How to solve it: Watch recordings of your sales calls. The more you hear your customers, the more you’ll hear them articulate their challenges. Then you can use that to improve your website headlines, emails, etc. 3. Your sales reps talk too much. Salespeople tend to think they’re really good listeners and focused on the needs of the buyer. All too often though, we see sales pros putting themselves on stage and forcing the customer to sit there and listen. 👉 How to solve it: Start with using a tool like Gong or Chorus to quickly analyze talk time. This gives you a baseline. Then, ask your sales reps to bring their number down by 10%. The key is to continue doing these three things consistently. The work of thinking like your customer is never complete. #salesstrategy #salestips #salescoach #trainwithimpact\n\nThe Power of Process: Guiding Customers to Success In the fast-paced world of sales, it's easy to get caught up in the latest techniques and strategies promising quick wins and skyrocketing revenue. But amidst the debates over which approach reigns supreme, one fundamental truth remains: having a clear, customer-centric process is essential. But why is a sales process so critical? At its core, a well-defined process serves as a roadmap, guiding both the salesperson and the customer through a journey of discovery and understanding with the end goal of helping your customer SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM. Without a process, sales conversations can quickly become directionless, failing to uncover the customer's true needs, challenges, and goals. This lack of clarity and purpose can lead to missed opportunities, wasted time, and ultimately, a failure to demonstrate how your product or service can resolve their issues. On the other hand, a robust sales process: 1. Ensures a deep understanding of the customer's unique situation, enabling tailored solutions that address their specific problems. 2. Provides a framework for asking the right questions, actively listening, and engaging in a consultative approach that puts the customer's needs at the center. 3. Builds trust and credibility by demonstrating a genuine commitment to the customer's success, rather than just pushing for a sale. 4. Allows for a clear articulation of value and ROI, helping customers understand how your offering can solve their problems and drive their business forward. Regardless of the specific methodology—be it Sandler, Challenger, MEDDIC, or others—the key is to adapt and mold the process to help your customer SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM. It's not about rigidly adhering to a set of steps, but rather, using the process as a guiding light to navigate customer conversations with empathy, expertise, and a relentless focus on figuring out if your product/service can actually resolve their issues. #SalesProcess #CustomerCentric #ConsultativeSelling #ValueCreation #TrustedAdvisor I'd love to hear your thoughts!

And, do your pipeline's stages look something like this? Opportunity > Discovery > Demo > Proposal > Negotiation > Deal Closed/Lost. If so, keep reading. The problem with these stages are that they don't tell you anything about the customer's point of view. Instead, these traditional stages are from 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙨𝙖𝙡𝙚𝙨 𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙨' point of view. And, THAT doesn't really give you any indication of where you truly are in your 𝙘𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙧'𝙨 𝙗𝙪𝙮𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙟𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙣𝙚𝙮/𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙨. To fix this, I suggest you adopt what #TechCXO's Revenue Growth team calls The Rising Level of Customer Commitment In this framework, we measure how committed the customer is to you. And we change the stages in the CRM so that we measure customer-verifiable info such as: ✅ Has the customer committed to the next meeting with us, and is it on that customer's calendar? (That's a small, but significant commitment!) And, along the way, we trigger advancement to the next pipeline stages, based other 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙘𝙪𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙧 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙛𝙮 for us that shows increased commitment to us. Things like... ✅ when the customer shares with us that they have budget available of, say \"$100,000 that must be spent by Sep 1st in order to solve this problem.\" That's a commitment to us because we understand more about their process. ✅ A later stage might look like \"all of the decision makers have confirmed budget\" and perhaps a schedule and criteria for making a decision. ✅ One of the final stages is the \"customer has given us verbal commitment\" that they're going to choose us. ✅ And then the final commitment is \"they've signed all the documents\". When you redefine your sales process from the customer's point of view, focusing the level of customer commitment, it does an amazing thing. It tells us where we truly are as opposed to where we think we are based on OUR sales process alone. One last critical benefit of this framework. If we can no longer verify something in a particular stage, 𝘄𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 to the stage that we CAN verify. That creates incredible pipeline hygiene and insight!! #pipeline #salespipeline #forecast #forecastaccuracy #salesprocess #salesoptimization #salesmethodology #salescoaching\n\nCustomers will tell you. Are you listening? More than ever, go-to-market success requires greater detail about your customers. You need the kind of customer information that goes deeper than just demographic, psychographic, or technographic information. It requires you to know your customers strategy, goals, ambitions, and desires. The why. It requires you to understand your customer's customer. A properly executed Customer Advisory Boards (CAB) can be just the thing to help inform at a deeper level about the customer. Unfortunately, most of the time CABs are confused with customer focus groups which is a huge miss. Thank you Mike Gospe for walking us through best practices for properly leveraging customer advisory boards. So what does a well constructed CABs look like? *CABs are strategic assets, not sales meetings. The focus should be on understanding your customers' business priorities and future plans, not on pitching or selling. *Ideal CAB size is around 12 customers. For virtual meetings, 10 is optimal for dialogue and engagement. You want a group small enough for good interaction. *Be strategic in who you invite, driven by the business objectives you want the CAB to help with. It's not about who spends the most, but who can provide meaningful input on strategic direction. *Facilitation is critical for CAB meetings - approximately 80% of dialogue should come from customers sharing perspectives and responding to questions. *Connect the CAB to your annual planning process to validate assumptions and direction. Follow up with one-on-one account reviews to explore partnerships. *Document meetings thoroughly and share back internally so all teams can benefit from the customer insight, not just those in the meeting. Well-run CABs can provide you invaluable visibility into customer priorities and perceptions that can really impact strategic planning and relationships. A well executed customer advisory boards (CAB) can help clarify and inform your GTM strategy. -Good selling #customersuccess #sales #revenueoperations #marketing\n\nEver wondered how a map could be your secret sales weapon? 🌍 Customer journey mapping is changing the game for businesses seeking to understand their customers better and close deals more effectively.
