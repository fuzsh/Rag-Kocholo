        "text": "The Senate Ethics Committee has reaffirmed that members of the Senate - including the Ethics Committee - will not know the identities of witnesses in the investigation of former Senate President Stan Rosenberg.\n\nThe six members of the Ethics Committee adopted an order saying that the special investigators probing Rosenberg shall not disclose to any party the identities of witnesses, victims, or subpoena recipients as they investigate whether Rosenberg broke rules in connection with allegations that his husband tried to trade political influence for sex.\n\n\"The highest priority has been put on the maintenance of complete confidentiality of any victim or witness that comes forth to testify,\" Ethics Chairman Michael Rodrigues told WGBH.\n\nThe special investigators have not been authorized to issue subpoenas themselves.\n\nHowever, committee member Sen. William Brownsberger said the investigators will give the committee members \"a very high level characterization of the target and subject of the subpoena,\" so the committee maintains accountability over the investigation. That characterization will not include the subject name.\n\n\"But they in seeking our authorization will not disclose the identity or any identifying information of the target of the subpoena,\" Brownsberger said.\n\n\"We have not learned the identity of any single individual in this process. We have been sheltered from that from the beginning,\" Brownsberger said.\n\nSenate staffers and others with business in the State House raised concerns earlier this month after it became known that the Ethics Committee would have to sign off on any subpoenas issued to witnesses, possibly exposing Beacon Hill workers to political blowback.\n\nThe Senate had promised a completely confidential investigation, with the identities of those with information, voluntary or compelled, kept out of the investigators' final report to the committee.\n\nThe Committee's order in full:\n\nThe Special Investigator and the Senate Counsel shall maintain as confidential and shall not disclose to any party, including any member of the Senate, the identity or identifying information of any victim, witness, subpoena recipient or other person who provides information to the Special Investigator or the Senate Counsel, unless the person specifically consents to being identified, or disclosure is required by judicial process or procedure."
