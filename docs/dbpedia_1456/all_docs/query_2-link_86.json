Fulfilling God’s call in a changing world requires churches and pastors to be creative and often do more with less. That can be both exciting and exhausting. Westmont’s Gaede Institute offers two free programs that help pastors and churches step back, reconsider the big picture and be refreshed. If you’re connected to churches or pastors who might benefit, we hope you’ll be in touch.\n\nNew Frontiers is a free, yearlong program that helps pastors cultivate relationships and vision that can sustain them in their work. Through three four-day retreats in California and ongoing peer and senior mentoring, pastors connect to friends who can share the journey, gain access to rich sources of professional wisdom, and find genuine wellness and rest. New Frontiers might be especially helpful to pastors in their first seasons of ministry, but congregational-ministry professionals at every stage in their careers are welcome to apply. New Frontiers is open to current or aspiring pastors anywhere in the United States, and the program covers all expenses, including travel.\n\nThe Westmont Center for Thriving Communities convenes groups of Christian congregations on the Central Coast for new conversations about ministry, exploring how churches can respond to their changing contexts, discover their deeply held values and grow in the midst of conflict. Participating teams gather on Westmont’s campus for three daylong discussions throughout the academic year, drawing inspiration and support from diverse area churches. We also offer participating congregations small seed grants and coaching to help them begin new experiments in ministry.\n\nGenerous funding from the Lilly Endowment enables Westmont to offer both New Frontiers and Thriving Communities completely free of cost. We're grateful for their partnership, and for yours, in extending the resources of the college to churches.
