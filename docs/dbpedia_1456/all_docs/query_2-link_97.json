        "text": "Welcome to Boston Spirit’s list of the 25 most Powerful Players in the New England LGBT community.\n\nHow did we choose them?\n\nSome names were no brainers—Mary Bonauto, Maura Healey, David Cicilline, Stan Rosenberg.\n\nAnd then there were others, like, for instance, Mason Dunn, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition. Should he be on it? Perhaps, but he hasn’t been around long enough for us to know, especially with other notable names.\n\nIf we had an honorable mentions list, he’d be on it with a number of others like: Marianne Duddy-Burke, Executive Director of Dignity National; Grace Sterling Stowell, Executive Director of BAGLY; Kevin Dumas, Mayor of Attleboro; Paul Daigneault, Executive Director of SpeakEasy, who has produced top-tier theater in New England that addresses LGBT issues for years; Sylvain Bruni of Boston Pride; and more.\n\nThere will be those who disagree with the final names and will have good reasons. We welcome the dialogue. (And, FYI, you’ll notice they are in alphabetical order with no internal ranking.)\n\nIn the end, it is less important who is on the list than that the list generate constructive conversations in our community about where power resides and how it is used.\n\nSo, here’s our take on LGBTs of power in New England.\n\nDiscuss!\n\nPhotos from the Boston Spirit Top 25 Power Players Gala are viewable here.\n\nRonald Ansin, John Basile, Allison Bechdel, Mary Bonauto, Dr. Stephen Boswell, Ray Buckley, Steve Buckley, Elyse Cherry, Wendell Chestnut, David Cicilline, Jay Crutchley, Catherine D’Amato, Tiffani Faison, Esmond Harmsworth, Chris Harris, Maura Healey, Joanne Herman, Barabara Lenk, Matthew V.P. McTygue, Irene Monroe, Alex Morse, Sue O’Connell, Bryan Rafanelli, Stan Rosenberg, Pedro Segarra"
