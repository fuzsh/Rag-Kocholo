        "text": "Attorneys for former Senate President Stan Rosenberg and his estranged husband Bryon Hefner will argue in court today that the identity of an unnamed accuser should be revealed.\n\nLawyers for the two had argued in a filing in Suffolk Superior Court that the alleged victim's request to remain anonymous shouldn't outweigh the court's standard of having parties in a lawsuit reveal their names.\n\nThe civil lawsuit filed last month alleges the former Democratic Senate president knew Hefner posed a risk to individuals at the Massachusetts Statehouse and Rosenberg and Hefner had an agreement or understanding allowing Hefner access to those individuals.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of an unnamed plaintiff--referred to as \"John Doe\" in the lawsuit--who said Hefner grabbed his genitals without consent on more than one occasion.\n\nVictims rights advocates have said this is an intimidation tactic but an attorney for Hefner says the alleged victim already shared his name with two Boston Globe reporters.\n\nRosenberg resigned in May.\n\nWednesday's hearing gets underway at 2 p.m."
