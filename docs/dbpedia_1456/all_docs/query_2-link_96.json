Brilliant! And you brought it full circle back to the field, together. Amazing you could do so much in such a short time.\n\nBows. You served The Dharma with love.”\n\n“In working with Shalini on articles for Mindful.org, I’m immensely grateful to collaborate with someone who not only practices mindfulness but lives it, with grace, humility, and a rare ability to discern what’s happening within taxing situations. Whether face-to-face or in writing, she presents mindfulness teachings with a genuine clarity and compassion, encouraging all of us—new to mindfulness, or seasoned meditator—to bring this practice ‘off the cushion’ and into our daily conversations, our jobs, our communities. Not just that, she offers a multitude of ways to live mindfully that are immensely energizing and hopeful. If you have a chance to work with her, I wholeheartedly recommend doing so.”"
