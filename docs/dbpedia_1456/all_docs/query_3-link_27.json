        "text": "Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg, who was thrust into a sexual assault scandal after four men levied shocking allegations against his husband, has vowed to crack down on misconduct on Beacon Hill and has fielded questions on the effort in recent days. Here’s what he has had to say:\n\n• “We have a zero-tolerance policy, it’s been this way for more than a decade and the system works, people know they can step forward.”\n\n• “I’ve asked Senate counsel in the roughly four weeks since the first article appeared relating to (sexual misconduct) in the State House, ‘have any additional people come forward?’ and the answer is, ‘no.’ ”\n\n• “We went through a complete review 3 years ago when I took this position and we used outside counsel. We have state-of-the-art policies, procedures and protocols in place and they’ve worked. … We have only two reports during my three years and both of them were resolved to the satisfaction of the reporter, the person who reported the harassment. We were on it early and it’s working.”\n\n• “I don’t know any cases outside of what we’ve dealt with in the Senate, and I can tell you that we had two cases within the three years that I’ve been Senate president. And the first case was investigated, I think, within a week, the determination was made that the case was substantiated and the individual was out of the Senate; the person that behaved inappropriately was out of the Senate as quickly as possible.”\n\n• “I can tell you in the state system it’s a very complicated situation because when a person is elected by the public, it’s basically the public who can remove them in the next election. An individual, if they were found to have done something inappropriate, they would have to do the right thing on their own. … We can censure them, we can reprimand them, we can take away their chairmanship, but we can’t take away their seat in the state system based upon my understanding of how things work.”\n\n• “If you’ve looked at various ethics situations over the years that’s how it played out, eventually the individuals themselves had to resign, either during a period of time when they were being prosecuted for a crime or during a trial. … But public pressure can remove them, the attitude of the members of the body around them can create pressure, and that has happened in the past because I’ve been there when it’s happened.”"
