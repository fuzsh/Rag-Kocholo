Without such guarantees, many victims’ advocates said, it would be impossible to have a complete […]\n\nThe Codcast: The Senate’s surprise (acting) president\n\nHarriette Chandler never had designs on the Massachusetts Senate’s top post, and she readily admits to mixed feelings about landing there. Her unexpected ascension was the result of the scandal swirling around her close ally, Stan Rosenberg, who temporarily relinquished the Senate president’s job last month while an investigation is underway. Congratulated on her new […]\n\nChandler elected acting Senate president\n\nSTATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE THE SENATE INITIATED an Ethics Committee investigation on Monday night into its now former president Sen.
