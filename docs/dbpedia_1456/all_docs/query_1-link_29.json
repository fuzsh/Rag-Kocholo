        "text": "Read a statement from the Massachusetts Senate on the resignation of Stanley Rosenberg.\n\nWe accept and endorse the findings of the special investigator and thank the victims and witnesses who came forward, to push us to become a better institution. We will continue to work to earn and honor your trust. We thank the Special Investigators and the Ethics Committee for the care they took both to protect witness’ anonymity and to make the report, in its entirety, public.\n\nWe accept Senator Rosenberg’s resignation because we agree with the decision that it is no longer appropriate for him to serve in the Senate.\n\nAs members of this body, we want to say to victims, staff, and all whose lives were affected: We are sorry for what you have been through. You deserved better. We must do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe pledge to you to work diligently and swiftly to fortify the Senate’s systems for preventing and intervening in harassment in all its forms. Staff and all those who walk through the State House doors must be able to work in confidence that these policies are lived values, and not mere pieces of paper.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
