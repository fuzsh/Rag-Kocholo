        "text": "Lawyers for former Senate President Stan Rosenberg will ask a judge Wednesday to force the man accusing his husband of sexual assault to identify himself publicly.\n\nA former legislative aide listed only as John Doe in court filings has accused Bryon Hefner of sexually assaulting him at least three times. He says that Rosenberg was aware of Hefner's inappropriate behavior and was present for one of the assaults.\n\nThough the lawyers for Hefner and Rosenberg know the man's identity, according to his lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, they want the man to come forward publically. Michael Pineault, a lawyer for Rosenberg, argues there is little precedent for adult victims of sexual assault to remain anonymous throughout the litigation.\n\n\"[He] fails to advance any grounds sufficient to justify permitting him to continue to level highly public, incendiary, and destructive allegations against Mr. Rosenberg from behind 'a cloak of anonymity'\" Pineault wrote in the filing.\n\nWhen the man filed his civil suit Judge Debra Squires-Lee immediately impounded his identification. The case has since been reassigned, though Squires-Lee has not commented on why."
