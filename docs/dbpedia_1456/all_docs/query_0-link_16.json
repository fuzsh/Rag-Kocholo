        "text": "Disgraced former state Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg will resign his Senate seat tomorrow afternoon on the heels of a damning Senate Ethics Committee that slammed his “significant failure of judgment and leadership” involving his indicted husband's allegedly abusive behavior.\n\nThe Amherst Democrat, who was urged to resign by both Gov. Charlie Baker and Attorney General Maura Healey, will step down at 5 p.m. tomorrow, according to chief of staff Natasha Perez.\n\n— Read: Rosenberg resignation letter\n\nIn a resignation letter filed with the Senate Clerk today, Rosenberg said, \"In light…of the disciplinary measure recommended by the Ethics Committee, it would not be fair to my constituents to have a representative in the Senate who lacked the authority to represent their interests fully.\"\n\nGov. Charlie Baker said “Like many people, I found the report by the Senate Ethics Committee to be incredibly disturbing, and I called on the former Senate president to step down, and I’m glad that he did. I think he made the right decision.”\n\nSenate President Harriette Chandler read a statement before the Senate today. “We accept Sen. Rosenberg’s resignation because we agree with the decision that it is no longer appropriate for him to serve in the Senate,\" she said.\n\n“As members of this body, we want to say to victim’s, staff and all whose lives were affected: We are sorry for what you have been through. You deserved better. We must do better.\"\n\nThe Senate Ethics Commission report, released yesterday, focused on Rosenberg’s decision to share his Senate computer password with his husband, Bryon Hefner, who used it to send emails and allegedly used his relationship to try to manipulate people. The report only recommended that Rosenberg be barred from the presidency and committee leadership posts for two years. Senators were expected to meet today to discuss what action to take.\n\nRosenberg argued in his resignation that, \"In its report, (special investigator, Hogan Lovells, LLP) found no conduct by me that violated Senate Rules or state ethics law, no evidence that Bryon influenced my actions as Senate President, and no knowledge on my part of any alleged sexual advances, assaults, or attempts by Bryon to influence other senators or staff.\"\n\nHefner has been indicted on multiple counts of indecent assault and battery, open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, and dissemination of a visual image of a nude or partially nude person.\n\n“It’s clear to me that Stan Rosenberg cannot continue to serve in the Senate,” Healey said in a statement yesterday. “I think it’s best if he steps down immediately.”\n\nBaker said yesterday that the report “reveals a deeply disturbing pattern of behavior, making it clear that Sen. Rosenberg has compromised the business of the Chamber and trust of his constituents.\n\nWhether or not Rosenberg should be censured, is a decision the Senate itself needs to make, Baker said. \"I think that’s up to the Senate to decide…The reason I called for his resignation was because I was concerned about the fact that he had said for quite a while that the firewall that existed between his personal and professional life was real, and it was pretty clear based on that report that it wasn’t and there were plenty of opportunities for him to have done something about it.”\n\nAmong the abusive communications detailed in the Senate Ethics Committee’s report are:\n\n• Text messages Bryon Hefner sent in May 2015 to his husband, then-Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg, stating that he had sent a sexually explicit video of himself to a third party and calling on the staffer to “deal with” the problem. Hefner threatened to “destroy” and “break” the staffer and texted “(expletive) all of u” to Rosenberg and the staffer.\n\n• Graphic sexual comments and disparaging remarks Hefner made about other senators in text messages to Rosenberg, including one in May 2016, in which he said, “I want to roofie (a senator) and make a sex tape.”\n\n• A text to two staffers on July 4, 2016, apparently by Hefner on Rosenberg’s cellphone, stating, “you’re all still failures for your lack of foresight. … Sometimes the best person for the job is a straight white man. … Or a whole office full.”\n\n• Remarks Hefner made on June 20, 2017, to another senator’s staffer, suggesting that senator would be elevated to a leadership position if that senator “kept being a good (senator).” The staffer interpreted Hefner’s remark to mean the senator needed to continue to align with Rosenberg’s positions.\n\n• A text last fall to another senator’s staffer saying that senator had “lost all respect from my guy … literally he’s done (with the senator) … it’s bad … bad … he wants (the senator) out.”\n\nThe Ethics Committee report unanimously adopted the findings of a special investigator, Hogan Lovells, LLP, which concluded that Rosenberg had not broken any Senate rules, but had violated Senate policy by sharing his password with his husband.\n\nRosenberg allowed Hefner “largely unfettered access to Senate information, both through direct access to his email account and through their personal communications about Senate business,” a clear breach of the “firewall” Rosenberg had promised in December 2014 between his private life with his husband and the Senate’s business, said Sen. Michael Rodrigues (D-Westport), the committee’s chairman.\n\nRosenberg also undermined the Senate’s anti-harassment policy, Rodrigues said, “because he knew or should have known that Bryon Hefner had racially and sexually harassed Senate employees and failed to address the issue adequately.”\n\nRosenberg revoked his husband’s access only after his staff found that Hefner surreptitiously sent an unauthorized email in February 2017 to another elected official, as if the email had been sent by the Senate president himself, the report said.\n\n“Essentially, Sen. Rosenberg failed to protect the Senate from his husband, who he knew was disruptive, volatile and abusive,” Rodrigues said."
