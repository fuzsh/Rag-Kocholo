        "text": "A court hearing is scheduled Wednesday on a motion to keep private the name of one of the alleged sexual assault victims of the husband of the former state senate president.\n\nBryon Hefner says he wants the person accusing him identified and face the same public scrutiny he is facing.\n\nThe plaintiff's attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, says he wants to protect his client's privacy.\n\n\"My client has shown an enormous amount of courage by coming forward reporting the abuse,\" Garabedian said. \"And he would like to keep his identity confidential for personal reasons.\"\n\nThe lawsuit filed last month also claims former senate president Stan Rosenberg knew his husband posed a risk to people at the statehouse.\n\nRosenberg and Hefner have not publicly commented on the suit."
