        "text": "BOSTON (WBZ-AM) -- Former Massachusetts Senate president Stanley C. Rosenberg, will resign as member of the senate Friday.\n\nThe State House News Service reports that Rosenberg will resign, effective at 5p.m. Friday. The decision comes after numerous of his colleagues called for Rosenberg to resign, State House News reports.\n\nIn the hours after state senators digested the uncomfortable report that concluded former Senate President Stan Rosenberg violated the trust of the senate, more of his colleagues have called on him to resign, State House News reporter Matt Murphy told WBZ NewsRadio 1030.\n\n\"I think after they all went home, we started to see momentum build behind an effort to maybe convince Stan Rosenberg to resign,\" Murphy said. \"Whether or not he does that today, or his colleagues discipline him in another fashion, we're kind of waiting to see.\"\n\nCommentary On The Ethics Report From Jon Keller:\n\n\"It's sad...this is a real human tragedy. Stan Rosenberg is a lifelong servant well regarded even by his political adversaries, rose to the Senate president where he also earned accolades for the way he handed the job in short order in both his personal life and professional life have been destroyed by such sadness is definitely an operative term here\" Keller said.\n\nListen to Keller's full analysis on Rosenberg's resignation\n\nRosenberg's estranged husband, Bryon Hefner, was indicted on felony sex charges by a statewide grand jury in connection with sexual assault, criminal lewdness and distributing nude photos without consent.\n\nHefner, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.\n\nRosenberg stepped aside from his position five months ago.\n\nThe State Ethics Committee released a report concluding Rosenberg should not be Senate President again because, though he didn't violate specific rules, he was found to have demonstrated a significant failure of judgement and leadership.\n\nFollowing the report, Gov. Baker and Attorney General Maura Healey both called on Rosenberg to resign.\n\n\"He made a series of representations to the public and to his membership that turned out to be false,\" Gov. Baker said Thursday morning. \"It was pretty clear he had knowledge that they were false. He needs to step down, and that's really the best way for this to be handled at this point.\"\n\nSenators will meet behind closed doors Thursday to discuss what to do.\n\nPolitico's Lauren Dezenski told WBZ NewsRadio 1030 that, since there was no finding of criminal wrongdoing, expulsion is not an option--and she said it looks like, for now, Rosenberg will run for re-election.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it seems like Rosenberg wants to leave the decision of what happens next up to the voters of his district,\" Dezenski said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Marianne Marsh tells WBZ NewsRadio1030 that there was no way for Rosenberg to survive the pressure among the political ranks.\n\nListen to Marianne Marsh full analysis on Rosenberg's resignation\n\n\"There was an overwhelming turn against Rosenberg that he needed to leave. If he did not they could have voted to expel him and if they were going to expell him from the Senate he would have been locked out of his pension,\" Marsh said.\n\nWBZ NewsRadio 1030's Carl Stevens reports"
