        "text": "After a bill that protects transgender people from discrimination in public accommodations was passed by the Massachusetts House of Representatives on Wednesday, Attorney General Maura Healey lauded the state as a leader.\n\n“We have a proud history in Massachusetts of paving the way on issues of civil rights and equality,” she said in a statement.\n\nYet in the case of public accommodations protections for gender identity, Massachusetts is firmly following other states’ roads.\n\nMassachusetts would become the 19th state with such protections should the bill become law, according to surveys of the country’s public accommodations laws.\n\nIn the map above, created by the Movement Advancement Project, a group that researches and promotes equality for LGBT community, states with laws protecting gender identity in public accommodations are highlighted in dark green.\n\nAs of now, Massachusetts stands along with New Hampshire and Wisconsin in light green, which means they have laws protecting sexual identity in public accommodations, but not gender identity.\n\nThree states in the South—Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina—have yellow caution signs on the map. That signifies that their state legislatures passed laws banning localities from protecting gender identity in public accommodations.\n\nThe state Senate passed a similar transgender protection bill, and Senate President Stan Rosenberg has said he is open to the House version of the bill. Gov. Charlie Baker said on Tuesday that he supports the House version of the bill and would sign it into law.\n\nShould that happen, Massachusetts would move into the dark green on the map. That would make it join its neighboring crowd of states, but it certainly wouldn’t be leading the way."
