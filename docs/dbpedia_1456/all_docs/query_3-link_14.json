        "text": "A Superior Court judge has agreed to extend for several weeks an order to keep private the name of a man suing former Senate president Stanley C. Rosenberg and his husband, Bryon Hefner, amid allegations Hefner sexually assaulted him on at least three separate occasions.\n\nAttorneys in the civil lawsuit are slated to return to court July 11, according to Mitchell Garabedian, who is representing the then-State House aide, identified as John Doe, suing both Rosenberg and Hefner.\n\nA hearing scheduled for Wednesday to determine whether to continue to keep the man's identity sealed from public view was continued until that date. The order was extended until then as well, Garabedian said.\n\nThe man filed the lawsuit last week, alleging that Rosenberg, 68, \"knew or was aware\" that Hefner, 31, posed a risk to others, yet continually allowed him access to State House staff, lobbyists, and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two \"made an agreement or had a common design or understanding to give defendant Hefner access to individuals . . . with whom defendant Hefner could engage in unwanted sexual touching,\" the 16-page complaint charges.\n\nHefner pleaded not guilty in April to five counts of sexual assault, four counts of distributing nude images without consent, and one count of criminal lewdness. Rosenberg has said he didn't have any knowledge of allegations of sexual assault against Hefner before they were made public.\n\nProsecutors allege Hefner engaged in a pattern of assault and misconduct over multiple years. They detailed the alleged acts in vivid terms — saying Hefner groped two men against their will, kissed another \"aggressively on the lips without his consent,\" and boastfully showed nude photos of a fourth man who said he had never agreed to have the pictures taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the fourth victim was an elected official.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email\n\nReach Matt Stout at matt.stout@globe.com.
