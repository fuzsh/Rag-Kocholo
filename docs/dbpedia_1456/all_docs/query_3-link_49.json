        "text": "By Katie Lannan\n\nState House News Service\n\nBOSTON — A longtime elder affairs advocate says he is the subject of emails sent by former Senate President Stan Rosenberg’s husband Bryon Hefner, and is asking the Senate Ethics Committee to make those messages public.\n\nAl Norman, who in December stepped down as executive director of Mass Home Care after 31 years with the organization, wrote to members of the committee on April 3, saying he recently learned about the emails and wanted any that reference him by name to be shared with him.\n\n“I’ve just asked the Senate Ethics Committee to make those emails public so that people like me know what was going on behind the scenes that we had no knowledge of,” Norman told the News Service. “Obviously if there was a firewall that existed between the president and his then spouse, that firewall must have burned down and I was harmed by it.”\n\nThe committee in December launched an investigation into Rosenberg’s conduct in connection with allegations that Hefner had sexually assaulted men with business on Beacon Hill and interfered with Senate business.\n\nThe panel has remained tight-lipped about the probe. Asked about the investigation after Hefner was indicted March 29, committee Chairman Sen. Michael Rodrigues would only say it was “active and progressing.”\n\nIn December, when the committee brought on a team of attorneys from the firm Hogan Lovells to serve as special investigator, Rodrigues’ office issued a statement saying the committee “does not anticipate issuing any further public statements until the special investigator completes the investigation and submits a report to the Committee,” and reiterated its intention to release the eventual report.\n\nThe committee has said the investigation is structured so that the senators will not learn the identity of witnesses, potential witnesses and others who provide information to the special investigator, unless the person consents to be identified or the disclosure is required by a court.\n\nThrough a spokeswoman Thursday, Rodrigues declined to comment on Norman’s request or the existence of any emails about him.\n\nRosenberg, who stepped down from the presidency after the launch of the probe and has repeatedly denied that Hefner had any influence over his actions as Senate president, declined to comment through an aide, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nOn Feb. 4, the Boston Globe reported more details of Hefner’s alleged involvement with Senate matters, writing that he had access to Rosenberg’s official email account, lobbied on a budget earmark and “urged a staffer to have a senator cut ties with a lobbyist who had fallen out of favor with Rosenberg.”\n\nNorman, who was sharply critical of a wide-ranging health care bill the Senate passed in November, said a lawmaker later told him he was the lobbyist in the email the Globe story referred to, and a journalist also told him he was the subject of that email. He declined to identify either person.\n\nHe said he does not know when the email was sent or how many others might have referenced him, but worries they were damaging to his lobbying work and would like to be able to respond to any claims made about him.\n\n“It was someone trying to damage my work without my knowledge, and I’m sure that kind of thing happens all the time, but this kind of thing ended up being investigated,” Norman said. “I think what happened was unethical, for a spouse to be sending emails to lawmakers, supposedly a spouse who had no access to Senate workings, sending emails about my work with the Senate.”\n\nNorman said he would support the committee releasing other emails sent by Hefner, but only asked for those specifically dealing with him.\n\n“I didn’t insist on it in my letter,” he said. “I wanted to restrict myself to emails that I was the subject matter. I think in general, all these emails should be made public so anyone who was the subject of these inappropriate emails should know it.”"
