RICHARD NEUTRA (1892-1970)

Neutra was born in Vienna, Austria, into a wealthy Jewish family. He attended the Sophiengymnasium in Vienna until 1910, then he studied under Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner at the Vienna University of Technology from 1910 to 1918. In 1912 he undertook a study trip to Italy and the Balkans with Ernst Freud (son of Sigmund Freud). Neutra studied at the University of Zurich and worked briefly for landscape architect Gustav Amman. In 1921 he worked as City Architect in the Planning Department of Luckenwalde in Germany. He also worked briefly for architect Erich Mendelsohn in Berlin. In 1922, Neutra married Dione Niedermann and they moved to the US in 1923. At the funeral of Louis Sullivan, Neutra met Frank Lloyd Wright, who hired him in 1924 to work at Taliesin in Wisconsin while Wright was in Japan. Work ran out in 1925 and Neutra left Taliesin to work in California with Rudolf Schindler. Among many projects, Schindler and Neutra collaborated on an entry for the 1927 League of Nations Competition; in the same year they formed a design firm with planner Carol Aronovici called the Architectural Group for Industry and Commerce (AGIC). Neutra and Schindler and their wives were very close; they shared space in Schindler's house on Kings Road in Los Angeles from February 1925 until the Neutras left to tour Europe in May 1930.

The breakup of Neutra and Schindler is often accorded to Neutra "stealing" client Phillip Lovell for the Lovell Health House. According to Neutra's son Raymond, it was not that simple. Schindler was busy with projects like the Wolff House on Catalina Island and the unbuilt Transparent House for Aline Barnsdall. Phillip Lovell was grumpy about an earlier 1924 Schindler cabin that collapsed in the snow during its first winter. Schindler was also having an affair with Harriet Freeman, Lovell's sister-in-law (who Lovell intensely disliked) and Lovell didn't want the architect of his Health house under her influence. Schindler was just as happy not to put up with Lovell, and the project shifted to Neutra. The hostility began in late 1930 when Schindler heard from friends that Neutra was not crediting him about the League of Nations project. It got worse when Schindler was rejected from the Philip Johnson's MOMA International Style exhibition in New York which Neutra brought to LA for the 1932 Olympics. Neutra and Schindler ended their partnership and co-residency and rarely interacted after that. When Neutra had a heart attack in 1953, he found himself in the same hospital room as Schindler. They made peace before Schindler died there of cancer. The hostility was mostly on Schindler's side and Neutra was happy to have the reconciliation.

Novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand based character Howard Roark in The Fountainhead partially on Neutra. She was the second owner of Neutra's Von Sternberg House. Between 1927 and 1969, Neutra designed more than 300 houses in California and elsewhere. In 1949, TIME Magazine featured Neutra on its cover and ranked him second only to Frank Lloyd Wright in American architecture. After that, Neutra had all the work he could ever want. Neutra hired many young architects who went on to independent success including Gregory Ain, Harwell Hamilton Harris, and Raphael Soriano.

Architect Robert Evans Alexander joined Neutra and the firm became Neutra and Alexander starting in 1949. They agreed that Neutra would still design residential commissions on his own while larger commercial and institutional commissions would be handled as Neutra and Alexander. Alexander was actively involved in many multi-housing projects but only two single-family houses during that period: the Hall House and the Governor's house on Guam. They broke up in 1959 over disagreements on large-scale jobs.

Neutra visited the NC State School of Design as a guest lecturer twice, the first time in 1950 and again on December 13, 1957. He led the class in writing a letter to Frank Lloyd Wright: "Certainly today all serious architectural students are aware of your tremendous contribution to both the fiber and spirit of the art, and almost all are in sympathy with the means you have used in giving your ideas form, even though our own incipient philosophies and forms may be directed in many different ways. With these thoughts in mind, we would like to join with Mr. Neutra in sending you heartfelt greetings at this Christmas season. With respectful wishes — [Signed by fourteen students.]"

In 1965, Neutra formally partnered with his son Dion Neutra as Richard and Dion Neutra and Associates. In 1966, he moved back to Vienna and died in Wuppertal, Germany in 1970 while in the middle of an argument with a client, according to grandson Justin, who later made a short film about Neutra. In 1977 Neutra was awarded the AIA Gold Medal. The font Neutraface, designed by Christian Schwartz for House Industries, was based on Neutra's architecture and design principles.

1927 - The Joseph H. Miller Apartments, aka the Jardinette Apartments, aka the Marathon Apartments, 5128 Marathon Street, Los Angeles CA. Neutra's first commission in the United States and has been hailed as "one of the first Modernist buildings in America" as well as "America's first multi-family International style building." Originally supposed to a joint project with Rudolf Schindler, called the Jardin Apartments. The units were to be sited at Van Ness and Harold Way in Hollywood, but Miller ran out of funds and left town. The contractor took ownership and finished the job. At the time of construction, it was the most unusual apartment complex in LA. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (No. 390) in 1988. Sold to Clippinger Properties. Renovated in 2017. Second photo by Andrea Minton; bottom photo by Michael Locke.

In 1940, the Buffs hired architects Hunter and Reichardt to add a four room apartment and a new studio to the property. The apartment was intended to be used a rental however architect Conrad Buff III and his wife Libby were the first to occupy the apartment in 1947. The apartment later became an office for the Buff & Hensman firm. Sold in 1980 to Allan Kaprow and Vaughn Rachel. Sold in 1996 to Charles and Cynthia Cobb. Color photos by Michael Locke.

It was the first US steel-framed house built in the International style and early example of the use of gunite (sprayed-on concrete). Neutra's client, who was a fitness expert, wanted the house to symbolize physical well-being. It lit Neutra's career. Harwell Hamilton Harris was the project architect. Once the house was built, Neutra conducted tours which attracted more than 15,000 visitors. Included in the 1932 NY Museum of Modern Art exhibit. Sold to Edith Blan. Sold in the late 1940s to Leo and Sonia Goldberg. Sold around 1960 to Morton and Betty Topper. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Deeded in 1973 to Betty Topper. The house appeared in the film LA Confidential. Betty Topper lived in the house with son Ken until her death in summer 2019. Josh Gorrell became the resident caretaker in early 2019.

Black and white photos are pre-fire provided by Raymond Neutra; color photos are post-fire and include the garden wing and the Richard and Dion Neutra VDL II wing.

In 1990 Neutra's wife Dione left the house to California Poly Pomona College of Environmental Design. In 1999 it was named one of the World Monument Fund's 100 Most Endangered Sites but as of 2010 the danger was over. Renovated in 2013 by Marmol/Radziner. Open for public tours and donations.

After passing through several owners including Lou Bach, author Ayn Rand bought the house with her husband, Frank O'Connor, and lived there from 1943 to 1951 when they moved to New York. She called it "unbelievably wonderful." She wrote much of Atlas Shurgged here. Rand rented the house in 1951 to Ruth Beebe Hill, which continued under the new 1963 owner, Kathryn Houchins, who also owned an adjacent horse farm. When the Hills decided to move, Houchins decided, out of a fear of "hippies" moving in, to destroy the house immediately. The site became part of the horse farm which was later sold to developers.

After Miller left Palm Springs in 1943, she rented to military friends stationed in town. When she returned, the house had fallen into such disrepair she closed up the house and left town. It was listed for sale in 1947 but did not sell until 1950, when she sold to Charlie Farrell. He rented it to various tenants and in 1959 converted the garage into a second rental apartment. Farrell sold it to a family who did awful alterations to break up the space into smaller spaces. In 1999, Hal Meltzer bought the house initially to restore but flipped a year later. Sold in 2000 to Catherine Meyler whose first problem was keeping out the crack addicts who seemed to have taken up temporary residence.

Meyler's restoration efforts included replacing the roof; re-piping and re-plumbing; replacing the electrical system; reframing the living room and garage; installing new insulation in all walls and ceilings; replacing window glass; refinishing the concrete floor; and adding a six-foot wall around the property. She also had a new HVAC system designed to fit seamlessly into the existing structure and commissioned craftsmen to recreate the original built-in furniture in the living room/studio and master bedroom. She spoke about it in 2004.

Meyler also put in a guest house addition, designed by Neutra in 1938 but never built. Meyler had the original plans and it was constructed with little modification. As she reports, the guest house "stands in the exact spot it was designed for and is enjoyed enormously by friends who previously only had day beds as an option for overnight stays."

1937 - The George Kraigher House I, aka the Brownsville House, 525 Paredes Line Road, Brownsville TX, the state's first Modernist house. Kraigher was making a landing at the Los Angeles Airport and he saw a radical design off of the runway, according to Gene Fernandez of the Brownsville Historical Association. He contacted Neutra and asked to build one in Brownsville. Kraigher left for WWII and did not return to Brownsville until after the war. Hesold the house in 1946. In the 1950s Neutra designed a second house near Litchfield CT where Kraigher lived until his death in 1984. As of 1998, the house had been empty for 20 years and was covered in graffiti. In 1999, it was purchased by the City Of Brownsville. In 2005, the City leased it for 99 years to the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College, who did a complete restoration (bottom photo). As of 2012, maintenance funding was in question as TSC and UT-Brownsville ended their partnership. A nonprofit called Neutra Cultural Center in 2014 signed a three-year lease with the City of Brownsville to teach architecture, design, visual arts and culture to low- and moderate-income children. In early 2015, the AC units were stolen. As of 2016 the building had a new tenant and a historical marker was installed. History (pdf).

1963 - The James and Barbara Baker House, aka the Stone-Fisher Speculative House, 2105 Trentham Road, Lake Sherwood CA. Overlooks Lake Sherwood. Sold in 1999 to Alan Katz and Jerry Simmons. Sold in 2001 to Russell A. and Donna J. Goodman. Sold to the Goodman Family Trust.

The Stone-Fisher Speculative House was the same design Neutra used to build a number of houses along the mountain ridge above Beverly Glen Drive in Los Angeles. These houses were single-story builds attached to the mountain and were cantilevered over the slope on 3 long metal stilts that were embedded 20-30 feet below. While consistent with the structural design requirements of the time, several of these houses collapsed in the 1971 San Fernando Valley Earthquake.

Katz and Simmons adhered strictly to the house's original plans, only creating a carport in the driving court and converting the house’s original attached garage into a den/TV room adjacent to the kitchen. Between 2001 and 2002, Russell and Donna Goodman had a structural analysis performed and had the structure reinforced with additional steel embedded in concrete; then they commissioned Leonardo Umansky, Arxis Design Studio, to design two more floors beneath the original single-story house, each new floor being smaller than the one above it, to lock the house into the slope and enhance its resistance to any future quakes. The two new floors added approximately 1,500 sq. ft. to the house. Text and photos by Michael Locke.

1963 - The Maximilian (Milan) and Blanca Roven / Abraham Spiegel Houses, 900 and 910 North Alpine Drive, Beverly Hills CA. The Rovens (upper lot, 910) and Abraham Spiegel (lower lot, 900) engaged Neutra to design two 6000 sf+ houses starting in 1956. However, according to Neutra expert Barbara Lamprecht, several factors including uneasy client relations, questions about the legality of the subdivided lot, and Neutra's two bouts in the hospital led to his losing the clients.

In 1961, architect Benno Fischer, former project architect for Neutra, redesigned the site based in part on Neutra's original layout.

1965 - The BEWO-Bau GmbH Development II, Quickborn, Germany. About 13 miles outside Hamburg. A dense estate of 67 detached houses; they have been better preserved than the first BEWO development of 1960. According to Der Spiegel 26 August 1964, the development got off to a very difficult start - with only four homes sold 18 months in. The houses were expensive and did not sell well. Material and craftsmanship were outstanding, but Neutra demanded a new thinking from the purchasers by offering smallish homes tightly packed together, 44 of them even attached, with small private gardens but blocked views. Bewobau subsequently cancelled plans for another 422 houses. For the remaining homes, historic preservation status came in 2005. As of 1994, 62 of the homes are supposedly kept in the Neutra-spirit, and only five homes got major alterations. Interior color photos by Iwan Baan.

Begun as a low-budget project drawn by his son Dion, and completed (after a break during which financing was unavailable) by Honegger, a Swiss architect who previously worked with Neutra. Even so, a few months before he died, Neutra requested in a letter to be referred to as the home's original architect. Sold to a second owner, an attorney.

2011 - A house for sale in Madrid is listed as designed by Richard Neutra. However, Neutra never designed any houses in Spain. We alerted noted Neutra expert Barbara Lamprecht. She commmunicated with the family of the owner. According to the owner's nephew, "This project was done in the 1960s for the soldiers of the American base in Torrejon de Ardoz, that is why it was called Aneutra." The real estate listing agent saw this term and made an incorrect assumption. Case closed.
