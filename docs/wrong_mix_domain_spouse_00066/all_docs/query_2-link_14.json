        "text": "Emmys parties are in full swing as nominees hit the town to celebrate Monday’s big night.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is on the scene at the biggest bashes and will be updating this post with all things seen and heard throughout Emmys weekend and during the post-ceremony celebrations. Check out the action below, see photos here and get the complete winners list here.\n\nMonday, Aug. 25\n\nAMC/IFC, held at BOA Steakhouse in West Hollywood:\n\n1:04 am: Drama series winner Vince Gilligan makes his way out of AMC’s party — escorted by an AMC rep — after holding court at a table with the cast and producers all night.\n\n12:08 a.m. Gilligan is mingling on the patio with girlfriend Holly Rice, writing winner Moira Walley-Beckett and director Michelle MacLaren as well-wishers stop and ask for photos. An exuberant AMC president Charlie Collier makes the rounds, saying he wasn’t so much shocked by Breaking Bad‘s wins as “very pleased!”\n\nHBO, held at Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood:\n\n12:28 a.m. In the limo line, Chuck Lorre stops to chat with Allison Tolman to praise the young actress for her breakout performance in Fargo. “You were great,” he raves. The actress, who will soon relocate to L.A., says she’s next filming a couple of guest roles on comedy shows, declining to provide more details.\n\n12:08 a.m. True Detective’s Woody Harrelson poses for countless photos with Nigel Lythgoe waiting — camera phone in hand — nearby. Also near the throng of fans: his huge bodyguard. A few minutes later, HBO’s Richard Plepler says he has “no regrets” about entering True Detective as a drama over mini.\n\n11:35 pm Jon Voight is philosophical about not winning an Emmy tonight. He says his reward is all the fun he is having on Ray Donovan.\n\n11:28 p.m. Idris Elba (pictured at right) arrives and takes photos with several friends before taking a seat near the center of the HBO party.\n\n11:15 p.m. Downton Abbey’s Joanne Froggatt tries to maneuver through a crowded section of the the bar. She says that people have been apologizing for stepping on her J. Mendel dress. Turns out the actress is as polite as her character Anna Bates. “I’ve been saying, ‘No, I’m sorry’ because I chose to wear this!’ ” she says with a laugh.\n\n11:10 p.m. The Normal Heart winner Ryan Murphy greets HBO PR maven Nancy Lesser, who asks to touch his Emmy. Nearby, T.J. Miller and the Silicon Valley cast greets Zach Woods of Veep as well as Fred Willard and Garry Shandling.\n\n11 p.m. Sofia Vergara catches up with friends as Julianna Margulies and Good Wife co-star Christine Baranski take a trip to the ladies room together. NBA star Chris Bosh chats with WME agent-turned-fashion guru Andrew Weitz. Chuck Lorre and former Warner bros. boss (and current Academy honcho) Bruce Rosenblum chat by the entrance.\n\n10:46 p.m Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer and his daughter Maya head in seconds after a solo Mike Judge of Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, The Newsroom stars Alison Pill and Jeff Daniels heads out along with Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara.\n\n10:45 p.m. Emmy winner Sarah Silverman holds hands with her boyfriend, Michael Sheen, whom she thanked in her speech. She has changed out of her Emmy gown into black shorts and thigh-high socks.\n\n10:33 p.m. Mark Ruffalo (pictured at left) is bombarded by well-wishers at the Normal Heart table, but he finds a moment for a surprisingly intense PDA smooching session with wife Sunrise Coigney. Nearby, True Detective‘s Nic Pizzolatto chats with managers Bard Dorros and Michael Sugar as Woody Harrelson sips water.\n\n10:15 p.m. Billy Crystal, who shared a heartfelt tribute to Robin Williams during the Emmys telecast, chats with Wolfgang Puck.\n\n10:01 p.m. Jodie Foster and wife Alexandra Hedison have an animated conversation with Lisa Ling and Zac Posen in the center of the crowded party.\n\n9:35 p.m. Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan tries to sneak in a bite of dinner as one fan after the next comes up to take pictures with him — and his Emmy. He says he was sure True Detective was going to win the best drama statue — until Bryan Cranston upset Matthew McConaughey, when, he notes, “the tone changed.” He then poses with AMC chief Charlie Collier, who both insist it’s just as great the second time around.\n\n9:30 p.m. Lena Dunham (pictured below right with Girls co-star Allison Williams) and boyfriend Jack Antonoff stop to tell THR they have had a wonderful trip to L.A. but can’t wait to get back to New York City.\n\n9:08 p.m. Peter Dinklage arrives on the early side. He heads to the buffet, where he grabs arugula salad and watermelon and beet salad.\n\n9:05 p.m. Malin Akerman stands with Lisa Kudrow by the dessert table. A fan tries to interrupt their lively conversation.\n\n8:40 p.m. Julia Roberts walks into the HBO afterparty — barefoot. Husband (and fellow Emmy nominee) Danny Moder is by her side, carrying her shoes.\n\nFox, held at Vibiana in downtown L.A.:\n\n10:40 p.m. Modern Family co-showrunner Steve Levitan didn’t think the ABC comedy would win. “There was so much momentum for some of the other shows,” he said between handshakes at the Fox bash. “We have tough competition.” He called Orange Is the New Black a “great show” with “a lot of heat.” He attributed his show’s staying power to the story being so real and relatable — something he plans to focus on rather than the opportunity to make history with a sixth straight Emmy next year.\n\n10:04 p.m.Ryan Murphy poses for photos with American Horror Story‘s Sarah Paulson and winnerJessica Lange. “I’m really touched that Larry Kramer got a standing ovation,” he says of the win for HBO’s The Normal Heart. Kramer, he says, is prepping a script for the sequel. As for AHS: Coven‘s loss, the prolific showrunner says he’s learned never to be surprised by the Emmys.\n\n10:03 p.m. The Fox party is not just for scripted fare. The company’s anti-Hollywood contingency is out in full force, with Fox News contributor Stacey Dash luxuriating alone on a couch and grand poobah Bill O’Reilly making his way though the crowd — beaming and towering above most guests.\n\n9:50 p.m. “I haven’t felt this good since the premiere of The Shield!” FX’s Chuck Saftler tells THR of Fargo‘s win and the record viewership for FXX’s The Simpsons marathon.\n\nGovernors Ball, held at the LA. Convention Center in Los Angeles:\n\n8:48 p.m. Killing Kennedy author and Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly str‎olls around the Governors Ball looking slightly out of place. Best miniseries Emmy winners Warren Littlefield and Noah Hawley (Fargo) also hit the bash. Littlefield sends Hawley to get his Emmy engraved. “This is incredible!” says Hawley, who clutches the statue tight.\n\n8:20 p.m. As the crowd pours into the Governors Ball, The Normal Heart star Mark Ruffalo is the first to the engraving station. His wife takes a shot of him smiling big with the statue. Ryan Murphy and American Horror Story actress (and Emmy winner) Jessica Lange arrive together seconds later.\n\nSunday Aug. 24\n\nShowtime, held at Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood:\n\n10 p.m. Alex Gansa says he’s been hit up a lot lately by news programs to talk about the recent gruesome execution of journalist James Foley but has declined, “I’m not the right guy to talk about that on the news.” Elsewhere, lead actor in a comedy series nominee Matt LeBlanc (pictured at right with Allison Janney) says he avoided being jet-lagged on Emmy day by flying back to L.A from England (where Episodes is filmed) a whole week early, On the eve of the 20th anniversary of Friends, LeBlanc reunited with his co-star and Web Therapy actress Lisa Kudrow at the party with a hug and kiss. Kudrow would be greeted by a throng of fans outside the Sunset Tower Hotel, to which the actress responded by staying inside as long as possible before her car arrived.\n\n9:35 p.m. As nominee Claire Danes and husband Hugh Dancy wait at the packed valet, a group of fans on the street begins shouting for autographs. “Claire! I love you more than you loved Jordan Catalano!” one yells. Alas, Danes is not impressed by the My So-Called Life reference.\n\n8:35 p.m. At Showtime’s Sunset Tower party, musical guest KT Tunstall gets Danes and Dancy to participate in an audience sing-along to her hit “Black Horse and Cherry Tree.” Separately, Mandy Patinkin and Jon Voight dance from a distance.\n\nFrom left: Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes and KT Tunstall at Showtime’s party\n\n8:25 p.m. Chelsea Lately comic Heather McDonald, who has an upcoming Showtime stand-up special, introduces herself to Edie Falco, asks to take a picture with Jon Voight and then poses for a strategically positioned selfie with Elliott Gould, Liev Schreiber and Voight chatting in the background.\n\n8:23 p.m. Showtime’s David Nevins takes the stage at the Tower bar to acknowledge Showtime’s nominees and introduce Tunstall. “I promise not to be in this sling next year,” he jokes, referencing his recent arm injury. He congratulates the net’s Emmy nominees, reading off a list that includes Lizzy Caplan, Don Cheadle and William H. Macy, among several others.” And Matt LeBlanc,” he adds, revealing that the Episodes star was left off. “I don’t know what that means, Matt,” he jokes.\n\n8:15 p.m. Homeland showrunner Alex Gansa catches up with his star Claire Danes, who’s back from South Africa for the awards weekend. Minutes later Gansa and his wife chat with Homeland studio chief Bert Salke and his wife, NBC’s Jen Salke, on the outside patio. Inside, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves and wife Julie Chen hold court as a stream of execs and agents including Showtime’s Matt Blank, Legendary’s Bruce Rosenblum and WME’s Rick Rosen stop by to kiss the ring.\n\nFrom left: Julie Chen, Leslie Moonves, Felicity Huffman William H. Macy and Matthew C. Blank (Photo by: AP Images)\n\n7:45 p.m. Double nominee (and Creative Arts winner for best guest star) Allison Janney greets Nevins at the network’s Sunset Tower party as Matt LeBlanc, Rob Morrow, Jon Voight and Mandy Patinkin arrive.\n\nNBC, held at Boa in West Hollywood:\n\n8:20 p.m. Russell Peters, judge on Last Comic Standing, chimes in on NBC’s ratings. “NBC is back to being proud as a peacock. Matter of fact, they are serving it here at the party. NBC is also serving shrimp with Brandon Tartikoff sauce — for those old enough to get that reference.”\n\n7:30 p.m. Lorne Michaels inches closer to getting into NBC’s shindig. Catching up curbside: Colin Jost, Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon.\n\n7:10 p.m. A super-slim Allison Williams (pictured at right with Greenblatt) and pal Bee Shaffer stop to catch up with NBC Entertainment president Jen Salke, while NBC Entertainment chair Bob Greenblatt greets a gaggle of agents. At a reserved table by the entrance sits Katherine Heigl with her party posse, her mom and husband. The kid stars of Parenthood pose for pictures together as CW showrunner Julie Plec chats with a friend nearby. Meantime, NBC broadcast chairman Ted Harbert waits patiently in the line for sushi, while SNL‘s Cecily Strong makes her way to the raw bar.\n\n7 p.m. Asked how TV has changed, Elliott Gould says: “Television has changed. It’s gotten a lot better. I’m really happy to be on Ray Donovan. Frances Ford Coppola called me and asked what I was doing. I said, ‘I’m doing a lot of television.’ He said, ‘That’s good!’ I’ll be 76 soon. I’m happy to be working.”\n\n6:55 p.m. It’s a mini-Happy Endings reunion as The Mindy Project‘s Adam Pally and Marry Me‘s Casey Wilson make their way through the packed house. Not far behind: creator David Caspe.\n\n6:30 p.m. Greenblatt chats with Netflix’s Ted Sarandos and Universal TV’s Bela Bajaria, who had carpooled with employees to five parties the night before.\n\n6:20 p.m. Sound of Music EP Neil Meron says he’s skipping attending Monday’s ceremony before recalling watching the live performance of the beloved musical with Greenblatt. He said the exec received a call from Brian Williams complimenting him on the live performance. His daughter, Girls star Allison Williams, meanwhile, was watching Sound of Music with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. Cut to a year later and Allison Williams is now starring in the follow-up: Peter Pan.\n\nICM Partners, brunch at partner Chris Silbermann’s Santa Monica home\n\n1:15 p.m. Modern Family co-creator Chris Lloyd confirms he’ll be missing yet another Emmy telecast and jokes that his annual tradition of playing basketball will be made more difficult by the show’s move to Monday night. White Collar and Graceland showrunner Jeff Eastin asks ICM partner Mark Gordon to introduce him to Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan (pictured at left), whom he idolizes. Gilligan has had a circle of well wishers around him since he arrived, with many predicting Breaking Bad will beat True Detective. Gilligan, who has been skipping the weekend party circuit to work on spinoff Better Call Saul, is far less convinced his series will win.\n\n12:10 p.m. Gilligan arrives at the ICM Partners brunch at Chris Silbermann‘s Santa Monica home, just ahead of execs including AMC’s Charlie Collier and Joel Stillerman and ABC’s Patrick Moran. Stars including Marg Helgenberger and Modern Family‘s Jesse Tyler Ferguson seek shade, while NCIS: New Orleans star Scott Bakula makes the rounds.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 23\n\nTV Academy Nominees’ Reception, Pacific Design Center\n\n9:45 p.m. The annual celebration of nominated actors turned in a respectable roster of some two dozen performers, including Masters of Sex‘s first-time nominee Lizzy Caplan (seen leaving the event with actor James Marsden), Veep‘s supporting actor nominee Tony Hale, who complained that too much partygoing was wreaking havoc on his voice, and lead comedy actress nominee for Orange Is the New Black‘s Taylor Schilling, who, upon exiting the fete, hugged The Americans‘ guest actress nominee Margo Martindale, gushing, “I love you so much!” Also among those whose busy night ahead forced them to leave immediately following the presentation were Downton Abbey‘s Michelle Dockery, Joanne Froggatt and Jim Carter. Noticeably absent from the festivities were big names like Kerry Washington and Lena Dunham, both of whom popped up later in the night at other events, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Robin Wright, Kevin Spacey, and all of the Breaking Bad nominees — Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn — though Bad co-star Betsy Brandt (pictured at right) was on-hand with pal Kate Flannery (The Office).\n\nWME, held at the Beverly Hills home of partner Richard Weitz:\n\n11:30 p.m. As Game of Thrones‘ George R.R. Martin waits for his car, he graciously fields questions from an inquisitive cameraman. He gets big laughs when the interviewer asks if he knows how the final two books in the Game of Thrones series conclude and he responds with a big smile: “Of course. … I may be a little drunk from the party, but I’m still not going to tell you!” Nearby, Will Arnett is asked for fashion advice as he waits for his car and mogul Russell Simmons makes his way in.\n\n11:25 p.m. Fox’s Gary Newman and wife (and attorney) Jeanne Newman arrive at WME, their fourth party of the night. Nearby Matt LeBlanc chats with attorney Jared Levine, The Good Wife‘s Josh Charles gives a bear hug to Will Arnett and Tom Colicchio, attorney Joel McKuin chats with FX’s John Solberg, and New Girl‘s Max Greenfield and wife (and Fox casting executive) Tess Sanchez head for the exit.\n\n11:07 p.m. Showtime’s David Nevins made the rounds at the WME party with his left arm in a sling. No, he wasn’t roughed up by Ray Donovan; he had surgery after he tore his biceps muscle lifting some stuff around the house. Yes, it was very painful.\n\n10:02 p.m. Katherine Heigl takes a break from smoking to give WME party host Richard Weitz a hug as her mom, Nancy, chats next to her and husband Josh Kelley on a couch. Nearby Big Bang Theory‘s Mayim Bialik catches up with a friend, while Hello Ladies star Stephen Merchant glad-hands guests.\n\n9:35 p.m. Ricky Gervais chats gamely with TMZ as he leaves the WME party in his trademark black T-shirt. He even gives the cameraman a hug as he gets in his car.\n\n9:30 p.m. Netflix’s Ted Sarandos arrives after hosting his own toast with Netflix stars at his home and catches up with Showtime’s Matt Blank. Sarandos talks up nominee Jodie Foster‘s impact as a director on Orange, having set the tone for a series featuring largely green talent.\n\n9:25 p.m. George R.R. Martin steps out of his Rolls-Royce and joins the party as Entourage‘s Jerry Ferrara huddles with David Spade and Kat McPhee. Amazon Studios boss and new L.A. resident Roy Price smokes in the corner while Will Arnett chats up Comedy Central exec Kent Alterman by the dessert table.\n\nUTA, held at the Brentwood home of managing director Jay Sures:\n\n9:05 p.m. Showtime chief David Nevins makes his way through the crowd, while Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara is cornered by a parade of greeters. The Talk co-host Aisha Tyler has a huddle of guests in stitches as Aaron Paul catches up with Breaking Bad producers and AMC execs.\n\n8:35 p.m. Partygoers are greeted by key lime pie Jell-O shots at the entrance to UTA’s fete. A platinum blond Lena Dunham holds court by the entrance as stars including Minnie Driver stop by to say hello. Jodie Foster catches up with host Jay Sures, while new Fox entertainment president David Madden fields congratulations (and perhaps some pitches) on his new gig. A steady stream of execs, including ABC’s Ben Sherwood and Paul Lee, Lionsgate TV’s Sandra Stern, FX’s Nick Grad, Gary Newman and David Nevins, flood in as waiters pass around Animal-catered appetizers that have many raving.\n\nSunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood:\n\n9:05 p.m. Veteran comedian Richard Lewis enters the Sunset Tower Hotel bearing flowers and a gift for a lady friend. The pair take a corner booth by the Tower Bar’s fireplace.\n\n8:44 p.m. Orange Is the New Black‘s Natasha Lyonne steps out onto the terrace of the Sunset Tower Hotel to enjoy a cigarette. Nearby, Kyle MacLachlan takes a phone call to track down a tardy dinner companion.\n\nBAFTA Los Angeles TV Tea Party, held at SLS Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles:\n\n4:05 p.m. Veep‘s Timothy Simons, mingling while wearing sunglasses and a blazer, says appearing on the HBO show gives him “free rein to say all the terrible things” he’s always wanted to say.\n\n4 p.m. Comedian Stephen Merchant chats with Minnie Driver (pictured at left), who is nominated for outstanding lead actress in a movie or miniseries. When asked about what drew him to comedy, Merchant says when you’re “6-foot-7 and awkward, it’s the obvious thing to do.”\n\n3:30 p.m. Orange Is The New Black‘s Laverne Cox, flanked by two guests, is swarmed by admirers telling her how much they enjoy the Netflix series.
