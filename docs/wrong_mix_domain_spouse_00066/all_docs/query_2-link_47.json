        "text": "Anne Sweeney\n\nI'll be honest with you: This is the only job I'm focused on right now. And I love it.\" Anne Sweeney deftly has deflected yet another inquiry about her aspirations for the top job in the Walt Disney Co. empire when her boss, chairman and CEO Robert Iger, steps down in 2015. A nudge for a more revealing answer proves futile. Sweeney laughs and begins to repeat herself: \"This is the only job …\"\n\nIt's quintessential Sweeney: careful, deliberate, unfailingly polite.\n\nCertainly her present job — as co-chair of Disney Media Networks, and president of Disney/ABC Television Group — would require no small amount of focus. She oversees nearly 10,000 employees at ABC (the entertainment and news divisions plus daytime), eight local stations, seven cable networks (including ABC Family, Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior), Hyperion Publishing, Radio Disney, ABC Studios and Disney's 50 percent stake in A+E Networks. This year, Disney Media Networks saw revenue increase 4 percent to $19.4 billion while operating income grew 8 percent to $6.6 billion. She receives 300 to 500 e-mails a day (\"I read through them quickly, and I delegate well\"). Most of each day is spent in meetings (\"But lucky me, I like everyone on my team\"). And she travels to New York (where ABC News, Hyperion and various other businesses are based) about once a month.\n\n\"I believe in having total clarity around our goals,\" she says. \"I believe in creating these goals together as a group and making sure they're aligned with Bob Iger's goals for the Walt Disney Co. And more than anything, making sure people understand that they have a responsibility to one another. And when one of us has a great victory, it is a result of everyone working together. And quite honestly, we share the failures as well.\"\n\nTHR's most powerful woman in entertainment for a third straight year, Sweeney, 55, a married mother of two who had early aspirations to be a teacher (her mother and grandmother were teachers, and her daughter is pursuing a master's in education at Stanford University), says she never plotted a high-powered career trajectory for herself.\n\n\"I really moved through my career based on curiosity about something,\" she says. \"I never looked at a title and said, 'I want that.' \"\n\nNonetheless, Sweeney's achievements would seem to reveal canny career management in addition to smarts and an ability to delegate and inspire.\n\n\"She has a unique combination of professionalism and warmth,\" says Katie Couric.\n\nSweeney was instrumental in the deal that brought Couric to ABC Daytime and also made her a special correspondent for ABC News. \"There's something very appealing about someone who is a straight-talking, direct executive, who I think was genuinely excited about the prospect of me coming to ABC,\" adds Couric. \"I never felt like there was that unctuous quality that you sometimes see in executives who are trying to lure you to come to a place.\"\n\nSweeney was in the studio audience Sept. 10 for Couric's first show (it was the most successful talk show launch in a decade, since Dr. Phil). And she still watches Katie, just as she watches all of the morning news shows and ABC's entertainment lineup (which still boasts the top-rated comedy and drama on TV with Modern Family and Grey's Anatomy, while Entertainment chief Paul Lee has ordered full seasons of freshman series Nashville and The Neighbors). She was at the Good Morning America staff meeting July 9 after Robin Roberts announced on air that she was suffering from a rare blood disorder and would undergo a bone marrow transplant. And she was on the phone before 6 a.m. with ABC News president Ben Sherwood the morning GMA snapped Today's 16-plus-year morning news win streak.\n\n\"We found out at 8:31 a.m. on April 19,\" says Sherwood. \"I would say she found out around 5:31 a.m. [L.A. time].\"\n\nSweeney has been invaluable in the news division's joint venture with Univision, says Sherwood, who credits her experience launching networks earlier in her career at Nickelodeon then FX. And she spearheaded Disney's Day of Giving, a companywide effort that has raised $19 million for the Red Cross to help those affected by Hurricane Sandy. She was in constant communication with the news division when an ABC crew was briefly abducted in 2011 during the demonstrations in Cairo. And she checked in on an ABC News employee who during the Thanksgiving holiday choked on a grape in the cafeteria and had to be saved by the Heimlich maneuver.\n\n\"She's the leader of a 10,000-person organization,\" says Sherwood. \"And she leads it with real vision for where she wants the company to go, and she leads it with a real personal touch.\"\n\nCollaborative and available, Sweeney is a natural mentor, especially to other women.\n\n\"I was in a meeting in her office a couple of months ago, and I looked around, and it was all females. It wasn't because we were dealing with a female enterprise; it happened because every position of leadership in the room were all women,\" recalls Couric. \"And I'm not anti-man. But I do think some of the highest positions have been and continue to be closed off to women. I think until you get women at the highest positions, that's when you start creating a truly level playing field. And I think it's only a matter of time until the very top is occupied by a woman as well.\"\n\nAs a kid I was always: A great reader who kept reading even when the lights went out with a flashlight under the covers. I loved good stories. I knew when a character was a good character. That was the beginning of all of this for me: great storytelling.\n\nFavorite way to unwind: Binge-watching Revenge and Scandal on multiple devices.\n\nTotally starstruck around: There are a few: Julie Andrews; Richard Sherman, who wrote the music for Mary Poppins; and Dick Van Dyke. I was in a meeting with Julie years ago, and she started to read to us from one of her children's books. I almost put my head on the table.\n\nProudest moment this year: The Day of Giving we put together across every ABC show for victims of Hurricane Sandy. We raised about $19 million for the Red Cross.\n\nWhat I'd tell my 22-year-old self about working in Hollywood: \"Relax.\"\n\nStacey Snider\n\nThis summer, rumors swirled that Snider was in talks with Comcast to take over Universal. Although those discussions broke down, Snider shored up the standing of the 80-person DreamWorks by extending financing with backer Reliance, which committed another $200 million-plus, allowing Snider, 51, and partner Steven Spielberg to make 8 to 10 movies over the next several years. It was a disappointing year at the box office for DreamWorks — People Like Us bombed with $12.4 million. However, Snider and the studio are ending on a high note: Spielberg's awards darling Lincoln has turned into an event movie for adults, earning north of $85 million to date.\n\nMoment I knew I wanted to work in the business: I was in law school, and to make money I wrote briefs for a law firm and coverage of scripts for an agency [APA]. I made $50 a script. There was something about those first couple synopses. … I felt thrilled.\n\nWho gave me my first big break: The University of Pennsylvania alumni connection. I reached out to a lot of alums, including producer Bob Cort, who sent me to Tom Pollock, who said I should be an agent. I applied at CAA and Triad, and I got the job in the mailroom at Triad.\n\nMost exciting decision we've made as a company this year: Going into business with Mister Smith, David Garrett's new company, which is allowing DreamWorks to make output deals with European distributors.\n\nWhen I leave work each day, I can't wait to: See my family and get comfortable. I could set a land-speed record for getting out of my clothes and into sweats, Uggs and a ponytail.\n\nMy indulgence: Sugar. Every morning I swear off it, and every night I have Oreos.\n\nCan't get through my work day without: Tea, hot. Working-class PG Tips.\n\nMost surprising songs on my iPod: Blue Valentine soundtrack.\n\nMy proudest moment this year: Seeing Lincoln. And I was proud that last year we had two best picture noms.\n\nTotally starstruck around: Steven Spielberg. He's one of the only people in my life where the experience doesn't get old.\n\nBest advice I've ever gotten: From Peter Guber: \"The material will determine your fate.\"\n\nTop three shows on my DVR: The Daily Show, The Rachel Maddow Show and Homeland.\n\nEmbarrassed to admit I watch: Any Dateline true-crime specials that start with, \"She was a good-time girl …\"\n\nEileen O'Neill\n\nAs the leader of two divergent brands in the Silver Spring, Md.-based Discovery portfolio, O'Neill has maintained the flagship quality of Discovery Channel (the No. 8 network among men 25-to-54 in the third quarter, thanks to the success of Shark Week, Sons of Guns and Bering Sea Gold; quarterly earnings for the company were $206 million) while guiding a rebrand of TLC from the home of dry documentaries to a repository for subculture reality (Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Breaking Amish) that often draws as much criticism as it does high ratings. O'Neill, 46, who has a 12-year-old son with her partner, makes no apologies for Honey Boo Boo, the show about a sassy 7-year-old beauty pageant aspirant and her rural Georgia family. It ranked No. 1 on ad-supported cable in its Wednesday night time slot among all key demographics and has been picked up for a second season. And she points out that \"in the same year we hit pop-culture gold with Honey Boo Boo, we also potentially furthered science and safety technology with Plane Crash,\" part of the Discovery series Curiosity.\n\nMoment I knew I wanted to work in the business: I was a starving grad student [at Bowling Green State University in Ohio], eating popcorn and Kraft mac and cheese, and a big, glossy Discovery Channel intern packet was sent to me in the mail.\n\nWho gave me my first big break: Former Discovery Channel president Clark Bunting, who recognized my passion — despite having no experience for program scheduling — and moved me from business affairs to Travel Channel scheduling.\n\nWhen I leave work each day, I can't wait to: See my family and then check the FiOS \"What's Hot\" app in primetime to see who is getting traction.\n\nFavorite way to unwind on the weekend: Walking our beagle, Riley.\n\nMy indulgence: Ben & Jerry's Milk & Cookies ice cream.\n\nCan't get through my workday without: Teasing [TLC senior vp production and development] Howard Lee about something; listening to sarcasm from [Discovery/TLC spokesperson] Laurie Goldberg and being first to comment on Nielsen overnights.\n\nMost surprising song on my iPhone: My team won't be surprised that I have the theme song from Rocky.\n\nProudest moments this year: Discovery aired Space Jump Live to record Sunday afternoon numbers, and TLC rocked prime with Long Island Medium and Breaking Amish.\n\nTotally starstruck around: Josh Charles and Harrison Ford.\n\nWhat I'd tell my 22-year-old self about working in Hollywood: \"Don't work in Hollywood; commute there from Washington, D.C.\"\n\nBest advice I've ever gotten: From my dad in a greeting card: \"Protect yours; kick theirs.\"\n\nWhen my relatives are confused about what I do, I tell them: I watch TV.\n\nTop three shows on my DVR: The Good Wife, Scandal and Downton Abbey.\n\nEmbarrassed to admit I watch: iCarly.\n\nNina Jacobson\n\nThe producer is responsible for one of Hollywood's hottest new franchises, The Hunger Games. The Lionsgate film, released in the spring, was a global goliath, taking in nearly $690 million (No. 7 for the year). After being unceremoniously fired as president of Disney's film division — her partner had just delivered their third child when she got the call — Jacobson, 47, formed her production company and began scouting for projects. She set up the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series at 20th Century Fox before nabbing the rights to Suzanne Collins' young-adult novel The Hunger Games. There are three more movies to go (the third book is being split into two films). The Hunger Games: Catching Fire opens in theaters Nov. 22, 2013.\n\nMoment I knew I wanted to work in the business: When I started film theory at Brown, and all I wanted to do was watch movies. I felt as excited as I ever did when I sat down in a movie theater.\n\nWho gave me my first big break: Producer Lauren Shuler Donner. She agreed to meet me when I graduated from Brown and hired me to do free-lance research. Her office also let me know what jobs were becoming available at other companies, and I got a job with Joel Silver in 1987.\n\nToughest decision I had to make this year: Figuring out how to reload Hunger Games when Gary Ross left as director and make sure we chose the right person.
