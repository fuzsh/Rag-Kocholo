On the legislative front, the Committee on Government Reform was very active promoting stronger management practices at Federal departments and agencies and improving the operations and effectiveness of Federal programs. Whether transforming the organizational structure of the General Services Administration or granting the right to vote to citizens of the Nation's Capitol, the committee remained focused on making the Federal Government more responsive to the needs of the people it serves. At the committee's request, the Government Accountability Office [GAO] produced 359 reports, testimonies and briefings in support of oversight investigations and program reviews. As a result of the Government Reform Committees oversight, billions of dollars worth of outright savings, avoidable costs and increased revenues have been identified and captured. In the course of that oversight, the committee and subcommittees uncovered wasteful spending, mismanagement, ineffective policy implementation, and poor interagency coordination. Direct savings and other financial benefits identified as a result of the committee's GAO work alone now total $6.5 billion.\\1\\ Current oversight yielded savings in areas such as the Department of Defense excess property reutilization system ($42 million) and information technology investments at the Department of Interior ($80 million). Other quantifiable fiscal achievements accrued from earlier GAO reports to the committee. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The total represents the net present value in fiscal year 2006 of financial benefits identified and accrued as a result of GAO findings and recommendations contained in work on which the Government Reform Committee was a requestor. The process used to calculate and review savings and other financial benefits attributed to GAO recommendations is described at length in the Performance and Accountability Report for Fiscal Year 2005 at http://www.gao.gov/ new.items/d061sp.pdf. Accessed Oct. 10, 2006. Savings and other benefits may be captured over 5 fiscal years. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I. Jurisdiction and History of the Committee The Committee on Government Reform serves both as the House of Representative's government operations committee and also as its chief investigative and oversight body, reviewing allegations of waste, fraud and mismanagement across the Federal Government. Alone among the House committees, the Committee on Government Reform has legislative jurisdiction over the operations of all Federal agencies including, human resources, information technology, procurement, and financial and general management policy. Unlike other House committees, the committee has the authority to conduct oversight and investigations outside of its legislative jurisdiction. The committee's unique legislative jurisdiction and oversight authority make it one of the most influential committees in the House of Representatives. Congressman Tom Davis (R-VA) served as the chairman of the committee in the 108th and 109th Congress. The ranking minority member was Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA). The Committee on Government Reform first appeared in 1927 as the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. It was created by consolidating the 11 Committees on Expenditures previously responsible for overseeing how taxpayer moneys were spent at each executive branch department. Under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the committee was renamed the Committee on Government Operations. The name change was intended to communicate the primary function of the committee to study ``the operations of Government activities at all levels with a view to determining their economy and efficiency.'' The Government Operations Committee's oversight jurisdiction over all Federal agencies and departments was unprecedented in the legislative branch. On January 4, 1995, Republicans assumed control of the House of Representatives for the first time in over 40 years. Republicans immediately implemented several internal reforms, including an initiative to reduce the number of standing committees in the House and cut committee staffs by one-third. The Committee on Government Reform exemplified the changes that took place in the House. Both the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and the Committee on the District of Columbia were consolidated into the newly named Government Reform and Oversight Committee. The name change highlighted the Republican view that the Federal Government needed reform to ensure accountability. This consolidation of three committees into one resulted in millions of dollars in savings and a nearly 50 percent reduction in staff. At the start of the 107th Congress, the committee's name was shortened to the Committee on Government Reform. House Rule X, clause 1(h) sets forth the committee's jurisdiction, functions, and responsibilities as follows: 1. The Federal Civil Service, including intergovernmental personnel; and the status of officers and employees of the United States, including their compensation, classification, and retirement. 2. Municipal affairs of the District of Columbia in general (other than appropriations). 3. Federal paperwork reduction. 4. Government management and accounting measures generally. 5. Holidays and celebrations. 6. Overall economy, efficiency, and management of government operations and activities, including Federal procurement. 7. National Archives. 8. Population and demography generally, including the Census. 9. Postal Service generally, including transportation of the mails. 10. Public information and records. 11. Relationship of the Federal Government to the States and municipalities generally. 12. Reorganizations in the executive branch of the Government. Every standing committee, including the Committee on Government Reform, has general oversight responsibilities pursuant to House Rule X, clause 2. These responsibilities include the analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of Federal laws including the necessity or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation. The committees are also charged with determining whether laws and programs are being implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress and whether they should be continued, curtailed, or eliminated. Each standing committee is required to review and study on a continuing basis the application, administration, execution, and effectiveness of laws and programs addressing subjects within its jurisdiction as well as the organization and operation of agencies within its jurisdiction. In addition to its general oversight responsibilities, the Committee on Government Reform has the following special and additional functions: Special oversight functions, Rule X, clause 3(e) The Committee on Government Reform shall review and study on a continuing basis the operation of Government activities at all levels with a view to determining their economy and efficiency. Additional functions of committees, Rule X clause 4(c) (1) The Committee on Government Reform shall-- (A) receive and examine reports of the Comptroller General of the United States and submit to the House such recommendations as it considers necessary or desirable in connection with the subject matter of the reports; (B) evaluate the effects of laws enacted to reorganize the legislative and executive branches of the Government; and (C) study intergovernmental relationships between the United States and the States and municipalities and between the United States and international organizations of which the United States is a member. (2) In addition to its duties under subparagraph (1), the Committee on Government Reform may at any time conduct investigations of any matter without regard to clause 1, 2, 3, or this clause conferring jurisdiction over the matter to another standing committee. The findings and recommendations of the committee in such an investigation shall be made available to any other standing committee having jurisdiction over the matter involved. In the 109th Congress, the committee was composed of 39 members (21 Republicans, 17 Democrats and 1 Independent). The committee had seven subcommittees. II. Rules of the Committee U.S. House of Representatives 109th Congress Rule XI, clause 1(a)(1)(A) of the House of Representatives provides: The Rules of the House are the rules of its committees and subcommittees so far as applicable. Rule XI, clause 2(a)(1) of the House of Representatives provides, in part: Each standing committee shall adopt written rules governing its procedure. * * * In accordance with this, the Committee on Government Reform, on February 9, 2005, adopted the rules of the committee: Rule 1.--Application of Rules Except where the terms ``full committee'' and ``subcommittee'' are specifically referred to, the following rules shall apply to the Committee on Government Reform and its subcommittees as well as to the respective chairmen. [See House Rule XI, 1.] Rule 2.--Meetings The regular meetings of the full committee shall be held on the second Tuesday of each month at 10 a.m., when the House is in session. The chairman is authorized to dispense with a regular meeting or to change the date thereof, and to call and convene additional meetings, when circumstances warrant. A special meeting of the committee may be requested by members of the committee following the provisions of House Rule XI, clause 2(c)(2). Subcommittees shall meet at the call of the subcommittee chairmen. Every member of the committee or the appropriate subcommittee, unless prevented by unusual circumstances, shall be provided with a memorandum at least three calendar days before each meeting or hearing explaining (1) the purpose of the meeting or hearing; and (2) the names, titles, background and reasons for appearance of any witnesses. The ranking minority member shall be responsible for providing the same information on witnesses whom the minority may request. [See House Rule XI, 2 (b) and (c).] Rule 3.--Quorums (a) A majority of the members of the committee shall form a quorum, except that two members shall constitute a quorum for taking testimony and receiving evidence, and one-third of the members shall form a quorum for taking any action other than the reporting of a measure or recommendation. If the chairman is not present at any meeting of the committee or subcommittee, the ranking member of the majority party on the committee or subcommittee who is present shall preside at that meeting. (b) The chairman of the committee may, at the request of a subcommittee chairman, make a temporary assignment of any member of the committee to such subcommittee for the purpose of constituting a quorum at and participating in any public hearing by such subcommittee to be held outside of Washington, DC. Members appointed to such temporary positions shall not be voting members. The chairman shall give reasonable notice of such temporary assignment to the ranking members of the committee and subcommittee. [See House Rule XI, 2(h).] Rule 4.--Committee Reports Bills and resolutions approved by the committee shall be reported by the chairman following House Rule XIII, clauses 2- 4. A proposed report shall not be considered in subcommittee or full committee unless the proposed report has been available to the members of such subcommittee or full committee for at least three calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, unless the House is in session on such days) before consideration of such proposed report in subcommittee or full committee. Any report will be considered as read if available to the members at least 24 hours before consideration, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays unless the House is in session on such days. If hearings have been held on the matter reported upon, every reasonable effort shall be made to have such hearings available to the members of the subcommittee or full committee before the consideration of the proposed report in such subcommittee or full committee. Every investigative report shall be approved by a majority vote of the committee at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Supplemental, minority, or additional views may be filed following House Rule XI, clause 2(l) and Rule XIII, clause 3(a)(1). The time allowed for filing such views shall be three calendar days, beginning on the day of notice, but excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays (unless the House is in session on such a day), unless the committee agrees to a different time, but agreement on a shorter time shall require the concurrence of each member seeking to file such views. An investigative or oversight report may be filed after sine die adjournment of the last regular session of Congress, provided that if a member gives timely notice of intention to file supplemental, minority or additional views, that member shall be entitled to not less than seven calendar days in which to submit such views for inclusion with the report. Only those reports approved by a majority vote of the committee may be ordered printed, unless otherwise required by the Rules of the House of Representatives. Rule 5.--Proxy Votes In accordance with the Rules of the House of Representatives, members may not vote by proxy on any measure or matter before the committee or any subcommittee. [See House Rule XI, 2(f).] Rule 6.--Record Votes A record vote of the members may be had upon the request of any member upon approval of a one-fifth vote of the members present. Rule 7.--Record of Committee Actions The committee staff shall maintain in the committee offices a complete record of committee actions from the current Congress including a record of the rollcall votes taken at committee business meetings.

Where the subject matter of the referral involves the jurisdiction of more than one subcommittee or does not fall within any previously assigned jurisdiction, the chairman shall refer the matter as he may deem advisable. Bills, resolutions, and other matters referred to subcommittees may be reassigned by the chairman when, in his judgment, the subcommittee is not able to complete its work or cannot reach agreement therein. In a subcommittee having an even number of members, if there is a tie vote with all members voting on any measure, the measure shall be placed on the agenda for full committee consideration as if it had been ordered reported by the subcommittee without recommendation. This provision shall not preclude further action on the measure by the subcommittee. Rule 9.--Ex Officio Members The chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee shall be ex officio members of all subcommittees. They are authorized to vote on subcommittee matters; but, unless they are regular members of the subcommittee, they shall not be counted in determining a subcommittee quorum other than a quorum for taking testimony.

In accordance with House Rule XI, clause 2(j)(2), each committee member may request up to five minutes to question a witness until each member who so desires has had such opportunity. Until all such requests have been satisfied, the chairman shall, so far as practicable, recognize alternately based on seniority of those majority and minority members present at the time the hearing was called to order and others based on their arrival at the hearing. After that, additional time may be extended at the direction of the chairman. (b) The chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, or the committee by motion, may permit an equal number of majority and minority members to question a witness for a specified, total period that is equal for each side and not longer than thirty minutes for each side. (c) The chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, or the committee by motion, may permit committee staff of the majority and minority to question a witness for a specified, total period that is equal for each side and not longer than thirty minutes for each side. (d) Nothing in paragraph (2) or (3) affects the rights of a Member (other than a Member designated under paragraph (2)) to question a witness for 5 minutes in accordance with paragraph (1) after the questioning permitted under paragraph (2) or (3). In any extended questioning permitted under paragraph (2) or (3), the chairman shall determine how to allocate the time permitted for extended questioning by majority members or majority committee staff and the ranking minority member shall determine how to allocate the time permitted for extended questioning by minority members or minority committee staff. The chairman or the ranking minority member, as applicable, may allocate the time for any extended questioning permitted to staff under paragraph (3) to members. Rule 15.--Investigative Hearing Procedures Investigative hearings shall be conducted according to the procedures in House Rule XI, clause 2(k). All questions put to witnesses before the committee shall be relevant to the subject matter before the committee for consideration, and the chairman shall rule on the relevance of any questions put to the witnesses. Rule 16.--Stenographic Record A stenographic record of all testimony shall be kept of public hearings and shall be made available on such conditions as the chairman may prescribe. Rule 17.--Audio and Visual Coverage of Committee Proceedings (a) An open meeting or hearing of the committee or a subcommittee may be covered, in whole or in part, by television broadcast, radio broadcast, Internet broadcast, and still photography, unless closed subject to the provisions of House Rule XI, clause 2(g).

(c) Personnel providing coverage of an open meeting or hearing of the committee or a subcommittee by Internet broadcast, other than through the Committee Broadcast System, shall be currently accredited to the Radio and Television Correspondents' Galleries.

Legislative Accomplishments The Committee on Government Reform was very active in the 109th Congress improving the operations and effectiveness of the Federal Government. Significant reforms were made to modernize the U.S. Postal Service, promote stronger management practices at Federal departments and agencies, revitalize the Nation's emergency response infrastructure, protect employees from discrimination, prevent the undue influence of outside interest groups in the operations of the Federal Government, advance our Nation's efforts to reduce the presence of illegal narcotics in society, improve the transportation system serving the Nation's Capital, and advance voting representation in the House of Representatives for the District of Columbia. All of these initiatives were crafted with an eye toward making the Federal Government more efficient and effective, thereby saving taxpayer dollars. Modernizing the U.S. Postal Service H.R. 6407, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, was passed by both houses of Congress on the last day of the 109th Congress. H.R. 22, the original version of the ``Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act,'' passed the House in July 2005 by a vote of 410-20, and the Senate passed its version of H.R. 22 by unanimous consent in February 2006. H.R. 6407 reflects a recent bipartisan agreement between the House, Senate and administration on postal reform legislation. This landmark legislation mandates transparency in the Service's finances, costs, and operations; creates a modern system of rate regulation; establishes fair competition rules and a powerful new regulator to oversee operations; addresses the Postal Service's universal service obligation and the scope of the mail monopoly, and institutes improvements to the collective bargaining process. The U.S. Postal Service is the center of a $900 billion industry employing 9 million workers nationwide. Each year, USPS processes and delivers over 200 billion peices of mail to more than 130 million households and businesses in the United States. However, the last major overhaul of the statutes governing the Postal Service occurred in 1970, before the Internet and emails, before letters became ``snail mail,'' before the de-regulation of the airline industry, before competitors like FedEx even existed. Today, this critical component of our Nation's economy is being challenged by a variety of factors including decreasing volume, insufficient revenue, mounting debts, and new technologies such as Internet advertising, electronic bill payments, emails and faxes. As a result, the GAO has included the Postal Service on its ``High-Risk Series'' since 2001. Promoting Stronger Management Practices at Federal Departments and Agencies The committee took a proactive role in improving government efficiency by approving the Program Assessment and Results Act, the Government Efficiency Act, and the Truth in Regulating Act reauthorization. These measures, along with several others adopted by the committee, demonstrated the committee's commitment to championing improved management practices at Federal departments and agencies. Revitalizing the Nation's Emergency Response Infrastructure The committee played an integral role in congressional efforts to establish a new, stronger Federal Emergency Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security following the investigation conducted by the Select Bipartisan Committee on Katrina. As a result of those efforts, FEMA now has a direct line of communication to the President in the event of an emergency to prevent communication breakdowns at the Federal level in future disasters. In addition, the committee included in the legislation key provisions to address waste, fraud and mismanagement challenges that plagued the Department of Homeland Security in its response and recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina. Protecting Employees from Discrimination By a vote of 34-1, the committee adopted legislation to modernize, clarify and expand the Federal employee whistleblower protection laws. One of the most significant reforms included in the legislation was allowing a Federal employee to have his or her claim decided in Federal district court if the Office of Special Counsel [OSC] does not take action within 180 days in response to a whistleblower complaint filed with them. This would include a right to a jury trial. Under current law, the only recourse for most Federal whistleblowers is the Merit Systems Protection Board [MSPB]. In addition to this structural change, the legislation includes provisions aimed at clarifying congressional intent in response to Federal court rulings regarding whistleblower claims that have been issued over the past decade. Preventing the Undue Influence of Outside Interest Groups in the Operations of the Federal Government In response to reports of undue influence by lobbyists upon Members of Congress and other Federal officials, the committee approved legislation to deny Federal pensions for Federal officials convicted of accepting bribes, defrauding the Federal Government, embezzling Federal property, or falsifying Federal documents. In addition, by a vote of 32-0, the committee approved legislation to provide enhanced transparency to the operations of the executive branch by ensuring that the behavior of our public servants is above reproach and worthy of the public trust. The legislation struck a balance between reasonable and focused rules of ethical behavior and arbitrary restrictions and prohibitions that hamstring our officials and prevent them from exercising the discretion needed to perform their missions on behalf of our citizens. The intent of both initiatives was to enhance the public's trust in our Federal Government. Advance Our Nation's Efforts to Reduce the Presence of Illegal Narcotics in Society The committee unanimously adopted legislation to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy and to make it more efficient by reducing outdated reporting and structural requirements required by law. The legislation also improves ONDCP and its programs by enhancing effectiveness and accountability in drug treatment and requiring greater diligence in addressing our Nation's methamphetamine epidemic. Ultimately the legislation gave ONDCP the necessary tools to reduce elicit drug use, manufacturing, trafficking, drug- related crime and violence and drug-related health consequences. In doing so, the legislation reaffirmed our Nation's commitment to continuing the war on the supply side of the drug equation while reaffirming our commitment to addressing the demand side as well. Improving the Transportation System Serving the Nation's Capital The committee unanimously approved legislation to establish critical new oversight and accountability mechanisms for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority [WMATA], including an Inspector General and an increased Federal presence on WMATA's Board of Directors. In addition, for the fifth time since President Eisenhower signed the original legislation in 1960, the legislation reauthorizes the Federal Government's commitment to authorizing Federal funding for WMATA maintenance and operations. With over half of Metro's riders at peak times being Federal employees and contractors, and Metro's record riderships occurring during historic events where people from all over the country flock to the Nation's Capital to honor their Federal Government, it is essential that the Federal Government continue to contribute to the transit system's operations. However, unlike previous authorizations, this WMATA authorizes makes the Federal funds contingent upon the three localities of Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia matching any Federal contribution to WMATA. Advancing Voting Representation in the House of Representatives for the District of Columbia By a vote of 29-4, the committee approved bipartisan legislation to give citizens of the District of Columbia direct representation in the House of Representatives. The legislation contained two main features. First, it treated the District as a congressional district for the purpose of granting full House representation. Second, it increased the size of the House by two Members. In increasing the size of the House, the bill follows the historic House tradition of increasing representation in a non-partisan manner. Strengthening Professional Sports Drug Testing Policies H.R. 2565, the Clean Sports Act of 2005, was approved by the Committee on Government Reform by unanimous consent in May 2005. The legislation sought to strengthen the testing procedures and toughen the penalties for the use of performance-enhancing drugs in professional American sports. H.R. 2565 was the product of months of commitee work--three congressional hearings and an ongoing investigation into the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. As a result of the pressure imposed upon the professional sports leagues by the committee's investigative and legislative work, the leagues strengthened their internal drug testing programs and policies. Consequently the committee decided not to pursue enactment of the Clean Sports Act during the 109th Congress. However, the committee intends to monitor the situation and may decide to take action in the future if necessary. Reauthorizing the Office of National Drug Control Policy H.R. 6344, the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act, was passed by both houses of Congress on the second to last day of the 109th Congress. H.R. 2829, the original version of the ``Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act,'' passed the House in March 2006 by a vote of 399-5. H.R. 6344 reflects a recent bipartisan agreement between the House, Senate and administration on reauthorization of the Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP]. The legislation makes ONDCP more efficient by reducing outdated reporting and structural requirements required by current law. The bill also improves ONDCP and its programs by enhancing effectiveness and accountability in drug treatment and requiring greater dilligence in addressing out Nation's methamphetamine epidemic. The legislation reforms the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign--which coordinates anti-drug advertising--and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program--which involves coordination among Federal, State and local law enforcement--to make them more effective. Both programs have grown in ways that were not originally intended, and the bill reflects the desire to ensure they remain accountable and dedicated to their core purposes. A.
