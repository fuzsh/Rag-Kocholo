        "text": "RICHARD NEUTRA (1892-1970)\n\nNeutra was born in Vienna, Austria, into a wealthy Jewish family. He attended the Sophiengymnasium in Vienna until 1910, then he studied under Adolf Loos and Otto Wagner at the Vienna University of Technology from 1910 to 1918. In 1912 he undertook a study trip to Italy and the Balkans with Ernst Freud (son of Sigmund Freud). Neutra studied at the University of Zurich and worked briefly for landscape architect Gustav Amman. In 1921 he worked as City Architect in the Planning Department of Luckenwalde in Germany. He also worked briefly for architect Erich Mendelsohn in Berlin. In 1922, Neutra married Dione Niedermann and they moved to the US in 1923. At the funeral of Louis Sullivan, Neutra met Frank Lloyd Wright, who hired him in 1924 to work at Taliesin in Wisconsin while Wright was in Japan. Work ran out in 1925 and Neutra left Taliesin to work in California with Rudolf Schindler. Among many projects, Schindler and Neutra collaborated on an entry for the 1927 League of Nations Competition; in the same year they formed a design firm with planner Carol Aronovici called the Architectural Group for Industry and Commerce (AGIC). Neutra and Schindler and their wives were very close; they shared space in Schindler's house on Kings Road in Los Angeles from February 1925 until the Neutras left to tour Europe in May 1930.\n\nThe breakup of Neutra and Schindler is often accorded to Neutra \"stealing\" client Phillip Lovell for the Lovell Health House. According to Neutra's son Raymond, it was not that simple. Schindler was busy with projects like the Wolff House on Catalina Island and the unbuilt Transparent House for Aline Barnsdall. Phillip Lovell was grumpy about an earlier 1924 Schindler cabin that collapsed in the snow during its first winter. Schindler was also having an affair with Harriet Freeman, Lovell's sister-in-law (who Lovell intensely disliked) and Lovell didn't want the architect of his Health house under her influence. Schindler was just as happy not to put up with Lovell, and the project shifted to Neutra. The hostility began in late 1930 when Schindler heard from friends that Neutra was not crediting him about the League of Nations project. It got worse when Schindler was rejected from the Philip Johnson's MOMA International Style exhibition in New York which Neutra brought to LA for the 1932 Olympics. Neutra and Schindler ended their partnership and co-residency and rarely interacted after that. When Neutra had a heart attack in 1953, he found himself in the same hospital room as Schindler. They made peace before Schindler died there of cancer. The hostility was mostly on Schindler's side and Neutra was happy to have the reconciliation.\n\nNovelist and philosopher Ayn Rand based character Howard Roark in The Fountainhead partially on Neutra. She was the second owner of Neutra's Von Sternberg House. Between 1927 and 1969, Neutra designed more than 300 houses in California and elsewhere. In 1949, TIME Magazine featured Neutra on its cover and ranked him second only to Frank Lloyd Wright in American architecture. After that, Neutra had all the work he could ever want. Neutra hired many young architects who went on to independent success including Gregory Ain, Harwell Hamilton Harris, and Raphael Soriano.\n\nArchitect Robert Evans Alexander joined Neutra and the firm became Neutra and Alexander starting in 1949. They agreed that Neutra would still design residential commissions on his own while larger commercial and institutional commissions would be handled as Neutra and Alexander. Alexander was actively involved in many multi-housing projects but only two single-family houses during that period: the Hall House and the Governor's house on Guam. They broke up in 1959 over disagreements on large-scale jobs.\n\nNeutra visited the NC State School of Design as a guest lecturer twice, the first time in 1950 and again on December 13, 1957. He led the class in writing a letter to Frank Lloyd Wright: \"Certainly today all serious architectural students are aware of your tremendous contribution to both the fiber and spirit of the art, and almost all are in sympathy with the means you have used in giving your ideas form, even though our own incipient philosophies and forms may be directed in many different ways. With these thoughts in mind, we would like to join with Mr. Neutra in sending you heartfelt greetings at this Christmas season. With respectful wishes — [Signed by fourteen students.]\"\n\nIn 1965, Neutra formally partnered with his son Dion Neutra as Richard and Dion Neutra and Associates. In 1966, he moved back to Vienna and died in Wuppertal, Germany in 1970 while in the middle of an argument with a client, according to grandson Justin, who later made a short film about Neutra. In 1977 Neutra was awarded the AIA Gold Medal. The font Neutraface, designed by Christian Schwartz for House Industries, was based on Neutra's architecture and design principles.\n\nThe Ennis House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Lovell Health House, designed by Neutra\n\nRichard Neutra: An Interior View, grandson Justin Neutra's audition for the American Film Institute.

The units were to be sited at Van Ness and Harold Way in Hollywood, but Miller ran out of funds and left town. The contractor took ownership and finished the job. At the time of construction, it was the most unusual apartment complex in LA.

Neutra's client, who was a fitness expert, wanted the house to symbolize physical well-being. It lit Neutra's career. Harwell Hamilton Harris was the project architect. Once the house was built, Neutra conducted tours which attracted more than 15,000 visitors. Included in the 1932 NY Museum of Modern Art exhibit. Sold to Edith Blan.

Rand rented the house in 1951 to Ruth Beebe Hill, which continued under the new 1963 owner, Kathryn Houchins, who also owned an adjacent horse farm.

He rented it to various tenants and in 1959 converted the garage into a second rental apartment. Farrell sold it to a family who did awful alterations to break up the space into smaller spaces. In 1999, Hal Meltzer bought the house initially to restore but flipped a year later.

Sold in 1999 to Alan Katz and Jerry Simmons. Sold in 2001 to Russell A. and Donna J. Goodman. Sold to the Goodman Family Trust.\n\nThe Stone-Fisher Speculative House was the same design Neutra used to build a number of houses along the mountain ridge above Beverly Glen Drive in Los Angeles. These houses were single-story builds attached to the mountain and were cantilevered over the slope on 3 long metal stilts that were embedded 20-30 feet below. While consistent with the structural design requirements of the time, several of these houses collapsed in the 1971 San Fernando Valley Earthquake.\n\nKatz and Simmons adhered strictly to the house's original plans, only creating a carport in the driving court and converting the house’s original attached garage into a den/TV room adjacent to the kitchen. Between 2001 and 2002, Russell and Donna Goodman had a structural analysis performed and had the structure reinforced with additional steel embedded in concrete; then they commissioned Leonardo Umansky, Arxis Design Studio, to design two more floors beneath the original single-story house, each new floor being smaller than the one above it, to lock the house into the slope and enhance its resistance to any future quakes. The two new floors added approximately 1,500 sq. ft. to the house.

The Rovens (upper lot, 910) and Abraham Spiegel (lower lot, 900) engaged Neutra to design two 6000 sf+ houses starting in 1956. However, according to Neutra expert Barbara Lamprecht, several factors including uneasy client relations, questions about the legality of the subdivided lot, and Neutra's two bouts in the hospital led to his losing the clients.\n\nIn 1961, architect Benno Fischer, former project architect for Neutra, redesigned the site based in part on Neutra's original layout.\n\nThe Speigel House (ad above) was sold around 2005 to the Afshani family and destroyed for a new house.

About 13 miles outside Hamburg. A dense estate of 67 detached houses; they have been better preserved than the first BEWO development of 1960. According to Der Spiegel 26 August 1964, the development got off to a very difficult start - with only four homes sold 18 months in. The houses were expensive and did not sell well. Material and craftsmanship were outstanding, but Neutra demanded a new thinking from the purchasers by offering smallish homes tightly packed together, 44 of them even attached, with small private gardens but blocked views. Bewobau subsequently cancelled plans for another 422 houses. For the remaining homes, historic preservation status came in 2005. As of 1994, 62 of the homes are supposedly kept in the Neutra-spirit, and only five homes got major alterations.

We alerted noted Neutra expert Barbara Lamprecht. She commmunicated with the family of the owner. According to the owner's nephew, \"This project was done in the 1960s for the soldiers of the American base in Torrejon de Ardoz, that is why it was called Aneutra.\" The real estate listing agent saw this term and made an incorrect assumption.
