With his father’s consent, at 17 years of age Paul dropped out of high school to enlist in the United States Navy.\n\nFour years in the Navy gave Paul the structure that paved his path in life, instilled his passion for travel, and gave him the opportunity to meet the love of his life, Garnett. Newly married, Paul finished high school and began what would be a 10+ year journey in higher education. He obtained a four year degree and graduated Valedictorian of his class at God’s Bible School and College while working full time at Westinghouse in Cincinnati, Ohio. Two years at Wilmington College and graduating with honors allowed him to continue on for a Master’s Degree in Theology from the United Theological Seminary. Several years later, he obtained a teaching degree from Glenville State College in West Virginia while working at Kinney Shoe Factory.\n\nPaul spent the first half of his professional life as a Minister in Ohio, the second half as a social worker in West Virginia, and his entire life as a teacher. He truly believed in life-long learning and was a ferocious reader of all subject matter which is how he obtained a “doctored” Doctorate in Quackery.\n\nOutside of his professional life, Paul participated in Good Sam’s Camping Club, Fishing Clubs, Green Key Society of Wilmington College, visited and drove in all 50 US states, traveled internationally, and attended grandchildren and great-grandchildrens’ extra-curricular activities, even when it meant traveling cross country. Always a hard worker, he also spent many years “Down on the Farm” as a Gentleman Farmer.\n\nWhile he loved getting into deep, philosophical discussions, his greatest love was for his family and friends. Rest peacefully, Paul. You were such a passionate, honest, strong, respectable, loving, generous man. You are forever held in our hearts.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please make a donation to WV Caring, PO Box 760, Arthurdale, WV 26520 (wvcaring.org).\n\nPaul’s request for Cremation has been honored at Pat Boyle Funeral Home’s On-Site Crematory.

She was the only daughter of the late Earl Moss and Lydia Margurite Johnson Curry.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her only brother, Earl Moss Curry, Jr.; her husband and love of her life, Joseph Eugene Chico; and her best friend and partner in crime, Bea Ellyson.\n\nKay was a graduate of Pineville High School in Pineville, WV. While in high school, she was a cheerleader and very active in theater productions. She went on to West Virginia University where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education and continued her love for the stage. Kay played Poopsie in Pajama Game her first year of college. She joined Alpha Phi Sorority and met her husband, Joe.\n\nKay and Joe married in Mt. Airy, North Carolina. To this loving marriage, three children were born. She moved to Tucson, AZ where she obtained her first Master’s Degree at University of Arizona in Physical Education. Near the end of her professional career, Kay obtained a second Master’s Degree in Public Health from WVU.\n\nEducation was a passion! Her first year of teaching was spent at Tucson High School where she always said the students there called her “Mes.” When she talked about her time at Tucson High, she had a pat response of “I hate Meses to pieces.”\n\nHer love for West Virginia drew her back to the state. She was offered jobs teaching at Marshall University and Glenville State College. She chose to teach at GSC where she spent 35 years impacting the lives of students and the college community.\n\nKay was a safe haven for many students who were far from home while obtaining their college degree. Many students spent their time dancing in the living room of her home with her children on the weekends. As her children got older, they learned of her “bring your own steak nights.” Kay would provide the side dishes and students would bring their own steaks and grill. Later in her teaching career, even though she professed to not like college students, she allowed several of them to live in her home so they could get their degrees.\n\nShe was very active in Glenville First Baptist Church. She made sure her children were raised in church and knew God. Her children were very lucky to have such a Godly mother.\n\nKay was literally a world traveler. She and her friends traveled to Greece, Russia, England, Italy, Australia, Scotland, Caribbean Islands, Hawaii and all across the U. S. She loved everywhere she traveled. The only complaint we ever heard about her travels was that returning from out west in the U.S. by the southern route, there was nothing to see because trees were planted along the highways. She thought that was dumb.\n\nShe was a sports fanatic. She loved football and basketball. She hated baseball. Literally, hated it. She always said that if a major league baseball team was playing in her front yard, she wouldn’t look out the window. She attended every GSC football and basketball game. She also watched every WVU football and basketball game and watched every other team that played on television. She would coach them loudly as she watched. WVU was special and they were always coached from the beginning to end. If WVU would be losing, pacing would begin and you weren’t to speak until they began winning again. She once got the flu and said that if you had to be sick, during March Madness was the time to do it so you could lay on the couch and watch basketball.\n\nKay is survived by her three children, Margaret Lynn Chico-Eddy of Charleston, Myra Sue Chico Miller of Glenville and Eric David Chico (Jackie) of Newark, OH., four grandchildren, Erica Sue Eddy Allsup (Matthew) of Charleston, Eric David Curry Chico of Newark, OH, Jack E. Louis Chico of Newark, OH and Joshua Bly Miller (Brandie) of Glenville and three great-grandchildren, Katherine Myra Campbell of Charleston, Kevin Marcus Campbell of Charleston and Myla Bly Miller of Glenville; her son from another mother, Terry Ellyson; and host of Glenville State graduates that she considered to be her children.\n\nKay is also survived by her sister-in-law Ginny Curry of Albuquerque, NM, two nieces, Sarah Curry (David King) of Cleveland Heights, OH, Lucy Mahlum (Jim) of Santa Fe, NM, two cousins, Jane Franklin of Charlottesville, VA and Mary Olive Elder (Jerry) of Montgomery, TX . She has many brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, nieces and nephews on the Chico side who she loves very much.\n\nKay’s life will be celebrated on Sat., Feb. 5 at Ellyson Mortuary in Glenville. Visitation will be from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. The service will be at 2 p.m. Rev. David Carpenter will be doing the service and special music will be provided by Kay’s best girl, Allie Ellyson.

He departed this Earth following a brief illness and surrounded by the love of his entire family.\n\nHe was born on September 12, 1935, in Grantsville, a son of the late Curtis and Dorfetta Hathaway.\n\nOn June 12, 1955, he was wed to Barbara Kimble Hathaway, who survives.\n\nIn addition to his beloved bride and companion of 66 years, Charlie leaves behind two children: Gregory Hathaway, and wife, Teresa, of Weston, and Suzanne Simmons, and husband, Dan, of Coxs Mills; seven grandchildren: Miranda Hawkins, and husband, Jason, of Weston, Tara Smith, and husband, Josh, of Weston, Chelsey McCarthy, and husband, Jay, of Weston, Andrew Simmons, of Chicago, IL, Abigail Hathaway, of Weston, Hannah Simmons, and fiancé, Nick, of Point Pleasant, Emily Jeffries, and husband, Adam, of Ashland, KY; his two favorite little “doll babies” great-granddaughters: Sloane Smith and Josephine McCarthy; his adoring dog, Scooter; two siblings: Darrell Hathaway, and wife, Sandra, of Mineral Wells, and Dixie Gregg, and husband, James, of Norwich, OH; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nIt was a joyous reunion in Heaven as Charlie was reunited with his son, Michael Scott, who preceded him in death on October 8, 2020, and whom he missed tremendously.\n\nCharlie led a very fulfilled life.

Additionally, he was a member of the First Baptist Church of Weston. Charlie was also very active in the community, serving as a Lewis County Councilman for several years.\n\nGenerous, friendly, and kind, Charlie never knew a stranger. He could most often be found walking Scooter along the streets of Weston, outbidding everyone at local auctions, or enjoying a dinner out with his wife. Charlie was most proud of his legacy – his family. He never missed his grandchildren’s special events, no matter how far or how small and he would talk endlessly about their accomplishments to anyone who would listen.\n\nIn lieu of flowers or donations the Hathaway family asks that, in memory of Charlie, you take time to enjoy the small things. Cherish those that you love, pet a dog, smile at a stranger, and pay it forward.\n\nFollowing Charlie’s written wishes, no formal service will be held. “My family will be my eulogy. The love I have for them can never die. There will be no sermon nor final goodbyes. No service will be arranged, no gathering of family or friends- for the love shared in the good times is my life. Shed only tears of joy for me. Forever and always.”\n\nCharlie’s request for Cremation has been honored at Pat Boyle Funeral Home’s On-Site Crematory. A private inurnment will be held at a later date at Lewis County Memorial Gardens in Weston.\n\nWe, at Pat Boyle Funeral Home and Cremation Service located at 144 Hackers Creek Rd. in Jane Lew, are honored and privileged to serve the family of Charles “Charlie” Curtis Hathaway Online condolences may be expressed at www.PatBoyleFuneralHome.com.\n\nVera Louise (Williams) Davidson\n\nVera Louise (Williams) Davidson, 83, formally of Tanner, departed this earthly life in the early morning quiet of Friday, January 7th, 2022, at the home of her daughter in Bridgeport, WV, following an extended illness.\n\nShe was born near Tanner WV July 2, 1938, the second of ten children born to the late Russell L. and Bonnie Jones Williams.\n\nLouise and her late husband, Delbert L.

For 30 years she was the Director of Special Olympics in Gilmer County.\n\nWhen our house needed an addition, she built one on. Nothing could stop this lady. When grandchildren came, there was plenty of love to go around. As with her children, she was always there for them. Stewarts Creek Church was her home church. Genny served on the board of the Gilmer County Historical Society. The newsletter for the Gilmer County WV Retired School Employees was one of her projects she loved doing.

Dan was just 57 years old when kidney cancer stopped him in his tracks. If you knew Dan, you know he was quick and witty with a wicked sense of humor. Some would call him a smartass, but he had a heart of gold. He never knew a stranger, never failed to help a friend, and never stopped taking care of the people and places he loved.\n\nDan was born on a military base in Germany, but he grew up in Gilmer County. He was the fourth of seven children born to Ed and Margery Minney. Dan was born on Valentines Day 1964. He had five brothers – Mike, Jamie, Pat, Paul and Jerry and one sister Melissa. Margery always joked she couldn’t work the concession stand at school because she had the entire basketball team.\n\nDan lost his dad in 1993. His dad was his first coach and his best friend. They shared a love of music, motorcycles and Merle. Dan may have had the most eclectic record collection in the county. The more random and obscure a song, the more he liked it and the louder it was played. Dan idolized his dad and there’s no doubt the two of them are sitting somewhere tonight telling stories, listening to music, and drinking a beer.\n\nDan somehow snagged Connie way back in 1986, but it took him more than 30 years to convince her to marry him. Together, they raised four kids, three horses, two goats and countless chickens. Over the years, Connie and Dan made their home a safe haven for anyone who needed a friend, a parent, or a warm bed. Dan never met a stranger and could strike up a conversation with anyone sitting in a bar or honkytonk. His favorite nights were spent in Nashville bars with Connie and his niece, Michelle. He could talk sports, music, politics. You name it he knew something about it.\n\nHe was an accountant by trade, but his favorite titles were Dad and Papaw. He had four great kids – Konda, Amber, Derek, and Brionna and four fabulous grandkids – Addison, Payton, Bryson and Mila. They were the center of his world.\n\nA funeral service was conducted at the Ellyson Mortuary, Inc., 2 Vanhorn Drive, Glenville, WV, 26351 at 1:00 pm, Wednesday, November 17, 2021 with Pastor Bryan Groves officiating.

(Stehman) Shenk on April 1, 1926, in Lancaster County, PA and was raised in New Danville, PA. After completing ninth grade, Dotty received permission to attend college at the age of 15. She attended Lancaster Bible College where she would meet her future husband, J. Richard Kendig. While attending college, she learned about practical nurses training and in 1946, she left for New York City to take the Salvation Army School of Nursing course. She took her LPN boards in 1947.\n\nDotty married J. Richard Kendig on October 19, 1947, at Central Manor Church of God in Washington Boro, PA. Both she and Richard shared a desire for mission work. After the birth of their first daughter Mary Ann in 1948, they began applying to mission boards. After their second daughter, Marjorie was born in 1950, Dotty and Richard were accepted by the South American Indian Mission. In 1951, Dotty and her family left for Lima, Peru. In 1953, David was born in Lima. Dotty and her family served as missionaries in the Amazon jungle of Peru for 15 years. Her experiences in Peru led to many wonderful stories and memories that she often would share with her family and friends.\n\nAfter returning to the States in 1966, Dotty and her family lived in Millersville, PA. There, she worked at Millersville State College. In 1975, they found land in West Virginia, and it was there that she and her husband brought an old farm back to life by becoming successful sheep farmers. Dotty became known to many by selling butter and eggs to their neighbors. She also spent a lot of time with her husband traveling around locally as he played music. In 1991, her husband of 44 years passed away on the farm.\n\nIn 1992, Dotty began volunteering to teach Spanish at Flatwoods Elementary in Braxton County. This soon led to a part time paid position through the Central West Virginia Aging Services to teach Spanish in grades kindergarten through fourth. Dotty’s love of teaching Spanish led her to explore her more formal education so that she could obtain a teaching certificate. With her previous college credit, she earned a Regent Bachelor’s Degree from West Virginia State College in 2003 at the age of 77. She drove 100 miles each way, two nights a week after work to complete this degree, of which she was very proud.\n\nDotty would go on to teach Spanish in Gilmer County under a new program developed by Glenville State College. She taught four days a week in the elementary schools for two years. After her vision began to fail, she stopped teaching and was a foster grandparent to kindergarten students in Glenville Elementary. Dotty retired from working at the age of 86.\n\nAfter retiring, Dotty didn’t slow down. In 2015, Dotty wrote her first book about her life and experiences in Peru. She wrote and published a second book in 2018. Throughout her life Dotty enjoyed listening to NPR radio, reading, gardening, and spending time with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nDotty was preceded in death by her husband, J. Richard Kendig, her parents, Clayton and Alice Shenk, her siblings, Edna, Earl Raymond, Paul, Edgar, Robert, and Elsie and son-in-law, Terry Risley.\n\nShe is survived by her three children, Mary Ann Risley (special friend John Janzen), Glenville, Marjorie Colbert (Daniel), Glenville, and David Kendig (Sheba), Burnsville; grandchildren Doug Gantz (Jill), Joni Barwick (John), Justin Colbert (Courtney), Christopher Colbert (special friend Tamara Lapman), Adam Kendig (Amber) and Ashley Beck (Josh); great-grandchildren Tyler Gantz, Lindsey Gantz, Ryan James, Michael James, Sean Colbert, Connor Colbert, Mason Kendig, Zachary Kendig and Jackson Beck.\n\nThe family would like to recognize and thank the wonderful staff, nurses and doctors at Minnie Hamilton Hospital Long Term Care Unit for the care and love they gave to Dotty for the past three years.\n\nThe family held a private graveside service on Thursday, September 30th at their family cemetery on Dotty’s farm, per her wishes. A memorial service celebrating Dotty’s life will be held on Saturday, October 23, 2021 at 11AM at the family farm in Glenville, West Virginia.\n\nEllyson Mortuary, Inc., is honored to have assisted the family of Dorothy “Dotty” Kendig with arrangements.\n\nLanta \"Lantie\" Deward Radcliff\n\nTuesday, September 28, 2021 was a very dark day for the family of Lanta “Lantie” Deward Radcliff with his passing from Covid, after being so careful not to contract it.\n\nHerbert Radcliff and Hester Ann (Neal) Radcliff were proud to welcome Lanta into their small family on October 6, 1928, making him 92 at his passing. His family grew to have 10 children including him. Passing before him was Grover, Argil, Arnold (Sam), Warren (Bob), Eulah Mae, and Liza Mae. Two brothers- Jay Radcliff and Gary Radcliff and one sister Marie Sprouse remain.\n\nHe served our country in the Army entering on February 20, 1951. He was stationed state side with the 167th Infantry in Fort Lewis, WA and Fort Jackson, SC being discharged on March 10, 1953.\n\nLanta met, fell in love, and married his lifelong partner Mildred Louise (Smarr) Radcliff April 5, 1953 who survives. With that union they had two children, Dickie Edward Radcliff and Helen Louise Newman. Their family continued growing with 5 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews; he loved them all.\n\nHe, like the rest of us, had different jobs in his life but finally got on with Pennzoil where he spent 34 years of “hard” labor meaning most of his career was the sweat of the brow working, none of the machinery workers have today. After retirement he went on to do the same on his farm. The only machinery he used was a gravely tractor that he used to work his several plots for gardens and to mow his lawn. He just finished his last harvest this year. He didn’t have a riding mower until his son gave him one. He also had his chain saw he used to cut, split (wood splitter) and haul uncountable loads of wood to customers in Doddridge, Gilmer, and Lewis County over the years. He also raised and sold Christmas trees for several years. He loved to fish for his muskies, having a few favorite “holes” to fish in, and he also enjoyed his yearly deer and turkey hunt.\n\nAbove all he was a “Godly” man. His church was his sanctuary. He held many different roles in his “home” church, Mount Earnest Methodist on Rt. 18 in Gilmer County. It broke his heart when the doors of his church were closed because of Covid, but they were able to open its doors for a short while and he got to go back to the place he loved before the doors were shut again. You could count on him being at church and preaching on Sundays and Bible study every Wednesday, hardly ever missing either. He tried anything to get the youth involved in any aspect of the church from Bible school to youth meetings. He loved the ice cream socials and picnics, anything to do or help his house of worship. He would have a picnic and fishing at the pond on his property about every summer. All the kids knew and loved “Lantie Radcliff.”\n\nFamily and friends will be received on Monday, October 4, 2021 at the Mount Earnest United Methodist Church in Troy, from 12-1pm with the funeral service beginning at 1pm from the church chapel with Pastors Carl Radcliff and Peter Dietze officiating.

She died from advanced dementia occupied by comfort care after a diagnosis of COVID.\n\nBorn March 9, 1936 in Port Huron, MI, the eldest daughter to John and Minnie Doan. She enjoyed her time with family and friends in Michigan until her father’s work called the family to move across the United States to Ogden, Utah.\n\nOne night at a local dance hall Joan met her one true love, Bill Kennedy. Bill was an airman stationed at Hill Air Force Base. It was love at first sight and in a few short months the two were married December 23, 1955. When the two went to file for their marriage license, Joan found out she was older than Bill. A girl 18 can be married without parental consent a boy must be 21. Joan gave serious thought as to call off the wedding, but her love was stronger than her concern for the 9 days each year she would be older than Bill. Of course, Bill would remind her she had married a younger man those 9 days for the next 66 years.\n\nAs the newlyweds began their new life together. Joan would go to work While Bill was fulfilling his duties as an airman. Then Joan found out she was expecting their first child. It was a girl, Barbara Ann Kennedy. Unfortunately, Barbara was born at 6 months and only lived a few hours. A few years later in 1958 Joan was once again expecting another child. When it was time for Billy Jr to be born, Bill’s crew was scheduled for an overseas trip and since Joan was high risk, Bill was furloughed. That flight collided with another plane mid-air over Texas and all on board were killed. It was then Joan knew she was not cut out to be the wife of an airman and Bill didn’t re-enlist. Bill, Joan and newborn baby Billy Jr decided it was time for them to move back to Bill’s home town Rosedale.\n\nUnable to find a job that could support their family, they moved their little family to Ohio. Bill found work at Ford while Joan began working at Ridge Tool and Majestic Molding. Soon Bill decided it was time for them to open up a motorcycle dealership in Elyria, Ohio. It wasn’t long before they needed to work the dealership full time so Joan had to quit her office job. Her boss came into the dealership to get Joan back. He asked Bill what would it take for you to let Joan come back to work? Bill said you don’t have enough money. He said Joan did the work of 3 office girls. Hard work was something Joan did her entire life. Soon Joan was expecting another child.\n\nOne morning while 9 months pregnant, Bill called Joan and said have the neighbor ride the Triumph in today, I have it sold. The neighbor wasn’t available so Joan rode the motorcycle in that day. Later that night she went into labor and had a girl, Linda. Joan and Bill continued to work at the dealership. Once again Joan was expecting another child. After working hard all day they decided to go out for dinner and Joan went into labor. She was blessed with another son, Mark. The dealership began to grow and Joan and Bill won many trips that allowed them to travel all over the world. The couple took up flying and both Joan and Bill obtained their private pilot’s license.\n\nWanting to escape the Ohio cold winters the couple decided to move to DeLand, Florida. Locating just the right plot of land they build their new home together. The lot next door had a contractor building a new home when they purchased the land. Bill and Joan finished building their new home by hand before the contractor had finished the house next door. Running a dealership was what they knew so the couple opened up a used car dealership in DeLand, Florida. Joan would go to the auctions, detail the cars, sell the cars and complete all the paperwork.\n\nOnce again Bill decided it was time for them to change their occupation. This time they moved back to West Virginia where they could secure a new business venture in the gas and oil business. Not only did she do all the necessary paperwork, she worked right along-side Bill in the oil field. The couple would spend the next 20 plus year’s working their summers in the oil fields of West Virginia and winters in Florida.\n\nIn 2008 Joan and Bill got out of the gas and oil business and purchased a motor coach. The next few years they would travel the USA in the summer months and live in DeLand during the winter. She was a long-standing member of Liberty Baptist Church in Deland, Florida.\n\nJoan loved her family. She had two sister’s Louise Doan Hollingsworth and Ruth Doan Moss. She had four children Barbara Kennedy, Billy Kennedy, Linda Kennedy Varady married to Ken Varady, Mark Kennedy married to Heather Kennedy. She was blessed with 12 grandchildren Adam Kennedy (Marjie), Alan Kennedy, Amanda Kennedy Bruner (Thomas), Jenna Varady Gerber (Scott), Kendra Varady Cook (Jordan), Kenny Varady (Isabella) Nichole Varady Tollett (Seth), Ashley Kennedy Pokorney (Ben), Katlyn Kennedy, Brandon Kennedy, Madison Kennedys and David Oldfield.
