        "text": "Plans to relocate FC Groningen away from Oosterparkstadion were formulated in latter half of the 1990s when the club believed that the standard of their stadium was beginning to fall behind those of other teams across the Netherlands, particularly with UEFA’s increasingly stringent safety legislation and preference for seating after a series of high-profile incidents such as Heysel in the preceding decade.\n\nThe actual physical construction work took place between 2004-2005 but it took at least a decade to successfully get local businesses on board to invest in the wider business and retail complex (Europa Park) which Euroborg stadium was set to be at the heart of. Seen as crucial to generating the requisite finance, numerous redesigns of the stadium took place delaying the project due to the ever changing budget the designers Wiel Arets had to work with.\n\nFor example, the stadium was initially envisioned with a retractable roof but by the time the inaugural match was held against rivals SC Heerenveen on the 13th January 2006, a standard and more affordable design was favoured. The stadium currently consists of two tiers, with the club stating that there is the possibility of adding a third ring which will increase the capacity to over 33,000 although this wouldn’t be large enough for the World Cup and thus wasn’t considered as part of the country’s 2018 bid."
