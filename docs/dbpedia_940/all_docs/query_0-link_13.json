The international jury, which was chaired by Dutch Chief Government Architect Frits van Dongen, comprises well-known railway experts from the UIC as well as renowned experts in architecture, engineering, construction and design. The formal Brunel Awards ceremony took place in Amsterdam on October 15, 2014 in the Zuiderkerk. All winning and commended entries received the official Brunel Certificate of Recognition. Award-winning, commended and some selected projects are published in the competition catalogue and all entries were exhibited in Amsterdam during the ceremony."
