        "text": "Agree about the walks to Anfield and Goodison, when Man City played at Maine Road the long walk from Picadilly wasn't much better.\n\nIsn't there now a direct walking route which saves going along busy main roads and back streets? Back of my mind recalls something for the Commonwealths. Even so, as you say it's quite a hike.\n\nEdit - a shout-out too to The New Saints, who are professional in the Welsh Premier League and play in Oswestry, with no station. Semi-Pro clubs at that level of Welsh football in stationless towns also include Bala Town and Cefn Druids (Cefn Mawr).\n\nTNS is probably closer to Gobowen anyway, and less than 2 miles to the station (as is Cefn from Ruabon).\n\nBala, on the other hand, seems to sits neatly between several rail lines, and must be close to 20 miles away from a station. Unlike TNS, the team are part-time professionals, although they have played in the Europa league (qualifying).\n\nWycombe Wanderers was a good 45 minute walk when I did it, Chesters the same in fact it sits on the border with Wales most of the ground being over.\n\nWycombe's ground suffers from poor accessibility in general, being on the edge of town and with one road in and out only. This makes bus (and car) access really slow as well...\n\nthat isnt the club. That is the owning company. The club exists as it has since, what, 1870 odd?\n\nextra security hired in for Gray. Gonna be fun!\n\nBack on topic it is a decent walk to the new ground from the station especially via the town. Give me a shout if you need any pointers.\n\nThanks for that is it doable in 30?\n\nTNS is probably closer to Gobowen anyway, and less than 2 miles to the station (as is Cefn from Ruabon).\n\nBala, on the other hand, seems to sits neatly between several rail lines, and must be close to 20 miles away from a station. Unlike TNS, the team are part-time professionals, although they have played in the Europa league (qualifying).\n\nFor Bala, the best stations to use for it are Ruabon or Barmouth (and in fact my profile picture was taken on the way to Bala) and take the T3 the rest of the way. The closest station as the crow flies is Blaenau Ffestiniog, some 17 miles away.\n\nThanks for that is it doable in 30?\n\nYes - perhaps not if you go via town for a pint\n\nCome out of the station on victoria road turn left. Walk down to Chinese turn right walk down to park. Cross park to grange road turn left and follow crowd.\n\nHave a look on google maps and it will make sense\n\nBradford Park Avenue is a bit of a treck to the Interchange. Not been by train since Low Moor station opened which is closer, but I'm unsure (and can't be bothered) how regular trains are on Saturdays there."
