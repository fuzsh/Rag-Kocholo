Due to its international importance, every year millions of people from all over the world come to Berlin to take part in this tremendous celebration. If you are in Berlin in the beginning of October, passing by the Brandenburg Gate and taking part in the celebration is a must.\n\nThe Festival of Lights is a typical Berlin event that takes place over a week in October (for 2016: 07.10-16.10). During this period, all main monuments of the city are illuminated with different light themes. Insider tip: if you take the local bus 100 (from the Zoo to Alexanderplatz), you will be able to see all major illuminations & you don’t need to walk.\n\nIf you are up to some beer while enjoying an Oktoberfest atmosphere but you don’t have the opportunity to go to Munich, Berlin got you covered!
