        "text": "(Contact the author for a high-res version) In the last ten to fifteen years development-led archaeology has boosted the number of surveys and subsequent excavations in the Netherlands. Despite the number of excavations and the availability of much data little is known with regard to the actual gain of knowledge in connection to the wide range of research questions and topics of the National Archaeological Research Agenda. This book reports on a synthetic analysis of reports produced in the context of development-led projects over the past 10-15 years and concerning the early prehistory of the Netherlands. The degree to which development-led work permits to take major steps forward is highly variable. A limited number of topics has profited from the generated data, and in some cases development-led research has shown to be on the forefront of innovative approaches. A larger number of topics and research questions, however, appear to remain unanswerable; data have been generated, but remain of an anecdotal nature. This volume discusses various issues with regard to the gain of knowledge regarding the early prehistory of the Netherlands, and identifies problems, yet also provides possible solutions. This scientific report is aimed at archaeologists and other professionals occupied with Archaeology. With knowledge and advice the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands gives the future a past.\n\nPit hearth features are omnipresent on the coversand area in the Netherlands and bordering regions, especially the northern part of the Netherlands. They occur throughout the Mesolithic, between c. 9200 and 5000 cal. BC, and also in later periods, although in much smaller numbers. In this paper we briefly discuss different aspects of these features, such as shape and size, infill and contents, as well as spatio-temporal patterning, on a (sub-) regional scale and at site-level. In general, pit hearth features are filled with little more than charcoal and sand; flint and other lithics are rare, as is (charred) bone. The spatio-temporal distribution of pit hearth features is not homogeneous at a landscape level; shifting patterns can be observed over the long-term at the regional level but also on the level of the individual site. In addition, on the basis of 14C dates there exist spatial configurations of statistically ‘contemporaneous’ pit hearth features. A number of possible functions, including pits for roasting, cooking and smoking food, the heating of flint and other stone, and in particular the production of tar are discussed in more detail. It is clear, however, that there is a lot to be said about ‘pit hearths’ and that, despite the vast body of data, there is still no consensus on their function or functions.\n\nPit hearth features are omnipresent on the coversand area in the Netherlands and bordering regions, especially the northern part of the Netherlands.

It is often assumed, without further presentation of evidence, that ceramic vessels were used for the preparation, storage or consumption of food. Since the 1980s renewed interest in the functional aspects of vessels has encouraged specialists from different fields to pay more attention to organic residues found in association with ceramics. It is extremely challenging to determine actual prehistoric vessel use, to find out what mixtures of edible materials people prepared in ceramics, what pots they used for what kind of foods, or whether they used the same pots for the same foods all the time. Recently, botanists and chemists have started to join forces in order to identifying remaining traces of the original vessel contents preserved after thousands of years of burial. It was exactly this kind of combined botanical and chemical organic residue analysis that was performed on Zeewijk ceramics in order to identify what foods or non-foods were prepared in the vessels found at this site. Each discipline used its own highly sensitive technique to identify informative characteristics in the remaining crusts. Archaeobotanical analysis combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) facilitated the study of anatomical features of very small fragments of plant tissues preserved in organic residues. Chemical analysis using direct temperature- resolved mass spectrometry (DTMS) enabled the identification of a wide range of chemical components (e.g. lipids, proteins, polysaccharides, plant waxes) in the residues. By combining the two disciplines it was possible to obtain an insight into the Neolithic food preparation methods practised at Zeewijk. Such a combined analysis had been successfully applied earlier to a number of pottery assemblages from various archaeological sites,298 including two other sites from the Single Grave Culture (Keinsmerbrug and Mienakker).299 The combined archaeobotanical and chemical approach aims to afford a more detailed insight into the practices of food preparation and cooking in the Single Grave Culture in general, and into the subsistence at Zeewijk in particular.\n\nThis article presents the results of an extensive coring programme and a test excavation at Wetsingermaar (province of Groningen, the Netherlands). The corings made clear that the archaeological site spans over 1.5 ha and is located on the waterfront of a submerged Pleistocene ridge. The test excavation yielded ceramics, flints and other stone amterial, and archaeozoological remains On the basis of its cultural remains it is concluded that Wetsingermaar constitutes an early site of the Funnel Beaker Culture (Trichterbecherkultur, TRB), predating the Horizon 1 of Drouwen TRB as defined by Brindley (1988b). This early phase is termed pre-Drouwen TRB (cf. Bakker, 1979: 115). The flint industry is similar to younger TRB assemblages, while the ceramic and archaeozoological evidence is difficult to interpret as a result of the fragmentary condition of the finds and the near absence of contemporaneous sites.\n\nOrganic residues attached to ceramic vessels were studied to find out what foods and non- foods were originally prepared at Mienakker. In order to identify the origin of these organic residues two disciplines were employed, each using its own highly sensitive technique. Archaeobotanical analysis combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) facilitated the study of anatomical features of very small fragments of plant tissue preserved in organic residues. Chemical analysis using direct- temperature mass spectrometry (DTMS) was able to trace organic components such as proteins, polysaccharides and fats. The two disciplines were combined in order to obtain a broad range of information on the original vessel content and the Neolithic food preparation methods practised at Mienakker. This combined analysis has been successfully applied to a number of pottery assemblages from various archaeological sites. This approach has resulted in new insights into the practices of food preparation and cooking in the Single Grave Culture in general and into site economies at Mienakker in specific."
