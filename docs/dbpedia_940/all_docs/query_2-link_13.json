        "text": "As some of you may know, I am involved into a photography project. During the construction of a new office building for the Gemeente Groningen, a colleague and myself were asked to document the process.\n\nStimulated by your great night shots, I took my tripod and shot a series in the (very) early morning. At LOW ISO's for the best image quality.\n\nThe photo's in this series are copyrighted by myself, but also by the Gemeente Groningen and BAM. These 2 parties kindly allowed me the publication of this series.\n\nNikon D700 + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM\n\nNieuwbouw gemeente Groningen - Harm Buiterplein - Europapark - Groningen\n\nEvery now and then, it's time for me to stop playing around with cameras, lenses, and colour issues, and start making some real shots.\n\nSo. last Thursday I visited \"my\" construction site. Much has changed, since I visited it, 2 months ago. The exterior and surroundings are now complete. 95% of the fencing has been removed. For the finishing touch, the exterior is being cleaned...\n\nInside, the last phase of construction, and now, even decorating, like carpeting, installing the bases for the trees (!!), and waxing floors, is finally underway.\n\nNikon D700 + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM\n\nImportant Notice:\n\nThis image is copyrighted by myself, the gemeente Groningen and by BAM Utiliteitsbouw. NO copying allowed!!!\n\nBelow the new office building there is also a parking garage. Commercially run, so it's not a private garage for the workers... They are encouraged to come by bicycle. In this huge garage there are only 2 spaces for invalids... Not so much really, especially when one realises that there are quite a few disabled people working here (grunt)...\n\nNikon D2Xs + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM. Flash: Metz 45 CL-4 on A-mode\n\nThis is a so called mini-conference corner. If colleagues need to speak together, and do not want to disturb others, they can move in to one of these. The walls are sound dampening, and the table hides power and various computer connections...\n\nWith the Metz 45 CL-4, shooting all kinds of interiors is great fun.\n\nHere more Gispen office furniture.\n\nMost (Dutch) people do not realise they actually are very well acquainted with this brand, probably almost everyone has something from them either in their house, or in the office!!\n\nIn these photo's the combination of flash light and various colours of other light is especially apparent.\n\nI could argue that this zoom lens is the only one I REALLY need...\n\nIt is so incredibly versatile, and when I bought it, I remember I was thinking how much I would actually start using it...\n\nNikon D700 (200ISO) + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM + Metz 45 CL-4 in Auto aperture-mode.\n\nA while ago I introduced an old flash unit to you all, a Metz 45 CL-4. Remember?\n\nI used it begin november, on an assignment shooting interior details. These are various office furniture from the famous Dutch design factory called Gispen.\n\nMost Dutch people do not realise they actually are very well acquainted with this brand, probably almost everyone has something from them either in their house, or in the office!!\n\nIn this new building there are many light colours. The yellowish Led/TL lights and the greenish cast from the insulated windows. And the blues from the atrium, add to my craziness, when trying to balance the light colour.... Always difficult to work in, this building.\n\nBut with the great power of the Metz, it was easy to bounce and diffuse the flash light, so it would become the main light. The ambient light still remains visible for decorative and supportive purposes, I found working with this Metz unit awesome, and I wish I had done this much sooner!!\n\nNikon D700 (200ISO) + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM + Metz 45 CL-4 in Auto aperture-mode.\n\nEvery now and then I get the possibility to show some of my work in the project of shooting the construction of the new SoZaWe- building. This is the situation at May 7th 2013.\n\nSee the others: www.flickr.com/photos/pwsonline/sets/72157632293738519/\n\nAs you can see the exterior is almost completed, but there is still much work to do on the inside...\n\nImportant Notice: This image is copyrighted by myself, the gemeente Groningen and by BAM Utiliteitsbouw. NO copying allowed!!!\n\nNikon D700 + Sigma EX 12-24mm (at 200ISO)\n\nNEW: I converted this RAW-image with Colorperfect's PerfectRAW. imho the colour-quality of this conversion is awesome. The shots even come out sharper, with NO sharpening applied!\n\nFor what I can see, and what I have been told, security is taken VERY seriously!\n\nA lot of security features are in place for the workers, like fencing, markings, access stairs, and of course, abundant lighting, for which the photographer is very thankful!\n\nThe building offers two atrium's. This one will become a pubic area.\n\nNikon D700 (10 second exp.) + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM (at 12mm)\n\nNieuwbouw gemeente Groningen - Harm Buiterplein - Europapark - Groningen\n\nThe interior of the building has 2 so called \"atrium's\". In these atrium's , real trees will be planted! Here you see the steel reinforcing structure, on which the trees will be placed. This will be filled with earth and other plants.\n\nThis is not only for decoration, the \"greens\" have an active task keeping the inside climate healthy and stable. So, when the trees arrive, you might say, they will be the first \"employees\" working here!!\n\nNikon D2Xs (400ISO) + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM\n\nActually, this WAS a nice opportunity to have my D2Xs do some real work for a change. It performed great...\n\nImportant Notice:\n\nThis image is copyrighted by myself, the gemeente Groningen and by BAM Utiliteitsbouw. NO copying allowed!!!\n\nThis morning, my photo-colleague Harry rushed up to me, with the morning newspaper in his hands. Look! he cried, we're in it!\n\nI didn't believe it at first, I thought he was trying a prank on me, but to my surprise there was this large collage, made from photo's we made during our photo project.\n\nAND, we're mentioned too, so no problems about stealing shots!\n\nHarry made this final shot with his smartphone, thanks Harry, we had great fun didn't we?!!!\n\nHaving actual access makes it possible to take interior shots. These various light colours come to life through the camera sensor. Our eyes only \"see\" cold white light. At the right you can see the basis of the high Liebherr tower crane...\n\nThis lens really is a dream for me, very versatile for all kinds of subjects, I can take shots which were otherwise impossible to take.\n\nNikon D700 + Sigma 12-24mm EX DG HSM (at 12mm)\n\nRight next to the new railway station (Groningen-Europapark) and the new office building of SoZaWe-Groningen, a new square is being created. Harm Buiter became Mayor of Groningen, and stepped down 14 years later. He died on February the 22nd 2011.\n\nIn the distance you can see the \"Euroborg\", the soccer stadium..\n\nBronica ETRS-I + Zenzanon 40mm F4 PE\n\nFilmdata:\n\nFujichrome Provia 100F scanned with Vuescan on Epson Perfection 4990.\n\nI always love slide film, especially on medium format. So, I was pretty disappointed when Kodak stopped making Ektachrome! I think, Fujifilm comes pretty close...\n\nA while ago I introduced an old flash unit to you all, a Metz 45 CL-4.
