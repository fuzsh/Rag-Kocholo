        "text": "Derek Fisher believes in himself. He has almost unfailing self-confidence. That has served him well — players don’t hit all the clutch shots Fisher has over his career without it. That confidence is one of the reasons Kobe trusts him.\n\nThat confidence also can mean a failure to recognize trouble.\n\nAnd right now Derek Fisher gets in a lot of trouble. Lakers fans are taking off the rose-colored glasses they view Fisher through and see he has lost a step on defense — even from last year — and regularly gets burned by opposing point guards. On offense, his shot has deserted him, he is hitting just 37.8 percent of his attempts, down from 42.4 percent the year before and 43.6 percent the year before that. His three-point shooting is down to 34.6 percent, from 39.7 percent last year.\n\nIt’s a problem, and it’s a problem Phil Jackson has said he noticed. It’s a problem the Lakers don’t have a good option to fix.\n\nMost fans want Shannon Brown in that role, but for all his spectacular dunks and athleticism, he plays poorly as the lead guard. The Lakers barely run the triangle offense when he is in charge, and he is poor at making passes down to Andrew Bynum or Pau Gasol in the post. Brown is really suited to be a backup for Kobe, not a starting point guard.\n\nJordan Farmar is suited to be a point guard, but is inconsistent. He tends to over-dribble, he also takes the team out of the offense too often, and while he can be brilliant for a night or two, the next game he is pedestrian. Or worse.\n\nFisher, for all his flaws, facilitates the offense properly. He still gets in the right spaces, he makes the right passes. He just can’t shoot or defend like he used to. But because he does those little things, because he has done the big things in the past, Phil Jackson trusts him. His teammates trust him. The fans love him for all he has done in the past.\n\nSports\n\nGet today's sports news out of Los Angeles. Here's the latest on the Dodgers, Lakers, Angels, Kings, Galaxy, LAFC, USC, UCLA and more LA teams.\n\nIn the off-season, the Lakers will have to address the point guard spot. But for the remainder of this season and the playoffs, when it is crunch time at the end of a game, Fisher is almost always on the floor. He will be asked to make the big defensive stops, to hit some big shots.\n\nAnd that could be trouble for the Lakers."
