        "text": "Although Derek Fisher thought about joining that burgeoning superteam in Miami, he’s staying in the Los Angeles Lakers’ own collection of stars.\n\nThe veteran point guard said yesterday he’ll re-sign with the Lakers, sticking with Kobe Bryant and the defending two-time NBA champions after speaking with several teams as a free agent.\n\n“I have decided to continue with Kobe, continue with our teammates and the fans of Los Angeles,” Fisher said in a statement on his website. “While this may not be the most lucrative contract I’ve been offered this offseason, it is the most valuable. I am confident I will continue to lead this team on and off the court. Let the hunt for six begin.”\n\nFisher, a five-time NBA champion, said the idea of joining the Heat was enticing but not enough to uproot his family and career from Los Angeles, where he has spent 11 of his 14 NBA seasons.\n\nThe deal reportedly is for three years, with a player option for the final season.\n\nHaslem feels Heat\n\nUdonis Haslem signed a five-year deal worth around $20 million with the Heat, more than $10 million less than he could have gotten had he accepted offers from the Dallas Mavericks and Denver Nuggets.\n\n“I would be changing my DNA if I left just for money,” Haslem said.\n\nHaslem has been teammates with Dwyane Wade for each of their previous seven NBA seasons, and Wade wanted that relationship to continue. When Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh agreed to new deals last week, each took slightly less money to allow Miami room to get other players.\n\nHaslem has averaged 10.0 points and 8.1 rebounds in his seven seasons with the Heat. . . .\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs signed center Tiago Splitter, three years after drafting the reigning Spanish League MVP.\n\nMagic get Rich\n\nFree agent wing Quentin Richardson and the Orlando Magic reportedly agreed to a multiyear contract.\n\nRichardson averaged 8.9 points and 4.9 rebounds per game starting at small forward last season for Miami.\n\nThe signing means the Magic likely will part ways with free agent small forward Matt Barnes. . . .\n\nIndiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert won’t need surgery after injuring his right knee while training with the Jamaican national team in the Dominican Republic. . . .\n\nIndianapolis officials and the Pacers agreed a deal under which the team will stay at Conseco Fieldhouse the next three seasons while the city pays $10 million a year for running the arena.\n\nHere’s the deal\n\nCharlotte Bobcats center Tyson Chandler was informed by his agent that he’s being traded to the Raptors amid a report Toronto is also poised to send Hedo Turkoglu to Phoenix.\n\nThe Toronto Star reported the Suns would get Turkoglu and send guard Leandro Barbosa to the Raptors, then move guard Jose Calderon and forward Reggie Evans to Charlotte for Chandler and forward Boris Diaw."
