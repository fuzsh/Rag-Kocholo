        "text": "Drafted with the No. 24 overall pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, Fisher spent his first eight seasons with the Lakers, winning the first three of his five titles during the clubâs â3-peatâ run. He later returned in 2007, and won two more back-to-back in 2009 and 2010. One particular moment for Fisher that stands out in Lakers history is his buzzer beater with 0.4 seconds in Game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nCareer"
