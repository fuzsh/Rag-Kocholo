        "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder have re-signed point guard Derek Fisher, the organization confirmed Monday morning.\n\nFisher will take over the third point guard void left by Eric Maynor, whom the organization dealt at the trade deadline on Thursday. Fisher will be under contract with the Thunder for the remainder of the 2012-13 season.\n\nFisher played a key role off the bench for Oklahoma City last season, aiding a deep playoff run to the NBA Finals against Miami.\n\nHe played in nine games this season with the Dallas Mavericks prior to requesting a release in December after suffering a knee injury. He cited wanting to return home to Los Angeles to be with his family as the reason for his departure.\n\nFisher, 38, averaged 8.6 points and 3.6 assists in just over 25 minutes per game in his short stint in Dallas.\n\nFisher, a 17-year NBA veteran, played in 20 games last year for OKC, averaging 4.9 points on 34 percent shooting, including 31 percent from 3-point range, in just over 20 minutes per game.\n\nHowever, Fisher was at his best during the Thunder's postseason run where he averaged 6.3 points on 42 percent shooting and 38 percent from 3 in 20 playoff contests.\n\nFisher played his college ball at Arkansas-Little Rock and was a five-time NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers."
