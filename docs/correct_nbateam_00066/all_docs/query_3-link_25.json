        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA natural leader on and off the court. Played superb man-to-man defense and was a clutch outside shooter. Limited turnovers and generally executed on offense (especially on free throws). A savvy veteran who did what it took to win in the playoffs. A winner. Wasn't a top-tier distributor for a point guard and played more of a shooting guard's game despite his undersized frame. While highly clutch he wasn't quite as dependable a perimeter shooter when things weren't high-pressure. Was never much of a rebounder."
