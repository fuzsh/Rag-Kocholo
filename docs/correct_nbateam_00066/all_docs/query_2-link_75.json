        "text": "Crespi High announced Monday that it has hired former Lakers guard Derek Fisher to be the head coach of its boys basketball team.\n\nFisher, 48, was a key player on five Lakers teams that won NBA championships and his NBA playing career spanned 18 years.\n\nHe has also been an NBA head coach, for the New York Knicks (2014-16), and served as the head coach and general manager for the WNBA’s Sparks (2019-22).\n\n“My family and I are thankful and grateful for this opportunity to join the Crespi Family,” Fisher said in a statement issued by the school. “We want to thank Dr. Kenneth Foersch, Dr. Liam Joyce and Athletic Director Brian Bilek for their professionalism and collaboration. Coaching and teaching is a true passion and I look forward to continuing this focus on the next generation of young student-athletes. Go Crespi!!”\n\nCrespi announced June 26 that it was beginning a search for a new coach to replace Andrew Moore, who resigned after four seasons. Crespi went 18-12 overall and 1-6 in the powerhouse Mission League last season.\n\nIn Monday’s announcement, the school said: “We are honored and excited to welcome Coach Fisher to the Crespi Family. Coach Fisher brings to Crespi his strong work ethic, leadership and discipline that are footed in his Christian faith. … Crespi Basketball now prepares to boldly enter a new era under Coach Fisher’s leadership with a program poised to continue its tradition of excellence.”"
