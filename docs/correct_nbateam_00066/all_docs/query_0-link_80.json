        "text": "After providing the voice of calm and reason spanning 18 years, five NBA championships and countless clutch shots and speeches, Derek Fisher said he is not ready to jump into the coaching ranks just yet.\n\nBut the reasons have nothing to do with his lack of head-coaching experience or believing he is not fit for a job. With the Oklahoma City Thunder losing in six games to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals, Fisher will have to mull whether this marks the end of an 18-year NBA career. Fisher will also evaluate head-coaching possibilites with the Lakers and New York Knicks, two intriguing possibilities given both his close ties with Lakers guard Kobe Bryant and Knicks president and former Lakers coach Phil Jackson.\n\n“There is for sure huge layers added to the personal relationship and professional relationship I’ve had with Phil Jackson over the years and also with the Lakers having an opening,” Fisher said. “Just like any important decision in life, you can’t necessarily be driven completely by going on what’s happening externally. You have to have an internal set of boundaries and a compass that you make decisions by.”\n\nThe Lakers have not yet reached out to the Thunder to seek permission to interview Fisher, according to league sources familiar with the situation. Any NBA team will have to do that since Fisher remains under contract with Oklahoma City through June 30.\n\nThe Lakers spent the past two weeks interviewing a flurry of candidates to fill their vacant head-coaching position. The candidates have proved wide-ranging, including those familiar with the Lakers (Byron Scott, Kurt Rambis, Mike Dunleavy) and ones with vast head-coaching experience (Lionel Hollins, Alvin Gentry).\n\nLakers general manager Mitch Kupchak also had an informal phone discussion with former Denver Nuggets coach George Karl, according to a leageu source familiar with the situation.\n\nThough the Lakers are leaning toward hiring a coach with experience, they still remain open-minded and plan to interview more candidates before finalizing their search. The Lakers may have to move quickly on Fisher since Jackson has publicly touted him as a candidate. Subsequently, the NBA slapped Jackson with a $25,000 fine on Monday for tampering since league rules prohibit team officials from publicly talking about an opposing team’s player.\n\n“I’ve been blessed and gifted enough to able to positively impact other people,” Fisher said. “Coaching allows for you to positively impact other people’s lives and to help a group of people find success. You’re all working together for a common goal.”"
