        "text": "All in all, there were some positives to take out of the day for the NBPA. One of the strongest voices in the meeting was that of LeBron James, the league’s biggest star. There was, top to bottom, a sense that players in the room needed to be more involved in their union, and give the job to someone on whom they will keep regular tabs, someone won’t deal in the shadows the way Hunter did, someone who won’t create and hide behind internal strife as a means of self-protection. “We will no longer be divided, misled and misinformed,” Fisher said. “This is our union. We’re taking it back.” Unfortunately, though, they won’t be taking it back without a fight. “I do not consider today’s vote the end,” Hunter said, “only a different beginning.”\n\nAlso of serious concern is “purported agreement between the NBPA and Prim Capital,” according to Paul, Weiss. Prim Capital is the firm that employs Hunter’s son, Todd, and had a business relationship with the NBPA at $602,000 a year. “For example, we were informed repeatedly by Union employees over the course of the investigation that the 2005 Agreement was the NBPA’s most recent contract with Prim,” the report stated. “Theresa Messer reported that although she had raised with Prim the need for a written contract on multiple occasions and had been told that one would be prepared, she never received a new agreement. When asked about this document, Messer and Shelia Thompson, the members of the Finance Department responsible for managing the Union’s relationship with Prim, reported that they had never seen it and had not known that it existed."
