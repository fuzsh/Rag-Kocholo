        "text": "Los Angeles is confident that Redick will be the long-term coaching solution that has eluded the franchise for over a decade. … But the 39-year-old Redick checks many of the boxes on the Lakers’ extensive checklist for their next coach. He’s drawn internal comparisons to a young Pat Riley as a coaching prospect who jumped from playing to the broadcast booth to the coaching chair. Los Angeles is confident he can be their version of Erik Spoelstra or Steve Kerr – a culture-setter who can grow with the franchise for over a decade. There have been far more former-player, first-time head coaches who failed to meet expectations than those who succeeded, though, with the most recent examples including Steve Nash (Brooklyn), Derek Fisher (Knicks), Jason Kidd (Brooklyn) and Ham.\n\nFisher won five NBA Championships with the Lakers and was the starting point guard on that 2001 team and he recently appeared on the Draymond Green Show. Fisher was a bit more reasonable in his argument with Green but still made his points: The best point Fisher made in regards to a series between the Lakers and Warriors is which set of rules would this hypothetical meeting be played under. Teams could be a lot more physical in the early 2000s and as Fisher noted, if he is able to grab and bang on Curry without being called for a bunch of fouls it makes a huge difference. And the same can be said if the more current rules were in place which would allow Curry, Durant and Thompson to run around more freely.\n\nDerek Fisher: Shaq literally has changed people’s dinner work bro. No double team, no triple team, anything could stop him. When you talk about the greatest teams ever, it’s got to be a coin toss and it probably would depend on who has home court, and it depends on what rules are we playing. If we play the way I play defense we might have a chance cuz I’m beating Stephen Curry up.\n\nFisher, who is in Manila for an NBA-initiated coaching clinic, recalled a talk he had with Kobe and his former teammate’s meaningful message that really resonated with him. “We were talking about family, kids, and life, [and] he said something that struck me and altered my perspective on decision-making around what you want to get out of life, personally and professionally,” Fisher told BasketNews.com. “He said there was a point in his life where he started thinking about for every decision that he made, the consideration he had to make was how is this going to impact my daughters 20 years from now.”\n\nLook, you gotta get to the point as a coach where you trust every single person that you have on the floor. If you go back and look at what Robert Horry did for so many teams. Kobe and Shaq, think about the big shot that Robert Horry hit against the Sacramento Kings. Role players have stepped up tremendously in the playoffs when it came down to winning games. Derek Fisher, we saw the shot in the series against the San Antonio Spurs. I think it’s the trust factor that the coach has to have and the others along with your superstars or the franchise guys have trust in those players as well."
