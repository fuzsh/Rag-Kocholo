        "text": "It was initially believed Derek Fisher would have to wait a calendar year before signing with the Los Angeles Lakers after the team traded him last March, but as Marc Stein reports, the free agent point guard is able to sign with his longtime team whenever -- and interest in him doing so is mutual.\n\nThe 38-year-old seemed not to have much left in the tank when the Lakers traded him last year, a move which apparently caused a rift between the guard who has won five titles with Los Angeles and the team's management. However, he appeared rejuvenated and played an important role in the Oklahoma City Thunder's playoff run to the finals, proving he still has something left. Stein reports that the Lakers may opt to move point guards Steve Blake or Chris Duhon to make room on the roster and payroll for Fisher, who isn't ready to retire."
