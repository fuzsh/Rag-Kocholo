        "text": "After 18 seasons as an NBA player, two seasons as the Knicks coach and four seasons as the coach of the WNBA’s Sparks, Derek Fisher will be taking on a new role: high school boys basketball coach.\n\nFisher will take the coaching position at Crespi Carmelite High School in Los Angeles, KABC reported this week. The all-boys private school basketball team has won two state championships.\n\n“Coaching and teaching is a true passion and I look forward to continuing this focus on the next generation of young student-athletes. Go Crespi!!” Fisher said, via a statement from the school.\n\nThis won’t be Fisher’s first time coaching a boy’s basketball team as he worked with an eighth grade team last year.\n\nThe majority of Fisher’s career was played with the Lakers, where he won five NBA titles. He retired as a player following the 2013–14 season with the Thunder.\n\nFisher went on to coach the Knicks for less than two seasons from 2014 to ’16 before he was fired in Feb. 2016. New York finished with a 40–96 record during his tenure and finished last in the Eastern Conference during his first year with the franchise.\n\nAfter a few years off, Fisher began leading the Sparks from 2019 until part way through the 2022 season. The team went 54–46 in that span."
