        "text": "Game day at Staples Center is an atmosphere unlike any other. An atmosphere where competition and entertainment are both palpable. An atmosphere that Derek Fisher is quite familiar with.\n\nFisher laced up his sneakers for 435 home games at Staples as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers. He made the march through the visitor’s tunnel another 40 times, either to face the Lakers or the Clippers. And he prowled the iconic sidelines twice as head coach of the New York Knicks.\n\nAnd in a few months, a new journey will begin for the five-time NBA champion — a journey that caught the bulk of the basketball world off guard. On May 31, Fisher will once again leave the locker room and stride toward the purple and gold-adorned hardwood of Staples Center, this time as coach of the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nThe Sparks have been a pillar of success, accumulating a 71-31 record over the last three years that featured two trips to the WNBA Finals and a third trophy added to their cabinet. Yet despite that, they enter the 2019 season with more question than answers.\n\nAfter the surprising resignation of coach Brian Agler, the second-winningest coach in WNBA history, the Sparks took an unorthodox route and hired Fisher. The Lakers legend may be a hero at Staples, but he has zero WNBA experience. And his entire coaching resume is a brief stint with the Knicks in which he accrued a 40-96 record. The hiring did nothing to quell the list of questions facing the franchise, and it will remain that way until the season is under way.\n\nBut absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Just because the Sparks questions are unanswered doesn’t mean the answers, when uncovered, are bad.\n\nAs a new season gets underway — free agency began on Feb. 1 — here are the five biggest questions posed to Staples Center’s summer squad.\n\nCan Derek Fisher modernize the offense?\n\nThe Phil Jackson disciple won’t be revitalizing the triangle in Los Angeles, but he has a chance to modernize an offense that underperformed a year ago. The Sparks rode their second-rated defense to the playoffs, but the offense struggled its way to eighth in the 12-team league.\n\nChief among the culprits was antiquated shot selection. Despite employing capable shooters, the Sparks were 10th in the WNBA in frequency of 3-point attempts and second in frequency of long twos. They were elite when in transition but hesitant to push that part of their game.\n\nFisher’s biggest task is to increase the offense’s efficacy, in large part by modernizing the style and rotations and allowing the elite defense to set the table on the other end of the court.\n\n“Being able to play big, being able to play smaller groups at times, being able to be really versatile on the offensive end in terms of being able to attack teams,” Fisher told The Athletic about what stands out on the roster. “But also having players that are willing to really sit down and defend and do that at a high level. The defensive rating for the team has been really good over the last couple years, and I think we can build on that and have that be an end of the floor that we kind of anchor ourselves around, and then continue to show our versatility on offense.”\n\nModernizing a stagnant offense, especially one replete with veterans, is no easy task. For Fisher, it transcends what is drawn on a coach’s clipboard.\n\n“I think if you’re committed and willing to sacrifice, and you develop discipline and attention to detail, then you’re willing to make sure that our spacing is great and that we’re not crowding each other and giving the ball an opportunity to move, and players are moving,” Fisher told The Athletic. “Those things become the byproduct of your commitment to the big picture. Our identity, for me, is going to start with those things and then that will kind of help influence what we decide to do on the court based on what our final roster ends up looking like, and what we’re actually capable of doing.”\n\nWhile Fisher’s coaching record may be slim and grim, he has spent the last few years observing basketball trends and watching the rapid evolution of offense. If he can implement modern offensive tenets in his new gig, the Sparks have a chance to return to the WNBA’s hierarchy.\n\nCan they win the Liz Cambage sweepstakes?\n\nThe Lakers aren’t the only basketball team in L.A. making a run at a superstar center. In mid-January, 6-foot-9 center Liz Cambage, the 2018 MVP runner-up, requested a trade from the Dallas Wings. According to a report from WNBA Insidr’s Rachel Galligan, two teams are in the running for Cambage’s services: the Las Vegas Aces and the Sparks.\n\nLos Angeles would likely be unwilling to move MVPs Candace Parker and Nneka Ogwumike, or budding star (and restricted free agent) Chelsea Gray. That means a trade package would likely be centered around 20-year-old big Maria Vadeeva and a collection of draft picks.\n\nThe fit would be interesting, as Parker and Ogwumike have been the team’s starting frontcourt for a long time. Adding a star center to the mix means moving both players down a position. But perhaps this is exactly the versatility that Fisher was referencing, as both players have the lateral quickness to defend on the perimeter and the requisite offensive tool kit to score from the wing. Adding the league’s most physically dominant player would transform an undersized roster that finished 11th in rebounding rate a year ago.\n\nIt’s safe to say the line of communication between Los Angeles and Dallas will be interesting. Shortly after resigning from the Sparks, Agler took the head coaching job with the Wings while Fred Williams — who was fired by Dallas near the end of the 2018 season — joined L.A. as an assistant coach.\n\nWhat happens in free agency?\n\nWhile the Sparks have their core locked up, they enter free agency with a lot of empty roster spots. Parker, Ogwumike, Vadeeva, Jantel Lavender and Sydney Wiese are under contract, and Karlie Samuelson has already re-signed. Somewhat surprisingly, the Sparks matched the three-year max contract that the Phoenix Mercury offered restricted free agent Odyssey Sims, an odd fit due to her lack of a jump shot.\n\nGray remains unsigned, but since she is deserving of a max contract and is restricted, she’ll surely be back. Riquna Williams, Essence Carson and reigning Defensive Player of the Year Alana Beard remain unsigned and unrestricted.\n\nL.A. will need to shore up a bench that struggled last year with spacing, inexperience, and injuries, but two moves will dramatically impact how the Sparks enter the market. First, will they acquire Cambage? And second, can they find a trade partner for Lavender, who is on a maximum contract but relegated to the bench?\n\nOnce they re-sign Gray, the Sparks will have five players on large contracts while trying to acquire a sixth in Cambage. What happens with Cambage and Lavender will determine whether L.A. chases some big-name free agents or has to fill in the gaps with lower-level contracts to stay within the confines of the salary cap.\n\nWhere does Candace Parker go from here?\n\nIf Parker retired today, she would go down as one of the greatest players in WNBA history. But the 32-year-old finished fourth in MVP voting last year and is far from done. She and Fisher have known each other for a long time, and they have spoken about each other with effusive praise since his hiring, with Parker even partaking in her new coach’s introductory press conference.\n\nFisher, of course, knows a thing or two about sharing locker rooms with the sport’s biggest stars, and he doesn’t take for granted the one he gets to coach.\n\n“There’s a feeling about her when she walks in a room or when she’s on the court that’s similar to great players that I’ve played with and/or played against,” Fisher told The Athletic. “Where every night you know that her team has a chance to win because of her greatness and her commitment to being great — but then, in combination with a level of humility that sometimes is challenging to maintain when you’ve been as successful as she has.”\n\nBasketball may be the consummate team sport, but you can only go as far as your best players take you. Where Parker’s game goes from here will go a long way toward determining whether or not the Sparks can continue their status as annual title contenders.\n\nWhat if it doesn’t work?\n\nThe Sparks made the move to hire Fisher the same way they make all their moves: with conviction.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s a safe plan. If Fisher excels, then general manager Penny Toler — who has championed Fisher as a supporter of the Sparks since the team’s inception — looks like a genius for taking the unconventional route. But if the Sparks come out of the gates slowly, Toler will receive heavy criticism for hiring someone with no WNBA experience — and with more than twice as many losses as wins in his coaching career — and not having interviewed any other candidates.\n\nLos Angeles is still brimming with talent and is a desirable location for free agents. But after a disappointing 2018 that ended in a successful coach abruptly resigning, it’s safe to wonder what will happen if 2019 starts off slowly. Will Toler give up on Fisher if he struggles, or will she give up on the players by trading some veterans and retooling? Will she do nothing and risk taking the fall herself?\n\nIf the coming season can’t match the high expectations befitting a league powerhouse, someone will have to answer for it. It’s just unclear who.\n\nTop photo of Derek Fisher and Candace Parker: Juan Ocampo / NBAE via Getty Images"
