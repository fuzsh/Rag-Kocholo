        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers hung a banner for winning the NBA In-Season Tournament but now seem to be paying for it in more ways than one.\n\nOn the court, LeBron and company are 1-4 since beating the Indiana Pacers in the championship on Dec. 9 in Las Vegas. Off the court, the Lakers — a franchise with 17 NBA championships — have been criticized from several sides for hanging the banner.\n\n“I think there's a reason why you wait until the end (of the season) to celebrate a championship,” Derek Fisher, the former Lakers point guard, said on Spectrum SportsNet after the Lakers (15-13) lost for the fourth time in five games, falling 124-108 to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nFormer Lakers great Shaquille O’Neal, who helped put three of the banners in the rafters, said the latest addition wasn’t even a banner, calling it an “ornament” instead.\n\n“This is just an ornament,” he said on TNT. “... It’s not a banner because it doesn't look like the other banners... it’s decoration.”\n\nMeantime, Fisher suggested Lakers coach Darvin Ham needed to change his offense to kick-start his team.\n\n“I think the Lakers have to figure out a way offensively to play with more pace so they can create more easy opportunities for everyone,” he said. “LeBron and AD may miss out on a couple of opportunities playing faster, but it may give more guys a chance to score. You can't put up 108 in today's NBA and win.”\n\nLeBron, who turns 39 next week, went for 25 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists against the Bulls, but admitted there has been a physical and emotional hangover since the In-Season Tournament.\n\n“It’s a combination of everything,” he told reporters. “It’s the emotional fatigue, it’s the physical fatigue, it’s the grind of the season fatigue. When you’re not winning, obviously, it’s the frustration fatigue.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Pacers — who put up 144 points on Wednesday in a win over Charlotte — are 2-4 since the In-Season Tournament.\n\nThings won’t get any easier for the Lakers, either.\n\nTheir next three games are against a trio of the NBA’s top teams in Minnesota, Oklahoma City and Boston on Christmas Day.\n\n“There’s no break coming, no help coming, there’s no cavalry,” Anthony Davis told reporters. “We gotta look in this locker room, we just gotta find a way to get in the win column.”"
