        "text": "After once canning clutch shots, delivering inspired speeches and hustling on every possession, Derek Fisher once again walked onto the Staples Center floor ready to fill that job description.\n\nFisher performed those duties wearing an Oklahoma City Thunder uniform, the team he’s played with ever since the Lakers traded him to Houston two years ago for Jordan Hill in a move that amounted to a salary dump and a way to clear up a bloated backcourt. Well before the Lakers’ 114-110 victory Sunday over the Thunder at Staples Center became official, Fisher received a warm reception once he entered the game with three minutes left in the first quarter. Memories surrounding his five NBA title and countless game-winners apparently remain vivid here.\n\nThe game marked the last time he would play in Staples Center against his former team, assuming Fisher fulfills his vow that he will retire following 18 seasons.\n\nHow he does he reflect on his time with the Lakers?\n\n“I don’t know if I’ll do that now or anytime soon,” said Fisher, who posted eight points on 3-of-7 shooting and three assists in 22 minutes off the bench. “At the end of this season or later, I’ll be able to reflect more on the totality of my career overall and not just my time here.\n\n“It’s no doubt we had some great years and accomplished some things that very few teams in the history of this league ever accomplished. It’s a great feeling to know that’s in the bank.”\n\nMany of those memories involve Kobe Bryant, who entered the NBA in 1996 with Fisher and has considered him his favorite teammate. Fisher suggested similar sentiments.\n\n“Kobe by far is my favorite teammate from a basketball perspective in terms of what we were able to accomplish,” Fisher said. “But it would be a disservice to guys like Devean George, Luke Walton, Horace Grant and guys I got close to over the years in terms of being friends to automatically put Kobe at the top of that list. But we definitely shared some special years and I miss him every day.”\n\nFisher also expressed sympathy for Bryant, who has played in only six games this season amid rehabbing his left Achilles tendon and then fracturing his left knee. The Lakers will re-evaluate Bryant on Friday, but Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni recently said it’s possible he won’t return this season.\n\n“It’s very personal to me, especially with how I know how hard he works to be at his best,” Fisher said. “I have no doubt he’ll back there very soon.”\n\nThunder coach Scott Brooks and forward Kevin Durant spoke about Fisher in similarly reverential terms and gushed about his championship experience, leadership, toughness and work ethic. Fisher has averaged 40.1 percent from three-point range this season, including two consecutive three-pointers that sliced the Lakers’ lead to 102-97 with 4:36 left on Sunday.\n\nThat’s why Durant said he plans to speak with Fisher’s family this offseason about allowing him to delay his retirement.\n\n“I’ll wait until we’re done,” Durant said in hopes he can help deliver Fisher’s sixth NBA title. “I’ll let him enjoy these last few months.\n\n“After that, I’m going to do some negotiating.”\n\nFisher laughed when informed of Durant’s plan. Will it work?\n\n“I don’t know,” Fisher said, grinning. “We got some unfinished business before we worry about that.”"
