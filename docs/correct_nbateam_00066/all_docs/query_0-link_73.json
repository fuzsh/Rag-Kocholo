        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers that dominated the NBA with five championships between 2000 and 2010 were led by superstars like Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant - and Derek Fisher is another name synonymous with purple and gold success.\n\nFisher, a first round pick out of the 1996 NBA Draft, was a reliable point guard whose effective and incredibly clutch sharpshooting ability meant he was ultimately involved in several crucial moments. He struck an iconic jumpshot buzzer beater against the rival San Antonio Spurs in a tight Game 5 back in 2004 as well as three to tie Game 4 of the 2009 NBA Finals versus the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe 48-year-old won five NBA championships across his career, winning the three-peat under head coach Phil Jackson alongside O’Neal and Bryant before retuning to Los Angeles in 2007. He then added two more rings as Bryant and new running mate Pau Gasol ensured the Lakers returned to championship glory.\n\nWhen asked about Bryant, the respect Fisher has for the late icon is clear. They both entered the NBA as members of the Lakers in 1996, playing together for 13 seasons with their on-court fate intertwined. Fisher wouldn’t change a thing and heralded Bryant’s dedication to success in basketball.\n\n“They say ‘iron sharpens iron’ and all these different phrases, but it was a gift,” Fisher exclusively told Mirror Sport. “It was such a gift to be surrounded by so much greatness - it forces you to raise your level.\n\n“That’s what it was like to be teammates with Kobe and around him for like 275 days a year! To see him on basically a daily basis and observe the way his mind saw the game of basketball as well as the dedication to his craft inspired me. I think it inspired a lot of our teammates and it was absolutely one of the major reasons we were so successful.\n\n“It highlights the importance of having someone, no matter if it’s a company or a family or a team, who can dictate the group with their approach or mindset. Kobe represented that.”\n\nFisher was the starting guard when O’Neal and Bryant dominated the NBA and the Lakers became the fifth and last time a team won three successive championships, immortalising themselves alongside the great Chicago Bulls teams led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Bryant retired with five rings to his name - one shy of Jordan record - as well as an MVP award and 18 nominations to the All-Star Game.\n\nAt the time, Fisher was somewhat unaware of what Bryant and the 2000s Lakers were achieving in the grand scheme of NBA history. He admitted the weight of their success became apparent after the win over Dwight Howard’s Magic; the fourth title in the decade following seven years without reaching the top of the mountain.\n\n“When we won our fourth championship against Orlando in 2009, that was when it started to register how special we were becoming as a group,” Fisher revealed. “We also collectively realised what [Kobe Bryant] was accomplishing in terms of his legacy and career - and I was a part of that.\n\n“We did the three-peat in the early 2000s then lost to the Pistons, and the team broke up for a bit. We got back together but lost to the Celtics in 2008, so there were plenty of question marks over whether we were going to reach that level of significance in terms of winning more championships and achieving more success. After winning the title in 2009, it registered we were doing something very special that not many others could or were able to do.”\n\nFisher is something of a cult hero in Los Angeles given his success achieved on the court with the Lakers paired with his service as head coach of the WNBA’s LA Sparks. He became renowned for his effective shooting in clutch moments - so which of the two incredible plays against the Spurs and Magic is his favourite?\n\n“It’s got to be against the Orlando Magic in 2009,” Fisher said with a beaming smile across his face. “Anything that led to us winning the championship takes more significance over anything else.\n\n“I love the 2004 moment with 0.4 seconds left in a huge game between two historic franchises like the Lakers and Spurs - the championship basically went through either Los Angeles or San Antonio for a really long time.\n\n“But it has to be Orlando. It led to the championship, so I would take that shot over the other each and every time.”\n\nWatch five NBA Christmas Day Games live on Sky Sports and NBA League Pass from 5pm UK time on Sunday 25 th December. Los Angeles Lakers @ Dallas Mavericks from 7:30pm is part of the NBA’s ‘NBA Sundays presented by NBA2K23’ Primetime initiative."
