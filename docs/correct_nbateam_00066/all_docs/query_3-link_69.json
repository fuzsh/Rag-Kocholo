        "text": "In recent news, Phil Jackson has officially hired Derek Fisher to be the new head coach of the New York Knickbockers aka New York Knicks. Take in mind, Derek has never coached a team before on any level, but he has been known as a player to be a great leader on the floor. And, it's been reported on ESPN that many of the inspirational speeches that phil used to make for the lakers were actually conspired by Derek Fisher.\n\nAlso keep in mind, that it's been reported the Phil Jackson is going to be very hands on with the team at the beginning, in order to implement the triangle offense.\n\nTherefore, do you think this was a good hiring move by Phil? Do you think Carmelo Anthony should stay with the Knicks now? Or do you think he should go elsewhere? What are your thoughts on this situation?\n\nPhil Jackson aka \"Obie Wan\" will be able to mentor his protege'/ Jedi Knight Derek Fisher. Fish knows what it takes to be successful and a winner in this league. Jackson coached and played in big market cities. He will help mentor D Fish on how to handle the media and the big ego's as he did with MJ, Pippen, Rodman, Shaq, and Kobe. I think NY will see the fruits of this move in 3 years. Knick fans should be patient."
