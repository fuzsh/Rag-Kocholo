        "text": "Derek Fisher won five NBA titles, all with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nNow at 44, he's in his first season coaching the WNBA Los Angeles Sparks, who won the league title in 2016 and were runners-up in 2017 in a pair of highly competitive five-game series vs. Minnesota.\n\nBrian Agler coached the Sparks from 2015-18, resigned in November and now is coaching the Dallas Wings. That led to the hiring of Fisher, who was a head coach in the NBA with the New York Knicks from 2014 until being fired in February 2016.\n\nFisher is the third Sparks coach with NBA playing credentials. Others were Orlando Woolridge (1999) and Michael Cooper (2000-04, 2007-09).\n\nFisher's hiring has been scrutinized and criticized by some for a variety of reasons. He's inherited a team that includes two-time WNBA most valuable player Candace Parker and 2016 league MVP Nneka Ogwumike. And through the WNBA draft and via subsequent trades, the Sparks have added 6-7 Kalani Brown from NCAA champion Baylor, 6-4 Chiney Ogwumike (from Connecticut) and guard Alexis Jones (Minnesota).\n\nThat level of talent puts pressure on Fisher to win immediately. He talked about his new job before last week's preseason game in Phoenix.\n\nOn making the move into the WNBA\n\nFisher: \"I’ve been a fan for a long time. I’ve been to a lot of games. From the outside looking in, it’s always been enjoyable. It’s always been a great product. But now on the inside of it, there’s a greater appreciation for the passion that every single person in the WNBA has for women, women’s basketball. You’re not in this for any other reason but the passion and the love for the game. It’s been great to feel that energy.\n\n\"The players, the coaches, the staff, everybody that makes this go, the resources are not the same as in most major professional sports. People are not doing this for the money. They’re doing it because they love to do it. And it’s great to be around literally every person from top to bottom in the organization that just cares about trying to help the players be successful.\"\n\nOn lack of respect by some for the WNBA's improvement over 22 seasons\n\nFisher: \"Some of it is we’ve been conditioned that way as a society for decades. That this was an inferior product, it wasn’t as quality as the men’s game, etc. But you talk to anybody that’s ever been to a game, they feel different. We just have to keep talking about it, keep promoting it, but also make sure we’re doing everything we can internally to make sure it’s the best product in the world. We have to invest in developing our players. We have to make sure we’re putting them in position to be the best basketball players in the world. They’re a lot that goes into that.\"\n\nIs his NBA background a plus in some ways?\n\nFisher: \"I hope so. I hope I can be helpful, insightful, share wisdom, experience, thoughts with our general manager on how we can help our players internally then league-wide if I’m ever needed or asked for thoughts and where I’ve been and the way it would be great to really elevate this game. That’s a big part of why I’m here as well.\"\n\nWhat have you learned so far about your team?\n\nFisher: \"The leadership and accountability that these women possess and carry on a daily basis is inspiring. They don’t take days off. Literally every day we’re in the gym. They’re asking as much as they can of themselves, and they hold their teammates accountable. They’re not afraid to communicate and say what they feel and express it. Sometimes in sports it’s difficult to live in truth like that. But our team so far has shown the ability to communicate with each other, be constructively critical then try to get better after things that need to be said.\"\n\nOn Sparks' moves to upgrade their roster\n\nFisher: \"We had a group that went to the finals two out of the last three seasons before the draft and before adding Chiney. We’re fortunate to be able to add that much front court depth. This is not an easy league. You can’t start slow. You can’t finish slow. To have depth is a really valuable thing. Hopefully it will allow to play really hard every night. If we do that, we should have a chance to win.\n\n\"Alexis, Kalani they both played at Baylor. They’re been coached really well. Kalani won a championship. She knows what it feels like to be around great players and play on a team. Chiney is an All-Star. She’s a great person and she’s already been willing to do whatever ask of her. We’re lucky to have all of them.\"\n\nOn the WNBA 34-game season compared to 82 in the NBA\n\nFisher: \"It’s like the post All-Star break for the NBA. To me that makes it really exciting right from the start. When you think about the way people feel about NBA basketball from March through the playoffs, that’s our season. The intensity is always high. The energy and enthusiasm is there right from the beginning. You can’t have a bad month in the WNBA. I think that’s a good thing.\"\n\nMore: Phoenix Mercury general manager says tough roster cuts will require creativity\n\nMore: Truth B.
