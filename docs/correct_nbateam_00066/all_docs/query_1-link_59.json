Perhaps no shot in Lakers history was more celebrated that Fisher’s “0.4” shot in San Antonio eight years ago.\n\nThe Lakers reluctantly traded Fisher to Houston on a day of deals that brought Ramon Sessions to play point guard. It won’t be popular inside certain places in the Lakers locker room, and here are some of the reasons why."
