        "text": "Derek Fisher hasn’t played an NBA game since 2014, when he logged 32 minutes in the Thunder’s elimination loss to the Spurs in the 2014 Western Conference Finals.\n\nIn the two years that have passed since that game, he was hired by the Knicks to be their head coach, got in an incident with Matt Barnes, and later was fired by the Knicks after a disappointing run in New York. Now, it looks like he might be open to giving it one more shot as a player, based on a report from Ian Begley of ESPN:\n\nSources told ESPN on Wednesday that Fisher has indeed been \"exploring options and expressing interest in playing again.\"\n\nIt is unclear what those options are, but Fisher's return to the NBA as a player after coaching in the league would be a rarity.\n\nFisher also posted a video to Instagram where he looks like he’s putting in the work you’d expect a player to put in if they were trying to get back in the game next season:\n\nIt’s anyone’s guess if a team would seriously be willing to give Fisher (who turns 42 next week) a serious chance at a roster spot next season, but you would have to think if there was a team out there who would be willing to give him a shot, Washington would probably be one of the teams. Consider the following:\n\nAs we already mentioned, Fisher has played under Scott Brooks before. He spent parts of three different seasons in Oklahoma City and played key playoff minutes for them, including their trip to the NBA Finals in 2012.\n\nAs of right now, no one on the Wizards’ roster has experience playing under Scott Brooks. Fisher could help speed along the team’s transition to Brooks’ new schemes on offense and defense.\n\nTechnically, the Wizards only have two point guards on the roster at the moment. Yes, you could technically include Satoransky here, but it’s probably better to view him as a two-guard who can run an offense. With that in mind, it couldn’t hurt to add another small guard for emergency situations.\n\nOf course, we’re getting ahead of ourselves at this point in the game. To be clear, there’s been nothing reported or rumored that would suggest the Wizards have any interest in Derek Fisher, or vice-versa. And if we’re being honest, there are much better ways to fill out the end of the bench than signing a guard in his forties who hasn’t played in two years. That said, if anything happens to bubble up in the coming weeks, there’s at least an argument for why the pairing could make sense, even if Fisher doesn’t add much value on the court next season."
