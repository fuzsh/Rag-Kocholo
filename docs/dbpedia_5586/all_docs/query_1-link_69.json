The rest of the cast are a mix of English, Irish and American, with some attempting a Welsh accent (Arthur Shields' puritanical chapel deacon is perhaps the best example) and others not bothering at all (hello, Walter Pidgeon, who's pastor Mr Gruffyd has come from Cardiff by way of California). In this regard, I much prefer the BBC's 1975",

        "text": "Happy St David's Day to all my Welsh comrades!\n\nWhilst John Ford's trademark epic sweep is easy to distinguish here, it's much harder to spot a genuine Welshman. Indeed, there's only one in the whole cast; Rhys Williams as Dai Bando. The rest of the cast are a mix of English, Irish and American, with some attempting a Welsh accent (Arthur Shields' puritanical chapel deacon is perhaps the best example) and others not bothering at all (hello, Walter Pidgeon, who's pastor Mr Gruffyd has come from Cardiff by way of California). In this regard, I much prefer the BBC's 1975 adaptation, a miniseries which boasts a largely authentic Welsh cast, headed up by Stanley Baker in one of his final roles. But there's another reason why I favour that version too; at 300 minutes, it has the luxury to adapt Richard Llewellyn's novel unabridged, allowing the narrative to run to its proper pace and have the opportunity to breathe.\n\nThat said, Ford's film succeeds specifically in being far less studiobound than the later adaptation and had a marvellous 80-acre recreation of a Welsh mining town built in the Santa Monica mountains. This inauthenticity is a remarkable triumph over the hokey accents and, captured with splendid visuals, makes How Green Was My Valley a great achievement for all its other faults. But beating Citizen Kane at the Oscars? Well that just shows that that the Academy has always loved a bit of sentimentality."
