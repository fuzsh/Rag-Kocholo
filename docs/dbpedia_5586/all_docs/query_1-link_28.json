        "text": "A Note of discord echoes in the Welsh valleys this weekend as one of the nation's most famous literary sons stands exposed as a fraud. He wrote one of the best-loved novels of the twentieth century and created an image of Wales that went around the world.\n\nRichard Llewellyn's How Green Was My Valley was made into an Oscar-winning film, becoming a screen classic that established a stereotype the Welsh have never escaped.\n\nBut the author of the evocative tale of a Welsh mining family was born in England and his real name was Vivian Lloyd. Throughout his life and until his death in 1983, he spun a web of deceit about his background. Unable to attempt a Welsh accent he blamed his clipped English tones on time in the military.\n\nHe claimed to be a miner's son born in St David's who worked down the pits at Gilfach Goch, where his novel was set. In truth he was born in Hendon, London, in 1906, the son of a publican. His first job was washing dishes at Claridges.\n\nHis knowledge of mining came from a family who ran a Charing Cross Road bookshop in London. The three Griffiths sons would regale Llewellyn with stories of their father's experiences in a Welsh pit.\n\nIt was not until How Green Was My Valley made Llewellyn a rich man that he actually spent some time in the country he claimed as his own. He bought a farm in Pembrokeshire but stayed only briefly, spending most of his time at his Claridges' suite, a dishwasher turned VIP guest.\n\nThe fact behind the fiction was uncovered by researchers looking for a way to celebrate this year's sixtieth anniversary of the book.\n\nArwel Ellis Owen, a producer for BBC Wales, discovered a forgotten archive of Llewellyn's papers at the University of Texas in America.\n\n'We discovered that much of what Llewellyn told the world about himself was a load of baloney,' said Owen, who is making a documentary on the fraud.\n\nAlthough acclaimed by critics, literary contemporaries and commentators, How Green Was My Valley perplexed mining communities. They did not wholly recognise themselves in what was supposed to be an authentic tale and the sentimentality brought its own controversy. But they were won over by the novel's enthusiastic reception elsewhere.\n\nNow it is clear Llewellyn, who wanted to call the book The Slag, had no more first-hand experience of mining life than the Americans who made the book a bestseller.\n\nMeic Stephens, creative writing lecturer at the University of Glamorgan, and editor of the Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales, knew Llewellyn.\n\nHe told The Observer Llewellyn's real birth certificate had been found in the Texas archive. 'A lot of us had suspicions and we have been looking into his background for a few years but it was not until we saw the birth certificate that we were sure.\n\n'He was a semi-detached Welshman,' said Stephens generously. 'He sounded very English. Of course, his parents really were Welsh but he spun this myth about himself.\n\n'But How Green Was My Valley is still an abiding classic. From a strictly historical point of view it doesn't stand up. In fact, parts are plain wrong. He has the miners paid in gold sovereigns. Well, many of them would have been pleased to see one!\n\n'He was a very conservative man and the story is of the old liberalism being destroyed by the new trade unionists and socialists.\n\n'It's a myth, a never-never land of pristine innocence ruined by the discovery of coal. His myth has generated more myths, of pits and singing miners and explosions, but it's a good yarn.'\n\nStephens said Llewellyn had always denied having a birth certificate. 'He maintained his birth had not been registered as a protest against an English custom by his Welsh nationalist grandparents.'\n\nLlewellyn would continue the tale by relating how his birth had been entered into a family Bible which was lost when the family home was bombed during the Second World War.\n\nBut not everyone can forgive Llewellyn's fraudulent past. Professor Ian Bell of Swansea University believes the author's false image of Wales is deeply xenophobic.\n\n'It creates a divide between south and north Wales and between Wales and the rest of the world. And it is racist - trouble only happens because of outsiders,' he said.\n\nLlewellyn wrote the book while on an army posting in India. His story of the Morgan family, told through the eyes of their son Huw, takes the reader in flashback from the end of the nineteenth century until the start of the First World War. Full of charming detail, it over-sugared the proud miner's lot.\n\nBy the time Hollywood got hold of it, the miners were cheery chaps singing all the way home from the pits in perfect three-part harmony like Disney dwarfs.\n\nThe 1940 film, starring Maureen O'Hara and a young Roddy McDowell, was filmed in Malibu and directed by American John Ford. It won six Oscars and was adapted twice for BBC television. A glitzy musical followed.\n\nThe novel has been translated into 30 languages and has never been out of print since it was launched two weeks after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.\n\nIt has a special place in the hearts of many readers across the world and Llewellyn was never again able to replicate its lasting appeal in any of his 26 other books.\n\n'He dedicated the follow-up to me, which was rather embarrassing as it was rather a poor work,' laughed Stephens.\n\n'But remember, he chose to be Welsh, who are we to disqualify him?'\n\nSixty years on, in a Wales where the mines are long gone and the valleys are again becoming green, perhaps patriots can forgive the semi-detached Welshman for a little literary licence."
