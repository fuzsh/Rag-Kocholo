The movie follows the story of Huw (Roddy McDowall) – the youngest of seven children – and his struggle as the unrelenting march of industrialisation take their toll on the family.\n\nRunning Time: 122 minutes\n\nABOUT THE WELFARE FILM CLUB:\n\nA small group of volunteers have recently come together to organise a monthly film club here at The Welfare, aiming to screen classic & well-loved vintage films at least once a month.\n\nAnnual membership is £30 per year, giving you free entry to all films included in our Film Club program.\n\nMembers will also be eligible to suggest, and vote on, future film titles.\n\nMembers do not need to book in advance, please check in at the Box Office before the screening."
