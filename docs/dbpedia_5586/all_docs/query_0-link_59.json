Warren accepts the Earl's proposal that the two trade identities, and while he remains in Gilleigh, the Earl retreats to his country estate. After meeting Sophronia, however, Warren quickly follows his brother to the country, where he is entranced by a lovely shepherdess named Rosalind. Sophronia also travels to the estate, and mistaking the lovesick Warren for her husband, believes that she has lost the Earl's love. Through her change of disposition, she regains her husband's affections, while Warren wins Rosalind.",
