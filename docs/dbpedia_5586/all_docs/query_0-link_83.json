        "text": "In the second of our Snapshot of a Nation mini-series, Steve Dub√© examines the background and legacy of the 1939 novel How Green Was My Valley\n\nHUW MORGAN is on his way: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to pack my two shirts with my other socks and my best suit in the little blue cloth my mother used to tie round her hair when she did the house, and I am going from the Valley.‚Äù\n\nThe opening lines of How Green Was My Valley put first-language Welsh speaker Richard David Vivian Llewellyn Lloyd from St Davids on his way to becoming the author of the most famous English language novel set in Wales and a tax exile.\n\nOr was his name Richard Herbert Arthur Llewellyn Lloyd? And was he born and brought up a monoglot English speaker in Wood Green, London, whose only connection with St Davids were the childhood holidays he spent with his grandparents?\n\nHis pen-name was Richard Llewellyn of course and his only famous book, a coming-of-age tale set in a mining community in Victorian South Wales, is as chock-a- block with nonsense as Llewellyn‚Äôs claims about his background.\n\nThis is a Valley where people go around singing and writing poetry when they are not down the pit ‚Äì in the case of the men (who were all Men) ‚Äì or glowing contentedly as the Great Welsh Mam in the case of the women, either in the kitchen or sitting outside their terrace doors waiting for the Men to return from the pit.\n\nIt‚Äôs a maudlin melodrama stuffed with cod philosophising and embroidered with Welsh idiom ‚Äì there‚Äôs nice mind ‚Äì that reached the bookshops at just the right time and defined the South Wales Valleys culture perhaps forever.\n\nThere may be ‚Äì there are ‚Äì more accurate depictions of a society that lingered until its last strangulated gasp 25 years ago, but it was Llewellyn rather than Jack Jones, Lewis Jones, Gwyn Thomas or BL Coombes that hit the spot.\n\nYou can see why, more than 70 years on. The right story in the right place at the right time, it‚Äôs heavy with nostalgia and romance, evoking a disappearing world whose joys are sharpened by the nearness of death ‚Äì a bit like the way everyone felt when World War Two changed life and lives forever on the eve of its publication in 1939.\n\nLlewellyn claimed to have worked in the pit at Gilfach Goch in the Ogmore Valley and narrowly escaped death in a rock fall, but we only have his word for that, and his word was invariably suspect; no-one ever found anyone who actually worked with him.\n\nHe is thought to have researched the background by visiting the Rhondda and talking to miners. Not that historical accuracy played much part in Llewellyn‚Äôs only significant novel among his 22.\n\nThis is an idealised world where good, in the form of hard work and solidarity among the common folk, contends stirringly but ultimately unsuccessfully against evil in the form of greed ‚Äì expressed by both mine owners and workers ‚Äì and the militancy of the new Labour movement shouldering aside the old Liberalism.\n\nNothing wrong with that, of course, but a lot of stuff and nonsense there is by here boy, and a whole heap of slush and sentiment.\n\nPerhaps the strap, wielded by fathers on daughters and sons alike, was the norm at the time. Perhaps a local minister somewhere did act as the ringleader of the vigilantes who sought out and killed a paedophile murderer on the side of the mountain.\n\nBut contrary to Llewellyn‚Äôs overriding analysis it was not the unions and immigrants who were to blame for the decline of the Valleys.\n\nAnd please spare us the miners singing as they return to work after a 22-week strike having taken a pay cut ‚Äì ‚Äú‚Ä¶they cannot afford to pay the wages they did. We must be fair, too.‚Äù\n\nThis novel was job of work and a tidy one at that for Llewellyn, who before the war wrote for a film magazine and worked as an assistant director and script writer for a small London company by day, inventing his anonymous green valley by night. It was published a month after the declaration of war and was greeted effusively in England, setting a trend that endures to this day east of Offa‚Äôs Dyke.\n\n‚ÄúEnlarges for all of us the whole bounds of experience‚Ä¶ sounds a note that has not often been heard in English prose since the days of Bunyan,‚Äù enthused the Yorkshire Post.\n\nThe reviewer in Country Life magazine could hardly contain himself: ‚ÄúA delight and a wonder; it has enchantment and it has greatness‚Ä¶ to read it is a joy and an adventure.‚Äù The reviewer was right about one thing: ‚ÄúHere is a book which has come to stay.‚Äù\n\nThe public adored it and made it the first and most famous best-seller of World War Two while Hollywood lapped it up and quickly turned a phenomenon into a cliche that still defines the Valleys for those who do not know them.\n\nThe story was rapidly taken up by 20th Century Fox and made into an even slushier film directed by John Ford and released in 1941.\n\nUnable to find more than one actor with a Welsh accent or locate it in wartime Wales ‚Äì even if he wanted to ‚Äì Ford built a replica of a South Wales mining village on a ranch in Malibu Canyon, California, complete with a mine on top of a mountain.\n\nUnreality was piled upon unreality, but no matter. The film won five Oscars, memorably pipping Citizen Kane as Best Picture and cemented the myth into the public consciousness.\n\nWith its induction into the National Film Registry of the United States, two television series and probable sales of 10 million copies in 24 languages, it‚Äôs not only come to stay. Unlike Huw Morgan, it won‚Äôt go away."
