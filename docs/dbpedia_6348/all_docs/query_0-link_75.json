The building reopened in May 1999 after the British architect Norman Foster readied it for the shift of the government of the Federal Republic to Berlin from Bonn, where it had been located for a half century. Foster’s cupola, which replaced one that had been damaged beyond repair in World War II and pulled down in 1954, quickly became one of Berlin’s most prominent landmarks as well as the symbol of the Berlin Republic, as the government of a unified Germany was now often termed. A transparent structure that at night transforms into a glowing beacon, it allows the people to stand above their elected legislators. This powerful symbolism was intended to reassure those who remained nervous about the stability of German democracy. Particularly notable was the juxtaposition between Foster’s glazed bubble and the stolid nineteenth-­century parliament building on which it sat. Designed in 1884 by Paul Wallot and completed a decade later, it was set aflame in the early months of the Third Reich. It also bore the scars of the 1945 battle for Berlin, wounds Foster left exposed in ways that suggested a retreat from conventional nationalism’s heroic narratives.1 Foster did not focus on history. Instead, he wrote, “I believed that if we were to introduce a symbolically resonant structure that would signal the changed use of the building then that structure should also be an integral part of the building’s ecology.”2 He explained the design in terms of sustainability: “The building remains a model for the future by burning vegetable oil to produce electricity. In its vision of a public architecture that redresses ecological balance, providing energy rather than consuming it, lies one of its most intrinsic expressions of optimism.”3 And yet even he acknowledged, “The reconstruction takes cues from the old building, as we\n\n1\n\n2Introduction\n\nFigure I.1.\n\nPaul Wallot, Reichstag, Berlin, 1894, with cupola by Norman Foster, 1999. Source: Matthew Field/Wikipedia Commons.\n\npeeled away the layers of the past—­mason’s marks and Soviet graffiti—­scars that have been preserved as a ‘living museum.’”4 The pairing of old and new and the frank acknowledgment of the Reichstag’s checkered past were immediately hailed not only as uniquely appropriate to the task of reinvesting this structure with the task of housing German democracy but also as epitomizing a distinctively postmodern strategy. In 2003, for instance, Andreas Huyssen, one of the most insightful observers of twentieth-­century German culture, wrote: One of the most interesting cultural phenomena of our day is the way in which memory and temporality have invaded spaces and media that seemed among the most stable and fixed: cities, monuments, architecture, and sculpture. After the waning of modernist fantasies about creatio ex nihilo and of the desire for the purity of new beginnings, we have come to read cities and buildings as palimpsests of space, monuments as transformable and transitory, and sculpture as subject to the vicissitudes of time.\n\nHe continued: The analysis of how memory and forgetting pervade real public space, the world of objects, and the urban world we live in becomes crucial. The reconstruction of Berlin as the German capital after unification provides a perhaps unique case in which this latter dimension has produced a paradigmatic public memory space.5\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nHuyssen here makes two assumptions that permeate the literature on memory and on postunification Berlin.6 The first is that there is something new and specifically postmodern about the palimpsest and the memory discourse in which it plays such a prominent role.7 In fact, this strategy predates even the founding of the Federal Republic in 1949. With the exception of one even earlier key precedent, it emerged immediately following the war, initially in the reconstruction of churches, and continued to be popular in West Germany, although only in 1989 did it begin to carry the burden of acknowledging the suffering the Germans had caused during the Third Reich rather than representing what they had endured and lost. This shift happened when Daniel Libeskind won the competition to design the extension to West Berlin’s city museum that became the Jewish Museum. Originally the use of the palimpsest alluded above all to the destruction and displacement that accompanied defeat in 1945. This morphed after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 to encompass a focus on the country’s continued division. In the first postwar decades the incorporation of ruins as well as the use of fragments and the attempt to represent absence featured prominently in a series of churches and museums that were de facto symbols of a new democratic, capitalist Germany. Huyssen and the many others who have written about Berlin since the fall of the Wall generally assume that this city is the paradigmatic place where public memory spaces have been created. Postunification Berlin has indeed been central to the discussion of memory that has been a prominent aspect of scholarship in the humanities on both sides of the Atlantic since the 1980s.8 Its buildings have helped transform architecture globally, while offering compelling evidence of the capacity of Germans to confront very directly the most difficult chapter in their long history. The representation of memory had been an important facet of West German architectural culture since the 1940s, however, and it was hardly absent in other countries in the aftermath of the war and the deindustrialization that followed several decades later.9 In the Federal Republic it was made manifest before and after 1989 in buildings in Pforzheim, Stuttgart, and Munich as well as Cologne, Düren, and Essen, to name only a few examples. That memory was a prominent feature of some of the most celebrated buildings erected in the Federal Republic in its early years has been overlooked by those who presume that memories of the war, because not often present in texts, were absent in this period. Admittedly its manifestation in architecture originally operated independently of much open public discussion or a clear theoretical base. The first emerged in the late 1950s in debates over Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin; Aldo Rossi provided the second in his influential book L’architettura della città, published in Italian in 1966 and in German seven years later, well before the beginning of the memory boom.10 In the interim, however, during the immediate postwar years, ruins were nonetheless an omnipresent feature of daily life in most German urban neighborhoods, as was new construction. In some cases these two\n\n4Introduction\n\nexperiences remained in equilibrium, as architects consciously juxtaposed them in order to mourn the shattering of what was remembered as Wilhelmine stability at the same time that they recalled the utopian promise of the experimental architecture that replaced it. The enduring impact of this architecture of fragmentation and absence is a story that has been hiding in plain sight precisely because it was articulated in stone and concrete, steel and glass rather than through the spoken or written word. The ephemeral meanings associated with it nonetheless float free of the intentions of architects and patrons alike, and remain subject to continual change. Serving as a de facto representation of the state long before it was adopted for the Reichstag, this architecture helped knit the new state together. Its defining feature is the pairing of obviously historic fabric—­or the representation of it—­w ith abstract form constructed out of modern materials. The pairing suggests an awareness of past trauma as well as the possibility of a better—­and, in the case of the Reichstag, quite clearly a more democratic—­f uture while providing Germans with a compelling and influential expression of an almost antinationalist identity.11 What often appears to be the collage of old and new is in fact a restaged clash between two different revivals. Like the Reichstag, almost all of the historic fabric preserved or quoted in these situations was designed to look older than it was by nineteenth-­century architects proud of their command of architectural history. And like Foster’s cupola, most of the new insertions into such fabric, while often heralded as being of their time, depend greatly upon precedents established in the 1910s and 1920s, above all the designs that sit slightly outside the mainstream of the New Building or International Style as delineated by such defenders of modernism as Walter Gropius, Nikolaus Pevsner, and Sigfried Giedion.12 Uncovering how remembering modernism built identity in the Federal Republic takes us outside an architectural history that is primarily about either architects or style. It also is a story that has only a tangential relationship to architectural theory. Instead, this is a tale of how architecture operates within society and how it contributes to the construction of new social and political realities. Participating in the process of determining what should be built and where quite literally helped construct democracy, first in West Germany and West Berlin, and after 1990 in a Federal Republic that now encompassed the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany), even when—­as often happened—­those finding their voice through such debates did not get their way. Complex negotiations between multiple constituencies, including architects, civil servants, intellectuals, politicians, religious leaders, and an often outspoken general public, produced places that matter partly for their formal and experiential qualities but also because of what they communicate about how a variety of Germans wanted to present themselves and their societies. This began as a local story, although from the beginning those engaged in it were trying to reintegrate Germany into a variety of international communities. In part because of the quality of the architecture it generated but also because begin-\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nning in the 1970s German clients so often turned to architects from the countries that had defeated it in two world wars, it eventually became an international one. Especially for those outsiders like Foster charged with creating national symbols, it transformed a tradition into which they could integrate themselves while working in what was for them a foreign architectural culture.13 More recently, who within Germany has access to this heritage has itself become a matter of dispute, including when Muslims want to build mosques that allude to distinctively German ways of making sacred architecture. The specific character of this story relies on a diverse array of sources. Tracing the design process of particular buildings through the drawings produced by an architect’s office mattered less here than trawling through the newspapers as well as the architecture magazines that record the often agonized and very public discussions of what should be built and why, not to mention the websites and other literature that then market the results to tourists, an increasingly important audience for this architecture and for the stories of national and regional identity it tells. These provide clues regarding the changing contexts in which these buildings have been experienced in ways that could not have been anticipated by either their designers or the original clients. The buildings themselves are also important primary sources, in that how they are constructed and the spaces they create are as crucial to their impact as the contrasting styles out of which they are assembled. Although this book is about national identity, my examples cluster in particular corners of the country. In part this reflects my personal experience as someone who has visited Berlin regularly since 1985 and whose husband has taught in Bochum since 1999. The phenomenon I chronicle, however, is also more easily discernible in Berlin and the state of Baden-­Württemberg, as well as the Rhineland and the Ruhr region than in Bavaria, the part of the Federal Republic with the strongest sense of regional autonomy and identity, or Hamburg and Bremen, which are outward-­ looking port cities.14 My focus in Modernism as Memory is on places that understood themselves to be specifically German rather than local or international. History and historicism, memory and modernism are not equivalents here but partners, dancing in complex and shifting patterns around one another. The way historicist architecture references the past was relatively easy for its original designers and their clients to identify and remains within the reach of scholars to discern. When represented by abstract form, however, memory is often much more elusive. Yet modern architecture has its own history stretching back over a century, and those who draw upon it are seldom ignorant of the web of associations connected to it. Indeed, architects are often acutely aware of such precedents, even when their patrons and publics are not. In the late 1940s modernism, very much against the grain of its own rhetoric, became a historical style. Furthermore, its pairing with an earlier historicism placed it in a dialectical relationship with exactly the architecture it had supposedly overthrown and cast the character of that victory into question.\n\n6Introduction\n\nWith a nod to the American cultural and literary historian Paul Fussell, I originally wanted to refer to the approach that is the subject of this book as the architecture of modern memory.15 The term is too trite, however, to capture the tension between how history and memory operate here.16 If history consists of scholarly accounts of the past such as this one, memory, whether collective, communicative, or cultural, to use terms employed by the French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs, and German scholars Jan Assmann and Aleida Assmann, is clearly operative, assisting individuals and societies alike in addressing the past in ways that ideally contribute productively to the formation of stable identities.17 The architecture discussed in these pages performed exactly that role, and drew upon the architecture of the past to do so. Importantly the architects, clients, and audiences knew that past, however, not so much by reading written accounts of it but through their own memories and experiences, as well as what had been passed down to them orally. Architects’ visits to buildings that served as precedents have been particularly crucial in this regard. Moreover, the divergent views of the recent past that sparked debates over what buildings should occupy particular sites were exacerbated by what kind of memory was being privileged. Clashes were particularly common between what individuals and grassroots communities remembered and how those with cultural authority acted to support the perceived interests of institutions, including the state, but also the church, cultural organizations (especially museums), and city and regional bodies. In the first decades after the war the architectural aspects of such efforts were seldom articulated in words; more recently they have often been carefully stage-­ managed by publicists. Discussions of the way in which this more official kind of memory is embedded in architecture typically focus on commemorative structures, but this account bursts beyond those narrow limits. Memoryscapes in the Federal Republic of Germany have often engaged everyday life. Visitors to the Topography of Terror documentation center in Berlin are usually tourists intent on seeing how Germany officially addresses the Holocaust. Those who pop into the Galeries Lafayette in Berlin to buy a blouse, stroll through the New State Gallery in Stuttgart on their way to work, worship at St. Anna in Düren on Sundays, or go rock climbing in the Landscape Park in Duisburg on a holiday weekend may not pause, however, to think about how these places relate to multiple pasts, but their unusually high quality arises directly out of the effort to do so. Indeed, the presence of the past within modern German architecture can be traced back not to a monument but to an office building. Most of those who waited in 1999 to enter the Reichstag believed they were seeing something new and fresh. Few realized that a half-­hour stroll away an earlier era of political violence had long been marked through very similar means. Between 1900 and 1903 the firm of Cremer and Wolffenstein erected the headquarters of the Rudolf Mosse publishing company (Figure I.2).18 One of the most modern Berlin office blocks of its day,\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure I.2.\n\n7\n\nCremer and Wolffenstein, Mossehaus, Berlin, 1903, with addition by Erich Mendelsohn, Richard Neutra, and Paul Rudolf Henning, 1923.

In January 1919 the corner of the building was badly damaged during the brutal suppression of the Spartacists, which fatally split the German left. Between 1921 and 1923 Erich Mendelsohn, ably assisted by Richard Neutra and Paul Rudolf Henning, replaced the burned-­out corner and added three stories. The Jerusalem Street facade was destroyed in World War II, after which it was rebuilt in simplified form; the building was restored again in 1992–­93, when the postwar facade was largely replaced by Peter Kolb, Bernd Kemper, and Dieter Schneider.20 Designed shortly after Hannah Hoch crafted her pioneering Dada photomontage,\n\n8Introduction\n\nCut with the Kitchen Knife through the Beer Belly of the Weimar Republic, Mendelsohn, Neutra, and Henning’s intervention boldly rejected the paradigm of the office building as Renaissance palace that remained common on both sides of the Atlantic in favor of a dramatic juxtaposition, whose violent cause they did not entirely obscure.21 Instead, their new tile-­and stucco-­clad stories embedded in, as well as floating above, Cremer and Wolffenstein’s masonry mass announced a dynamic alternative to historicism. They exploited the possibility an underlying skeletal frame allowed for expansive glazing, while capturing a sense of the excitement and novelty of the new speeds at which automobiles rushed by. At the same time their refusal simply to mask what had occurred here, unusual in the immediate aftermath of a war that had wrought relatively little physical damage on German soil, foreshadowed the destruction that was to come.22 Mossehaus and the many buildings that followed in its wake challenge myths about modern architecture that must be put aside if we want to understand fully how a select group of German buildings of the last hundred years has shaped the world around them and, more particularly, how cannibalizing modernism’s own history, and contrasting it to historicist alternatives, has been fundamental to the way the Federal Republic has presented itself to citizens, residents, and tourists alike. Recovering the ways in which prewar modern German architecture served as a useful precedent after 1945 requires accepting the limitations of modern architecture’s own theory in order to understand how it actually worked in practice and indeed why it could be so effective. Five such preconceptions must be dismissed. The first is that new technology necessarily generated modern architecture’s forms. The second is that modern architecture was objective rather than symbolic. Third, that modern architecture was necessarily the work of heroic geniuses is another persistent misperception. Fourth, that modern architecture was inherently socialist, or at least politically progressive and thus democratic, is an equally stubborn, if factually in­ correct, assumption.23 A final myth is that modern architecture was both masculine and specifically Western. This book’s six chapters demonstrate a continuum, one that stretches across the whole trajectory of modernism’s history, at the same time that they destabilize our understanding of that past. The opening chapter addresses buildings erected for the Werkbund Exhibition held in Cologne in 1914 and completed in Stuttgart in the late 1920s.24 This discussion demonstrates the original range of the modernism available to later architects. The industrial aesthetic manifested in the Model Factory in Cologne and the Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart was never the entire story. The Glashaus and the Werkbund Theater in Cologne and the train station and the Schocken store in Stuttgart introduced themes of spiritualism, plasticity, monumentality, and commercialism that reappeared again and again. Although most of these buildings were erected out of modern materials, more important in this context is the nearly complete rejection of history as a source of form, as well as an equally\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nrelentless commitment to abstraction. Most of what was modern in the remembered modernism of the postwar decades was overtly technological in its use of glass, steel, concrete, and even wood, but there are important exceptions. Too often these are understood as diverging from the mainstream of the modern movement rather than being a part of it, because that movement has itself been defined so narrowly. Wolfgang Pehnt’s inclusive approach provides a key precedent for my account.25 The relationship between technology and an emphasis on tactility is clear in two of the examples addressed in chapter 2, which focuses on churches completed between 1947 and 1968. Otto Bartning’s Church of the Resurrection in Pforzheim and Rudolf Schwarz’s St. Anna in Düren are monumental buildings with solid stone walls, even as Bartning employed laminated plywood trusses and Schwarz structural concrete to support their roofs. Considering them in the context of Egon Eiermann’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin and Gottfried Böhm’s Pilgrimage Church of Mary in Neviges emphasizes that, although abstract, built form conveyed and continues to convey meaning. William Jordy explored the symbolic essence of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye as early as 1963, but this dimension of modern architecture remains underexplored by those who assume it is exclusively postmodern.26 Eiermann may not have appreciated the contribution the bombed-­out steeple made to the design of the Memorial Church, but it remained because so many others did. Meanwhile both Eiermann and Böhm drew quite explicitly upon expressionism in order to create modern sacred spaces whose spiritual qualities were derived from the manipulation of space and light, rather than being dependent on representational art. Bartning, Schwarz, Eiermann, and Böhm were major German architects, but they are not the stars who stand at the center of most international histories of modern architecture. At the beginning of his survey of modern architecture, Alan Colquhoun, one of the most astute historians of the subject, declared, “If [this book] is still largely a history of the masters, that is because that was the nature of modernism itself, despite its many claims to anonymity.”27 The middle ground between giants like Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe on the one hand and anonymous engineers on the other merits more attention, not least because without it one cannot understand that the giants were not always such geniuses but rather were talented men and women well aware of the work of their contemporaries and their predecessors. Huyssen conceives of Foster’s use of the palimpsest as new because he has overlooked Mossehaus and the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.28 The connecting thread that ties these buildings together has been ignored because what was being remembered changed, even as the architectural means for invoking memory remained relatively constant. Developed to acknowledge specifically German suffering, and to comfort survivors by preserving the traces of a more stable past as well as hinting at the possibility of rebirth, this architecture encompassed a dual haunting, in which the previously antithetical polarities of militarist\n\n10Introduction\n\nWilhelmine historicism finally came to terms with the revolutionary art and politics that had challenged but not completely toppled it during the 1910s and 1920s. The wounds of the battle between them, and of the fissures within the society that had prompted such catastrophic violence, remained on display, almost as a warning. Although this was a profoundly historicist architecture, anchored in a dueling past, the modernist half of it was typically presented as new. Acting as a bridge between these postwar churches and the canonical architectural examples of postmodern German memory that dominate the literature on the subject are the museums that are the subject of chapter 3. From Hans Döllgast’s reconstruction of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich to Daniel Libeskind’s successful entry in the competition to design the addition to West Berlin’s city museum that became the Jewish Museum, West German and West Berlin museum architecture became a place where experimentation in referencing the past from within modernism flourished, even as postmodern alternatives also emerged. Not all of these buildings explicitly paired ruins with new construction, but they were part of a conversation influenced by this possibility. In the New National Gallery in Berlin and the New State Gallery in Stuttgart, Mies and James Stirling, respectively, allude to Schinkel’s Altes Museum, located in what was then East Berlin. Representing absence mattered in a variety of contexts, whether that of the destruction that accompanied Germany’s defeat in World War II, the division of Berlin by the Wall, or the elimination of Berlin’s Jewish community in the Holocaust. Sometimes, as with Frank Gehry’s Vitra Design Museum, drawing upon modernism’s past in a way that emphasized instability and displacement was probably, paradoxically, partly just a way to fit in. Chapter 4 pairs four memoryscapes erected in Berlin in the first two decades following reunification with examples of critical reconstruction, as Berlin city authorities termed their preferred approach to rebuilding East Berlin. My discussion highlights the degree to which the Galeries Lafayette by Jean Nouvel, the renovation of the New Museum by David Chipperfield, and the Topography of Terror by Ursula Wilms and Heinz Hallmann, as well as the Reichstag, emerge out of the architecture addressed in earlier chapters, while the reconstruction of the Hotel Adlon and the Hohenzollern Palace, as well as Oswald Mathias Ungers’s Friedrichstadt Passagen and Peter Eisenman’s Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe are more conventional examples of a postmodernism that drew instead upon neoclassical precedent. Often forgotten in the highly politicized debates over which histories to preserve and reference was the long association that Christian Democrats had with the palimpsest and with transparency, whereas Hans Stimmann, the Berlin civil servant whose regulations often chafed both architects and preservationists, came from the left wing of the local Social Democratic Party. The emphasis on Berlin has hampered recognition of the variety of purposes memories of modernism served in these same years.29 In Berlin the palimpsest was\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nalmost always understood, pace Huyssens, as a particularly honest way of addressing the Third Reich. In the Ruhr region, close to the Belgian and Dutch borders, the remnants of the coal mining and steel foundries that had propelled Germany’s industrial and economic modernization were transformed into the cultural infrastructure the region had always lacked in a bold effort to attract economic development. Here, however, as chapter 5 makes clear, the Third Reich was glossed over, as the degree to which heavy industry was implicated in its crimes distracted from this goal. The redevelopment of a blast furnace into a park, and a colliery into museums and a design school, was, as in Berlin, accompanied by narratives aimed at tourists. These often ignored lived memories of visits paid by Nazi dignitaries, the use of slave labor during the war, left-­w ing unions, and industrial pollution, which, as the local Social Democrats leading the effort rightly realized, were unlikely to attract investors. Finally, until very recently the story of German modernity, and with it of modern German architecture, has usually been told as one led by men on behalf of ethnic Germans. It was always more complicated, not least as modern architecture has long been one of Germany’s most successful exports with an impact in Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries that rivaled the one it has had in the United States. Chapter 6 addresses the efforts of devout Muslims in Cologne, almost all of Turkish heritage, to mark their place in the city and in German society by building one of Europe’s largest and most modern mosques. That their effort to work within modern German sacred architecture was misread as a demonstration of Muslim hegemony defines the limits of integration in the Federal Republic less than a decade ago. At the same time Zaha Hadid’s ability to generate enormously favorable publicity for the futuristic ambitions of design-­oriented German manufacturers is a potent example of the way this heritage of diffusion has fed back into recent German architecture and identity. Rather than making the definitive break with the past that modernism was supposed to accomplish, the architecture addressed in this book bridged old and new. It created a new antimonumentality that stood in powerful distinction to the bombast of the Second Empire and also the Brutalism of the immediate postwar decades. Refusing to paper over the damage done by war and division, it provided a template for eventually addressing the full range of the horror unleashed by the Third Reich. And it provided a model for a renascent modern architecture, tempered by postmodernism’s respect for context and attention to scale but independent of its often shallow focus on surface and its superficial trust in being able to restore an ideal order that never existed. Whereas Aleida Assmann astutely writes, “Reconstruction makes place not for a new future but for another past,” this architecture created a dialogue on the basis of which one could continue to move forward.30 The architecture that juxtaposed ruined historic structures with the re-­creation of modernist idealism has provided the Federal Republic of Germany with its most potent postwar symbols, onto which new meanings have and will continue to be\n\n12Introduction\n\nattached; future generations may end up seeing these buildings as representations of when they were built rather than of the historical events they originally evoked. Moreover they were always exceptional. Exposing the wounds of war is never going to be the dominant approach for a successful city or country. Nonetheless, in a few extraordinary cases this creative use of modernism’s own history has created impressively meaningful places, whose full impact is best conveyed through personal experience rather than mediated images. It has also made contemporary Germany one of the rare countries in which civic spaces are regularly more compelling than their commercial counterparts. Finally, this is an architecture that has challenged and will certainly continue to challenge residents and visitors alike both to confront and to overcome a tangled and terrible past.\n\nOne\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern On 1 October 2010 the international online version of Der Spiegel, Germany’s leading weekly newsmagazine, reported on the suppression of a demonstration in the southwestern city of Stuttgart, the capital of the state of Baden-­Württemberg and the home of the internationally renowned automotive firms Daimler-­Benz and Porsche: A hardline police operation against demonstrators protesting against a new railway station project in Stuttgart has shocked Germany, after more than 100 people were injured by tear gas and water cannon. . . . Around 600 police used water cannon, tear gas, pepper spray and batons in an operation against over 1,000 demonstrators. . . . The activists had tried to use a sit-­down protest to prevent the city’s Schlossgarten park from being cleared so that work could begin on felling trees in the park as part of construction work on the new station. Thursday’s protests were attended by a broad cross-­section of society, including pensioners and children.1\n\nCem Özdemir, the coleader of the Green Party, commented that the state interior minister was “confusing Germany with Putin’s Russia” and complained that “pepper gas was sprayed in the eyes of grandmothers and children at close range. We are in Germany. Such methods do not exist here.”2 A wide array of German newspapers from across the political spectrum seconded this view, while Roland Nelles, a Spiegel columnist, associated the unsubtle tactics with “the young democracy that was the Federal Republic 30 years ago,” rather than what he implied was the mature state of 2010.3 Popular revulsion against the strong-­arm police tactics propelled the Greens on 27 March 2011 into their first chief ministry of a German state, although eight months later the majority of Baden-­Württemberg voters who turned out for a referendum cast their ballots in favor of the project, whose slow pace of completion continues to raise eyebrows in Germany and abroad.4\n\n13\n\n14\n\nFigure 1.1.\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\nPaul Bonatz and Friedrich Eugen Scholer, main train station, Stuttgart, 1928. Source: Harke/Wikipedia Commons.\n\nThe controversy over the replacement of large sections of Stuttgart’s main train station, and the mammoth rail project to which they were attached, was hardly the first time the Federal Republic had seen debates over architecture serve as expressions of German democracy as well as of its limits. The two have been intertwined since at least the late 1950s, when the citizenry of West Berlin rallied, as will be described in chapter 2, in support of the preservation of what had long been seen as an example of relatively conservative architecture. The debate over the fate of Stuttgart’s main train station, which had been designed in 1911 by the firm of Paul Bonatz and Friedrich Eugen Scholer, and finally completed in 1928, doubled as one over the definition of modern architecture and the degree to which what had not so long again been new should now be preserved as historic (Figure 1.1). Any understanding of the way in which the modern architecture of the late Wilhelmine period and of the Weimar Republic has been used since in the architecture of the Federal Republic must begin with a discussion of what modern German architecture originally was. Recognizing the use of an earlier modern architecture\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n15\n\nin the buildings erected in postwar West Germany and the postunification Berlin Republic, as well as in a reunited Germany since 1989, requires an acceptance of a broader definition of modern architecture than has been widely used by architectural historians, especially those writing from the 1940s through the 1980s.5 Modern German architecture was never limited to the Weissenhof Housing Estate, erected in Stuttgart in 1927, or the Bauhaus building that opened in Dessau the previous year, nor even to the New Building, that is, the office buildings, department stores, cinemas, and housing constructed of new materials in a spare, lean but also often exciting style during the short economic boom of 1924–­29 and slightly after it, and the expressionist ferment out of which its more rational and functional approach emerged.6 A trio of buildings erected on the grounds of the exhibition staged by the German Werkbund in Cologne in the summer of 1914 and a second triplet completed in Stuttgart by the end of the following decade provide a useful point of departure for a more nuanced understanding of modern German architecture’s original range of style and purpose. Their diversity challenges the notions that modern architecture was objective rather than symbolic, that new technology necessarily generated its unfamiliar forms, that it was inherently socialist or at least politically progressive, that it was always the work of heroic geniuses, that its mediated image was as important as the physical facts of the building, and that it was both masculine and specifically Western. This account also restores to a central position within the architecture of the period the precedents employed most often by those postwar architects who used modernism as a historical source. The Cologne buildings and the first two Stuttgart examples give a sense of modern German architecture’s original breadth; the final Stuttgart case, that of the Weissenhof Estate, marks the point when stylistic definitions began to narrow in ways that would influence the subsequent writing of the history of modern German architecture much more than they have the practice of modern architecture in the Federal Republic.\n\nObjective or Expressionist: The Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne The German Werkbund, a group composed of architects, designers, critics, and industrialists, was formed in 1907. It aimed to integrate modern industrial production with high art by paying unprecedented attention to the design of factories and shops, as well as of the goods made and sold in them and the way in which they were advertised. The group was remarkably successful in persuading its peers that the quality and character of design mattered enormously. Good design, they argued, could advance the German economy, above all by increasing exports, but they were also interested in the impact it had upon maintaining what many saw to be the unique characteristics of German culture.7 Although many of the figures associated with the\n\n16\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\nmovement espoused both innovative new designs and relatively progressive political positions, there was an overall emphasis on using design to transcend the challenges that industrialization posed to traditional German social organization (community rather than society, in the words of the pioneering German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies).8 This inherent respect for an underlying status quo helps explain the appeal that Werkbund positions would eventually have for established institutions like the Catholic Church.9 Seven years after the Werkbund was established it sponsored an exhibition in the Rhineland city of Cologne, just across the river from the cathedral, which had finally been completed in 1880.10 Midcareer architects, such as Peter Behrens, Theodor Fischer, Hermann Muthesius, and Bruno Paul, stuck to convention. The somewhat ponderous neoclassicism of their contributions disappointed those who had hoped for a reprise of the collective boldness these men had earlier displayed. The three exceptions were the Model Factory by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer, the Werkbund Theater by Henry van de Velde, and the Glashaus by Bruno Taut. The first two faced each other; the third stood on the exhibition’s periphery. Together they proposed a series of new directions for modern architecture. Ever since Nikolaus Pevsner, then a young German émigré, published Pioneers of the Modern Movement (later retitled Pioneers of Modern Design from William Morris to Walter Gropius) in London in 1936, the Model Factory (Figure 1.2) has been seen as the building that anticipated Gropius’s Dessau Bauhaus, and therefore as the last key step toward the establishment of what would come to be known as the International Style. Pevsner, who was only twelve in the summer of 1914, probably knew the building only from photographs. Clearly thinking of it more in terms of the context of the cathedral than of the other exhibition buildings, he wrote of the glazed corner stair towers of its administration block: There is something sublime in this effortless mastery of material and weight. Never since the Sainte-­Chapelle and the choir of Beauvais had the human art of building been so triumphant over matter. Yet the character of the building is entirely un-­Gothic, anti-­Gothic. While in the thirteenth century all lines, functional though they were, served the one artistic purpose of pointing heavenwards in a goal beyond this world, and walls were made translucent to carry the transcendental magic of saintly figures rendered in colored glass, the glass walls are now clear and without mystery, the steel frame is hard, and its expression discourages all other-­worldly speculation. It is the creative energy of this world in which we live and work and which we want to master, a world of science and technology, of speed and danger, of hard struggles and no personal security, that is glorified in Gropius’s architecture, and as long as this is the world and these are its ambitions and problems, the style of Gropius and the other pioneers will be valid.11\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n17\n\nFigure 1.2.

The middle story of the facade facing the assembly hall was almost completely glazed and, in part because it projected out farther on both sides, appeared to float almost free between the more conventional piers of the ground story and the hovering planes of the cantilevered roof slabs of the corner pavilions and of the roof terrace set between them (Figure 1.3). It was almost certainly based on Wright’s City National Bank and Hotel, completed two years earlier in Mason City, Iowa, and published in Germany in the Wasmuth Portfolio. The facade facing van de Velde’s theater was scarcely more conventional. Terminated at both ends by the projecting stair towers, it consisted otherwise mostly of a brick screen wall divided by a row of vertical recessions and pinned to the ground by squat pavilion-­like insertions on either side of the door. Here Gropius invoked the solidity of an ancient Egyptian mastaba or pylon, against which he contrasted the transparent glazing of the stair towers. Only in the angled side view published by Pevsner does this building appear to be a precursor of the building Gropius completed a dozen years later for the Bauhaus, the twentieth century’s most influential school of art and design, which he had founded in Weimar in 1919. In other respects the lingering interest in monumentality, albeit expressed in terms of ancient Egypt and modern America, especially as realized in the largely opaque entrance facade, appears characteristically\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n19\n\nFigure 1.4.

The collage-­l ike quality of the administration building’s paradoxical juxtaposition of glazed volumes and nearly transparently thin walls, with its self-­consciously archaic main mass was more prescient of the postwar German architecture that is the chief subject of this book than of the far more dynamically composed Bauhaus. Visitors to the exhibition, such as the young critic Adolf Behne, found the theater and the Glashaus at least as intriguing.13 The theater, designed by a leading proponent of art nouveau old enough to be Gropius’s and Taut’s father, proved that sculptural forms devised largely independently of the structural properties of materials could create an equally compelling path to abstraction (Figure 1.4).14 Its strongly sculpted volumes emerged out of reforms in theater and set design associated with the emergence of a mass audience rather than from the development of new building materials or construction techniques. Trained as an artist rather than an architect, van de Velde was always more interested in form for its own sake than in following his fellow Belgian Victor Horta’s lead in exploiting the simultaneously structural and ornamental properties of iron and steel. Nonetheless, published photographs of the building’s facade inspired the young Erich Mendelsohn’s experiments with\n\n20\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\nreinforced concrete in ways that would be remembered in postwar Germany even before Le Corbusier’s church at Ronchamp reawakened interest in such plasticity.15 Although they were probably made largely out of plaster, the apparent solidity of van de Velde’s tiered masses, which stepped from a low vestibule up to the roof over the auditorium and the fly tower at the back of the stage and splayed out at the rear to encompass backstage facilities, starkly contrasted with the weightless volumes of Gropius’s stair towers. For contemporaries, however, the difference between the two buildings was not so much a question of form as of the approach the two architects took toward social issues. In a lecture delivered at the Folkwang Museum in Hagen in 1911, Gropius argued that industrialists should build modern factories in order to promote better relations with their workforces. In remarks that anticipate Le Corbusier’s slogan “architecture instead of revolution,” Gropius wrote, “The uneducated worker not only cares about light, air and cleanliness, but also possesses an unappreciated respect for the form of the building in which he works and the pristine feeling of beauty in its spaces.”16 Although van de Velde’s commitment to political reform has been exaggerated, there is no doubt that he designed the theater in keeping with a degree of social engagement that Gropius did not yet share.17 The theater’s unusual lack of tiered and box seating flattened out distinctions in status among audience members, while innovations in the shape of the stage and in atmospheric lighting were part of larger efforts in the contemporary theater world to generate a sense of community through the creation of shared empathetic reactions to the spectacle they were witnessing. Van de Velde, whose network of friends and collaborators included the producer Gordon Craig, and who had already proposed theaters for Weimar and Paris (control of the latter had been wrested from him by the contractor Auguste Perret), had long been interested in such reforms.18 Indeed, he had originally intended to design a cinema rather than a conventional theater for the exhibition.19 For van de Velde, being modern depended not on how or where an object was made, but on what it looked like and how it was used. Should one seek to impose formal order in order to dignify industrial processes and their products, thus raising them to the status of culture? Or did the dynamic energy of modernity better merit artistic expression in designs that literally broke the bounds of convention? In his architecture for the Glashaus, Taut synthesized many aspects of these competing positions in a building whose marginal position at the edge of the original exhibition can be contrasted with the enduring impact that it, and expressionism more generally, have had on subsequent German architecture.20 Built ostensibly as an advertising pavilion for the glass industry, the Glashaus doubled as a demonstration of how the spiritual ambitions of German expressionist literature and painting might be conveyed architecturally (Figure 1.5). Designed to look like a crystal, the apparently circular building, which glowed from within with colored light, in fact had a substantial rear appendage. This housed a cascade\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n21\n\nFigure 1.5. Bruno Taut, Glashaus, Werkbund Exhibition, Cologne, 1914.

The walls of this chamber were covered with colored mosaics; Taut set stained glass by leading expressionist painters into the windows (Gropius and van de Velde had also collaborated with important contemporary artists). The room under the faceted dome housed a display of glass products and exhibited some of the novel ways in which glass could be used as building material. The dramatic lighting effects, now detached from the production of a particular play, were intended to evoke the experience of medieval worship in a Gothic cathedral or chapel, with the crystal form intended as a mystical replacement for the steeples of medieval churches. Taut commissioned a series of aphorisms from the writer Paul Scheerbart, several of which he inscribed on the concrete lintel supporting the faceted roof structure. The most\n\n22\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\nFigure 1.6. Interior, Glashaus. Copyright Bildarchiv Foto Marburg.\n\nfamous of these—­“Colored glass destroys hate”—­captured his aspirations for what glass architecture could achieve. It was not to be. Even before the outbreak of the First World War brought an early end to the exhibition, the Werkbund was nearly sundered by internal divisions about the appropriate relationship between art and industry. When Muthesius recommended increasing standardization, van de Velde, who led the counterattack, championed the importance of individual artistry. He garnered the active support not only of August Endell and Hans Obrist, prominent Germans who had been early advocates of art nouveau (or Jugendstil as it was known in German), but also of Taut and Gropius, who did not want to have their own chance to make a mark precluded by the adoption of neoclassical norms.21 The debate, which was also between those who saw design reform principally in terms of the contribution it could make to the German economy, and particularly the export market, and those who took a more internationalist position, had important ramifications for Gropius. The following year van de Velde included his name, with those of Endell and Obrist (whose sculpture ornamented the Werkbund Theater), in the list of his possible successors he sent to the authorities in Weimar, where he had been forced to resign from the directorship of the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts, which he had founded in 1908. This would lead to Gropius’s assuming\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n23\n\nthe directorship of the Bauhaus. Meanwhile, following the revolution of November 1918, Gropius joined Taut and Behne in founding the Arbeitsrat für Kunst. A workers’ council, established in November 1918 along the lines adopted by many trade unions but intended for artists, it unsuccessfully lobbied the new Social Democratic president Friedrich Ebert, who was preoccupied with establishing political control in the face of often violent opposition from both the far left and the far right. In declaring that “art and people must form a unity,” its founding manifesto set the tone Gropius would take less than six months later in the Bauhaus Manifesto, when he concluded with a vision of “the new structure of the future, which will embrace architecture and sculpture and painting in one unity and which will one day rise towards heaven from the hands of a million workers like the crystal symbol of a new faith.”22 In late 1919 and throughout 1920, Gropius and Taut were also active in the Crystal Chain, a group of architects who corresponded about their aspirations for a utopian architecture along lines largely inspired by Taut’s visions of crystalline city crowns, expanded versions of the Glashaus that were intended to foster democracy.23 The positions represented by the three standout buildings at the Werkbund Exhibition would thus be closely bound together in the years that immediately followed, although this would not be consistently reflected in the literature on modern architecture over the course of the subsequent century, which would long favor objectivity over expressionism. This was due in part to Gropius’s refusal to share credit with contemporaries and to the hawk’s eye he kept, especially during his years in the United States, on what historians had to say. As early as 1923, he objected vehemently to Mies’s proposal to include van de Velde’s theater in an enlarged version of the exhibition of contemporary architecture Gropius had organized at the Bauhaus.24 Others were more generous, however. After the Second World War the Academy of the Arts in West Berlin, as the successor to the Prussian Academy, made Gropius, Mies, and van de Velde honorary members.25 Gropius was more gracious about Taut, describing him to an American scholar in 1962 as “a close friend of mine. . . . Though we were quite different characters, we got along very well, complementing each other, so to speak.”26 Some sense of the continuing complexity of the subject can be gained from a consideration of three buildings completed in Stuttgart in the late 1920s and their subsequent fate.\n\nStuttgart: Multiple Modernisms and Their Fates Most of those who arrived in Stuttgart in the 1920s to view its new buildings would have traveled by train. They would have alighted in the first major German train station to break with nineteenth-­century historicism. The final touches were put on the building in 1928, seventeen years after Bonatz and Scholer (the building has always been credited to Bonatz) had won the competition for its design. 27 From the station they could have walked downtown to see one of Europe’s most stunning new\n\n24\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\ndepartment stores, the Schocken store designed by Mendelsohn and also completed in 1928, or traveled to the suburbs to the Weissenhof Housing Estate, where housing for civil servants designed by architects from across Western Europe had opened for public exhibition in the summer of 1927. Here, too, a variety of modern architectures was on display. Their purposes, as the traveler would quickly have realized, ranged from civic to commercial to domestic. Although used by people of all classes, these buildings were clearly designed to address a middle-­class observer, who would have been more likely than his or her working-­class contemporaries to grasp the allusions they made to sources as diverse as ancient Mesopotamia, the subject of some of the latest German archaeological discoveries, and recent American factories. It was also this middle class that could afford the modern conveniences on display in the model dwellings of the Weissenhof. As important as reconstructing the original diversity of what was considered modern in Stuttgart at the end of the 1920s is understanding the way in which later, narrower definitions of modern architecture governed the fate of these buildings. Mendelsohn’s store was demolished in 1960, and parts of the train station were pulled down in 2011 and 2012. Although much more badly damaged in World War II, what survived of the Weissenhof now appears in relatively pristine condition, following extensive renovations in the 1980s. Public discussions over the preservation of the Schocken store and the Weissenhof never prompted the intervention of riot police, but they remain illustrative of the importance of architecture to local—­ and national—­definitions of cultural identity. The monumental station, whose surviving crisp rectangular volumes are clad in a homogeneous facing of boldly rusticated stone, was regarded as a major example of modern architecture in the 1920s and well beyond.28 As such it stood for the creation of fresh and viable alternatives to the surfeit of ornament, as well as the historical sources of that ornament, that had enveloped most civic buildings in Germany, Europe, and indeed much of the rest of the world, in the decades before it was begun. In Germany, this break with the immediate past was strongly associated with the reforms espoused by the Werkbund, but also with the proud nationalism that, as in the case of Muthesius and many other Werkbund leaders, often fueled reform efforts.29 The massiveness and palpable weight of the station walls, as well as the impressive scale of its major interiors and the neo-­A ssyrian style of the carving of the few sculptures that ornamented them, all indicated that this was a building designed not to conform to the whims of fashion but to outlast them. At the same time the simple rectangular design of the glass-­and-­steel structures over the tracks suggested a matter-­of-­fact acceptance of the technology they were built to serve. Just as Gropius borrowed from ancient Egyptian architecture as well as what he understood to be the equally primitive forms of American industrial architecture, Bonatz turned for inspiration to reconstructions of Babylon as well as his own travel sketches of Cairo.30\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n25\n\nThe terminal was modern because both its forms and the technology used to build at least the tracks were obviously new. By the time it was completed, however, its very weight and apparent permanence distinguished it from more up-­to-­the-­ minute trends in architecture, collectively known at the time in Germany as the New Building. For this reason, although its status as one of Stuttgart’s most imposing twentieth-­century buildings was never in doubt, the importance of preserving the entire structure could be called into question in the 1990s, when ambitious efforts to transform both the city and the regional rail line were developed. These entailed converting the terminal to a through station, and involved the demolition of much of Bonatz’s building as well as the creation of a new, largely underground station designed by Ingenhoven Architects and still under construction in 2018.31 These changes will free land behind Bonatz’s station for development, and create a faster train connection between Stuttgart and Ulm, and thus also between Paris and Bratislava and Budapest. They come, however, at the cost of parts of the earlier station and also the trees in a neighboring park. Yet precisely because the station was not an avant-­garde building, opposition to the scheme, although led by the Green Party, was clearly never exclusive to the left. Many in the historically relatively politically conservative city of Stuttgart simply opposed change and found the existing train station more to their taste than Ingenhoven’s futuristic design. Others opposed the development of a new quarter behind it. Farther afield, however, where the building was not a familiar friend, it could appear almost menacing. The American architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff weighed in, writing in 2009: Completed several years before Hitler took power, the Stuttgart terminal may be Bonatz’s most masterly architectural balancing act. Its imposing front facade, marked by a shallow arcade and towering stone pillars, is as haunting as an early de Chirico painting. Framed by stone entry halls at either end, it has a severe, stripped-­down Classicism that also suggests why Bonatz was able to continue building well into the Nazi era.32\n\nDebates over how to define modern architecture and what about it might be worth preserving were scarcely new in Stuttgart. The Schocken Department Store stood between 1928 and 1960 less than a kilometer to the south of the train station (Figure 1.7).33 Unlike the latter structure, it was completed quite quickly, having been designed only in 1926. Occupying an entire city block, the store, which was dedicated to the sale of inexpensive, mass-­produced goods, was dramatic by day and even more so by night, when apparently weightless shop windows and the corner stair tower glowed from within as did the giant lettering spelling out the Schocken name.34 Like Gropius, Mendelsohn had been inspired by American factories and department stores, which he had seen for himself during a 1924 tour of New York City,\n\n26\n\nFigure 1.7.\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\nErich Mendelsohn, Schocken Department Store, Stuttgart, 1968. Copyright Bildarchiv Foto Marburg.\n\nBuffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Chicago.35 Forsaking the escapism that resulted in many such stores resembling palaces, he instead jazzed up the relatively straightforward engineering of the concrete-­f ramed factories in which Model T Fords were produced and took obvious inspiration as well from the glazed stair towers of Gropius’s Model Factory. The result was emblematic of the New Building. Mendelsohn’s attentiveness to shape, and particularly the plastic approach to concrete he thought he saw in the Werkbund Theater, which had infused his breakthrough building, the Einstein Tower in Potsdam, helped him slot a new scale of structure sympathetically into the existing cityscape. He wrapped four different facade treatments, each calibrated to the scale of the streets they faced, around the store. Moreover, although he had been critical of Taut’s mysticism, Mendelsohn’s careful attention to lighting clearly reflected the lessons he had learned from the adherents of the Crystal Chain.36 The commercial architecture of the New Building flourished not only because it was inexpensive, but because it conveyed an appealing image of Germany as being, despite its recent disastrous defeat and the lingering weakness of its economy, en-\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n27\n\ntirely up to date. Architecture has always been in part about articulating aspirations and desires through concrete physical form and spaces. Mendelsohn’s Schocken store was an unusually pragmatic building, but it also intentionally sizzled with seductive allure; the sleek packaging of the tautly wrought surfaces of many of the Weissenhof dwellings were even less informative about how they were actually constructed and intended to be used. Mendelsohn’s ability to fuse objectivity and expressionism in a building that was commercially successful and yet obviously avant-­garde made him one of the most renowned and influential architects of the interwar years. Gropius tacitly acknowledged his influence in 1923, when, in an early attempt to exclude expressionism (defined as Häring, Hermann Finsterlin, and Scharoun) as well as van de Velde from definitions of modern architecture, he instead organized his exhibition of contemporary architecture at the Bauhaus “from a very specific standpoint, namely that of the dynamic-­f unctional side of the development of modern architecture, away from ornament and profile.” Dynamic functionalism was a term Mendelsohn had already employed, as Gropius must have known, for the title of a lecture.37 None of this was enough to save the Schocken store. Mendelsohn died in exile in San Francisco in 1953; his patron Salman Schocken in Switzerland in 1959.38 Both men were Zionist Jews who had fled Germany for first Jerusalem and then the United States. The campaign to preserve the building was led by students and young staff from the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, including Jürgen Joedicke, who was to become a prominent historian and critic of modern architecture. Their position in many ways presaged that of the so-­called sixty-­eighters who would attempt to distance themselves from their parents’ generation, which they saw as compromised by their collaboration with, or at the least passivity toward, the Third Reich. Joedicke and his friends received support from prominent elders, however. Gropius sent a telegram stating, “The Mendelsohn building must remain.”39 The star-­studded list of those who rallied behind its preservation included Alvar Aalto, Reyner Banham, Max Bill, Richard Döcker, Sigfried Giedion, Ludwig Hilberseimer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Richard Neutra, J. J. P. Oud, and Eero Saarinen, a veritable who’s who of the founders of the modern movement and the next generation of their supporters.40 The Schocken store, however, was vulnerable on several grounds. First, there is little reason to believe that the Stuttgart authorities were impressed by the appeals from figures they had never particularly respected. Most had trained during the interwar years at the local architecture school, which under the leadership of Bonatz and Paul Schmitthenner had remained conservative stylistically throughout both the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich.41 Second, modernism’s own rhetoric, which was functionalist rather than respectful of history, meant that the building could be and was labeled obsolete by both planners and its owners. The first wanted to widen Eberhardtstrasse; the second preferred an interior with clear spans, rather than one interrupted by a grid of pillars. Older architects, including one who had\n\n28\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\nFigure 1.8. Weissenhof Estate, Stuttgart, 1927. Copyright Bildarchiv Foto Marburg.\n\nknown Mendelsohn personally, argued that according to the tenets of modernism it should be replaced, without preserving even the facade, the solution that Egon Eiermann, who designed its successor, professed to prefer.42 The chief reason, however, the Schocken store was demolished was that by 1959 modern German architecture had been redefined. Two stories, the Bauhaus and an exhibition held in Stuttgart in 1927 under the leadership of an architect who in 1930 would become the influential school’s third director, dominated the new narrative. The Weissenhof Estate, organized by Mies van der Rohe under the auspices of the Werkbund, was a collection of dwellings for the city’s civil servants designed by avant-­garde architects from Austria, Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, as well as two generations of Germans, including both Gropius and Taut (Figure 1.8). The estate was located on a hilltop site less than two kilometers north of the train station (the Schocken store was south of the station), and there the utopian ambitions of Taut’s city crown were reconfigured relatively pragmatically in terms of a new style of upper middle-­class domesticity, brimming with the latest conveniences and comfortable enough in the case of Oud’s row houses to include rooms for live-­in servants.43 There was enormous interest in what became the defining moment in its crystallization. Half a million visitors came to view the exhibition held in the buildings before they were turned over to their inhabitants.44\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n29\n\nThe interior of the largest single contribution, Mies’s apartment block, gave an inkling of the way in which the same skeletal frames (here in steel rather than concrete) that enabled Gropius and Mendelsohn to glaze the exteriors of their buildings could be used as well to reconfigure interior space now that walls did not necessarily have to be load bearing. Mies wrote: I intend to try out the most varied plans in the apartment house. For the time being, I am building only the outside and the common walls, and inside each apartment only the two piers that support the ceiling. All the rest is to be as free as it possibly can be. If I could contrive to get some cheap plywood partitions made, I would treat only the kitchen and the bathroom as fixed spaces, and make the rest of the apartment variable, so that the spaces could be divided according to the needs of the individual tenant. This would have the advantage that it would make it possible to rearrange the apartment whenever family circumstances changes, without spending a lot of money on a conversion. Any carpenter, or any practically minded layman, would be able to shift the walls.45\n\nIn order to demonstrate this flexibility, the layouts of the twenty-­four different apartments in the building varied as much as possible, and different designers were charged with furnishing them. One was the work of Mies’s personal and professional partner, Lilly Reich (Figure 1.9). Although none of the “heroes” of the modern movement were female, a cluster of independently minded women eagerly adopted modern architecture and design in the 1920s as a means of both creative expression and professional achievement. Perhaps because few of the group led conventional personal lives, they, too, were written out of the story in the postwar period, when modernism’s message of social empowerment was recast to consist of the betterment of the working classes rather than the emancipation of women, with which it had arguably originally had just as much to do. The group, which also included Sonia Delaunay, Eileen Gray, and Charlotte Perriand in Paris, and the staff and students of the Bauhaus’s weaving workshop, of whom Gunta Stölzl and Anni Albers are the most renowned, played a crucial role in establishing austere but flexible alternatives to established bourgeois furnishing conventions and thus pioneered new forms of domesticity.46 Reich, already an experienced interior and exhibition designer when she designed this interior, wrote that “the vital thing, here as elsewhere, is to give expression to the mentality of the kind of woman who wants to be what she is, rather than to seem what she is not.”47 Unsurprisingly Reich’s apartment featured one of the most open of all the layouts. Besides the kitchen and bathroom, whose locations were fixed, there were only two distinct spaces, a living room with a large desk and a small dining alcove, and a bedroom, which was separated from a dressing area by a curtain. The latter featured a large mirror and small stool executed in tubular metal, which was the latest fashion,\n\n30\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\nFigure 1.9. Lilly Reich, interior, Weissenhof Estate. Copyright Bildarchiv Foto Marburg.\n\nwhile Reich set a more conventionally upholstered armchair and a large low cabinet against the far wall of the living room. The elegant understatement was typical of Reich, although the responsibility for the design of the individual pieces remains a matter of dispute, with attribution shared between her and Mies.48 Little was especially remarkable about many of the quite frankly generic components of the Weissenhof, several of which were designed by architects such as Victor Bourgeois, Josef Frank, Adolf Rading, and Adolf Gustav Schneck, who are now largely forgotten outside the lands in which they practiced. Yet this showcase for a relatively unified approach to architectural modernism covered a far narrower stylistic band than the New Building, much less the move toward an often archaic simplicity represented by Bonatz’s station. Instead of resembling a factory, as the Schocken store did, the sharp-­edged volumes of the Weissenhof dwellings looked machine made. Many of their components were indeed mass produced, as the exhibition doubled as a display of new construction systems. Mies had originally intended that a broader stylistic array of positions be represented, but Mendelsohn and Häring dropped out after a misunderstanding over whether he had planned to include them.49 One of the ramifications of their exclusion was an angry response from Bonatz, who as the city’s leading architect and the professor of its architecture\n\nMaking German Architecture Modern\n\n31\n\nschool, correctly saw his position being challenged, something Mendelsohn, who had eagerly sought and received his approval for the Schocken store, had assiduously avoided doing.50 The caricature of the Weissenhof as an Arab village can be traced to this disaffection, while the founding of the Congrès Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne the following year, which Häring and five of the seventeen Weissenhof architects (but not Mendelsohn) attended, helped crystallize the sense of an international avant-­garde focused on housing and planning issues, rather than a German group whose commercial commissions were often slotted with some sympathy into existing downtowns.51 The redefinition of modern architecture as the International Style, a term that would be popularized by the exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in 1932, helped preserve the parts of the Weissenhof that survived World War II. The tide began to shift relatively early. In 1958, only thirty-­one years after the units had been built and well in advance of comprehensive protection being extended to other modernist icons, the estate was designated a historic monument. Since that time it has been widely recognized in the scholarly literature and has become a significant local tourist attraction. In the 1980s it was comprehensively renovated.52 As Bonatz’s and Gropius’s support for Mendelsohn and Mies’s intention to include him in the Weissenhof demonstrate, the multiple modernisms present in Stuttgart by 1928 were not seen at the time as mutually exclusive. Indeed, Bonatz’s Graf Zeppelin Hotel, which was completed in 1931 and still stands across from the train station, closed much of the gap between him and the architects of the Weissenhof Estate as well as Mendelsohn. The fabric of a unitary interpretation has gradually unraveled, but while it held sway it limited the recognition of the way in which the postwar architecture in the Federal Republic was often grounded in the memory of the full range of modern architecture of the 1910s and 1920s. So, too, did the building type in which this memory would originally be most widely manifested. That so little physically remains of the buildings that are the subject of this chapter would suggest the appropriateness of the increasing focus on the history of modern architecture as seen through the lens of photography and of exhibitions.53 Certainly the understanding postwar architects had of the Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne was derived almost entirely from photographs, which is why Mendelsohn could so easily mistake van de Velde’s plaster building for concrete construction. Outstanding as the recent scholarship on the subject with specific relation to Mendelsohn’s Schocken store and the Weissenhof has been, it was not mediated images, however, but the experience of actual places that prompted students in Stuttgart in 1959 to mount a campaign to save the Schocken store, while an even more visceral attachment to place undoubtedly motivated the thousands who just over half a century later were teargassed by the same city’s riot police. Creating specific places in which people could remember the past at the same time that they used specific aspects of it to imagine a better future was integral to many of postwar Germany’s finest churches.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nTwo\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture West German Churches On 17 December 1961, Otto Dibelius, the bishop of Berlin, consecrated the reconstructed Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (Figure 2.1).1 More than a thousand people witnessed the proceedings. The chapel was not yet finished, nor was the sacristy, but enough had been achieved for the coupling of the new building by Egon Eiermann, one of the Federal Republic’s leading architects, and the ruins of the church that had been completed less than six decades earlier, to serve immediately as the symbol of West Berlin. The response of two very differently positioned voices gives a measure of the importance quickly accorded the structure. Within weeks the German architecture critic Ulrich Conrads gave a radio broadcast that was later republished first in the newspaper Die Zeit and then in Bauwelt, the weekly journal for the architecture profession and constructions trade that he edited. Conrads declared, “This is the first and only new church building in postwar Germany that—­in the entirely literal sense—­is a sign for the lost center [Mitte]: for the center of the old German capital.” Playing with the double meaning of Mitte (the word for “middle” was also the name of Berlin’s central district, which includes both the medieval core and its eighteenth-­century extensions, and which was at the time located on the other side of the Wall in Communist East Berlin), Conrads went on to say that it needed to serve as a substitute for and a memorial to this district. “This church building must itself be the Mitte, the economic and cultural focal point of the free Berlin.”2 Three years later the American photographer and architectural critic G. E. Kidder Smith commented: As stern sentries flanking and guarding the bomb-­shattered—­but to Berliners still precious—­r uins of the old church, this new nave and tower by Eiermann\n\n33\n\n34\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\nFigure 2.1.

Unrelentingly hard, taut as piano wires, they function magnificently as aesthetic and psychological statements—­a nd as counterpoints to the old tower. They might, indeed, be said to reflect the brave congregation they serve.3\n\nDedicated just over four months after the erection of the Berlin Wall cut West Berlin off from the rest of the city and the surrounding countryside, all of which were controlled by the Communist German Democratic Republic, and less than two months\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\n35\n\nFigure 2.2. Night view, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Source: Dr. Kralle/Wikipedia Commons.\n\nafter a dangerous standoff between American and Soviet tanks occurred at one of the new wall’s few crossing points, the Memorial Church served for the next three decades as the most prominent architectural emblem of the supposedly capitalist—­ but in fact heavily subsidized—­western half of the city.4 Emblazoned on stamps, and prominently featured in almost every guide to West Berlin, it also appears in the opening scene of Wings of Desire, Wim Wenders’s classic 1987 film.5 It stands at the beginning of the Kurfürstendamm, the boulevard that was West Berlin’s main commercial artery, where despite being a sacred building it doubled as a symbol of plenty. This was especially the case at night when its stained glass windows, illuminated from within, rhymed with the neon lighting of its commercial surroundings as well as with the head and tail lights of automobile traffic (Figure 2.2).6 Last but by no means least, the church made clear the contrast between the officially atheist German Democratic Republic and the overtly Christian Federal Republic and, by extension, West Berlin (West Berlin was officially governed by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States). In a letter to Pastor Günter Pohl, the head of the church’s building committee, Eiermann noted “the meaning and importance this church has for the whole Christian world.”7 The story of how the two halves of this building came to be the most prominent\n\n36\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\nCold War symbol of West Berlin and, by extension, of the free market and religious freedom of the Federal Republic is inseparable from the way in which two pasts were juxtaposed in a much larger series of postwar churches. Between 1946 and 1968 a distinctively West German sacred architecture emerged that paired memories of the modernism on display in Cologne in 1914 and (albeit to a lesser degree) in Stuttgart in the late 1920s with the forms, and often the literal stones, of earlier medieval and neomedievalist churches.8 Other examples of a much larger phenomenon include the Church of the Resurrection by Otto Bartning in Pforzheim (1946–­48), St. Anna in Düren by Rudolf Schwarz (1954–­56), and the Pilgrimage Church of Mary in Neviges by Gottfried Böhm (1963–­68). These buildings, and postwar German churches more generally, served as impressive architectural ambassadors for the Federal Republic, especially in the religious networks that assisted the country’s reintegration into the international community. Because they represented one of the most acceptable faces of the new country, they were also often showcased abroad in books and exhibitions targeted at architects as well as a more general public.9 The collage of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church’s original neo-­Romanesque building and its emphatically modernist—­but simultaneously firmly historicist—­ successor proved particularly important. In addition to being West Berlin’s most widely recognized edifice, it provided a key precedent for much of the most effective architecture erected in the reunified city during the 1990s and the first decade of the new millennium. Between 1940 and 1945 aerial bombardment and the Allied ground invasion reduced huge swaths of many German cities to rubble.10 As late as 1948 Bruno Taut’s brother, Max, also an architect, wrote Mies van der Rohe, after thanking him for a care packet of food: Rather than “intelligent” futuristic fantasies, I am interested above all in the present. I concentrate on how we can best and most quickly create a roof over our heads. The smallest and most modest task seems to me at the moment the most important, so that I cannot believe that we soon will be able to build as we used to. We are limited to the simplest construction. . . . Provisional buildings can naturally also be decent and seen from a civilized standpoint, and to a pleasing standard. I am really not against projecting and build also gladly “castles in the sky,” but one is not permitted to forget and neglect reality.11\n\nThe task of reconstructing West Germany’s war-­torn cities, which nominally included West Berlin, was an immense challenge.12 Much of the effort focused, as Taut predicted, simply on making habitable buildings.13 Deciding how much to adapt city plans that often dated back to the Middle Ages to the requirements of modern automobile traffic proved another major issue. In the wake of the bombastic state architecture of the Third Reich, it was not at all clear that the new Federal Republic estab-\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\n37\n\nlished in 1949 needed to be represented architecturally; that year Hans Schwippert converted a teacher training academy in Bonn into modest quarters for the new parliament.14 By the late 1950s the International Style, itself much transformed over the course of the previous three decades, was increasingly used for prestigious commissions, where it conveyed an antifascist and also an anticommunist message. This occurred, for instance, in the Interbau exhibition staged in West Berlin in 1957 and in the pavilion that Eiermann designed in collaboration with Sep Ruf for Expo 58, the world’s fair held in Brussels the following year.15 Walter Gropius, who had left Germany during the Third Reich for first London and then the United States, played an important role in these developments. He kept a close eye on the architectural scene in the Federal Republic and was acutely aware of the style’s utility both for Cold War propaganda and his own reputation.16 In the immediate aftermath of the war, however, this was decidedly a minority position. Like all those engaged in reconstruction, the bishops, priests, pastors, and congregations involved in the project of rebuilding and expanding the Federal Republic and West Berlin’s infrastructure of Catholic and Protestant houses of worship first had to decide when to build anew. Along with the rest of historic city centers, badly damaged centrally located historic churches were frequently rebuilt, albeit often in simplified form, particularly when it came to interior fittings. Those churches that had been erected in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in newer districts were not generally considered worthy of such respectful and expensive treatment.17 Although there had been a consensus in Werkbund circles by the outbreak of the First World War that most of this typically neo-­Gothic and neo-­ Romanesque architecture was outmoded, intact steeples from damaged churches were frequently retained. Parishes proved loath to sweep away what survived of these buildings, unpopular as they were with architects and most intellectuals to the left of center, which at the time churchgoers typically were not. In addition to replacing less historic churches, architects were also charged with the creation of thousands of new buildings. Some of these served congregations in new suburban districts, but others accommodated the influx of refugees from the east, as formerly Catholic regions suddenly absorbed large numbers of Protestants, and vice versa.18 In 1958 Jürgen Joedicke, the young architectural historian who would soon battle unsuccessfully to save the Schocken store in Stuttgart, wrote that more churches were built in Germany in the first years after the war than in the centuries since the Reformation.19 He summarized the character and the appeal of these mostly modest buildings: The church type of our time is no longer the cathedral but the small house of God. This change indicates a symptom of the churchly life: in place of an anonymous mass congregation, a small but active community meets, not only on Sundays for services, as is their conventional duty, but also as an expression of\n\n38\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\nan approach to living. This idea developed in Germany above all in the time of the church’s resistance during the thirties.20\n\nIn fact, neither Catholics nor Protestants had systematically opposed Nazism and this emphasis on community had deeper roots, but there was no denying the postwar effectiveness of this understanding of active community in fostering a healthier civic society.21 Churches, and particularly Catholic churches, served in Germany after both world wars as alternatives to discredited or destroyed national institutions.22 In the first years after World War II, Christian ideology provided a reassuring contrast in the Federal Republic to Nazi dictatorship as well as socialism and communism at a time when liberal democracy had not yet established deep roots. Church attendance soared in West Germany and West Berlin, as it did more generally in Western Europe. As Jörg Arnold describes, during the war as well as after, “The places of worship may have been destroyed in the air raid, but as a social network, the Church had survived, ready to assemble the dispersed parishioners around the word of God.”23 Its contribution encompassed both physical sustenance and emotional comfort. The church provided community and continuity with traditions that extended far further back in time than the Nazi regime, or indeed the memory of any single worshipper. Equally importantly it offered a sympathetic frame for coping with the suffering parishioners endured during both the war and its immediate aftermath. Describing the role of the Protestant church in postwar Nuremberg, the historian Neil Gregor writes, “Neither did the church confine itself to offering consolation, to endowing death with meaning or to giving expression to anguished hope. It also played a key role in the mobilization and articulation of public opinion, for which return of the prisoners of war was a central demand.”24 Furthermore, it “argued consistently for mercy” toward former Nazis and for the end of the war crimes trials.25 Josef Cardinal Frings, the archbishop of Cologne from 1942 to 1969, was particularly active in this regard. In 1951, for instance, he advocated a Christmas amnesty. For the Catholic leadership, who were nearly as suspicious of liberal capitalism as of Marxist alternatives to it, the problem with Nazism was above all that it was a manifestation of modern materialism. In its place, they emphasized an integration of family, church, and state that they believed to be unique to the Christian West (the usual term for which was Abendland) in buildings the character of which space was more important than the richness or detailing of their material surfaces. This provided a viable if profoundly conservative social structure for a postfascist society, while allowing those who adopted it to evade any meaningful discussion of the degree to which those who were not devout German Christians had suffered far more at the hands of the Third Reich.26 In the first postwar decades the West German Catholic Church in particular enjoyed a more prestigious position than it had been able to claim since the unifica-\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\n39\n\ntion of Germany in 1871, or—­in the case of the Rhineland—­since the French invasion of 1794. Although until 1932 the Catholic Center Party participated in all of the governments of the Weimar Republic, its role compensated only partially for the marginalized position of Catholics in Second Empire Prussia, especially during the Kulturkampf of the 1870s, when Bismarck temporarily imposed restrictive legislation that resulted in many bishops and priests being imprisoned or exiled.27 The establishment of the Federal Republic in 1949 saw a shift in the political and religious leadership of the truncated country away from Prussia’s Protestant heartland and toward the Catholic Rhineland. The churches in which memory was integrated into modern architecture featured in this chapter were to some degree the architectural equivalent of the political party that commanded the loyalty of most of those involved in commissioning and designing them, even as those churches also involved the displacement to built form of issues not often openly addressed by politicians. From the founding of the state in 1949 until the election of a Social Democratic government led by Willy Brandt twenty years later, the Christian Democrats held the chancellorship and dominated the government of the Federal Republic. Under the leadership of Konrad Adenauer, who served as chancellor until 1963, they and their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union, adopted a pragmatic stance, adopting democracy without confronting any more than was absolutely necessary the compromised past of many of their members, government employees, and the larger society (the diplomatic corps, judiciary, and medical profession were particularly tainted).28 Despite the sympathy former Nazis could expect from him Cardinal Frings was similarly engaged in establishing the foundations of a profoundly conservative but by no means fascist regime. Like Adenauer, Frings, who was one of the ten men who served on the presidium for the Second Vatican Council, sought to embed the new republic in international institutions that provided a compelling alternative to generations of German nationalism. After the war, despite the Catholic prohibition on the clergy’s participation in political activity, Frings indicated his support by briefly joining the new party. He retreated from secular politics only once he had ensured that the state would generously fund the two established churches, one Catholic and one Protestant.29 This money was key to the prominent role church construction played in the architecture of the Federal Republic in the 1950s and 1960s.30 With most West Germans paying church tax, during the years of the so-­called economic miracle both denominations were amply equipped to build. Although most new churches were not designed in an emphatically modern style, those that were garnered the lion’s share of publicity. West Germany’s most striking new churches were modern, but they were not examples of the International Style, which Schwarz specifically attacked as a template for postwar building in the so-­called Bauhaus Debate of 1953. Although almost all of modern architecture’s most vocal supporters assumed that it\n\n40\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\nwas uniquely appropriate for functions associated specifically with modernity, it instead proved particularly effective in serving an institution oriented toward eternity. Catholic architects like Schwarz and Böhm, whose work was increasingly published in Germany in equal measure alongside that of their Protestant counterparts such as Bartning and Eiermann, were acknowledged to have taken the lead in developing a more consistently impressive balance between the new forms apparently mandated by new building materials and—­a lthough it was seldom mentioned—­low budgets at a time of rising wages for construction labor on the one hand, and the emphasis on the creation of community through the organization of space that had long been Bartning’s and Schwarz’s forte on the other.31 Within modernism, the most important precedent for the new churches was Bruno Taut’s experiments, including the Glashaus, with city crowns. Even more architects drew upon the solidity of Stuttgart’s main train station, although by the late 1950s, the popularity of this model was challenged by enthusiasm for the plasticity of the Werkbund Theater. The overtly industrial aesthetic of the Model Factory, the Stuttgart Schocken store, and the Weissenhof Housing Estate—­d ifferent as they were from one another—­played almost no role. Instead these churches paired expressionist utopianism, now channeled away from political revolution and toward the creation of communally expressed spirituality, as well as stripped of the starkly functional form the New Building had taken during the brief economic boom of 1924–­29, with the respectfully exhibited residue of the nationalism of the Second Empire and of more recent German suffering. This architecture served, as the grassroots movement to force Eiermann to preserve the ruined stump of the original Memorial Church steeple demonstrates, as much to honor the Second as neutralize the Third Reich. After all, many of those involved in building these churches remembered the years 1871 to 1914 fondly; it had been a time of bourgeois prosperity, if not of strictly democratic government (there was universal manhood suffrage, but the power of the Reichstag was carefully circumscribed with the chancellor being appointed by the emperor). This approach to fusing two architectures of the past was not in the beginning implicitly progressive or even necessarily democratic. It acquired these associations only gradually, as the Economic Miracle helped the new government acquire legitimacy and stability. This period is often characterized as one devoid of memory, and yet when one turns to architecture that is emphatically not the case.32 Instead one finds embedded in the overtly modernist designs of Catholic as well as Protestant churches of this period references to the Middle Ages, to the neo-­medievalism of the Second Empire, to the multiple modernisms of the early twentieth century, and to the damage wrought by the Second World War. What is almost entirely absent, however, is any acknowledgment of precisely that which made many later examples of the modernist evocation of the past so powerful: the articulation of the consequences of the Third Reich for anyone other than German gentile civilians. That would take time.\n\nInserting Memory into Modern Architecture\n\n41\n\nThe Church of the Resurrection in Pforzheim The Church of the Resurrection in Pforzheim was aptly named as it was the first Protestant church completed in postwar Germany (Figure 2.3). The prototype for forty-­three more emergency churches Bartning erected according to similar principles in both the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic, it descended directly from the experiments the architect had made during the Weimar Republic with a reformed church architecture but took less radical form. In particular, Bartning’s decision to clad the building with stones taken from the ruins of what was one of Germany’s most badly bombed cities established a sense of both literal and metaphoric continuity with a more stable past, while acknowledging the violence that had taken place.33 A contemporary account declared, “The first new church building in Germany has grown directly out of the desertification and emergency of the borderland in Baden in the last months of the war.”34 Although Bartning designed the Church of the Resurrection from the inside out, the facade also mattered. Here we find the same sense of understated monumentality that characterizes Stuttgart’s main train station, which then as now links Pforzheim, less than fifty kilometers to the west, with Zurich and Munich to the south and east, respectively. Anchored by a squat tower added in 1954, the church sits on a slightly elevated position close to the corner of a block-­long residential street just beyond the city center. This area was relatively protected from the bombing raid that on 22 February 1945 leveled 80 percent of the city’s buildings and killed a third of its population.35 The stone exterior walls, which incorporate decorative fragments from an assortment of mostly unidentified prewar buildings, including Gothic churches, provide a com"
