        "text": "Like any artist who produces a work of utter brilliance, an architect who designs a truly great building is forever after constrained by it. Not only in the obvious way - does what comes along later measure up to the triumph? - but in a more subtle way, too, in the expectation that all future work will somehow continue to explore the same themes as the great achievement.\n\nJames Stirling and Michael Wilford face this difficult problem with every building they have designed since the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, West Germany, their five-year-old museum that may well be the most mature monument post-modernism has produced. The Stuttgart museum is a remarkable building that at once summarizes the history of 20th-century architecture and spurs it on, both a dazzling celebration of classicism and an inversion of it.\n\nWhat can Mr. Stirling and Mr. Wilford do to top this? Nothing, and the only fair thing to expect of them is that they will move on, pushing their considerable talents in fresh directions. But for all we believe this to be right, it is difficult to look at a building like their latest structure, the Cornell University Center for the Performing Arts, and not think back to Stuttgart. And there the Cornell building disappoints, not because it is not good - it is a skillful essay in the same idiosyncratic mix of inventively abstracted historical form and industrial elements as most of Mr. Stirling and Mr. Wilford's other work of the last few years - but because it does not send the emotions soaring in quite the same way.\n\nA cluster of marble- and stucco-clad boxes with pitched roofs, a central belfry tower, and an indoor and outdoor loggia running its entire length, the building at Cornell is Mr. Stirling and Mr. Wilford's most controlled and most restrained structure of recent years. It is also their largest completed American work to date. I would hope that these two facts have nothing to do with each other, since it would be unfortunate if James Stirling, unquestionably one of the great design talents of our time, were holding in his reins for his American clients.\n\nI think it is more a matter of the actual circumstances of the Cornell building, which was built on a difficult site and completed on an unusually tight budget - $16.8 million, or $148 per square foot. Getting a full proscenium theater, two experimental theaters, a dance performance space, and several studios, rehearsal halls and classrooms for that money, as Cornell did, would be an achievement even if there were no architecture at all.\n\nAnd there is plenty of architecture here. It is only, as I said, that this is not Stuttgart, or even the Clore Gallery, Mr. Stirling and Mr. Wilford's addition to the Tate Gallery in London that arouses intense emotion, both pro and con, in nearly everyone who sees it. Visitors to Cornell are not likely to feel the same degree of passion for this building; the performing arts center is a kind of stripped-down Stirling, a building with the razzle and not the dazzle. (Part of it is the palette here - the wild greens and magentas that have been used as accents in many of Mr. Stirling's other recent buildings are absent this time. Has the architect gone timid? Or is he just trying to show us that vivid color never meant as much to him as some critics suggested?) The one thing about the Cornell building that could be called spectacular is the way Mr. Stirling, Mr. Wilford and their associate architects, the New York City firm of Wank Adams Slavin, have managed to make it a bridge between town and gown. The Performing Arts Center is technically just over the border of the campus in Collegetown, a funky (and rapidly gentrifying) commercial village that sits just outside the Cornell gates. A site like this could be an invitation to the worst kind of institutional arrogance: a monumental building plopped down on an otherwise modest streetscape.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
