        "text": "Sir James Stirling (born April 22, 1926, Glasgow, Scotland—died June 25, 1992, London, England) was a British architect known for his unorthodox, sometimes controversial, designs of multiunit housing and public buildings.\n\nStirling received his architectural training at the University of Liverpool’s School of Architecture (1945–50). He began practice in the early 1950s in London and from 1956 to 1963 was in partnership with James Gowan. From 1971 he worked with Michael Wilford. His early work was mainly low-rise housing projects in the New Brutalist style, which emphasized exposures of raw steel and brick and the conscious avoidance of polish and elegance. Stirling’s Engineering Department building for the University of Leicester (1959–63) is perhaps his most important work in this idiom.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nArtists, Painters, & Architects"
