        "meta_description": "The publication of Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture in 1964 signaled the end of Modernism. The reality was that the modern movement had already jettisoned its ideological underpinnings and had become merely another ‘style.’ The avant garde architects in Europe and in North America were ready to move on and saw Postmodernism as a liberating antidote to the strictures of high Modernism. Historic architectural styles, which had been vilified as antiquated and out of step with modern culture, were revived, reinterpreted, and manipulated. However, Postmodernism, which had burned brightly during the 1970s and 1980s, was superseded by other architectural movements, namely, Deconstructivism, Pluralism, during the waning years of the 12th century. Even though new building forms and design theory changed during Postmodernism, building technology remained the same. Exterior walls continued to be built as skins, comprised of either glass, masonry, metal, or synthetic cladding, which were hung of steel or concrete framing. Rubberised membranes covered essentially flat roofs. Moisture infiltration was managed in ever complex composite wall assemblies. More important, environmental systems decoupled nature from interiors and were designed to manage ever demanding humidity control requirements. Through the development of new building technology, Modernism severed design style from traditional construction. In re-introducing historical forms back into architecture, Postmodernism complicated constructability. Moreover, Postmodernism and its successors rarely developed new technological ideas by introducing more intricate building forms, which were based on theoretical ideas rather than technical ones, while continuing to employ Modernism building technology into their buildings. This inherent paradox is the most consequential challenge in preserving Postmodernism. Today, approximately 40 years after its inception, we must consider if, in some cases. is it tenable to preserve Postmodern buildings? This paper reassesses three museums of the Postmodern era through the twin lenses of historic preservation and their legacy as cultural artifacts. It analyses how three iconic Postmodern museums, the Wexner Centre for the Arts in the USA, the Neue Staatsgalerie in Germany, and the Hedmark Museum in Norway, became cultural artifacts and how each of them present technical challenges for their future preservation. These museums represent late 20th century theoretical ideas, which were more a melding of pluralistic influences than design ideology, and the utilisation of Modernist technology. All of which present unique conditions for conservation.",

        "text": "Museums, concert halls, and theaters are among the most significant cultural institutions and, by their nature, should be maintained and preserved for posterity. Classically designed buildings constructed of durable materials seldom go out of style; hence, they transcend their own epoch. The question is: what happens when style trumps constructability? When buildings become expendable commodities subject to changing trends, they become tropes that lose continuity with the past and their purpose and inevitable preservation become questionable.\n\nThe Wexner Centre for the Performing Arts at Ohio State University and the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany were critically acclaimed for their avant garde, postmodern designs when they were opened to the public. They represented the epitome of architectural art where design trumps technology. In contrast, the Hedmark Museum at Hamar, Norway preserves the archeology of the Bishopric ruins and the display of its artifacts. Built over the course of three decades, it exemplifies the timelessness of thoughtful design realised through organic materials and points the way toward preserving the past with sustainable architecture.\n\n5.1 Wexner Centre for the Arts\n\nDesigned by Peter Eisenman in 1989, the Wexner Centre for the Arts (the Wexner) at The Ohio State University (OSU) (Fig. 1) was dubbed by critic Paul Goldberger ‘The Museum that Theory Built’ (Goldberger 1989). A contemporary art laboratory, it was one of the first deconstructivist buildings to be built in the U.S. (Grimberg 2012). Deconstructivism is a postmodern style that exhibits fragmentation and distortion of structure, as if taking a coherent building apart and then chaotically reassembling it. To concentrate attention on his formal investigations, Eisenman has adapted a revision of the International Style that he calls ‘cardboard architecture’ (Fig. 2) (Gebhard and Nevins 1977).\n\nBuildings continuously experience different types of deterioration, including aging, weathering, and depletion by use (Jokilehto 2007). The level of building wear depends on structure, materials, and maintenance, so repair techniques may vary as a consequence based on diffferent beuilding cultures and technologies. The Wexner Centre was constructed around a structural steel frame, providing a ‘scaffold’ on which other materials are then applied.\n\nShortly after it was opened, the Wexner began having problems due to its complicated construction (Jones 1990). Too much light entered the building for the exhibit of art. Heating and cooling systems were inefficient in the 1980s. Furthermore, the detailing of complex tubular steel scaffolding and volumetric building masses were never completely resolved (Ohio History Central 2021; Pogrebin 2005).\n\nThe Wexner Centre uses an Exterior Insulation Finishing System (EIFS), which is rigid insulation coated with a thin layer of stucco for exterior cladding (Fig. 3). EIFS is relatively inexpensive and, because it combines both insulation and exterior finish, reduces construction time and costs. However, it can be easily damaged allowing water to infiltrate behind the panels. Other problems include incorrect selection or application of sealants, or missing sealants, which provides an easy path for water entry and premature deterioration. A base coat that is too thin provides insufficient waterproofing protection, whereas a base coat that is too thick may lead to cracking (Sanders and Robinson 2014).\n\nIn the midwest, where temperatures can vary seasonally by 100 °F (38 °C) or more, water will freeze during the winter and thaw as temperatures rise in the spring causing separation of the stucco from the insulation of the panels and oxidation of the metal hardware that anchors the panels.\n\nThe gridded steel scaffolding around the building and the skylighted ‘spine’ along its main circualtion axis are exposed to the elements inviting multiple problems related to thermal expansion between the steel framework and glazing as well as between the building and the scaffolding. Other issues include a leaky roof caused by the crooked intersection of planes, and material issues at other areas in the building. Skylights let in too much direct sunlight, causing damage to artwork in galleries and temperature fluctuations of up to 40 degrees indoors (Grimberg 2012). Thermal bridgingFootnote 6 caused by the emergence of the steel spine at the entrance of the building allows cold air to migrate through the structure into the building during winter months. Thermal bridging can be prevented by breaking the connection between outdoor and indoor componets, but Eisenman, who is a formalist, was not concerned with the Wexner Centre’s ‘technical issues’: ‘There’s not an architect I know that doesn’t have problems with important buildings’ (Pogrebin 2005).\n\nHuman comfort and function are the primary reasons for constructing buildings. Yet, Eisenman placed less emphasis on these important design factors in favor of formal manipulations of grids and interior spaces to ‘unsettle’ perceptions of the building (Langdon 2014). This objective is candidly embraced by the OSU administration, which values the Wexner Centre’s ‘daring design’ (Wex 2021).\n\nThe Wexner Centre includes a theater, art galleries, and studios each requiring different lighting, acoustical, and mechanical environmental control systems (Fig. 4). The efficiencies of these systems are constantly changing so they need upgrading and replacement as they wear out. Humidity and constant temperatures must be maintained throughout the building, especially in art galleries. Thus, maintaining and replacing the Wexner Centres mechanical systems is also costly.\n\nThe Wexner site was originally occupied by the Armory Building that was razed (Fig. 2). Eisenmann reconstituted its foundation and its red-brick turrets as Postmodern ruins.Footnote 7 One of the turrets is sliced by the grid shift with the two halves offset from one another. The re-imagined brick-clad remnants of the Armory Building are also a nod to the traditional red brick buildings that dominate the OSU campus, whereas the aggressive steel grid armatures that interpose on interior spaces sets it apart. The slicing of the turrets invites more problems with water infiltration, uneven settlement of foundations between the turrets and other building elements, and deterioration of the brick cladding due to spalling of the brick surfaces, as a result of water damage, and effervescence of the mortar joints resulting from leaching of the lime from the mortar itself.\n\nThe amalgam of elements and quotations give the building a collage-like feeling reflected in Eisenman’s drawings and supported by the jury’s observations that ‘the design proposal affirms the interactive roles of memory and invention as catalysts for the visual arts’ by provoking speculation and uncertainty. Thus, he coyly integrates occupants’ experiences of the building with its campus environment while simultaneously making the users aware of its formal manipulations thus dislocating it in space and time.\n\nEnticing ‘star architects’ to design buildings on college campuses often faces universities with considerable debt and long-term operational and maintenance expenses. Most of these ‘signature campus buildings’ cripple universities with unwelcome deferred maintenance expenses that were uncommon with buildings built during the first half of the 20th century. Furthermore, once the architect leaves, the academic community is left to deal with the fallout of buildings that don’t just ignore their surrounding contexts, but also frequently overlook basic construction principles.Footnote 8 As Phil Myrick writes: ‘Billions of dollars go into building facilities that hide their assets behind blank walls. If a tiny part of the investment was directed to bringing the building program to the outside, it would make a vast difference on people’s experience of the campus’ (Walljasper 2008; Project for Public Spaces 2015).\n\nWorking with Arup Engineers, the university spent $15.8 million to retrofit the building—one third the original cost of the building—specifying that the goal was to preserve its original integrity (Levine 2021). Eventually, the rate of disrepair may exceed the cost and time dedicated to the maintenance of the overall building complicating its long-term value and, ultimately, its sustainability.\n\n5.2 The Neue Staatsgalerie\n\nThe Neue Staatsgalerie, designed by British architects James Stirling and Michael Wilford in 1984, is conceived both as a ruin and as an ‘inside-outside’ building (Fig. 5). Repeated bombings of Stuttgart by Allied Forces during World War II had left the remnants of many buildings as burnt out shells. The consequences of the war and defeat left the German people physically scarred, economically weakened, and psychologically humiliated (Barkin and Sheehan 2021). Its cultural and psychic ‘fragments’ are expressed by the architectural fragments of the Neue Staatsgalerie.\n\nThe competition brief emphasised the urgency of restoring the spatial and historical continuity of the urban fabric by enhancing pedestrian movement. The program included three components: 1) an expansion of the Staatsgalerie, 2) a new theater building, and 3) a music school building. Contextualising the museum into Stuttgart’s urban fabric and history was an imperative in the design so that ‘the new building should contribute to the historical significance of the area by way of establishing relationships with other historical buildings’ (Filler 1984). Stirling combined the traditional design elements of Classical 19th Century museums with modern, complimentary industrial materials that would ultimately invoke the timeless, yet ever-evolving essence of art and architecture (Kroll 2011). Each function is represented by different volumes organised on two levels that conform to the terrain of the site (Fig. 6) (Glusberg 1993).\n\nThe Neue Staatsgalerie is clad in horizontal bands of thin-cut stone veneer applied over a steel structure. Some critics compare the layout of the floor plan of the Neue Staatsgalerie to Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s Altes Museum in Berlin with a centralised rotunda surrounded by galleries and services.8 The ‘rotunda’ of the Neue Staatsgalerie forms an exterior courtyard wrapped by a spiraling ramp that leads the visitor through the site and into the museum. Sculptural building elements, glass-and-steel canopies, and undulating walls of glass gather light into the interior corridors and galleries.Footnote 9\n\nAs the Staatsgallerie ages its continued historical and cultural value must be reassessed against the real costs of operation, maintenance and eventual restoration. Stirling’s early buildings included the History and Faculty Building at Cambridge, completed in 1968 where he and partner James Gowan struggled to study alternately freezing/overheating greenhouse, poor acoustics, frequent leaks and falling cladding tiles, which ‘incubated a deep loathing of the building’ (Saint 2011). In 1984 the pro-Stirling critic Reyner Banham wrote that ‘anyone will know who keeps up with the English highbrow weeklies…the only approvable attitude to James Stirling is one of sustained execration and open or veiled accusations of incompetence’ (Moore 2011). Fortunately, when Stirling began building in Germany, the building industry seemed better equipped to realise his ambitious ideas.\n\nThe composition of the Neue Staatsgalerie, while generally viewed favorably, distorts the traditional understanding of the building as complete, singular idea. Buildings of this genre become a ‘bricolage’ of recognisable figures: a kind of pastiche or blank, empty parody (Jameson 1983; Maulden 1986). It is a series of contextual integrations with the site as well as periods of art and design. Traditional building materials, such as travertine and sandstone, are combined with colored industrial steel throughout the museum that meld its postmodern expression with historical references.Footnote 10\n\nThe material palette of polychrome thin-cut stone organised in horizontal striations, brightly painted steel mullions, canopies and funnels, and undulating walls of tinted glass produces a layered pastiche superimposed over a structural steel armature concealed within. While stone has historically been a load bearing material and highly regarded by preservationists for its natural beauty and durability, thin-cut stone is non-load bearing and is applied over rigid insulation supported by steel or aluminum studs. Lightweight coping stone capping the tops of walls with caulk sealants invites long term moisture and maintenance problems. The primary concerns with the veneer system included flaking of the stone veneer (delamination from the stone surface) falling off the building onto the ground below, some areas of large separations at mortar joints (reportedly increasing in size despite some efforts at previous repair), and progressive movement and deflection of stone veneer above openings (Ahuja, Verhulst, and Noble 2006).\n\nEmbedding the building in the sloping site increases the likelihood of moisture migration into the building through retaining walls and controlling humidity within the galleries. Remediating moisture problems in the future will require excavating around most of the building adding to its preservation costs. Humidity levels in museums and art galleries are notoriously difficult to maintain consistently. The constant influx of people through a room cause the temperature and humidity to fluctuate. Maintenance is also an issue as HVAC equipment will need to be maintained frequently due to the long operating hours. Anything that is costly to maintain will quickly become very expensive (Gates 2021).\n\nPainted steel-and-glass canopies, skylights, exterior steel railings and ornamentation require regular maintenance. Skylights inevitably will leak due to failure of neoprene gaskets that get brittle as they age and will require replacement. Other details, such as openings created by ‘missing’ stone veneer blocks are likely to be avenues for water and ice problems as well as accumulation of detritus.\n\nThe undulating glass curtainwall of the Nueu Staatsgalerie will have to be replaced when its gas-filled thermal panes fail. Curtain walls are a form of exterior cladding that do not support floor or roof loads—they ‘hang’ off of the building structure like a curtain. These glazed systems form an integral part of the building enclosure; and as such, they must be designed and constructed to achieve various structural and nonstructural performance requirements, such as the following:\n\n1.\n\nWater penetration resistance;\n\n2.\n\nAir infiltration resistance;\n\n3.\n\nStructural adequacy (transfer all loads back to building structure);\n\n4.\n\nEnergy efficiency;\n\n5.\n\nAesthetics;\n\n6.\n\nDurability and maintainability.\n\nMoisture problems are likely to occur when the flashing between the stone veneer and curtain wall do not connect or seal (McCowan and Kivela 2010).\n\nMasonry System 7 (Fig. 7) is a rainscreen system with a steel-framed wall structure and adhered stone or masonry veneer suitable for many applications including low- or mid-rise residential, and commercial buildings, as well as buildings such as the Neue Staatsgalerie. The water control layer is a continuous control layer that is designed and installed to act as the innermost boundary against water intrusion and as an air barrier (National Masonry Systems Guide 2022). The adhered masonry veneer with grouted joints sheds most water it is exposed to; however, some moisture is expected to penetrate the cladding and enter the rainscreen cavity. This moisture is drained through the cavity by the continuous Z-girts that support the cladding or through the drainable, semi-rigid insulation. Masonry units are bonded to a crack isolation membrane over a cement backer board and non-metal or intermittent metal-based cladding support clips. The steel-framed backup wall will experience little volume change; however, some movement may occur where studs interface with floor and roof lines. As a result, both horizontal and vertical movement joints are needed to accommodate differential movement between the structure, cladding support system, and veneer components to prevent damage to the veneer or other components.\n\nAdvantages of stone cladding include its natural beauty, extreme durability and long lifespan, extensive range of stone types, complements other materials such as concrete and timber, offers a variety of finish options for. Wide range of applications, provides a high level of thermal mass contributing to reduced heating and cooling loads, and weather resistant especially when coated with moisture repellent sealers. Disadvantages include higher construction costs due to increased structural substrate, labor-intensive to install, expensive cladding material, and can trap moisture behind the material if poorly installed (Eco Outdoor 2021).\n\nEven though most of ventilated claddings façades perform reasonably, some anomalies have appeared over the last few decades, such as deterioration of appearance, fracture, arching and falling of stone slabs, therefore causing durability and security problems (Sousa and Sousa 2019; Loughran 2006). According to inspections performed on several buildings with natural stone cladding façades, these problems seem more related to design and execution errors and environmental actions (Neto and de Brito 2012). One of the most uncommon anomalies is the bowing of marble slabs, which is characterised by a permanent large deflection accompanied strength decay of the slabs, causing them to fall from the façades (Loughran 2006; Akesson, Schouenborg, and Grelk 2006; Siegesmund, Ruedrich, and Koch 2008).\n\nThe Neue Staatsgalerie’s postmodern pedigree is evident in the artful way that Stirling combined many styles and elements from historical museums into a modern piece of architecture that connects the public with its culture. In its fragmentation and apparent incompleteness, it can variously be perceived as a ruin or as a contemporary addition to an historical building within a dense urban fabric. The fact that it is a contextualised meta-narrative set within the urban fabric of Stuttgart, the cultural history of modern Germany, and its draw as a tourist attraction make it a likely candidate for preservation, but Stirling’s arrogance predicating design over constructability and his checkered reputation for designing buildings that don’t work bring even his most prestigious buildings into question.\n\n5.3 Hedmark Museum\n\nDaniel Willis points out that in pre-modern societies the goal was not geometric perfection, but to privilege meaning over utility and sustainability over efficiency (Willis 1999). Vernacular architecture, therefore, is inefficient because it combines pre-industrial production practices with the will to imbue its creations with an aura of significance. Critical Regionalism, which juxtaposes vernacular building forms and practices with modern technologies and materials, creates a new and provocative dialect that both affirms and critiques the historical interpretations and meanings of architecture from within by re-contextualising them in through the auspices of modernism (Tzonis and Lefaivre 1996; Frampton 1996).\n\nThe Hedmark Museum in Hamar, Norway (1967–2005), also known as the Storhamar Barn, is one of Sverre Fehn’s best known works (Fig. 8). The main architectural objective was to create a museum from to preserve what remains of Hamar Bishopric and Storhamarlaven and make it possible for the excavation of the site to be an important feature. The answer for Fehn is the ‘suspended museum’ allowing he public to experience history brought alive through archeology (Norberg-Schulz 1979).\n\nOne of the elements that makes a place truly beautiful is a careful balance of complexity and simplicity. Contemporary architecture frequently just goes for the simplicity and forgets the complexity, or it makes up for the simplicity of its appearance with complexity in the technical processes necessary to build it. But the old buildings that please us most are frequently simple at the larger level and complex at the micro-level (Rennix and Robinson 2017). Created over a period spanning almost 40 years, the Hedmark Museum involves the recovery of the ruins of an ancient fortified house built by a local bishop of the 12th century. He deftly inserted the timber-frame and glass components of the new museum addition into the original building shell barely touching the remains of its constructive legacy. The original U-shaped building forms a central court shared with the foundations of primitive farm buildings (Fig. 9). An ethnographic museum occupies the original cowshed while the west wing houses Nordic cultural artifacts. Administrative services and an auditorium are also incorporated within the existing ruins creating an interesting dialogue between the history of the site and its modern additions.\n\nA succession of ramps, stairways, and hallways allow the visitor to contemplate both the remains of the original building and the installed artifacts. A long, curved ramp lifts the visitor through the courtyard and into the building in a kind of journey into the past where artifacts recovered from the site have been carefully restored and placed on a collection of stands and pedestals reminiscent of the detailing of Italian architect Carlo Scarpa.\n\nFehn’s objective was to preserve and protect the archeological integrity of the ruined buildings with interventions of new elements constructed of concrete, wood, steel, and glass to convey an ‘intimate and poetic’ message by means of a modern aesthetic (Fehn 1997). He contrasts the visual weight and rough textures of the original load-bearing stone walls with milled timber-frame posts and trusses that support a new roof structure punctured with sky lights (Fig. 10). Delicate steel pin connections supporting the massive timbers produce a visual tension between the weight of the wood and the relative lightness of the steel, which is also echoed in the detailing of the stands and pedestals supporting artifacts. The interweaving of old and new elements reveals the characteristics of the rural culture of Norway, with special emphasis on ethnography, religion, and history through beautifully presented and illuminated objects (Fig. 9) (Barbam 2013).\n\nEssentially, Hedmark is by-and-large an open-air museum, which means that the architect could focus on circulation, functional layout of galleries, preserving and protecting the existing archeological structures and the site, and designing the display of artifacts. Fehn had to address neither indoor comfort of inhabitants nor mechanical interior climate controls for the artifacts. Technical assessment of the museum, therefore, is based on his primary responsibility: preserving and protecting the archelogy of the site.\n\nFehn’s material pallet is reduced to basic, durable materials: timber for structural framing; concrete for earth-bound walls and circulation ramp and elevated walkways; and, steel for brackets connecting timber components, handrails, and pedestals and armatures for display of artifacts. These materials both complement and contrast with the existing stone archeological structures creating a potent interplay between the artifacts of the site and its modern interventions.\n\nNatural materials such as stone and wood age well and develop patinas that enhance their inherent characteristics. Timber has been used in buildings for millennia and is a good choice structurally for its strength, durability, fire resistance, and weathering characteristics. It is also a renewable resource, which makes it sustainable. Timber frames can be the most suitable choice if the structural shell is required quickly, if the ground conditions are particularly poor, or if the design does not include very large structural spans (Designing Buildings 2021).\n\nTraditionally, timber frames were connected using mortises and tenons joined by wood pegs. Water is the enemy of all buildings and especially of wood structures. Over time, they will rot if not properly maintained and the wood pegs in timber frame buildings will ultimate deteriorate causing connections to fail. While this method is still used by craftsmen, many modern timber frame buildings, such as the Hedmark Museum, are highbred structures that use steel brackets, gusset plates, and bolts to join together wood components.\n\nHistoric timber framed buildings used the heartwood from a variety of species of trees ranging from pines and firs to hardwoods such as oak. However, faster growing trees with less grain density are often harvested and used for timber construction today resulting in less structural integrity. Poor drying techniques can also lead to checking, twisting, warping, and other undesirable characteristics. Another option, is to use laminated posts, beams, and trusses. These can be produced by sandwiching together smaller pieces of wood together bonded with an adhesive. Laminated timbers are structurally stable, re-use waste materials, and are aesthetically pleasing when they are combined with modern materials and fabrication methods. Of course, wood must always be protected and routinely maintained when exposed to natural elements. At Hamar, the wood structure supports a sheltering roof that shields the structure, interior spaces and artifacts from the weather. In a sense, the Hedmark Museum is both on archeological exhibit and an act of preservation of both old and new elements.\n\nFehn created architecture which had a firm foundation in the Modern Movement, but was expressed in terms of the materials and language of their own region and time. ‘When I build on a site in nature that is totally unspoiled,’ he wrote, ‘I strive to make a building that will make people more aware of the beauty of the setting, and when looking at the building in the setting, a hope for a new consciousness to see the beauty there, as well’ (Michalarou 2021). His ‘constructive thought’ reunites the world and spatialises time through construction in a ‘new synthesis endowed with an innate sense of origins and timeless principles’ (Fjeld 1983; Norberg-Schulz 1979; Fehn 1997). Cook (1981) describes Hamar as ‘a poised machine in its purest form hanging above the archaeology’ and says that ‘we are unused to a building that collages together devices, as in the tradition of the clockmaker, so that they seem naturally interdependent.’\n\nThe Hedmark Museum, therefore, is both an intervention of new architectural elements and preservation of the existing archeology of the original building remnants. In essence, the new architecture preserves and protects the old while forming an intricate dialogue between past and present, artifact and nature. Unlike the Wexner Centre and the Staatsgallerie, the Hedmark Museum is not a formalistic response to interpreting a site, but rather a poetic and practical and unpretentious adaptation of traditional material and craft-based sensibilities. This approach not only ensures the preservation of the archeological site, but also the continued viability of the new building elements that are an authentic manifestation of craft and material cultural. With his poetic vision Fehn demonstrates that all architecture that strives to express the authentic must include an ethos of place and time."
