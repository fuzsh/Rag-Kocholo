I have written on both of them; so, although the book before you is a work of the past five years, it has been longer in the making as, for some time, I have wanted to draw these surface-strands together into a critical narrative. Although it is not possible to summarize the debts I have incurred in a quarter-century of pondering these matters, here I would wish to thank the following: Mhairi McVicar and Charles Drozynski, the conference we organized together at the Welsh School of Architecture, Cardiff University, on Generosity and Architecture (June 2018), was an early opportunity to air thoughts on the layered surfaces of William Morris and Philip Webb – aspects published in my chapter in our edited book of that conference, Generosity and Architecture. Sandra Kemp, Thomas Hughes, and Kelly Freeman for the invitation to contribute to the timely ‘Ruskin and Ecology’ seminar (The Ruskin, February 2019); in that forum, I tested my thoughts on Ruskin’s wall-veil – again in the context of Morris and Webb, with the ensuing publication of a chapter in Ruskin’s Ecologies (Hughes and Freeman, eds., 2021). Owen Hopkins and Frances Sands who, as Soane curators (June 2019), hosted the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain symposium on ‘Architecture and Light’, allowing me to explore ideas on the ‘Savage’ shadows, and shadows of ‘Refinement’, of Street and Bodley. The Welsh School of Architecture, Cardiff University, for personal research grants towards the cost of archive and field work. The many archivists, librarians, and estate-holders, who have assisted in sourcing materials, permissions, and images, especially those of the collections I have used most. The Royal Institute of British Architects Collections, London, The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, London. The late Geoff Brandwood for the generous use of his fine photographs of Victorian architecture. At Bloomsbury, James Thompson who embraced the idea of this book from the beginning, and has supported it throughout, the anonymous readers of the manuscript, and all involved in the detail editing, production, and design, including Alexander Highfield, Rosamunde O’ Cleirigh, Eleanor Rose, Elle Bloomberg, Merv Honeywood, and Dave Cummings.

This is a tradition of rectangularity – resistant to the plastic moulding of space – where walls meet at right angles and remain as distinct planes, and buildings aggregate as separate spatial compartments and volumes. Pevsner discovers this sensibility to surface throughout Medieval Gothic, in Elizabethan architecture, in the endless terraces of London’s Kensington and Bayswater, in Pugin’s façades of the Houses of Parliament, in the flat surfaces of William Morris’s wallpapers and other designs, and in British Modernism. This book investigates the shaping of the surface in British architecture – in materiality, pattern, and meaning – from the middle of the nineteenth century up to the turn of the twenty-first century in a broadly chronological approach that periodizes this modernist time frame into themes connected to significant architects, artists, critics, and projects. These topics include: ‘Reading the Wall-Surface’ (John Ruskin’s wall-veil and the work of William Butterfield and George Edmund Street); ‘Surfaces of Romance’ (William Morris and Philip Webb); ‘Smooth and Rough’ (George Frederick Bodley and Edward Schröder Prior); ‘Carving the Surface’ (Charles Holden and Jacob Epstein); ‘Surfaces and Sharawaggi’ (the Picturesque, Townscape, and Pevsner); ‘Surfaces of Brutalism’ (Reyner Banham, Alison and Peter Smithson, James Stirling and James Gowan, Eduardo Paolozzi, Adrian Stokes); ‘Pattern, Abstraction, Post-Modernism’ (Berthold Lubetkin, Victor Pasmore, James Stirling); ‘High Tech, Neo-Vernacular, New Materiality’ (Richard Rogers, Ralph Erskine, Adam Caruso and Peter St John). It has been said that ‘Nationality is an address, not a consciousness. A lot of things happen at that address’.1 The boundaries of that address can be problematic enough in the case of the British archipelago, but in art history, for example, there might be reasonable curatorial consensus as to what should go into London’s Tate Britain Gallery, and what should go into Tate Modern. In art and architectural history, a geographical framing continues 1\n\n2\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nto prove as useful – and as arbitrary – as a chronological one, enabling limits to be placed upon material that might otherwise be overwhelming. Much more problematic are attempts to elide the geographical address with accounts of national architectural consciousness, as in Pevsner’s efforts towards an English Kunstgeographie. At the same time, architecture did develop within these same geographical boundaries; they do describe sites where shifting groups of peoples and cultures have consistently made buildings within a vortex of ideas, topography, climate, politics, and manners, that have engendered recognizable patterns and tendencies – as in those affecting the surfaces and materiality of architecture as investigated herein. This inquiry also stresses the value of Britain’s continuous importation of theories, models, and people – the crucial émigré contribution, for example. As for exports, it has increasingly been the case that many British architects have sought their best opportunities abroad – James Stirling’s masterpiece is in Stuttgart, Germany. Equally difficult is the question of ‘Englishness’ and Britishness’; Pevsner’s Englishness of English Art isolates the significance of The Picturesque; but this was invented on the Welsh-English borders of the Wye Valley and included Welsh artists of the stature of Thomas Jones and Richard Wilson. And the contribution of Scottish architects, thinkers, and engineers is indivisible to understanding the buildings of Britain and its constituent nations. But to simply use ‘British’ and ‘English’ interchangeably would also be cultural appropriation; here both descriptions are used, according to context, or to correspond with the voice of the pertinent architect or critic. This book’s contribution to architectural history, and visual culture, is its detailed examination of the surfaces and materiality of British architecture between1840 and 2000. In undertaking this it joins a broader surface discourse. A seminal work is David Leatherbarrow and Mohsen Mostafavi’s Surface Architecture (2002). This is a wide-ranging examination of the surface in contemporary architecture. Within our topic area it engages with the post-war period in England, through the ideas of the Independent Group, the notion of the ‘As Found’, and the work of Alison and Peter Smithson, and Stirling and Gowan – subjects discussed here within Chapters 6 and 7. An example of a more focused analysis of architecture as surface is Anuradha Chatterjee’s John Ruskin and the Fabric of Architecture (2018), which studies Ruskin’s wall-veil through the lenses of dress-studies and gender. Ruskin’s theory of the wall-veil is foundational to our 1840–2000 period and occupies Chapter 1, with its influence upon Morris and Webb taken forward in Chapter 2. Paul Binski’s Gothic Wonder: Art, Artifice and the Decorated Style 1290–1350 (2014) extends Pevsner in its study of the ‘aesthetics of surface’ in English Gothic; on these matters see, for example, Chapter 5 of the present book. Joseph A. Amato’s Surfaces: A History (2013) traces the human relationship with surfaces much more broadly, examining the walls and streets of our homes and cities, but also surfaces as wider experiential and cultural phenomena. Many studies engage with these\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nmatters by interrogating a particular material, as does Adrian Forty in Concrete and Culture: A Material History (2012). For example, Forty examines the ‘Nationality of Concrete’, noting how the Smithsons dressed their concrete in Portland stone in their Economist Building, London to accord with the ‘sober and specifically English business attire’ of most of London’s public buildings. He also offers insights into the uses of concrete in London’s Hayward Gallery and Queen Elizabeth Hall, and by Caruso St John in The New Art Gallery Walsall. Here, Holden’s proto-Modernist use of Portland stone is a prominent aspect of Chapter 4, and interpretations of the latter works will be found in Chapter 8. In a similar vein is Richard Weston’s Materials, Form and Architecture (2003) with its focus on the tectonic and material aspects of architecture, and Alec Clifton-Taylor’s classic The Pattern of English Building (1962). Then there is a vast hinterland of works which examine the visual cultures of Britishness and Englishness; in architecture, Sutherland Lyall’s The State of British Architecture (1980) and Alan Powers’ Britain: Modern Architecture in History (2007) are significant; more broadly, numerous books can be cited such as David Matless’s Landscape and Englishness (1998), Kitty Hauser’s Shadow Sites: Photography, Archaeology, and the British Landscape 1927–1955 (2007), Robert Hoozee’s edited volume British Vision: Observation and Imagination in British Art 1750–1950 (2008), Mark A. Cheetham’s Artwriting, Nation, and Cosmopolitanism in Britain (2012), and Alexandra Harris’s Weatherland: Writers and Artists Under English Skies (2015). As noted, the argument of the book unfolds within a broadly chronological framework of eight chapters, structured by themes, linked to architects, artists, critics, and projects of surface significance.\n\nChapter 1: Reading the Wall-Surface: John Ruskin, William Butterfield, and George Edmund Street John Ruskin’s vigorous prose-poetry awakened the hearts of his readers to read the surfaces of the Gothic buildings of Venice as the leaves of a book, and as a lesson of warning from one – now-fallen – maritime state to another. His forcible readings of these architectural ‘pages’ of Venice and northern Italy in The Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849) and The Stones of Venice (1851–3) re-signified the surfaces of British architecture – through the second half of the nineteenth century and deep into the twentieth century – transforming how they were conceived and made. This chapter reads the ‘development’ of the constructed and ‘incrusted’ surface in High Victorian architecture through the theories of Ruskin and George Edmund Street, and in the built works of William Butterfield and Street himself. It is owing to Ruskin, together with Street and Butterfield, that a strong feeling for broad surfaces and bold masses became a characteristic trait, both of High Victorian architecture and that of the ensuing Arts and Crafts.\n\n4\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nChapter 2: ‘Think first of the walls’: Surfaces of Romance – Morris, Webb, and the Arts and Crafts Domestic Interior This chapter examines the translation of Ruskin’s wall-veil, and his readings of the Gothic surfaces of Venice, to the wall-planes of the Arts and Crafts dwellings of William Morris and Philip Webb, both acolytes of Ruskin and products of the Street atelier – albeit a brief tenure in Morris’s case. The medieval spirit of Red House – the home Webb designed for Morris in 1858–9 – was encapsulated in the hortus ludi of the Garden of Pleasure; a vision fully captured in the unrealized ‘Palace of Art’ Webb planned for the families of Morris and Edward Burne-Jones as an enlarged U-plan Red House. Here that love of the earth-veil of nature is expressed in the wall-veil as a layered composition akin to the images found in medieval missals. Moving to the interiors of Webb and Morris, the ecologies of Nature are likewise engendered in flat patterns, in generously layered hierarchies of surface, scaled to simplicity or splendour.\n\nChapter 3: Smooth and Rough: George Frederick Bodley and Edward Schröder Prior The Morris-ian domestic world of romantically layered surfaces breaks with the muscularity of the High Victorian style. The ‘refinement’ in the ecclesiastical work of George Frederick Bodley (1827–1907) elides the domestic and public realms; Bodley’s church interiors aspire to the same beauties of surface, colour, and furnishing, as would be the intention in the rooms of a fine house. Compare a Bodley church, such as Holy Trinity, South Kensington, London (1901–6) with Edward Schröder Prior’s St Andrew’s, Roker (1905). In both the space is conceived as one unitary volume for, as John Betjeman has pointed out, such Arts and Crafts architects sought different proportions of ‘either height and narrowness, or breadth and length. Their churches either soar or spread’. Their chosen styles of Late Decorated or Perpendicular – no longer ‘Middle-Pointed’ – respond to the desire for a purer ‘Englishness’ in architectural language. But, in contrast to Bodley’s smoothness, Prior also called for ‘Texture as a Quality of Art and a Condition for Architecture’ (1890) and his surfaces retain a Savage roughness in their handmade textures of brick, sea-pebbles, and rocky stonework.\n\nChapter 4: Carving the Surface: Edwardian and Inter-War Architecture and Sculpture Making a bridge between the Arts and Crafts and inter-war Modernism, this chapter assesses the carved surfaces of the Edwardian and inter-war years in the work of Charles Holden (1875–1960); an architect whom John Summerson described as ‘the last of the Edwardians and the first of the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nEnglish Moderns’. Holden’s ‘English Modern’ mediates a proto-Modernist abstraction between the white-architecture icons of the neo-Corbusian avant-garde, and the overtly academic classical buildings of a period which also witnessed a high point in architectural sculpture. The need of the new century for large professional, commercial, and governmental headquarters gave scope – to architects and sculptors alike – to define the language for a progressively technocratic future. Many of these buildings – including those of Holden – would now be thought of as conventionally traditional, but their makers all saw themselves as ‘modern’ to some extent, and the sculpture enlivening their surfaces was integral to these variants of modernity. Both the cladding and sculpture of many of these structures were in stone – often the Portland stone that Holden loved for its weathering qualities. Among the constructions of these confusingly eclectic years, Holden’s work stands out in its harnessing of Walt Whitman-esque energies and the sublimity of the USA skyscraper, to an English abstraction of surface derived from Wren and Hawksmoor, and Arts and Crafts traditions. Holden extended his devotion to naked stone to embrace a diversity of sculptors – including Charles Pibworth, Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill, and Henry Moore – each, in their way, ‘modern’ as representatives of The New Sculpture or of Carving Direct.\n\nChapter 5: Surfaces and Sharawaggi: Aspects of the Picturesque c. 1925–55 This chapter examines the rediscovery of the British Picturesque in that dialectic between Rationalism and Neo-Romanticism, as it emerged in the period leading up to World War II, evolved through the war itself, and resonated for over a decade thereafter. These movements arose from tensions between Modernism’s predisposition to unlocated ‘international’ abstractions and more located ‘national’ encounters with histories and places. On the one hand, there are Nikolaus Pevsner’s (1902–1983) formalist readings of the Englishness of the English surface – based upon his German academic training in the analysis of style within the Zeitgeist – but emplaced insofar as they stress national character. On the other hand, the atmospheric readings of the textures of British architecture and landscape – made by observers such as John Piper and John Betjeman – were labelled as Neo-Romanticism. To characterize these attitudes as necessarily totally opposed – as in Timothy Mowl’s Stylistic Cold Wars: Betjeman versus Pevsner (2011) – can miss many overlaps of approach, not least in the rekindling of Picturesque ideas in both camps. In its pages, The Architectural Review relayed the Picturesque through the notions of ‘Sharawaggi’ and Townscape, popularized in Gordon Cullen’s vivid draughtsmanship as ad hoc ‘high’ and ‘low’ collages of urban fabric – injected with elements of Surrealism. Pevsner’s scholarship also advanced the Picturesque as a Modernist tool in the reconfiguration of the city. Both Rational and Neo-Romantic strands reached their culmination\n\n6\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nfully a decade after the end of World War II; in Pevsner’s case in his BBC Reith Lectures of 1955, on The Englishness of English Art, while Basil Spence’s winning neo-Gothic design of 1951, for the competition to design a new Cathedral of St Michael at Coventry – in the context of the medieval building blitzed in November 1940 – was the definitive Gesamtkunstwerk of Neo-Romanticism.\n\nChapter 6: As Found: Surfaces of Brutalism In his essay on the ‘Revenge of the Picturesque’ (1968), Reyner Banham describes the persistence of this English visual philosophy in the polemics of post-World War II British architecture up to, and beyond, the mid-1960s – notwithstanding its associations with old-guard empiricism in the minds of Corbusian Modernists. The Picturesque would manifestly include Basil Spence’s Coventry Cathedral, but Banham also accused the avant-garde leaders themselves as capitulating to ‘the genius of the place’, citing the Townscape informality of Alison and Peter Smithson’s The Economist cluster (1959–64), and the asymmetries of Stirling and Gowan’s Leicester University Engineering Building (1959–63). The most consequential British contribution to these fierce arguments was the ethic and aesthetic of ‘The New Brutalism’, coined around 1952 and defined in Banham’s ‘The New Brutalism’ essay in The Architectural Review of December 1955. A ‘Brutalist’ building will exhibit three key qualities: first, formal legibility of plan; second, clear exhibition of structure; and third, valuation of materials for their inherent qualities ‘as found’. This chapter examines these ‘As Found’ surfaces of Brutalism beginning with Banham’s major point of Brutalist reference, Alison and Peter Smithson’s Hunstanton School in Norfolk (1949–54). Banham ponders that ‘English architectural psychology’ which imports a style – in this case the steel-frame-and-infill of Mies van der Rohe’s Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago (IIT) – and ‘corrects’ it to local circumstance; as English Palladianism had ‘corrected’ Palladio, or Ruskin had ‘corrected’ Venetian Gothic. The parallels in ‘bloody-mindedness’ between Butterfield and Brutalism are examined, as in Stirling and Gowan’s flats at Ham Common, London (1955–8). The Brutalist wallpapers and fabrics of Eduardo Paolozzi and Nigel Henderson are also studied for being, as indicative of their time, as those of William Morris; these works – and other surfaces generated by the This is Tomorrow exhibition (1956) – are read through the psychoanalytical lenses of Anton Ehrenzweig and Adrian Stokes.\n\nChapter 7: Pattern, Abstraction, Post-Modernism: Lubetkin – Pasmore – Stirling This chapter begins with the issues of facadism-versus-functionalism which Lubetkin and Tecton had first brought to the fore in their Highpoint II of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\n1936–8. Again, it was Banham who encapsulated the issues at stake in a criticism on ‘Façade’ he wrote with regard to The Architectural Review’s publication, in November 1954, of Tecton’s Hallfield Estate in Paddington, London. Should the faces of these immense post-war housing blocks arise as the outcome of technical and programmatic needs – as a functionalist would require – or be considered as works of art in their own right? Rejecting both positivist Sachlichkeit, or a romantic retreat into Gemütlichkeit, Lubetkin argued for an integration of planning, structure, and architectural expressivity. Consequently, the first part of this chapter examines how Lubetkin articulated patterns of living in the façades of Tecton projects such as Priory Green Estate, Finsbury, London (1943–51). Lubetkin continued these experiments in his short-term involvement with Peterlee New Town (designated 1948) in the north-east of England where the extraordinary ‘gables that speak’ of his housing designs, anticipate the semiotics of PostModernism, and echo Ruskin’s call for the surfaces of architecture to be readable. Following Lubetkin’s disgruntled departure from Peterlee, the story was taken forward in other ways, by the artist Victor Pasmore. For a quarter-century Pasmore worked with the architects of Peterlee, on the experiment of applying Piet Mondrian’s principles of ‘constructed abstract art’ to the interrelations of settlement-pattern and landscape; extending these ideas – at the level of the dwelling-cluster – to the planar-compositions of cross-walls and flat roofs. This neglected constructed abstract avantgarde – that had once been as important a part of the This is Tomorrow exhibition (1956) as the Pop of Richard Hamilton or the Brutalism of the Smithsons – occupies the second part of this chapter. Finally, James Stirling – in the role of homo ludens – continues to be a key actor in these post-war surface narratives; firstly, as the author (with James Gowan) of the Engineering Faculty, Leicester University (1959) whose skin-like surfaces collage features of canonic Modernism, Victorian industrialism, Butterfieldian bloody-mindedness, and Brutalist bombast. Equally significant is his transition from this complicated Late-Modernist stance, to an equally involved Post-Modernist embrace of history, context, and architecture parlante; examined here briefly in the Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart (1977–83) and, more closely, in his Clore Gallery extension to Tate Britain, London (1978–86). Even though, Stirling himself, always vehemently tore off any Po-Mo labels attached to his work.\n\nChapter 8: High-Tech, Neo-Vernacular, New Materiality: Richard Rogers – Ralph Erskine – Caruso St John In taking this narrative up to the turn of the twenty-first century, this final chapter is also tripartite in its structure, as it investigates the three important strands of: High-Tech, Neo-Vernacular, and New Materiality – languages that are more interrelated in their surface character than might at first appear. These approaches are respectively represented by the practices of\n\n8\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nRichard Rogers (initially with Renzo Piano), Ralph Erskine, and Adam Caruso and Peter St John. The exponents of the exo-skeletons of High-Tech saw themselves as continuing the bravura Victorian traditions of The Crystal Palace and the great railway termini; the Archigram pioneer Peter Cook regarded this Victorian and High-Tech enthusiasm for audacious invention as an intrinsic part of the ‘English psychology’. Yet, until this High-Tech outbreak of the 1960s and 1970s, the skeletal had been suppressed in Britain, in part owing to Ruskin’s scorn for a ‘new style’ of iron architecture; the Great Court of the Oxford University Museum (opened 1860) remains an isolated experimentation in what might have evolved as a Ruskinian iron and steel architecture. The first part of this chapter traces the path to Richard Rogers’s Lloyds Building (1976–86), via Piano and Rogers’s Centre Pompidou in Paris, to the seminal ideas of the English Archigram Group in the 1960s. They may look different, but the flexible infrastructures of High-Tech, or the homely ‘sheddery’ of Ralph Erskine’s Byker Wall in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, both aspire towards a bottom-up architecture without architects (cf. Bernard Rudofsky); in the one case by empowering the desires of consumer-culture, in the other by fostering popular participation in the design process. And – whether made of steel, or brick and timber – the surfaces of both Rogers and Erskine deploy an aesthetics of bricolage. The second part of this chapter analyses these surfaces of Erskine in the context of approaches that have variously been called: Romantic Functionalism, Romantic Pragmatism, or Neo-Vernacular. By the 1980s, those surveying the eclectic state of British architecture, found a field scattered with the remnants of the countless stylewars of: Brutalism, Empiricism, Post-Modernism, High-Tech, NeoVernacular, and so forth. As so often in these pages, the meanings that can be generated through making and material would again provide a rappel à l’ordre; a New Materiality visible in the work of Adam Caruso and Peter St John, whose New Art Gallery Walsall (opened in February 2000) takes this enquiry into the shaping of surface, and the materiality of British architecture, up to the turn of the twenty-first century.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nReading the Wall-Surface John Ruskin, William Butterfield, and George Edmund Street\n\nJohn Ruskin called his St Mark’s Rest (published in parts from 1877) the ‘fourth volume’ of his celebrated The Stones of Venice (1851–3); here the surfaces of the city are both the leaves of a book and a salt-smelling skin – not such opposing metaphors given the vellum leaves of the medieval manuscripts beloved by Ruskin. His preface describes the autobiographies of nations as written ‘in three manuscripts;– the book of their deeds, their words, and the book of their art’. The most ‘trustworthy one is the last’, and ‘the history of Venice is chiefly written in such manuscript. It once lay open on the waves, miraculous, like St Cuthbert’s book,– a golden legend on countless leaves’,1 but now it has been brutishly cut and singed into fragments of ‘blackened scroll’ which Ruskin’s redeeming work – as in his earlier volumes of The Stones of Venice – enables us to read. Ruskin lets Venice speak for herself, telling ‘her own story, in her own handwriting. . . . Not a word shall I have to say in the matter . . . except to deepen the letters for you when [these cut and blackened fragments] are indistinct . . .’.2 And in compelling imagery Venice’s scrolls are skin, it is ‘this amphibious city – this Phocaea, or sea-dog of towns, – looking with soft human eyes at you from the sand, Proteus himself latent in the salt-smelling skin of her’.3 Like the Proteus of Greek legend its surfaces are aspect-changing, it can be both male and female, it ‘can add colours to the chameleon / Change shapes with Proteus for advantages’.4 And ‘Mr Ruskin was heard’, as his contemporary Charles Eastlake confirms in his A History of the Gothic Revival of 1872, for whereas ‘previous apologists for the [Gothic] Revival had relied more or less on ecclesiastical sentiment, on historical interest, or on a vague sense of the 9\n\n10\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\npicturesque for their plea in its favour’, Ruskin’s vigorous prose-poetry struck ‘a chord of human sympathy that vibrated through all hearts . . .’.5 His forcible readings of the pages and skins of Venice and northern Italy in The Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849) and The Stones of Venice would re-signify the surfaces of British architecture through the second half of the nineteenth century and deep into the twentieth, transforming how they were conceived, made, and symbolized. This chapter reads the ‘development’ of the constructed and ‘incrusted’ surface in High Victorian architecture through the theories of Ruskin and George Edmund Street, and in the built works of William Butterfield and Street himself. Ruskin closes his pivotal ‘Nature of Gothic’ chapter in the second volume of Stones of Venice with the injunction: ‘Lastly, Read the sculpture. . . . Thenceforward the criticism of the building is to be conducted precisely on the same principles as that of a book; and it must depend on the knowledge, feeling, and not a little on the industry and perseverance of the reader, whether, even in the case of the best works, he either perceive them to be great, or feel them to be entertaining’.6 Ruskin’s own industry and perseverance in reading the scattered pages of the city that ‘once lay open on the waves’ is attested by the vast system of diaries, worksheets, and pocketbooks crammed with notes and sketches, that laid the foundations of The Stones of Venice.7 Elizabeth Helsinger claims these three volumes as ‘Ruskin’s first and his most sustained effort to combine religious and artistic reading in a single critical activity’.8 In Ruskin’s command to ‘Read’ she identifies four symbolic languages. First, there is the manifest language of sculpture and pictorial iconography.9 Then there is the language of the picturesque, that ‘golden stain of time’; for Ruskin the ‘glory of a building . . . is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy . . . which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity’.10 Finally, there are two symbolic languages architecture develops from nature: the inherent geological record of the stones themselves, and their theological message.11 Opening the final and third volume of The Stones of Venice, Ruskin affirms that the preceding two books have ‘dwelt . . . on the historical language of stones; let us not forget this, which is their theological language’. As the same passage explains, such stones set ‘forth [the] eternity and . . . TRUTH’ of the Deity, just as the ‘elements of the universe – its air, its water, and its flame. . .’.12 Such exegesis is rooted in Ruskin’s evangelical upbringing and his childhood daily Bible-reading at his mother’s side. In practical terms, all these languages will be laid out and contested on the surfaces of High Victorian architecture. Ruskin was not the first to analogize texts to the surfaces of architecture but, to reiterate Eastlake’s point, he made once vague historical or literary sentiments to ‘vibrate in human hearts’ in synthesizing these iconographical, aesthetic, material, and metaphysical languages. William\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n11\n\nMorris, for example, testified to the conversion experience of reading Ruskin’s readings – especially the ‘Nature of Gothic’ chapter of Stones. Laugier, Boullée, and others had theorized the face of building as ‘architecture parlante’ in the second half of the eighteenth century. More galvanizing to nineteenth-century debates was Victor Hugo’s Notre Dame de Paris of 1831–2 wherein he appealed to architecture as ‘the great book of mankind, man’s chief form of expression in the various stages of his development, either as force or intelligence’.13 Ruskin had read Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame in the 1830s, and claimed to have hated it, but the novelist’s vision of architecture as writing the story of a nation was clearly an influence.14 An extreme example of Early Victorian building-asbook symbolism in ‘ecclesiastical design’ is G. F. Lewis’s Illustrations of Kilpeck Church, Herefordshire of 1842. When Moses builds an altar at God’s command – as described in the book of Exodus – for Lewis ‘altar and book [are] one and the same when an event was ordered by the Lord to be recorded’. In those days, ‘an altar was . . . intended for the same purpose as a book is at present. We have only to consider the material, stone, to be the leaves, and the . . . chisel to be the pen’.15 Such early churches were designed ‘with intelligence, making them books in which the community could read the Law and the Gospel’.16 Of the robustly carved Norman of Kilpeck, itself, Lewis opines: ‘This little Church, through art, is made a book in which information is conveyed to all who are able to read its pages’; the ‘power of speech’ is given to ‘stones, wood, and glass’.17 The ‘textual turn’ of making books of a building’s surfaces can be located at the very cusp of the Victorian era in the building of the small church of St Mary and St Nicholas at Littlemore, Oxford between 1835 and 1836 by the architect Henry Underwood for his client John Henry Newman.18 Littlemore was small, but didactically loaded in embodying the Tractarian principles that had made Newman and the Oxford Movement famous. Emerging as a presence in the 1830s, the Tractarians urged a revival of Catholic canons within the Church of England, shortly to be paralleled by the Ecclesiologists of the Cambridge Movement with their particular stress on the role of architecture and art in the revival of Anglican Catholicism. In a sermon given soon after Littlemore’s consecration, Newman told his parishioners that they should see their new church as itself a Tract, as ‘a book, a holy book, which you may look at and read, and which will suggest to you many good thoughts of God and heaven’.19 Many revolted against the Anglo-Catholic implications of what was being looked at and read here, the be-candled high altars and so forth – Ruskin prominent among them given his evangelical Christian upbringing. But adumbrated in Littlemore, in the words of Newman, or lesser contributors to the discourse such as Lewis, and no less Ruskin himself, is the idea of the church building as a communicative vessel whose wallsurfaces gather meanings to speak in rich material, symbolic, and spiritual overtones.\n\n12\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nEmergence of the Gothic wall-veil The first surface of Venice, the aforementioned amphibious ‘sea-dog of towns’, was naturally not that of architecture itself but the protean ‘saltsmelling skin’ of the sandy earth whereon it arose. Ruskin opens his fifth volume of Modern Painters with this preeminent surface ‘The Earth-Veil’: ‘The earth in its depths must remain dead and cold, incapable except of slow crystalline change; but at its surface, which human beings look upon and deal with, it ministers to them through a veil of strange intermediate being . . .’.20 In the next chapter of this book, we will show William Morris, following Ruskin, writing in News from Nowhere of ‘the spirit of the new days, of our days’ as a ‘delight in the life of the world; intense and overweening love of the very skin and surface of the earth, on which man dwells, such as a lover has in the fair flesh of the woman he loves . . .’.21 Expanding on the imagery of the earth-veil Ruskin depicts it variously as ‘a carpet’, as ‘a fantasy of embroidery’ of ‘tall spreading of foliage’ with the ‘unerring uprightness as of temple pillars’ all cleaving to the underlying strength of rock or transient sand. Accordingly, Ruskin earlier applied lessons from the ‘school of nature’ in defining the wall-veil as the main intermediary surface in architecture in his first volume of Stones of Venice. In his John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture, Michael Brooks calls Ruskin’s wall-veil his ‘most dramatic contribution to architectural terminology’; ‘wall-veil’ was soon on the lips of pupils in architectural offices in the 1850s as ‘an early sign of the approaching Ruskinian wave’.22 As Eastlake writing in 1872 recalls, these pupils also ‘astonished their masters by talking of the Savageness of Northern Gothic, of the Intemperance of Curves, and the Laws of Foliation . . .’.23 What then is this defining surface of the wall-veil? The wall is the first of Ruskin’s three divisions of architecture into walls, roofs, and apertures: ‘A wall is an even and united fence, whether of wood, earth, stone, or metal’. Statically the wall has to contend with vertical or lateral forces; its strength can be increased ‘by some general addition to its thickness; but if the pressure becomes very great, it is gathered up into piers to resist vertical pressure, and supported by buttresses to resist lateral pressure’.24 A true wall-veil must retain its breadth of surface between the piers (where these are necessary), neither becoming a line of piers altogether, nor a continuous rampart-like buttress. On the one hand, this membrane-like sheer surface of the wall appears to owe something to the fabric analogies of Gottfried Semper; on the other, it seems to anticipate the modern ‘curtain-wall’ of frame-andcladding.25 These parallels are certainly worth pursuing, but Ruskin’s wallveil never aims at the atectonic dematerialization Semper sought when he argued that ‘the annihilation of reality, of the material, is necessary if form is to emerge as a meaningful symbol’.26 Nor, as is well known, was Ruskin enamoured of the potential of the Crystal Palace’s iron-frame and cladding. In truth, Ruskin’s wall-veil is always embodied in material substance even if that may be no more than an ‘incrustation’ of thin sheets of marble, as\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n13\n\ncortex to a masonry core. In contrast to Semper’s desire to annihilate material, read Ruskin on the ornament of the wall-veil: But this is to be noted of all good wall ornament, that it retains the expression of firm and massive substance, and of broad surface, and that architecture instantly declined when linear design was substituted for massive, and the sense of weight of wall was lost in a wilderness of upright or undulating rods.27 In the chapter of Stones of Venice on ‘Gothic Palaces’ (chapter 7, vol. 2), the wall-surfaces of Venice are seen to appear in their full breadth, co-equally with the emergence of Gothic architecture out of the Byzantine-Romanesque of the city. Byzantine palaces, such as the thirteenth-century Ca’ Loredan and Ca’ Farsetti at the Rialto, have no wall-veils to speak of, characterized as they are by tier on tier of continuous stilted arches on slender columns, making for maximum transparency and ‘rapid vertical accents’ stayed only by occasional narrow piers.28 Ruskin notes that ‘the first story of a Byzantine palace consists of, perhaps, eighteen or twenty arches, reaching from one side of the house to the other . . .’. Then ‘a great change takes place in the Gothic period. These long arcades break, as it were, into pieces, and coagulate into central and lateral windows, and small arched doors, pierced in great surfaces of brick wall’.29 As one Byzantine family of forms of repeated arcades dies out, another Gothic one is born of surface and aperture. In Ruskin’s active prose, architectural styles are urgently animate,30 the Gothic ‘breaks’ and ‘coagulates’ the Byzantine arcades, making its surfaces with the natural energy of geological forces, with that ‘Changefulness’ of the preceding ‘Nature of Gothic’ chapter, that can ‘expand into a hall, coil into a staircase, or spring into a spire, with undegraded grace and unexhausted energy . . .’.31 So the typical tripartite Venetian palace emerges with its more solid façade of visible wall-surfaces; the arcade is now restricted to the centre of the piano-nobile (lighting the deep portego hall behind), while the sea-story now just has its water-gate and a few related openings. Ruskin’s unpublished drafts of this ‘Gothic Palaces’ chapter detail these changes through the ‘Angel House’ or Casa dell’Angelo, a complete late example of the pre-Gothic building type on the Calle di Rimedio near Campo Santa Maria Formosa. All these pre-Gothic palaces comprise a long, narrow rectangular block of two or more storeys, which contains a large first-floor hall accessed by an external stair. There are two main layouts; in the Casa dell’ Angelo type the long side of the block has the main inward-looking façade which overlooks a walled court – not the immediate street or canal (the other layout is that of the above-mentioned Loredan and Farsetti palaces, at the Rialto, where the façade is placed outward-facing to canal or street, on the short side of the rectangular block, transforming thereby the palace’s relationship to the urban fabric).32 The austere windows of the upper two storeys of the Casa dell’Angelo are ‘one of the most extensive and perfect\n\n14\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Courtyard façade of Casa dell’Angelo, Rio di Canonica, Venice (also called Ca’ Soranzo). Photograph © Cameraphoto Arte, Venezia. examples’ of Ruskin’s transitional ‘second order’ of Venetian arches in their fully established form.33 Here the inner part of the arch is still of the stilted round-arched Byzantine form of the ‘first order’, but in the ogee contour of the pointed outer arch the Gothic spirit begins to show itself. Ruskin’s unpublished drafts on the Casa dell’Angelo deserve extended quotation for showing the moment when the Gothic wall surface emerges. Ruskin closes ‘an argument by offering an experience’34 – most obviously in celebrated passages such as the approach to St Mark’s of this second volume of Stones – but even the following, more everyday notes, draw readers into ‘watching’ the life of a building as active participants:\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n15\n\nFronting the bridge which crosses the Rio de Palazzo and leads into the Calle di Rimedio, is a square door, surrounded by an architrave of red marble. . . . The wall in which this occurs has been restored; but passing beneath it, we enter a courtyard fenced from the Calle di Rimedio by a wall with parapets, and, on the other side by a most picturesque mass of buildings. The ground floor has been much altered, but three shafts are still left, . . . which instead of carrying arches, as hitherto we have been accustomed to find them, sustain a massy horizontal wooden beam, on which rests the first floor of the house above. . . . In the first storey above these shafts is a group of four windows sustained by three shafts and two pilasters. Both shafts and pilasters stand without any base, on a low continuous plinth. . . . . . . [Previously] the whole width of the house is considered as one arcade with intervals more or less wide. But [now] the idea of the continuous arcade is lost. The groups of its arches contract themselves only windows. . . . The windows as they shrink in width, shrink in height also, draw up their feet, as it were, and instead of falling to the general foundation of the building, receive . . . a narrow plinth . . . for a foundation of their own. At the same time the great arch of the entrance sinks into a mere door, and the building, instead of the appearance of a great court or public space surrounded by arcades, assumes that of a very closely veiled private house, with doors and windows of ordinary size . . . .35 As the openings shrink and sink, a last echo of Byzantine arcaded feeling – in the now ‘closely-veiled’ Gothic palace – survives in the typically ‘connected group of central windows’ of their upper storeys. In the third volume of Stones of Venice, Ruskin sums up these great changes: ‘the principal difference in general form and treatment between the Byzantine and Gothic palaces was the contraction of the marble facing into the narrow spaces between the windows, leaving large fields of brick wall perfectly bare’.36 On the aforementioned reading analogy, this ‘whole wall of the palace was considered as the page of a book to be illuminated’.37 How the Venetians illuminated the pages offered by these large new surface-fields can be seen in such late fifteenth-century pictures of the city as Giovanni Mansueti’s Miracle of the Relic of the Holy Cross (1494) or Vittore Carpaccio’s Healing of the Possessed Man (1494), in the Venice Accademia. Ruskin believes such paintings to be ‘the perfectly true representation of what the Architecture of Venice was in her glorious time; trim, dainty,– red and white like the blossom of a carnation,– touched with gold like a peacock’s plume, and frescoed, even to its chimney pots, with fairest arabesque . . .’.38 On the left of Mansueti’s Miracle, the illuminated urban wall-veil recedes steeply, heads pop out to watch the events taking place below and oriental textiles, hung down from the windows, layer further arabesques. Here says Ruskin is ‘one harmony of work and life,– all of a piece, you see them, in the wonderful palace-perspective on the left . . . with everybody looking out of their windows’.39 Enough traces of these\n\n16\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nFIGURE 1.2 Giovanni Mansueti, Miracle of the Relic of the Holy Cross in Campo San Lio (1494).

Ruskin mourns ‘that the sea winds are bad\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n17\n\nlibrarians’ and virtually all these painted pages of chivalric spirit have perished. Yet the façade of the Doge’s Palace still emblazons the chequered principle in its imperishable diaperings of Istrian stone and pink Verona marble, applied as an atectonic ‘veil that disregards architectural members but begins and ends seemingly at random, like a cut from a huge roll of textile’.46 The Ducal Palace also encompasses the preceding narrative, in dramatically juxtaposing the Byzantine ethos of its arcaded sea-storeys, with the broad Gothic surfaces of its upper stage. To Ruskin’s vivid input of the ‘wall-veil’ to architectural language, must be added his related concept of ‘Surface Gothic’. That planar quality, so conspicuous in the Gothic and Early Renaissance architecture of Venice, is part of a broader feeling for the wall-plane in Italian building. A plate in Stones of Venice – comparing ‘Linear and Surface Gothic’ – puts a filigree Flamboyant canopy from Abbeville in northern France, side by side with a sturdy one from a Scala tomb in Verona, northern Italy. The Abbeville canopy ‘is so cut through and through that it is hardly stronger than a piece of lace’; whereas the Verona canopy has ‘its surface of stone . . . unpierced, and the mass of it is thick and strong . . .’. The latter attracts ‘the eye to broad sculptured surfaces, the other to involution of intricate lines’.47 Accepting that both have their beauties, Ruskin insists the ‘Italian [Surface] Gothic is the nobler style’. Something very similar to this Linear / Surface distinction had been expressed before Ruskin’s exhaustive Venetian research in his ‘Lamp of Power’ chapter of The Seven Lamps of Architecture. As Nature has ‘her woods and thickets’ and ‘her plains, and cliffs’, so ‘of the many broad divisions under which architecture may be considered, none [are] more significant that those into buildings, whose interest is in their walls, and those whose interest is in the lines dividing their walls’.48 Ruskin’s corporeal instinct is to the sensual skins of wall-architecture: ‘Whatever infinity of fair form there may be in the maze of the forest, there is a fairer, as I think, in the surface of the quiet lake; and I hardly know that association of shaft or tracery, for which I would exchange the warm sleep of sunshine on some smooth, broad, human-like front of marble’.49 In this privileging of wall-architecture, one major ‘association’ that appears to be contradicted here is that Association with Natural Scenery and National Character Ruskin had examined in his first architectural publication The Poetry of Architecture (1873–8). So, in his The Englishness of English Art, Nikolaus Pevsner examined an English ‘national mania for beautiful surface quality’, but not for wall-architecture as such, rather for ‘the lines dividing their walls’ as visible in the English Gothic love of over-all linear patterns of every kind.50 One question that therefore needs to be addressed, is how Ruskin’s influential surface theories – conceived among the alleys and canals of Venice – intersected with existent English predilections to surface pattern. Part of the answer lies in interpreting the last two languages ascertained by Helsinger, those geological ones inherent in the materiality of stones themselves, and in their symbolic message.\n\n18\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nFIGURE 1.3 John Ruskin, ‘Linear and Surface Gothic’ (1853), The Stones of Venice, vol. 2, plate 12.\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n19\n\nReading the geological wall-veil If the Protean shape-shifting sand is one geological given at Venice, the other is the rampart of the Alps; often veiled in summer, they can be an immediate snow-clad presence on clear cold winter days like those of Ruskin’s first Stones of Venice fieldwork from November to March 1849–50. From the campanile of Torcello Ruskin saw, to north and west the ‘misty band of mountains, touched with snow’,51 or on his approach to Murano recorded ‘the linked conclave of the Alps [which] know no decline from their old pre-eminence, nor stoop from their golden thrones in the circle of the horizon’.52 Ruskin regarded Venice – at the eastern end of the Alps – as one of his spiritual homes upon earth; the other – at the western end of the Alps – was Chamonix, in Switzerland. And when in November 1849 Ruskin descended from the Alps into the plains of Lombardy and the Veneto to begin his work for The Stones of Venice, he did so with a mind full of memories of mountain precipices, from the previous summer of geological research, centred at Chamonix, towards the Of Mountain Beauty fourth volume of Modern Painters – written in defence of the mountain forms in the art of J. M. W. Turner. As Ruskin acidly remarks at the outset of ‘The Wall Veil’ chapter of The Stones of Venice, ‘there are sometimes more valuable lessons to be learned in the school of nature than in that of Vitruvius . . .’.53 In this mostly geological chapter, the lesson is to be read from the ‘coursed masses of precipice’ of the eastern front of Mont Cervin (The Matterhorn) – ‘the most noble cliff in Europe’.54 And the message is this: that these mighty, unyielding mountain faces are in fact largely built of frail materials that ‘few architects would like to build with’, namely a ‘loose and slaty shale, of a dull brick-red colour, which yields beneath the foot like ashes . . .’.55 So it seems ‘as if the mountain were upheld by miracle’, but the ‘great Builder’ has bound these loose shales at intervals with ‘a course of living rock, of quartz as white as the snow that encircles it, and harder than a band of steel’.56 Drawing from these observations a key and influential principle of architectural stratification, Ruskin concludes ‘with great certainty that it is better and easier to strengthen a wall necessarily of imperfect substance, as of brick, by introducing carefully laid courses of stone, than by adding to its thickness . . .’.57 Moreover, there are weighty ‘decorative reasons for adopting the coursed arrangement’.58 Among the pages of analysis and exquisite drawings given to the Cervin in Modern Painters Ruskin ponders, ‘is it not a strange type of the things which “out of weakness are made strong” ’ that out of these feeble materials ‘the axe of God should hew that Alpine tower’.59 Ruskin’s use of ‘type’ here, and the quoting of St Paul’s ‘Letter to the Hebrews’, explicitly invokes his ‘typological’ evangelical reading of both the Bible and creation itself as divine manuscript. Ruskin declared his first sight of the Alps as ‘not only the revelation of the beauty of the earth, but the opening of the first page of its volume’.60 Read symbolically, the miraculous might of the Cervin is a ‘type’ of what the ‘great Builder’ can make out of humanity’s frailty; just as well\n\n20\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nconceived architectural wall-faces of ‘imperfect substance’ encode the same human drama. It is often assumed that a symbol in architecture, while representing some ideal, is as appliqué as a postmodern sign. This is not borne out here; for his evangelical readers Moses is a real historical figure and is also a ‘type’ of Christ, whose person and actions symbolically foreshadow the events of the New Testament. Ruskin brings into view the cliff of the Cervin as existent and metaphorically a manuscript written by God; the surfaces of architecture as substance and emblematic text. Chamonix and Venice, mountains and architecture, landscape and building, Modern Painters and Stones of Venice; out of his strained effort of geologizing, sampling, drawing, measuring, Ruskin erects his ‘superstructure in progress’ where the eight volumes of both texts make one vast reciprocal whole. Ruskin said that ‘all Modern Painters together will be the explanation of a parenthesis in The Stones of Venice’, but he also saw it the other way round, whereby the whole of Stones of Venice explains a point in Modern Painters.61 Appropriately, after a few days in Milan, one of Ruskin’s first subjects of analysis was the ‘richly striped’ cathedral of Monza to the north-east. On 1 November 1849, his diary describes ‘a glorious drive from Milan – view of Monte Rosa the finest I have ever seen, some five miles beyond Monza . . .’.62 In proximity to this – the second highest massif in the Alps – the façade of Monza (completed 1396) is itself a broad striated cliff of stone, divided into five bays by shallow buttresses. Ruskin records ‘the stripes of serpentine with which the whole façade is barred horizontally’,63 noting how these courses slope to become voussoirs that integrate the ‘two remarkable windows’, of three lights and Gothic geometric tracery, to each side of the entrance porch. The banded façade soars sheer as a precipice to a delicate ‘roof cornice’ of the most elaborate of the four cornice forms classified in Stones of Venice, where the upper projecting stone bracket receives support from a shaft borne on another jutting bracket below. Ruskin considered this type as ‘evidently adapted’ for the character of stone buildings and ‘susceptible of the richest decoration, and superbly employed in the cornice of the cathedral of Monza’.64 His field notes record ‘the cornice running up each side of the broad gable pediment is very beautiful, though quaint’, and a pocket-book drawing captures with precision the rich ‘shadows taken at one in the afternoon’ cast by its intricate brackets, shafts, and linking cusped arches.65 Here is the same geologizing eye that tracked the shadows of the crests of the Cervin and marked the ‘silver cornices glittering along the edge of each’ of its iron bands.66 So near the Alps, it is not fanciful to see precipice strength, and glittering crest, in the Gothic imaginations of the builders of this wall-face of green serpentine and pale pink marble mounting to its crystalline cornice. Gothic yes, but of a conservative Romanesque kind; and it was to the Romanesque itself of the northern Italy mainland that Ruskin looked for models of the constructed wall-veil, as compared to the marble-sheeted or stuccoed surfaces of Venetian Gothic incrustation. Consequently, in the important plate in Stones of Venice of ‘Wall-Veil Decoration’ in which Ruskin compares two surfaces – a living Romanesque\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n21\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Monza, Duomo façade, completed 1396.

Ruskin offers multiple readings to argue the merits of the constructed, polychromatic wall-veil: It is perfectly natural that the different kinds of stone used in its successive courses should be of different colours; and there are many associations and analogies which metaphysically justify the introduction of horizontal bands of colour, or of light and shade. They are, in the first place, a kind of expression of the growth or age of the wall, like the rings in the wood of a tree; then they are a farther symbol of the alternation of light and darkness, which was above noted as the source of charm of many inferior mouldings: again, they are valuable as an expression of horizontal space to the imagination, space of which the conception is opposed, and gives more effect by its opposition, to the enclosing power of the wall itself ( . . . probably the great charm of these horizontal bars to the Arabian mind): and again they are valuable in their suggestion of the natural courses of rocks, and beds of the earth itself. And to all these powerful imaginative reasons we have to add the merely ocular charm of interlineal opposition of colour.67 Layered here are the key languages examined earlier: the picturesque agemark registered in the wall’s growth, the symbolic messages embodied in the stones themselves and their typological import, and the pictorial and\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n23\n\niconographic magic latent in pattern, colour, and ornament. The San Pietro detail derives from a daguerreotype. Ruskin was an early enthusiast for this photographic process invented by Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre (made public in 1839) whereby a silver-coated copper plate is sensitized with iodine fumes and exposed to sunlight in a camera obscura. Ruskin called them ‘sundrawings’, delighting in the suggestive chiaroscuro and minutiae of texture of their elusive mirrored images, which intensified his innate immersion in the architectural surface. He bought his first daguerreotypes when in Venice in 1845, went on to commission many others, and had acquired his own equipment by 1849 (producing images with his manservant ‘George’ Hobbs). As he enthused in a letter to his father of 7 October 1845 from Venice: ‘Daguerreotypes taken by this vivid sunlight are glorious things. It is very nearly the same thing as carrying off the palace itself – every chip of stone & stain is there . . .’.68 They enabled further rich transactions in Ruskin’s visual economy as he drew from them as subjects and used them as sources for his published plates; they in turn intensified and extended his established modes of surface representation. Many of the Tuscany daguerreotypes are of a high professional standard and were probably produced under Ruskin’s direction; ‘the group of Pistoia scenes, in particular, contains some tours de force – demonstrating bold composition, startling detail and stunning tonalities’.69 The c. 1846 daguerreotype of San Pietro’s façade (completed 1263) – on which the\n\nFIGURE 1.6 John Ruskin and Le Cavalier Iller, Pistoia, Church of San Pietro, c. 1846.

Repudiating generalized topography, the camera’s cropping techniques encouraged Ruskin’s oral and haptic appetite for the surfaces of architecture, as in the notorious letter to his father from Verona of 2 June 1852: ‘I should like to draw all St Mark’s and all this Verona stone by stone, to eat it all up into my mind, touch by touch’.70 The Stones of Venice is entirely illustrated by hard-looking at such fragments of surface and detail, and in the Tuscany and Venetian daguerreotypes close-ups predominate.\n\nBanding the British surface But what did all these Italian wanderings portend for a British architecture of greater surface tension than the classical clubhouses of London’s St James? Returning to Eastlake’s point that Ruskin was able to strike a vibrant ‘chord of human sympathy’ beyond ecclesiastical feelings, historicism, and a vague picturesque; he was able to do this because many of the elements that fused to create Ruskinian Gothic were already in debate. Says Eastlake: ‘All that had been argued – all that had been preached on the subject previously, was cast into the shade by the vigour of [Ruskin’s] protest’.71 Ruskin’s insights synthesized the extant factors that worked towards a more intense reading of the wall-surface. Factors that included: speculations around the new science of geology and its relations to architecture; questions concerning architecture, symbolism, and meaning; interests in architectural polychromy and a fascination with broader sources in Greece, Byzantium, and Arabia; arguments as to how to make architecture ‘new’, avoiding the ‘copyism’ of history; and – interweaving all these notions – the idea of architecture as an ethical practice of making. Aware of these surface architecture experiments, Ruskin ruminated: No subject has been more open ground of dispute among architects than the decoration of the wall-veil, because no decoration appeared naturally to grow out of its construction. . . . It has become, therefore, a kind of general field for experiments of various effects of surface ornament, or has been abandoned altogether to the mosaicist and fresco painter.72 One such experiment is singled out in Stones of Venice for qualified praise: ‘The church of Christchurch, Streatham, lately built, though spoiled by many grievous errors (the ironwork in the campanile being the grossest), yet affords the inhabitants of the district a means of obtaining some idea of the variety of effects which are possible with no other material than brick’.73 In this south London church (1840–2), the architect James Wild brought together the\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n25\n\ngrowing interests in Byzantine and Islamic architecture as evident, for example, in the ornament and colour theories of his brother-in-law Owen Jones.74 Restrained in terms of what was to come, the passages of constructed polychromy in Christ Church’s broad plain surfaces of ochre brick are striking enough; there is the zig-zag pyramidal roof of the campanile, the accented cornice, and most of all the voussoirs of the clerestory windows, and the major and minor pointed arches of the west front which are picked out in syncopated alternations of red bricks and glazed yellow bricks, evenly separated by yellow stock bricks.75 The overall aspect of the church is broadly ‘Byzantine’ in its simple cubic masses and plain soaring campanile, but the pointed western arches are definitely Islamic with their inner and outer curves characteristically struck from different centres. The colouration of these voussoirs derives from images like the coloured plates of the mosques of Cairo in Pascal Coste’s Architecture Arabe ou Monuments du Kaire of 1839. Ruskin’s point on the spatial appeal of ‘horizontal bars [of colour] to the Arabian mind’ has been quoted. Earlier in Stones of Venice he opines how the Arab school only employs its intricate Arabesque ornament for ‘features of interest’, but bars its larger ‘surfaces with horizontal lines of colour, the expression of the level of the Desert’,76 thus he makes another geophysical parallel, equal to that of Venice’s mutable sands, and the natural courses of Alpine rocks. For Ruskin the Venetians ‘were the only people who had thoroughly sympathized with the Arabs . . . intense love of colour’.77 His racializing orientalism is most famously summed up in the image of the Ducal Palace, Venice as the ‘central building of the world’, for its exact fusion of the Roman, Lombard, and Arab, the fluxes of North and South – ‘the glacier torrent and the lava stream’.78 Influenced by the milieu of Owen Jones, Wild himself travelled to Egypt in 1842 where he designed the Anglican church of St Mark in Alexandria. In turn, he supplied Jones with the material on ‘Arabian Ornament’ of his hugely influential The Grammar of Ornament of 1856.79 Of no interest to Ruskin – given his loathing of surface-less iron architecture – was Jones’s success in applying his colour theories to the vast structure of the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In terms of the constructed ornamental brick surface, the much publicized Christ Church was a significant staging post in making brick acceptable as a material, along with stone, for church architecture. The potential of brick in Britain was further advanced by the repeal of the brick tax in 1850, by rapid advances in manufacturing techniques such as tunnelkilns, and by a growing railway distribution network.\n\nButterfield: All Saints’, Margaret Street and the Savage Surface Wild’s tentative experiments in brickwork pale beside the great manifesto for constructional colour of William Butterfield’s All Saints’, Margaret\n\n26\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nStreet, London which was designed, constructed and ornamented over a long period from 1849. The cornerstone was laid on 9 November 1850 and it was not consecrated until 28 May 1859, although it was structurally complete by late 1852. Setting aside their earlier prejudice against such an ostensibly humble material, the ecclesiastic party of the Church of England expressed the following hopes for Butterfield’s church plans, in their own journal The Ecclesiologist: The founders and the architect of this church are anxious to make it a practical example of what we are very anxious to see tested, viz., constructional polychrome. The material of the building, and of the appended clergy and chorister-houses is to be red and black brick, arranged in patterns, with stone windows and bonding in the church. Internally there is to be a use of coloured marble, which was of course impossible in the middle ages.80 The church has sometimes been thought to be antecedent to Ruskin’s influence, but within its extended construction period there is evidence ‘that the decision to make All Saints’ a gorgeous display of coloured stones and tiles rather than a plastered frescoed interior was taken after Ruskin’s publication of The Seven Lamps of Architecture in May 1849’.81 A letter of 6 August 1849, written by the principal patron, Alexander Beresford-Hope, confirms the change in the original 1849 plans. The original cost estimate was on the supposition of [the church] being merely built of common materials. Since then the aesthetic possibilities of different materials have become more and more clear, and the present scheme is that of a church whose character and beauty and effect of colour shall arise from construction and not from superaddition, namely that the pillars shall be made of granite . . . the diaper be an encrustation of tiles, and not the track of a paintbrush, and so on.82 In ‘The Lamp of Beauty’ of The Seven Lamps, Ruskin cannot ‘consider architecture as in anywise perfect without colour’, and these ‘colours of architecture should be those of natural stones’ with their ‘lovely and mellow hues’.83 The other key naturalistic colour principle enunciated here is that shown earlier by the diaperings of the Ducal Palace of Venice, that is to say how colour in nature ‘never follows form, but is arranged on an entirely separate system. . . . The stripes of a zebra do not follow the lines of its body or limbs, still less the spots of a leopard’.84 Correspondingly, ‘we are to consider our building as a kind of organized creature; in colouring we must look to the single and separate organized creatures of Nature’ – such as zebras and leopards. Since its splay-footed spire first soared above Margaret Street – bracketed by the fiercely black-and-red chequered gables of its choir-school, gateway,\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n27\n\nand clergy-house – All Saints’ has been recognized as a masterpiece of High Victorian Gothic, its ‘savage’ surfaces spawning a far-reaching critical heritage. The choir-school and clergy-house grip a constricted entrance court on this tight urban site. Placing the church to the north of the small plot, Butterfield wedged its entrance porch into the north-west corner of his court, between the east wall of the choir-school, and the south wall of the nave. The worshipper enters the aisle directly passing a baptistery, formed under the tower, immediately on the left. The nave has just three broad bays which lead quite directly into the deep and high chancel; although there is an arch and a change of level between nave and chancel, the effect is of a unitary space. The east-end is a solid party-wall, so this sombrely glowing church is lit only from its high clerestories and the west window. Weighing all the evidence, Paul Thompson concludes that the choice of brick in itself probably belongs to the first stage of All Saints’ design, but that ‘the external patterning of the brick, the theoretical idea of internal mosaics, and the internal use of granite and alabaster may be definitely attributed to Ruskin’.85 Butterfield’s polychromatic exteriors also draw on such experiments as have been seen in Wild’s work and precedents he knew of in English Tudor building and in German brickwork. But the interior is quite another matter, and further evidence of Ruskin’s stimulus as Butterfield’s ‘only experiment in “encrustation”, that is a mere skin of brick and tile mosaic rather than structural colour’.86 Says Thompson: ‘No other architect so consistently explored both the material expressiveness of wall architecture, and its discipline through wall planes; and, at the same time, through colour, the triumphant joy of faith, and through line and pattern, the insecurity of an age of doubt and change’.87 The extent of constructional colour in British Victorian architecture from the 1850s is owing to this collective influence of text and building, to Ruskin’s Seven Lamps and Stones of Venice, and Butterfield’s bold manifestation of polychromy’s potential in wall-surface architecture. To which must be added George Edmund Street’s texts and buildings as examined later. Remembering the ecclesiastics’ ambition for All Saints’ that the ornament should ‘arise from construction and not from superaddition . . . the diaper be an encrustation of tiles, and not the track of a paintbrush’, terms in use at the time included ‘constructional colouration’ to describe the combination of building materials of several intrinsic hues; also the phrase ‘permanent polychrome’ to distinguish lasting techniques from the fugitive ‘track of a paintbrush’ where ornament is stencilled or brushed in on plaster.88 The means of representation thus encompass a spectrum; from the paint-onplaster of much Venetian diapering, to the thin incrusted ‘construction’ of mosaic and sheets of marble, to a more solid banded construction, as in the church façades of Pistoia or All Saints’ own external brickwork. Given the insurmountable task of building a school of living sculpture in the mid-nineteenth century, Ruskin was driven to conclude that ‘the only manner of rich ornament that is open to us is the geometrical colour-mosaic,\n\n28\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nand that much might result from our strenuously taking up this mode of design’.89 That is stated in the ‘Lamp of Life’ of Seven Lamps, while the ‘Lamp of Beauty’ calls for ‘breadth of flat surface’ and ‘vivid colour introduced in flat geometrical panels’.90 Butterfield’s bold response to such Ruskin challenges can be seen, in all its vigour of pattern and scintillating tonality, in the black-and-white perspective of All Saints’ interior published by The Builder of 4 June 1859. The rich English Decorated Gothic mouldings of the nave-arches dramatize the ‘breadth of flat surface’ of the spandrels, where great shield-like discs turn on chequered fields of brick and tile. Ruskin categorizes the spandrel as the first of three wall-veil zones ‘fitted for surface decoration of the most elaborate kind’91 (the others are the tympanum and the space between an arch and its gable) and firstly recommends circle-forms. The Seven Lamps illustrates a sculpted spandrel from the cathedral of Lisieux where discs roll around a central rosette (the All Saints’ principle), and the first volume of Stones of Venice gives a detailed plate of the noble spandrel decoration of the Ducal Palace incrusted with red Verona, white, and grey marbles enfolding a central disc of green serpentine. Ruskin stresses ‘this decoration by discs, or shield-like ornaments [as] a marked characteristic of Venetian architecture in its earliest ages’.92 The dates allow for this Ruskin influence on the polychromatic shield-forms of All Saints’ decoration, but a more likely source for the actual mosaicist patterns are the boldly coloured plates of Matthew Digby Wyatt’s Specimens of the Geometrical Mosaics of the Middle Ages of 1849. Wyatt published Specimens as the outcome of a European tour commissioned by the mosaic producer John Marriott Blashfield. Technological progress in manufacture, such as that of ‘encaustic’ tiles around 1839, furthered the aforementioned desire for permanent colouration inspired by such Italian and Oriental exemplars.93 The Ruskinian colour-model was then crucial to the development of All Saints’, but to what extent is it a zebra or a Ducal Palace – that ‘kind of organized creature’ where the colour surfaces work on an independent system to the form? For Henry-Russell Hitchcock, it is entirely a zebra where ‘the lack of coordination at All Saints’ between window arrangement and surface pattern exceeds that to be seen on the Venetian palace which was Ruskin’s chief exemplar of over-all polychrome wall treatment . . .’.94 Whereas Paul Thompson holds that ‘the colour patterns at All Saints’ are in fact clearly defined by the architectural surfaces, as may be seen from the placing of circular motifs’ as just discussed.95 In arbitration, between these critics, let us take the elevation of the south aisle to the courtyard where the polychromy is made from combinations of red and black brickwork and ochre stone. Butterfield bands these materials to the springing of the arch, and chequers the arch-zone – following structural logic. This constricted wall has complicated rhythms with one wide and a pair of narrow arches divided by a pinnacled buttress; but in all cases Butterfield centres his chequer-patterns to the intervals, and the ochre squares at the centres of the\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n29\n\nFIGURE 1.7 All Saints’ Margaret Street.

It would have taken exact setting-out to achieve this across these varied divisions – Ruskin would have allowed freepattern. Yet it is also possible to agree that the impression, outside and in, of the assault to the eye of these dense fields of patterned brick and mosaic is of sovereignly extended wall-veils following laws of their own. Never again would Butterfield deploy mosaic incrustation to the level of All Saints’. His last masterpiece, St Paul’s Cathedral in Melbourne, Australia, designed in 1878, has an interior that is pure Siena, its stripes of grey basalt alternating with cream limestone make it ‘his noblest tribute to the Italian masters of constructional colour’.96 Butterfield’s hauntingly refractory wall-planes resonate through the whole period of this enquiry, interlacing an extensive critical legacy, and the minds and works of many architects whether Modernist, Brutalist, Postmodern, or Late-Modern; they can be said to have engendered a cult of the Savage or Grotesque surface. The well-known first characteristic of Ruskin’s ‘Nature of Gothic’ (The Stones of Venice, vol. 2) is ‘Savageness’ where he contrasts the earth-veils between ‘Northern and Southern countries’: ‘Syria and Greece, Italy and Spain, laid like pieces of a golden pavement into the sea-blue’ against the ‘masses of leaden rock and heathy moor’ of northern lands. Then the coats of creatures, those ‘striped zebras’ again, and the ‘spotted leopards’ of warmer climates, as compared to the ‘shaggy covering, and dusky plumage’ of northern fauna. So we will watch\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n31\n\n‘with reverence’ the Mediterranean builder of surfaces ‘as he sets side by side the burning gems, and smooths with soft sculpture the jasper pillars, that are to reflect a ceaseless sunshine’, but must not despise his northern brother when ‘with rough strength and hurried stroke, he . . . heaves into the darkened air the pile of iron buttress and rugged wall . . .’.97 In Ruskin’s Savage, ostensibly negative qualities such as ‘ignorance’, ‘ugliness’, ‘formlessness’ can be read as ‘signs of the life and liberty of every workman who struck the stone’ as when we ‘gaze upon the old cathedral front’ to enjoy ‘the fantastic ignorance of the old sculptors’, their ‘ugly goblins, and formless monsters’.98 Closely allied to the Savage is the fourth ‘mental characteristic’ of Gothic – the Grotesque. In Stones of Venice, the ‘Grotesque’ category is briefly alluded to in the ‘Nature of Gothic’ chapter, but then deferred to the chapter on ‘Grotesque Renaissance’ where it is presented in its negative capacity as a symbol of ‘The Fall’ of Venice, as in Ruskin’s revulsion at the deformed ‘huge, inhuman, and monstrous’ keystone head to the doorway to the Baroque campanile (1611) of the church of Santa Maria Formosa.99 The first plate of volume three of Modern Painters contrasts ‘True and False Griffins’. The Lombard-Gothic griffin is a living synthesis of the lion and eagle’s predatory power, as it bears upon its back the whole weight of the porch of Verona’s Duomo, while nonchalantly seizing a winged dragon in its fierce claws. Whereas, in Ruskin’s analysis, the ‘false’ Classical griffin (from the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, Rome) is an implausible assemblage of the two creatures’ body-parts, barely able to bend the tendril on which its limply extended paw rests. Correspondingly, in painting or literature, true ‘grotesque is the expression, in a moment, by a series of symbols thrown together in bold and fearless connection, of truths which it would have taken a long time to express in any verbal way, and of which the connection is left for the beholder to work out for himself; the gaps, left or overleaped by the haste of the imagination, forming the grotesque character’.100 In The Stones of Venice, Ruskin argues that ‘there is very little architecture in the world which is, in the full sense of the words, good and noble’ – some Gothic and Romanesque, two or three Greek temples perhaps – the remainder depends for its ‘power on some development of the grotesque spirit’. In domestic architecture of the Middle Ages it is felt in ‘fantastic gables’, in ‘pinnacled roofs’, in ‘the blackened timbers, crossed and carved into every conceivable waywardness of imagination, of Normandy and old England’, in ‘rude hewing’ of material, and the like.101 For Ruskin, it is important to discriminate between Grotesque effects – produced ‘exclusively by the fancy of man’ – from those of the Picturesque with its associated agemarks ‘produced by the working of nature and of time’.102 Putting all this together, Grotesque architecture expresses itself in strange, or terrible amalgamations, or in jarring juxtapositions of form and symbol, playing its fancies out in waywardly restless surfaces, somewhat roughly wrought. John Summerson revisited Ruskin’s Savage and Grotesque theme in an article in The Architectural Review in December 1945, where he included\n\n32\n\nSHAPING THE SURFACE\n\nhis own photographs of the bombed-out shells of two of Butterfield’s major churches – St Matthias, Stoke Newington and St Alban’s, Holborn – thrusting into the dark post-Blitz London skies the bare silhouettes and ‘rugged walls’ of their great saddle-back towers.103 For Summerson, Butterfield’s ‘hard red brick’ in which ‘he set those multiple black bands and innocently crude diapers’ oppose vigorous ‘workmanship to sensibility . . . they are the “noble grotesque” as against the “ignoble grotesque” of rustication and of the kind of architecture which grew out of the drawing board and T-square’.104 Butterfield, he continues, ‘loved the awkwardness inseparable from most early Gothic; he loved its strength and adolescence, its coltish negligence. He loved that his porch at All Saints’ should collide grotesquely with the wall of the Clergy House . . .’.105 In architectural composition, this is Ruskin’s Grotesque definition of ‘bold and fearless connection’ where the ‘connection is left for the beholder to work out for himself’. ‘All Butterfield’s churches are to a greater or less degree ugly’, asserts Summerson, a Savage quality seen in the All Saints’ interior where ‘he loved to clash the variableness of the pointed arch and to interrupt a rhythmical pattern in an agony of discord’.106 As Summerson rightly points out, the ‘ugliness’ theme goes back to the earliest responses to the building, even the mostly sympathetic Ecclesiologist praised All Saints’ ‘force and power’, but found here ‘the germ of the same dread of beauty, not to say the same preference of ugliness, which so characterizes in fuller development the later paintings of Mr Millais and his followers’.107 Here the reviewer refers to Millais’s Christ in the House of his Parents (derisively called ‘The Carpenter’s Shop’) exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1850 and attacked by The Times as ‘revolting . . . with no conceivable omission of misery, of dirt, of even disease’.108 From very different world-views, Butterfield and Millais are exploring authentic surfaces, communicating life’s workaday realism, and non-hierarchical in their evenness of handling; while in terms such as ‘ugliness’, ‘abruptness’, ‘uncouthness’, their critics unwittingly invoke the Savage and Grotesque. Butterfield’s visual pugnacity of congested, overscaled ‘zig-zags and stripes’ is, for H. S. Goodhart-Rendel, a ‘wincing . . . blow between the eyes delivered to them by the master’s violence . . .’109 – this was published in 1953 in a text based on lectures of 1934. And both Summerson and Ian Nairn (in Nairn’s London, 1966) associate Butterfield with the ‘Gothic’ of Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights allying his surfaces by association with Ruskin’s Savage Northern ‘masses of leaden rock and heathy moor’; on All Saints’ Nairn writes: ‘Here is the force of Wuthering Heights translated into dusky red and black bricks. . . . The proportions and transfigured gilded violence of this unexpected Heathcliff burn through any artificiality’.110 Looking forward, many links can be found between Butterfield and later Brutalist, and British Modernist, ethics and aesthetics. For example, Elain Harwood points to the Architectural Review of November 1972 where Mark Girouard – reviewing James Stirling’s Florey Building in Oxford – pairs an image of this student accommodation with\n\nREADING THE WALL-SURFACE\n\n33\n\nThe Builder interior of All Saints’ of 1853: ‘Previous to Stirling the only group of architects I know of to work out a consistent prismatic style of hard shiny surfaces were the hard-line Gothicists of the mid-nineteenth century, with Butterfield as their leader’.111\n\n‘Natural horizontal courses’: Street’s All Saints, Boyne Hill One rather earlier project took Ruskin’s idea of constructional architectural colour, and stratified flat wall-surfaces, to its logical extreme – the closely banded chancel walls of George Edmund Street’s All Saints, Boyne Hill, Berkshire of 1854–7, his earliest masterwork in polychromy, and a church actually consecrated before Butterfield’s long-gestated All Saints’. A theorist, as well as a major architect, Street was the most influential critic after Ruskin associated with the formation of High Victorian Gothic; the ‘development’ of this style of architecture intriguingly progressed – not along the ostensibly ‘obvious line of the ferrovitreous architecture of the C"
