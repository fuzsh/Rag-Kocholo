I began my research at the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin, an ideal setting for any kind of serious work and perhaps especially for starting a new project. I am grateful to its rector, Wolf Lepenies, to his gracious and accommodating sta´, and to all of my colleagues at Kolleg who provided me with good company and intellectual companionship. Monika Steinhauser deserves special mention for her valiant e´orts to teach me something about art history. Most of the book was written with the support of a Research Prize from that model of institutional ¶exibility and generosity, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. My debts to my German hosts, Hans-Ulrich Wehler at the University of Bielefeld and Josef Becker at the University of Augsburg, are too numerous to count. More important, Renate and Uli Wehler and Ruth and Josef Becker have nourished and sustained me for years with their love and hospitality. They represent for me the Platonic ideal of friendship. I want to thank the many friends and colleagues who read the manuscript, untied the knots of error, tamed unruly syntax, and suggested fruitful new lines of analysis. Whatever its remaining faults, this is a better book because of Paula Findlen, Kathleen James, David Kennedy, Fritz Stern, and Rudy Weingartner. Thomas LeBien forced me to tell the story I wanted to tell, which is exactly what an editor should do. Kevin Repp, Myong Lee, Karin Hall, Chad Bryant, and Ron Davies helped at various stages of the research and writing; all of them made the author’s life easier. Finally, I am grateful to Margaret Lavinia Anderson for her integrity, harmony, and radiance—and for much else besides. Berkeley, California November 1999\n\nJ. J. S.\n\nPicture Credits Figure 1.

As the guardians of the world’s artistic treasures, they provide opportunities to see things that might otherwise be lost or forgotten; they encourage public appreciation of art, preserve essential scholarly skills, and foster historical research. But museums create as well as conserve. They establish the explanatory frames within which individual objects can be understood; they a·rm artistic signiµcance—indeed, they help us to decide what is and is not art. As the conservators and creators of artistic value, museums are also expressions of power—the political and economic power of those who build them, the professional power of those who deµne their mission and shape their collections, and the social power of those upon whom they depend for sustenance and support. Museums everywhere have certain things in common, but they are also shaped by their historical settings; they have, in other words, histories of their own besides the manifest narrative that their collections are organized to impart.1 This book traces the history of art museums in the German states from the second half of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth. My purpose is to examine the relationship between German museums and their historical context, especially the relationship between the development of museums and changes in artistic theory and practice. I have sought to approach the museum at a middle level of analysis, between the general surveys and the individual case studies that make up most of the large and expanding literature on the history of museums.2 I hope that this level will provide a perspective from which we can learn something both about art and museums in general and about their distinctive place in German politics, culture, and society. The book’s organization is roughly chronological. Chapter 1 examines the intellectual and institutional origins of German art museums in the court culture and public discourse of the eighteenth century. Chapter 2 focuses on the ways that German intellectuals and civil servants deployed museums as part of their e´orts to confront the cultural and political crises of the revolutionary era. Chapter 3, which is devoted to the middle decades of the nineteenth century, traces how the development of museums re¶ected and in¶uenced historicism’s problematic triumph in aesthetic theory and artistic practice. Chapter 4 treats the response of museums to changes in the\n\nxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nworld of art at the end of the nineteenth century, changes that challenged many of the museum’s foundational assumptions at the same time that they rea·rmed its place as a source of artistic value and meaning. The four chapters have the same tripartite structure. Each begins with a discussion of ideas about art, both in the work of a few in¶uential thinkers (Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Nietzsche) and in the writings of less well-known scholars, critics, and journalists. We then turn from ideas to institutions; the second section of each chapter examines the relationship of museums to their social and political context, and also the organizational development of the museums themselves. Each chapter concludes with a discussion of speciµc museum buildings whose design and decoration re¶ected contemporary ideas about art’s nature and purpose and art’s institutional place in politics and society. Although the chapter sections might be read chronologically (rather than sequentially) as intellectual, institutional, and architectural histories of art museums, the book’s primary purpose is to demonstrate how these ideas, institutions, and structures worked together. Finally, I should say a word about the concept of an art world, which serves as my central analytical category. I use art world in two ways. First, following Arthur Danto, I use it to mean the theories, assumptions, and historical experiences that shape the way we see art as art.3 But even in its most abstract formulations, this theoretical art world is connected to patterns of behavior; aesthetic theories, like ethical principles, always imply certain kinds of practice. I also use art world, therefore, in Howard Becker’s institutional sense, to refer to “the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produces the kind of art that [the] art world is noted for.”4 In short, my notion of an art world assumes the persistent interaction of aesthetic ideas and artistic institutions, without granting priority to either. Because the art world is embedded in its historical context, its ideas and values are inseparable parts of the wider culture; its institutions, of the larger social, economic, and political realm. The story of the art world is therefore also the story of political institutions and the rise of a “public” culture, of national aspirations and social upheaval, of academic disciplines and bureaucratic ambition, of established elites and new money. There is a distinctively German version of this story, even though Germans were in¶uenced by, and in turn in¶uenced, developments in Europe and America. The reader will µnd here some familiar German themes: the persistence of monarchical authority, the importance of bureaucratic institutions, the close link between culture and nationalism, the social and cultural preeminence of academic elites, and the increasing fragmentation of the middle classes. Philosophy and scholarship, wealth and power, the organization of society and state all played their parts in creating and sustaining the art world within which museums grew. But although art is not, and never can be,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxiii\n\nautonomous, neither is it merely a re¶ection of some deeper reality. It is always a mistake to “explain” art (or, for that matter, any other signiµcant historical phenomenon) by making it disappear into something else. To understand the art world, we must grasp not only its connections to other ideas and institutions but also its own conventions, values, and structures. The best place to begin, therefore, is with the idea of art itself.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nMuseums in the German Art World\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\nART MUSEUMS REST ON THREE FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS that took shape within the eighteenth-century art world. Most obviously, the museum assumes that there is such a thing as art. Otherwise, its Attic vases, medieval altarpieces, and dynastic portraits would have nothing in common; they were, after all, made in di´erent ways and designed to serve di´erent ends. Only because they can all be regarded as “art” can the museum’s diverse contents occupy the same physical space and share the same matrix of meaning. Because they are art, they can all be experienced “aesthetically”: that is to say, as things valuable for their own sake, without practical purpose. But museums are not without a social purpose; their claim to public resources and private support depends on the belief that aesthetic experience is somehow beneµcial to individuals and society. This is the second foundational assumption: that separating art from the everyday world creates a setting in which visitors can comprehend the connections between art, truth, and morality. Museums, therefore, are supposed to promote beauty, virtue, and enlightenment. Finally, museums also rest upon an awareness of historical movement, which celebrates the value of past art and recognizes the need to protect and conserve it for the future. Among museums’ most important sources of in¶uence is the historical meaning and the promise of permanence they o´er to the treasures they contain. In the eighteenth century, these ideas about the aesthetic, ethical, and historical value of art were joined with another of the museum’s foundational convictions, that its contents should be open and accessible to the public. Like the other public institutions that emerged in the eighteenth century, museums were the result of profound changes in the way culture was created and experienced, changes in what it meant to be an artist, and in how art was perceived. In German Europe, these changes took place in two distinct but overlapping institutional settings: µrst, in what is now thought of as “the public sphere,” within which people viewed, heard, read, and discussed art, music, and literature; second, in the princely courts, which remained signiµcant sites for both the production and display of the visual and performing arts. The reciprocal relationship of court and public was architecturally expressed\n\n4\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nby the µrst art galleries and museums, in which princes opened their collections to their subjects.\n\nI. Art, Morality, and History\n\nIn his in¶uential work Allgemeine Theorie der schönen Künste (Universal theory of the µne arts [1771–1774]), Johann Georg Sulzer deµned aesthetics as a “new term, which was invented to describe a branch of knowledge that has only existed for a few years. It is the philosophy of the µne arts.”1 Like economics, which emerged at about the same time, aesthetics readjusted epistemological boundaries by gathering into a single discipline a series of issues that had previously been examined separately. Both the science of aesthetics and its subject, what Sulzer called the “µne arts,” were eighteenth-century inventions. As Paul Kristeller showed in his seminal essay “The Modern System of the Arts,” the use of the term art to include only painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and poetry is of relatively recent provenance. Not until the Renaissance were the visual arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture severed from the crafts with which they had been associated; equally important, in the µfteenth century, Italian humanists sought to enhance the prestige of painting by stressing its similarities to literature. Painters, like poets, could now lay claim to a special status, markedly superior to that of the artisans who wove tapestries, hammered gold, or made pottery. The µnal step in the creation of art was taken in the µrst half of the eighteenth century, when music was added to literature and the three visual arts. Thereafter, it became common to assume that these activities required skills and talents di´erent from those of handicrafts and that they produced sorts of knowledge and experience di´erent from those of the sciences.2 Thus began what M. H. Abrams has called the “Copernican revolution” in the deµnition of art: the creation of “art as such,” a distinctive kind of activity with its own purpose, meaning, and history.3 The Primacy of Perception\n\nMuseums are places where art is seen, not created. Their emergence was part of a transformation in the art world which Abrams describes as a shift from “the maker’s” to the “perceiver’s stance.”4 This shift was essential for the invention of art as art. After all, from the viewpoint of the musician, poet, painter, sculptor, and architect, the ways of making art—composing a fugue, writing a sonnet, painting a picture, carving a statue, designing a building— constituted quite di´erent kinds of creative activity. It was possible to suppose that music, poetry, pictures, statues, and buildings were alike only when one turned from how they were made to the responses they evoked in their listeners, readers, or viewers. The new philosophy of art, therefore, was\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n5\n\nprimarily concerned not with the nature of artistic objects or the skills necessary to produce them but rather with art’s subjective e´ects on those who experienced it. From the start, aesthetics was closely associated with the analysis of perception, cognition, and imagination.5 Throughout the eighteenth century, artists and writers were concerned with the psychological origins and e´ects of artistic experience. Consider, for example, two prints by Daniel Chodowiecki (µg. 1).6 These were part of the series “Natürliche und afectierte Handlungen des Lebens” (Natural and a´ected modes of behavior), which appeared, with text by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, in Göttinger Taschen-Calender in 1779 and 1780. Each print depicts two young men in front of a statue of Flora. In the “a´ected” form of art appreciation, the observers seem more interested in each other than in the statue; their gestures and attitude are social and expressive rather than private and contemplative. In its “natural” counterpart, they stand in quiet appreciation of the object. Here, art is not part of a social scene with conventionalized responses; it is a subjective, spiritual, individual experience. Only through this “natural” approach can an authentic connection with the work of art be established—as Chodowiecki shows by having Flora now respond to her natural connoisseurs with a subtle but knowing smile.7 The philosophical study of aesthetic responses began in England and France, but it was given its most elaborate formulation in Germany. The µrst important German philosopher of art, and the µrst person to use the word aesthetics philosophically, was Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten.8 In many ways, Baumgarten was a transitional µgure whose philosophical training and style, like the Latin in which he wrote, remained closely tied to the conventions of seventeenth-century German rationalism. His point of departure was the expansion of rationalist epistemology to include sense perception. In the lectures that he delivered µrst at Halle, then at Frankfurt/Oder, and in his Aesthetica, parts of which were published in 1750 and 1758 but which remained unµnished at his death in 1762, Baumgarten developed the idea that aesthetics, “the science of sense cognition,” was logic’s younger sister, with a secondary but signiµcant place in the household of intellect. At the same time, he identiµed aesthetic truth with artistic beauty. Aesthetics, he stated at the very beginning of his treatise of 1750, is “the art of thinking beautifully,” and he deµned its goal as “the perfection of sense cognition as such, by which is meant beauty.”9 By associating beauty, perception, and perfection, Baumgarten set into motion a powerful philosophical project that conceived of art as the expression of a special kind of truth, with deep roots in our cognitive faculties. As his student and disciple G. F. Meier put it: “The beautiful sciences invigorate the whole man. . . . [They provide] the way for truth to gain access to the soul.”10 Moses Mendelssohn, in an essay on “the sources and connections of the µne arts and sciences,” published in 1757, expanded on Baumgarten’s analysis of art’s psychological roots: “Poetry, eloquence, beauty in shapes\n\n6\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\n1 (above and facing page). Daniel Chodowiecki, Connoisseurship (1779-1780).\n\nFIGURE\n\nand sounds penetrate through the various senses to our souls and rule over all our dispositions.” How, Mendelssohn asked, do these diverse experiences please us? Why do we regard them as “beautiful”? Because they all provide what he called that “sensuous expression of perfection” which is beauty’s common source.11 Beauty and Virtue\n\nIn these phrases by Baumgarten, Meier, and Mendelssohn about beauty, perfection, and the soul, we glimpse a preliminary formulation of the association of beauty and virtue which would play a persistently signiµcant part in the German art world and especially in the theory and practice of German art museums. Of course, as Robert Norton has recently pointed out, the idea that there is a special a·nity between beauty and goodness has a long history in\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\nFIGURE\n\n7\n\n1 (continued).\n\nEuropean culture. But in the eighteenth century, concern for the connection between them intensiµed.12 In part, this was because moral philosophy, like the philosophy of art, shifted its focus from the realm of action to the realm of subjective experience. Just as aesthetics deµned its subject as the psychological sources of beauty, so ethics came to be concerned with the psychological sources of goodness.13 During the last third of the eighteenth century, therefore, philosophers and artists tried to discover how goodness and beauty might be joined in what some of them called “the beautiful soul.” An early and widely read example of this enterprise can be found in the work of Johann Georg Sulzer (1720–1779). Born in Switzerland, Sulzer spent most of his adult life as a teacher and member of the reorganized Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Although deeply in¶uenced by Baumgarten and acquainted with Meier, Sulzer’s range of reference and experience was broader and more varied than that of these early writers on aesthetics.\n\n8\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nSulzer’s most important work was his Allgemeine Theorie der schönen Künste, µrst published in 1771 and 1774 and often reprinted thereafter; excerpts from it appeared (without Sulzer’s knowledge) in a supplementary volume of the Encyclopédie.14 Organized as a lexicon with 870 entries, the Allgemeine Theorie ranged from technical issues, such as the nature of ornament or allegory, to general discussions of aesthetic theory. Art, Sulzer argued, has its origins in our inherent desire to beautify the world in which we live. But art can also be a form of moral education: “The judicious use of the µne arts can bring to his full potential the man whose imaginative powers point him toward feeling beauty and whose heart points towards a feeling of goodness.”15 In art, beauty and goodness are inevitably joined, since every work of art worthy of the name must have moral power. This moral power has given art a central role in the long history of mankind from barbarism to enlightenment: “Reason and morality are the µrst requisites for those who would lift themselves out of the dust and elevate their nature, but this rising is consummated by taste, which completes both reason and morality. . . . Taste leaves nothing of man’s natural rawness, but makes him sensitive to all goodness.” On this vision of art’s historical role Sulzer based his belief in its social utility and political signiµcance. Because art can make humans more virtuous and therefore better citizens, Sulzer maintained, “the cultivation of taste is . . . a great national concern.”16 The experience of beauty, valuable in itself and as a source of individual virtue, could also help to produce a better civil order. Kant and the Knowledge of Beauty\n\nThe single most powerful philosophical examination of the relationship between beauty and virtue is to be found in Kant’s Critique of Judgement. Published in 1790, at the end of the extraordinary decade of creativity in which Kant produced his critiques of pure and practical reason, the Critique of Judgement tried to establish the foundations of the knowledge of beauty, just as the µrst two critiques had sought to ground the knowledge of experience and morality. At the same time, this third critique returned to themes from Kant’s work in the 1760s, when he had explored at some length the relationship between beauty and goodness, taste and virtue.17 Like most eighteenth-century writers on aesthetics, Kant was concerned with the psychological experience of beauty, not its outward form or nature. His µrst task was to clarify the di´erence between this experience and other kinds of pleasure. “Taste,” he wrote in a famous passage at the end of the book’s µrst section, “is the faculty of estimating an object or mode of representation by means of a delight or aversion apart from any interest. The object of such a delight is called beautiful.”18 The pleasure we take in “agreeable” things is inseparable from what Kant calls our “interest” in them. In order to enjoy the pleasures of a ripe peach, we must be able to taste it. But we can\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n9\n\ntake delight in beauty for its own sake; we are able to admire a painting of a bowl of fruit without any concern for how the fruit might taste or whether we can eat it. Once Kant had stated the subjectivity and autonomy of aesthetic experience, he then proceeded—in a typically Kantian move—to µnd grounds for a belief in its universality and connectedness. One need not follow the whole labyrinthine path of his argument to µnd two elements in Kant’s aesthetics that had a lasting impact on the art world in which museums would develop.19 First, we must not misunderstand what Kant meant by the autonomy of aesthetic experience. Although he certainly believed that such experience is disinterested, he did not see it as without purpose; it can and should both instruct and delight. Beauty expresses the moral order by bringing it into the sensory realm, thus making it more accessible: “The beautiful is the symbol of the morally good” (para. 59, p. 223). When we acquire taste— that is, the ability to apprehend beauty—we are able to approach morality along the even, level path of our senses: “Taste makes . . . the transition from the charm of sense to habitual moral interest possible without too violent a leap” (para. 59, p. 225). Kant dismisses art that seeks only to thrill or amuse. When art is not somehow combined with moral ideas, when its aim is “merely enjoyment,” it “renders the soul dull, the object in the course of time distasteful, and the mind dissatisµed with itself and ill-humoured” (para. 52, p. 191). Appreciating art, therefore, is at once an aesthetic and a moral act; genuine taste is possible only “when sensibility is brought into harmony with moral feeling” (para. 60, p. 227). Second, Kant insisted that just as aesthetic experience can be both autonomous and purposeful, so it is at once subjective and universal. He rejected the notion that each individual has his own taste. Taste, he insisted, is a kind of sensus communis, the product of a public process in which opinions are openly expressed and exchanged. And because the experience of beauty is necessarily collective, the appreciation of beauty is possible only in a society where it can be nourished and shared (para. 41, p. 155). In fact, by developing our taste, we intensify our social identity because we become aware that others make the same judgments. At the same time, a taste for art enhances our ability to share our feelings and sensations. Art, although an end in itself, “has the e´ect of advancing the culture of the mental powers in the interests of social communication” (para. 44, p. 166). Wrapped in these hard-edged abstractions is the vision of art as a source of the individual virtue and social cohesion which Kant, like many of his contemporaries, believed was necessary for progress and enlightenment in the modern world. As we shall see in chapter 2, in the 1790s, when revolutionary upheavals made the need for virtue and commmunity yet more urgent, this vision of art’s moral and political purpose would play an important part in the formation of the µrst art museums.\n\n10\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nWinckelmann and the Classical Ideal\n\nKant’s vision of a community enriched by the fusion of taste and virtue was also a central element in that admiration of ancient art and culture which is conventionally referred to as neoclassicism. Chronologically, the emergence of neoclassicism in German Europe roughly coincided with the development of philosophical aesthetics from Baumgarten to Kant. But whereas the philosophers discovered the connection between beauty and goodness in the operations of the mind, the classicists found it in the historical example of Greece, which, after midcentury, replaced Rome as the chief source of inspiration from antiquity. Neoclassicism had two ingredients of lasting signiµcance for the development of German museums: µrst, it provided a set of stylistic values that guided the early museums’ style and contents; second, it encouraged the conviction that solutions to aesthetic problems were to be found in the history of art. The key µgure in the creation of German neoclassicism was Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who, in Goethe’s famous tribute, resembled “a new Columbus” because he too rediscovered a land “that had once been known but then had been lost again.”20 The Greece that cast its spell over German culture was the land Winckelmann discovered or, more accurately, the one he created from his private longings and cultural experience. We will encounter Winckelmann often in the story of art museums; there is perhaps no more signiµcant µgure in their development or, for that matter, in the intellectual history of the German art world from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth.21 Born in 1717 in the Prussian village of Stendal, Winckelmann was one of a handful of eighteenth-century intellectuals who were able to overcome the obstacles of poverty through natural talent, hard work, and good fortune. On this long and di·cult journey, he stubbornly pursued his own, often eccentric interests, avoiding such natural refuges as theology in favor of literature and Greek, for which he developed an early passion. Winckelmann began as an autodidact, brie¶y attended the University of Halle (where he heard Baumgarten’s lectures on aesthetics), worked as a private tutor, and then, for µve miserable years, was a schoolmaster. Finally, he was lucky enough to get a job as the librarian for Count Bünau, a well-to-do amateur scholar who was writing a history of the Holy Roman emperors. This position gave him access not only to the count’s excellent library but, more important, to the vibrant art scene in nearby Dresden, where the Saxon electors had accumulated an extraordinary collection of art. In 1754, Winckelmann left the count’s service, moved to Dresden, and succeeded in acquiring the patronage necessary to µnance a study trip to Rome. He lived there from 1755 until 1768, when he was murdered by a thief in a hotel in Trieste. In Rome, to supplement his small pension from the Saxon court, Winckelmann had entered into the service µrst of Cardinal Archinto, the papal secretary of state, then of Cardinal Albani, one of the great Italian\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n11\n\nconnoisseurs of the eighteenth century. In 1763, Winckelmann was named prefect of antiquities and given a post in the Vatican library. He spent his days reading, visiting the Roman collections, guiding visitors around the city, and occasionally traveling south to see the ancient sites around Naples. He seems to have known everyone: visiting royalty such as the prince of Dessau, prominent foreigners such as John Wilkes, artists such as Anton Raphael Mengs (with whom he lived for a time), Angelika Kaufmann (who painted his portrait), and a host of others. Winckelmann became a famous µgure on the Roman scene; his writings were translated and discussed throughout Europe; his in¶uence remained powerful long after the speciµcs of his work had been corrected or rejected. Winckelmann was thirty-eight years old when he published his µrst book, Gedanken über die Nachahmung der Griechischen Wercke in der Malerey und Bildhauerkunst (Thoughts on the imitation of the Greeks in painting and sculpture), which appeared in an edition of µfty copies just before he left Dresden in 1755. In Rome, he wrote a series of essays on various antiquities, a book on ancient architecture, and a catalogue of Baron von Stosch’s art collection; in 1764, he produced his masterpiece, Die Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (The history of art in antiquity). Although he produced other books after 1764, including a two-volume work on ancient monuments, Die Geschichte continued to occupy his attention: he published notes and additions to it in 1767 and at the time of his death had almost completed a revised edition, which eventually appeared in 1776. Despite everything else he had to do—his obligations to his various patrons, formal duties as librarian and informal service as a tour guide for visiting dignitaries, an active social life, and extensive correspondence—Winckelmann accomplished an extraordinary amount in his thirteen years as a publishing scholar. In essence, his diverse and wide-ranging works were all parts of a single, unµnished project of seeking to understand the nature of art by connecting the particular and the general, objects and ideas, history and theory, and—most important of all—the ancient world and the present. The Greeks, Winckelmann was convinced, represented the timeless ideals according to which artistic beauty and cultural health must be judged. Only by striving to emulate these ideals in their own art could moderns µnd the inspiration and instruction necessary to save themselves. In the famous passage from the opening section of his µrst published work, he proclaimed that “the only way for us to become great, indeed, if it is possible, to become inimitable, is to imitate the ancients.”22 Although such proclamations of the classical ideal were not uncommon in the eighteenth century, Winckelmann presented an uncommonly rich and elaborate account of the Greeks’ achievements, which he µrmly rooted in an analysis of their historical condition. Winckelmann belonged to that great era of intellectual integration during which historiography was transformed from a disconnected series of stories about individuals and episodes into a uniµed account of processes—the transformation, in Reinhart Koselleck’s phrase, from “histories into history.”23\n\n12\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nUnlike the great Giorgio Vasari, whose Lives of the Artists had retained its exemplary status for two centuries after its publication in 1550, Winckelmann did not regard the history of art as the collective biography of famous artists. The protagonist of his history was art itself, as it had been deµned in the early eighteenth century: that is, art as a category of activities transcending the work of particular individuals and the di´erences among various media. But although art had its own history, its evolution was inseparable from the physical and spiritual world in which it developed. This was especially true of Greek art, which was based “in part on the in¶uence of the Greek sky, in part on the constitution and government, and on the modes of thought that they had shaped.”24 Everything in the Greeks’ world nourished their art: the warmth of their climate, the purity of their light, the grace of their bodies, the character of their institutions, and the quality of their religion and literature. To create his masterpieces, the Greek artist had only to look around him; his art shared and re¶ected the unsurpassed beauty of his life. The beauty of the Greeks’ art, Winckelmann believed, was inseparable from their virtues, especially their love of freedom: “Like a noble branch from a healthy trunk, the thought of the entire nation sprang from freedom.”25 Freedom enabled the Greeks to develop their genius and provided the basis for a society in which greatness was possible; it was the precondition and the substance of the Greek achievement. There is something deeply moving about these words of praise for freedom from a man so tethered by obligations: to practice a religion in which he did not believe, to conceal his homosexuality, to serve patrons less talented than himself, and to live dependent upon the o´erings of the rich and powerful. Perhaps these daily confrontations with dependence gave special power and poignancy to his image of a community of free men joined in the common pursuit of beauty.26 Winckelmann’s ideas about art were grounded not only in his general re¶ections about the past but also in his close observation of speciµc objects. “I came to Rome,” he wrote his friend Konrad Friedrich Uden in 1756, “only to look.”27 Winckelmann had the good fortune to be in Rome at a time when there was more art to be seen than ever before. New excavations, such as those at Herculaneum and Pompeii (begun in 1738 and 1748), were uncovering important works from the ancient world, and a number of private collections had only recently become accessible to visitors. The active art market, in which his patron Cardinal Albani was vigorously involved as both buyer and seller, brought an increasing number of objects out into the open, where they could be inspected and evaluated. The treasures of antiquity, as Goethe wrote, “passed before his eyes, strengthened his inclinations, stimulated his taste, and extended his knowledge.”28 Like the eighteenth-century physicians who emphasized the importance of observation for the diagnosis of disease, Winckelmann helped to establish the eye as the primary organ for the analysis of art. His commitment to the careful examination of artistic detail, which he attempted to record and analyze, was among his most important legacies. Winckelmann, Hegel once\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n13\n\nremarked, created “in the realm of art a new organ for the spirit, a wholly new way of looking.”29 But Winckelmann wanted to do more than observe. Just as eighteenth-century botanists sought to construct a taxonomy of the natural world by examining individual specimens, he believed that his study of individual pieces could illuminate the larger world of classical art and also the idea of beauty itself. Signiµcantly, he imagined the best foundation for such a project as an ideal museum containing all the works of Greek art; after each object had been examined “by the eye and understanding,” it would be possible to establish the nature of beauty once and for all.30 In order to be seen, Winckelmann insisted, objects not only had to be physically accessible; they also had to be properly displayed and preserved. He was critical of those contemporary collections, such as the elector’s antiquities that he had visited in Dresden at the end of 1754, where the pieces were crowded together and badly illuminated. Such precious objects should be arranged in an orderly manner, well lighted, and made visible from all angles so that the observer could examine each signiµcant detail.31 Furthermore, as Winckelmann wrote in 1767, the viewer should be able “to distinguish the old from the new, the authentic from the renovation.” He was not opposed to restoring statues—among his closest associates in Rome was Bartolomeo Cavaceppi, a leading craftsman in the µeld—but he did insist on being able to tell what was original and what had been added later. If it was to be done at all, restoration had to be done carefully, honestly, and with restraint.32 The Paradoxes of Historicism\n\nWinckelmann’s insistence on the autonomy and authenticity of the past broke with the long-established habits of using yesterday’s objects to meet today’s needs. For most of European history, people had never hesitated to add on to existing buildings, µll out a broken relief, put heads or limbs on statues, or touch up faded pictures with new colors in order to create more µnished and beautiful objects. Through this collaboration between ancient and contemporary artists, some of the past’s art was lost forever, but some of it became a part—in the case of architecture and sculpture, quite literally a part—of the art of the present. By insisting on the necessary distinction between the two, Winckelmann asserted not only the signiµcance of the past but also its pastness, its essential separation from the art of the present. This separation between past and present produced an underlying tension in Winckelmann’s thought, the tension between Winckelmann the historian, who sought to root the distinctive character of the Greek achievement in its circumstances, and Winckelmann the classicist, who proclaimed the immutable value of this achievement as an aesthetic ideal. The very success of his historical analysis of the Greeks, therefore, seemed to call into question their relevance for the modern age. This tension is, as Michael Podro has pointed out, a recurrent problem in the history of art: “the more µrmly you attached a work of art to the concerns and purposes of the society in which\n\n14\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nit was produced, the µrmer the separation from the purposes and concerns of those elsewhere.”33 Winckelmann himself was painfully aware of this tension. Indeed, the very concept of Nachahmung, imitation, reveals our distance from the Greeks; what we must self-consciously strive to acquire through research and analysis was simply, directly theirs: “Much that we would want to imagine as ideal,” he noted sadly, “was natural for them.”34 However hard we try to emulate them, he sometimes seemed to realize, the Greeks will always lie just beyond our reach. In the closing passage of Die Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums, he summarized the relationship of his contemporaries to Greece with this elegiac metaphor: “We are like a maiden on the shore, who follows her beloved with tear-µlled eyes as he departs forever and believes that she can still see his image in the ship’s distant sail. Like her, we are left with no more than the shadowy outline of our desires.”35 For many poets and painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the µgure of Iphigenia, who was forced to live in unhappy exile from her Greek homeland, came to symbolize the sense of loss that was always an element in classicism. For example, in Goethe’s Iphigenie auf Tauris, which he µnished in Rome in 1786, the heroine laments what she has lost: Alas, the sea separates me from those I love. I spend long days upon the shore, Seeking with my soul the land of Greece, But the waves only answer my sighs With their own dull roar.36\n\nLike many of those who visited Italy in the second half of the eighteenth century, Goethe was struck by the contrast between the glories of the past, as re¶ected in its monuments and treasures, and the endemic misery of its present condition. “Everything is in ruins,” he wrote from Rome, “and yet no one who has not seen these ruins can have any conception of greatness. So the museums and galleries are only golgothas, charnel houses, chambers of skulls and torsos— but what skulls.”37 Deep convictions about the past’s greatness, together with the knowledge of its vulnerability to time’s passage and men’s changing fortunes, produced the muted sense of loss that was never far from classical sensibilities. But equally important was the impetus to preserve what was left— to study and describe, uncover and protect all that remained of ancient glory. This recognition that the treasures of the past had to be preserved and protected would remain an essential part of the museum’s history.\n\nII. Court and Public\n\nThe emergence of aesthetics as a discipline was inseparable from changes in the institutional art world; like the new science of economics, aesthetics at once re¶ected and shaped patterns of behavior. As we should expect from\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n15\n\nour discussion of aesthetic theory, the most important innovation had to do with how art was experienced rather than how it was made, with perception rather than creation. Throughout the eighteenth century, as the µrst important theoretical statements on aesthetics were being published by Baumgarten, Sulzer, and Kant, institutional settings were created within which art could be perceived in new ways: theaters and concert halls, galleries and museums, scholarly associations and literary societies, and, most important of all, an expanding network of published materials. Since Jürgen Habermas’s in¶uential work, this collection of institutions has been thought of as “the public sphere,” the realm of Ö´entlichkeit, within which ideas and images, instruction and entertainment, could be transmitted to a new kind of audience—to a “public.”38 Like the concept of the “µne arts,” public brings together a number of di´erent activities. In his widely used dictionary, for example, Johann Christo´ Adelung distinguished between the audience attending a play and the dispersed world of readers, but he regarded them both as examples of what he termed “a critical public.”39 What did sitting in a theater with a crowd of people and reading a book by oneself have in common? How could they both be expressions of the “public”? In the µrst place, unlike court entertainments or village festivals, theaters and books were, at least in theory, accessible to everyone. This openness made them “public.” But reading and theatergoing also o´ered the same kind of experience of art in that the members of an audience, like individual readers, experienced art privately— in isolation from one another. However much these experiences might become an occasion for sociability and communication, they were originally internalized and isolated in a way that the traditional oral cultures of court or community usually were not. Recall that the priority of private perception was the message of Chodowiecki’s portrayal of the “natural experience of art,” which extolled the same kind of quiet, individual attentiveness that was required in both theater audiences and readers.40 The public sphere, therefore, institutionalized both accessibility and subjectivity, essential characteristics of aesthetic experience in the art world within which museums developed. Courtly Publics\n\nSince the eighteenth century, the idea of a public has had powerful ideological resonance. Kant, for instance, emphasized its progressive, enlightened character; he regarded Ö´entlichkeit as an instrument of critical reason that eventually would triumph over the forces of superstition and unreason. Others compared the openness and universality of the public sphere to the closed, status-driven world of the court aristocracy. To a remarkable degree, historians have appropriated this normative image of the eighteenth-century public, which they conventionally link to the progressive social forces that supposedly promoted the triumph of the middle classes [Verbürgerlichung] in German culture. “The ‘great’ public that formed in the theaters, museums, and concerts,” Habermas argued, “was bourgeois in its social origins.”41\n\n16\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nThe close association of public and Bürgerlichkeit seems to me to force the complexities of eighteenth-century culture and society into an oversimpliµed, excessively dualistic model. There was, in fact, nothing necessarily bürgerlich or progressive about the public sphere, in which many members of traditional elites actively participated and where quite unprogressive ideas and values were vigorously propagated. Moreover, the divisions between the new public and the traditional court were always porous; individuals frequently lived in both realms or moved easily from one to the other. In this regard it is worth noting that Chodowiecki’s pictures of the “natural” and “a´ected” ways of experiencing art portray the same two µgures, whose dress and swords identify them with the nobility. The di´erence between the two poses is in the men’s sensibilities, not their social position. Nor is it surprising that Chodowiecki’s own work, which is justly famous for its portrayal of enlightened values and bourgeois life, was avidly collected by princes such as Franz Friedrich Anton, the duke of Saxe-Coburg.42 To understand the German art world at the end of the old regime, therefore, we must examine the coexistence and interaction of new and traditional forms of culture. Everywhere we look in eighteenth-century culture, we µnd a blend of court and public. Consider, for instance, Winckelmann’s career. Without patronage—µrst from Count Bünau and then from the Saxon court—he would not have been able to produce the works that made him famous. Even in Rome, Winckelmann, like almost all the other German artists and intellectuals living there, depended on pensions from some patron or other. His increasing fame as a writer did not enable him to support himself, but it did help him to improve his position in the courtly world. Cardinal Albani employed him not simply because he enjoyed his company but because his reputation was growing in the public sphere. As Winckelmann himself realized, Albani wanted him “not for the service I could perform, but in order to be able to say that I am his.”43 To the cardinal’s household, and to his collection of ancient art, Winckelmann brought his expertise as a scholar and his prestige as a well-known writer. All of this was especially useful to someone like Albani, who was eager to legitimate both his purchases and his sales. Winckelmann’s ideas about the relationship between art and freedom belonged to the realm of enlightened opinion; his life remained enmeshed in the traditional world of patronage and dependence. A more prominent example of the interaction of court and public interacted is the career of Winckelmann’s great admirer, J. W. Goethe. The stunning speed with which Goethe’s fame spread after the publication of The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774 indicated the German reading public’s newly acquired vigor and receptivity. Virtually overnight, the young author became a celebrity in whose re¶ected glory everyone wanted to bask— including young Duke Carl August of Weimar, who sought him out during a brief stop in Frankfurt at the end of 1774. There is no doubt that Goethe’s reputation made him a valuable ornament to the duke’s court. But why did Goethe allow himself to become µrst the duke’s favorite, then a hardworking\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n17\n\nmember of his government? Unlike Winckelmann, Goethe was not without resources and alternatives; he did not need a patron in order to survive. Certainly, he enjoyed his sometimes strenuous friendship with the duke as well as the pleasures of courtly life. But most of all, he was attracted by the court’s blend of political power and cultural authority, which he recognized as sources of personal in¶uence and artistic inspiration. Of course, Goethe was also aware of the tensions between the imperatives of art and the demands of courtly life, which he explored so powerfully in Torquato Tasso and from which he ¶ed to Italy in 1786. Nevertheless, two years later he returned to Weimar and thereafter devoted his life and his art to both court and public. The great achievement of Goethe’s later career, Nicholas Boyle has written, was “to create an art which aspired to the intimate relation with the reading public characteristic of his Frankfurt years, but which drew equally on the forms and values of court and o·cials.”44 Perhaps the most successful institutional synthesis of princely authority and public culture was achieved in the state of Dessau-Anhalt during the reign of Prince Leopold III Friedrich Franz, who was born in 1740 and ruled from 1758 to 1817. An astute student of enlightened thought, a fervent Anglophile, and an admirer of Rousseau, the prince had spent six months being shown around Rome by Winckelmann in 1766. Together with his friend and architect Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdor´, Franz turned Dessau into a model of progressive government and cultural vitality. He built schools, formed learned societies, collected scientiµc specimens and classical antiquities, and entertained the leading intellectuals of his day. At his country seat in Wörlitz, Franz constructed a home in the English Palladian manner, whose simple, classical lines re¶ected his enlightened conception of princely rule; set in an English garden, µlled with shrines to enlightened ideas and places for quiet contemplation, Wörlitz, like many of his other properties, was accessible to everyone. As Rudolf Braun and David Gugerli remark, Dessau-Wörlitz “makes apparent how di·cult it is to µx sociologically what bürgerlich means.”45 Although rarely with the creative harmony possible in so small a state as Dessau, everywhere in German Europe the growth of the public sphere led princes to redeµne their cultural role. In 1742, for instance, Frederick the Great built an opera house in Berlin which had both courtly and public features. Originally, admission was free but required an invitation. In 1789, Frederick William II had the building redesigned; its boxes were converted into a gallery, and tickets could be purchased by anyone who could a´ord them. In the course of the century, more and more princes patronized opera companies, theater groups, and orchestras that performed for the public.46 At the same time, they opened the grounds of their palaces or even, as in Munich in 1789, constructed new gardens for their subjects’ enjoyment. Libraries and collections, once closed within the court, became more easily available to artists, scholars, and casual visitors. Like the military uniforms the princes began to wear and the state papers over which they labored, their role as patrons of public culture was part of a\n\n18\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nstructural transformation in the way dynastic authority was exercised and imagined. But this new involvement in the public sphere was also a natural extension of the prince’s traditional role as a patron of the arts, as well as of the court’s traditional function as a means of communicating values to its own members and to the world at large.47 To be sure, the prince’s position had changed: he no longer was, as in the world of the baroque court, the symbolic center and ultimate expression of all authority. Nevertheless, as the source of patronage and personiµcation of taste and values, he retained a signiµcant position at the cultural intersection of court and public. Both as the object of princely patronage and as an essential ingredient in courtly modes of communication, the visual arts had always occupied a special place in early modern courts. Most employed a variety of artists to prepare settings for courtly rituals, celebrate the prince’s achievements, and create monuments to dynastic glory. Such courtly art remained important throughout the old regime; indeed, some of its greatest achievements, such as Giambattista Tiepolo’s frescoes in the episcopal palace at Würzburg and François Cuvilliés’s hunting lodge at Nymphenburg, are from the middle decades of the eighteenth century. In many places, traditional patronage remained much the same throughout the century. At the court of Zweibrücken, for instance, where Johann Christian Mannlich was court painter, artists worked exclusively for princely patrons, upon whose continued favor their livelihoods depended. When their patron died or his taste or fortunes changed, they could easily µnd themselves without a source of support.48 Even the most successful eighteenth-century artists found it di·cult to live without some kind of patronage; nowhere in Germany was the art market robust enough to guarantee a reliable income. Anton Gra´, for example, who was perhaps the most renowned German portrait painter of his day, was Saxon Hofmaler at the same time that he did a thriving business painting the portraits of clients from throughout central Europe. Like Winckelmann, Gra´ used his growing public reputation to improve his patronage position; in 1788, the elector of Saxony agreed to raise his salary and appoint him to the Dresden Academy so that he would not accept an o´er to move to Prussia.49 The interaction of court and public in the careers of artists such as Gra´ was institutionalized in many of the royal academies of art that were formed throughout central Europe in the eighteenth century. On the one hand, academies o´ered their members the prestige and privileges of an o·cial position, under the patronage of the court. On the other hand, academies helped artists to sell their work through regular exhibitions that served the growing German art market.50 Here too, court and public coexisted, each shaped by and dependent on the other. Princely Collections and the Public\n\nFor the development of the museum, the most signiµcant interaction between public and court was in the organization and display of princely collections. From these collections came not only many of the objects that would end up\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n19\n\nin nineteenth-century museums but also many of the ideas about how these objects should be arranged and exhibited. The development of art museums, therefore, helps to substantiate Martin Warnke’s argument that the origins of the modern art world are to be found in the princely courts.51 At least since the Renaissance, collecting things had been an important part of being a prince. At the end of the sixteenth century, for example, Francis Bacon listed among the necessary attainments of every learned gentleman a “goodly, huge cabinet” µlled with natural and manmade wonders. The possession of rare and valuable things was a source of pride and prestige, and also a means of exhibiting the discriminating taste and easy learning regarded as so becoming in the rich and powerful. Collections provided the settings for the ceremonial display that was at the center of courtly life, as well as places of contemplation and repose into which the prince might retire. Some of the great early-modern collections of natural and artiµcial things were elaborately arranged to represent the world, and thus to provide a microcosm over which the prince could claim authority. In 1565, Samuel Quiccheberg called the Kunstkammer established in Munich by Duke Albrecht V a Theatrum Sapientiae, an appropriate appellation for a collection that included books, graphics, maps, works of art, weapons, religious relics, wax µgures, scientiµc instruments, miraculous pieces of corn that had fallen from the sky, a malformed calf’s head, and much more.52 Another famous collection was assembled in the 1560s and 1570s by Archduke Ferdinand II in his castle at Ambras. Four buildings on the castle grounds were devoted to collections: three to arms and armor (the archduke’s special interest), and one to an all-purpose Kunstkammer whose contents were organized according to their raw material. This system of classiµcation was carried out with such consistency that in the cupboard containing items made of bone, among the antlers and the ivory carvings, was to be found the arm of a Habsburg ancestor—an early expression of the museum’s ability to transform even the most sacred object into a thing like any other.53 A few early-modern collectors, such as the Habsburg Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1614–1662), specialized in µne paintings and sculpture, but most of them assembled a variety of objects deemed to have value: ancient coins, unusual feathers, beautiful seashells, stu´ed animals, old armor, and whatever else seemed rare, curious, or beautiful. In the collection as microcosm, pictures and statues sometimes occupied an important but not unique position as transitional objects, at once natural and manufactured, creations of God and man.54 But they were not regarded as “art” in the eighteenthcentury meaning of the term, nor were they singled out for special treatment. To the Bavarian elector, for example, who organized the contents of his collections according to the material from which they were made, it seemed quite reasonable to put his master of linens in charge of his picture gallery— paintings are, after all, made of cloth.55 Gradually, early-modern collections became less inclusive and more specialized—in large part because once some things were regarded as art,\n\n20\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nthey seemed to have nothing in common with such curiosities as unusually large antlers and stu´ed alligators. Art’s primary value come to depend less on its rarity or the costliness of its materials than on its moral and intellectual e´ect—which is why painting and sculpture began to be more highly prized than intrinsically more valuable objects such as tapestries or jewelry. Because of its special status, art had to be treated with appropriate reverence, properly displayed and carefully studied. It also had to be accessible to all those who might be ediµed by its moral value or instructed by its historical message. By the mid-eighteenth century, e´orts to make art public were apparent throughout Europe. Like most aspects of public culture, the practice of opening collections began in France and England. In 1750, the Luxembourg gallery in Paris was open to the public for three hours, two days a week; by the time it was closed in 1779, plans were already under way for a larger and more generally accessible national museum in the Louvre. In 1753, the British House of Commons approved the creation of a museum that would give “free access . . . to all studious and curious persons.” When the British Museum opened six years later, an elaborate set of restrictions ensured that those whom one trustee called “ordinary people of all ranks and denominations” did not endanger the museum’s possessions or excessively annoy its sta´.56 In no German state were there programs as ambitious as those of Paris or London, but rulers almost everywhere began to make their art more publicly available. Access to art collections was especially important for artists, whose training frequently involved copying the works of old masters. Sulzer regarded what he called “the public use” of galleries for artistic education as their most important function; galleries, he argued, are for artists what libraries are for scholars.57 In most states, it became standard practice to allow students and connoisseurs free access to the ruler’s collections. For example, in 1786, the µrst year of his reign, Prussia’s King Frederick William II decreed that all his collections should be available to students; four years later, the new statutes of the Academy of Art recommended the appointment of a gallery inspector who could provide instruction as well as oversee the royal collection. By 1800, the curriculum of the Berlin Academy scheduled thirty-two hours a week for gallery work.58 In the course of the eighteenth century, almost every important German art collection was opened to the public. To inform people about what was worth seeing, J. G. Meusel included a list of all the major German collections in his Teutsches Künstlerlexikon, which was µrst published in 1778 and then appeared in an enlarged edition between 1808 and 1814.59 Sometimes it was necessary to acquire tickets ahead of time or apply to the gallery director for permission to enter. Guided tours of the Braunschweig Kunst- und Naturalienkabinett were available several times a week; advanced booking guaranteed a ticket. Other collections were simply open at set hours on certain days of the week: Munich’s Hofgarten gallery, for example, could be visited from nine to twelve and one to four every weekday. “Who is not pleased,”\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n21\n\nJoseph von Rittershausen wrote about his visit there in 1788, “that the gallery is now open to everyone?”60 When Rittershausen spoke of “everyone” (alle Menschen), he did not, of course, have in mind every inhabitant of Munich who might show up at the gallery door. Access to a gallery, like participation in public culture as a whole, was limited by an elaborate set of rules and preconditions: one had to have the money to buy theater tickets, the ability to read in order to have access to books, and the right appearance to be welcome in literary societies. Restrictions on visiting galleries were both formal and informal, stipulated in the regulations or left to the discretion of whoever was in charge. In 1792, access to the imperial gallery in Vienna was limited to those with clean shoes—not a trivial matter in a city with lots of horses but no sidewalks. In his guidebook to Berlin, published in 1769, Friedrich Nicolai gave the address where permission to visit the royal collections could be obtained. “Everyone is allowed,” he added, “to view these rarities, and it is to be understood that what is customary and conventional [üblich und gebrauchlich] in other places will also be enforced here.”61 This remark reminds us not only that collections were restricted to those who knew the rules, but also that, by the end the 1760s, visiting collections had become common enough practice among Germans that Nicolai could simply allude to these rules without having to spell them out. He could assume that “everyone” would understand what was “customary and conventional”—that is to say, everyone who was likely to be reading his book. In practice, therefore, the number of people who actually visited a gallery tended to be small: in the 1750s, for example, only about thirty visitors a month entered the electoral gallery in Dresden.62 As art was transformed from an ornament of the courtly world into a source of public ediµcation, the role of the prince changed but did not disappear. The great collections still belonged to him, just as the best artists still had some connection to the court. Moreover, the prince’s collections continued to be a way of communicating his glory, although now it was communicated to the public at large, not just the closed society of the court. Among the µrst things confronting a visitor to the new gallery that opened in Vienna in 1728 was a painting by Francesco Solimena which showed the director of the imperial palaces presenting to Emperor Charles VI an inventory of the works assembled and preserved, while the goddess Fame proclaimed the excellence of the emperor’s taste to an appreciative world. A similar message appeared in the print that opened the 1778 catalogue for the electoral gallery in Düsseldorf: in a common form of secular apotheosis, a winged female carries a medallion of the Elector Karl Theodor toward glory; classical µgures grouped around the easel recall his contributions to the arts; and the elector’s palace, shown just above the captured weapons and standards of his enemies, stands as an enduring monument to his earthly triumphs. But although both pictures celebrate the prince as patron, an important di´erence between them re¶ects the changing role of the prince in the century’s middle decades: in Solimena’s tribute to Charles, the emperor\n\n22\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\ndominates the scene, and his generous act is the focus of attention; in the Düsseldorf print, the elector is not only less visually prominent but not actually present except as a work of art.63 Within the public galleries, both the nature of art and its relationship to the prince were transformed. The objects on display—paintings, sculpture, perhaps some artifacts from the ancient world—were no longer the luxurious ornaments of courtly life; they had been changed into art, with all the moral power conveyed to it by the new aesthetics. Although still belonging to the prince, they were thus e´ectively sheltered from the ideological attacks on luxury that had become increasingly widespread as the century progressed. As art, the primary purpose of these objects was not to proclaim the prince’s glory; instead, prince and public joined to celebrate their beauty and power. A good expression of this new relationship of prince, public, and art appears in Schiller’s “Brief eines Reisenden Dänen,” µrst published in 1785, which describes a visit to the collection of antiquities in Mannheim: Today [writes the µctional Dane] I had an inexpressibly pleasant surprise, which has enlarged my whole heart. I feel nobler and better. I have come from the Hall of Antiquities. . . . Every native and foreigner has the unlimited freedom to enjoy these treasures from antiquity because the clever and patriotic elector has brought them from Italy, not to add to his glory by possessing one more rarity nor, like many other princes, to provide the casual traveler with something to admire. He made this sacriµce for art itself, and a grateful art will forever praise his name.64\n\nThe prince was to be honored, therefore, not because he owned these things but rather because he was willing to share them with the public. By making art accessible to all, the prince associated himself with its moral power. Intermediaries\n\nA prince’s art collection was usually supervised by a court artist, who might have the additional title of Galerieinspektor or—like Court Painter Nicolas Guibal in Stuttgart in 1760—gallery director. These artists advised the prince on what to buy, were in charge of maintaining and restoring his pictures, and helped to prepare inventories and catalogues. At some courts, the Galerieinspektor was an important µgure; Mannlich, for one, had close access to the prince and considerable in¶uence over how his collections were organized and displayed. Elsewhere, he was little better than a custodian, happy to earn pocket money by selling tickets to the collections or showing visitors around.65 As their art collections became more public, some princes hired experts to help them acquire, organize, display, and publicize their art. These experts were the vanguard of what would become an increasingly important sector of the modern art world, the talented and ambitious individuals who act as\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n23\n\nadvisers and intermediaries for wealthy and powerful collectors. Just as the objects on display in todays’s art museums often originated in princely collections, so modern museum administrators can trace their ancestry back to eighteenth-century intermediaries such as Christian Ludwig von Hagedorn and Christian Mechel. The son of a Danish o·cial who had died young and poor, Hagedorn (1712–1780) studied law and then joined the Saxon diplomatic corps, in which, as a representative to various states, he specialized in matters of court etiquette, ritual, and precedence.66 He was deeply interested in art, a frequent visitor to various princely collections, and the friend of many artists. From his artistic connections and through careful purchases on the auction market, he began to build a private collection, to which he devoted much of his free time and limited resources; in the end, he is reported to have owned 225 oil paintings. After his retirement from government service in 1754, Hagedorn became a full-time connoisseur; he contributed articles about art to periodicals, published books, and made prints. In his major work, Betrachtungen über die Mahlerey (Observations on painting), which appeared in 1762, he combined his µrsthand grasp of artistic techniques with an impressive knowledge of aesthetic theory. Like Winckelmann, whom he knew in Dresden and whose works he had read and admired, Hagedorn used his literary accomplishments to enhance his value to the court. In 1763, the elector made him his adviser on artistic a´airs and then general director of the arts in Saxony, with responsibility for all the dynastic collections and galleries and for the Academy of Art as well. Armed with this authority, Hagedorn set out to strengthen the ties between art and society. He tried to make the academy serve the common good by cultivating taste and improving craftsmanship, as well as by training painters and sculptors. At the same time, he sought to improve the pedagogical mission of galleries by making them into schools of art history as well as sources of good taste and public virtue. Christian Mechel (1737–1817) entered the eighteenth-century art world from a di´erent direction.67 The son of a prosperous Basel craftsman, he began as an apprentice to a printmaker in Augsburg. In 1757 he went to Paris, where he became associated with the most successful German engraver of the time, Johann Georg Wille, in whose workshop several generations of young German artists learned their craft.68 After acquiring a little capital, Mechel returned to Basel and set himself up as an art dealer. In 1766, he spent an important few months in Rome, where, like so many other visitors, he met Winckelmann and was impressed both by his ideas and by his place in the Roman art world. From Winckelmann he learned new ways of looking at and talking about art, which he used to expand his business as printmaker and agent. For the next several years, Mechel was one of the most successful art dealers in Europe, with ties to the small German courts and his own thriving “academy” that turned out prints, small folios, and a few large works, among them the Düsseldorf gallery catalogue.\n\n24\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nMechel’s big opportunity came in 1777, when the Emperor Joseph II stopped by his workshop to look at his prints. The next year, Joseph called him to Vienna to supervise the installation of the imperial collection in the Belvedere. Mechel returned from Vienna with gifts, honors, and special privileges. For the next few years, his business ¶ourished; he traveled throughout Europe, moved in the highest circles, and sold his prints at a healthy proµt. For Mechel, as for so many other purveyors to courtly life, the French Revolution was a disaster. He went bankrupt in 1805 and spent the last decade of his life as a pensioner of the Prussian king, desperately and unsuccessfully trying to recoup his fortune.69 Both Hagedorn, the diplomat and expert on courtly ritual, and Mechel, the artisan and merchant, moved across the eighteenth-century art world, buying and selling in the expanding art market, participating in the public discussion of art’s history and purpose, and establishing those ties with the courts necessary to in¶uence the way art was displayed. Like their more famous contemporaries—Winckelmann, Goethe, Gra´—they were able to succeed because of their ability to use the opportunities provided by both court and public. Collections and the Literary Public\n\nAmong the most important tasks assigned to intermediaries such as Hagedorn and Mechel was publicizing the prince’s collections. Since the Renaissance, collectors had assembled inventories and printed descriptions of their holdings, but these were usually records of ownership rather than modes of public communication. The earliest known attempt to bring a German collection “in black and white to the light of day” was made at the beginning of the eighteenth century by the Viennese gallery inspector, Christoph Lauch, who hired the painter and printmaker Jakob Männl to produce an illustrated catalogue of the emperor’s paintings; both men died before the project was µnished. The µrst catalogue exclusively devoted to a German gallery was produced in Düsseldorf in 1719. Thereafter, as galleries became more accessible and visiting them more popular, the public’s demand for useful descriptions grew, as did the desire of princes to have their collections publicly recognized. In 1778, for example, Mechel collaborated with Nicolas de Pigage to produce a complete catalogue of the Düsseldorf gallery, showing its contents wall by wall. Since this catalogue was too large and expensive to serve as a guidebook, a more compact edition was produced µve years later. Mechel also supervised the production of a guide to the Vienna collection, published in both a French and a German edition, which not only identiµed and located individual works of art but also indicated which ones were especially worthy of attention.70 Catalogues were intended to encourage visitors by displaying what each collection had to o´er. “It is impossible to page through these descriptions and illustrations,” J. H. Merck wrote about the Düsseldorf catalogue, “with-\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n25\n\nout feeling the strongest urge to travel to Düsseldorf and view these treasures for one’s self.”71 At the same time, they were designed to encourage the kind of aesthetic experience that was becoming associated with the µne arts, an experience involving recognition of the moral function of beauty and the necessity of a discriminating taste. In the preface to the catalogue of the Dresden collections, for instance, readers were told that this was a book not for the “simple traveler, who strolls through the galleries,” but rather for the “true connoisseur who studies them, and who, after having experienced their beauty . . . re¶ects on why he prefers one work to another.”72 In addition to these catalogues, a growing number of periodicals helped to spread information about collections to the German public. At µrst, they tended to discuss art in connection with other kinds of collections—precious gems, rare or odd natural specimens, and other curiosities—but after 1750, as the modern system of the arts took hold, periodicals began to treat art as a separate category. At the same time, more specialized journals focused on painting and antiquities. In 1779, J. G. Meusel began to publish the Miscellaneen artistischen Inhalts, which was reprinted under various titles until 1808. As its original title suggests, the Miscellaneen was a mélange of scholarly articles, biographical sketches of artists, prices and market information, and other items of interest gathered by a team of µfty collaborators throughout central Europe.73 Equally important as a source of public information about visual images were reproductions of famous artworks, which were turned out in large quantities by the thriving German printmaking trade. Sulzer viewed the growing availability of these reproductions as “a great advantage of the new age over the old,” because it brought the work of “the great artists, whose originals are locked up in the palaces of the great, into the homes of ordinary citizens.”74 The visual arts also found their way into people’s homes in literary accounts of gallery visits, which became a recognized genre that blended personal experience, theoretical re¶ections on art and beauty, and descriptions of individual pictures and statues. An important early example was Wilhelm Heinse’s “Über einige Gemählde der Düsseldorf Galerie,” µrst published in Der Teutsche Merkur in 1776–1777. Heinse (1746–1803), like so many of his contemporaries, served both public and court: a man of letters, journalist, and translator, he held a sinecure at the elector’s court in Mainz until he was driven out by the French Revolution. His gallery description used an epistolary form which allowed him to take a personal, informal tone in his responses to what he had seen. Like Winckelmann, Heinse wanted to make public his subjective responses to individual works and thereby to extend and embellish the experience of art available to those who visited galleries themselves.75 Gallery descriptions like Heinse’s, together with catalogues, art periodicals, and the reproductions of famous works, helped to develop an audience for the visual arts within the small but signiµcant literary public that had begun to remake German culture in the eighteenth century. From these publications about art, individuals acquired a surrogate experience of the gallery in the privacy of their homes—just as visiting a gallery demanded an\n\n26\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nindividualized private response in a public place. Seen together, therefore, art publications and art galleries blended the public and private elements that were at the core of the new art world.76 The best-known description of an eighteenth-century gallery is Goethe’s account of his visit to Dresden in 1768, which appears in book 8 of Dichtung und Wahrheit and touches on many of the themes in this chapter: The hour when the gallery was to be opened appeared, after having been expected with impatience. I entered into this sanctuary, and my astonishment surpassed every conception which I had formed. This room, returning into itself, in which splendour and reµnement reigned together with the deepest tranquillity; the dazzling frames, all nearer to the time in which they had been gilded; the polished ¶oor, the spaces used by spectators rather than for work—imparted a unique feeling of solemnity which much resembled the sensation with which one enters a church, as the adornments of so many temples, the objects of so much adoration, seemed to be displayed here only for art’s sacred ends.77\n\nGoethe’s account is obviously written from the spectator’s point of view; the gallery does not exist for us until he enters it. Everything appears to us through his eyes; indeed we have a more vivid sense of his response to the gallery than of the space itself. He comes into the gallery not from the palace, as a courtier or conµdant of the prince, but from the outside, as a member of the public, who knows what he will see from published descriptions. Nevertheless, he immediately makes his readers aware of the princely origin of the collection, seen in the splendor of the space containing the paintings, even in the very frames that surround them. But to this courtly elegance is added Goethe’s sense that art has a sacred character; royal magniµcence is overlaid with spiritual meaning. The gallery may belong to a prince, but it is now a sanctuary set aside from ordinary life, a public temple dedicated to art; across its polished ¶oors move those who have come to see, to worship with their eyes. Architecturally, the gallery has lost its function within the palace: as Goethe puts it, the room turns back into itself—a reference not only to the particular structure of the Dresden gallery but also to the fact that its purpose is self-contained. Courtier and public µgure, energetic connoisseur and creative artist, Goethe is an appropriate µgure with which to conclude our discussion of the German art world at the end of the old regime. With his appreciation of the Dresden gallery in mind, let us now examine more closely the spaces within which eighteenth-century princes made their art available to the public.\n\nIII. Princely Spaces\n\nSpiro Kostof has deµned architecture as “the material theater of human activity,” adding that “its truth is in its use.”78 Kostof’s metaphor guides my discussion of museum architecture throughout this book, but it seems\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n27\n\nespecially appropriate to the spaces devoted to housing princely collections in the early modern court. Nowhere was the theatrical deployment of space more manifest than in the baroque court; its truth was in its use as a setting for the grand drama of princely authority. The layout of the palace’s grounds, the arrangement of its buildings, the decoration of its rooms were all designed to express the prince’s glory. Here were enacted the symbolic representations of royal power, pageants of arrival and departure, rituals of birth and marriage and death, theatrical displays of festivity and pleasure and abundance.79 Within this courtly world, the ruler’s collections had a well-established place. As evidence of his knowledge and taste, they were expressions of what Paula Findlen has called the “self-conscious connections between possession and power, display and self-display,” which had preoccupied Italian elites and, following their example, princes everywhere in Europe.80 Because these collections were meant to be displayed, they cannot be thought of as private in today’s sense of the word; access to them as to the rest of the court, however, depended on the ruler’s will. To be invited to share with the prince the pleasure of his possessions was a sign of special favor or part of some ceremony of recognition or honor.81 Collections, therefore, were the background to, and sometimes the occasion for, those rituals of carefully regulated contact with the prince around which the life of the court was organized. Cabinets and Galleries\n\nAs early as 1704, Leonhard Christoph Sturm published a sketch of an ideal museum, which he imagined as a simple three-story structure with separate spaces for di´erent kinds of objects; although most of the museum was devoted to natural history, Sturm did propose to set aside one room solely for art. In 1742, Count Algarotti, an Italian art expert with strong ties to the courts of both Saxony and Prussia, described an ideal museum for August III, which he imagined as a striking combination of spaces arranged around a large courtyard.82 In the second half of the eighteenth century, European architects and connoisseurs became increasingly interested in the problems of building museums. For its Prix de Rome, in 1753, for example, the Académie d’Architecture speciµed plans for a gallery connected to a palace; in 1754, for a “Salon des Arts”; in 1778, for a museum of art and natural history, with a print room and library. Five years later, in 1783, EtienneLouis Boullée sketched as his ideal museum a massive structure with a great central rotunda and imposing porticos on all four sides. Boullée’s plan was the basis for the museum depicted in Durand’s Précis des leçons of 1802–1809, which in turn inspired the µrst generation of German museum builders.83 During the µrst two-thirds of the eighteenth century, however, not many separate buildings were constructed to house collections; most of each prince’s possessions remained, physically and symbolically, within the court itself. There, collections could be found in many di´erent sorts of spaces, but two arrangements seem to have been especially prevalent: the cabinet\n\n28\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\n(Kammer) and the gallery. In various forms and combinations, these two kinds of space would continue to dominate museum architecture throughout the nineteenth century, thereby underscoring the museum’s origins in the princely collections of the early-modern court.84 We can get some idea of what a collector’s cabinet may have looked like from Lorenz Beger’s Thesaurus Brandenburgicus, a survey of the Hohenzollern collections, which he published between 1696 and 1701 while he was serving as “counselor and librarian” to the Brandenburg Elector (later King) Frederick. Encouraged by his sovereign’s cultural ambitions, Beger had expanded the royal collections, especially of antiquities but also of the usual mementos, curiosities, and natural objects. A print from the Thesaurus, (µg. 2) shows a richly appointed room where structure and decoration are fused in a characteristically baroque manner. The room is full of things, but it is well appointed and large enough to retain an air of calm and repose. Although it is not clear just how the antiquities were supposed to be arranged, the largest and most important pieces seem to have been placed on table surfaces, less complete or less valuable ones on the ¶oor. But the room is intended to store objects as much as to display them. The cupboards and drawers contain parts of the collection that can be removed when its owner wishes; they are there for him and his companions to touch or talk about—not for casual visitors to see.85 If the cabinet is regarded as a “theater of activity,” what is the drama to be enacted there? Beger’s picture gives two alternatives: the µgure sketching beside the window suggests the solitary study that the room’s restful atmosphere makes possible; the quiet conversation that two men are having about an object represents the learned discourse that collections were meant to inspire. The picture emphasizes the coexistence and compatibility of the two kinds of activity; in the cabinet’s tranquil spaces, isolated contemplation and civilized sociability are equally possible. Unlike the cabinet, which o´ered a setting for quiet study and edifying conversation, the gallery invited movement and sociability. Like that other characteristic baroque structure, the formal staircase, the gallery was originally intended to extend and connect spaces; it was meant for ceremonial arrivals and departures, processions and receptions. In its most elaborate form, such as the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, we must visualize the gallery µlled with people, color, and light. It was exactly the sort of setting through which might pass the “moving observer,” who represented the ideal viewer of baroque architecture.86 But galleries were also well suited to the display of certain kinds of objects, especially large paintings and statuary. One of the µrst and most in¶uential galleries to be used in this way was built by Bramante around 1510 to display Pope Innocent VIII’s collection of classical art; in the 1570s, the U·zi in Florence was renovated to create an art gallery; ten years later, Vespasiano Gonzaga had a 300-foot-long gallery constructed for his statuary at Sabbioneta. The Grand Gallery of the Louvre, which would play such a prominent role in the history of museums, was built in 1610.\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n2. Lorenz Beger, An Idealized View of an Antiquities Cabinet.\n\n29\n\nFIGURE\n\n30\n\nMUSEUMS IN THE GERMAN ART WORLD\n\nThe most important German gallery in the sixteenth century was the Antiquarium in Munich, built by Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria between 1569 and 1571 to house his large collection of classical statues and modern copies, then altered soon after his death in 1579. The Antiquarium (µg. 3) is a long, barrel-vaulted space, divided into a series of bays; on both sides, its walls were broken by niches and pedestals. A stunning combination of architecture, painting, and sculpture, the entire space was intended to proclaim the glory of the ruling dynasty: the busts of emperors displayed along the sides associated them with the imperial majesty of ancient Rome; the walls pictured their territories and recorded their virtues. Although it was built to display objects, the Antiquarium’s contents and structure were inseparable; they reinforced each other to create a uniµed work of art.87 After 1700, more and more German princes, alert as always to trends west of the Rhine and south of the Alps, constructed galleries to display their art, usually by converting parts of their palaces. In 1707, for example, King Frederick of Prussia’s new architect, Johann Friedrich Eosander von Göthe, installed a long, gallery-like space on the second ¶oor of the Berlin palace. In Vienna and Dresden, the royal stables were converted into galleries for the prince’s art collections. Eventually, the association between gallery and court became close enough for a well-informed Dresden collector to believe that the term should be used to refer only to the collection of a sovereign prince.88 An early example of a German art gallery was the extension to his palace at Salzdahlum built by Duke Anton Ulrich of Braunschweig in 1701. Visitors entered the complex of rooms through the so-called grand gallery, a long, splendid hall with two rows of ancient and modern statues; its ceiling was decorated with allegorical frescoes celebrating the arts; a mirrored wall at one end visually extended its space. At a right angle to the grand gallery was a slightly longer and much narrower gallery that had paintings on one wall, windows on the other. At the near end of this second gallery were two cabinets where smaller pictures were displayed. The far end opened into an eightsided cabinet where a few pictures were illuminated by windows in the upper walls. Architecturally and spiritually, this “sanctum sanctorum” was the culmination of the gallery, in which the visitor could contemplate the µnest, most inspiring works in the collection.89 The Düsseldorf gallery, opened in 1710, was built by the Palatine Elector Johann Wilhelm (1658–1716) to house the paintings from his own collection and from that of his second wife, the daughter of Grand Duke Cosmo III of Tuscany. The building was U-shaped, with three long rooms connected by two smaller cabinets; in the long rooms, paintings hung on one wall which were lit by windows opening to the court; next to the windows were movable screens to which small pictures were attached. In 1756, the gallery was reorganized by Lambert Krahe, a local painter who had worked for many years in Rome. Instead of using the paintings merely as an extension of the architecture, Krahe gave equal emphasis to the objects themselves. Abandoning\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS 31\n\nFIGURE\n\n3.

He also divided the gallery’s contents into schools: the visitor entered µrst the “Saal der vlämischen Meister,” which held Flemish paintings from the seventeenth century; next, a cabinet with smaller genre scenes; then the Italian Hall, with a few genuine treasures and a great many copies; then the second cabinet devoted to a local artist, Adriaen van der Wer´; and µnally, the great Rubens Hall, whose forty-six paintings were presented as the high point of the collection.90 As their collections expanded and became more specialized, princes everywhere in German Europe built new spaces to house them. Nowhere was this more necessary than in Saxony, whose rulers had been avid collectors of all sorts of things since the middle of the sixteenth century. August the Strong (1670–1733, elector from 1694, king of Poland from 1697) not only added to these collections but also began to reorganize them so that they might be better preserved and displayed. It was August who was responsible for the Zwinger complex, designed in 1711 by Matthias Pöppelmann to be a setting for court entertainments and to house some of the royal collections, including an assortment of exotic plants. August also shifted his print collection out of the palace’s all-purpose Kunstkammer into separate rooms, displayed his bronzes and jewelry in the so-called Grüne Gewölbe, and began to move the best of his enormous collection of paintings out of the palace proper and into a gallery constructed in the royal stables.91 August’s son, August III (1696–1763, elector from 1733), shared his father’s love of precious objects but had a more focused interest in the “µne arts.” It was during his reign that many of the treasures of the Dresden collection were acquired, including the Sistine Madonna, which he bought in 1754. August III also presided over the extensive remodeling of the art gallery in 1745–1747. The newly created exhibition space was divided into two parallel galleries, one lit by windows facing the courtyard, the other by windows looking out into the Neumarkt. Public access to the gallery was through a µne double staircase, added to the Neumarkt facade in 1729–1730. The Dresden gallery became one of the most famous art museums in Europe, often visited and much admired by connoisseurs and travelers—including, as we have seen, Winckelmann and Goethe.92 The princely galleries constructed in the µrst half of the eighteenth century had strong stylistic ties to their baroque models. They continued to be splendidly decorated, and, as in the Antiquarium, their contents were usually designed to blend with the structure in order to create a uniµed visual impression. Nevertheless, the gallery was no longer simply a setting for courtly life; it had its own spatial organization, which, as in Salzdahlum, led the visitor along an aesthetically deµned path that culminated in the collection’s µnest works. No longer a transitional space through which people moved from one part of the palace to another, galleries became self-contained struc-\n\nEIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS\n\n33\n\ntures with their own rhythms and purposes—as Goethe said of the Dresden gallery, “places used more for viewing than for work.” Galleries still retained their structural connections with the court and their symbolic dependence on the prince. At Salzdahlum, for example, the grand gallery was linked to the rest of the palace by a mirrored antechamber, and two galleries enclosed the duke’s garden, into which visitors exited at the end of their tour. No one who visited any of these collections could doubt that they belonged to the prince. But they also had a public face: the Düsseldorf gallery, which was adjacent to the elector’s palace, had a separate, outside entrance. Local nobles, civil servants, and artists apparently had unrestricted access; foreigners could obtain admission tickets from the Hofmarschall. In Dresden, the gallery was still joined to the palace complex by a slender passageway, but the main entrance was obviously the staircase into the Neumarkt, whose architectural prominence underscored the building’s role as what Carl Heinrich von Heinecken, the author of the µrst catalogue, called an école publique. Public and Private Spaces\n\nAround the middle of the century, the growing penetration of public culture into the life of the court began to a´ect not only the design of galleries but also the construction of theaters, opera houses, libraries, and similar buildings. In these projects, we can see the µrst signs of that slow, uneven process of architectural specialization through which the functional and symbolic centrality of the court would eventually give way to a fragmented series of public o·ces and institutions, eventually housed in separate quarters.93 The same forces that pulled some of the court’s activities into the public sphere encouraged princes to reserve some spaces for their own private use. Unlike Louis XIV, into whose royal apartments at Versailles courtiers would be invited to bask in the warmth of the king’s proximity, princes now wanted separate quarters where they could µnd relief from their duties and enjoy the comforts of a private life. In the course of the eighteenth century, therefore, princes built a variety of retreats—pleasure palaces [Lustschlosser], hunting lodges, garden houses—which were removed from both the ceremonial publicity of the traditional court and the universal accessibility of the new public areas. At Wörlitz, for example, where so much was open for the public’s delight and enlightenment, some spaces were set aside only for the prince and his familiars.94 A good example of how princes began to think about private space is Sanssouci, the palace designed by Frederick the Great and his court architect, Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdor´, and built near Potsdam between 1745 and 1748. Sanssouci was not, of course, without a certain representational quality; it was, after all, a king’s palace, carefully placed on formal terraces amid splendid surroundings. But the "
