        "text": "1997.04.20\n\nS/AM: notes on Vidler's \"Losing Face\"\n\n...reference to Rowe's notion of a \"faceless\" Staatsgalerie which Rowe writes about in the Rizzoli Stirling book (pp. 2-24).\n\n...someone else's criticism of the Staatsgalerie as not having a face (e.g. Portoghesi or Zevi), but I haven't yet found the reference, if it in fact exists.\n\nV. finds possible reference to the regret of facelessness going back to the notion of an \"'architectural humanism' [and] its direct analogies, in theory and physical presence, to the human body.\" \"...an echo of Wölfflin's conclusion that \"we judge every object by analogy with our own bodies.\" - Wölfflin, Renaissance & Baroque, p. 77, Scott, The Architecture of Humanism, p. 177. I don't know how much I will refer to this notion in the S/AM essay, but I will use it in Body, Imagination, Architecture. Actually, I should make a note that I am not here trying to comment or add to the body connection, but rather going to make the point that Stirling was making reference to architecture's analogousness to nature--more Laugier that the physiognomical analysis within the projects of Ledoux and Lequeu.\n\n\"Rowe insists on the face as an indication of the 'internal animation' of a building, at once 'both opaque and revealing'\"\n\nRowe himself expresses doubt--\"great diffidence\"(p.24)--and he also mentions the trees (p.23): \"...Stuttgart is a building with no face. And it is not a question that no face could be seen--because of a screen of trees.\"\n\nI just realized that while the screen of trees is the row of Columns, the \"slightly crumbly\" (Rowe) and casual disclosure (Rowe) of the Staatsgallerie is the \"narrative history of culture\" displayed as a \"narrative history of not exactly architecture, but at least some of Stirling's thoughts on architecture.\" This realization now gives me two new points along with R. Carter's suggestion that the actual sky replaces the traditional dome of a rotunda.\n\nV. speaks of Stirling completing \"a series begun with Schinkel and continued with Le Corbusier\" and I think this should be illustrated, including the Mondiale...\n\nV. goes on to \"recognize that Schinkel's museum had itself already begun to suppress what, traditionally at least, might be termed a face\". Here I have to add Boullèe's project for the remodeling of the Royal Library, Paris, 1785.\n\n...a careful deconstruction of Vidler's argument (p.91, paragraph 2) that Stirling \"stripped away not one but two faces, in order to reveal the drum of the central space not now internal but as exterior surface.\" V. here also makes note that \"[t]he true face of Schinkel's building, indeed, is set behind the colonnade, a wall paneled...\" \"The face, however veiled.\"\n\n...it is wrong to call the Stirling rotunda dead, but rather much more alive than the traditional interior dome. ...the outside and the inside having to be different, yet some of the best buildings in architectural history achieve their greatness by bringing the outside inside. The Pantheon is the foremost example and Kahn's Kimbell Art Museum will be the second example, and along with the skylight slit, there is also the \"unnecessary\" porches which are also a non-facade. The \"dome\" of Stuttgart is placed by the actual dome of the sky itself.\n\n...find exact reference in Laugier to the \"natural\" ancestry of architectural elements, particularly columns, but also of domes (if such references actually exists). ...the general text there pertains to the rustic hut... ...Stirling himself put the rustic hut (albeit in steel framing) at the very entrance behind the colonnade of trees."
