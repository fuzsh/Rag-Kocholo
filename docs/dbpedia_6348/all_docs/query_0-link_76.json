Such was not always the case; indeed, it could be argued that the practice of architecture has rarely been underpinned by a close correspondence with theory, and that designers have been drawn more to precedent, to seminal buildings and projects rather than to texts for a creative springboard to their fertile imaginations. This is merely an observation and not an argument against fledgling building designers adopting even the simplest of theoretical positions; nor does it deny the profound influence of a small number of seminal texts upon the development of twentieth-century architecture, for there has been a close correspondence between some of those texts and icons which emerged as the built outcome. But even the most basic theoretical stance must be supported in turn by a few fundamen- tal maxims which can point the inexperienced designer in the right direction towards prose- cuting an acceptable architectural solution. This book, then, attempts to offer that support by not only offering some accepted maxims or design orthodoxies, but also by suggesting how they can inform crucial decisions which face the architect engaged in the act of design- ing. The text is non-theoretical and therefore makes no attempt to add to the ample litera- ture surrounding architectural theory; rather it aims to provide students engaged in building design with a framework of accepted ways of looking at things which will supportand inform theirexperimentand exploration during theso- called 'design process'. The plethora of literature concerned with the 'design process' or 'design methodology' is a fairly recent phenomenon which gained momentum during the late 1 950s. In these early explorations design was promulgated as a straightforward linear process from ana- lysis via synthesis to evaluation as if conform- 2 Architecture: Design Notebook ing to some universal sequence of decision- making. Moreover, design theorists urged designers to delay as long as possible the crea- tive leap into 'form-making' until every aspect of the architectural problem was thought to be clearly understood. But every practising archi- tect knew that this restrictive linear model of the design process flew in the face of all shared experience; the reality of designing did not conform to a predetermined sequence at all but demanded that the designer should skip between various aspects of the problem in any order or at any time, should consider sev- eral aspects simultaneously or, indeed, should revisit some aspects in a cyclical process as the problem became more clearly defined. Furthermore, the experience of most architects was that a powerful visual image of their embryonic solution had already been formed early on in the design process, suggesting that fundamental aspects of 'form-making' such as how the building would look, or how its three- dimensional organisation would be config- ured in plan and section, represented in reality an early, if tentative, creative response to any architectural problem. The act of designing clearly embraces at its extremes logical analysis on the one hand and profound creative thought on the other, both of which contribute crucially to that central ground of 'form-making'. It is axiomatic that all good buildings depend upon sound and imaginative decisions on the part of the designer at these early stages and how such decision-making informs that creative 'leap' towards establishing an appropriate three- dimensional outcome. These initial forays into 'form-making' remain the most problematic for the novice and the experienced architect alike; what fol- lows are a few signposts towards easing a fledgling designer's passage through these potentially rough pastures. 2 THE CONTEXT FOR DESIGN It's a hoary old cliche that society gets the architecture it deserves, or, put more extre- mely, that decadent regimes will, ipso facto, produce reactionary architecture whilst only democracies will support the progressive. But to a large extent post-Versailles Europe bore this out; the Weimar Republic's fourteen-year lifespan coincided exactly with that of the Bauhaus, whose progressive aims it endorsed, and modern architecture flourished in the fledgling democracy of Czechoslovakia. But the rise of totalitarianism in inter-war Europe soon putan end to such worthy ambition and it was left to the free world (and most particularly the New World) to prosecute the new architec- ture until a peaceful Europe again prevailed. This is, of course, a gross over-simplification but serves to demonstrate that all architects work within an established socio-political framework which, to a greater or lesser extent, inevitably encourages or restricts their creative impulses, a condition which would not neces- sarily obtain with some other design disciplines like, for example, mechanical engineering (which, incidentally, thrived undertotalitarian- ism). This brings us to another well-worn stance adopted by progressive architects; that archi- tecture (unlike mechanical engineering) responds in some measure to a prevailing cul- tural climate in which it is created and therefore emerges inevitably as a cultural artefact reflecting the nature of that culture. Certainly the development of progressive architecture during its so-called 'heroic' period after the First World War would seem to support this claim; architects found themselves at the heart of new artistic movements throughout Europe like, for example, Purism in Paris, De Stijl in Rotterdam, Constructivism in Moscow or the Bauhaus in Weimar and Dessau. Inevitably, such movements generated a close correspondence between architecture and the visual arts so that architects looked naturally to painters and sculptors for inspira- tion in their quest for developing new architec- 4 Architecture: Design Notebook tural forms. Indeed, Le Corbusier applied the formal principles of 'regulating lines' as an ordering device both to his Purist paintings and as a means subsequently of ordering the elevations to his buildings (Figures 2.1 , 2.2). Equally, Piet Mondrian's abstract painterly compositions found themselves reinterpreted directly as three-dimensional artefacts in the architectural projects of Van Eesteren and Van Doesburg (Figures 2.3, 2.4), and Lubetkin's iconic Penguin Pool at London Zoo was informed by the formal explorations of Russian Constructivist sculptors like Naum Gabo (Figures 2.5, 2.6). But the architectural culture of the twentieth century was also characterised by a series of Figure 2.2 Le Corbusier, Regulating Lines: Villa at Garches, 1 927. Author's interpretation. theoretical models of such clarity and seduc- tiveness that designers have since sought to interpret them directly within their 'form- making' explorations. Such was the case with Le Corbusier's 'Five Points of the New Architecture' published in 1 926 where a tradi- ^otb Figure 2. J Le Corbusier, Regulating lines, Ozenfant Studio, Paris, 1 922.

Consequently 'pilotis', 'free facade', 'open plan', 'strip window', and 'roof garden' (the five points) were instantly established as tools for form-making. A cele- brated series of houses around Paris designed by Le Corbusier between 1 926 and 1 93 1 gave equally seductive physical expression to the 'five points' idea and in turn was to provide a collective iconic precedent (Figure 2.9). Similarly, Louis Kahn's theoretical construct of 'Servant and Served' spaces found an 6 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 2.7 The Five Points, Traditional House. Author's interpretation.

The adoption of modernism and its new architectural language was also facilitated by exemplars which were not necessarily under- pinned by such transparent theoretical posi- tions. The notion of 'precedent', therefore, has always provided further conceptual mod- els to serve the quest for appropriate architec- tural forms. Such exemplars often fly in the face of orthodoxy; when Peter and Alison Smithson completed Hunstanton School, Norfolk, in 1 954, they not only offered a startling 'court- yard-type' in place of the accepted Bauhaus 'finger plan' in school design (Figures 2.11, 2.12), but at the same time offered a new 'brutalist' architectural language as a robust The context for design 7 Figure 2.

And within this complex picture loomed a burgeoning technology which further fuelled the modernist's imagination. Architects were quick to embrace techniques from other disci- plines, most notably structural and mechanical engineering and applied physics to generate new building types. The development of framed and large-span structures freed archi- tects from the constraints of traditional build- ing techniques where limited spans and load- bearing masonry had imposed variations on an essentially cellular plan type. Now archi- tects could plan buildings where walls and partitions were divorced from any structural intrusion. 8 Architecture: Design Notebook Whilst this revolution was facilitated by an early nineteenth-century technology, later inventions like the elevator, the electric motor and the discharge tube were to have profound effects upon a whole range of building types and therefore upon their formal outcome. For example, the elevator allowed the practical realisation of high-rise building whose poten- tial had previously been thwarted by the limita- tions of the staircase (Figure 2.13). But the invention of the electric motor in the late nine- teenth century not only facilitated the develop- ment of a cheap and practical elevator but also fundamentally changed the multi-level nine- teenth-century factory type which had been so configured because of the need to harness jDDODO Figure 2.13 Adler and Sullivan, Wainwright Building, Chicago, 1891 . From Architecture Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Hitchcock, H. R., Penguin, p. 343. a single source of water or steam power. The inherent flexibility of locating electric motors anywhere within the industrial process allowed the development of the single-storey deep- plan factory. Moreover, the deep-plan model applied to any building type was facilitated not only by the development of mechanical venti- lation (another spin-off from the electric motor), but also by the development of the dis- charge tube and its application as the fluores- cent tube to artificial lighting. Freed from the constraints of natural ventilation and natural lighting, architects were free to explore the formal potential of deep-plan types. This is but a crude representation of the gen- eral milieu in which any designer operates, a context which became progressively enriched as the twentieth century unfolded. But what of the specific programme for building design which presents itself to the architect? And how do architects reconcile the generality of contextual pressures with the specific nature of, say, a client's needs, and how, in turn, are such specific requirements given formal expression? When James Stirling designed the History Faculty Library at the University of Cambridge (completed 1968), the plan form responded directly to the client's need to prevent a spate of book theft by undergraduates. Therefore an elevated control overlooks the demi-semi- circular reading room but also the radial bookstacks, offering not only potential sec- The context for design 9 urity for books but also a dramatic formal outcome (Figures 2.14, 2.15). In 1971 Norman Foster designed an office building for a computer manufacturer in Hemel Hempstead whose principal require- ment was for a temporary structure. Foster used a membrane held up by air pressure, a technique not normally applied to architec- ture, but which offered the potential for speedy dismantling and re-erection on another site. The translucent tent provided diffused day- lighting and lamp standards were designed to give support in the event of collapse (Figure 2.16). Whilst this contextual 'snap- shot' firmly articulates an orthodox modernist position, the so-called post-modern world has Figure 2.

Figure 2.16 Norman Foster, Computer Technology Ltd, Office, London, 1970, Section. 10 Architecture: Design Notebook offered a range of alternatives borrowed from literature and philosophy which in turn has offered architects a whole new vocabulary of form-making well removed from what many had come to regard as a doctrinaire modernist position. In this new pluralist world which revealed itself in the last quarter of the twenti- eth century, architects found themselves con- sumed by a 'freestyle' which on the one hand in revivalist mode quarried the whole gamut of architectural history (Figure 2.1 7), or on the other borrowed so-called 'de-construction' from the world of literature (Figure 2.18). Within this post-modern celebration of diver- sity, others sought a return to vernacular build- ing forms, often applied to the most inappropriate of building types (Figure 2.1 9). But as we enter the new millenium, deeper concerns of energy conservation and sustain- ability have to a large extent eclipsed the sty- Figure 2.18 Zaha Hadid, Kurfurstendamm, Project 1988.

Consequently, buildings which are thermally efficient, harness solar energy and rely on natural lighting and ventilation, reflect a return to the tectonic concerns of pioneering mod- ernists. Moreover, like their modernist fore- bears, such buildings offer a fresh potential for form-making, always the primary concern of any architect (Figure 2.20). Having briefly explored a shifting context for architectural design during the twentieth century, the whole complex process of estab- lishing an appropriate form will be examined. Although parts of the process are identified separately for reasons of clarity, each design programme generates its own priorities and therefore a different point of departure for the Figure 2.20 Emslie Morgan, St Georges School, Wallasey, 1961. From The Architecture of the Well- tempered Environment, Banharn R., Architectural Press. designer to get under way. Moreover, the designer will have to consider much of what follows simultaneously and, indeed, recon- sider partially worked-out solutions as the design progresses, so that solving even rela- tively simple architectural problems emerges as a complex process far removed from a simple linear model. This Page Intentionally Left Blank 3 ARRIVING AT THE DIAGRAM RESPONDING TO THE SITE Unless you are designing a demountable tem- porary structure capable of erection on any site, then the nature of the site is one of the few constants in any architectural programme. Other fundamentals like, for example, the brief, or the budget may well change as the design progresses, but generally the site remains as one of the few fixed elements to which the designer can make a direct response. Just as an architect may establish quite early in the design process an 'image' of his building's organisation and appear- ance, so must an image for the site be con- structed concurrently so that the two may interact. Analysis and survey An understanding of the site and its potential suggests an analytical process before the busi- ness of designing can get underway. There are obvious physical characteristics like contour and climate, for example, which may stimulate the designer's creative imagination but first it is imperative to comprehend the 'sense of place' which the site itself communicates. It is neces- sary therefore, to have some understanding of the locality, its history, its social structure and physical patterns or 'grain', so that the form and density of your proposed interventions are appropriate. This is best achieved by observation and sketching on site as is the less problematic recording of the site's physi- cal characteristics. How for instance will the site's topography suggest patterns of use? Is the utility of concentrating activity on the level areas of the site overridden by concerns for maintaining mature planting oravoiding over- shadowing, for example? Are gradients to be utilised in generating the sectional organisa- tion of the building? How will the building's physical form respond to and moderate the 14 Architecture: Design Notebook climate? Is it important to maintain existing views from the site or will the building construct its own inward-looking prospect? How is access to the site to be effected and how can the placing of buildings on the site reduce roads and site works to a minimum whilst at the same time allowing for easy circulation of people and vehicles? How do site access points respond to an existing infrastructure of vehicular and pedestrian routes? Where are existing services to the site located? Such a survey need not be exhaustive to prompt a designer's key site responses. These in turn will be reappraised and modified along with other decisions as the design progresses. During these initial explorations it is advisable to draw the site and outline building proposals to scale so that relative sizes of the site and major building elements may be absorbed early on in the design process. In this way it is possible even at this stage to test the validity of basic design decisions and whetherthere exists a fundamental harmony between the site and the proposed buildings which it is to accom- modate. This whole question of an architect's response to a specific site is best illustrated by example (Figure 3.1). Here is a generous south facing sloping site with mature planting within a lush western suburb of Sheffield. Dramatic distant views of the city are afforded to the south and a major road forms the site's northern boundary together with vehicularand Figure 3. 1 Fawcett, A. Peter, House for Anaesthetist, Sheffield! 987. pedestrian links to local facilities. The local authority insists that all mature trees on site are retained. The initial steep gradient from the road makes vehicular penetration of the site impracticable and, in the event, undesir- able, given its mature planting. The client's needs appear to be even more demanding; he wishes to retire to this house with his wife and requires to live, eat and sleep at road level, that is, on an elevated plane to the north boundary. Moreover, he wishes to store his three historic motor cars at the same level and adjacent to the road to minimise hard sur- facing on site. As much as possible of the mature planting on site must be retained (it is the former garden of an adjacent nineteenth- century villa). The initial diagrammatic solu- tion (Figures 3.2, 3.3) demonstrates not only how responses to the site and, for exam- ple, client's needs are interdependent, butalso the need to consider simultaneously various Arriving at the diagram 1 5 Figure 3.2 Fawcett, A. Peter, House for Anaesthetist, Sheffield 1987, Ground floor and basement plans. Figure 3.3 Fawcett, A. Peter, House for Anaesthetist, Sheffield 1 987, Section/site plan. components of the programme. Furthermore, it demonstrates how apparently severe pro- grammatic constraints may provide a real springboard for creativity and form-making; hence the linear, single-aspect plan; the ele- vated living floor for access and views with ser- vice areas below; the retention of the boundary retaining wall to the north to serve also as the building's boundary thereby minimising its 'footprint' on site to preserve all mature plant- ing; the minimal 'mews' vehicular access. Intervention This demonstrates how aspects of a specific programme can interact with a site to deter- mine an optimum formal outcome. But exem- plars have also conditioned architects' responses to the site during this century; these have taken on extreme positions from the archetypal Corbusian model where precise geometrical building form is set up in dramatic contrast to the landscape (Figure 3.4), and where 'pilotis' allow the building to hover in apparent detachment from the site, to an alter- native modernist orthodoxy where a building's 'organic' form is perceived as an outcrop of the site itself (Figure 3.5). These positions have variously been interpreted as the self-con- scious designed object contributing to the landscape (Figure 3.6), or, as in the case of Cullinan's visitors' centres for sensitive archaeological sites, for any intervention to 16 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 3.4 Le Corbusier, Villa and apartment block, Wessenhofsiedlung, Stuttgart, 1927.

P., Todtri, p. 61. be virtually consumed by the landscape so that physical intrusion is minimised (Figure 3.7). CHOOSING AN APPROPRIATE 'MODEL' Although it may be ill-formed and far from clear, architects generally arrive at a visual image for their building soon after the design process gets underway. Such an image often merely exists in the mind's eye long before the laborious process begins of articulating such imagery via drawings and models and then testing its validity; nevertheless, this initial creative leap into form-making, this point of Arriving at the diagram 1 7 mot Figure 3.7 Edward Cullinan, Archeolink Visitor Centre, Aberdeenshire, Scotland 1 997. From Architects' Journal, 6/12/97, p. 35. departure when the initial 'diagram' of the building begins tentatively to emerge is the most crucial and most difficult aspect of designing and, indeed, the most intimidating to a fledgling designer. Getting started Beaux Arts architects referred to the initial dia- gram of their building as the part/', literally, 'a point of departure'. The part/' encapsulated the essence of a building in one simple diagram and implied that the development of the build- ing design could proceed to completion with- out substantial erosion of the initial idea or part/'. Whilst such a process had then been both informed and judged by accepted Beaux Arts canons, nevertheless the process of pro- ducing an initial diagram for a building of real clarity and order still has equal validity today even if in a pluralist modern world those canons have multiplied and shifted. So which aspects of the 'programme' can we harness in producing this three-dimensional diagram from which the building design can evolve? What constitutes this crucial creative springboard? As has often been articulated, architecture at its most basic manifestation is mere shelter from the elements so that human activity can be undertaken in acceptable comfort. Should the designer assume this position, a greater concern for matters of fact rather than any theoretical stance, accepted canon, or precedent is implied. Indeed, the earliest, most primitive attempts at making shelter against the elements merely assembled avail- able materials to hand; this was an entirely pragmatic process of design by trial and error (Figure 3.8). Even today, some decisions embodied in the design process are entirely pragmatic in nature particularly when incor- porating new materials or methods of con- struction; early crude and tentative efforts tend to be refined and modified by trial and error using the same pragmatic processes as our forebears. But in searching for this initial form or part/' it is unlikely that purely pragmatic consider- ations will dominate. Designers are much more likely to be profoundly influenced by accepted ways of doing things or canons which are a useful source for ordering this notoriously problematic form-finding process. Classical architects worked, literally, within 1 8 Architecture: Design Notebook ..i Ufe Figure 3.8 Guyanan benab. the ordering device of the orders and simi- larly, the Beaux Arts parti relied on its own canonic devices which effectively ordered within an accepted framework the architect's initial forays into form-making (Figure 3.9). With the advent of modernism, Le Corbusier's 'Regulating Lines' and his later 'Modulor' were presented as canons based upon the same mathematical origins and with the same outcome in mind; they similarly offered a set of devices to order and clarify architec- tural form. Typology To a large extent the notion of typology (or study of 'types') has replaced the Beaux Arts fen* m fc'Spl tit Figure 3.9 SirE. Cooper, Port of London Authority Building, 1931. parti in more recent times as a crucial point of departure in our formal explorations. This is, of course, an over-simplification, for eight- eenth- and nineteenth-century architects were deeply concerned with the idea of building 'types' classified by use, which reflected an equally profound concern on the part of con- temporaneous scientists for classifying by 'type' the entire natural world. We have already seen how pragmatic designers in their quest to develop primitive forms of shelter developed buildings which in their forms and materials were closely asso- ciated with nature; materials at hand were assembled in such a way as to meet the demands of climate and user alike. This Arriving at the diagram 19 developed into a vernacular typology (Figure 3.1 0) in which architecture and nature estab- lished a close correspondence, a source of constant inspiration to both designers and theorists since the eighteenth century. But as a burgeoning nineteenth-century technology in turn created a new building technology, so a new tectonic typology (Figure 3.11) emerged concerned with new structural and constructional devices far removed from ver- nacular precedent. Finally, architects have found themselves profoundly influenced by the physical context in which they design, so that a contextual typology (Figure 3.12) has developed. Not surprisingly, all these typolo- gies have been developed to great levels of sophistication and represent, as a combined resource in the form of exemplary precedent, the fundamental springboard for effectively prosecuting building design.

From A Celebration of Art and Architecture, Amery, C, National Gallery, p. 106. 20 Architecture: Design Notebook Plan type So much for a broad perspective of typologies as another backdrop to creative activity, but how can we harness specific typologies to help us develop our building as a three-dimen- sional artefact? Le Corbusier famously declared, 'The plan is the generator'; putting aside for a moment that much meaning was lost in the English translation ('the three- dimensional organisation is the generator' would have been nearer the mark) it neverthe- less suggests that plan types can indeed pro- vide one of many departure points (others will be discussed later). Further putting aside whether your building will adhere to free or geometric forms, or both, it is still possible to distil a remarkably limited range of basic plan types which tend to be variations on linear, courtyard, linked pavilion, shed, or deep- plan organisations (Figures 3.13—3.17). There are, of course, massive variations on each type and most buildings combine aspects of more than one to satisfy the needs of a com- plex brief. Nevertheless, this initial stab at establishing a plan form which will provide an appropriate 'frame' to sustain specific social activities, is one crucial decision which allows the design to proceed. Building type Historically, of course, plan types like, for example, the 'basilica' or 'rotunda' were Figure 3.13 Barry Johns, Technology Centre, Edmonton, 1987.

But inevitably such orthodoxies are challenged from time to time and these challenges are generally recorded as important catalysts in architectural development. Thus the linked pavilion type of post-war school buildings in Britain was challenged by the Smithsons in 1949 at Hunstanton School where a courtyard type was adopted (Figure 3.20), but also by Greater London Council Architects' Department in 1972 at Pimlico 22 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 3.18 C.

School where a linear plan type not only responded to its London square context but also to the notion of an internal 'street' where informal social contact could take place (Figure 3.21). Similarly, pressures to conserve energy by utilising natural ventilation and lighting led Michael Hopkins to adopt a narrow plan for his Inland Revenue offices in Nottingham in 1 995 (Figure 3.22). This has been configured within a courtyard type effectively replacing the established deep-plan orthodoxy of the office type which the development of mechanical ventilation and permanent artificial lighting (both high energy consumers) had facilitated. Moreover, the courtyard has generated an acceptable urban form with a public domain of tree-lined boulevards and a private domain of enclosed courts (Figure 3.23). Conse- quently, Hopkins has capitalised on one severe constraint not only to challenge an accepted Arriving at the diagram 23 Figure 3.2 7 John Bancroft (GLC Architects' Department), Pimlico Secondary School, 1966.

ORGANISING THE PLAN As the building design develops from the initial diagram, it is essential on the one hand to maintain the clarity of that diagram and on theotherto keep testing its validity as the archi- tectural problem itself is clarified so that the parti is constantly revisited for reappraisal. This whole process of establishing in detail the building's three-dimensional organisation is best explored through the medium of draw- ing; a facility for drawing in turn facilitates 24 Architecture: Design Notebook designing in that ideas can be constantly (and quickly) explored and evaluated for inclusion in the design, or rejected. Many commentators have argued that the problematic process of form-making can be rooted in drawing, and more specifically, within established techniques. This has been suggested in the case of James Stirling's most celebrated works from the 1 960s, the Engineering Building, Leicester, 1964, and the History Faculty Library, Cambridge, 1 968, where, arguably, the formal outcome has to some extent been a product of an axo- nometric drawing method (Figures 3.24, 3.25). This may seem a far-fetched proposi- tion, for clearly these buildings are rooted in traditions which transcend any concerns for drawing technique; the nineteenth-century functional tradition and the modernist tradi- tion. Thus, we have two buildings which, in their formal outcome, express a fundamental canon of modernism; that a building's three-dimen- sional organisation (and functional planning) should be clearly expressed as overt display. Hence the separate functions of workshop, laboratory and lecture theatre are clearly and distinctly articulated at Leicester as are the functions of reading room and bookstack at Cambridge.

Arriving at the diagram 25 Circulation But apart from expressing an organisation of disparate functional parts, Stirling's three- dimensional modelsexpress ideasabout circu- lation within the building (Figures 3.26, 3.27). Indeed, concern for imparting some formal expression to horizontal and vertical circulation systems within buildings has con- stantly been an overriding concern to archi- tects of modernist persuasion. Hence the obsession with free-standing stair towers and lift shafts which connect by landing and bridge to the principal building elements, and the equally strong desire to express major horizon- tal circulation systems within the building envelope. Indeed, many architects think of circulation routes as 'armatures' upon which cells of accommodation are hung (Figure 3.28) so that expressing circulation patterns not only becomes central to establishing a functional working plan but also in turn gives authori- Figure 3.26 James Stirling, History Faculty, Cambridge, 1 968.

Moreover, attitudes towards circulation can modify and enrich basic plan types. For exam- ple, whether a linear building is configured as single or dual aspect will affect the plan and therefore the formal outcome (Figure 3.29). Similarly, a 'racetrack' circulation route within a courtyard building may be internal (Figure 3.30) or may be shifted laterally to relate directly to the internal court (Figure 3.31); clearly, such decisions concerning circulation within buildings not only affect the nature of principal internal spaces but in the case of a courtyard type, the nature of the courtyard itself. Should this model be developed further into the so-called 'atrium' plan then the 26 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 3.28 James Stirling, Leicester Engineering Building, Leicester University, 1964, Second floor plan.

Figure 3.31 'Race-track' courtyard plan, single aspect. Arriving at the diagram 27 atrium, or covered courtyard, will itself assume a circulation role (Figure 3.32). Unless the 'architectural promenade' is to be celebrated as a means of clarifying the buil- ding's organisation (this will be discussed later), there will be pressure on the designer to minimise circulation routes. Clearly, this pursuit presents some difficulties when faced with a linear building, but there are devices which an architect can use to minimise the apparent length of the inevitable corridors and galleries which result from such a type. Horizontal circulation Essentially, such devices will serve to punctuate these routes by variations in lighting, for exam- ple, which may well correspond to 'nodes' Figure 3.32 'Atrium' courtyard plan. along the route like lobbies for vertical circula- tion (Figure 3.33). Further punctuations of the route can be achieved by 'sub-spaces' off the major route which mark the access points to cellular accommodation within the building (Figure 3.34). Such 'sub-spaces' may also provide a useful transition between the route or concourse, and major spaces within the building. Circulation routes also have an important role in helping us to 'read' buildings. First, there is a hierarchy of routes in any building and this can be used to clarify the functional plan so that diagrammatically, patterns of cir- culation are tree-like with primary concourse (trunk) and secondary corridors (branches) (Figure 3.35). But it is also essential that these routes are punctuated by events which also help us to 'read' the building's three- dimensional organisation. Reiterated refer- ences to major events within the building also help the user to 'read' and comprehend the functional plan; these 'structuring points' may be nodes of vertical circulation or major public spaces like foyers, concourses, or audi- toria (Figure 3.36). Patterns of circulation also allow us to orientate ourselves within the plan by not only engaging with major internal events, but also with those outside; views out onto the site or into courtyards provide a con- stant reference to the user for purposes of orientation. 28 Architecture: Design Notebook qn Figure 3.33 Route 'node'.

Arriving at the diagram 29 Vertical circulation The location of vertical circulation also contri- butes substantially to this idea of 'reading' a building and clearly is crucial in evolving a functional plan. There is also a hierarchy of vertical circulation; service or escape stairs, for example, may be discreetly located within the plan so as not to challenge the primacy of a principal staircase (Figure 3.37). Moreover, a stair or ramp may have other functions besides that of mere vertical circula- tion; it may indicate the principal floor level or piano nobile where major functions are accommodated, or may be a vehicle for dramatic formal expression (Figure 3.38). And what form should the stair or ramp take? A dog-leg stair or ramp allows the user to re- engage with the same location on plan from floor to floor (Figure 3.39), whilst a running or straight flight configuration (including the escalator) implies vertical movement within some horizontal 'promenade' so that the user alights at different locations on plan (Figure 3.40) at each floor level. Should the stair or ramp be curved on plan, then a further dynamic element is introduced (Figure 3.41). Landings may not only punctuate flights, but if generous enough, may induce social contact as informal meeting places. Figure 3.37 Le Corbusier, Maison La Roche, 1 923. First floor plan.

This implies an understanding of buildings via a carefully orchestrated series of sequential events or experiences which are linked by a predetermined route. How the user approaches, enters and then engages with a building's three-dimensional organisation upon this 'architectural promenade' has been a central pursuit of architects throughout history. The external stair, podium, portico and ves- tibule were all devices which not only isolated a private interior world from the public realm outside but also offered a satisfactory spatial Arriving at the diagram 31 transition from outside to inside (Figure 3.42). Moreover, these devices were reiterated and reinterpreted during the twentieth century as a central modernist concern; the floating podium, often associated with water, assumes the role of a 'ceremonial bridge' (Figure 3.43), and the projecting canopy or deeply recessed entrance replaces the classical portico as not only 'marking' an entrance, but also by allowing some engagement with the building before entry (Figures 3.44, 3.45).

At the Villa Stein, Garches, 1 927, a carefully orchestrated route not only allows us to experience a com- plex series of spaces but also by aggregation gives us a series of clues about the building's organisation. The house is approached from the north and presents an austere elevation with strip windows like an abstract 'purist' painting. But the elevation is relieved by devices which initiate our engagement with the building. The massively-scaled projecting canopy 'marks' the major entrance and rele- gates the service entrance to a secondary role. At the same time the two entrances are differ- entiated by size thereby removing any hint of duality or ambiguity (Figure 3.46), and a pierced opening in the parapet suggests the existence of a roof terrace. On entry, an open- ing in the first floor provides a gallery which immediately asserts the importance of the first floor; the piano nobile has been established. A free-standing dog-leg stair allows us to re- engage directly with the void at first floor level, the serpentine edge of which invites a further exploration of the plan. Generous glaz- ing to the south elevation engages with the garden beyond, but the pre-determined route then leads to an external terrace which, because of the complex sectional organisation involving further terraces overhead, reads as a transitional space between inside and outside. Finally, a straight-flight stair leads into a gar- den to conclude a complex promenade (Figure 3.47). The route reveals sequentially the building's principal spaces but at the same Figure 3.46 Le Corbusier, Villa at Garches, 1 927. North elevation. Arriving at the diagram 33 Figure 3.47 Le Corbusier, Villa atGarches, 1927. First floor plan. From student model, University of Nottingham. Figure 3.48 Alvar Aalto, Baker House, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1951 . From Modern Architecture since 1 900, Curtis, W., Phaidon, p. 297. time conceals the 'service' elements of the plan like service stair, servants' quarters at ground floor and kitchen at first floor to establish a clear functional hierarchy. Whereas at Garches the route marks and celebrates the prominence of an elevated first floor or piano nobile, the reverse can be employed to equally dramatic effect; at Alvar Aalto's serpentine student dormitory block for Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., 1949, visitors engage with this riverside building at high level and descend into the principal foyer and social spaces with views over the Charles River (Figure 3.48). James Stirling developed this notion of a complex route within the context of a highly disciplined plan to further levels of sophisti- cation at two celebrated art galleries; the Neue Staatsgalerie at Stuttgart, 1984 (Figure 3.49), and the Clore Gallery, Tate Gallery, London, 1986 (Figure 3.50). Both celebrate access by preamble and transition and both buildings use the promenade as a powerful structuring device engaging with ramps and stairs which provide a dynamic element alongside a controlled sequence of gallery spaces. At a more prosaic level, Peter Womersley employed similar devices to describe the 34 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 3.49 James Stirling, Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart, 1984. From Architectural Review, 12/92, p. 77. organisation of his design for Roxburgh County Offices, Scotland, 1970 (Figure 3.51). Here a 'campanile' forming strong- rooms at each office level initially marks but conceals from view the entrance, itself high- lighted by a deep recession within the office structure. This, in turn, gives access to an entrance foyer, also double height with over- sailing gallery at first floor. The entrance doors flank a lift shaft which is expressed externally and the foyer engages with a central court- yard. Therefore, by using such simple devices, the essence of this public building is directly revealed to the user; a three-storey courtyard typology with dual aspect cellular offices linked by a central 'racetrack' corridor.

From A-D Freestyle Classicism, 1982, p. 108. + W G Figure 3.51 Peter Womersley, Roxburgh County Offices, 1968, Ground floor plan. Arriving at the diagram 35 Whilst formally of a very different genre, Womersley nevertheless similarly harnesses the promenade to describe and clarify the fun- damental components of a functional plan. Spatial hierarchies Whilst such patterns of circulation and the ordering of 'routes' through a building allow us to 'read' and to build up a three-dimen- sional picture, there remains the equally important question of how we communicate the essential differences between the spaces which these systems connect. This suggests a hierarchical system where spaces, for exam- ple, of deep symbolic significance, are clearly identified from run-of-the-mill elements which merely service the architectural programme so that an organisational hierarchy is articulated via the building. Similarly, for example, when designing for the community it is essential that those spaces within the public domain are clearly distinguished from those deemed to be intensely private. Between these two extremes there is, of course, a range of spatial events which needs to be placed within this hierarchical order which the building also must communicate. This clear distinction was achieved by Denys Lasdun at the Royal College of Physicians, Regent's Park, London, 1960 (Figure 3.52), where the ceremonial area of the building addresses the park as a stark stratified pavilion Figure 3.52 Denys Lasdun, Royal College of Physicians, London, 1959. From Denys Lasdun, Curtis, W., Phaidon. elevated on pilotis. By contrast, the office ele- ment is expressed simply as a self-effacing infill to the street beyond (Figure 3.53). Moreover, the distinction is clearly expressed externally and further reinforced as the plan is explored internally. Figure 3.53 Denys Lasdun, Royal College of Physicians, London, 1959. From Denys Lasdun, Curtis, W., Phaidon. 36 Architecture: Design Notebook Sub-spaces This whole question of spatial hierarchy may also be applied to sub-spaces which are sub- servient to a major spatial event like side chapels relating to the major worship space within a church. At the monastery of La Tourette, Eveux-sur-Arbresle, France, 1959, Le Corbusier contrasted the stark dimly-lit cuboid form of the church with brightly-lit side chapels of sinuous plastic form which were further highlighted by the application of primary colour against the grey beton brut of the church (Figure 3.54). Such a juxtaposition served to heighten not only the architectural drama but also the primacy of the principal worship space. Although using a different architectural vocabulary, C. R. Mackintosh sought similarly to clarify a major space (bedroom) at Hill House, Helensburgh, Scotland, 1 904, which associated sub-spaces enriched rather than challenged (Figure 3.55). But the means were the same; by means of a taller ceiling and a simple rectilinear geometry, the major space retains its dominance. Similarly, public buildings like theatres must establish a clear distinction between public and private domains of 'front' and 'back' of house. Lasdun's National Theatre, London, 1 976, articulates this distinction through exter- nal architectural expression, but more directly by means of a clear planning strategy which is Figure 3.54 Le Corbusier, Monastery of La Tourette, Eveux, 1955. Figure 3.55 C. R. Mackintosh, Hill House, Helensburgh, Scotland, 1903. Main bedroom. Arriving at the diagram 37 immediately comprehensible (Figure 3.56) and avoids any hint of ambiguity. Inside-outside Establishing and then articulating these spatial hierarchies within the context of a functional plan has exercised architects throughout his- tory; a system of axes employed by Beaux Arts architects, for example, greatly facilitated this pursuit. But many architects of modernist per- suasion, in their desire to break with tradition, have shed such ordering devices and have espoused the liberating potential thatdevelop- ments in abstract art and building technology seemed to offer. One outcome was functional planning freed from the formality of symmetry and axiality (Figure 3.57) but another was a concern for establishing an almost seamless relationship between inside and outside spaces. This allowed the designerto punctuate the plan with external spaces which were expressed as internal spaces without a roof. Moreover, the development of glazed curtain walls as movable screens allowed the com- plete correspondence between outside and inside uninterrupted by major structural intru- sion. Even by the mid-1 920s modernists had developed such techniques to a remarkable level of sophistication; Le Corbusier's Parisian villas at Garches, 1 927, and Poissy, 1 931 , deploy controlled external spaces as an Figure 3.56 Denys Lasdun, National Theatre, London, Plan.

At Garches full- height parapet walls punctuated by carefully- placed openings enclose what are in effect external living spaces (Figure 3.58). At Poissy an internal ramp engages with an exter- nal terrace and terminates at a solarium (Figure 3.59) and the fenetre longue of the living room is projected into the full-height enclosing parapet of the adjacent terrace, establishing yet another inside/outside ambi- guity (Figure 3.60). 4 CHOOSING APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES In our quest for form-making we have long been aware of the role of technology; in the eighteenth century Marc-Antoine Laugier, the celebrated critic, declared that technique was the prime cause of architectural expression, a proposition developed in the nineteenth cen- tury and indeed, adopted as a central plank of modernism in the twentieth. But the proposi- tion has much deeper roots; primitive builders looked around them for available building materials which, when assembled, could provide shelter. STRUCTURE Such materials tended to be sticks, blocks, membranes (animal skins), or malleable clay which developed into an orthodoxy of framed, planar or plastic structural forms respectively (Figures 4.1—4.3). Although this represents an over-simplifica- tion, nevertheless, there are several modernist icons which clearly express a similar range of structural forms apparently facilitated by a burgeoning technology. Not unnaturally, the same formal categories of framed, planar, Figure 4. 1 Framed form. 40 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 4.2 Planar form. and plastic were to emerge pursued with vary- ing degrees of rigour. Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House, Piano, Illinois, 1951, remains as the archetypal framed pavilion (Figure 4.4), Gerrit Rietveld's Schroder House, Utrecht, 1 924, celebrated the poten- tial of planar form (Figure 4.5), whilst Erich Mendelsohn's Einstein Tower, Pottsdam, 1924 explored plasticity (Figure 4.6). Whereas these examples demonstrate an adherence to one formal type, most buildings embody all three simultaneously. Le Corbusier's seminal Villa Savoye, Poissy, 1 931 , is a case in point; here, 'framed' pilotis support the cuboid 'planar' elements of the principal floor which in turn is surmounted by the 'plastic' forms of the solarium (Figure 4.7). But such attempts to explore the potential of new building techniques in establishing a modernist formal vocabulary exposed pro- Figure 4.3 Plastic form.

Already discussed is the profound effect of technological invention and development upon building types and therefore form-mak- ing. Indeed, a modernist orthodoxy decreed that, 'The Modern Movement in architecture, in order to be fully expressive of the twentieth century, had to possess . . . faith in science and technology . . .' (Pevsner). Figure 4.6 Erich Mendelsohn, Einstein Tower, Potsdam, 1921 . From Architects' Journal 4.6, p. 64. Figure 4.7 Le Corbusier, Villa Savoye, Poissy, 1931. From Le Corbusier and the Tragic View of Architecture, Jencks, C, Penguin Allen Lane, p. 92. 42 Architecture: Design Notebook SERVICES Consequently, architects seized upon not only the form-making potential of new structural techniques, but also that of mechanical services. This approach reached its zenith at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, 1977 (Figure 4.8), and at the headquarters for Lloyd's of London, 1986 (Figure 4.9), both by Richard Rogers, where the conven- tional central core of services within a flex- ible space was reversed so that these elements were shifted to the periphery of the building. Furthermore, they were given clear external expression so that lift cars, Figure 4.9 Richard Rogers, Lloyds Building, London, 1986. From Richard Rogers, Architectural Monographs, Academy, p. 129. Figure 4.8 Richard Rogers, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, 1977. escalators, and ventilation ducts were dis- played as a dramatic image of so-called 'hi-tech' architecture. But such had not always been the case; pro- gressive nineteenth-century architects, equally concerned with incorporating the benefits of a burgeoning technology within their buildings, felt no compulsion to express such innovation either internally or externally and it was only those architects who did so, however tenta- tively, that gained any credit as precursors of the modernist cause (Figure 4.1 0). Similarly, architects of so-called post-modern persua- sion have also felt little compulsion to allow innovative structure or services to inform an Choosing appropriate technologies 43 rfiTK, Figure 4.10 Deane and Woodward, Museum of Natural History, Oxford, 1861. From Bannister Fletcher, Architectural Press, p. 1024. architectural expression whose origins were quite remote from such considerations (Figure 4.1 1). The honest expression of ele- ments which make up a building exercised architects throughout the twentieth century so that a question of morality has constantly underpinned the modernists' creed, a position joyously abandoned by their post-modern brethren. HOW WILL IT STAND UP? Nowhere is this notion of architectural honesty more prevalent than in structural expression. We have seen how architects have sought to Figure 4.

From Freestyle Classicism, Jenks, C,A—D, p. 81. express diagrams of circulation within their buildings or have indicated a functional orga- nisation of volumes through direct formal expression, but designers have also harnessed structure as a principal generator in theirform- finding explorations. Structural expression The logical conclusion of this pursuit of struc- tural expression is a close correspondence of structure, form and space enclosure. This total interdependence has been a central pursuit of modernists and accounts fortheir liberal refer- ences to such nineteenth-century icons as Dutert's Galerie des Machines built for the 1889 Parisian Exposition (Figure 4.12), or Freyssinet's airship hangars at Orly, France, 1 91 6 (Figure 4.1 3). Where the architectural 44 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 4. J 2 Contamin et Dutert, Ga/erie des Machines, Paris Exposition, 1889.

This has consistently been the case with the tent-like structures of Frei Otto (Figure 4.1 4), or with the geodesic domes of Buckminster Figure 4.13 Freyssinet, Airship Hangar, Orly, Paris, 1916. From Bannister Fletcher, Architectural Press, p. 1 I 06. Figure 4. 14 Frei Otto, Olympic Games Complex, Munich, 1972. From Dictionary of Architecture, St James Press, p. 243. Fuller (Figure 4.15) where decisions about structure determine the nature of external form but also as a direct outcome, the type of space enclosed. Furthermore, the nature of the external membranes of both examples allows a close correspondence with the structure whilst at the same time providing transparency or translucency for daylighting purposes. But such structural virtuosity, whilst a demon- stration of skill admirably suited to an exhibi- tion building where the primary need is for one large uncluttered and flexible space, is hardly appropriate for more complex architectural programmes; in such situations, the designer re-engages with the notion of 'type'. Although modern structural engineering techniques may Choosing appropriate technologies 45 Figure 4.15 Fuller and Sadao Inc., US Pavilion Expo '67, Montreal. From Visual History of Twentieth Century Architecture, Sharp, D., Heinemann, p. 280. tial freedom that framed structures offered architects in generating new plan types. Indeed, Le Corbusier's 'Five Points of the New Architecture' and most particularly his concept of the 'open' plan were dependent upon the minimal structural intrusion on plan that a framed structural type offered (Figure 4.1 6); rather than the intrusive and therefore restrictive 'footprint' of loadbearing walls (Figure 4.1 7), the minimal repetitive footprint of a column within a structural grid seemed to offer a new vocabulary of space enclosure. Moreover, by wilfully avoiding the columns, non-loadbearing partitions could weave on plan between them without challenging the primacy of the structural system (Figure 4.1 8). seem to offer bewildering choices forthe archi- tect, the range of tectonic types (like plan types) is limited. For example, will the programme best be served by an 'ad-hoc' application of a traditional load-bearing masonry and timber type, or should advanced building technology be explored with its very different formal con- sequences? Which tectonic type will best 'fit' the plan type and parti (or diagram) for the building currently being explored? Plan and structure At this stage in the exploration it is worth con- sidering how plan and structure interact. The modernists were quick to recognise the poten- Figure 4. 16 Column and slab structure facilitating 'open plan'. 46 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 4.17 Traditional house plan. Grid But the repetitive grid of a structural frame also offers an ordering device to the architect as the building's diagram is developed so that plan and structure interact (Figure 4.19). Moreover, such a system of repetitive frames or 'bays' provides a primary order in which a secondary order of sub-systems may operate (Figure 4.20), and this potential for flexibility can allow the designer to 'add' or 'subtract' spaces from the primary structure without dilut- ing its clarity.

Plane But modernists also employed traditional structural types in pursuit of new attitudes towards space enclosure and form-making, exploring the potential of masonry walls as planes which loosely defined spaces rather than enclosing them as in a traditional cellular plan. Moreover, timberwas used to create dra- matic cantilevered roof planes in pursuit of a planar architecture which, whilst employing traditional materials and building techniques, owed nothing to tradition. And just as the repe- titive structural grid had provided an ordering device to interact with the plan, so architects devised plan forms which were generated from a different kind of order; the disposition of wall 48 Architecture: Design Notebook and roof planes which itself reflected the lim- itations of a traditional building technology. Mies van der Rohe's design for a Brick Country House of 1 924 explored the potential of interrelated brickwork planes in liberating the plan (Figure 4.23) much in the manner of De Stijl attitudes towards space enclosure (Figure 4.24) whose origins could be traced back to Frank Lloyd Wright's 'prairie houses'; these had enjoyed an immense following in the Low Countries before and during the First World War following publication of the 'Wasmuth' volumes, a lavish production of Wright's oeuvre (Holland had remained neu- tral during that cataclysmic event and was able to develop its artistic movements unhindered by neighbouring hostilities). Wright developed these explorations still further in the celebrated 'Usonian' houses of the 1930s and 1940s Figure 4.23 Mies van der Rohe, Brick house, plan, 7 923.

James Stirling's design in 1 955 for CIAM Rural Housing (Figure 4.27) also demon- strates how simply-ordered traditional build- ing elements can generate a whole orga- nisation in plan and section as well as being the major determinants of the building's for- mal outcome. Similarly, the work of Edward Cullinan and Peter Aldington has its roots in this tectonic tradition (Figures 4.28, 4.29) where a discipline of building technique has provided the principal clues for the 'diagram' and the functional plan. This attitude towards using technique as a springboard for the pro- cess of design has produced in its wake a Choosing appropriate technologies 49 tfh_ A rft fti Figure 4.27 James Stirling, Rural housing project, CIAM, 1955.

Just as most buildings juxtapose a range of formal framed, planar or plastic elements, so do they embody contrasting tectonic types. This may well be a response to a programme demanding a range of accommodation, the cellular elements of which could be served by a traditional structure of load-bearing masonry, but where other parts of the building demanding uncluttered spaces will require the technology of large spans. Architects have seized upon the potential for form-making that such juxtapositions offer (Figure 4.30), but they also raise a question of structural hierarchies, where one structural Figure 4.30 Michael Hopkins, Inland Revenue Amenity Building, Nottingham, 1995.

Expression Having arrived at an appropriate structure, or set of structural systems, be they framed, pla- nar or plastic which will allow the 'diagram' to develop and mature, the designer is faced with the whole question of structural expression and how this interacts with the 'skin' of the building. Should the external membrane oversail and obscure a structural frame, should it infill and therefore express the frame, or should the frame be revealed as a free-standing element proud of the external cladding or 'skin' (Figures 4.31-4.33)? Moreover, if load-bearing masonry structure is adopted, should the building in its external expression articulate a clear distinction between what is load-bearing and what is Choosing appropriate technologies 51 Figure 4.31 Cladding 'oversailing' structure. Figure 4.33 Cladding recessed behind structure. Figure 4.32 Cladding 'flush' with structure. merely non-load-bearing infill. Therefore within this complex design process, attitudes towards choice of structure and its expression established at an early stage, inevitably have a profound effect upon a formal outcome. HOW IS IT MADE? Tectonic display Having established what the 'carcass' or bare bones of the structure will be, the designerwill give further thought to how these 'blocks', 'sticks' or 'membranes' will be assembled and joined together. As we shall see in the next chapter, this process in itself allows the 52 Architecture: Design Notebook designer plenty of scope for architectural expression, for just as architects of the func- tionalist school decreed that the nature of the 'carcass' should receive attention as an expressive element, so did they tend towards the view that the nature of materials making up the building's envelope, and more particu- larly, the manner of their assembly, should also contribute to 'reading' the building. To the modernist there was something inher- ently satisfying about a building which was so explicit about its structure, its materials and its assembly and construction that it is not surpris- ing that the pioneers of modernism looked to the work of contemporaneous structural, mechanical or nautical engineers and its naked expression of materials and assembly, for an acceptable modus operandi (Figures 4.34—4.36). But the pluralist world of so- called post-modernism in which we now find ourselves allows for alternative forms of archi- tectural expression where other pressures, be they cultural or contextual, may well override Figure 4.35 1 903 Renault. any perceived need to make an explicit display of structure, or constructional method. The envelope The majority of our constructional concerns relate to the design of the building's external envelope; the walls and roof membranes and how these are pierced for lighting or access. Decisions about the nature of this external Figure 4.34 Robert Stephenson, Britannia Bridge, Menai Strait, 1850. From Architecture of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century, Hitchock, Penguin. Figure 4.36 The Flandre. From Towards a New Architecture, Architectural Press, p. 81 . Choosing appropriate technologies 53 'skin' to the building will not only interact with other major decisions as the design develops, butwill alsodeterminetoa large extent how the building will look. The roof Take the roof for example; will it be flat or pitched, and in either case will it project beyond the wall plane to afford some protec- tion from the weather or will it be arrested behind a para pet wall? Should the roof be con- sidered as a lightweight 'umbrella' structurally and visually separate from the principal struc- tural idea (Figure4.37), or does that idea also produce the roof envelope merely by the appli- cation of a waterproof membrane (Figure 4.38)? These fundamental questions of whether the roof is a lightweight or a heavy- weight envelope (with a considerable thermal mass) have real consequences regarding the building's appearance but also its perfor- mance. Flat roof technology has developed so that insulation is positioned at the 'cold' side of any heavyweight roof, allowing the structural ther- mal mass to work in favour of the building's thermal performance. Not surprisingly, the flat roof (or a roof with minimum falls to points of rainwater collection) will be considered as a continuous impervious skin whether that skin is applied to a heavyweight structure orto a light- weight roof 'deck'. But as to pitched roofs, decisions regarding a lightweight imperme- able and continuous membrane as opposed to a heavy roof of traditional provenance formed from individual tiles or slates which are by their nature permeable, will again Figure 4.37 Michael Hopkins, Inland Revenue Amenity Building, Nottingham, 1995. Section. From Architectural Review 5/95, p. 46. Figure 4.38 P. L. Nervi, Palace of Sport, Rome, 1957. From Visual History of the Twentieth Century Architecture, Sharp, D., p. 21 3. 54 Architecture: Design Notebook have a profound effect upon the building's appearance. Moreover, the particular materi- als employed in the latter case will determine the limit of inclination or pitch for the roof plane; the larger the tile or slate, the lower the pitch which may be effected. Clearly such constraints also contribute to the visual out- come of any roof (Figures 4.39, 4.40). Another strategic element of roof design is how rainwater is to be collected. It is important to realise how such an apparently mundane and banal proposition as rainwater collection can have a profound effect upon how a build- ing looks. Many architects have seized upon expressive devices at the roof's edge to collect water from the roof membrane and then dis- charge it (Figures 4.41 , 4.42); exaggerated Figure 4.40 Traditional heavy slate and pantile roofs. Figure 4.39 Lightweight roof 'deck'. Figure 4.41 Le Corbusier, Chapel, Ronchamp, France, 1955. Choosing appropriate technologies 55 Figure 4.42 Ralph Erskine, Clare Hall, Cambridge, 1968. Rainwater chute. projecting eaves have rendered such expres- sion even more explicit (Figure 4.42). In con- tradistinction to this approach, some architects have chosen to conceal gutters and downpipes (with obvious consequences for future main- tenance) within the building fabric. Where a pitched roof is employed, this may result in a minimal roof surface of projecting eaves beyond the building's edge shedding water to the ground without recourse to any system of collection (Figure 4.43). In any event it is important to understand the visual conse- quences of such decision-making. The facade Like the roof, the wall membrane is an 'envir- onmental filter' which contributes to the buil- Figore 4.43 Donald MacMorran, Social Science Building, Nottingham University, 1957. Eaves detail. ding's performance and decisions regarding lightweight versus heavyweight, or permeable versus impermeable which applied to the roof likewise need to be considered. But in the case of walls these decisions assume a greater degree of complexity for, much more than roofs, walls tend to be punctuated by openings to provide access, daylighting, views out, or ventilation, all of which have to be accommo- dated within the strategy for construction. Should traditional loadbearing structure be employed, then the wall membrane will be 'heavy' and most likely permeable. Moreover, openings are likely to be formed within this heavy membrane by simple lintels which suggests a directly expressive 'hole-in- the-wall' architecture (Figure 4.44). By con- 56 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 4.44 Donald MacMorran, Social Science Building, Nottingham University, 1957. Window detail. trast, a structural frame opens up a whole range of alternatives for considering the nature of the external wall. At one level, a non-struc- tural traditional heavy envelope may conceal structural columns, beams and floor slabs and may employ a traditional 'hole-in-the-wall' expression thereby flouting the modernist orthodoxy for structural 'honesty' (this has become much less of a 'sacred cow' since the emergence of a post-modern pluralism). But just as a repetitive framed structure has liberated the plan so has it liberated the facade. Architectsarenowfaced with a rangeof devices to express 'wall' which may or may not express the primary structure. Atone level a lightweight impervious 'rainscreen' mayoversail theframe and in the process provide the principal gen- erator of architectural expression, openings appearing in the monolithic screen as and when required. Alternatively, the screen may be considered as repetitive panels which may oversail the structure but junctions between panels will conform to the structural grid; in such a situation the design of panels to allow for a range of openings determines the archi- tectural expression (Figure4.45). Moreover, it is possible to express the structural framewithin both light and heavy envelopes; at its most basic, theframe remains proud of the cladding (Figure 4.46) or is simply infilled (Figure 4.47). It is notour purpose hereto provide a manual of building construction techniques but rather Figure 4.45 Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, Factory, Bath, England, 1976. Choosing appropriate technologies 57 Figure 4.46 Roche, Dinkeloo, Factory, Darlington, 1964. Figure 4.47 James Cubitt and Partners with Eero Saarinen, Factory, Darlington, 1964. to articulate a range of attitudes and options open to the designer. Clearly the nature of the membrane is determined by the nature of the materials which it comprises, whether heavy or light, permeable or impermeable, monolithic or comprising a variety of distinct components. However, most of our constructional concerns not unnaturally surround the whole question of joining one element to another. At a fundamental level, how is the wall con- nected to the roof and how does the wall meet the floor? And how does a cladding membrane join the structure? How do we achieve a satisfactory junction between solid and void, opaque and transparent ele- ments within the building's 'skin'? The outcome of all of these questions will have a powerful effect upon the building's appearance and therefore upon how we 'read' the building. We have a I ready discussed how a clear 'diagram' involving the functional plan and structural expression allows us to 'read' and assimilate a building's organisa- tion. This notion may be further extended to construction so that the building is also 'read' ata detailed level where secondary and tertiary elements which make up the building add to an understanding of and are consistent with the primary design decisions surrounding the diagram or parti. Consequently, design seen in this context is a reiterative process where themes are intro- duced and repeated throughout the building, 58 Architecture: Design Notebook externally and internally; materials and con- structional techniques employed within the building's external fabric may be applied internally in pursuit of 'thematic' consistency. WILL IT BE COMFORTABLE? Just as a designer's attitudes towards structure and how that structure is clad may profoundly affect the form-making process, so may our stance regarding environmental comfort have a powerful bearing upon thatformal outcome. And just as architects harnessed new technol- ogies of structure and construction to liberate the plan, so did an artificially controlled inter- nal environment remove traditional planning limitations; the option now existed for creating deep-planned buildings freed from the orga- nisational constraints of natural ventilation and lighting. This brings us yet again to the notion of 'type' and its central position in the design process for not only, as previously discussed, can 'type' inform our attitudes towards 'plan' and 'struc- ture', but it can also determine how the various criteria for environmental comfort are to be met. Active v passive Therefore, the designer may decide that com- fort will be achieved totally by artificial means where heating, ventilation and lighting stan- dards are met by the installation of sophisti- cated mechanical and electrical plant. This may be considered to be one 'type' where the internal environment is subjected entirely to artificial control. At the other extreme, the designer may wish to harness the building's inherent characteristics in a passive way to control levels of comfort. Historically, such were the constraints of nat- ural ventilation and lighting, that designers were forced into the orthodoxy of a narrow plan for efficient cross-ventilation from open- ing windows, and a generous floor-ceiling height to maximise levels of natural lighting (Figure 4.48). By way of a bonus such build- ings of heavy traditional construction also Figure 4.48 Nineteenth-century office, typical section. Choosing appropriate technologies 59 offered considerable thermal mass for passive cooling in summer and heat retention in win- ter. But with the move during the mid-twentieth century towards a totally artificial environment, architects found themselves no longer con- strained by a narrow plan typology and were free to explore the potential of deep plans. Therefore as these systems developed in their levels of sophistication, so the traditional role of the building fabric itself as an 'environmen- tal filter' was displaced (Figure 4.49). So just as framed and large-span structures developed during the nineteenth century mod- ified a traditional correspondence between plan and structure, so did the development of Figure 4.49 Richard Rogers, Inmos Factory, Newport, Wales, 1982. From Richard Rogers Architectural Monographs, Academy, p. 65. mechanical servicing within buildings during the twentieth century replace the inherent environmental capability of traditional build- ing forms. And moreover, just as progressive architects seized upon new structural forms for fresh architectural expression in the early twen- tieth century, so did the next generation exploit the expressive quality of tubes, ducts and plant associated with mechanical servicing. Clearly, the selection by the designer of an 'environmental' type has consequences upon the developmentand outcome of the design as profound as considerations of type when applied to 'structure' and 'plan'. All such types must be considered simultaneously and are inherently interactive. Therefore at one extreme we arrive at a type entirely dependent upon the mechanical control of heating, cool- ing and ventilation for thermal comfort and upon permanent artificial lighting. At the other, a type emerges which embraces purely passive measures in achieving acceptable levels of comfort, not only harnessing the building fabric to achieve natural ventilation and lighting, but also potentially using the building as a collector of available solar and wind energy; in extreme cases such buildings may exceed in energy generation their energy consumption. But most environmental types fall between these two extremes and just as architects initi- ally embraced an emergent technology of mechanical ventilation to assist an inherently 60 Architecture: Design Notebook passive traditional system, so do most types emerge as hybrid systems. The orthodoxy of an artificial environment served by mechanical means of high energy consumption was to undergo a fundamental revision largely on account of the so-called 'energy crisis' of the 1 970s. Architects recon- sidered and reinterpreted traditional passive methods of environmental control which did not rely upon profligate levels of energy con- sumption and this fundamental shift in attitude was applied to a range of building types to produce a new orthodoxy for the latter part of the twentieth century. As already indicated, such changing attitudes were profoundly to affect the formal outcome of established build- ing types; the reversion to 'narrow' plans (Figure 4.50), the development of the enclosed 'atrium' form (Figure 4.51), and such devices as 'thermal chimneys' (Figure 4.52) were all developed as part of this passive revival, and architects were quick to recognise their potential for form-making.

Central to the environmental functioning of the building was the 'solar wall' whose height and length to a large extent predetermined the form and orientation of the building. As a heat source Architectural expression The outcome of such concerns for energy con- sumption has been a profound modification of established partis for a range of building types as diverse as offices, hospitals, health centres, housing and schools.

But the plan type, a linear single bank of teaching spaces, south facing and with corridor access and lavatory accom- modation on the north side, is entirely subser- vient to the functioning of the solar wall (Figure 4.53). Moreover, the section incorpo- rates a steep monopitched roof to accommo- date the tall solar wall, and offering much reduced headroom to a heavily insulated and minimally fenestrated north elevation (Figure 4.54). Therefore the whole 'diagram' for the building and its formal outcome departed fundamentally from an established 'linked pavilion' or 'courtyard' type for school building in favour of a clear 'linear' organisa- Figure 4.54 Emslie Morgan, Wallasey School, 1961. From The Environmental Tradition, Hawkes, D., Spon, p. 120. 62 Architecture: Design Notebook tion as a direct result of a radical environmen- tal strategy. At the Inland Revenue offices, Nottingham, 1 995, Michael Hopkins demonstrated how considerations of heating, cooling and light- ing were major factors in generating a plan form well-removed from a prevailing deep- plan orthodoxy. In the event, a medium-rise courtyard type prevailed as a direct conse- quence of this strategy, but also suggesting an appropriate model for extending an existing 'grain' of the city onto redundant inner-city sites. At the onset of the design process it was decided to avoid air conditioning, but to har- ness ambient energy and natural lighting as much as possible. The outcome is a narrow plan which gives views through (opening) windows to internal courtyards or to external public 'boulevards'. Moreover, masonry piers supporting exposed precast concrete floor slabs provide substantial thermal mass to maintain an equable internal environment (Figure 4.55). The expression of these mas- sive piers and the barrel-vaulted floor slabs which they support help us to 'read' the build- ing but also provide a repetitive rhythm and 'scale' to the elevations. Moreover, the light shelves which reflect daylight deep into the plan and the low-level louvres which prevent the penetration of winter sun are also used to impart an intensity to the scale of the building. Cylindrical thermal chimneys extract air from the offices, accommodate the stairs, and offer Figure 4.55 Michael Hopkins and Partners, Inland Revenue Offices, Nottingham, 1995. From Architectural Review 5/95, p. 37. an external 'marker' to the points of entry (Figure 4.56). The result is a satisfying corre- spondence of plan type, structural and envir- onmental types, formal outcome and detailed architectural expression. WILL IT BE GREEN? So far we have established how specific tec- tonic decisions regarding structure, construc- tion, or environmental performance may affect the formal outcome of our building design, but what of the much broader issue of sustainabil- Choosing appropriate technologies 63 Figure 4.56 Sir Michael Hopkins and Partners, Inland Revenue Offices, Nottingham, 1995.

Attitudes towards achieving a sustainable environment gathered considerable momen- tum during the latter quarter of the twentieth century. Consequently, architects practising in this century now view sustainability as a central plank of their professional skills, and a neces- sary addition to those traditions already aggre- gated. But what do we mean by sustainability? At its broadest, a sustainable environment will be healthy for its inhabitants, will be economic during its life span, and will be capable of adapting to society's changing needs. Many buildings throughout history have, indeed, satisfied these criteria and may be deemed sus- tainable, but conversely, many (particularly from the twentieth century) have not. Instead they have met with premature obsolescence and, in many cases, demolition. But for the architect, much of sustainability surrounds the minimising of fossil fuel con- sumption with an attendant reduction of greenhouse gas emission (of which carbon dioxide represents the main component), which contributes to global warming. The orthodoxy of deep-plan, mechanically air- conditioned buildings which relied on high levels of permanent artificial lighting, and often used materials of high embodied energy (Figure4.57), has been replaced by buildings designed for natural lighting and ventilation, which harness alternative forms of energy such as solar or wind power (Figure 4.58). This suggests a design regime where climate and site can fundamentally influence primary design decisions. Moreover, such buildings will conserve energy and will be constructed of re-usable materials with minimal environ- Figore 4.57 Deep-plan orthodoxy. 64 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 4.58 'Sustainable' orthodoxy. mental impact in their manufacture and trans- port to the site. In the pursuit of sustainable architecture, this suggests a further 'sub-set' of design principles to add to those discussed elsewhere: harnes- sing climate and natural energy sources; selecting re-cyclable materials of low em- bodied energy; and energy conservation. Arguably, these principles are long established in architectural history, and have only recently been rediscovered to represent the architec- tural aspirations of the twenty-first century, but it is their interaction which promises a new 'holistic' architecture with genuine sus- tainable credentials and fresh opportunities for formal invention. Climate and natural energy Harnessing the climate to improve human comfort is nothing new; the Greeks and Romans well recognised the benefits of design- ing dwellings whose principal rooms faced south to improve thermal comfort. But in some climates, designers are met with the pro- blem of cooling spaces to improve comfort, and here, similarly, we can look to tradition. High-density Middle Eastern courtyard hous- ing used shade and a water fountain to cool air within the courtyard, which was then exhausted via wind towers to assist cooling of the habitable rooms (Figure 4.59). Window openings were kept to a minimum to restrict solar gain. By contrast, the traditional Malay house moderated a tropical climate by using a framed structure of low thermal mass with overhanging eaves to a pitched roof, which offered shading from the sun but also protec- tion from monsoon rains. Wall openings at roof level provided cross ventilation to assist cooling (Figure 4.60). But how have contemporary designers used climate as a source of renewable energy to Figure 4.59 Middle East courtyard house. Choosing appropriate technologies 65 Figure 4.60 Malay house-on-stilts. heat, light, and cool buildings and to improve comfort? Mosttechniques involve solarenergy used actively and passively, or wind power. Passive solar energy Because passive systems of recovering solar energy are readily accessible, and after twenty years' development have reached a sophisti- cated level, they are the most prevalent. At a fundamental level, passive solar design depends upon: (a) principal facades facing south-east to south-west; (b) the site's orienta- tion and gradient; (c) avoiding overshadowing on site from existing obstructions; and (d) avoiding overshadowing from obstructions beyond the site boundary. Passive systems embrace simple direct gain (of solar energy), indirect gain, or a combination of both. Direct gain, as its name implies, depends upon a majority of the building's fenestration facing south-east— south west (for the northern hemisphere) so that solar radiation enters the building directly. Ideally, such fenestration should relate to principal spaces, relegating purely service areas to north-facing facades. The high thermal mass of floor slabs in direct contact with solar radiation can be used as a thermal 'store' to moderate internal tempera- ture fluctuations; in domestic situations, the warmed floor slab will release its stored heat during the evening when occupancy is likely to be at its highest. At night, the detailed design of fenestration (preferably triple-glazed with low- emissivity glass) can assist this heat retention by including internal insulated blinds; daytime overheating in summer can be reduced by incorporating external shading devices (blinds or louvres), or simply by extending the canopy of roof eaves. Analysis of existing direct gain systems in domestic applications suggests that the dwelling depth should be limited to 1 2 m and that solar glazing should be no more than 35 per cent of the room's floor area. For opti- mal solar collection in the UK, roof pitch should be at 30° to 40° with solar facades at 60° to 70° from the horizontal (Figure 4.61). Indirect gain depends upon an 'interface' of high thermal mass located between the sun and habitable spaces, so that solar energy is transferred indirectly to the interior. The Trombe wall is the most common 'indirect gain' device and employs a 300 mm thermal storage wall located between an outer skin of glazing and habitable space. Its area should 66 Architecture: Design Notebook Figure 4.61 Direct solar gain. Figure 4.62 Trombe wall not exceed 20 per cent of the area which it heats. Just as the floor slab in direct gain sys- tems releases its stored heat slowly, so the Trombe wall allows its stored heat to be trans- mitted to the interior at a rate depending upon its thickness. The outer skin of glazing provides a rain screen but also contributes to heat reten- tion through an inherent 'greenhouse' effect. The Trombe's efficiency is enhanced by incor- porating vents at its base and head, which con- nect the glazed void to the habitable space; by convection, airfrom the room is tempered and re-circulated (Figure 4.62). The familiar conservatory or 'sunspace' embraces both direct and indirect solar gain and provides, economically, a flexible exten- sion to habitable space. Thermal isolation will reduce heat loss from an adjacent room in winter and will control heat gain in summer. Vents will allow for a moderating air flow between the conservatory and its adjoining space (Figure 4.63). Active solar energy There are two types of active solar systems; those which directly use the sun's rays (as in a flat plate collector) and those which convert solar energy into another power source (as in photovoltaic cells). Both collectors are mounted on south-facing roofs at optimum pitch (30° to 40°). Choosing appropriate technologies 67 Figure 4.63 Attached 'sunspace'. The flat plate collector is essentially a water- filled calorifier behind an absorber plate, which transfers solar heat to another medium. In the UK, it is generally used for domestic hot water systems, where roof-mounted collectors heat water storage tanks within the roofspace (Figure 4.64). Photovoltaic (PV) cells convert solar energy into electrical power which is then harnessed within the building for space heating, cooling, mechanical ventilation, or lighting. They embody two layers of semi-conducting mate- rial which, when exposed to sunlight, generate Figure 4.64 Flat plate solar collector. electrical power. They are normally incorpo- rated within roof or wall cladding systems, and in some installations offer sun shading. Embodied energy and recycling The 'embodied' energy of materials within a building is complex, and relates to how such materials can be recycled after the building's 'first use', as well as to the energy used in their manufacture and transport to the site. Moreover, embodied ener"
