Postmodernism: refusing to define identity and explicitly denying any classical or modern notion of “objective truth” Transitioning from industrial to information age – Rejection of linear history, time, and space – Rejection and disillusionment with capitalism and the corporate/elite takeover of all areas of expression\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 Semiotics and Deconstruction Semiotics: the study of languages and symbols that define and communicate our subjective experiences in a shared space Deconstruction: the tearing down of semiotics by exposing the ultimate limitations of language to properly describe the universe. – Emphasizing the non-verbal realities as SUBJECTIVE, DIVERSE, ECLECTIC and ARBITRARY – Emphasis on the Post-Einsteinian science revealed in quantum mechanics (see double-slit experiment)\n\n7 Visual Map Comparison Artist Rationality Idea/Narrative Visual Means Audience Objective Truth/Experience/Narrative Artist Experience Deconstruction Idea Visual Means Audience Subjective non-meaning\n\n8 Postmodern Art Focuses not on universal expression, but on subjective interpretation The eclectic borrowing from the past creating either whimsical and ironic surfaces, or an anti-corporate rejection of the “tyranny of the cube” Radical formalism that appears as “controlled chaos”\n\n9 And household items sold at Target… Michael Graves.

Meant to interact and immerse a view into the experiences of another.

He focuses here on issues of the surface and 3 metaphors of what pictorial space has been said to be: the painting as window, as flat plane, as a mirror reflection.

Matthew Marks Gallery, New York, and Monika Spruth Gallery, Cologne\n\n37 Pathetic Art Stuffed and crocheted animals Orphan dolls, handmade cast-offs nostalgia for youth and innocence that needs to be critically re-considered deconstructs the nostalgic notion of lost innocence by pointing to dysfunctionality and a gift culture where every exchange, no matter how innocent, is made with demands: love me, obey me, do what I want Buys them in thrift stores and re- contextualized them Uses these pathetic objects conceptually, thus, to make us critically question romantic notions that mystify or mask dysfunctional realities and to re-consider how complexly embroiled human interpersonal relations are. Context: late capitalistic, consumer- oriented society in which object-lust masks or cloaks an underlying state of human degradation; lifts up the slick, shiny surface of the hyperreal to see what might be lurking underneath--the pathetic and the abject (those aspects of the body or the real that we prefer to repress); the end of utopia; grunge.
