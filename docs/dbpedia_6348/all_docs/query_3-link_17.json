        "text": "Neither James Stirling nor his buildings were ever precisely what you expected, and that was forever his glory. Stirling, who died last month in London at the age of 66, did not look like an architect of international renown: he was overweight, spoke awkwardly, and tended to shuffle about in a uniform of dark suits, blue shirts and Hush Puppies. Yet his buildings dazzle. They leap across our field of vision with a consistent freshness and a capacity to inspire wonder. There is not one of them that does not bespeak a deep passion for the ability of architecture to enrich the human condition, and if many are troublesome, challenging structures, they nonetheless resonate with a sense of belief in human reason. His death brings to an end one of the remarkable architectural careers of the 20th century.\n\nStirling, who lived and worked in Great Britain, did not loom as large in this country as he should have, and that is only partly his fault. His American buildings, at least those that got built, were generally not his best. The architecture school at Rice University, his first American effort, completed in 1981, is a try at architectural diplomacy, a carefully wrought homage to the eclectic, vaguely Spanish Mission style of the original Rice campus.\n\nStirling designed it this way, I've always thought, to tell the world that for all he was known for bold gestures, he understood that there are times to be flamboyant and times to blend in. In fact, this building is full of quirky and subtle variations on the architectural themes of the rest of Rice, and is far more lively visually than it appears at first glance. But as the American debut of an architect whose buildings were known to have shock value, its quietness was the biggest shock of all.\n\nAt Harvard, where his Arthur M. Sackler Museum was completed in 1985, and at Cornell, where his performing arts center opened in 1989, Stirling loosened the reins a little bit, but not a lot. The Sackler is a masonry building of tremendous, controlled intensity, at once overreaching and plain. The Cornell structure is an idiosyncratic mix of inventively abstracted historical form and industrial elements, neatly composed to function both sculpturally and urbanistically. Yet it is also a brilliantly crafted piece of urban design, sitting beside a gorge at the edge of the campus, quite literally a bridge between town and gown, its complicated shapes crafted to show respect for both.\n\nThere is a wise lesson embodied in all three of these buildings, and it is in Stirling's determination to have his architecture demonstrate intensity and passion, and at the same time relate to its context. To Stirling and his longtime partner, Michael Wilford, there was no contradiction between these things. They did not want their buildings to lie down and play dead; not for them the softly purring architecture of the last decade, which does its fitting in by wrapping us in the illusion of a perfect past. Stirling buildings, the one at Rice notwithstanding, stand up and roar. Yet for all their strength, for all their brazen originality, they are never isolated objects. They can be completely different from what is beside them -- but they never seem designed to defy their surroundings, or to make other buildings seem ridiculous.\n\nFor much of his career, Stirling was a modernist. His modern buildings are lighter, more prancing, than so much postwar modern architecture in Britain; in the period known for the New Brutalist style, his work, like the Leicester University Engineering Building of 1963 (designed with James Gowan) or the History Faculty Building at Cambridge University of 1967, may have been hard-edged, but it was more joyfully sculptural than brutal. Later came the Olivetti Training School at Haslemere, in Surrey, of 1972, a kind of brightly colored, high-tech, striped metal tent erected beside an old manor house, a project that made it clearer than ever that Stirling had his own way of relating to older buildings -- and also how much he saw architecture as deeply sensual.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
