        "text": "The beginning of this century will undeniably be remembered as the museum's golden era. Since the museum boom which started at the end of the eighties, the role of the museum in modern society has been ceaselessly questioned, and the museum's position reevaluated. New museum buildings act as important urban catalysts of postindustrial cities, and possess ambitious aesthetic mechanisms, which affect the way in which the architectonic form expresses itself in order to reconcile the increasing functional and representational complexity of the contemporary museum. Museums illustrate the evolution of architecture and an accelerated transformation of trends in architecture, which can run either in parallel or in counteractive directions, but most frequently, in complete opposition to each other. With numerous examples of museum architecture, continually created from the end of the eighties to the present, one would imagine and even expect an enormous diversity in museum typology, but this is, in fact, only an illusion. A stunningly large number of museums find their retreat in a re-rendering of a few renowned museum archetypes (Durand's layout, Schinkel's Altes Museum scheme, Leo von Klenze's Alte Pinakothek stairs), but it seems that, in current mass production, only two characteristic typological trends can be recognized: the museum as a spectacular and \" unrepeatable \" architectonic form, and the museum as a neutral repetitive container or multifunctional box. In this paper, these two most proliferative and antipodal trends in contemporary museum architecture are analyzed, and their ability to satisfy the primary (though not necessarily the only) function of the museum – establishment of visual communication with objects of cultural and scientific significance exhibited within-is discussed.\n\nin: Journal for Art Market Studies, Vol 2, No 1 (2018) The structural development of commercial galleries and, more generally, of commercially used spaces for the presentation of art works as a historical architectural challenge in the first place should become an integral part of our perception. When the magazine Die Kunst spoke of “Art Dealer Palaces” in 1913, a prime example was Munich. This article will aim at reconstructing a multi-layered image through historical sources, in particular contemporary articles and reviews from architecture magazines or art journals. In fact, buildings and interiors of art dealers were passionately discussed during this period, and in some cases were even regarded as highly controversial. Several case studies will illustrate the extent to which the individual elements of presentation – wall, floor, ceiling, light, furniture, artworks and their frames were subject to a thorough revision in 1900, and the extent to which the interior design of commercially used exhibition spaces not only matched the staging concepts of museums and the Secessions, but were in fact closely linked to the idea of the museum reform movement and even established a modern private exhibition practice. While the article captures trends and peculiarities that in turn may allow conclusions to be drawn for the history of exhibition strategy in general, there is a need for more in-depth research of this neglected subject.\n\nAn astonishing method of lighting and picture presentation for the time was trialed in Kassel around 1750: in the midst of the construction process of the Gemäldegalerie (Picture Gallery), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, Wilhelm VIII, inspired by a Parisian collector, decided in favor of lighting from above and hanging the paintings on both long sides of the gallery. This fundamentally changed the original function of the gallery with lateral light incidence and a new type of gallery was formed. This was to define the museum architecture of the 19th century and was significant for the institutional transformation from a royal collection to a modern art museum. The unconventional lighting and the discussions around it show that the paintings as works of art (and not as part of the royal decor) were central to the planning. Oberlicht aus Paris: der Baustop der Kasseler Gemäldegalerie im Jahr 1750 als museumsgeschichtliches Ereignis Eine für die Zeit erstaunliche Art der Belichtung und Bildpräsentation wurde um 1750 in Kassel erprobt: Mitten im Bauprozess der Gemäldegalerie entschied sich Landgraf Wilhelm VIII., angeregt durch einen Pariser Sammler, für eine von oben einfallende Belichtung und eine Hängung der Gemälde auf beiden Längsseiten der Galerie. Damit wurde die ursprüngliche Funktion der Galerie mit seitlichem Lichteinfall grundlegend verändert und ein neuer Galerietypus entwickelt. Dieser sollte die Museumsarchitektur des 19. Jahrhunderts bestimmen und war für den institutionellen Wandel von der fürstlichen Sammlung zum modernen Kunstmuseum signifikant. Die unkonventionelle Belichtung und die Diskussionen darum zeigen, dass die Gemälde als Kunstwerke (und nicht als Teil des fürstlichen Dekors) bei den Planungen im Zentrum standen.\n\nin Moritz Baumstark and Robert Forkel (eds.), Historisierung. Begriff - Methode - Praxis, Stuttgart/Weimar : J.B. Metzler, forthcoming May 2016. This essay examines an important transformation in public history in relation to two institutions, the British Museum in London and the Neue Museum in Berlin and their identity as collections and monuments in their own right . In an analysis of the crisis of the commemorative monument in contemporary Germany James E. Young recognizes the continued desire for a form of monumentality, observing a general move from the heroic to the ironic as “the need for a unified vision of the past, as found in the traditional monument, necessarily collides with the modern conviction that neither the past nor its meanings are ever just one thing.” To what extent can a similar shift be observed as these museums construct institutional memory and how does this contribute to “institutional survival” , to renewing their mandate to preserve and to be themselves preserved and transmitted for the benefit of future generations? When we consider the British Museum and the Neue Museum as representative models of the ‘universal museums’ of the first museum age , it follows that it is significant to see how, in today’s ‘second museum age’, both of these museums have incorporated specific representations of their institutional past into the partial or full renovation of their houses . The Enlightenment gallery at the British Museum reveals how artefacts relating to a former ‘order of things’ have been used to produce an overarching vision of the museum’s initial encyclopaedic project. The case of the Neue Museum, whose newly renovated building can be seen as an exhibit in itself , is considered from the point of view of the remains of the historicist murals created in the 1850s and 1860s and the meaning of their role in a ‘new’ (2009) museum narrative.\n\nReshaping Museum Spaces: Architecture, Design, Exhibitions is a book edited by Suzanne MacLeod, emerged out of a conference held at the University of Leicester in April 2004. The book is composed of seventeen chapters, written by different authors, which are divided in four sections that would like to lead to one idea: how come museums had such a radical reshaping in the recent years. Each author explains, with some examples, his own opinion about what are the most evident reasons of these changes, both on the architectural (inside and outside), social and cultural aspects. The authors keep questioning what kind of types the new museum spaces are required, and highlighting a range of possibilities for creative museum design. The authors reflect about the complexity, significance and malleability of museum space, which is always open to change. In the recent years, while museums became consciously «recognized as drivers for social and economic regeneration, the architecture of the museum has developed from its traditional forms into often-spectacular one-off statements and architectural visions». Unfortunately, the most highlighted example of this phenomenon, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao designed by Frank O. Gehry, that succeededto transform a provincial city in Spain into a touristic destination, isn’t explained enough but only mentioned as the «Bilbao Effect» (known as the power of iconic architecture to place a city on the cultural map). Also other iconic museum architectures such as Berlin’s Jewish Museum or Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati are absent. In parallel, Suzanne MacLeod and the other authors try to analyze the reciprocal relationship between construed and curated space, or in other words, between museum building, exhibition and exposed objects. The difference of approaches about the book’s topics result as a mix of descriptions; in certain cases the description is structured by the author’s opinion on a specific topic (architecture or exhibition) lead by some examples. In other cases the authors choose to give only a detailed description of one/two museums and their exhibition, in order to touch both arguments (architecture and exhibition) which results more complicated to understand. I think that an interesting result of this book stays on the comparison between the different opinions on the same topics, and in this way I try to compose this summary. I followed the book four sections, trying, from one hand, to bring all author’s viewpoints, and from the other hand to have a logical connection between the different parts, considering also my own position and adding some comments from other books.\n\nThe Gesamtkunstwerk - the \"total artwork\" conceived by the composer Richard Wagner in the mid nineteenth century - challenges traditional conceptions of modernism. A synthetic, multimedia entity, the Gesamtkunstwerk clashes with the autonomy and medium specificity extolled by such modern critics as Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried. Moreover, assailed by Friedrich Nietzsche in the late nineteenth century and later embraced by Adolf Hitler, Wagner and his dream of a total work of art were dealt a series of critical blows. Most devastating was the critique delivered by Theodor Adorno who excoriated the composer’s theories as little more than fascism avant la lettre. What then should we make of artists' engagement with forms of the total artwork during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century? More specifically: What is the meaning of Gesamtkunstwerk’s influence on the interiors of some well-known collector’s houses that were conceived around the same time? This paper examines adaptations of Wagner's project in collector’s houses attending to both their aesthetic and political dimensions. Examples include decorative programs, art installations, architectural ensembles, and collaborative practices in Europe and the United States. It will address the contemporary critique that Gesamtkunstwerk’s attempt to bringing artistic media together into a total work of art is dated in our post-modern, post-media contemporary art world. For others, the problem is even worse: Wagner’s Gesamtkunstwerk is forever compromised by totality’s fateful historical entwinement with totalitarianism. Ours, however, is an era of “clashing civilizations” in which artists and theoreticians struggle with renewed urgency to imagine what a non-hegemonic, open-ended universalism—or totality—might be. This paper sets out to explore the opportunities and challenges of the modern Gesamtkunstwerk for historic house museums today, arguing for a more nuanced view that testifies to Gesamtkunstwerk’s revolutionary origins and potential for change."
