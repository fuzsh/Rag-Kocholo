        "text": "Many museums will offer free admission during less-than-ideal times: say, Thursday mornings or the first Sunday of every month.\n\nNot the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. Every Saturday and Wednesday, admission is free.\n\nThe rest of the week, general admission for the ongoing collection is just € 5,50. Special exhibits and quarterly Art Nights cost more; ages up to 12 are free; ages under 20 are €1. More on pricing here.)\n\nThe museum is made up of three buildings: Alte Staatsgalerie (opened in 1843), N eue Staatsgalerie (1984), and a five-story addition to the Alte Staatsgalerie (2002).\n\nThis post is just a taste of the Neue Staatsgalerie. (It will be expanded in the future.)\n\nYou’ll encounter rooms with exquisite religious paintings from the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. Lots of panels from alters and a few large triptychs.\n\nLook for a rare painting by Antonio Leonelli Da Crevalcore with a goldfinch in the bottom right corner. He apparently used the bird in lieu of his signature on some paintings.\n\nMax Beckmann, a 20th century German painter, has several works on display amidst the string of rooms with religious art. Most in this room have wide brush strokes, thick black outlines of people and objects, angular faces with dark hollowed eyes. Those particular works bring to mind Picasso a bit.\n\nLook for a lone terracotta piece by Beckmann called “Adam und Eve” from 1936. Apparently, it’s the only known surviving terracotta work by Beckmann. Adam is maybe 2 or 3 feet tall, sitting upright on a block, holding a small Eve, her head bowed, in the palm of his right hand. A snake head peers over his right shoulder, wrapping its slithery self down his back, through his legs, and around the block.\n\nThe museum insights on the wall plaques about each work are better than average. Instead of just listing the artist’s name, art title, year, and medium, the blurbs extend to more of an explanation of where the artist was or what the artwork might represent. For example, “Adam und Eve” ‘s info block includes: “This novel treatment of the subject combines the motif of the Creation with that of the Fall of Man in the shape of an inverted masculine Madonna and Child.” Ah. I can see that now.\n\nRembrandt has a few pieces as well, all dim to dark. In “Saint Paul in Prison,” the elderly saint looks befuddled, his lost eyes staring out from his gray bearded face. In “Tobias Healing his Father,” a man performs a cataract procedure on his old father, an operation apparently not incredibly rare in Rembrandt’s time, while the Archangel Raphael watches overhead. And there is one possible self-portrait, though the informative sign reports that some scholars think Rembrandt might have just instructed his students to paint him in his own style, a handy way for him to get out of painting his own visage!\n\nStaatsgalerie Stuttgart\n\nHours:\n\n10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday, Friday-Sunday\n\n10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday & Thursday\n\nClosed on Mondays\n\nAdmission:\n\n4€-5,50€ for the regular collection\n\n7€-10€ for special collections\n\nFree on Wednesdays and Sundays\n\nDirections:\n\nThe museum is an easy stroll from the main train station (the Hauptbahnhof). You can take the S-Bahn to the Hauptbahnhof from any line, the U-Bahn (light-rail: U1, U2, U4, U9, U14 lines), or a bus (lines 40, 42, or 43).\n\nThe museum is very close to the Schlossplatz, the main square in downtown Stuttgart. One side of the Schlossplatz is the Königstraße, a mall-like pedestrian walkway filled with shops. Go to the other side of the Schlossplatz, to the Staatstheater. To the right of the Staatstheater, you’ll see an underground walkway so you can cross the very busy street. Once you emerge, now behind the Staatstheater, you’ll see an enormous complex in front of you. Part will be curvy with green stripes, as shown at the top of this page — that’s the Neue Staatsgalerie!"
