        "text": "James Stirlingâ€™s death in 1992 cut short the fruitful later phase of a creative career which began in the 1950s. Stirling inaugurated this second phase in the 1970s with his ambitious urban-planning proposals for the area of the Cathedral and the Wailraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne. In 1975 he established his main London office in partnership with Michael Wilford. International recognition resulted in many spectacular commissions for the team, consolidating their reputation and their influence on a younger generation of architects. This is a retrospective documentation of their achievement. Critical appraisals, technical data and extensive illustrations record many important buildings, including the Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart; the Science Centre in Berlin; the Clore Gallery for the Turner Collection at the Tate Gallery, London; and the Performing Arts Center at Cornell University, New York State."
