What prompted them to do so? What did these earliest works of art look like? Every history of art must begin with these ques-\n\ntions—and with the admission that we cannot answer them. Our earliest ancestors began to walk the earth on two feet about four million years ago, but how they were using their hands remains unknown to us. More than two million years later we meet the earliest evidence of toolmaking. Humans must have been using tools all along. After all, even apes will pick up a stick to knock down a banana or a stone to throw at an enemy. The making of tools is a more complex matter. It demands first of all the ability to think of sticks or stones as \"fruit knockers\" or \"bone crackers,\" not only when they are needed for such purposes but at other times as well.\n\nOnce people were\n\ndo that, they some sucks or stones had a handier shape than others, and they put them aside for future use. They graduallv\n\ndiscovered\n\nable to that\n\nand \"appointed\" certain sticks or begun to connect form and function. The sticks, of course, have not survived, but a few of the stones have. They are large pebbles or chunks of rock that show the marks of repeated use for the same operation — whatever that may have been. The next step was to try chipping away\n\nselected\n\nstones as tools because thev had\n\nthese tools-by-appointment so as to improve their shape. This is the first craft of which we have evidence, and with it we enter\n\nat\n\na phase of\n\nhuman development known\n\nPaleolithic, or\n\nOld Stone Age.\n\nas the\n\nDuring the last stage of the Paleolithic, which began about 35,000 years ago, we meet the earliest works of art known to us. But these already show an assurance and refinement far removed from any humble beginnings. Unless\n\nwe\n\nare to believe that they\n\ncame\n\ninto\n\nbeing in a single, sudden burst, we must\n\nsume\n\nas-\n\nwere preceded by thousands of years of slow growth about which we know nothing at all. At that time the last Ice Age was drawing to a close in Europe (there had been at least three previous ones, alternating with periods of subtropical warmth, at intervals of about 25,000 years), and the climate between the Alps and Scandinavia resembled that they\n\nthat of present-day Siberia or Alaska.\n\nHuge\n\nherds of reindeer and other large herbivores\n\nroamed the plains and valleys, preyed upon by the ferocious ancestors of today's lions and tigers— and by our own ancestors. These people liked to live in caves or in the shelter of overhanging rocks wherever they could find them. Many such sites have been discovered, mosdy in Spain and in southwestern France. On the basis of differences among the tools and other remains found there, scholars have divided the \"cave dwellers\" into several groups, each named after a characteristic site, and of these it is especially the socalled Aurignacians and Magdalenians who stand out for the gifted artists they produced and for the important role art must have played in their\n\nThe most\n\nlives.\n\nstriking\n\nworks of\n\nPaleolithic art\n\nare the images of animals incised, painted, or sculpted on the rock surfaces of caves, such as\n\nPREHISTORIC AND ETHNOGRAPHIC ART\n\n18.\n\nWounded\n\nBison.\n\nCave painting,\n\nc.\n\n15,000—10,000\n\nB.C.\n\nin\n\nAltamira in northern Spain (fig. 18).

And how did it happen to survive intact over so many thousands of years? The last question can be answered easily enough — for the pictures never occur near the mouth of a cave, where they would be open to easy view (and destruction), but only in the darkest recesses, as far from the entrance as possible. Some can be reached only by crawling on hands and knees, and the\n\npath\n\nis\n\nso intricate that\n\none would soon be lost The cave at Lascaux\n\nwithout an expert guide.\n\nhaps to ensure a successful hunt. this\n\nWe\n\ngather\n\nnot only from their secret location and\n\nfrom the\n\nlines\n\nmeant\n\nto represent spears or\n\ndarts that are sometimes\n\nfound pointing\n\nat\n\nthe animals, but also from the peculiar, disor-\n\nway the images are superimposed on as in our example (fig. 19). Apparently, people of the Old Stone Age made no clear distinction between image and reality. By making a picture of an animal they meant to bring the animal itself within their grasp, and in \"killing\" the image they thought they had killed the animal's vital spirit.

Some of the cave pictures may even provide a clue to the origin of this tradition of fertility magic. In a good many instances, the shape of the animal seems to have been suggested by the natural formation of the rock, so that its body coincides with a bump or its contour follows a vein or crack as far as possible. We all know how our imagination sometimes makes us see all sorts of images in chance formations such as clouds or blots. A Stone Age hunter, his mind filled with thoughts of the big game on which he depended for survival, would have been even more likely to recognize such animals as he stared at the rock surfaces of his cave and to attribute deep significance to his discovery.

Next to the valley temple of the Pyramid of Chefren stands the Great Sphinx carved from the live rock (fig. 34), perhaps an even more impressive embodiment of divine kingship than the pyramids themselves. The roval head rising from the body of a lion towers to a height of sixty-five feet and once bore, in all probability, the features of Chefren (damage inflicted upon it during Islamic times has obscured the details of the face).

The Middle Ages, in such a review of climactic achievements, would be represented\n\nafter the death of\n\nby a Gothic cathedral — Notre-Dame in Paris, perhaps, or Chartres, or Salisbury. We have many to choose from, but whichever one we pick, it will be well north of the Alps, al-\n\nthough\n\nin territory that\n\nformerly belonged to\n\nRoman Empire. And if we were to spill a bucket of water in front of the cathedral of our choice, this water would eventually make the\n\nway\n\nChannel, rather than to the Mediterranean. Here, then, we have the most important single fact about the Middle Ages: the center of gravity of European civilization has shifted to what had been the northern boundaries of the Roman world. The Mediterranean, for so many centuries the great highway of commercial and cultural exchange binding together all the lands along its shores, has become a barrier, a border its\n\nto the English\n\nzone.\n\nWe\n\nhave already observed some of the\n\nevents that paved the way for this shift\n\n— the\n\nremoval of the imperial capital to Constantinople, the growing split between the Catholic and Orthodox faiths, the decay of the western half of the Roman Empire under the impact of invasions by Germanic these tribes, once they\n\nhad\n\ntribes.\n\nYet\n\nsettled in their\n\nnew environment, accepted the framework of late Roman, Christian civilization, however kingdoms they founded North Africa, the Visigoths\n\nimperfectly; the local\n\n—the Vandals in Spain, the\n\nin\n\nFranks in Gaul, the Ostrogoths in Italy— were all Mediterra-\n\nMohammed,\n\ntheir conquests.\n\nwould be\n\nIt\n\ndifficult to\n\nexaggerate the im-\n\npact of the lightninglike advance of Islam on the Christian world.\n\ndeprived of\n\nhad\n\nits\n\nThe Byzantine Empire,\n\nwestern Mediterranean bases,\n\nto concentrate all\n\nits\n\nIslam at bay in the East.\n\nWest (where foothold on\n\nit\n\non keeping impotence in the\n\nefforts\n\nIts\n\nretained only a precarious\n\nItalian soil) left the\n\nEuropean\n\nshore of the western Mediterranean, from the\n\nPyrenees to Naples, exposed to Arabic raidfrom North Africa or Spain. Western Eu-\n\ners\n\nrope was thus forced to develop its own resources, political, economic, and spiritual. The Church in Rome broke its last ties with the East and turned for support to the Germanic north, where the Frankish kingdom, under the energetic leadership of the Carolingian dynasty, rose to the status of imperial\n\npower during the eighth century.\n\nWhen the\n\ntitle\n\nthe pope, in the year 800, bestowed\n\nof emperor upon Charlemagne, he\n\nsolemnized the new order of things by placing himself and all of Western Christianity\n\nunder the protection of the king of theFranks and Lombards. He did not, however, subordinate himself to the newly created\n\nemperor, whose legitimacy depended on the pope, whereas hitherto it had been the other way around (the emperor in Constantinople had formerly ratified the Catholic\n\nnewly elected pope). This interdependent duand political authority, of\n\nand Lombards\n\nalism of spiritual\n\nnean-oriented, provincial states on the pe-\n\nChurch and State, was to distinguish the West from both the Orthodox East and the Islamic South. Its outward symbol was the fact that though the emperor had to be crowned in Rome, he did not reside there; Charlemagne\n\nriphery of the Byzantine Empire, subject to military, commercial, and culAs late as 630, after the Byzantine armies had recovered Syria, Palestine, and Egypt from the Sassanid Persians, the reconquest of the lost Western provinces remained a serious possibility.
