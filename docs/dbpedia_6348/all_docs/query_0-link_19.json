James Stirling was a Scottish architect known for his postmodern style. He designed the New State Gallery Stuttgart in Germany in 1984. The design incorporated the sloping site by creating an architectural promenade that moved visitors through the museum. Stirling combined traditional materials like travertine and sandstone with colored industrial steel. He used color coding throughout the building to guide circulation. The central atrium bridges interior spaces and references traditional 19th century museum designs. The sloping site was treated as an opportunity, with levels made accessible by integrated ramps and stairs.",
