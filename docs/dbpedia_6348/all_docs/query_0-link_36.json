A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – 19th century – Eclecticism This architectural period is known as Eclecticism, when they were a plenty of different styles, mostly as revival historical movements. Eclecticism in architecture implies freedom on the part of the architect or client to choose among the styles of the past that seems to him appropriate. Eclecticism is a nineteenth style in which a single piece of work incorporates a mixture of elements from previous historical styles to create something that is new and original. Eclecticism was a “Copy cat era”, no originality. Two principal characteristics distinguish 19th-century architecture: - The use of a variety of historical styles (revival): Greek, Gothic; Classic: Baroque, etc. - The development of new materials and structural methods (Industrial Revolution, Tech. advances, first skyscrapers).

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism vs. Modernity vs. Modern Architecture Modernity means present, or current, implying as its opposite the notion of earlier, of what is past. A second meaning of Modernity is the new, as opposed to the old. Whenever the term modern or contemporary is applied to anything, it refers to something that belongs to the current time. However, when one speaks of \"Modern Architecture\" and \"Contemporary Architecture\", one is speaking of a whole century of varied and diverse expressions: - Modern Architecture for the End of 19th to the 20th Century, and - Contemporary Architecture for the end of the 20th to 21st Century, therefore when we see all kinds of the architectural expression as current.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements Modernism – Context There’re multiple lenses through which the evolution of modern architecture may be viewed. Some historians see it as a social matter, closely tied/related to the project of Modernity and thus the Enlightenment. Modern architecture developed, as a result of social and political revolutions. Others see Modern architecture as primarily driven by technological and engineering developments. Still other historians regard Modernism as a matter of taste, a reaction against eclecticism and the lavish stylistic excesses of Revival architecture styles. With the Industrial Revolution, the availability of newly-available building materials such as iron, steel, and sheet glass drove the invention of new building techniques.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – The Arts & Crafts Movement • William MORRIS (1834-1896), in England (GBR), as the “Father” of the Movement. As a pioneer and multifaceted, he claimed from the Arts & Crafts movement the connection of the pure beauty of art with the utilitarian beauty of crafts. • Charles Rennie MACKINTOSH (1868-1928), in Scotland (GBR). Architect, designer and water-colourist, he was one of the most prominent representatives of the Arts & Crafts Movement and the greatest exponent of art nouveau in Scotland. Its abstract floral motifs have embellished all kinds of objects in art, fashion, cinema, etc. • Charles Summer GREENE (1868-1957) & Henry Mather GREENE (1870-1954), in USA.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – The Arts & Crafts Movement William MORRIS (1834-1896) In the second half of the 19th century, several artists began to worry about the decline/fall of artistic standards in manufactured products because trained/skilled designers were not involved in the creation of such products. The leader of this group in England was William MORRIS. He founded a company (1862) establishing workshops where artist-artisans created all kinds of products using artisan techniques.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – The Arts & Crafts Movement The philosophy behind the Arts and Crafts movement believed that the industrial revolution had made man less creative as ‘his’ craft skills had been removed from the manufacturing process. One aim of the movement was to put ‘man’ back in to the design and manufacturing process, Craft skills and good honest design would again be central to the manufacturing process.

He was a gifted designer whose architectural career was brief. His buildings tend to have bold massing deftly composed, with light and airy interiors. The Glasgow School of Art (1897-1909) was MACKINTOSH's first and largest commission. The picture shows the main façade on Renfrew Street.

Members included architects as Peter BEHRENS (1868-1940), Theodor FISCHER (1862-1938), Joseph Maria OLBRICH (1867-1908), Bruno PAUL (1874-1968), Richard RIEMERSCHMID (1868-1957), or Heinrich TESSENOW (1876-1950). It was a German organization formed by artists and architects, founded in 1907, precursor of the BAUHAUS. Its goal was to integrate traditional trades with industrial techniques of mass production.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Art Nouveau Art Nouveau is a late 19th and early 20th century aesthetic movement inspired by the natural world that produced a highly expressive style of architecture, interior design, furniture, décor, glasswork, jewelry, and visual arts. They introduced new styles of decoration, based on vegetal and floral forms. Art Nouveau included The Vienna Seccesion, The Catalan Modernism; Art Deco, and other Neo-classic styles. Famous architects were Antoni GAUDÍ (1852 – 1926); Paul HANKAR (1859 – 1901); Victor HORTA (1861 – 1947); Hector GUIMARD (1867 – 1942); or Mikhail EISENSTEIN (1867 – 1920).

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Art Nouveau – The Vienna Secession The Vienna Secession (1897) was the name given to the group of artists, architects and designers that broke away from the main establishment of Viennese artists to form their own group. Like Art Nouveau, the style of the Vienna Secession often utilized whiplash curves and floral motifs. It took influence from the Arts & Crafts movement and utilized similar organic ornamental designs as Jugendstil. They embraced geometry and abstract elements, including within architectural design. Notable architects of the Vienna Secession included Josef HOFFMANN, Koloman MOSER, Carl MOLL, Joseph M. OLBRICH, Otto WAGNER, and Gustav KLIMT.

Conceived architecture as a form of sculpture; had no straight lines; it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Art Nouveau – Catalan Modernism Antoni GAUDÍ is best known for working at the forefront of the Modernism movement in the 19th and 20th century. Deriving inspiration from the popular neo-Gothic and organic styles of the time, the Spanish architect is behind some of Barcelona's most iconic structures, such as The Sagrada Familia cathedral, Guell Park , Casa Vicens, Casa Batllo, and Casa Milà. Outside Catalonia, he built others as El Capricho, or Casa Botines. His architecture brought both constructional and functional innovations, including biomimicry, the use of hyperbolic paraboloid vaults, the use of inverted scale models of the proposed structures, integration of iron and reinforcement of concrete into construction, a way of designing ceramic mosaics from waste pieces, a new technique for stained glass, etc. I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n33.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Art Nouveau – Art Deco Art Deco, is an eclectic artistic & design style that began in Paris in the 1920s and flourished internationally throughout the 1930s and into the World War II era. • The style influenced all areas of design, including architecture & interior design, industrial design, fashion, jewellery, painting, graphic arts, and film. • Art Deco is characterized by use of materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, lacquer, Bakelite, Chrome and inlaid wood. • The use of stepped forms and geometric curves (unlike the sinuous, natural curves of Art Nouveau), chevron patterns, ziggurat- shapes, fountains, and the sunburst motif are typical of Art Deco. • Art Deco buildings have a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary façade of Art Deco buildings often feature a series of setbacks that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, or along roof edges.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism At the beginning of the 20th century, the pioneers of \"Modern Architecture\" attempted a radical change with the tradition of Eclecticism and the divergence of architectural styles in vogue at the end of the 19th century, such as \"Art Nouveau\", \"Catalan Modernism\", etc., which were characterized by the search for different manifestations, some emanating from the industrial revolution, the use of wavy lines, decoration based on organic elements, mainly vegetables, etc., others (like the \"Arts & Crafts\") that wanted a return to crafts.

(without memory, asymmetric and abstract). This new aesthetic was basically based on the rational use of new materials (as concrete, laminated steel and flat glass in large openings) and technology.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements Modernism – Characteristics Common themes of modern architecture include: - The notion that \"Form follows function\", a dictum originally expressed by Frank Lloyd Wright's early mentor Louis Sullivan, meaning that the result of design should derive directly from its purpose - Simplicity and clarity of forms and elimination of \"unnecessary detail“ - Materials at 90 degrees to each other - Visual expression of structure (as opposed to the hiding of structural elements) - The related concept of \"Truth to materials\", meaning that the true nature or natural appearance of a material ought to be seen rather than concealed or altered to represent something else - Use of industrially-produced materials; adoption of the machine aesthetic - Particularly in International Style modernism, a visual emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism – Cubism Cubism & Architecture • The main idea behind cubism is to show the essence of an object by displaying it from many angles and points of views at the same time. Buildings have clean lines, ensuring that the building is viewed in perspective with ease. • Architectural interest in Cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of 3-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes. • Simplicity is often the main and principal characteristic. • The subjects were represented in the form of basic geometric shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder and cone), and design, often a cuboid shape. • Diverse elements could be super-imposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. • Cubism led to simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass. • Cubism colors were almost monochromatic dominated by grays and browns. Only one or maybe two colors dominate the design. • Cubist buildings are often designed to be manufactured as prefabricated buildings and moved from the factory to the building site where they are assembled. • The windows have a cube/rectangular form and do not necessarily line up with each other, as in traditional/conventional buildings.

It was closed on 1934 by nazis. Its foundation occurred as a consequence of the crises of modern thought and technical rationality in Europe, particularly in Germany. Its creation was due to the confluence of political, social, educational and artistic development in the first decades of the 20th century, influenced by the intellectual vanguards of the time.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism The BAUHAUS The history of the BAUHAUS unfolds in 4 stages: 1. Foundation: From 1919 to 1923, with Walter GROPIUS as director, an era defined as idealistic and romantic; 2. From 1923 to 1927, much more rationalist; 3. From 1927 to 1930, directed by Hannes MEYER, reaching its greatest recognition, coinciding with his move from Weimar to Dessau, and; 4.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism The BAUHAUS (RATIONALISM) The Bauhaus Building (Dessau, Germany. 1925-1926), by Walter GROPIUS. The BAUHAUS established the normative bases and design patterns, establishing the academic foundations of Modern Architecture, incorporating a new aesthetic.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism The BAUHAUS The Bauhaus Building by Walter GROPIUS, is the most emblematic of the BAUHAUS, it is considered the masterpiece of Rationalism. The building is developed in several volumes, independent from each other and designed according to the function for which they were conceived. This has a configuration related to the conditions of its environment, and with its glass facades the building integrates to the rhythm of outdoor urban life.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism The most important modernist movement was: Functionalism: The concept “Functionalism” is inseparable from Modern Architecture At the beginning of the 20th century, architect Louis SULLIVAN established the motto “form follows function.” The functionalist current in Architecture is based on the fact that the design of a building should be based on its function, that is, if the functional aspects are satisfied and done, architectural beauty will born naturally.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism Functionalism: • Concern about inventions. Produce faster and/or better work. • Technology applies all the knowledge of architecture. LE CORBUSIER and the machine for living led him to propose the Five Points for a new Architecture: • Building that rests on pilotis (columns) on the ground floor, leaving the surface mostly free to allow the landscape to remain autonomous from the building. • Flat roof, on which a garden is located (Roof Garden) • Free indoor spaces (free plan), due to the structure based on pillars/columns and partitions. • Facade free of structural elements, so that it can be designed without conditions. • Large elongated windows on the facades to achieve abundant natural lighting inside (Ribbon Windows) I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n65.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism Constructivism (Russia) Constructivist architecture is characterised by a combination of modern technology (soviet futurism), engineering methods and the socio-political ethos of Communism. Despite there being few realised projects before the movement became outdated in the mid-1930s, it has had a definite influence on many subsequent architectural movements, such as Brutalism. It was parallel to Neo-plasticism and Bauhaus, but in Russia and, by extensión, to entire Soviet Union. I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n78.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism The International Style (Internationalism) In 1930s, discussions began about the absence of ornamentation and symbolism of Functionalism. This is when the International Style appears, which is the set of architectural trends that share the most purist formal characteristics of the Modern Movement and, to a lesser extent, the Functionalist ones. The term was consolidated in 1932 with the International Expo. of Modern Architecture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, organized by Henry- Russell HITCHCOCK and Philip JOHNSON.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Modernism The International Style (Internationalism) Features of the international style: • Emphasis on volume over mass. • Encouraged the use of lightweight materials. • Use of simple, clean and repetitive forms with flat surfaces. • Glass and steel became major building materials as a source of development. • Right proportions. The international style made architects rethink the idea of architecture and encouraged newer perspectives to designing a space. It is a movement slightly different from modernism but closely related to it. The style, which is actually a subset of modern style that Rejected the use of sophisticated ornamentation and bright colors. The early skyscrapers which came up around the 1920s are a consequence of the International style. I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n83.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements – Late Modernism Mid-century Style Midcentury-Modern (MCM) Architecture After the pre-rationalist movements (Cubism, Expressionism, Neoplasticism, Organicism, etc.) and the Bauhaus (rationalist), all of them included in the Modernism, and after World War II (WWII), raised an architectural movement called Mid-century style (late 1940s, early 1950s). However, some authors indicate the beginning of the Mid-century style in the early 1930s as a combination of Organicism, Rationalism and Technology. Actually, this was the continuity of rationalism through the International Style, to which was added the technological advances during the War, as well as the new socio-economic needs (housing) of the new world order, especially in USA and, less in Europe.

Functionality, in general, as a rationalist style: A Functional Architecture is an architectural model that identifies system function and their interactions. It defines how the functions will operate together to perform the system mission(s). A function in this context has three parts: - An input that flows into the function; - The function itself that processes the input, and - An output that flows from the function.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements Deconstructivism Deconstructivism in architecture, also called deconstruction, is a development of Postmodernism that began in the late 1980s. It is characterized by the following: - Ideas of fragmentation - Interest in manipulating ideas of a structure's surface or skin - Non-rectilinear shapes which serve to distort and dislocate some of the elements of architecture, such as structure, and - The finished visual appearance of buildings that exhibit the many deconstructivism \"styles\" is characterized by a stimulating unpredictability and a controlled chaos. It was influenced by the formal experimentation and geometric imbalances of Russian Constructivism. There are additional references in deconstructivist to 20th century movements: the modernism/postmodernism, expressionism, cubism , minimalism, etc. I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n139.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements Regional Criticism/Critical Regionalism Why modern buildings look the same?: - Modern become commonplace - Modern is low maintenance - Customers want reliable styles - Consistent mean cost-efficiency “Most of the buildings you see have not been designed by architects but by construction companies and civil engineers in search of rationality and profitability, forgetting any local context and aesthetic purpose”.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements Regional Criticism/Critical Regionalism Critical Regionalism is an approach to architecture that strives to counteract the placelessness and identitylessness of the International Style (late Modernism). but it also rejects the random individualism and ornamentation of postmodern architecture. Therefore, it is not a style, rather an approach towards the process of design thinking, that appeared during late 1970s. They seek to provide friendly architecture in the modern tradition, but linked to the geographical, historical and cultural context. Critical Regionalism is not simply vernacular regionalism. It is an approach to design that seeks to relate local language to global language. Regionalist Critics therefore argue that both modern and postmodern architecture are \"deeply problematic.\" I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n167. A Flash-back on Architectural Movements Regional Criticism/Critical Regionalism “The fundamental strategy of Critical Regionalism is to mediate the impact of universal civilization with elements derived indirectly from peculiarities of a particular place” “Necessarily involves a more directly dialectical relation with nature than the more abstract, formal traditions of modern avant-garde architecture allow\". “Architecture can only be sustained today as a critical practice if it assumes an ‘arriere-garde’ position, that is to say, one which describes itself equally from the Enlightenment myth of progress and from a reactionary, unrealistic impulse to return to the architechtonic forms of the preindustrial past. A critical ‘arriere- garde’ has to remove itself from both the optimisation of advanced technology and ever-present tendancy to regress into nostalgic historicism or the glibly decorated. It is my contention that only an ‘arriere-garde’ has the capacity to cultivate a resistant, identity-giving culture while at the same time having discreet recourse to universal technique.” FRAMPTON, Kenneth (1983) Towards a Critical Regionalism.

A Flash-back on Architectural Movements Blobitecture Blobitecture (Blob architecture, or Blobism) is a term for an after post-modern architectural style (1990s to nowadays) inspired by the advances in digital graphics and 3D shapes, even nature, and natural or organic forms like a living breathing organisms (blob or amoeba shapes), and predominantly seen in large buildings. Blobitecture buildings cannot exist without the help of design software unless we look at the building from a purely aesthetic point of view. This doesn’t mean, however, that every peculiar-looking building can be described as a blob-building. I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n197.

Advance materials Engineered materials that utilize fewer resources to develop, are sturdier, or offer better workability over conventional materials are desirable by the Arch. & Construction industry. High-performance materials improve the mechanical properties of structures while ensuring aesthetical appeal. Startups also offer innovative materials such as self-healing concrete, photovoltaic (PV) glass, bioplastics, carbon fiber, transparent aluminum or translucent wood, and dust-resistant nanocomposites. Further, startups manufacture greener alternatives to traditional materials with comparable qualities such as low-carbon steel, engineered wood, and bio-based materials. These sustainable materials feature high durability, thermal insulation, recyclability, and endurance to withstand high loads and extreme weather. They reduce the environmental impacts of construction without compromising structural performance. I g n a c i o J a v i e r P A L M A C A R A Z O A R C / C A D D / D A U / K S A\n\n213.

Energy-Efficiency Buildings, and Water-Efficiency Buildings Energy efficiency solutions in buildings and structures eliminate energy (heat or cool) loss as well as reduce energy and maintenance costs. Startups provide advanced heating/cooling, ventilation, and HVAC systems that optimize energy utilization and reduce the environmental impacts of buildings. They also deliver provisions for high-performance building envelopes, such as insulation and air barriers, that reduce energy losses and operating costs. Similarly, building management and automation solutions monitor existing systems such as HVAC and lighting, optimizing consumption. This significantly curtails maintenance costs while also retaining comfort for occupants. Architecture software for energy-efficient solutions promotes passive design strategies and provides building energy simulations to improve natural lighting and building ventilation.
