        "text": "Sir James Frazer Stirling (1926 – 1992) was a renowned British architect known for his innovative and influential designs in the mid-to-late 20th century. Throughout his career, Stirling gained prominence for his distinctive, modernist architectural style that incorporated bold use of color, geometric forms, and unconventional materials. Some of his most notable works include the Leicester University Engineering Building, the History Faculty Building at the University of Cambridge, and the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany. Stirling’s contributions to the field of architecture earned him numerous accolades, including the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1981."
