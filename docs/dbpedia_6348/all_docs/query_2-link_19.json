        "meta_description": "The post-modernist structure of the Neue Staatsgalerie is a work of art in itself. Designed by the award-winning architect James Stirling, the gallery was constructed in 1984 and remains a revered monument whose design has stimulated much discussion and debate. Blending together classicist and modernist elements, the edifice takes on an appearance that is playfully monumental. An open-air rotunda houses the sculpture garden and forms the centerpiece of the gallery. The remarkable facade gives way to one of the country's most significant collections of contemporary and modern art, featuring artwork by the likes of Picasso, Beuys, Kadinsky and Schlele. The Neue Staatsgalerie stands in contrast to the neo-classical building of the Old State Gallery, beckoning to art lovers from far and wide.",
