        "text": "Modern Architecture\n\nModern architecture, also known as modernist architecture, was an architectural movement or style that was based on cutting-edge construction techniques, particularly the use of glass, steel, and reinforced concrete, the principle that form should follow function (functionalism), an acceptance of minimalism, and a rejection of ornament.\n\nModern architecture is based on clear and uncomplicated principles. Its pervasive ideology adheres to the principle that form should always follow function. Modern architects thus express themselves through simplicity, unobscured views of structural components, and the avoidance of pointless design details.\n\nPioneers of Modern Architecture\n\nFour of the pioneer architects to date are Louis Kahn, Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Le Corbusier. Continue reading to learn more about the creative processes of these four forerunners of the modern period and why their works and methods continue to have an impact on contemporary culture.\n\nIconic Buildings\n\nThe Farnsworth House\n\nThe Glass House\n\nEames House\n\nNational Assembly Building\n\nFallingwater\n\nPost Modern Architecture\n\nPostmodernism is an eclectic, vibrant architectural and decorative art movement that began in the late 1970s and is still present in some form now. It was born out of opposition to Modernism, the Modern Movement, and the dogmas that accompanied it. Despite its democratic aims, Modernism started to come across as exclusive and elitist by the 1970s. In the early 1970s, architects and critics focused on the failure of construction techniques and materials (seen in the 1968 collapse of the tower block Ronan Point in east London) and alienating housing developments.\n\nPioneers of Post-Modern Architecture\n\nThe post-modern movement was introduced by the architect and urban planner Denise Scott Brown and architectural theorist Robert Venturi in their book Learning from Las Vegas. The style flourished from the 1980s through the 1990s, particularly in the work of Scott Brown & Venturi, Philip Johnson, Charles Moore and Michael Graves. In the late 1990s, it divided into a multitude of new tendencies, including high-tech architecture, neo-futurism, new classical architecture and deconstructivism. However, some buildings built after this period are still considered post-modern.\n\nIconic Post-modern Buildings\n\nThe Piazza d’Italia Public Plaza\n\nAT&T Building, 550 Madison Ave\n\nThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao\n\nSIS Building\n\nThe Neue Staatsgalerie\n\nVanna Venturi House\n\nNeofuturistic Architecture\n\nNeo-futuristic architectural design’s overall aesthetic can occasionally be interpreted as a rejection of pessimism and a reaching outward toward an optimistic vision of the future. Various architecture and product designs, including hotels, skyscrapers, and even park benches, have incorporated neofuturism. In many aspects, neo-futurism is a very innovative and thrilling aesthetic that frequently pushes the limits of more conventional architecture. Neo-futurism is still a fashion trend that expresses a strong excitement for technology and the space age.\n\nPioneers of Neofuturistic Architecture\n\nNumerous arcihtects have been motivated to innovate by neo-futurism, producing structures and complexes that showcase their skill and originality all over the world. Given that she received the renowned Pritzker Prize, Zaha Hadid may be regarded in certain quarters as one of the best neo-futuristic architects of all time. From the Glasgow Riverside Museum to the London Aquatics Centre, Hadid has created a number of futuristic structures.\n\nSantiago Calatrava started creating modern architecture while still a student who is famed for his brilliant white, sky-high creations, has enthralled the world with towering structural feats. His utilization of novel materials and clean, futuristic look have been characterized as being notably neo-Futurist.\n\nIconic Neofuturistic Buildings\n\nThe Heydar Aliyev cultural center in Baku, Azerbaijan, for example, features a fluid exterior with an overall structure that eliminates sharp angles. Its walls appear to flow continuously as if to resemble a wave spreading across the all-glass front of the building. Other examples of neofuturistic architecture below:"
