My thanks are due to the Martin Jones Awards assessors and the RIAS. Martin Jones himself was also a source of inspiration to me so I am grateful to him on two counts. In the early stages of my research my employers at the former British Museum Design Office under Margaret Hall granted me time off for travel and encouraged the project. The British Museum itself haunts this book. Chapter 6 is an amended version of an article originally published in the journal Inventory, vol. 2, no. 2. I would also like to thank the Arts and Humanities Research Council who funded research travel through Kingston University. Many individuals have helped during my work: Murray Grigor and Richard Murphy both impressed on me the importance of Scarpa’s Palazzo Abatellis; Leslie Dick was my host and guide on two visits to Los Angeles; David and Diana Wilson who generously invited me to stay in one of the trailers at the Museum of Jurassic Technology and who spent more hours than was reasonable discussing the museum with me; all the staff at the Museum of Jurassic Technology who were so patient with me during my stay; my old friend Jon Cairns proved to be an expert guide to the Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart on which he worked with James Stirling; Danielle Olsen, formerly of the Wellcome Trust, who suggested I should visit the Grant Museum of Zoology; Marketa Uhlirova who undertook picture research at short notice and hunted down images that seemed to be beyond reach; Jessica Cuthbert-Smith who copy-edited the book so expertly; and my editor, Philippa Brewster at I.B.Tauris, whose patience has been exemplary. I extend my gratitude to all of these people. Other colleagues and friends have read versions of the manuscript: Mel Gooding has read more than one draft and has been a source of\n\ndelirious-01 prelims.fm Page viii Thursday, July 5, 2007 10:11 AM\n\nVIII\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\ngreat encouragement to me; John Reeve, Joe Kerr and Peter Wollen also made useful suggestions and moved the project forward. In addition I would like to thank Dinah Casson, Jill Hughes, Andrea Easey, Neil Cummings, James Putnam, Jude Simmons and Bob Wilkinson. Fred Scott probably was not aware that he was helping with this book, but talking to him and teaching with him informed much of my treatment of architecture. I would also like to thank everyone who over more years than I care to think has asked me how the book was progressing; I hope my elaborate excuses for missing my deadlines at least provided some entertainment. Lastly, I want to thank Caroline Evans and our children Caitlin and Ivo who have brightened every day on which I was engaged on this work, no matter how far away I was. Without Caroline’s skills as a reader and critic this book would not have existed. Her belief in both the project and in me has made The Delirious Museum possible.\n\ndelirious-01 prelims.fm Page ix Thursday, July 5, 2007 10:11 AM\n\nFor my father, N ORMAN S TORRIE and in memory of my mother, M AR Y\n\ndelirious-01 prelims.fm Page x Thursday, July 5, 2007 10:11 AM\n\n1.

I like art works and institutions that escape any physical presence. Things you can carry in your mind or in your pockets. It’s not a matter of laziness or frustration: maybe it’s a form of asceticism. With an imaginary museum you can do whatever you want, you can think about it before falling asleep, or you can go out in the morning and build it from scratch. And if it doesn’t work, there is nothing to be ashamed of. You can always say that it was simply an exercise in loss. In the end, I just think there is a certain strength in being invisible. Maurizio Cattelan1\n\nThe title of this work has two sources. One source is an essay called ‘The Delirious Museum’, by David Mellor, in a book of photographs by David Ross.2 Mellor discusses the photographs in the context of two texts. The first of these is by Jacques Derrida and deals with the way in which the ‘frame’ insinuates itself into the view of the object. The second text discussed by Mellor is Theodor Adorno’s The Valéry-Proust Museum which examines how the spectator is drawn into an intimate relationship with the displayed object through the paraphernalia of the immediate museum environment. The second source for the title is Delirious New York by Rem Koolhaas. This is described by the author as a ‘retroactive manifesto for Manhattan’.3 Koolhaas’ book could also be seen as a selective, maverick history of New York. This book predates Koolhaas’ involvement with museum architecture and is a paean of praise to the urban condition exemplified by the ‘Downtown Athletic Club’ with its fictional representation of naked ‘metropolitan bachelors’ wearing boxing gloves and eating oysters. I first began to unearth the Delirious Museum in a conversation with colleagues some years ago. We were discussing the pros and\n\ndelirious-02 intro.fm Page 2 Thursday, October 6, 2005 1:22 PM\n\n2\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\ncons of museum admission charges. This is a discussion that for peculiar political and historical reasons might only occur in Britain. I am in favour of free admission to museums and I was then. At the time there was a split between museums in London over this issue; the British Museum, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery all had free entry; the ‘South Kensington’ museums: the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum, all charged for entry. I defended my position by saying that ‘museums should be a continuation of the street’. I did not mean that they should have to compete with the street in terms of their speed of communication or that they should appeal to passers-by in the same way as, say, a shop or a games arcade. Instead, I was suggesting that there should be ease of access to both building and collection that in effect integrates them into the life of the city. This premise has led me to look in more detail at the relationship between museum and city. In some ways any city is a Delirious Museum: a place overlaid with levels of history, a multiplicity of situations, events and objects open to countless interpretations. If there was a single starting point for this train of thought it would be Christopher Alexander’s essay from the 1960s, ‘A City is not a Tree’, in which he describes the city as a ‘semilattice’ of interconnections and overlaps.4 The Delirious Museum that I will examine has continuity with the street and it aspires to the condition of the city. What I want to do is to reclaim the museum on behalf of the city and vice versa. By shifting the perception of the collection and the container – for want of a better word, the ‘architecture’ – it is possible to re-evaluate the relationship between museum and city in terms of shared experience. Most cities have evolved over a long period of time and they have often done so with very little control. The museum, however, is traditionally associated with order and classification. ‘Neutral’ taxonomic systems have been used as a means of ‘clarification’ and education. Often this neutrality has meant limiting, either by accident or by design, the possible interpretations of the museum. I argue that it is possible to subvert this position. All museums carry within them the seed of their own delirium. To a greater or lesser degree they can be re-interpreted in terms of the breakdown of control and classification. This can happen in a number\n\ndelirious-02 intro.fm Page 3 Thursday, October 6, 2005 1:22 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\n•\n\n3\n\nof ways: an obsessive level of control can be self-subverting, while its opposite, a state of chaos, can up-end perceived notions of the museum. Messiness, category confusion, theatricality, elaborate historical layering and museological fictionalizing can, singly or in combination, go towards creating the Delirious Museum. It is as if some of the museums I describe are about to loose their grip on their contents and themselves. When asked by the curators of the Palais de Tokyo the question ‘What do you expect from an art institution in the 21st century?’ one participant said ‘Cheap, fast and out of control’.5 This description applies equally to the Delirious Museum and to the delirious city. In Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, Robert Venturi wrote: I am for messy vitality over obvious unity. I include the non-sequitur and proclaim the duality. I am for richness of meaning rather than clarity of meaning; for the implicit function as well as the explicit function. I prefer ‘both-and’ to ‘either-or’, black and white, and sometimes gray, to black or white.6\n\nThe Delirious Museum does not replace the museums that we know; it exists in parallel to the museum as it has evolved. It brings a new level of ‘messy vitality’ and ‘richness of meaning’ to the museum. I confess to an anxiety that the Delirious Museum cannot be made; that it can only be brought into existence retroactively and it is, in effect, a construction of nostalgia. Perhaps it is the re-realization of the museum that transforms it, that makes it delirious. Acknowledging this, I have tried to prove that the Delirious Museum can be designed and constructed. So my study moves from ‘history’ to contemporary architecture and back again. My own background is as an architect who designs exhibitions. I have worked in a number of the museums discussed, most notably the British Museum,7 so many of the observations made are based on an intimate knowledge of particular places. In creating exhibitions, I have been aware of the way these ephemeral events pass into the history of a place. I see the exhibitions I have designed as experiments where unpredictable ingredients are combined. Sometimes the result is quiet resolution and sometimes the consequences of the combination are explosive. By extension these experiments are part of the life of the city too.\n\ndelirious-02 intro.fm Page 4 Thursday, October 6, 2005 1:22 PM\n\n4\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nWhat is the Delirious Museum of the title? It is something both built and unbuilt. It inheres in certain buildings and museums, in some artworks, and some unplanned city spaces. The Delirious Museum is nebulous and slippery. It is a parasitical idea found in the fabric of cities, in urban practices and fragments, that is, in space. But you also find it in narratives, both in and out of time – in fictional fragments, in historical anecdote and near-forgotten detail. This book weaves together myths, histories and buildings. It tracks the Delirious Museum first as an idea that is embodied in several forms – chapters that are, respectively, a story, a theory, a laboratory, a collection and a walk. The idea of the Delirious Museum is ‘grown’ in the first six chapters, like a culture in a lab. In the Petri dish in the lab it looks very different from how it will appear later in the book, out there in the world, in the built environment. In the lab the microscope takes the familiar and magnifies it into the strange and mysterious. Yet once it does move out into the world, it is no less strange and mysterious, merely differently so. Subsequent chapters look at the Delirious Museum as architecture, not as a finished ‘thing’ but as a new mutation. Escaped from the lab, it settles into its new host, the building. There it mutates into several forms, all of which can go unnoticed – but, equally, can be perceived by the naked eye if you know where, or rather, how, to look. You need a different way of looking to access London of the 1800s, Paris of the 1840s, Las Vegas of the 1990s, and to tie these in with certain European artistic and architectural projects of the 20th and 21st centuries. You need historical knowledge and visual and conceptual acuity to see what is already there but that goes unnoticed, incognito, as if in a parallel universe. All the forms that constitute the Delirious Museum also determine the form of the book. It is neither pure architectural analysis, nor urbanism, nor history nor literature alone; instead it weaves these forms together. Perhaps the book itself is a Delirious Museum mimicking what it describes, for it is, among other things, a repository of anecdotes and arcane facts. It is my collection. If the Delirious Museum is first and foremost an idea, the second half of the book pursues the Delirious Museum from urbanism, image\n\ndelirious-02 intro.fm Page 5 Thursday, October 6, 2005 1:22 PM\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\n•\n\n5\n\nand idea into architecture. Key practitioners include Soane, Scarpa and Libeskind. But the idea escapes again, makes its own way, and scuttles into the New World of the late 20th century – the rampant capitalism of Las Vegas via the global art brands of Guggenheim and Getty. This is not so different from the origins of the Delirious Museum in other moments and places of rapidly expanding consumer culture: Soane’s London during the Industrial Revolution and mid19th-century Paris. The book suggests a historical moment in the development of capitalism and its offshoots after the Enlightenment as a conceptual framework for the context in which the Delirious Museum can lodge itself and grow in its various mutations – image, idea, architectural form, historical fragment, cemetery, department store, fiction, motel, museum, film or artwork. The Delirious Museum makes its way into the cracks and crevices of many aspects of commodity culture; there it lodges and grows in all its forms, in a parallel life but still dependent upon its ‘host’. The chapters are numbered in a conventional way but they can also be read as one might visit the rooms in a museum, visiting different collections of interest, doubling back, taking the shortest route or heading straight for a particular exhibit or the café (though I do not know which chapter that might be). I begin with a convulsive moment for Modernism, one of the events that make up the history of the Delirious Museum. In Chapters 2 and 3 I develop the ideas created in the preceding narrative in terms of a theoretical background. This is, in effect, my own ‘manifesto’ for the Delirious Museum and it will draw on a series of modernist views of the city: the flâneur, as identified by Baudelaire and theorized by Benjamin, Surrealism and the Situationists. Chapter 4 describes the ephemeral experiments of the early history of the Delirious Museum. Chapter 5 is a description of an imaginary museum devoted to the work of artists who worked or are working with the idea of the museum. Chapter 6 constructs, from existing fragments of a real city – London – an unstable and restless version of the Delirious Museum. Chapter 7 expands on the peculiarly interdependent relationship between the mausoleum and the museum, between the deathly and the displayed. Chapter 8 deals with the particular delirium induced by obsessive architectural (and curatorial) control as exhibited in\n\ndelirious-02 intro.fm Page 6 Thursday, October 6, 2005 1:22 PM\n\n6\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nthe work of Carlo Scarpa. The following chapter takes a broader view of the architecture of the museum in the 20th century. Chapter 10 is an examination of the work and ideas of Daniel Libeskind. Chapter 11 represents a geographical and historical shift to a relatively new city on the ‘Pacific Rim’, Los Angeles, and concentrates on two museums that exemplify separate museological tendencies. The first of these is the acropolis that is Richard Meier’s Getty Center. In contrast, the second, the Museum of Jurassic Technology, almost disappears behind a Culver City shopfront. The final chapter tentatively suggests a re-reading of the fantastic urbanism of Las Vegas in terms of the Delirious Museum; a place containing both ‘spectacle’ and ‘situation’ and where the museum exists alongside the museum’s antithesis.\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 7 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\n1\n\nT HE L OUVRE : A N A BSENCE\n\nOur civilization will leave to the future ages only its roundhouses and its railroad tracks. Scholars will perish trying to decipher the inscriptions. Guillaume Apollinaire to Max Jacob1\n\nThe snare So much starts at the Louvre. This place is where the private collection, the wunderkammer, was transformed into the public museum. Although the idea of making the collection and the building accessible was mooted before 1789, this proposal came to nothing. It took the modern convulsion of revolution to bring the museum into existence. Within a few days of the setting up of the revolutionary government in 1789 a decree was passed to open the palace to the public. This duly happened on the first anniversary of the creation of the Republic. At the core of the collection are the riches of the aristocracy and the loot of France’s imperial past. Baudelaire in his poem ‘The Swan’ speaks of seeing a confusion of bric-à-brac glittering through the windows of the Louvre, while outside in the street he watches the ridiculous wanderings of the creature escaped from a menagerie.2 In Zola’s novel L’Assomoir of 1876, the members of a wedding party, after much discussion about how to spend time on a rainy afternoon, take a walk round the museum en route from ceremony to banquet. Only one of the party has visited the Louvre before; the poverty of their lives has restricted them to a small geographical area around Barbès-Rochechouart. Inevitably, as those out of their class and out of their depth in Zola’s moral tale, the visitors get lost in the museum:\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 8 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\n8\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n‘Seized with alarm and despondency, they wandered aimlessly through galleries, still in crocodile behind Monsieur Madinier, now mopping his brow and beside himself with rage against the authorities, whom he accused of having changed the position of the doors. Attendants and visitors watched them go past and marvelled.’3 The museum, brought into being with the best of intentions, has already become both labyrinth and snare. In 1993 the American architect I. M. Pei completed the glass pyramid that now marks the entrance to the museum and to a subterranean shopping mall. The pyramid is the centre point of a redevelopment scheme called the Grand Louvre; it serves both as an entrance and as an organizational point for the whole complex, creating routes into the separate wings of the museum. The pyramid forms a hub that is meant to clarify the layout of the museum labyrinth. It is a comprehensible space that uses the architectural language, at its most luxurious, of the adjoining shopping mall. But the pyramid also has an inherent element of parody as befits an object created in the first flush of architectural post-modernism. Is it meant to reinforce the widely held view that all museums are tombs and that they are full of grave goods? Or is the intention to mock the imperial ambition, not just of Napoleon but of the Louvre itself? In its ghostly transparency it could even be read as parodying its own architectural antecedent. The pyramids of Egypt were meant to be impenetrable, not spaces at all but solid geometric artefacts. Even this architectural spectre has international influence: it is seen as a prototype for the re-organization of unruly national collections and their buildings. The British Museum in the creation of its Great Court has a similar ambition. A by-product of the pyramid is the way in which it has become possible to visit the Louvre without visiting the museum of the same name. The institution is thus magnified and made more pervasive in the minds of visitors. Simultaneously, the Louvre is made diffuse and colonises sections of the city intended for other activities. Some years before the construction of the pyramid, the Louvre colonized other bits of city such as the Metro station Louvre Rivoli. The platforms of the station were occupied by vitrines containing plaster copies of the artefacts. The walls, dressed in stone, featured niches within which could be glimpsed life-size photographs of exhibits. Today, in the tra-\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 9 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\nT H E\n\nL O U V R E\n\n•\n\n9\n\ndition of out-moded and neglected museum display, the contents of the vitrines are looking faded and tired.\n\nThe space Zola identified the seed of delirium in the labyrinth of the 19thcentury Louvre but it was not until 1911 that this delirium took root in the museum. Not only is the Louvre among the first public museums, but it is one of the biggest and it contains artefacts with the status of cultural icons. The Venus de Milo and ‘Mona Lisa’ are, perhaps, the two most famous museum exhibits in the world. The fame of the latter was enhanced by its disappearance for two years. On the morning of 22 August 1911, the painter Louis Béroud entered the Salon Carré in order to make some sketches for a satirical painting of the recently glazed ‘Mona Lisa’. He intended to show a fashionable Parisienne arranging her hair in the reflecting mirror of the glazed painting. Where the painting should have been there was a gap. The attendant suggested that the painting had been removed for photography. On investigation it emerged that ‘Mona Lisa’ was not in the photography studio and when the curator of the department of Egyptian Antiquities initiated a search it could not be found elsewhere in the building. By midday the police had sealed off the museum, allowing visitors out one by one. Eventually the glass and frame of the painting were discovered in a small access staircase but there was no trace of the painting itself.\n\nApollinaire imprisoned In the end you are tired of that world of antiquity O Eiffel Tower shepherdess the bridges this morning are a bleating flock You have had enough of living in Greek and Roman antiquity . . .4\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 10 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 11 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\n(above) 3.

The two main characters in this story, the artist Picasso and the poet Apollinaire, are bound up in the creation of modern art. There seems to be no agreed version of the events that preceded the arrest and imprisonment of Apollinaire. Opinions vary about the sequence of events surrounding the affair but they were certainly precipitated by the scandal not just of the theft of ‘Mona Lisa’ but of the ease with which it was taken from the gallery. Apollinaire’s friend and sometimes secretary, Géry Pieret, had a history of stealing from the Louvre. He had a number of histories: at the time of the scandal he was not long returned from the Klondike Gold Rush and was still sporting yellow chaps and a stetson around Paris. Apollinaire portrayed him as ‘Baron Ignace d’Ormesan’ in L’Hérésiarque et Cie. Pieret subsequently adopted this title as his pseudonym. In 1907 he had acquired two Iberian statuettes that he subsequently passed to Picasso. Whether Picasso knew of the origin of the pieces is uncertain, but some versions of the story suggest that Picasso was told by Pieret to keep the sculptures secret. When ‘Mona Lisa’ went missing, Pieret returned another piece of sculpture that he had also stolen from the Louvre to a newspaper office as a publicity stunt and, ostensibly, to attract attention to lax security at the museum. Apollinaire had already published an article in Paris-Journal on the same subject, saying: ‘The Louvre is less well protected than a Spanish Museum’.5 The sculpture that Pieret returned had sat on the mantelpiece of Apollinaire’s apartment during Pieret’s stay. Apollinaire, knowing of his friend’s actions, thought that Pieret might also have stolen the famous painting and became worried that the statuettes held by Picasso would also come to light. Picasso, the Spaniard, and Apollinaire, born in Rome, were both already exercised by the possibility of being deported as aliens, and then decided to dispose of the incriminating pieces by throwing them into the Seine. On the night they had planned to do this, Apollinaire and Picasso spent the evening playing cards ‘. . . while they sat waiting for the fatal moment when they would set out for the Seine – “the moment of the crime” – they had pretended to play cards all evening, doubtless in imitation of certain\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 13 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\nT H E\n\nL O U V R E\n\n•\n\n13\n\nbandits they had read about’.6 Eventually they set off with the stolen statuettes in a suitcase. After walking the streets of Paris for a large part of the evening they abandoned the plan. Perhaps they felt guilty about disposing of something so valuable or perhaps the opportunity to drop the pieces quietly into the river did not present itself. In most accounts it was Apollinaire who, the next morning, took the statuettes to the same newspaper office previously visited by Pieret.7 A promise of secrecy was extracted as to who had delivered the statuettes. But the following day the police came to search Apollinaire’s apartment, finding incriminating evidence regarding the Louvre statuettes. He was subsequently arrested for handling stolen property and for suspicion of involvement in the theft of ‘Mona Lisa’. A few days after the arrest of Apollinaire, Picasso was brought in by the police and under questioning he mysteriously denied that he even knew Apollinaire. Picasso was allowed to leave and was not charged. Apollinaire was eventually freed on a provisional basis and, after much agitation from influential friends, charges were dropped. But he was affected by his time in prison and although he and Picasso did not fall out, their friendship cooled. In his poem ‘Zone’ Apollinaire wrote: Now you are in Paris at the examining magistrate’s They have placed you under arrest like a criminal8\n\nIn L’Antitradition Futuriste, a ‘Manifeste-synthèse’ issued in Milan on 29 June 1913 in support of the Italian Futurists, Apollinaire offered a ‘Rose’ to his many artist friends and ‘MER . . . DE . . .’ to: ‘Académismes . . . Historiens . . . Museés . . .’. In this, he may have been venting his spleen against the Louvre, but he was also entering into the spirit of the Futurist Marinetti’s proclamation: Museums: cemeteries! . . . Identical, surely, in the sinister promiscuity of so many bodies unknown to one another. Museums: public dormitories where one lies forever beside hated or unknown beings. . . . Turn aside the canals to flood the museums!9\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 14 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\n14\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nFound and lost Later that year in Florence an art dealer received a letter offering ‘Mona Lisa’ for sale. He took it as a hoax and replied that he only dealt in originals and that he was unable to visit Paris to view the painting. Soon afterwards he was visited by a man calling himself Leonardo Vincenzo who said that ‘Mona Lisa’ was in his hotel room and that he required half a million lire and a guarantee that the painting would remain in its homeland, Italy. The dealer alerted the director of the Uffizi and the police, who then infiltrated the hotel. The next day, Leonardo Vincenzo was visited in his hotel room by the dealer, accompanied by the director. Here they saw ‘Mona Lisa’ being taken from a secret compartment at the bottom of a travelling trunk. This trunk was at once an echo of the suitcase within which Apollinaire and Picasso had concealed the Iberian statuettes and a pre-echo of the Boîte-en-valise (the ‘Portable Museum’) created by Marcel Duchamp years later. The dealer, the director and the thief then took the painting to the Uffizi to verify that this was indeed ‘Mona Lisa’ and not a copy. Vincenzo was immediately arrested and his name was revealed to be Vincenzo Peruggia, a workman who had been engaged some years previously at the Louvre. His naïve attempt at a kind of cultural restitution (with a price tag) met with limited success: the painting was then displayed in Florence, Rome and Milan before its triumphant return to Paris.10 The Italian poet and militarist D’Annunzio tried to reclaim the whole story of the theft for himself. He first hinted that he had commissioned Perrugia to steal the painting then, in 1920, said that ‘Mona Lisa’ had passed through his hands but that he arranged for its return to the Louvre due to his ‘satiety and disgust’ with it.11 Some years later, the Surrealists (given their name by Apollinaire) were to appropriate the painting for their own ends. ‘Mona Lisa’ was now fair game. In 1919 Marcel Duchamp added a moustache and goatee to a cheap reproduction and made it the vehicle for one of his risqué puns.12 Subsequently, Duchamp was to make a postcard-sized reproduction of this work for the Boîte-en-valise. Salvador Dali, taking his cue from Duchamp, exaggerated the moustache and egotistically turned ‘Mona Lisa’ into a self-portrait. In 1930 Fernand Léger incor-\n\ndelirious-03 ch01.fm Page 15 Tuesday, October 18, 2005 3:46 PM\n\nT H E\n\nL O U V R E\n\n•\n\n15\n\nporated a copy into his painting Gioconda with Keys, claiming that it was ‘an object like any other object’.13 But the story of the return of the painting, and the resolution of the narrative, is a blind. The theft marks the moment when the Delirious Museum infects the Louvre. ‘Mona Lisa’s’ absence changed its meaning forever – Leonardo’s famous painting had encountered modernity. In a sense it was ‘removed for photography’ to be endlessly reproduced mechanically. ‘Mona Lisa’ was packed up and concealed and, instead of being an object fixed in place both on the wall and in the imagination, it became nomadic. It may never have returned. Now the painting is impossible to see. The space that ‘Mona Lisa’ occupied on the morning of 22 August 1911 is taken up by a glass box and a crowd of people. Henri Lefebvre wrote: The tourist trade – whose aim is to attract crowds to a particular site – historic city, beautiful view, museums etc. – ruins the site insofar as it achieves its aim: the city, the view, the exhibits are invisible behind the tourists, who can only see one another.14\n\nHow many photographs taken by these museum visitors show nothing but the reflection of the photographer or the camera’s white flash? By photographing the painting, the box within which it is contained has become the mirror prophesied by Louis Béroud. The crowds are still looking for the lost painting. But ‘Mona Lisa’ is forever missing. At the heart of the Ur-museum there is an absence. Melancholy permeates the Salon Carré and seeps out into Paris; a city of lost things. I have retrospectively appointed Apollinaire as the first curator of the Delirious Museum in compensation for his wrongful imprisonment. The coincidence of his temporary possession of the stolen statuettes from the Louvre and his troubled involvement in the story of ‘Mona Lisa’ grants him a special relevance to the history of the museum. Inadvertently he was the subversive at the heart of a reinterpretation of the Louvre and, by extension, the institution of the museum itself. At this point the space of the museum changes from presence to absence. The messages of the objects in the collection shift, becoming fluid and uncertain.\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 16 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n2\n\nT HE E NDLESS M USEUM : A ‘H OUSE OF D REAMS ’\n\nIn order to piece together the scattered fragments of the Delirious Museum, a museum in ruins, it is necessary to excavate streets, explore urban spaces and examine ways of looking at cities. The genesis of the Delirious Museum lies not in the history of the museum itself but in ideas about the city, as articulated by Baudelaire, Benjamin, Aragon and Breton. Their ideas constitute both a history and the Delirious Museum itself. Though the ‘map is not the territory’1 the diagram of the labyrinth is also a labyrinth. The anecdotes and stolen manifestos here are at once both theory and collection.\n\nAt Charlie Brown’s There is a photograph taken by Bill Brandt in the 1930s. It shows a young couple kissing in a London pub. Next to them sits another man, apparently oblivious to his neighbours. On the wall behind the three people is an assortment of pictures; a sailing ship, a caricature, a softedged photograph of the king. Brandt’s photograph is called: At Charlie Brown’s. This pub, also known as the Railway Tavern, was located on West India Dock Road, at the north end of the Isle of Dogs. It sat at the crossroads of a number of routes to the docks and, as such, it became a haunt of sailors setting out on, and returning from, sea voyages. From around the turn of the century many of the sailors deposited artefacts collected on their trips in lieu of payment. Instead of selling these things, the proprietor began to cover the walls of the pub with them. Guidebooks, when they referred to the East End at all, would refer to Charlie Brown’s as a pub/museum. The Guide to London\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 17 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n4.

The rest of the collection is, apparently, now divided between a Woodford pub and a private house.’2 The small photographs in the book show an arched room festooned with objects, including a number of stuffed alligators. Charlie Brown himself died in 1932 and today the pub is gone, swept away for the approach roads to the Canary Wharf office development. There is a tradition of public house decor in Britain that could be called ‘accretion’;3 this is characterized by a slow build-up of objects that have come to belong to the interior. Some pubs buy this look: books are purchased by the metre and left to gather dust, framed pictures come off-the-shelf to give the interior the look of age. In London there are a number of pubs that have ‘frozen interiors’ with the contents left untouched from a particular moment in time. Charlie Brown’s seems to have transcended both of these styles. To be described as a ‘pub/museum’ suggests that some value could be attached to the collection. This belongs within a separate tradition that began with the collections put together by the proprietors of certain London coffee-houses and taverns in the 18th century. These places had an ambiguous rôle that straddled entertainment and education. The most famous of these was Don Saltero’s Coffee House in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. James Salter, its proprietor, is reputed to have been a servant in the household of the scholarly collector and founder of the British Museum, Sir Hans Sloane. Indeed, Salter said his collection was based around duplicates and copies from Sloane’s collection. Thus the history of the popular museum shadows that of the institutional collection though both arise from the private collection, the wunderkammer. The artefacts exhibited at Don Saltero’s were a mixture of natural history specimens and man-made curiosities. The catalogue for 1732 listed a petrified cat found between the walls of Westminster Abbey, a rose from Jericho, ‘the Pope’s infallible candle’ and 290 other objects.4 The Royal Swan Tavern in Shoreditch, London, listed 567 items in its catalogue of 1756 including Chinese chopsticks and Charles of Swedeland’s boots. In 1752 this pub/museum put on show the rope used to hang a murderer at Execution Dock. The rope was said to cure ailments.5\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 19 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\nT H E\n\nE N D L E S S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n19\n\nThe Bill Brandt photograph, though clearly not a documentary picture of the interior, provides a clue to a particular quality of the Delirious Museum. Brandt’s image shows people kissing and drinking in the pub. Incidentally, it shows the same activities taking place in a ‘museum’. These are activities that are not meant to happen in a museum, except maybe in the museum café. Yet here the life of the street is brought into the museum in an extreme way. Of course, all museums have this imposed on them to some degree. Despite the fact that parallels are often drawn with the cathedral, most museum buildings are social, rather than religious, spaces, with all the complications that ‘social spaces’ implies. The former Bankside power station, Tate Modern, has been especially prone to the cathedral comparison. The architects, Herzog & de Meuron, and numerous critics referred to this before and immediately after the opening.6 The vast entrance space has obvious parallels to the nave of a cathedral, though it is more obviously a turbine hall. Another, richer, comparison made with museums is to the department store. Both institutions were born out of the same modern impetus and they have many features in common: display, repetition and classification, not to mention commerce.7 By 1855, Paris boasted two Louvres: the former palace turned museum and its double, the Louvre department store. Walter Benjamin recognized this relationship: There are relations between department store and museum, and here the bazaar provides a link. The amassing of artworks in the museum brings them into communication with commodities, which – where they offer themselves en masse to the passer-by – awake in him the notion that some part of this should fall to him as well.8\n\nThe Delirious Museum acknowledges and even celebrates this ambiguous relationship and welcomes the intrusions and complications that come from the museum being seen as a social space. Far from consenting to be ‘educated’ by museological displays and their didactic labels, visitors frequently use museums to other ends: as shelters from the rain, as places of assignation or ancestor worship or as through-routes. At both the British Museum and the National Gallery in London it is possible to traverse city blocks along north/ south axes. The route through the National Portrait Gallery in\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 20 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n20\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nLondon slices a slender triangle off the same block that houses the National Gallery. In Amsterdam’s Historical Museum, a painting gallery dramatically colonises a public passageway. This is one component in a series of complex urban spaces that move unnervingly between public and private, open and concealed. These other ‘uses’ bring an element of the arcade, the café, the church and the city’s streets and parks into the museum. Similarly, the street is a type of museum with its accretions of history, its relics, its wall texts and its patina of age. The visitor to the museum may not even care about the particular history of the museum’s objects; her or his interest may be that of a cat-lover, an embalmer, an occultist or a student of industrial design. In The Museum of Unconditional Surrender the Croatian Dubravka Ugrešić uses the metaphor of the museum to attempt to regain some form of collective memory for people whose lives have been irrevocably changed by political implosion and war. In the short prologue to the book she lists the contents of a vitrine that are all the items found in the stomach of a deceased walrus. The visitor . . . cannot resist the poetic thought that the objects have acquired some . . . secret connections. Caught up in this thought, the visitor then tries to establish semantic coordinates, to reconstruct the historical context (it occurs to him, for instance, that Roland [the walrus] died one week after the Berlin Wall was erected) . . .9\n\nThe Delirious Museum sits firmly within the city, that most complex of social spaces and the language used here derives from certain urban theories and stratagems relating particularly to walking.10 Movement through the Delirious Museum is also characterized by wandering or drifting and getting lost. The associations generated by the objects in my imagined museum are open-ended; meanings are un-fixed and transient. The city in flux is the model for the Delirious Museum. To read my museum it is necessary to look at ways in which the modern city has been anatomized as found, as opposed to planned, space. And, as the city and hence the ‘museum’ under consideration here are constructions of modernity, the theoretical context also belongs within that ‘tradition’ of modernity. Much of the theoretical language to be used has its origins in studies of modern Paris and in the city itself. In his autobiographical essay ‘Hermit in Paris’ Italo Calvino wrote:\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 21 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\nT H E\n\nE N D L E S S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n21\n\nParis has the kind of shops where one feels that this is the city which gave shape to that particular way of regarding culture which is the museum, and the museum in turn has given its form to the most varied activities in daily life, so that the galleries in the Louvre and the shopwindows form a continuum. Let’s say that everything in the street is ready to go into the museum, or that the museum is ready to absorb the street.11\n\nThe flâneur Charles Baudelaire in his essay of 1859, The Painter of Modern Life, refers to the work of an artist engaged in the description of the spectacle of ‘modern life’, not just the city street but also, for example, modern warfare and make-up. The artist whom Baudelaire used as his example was the relatively obscure Constantin Guys, but he could have been referring to Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas or Gustave Caillebotte. These painters all addressed the urban scene, which was in the process of being transformed by the boulevards planned by Baron Haussmann from the 1850s onwards. These cut through the proletarian rookeries, the faubourgs of Paris with their constant potential for revolution, not just providing slum clearance and easy movement for troops, but also creating a theatre of the street. Wide pavements and roadways set the individual and the crowd on a stage upon which to be viewed. Baudelaire paraphrases Edgar Allan Poe’s story ‘The Man of the Crowd’: In the window of a coffee house there sits a convalescent, pleasurably engaged in gazing at the crowd, and mingling, through the medium of thought, in the turmoil of thought that surrounds him. But lately returned from the valley of the shadow of death, he is rapturously breathing in all the odours and essences of life; as he has been on the brink of total oblivion, he remembers, and fervently desires to remember, everything. Finally he hurls himself into the midst of the throng, in pursuit of an unknown, half-glimpsed countenance that has, on an instant, bewitched him. Curiosity had become a fatal, irresistible passion.12\n\nIn his essay Baudelaire first establishes the status of the flâneur:\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 22 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n22\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nFor the perfect flâneur, for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to set-up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world – such are a few of the slightest pleasures of those independent, passionate, impartial natures which the tongue can but clumsily define. The spectator is a prince who everywhere rejoices in his incognito.13\n\nBaudelaire then goes on to promote what he calls the ‘man of the crowd’: Be very sure that this man, such as I have depicted him – this solitary, gifted with an active imagination, ceaselessly journeying across the great human desert – has an aim loftier than that of the mere flâneur, an aim more general, something other than the fugitive pleasure of circumstance. He is looking for that quality that you must allow me to call ‘modernity’ . . .14\n\nWalter Benjamin situated the flâneur of Paris somewhere between the street-corner idler of Berlin and the man of the crowd of London. Benjamin notes: There was the pedestrian who would let himself be jostled by the crowd, but there was also the flâneur who demanded elbow room and was unwilling to forego the life of a gentleman of leisure.15\n\nBenjamin, like Poe, saw the man of the crowd as someone whose ‘composure has given way to manic behaviour’.16 The flâneur, the gentleman of leisure, on the other hand, was of the crowd but set apart from it. Like him, the inquisitive modern urban observer, the visitor to the Delirious Museum, moves freely between these rôles. He or she can be both ‘of the crowd’ and, like the flâneur, detached from it. The desire of the Delirious Museum is that every visitor should succumb to curiosity, that ‘irresistible passion’ described by Baudelaire. In 1879 Edgar Degas began a series of drawings and etchings of his fellow artist, the American Mary Cassatt, with her sister, in the Louvre.17 Twenty years prior to this he had been a registered copyist in the museum and this might have kindled his interest in the idea of ‘looking’ as a subject for his art. The drawings of Mary Cassatt\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 23 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\nT H E\n\nE N D L E S S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n23\n\nshow her from the back so that the viewer is, as it were, looking over her shoulder. Degas drew her leaning on her umbrella, clothed in black and he repeats this silhouette in each of the compositions, moving her like a mannequin from room to room. In At the Louvre: Mary Cassatt in the Etruscan Gallery her sister Lydia’s attention is drawn away from the guidebook in her hand to gaze at Mary or beyond her. From a vitrine, the two faces of reclining, dead Etruscans gaze out beyond the edge of the picture. Lydia may be a little distracted but Mary seems engrossed in the act of looking. Thus, the viewer of the picture is engaged in a myriad act of looking that involves Degas, Mary Cassatt, Lydia Cassatt and the Etruscan figures. It is tempting to describe this as ‘just looking’ yet the looking provides the way into the experience of the museum and its objects. There is a particular kind of looking going on here; it is both looking at and looking through. It is also about reflection; the reflection of the glass and the reflection generated by the relationships between objects and their context. In order to get more out of this experience it is necessary to make some kind of imaginative leap, as it is when gazing out, like Baudelaire’s man of the crowd, through the shop window. Despite being historically and socially specific, the flâneur – the 19th-century white, upper-middle class male – is still an emblematic figure for modernity.18 At the same time the presence and pursuit of leisure has become a commonplace for working people. Museums often aspire to the educational and these aspirations are reinforced by the need for public bodies to identify targets that will justify funding. But the basis of the museum’s ‘use’ remains within the broad sphere of leisure. The counterpoint to the rigour of the organized visit is the random process of visual consumption in which the individual and the small group engage. This creates, in Peter Campbell’s phrase, an ‘unresolved narrative’.19 When the museum is (mis)read by the cat-lover or the occultist, the narrative may go beyond the unresolved to become deviant: a reading against the grain of the museum. Inevitably, the viewer makes her or his own connections; constructs a series of relationships and a line of questioning that is particular to that individual.\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 24 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n24\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nWalter Benjamin and the arcades The idea of the museum-goer as flâneur has been explored by Pierre Missac in his detailed discussion of Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project.20 He extends the idea of the arcade to include glass architecture and the atrium. Naming the flâneur on this occasion the ‘art lover’, Missac describes how he contents himself with a fairly brief tour of some rooms, a rapid flânerie to see new acquisitions or a restoration. He quickly finds himself in an atrium that is not only characterized by greater and greater square footage but also occupied by fixtures that have nothing to do with the works on display.21\n\nMissac suggests that this extends Benjamin’s notion of the arcade as the ‘collective’s house of dreams’ to include the museum. Not only the museum, but also the objects, their relationships to each other and their relationships to their surroundings, are inextricably connected to this proposition. The work of Walter Benjamin forms a series of links between the spaces of 19th-century Paris, the writings of Baudelaire, the idea of collecting and the convulsive city that the Surrealists were to inhabit in the 1920s. Benjamin himself was a collector of books and he wrote about this in his celebrated essay ‘Unpacking My Library’.22 Elsewhere he wrote about other collectors23 and, in one of his radio broadcasts for children, about stamp collecting. But his most ambitious engagement with the collection was the Arcades Project. There seems to be no consensus of what Benjamin meant the final form of the Arcades Project to be. Was it a book or the research for a book? Was it, indeed, a kind of objet deluxe created under the influence of Surrealism? Today, it exists in book form (in German since 1982 and in English since 1999) as an assemblage of other people’s texts put together and classified by Benjamin the collector. At the same time, though, it is also many of the things described within it: a city, a ruin, a panorama and a museum. Method of this project: literary montage. I needn’t say anything. Merely show. I shall purloin no valuables, appropriate no ingenious formulations. But the rags, the refuse – these I will not inventory but allow, in\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 25 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\nT H E\n\nE N D L E S S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n25\n\nthe only way possible, to come into their own: by making use of them.24\n\nIf the collection that is the Arcades Project is a kind of museum, it is as if Benjamin is here proposing a museum without labels and without explanation; a museum in which the role of the curator is returned to being the custodian rather than the interpreter. Throughout his writings Benjamin returned to the theme of the city. Berlin was the site for reminiscences of his childhood, Marseilles was experienced under the influence of hashish, Moscow was the scene for his pursuit of Asja Lacis and, writing with Lacis, Naples became a place of delirium: As porous as this stone is the architecture. Building and action interpenetrate in the courtyards, arcades, and stairways. In everything they preserve the scope to become a theatre of new, unforeseen constellations.25\n\nIt is as if Benjamin sees Naples as the unconscious of Paris: . . . one can scarcely discern where building is still in progress and where dilapidation has already set in . . . Porosity results not only from the indolence of the Southern artisan, but also, from the passion for improvisation, which demands that space and opportunity be at any price preserved. Buildings are used as a popular stage.26\n\nThis is Benjamin’s retro-active, collective dream for Paris: To construct the city topographically – tenfold and a hundredfold – from out of its arcades and its gateways, its cemeteries and bordellos, its railroad stations . . . just as formerly it was defined by its churches and its markets. And the more secret, the more deeply embedded figures of the city: murders and rebellions, the bloody knots in the network of the streets, lairs of love, and conflagrations.27\n\nHere, in these ‘lairs of love’ and in these ‘conflagrations’ lies the link to the Surrealists. Theirs was an imagined city lying just beneath the surface and behind the history of the visible. For Benjamin, Surrealist writing opened up a way to see Paris in these terms, as a place with associations beyond the closed descriptions of Baedeker and the Haussmannization of the street pattern. Surrealist readings of Paris created a porous, dream city.\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 26 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n26\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nAt the centre of this world of things stands the most dreamed-of of their objects, the city of Paris itself. But only revolt completely exposes its surrealist face . . .28\n\nIf there was a single image that made this possibility manifest, it was the arcades. These were fissures in the urban fabric, spaces that opened up the possibility of the subversive theatre of city life. If the boulevards were about control and spectacle, then the arcades allowed for the possibility of a rending of the fabric, places in which to wander, cutting through city blocks, both man-made caves and urban labyrinths. ‘The father of Surrealism was Dada; its mother was an arcade’.29 The particular arcade upon which the Surrealists alighted – the movement’s ‘mother’ – was the Passage de l’Opéra.\n\nAragon and Breton; the passage as museum The Passage de l’Opéra was demolished in 1929 to make way for the latest phase of urban improvements to Paris, the extension to the Boulevard Haussmann. In this arcade had been the Certa Café, the favourite meeting place of the Dadaists and those who would eventually break from them under André Breton’s influence. Among these was the other prime mover of early Surrealism, Louis Aragon, who in his 1926 book Paris Peasant, inventorized the interior of the arcade in detail. Described by the author as a ‘Modern Mythology’, the book was split into two parts discussing first, the Passage de l’Opéra and then the 19th-century park, the Buttes Chaumont. These sites held a particular resonance for Aragon and the Surrealists. The part dealing with the park is a description of the topography of the place and the associations that various features have with human activities (for example love-making and suicide). The larger first part, where Aragon describes the passage, is more complex. Here the description of ‘topography’ is taken to an extreme. Aragon notes the details of shop signs and the exact placement of rooms and doorways. He not only describes the drinks available at the Certa Café but also reproduces the tariff list.

A single cashier surveys the bookshelves, from his perch in a little glass-panelled booth equipped with a frontal grille through which business is transacted.30\n\nAragon then goes on to describe a concièrge, elsewhere in the passage, inhabiting his glass cubicle at the foot of the stairs leading to a set of furnished apartments: ‘watching skirts and trousers pass by as they climb up towards their assignations’.31 He scrutinizes the windows of the champagne seller and the truss shop and he remarks on a melancholy vitrine: Directly opposite the tailor and the hairdresser’s, a showcase belonging to the Restaurant Arrigoni, in which a coloured picture of a memorable banquet holds the place of honour amid a display of longnecked, straw-corseted Italian wine bottles . . .32\n\nThis interest in detailed description is not dissimilar to the photographic work undertaken between 1909 and 1915 by Eugène Atget in his Seven Albums, which meticulously, even obsessively recorded hitherto uncelebrated fragments of the fabric of Paris. One of the albums, Métiers, boutiques et étalages de Paris, was a record of the ephemeral fragments of street displays: kiosks, market barrows, the stalls put on pavements outside shops. Another album, Enseignes et vielles boutiques de Paris, documented shop façades. These pictures fix moments and places that are largely gone; when Atget photographed them he knew they were either temporary by nature or were endangered by development. At the same time, these photographs, along with those in the other albums, are a means of classifying the city, a kind of archive of the streets; a Delirious Museum of photographs. Atget became at once photographer and curator, in fact he preferred the term ‘archivist’ to ‘artist’. Atget’s images undoubtedly influenced\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 29 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\nT H E\n\nE N D L E S S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n29\n\nthe Surrealists though he preceded them and was wary of being linked to them.33 The information in Paris Peasant is drawn together in an analytical manner that is almost like re-assembling the clues on an archaeological site. What Freud suggested as a metaphor for uncovering the unconscious, the Surrealists extended into the realm of the city. Aragon, by reconstructing the Passage de l’Opéra in a text also transforms it. The passage or arcade is anyway an ambivalent kind of urban space. It is enclosed yet open, inside yet top lit, both public and private. While it is a space that clearly belongs to the street it is something separate from it. ‘What I forgot to say is that the Passage de l’Opera is a big glass coffin . . .’.34 Aragon goes on to describe ‘the changing light of the arcades, a light ranging from the brightness of the tomb to the shadow of sensual pleasure . . .’.35 This is an echo of Zola’s description of the fictional Passage du Pont Neuf in Thérèse Raquin: . . . the arcade takes on the sinister look of a real cut-throat alley; great shadows creep along the paving-stones and damp draughts blow in from the street until it seems like an underground gallery dimly lit by three funereal lamps.36\n\nKnowing of the imminent demolition of the Passage, Aragon writes it back into existence as a ‘mythological’ subject. In his unfinished Arcades Project Walter Benjamin took the idea of the arcade to represent the birth of the modern city. Aragon, in choosing to document this particular arcade, acknowledged the importance of this kind of space to the city, while recognizing the possibilities of a longing for that which is about to be lost. Benjamin acknowledged the particular delirium of both place (the Passage) and the written word (Paris Peasant): ‘. . . evenings in bed I could not read more than a few words of it before my heartbeat got so strong I had to put the book down . . .’.37 There is, of course, no trace of the Passage de l’Opéra. Under its site is the small ticket hall of the Metro station Richelieu-Drouot. This is dominated by a large, black, marble war memorial. The memorial, to employees of the Metro who died in the First World War, covers an entire wall with names inscribed into its surface from Abraham, through Breton to Zoeller. It appears to be sinking; the base is several\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 30 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n30\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\ncentimetres below the level of the floor. The central figure is of a woman with arms stretched upwards to the vault of the ceiling. It is as if the roof of the station needs to be supported by the statue but it is still too heavy and the memorial is slowly descending into the earth. Above ground, the site is occupied by the confluence of two boulevards and that most impervious of all architectural forms: a bank. For my purposes there was nothing there, but on my visit I took consolation in small discoveries: I noticed numerals, like catalogue numbers, impressed into the tar – after rain these took longer to dry than the surrounding pavement. I also found a small white sticker on the bus shelter on the site. This showed the head of a dog in threequarters view stamped onto a blank manufacturer’s checking label. The image had run in the rain or faded through time so the dog’s head was a ghostly remnant. But the ghost was not that of the Passage. Benjamin also noted the physical similarities and the common use of iron as a building material in both arcades and exhibition halls. By extension it is useful to apply this comparison to museum galleries: long, high spaces with central access lit by daylight from above (‘the brightness of the tomb’ or what John Soane called a lumière mystérieuse). Both spaces are semi-public and used for display. And, returning to the shop window through which Baudelaire’s ‘man of the crowd’ views the city, the shop windows of the passage have similarities to museum showcases. These vitrines, of course, work in both directions: they are seen into and out of, and this ambiguity marks them out as fragments of the Delirious Museum. Nadja, written by André Breton and published in 1928, also describes fragments of Paris. In this work Breton describes his encounters with the elusive Nadja in various streets and cafés haunted by the Surrealists. The narrative is mainly made up with a series of wanderings starting and ending almost arbitrarily. One such walk, before Nadja herself is introduced in the book, describes Breton and Marcel Noll’s visit to the flea market at Saint Ouen. He talks about previous visits: I go there often, searching for objects that can be found nowhere else: old-fashioned, broken, useless, almost incomprehensible . . . like, for example, that kind of irregular white shellacked half cylinder covered with reliefs and depressions that are meaningless to me, streaked with\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 31 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\nT H E\n\nE N D L E S S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n31\n\nhorizontal and vertical reds and greens, preciously nestled in a case under a legend in Italian, which I brought home and after careful examination I have finally identified as some kind of statistical device, operating three-dimensionally and recording the population of a city in such and such a year, though all this makes it no more comprehensible to me.38\n\nThis near hysterical passage sparks off a long sequence of descriptions of similarly ‘incomprehensible’ objects: a glove, a sign with a double meaning and a picture incorporating three separate images, a tableau vivant of a tiger, a vase and an angel. In Mad Love, published in 1937, Breton returns to the flea market, this time with the sculptor Giacometti and once again he encounters ‘the catalyzing role of the found object’.39 They each discover an object on the stalls that Breton claims has striking associations for them: Giacometti a mask with odd louvred eye-slits and Breton a large wooden spoon with a tiny shoe carved into its end. But it is striking that Breton does not see the same possibilities in the museum nor, indeed, in the museum object. Breton seems intent on possessing the object of his desire rather than just recording it visually. In his essay ‘Surrealism and Painting’ of 1927 Breton wrote: Now I confess that I have passed like a madman through the slippery halls of museums. But I am not the only one. In spite of some marvelous glances thrown to me by women similar in every way to those of today, I have not for an instant been fooled by what those subterranean and immovable walls had to offer me of the unknown . . . Outside, the street prepared a thousand more real enchantments for me.40\n\nThen in Nadja, these ‘glances’ come back to haunt him: How much I admire those men who decide to be shut up at night in a museum in order to examine at their own discretion, at an illicit time, some portrait of a woman they illuminate by a dark lantern.41\n\nSide-by-side on the Boulevard Montmartre are the entrances to the Musée Grévin waxworks and that of the Passage Jouffroy. The museum was opened in 1882 and houses the usual displays of the famous and infamous. On the ground floor are the Salles des Colonnes and La Coupole which are devoted largely to contemporary displays. On the first floor there is a hall of mirrors called the Palais des Mirages. In Nadja, Breton admits that his own desires have been thwarted:\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 32 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\n32\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nthe impossibility of obtaining permission to photograph an adorable wax-work figure in the Musée Grévin, on the left, between the hall of modern political celebrities and the hall at the rear of which, behind a curtain, is shown ‘an evening at the theatre’: it is a woman fastening her garter in the shadows, and is the only statue I know of with eyes, the eyes of provocation, etc.42\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Breton snatched his own ‘illicit time’ in the Musée Grévin. Maybe, instead, he did this at the claustrophobic Musée Gustave Moreau, a short walk from both the waxworks and Breton’s own home. In 1961 Breton wrote: Discovering the Gustave Moreau Museum when I was sixteen permanently formed my manner of loving. It was there that beauty and love were revealed to me in the many faces and postures of women. That ‘type’ of woman obstructed my sight of all others – I was absolutely enchanted.43\n\nAndré Breton’s house and studio was in the rue Fontaine. Its façade gives little away. The doorway is part of the wall of a theatre designed in a vaguely modernist style. To see anything of Breton’s studio and proto-museum it is necessary to make a detour to the Centre Georges Pompidou where the part of the collection taken in lieu of death duties is kept. Embedded in their gallery of 20th-century art is one whole room of Breton’s collection. Displayed within a large vitrine is the faithfully recreated display of the Surrealist and African art objects that Breton juxtaposed in his studio at rue Fontaine. Some of these, along with pieces from the collections of, amongst others Paul Eluard, Louis Aragon and Tristan Tzara, formed part of the exhibits in the Counter Colonial Exhibition of 1931. This was set up in opposition to the official Colonial Exposition and was an attempt to undermine the imperialist message with one sympathetic to the Communist Party. The Surrealists’ exhibition was held with the support of the Soviet Union and was housed in Melnikov’s Soviet Pavilion, itself a vestige of the 1925 exposition.44 In retrospect it is more difficult to distinguish between the intention of the Colonial Exposition and that of Breton’s obsessive collecting. And, of course, the stolen Louvre statuettes would have looked perfectly at home here. In 2003 the remainder of Breton’s collection was put up for sale by his daughter. At the auction disgruntled ‘surrealists’ circulated fake\n\ndelirious-04 ch02.fm Page 33 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:26 PM\n\nT H E\n\nE N D L E S S\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n33\n\nEuro notes showing the head of Breton and bearing the legend: ‘Your money for the stinking corpse of a poet . . .’.45 Afraid of the institutional power of the state museum, the Surrealists seem to have shied away from direct links to it. At one point in the narrative, Nadja seems to be leading Breton to the Louvre but they stop in the Tuilleries, it is late and they go to a café. One of the early Paris Dada events attended by Aragon and Breton was held in the churchyard of Saint Julien le Pauvre in 1921. The announcement for the meeting proposed other sites for the next events ‘which really have no reason for existing . . . To participate in this first visit is to become aware of human progress in possible works of destruction . . .’.46 Among the list of proposed sites for other meetings was the Louvre. As if in acknowledgement of their fear of the museum, the Dadaists’ planned visit to the museum with ‘no reason for existing’ never took place. Other connections between the Surrealists and the museum may be tangential but they are numerous. A ‘catalogue’ of painted Surrealist museums would include René Magritte’s label/object paintings (‘In my pictures I showed objects situated where we never find them’47), Paul Delvaux’s The Spitzner Museum of 1943 and de Chirico’s still-life assemblages. Joseph Cornell, working in the United States at some distance from ‘official’ Surrealism, made boxes that were clearly influenced, as much by museums and archives, as by his personal obsessions. The influence of Marcel Duchamp on Surrealist exhibition installations and, by extension, the museum gallery, is discussed in Chapter 4. Lautréamont’s words, borrowed by Man Ray for the first issue of La Revolution Surréaliste, are often seen as a dictum for the early phase of Surrealism: ‘as beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella’. That the Surrealists never made a direct connection between this dictum and the museum display is remarkable. The museum cabinet (and not just the cabinet of curiosities) brings together a huge range of artefacts in an attempt at forming some cohesive history or narrative through ‘things’. There is certainly a degree of pleasure to be had by visitors (and here we could include the ‘group’ visitor too) in the looking, not just at the individual object but at the display itself.\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 34 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\n3\n\nB ENEATH THE M USEUM , THE S TREET\n\nSo now we are entering into the limitless Paris adored by collectors, this city which invites you to make collections of everything, because it accumulates and classifies and redistributes, where you can search as in an archaeological excavation. Italo Calvino1\n\nLeonardo Vincenzo created a nomadic museum when he took ‘Mona Lisa’ back to Italy in a suitcase. He left behind him a space in the Louvre that the Delirious Museum filled. The Louvre was no longer a closed system. It was now open-ended and its meanings were fluid and un-fixed. Baudelaire, Benjamin, Aragon and Breton looked at the city in a new way – reading between the lines and against the grain. In post-war Paris ideas about display and the city resurfaced in the work of both artistic and political groups. Each strand identified the spectacle as important despite having very different agenda.\n\nKlein/Arman In the aftermath of the Second World War, Paris lost its reputation for being the world capital of art. When artists left Europe before and during the war, many moved to New York and it was here that the last influential developments of Surrealism were played out, most publicly in the exhibition First Papers of Surrealism.2 While in New York abstract expressionism took hold in the galleries, in Paris there was a less seemly scramble for recognition. Developments in the New York art world fitted seamlessly into a trajectory leading from studio, via gallery, to museum. In Paris this was not the case. Instead,\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 35 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\nB E N E A T H\n\nT H E\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n35\n\nacross various movements, there was an antipathy towards the idea of the museum and its stultifying effect. One of these was a group centred on Yves Klein and Arman, who came to be known as the Nouveaux Realistes. Their work returns this narrative briefly to the rarified world of the art gallery but it mirrors the agitational activities of other, more revolutionary, groups. Klein had already established a reputation with his monochrome paintings (in International Klein Blue) in exhibitions in Milan and Paris in 1957, but it was his show at the Iris Clert Gallery, Paris, in the following year that became the coup de théâtre that he sought. The exhibition, ‘Le Vide’ (The Void), involved Klein and Clert in elaborate preparations. An application was made to the City of Paris to illuminate the Place de la Concorde obelisk in blue light. Two Republican Guards were secured for the vernissage and the gallery’s exterior was transformed by draping a huge blue curtain over the adjacent archway and painting out the gallery window (also, needless to say, in blue). Klein spent the days before the opening in the gallery covering the traces of any previous exhibition and covering every surface in white paint that he called ‘immaterialized blue’. The night of the opening justified all the preparations, and though the lighting of the obelisk was cancelled at the last moment, other events compensated. Huge crowds gathered (Klein had sent out 3,500 invitations) and queued to enter an interior that was emptied of content. Specially prepared blue cocktails were served which turned the urine of those who drank them blue. The police and the fire brigade turned up after a hoax phone call only to find it impossible to enter the street due to the number of people. In the ensuing days Clert and Klein were interrogated over the apparent misuse of the Republican Guards but were let off the hook because government ministers had been on the guest list. Klein was jubilant over the success of the event. Here was a void creating a complex series of reactions. By clearing the gallery of content, it was as if Klein had been able to start from scratch. Klein wrote: Some people were unable to enter, as if an invisible wall prevented them. One day, one of the visitors shouts to me: ‘I will come back\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 36 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\n36\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nwhen the void is full . . . .’ I respond to him: ‘When it is full you will no longer be able to enter.’3\n\n‘Le Vide’ was not ‘about’ museums. Klein wanted art to transcend daily life and this exhibition of de-materialized blue and spectacle was his attempt at this. But the opening of ‘Le Vide’ and the installation, particularly the photograph of the empty vitrine, haunt museology. This was the museum laid bare as if all its contents had been returned to their rightful owners or re-buried in the sites from which they had been excavated. Klein inadvertently exposed both the desire and the fear inherent to the Delirious Museum. Though Arman suggested ‘filling up’ the void created by Klein as the follow-on exhibition, it took him two years to convince Iris Clert that it was acceptable to fill the same rooms with rubbish. The original idea for ‘Le Plein’ (Full-up) had been to empty the contents of refuse trucks into the gallery, but this was seen as too disgusting and the compromise was to collect discarded items from Paris streets instead. Even this proved difficult and eventually the hoard was supplemented with other material to add bulk. This included old art catalogues and, to Clert’s consternation, the unsold works from an exhibition of ‘miniatures’ (which apparently included a very small Picasso). A tiny space was left for visitors to enter, but otherwise the space was crammed from floor to ceiling with detritus. The opening was once again an event of some note, though not on the scale of Klein’s exhibition. The space inside the gallery was so restricted that it was necessary for the guests to assemble in the street. Of the exhibition Klein wrote: After my Void, Arman’s Full-Up. The universal memory of art lacked this definitive mummification of quantitavism. Reassured at last, all of nature will from this moment begin, as of old, to address us directly and with clarity.4\n\nAfter a few weeks the small amount of rotting organic matter left among the rubbish began to have its effect and it was necessary to close the exhibition before its scheduled run.\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 37 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\nB E N E A T H\n\nT H E\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n37\n\nSituationists What were we to do after we had painted a moustache on the Mona Lisa? Did we really wish Genghis Khan to stable his horses in the Louvre? Alexander Trocchi5\n\nThe Situationist International was a movement that developed out of various Surrealist splinter groups in the 1950s. If the relationship between Surrealism and the museum is tangential, then that between the Situationists and the museum is antagonistic. However, the Situationists negotiated and understood the city in a way that has parallels to the reading of the Delirious Museum. The primary site for situationist action was the street. The Delirious Museum is an extension of the street. Some of the strategies devised by the Situationists in order to dismantle the meaning of the city can also be used to take apart and re-invent the language of collection and display. The Situationist International was formed at a conference in Cosio d’Arroscia in Italy in 1957. The founding members had previously belonged to other groups. From Paris there were those who had belonged first to the Lettrists then to the Lettrist International (Guy Debord, Isidore Isou, Michele Bernstein). Another group was artists associated with CoBrA (Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam) and the Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus (Asger Jorn, Constant, Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio). There was one member who was the sole representative of the Psychogeographic Committee of London (Ralph Rumney). Between 1958 and 1969 the Situationists published various magazines that expanded on their ideas, initially about art and urbanism and increasingly, as the movement evolved, about politics. The stated aim of the Situationists was to disrupt and eventually dismantle the ‘spectacle’ of capitalist society by creating subversive ‘constructed situations’. These were defined as: ‘A moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a game of events.’6 It was recognized within the movement that capitalism has a tremendous power to recuperate subversion, to turn it to its own ends. This recognition bore the seeds\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 38 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\n6.

By the early 1960s the Situationists realized that artistic practice, far more than theoretical texts and revolutionary acts, was vulnerable to this recuperation. Almost from the moment of the inception of the Situationist International, members, especially the artists, either left or were expelled from the movement. In 1962 a breakaway group made up almost entirely of artists from Scandinavian countries formed the Second Situationist International. Other artists, such as Rumney, though no longer formal members, kept up contacts with the group long after expulsion. In 1967 Guy Debord, who had established himself as the single most powerful force within the movement, published his book La Société du Spectacle.7 This set out the ideology of Situationism in its post-art phase and is seen as one of the major influences on the radical student movements of Strasbourg and Nanterre and on the events of May 1968 in the streets of Paris. These events were as close as the Situationists came to realizing their desire for revolution. The streets were transformed into places of spontaneous action as the barricades went up and the walls were covered with graffiti and posters. The ideal, that the workers and the students should join in self-governing workers’ councils, was never quite achieved, even within the limited, temporary autonomous state of the Sorbonne during its occupation. When a degree of peace was restored and de Gaulle and his rightwing party emerged unscathed, it was recognized that the uprising had been a failure. With that failure came the slow deterioration of the Situationist International. In 1972, Debord and his remaining cohorts voted the movement out of existence. Though formally wound up, the Situationists continued to exert an influence. The most visible manifestation of this was in the taking up of situationist slogans, if not always ideology, by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols in 1976 and in the accompanying graphic designs of Jamie Reid. Here subversion was put to use to undermine the record industry and the production of popular music. Of course, this too was open to recuperation. There is also a strong vein of situationist thought running through the actions of adherents to the anti-capitalist movement of the 1990s and into the beginning of the 21st century. But another strand of situationist theory also retains a resonance and refuses to disappear: that of the project of re-\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 40 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\n40\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nimagining urban life. This strand can be put to use in assembling the non-museum that is the Delirious Museum. In the 1950s the Situationists, while building their armoury against the spectacle, defined a number of techniques for use in their version of urban life. Their notion of dérive, literally ‘drift’, is part of a modernist tradition of an almost casual engagement with the city. Not only does it link to Breton’s wandering through Paris in his hopeless pursuit of Nadja, but it also has echoes of Baudelaire’s ‘man of the crowd’. Dérive depends on chance and a degree of chaos. The first issue of Internationale Situationniste defined dérive as ‘a mode of experimental behaviour linked to the conditions of urban society; a technique of transient passage through varied ambiences’.8 What the dérive allows the city dweller (or the museum visitor) to do is to create a new kind of map of the city (the museum). The Situationists called this mapping ‘psychogeography’. In the psychogeographic map the seen, the known and the experienced are amalgamated. The Situationists did produce some of these maps, thereby, of course, courting recuperation. The English artist Ralph Rumney made a record of a dérive around Venice in 1957. This is a composition made up of a deliberately obscure map, small photographs of bars and street scenes linked in a narrative by oblique captions.9 ‘It is our thesis that cities should embody a built-in play factor. We are studying here a play-environment relationship’.10 For Rumney, ‘Venice, like Amsterdam and the Paris of yesteryear, offer[ed] many possibilities for disorientation’.11 Rumney avoided making proposals for Venice. Instead he treated it as a found place, a museum of spaces and accidental encounters. By selecting sites and routes with particular resonances, Rumney became a nomadic curator of the city. Other experiments in dérive took place over the following years, but Rumney’s idea of combining text and photographs was not repeated. In the same way that Rumney used the archetypal melancholic city, Venice, as the site for his explorations, other dérives were based around areas of Paris that were doomed or in states of transition. The montage, The Naked City, made by Guy Debord and Asger Jorn in 1957 shows fragments of a map of Paris connected by graphic red arrows. The areas featured were not only sites of the correct Situationist ambience, they were also places that were threatened by\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 41 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\nB E N E A T H\n\nT H E\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n41\n\ndevelopment. This echoes the Surrealists’ fascination with the Passage de l’Opéra and the possibilities of creating ‘modern mythology’ from that which has been destroyed. Thus, the dérive could occupy an ambiguous position between the melancholy of nostalgia and the desire for total transformation. And, of course, the Delirious Museum occupies a similar position: it is both an existing and a potential space. It is a space that exists hidden within the visible, where there is always the possibility of disorientation and the probability of getting lost. In his psychogeographical description of Les Halles, the Situationist Abdelhafid Khatib wrote: The first step, architecturally, would obviously be to replace the current pavilions with an autonomous series of small situationist architectural complexes. Among these new architectures and on their peripheries, corresponding to the four zones we have envisaged here, ought to be perpetually changing labyrinths, and this with the aid of more adequate objects than the fruit and vegetable panniers which make up the sole barricades today.12\n\nHere the dérive leads to a psychogeographic analysis and hence to ‘détournement’. Guy Debord defined détournement as ‘the re-use of pre-existing artistic elements in a new ensemble’. He went on to say: The two fundamental laws of détournement are the loss of importance of each détourned autonomous element – which may go so far as to lose its original sense completely – and at the same time the organization of another meaningful ensemble that confers on each element its new scope and effect.13\n\nIn the context of urbanism, détournement could subvert the way in which the capitalist ‘spectacular’ city could be read and used. In Les Halles the existing four zones of ambience would be ‘détourned’ by the demolition of the pavilions and the superimposition of ‘Situationist architectural complexes’. Other, more detailed, suggestions for the improvement of Paris were suggested in the journal Potlatch: The rooftops of Paris should be opened to pedestrian traffic by means of modifications to fire escape ladders and construction of catwalks where necessary . . . All street-lamps should be equipped with switches; lighting should be for public use . . . Cemeteries should be\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 42 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\n42\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\neliminated. All corpses and memories of that sort should be totally destroyed; no ashes and no remains . . . Museums should be abolished and their masterpieces distributed to bars (Phillipe de Champaigne’s works in the Arab cafés of rue Xavier-Privas; David’s ‘Sacre’ in the Tonneau in Montagne-Geneviève).14\n\nHere is the real space of Charlie Brown’s pub with its collection of exotica moving back into the theoretical world of conscious category confusion. The most thorough Situationist architectural project was New Babylon, undertaken by the Dutch artist Constant Nieuwenhuys between 1956 and 1974. This project began as a series of proposals for insertions into existing cities but developed into a scheme that would replace and extend whole urban areas. Its starting point was a future nomadic culture brought about by technological liberation. Here was a society that no longer needed to work but instead could indulge in play and continuous dérive. Constant proposed a labyrinthine net structure that could accommodate this ludic desire. There are elements in this project that were picked up in, for instance, the Walking City of Archigram and Cedric Price’s Fun Palace in the 1960s. Ironically, these were to influence, in turn, Piano and Rogers’ designs for the Centre Pompidou – a building that Debord refused to enter.15 The building was not only named after one of Debord’s natural enemies, but it was also an embodiment of the way in which society recuperates the potential of the ‘situation’ and transforms it into spectacle. It is in the openness of New Babylon that there is a link back to the Delirious Museum and its experiments, losses, wanderings and accidents. The Delirious Museum is also a labyrinthine network; objects linked in an attenuated space and in disrupted time. Each has a nomadic existence. The glass vitrine of the museum acts both as barrier and as an environment of unresolved connections and relationships: between people and things, between the living and their predecessors and between things and other things. Situationist theorists, especially Debord and Raoul Vaneigem, developed the theme of subversion throughout the 1960s. However, they became increasingly distanced from visual culture and began to move closer to direct political action. The barricades that disrupted\n\ndelirious-05 ch03.fm Page 43 Thursday, October 6, 2005 3:43 PM\n\nB E N E A T H\n\nT H E\n\nM U S E U M\n\n•\n\n43\n\nthe street pattern around the Sorbonne in May 1968 created a particular form of détournement, but they were limited in terms of what the Situationists called ‘unitary urbanism’. They were never to return to the ideas expressed in the pre-Situationist document: ‘Formulary for a New Urbanism’ written by Ivan Chtcheglov in 1953. This text, reprinted in the first issue of Internationale Situationniste, describes a possible future for the city (Paris is, not surprisingly, the only real city mentioned), which is responsive to human needs. Partly this is done through the creation of zones such as the Sinister Quarter, the Bizarre Quarter and the Historical Quarter. The text posits a place that is resistant to the ‘museumization’ of city life and especially the city fabric. The city of ‘unitary urbanism’ achieves this through flux and redefinition: ‘The architectural complex will be modifiable. Its aspect will change totally or partially in accordance with the will of its inhabitants . . .’.16 Chtcheglov’s city is neither utopia nor dystopia, rather it is an intensification of existing cities. In a similar way the Delirious Museum is not an alternative to existing museums; it is the existing museum re-interpreted, ‘détourned’ and intensified through its interaction with the city. If the Situationist city was a labyrinth in which to get lost and a site for play, if it was a place where misreading and subversion of the predictable were there to be discovered, so too is the Delirious Museum.\n\ndelirious-06 ch04.fm Page 44 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:37 PM\n\n4\n\nT HE TOTALMUSEUM : E XHIBITIONS /E XPERIMENTS\n\nThe artists’ exhibitions and installations described here have disappeared, have been damaged or have been put beyond use. The chapter excavates these exhibitions and experiments in order to establish a relationship to the idea of the Delirious Museum. Some of these were meant as temporary constructions, others have been shattered in transit or have been destroyed by bombs. One was destroyed, re-assembled and reproduced in multiple versions. Another, created in a series of 300, was intended as ‘portable’ but each edition has, inevitably, become the object of private or museological veneration and has reached a point of stasis. Yet others exist as documents or memories. So the descriptions and cross-references here are archaeological in nature. They are important to the development of the Delirious Museum because they are attempts to reconfigure the language of display. Unlike the urban strategies discussed in previous chapters these experiments were contained within the laboratory that is the museum. And they existed within a different chronological frame so it will be necessary to move back in time as well as travel to different locations.\n\nLissitzky/Schwitters (Hanover) In 1922 the Soviet artist El Lissitzky, alongside others, exhibited his work at the First Russian Art Exhibition in Berlin. The following year, after a successful show at the small gallery of the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hanover, he produced a series of prints called the Kestner Portfolio. These prints were part of an ongoing project that Lissitzky\n\ndelirious-06 ch04.fm Page 45 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:37 PM\n\nT H E\n\nT O T A L M U S E U M\n\n•\n\n45\n\ncalled Proun – an acronym for ‘project for affirmation of the new’. Lissitzky wrote: ‘Proun begins as a level surface, turns into a model of three-dimensional space, and goes on to construct all the objects of everyday life’.1 The prints, and other Proun works, were created using dynamic abstract shapes and a limited colour range – usually black, white and red. They are recognizably Constructivist or Suprematist in style. One of the prints is an isometric projection of adjoining walls, actually an exploded view of a simple box, laid out by Lissitzky in the print to show all the surfaces. There is a single doorway and a series of rectangles and rods applied to the walls and floor. The various groups of geometrical elements wrap around corners, connecting one plane to the other in a continuous composition. The print is Lissitzky’s design for the Proun Room in the Berlin exhibition. This was his starting point: Given were the six surfaces (floor, four walls, ceiling); they are to be designed, but, mind you, not as a living room, for there is an exhibition going on. In an exhibition people keep walking all around. Thus, space has to be organized in such a way as to impel everyone automatically to perambulate in it.2\n\nThe idea of articulating a rectilinear space by utilizing the corners was not new. In the pivotal 0.10 Exhibition in Petrograd of 1915 both Malevich, El Lissitzky’s teacher, and Tatlin used the corners in their installations. Malevich, referring to the traditional placing of icons, hung one of his black square paintings high in a corner of the gallery. Tatlin’s installation was more radical in that he created sculptural pieces that were created expressly for corners, parts of the room that were usually reserved for furniture. Lissitzky, in his Proun Room, extended the idea of connecting one plane to another to include the whole room and began to work towards a symbiotic environment for artworks. Lissitzky continued his Hanover connections the following year when he worked on issue 8/9 of Kurt Schwitters’ magazine Merz. The work of these two artists could hardly be more different. Schwitters, though working with a certain modernist economy of means, was unafraid of the detritus of the past, incorporating it, often chaotically, into his collages and sculptures. Lissitzsky was fascinated by the new:\n\ndelirious-06 ch04.fm Page 46 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:37 PM\n\n46\n\n•\n\nT H E\n\nD E L I R I O U S\n\nM U S E U M\n\nnew typography, new materials, new technology. The way their interests overlapped is reflected in the layout of the magazine. Alongside pictures of the work of Modernist architects framed with bold graphic devices, there are found photographs. In 1926 Lissitzky was asked back to Germany, this time to Dresden, after his wife-to-be, Sophie Küppers, agitated on his behalf with the architectural director of the Dresden International Art Exhibition, Heinrich Tessenow. Four years after the experiment of the Proun Room Lissitzky wanted to extend the possibilities it had presented: While passing along the picture-studded walls of the conventional art exhibition setup, the viewer is lulled into a numb state of passivity. It is our intention to make man active by means of design. This is the purpose of space.3\n\nWriting to Sophie Küppers, he said: ‘The room must be a kind of showcase, or stage on which the pictures appear as the actors in a drama (or comedy).’4 In Dresden Lissitzky was presented with a fairly small cubic room with a central doorway. In his design there was no emphasis on the axis, instead, he composed the walls of the room to act in balance as a whole. The most striking display features are all commentaries on movement and change. The ceiling of unbleached, stretched calico allowed for diffuse colour to be projected down into the space, so that, on either side of the doorway, one wall was yellow and the other was blue. Some of the walls had superimposed vertical slats, painted white and black on alternate faces, the background of the wall being grey. As visitors moved round the room, therefore, the walls changed from black to grey to white and vice versa. Lastly, Lissitzky made a series of vertical sliding screens allowing for the doubling-up of pictures on display. Visitors were expected to slide these planes up and down, making a choice about which pictures they wanted to look at. The pictures actually dropped behind a perforated steel screen so that they remained partially visible at all times. The work displayed was not only that of Lissitzky; Léger, Picabia, MoholyNagy, Mondrian and Gabo were also shown. So this was not just a showroom for Lissitzky but an attempt to re-frame the work of art and re-imagine the art gallery.\n\ndelirious-06 ch04.fm Page 47 Friday, October 7, 2005 3:37 PM\n\nT H E\n\nT O T A L M U S E U M\n\n•\n\n47\n\nThe director of Hanover’s Landesmuseum, Alexander Dorner, was, at this time, in the process of re-organizing the museum’s displays.5 After seeing the Dresden installation he approached Lissitzky to design a permanent room for the collection of modern works. This space came to be known as the Abstract Cabinet. Lissitzky illustrated it in another isometric drawing that, in its dynamism, could itself be mistaken for an abstraction. Some of the devices developed for Dresden were used again in this design; the ideas of the sliding screens and the slatted walls were retained. Lighting was from a window occupying one side of the room. Lissitzky wanted to manipulate this light by artificial means, introducing colour and dimming but there was no electric power available for the room so these ideas were not realized. The window wall incorporated two vitrines with rotating planes on which works on paper could be shown, and a sculpture plinth with a mirror at its back. The adjacent wall had a horizontally sliding screen containing four works, two of which were visible at any time. In 1930, Dorner commissioned László Moholy-Nagy to design the next room in the chronolgical sequence in the museum. This was called the Room of Our Time and was devoted to film, architecture and design. If anything, this display was more radical than Lissitzk"
