        "text": "The competition to design the new gallery was won by Michael Wilford and Associates but all the glory for this amazing building has been heaped upon just one member of the team, James Stirling, so I’m doing the same and crediting it to him. It was constructed between 1979 and 1984 right next to the Alte Staatsgaleire which dates back to 1843. Stirling has received very little flak or criticism for the way his modern design sits alongside its Neo-Classical predecessor which makes a very pleasant change; maybe it’s down to the calm Germanic nature and temperament? If you can bear me having a shouty rant about the subject, read this about a museum in Toronto.\n\nThe construction took place at the early stages of the Post-Modernist period and some folk think that this building is the epitome of what that movement is all about. The warm tones of the travertine and sandstone structural materials contrast sharply with the cool, bright colours of the steel frame and the chunky external handrails. The design includes a pedestrian route that raises you up through various levels around the perimeter of the building and passes through a sculpture garden in an enclosed, outdoor rotunda. All lovely stuff but my favourite bit is the sweepy, undulating, glazed front façade and it was this view that gained some notoriety in the UK in the 1980s as a backdrop to a TV advert for the Rover 800 Fastback."
