        "text": "1. Modernist Postmodernist Architecture By: Harshita Singh B.Arch 5A ASAP\n\n2. Comparision between Modernist & Postmodernist Architecture Modernist Architecture Postmodernist Architecture Duration: late 19th- early 20th century Late 20th -21st century Predecessor: Nordic Classicism Modernist Architecture Modernism is efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the modernization of society. Postmodernism refers to the functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist style are replaced by diverse aesthetics. Major concept: Form follows function pluralism, double coding, flying buttresses and high ceilings, irony and paradox, and contextualism.\n\n3. Modernism Modernism is a philosophical movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The term is often applied to modernist movements at the turn of the 20th century, with efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the modernization of society.\n\n4. Influential Architects Notable architects important to the history and development of the modernist movement include: • Ludwig Mies van der Rohe • Le Corbusier • Walter Gropius • Erich Mendelsohn • Frank Lloyd Wright • Louis Sullivan • Gerrit Rietveld • Bruno Taut • Arne Jacobsen • Oscar Niemeyer • Alvar Aalto\n\n5. Context • There are multiple lenses through which the evolution of modern architecture may be viewed. Some historians see it as a social matter, closely tied to the project of Modernity and thus the Enlightenment. • Modern architecture developed, as a result of social and political revolutions. Others see Modern architecture as primarily driven by technological and engineering developments. Still other historians regard Modernism as a matter of taste, a reaction against eclecticism and the lavish stylistic excesses of Victorian and Edwardian architecture. • With the Industrial Revolution, the availability of newly-available building materials such as iron, steel, and sheet glass drove the invention of new building techniques.\n\n6. Characterstics • Common themes of modern architecture include: • the notion that \"Form follows function\", a dictum originally expressed by Frank Lloyd Wright's early mentor Louis Sullivan, meaning that the result of design should derive directly from its purpose • simplicity and clarity of forms and elimination of \"unnecessary detail\" • materials at 90 degrees to each other • visual expression of structure (as opposed to the hiding of structural elements) • the related concept of \"Truth to materials\", meaning that the true nature or natural appearance of a material ought to be seen rather than concealed or altered to represent something else • use of industrially-produced materials; adoption of the machine aesthetic • particularly in International Style modernism, a visual emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines\n\n7. The Guggenheim Museum • Situated in Manhattan, New York City, it is the permanent home of a renowned and continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post- Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art. • Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the cylindrical building, wider at the top than the bottom, was conceived as a \"temple of the spirit\". • Its design was inspired by a \"Ziggurat\" Babylonian temple pyramid, inverted. • The Museum Guggenhein exhibits a great difference to the buildings in the vicinity because of its spiral shape, marked by the mergeing of triangles, ovals, arcs, circles and squares, which correspond to the concept of organic architecture • Its unique ramp gallery extends up from ground level in a long, continuous spiral along the outer edges of the building to end just under the ceiling skylight. • The materials used in its construction were basically precast concrete blocks. The white paint used on the internal walls makes the works of art stand out. The skylight is supported by steel joints.\n\n9. Sectional Elevation\n\n10. Wainwright Building • Known as the Wainwright State Office Building, it is a 10-story red brick office building at St. Louis, Missouri. • The Wainwright Building is among the first skyscrapers in the world. It was designed by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan (father of modern architecture) in the Palazzo style and built between 1890 and 1891. • It exemplifies Sullivan's theories about the tall building, which included a tripartite (three-part) composition (base-shaft-attic) based on the structure of the classical column. • The base contained retail stores that required wide glazed openings. Above it the semi-public nature of offices up a single flight of stairs are expressed as broad windows in the curtain wall. A cornice separates the second floor from the grid of identical windows of the screen wall, where each window is \"a cell in a honeycomb, nothing more\". The building's windows and horizontals were inset slightly behind columns and piers, as part of a “vertical aesthetic”\n\n12. • The ornamentation for the building includes a wide frieze below the deep cornice, which expresses the formalized yet naturalistic celery-leaf foliage. • It has rich decorative patterns in low relief, varying in design and scale with each story. The frieze is pierced by unobtrusive bull's-eye windows that light the top-story floor, originally containing water tanks and elevator machinery, the building includes embellishments of terra cotta.\n\n13. bull's-eye windows that light the top-story floor, originally containing water tanks and elevator machinery Details of ornamentation done\n\n14. Postmodernity Postmodernity in architecture is said to be heralded by the return of \"wit, ornament and reference\" to architecture in response to the formalism of the International Style of modernism. The functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist style are replaced by diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered the expressive and symbolic value of architectural elements and forms that had evolved through centuries of building which had been abandoned by the modern style.\n\n15. Characterstics The characteristics of postmodernism allow its aim to be expressed in diverse ways. • These characteristics include the use of sculptural forms, ornaments, anthropomorphism and materials which perform trompe l'oeil. These physical characteristics are combined with conceptual characteristics of meaning, including pluralism, double coding, flying buttresses and high ceilings, irony and paradox, and contextualism. • The sculptural forms, not necessarily organic, were created with much ardor. Each building’s forms are nothing like the conforming rigid ones of Modernism. These forms are sculptural and are somewhat playful. These forms are not reduced to an absolute minimum; they are built and shaped for their own sake. • Postmodernism, with its sensitivity to the building’s context, did not exclude the needs of humans from the building. The characteristics of Postmodernism were rather unified given their diverse appearances. The most notable among their characteristics is their playfully extravagant forms and the humour of the meanings the buildings conveyed.\n\n16. Influential Architects • Some of the best-known and influential architects in the Postmodern style are: • Aldo Rossi • Barbara Bielecka • Ricardo Bofill • John Burgee • Terry Farrell • Michael Graves • Helmut Jahn • Jon Jerde • Edward Jones • Philip Johnson • Hans Kollhoff • Ricardo Legorreta • Frank Gehry\n\n17. Petronas Twin Tower • Twin skyscrapers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia • Designed by: Argentine American architect César Pelli. • Constrction period:3 years i.e. march 1993-march 1996 • Floor area: 395,000 m2 (4,252,000 sq ft). • The 88-floor towers are constructed largely of reinforced concrete, with a steel and glass facade designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art, a reflection of Malaysia's Muslim religion. • The Petronas Towers feature a diamond-faceted facade consisting of 83,500 square metres (899,000 sq ft) of stainless steel extrusions. In addition, a 33,000-panel curtain wall cladding system resides within the towers. • the stainless steel element of the towers entices the illustrious sun, highlighting the magnificent towers, they are composed of 55,000 square metres (590,000 sq ft) of 20.38-millimetre (0.802 in) laminated glass to reduce heat by reflecting harmful UV rays.\n\n18. Petronas Twin Tower Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\n19. • The towers feature a double decker skybridge connecting the two towers on the 41st and 42nd floors. • The bridge is 170 m (558 ft) above the ground and 58 m (190 ft) long, weighing 750 tons. • The main bank of Otis Lifts is located in the centre of each tower. All main lifts are double-decker with the lower deck of the lift taking passengers to even-numbered floors and upper deck to odd-numbered floors. To reach an odd-numbered floor from ground level, passengers must take an escalator to the upper deck of the lift. • On the top of each tower is a pinnacle standing 73.5 metres (241 ft) tall. Each pinnacle is composed of 50 unique parts making up the main components: the spire, mast ball and ring ball. Together these parts weigh 176 tons. • The interiors of the towers highlight the Malaysian cultural inspiration to the design through traditional aspects such as fabric and carvings typical of the culture, specifically evident in the foyer of the entrance halls in the towers.\n\n20.

Harold Washington Library • The Harold Washington Library Center is the central library for the Chicago Public Library System. • The building contains approximately 756,000 square feet (70,200 m2) of space. • Architects: Hammond, Beeby and Babka. • Exterior:- The exterior evokes the design of the Rookery, Auditorium and the Monadnock buildings. The bottom portion is made of large granite blocks. Red brick makes up the majority of the exterior. These two portions draw on the Beaux-Art style. On the north, east and south sides of the build are five story tall arched windows. Between the windows are rope friezes. The pediments and most of the west side facing Plymouth Court are glass, steel and aluminum with ornamentation hearkening to the Mannerist style. the roof was ornamented with seven large, painted aluminum acroteria designed by Kent Bloomer with owl figures by Raymond Kaskey.\n\n23. Detailed exterior elements Elevation at western face\n\n24. Interior:- • All public doors lead to the lobby. The corridor goes east then south then west and opens south to the lobby. • The lower level houses the Cindy Pritzker Auditorium, Multi-Purpose Room and Exhibit Hall. • The central lobby is two stories tall. On the east side, the Popular Library is housed. • The second floor houses the Thomas Hughes Children’s library. Plan of Harold Washington library\n\n25. Neue Staatsgalerie • The Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany, was designed by the British firm James Stirling, Michael Wilford and Associates, although largely accredited solely to partner James Stirling. • The building has been claimed as the epitome of Post-modernism. • It was constructed in the 1970s and opened to the public in 1984. • The building incorporates warm, natural elements of travertine and sandstone in classical forms, to contrast with the industrial pieces of green steel framing system and the bright pink and blue steel handrails. • The building's most prominent feature is a central open-top rotunda. This outdoor, enclosed space houses the sculpture garden. It is circumvented by a public footpath and ramp that leads pedestrians through the site. This feature allows the public to reach the higher elevation behind the museum from the lower front of the building's main face.\n\n26.

UTOPIAN IDEAS\n\n29. • Utopia is derived form two Greek terms • ‘ou’ – meaning ‘not’ or ‘no’ • ‘topos’ – meaning ‘place’ • no – place • THE WORD WAS FIRST COINED BY SIR THOMAS MORE IN HIS BOOK ‘UTOPIA’ IN 1516\n\n30. • The built environment that we live in today was largely shaped by Modernism. The buildings we inhabit, the chairs we sit on, the graphic design that surrounds us have all been created by the aesthetics and the ideology of Modernist design. • Modernism was not conceived as a style but a loose collection of ideas. • It was a term which covered a range of movements and styles that largely rejected history and applie`d ornament, and which embraced abstraction. • Modernists had a utopian desire to create a better world. They believed in technology as the key means to achieve social improvement and in the machine as a symbol of that aspiration. • All of these principles were frequently combined with social and political beliefs (largely left-leaning) which held that design and art could, and should, transform society.\n\n31. Searching for utopia • The carnage of the First World War led to widespread utopian fervour, a belief that the human condition could be healed by new approaches to art and design – more spiritual, more sensual, or more rational. • The desire to connect art and life led to a spirit of collaboration between artists and designers, with architects playing a leading role. • Focusing on the most basic elements of daily life – housing and furniture, domestic goods and clothes – they reinvented these forms for a new century.\n\n32. Communist utopia • The Russian Revolution of 1917 set out to build utopia. • Art was to become part of everyday life, and technology was to be extended to its limits and beyond. • Avant-garde architects and artists threw themselves into the collective effort. They evolved new theories and institutions, developed new types of buildings and produced all kinds of innovative propaganda.\n\n33. Social utopia • Designers and artists working from a socialist perspective believed that utopia could be achieved within existing social and economic structures. • With new materials like glass, iron, and steel made available by the Industrial Revolution, modernist architects took to their drafting tables to imagine entirely new cities that supported utopian ideals and were devoid of the corrupted bourgeois sentiments often blamed for many of society's dilemmas. • Some utopian visions focused on new technology, others on open, untouched landscapes, and still others were based on new social orders, but all were united under radically avant-garde and cutting-edge architecture.\n\n34. Garden city- Core garden city principles: o Strong community o Ordered development o Environmental quality These were to be achieved by : • Unified ownership of land toprevent individual land. • Speculation and maximizecommuntiy benefits. • Careful planning to providegenerous living and workingspace while maintaining naturalqualities. • Social mix and good communityfacilities. • Limit to growth of each gardencity. • Local participation in decisionabout development. • The original • Garden city • Conceptby ebenezer howard, 1902\n\n35. • It is an ideal city industry isbalanced with agriculture,housing carefully distributed,and transport rationalised • Along with brickfields, factories and markets are children’s cottage homes,industrial schools, convalescent homes, asylums for the blind and deaf, and even afarm for epileptics. This is a city for the strong and weak, and where the weak growin strength.\n\n37. Le corbusier • La ville contemporaine (Concentric city) 1922 -Three zones • Central city • Protected green belt • Factories & satellite towns\n\n38. • Central city Rectangle containing two cross axial highways At its heart was a six-level transport interchange – centre for motor, rail lines (underground and main-line railways) and roof of which is air-field 24 cruciform skyscrapers – 60 storeyed office building with density 1200 ppa and covers 5% of the ground Surrounding skyscrapers was apartment district – 8 storey buildings arranged in zigzag rows with broad openspaces with density of 120 people.\n\n40. La ville radiuse (radiant city) • Le corbusier rearranged the key features of the Ville Contemporaine. • The basic ideas of free circulation and greenery were still present, but the just position of different land-uses had changed. • For example, the central area was now residential instead of a skyscraper office core.\n\n41. • The skyscrapers (business area) of the Ville Contemporaine were rearranged away from the city center at the ‘head’…The ‘body’ was made up of acres of housing strips laid out in a stepping plan to generate semi-courts and harbours of greenery containing tennis courts, playing fields and paths. • Traffic pattern – an orthogonal system with super imposed diagonals & the civic center is on the main axis • Light manufacturing, freight yards and heavy industries at the bottom\n\n43. • Through the 1920s and 1930s, modern “master” Le Corbusier experimented with a series of highly utopian urban planning concepts, stemming from his visions of an ideal city that hoped to reunite citizens with a highly ordered and open environment, elevating culture on a universal basis. • In 1925, he proposed the \"Plan Voisin,\" an idealistic mega-project that called for the bulldozing of central Paris and replacing it with monolithic 60- story towers set within an organized street grid and ample green space. • Corbusier believed the efficient plan could transform society by raising the standard of living for all socioeconomic levels, thus sparing the country another revolution. • The plan was outright rejected.\n\n44.

Tange Kenzo • The pursuit of new urbanism in Japan in the postwar period often took the form of utopian speculations that reflected currents of socio-ideological changes and diverse local conditions. • This dissertation examines the issue of utopianism in contemporary urbanism through an investigation of the Japanese Metabolist movement, and in particular, Tange Kenzo's works of urban design in the 1960s. • The utopian nature of Metabolism was manifested in Tange's seminal works during the 1960s: the Plan for Tokyo, Yamanashi Communications Center, the Redevelopment Plan for Skopje, and the Osaka Expo. • Serving as a polemical alternative to the official plans of Tokyo, this project posed itself to fundamentally transform its urban structure for the imminent arrival of a post-industrial age, and heralded the architect's later works\n\n70. • The design was a radical plan for the reorganization and expansion of the capital in order to cater for a population beyond 10 million • The design was for a linear city that used a series of nine kilometre modules that stretched 80 km across Tōkyō Bay from Ikebukuro in the north west to Kisarazu in the south east. • The perimeter of each of the modules was organised into three levels of looping highways, as Tange was adamant that an efficient communication system would be the key to modern living. • The modules themselves were organised into building zones and transport hubs and included office, government administration and retail districts as well as a new Tōkyō train station and highway links to other parts of Tōkyō. • Residential areas were to be accommodated on parallel streets that ran perpendicular to the main linear axis and like the Boston Bay project, people would build their own houses within giant A-frame structures. • plan incorporated three elements both on the land and the sea and included a looped highway that connected all the prefectures around the bay.\n\n71. Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower\n\n72. • Expo '70 was a world's fair held in Suita,Osaka, Japan between March 15 and September 13, 1970. • The theme of the Expo was \"Progress and Harmony for Mankind.\" In Japanese Expo '70 is often referred to asŌsaka Banpaku. • This was the first world's fair held in Japan. • The master plan for the Expo was designed by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange\n\n73. YONA FRIEDMAN-spatial city • The Spatial City is the most significant application of \"mobile architecture\". It is a spatial, three-dimensional structure raised up on piles which contains inhabited volumes, fitted inside some of the \"voids\", alternating with other unused volumes. It is designed on the basis of trihedral elements which operate as \"neighbourhoods\" where dwellings are freely distributed. • This structure introduces a kind of merger between countryside and city and may span: - certain unavailable sites, - areas where building is not possible or permitted (expanses of water, marshland), - areas that have already been built upon (an existing city), above farmland. • Raised plans increase the original area of the city becoming three-dimensional. The tiering of the spatial city on several independent levels, one on top of the other, determines \"spatial town-planning\" both from the functional and from the aesthetic viewpoint. • The tiering of the spatial city on several independent levels, one on top of the other, determines \"spatial town-planning\" both from the functional and from the aesthetic viewpoint."
