The Staatsgalerie Stuttgart (the State Gallery) is home to one of the finest art collections in Germany and is one of the country's most visited museums. Best known for its superlative collection of 20th-century paintings, the museum also boasts impressive collections of German Renaissance art as well as Dutch and Italian Masters from the 14th to 19th centuries. The three buildings that make up the Staatsgalerie are as interesting as its collections. The original building, the Alte Staatsgalerie (or Old Gallery), was designed in Neoclassical U-Bahn-style and opened in 1843. Adjoining is James Stirling's Neue Staatsgalerie (New Gallery), added in 1984 and a masterpiece of contemporary architecture. The central feature of the building is its rotunda, enclosed by three wings with roofs designed to admit light. The newest structure was added in 2002, a five-story building housing the Department of Prints, Drawings and Photographs. Architectural tours of the Staatsgalerie are highly recommended.
