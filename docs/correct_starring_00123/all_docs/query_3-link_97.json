He played Black revolutionary Duane aka Abdullah. It also starred the incomparable #RichardPryor, The Pointer Sisters, #GarrettMorris, Franklyn Ajaye, Ray Vitte, #GeorgeCarlin and Ivan Dixon.\n\n\"Car Wash\" was written by Joel Schumacher and directed by Michael Schultz.\n\nSome fun trivia about Car Wash:\n\n1.

Garrett Morris, best known as one of the \"Not Ready for Prime Time Players\" on Saturday Night Live (at the time), had appeared in another African American ensemble film (that later became a cult classic), Cooley High, the year before. Both are directed by Michael Schultz.\n4. The film takes place during a ten-hour period over the course of a day.\n5. Reverend Ike was a real-life preacher and inspiration for the Daddy Rich character. When Reverend Ike was unavailable for the film, they chose Richard Pryor, who filmed his role in two days.\n6. The movie's title song, \"Car Wash\", was a #1 chart-topping hit for Rose Royce, and was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 1970s disco music era. \n7. This movie was selected for the Palme D'Or competition at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. It won two awards at Cannes that year, the Technical Grand Prize (Michael Schultz) and Best Music (Norman Whitfield).\n8.
