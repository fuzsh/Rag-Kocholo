        "text": "1987\n\nCity Locations\n\nMismaloya (Mexico), Palenque (Mexico), Puerto Vallarta (Mexico)\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBeachfront, Exotic/Tropical, Helicopter\n\nAbout Predator\n\nPredator is a 1987 science-fiction/action movie helmed by John McTiernan and written by the Thomas brothers. The Predator series kicks off with this inaugural installment. Arnold Schwarzenegger takes the lead role as the commander of an elite paramilitary team, dispatched to rescue hostages in a Central American rainforest in Guatemala. There they encounter the strong extraterrestrial hunter known as The Predator (Kevin Peter Hall). The Predator will not rest until each member of the team has been hunted down.\n\nPredator was originally scripted in 1984, with the working title of Hunter. Production for this film ran from March to June 1986, with a budget of about $15 million. Stan Winston was responsible for creating the creature effects. On June 12, 1987, 20th Century Fox unleashed the movie in theaters across the United States and it quickly became a blockbuster sensation that grossed an astonishing $98 million worldwide! Initially, opinions on Predator were both positive and negative, yet it eventually gained a reputation as an iconic action/sci-fi movie and one of the most remarkable films from the 1980s. It even earned itself an Academy Award nomination for Visual Effects.\n\nPredator catapulted to success, becoming an expansive multimedia empire with movies, novels, comics, video game,s and toys. Four sequels followed: Predator 2 (1990), Predators (2010), The Predator (2018) and Prey (2022). The Alien franchise sparked two more films: the 2004 movie Alien vs. Predator, and its 2007 follow-up Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem.\n\nWhen Predator opened in cinemas on June 12, 1987, it held the top spot at the US Box Office with a weekend gross of $12 million, second only to Beverly Hills Cop II for that year.\n\nPredator Locations\n\nThe production and filming of Predator took place in a variety of locations all over Mexico. The majority of the scenes for this cult classic were shot in Mismaloya, Mexico, located on the south side of Puerto Vallarta. This tropical paradise serves as an ideal backdrop for the movie, with lush jungles and mountains providing a stunningly beautiful yet dangerous atmosphere. Close by is also Palenque, an ancient Mayan city that is one of the largest Mayan cities ever discovered and is an important tourist destination due to its impressive temples and monuments. Both these locations come together to create an environment that perfectly suits the movie's universe.\n\nThe combination of incredible natural beauty and ancient ruins makes a trip to these locations extremely worthwhile for any fan of Predator. The jungles that still surround Mismaloya today have retained much of their wild nature, creating a landscape that looks almost identical to what it did during shooting. Likewise, Palenque provides an amazing adventure with its marvelous architecture that still stands proud after centuries. A visit to these places will take you back in time to when Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura were battling it out against the alien hunter in this iconic movie.\n\nAn extraterrestrial vessel lands on Earth and releases a shuttle. Major Alan âDutchâ Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a former veteran of the Vietnam War, along with his military rescue teamâBlain (Jesse Ventura), Mac (Bill Duke), Hawkins (Shane Black), Poncho (Richard Chaves) and Billy (Sonny Landham)âare tasked to save a foreign cabinet minister and an aide from rebels located in South America. CIA agent Al Dillon, who was once Dutchâs comrade in arms during the war, forcibly joins the expedition despite Dutch's disapproval.\n\nThis scene was filmed in awe-inspiring Palenque, an archaeological marvel of the ancient Mayans, which lies in Chiapas, one of Mexico's most beautiful states. It was once an important center of Mayan civilization, and is renowned for its impressive ruins, which date back to the sixth century AD. The site features a number of intricate structures, including the Temple of Inscriptions, the Palace complex and two ball courts. Visitors can explore the magnificent architecture and carvings that are found throughout the siteâwhich are believed to represent ideas about politics, religion, and trade among other themesâand learn about this ancient civilisation's culture and way of life. Palenque is considered by many to be one of Mexico's most outstanding archaeological sites.\n\nYou can find Palenque around two-and-a-half hoursâ drive southeast of Villahermosa.\n\nOn their way to the guerilla camp, the team stumbles upon a crashed helicopter and three disfigured bodies. Dutch discovers that they were Green Berets he previously knew and starts to question Dillon's objective. They arrive at their destination only to find out that one of the hostages is about to be executed. Taking action, they launch an assault and are able to defeat most of the rebels as well as Soviet intelligence officers. During the encounter, Dutch confronts Dillon who reveals that their mission was actually intended to prevent a potential Soviet-backed invasion and that Green Berets were sent weeks earlier with the same agenda.\n\nThis scene was filmed at El Eden de Mismaloya, which is one of Mexico's most spectacular natural wonders. Located in the state of Jalisco, just south of Puerto Vallarta, El Eden de Mismaloya offers breathtaking views of a freshwater bay, framed by verdant mountains and dense vegetation. Home to an abundance of tropical wildlife, including howler monkeys and iguanas, the area around El Eden de Mismaloya is known for its excellent snorkeling and diving opportunities. From boat tours and fishing trips to hiking trails and ziplining adventures, there is something for everyone at this magnificent destination.\n\nGetting to El Eden de Mismaloya is relatively easy. You can take a flight to Puerto Vallarta and then arrange transportation to the area. Many tour companies offer trips from Puerto Vallarta to El Eden de Mismaloya, as well as guided tours and activities in the area. Alternatively, you can take a bus or rent a car and drive yourself. Either way, youâll be able to enjoy the crystal clear waters of the bay and explore the tropical rainforest that surrounds it.\n\nDesperate to draw the beast away from his companions, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sprints towards a muddy riverbank and covers himself with mud. The creature fails to detect him and goes off searching for trophies amongst its other victims. Seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, Dutch realizes that the chilly mud offers excellent concealment against body heat. He sets up handmade traps and arms himself with weapons before calling out a battle cry under the cover of darkness. He holds a burning torch in hand, thus attracting the alien's attention.\n\nSchwarznegger (or possibly his stunt double) plunges 100 feet down the Misol-Ha waterfall, only one mile west of Hwy 199, located 13 miles south of Palenque. Misol-Ha Waterfall lies in the Chiapas region of Mexico and is considered one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the country. At over 70 meters high, it cascades down a single stepped set of cliffs surrounded by lush jungles and wildlife. Visitors can take a break from hiking to admire the stunning view while they take a dip in the refreshing pool below, or can explore one of two nearby caves for a more adventurous experience. Most tours to Misol-Ha include stops at other natural wonders around Palenque such as Agua Azul or Yaxchilan, making it an essential destination for nature lovers visiting Mexico.\n\nGetting to the Misol-Ha Waterfall is relatively easy. The falls are located about half an hour from Palenque and can be accessed by car. Once at the entrance, youâll need to take a ten-minute hike through a tropical jungle before reaching the waterfall itself. If you opt for a guided tour, your guide will provide detailed instructions on how to reach Misol-Ha and answer any questions that you have along the way.\n\nDutch causes minor harm to the alien and deactivates its cloaking technology, prompting it to race into the forest in an attempt to escape. Unfortunately, the creature tumbles into a river, where the water washes away its camouflage. Underestimating Dutch's capabilities, the alien peels off its mask and plasma cannon then battles him using only hand-to-hand combat.\n\nNotwithstanding being overpowered and losing his advantage of surprise, Dutch tries bluffing it into stepping on a booby trap while he simultaneously triggers the trap himself and crushes the extraterrestrial, fatally wounding it. With its dying breaths, it poses the question to Dutch: \"What the hell are you?\" The creature activates its self-destruct bomb, with maniacal laughter echoing as it counts down before Dutch runs for cover and escapes before the explosion. Eventually he is rescued by an extraction helicopter carrying Anna (Elpidia Carrillo), having been traumatized by what just happened.\n\nThe Cascadas de Agua Azul in Mexico, near Palenque, are a breathtaking sight, and theyâre where this final scene was filmed. The clear blue waters of the river cascade down rocky walls and through lush vegetation, creating a stunning natural window into the surrounding jungle. As visitors explore the falls and swim in the cool crystal-clear water, they're presented with an unforgettable experience filled with relaxation and beauty. The nearby Cenote Azul is a pristine swimming pool that provides a unique way to experience the cascades up close. Nature lovers will revel in this hidden paradise, while adventure seekers can explore its many secrets and caves to uncover more wonders waiting to be discovered.\n\nGetting to the Cascadas de Agua Azul is relatively easy. The falls are located around 40 miles southwest of Palenque. If youâre flying to the region, the closest airport is Villahermosa International Airport, which is about three hours away by car."
