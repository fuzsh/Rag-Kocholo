        "text": "In his new autobiography, Bill Duke describes overcoming unimaginable racism growing up in the 1940s and '50s in Poughkeepsie, New York, to become a successful actor, director and writer.\n\nThe heart-breaking verbal assaults from white kids began on his first day of kindergarten at the Violet Avenue Elementary School. Returning home that day, the distraught child ran straight for the bathroom reaching for a bottle of cleaner “to scrub the black off my body,” he writes.\n\n“Unfortunately, I can still picture that day in my mind,” Duke, 75, recalled from his home in Los Angeles. “That first day at school was traumatic. People tell you to get over it, but you don’t.”\n\n“Bill Duke: My 40-Year Career on Screen and Behind the Camera” was released Nov. 15.\n\nFinding an escape\n\nDespite being beaten down — sometimes physically — throughout his youth, Duke’s talent was evident to his family, friends and teachers who would offer a helping hand in quite remarkable ways that seemed to guide Duke toward his destiny.\n\n“As a child, my parents would take me and my sister to see movies,” he recalled. “Of course, most actors were white and they were adored. Subliminally, you wanted to become a movie star, but they didn’t look like me so it was both encouraging and discouraging at the same time.”\n\nNevertheless, he was encouraged by the success of Sidney Poitier.\n\n“A black man in the time of segregation who had dignity, pride and self-respect gave young people hope that one day we might be treated the same.”\n\nThough his family didn’t have much money, a parade of uncles down on their luck were given shelter in Duke’s house — usually in Bill’s bedroom. Uncle Eddie left the biggest impression.\n\n“He was a hopeful actor and comedian,” he said. “He could sing and dance, but rejection crushed his dreams and he died before getting recognition or any real opportunities. Despite his failure, I’d listen to his stories and hoped one day I might succeed where he had not.”\n\nConfiscated journal brings surprise\n\nDuring his years at Roosevelt High School, Duke says he was not a good verbal communicator. So he kept a journal to record his thoughts which included poems he’d often jot down during English class. After several teacher warnings to close the journal, she confiscated the book incurring the young writer’s wrath.\n\n“Her name was Jean Walker and I hated her for taking away the book,” Duke admitted.\n\nBut as the classroom was emptying the day after returning from semester break, the teacher directed Duke to remain behind.\n\n“She handed me my journal and another book, which was a prize I’d won. Without me knowing, she had submitted some of my poems to a state poetry contest and I was one of the winners. It was the first time anyone outside of my family had done something so nice for me. So there I was, this angry black guy who was supposed to be hating white people, but this white teacher had faith in my ability. For the first time it gave me real hope that I could be successful.”\n\nCatching the acting bug\n\nAfter high school, Duke attended Poughkeepsie’s Dutchess Community College where another teacher encouraged him to enroll in drama classes. He still recalls the terror of his first play’s opening night, but also the satisfaction after receiving a standing ovation.\n\n“It was one of the most amazing times in my life and I think the moment I really caught the acting bug.”\n\nAfter received a Martin Luther King scholarship to attend Boston University, Duke’s parents encouraged him to choose teaching, not acting, as a career. One of the required courses involved studying Chaucer, the English poet from the Middle Ages. But the topic sent Duke to sleep – literally. Warned about his in-class snoring, he was banished from the course.\n\n“Once again, it turned out to be a blessing. A friend who knew I talked about acting suggested auditioning for the drama department. I was accepted and mentored by Lloyd Richards.”\n\nBut Boston University was expensive. Although his scholarship covered tuition, he soon ran out of money to pay for books, room and board and returned to Poughkeepsie where he planned to work for a year and save.\n\nOne day while visiting friends at his old community college, the college president called him into his office. He had heard Duke was dropping out of Boston University.\n\n“Dr. Hall was very strict, and no one liked him much, and I told him I was coming home to work. He said ‘No you’re not!’ and reached into his back pocket and pulled out an envelope containing a personal check for thousands of dollars — enough for me to finish at Boston!”\n\nBeing black on Broadway\n\nAfter graduating, Duke went on to study at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. His first acting job was in “Day of Absence,” performed by the Negro Ensemble Company, and in 1971 was on Broadway in “Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death.”\n\n“Being black in a Broadway play was magical, self-empowering and gave me more hope that I would succeed as an actor.”\n\nAnd he did, although there were rough spots along the way including unemployment and drug use. “Transcendental meditation saved my life and I still do it, twice a day, every day.”\n\nFrom 'Car Wash' to 'Predator'\n\nDuke’s first big screen first role was in the 1976 comedy-drama “Car Wash” and he appeared in popular TV shows of the '70s such as “Kojak,” “Starsky and Hutch” and “Charlie’s Angels.” By the '80s, he was directing TV series and films, and was often inspired by the directing style of Frank Capra.\n\n“He was a great storyteller with a camera, something I have always tried to be.”\n\nWith shaven head and standing over 6 foot 4, Duke was often cast in tough-guy roles, including two Arnold Schwarzenegger action hits from the '80s, “Commando” and “Predator,” the latter filmed in the brutally rugged Mexican jungle.\n\n“What do you do when you’re crawling on your stomach in the jungle surrounded by scorpions and with deadly coral snakes slithering by?” he asked. “You just keep filming! There were bugs and flies in our food, but after the second or third week we just called it protein!”\n\nIn addition to his presence in front of and behind the camera, Duke is the founder of the Duke Media Foundation that helps prepare young people for a career in all aspects of film, video and TV production.\n\n“A number of our kids are employed in the industry now and work at networks and studios,” said Duke proudly. “We teach them not to wait to be discovered, but to discover yourself.”\n\nDuke discovered himself long ago now, with a little help along the way from those who cared, and through his foundation is giving back to others so they may avoid the difficulties he faced.\n\nAnd what of those kindergarten bullies who taunted young Bill seven decades ago — did he ever run into them again?\n\n“No, but I’m older and bigger now, so it might not be pleasant if I did!” he says with a laugh. But then he pauses, suggesting a more conciliatory tone. “I’m fond of the old saying that revenge is a dish best served cold. So I’d just point to my success and leave it at that.”\n\nNick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery, Ala., and has written features, columns, and interviews for over 700 magazines and newspapers.
