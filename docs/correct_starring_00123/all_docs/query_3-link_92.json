        "text": "Bill Duke, actor, director, producer: I’m not mean, but when people come to me with excuses and stuff…I always say to them “Oh you have a lot of excuses. Life is hard, huh? Wow…hhmmm.”\n\nSometimes I tell them…”Come over here for a second.” I get in my car and I ride down the street. “Look to your left. Look to your right.” I say “Do you want that?” “Oh no!”\n\nI say “That’s the point I’m making. I’m not suggesting it’s easier. You’re not suffering. But do you want that?”\n\nI mean…ain’t got to look far you know. There’s suffering going on out here that’s…go down to 5th and Spring Street in [downtown Los Angeles]. You will see children crawling in and out of dumpsters for food.\n\nFilm Courage: So what do you think people under 25 or 30 not understand about success in Hollywood? Maybe they think “Oh, I’ll never be that.” You know how everybody always thinks “I could never end up like that.” And sometimes it’s just a matter of bad circumstances piled up (one after another) to lead someone there and they think “Well, I have a safety net. That would never happen to me.” But the general 25 to 30-year-old with a degree.\n\nBill Duke: Dreams that are planned are called frustration. There are two things I would address it with, one is the God joke. Do you know the God joke?\n\nFilm Courage: Tell God your plans…or is that John Lennon [quote: Life is what happens while you’re making other plans].\n\nBill Duke: No…that’s the God joke. Make God laugh, tell him your plans. And one thing I find with the younger generation now, a minister that is a friend of mine told me, he said “Bill, one day I stood up in church and I said to my congregation “Everybody who wants to go to heaven, stand up and sing Hallelujah!” A whole couch of 1,500 people got up and shouted for five to ten minutes. He had to calm them down. “Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Okay. Okay.” He said “My second question is, everyone who wants to die stand up and sing Hallelujah!” Everybody sat down."
