        "text": "Pilot\n\nLike any parents Andre Dre and Rainbow Johnson want to give their children the best. But their offspring's childhood is turning out to be much different than theirs. They now realize at least two things: there is a price to pay for giving their children more than what they ever had and these loving parents are totally unprepared for the fallout.\n\nThe Nod\n\nDre sets out to expand Andre Jr's social circle to include more black kids after he discovers Andre Jr. is clueless about \"the nod.\" Meanwhile, hoping to inspire little Diane to become a doctor, Rainbow takes her to work at the hospital--on what turns out to be the worst day ever.\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\nAlthough Dre and Rainbow agreed they would no longer spank their kids, all bets might be off when Jack disobeys. Now, Zoey, Junior, Diane and a nervous Jack are afraid that their parents will go back on their word.\n\nThe Prank King\n\nDre fears his holiday fun will be ruined when the older kids balk at the glorious Johnson Halloween tradition of seeing who can pull the most outlandish pranks on each other.\n\nColored Commentary\n\nDre wants the family to feel more connected so he encourages \"Team Johnson\" to embrace what it means to have each other's backs. But Dre creates trouble for himself when he falls short of Bow's expectations. Meanwhile, Bow and Dre invoke \"Team Johnson\" and put the less-than enthusiastic Zoey and Andre Jr. in charge of babysitting the twins."
