Bill Duke starred in a short film called \"The Vandal\". \"The Vandal\" was accepted into the Directors’ Fortnight at last year’s Festival de Cannes. And this year \"The Vandal\" will be screening in New Orleans this June at The Overlook Film Festival, presented by @watch_alter. A huge thank you to the committee Over Look Film Festival for including this film in their 2022 lineup. \n\nStarring Bill Duke, . Executive produced by Darren Aronofsky. Directed by @eddiealcazar. Produced alongside @javierlovato, DP @dannyhiele. Lead animator @bompsgarage. Composer @krisbowersmusic\n\nSynopsis: Set in a world not unlike mid-20th century America, THE VANDAL centers on Harold, whose tormented search for peace from traumatic loss results in an unexpectedly destructive awakening after he undergoes a lobotomy. When the procedure \"turns his mind inside out\" and his great love is suddenly gone, Harold's desperate search intensifies.\n\nLINK to the short film: https://vimeo.com/681971716\n\n#thenewyorker #realBillDuke #dukemediaentertainment #dukemediafoundation #YouniteNetwork #heidibfuller #TheVandal #shebaabrahaim #carlgilliard #MPJINews #carlgilliam #TedLange #williammichaelbarbee #torrencebrannonreese #sternmanproductions #darrenaronofsky @sydthewriter #TheOverlookFilmFestival #NewOrleans #festivals scanned\".",
