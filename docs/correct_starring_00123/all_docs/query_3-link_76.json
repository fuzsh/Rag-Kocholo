Known for his physically imposing frame, Duke's work frequently dwells within the action and crime drama genres but also appears in comedy. He often plays characters related to law enforcement.\n\nContents\n\nBill duke s actor bootcamp the piano lesson with corey jovan and thea marie perkins\n\nPortraits w bill duke november 8th 2013 black hollywood live\n\nEarly life and education\n\nFilm roles\n\nDirecting career\n\nTelevision appearances\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nPortraits w bill duke november 8th 2013 black hollywood live\n\nEarly life and education\n\nDuke was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, the son of Ethel Louise (née Douglas) and William Henry Duke Sr. He attended Franklin D. Roosevelt High School in Hyde Park and later received his first instruction in the performing arts and in creative writing at Dutchess Community College in Poughkeepsie. After graduation from Dutchess he went on to Boston University for further instruction in drama and for his B.A. After studying at New York University's Tisch School of Arts and the AFI Conservatory, he appeared on Broadway in the 1971 Melvin Van Peebles musical Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death. He directed episodes of several noteworthy 1980s television series, including Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice.\n\nFilm roles\n\nStanding an imposing 6 ft 4½ in and featuring a closely shaved head, Duke first became a familiar face to moviegoers in Car Wash (1976) where he portrayed fierce young Black Muslim revolutionary Abdullah Mohammed Akbar (formerly known as Duane), and expanded his repertoire with American Gigolo (1980) where he played a gay pimp.\n\nAs the action-film-oriented genre became more popular, Duke's presence was perfect to portray a string of \"tough guy\" roles. He notably worked opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in both Commando and Predator, followed by a role as a police chief in the 1988 Carl Weathers vehicle Action Jackson. Duke appeared uncredited as a DEA officer in The Limey (1999), as well as a police chief opposite Steven Seagal in Exit Wounds. He played a detective investigating a murder in Menace II Society, in which he delievered the often-quoted line, \"You done fucked up, you know that, don't you?\". He played a corrupt law enforcement agent in two films opposite Mel Gibson - Bird on a Wire (as an FBI agent) and Payback (as a police detective). Duke appears in X-Men: The Last Stand as Trask, Washington in National Security, Levar in Get Rich or Die Tryin' and Nokes in Bad Country.\n\nDirecting career\n\nDuke directed the TV movie The Killing Floor in 1985. He began directing theatrical films in the 1990s with crime dramas A Rage in Harlem (1991), Deep Cover (1992) and Hoodlum (1997). He also directed The Cemetery Club (1993) and Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993), starring Whoopi Goldberg. For television, Duke directed the A&E Network original film, The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2000). In 2007 he directed the reenactments in the award-winning, PBS-broadcast documentary Prince Among Slaves produced by Unity Productions Foundation. Duke continues to act and direct for both the small and silver screens. He is also a mentor for young African Americans aspiring to work in the performance arts.\n\nDuke teamed with screenwriter Bayard Johnson to co-produce Cover, a 2007 film which explores the HIV epidemic.\n\nTelevision appearances\n\nDuke made an early appearance on Kojak as Sylk in the episode \"Bad Dude\", in the third season of the series. He guest-starred in the fourth episode of Lost in its third season as Warden Harris, in the episode \"Every Man for Himself\". He also guest-starred in Battlestar Galactica in the season two episode \"Black Market\".\n\nDuke had a starring role in the short-lived TV series Palmerstown, USA, produced by Norman Lear and Roots author, Alex Hailey. Although the series was critically acclaimed and won an Emmy, it ran for only 17 episodes in the 1980-81 television season.\n\nDuke was cast as recurring character Capt. Parish in the action television series/crime drama Fastlane. He made a guest appearance on Baisden After Dark in the episode broadcast on July 18, 2008 and guest-starred on Cold Case as Grover Boone, a corrupt politician, in the 2008 episode \"Street Money\".\n\nDuke voiced a detective in the episode \"Thank You for Not Snitching\" of the animated television series The Boondocks. The character and his entire scene were references to Menace II Society.\n\nDuke also appears in Busta Rhymes' music video \"Dangerous\".\n\nDuke also appears in an episode of Law and Order SVU as a lawyer.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n-\n\nPremonition (completed) as\n\nDonald Carter\n\n2022\n\nGaslit (TV Mini Series) as\n\nCharles Anderson\n\n- California (2022) - Charles Anderson\n\n2021\n\nThe Oval (TV Series) as\n\nCurtis\n\n- Doomsday (2021) - Curtis\n\n- Like a Boss (2021) - Curtis\n\n2021\n\nJhon Jatenjor's Interviews (TV Series) as\n\nCelebrity Guest\n\n- BILL DUKE promociona No Sudden Move, Duke Media Foundation, Younite Network y su Nuevo Libro (2021) - Celebrity Guest\n\n2021\n\nThe Vandal (Short) as\n\nHarold\n\n2021\n\nNo Sudden Move as\n\nAldrick Watkins\n\n2018\n\nBlack Lightning (TV Series) as\n\nAgent Percy Odell\n\n- Painkiller (2021) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of War: Chapter Three: Liberation (2020) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of War: Chapter Two: Freedom Ain't Free (2020) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of War: Chapter One: Homecoming (2020) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Markovia: Chapter Two: Lynn's Addiction (2020) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Markovia: Chapter One: Blessings and Curses Reborn (2020) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Resistance: Chapter One: Knockin' on Heaven's Door (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Occupation: Chapter Five: Requiem for Tavon (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Occupation: Chapter Four: Lynn's Ouroboros (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Occupation: Chapter Three: Agent Odell's Pipe-Dream (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Occupation: Chapter Two: Maryam's Tasbih (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Occupation: Chapter One: Birth of the Blackbird (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of the Apocalypse: Chapter Two: The Omega (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of the Apocalypse: Chapter One: The Alpha (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Secrets: Chapter Four: Original Sin (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Secrets: Chapter Three: Pillar of Fire (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Secrets: Chapter Two: Just and Unjust (2019) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Consequences: Chapter Three: Master Lowry (2018) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Consequences: Chapter Two: Black Jesus Blues (2018) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n- The Book of Consequences: Chapter One: Rise of the Green Light Babies (2018) - Agent Percy Odell\n\n2020\n\nGhost Tape (Podcast Series) as\n\nByron Dixon\n\n- Session 8 (2020) - Byron Dixon\n\n- Session 5 (2020) - Byron Dixon\n\n- Session 3 (2020) - Byron Dixon\n\n- Session 2 (2020) - Byron Dixon\n\n- Session 1 (2020) - Byron Dixon\n\n2020\n\nTwo Degrees (TV Series) as\n\nBill\n\n- U.B.E.R.
