        "text": "In his autobiography “Bill Duke: My 40-Year Career on Screen and Behind the Camera,” to be released on Nov. 15, the author describes overcoming racism growing up in the 1940s and 50s in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to become a successful actor, director and writer.\n\nDespite being beaten down — sometimes physically — throughout his youth, Duke’s talent was evident to his family, friends and teachers who would offer a helping hand in quite remarkable ways that seemed to guide Duke toward his destiny.\n\n“As a child, my parents would take me and my sister to see movies,” Duke, 75, recalled from his home in Los Angeles. “Of course, most actors were white and they were adored. Subliminally, you wanted to become a movie star, but they didn’t look like me so it was both encouraging and discouraging at the same time.”\n\nNevertheless, he was encouraged by the success of Sidney Poitier.\n\n“A black man in the time of segregation who had dignity, pride and self-respect gave young people hope that one day we might be treated the same.”\n\nDuring high school, Duke was one of the winners of a state poetry contest when his teacher submitted some of poems — unbeknownst to Duke.\n\n“It was the first time anyone outside of my family had done something so nice for me. So there I was, this angry black guy who was supposed to be hating white people, but this white teacher had faith in my ability. For the first time it gave me real hope that I could be successful.”\n\nAfter high school, Duke attended Poughkeepsie’s Dutchess Community College, then Boston University where he studied drama. But Boston University was expensive. Although a scholarship covered tuition, he soon ran out of money to pay for books, room and board and returned to Poughkeepsie to work for a year and save.\n\nOne day while visiting friends at his old community college, the college president called him into his office. He had heard Duke was dropping out of Boston University.\n\n“Dr. Hall was very strict, and no one liked him much, and I told him I was coming home to work. He said ‘No you’re not!’ and reached into his back pocket and pulled out an envelope containing a personal check for thousands of dollars — enough for me to finish at Boston!”\n\nAfter graduating, Duke went on to study at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts and by 1971 found his way to Broadway. “Being black in a Broadway play was magical, self-empowering and gave me more hope that I would succeed as an actor.”\n\nAnd he did, although there were rough spots along the way, including unemployment and drug use. “Transcendental meditation saved my life and I still do it, twice a day, every day,” he said.\n\nDuke’s first big screen first role was in the 1976 comedy-drama “Car Wash” and he appeared in popular TV shows of the '70s such as “Kojak,” “Starsky and Hutch” and “Charlie’s Angels.” By the '80s, he was directing TV series and films.\n\nWith shaven head and standing over 6-foot-4, Duke was often cast in tough-guy roles, including two Arnold Schwarzenegger action hits from the '80s, “Commando” and “Predator,” the latter filmed in the brutally rugged Mexican jungle.\n\n“What do you do when you’re crawling on your stomach in the jungle surrounded by scorpions and with deadly coral snakes slithering by?” he asked. “You just keep filming! There were bugs and flies in our food, but after the second or third week we just called it protein!”\n\nIn addition to his presence in front of and behind the camera, Duke is the founder of the Duke Media Foundation that helps prepare young people for a career in all aspects of film, video and TV production (see www.dukemediafoundation.org).\n\n“A number of our kids are employed in the industry now and work at networks and studios,” said Duke proudly. “We teach them not to wait to be discovered, but to discover yourself.”\n\nDuke discovered himself long ago now, with a little help along the way from those who cared. Through his Foundation he’s giving back to others so they may avoid the difficulties he faced."
