        "text": "\"No­body is go­ing to give you any­thing. If you're se­ri­ous, stop wait­ing to be dis­cov­ered and dis­cov­er your­self,\" said Amer­i­can ac­tor and di­rec­tor Bill Duke, asked what ad­vice he would give to young film­mak­ers.\n\nDuke al­so said ed­u­ca­tion was im­por­tant to artis­tic de­vel­op­ment.\n\n\"The sec­ond thing I would say is study the dis­ci­pline of film­mak­ing. Your dreams and your wish­es, with­out in­fra­struc­ture, are frus­tra­tion.\n\n\"Study the tech­ni­cal dis­ci­pline of mak­ing movies and telling sto­ries. Think about how you tell a com­pelling sto­ry, about how you tell a sto­ry where peo­ple care about the char­ac­ters. A sto­ry to make them cry and make them think. It's not easy to do, so I would sug­gest that you study the craft,\" he said.\n\nDuke is in Trinidad for the T&T Film Fes­ti­val, which con­tin­ues un­til Oc­to­ber 1.\n\nDuke, who has a more than 30-year ca­reer in tele­vi­sion and film, led the Di­rec­tor's Boot Camp work­shop on Sep­tem­ber 20 and 21 that dealt with the fun­da­men­tals of di­rect­ing, but al­so cov­ered the im­por­tance of new me­dia. Dur­ing an in­ter­view with the T&T Guardian at the Hy­att Re­gency, Port-of-Spain, Duke shed some light on his mes­sage to di­rec­tors.\n\n\"We're talk­ing about the par­a­digm shift in our in­dus­try from film and TV to me­dia. If you're not aware of that shift, you're not go­ing to sur­vive,\" he said.\n\nDuke said new me­dia pre­sent­ed an op­por­tu­ni­ty for par­tic­u­lar­ly un­der­rep­re­sent­ed voic­es in film and TV to be heard. He said when he start­ed his ca­reer in the 1970s, there weren't many black ac­tors or di­rec­tors to em­u­late in Hol­ly­wood. While there are a few more op­por­tu­ni­ties now, Duke said there is still work to do to lev­el the play­ing field.\n\n\"I still think there's a ceil­ing. I think that what new me­dia and tech­nol­o­gy has done is break in­to that ceil­ing with a glob­al per­spec­tive. And with film fes­ti­vals like this, films that would not be seen any place else are seen here and pro­mot­ed, and that's a great op­por­tu­ni­ty.\"\n\nDuke's work as a di­rec­tor has fo­cused heav­i­ly on telling poignant sto­ries from the African-Amer­i­can and African di­as­po­ra com­mu­ni­ties through his com­pa­ny Duke Me­dia. In 2011, he teamed up with D Channsin Berry to work on the doc­u­men­tary Dark Girls, which dealt with is­sues of skin colour and dis­crim­i­na­tion in the black com­mu­ni­ty. Dark Girls was re­cent­ly screened on the ca­ble chan­nel OWN and won the Au­di­ence Choice Award at the Pan African Film Fes­ti­val in 2012.\n\nThe doc­u­men­tary fo­cused on the neg­a­tive per­cep­tions of dark-skinned black women, but Duke shared that he too has faced dis­crim­i­na­tion as a dark-skinned black man.\n\n\"I've been very for­tu­nate to have a ca­reer as long as I have be­cause I'm a big, black, dark per­son and they were afraid of me and as­sumed I was dan­ger­ous. So in or­der for me to get work, I had to re­al­ly work hard,\" said Duke, who grew up in New York.\n\n\"I didn't go to my se­nior prom, and I was called every name that you could ever think of: dark­ie, black­ie, tar ba­by sam­bo. I was con­stant­ly fight­ing, but I was big enough to beat every­body up.\n\nYou have to fight for your val­ues. My par­ents want­ed me to stand up for my­self be­cause in those days it was bru­tal.\"\n\nHe added that the doc­u­men­tary was im­por­tant be­cause racial bul­ly­ing con­tin­ued to be a prob­lem.\n\n\"As film­mak­ers what we do is present con­tent to cre­ate di­a­logue and hope­ful­ly that di­a­logue will lead in the di­rec­tion of heal­ing. That's why it has to be dis­cussed, be­cause there are lit­tle girls right now who are go­ing through that same thing and the play­ground is a very cru­el place. This racial bul­ly­ing has to stop.\"\n\nTo fol­low up Dark Girls, Duke will be work­ing on three doc­u­men­taries: Yel­low Brick Road, What is a Man? and What is a Woman? Yel­low Brick Road will ex­am­ine the ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion of light-skinned black women, while What is a Man? and What is a Woman? look at the evo­lu­tion of man­hood and wom­an­hood from so­ci­o­log­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal and an­thro­po­log­i­cal points of view.\n\nOn Sep­tem­ber 20, Duke did in­ter­views for all three doc­u­men­taries in and around Port-of-Spain by speak­ing to peo­ple in the street as well as so­ca artists, co­me­di­ans and oth­er lo­cal per­son­al­i­ties. All three doc­u­men­taries are ex­pect­ed to be fin­ished be­tween the end of 2014 and be­gin­ning of 2015.\n\nDuke has made oth­er films that deal with so­cial is­sues af­fect­ing the African-Amer­i­can com­mu­ni­ty such as Black Di­a­monds, which tells the his­to­ry of African-Amer­i­cans in base­ball.\n\n\"My com­pa­ny fo­cus­es on edu­tain­ment and what we mean by that is we en­ter­tain peo­ple and si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly present is­sues that are rel­e­vant glob­al­ly to so­ci­ety–not tell peo­ple what to think, but give them the con­text with­in which to think about those is­sues.\n\n\"If that's ac­tivism, then yes, I'm an ac­tivist. I can't say that all artists should be ac­tivists, but I would hope so. I think that me­dia is a very im­por­tant tool and there are some prob­lems we're fac­ing that to me are ur­gent.\"\n\nMore about Duke:\n\nBill Duke is an Amer­i­can ac­tor and di­rec­tor. He has starred in such movies as Com­man­do, Preda­tor, Men­ace II So­ci­ety, X-Men the Last Stand and get Rich or Die Tryin'.\n\nOn tele­vi­sion, Duke has ap­peared on such shows as Cold Case, The Boon­docks, Bat­tlestar Galac­ti­ca and Lost.\n\nAs a di­rec­tor some of his no­table work in­cludes Sis­ter Act: Back in the Habit and the PBS doc­u­men­tary se­ries Prince Among Slaves.
