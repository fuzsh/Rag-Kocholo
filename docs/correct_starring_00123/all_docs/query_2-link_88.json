        "text": "Robert Townsend, Bill Duke To Guest Star On Black Lightning Season 2Posted by Wilson Morales\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nThe CW has announced that Robert Townsend and Bill Duke will guest star in multiple episodes on the second season of Black Lightning, which premieres October 9 on The CW. Black Lightning is new on Tuesdays at 9/8c and available next day on The CW App.\n\nTownsend will play Napier Frank, a school board official and old friend of Jefferson’s, whose help he needs to sway a board vote to shut down Garfield High.\n\nDuke will play Agent Odell, a government agent who investigates the Green Light Babies and comes into conflict with Lynn (Christine Adams).\n\nJefferson Pierce (Cress Williams) is a man wrestling with a secret. As the father of two daughters and principal of a charter high school that also serves as a haven for young people in a neighborhood overrun by gang violence, he is a hero in his community. Nine years ago, Pierce was a hero of a different sort. Gifted with the superhuman power to harness and control electricity, he used those powers to keep his hometown streets safe as the masked vigilante Black Lightning. After too many nights with his life on the line, and seeing the effects of the damage and loss that his alter ego was inflicting on his family, he left his Superhero days behind and settled into being a principal and a dad.\n\nChoosing to help his city without using his superpowers, he watched his daughters Anissa (Nafessa Williams) and Jennifer (China Anne McClain) grow into strong young women, even though his marriage to their mother, Lynn (Christine Adams), suffered. Almost a decade later, Pierce’s crime-fighting days are long behind him…or so he thought. But with crime and corruption spreading like wildfire, and those he cares about in the crosshairs of the menacing local gang The One Hundred, Black Lightning returns – to save not only his family but also the soul of his community.\n\n“The Book of Consequences: Chapter One: Rise of the Green Light Babies” – (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET)\n\nJefferson Pierce (Cress Williams) and his family may have survived Tobias’s (Marvin Jones III) attack, but they’re not out of the woods yet. Concerned for the safety of Garfield’s students, the board considers a motion to shut down the school, forcing Jefferson to go to Napier Frank (guest star Robert Townsend) to sway the vote. Jennifer (China Anne McClain) struggles with her powers and her actions have unforeseen repercussions. Meanwhile, Anissa (Nafessa Williams) finds a new way to give back to Freeland. Lastly, Lynn (Christine Adams) continues her quest much to the dismay of Agent Odell (guest star Bill Duke). Damon Gupton and James Remar also star. The episode was directed and written by Salim Akil (#201). Original airdate 10/9/2018.\n\nMarvin Krondon Jones III, Jordan Calloway, Damon Gupton and James Remar also star.\n\nBased on the characters from DC Comics, Black Lightning is from Berlanti Productions and Akil Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, with executive producers Greg Berlanti, Salim Akil, Mara Brock Akil and Sarah Schechter. The Black Lightning character was created by Tony Isabella with Trevor Von Eeden."
