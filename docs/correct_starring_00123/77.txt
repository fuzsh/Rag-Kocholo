Bill Duke is an American actor, director and writer born in Poughkeepsie, New York on February 26, 1943. The shaven headed, imposing looking African-American actor has a distinct look and is probably best known for his high-octane action movies of the mid 1980s.

Having initially broken into television in the early 80's he directed popular TV shows including Miami Vice, Cagney & Lacey and Hill Street Blues.

It wasn't until the mid 80's when he starred alongside Schwarzenegger in Commando (1985) and unlucky US Special Forces soldier "Mac", in Predator (1987). Duke directed his first feature film with the crime drama, A Rage in Harlem in 1991 which was followed by the crime drama Deep Cover in 1992, and the comedy sequel, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit in 1993.

Duke has continued to divide his talent between appearing both in front and behind of the camera, and remains a dynamic, stimulating and creative influence in Hollywood and Television.

Recently Duke has appeared on TV as Capt. Bob Parish in Fastlane, Amos Andrews in Karen Sisco and Phelan in Battlestar Galactica. Duke was also cast as Bolivar Trask in the X-Men: The Last Stand.
