        "text": "By ROBERT PALMER\n\n© Estate of Andy Warhol Related Articles\n\n• Special Feature: Remembering John Lennon\n\nSlide Show\n\n•John Lennon, 1940-1980 (12 photos)\n\nhe Beatles united a generation of young people with their songs, their attitudes and their sense of style, and John Lennon was the thinking man's Beatle.\n\nOf the four, he was the Beatle who wrote books, the Beatle who embroiled the group in a potentially disastrous controversy by suggesting in an interview that they were more popular than Jesus, the Beatle who embraced the poetic innovations of Bob Dylan in the mid-1960's and shocked Beatles fans by jumping into performance art, happenings and political protests in the late 60's and early 70's.\n\nHe was the Beatle who announced, in one of his first solo albums after the breakup of the Beatles, that \"The Dream Is Over\" - the dream of community through peace, love, mysticism and psychedelic drugs that the Beatles had encouraged and advertised.\n\nNever Lost Sight of Dream\n\nAnd yet, paradoxically, Lennon never lost sight of that dream. \"The media are saying that the 60's were stupid and naive,\" he remarked in an interview only a month ago. \"But look at how much of what was sniggered about in the 60's has become mainstream -health food, therapies and all the rest. And love and peace weren't invented in the 60's. What about Gandhi? What about Christ? The naivete is to buy the idea that the 60's were naive.\"\n\nTo protest Britain's involvement in the Nigerian civil war and British support of the United States' role in Vietnam, Lennon, named a Member of the Order of British Empire by Queen Elizabeth in 1965, returned his award. The award, the lowest of five divisions of the order, was presented to the four Beatles for service to their country.\n\nInfluenced by U.S. Rockers\n\nJohn Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940, in Liverpool, England. In his early teens he felt the full force of Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis - the earliest American rock and roll. When he was 15, he organized his first rock and roll group, the Quarrymen, continuing it after he entered art school, enlisting the services of Paul McCartney and George Harrison, and later Ringo Starr.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1962 the group (renamed the Silver Beatles and later the Beatles) worked steadily in the port cities of Liverpool and Hamburg, West Germany. In 1961 they came to the attention of Brian Epstein, who secured a recording contract for them, plotted and executed their conquest of Europe, and arranged their first tour of the United States early in 1964.\n\nLennon and Paul McCartney were the group's lead vocalists and songwriters, and as the Beatles grew more and more popular worldwide, their songs grew more complex. By the mid-60's the Beatles were leaders of a worldwide rock movement that believed music with a beat could and should be intelligent and innovative as well.\n\nThe Beatles were the first popular rock and roll band to write their own material, to address a range of serious subjects and to embrace influences that ranged from Dylan's folk poetry to Indian classical music to Karlheinz Stockhausen's electronic sound collages. They changed the face of popular music, and popular culture, radically and irrevocably.\n\nSongs of Conflict and Confusion\n\nBeginning with the mid-60's album \"Rubber Soul,\" the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership began to unravel. McCartney began concentrating on pure pop, contributing ballads like \"Michelle\" and \"Eleanor Rigby.\" Lennon wrote more complex songs, embodying the conflicts he was feeling acutely as a Beatle: between his private life as an intellectual and an artist and his public persona; between his role as a pop musician and a generational spokesman, and the unresolved personal problems of his childhood.\n\nOut of this turmoil came exquisite songs of euphoria and confusion (\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"), some of the first and best examples of pop surrealism (\"I Am The Walrus\" and \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\"), and electronic experiments that prefigured Lennon's later collaborations with the conceptual artist Yoko Ono.\n\nMarried Miss Ono in 1969\n\nLennon met Miss Ono in 1966 and by 1969, when they married, their romance was being blamed for the disintegration of the Beatles, who officially disbanded in 1970. The couple's demystification of the Beatles began with their \"Two Virgins\" album, with its celebrated cover showing them nude, and continued with a series of albums that grafted Miss Ono's experimental and sometimes intensely grating vocal techniques onto Lennon's sensibility.\n\nThe music was dismissed by most critics and fans at the time, but it has been an important influence on some of the brightest talents in the most recent wave of rock performers.\n\nHis post-Beatles albums continued to mirror his internal struggles, particularly \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), which followed several months of \"primal scream\" therapy with Arthur Janov and included songs that attempted to exorcise childhood traumas. But Lennon was also, and perhaps first of all, one of the most tale nted pop tunesmiths of modern times, as he proved with the subsequent albums \"Imagine\" (1971) and \"Mind Games\" (1973).\n\nIn 1975, after recording an album of rock and roll oldies that he recently expressed some dissatisfaction with, Lennon stopped making records to concentrate on rearing the his and Yoko's son, Sean, who is now 5 years old. ( Lennon also has a son, Julian, by his first wife, Cynthia).\n\nIn his own words, he was a \"househusband,\" tending to domestic duties while Miss Ono supervised the couple's investments and other business matters.\n\nFinally, in August, the Lennons began making a new album, \"Double Fantasy,\" which was released by Geffin Records last month and is now in the national top 20. Lennon's first new single in five years, in the top 10, is optimistically titled \"Starting Over.\"\n\nThe album was conceived as a \"dialogue on love,\" with songs by Lennon alternating with songs by Miss Ono."
