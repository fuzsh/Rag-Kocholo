        "text": "Paul McCartney has added a new wrinkle to the making of The Beatles’ classic tune “A Day In The Life.”\n\nThe Telegraph is reporting the McCartney writes in his new book, The Lyrics: 1956 to the Present, that he wrote the lyrics to the song, not John Lennon, and that the song is about Tara Browne and the car crash the ended the Guinness heir’s life at age 21.\n\nNME noted, “[McCartney] had previously been quoted in a 1997 biography ‘Many Years From Now’ as denying that the song was inspired by Browne.” The outlet quoted McCartney from the biography saying, “[The lyrics have] been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don’t believe is the case. In my head, I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who’d stopped at some traffic lights and didn’t notice that the lights had changed”\n\nThe Lyrics: 1956 to the Present is due out on November 2 and is currently available for pre-order here.\n\nBeatles: Top 50 Songs Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
