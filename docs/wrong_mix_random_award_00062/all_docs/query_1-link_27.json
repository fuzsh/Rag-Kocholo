        "text": "The book’s prologue takes us back to December 6, 1980 with John’s assassin — Mark David Chapman — making his way from Hawaii to New York with the sole purpose of killing Lennon. I have to say that reading this was spine-chilling. Based on what they could find in reports and case files, the authors went into what could have been Chapman’s thoughts and actions at the time and used them to tell the story. The prologue ends with Chapman telling the cab driver “I’m Mark Chapman. Remember my name if you hear it again.” I honestly don’t know if he did say these words to the driver or if they were part of the authors’ creative license but they sure gave me the chills.\n\nThe book then takes us further back in time to the moment when John met Paul McCartney back in 1957, and they were 17 and 15 years old respectively. And from then on, we travel through the years — from when they were The Quarrymen, to the first Beatles single (Love Me Do), to becoming one of the greatest music bands of all time, and to its final days — including the iconic photoshoot at the zebra crossing on Abbey Road.\n\nWhether you are a Beatles or a John Lennon fan or not, this is definitely an interesting read. Even if you’ve read other books about The Beatles, or a Lennon biography, it is most likely that in this book you will find something that you didn’t know before. I would have liked a different title for it though — one that could encompass the thoroughness of its content. Maybe the authors thought of it as a way to differentiate it from other books about Lennon. I’ll most likely never know the answer, but it is a great read, and as a hard core Beatles fan I was pleased to read a good book about them… and in which in fact I did learn things that I didn’t know before."
