        "text": "Here come the sons.\n\nSixty-two years after The Beatles released their debut single in the UK, 1962’s “Love Me Do,” as the first of many classic songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, their offspring have come together to bring back their tune-making magic.\n\n“Primrose Hill,” the new single by James McCartney — Sir Paul’s only son, with his late wife Linda — was co-written by Sean Ono Lennon, John’s youngest son from his marriage to Yoko Ono.\n\nAnd the next generation does their papas proud on this wistful beauty of a ballad that recalls some of the nostalgic reverie of “Now and Then” — which was released to much fanfare in November as the last Beatles song (and their first new tune since 1996).\n\nDropped on Friday, “Primrose Hill” — which is a public park north of Regent’s Park in London — is the first-ever collaboration between McCartney, 46, and Lennon, 48.\n\nAnd if any song could sound just like taking a bittersweet stroll in the park with nothing but your longing memories, then this one pretty much captures it.\n\nThere’s instantly something familiar about it — both the dreamy moodiness and McCartney’s lilting delivery — but it never seems to fall into Beatles mimicry.\n\nNor does it ever reach the reach the heights of Beatles transcendence — I mean, how could it?\n\nThe lyrics almost border on lovesick cliche at one point: “Forever’s not long enough to be loving you/Forever and a day/I look into your eyes, it’s such a great surprise/You take my breath away.”\n\nBut if you just lose yourself in the warm, woozy feeling, you’ll get over that.\n\nAnd the bluesy guitar that comes in at the end adds a nice bite to the bliss.\n\n“ ‘Primrose Hill’ is here!” McCartney wrote in a post on Instagram, alongside a photo of him and Lennon. “Today I am so very excited to share my latest song co-written by my good friend @sean_ono_lennon.”"
