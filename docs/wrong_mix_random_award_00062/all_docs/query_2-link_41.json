        "text": "What inspired 'Imagine' and what is its meaning?\n\nLennon was inspired by several poems from wife Yoko Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit.\n\nOne poem, which Capitol Records later reproduced on the back cover of the original Imagine album titled 'Cloud Piece', reads: \"Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in.\"\n\nLennon later explained that the song \"should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it – the lyric and the concept – came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit.\"\n\nHe had also been given by Dick Gregory a Christian prayer book, which also inspired the main concept of the song.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, the National Music Publishers' Association announced that Yoko Ono would finally be added as a songwriter for 'Imagine'.\n\nThis occurred at a ceremony where Ono was given the Centennial award for her contribution, which was followed by a Patti Smith cover of the song.\n\nWhen did Lennon write 'Imagine'?\n\nLennon composed the song one morning in early 1971.\n\nIt was written on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park home in Ascot.\n\nYoko Ono watched on as he composed the melody, chords and most of the lyrics, and nearly completed the whole song in one short writing session.\n\nWhere was 'Imagine' recorded?\n\nLennon and Ono co-produced the song with Phil Spector, who later said: \"We knew what we were going to do. It was going to be John making a political statement, but a very commercial one as well.\n\n\"I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem.\"\n\nLennon later described working with Ono and Spector: \"Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that—[Ono] and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'. I'll get the initial idea and we'll just find a sound from there.\"\n\nThe recording occurred on May 27, 1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, which was Lennon's new home studio at Tittenhurst Park.\n\nStrings were then added on July 4, 1971, at the Record Plant, in New York City.\n\nThe final recording featured Lennon on piano and vocals, Klaus Voormann on bass guitar, Alan White on drums and the Flux Fiddlers on strings.\n\nWhere was the music video filmed?\n\nImagine - John Lennon and The Plastic Ono Band (with the Flux Fiddlers)\n\nThe song's famous music video was part of an 81-minute film to accompany the Imagine.\n\nIt featured footage of the couple at their home and the recording studio of their Berkshire property at Tittenhurst Park, as well as shots taken in New York City.\n\nThe famous 'Imagine' segment of the film shows Lennon sitting at his white grand piano in an all-white room.\n\nOno walks around opening curtains that bring in light, making the room brighter as the song plays on. At the end, Ono sits next to Lennon at the piano, and they share a friendly look and a quick kiss.\n\nMany celebrities of the time appeared in the film, including Andy Warhol, Fred Astaire, Jack Palance, Dick Cavett and George Harrison.\n\nHow did it perform in the charts?\n\nIn 1971, it reached number one in Canada and number three in the US. However, it wasn't released as a single in the UK until 1975, where it reached number six.\n\nAfter Lennon's murder in 1980, the single re-entered the UK charts, and reached number one, where it stayed for four weeks in January 1981.\n\nIt was re-released as a single in the UK in 1988, peaking at number 45, and again in 1999, reaching number three.\n\nTo date, it has sold over 1,640,000 copies in the UK, making it Lennon's best-selling single as a solo artist.\n\nGeorge Michael owned the famous piano\n\nIn 2000, George Michael paid over $2 million for the piano that Lennon wrote 'Imagine' on.\n\nHe then returned it to the Beatles museum in Liverpool, and has since been \"on tour\" to various world locations promoting peace.\n\nRead more: How George Michael came to own John Lennon's piano, and where it is now\n\nGeorge said at the time: \"Even though I now own the piano personally, I don’t see any good reason for not leaving it with the people of Liverpool. It’s something that should be looked at, marveled at. So it will be back in the museum there soon. But first I want to write something on it.\"\n\nWho has covered it?\n\nQueen - imagine ( Live In 1980 ) - (Video)\n\nMANY artists!\n\nHere are just a handful of times it has been covered:\n\n- Elton John performed the song regularly on his world tour in 1980.\n\n- Queen performed a cover on December 9, 1980, the day after Lennon's murder, as a tribute to him during their Wembley Arena show in London.\n\n- David Bowie performed it in 1983 in Hong Kong, on the third anniversary of Lennon's death.\n\n- Stevie Wonder performed a version during the closing ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics, as a tribute to the victims of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.\n\n- In 2001, Neil Young performed a cover during the benefit concert America: A Tribute to Heroes.\n\n- Peter Gabriel performed the song during the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\n- Joan Baez on her 1972 album Come from the Shadows.\n\n- Diana Ross on her 1973 album Touch Me in the Morning.\n\n- Eva Cassidy on her 2002 album of the same name.\n\n- A Perfect Circle on their 2004 album eMOTIVe.\n\nA Perfect Circle - Imagine\n\n- Dolly Parton on her 2005 covers album Those Were the Days.\n\n- Lady Gaga performed the song at the 2015 European Games opening ceremony.\n\n- In 2018, Yoko Ono released her own version of the song."
