        "text": "Abstract Note\n\nElliott’s work can be categorized under star studies. Star studies contemplate celebrity as a reflection of societal desire, both conscious and unconscious. Elliott uses contemporary critical theory and psychoanalytical theory and interweaves the two methods to create an interesting but heavy-going end product. We, Elliott states, as a society, continue to be ambivalent about Lennon as a public figure. His difficulty in balancing his private and public lives reflects broader cultural contradictions about the self. Lennon’s attack on the ideology of celebrity has broader implications for our personal and political lives. The author discusses Lennon as an artist inspired by mourning and loss. Lennon’s alienation and experimental use of language “uncover(s) the culturally repressed” (6). Dylan and Lennon both uncouple style and content in order to discover the unknown, the other, and to otherwise probe the subconscious."
