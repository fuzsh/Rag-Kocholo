        "text": "In the year or so after John’s death, newsstands and book stores were predictably flooded with printed epitaphs and biographical potboilers. There were thrown-together magazines, with a heavy emphasis on photographs; straight reprints of earlier books with an updated introduction or epilogue, and hastily compiled new paperbacks rehashing his life and times, often with cheery titles like Death of a Dream. With no internet back then, it was the only way to feed the voracious public appetite for all things Lennon in the wake of his awful demise. Many of these publications were still around on the second-hand market when my passion for The Beatles began to build a few years later and I was picking up anything about them I could get my hands on. It quickly became apparent many of these books were just quickie cash-ins, which offered little information beyond the basics (and even that was sometimes riddled with errors and omissions or skewed towards Lennon deification at the expense of the other Fabs). There were a couple worth holding onto though. Surprisingly, one of the first to hit the market (even before 1980 was out) was also one of the most readable: Strawberry Fields Forever: John Lennon Remembered, by Vic Garbarini and Brian Cullman (with an interview segment by Barbara Graustark).\n\nThe compact, pocket-sized paperback covers John’s life in 177 brisk pages, and has a raft of photographs in the middle. Unsurprisingly, considering it’s hot-off-the-press origins, the book’s opening chapters deal with John’s murder, and the stunned reactions it generated across the globe. ‘Sometime in NYC’ then traces John and Yoko’s love affair with the city, before the narrative backtracks to the start of the story. ‘All The Lonely People’ revisits his Liverpool upbringing and the birth of The Beatles; ‘Strawberry Fields’ charts the band’s soaring success, alongside their staggering artistic growth, before the inevitable split, and ‘The Plastic Ono Band’ recounts John’s highs and lows as a solo artist. There’s also a lengthy chronology of key dates in his life (very common in such books back then, though the usual discography is missing) and, best of all, the full transcript of an interview Lennon gave just before his death. It’s the book’s main selling point, and I’ll come back to it later.\n\nThe first two chapters – ‘The Dream is Over’ and ‘Seven Days in December’ – understandably reflect the immediacy and shock of the tragic events which unfolded on 8 December. When the book went to print, remember, this had all just happened. There’s no historical filter or wise, after-the-fact perspective. It’s just raw reactions and reportage, ripped direct from the headlines of the day. So we get full details (as they were known at the time) of the circumstances surrounding John’s murder, the events leading it up it, and the police investigation which followed. There is a vivid summary of the outpouring of grief which greeted the news, from the great and the good as well as some of the ordinary fans who descended on the Dakota Building in Manhattan to pay their respects and share in the acutely-felt, communal sense of loss. There’s part of a heartfelt tribute piece written by respected rock critic Robert Christgau for the Village Voice magazine, plus a reproduction of Yoko’s official statement released in the wake of the tragedy. And it reports on the remarkable vigils which took place the following Sunday in New York and Liverpool, as well as other cities around world, mass showings of public affection and mourning. It all seems a long time ago now, but the book takes you right into the heart of that very dark December.\n\nThe chapter on John’s time in New York trots through the usual touch points – his dealings with the radical underground and subsequent battle to avoid deportation by a paranoid, reactionary government; the split with Yoko and drunken detour to Los Angeles; their eventual reconciliation and retreat from the public eye following the birth of their son Sean in 1975, and the fateful re-emergence with the Double Fantasy album five years later. Most of us know the story, of course, but it’s engagingly told and (for the time) well informed. If anything, the chapters on John’s childhood and The Beatles are even better. Rather than just regurgitate the very familiar sequence of events (which are in any case covered in the chronology section at the back), they try to provide a bit of insight into his character and how various things helped make him the man he was. So, for example, it looks at the impact of his mother’s death during his teenage years, and how it affected him in later life (as well as how the similar tragedy in the McCartney household brought him closer to Paul). It’s the sort of thing explored in much more detail in later books, but the authors deserve credit for including it here, when they really didn’t have to. While the book won’t tell you anything you won’t already know, the facts are covered concisely and pretty accurately, supported with some well-chosen interview snippets – and not just from John, with Paul quoted a number of times during the recounting of The Beatles’ years. And there’s none of the Macca-bashing which some other books of the time were guilty of.\n\nThe coverage of John’s musical output, with The Beatles and solo, is somewhat erratic. Sgt. Pepper and the White Album get several pages, whereas Abbey Road merits barely a sentence (though I like the turn of phrase that the band’s final musical statement mirrors the bright and intense colours of a sunset) and Let It Be is cursorily written off as “dismal”. Likewise, the Plastic Ono Band and Imagine albums get track-by-track breakdowns, whereas his later work is largely skimmed over – Mind Games gets a paragraph, for example, and even the recently-released Double Fantasy receives scant attention (the authors cite Yoko’s contributions as the ones which “give it life”). This reflects an unbalanced view of John’s solo career (albeit one which he aided and abetted in his final interviews) which was becoming set in stone even then, and which remains hard to shake in some quarters today. Nonetheless, the analysis of his songwriting that we do get is pithy and thoughtful, with the authors joining the dots between John’s life and art pretty well. The chronology section also seems pretty reliable. Skimming through it, the only howler I could see what the claim that John met Paul in the summer of 1955, two years ahead of time, though they weren’t the only writers to get that wrong before the actual date was established beyond doubt by Mark Lewisohn in the mid-‘80s.\n\nUndoubtedly, though, the main reason to get hold of the book is the 40-page interview section. John and Yoko gave a string of fascinating interviews to publicise their comeback in the autumn of 1980, notably to Rolling Stone, Playboy and the BBC, and the one included here – expanded from an original version published in Newsweek magazine – is no exception. Entitled ‘Two Virgins’ (though the lion’s share of the responses come from John), the discussion delves deep into a whole range subjects it’s hard to imagine coming up in pop star one-to-ones today. For example, Graustark asks him if he thinks he has any shortcomings; his regrets; what friction in his life powers his creativity, and even how he thinks male and female fantasies differ. It’s quite heady stuff in parts, and John rises to the challenge, giving long, lucid and typically frank answers.\n\nWe also get the inevitable questions about The Beatles, his relationship with Paul, his marriage, parenthood and his new music, and he is just as engaged and provocative on these topics. Some of his answers about the Fabs are cast through a disparaging lens. He credits Yoko with helping to rescue him from a gilded palace filled with “sycophants and slaves”, and claims the other Beatles are “still in a state of shock” about the group’s dissolution. He describes Paul’s most recent album, McCartney II, as “empty” (it’s telling that he’d listened to it, though) and, when asked why Macca turned up at the Dakota once with a guitar in hand, he says: “Paul got what he wanted, which was total control. Maybe he then got bored with total control, because total control is isolation.” While rubbishing the prospect of a Beatles reformation (“I was never one for reunions”), he nonetheless expresses regret over the way the group broke up, saying it “left a bad taste”. And there’s definitely a sense of pride when he recounts how his son Sean came home from watching Yellow Submarine at a neighbour’s apartment and excitedly asked him: “Daddy, are you a Beatle?”\n\nAs was almost always the case with John, it’s a lively, thought-provoking interview. He runs the usual gamut of being funny, caustic, nostalgic, dippy, profound, snappy and charming. Perhaps the most poignant section comes towards the end when he talks about wandering around Hong Kong at dawn, alone, during a recent visit to the Far East, and reconnecting with the feelings of wonder he had when walking the mountains of Scotland as a child. He obviously still had so much to say – though it’s worth remembering, as with all his interviews, it just reflects how he felt on that particular day. He was mercurial to the end and, considering his relatively young age and abrupt end, nothing should ever be taken as his definitive last word. But it’s a lot of fun to read, and I guess we’re lucky to have such snapshots of his state of mind during his final days."
