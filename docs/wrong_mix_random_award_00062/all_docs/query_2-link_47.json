        "text": "Greetings all and welcome to another Paul McCartney article. Today, I will breaking my one rule (a rule I have already broken several time already), by taking it upon myself to talk about a certain little band that McCartney was a part of between the years of 1957 and 1970. You may have heard of them before…\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nThe very phrase singer-songwriter immediately evokes the images of both John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They are inseparable from the notion of a person/s that sits down, writes a song, plays a song, records a song and releases a song to the public for mass consumption. They have defined the term for the simple fact that they were the very best at it in the first place. True masters of their craft, the Lennon/McCartney writing duo, has arguably had a larger impact on the world of music, and pop culture in general, than any other. No, seriously. Try and think of another songwriter/s that come close to matching the resonance that these two Scousers created.\n\nWhilst the very idea of singer-songwriters was not one of the many things that the Beatles created, they were still not considered part of the norm, and it was expected that most, if not all, sucessful singers would have a cadre of helpers behind them. Lennon and McCartney however, were not trying with all their might to get into the music industry to only go and sing other peoples material. Now, whether this is based on the lucrative song writing paycheques, pride or arrogance is anyone’s guess, but they had it in their heads that they would not only perform what they wanted, but they would write it too.\n\nRather famously, back in the early days, when “the lads” were shopping around the idea of releasing From Me to You as a single, George martin and the rest of the suits were instead trying to get them to release a cover of ‘How Do You Do It’. This innocuous little pop tune, later released by Gerry and the Pacemakers, was already turned down by several acts before being picked up by George Martin, and the Beatles own distaste for the track was so extreme that, legend has it, they intentionally sabotaged the recording so that they wouldn’t use it. Again, whether this was to get their own names on their own records, or just because they didn’t think the song fit their sound is anyones guess, but its clear that, even from the earliest days of Beatledom, that any other material other than Beatle generated content was simply not going to do.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before, on both the blog and the podcast, there is a certain mythos around the songwriting partnership. There are these very rose-tinted, romantic images of the tw of them finishing each others lines, and helping each other write guitar parts and harmonies from Please Please Me, right the way up to Let It Be (or Get Back to OG fans). The problem with these images are that if you actually read up on the history of the band then you instantly realise just how untrue it all really is. Sorry to shit on the cake folks, but that is how it is. I’m not saying that they never did after those early days, far from it. It’s just that the reality of the matter is far interesting.\n\nRather than having this clean cut, 50/50, nice squeaky clean image of the two of them sharing a pen, and fighting for bits of each others scrap paper, instead we have a very rich, yet extremely complex interpersonal relationship between two figures that are referred to in most circles as geniuses. Classic male, competitive, one-up-manship was, of course, a primal element of this relationship. Some may think it was unhealthy, but if anything it was a constructive way to keep having the two of them (and later George) constantly inspired, and surrounding by other great writing that would only go to catapult them to further success and further experimentation. The proof is in the pudding.\n\n“I Want to Hold Your Hand” – non-album single\n\nWhen people think of that romanticised notion of the Lennon and McCartney writing partnership in a historically correct sense, it is of songs like this that they are thinking of. This is one of those songs songs that even the most ardently fanatical Lennon/McCartney fans admit are pure fifty fifty collaborations that demonstrated to the world just how dangerous a pair they would be.\n\nWhen recollecting the songwriting session that bore this classic, Lennon had the following to say….\n\n“We wrote a lot of stuff together, one on one, eyeball to eyeball. Like in ‘I Want to Hold Your Hand,’ I remember when we got the chord that made the song. We were in Jane Asher’s house, downstairs in the cellar playing on the piano at the same time. And we had, ‘Oh you-u-u/ got that something…’ And Paul hits this chord and I turn to him and say, ‘That’s it!’ I said, ‘Do that again!’ In those days, we really used to absolutely write like that—both playing into each other’s noses.”\n\n– John Lennon\n\nWhat’s even more endearing is both Paul’s own reaction to this quote, as well as the fact that he clearly had not heard Lennon’s own quote until the interview…\n\n“‘Eyeball to eyeball’ is a very good description of it. That’s exactly how it was. ‘I Want to Hold Your Hand’ was very co-written. It was our big number one; the one that would eventually break us in America.”\n\n– Paul McCartney\n\nThis song works so well as a true Lennon and McCartney collaboration because it is the peak of the prototypical Beatles sound. Whereas latter era Beatle music can get a little bogged down with whether it is a separate Lennon or McCartney composition, ‘I Want to Hold Your Hand’ sounds far more like a truly collaborative, homogenous “Beatle” song rather than being specifically lead by either party. Corny as it sounds, but songs like this are an example of perfect synchronisticy between the separate talents that Lennon and McCartney brought. So well blended is this composition, you really cannot tell who wrote what or where.\n\n“She Loves You” – non album single\n\n‘She Loves You’ is one of those very serendipitous Beatles songs that whilst being an undeniable rock classic, also boasts an equally fascinating story behind its composition and it highlights the spontaneous energy that the two of them could share in all-too brief moments.\n\nThe story goes that after gigging all night with Gerry and the Pacemakers, and Roy Orbison, Lennon and McCartney were just so instantly inspired in that moment to write another tune that they couldn’t even wait until the tour bus got them back to the hotel before they were both penning the tune. This impromptu writing session carried on all night in the hotel room, right through to the next day where it was finished off at McCartney’s parent’s home.\n\nWhilst undoubtably the core composition of the tune, as well as it’s lyricism, are attributable to Lennon, McCartney’s borderline shared vocal throughout the song suggests that this number was the product of the two of them in a small space, constantly bouncing ideas back an forth. Lennon actually pointed out, in an admittedly rare moment of humility, declared Paul the creator of the songs most unique qualities…\n\n“It was Paul’s idea: instead of singing ‘I love you’ again, we’d have a third party. That kind of little detail is still in his work. He will write a story about someone. I’m more inclined to write about myself.”\n\nSo, whilst this may not be Paul’s song per say, but it is his unique contribution of subverting the standard love song from “I” to “she” whilst minor in terms of word count, is still one of the many elements that makes that song so special in the first place. This only goes to reinforce the notion that whatever the percetage of the song was written by who, there would be nothing without the Lennon-McCartney partnership.\n\n“Baby’s In Black” – Beatles for Sale\n\nUnlike many of the songs in the Beatles back catalogue where John and Paul shared the lead vocals, ‘Baby’s In Black’ boasts an incredibly strong, nigh inseparable double-vocal that really drives home what still makes the Lennon-McCartney partnership so perfect. The songs complex, intertwining harmonies indicate that the two of them clearly took their time in crafting this together tune, but the results speak for themselves and it’s one of the standouts of Beatles for Sale.\n\nWhen speaking of this song, as well as the difficulties in truly accrediting it, Macca painted the following picture…\n\n“It was very much co-written and we both sang it. Sometimes the harmony that I was writing in sympathy to John’s melody would take over and become a stronger melody. Suddenly a piebald rabbit came out of the hat! When people wrote out the music score they would ask, ‘Which one is the melody?’ because it was so co-written that you could actually take either. We rather liked this one. It was not so much a work job, there was a bit more cred about this one. It’s got a good middle.”\n\n– Paul McCartney\n\nSongs around this period really are coming up to the end of the truly romantic period of this writing partnership, but what’s clear is how it was still so essential to their ability to churn out high quality albums in this relatively early phase of their career. Perhaps the notorious post-tour exhaustion that was plaguing The Fab Four at this time of their career forced Lennon and McCartney to put aside their solo efforts and come up with something good to help fill up an album that was probably stuffed with covers to get them over the finish line.\n\n“Eleanor Rigby & In My Life” – Revolver & Rubber Soul\n\nNormally, these two songs might be more at home in an article about the disputed Lennon/McCartney compositions, but the very fact that there is a dispute over their true authorship to begin with is, as far as I am concerned, and much to the possible opposition of both parties, a clear indicator of two truly cowritten projects.\n\nWith these two songs it is hard not to get buried under the weight of the sheer number of “he said, she said”, back and forth diatribe that surrounds them. Both tracks are, or at least were, hotly contested, with both parties at a minimum wanting a greater credit, and at the most, a primary credit over the other. What is known is that both of them certainly had their fingers in both classic pies.\n\n“In My Life”, the song which most would ascribe to Lennon, famously is disputed by McCartney who claims much of the actual music was indeed him, as seen in this rather world shattering statement…\n\n“As I recall, he didn’t have a tune to it, and my recollection, I think, is at variance with John’s. I said, ‘Well, you haven’t got a tune, let me just go and work on it.’ And I went down to the half-landing, where John had a Mellotron, and I sat there and put together a tune based in my mind on Smokey Robinson and the Miracles…\n\nI recall writing the whole melody. And it actually does sound very like me, if you analyse it. I was obviously working to lyrics. The melody’s structure is very me. So my recollection is saying to John, ‘Just go and have a cup of tea or something. Let me be with this for ten minutes on my own and I’ll do it’…\n\nSo it was John’s original inspiration, I think my melody, I think my guitar riff. I don’t want to be categorical about this, but that’s my recollection… I find it very gratifying that out of everything we wrote, we only appear to disagree over two songs.”\n\n– Paul McCartney.\n\n“Eleanor Rigby”, the which most would ascribe to Paul, was also twinned with an alternate recollection of on the part of Lennon who remembered the composition of the song as thus….\n\n“Ah, the first verse was his and the rest are basically mine. But the way he did it… Well, he knew he had a song. But by that time he didn’t want to ask for my help, and we were sitting around with Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall, so he said to us, ‘Hey, you guys, finish up the lyrics.\n\nOh, he had the whole start: ‘Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been.’ And he had the story and knew where it was going. So we had to work out, ‘Well, is there anybody else in this story?’ We came up with Father McCartney for a bit, but Paul said his dad would be upset, so we made it into McKenzie, even though McCartney sounded better. And then we went on to new characters… It’s hard to describe, even with the clarity of memory, the moment the apple falls. The thing will start moving along at a speed of its own, then you wake up at the end of it and have this whole thing on paper, you know? Who said what to whom as we were writing, I don’t know.”\n\nYikes! Thats’ an awful lot to process as someone trying to make sense of the Beatles canon. I guess all this fake-news of the Beatle story, on the face of it, should symptomatic of how non-symbiotic the writing process had already become by this point right? There are no stories of how this was cowritten in good spirits, and each party is more than happy to claim the lions share.\n\nHowever, before we settle things once and for all, there is another level to this debate. The idea of discussing the writing of songs, and the composition of songs means different things to both writers. McCartney tends to focus melody first and lyrics after, so therefore tends to highlight the “tunes” he wrote. Lennon, on the other hand, tends to ascribe authorship to songs that he put the lyrics on, and tends to denote melody as of secondary importance. This means if anything, the relationship, and the authorship of certain songs, had gotten so muddied, and so intertwined that when time for ownership came to question, each party panicked at how little of their own babies might be theirs, and so decided to stubbornly double down on the supposed number of Beatle classics to their name,\n\n‘A Day in the Life’,‘I’ve Got a Feeling’ &‘Baby You’re a Rich Man’\n\nSgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Let It Be & non-album single.\n\nNo, don’t panic! There hasn’t been some ‘Carnival of Light’ scale, unreleased remix of the best songs from their respective albums. Instead I am putting these two together as their construction, despite sporting completely different tones, styles and compositions, is essentially the same. Both, of these tracks were partial, or half songs that either John or Paul had written, which they subsequently took to the other and asked for another complementary, half written ditty to fill in the gap and complete the genome sequence.\n\n‘A Day in the Life’, again, is another unquestionably Lennon song, and yet, once again, manages to somewhat steal the show with his kooky little middle eighth section. And, that’s exactly what it is, “Paul’s” section. Long before the iconic countdown bridges were ever devises, John knew that for this song that he needed a might eighth and that he wanted Paul to write it. So, Paul used an unfinished little ditty (that is untitled as far as I’m aware) that he had in the back of his mind, it just so happened to fit, and the rest is history.\n\nFor ‘I’ve Got a Feeling’ the process was similar, albeit a little more unnatural and inverted. McCartney had written this song for Let It Be (then known as Get Back), and he didn’t know how to finish it. In response, Lennon pulled a song that he had demoed back during The White Album called ‘Everybody Had a Hard Year’ and in kind, plugged the gap that McCartney needed to fill.\n\n‘Baby You’re a Rich Man’, followed much of a similar line whereby both parties came to the writing session with a separate tune they had been working on, with Lennon’s creating the basis verse, whilst McCartney’s focussed on the hook and chorus.\n\nNow, whilst each of these stories might seem a little bit cold in their composition, with both parties simply filling in the holes that the others couldn’t quite figure out, but they does show how the two of them, would put the song first and draw, with pin-point precision, the exact kind of song that would fit tab A into slot A perfectly. It also has to be worth mentioning, in stark contrast to what I juuuust said, that the two of them must of had some sort of symbiosis in their writing, even by the end, if they were still so easily able to smash songs together, and more importantly, so effectively.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nThese are just a few of the most famous examples of the Lennon-McCartney writing partnership in action, and I hope the overall tone didn’t burst too many bubbles. I am, of course, a huge Beatles fan and never want to paint anything other than an honest picture of the band. I began by pointing out that the iconic collaborative process between Lennon and McCartney isn’t exactly what it’s all cracked up to be, and whilst I still believe that, there has been a distinct impression I a left with, is that, at least in the latter years, far too much focus is spent on trying to prove how far apart they were, as opposed to how intrinsically their songwriting was still linked.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nAgain, thank you so much for reading my poxy little, tin pot blog.
