        "text": "Paul McCartney teases his new album 'McCartney III' in trailer\n\nSir Paul McCartney has written many songs over the years, as a solo artist and as a member of The Beatles and Wings. However, one particular songwriting credit has been known to get his back up: Lennon-McCartney. Sir Paul has spoken out about his feelings on it before - but why is John’s name first?\n\nSir Paul McCartney wrote many songs from The Beatles completely alone.\n\nJohn Lennon, his co-songwriter, did exactly the same, and fans of The Beatles have often pored over the songs to work out who wrote what.\n\nExamples of some of John’s songs are I Am the Walrus and Strawberry Fields Forever, which Sir Paul had very little to do with.\n\nIn contrast, tunes like Blackbird and Yesterday were written solely by Sir Paul, though with all their songs, it is likely advice was taken from the other songwriter to get the final version just right.\n\nREAD MORE: Tom Jones Engelbert Humperdinck feud: What happened between them?\n\nHowever, there has been some wrangling over the order of the songwriting credits, with Sir Paul feeling it is ‘only fair’ to include his name first on the songs which he wrote.\n\nSpeaking on The Adam Buxton Podcast, Sir Paul explained how his name went second to begin with, suggesting there had been some discussion he was not privy to.\n\nHe said: “What happened was I went to a meeting where Brian Epstein, our manager, had a little office in the West End of London and we were going to have a meeting about this and that.\n\n“I went to the meeting and Brian and John were there - John had got there a little earlier and they were chatting - and it came up.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’d rather have Lennon-McCartney as that’s the sort of brand,’ but what happened was leafing through the booklet and there’s the song Yesterday, the lyrics.\n\n“That was a song which I wrote totally on my own, I actually recorded it, I’m the only person on the record besides the string quartet so I felt, ‘Here’s a time when we should put ‘Yesterday by Paul McCartney and John Lennon.’\"\n\nFor Sir Paul, the new way of writing their names, with their full names written, for him suggested John’s name should be after his for songs which were written solely by him, and vice versa on John’s songs.\n\nHe added: “I asked if that was possible and I was voted down, and I thought this is actually crazy because you’ve got a song like Blackbird, that is like totally me, and it’s credited to John Lennon and Paul McCartney.”\n\nHe told stories of when a poetry book of his lyrics was released, which had John Lennon head of him with the lyrics to Blackbird, and another instance when Blackbird was included in a musician’s songbook, and his name had been cut off altogether.\n\nHe added: “I’ve said on a number of occasions: on the songs which are clearly John’s, if you’re going to separate the names up, to be John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\n“If the songs are clearly mine like Yesterday, Long and Winding Road, Blackbird, and that John admitted are mine, it might be a good idea to put my name first...\n\n“So this song would be like, Blackbird, by John Lennon and P..., because there was no room for my name.\n\n“So it was by John Lennon. And I was going, ‘That is a good argument for sticking my name first on those songs.”\n\nIn the early 2000s, Sir Paul entered into a dispute with Yoko Ono over the songwriting credit, who inherited John’s wealth and certain musical rights along with his son Sean.\n\nHowever, Sir Paul relented and the credit has remained as it was."
