        "text": "Writing from a cell at Sullivan Correctional Facility, I’m part of a renaissance of prison journalism. If prison authorities had their way, no one would be writing from the inside at all.\n\nWhat are conjugal visits really like? Incarcerated journalist John J. Lennon takes Esquire inside one of the last bastions of prisoner intimacy in America: trailers of New York.\n\nIn the prison yard last summer, I received an ultimatum: pay up or get shivved (again). For what felt like the first time, I chose door number three.\n\nIn the days before he went into lockdown, John J. Lennon sent this dispatch from Sing Sing, on how the maximum-security prison was preparing for the inevitable arrival of COVID-19.\n\nIn New York state prisons, a few accommodations for fashion have created a whole ecosystem of sartorial expression.\n\nOur mental-health-care system is broken. Ten of every eleven psychiatric patients housed by the government are incarcerated. Here’s what this crisis looks like from the inside—a series of lost lives and a few rare victories—as reported by a prisoner-journalist."
