        "text": "Mind Games: The Assassination of John Lennon by David Whelan, published by Orwell Books, distributed by Amazon.\n\nCorporate Unionism & The Deep State in Australia\n\nThe Corporate Union phenomena in Australia must be seen in the context of a Deep State, Corporate Media and ALP Octopus conspiracy. Its particularly associated with the 'smoke and mirrors' performances associated with union ballot rigging allegedly by ALP networks in the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission). An important aspect involving the Deep State is its agents infiltration of various Leftist groups who are 'allowed' to be elected in union ballots organised by the AEC. In this way agents of the Deep State are installed to run the corporate unions to ensure there is no rocking the boat in regard to their role in facilitating the Neo-Liberal push, the enterprise bargaining 'smoke and mirrors', privatisation and the war drive. (1)\n\nSome examples which may fit this pattern are:\n\nIn regard to the NSW Fire Brigade Union, which attracts many ex-cops, presumably also undercover cops and ex-military for employment, a former top level official who was an ex-member of a leftist group was 'allowed' to be elected into the position by the AEC. Following attaining office, he proceeded to collaborate with management. For example he had the Fire Commissioner address a mass union meeting where he proclaimed falsely that the workers had won a 'victory' with their EBA campaign and obviously intimidated the grass roots from asking any critical questions to expose the sell out. Despite this individual's leftist group background, Unions NSW aligned with the Right Wing ALP faction and ASIO/CIA paid tens of thousands of dollars for him to go on an international junket. It involved attending the notorious CIA recruiting ground of the Harvard Trade Union Officials' Training School.(2)\n\nAnother intriguing example is information received from a former long time Nurses Union rep at RPA Hospital in Sydney. She advised that undercover cops were becoming nurses there and presumably at other hospitals. What would be the hidden agenda? For them to rise up in the nurses union to run it for the ALP Right Faction and help get through privatisation? Perhaps a more sinister agenda? They would be well placed for so called accidents or so called 'natural causes' for those targeted by the State and Corporate set up?\n\nThe John Lennon 'Brand': Manufactured and Terminated by the Deep State!\n\nA disappointing aspect of the book, is the author's ignoring important research by American musician/song writer/Beatles researcher Mike Williams on his web site “Sage of Quay” and others on the Beatles phenomena. The author completely accepts the 'official narrative' or fantasy about the Beatles. Omitting the findings of the above researchers collaborated by corporate music industry veterans with experience of the 1960's music industry, that the Beatles and John Lennon's rise to super stardom was very much a creation of the Deep State in the shape of the obscure Tavistock Institute in the UK connected with MI5, CIA, the corporate media and a host of other capitalist globalist organisations. Its origins lie in the lead up to WWI and propaganda/psycho warfare by the British Deep State to facilitate it, but was 'officially' formed in 1920 as the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, then becoming the Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychology in Sept. 1947. (3) Mike Williams and music industry veterans are particularly illuminating in their discussion of the production of the Beatles' “Rubber Soul” Album. The conclusions these 60's music industry experts and Mike Williams draw is that the 'The Fab 4' only supplied the vocals for the album! The lyrics and instrumental music was produced by 'mysterious others'. Presumably including top studio session musicians and lyric writing Tavistock Institute hired guns. According to Mike's and others extensive research into other Beatles albums, there is a similar pattern to varying degrees with those as well. According to Mike's recent research using facial recognition technology analysis of photos of John Lennon from 1962-1980, he comes to a truly explosive conclusion. There were two “John Lennons” running in parallel from 1966 to 1980 with also other look-alikes and doubles used! So “John Lennon” should be seen more as a Deep State manufactured 'brand' raising new explosive and bizarre issues with the assassination conspiracy theory argued by the author and other researchers. (4)\n\nAn important way this social engineering with the Beatles assisted the ruling class was particularly in the Beatles psychedelic phase associated with the 'Revolver' Album and others encouraging drug use such as LSD as part of the CIA's 'Operation Chaos'. Facilitating the Hippy/drop out phenomena to counter student/worker/youth radicalising of the 60's and 70's. Other aspects of 'Operation Chaos' was the manufacture of a 'death squad' like the 'Charles Manson Family/LSD Cult' to wipe out high profile anti-Vietnam War and other leftist activists like Jane Fonda, which went horribly wrong killing the wrong people such as Sharon Tate. Another key but little known aspect, was the CIA's and Corporate Media promotion of the so called 'Women's Movement' to stir up trouble and disrupt via splits in leftist groups assisting militant networks in workplaces and contributing to wildcat strikes. Particularly associated with such key CIA personalities as Gloria Steinem long time CIA agent involved in Radio Free Europe and the CIA infiltration of World Youth Congresses and Katherine Graham publisher of the CIA mouth piece, the 'Washington Post'. (5) Parallel to the FBI's notorious Leftist disruption program of COINTELPRO.\n\nThe author looks at the breakup of the Beatles in 1970, disagreeing with other commentators that Yoko Ono, John Lennon's wife played a major role in the affair. However, the author fails to take account of the certain 'back room' role of the Beatles' Tavistock 'bosses' would have in the break up and the ramifications of Mike William's research about two 'John Lennons' with doubles/look-alikes. Following the break up, the author shows at least one of the John Lennons went on a radical phase, becoming an important force in the Anti-Vietnam War movement and supporting a variety other leftist causes. A severe critic of the Nixon US Government and subject to continuous FBI surveillance and harassment after moving to the USA. The author comments how following the Beatles breakup John Lennon's music and albums underwent a serious decline in quality. Failing to take account of the absence of all that Tavistock Institute 'back room' assistance being a significant cause of the decline.(5)\n\nUSA Deep State Assassination Conspiracies\n\nThe author examines the John Lennon assassination Conspiracy in the context of similar high profile assassinations in the USA such as the JFK (John F. Kennedy), RFK (Robert F.Kennedy), Malcolm X and MLK (Martin Luther King) Assassinations. He sees the most similar being the RFK assassination with Mark Chapman of the John Lennon assassination as a 'Manchurian Candidate' programmed by the CIA courtesy of its MK-ULTRA program who acted as a patsy/decoy firing blanks similar to Sirhan Sirhan in the RFK assassination. Diverting attention from the professional hit/conspiracy. The successful John Lennon Assassination, the author sees as a dry run for the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, to replace him as President with vice President George Bush Senior, former CIA Director. It was also a way to counter opposition to revived US imperialism and intervention in Nicaragua, the Middle East, etc. The author follows on the pioneering research of Fenton Bresler in his book “Who Killed John Lennon?” which argued for a Deep State Conspiracy and provided evidence in support with Mark Chapman's tampered airline tickets. However, according to Mike Williams research there was another “John Lennon” running parallel, obviously not killed. Mike Williams has presented an intriguing alternative theory for the assassination. Tavistock boss worries about the presumably biological 'Lennon' talk before his death of writing a tell all autobiography/memoir! Pointing to a another motivation for the Deep State role in the assassination conspiracy.\n\nMark Chapman's 'Spooky' Background & Deep State Manipulation\n\nThe author follows Bresler's research outlining Chapman's association over many years with LSD use, Far Right Christian preachers, the YMCA which has been a target of much CIA infiltration and mental health institutions which were a target for the CIA's MK-ULTRA 'mind control' programme. He examines the suspicious role of Chapman's wife Gloria at the time of the assassination, as a likely Deep State “handler” for him. The author shows based on eye witness statements that Chapman was not in a position at the Dakota Building to shoot Lennon and according to medical personnel who examined Lennon, he was shot from the front execution style. Indicating the possibility of one of the Dakota workers with a mysterious significant gap in his working life as the shooter. The author shows the doorman acted in a highly suspicious manner and fingered Chapman as the shooter.\n\nThe FBI and John Lennon's 'Security'\n\nA likely smoking gun pointing to a conspiracy involving John Lennon's assassination is the absence of any security/body guards on the night of his killing. (Intriguingly in the case of the near assassination of George Harrison in 1999, conveniently his advanced security system was turned off and his household staff were on leave on the night! His assailant also had similarities in profile to Chapman.(6)) The author in his research exposes bizarre aspects of Lennon's security regime. The author shows that Doug MacDougal, Lennon's ex-body guard was a former FBI agent involved in 'black job' operations and his FBI partner was involved in the cover-up of the MLK assassination conspiracy! Intriguingly MacDougal was suspended as body guard until the day after the assassination due to a disagreement with Yoko Ono, who was in charge of overall security. MacDougal was in a position to orchestrate aspects of the assassination with Dakota Building workers and management. The author shows they acted suspiciously in regard to the assassination. Particularly the workers on the fateful day. The author argues that with MacDougal's FBI connections, even if he was on duty on the day of the assassination, he may not have prevented it.\n\nYoko Ono & the Assassination\n\nThe author generally discounts Yoko Ono's role in the conspiracy as she failed to identity Mark Chapman as the assassin in police statements. However, his research indicates various suspicious aspects of Ono in regard to the assassination. As mentioned above, Ono was in charge of overall security for Lennon, but had no security guards in place on the fateful night. In the days before the assassination she supplied Lennon's detailed daily itinerary to the media. Both obvious gifts to any potential assassin. Following the assassination she moved extremely rapidly - within 36 hours cremating Lennon and finalising probate. The cremation would certainly create an important obstacle to uncovering the truth about the 'two Lennons Running in Parallel' theory and evidence of the professional hit. He also shows evidence of an important motivation for her to hitch up with Lennon was consideration of his vast wealth and therefore an important reason for participation in the conspiracy. Following Lennon's death she contributed several millions of dollars to the NYPD welfare fund. Despite much evidence the NYPD engaged in a suspiciously extremely shoddy investigation of the assassination and likely engaged in parts of the cover-up such as the destruction of important evidence. The NYPD failed to do a proper forensic investigation and has refused to comply with requests from researchers for assassination witness statements. The NYPD also failed to interview a key witness. Lennon and Yoko's limo chauffeur who may have also have been involved in the conspiracy. Mike Williams characterises Ono as Lennon's 'handler' but for whom? Tavistock? Perhaps explaining, Ono's role in Lennon withdrawing from activity for leftist causes for years to become a 'house husband'. Meanwhile Williams states on Youtube that prior to Lennon's death in an interview, Lennon stated he was hypnotised by Ono!\n\nIn conclusion, while the author does a great job refuting the 'official' narrative of the John Lennon assassination in many respects with his new research increasing our understanding of its various aspects. The author strangely falls for the 'official' narrative and fantasy of the Beatles and John Lennon's rise to super stardom. Despite much new research available about the role of the Tavistock Institute in the emergence of the Beatles and other pop groups. The role of the 'Deep State' in this social engineering project and mass manipulation on an international level needs to be taken into account in regard to the assassination conspiracy and dark forces behind it. Definitely the John Lennon Assassination Conspiracy needs much more research to provide us with an adequate understanding.\n\nM."
