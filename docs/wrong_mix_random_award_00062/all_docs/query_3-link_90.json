        "text": "Despite the nearly universal fame of the Beatles, many people only know the fairytale version of the iconic group's rise to fame. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of Liverpool, Francis Kenny reveals the real John Lennon who preceded the legend, showing how his childhood shaped his personality, creative process, and path to success, and how it also destroyed his mental health, leading to the downfall of one of the most confident and brilliant musicians of the past century.\n\nThe Making of John Lennon is a must-read for any Beatles fan. It explains how Lennon's turbulent family background affected his relationships, why the true inspiration for \"Strawberry Fields\" could not be revealed, how Pete Best's college connection led to his removal from the group, and why class backgrounds were the real reason for the breakup of the legendary band. Offering a complex portrait of Lennon's early life, The Making of John Lennon tells the true story behind the rise of the legendary icon.\n\nFrancis Kenny was born in Liverpool and has lived there his entire life, giving him a comprehensive understanding of the city where John Lennon grew up. Kenny first met his wife in The Cavern (they have five children) and has been immersed in Liverpool and Beatles culture all his life. He is author of the novel Waiting for the Beatles."
