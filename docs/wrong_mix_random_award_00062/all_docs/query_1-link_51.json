He was known foremost as a musician, but played many roles during his too-short life. Born and raised in Liverpool, England, Lennon was a founding member of The Beatles, a solo musician, a peace activist, and a stay-at-home father to son Sean in his adopted hometown of New York City. He left a mark on popular culture that is without parallel.",
