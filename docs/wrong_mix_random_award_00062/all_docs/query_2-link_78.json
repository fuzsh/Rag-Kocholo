        "text": "After the Beatles broke up several of them would get increasingly annoyed with how many interviewers seemed more interested in asking them about their old band than they were in their current projects.\n\nOne of the biggest topics centred around who exactly wrote what as the Beatles had a policy of attributing songs by Lennon and McCartney to “Lennon-McCartney” (at least after “She Loves You”, before which the names were reversed), irrespective of who wrote all or most of the song.\n\nThis has caused decades of debate and argument amongst fans as they try to work out the true writer of each song, or each part of the song, aided by quotes from both authors which can contradict each other or even themselves. As the one who is still alive, McCartney is often criticized for seeming to want the last word or for rewriting history when he disagrees with Lennon.\n\nThis is of course slightly unfair. Increasing passage of time will blur and confuse memories and there are issues with assuming Lennon was right in the first place. Not only was he also speaking long (though less long) after the fact, but most of his quotes are either from a decade after the Beatles broke up or just afterwards when he was bitter about being asked questions about them, the break-up and their treatment of Yoko, and keen to distance himself as much as possible from them and what he thought they represented. McCartney on the other hand was a sentimentalist who always defined himself as a part of the group and later was keen to emphasise the group’s cohesion amidst accusations of him being over-controlling or worlds apart from Lennon.\n\nHowever there is another aspect to the question which I haven’t seen mentioned… and that is what Lennon and McCartney understood by the question in the first place, and whether each one thought “song-writing” meant the same thing as the other one did, and whether either matched what the interviewer thought.\n\nThe Beatles are well-known for their lack of classical education: Lennon and McCartney never learned how to read or write music and all four learned their instruments by playing them and working out what went into the music they liked. This process had a huge impact on their view of “song-writing”.\n\nMcCartney has stated that Harrison’s writing credit on their early song In Spite of All The Danger is due to them assuming he should get a credit for “writing” the solo: “It says on the label that it was me and George but I think it was actually written by me, and George played the guitar solo! We were mates and nobody was into copyrights and publishing, nobody understood – we actually used to think when we came down to London that songs belonged to everyone. I’ve said this a few times but it’s true, we really thought they just were in the air, and that you couldn’t actually own one. So you can imagine the publishers saw us coming! ‘Welcome boys, sit down. That’s what you think, is it?’ So that’s what we used to do in those days – and because George did the solo we figured that he ‘wrote’ the solo. ” (Paul McCartney, The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Mark Lewisohn)\n\nHowever it seems that, despite what this quote says, the misunderstanding was not partially rectified when they began recording and releasing their songs professionally. In one of his final interviews, so over ten years after the Beatles broke up, Lennon said that he wrote most of Ticket To Ride as “Paul’s contribution was the way Ringo played the drums.” (John Lennon, All We Are Saying, David Sheff) while in his authorised biography, published in 1994, McCartney claimed “We wrote the melody together; you can hear on the record, John’s taking the melody and I’m singing harmony with it. We’d often work those out as we wrote them. Because John sang it, you might have to give him 60 per cent of it. It was pretty much a work job that turned out quite well… John just didn’t take the time to explain that we sat down together and worked on that song for a full three-hour songwriting session, and at the end of it all we had all the words, we had the harmonies, and we had all the little bits.”\n\nThis seemingly contradicts John about the writing of the song, but in reality it simply contradicts him about its arrangement. He’s claiming to have come up with the harmony he sings on the record and to have helped work out “all the little bits”, which one can assume included “how Ringo played the drums.”\n\nBecause the Beatles were self-taught, working out the melodies of the songs they wanted to sing fairly naturally flowed into writing their own and arranging them. These three acts are often considered different jobs but for the Beatles they were all part of the same process. So instead of more simply disagreeing about writing, Lennon and McCartney are conflating it with arrangement to different degrees, leading to a situation where Lennon claims full ownership (rightly or wrongly) for having come up with the melody and lyric and McCartney claims 40% not because he entirely disputes this but because of his role in coming up with his own harmony, the drum part and presumably the lead guitar part he plays.\n\nEven the differences in the relative importance of arrangement as part of the songwriting can be partly explained by their processes: McCartney was infamous for coming into the studio with an entire arrangement worked out and demanding that the others play what he wanted, whereas Lennon often didn’t know or care what the others did. This approach was at its most extreme when he made most of his statements about his share of various Beatle songs, as he was then playing with the Plastic Ono on minimalist records he refused to even really rehearse.\n\nBut of course Lennon-McCartney’s approach to arrangement also had an impact on the songs they wrote even when they weren’t thinking of what we would consider the arrangement. As the Beatles did their ownt, it makes sense it would be a factor even while writing. See McCartney talking about This Boy: “We wrote it in two-part harmony and then put the third part in for George to sing; we’d never actually tried to write something like that.” (Paul McCartney, Many Years From Now, Barry Miles)\n\nThis way of thinking was noticed even at the time, as we can see from William Mann’s review in The Times “What Songs the Beatles Sang” from 27 December 1963. This was a review of the Beatles’ second album, With The Beatles, and it is often credited as the beginning of the music establishment taking the Beatles seriously as artists. “Harmonic interest is typical of their quicker songs too, and one gets the impression that they think simultaneously of harmony and melody, so firmly are the major tonic sevenths and ninths built into their tunes, and the flat submediant key switches, so natural is the Aeolian cadence at the end of “Not A Second Time” (the chord progression which ends Mahler’s Song of the Earth). (“What Songs the Beatles Sang”, William Mann)\n\nSo…\n\nWas Lennon right about this song, or that one, or the other? Or was McCartney?\n\nIn many cases who can say?\n\nHowever what we can take away from all these disagreements is the unspoken statement it makes as to their song-writing, from the collaborative close-ness which left even them unsure of what each one contributed, to the very concept of “song-writing” and what it says about the untutored approach which, often accidentally, changed the era they helped define.\n\nOliver Giggins"
