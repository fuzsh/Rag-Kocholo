        "text": "October 7, 2014\n\nInteresting to read what amounts to a cheap cashin from 1980, good to read a piece of journalism describing with the immediacy of being there the reaction to his death, giving details that are mostly forgotten, also interesting to hear about some of the other albums by John and Yoko that are mostly forgotten in the rush to praise Imagine. I also doesn't gloss over things like his 18 month lost weekend, his disagreements with Paul, or his producing a Nillson album.\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\nMuch of the content I've already read, though back in 1980, when this book was rushed to print in the wake of Lennon's assassination, much of this may have been fresh. The best part of the book was the reprint of one of his last interviews, where you really discover just how much of a prick he was about The Beatles. Anyone harboring fantasies about a reunion \"if he had survived\" is out of their minds; Lennon was absolutely never going to do it. Never.\n\nWorst part of the book is any adulation regarding Yoko's singing \"talent.\" Anytime a mic was near her, music was made worse, from the time she joined-up with John right to the end. Her screeching was not art. Not at all."
