        "text": "NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- The murder of John Lennon on Dec. 8, 1980, was as devastating as it was shocking. And Eyewitness News covered the murder like no other news source, as it happened in our backyard, to a person who was more than just one of the most famous celebrities on Earth - he was our neighbor.\n\nJohn Lennon lived at the Dakota, just a few blocks from our studio. Employees of Channel 7 considered him a friendly face they'd wave to -- he, Yoko, and their young son, Sean, would shop in the same shops and go for walks on the same streets. At least one ABC employee, Geraldo Rivera, was a close friend of the Lennons.\n\nOur special \"Eyewitness to the Death of John Lennon,\" hosted by Bill Ritter, interviews the big players in that story, both in front of the camera -- Geraldo Rivera, Ernie Anastos, John Johnson, Doug Johnson -- to those behind the scenes.\n\nIndeed, we've perhaps never been more of an \"Eyewitness\" to a story - a Channel 7 producer, Alan Weiss, happened to be at Roosevelt Hospital after a motorcycle-riding injury when the mortally wounded former Beatle was carried in.\n\nHaving witnessed the fight to save Lennon, Alan managed to call the news into the WABC assignment desk, where the scanner was blaring about a shooting at the Dakota.\n\nSoon, Weiss' news tip would reach Howard Cosell, who would break the news to the nation on ABC's Monday Night Football -- but not before debating whether he should.\n\nAt Channel 7, the newsroom was a whirlwind as the nightmarish story developed, and Ernie Anastos and Rose Ann Scamardella prepared to go on the air after the game.\n\nThe next week that followed, culminating in a historic tribute vigil in Central Park was unlike any other in New York, America -- or the Eyewitness newsroom.\n\nOur John Lennon special tells the story that shook the world from a perspective you've never seen -- as it happened, moment by moment, with rare or just-discovered historical footage, all through the eyes of Eyewitness News.\n\n\"Eyewitness to the Death of John Lennon\" is NOW STREAMING on ABC7's streaming apps on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Android TV. To stream, search \"ABC7 New York\" in the app store.\n\nCREDITS\n\nBill Ritter | Writer, Anchor\n\nKim Dillon | Senior Executive Producer\n\nPeter Kunz | Senior Executive Producer\n\nStephen Cioffi | Videographer and Editor\n\nEmily Sowa | Senior Digital Producer, Videographer\n\nRolando Pujol | Executive Producer, Digital Content, Innovation and Strategy\n\nBob Monek | Executive Producer Digital, Owned Television Project Manager\n\nBryan Lenocker | Executive Producer\n\nDana Bussey | Motion Graphic Designer, Creative Director\n\nBrandon Nelson | Creative Director, Brand\n\nYsenia Carrizales | Promotion and Digital Content Producer\n\nToby Hershkowitz | Promotion and Digital Content Producer\n\nCheryl Meaney | Senior Planning Editor\n\nErin Donovan | Media Manager\n\nMatt Lamattina | Media Manager\n\nAlycia Russell | Media Manager\n\nDavid Mulewski | Media Manager\n\nMichael Capello | Media Manager\n\nBrandon Cook | Media Manager\n\nRobert Feldman | Media Manager\n\nNatalie Cioffari | Production Assistant\n\nLaryssa Demkiw | Production Assistant\n\nJim Gorham | Vice President, Marketing\n\nChad Matthews | Vice President News, News Director\n\nDebra O'Connell | President, Networks Disney Media & Entertainment Distribution\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\n\nAlan Weiss\n\nMarilou Yacoub\n\nAna Maria Braga\n\nFred Chieco\n\nJoe Coscia\n\nJohn Johnson\n\nGeraldo Rivera\n\nDoug Johnson\n\nErnie Anastos\n\nLen Trugman\n\nDavid Sloan\n\nAlison Lynn\n\nJennifer Pirone\n\nJanice Johnston\n\nKaryn Rodus\n\nKeira Mccullough\n\nMichele Mustacchio\n\nTownsend Davis\n\nADDITIONAL FOOTAGE AND PHOTOS\n\nESPN | Outside the Lines\n\nABC News 20/20\n\nAlan Weiss\n\nCraig Ruttle"
