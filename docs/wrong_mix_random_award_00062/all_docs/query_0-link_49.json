        "text": "Founding Partner Leon Wildes is photographed alongside clients, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, at the press conference where he announced to the world that after a very long legal battle, he finally got his Green Card and was awarded Lawful Permanent Resident Status,\n\nTo view the press conference where John thanks Leon, click here: https://youtu.be/mSWTNJLYb3E\n\nFounded in 1960, Wildes & Weinberg is perhaps best known for Leon Wildes’ representation of former Beatle John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono. Between 1972 and 1976, Leon represented Lennon and Ono in their struggle to remain in the United States, despite the concerted attempts of the Nixon Administration to deport them.\n\nThe case (which included bringing four separate Federal lawsuits) not only resulted in John and Yoko getting their green cards and being able to remain in the United States, but it also led to substantial changes in immigration law and brought to light secretive government practices and undue political influence, that has resulted in greater transparency in the U.S. immigration system.\n\nThe book, aptly titled John Lennon v. The USA., is published by Ankerwycke Books, an imprint of ABA Publishing, a division of the American Bar Association and became available in August, 2016. It can be purchased on Amazon.\n\nThe firm specializes exclusively in the practice of U.S. immigration and nationality law, has a distinguished domestic and international clientele, and can assist with any type of immigration matter including employment and investment-based immigration, work permits, permanent residence for qualified individuals, family-based immigration, asylum applications, all temporary and permanent type visas, and U.S. citizenship.\n\nIn addition to running a highly successful immigration law practice, Michael is also currently serving his third term as Mayor of Englewood, New Jersey, is the author of Safe Haven in America: Battles to Open the Golden Door (which draws on over a quarter of a century of his practice in the immigration field), is an Adjunct Professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York and serves as Counsel to Lincoln Center and several international/corporate law firms. Moreover, Michael is internationally renowned for his successful representation of distinguished individuals and corporate clients such as performing artists, directors, writers, models, actors/actresses, athletes, race car drivers, fine artists, art dealers, curators, musicians, photographers, stylists, and literary agents. Some of the firm’s other distinguished clients include scholar Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks (z’l), as well as soccer icon Pele, Master Chef Jean-Georges and Former First Lady Melania Trump and her family.\n\nToday the firm of Wildes & Weinberg has offices in New York City, New York, Englewood, New Jersey, Miami, Florida, and a presence in Los Angeles, California, and continues to maintain its stellar reputation in the field of U.S. Immigration & Nationality Law."
