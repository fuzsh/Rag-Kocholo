        "text": "Anyone here know this?\n\nThis song was written by Johnny Gentle. he played the roots of it to George Harrison & John Lennon in a hotel room in Inverness whilst The Beatles toured with him in May 1960. He was struggling with the middle eight and so John Lennon helped out inputting the lyrics \"We know that we'll get by, just wait and see, just like the song tells us, the best things in life are free\". It appeared as the B Side to a single in 1962. Lennon was uncredited, but i bet Johnny Gentle wishes he had credited him eh?\n\nCould this story be true? and if so, why am i just hearing about it now! Its not the greatest song ever..but man that's some history changing stuff!\n\nAny opinions on the song?\n\nThere are a couple of songs that other artists have claimed that one or more of The Beatles co-wrote with them, (between 1961 and 1970), without either Lennon & McCartney actually receiving any credit.\n\nI’VE JUST FALLEN FOR SOMEONE - Adam Faith\n\nSee above.\n\nI’VE JUST FALLEN FOR SOMEONE - Johnny Gentle\n\nSee above.\n\nTELL ME IF YOU CAN - Tony Sheridan\n\nTony Sheridan claimed that he co-wrote this song with Paul McCartney in Hamburg in 1961. McCartney never confirmed this.\n\nThe discography book “All Together Now” claims Sheridan recorded a version in February 1964 but as far as I can tell, no sixties era version was ever released back then. However, Sheridan did record and release a version of this song in a 2005.\n\nWON’T YOU BE MY BABY - Johnny Devlin & The Devils\n\nJohnny Devlin claimed that he co-wrote this song with Paul McCartney when he and The Beatles were on the same bill in Australia in 1964. They released it in February 1965. McCartney received no credit on the record label and again he never confirmed that he co-wrote this song with Devlin.\n\nROCK OF ALL AGES - Badfinger\n\nSome sources claim McCartney co-wrote this 1969 song for Badfinger. No credit was given to him on the record. He did, however produce the song and played piano on it.\n\nMY DARK HOUR - Steve Miller\n\nI doubt very much that Paul co-wrote this song with Steve Miller but here is the history. John, George & Ringo after having an argument with Paul about Allen Klein as their manager apparently walked out of a session. Paul desperate to record found Steve Miller in the studio next door and recorded this song with him. Paul played drums, bass & did backing vocals on this song.\n\nAll of the original releases of this song did not list Paul as a co-writer, just “Steve Miller”. The album as well as the 45 labels did have a little acknowledgment that Paul contributed to this song with an inscription that read “With special thanks to Paul Ramon”. ‘Paul Ramon’ was the pseudonym Paul used during The Beatles first tour of Scotland in 1960.\n\nIn 1994 the “Steve Miller Band Box Set” was released. In that set, the songwriters credit for “My Dark Hour” was changed to read “Miller / Ramon” in the liner notes. No other releases that I know of have that co-writing credit. This was only time I’ve seen it. So did he co-write this song? I don’t know.\n\nthat is some fantastic information. I was aware of the Steve Miller track but not the others...i'll have to find them on youtube and have a listen later.\n\nthanks!"
