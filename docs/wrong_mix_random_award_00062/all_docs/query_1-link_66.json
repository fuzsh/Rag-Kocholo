        "text": "I’ve been watching Peter Jackson’s documentary about the Beatles album Get Back. It’s eight hours long, and quite repetitive, but I find it mesmerising and epic. It enshrines the miracle of creative work – start with nothing, mess about with it, seize on fragments and work them to smithereens, abandon them maybe, mess around a lot more, write something else, change your mind about a meaning, spend hours on tiny moments of timing or lyrics, get occasional divine inspiration (Let It Be seemed to stream from Paul’s fingers fully formed).\n\nAs I launch into the first edit of my new memoir collection, Turn Right At The Rainbow, I am living the Get Back method.\n\nThe messing about\n\nThe Beatles goof and joke, play silly versions, then flip to serious as a usable idea comes. This looks like faffing and frittering.\n\nI faff and fritter too. I’ll work on a sequence or a paragraph or a line, then drift to YouTube or Facebook for a brain break. If I was doing a job in an office, everyone would be horrified. Roz, is that serious work?\n\nIt is. Often you need to look away, let it breathe (or be), then return and catch it by surprise.\n\nRemembering the joy\n\nThe Beatles sometimes noodle into a song by Dylan or Chuck Berry, guitars blazing, vocals roaring. Perhaps to find the vibe they’re grasping for? And also to feel the joy?\n\nI get that. I keep books so I can take a brief trip into another author’s creation and voice. It reminds me. This is what it’s about. The joy – of playing musical instruments, of playing the instruments of a reader’s mind.\n\nBolstering confidence with past songs\n\nThe early stages of creative work can be worryingly random. Will this really become something worthwhile?\n\nAs the Beatles jam, they might slide into one of their old songs.\n\nI recognise the feeling. We did it before. We can do it again.\n\nI might take down one of my own books and read a few paragraphs at random. Not to bask in hubris, but to keep my confidence. Those books grew from a similar vast unknown.\n\nLine by line\n\nGeorge sings some lyrics. John suggests changing a word to make it more weird. It doesn’t sound as good. Not all changes are improvements, but you have to try.\n\nI write wild things, cut them in, take them out again.\n\nJohn sings a sequence and Paul says, that line belongs at the end of the verse, not the beginning. John sings it in the new order. They decide to keep it, though it’s clear they’re not done and will revisit later.\n\nI find I’m reordering lines or whole paragraphs. It makes a massive difference to the emphasis and flow. As one of my interviewees said recently on this blog, there’s a ‘click’, when you know where something belongs.\n\nOn belonging\n\nThe song Get Back evolves. At first it was a protest song, parodying negative attitudes towards immigrants in Britain. Later we see the lyrics have become less specifically about immigration and more about a general state of human experience. The protest song was an embryo step.\n\nRepeat until you make the miracle\n\nRepeat until, miraculously, you’ve made something that is a whole world different from what you first imagined, and much more than you hoped, and everything sings.\n\nThere’s a lot more about writing in my Nail Your Novel books – find them here. If you’re curious about my own work, find novels here and my travel memoir here. And if you’re curious about what’s going on at my own writing desk, here’s my latest newsletter. You can subscribe to future updates here.\n\nFor every manuscript I see with a head-turning title, there’s another with a title that’s limp, unassertive and would never tempt a reader to look closer. Or a title that’s too tricky to remember.\n\nI had a great discussion about this recently with Peter Snell (you know, from Barton’s Bookshop) in our show for Surrey Hills Radio (find it here, on show number 10) and I thought it might be fun to elaborate on it further.\n\nNumbers are powerful\n\nFor non-fiction, you might add a sense of value by putting a number in your title. 50 Tips To Help You Build A House sounds like it offers far more than just Tips To Help You Build A House. Numbers also create a sense of insider knowledge, that an expert has chosen just the tips you need and discarded the others. When Peter and I recorded the show in the bookshop, we’d set up the microphone in the countryside section, where there were plenty of titles like 100 Finest Country Houses. One book might have country houses, but the 100 Finest sounds more persuasive. Suppose another book of country houses misses out the best ones?\n\nTip: a non-fiction title should sound authoritative, assertive.\n\nFor fiction, numbers can add a sense of frisson, a specific tipping point – Catch-22, Station Eleven, Fahrenheit 451. They seem to say ‘at this moment or place, or with this concept, something significant happens’. (And look at the startling oddness of Fahrenheit 451. The unconventional word order stirs up a sense of disturbance. Ray Bradbury’s titles all have this quality.) 1984 is a clever shuffling of the date of the novel’s publication. We can imagine how sinister it must have seemed in 1948. This will be us, it seems to say. Come and see. (Is anybody currently writing 2041?) Anthony Burgess wrote a tribute to Orwell’s novel and, naturally, called it 1985.\n\nTip: numbers are good for attracting attention.\n\n‘One’ is special\n\nIn our discussion, Peter mentioned One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and took us in a new direction. This title suggests a person on their own, the one who dared to go against the crowd. It conjures up a character. It also seems to speak for all of us while also being about one individual.\n\nContinuing the power of One, David Nicholls’s One Day sounds momentous; simple yet significant. It’s also a common phrase, with overtones of hope and dreams.\n\nAnd how about The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo? (Bafflingly, its original Swedish title translates as Men Who Hate Women. Perhaps a Swedish-speaker could explain if the original has a special quality that makes up for the apparent blandness.)\n\nTip: consider the bold and emblematic individual, time or event.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nWe like a sense of a character in a title. Names can conjure this up, but they might be hard to remember, especially if the name is used in isolation. If you read a post or a feature about a novel called Mary would it stick in your mind so you could find it later? Memorable titles will set up a little more. A Prayer for Owen Meany: why does Owen need to be prayed for? Or they might set a tone of irony – The Book of Dave. Or grab attention with a clever phrase – Memento Nora. The Rosie Project. Each Harry Potter book had a promise of adventure – The Philosopher’s Stone, The Deathly Hallows. (Also she was writing a series. Harry 2, Pottered About Some More, might not have done the trick.)\n\nTip: if using a name, add something to create a sense of curiosity.\n\nMade-up words, or words that are difficult to pronounce\n\nYears ago, I made this mistake with my first novel. I set my heart on calling it Xeching, after the meditative treatment performed by characters in the future part of the book. It seemed to carry resonance, but only if you knew what it was, of course. Agents pointed out that it was too hard to remember, not to mention incomprehensible. It’s perhaps the absolute showcase of a disastrous title – it means very little and is hard to spell. (I was thinking with my designer head, imagining it in a big, intriguing font on the cover.)\n\nYour unwise title may seem to have many points in its favour. But will this meaning be apparent to somebody happening on your book for the first time?\n\nYou might create a striking effect, though, by mis-spelling a word, if the mis-spelling is easy to remember. A novel about murders in the cyber-age might be called Killr.\n\nTip: tricky spellings and made-up words are hard to ask for in bookshops and difficult to find in online searches. And that’s assuming they’re remembered at all.\n\nPersonality of the book\n\nSome titles snare us with a sense of personality. The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland In a Ship of Her Own Making. Kill The Poor by Lemony Snicket (itself an eye-catching nom de plume). Everything is Illuminated by Jonathan Safran Foer.\n\nInstability is good\n\nLauren Oliver’s Before I Fall carries a promise – something must be done before time runs out. Look at the tension in Philip Pullman’s The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ. John Steinbeck’s East of Eden is potent with downfall. New twists on famous quotes or concepts are easy for readers to remember.\n\nWords that suit the genre\n\nIn our radio discussion, Peter remarked that certain words seem to embody the appeal of a genre – and mentioned angels, demons. (Though I threw a spanner in the works by mentioning Marian Keyes’s Angels, which is chick-lit. Or did I throw A Spaniard In The Works like John Lennon?)\n\nThe treatment of the title also tells the reader a lot. My friend David Penny is preparing to publish his historical crime novel, Breaker of Bones. I saw a conversation about it on Facebook where another friend (who didn’t know Penny’s work) asked why it wasn’t Bone Breaker. That would be an entirely different kind of novel.\n\nTip: look up genres on Amazon and on Goodreads lists to see if there are words and title styles you should consider.\n\nSum up a feeling – how memorable is it?\n\nThe least successful titles I see are when the author is trying to sum up a feeling in the book. These often become generalised and vague. Finding The Answer. The Past Returns. All My Tomorrows. Husband Dave came up with clever suggestion here. If you think of a possible title, tell it to your friends. Then, a week later, ask them if they can remember it. (Try to pick the friends who don’t have superhuman powers of recall.)\n\nThe Mountains Novel (now Ever Rest) might have been christened Comeback. This certainly fitted in some ways with the story. It was pithy. However, when I googled, I found reams of novels called Comeback, many of them in the crime genre – a rather misleading flavour.\n\nNot only that, I couldn’t remember Comeback. I simply couldn’t. In my mind, it became Countdown, though lord knows why. If it couldn’t stick for me, it certainly wouldn’t for a reader. Anyway, Ever Rest suits its mood far better.\n\nOn the show, Peter Snell added the bookseller’s perspective on commonly used titles. It’s a right royal pain to find the book the customer actually wants.\n\nTip: Once you’ve identified a feeling or theme you might highlight in a title, you can brainstorm strong, striking and emotive words for it.\n\nAgain, how memorable?\n\nIf your name is well known, you don’t have to try that hard with the title. Readers know to look for the next book by you. They’re more likely to find you by searching for your name, not your book title. On the show we discussed how the fantasy author Jack Vance (whose work I love) has many titles that are little more than labels (The Planet of Adventure, Trullion).\n\nDaphne Du Maurier, Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte all got away with name-titles (Rebecca, Emma, Jane Eyre). But they were writing in less competitive times. Would Lewis Carroll have got very far if he’d published Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland today?\n\nThanks for the pic Lisby\n\nOh, and speaking of titles with a number…\n\nThere’s a lot more about writing in my Nail Your Novel books – find them here. If you’re curious about my own work, find novels here and my travel memoir here. And if you’re curious about what’s going on at my own writing desk, here’s my latest newsletter.
