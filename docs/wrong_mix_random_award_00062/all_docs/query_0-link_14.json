        "text": "Two of the first books that made me a reader were In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works by John Lennon. This was when I was about ten. I already perceived that the Beatles were great humorists and word benders. I even ascribed inventiveness mistakenly to their lexicon, for instance I heard in “Can’t Buy Me Love”: I don’t care to munch for money. Which led me, every time I heard it, to ponder ‘munch’ as long-lost Anglo-Saxon slang for grovel or toil in a crummy job.\n\nIn the jesting and silliness, in the ridiculous characters and names, was this great spirit of rebellion:\n\nAraminta Ditch was always larfing. She woof larf at these, larf at thas. Always larfing she was. Many body people woof look atat her saying, ‘Why does that Araminta Ditch keeplarfing?’ They could never understamp why she was ever larfing about the place. ‘I hope she’s not at all larfing at me,’ some peokle would say, ‘I certainly hope that Araminta Ditch is not larfing at me.’\n\nThe scope of John’s newfangled vocabulary was practically Shakespearean!\n\nThere were serious books important to me too. Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage, in 9th grade, made me feel like a serious reader. I understood that a central wound (in this case Philip’s clubfoot) motivated the reading experience I was most after.\n\nElizabeth McKenzie is the author of the novel The Portable Veblen; a collection, Stop That Girl, shortlisted for the Story Prize; and the novel MacGregor Tells the World, a Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, and School Library Journal best book of the year.
