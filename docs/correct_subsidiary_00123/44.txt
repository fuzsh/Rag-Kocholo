StumbleUpon has announced that its original owners have bought the company back from eBay.

eBay bought the site two years ago for $75 million, but has now sold it back to co-founders Garrett Camp and Geoff Smith, along with a group of investors.

On the official StumbleUpon blog, Camp said: "After nearly two years as a subsidiary of eBay, today StumbleUpon returns to being an independent company."

"This change will help StumbleUpon move quickly and stay true to its focus - helping people discover interesting web content. Our goal is to make StumbleUpon the web's largest recommendation engine and we think this is the best way to get us there."

He also stated in the blog that there was "more good news to come" so further changes seem likely to happen at the company.
