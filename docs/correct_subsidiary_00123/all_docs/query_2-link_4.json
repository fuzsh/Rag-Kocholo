        "text": "This has been a huge day for technology announcements and deals, the latest being the confirmation from eBay that StumbleUpon, a browser plugin that helps users discover sites that fit their specific interests, has been acquired for $75 million. Michael Buhr, senior director at eBay said, “StumbleUpon’s downloadable toolbar provides an engaging and unique experience to its users, but it is the similarities in our approaches to the concept of community that make it such a compelling addition to eBay.”\n\nOm Malik points out an interesting scenario for the new acquisiton: “By marrying the toolbar to Skype client, eBay can do an end run around Google’s dominance of the search business. A simple search box inside Skype client is all it would take.” A great observation, because we all know, no matter how many denials we all hear, the number game in Silicon Valley now is: Find a way to do significant business online “without” Google’s involvement, and you’ll have found the goose that lays the golden eggs.\n\nPictured right: StumbleUpon co-founder and Chief Architect, Garrett Camp\n\nApple to Allow Rivals to Access ‘Tap and Go’ Technology\n\nIn the latest iOS overhaul prompted by European Union rules, the smartphone maker will give third-party developers access to its payment technology.\n\nThe Architect of Russia’s Google Is Back\n\nYandex cofounder Arkady Volozh fought off sanctions and kicked anti-war squatters out of his Amsterdam townhouse.

You’re Still on Zoom\n\nTech founders painted a vision of employees clocking into virtual workplaces. But the adoption of VR at work has been slow.\n\nOpenAI Wants AI to Help Humans Train AI\n\nHaving humans rate a language model’s outputs produced clever chatbots. OpenAI says adding AI to the loop could help make them even smarter and more reliable.\n\nActivists Disrupt Amazon Conference Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n\nMembers of the activist group No Tech for Apartheid interrupted a senior Amazon executive's speech at a conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday over the company's Project Nimbus cloud contract.\n\nYouTube’s Rulings on Gaza War Videos Spark Internal Backlash\n\nInsiders have shared YouTube’s playbook for handling the Gaza crisis.
