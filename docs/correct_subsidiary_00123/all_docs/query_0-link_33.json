        "text": "eBay announced on Wednesday that it acquired StumbleUpon, a software startup that suggests websites based on reader reviews and personal preferences of its members.\n\nThe $US75 million cash acquisition gives eBay access to about 2.3 million people who have filled out profiles at StumbleUpon, founded in 2001 by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary.\n\nThe venture capital-funded company, which recently relocated to San Francisco, is considered a pioneer of the so-called \"Web 3.0\" niche.\n\nThe term refers to technology that pairs general internet search capability with a user's personal data and aggregated community data, theoretically delivering more relevant results than a standard search engine such as Google.\n\nFor example, a StumbleUpon search for \"cars\" could generate a list of Web pages that factor in a user's income, age, gender, home address, current vehicles owned and other demographic data submitted.\n\nThe search results would also include sites ranked favorably by other StumbleUpon members with similar interests and background.\n\nBy contrast, a straight Google search delivers 357 million web pages ranging from the popular Hollywood movie \"Cars\" to advertisements for used car dealers and newspaper classified sections.\n\nStumbleUpon is free for users and generates revenue through advertising, though the company doesn't disclose financial information. Members who pay an annual fee bypass advertisements completely.\n\nThe 12-year-old e-commerce powerhouse had $US3.5 billion in cash last month and has been aggressively acquiring smaller companies to compete against rivals ranging from Google to Amazon.com.\n\neBay, which already owns internet phone service Skype and portals such as Shopping.com and Rent.com, completed the buyout of online ticket reseller StubHub for $US310 million earlier this year.\n\nAP"
