        "text": "Wow, after 16 years, the day has come. Today is the last day that Stumbleupon.com exists online, and as we head into this moment, we want to look back and thank you for making StumbleUpon an internet legend.\n\nBefore posts and tweets, before snaps and pins, StumbleUpon was there providing endless internet entertainment with just the push of a button. Because of users like you, we served up nearly 60 billion stumbles to over 40 million Stumblers, and infinite hours of “woah, cool” moments. StumbleUpon was more than just a button. People connected, made friends, found career inspiration, and even fell in love!\n\n...\n\nThis isn’t “goodbye”; it’s more of a “see ya on the other side”. Recently, we’ve shifted our focus to build a new discovery platform with the lessons we learned from StumbleUpon.\n\nMeet Mix! On Mix, you’ll be able to build shareable collections of your favorite finds across the internet: articles, videos, podcasts, and more. As you curate the web, your saves will turn into meaningful recommendations for others in Mix. We hope to make discovery a collective endeavor, helping each other find gems from the depths of the web that we wouldn’t have come across on our own. And you’ll be in good company with your fellow Stumblers that have already given Mix a try — see Tom and Art. Feeling nostalgic? Take a journey back in time with StumbleUpon Time Machine on Mix.\n\nIf you haven’t yet, we’re excited for you to try out Mix! Hope to see you on the other side."
