        "text": "StumbleUpon, an Internet startup bought by eBay Inc. two years ago for 75 million US dollars, announced on Monday that it had parted ways with the online auction giant.\n\n\"We are grateful to eBay for its guidance,\" said Garrett Camp, one of the founders of StumbleUpon, which had been an eBay subsidiary.\n\n\"However, we realized there were few long-term synergies between the two businesses,\" Camp said in a statement. \"It is best for us to part ways and focus on our respective strengths.\n\n\"This change makes it possible for StumbleUpon to continue to innovate and focus on becoming the Web?s largest recommendation service,\" added Camp, who will serve as chief executive of the company.\n\nTerms of the separation were not disclosed.\n\nCamp said StumbleUpon had now \"returned to the ranks of an investor-backed startup\" and had received backing from Sherpalo Ventures, Accel Partners, and August Capital.\n\nThe statement said StumbleUpon plans to unveil several new products and features in the coming months.\n\nUnlike Google and other search engines designed to help people efficiently scour the Internet with specific targets in mind, StumbleUpon's \"discovery engine\" finds websites that promise to appeal to users' passions.\n\nFounded in 2001, it claims more than 7.4 million users.\n\nThe separation comes as eBay refocuses its activities on its core business of running an online auction house.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that eBay may be looking to sell its hugely popular Internet telephone service Skype back to its two founders.\n\nNiklas Zennstrom, from Sweden, and Janus Friis, from Denmark, founded Skype in 2003 and sold it to eBay two years later for 2.6 billion US dollars.\n\nThey are now seeking to raise one billion US dollars from private equity firms to re-claim their brainchild, according to the Times.\n\nSkype, which has its headquarters in Luxembourg, bypasses the standard telephone network by channeling calls over the Internet."
