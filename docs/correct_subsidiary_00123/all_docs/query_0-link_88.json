        "text": "eBay has bought StumbleUpon, a site for sharing web sites, for around $75 million. The press release says it's grown 150% over the past year and \"delivers approximately five million new recommendations a day to its large, highly engaged user base\". What eBay doesn't explain is why. With previous purchases such as PayPal, Skype and Shopping.com, there did seem to be a rationale, but this one escapes me.\n\nOne of the hottest web trends right now is widgets - whether web-based, or OS-based like Apple's Dashboard or Microsoft's Gadgets. They are simple apps that are simple to build. We also got a look under the hood of Joost, the hot IPTV startup, from the team behind Skype.\n\nMichael Arrington of TechCrunch has produced a list of Web 2.0 Companies [He] Couldn't Live Without, including Bloglines, Delicious, FeedBurner, Measuremap, Omnidrive, Technorati... Whoops, sorry, that was last year's list. This year the list includes Amie Street, Ask City, BlueDot, Digg, Gmail, Skype and YouTube. Seven of last year's 11 sites have survived, including Flickr, Netvibes, Pandora, and WordPress.\n\nI reported Sony's Mylo (My Life Online) gadget in today's Technology section, but not everyone is happy with what it offers. Phil Wolff's Skype Journal has some major complaints and a list of 14 things Sony can do to try to save it. Alice Hill's RealTechNews has 5 Reasons Why the Sony Mylo is Doomed to Failure. This story concludes:\n\nA Skype press release hit the wires the other day, announcing Skype 1.5 for Mac OSX. Eagerly we scanned it, and found.. no mention of video calling. This seemed strange (well, maybe not) since Skype for PCs has had video since December, and Steve Jobs has been showing off video chats over iChat since June 2003 (and boy, doesn't that one get boring quite quick).\n\n\"EMI Music Publishing, the song rights company, yesterday announced a deal with Skype, the internet telephony business, to sell music on Skype's new retail website. Under the deal, Skype will be licensed to use song copyrights from EMI's catalogue to sell music as downloads and ring tones,\" reports The Times Online.\n\nOver at TechCruch, Michael Arrington has an interesting post about Evoca, which lets you record and publish voice recordings, including (for a fee) Skype calls. As he says, \"Evoca has basically created a podcasting blog for each user.\"\n\nThe blogosphere is going bananas about Fon, a start-up company that plans to create \"a global network of shared Wi-Fi connections,\" mainly because its backers include Skype and Google as well as venture capital firms. It's just received $21.7 million in backing. According to The New York Times:\n\n\"Internet search engine Google has retaken first place in the 2005 global poll of the world's most influential brands, while the eBay-owned web phone service Skype makes its debut at No 3,\" reports Reuters.\n\nThe past few weeks have seen some serious action from some of the web's biggest players. From Google's attempt to take on everybody and everything, to eBay's multibillion purchase of Skype, the heat is on.\n\nAccording to reports in the US press, Google is preparing to launch its own instant messaging platform - and it could even be ready to take on Skype in the nascent area of internet telephony.\n\nAs the co-founder of both Kazaa and Skype, Niklas Zennstrom has been knee-deep in two of the most disruptive technologies over the past decade - filesharing and internet telephony. This pulse-fingering Swedish entrepreneur has made the most of peer-to-peer developments... but what did he have to say when our very own Hamish Mackintosh interviewed him?"
