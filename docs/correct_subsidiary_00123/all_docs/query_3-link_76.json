        "text": "It’s a problem that has plagued Garrett Camp for over 16 years: How do you find interesting things on the internet if you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for?\n\nThe Web was a different place in 2001 when Camp first founded StumbleUpon, which became a mainstay of Web discovery in the 2000s. Back then, people could click a button and “stumble” to a website that matched their interests. It felt more like channel-surfing Web pages and users could give a thumbs up or thumbs down to the sites they found intriguing.\n\nNow in 2018, the signal-to-noise ratio is bothering Camp once again. More people on the internet means more content, and social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest can create a never-ending scrolling feed of links and photos and life updates. Nearly 17 years after he first launched StumbleUpon, Camp is building off what he learned and applying it to a new company, called Mix.\n\n“In a way, Mix is still trying to solve the problems that StumbleUpon was. It’s just when StumbleUpon was created the web was such a different place. There weren’t really social networks yet. In the same way, there weren’t really mobile phones yet,” Camp told Forbes. “Mix is still trying to achieve the same mission, but we’re just incorporating a social element into Mix from day one this time.”\n\nHere’s how it works: Anyone can sign up through one of a variety of social networks, from Facebook accounts to old StumbleUpon logins. People can select a few topics they’re interested in and then see a feed filled with recommendations of articles, photos, videos, podcasts, or anything else other users have found interesting. Like a Pinterest board or bookmark, Mix users can save what they like into shareable collections like cooking or mental health.\n\nBut Mix is more than just acting upon your likes. Camp wants Mix to become the first feed that gets a mix of semantics and social right. If a friend with mutual interests shares an article or a video, that sends a stronger signal to Mix that you might be interested in that article. People can also follow curators or just their specific collections. In other words, if you trust a friend who is a good cook to select recipes, but hate their taste in music, you can choose to follow only their recipe collection.\n\nA “for you” feed helps surface articles you may find interesting, and then you can add them to your own collections. After selecting cooking and writing as two of this Forbes reporter’s interests, Mix showed me a story on how to eat cheaply in Disney’s Animal Kingdom, a guide to pitfalls while making risotto, and an article on 45 words I should use instead of “very.” For Camp, the goal is to look at the first ten things and to have a higher percentage of things you like or find interesting compared to when you open up an app like Twitter or Facebook.\n\n“The core idea is that we’re actually going to create a better feed. The feed will be less of the stuff you don’t like, more stuff that you do like, and more of the hidden gems bubbling up because you follow people who have obscure interests and whenever they post something it comes up in your feed,” Camp said.\n\nWhile anyone can be a curator, Mix will offer incentives like priority placement to the creators and bloggers who help it craft collections of content. One collection called “Out of this world” is a mix of articles and YouTube videos on space. Another, the “Jetsetters” collection, had articles ranging from a guide to glamping (camping with luxury amenities) to why passports only come in four colors.\n\nIt’s the type of content that Camp finds gets lost in today’s saturated media world. Platforms like Pinterest and YouTube do a great job collecting photos or videos, Camp says. Forums like Reddit gather people around their interests, but people subscribe to constantly updating communities. Facebook is better for life moments and wedding announcements, whereas Twitter is an entirely unfiltered stream of what’s happening in the world at any given minute. It takes work to find interesting articles on architecture that have already been filtered to know that they’re interesting, and Camp wants Mix to be a better feed for people to find what fascinates them.\n\n“A lot of it is just that Twitter and Facebook are designed for different purposes,” Camp says. “There just hasn’t been a mainstream discovery system yet that has been at the intersection of semantic and social filtering, purely for websites.”\n\nThe company also hasn’t abandoned its StumbleUpon roots entirely. After founding the web discovery startup in 2001 with friends from his grad school dorm, Camp relocated to San Francisco to build out the company. By 2007, eBay put in an offer to acquire it, buying the company for $75 million. StumbleUpon operated within eBay for a few years before eBay looked to spin it out into an independent company. In 2009, Camp and some of his original cofounders, along with a team of investors, bought back StumbleUpon from eBay and returned it to a venture-backed startup with Camp as CEO.\n\nFrom there StumbleUpon, well, stumbled. Camp stepped down as CEO in 2012 to work on other business ventures. Meanwhile, Camp’s other idea for a company called UberCab grew into the global transportation giant that is today known as Uber. Camp stayed on the board of Uber, but since 2013 has been largely focused on his startup studio, Expa.\n\nIn 2015, Camp became StumbleUpon's majority shareholder. The company had over 30 million registered users but was struggling financially. At the time, Camp said he would explore what synergies could exist between StumbleUpon and Expa. Three years later, StumbleUpon reached its final chapter when it shut down on June 30, directing all users to join Mix instead.\n\n“I still like the StumbleUpon brand, but to me, it sort of represents an old system. That was my take at the time of ‘Hey, wouldn’t it be cool to channel surf the Web instead of search?” Camp said. “I like the idea of Mix being a collection of diverse groups of content.”\n\nCamp started kicking around the idea of Mix within Expa two years ago and has scaled the team of engineers and designers to more than 20 people, including some former StumbleUpon employees. Instead of launching just another version of StumbleUpon with social networks and a mobile app added, Mix was built from the ground up with all new code and design, a process that took over a year. The one advantage Mix does have from absorbing StumbleUpon’s roots is the data: after the last 16 years of people liking or disliking websites, Mix already has a head start in knowing what websites people like and what Web pages might be problematic.\n\n\"We’re trying to combine social endorsement and semantic filtering, what you like and who recommended it. I feel like the combination of those two things hasn’t been done well on any major platform,” Camp said.\n\nToday, Mix has fewer than 100,000 users, although more people are joining on as StumbleUpon finally shuttered. In the same way he handed off Uber to Travis Kalanick about 12 months in, Camp is looking to hire a full-time CEO to grow Mix now that the beginning product strategy and design are done. Camp has been working as its head of product and temporary CEO, but is splitting his time between four different projects as well as Expa. Camp also had to take time away from Mix last year as the Uber drama unfolded, which took up the majority of his time between March until September. “Last year it was a lot of lessons learned, it was extremely educational and extremely stressful and now it’s a little bit more calm, a little more peaceful,” he said.\n\nWith StumbleUpon shut down, Camp’s first chapter of his journey to solve the internet discovery problem is done. Mix is still in its early days, but Camp says the results so far have him excited about this next chapter. “I’m pretty pleased that when I flip through ten sites, I get good stuff,” he said."
