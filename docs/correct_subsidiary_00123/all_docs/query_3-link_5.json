        "text": "Last week I was on the MIT campus where I interviewed Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, the San Francisco-based company that allows users to organize and recommend online videos. The company was sold to eBay in June for $75 million.\n\nGarrett, 28, was honored by MIT’s Technology Review as one of the one of the world’s most accomplished innovators under 35.\n\nThe company was covered in a big story in today’s New York Times.\n\nGarrett told me that not a lot has changed since the acquisition and that StumbleUpon still operates largely independently from eBay.\n\nThe company has recently introduced a novel advertising approach: Advertisers can sign up to have a particular Web page \"served\" into the process of \"stumbling.\" Meaning, users who are looking for a topic and click a video to view will be shown a web page that matches the demographic and interests of the \"stumbler.\"\n\nGarrett explains that there are few of these pages served — just about one in twenty \"stumbles\" find an inserted advertiser Web page. We assume that the page loads for a limited time and then leads to the requested video.\n\nIn our interview he also explains how the demographics of StumbleUpon are moving past the \"early adopters.\"\n\nFor background and a demonstration of StumbeUpon, check out my interview with Garrett from December.\n\nGrab the embed code of this interview with Garrett Camp.\n\n— Andy Plesser"
