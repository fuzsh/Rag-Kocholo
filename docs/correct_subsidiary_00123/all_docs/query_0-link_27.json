        "text": "Yesterday eBay confirmed the rumors that it has acquired StumbleUpon, a really great web service that helps you discover interesting websites through user recommendations. Over the last year I’ve seen an increasing amount of traffic coming in from StumbleUpon, which lasts a longer period of time with more engaged visitors, compared to other services that just send a high volume of traffic in short spikes, sending visitors that are not as interested in the content. It will be interesting to see how eBay integrates StumbleUpon into their existing services and how StumbleUpon will grow with their newly added resources.\n\nCongratulations to Garrett Camp and the whole StumbleUpon crew.\n\nAccording to Om Malik, eBay paid $75 million for StumbleUpon. Here’s more coverage from TechCrunch and Mashable."
