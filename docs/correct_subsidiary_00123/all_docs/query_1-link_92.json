        "text": "How does StumbleUpon make money?\n\nStumbleUpon is an \"established company with a real business model,\" Leibowitz said. That business model consists of one product: Paid Discovery. Five percent of stumbles are reserved for advertisers, meaning users hit a sponsored page about every 20 stumbles. The sponsored pages are clearly but not obnoxiously marked with a green starburst and the word \"Sponsored.\"\n\nAdvertisers pay StumbleUpon between $.05 and $.25 for the delivery of a visitor. Advertisers can filter by interest, location, and demographics; they can pay only for \"engaged visitors,\" which StumbleUpon determines by a secret mix of clicks and time spent on the page. \"We do use it and we love it,\" BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti told The Verge in an email. BuzzFeed, which is in a similar business of driving traffic to brands, uses StumbleUpon to boost traffic to its own sponsored posts. \"When we notice a brand post that is doing well on StumbleUpon we often spend to add fuel to the fire.\"\n\nBuzzFeed is the perfect StumbleUpon advertiser: Peretti and his team intuitively understand why paid discovery works. \"There's lots more they could do to add to the product but it is pretty impressive how simple and powerful it is already,\" Peretti said. \"It's advertising without ad units — pretty neat trick!\"\n\nStumbleUpon’s pitch is tough for other brands. Advertising with Paid Discovery is a bit more work than a search or banner ad. The entire page is the advertisement, meaning brands need to create a website that will appeal to someone who is in the middle of casually browsing the web."
