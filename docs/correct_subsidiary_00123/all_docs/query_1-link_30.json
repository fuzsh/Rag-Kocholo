        "text": "NEW DELHI: Nasdaq-listed eBay Inc, worldâs leading online marketplace, on Thursday announced the acquisition of StumbleUpon, an early-stage company, that helps people share content online, for $75 million in an all-cash deal. Last month, eBay had $3.5 billion in cash and has been out shopping, buying firms like Shopping.com and StubHub. StumbleUpon is a website that recommends other websites and helps organise individual interests on the web.\n\nâStumbleUpon is a great fit within our goal of pioneering new communities based on commerce and sustained by trust,â said Michael Buhr, senior director, eBay. Buhr will serve as general manager of StumbleUpon with immediate effect. StumbleUponâs current founders and management team would be retained and would work with Buhr.\n\nWith social networking already gaining ground amongst the net users all over the world, eBay sees a new and young market in the StumbleUpon users which number around 2.3 million, said Deepa Thomas, the spokesperson for eBay India, adding that even though there is not going to be any immediate implication of the deal on the Indian operations, the long term prospects of web organising would be extremely helpful for the eBay users.\n\nSocial networking sites are the hippest âmeeting marketsâ around. Founded just six years back by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary, StumbleUpon encourages and allows people to discover and recommend websites, people, videos, product information, communities and other online content based on personal interests and community recommendations. The recommendation features woven into StumbleUpon could work for the 233 million eBay users to locate auctions that may interest them.\n\nThe site is free for users. However, the users have a choice to pay an annual fee to avoid seeing any ads. The StumbleUpon community has grown 150% annually and delivers approximately five million new recommendations a day to its large, highly engaged user base."
