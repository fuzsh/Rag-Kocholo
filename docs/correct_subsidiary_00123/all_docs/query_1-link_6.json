        "text": "When is a startup not a startup? When it's got something to do with eBay, as far as I can tell.\n\nThe question isn't some kind of Zen riddle, but my immediate reaction to the news that StumbleUpon and eBay were parting ways - just two years after the auction giant sloshed $75m on buying the web discovery service. The deal initially resulted in plenty of head-scratching action, but since the buyout the service appeared to plod on well enough.\n\nBut today the companies have announced that co-founders Garrett Camp and Geoff Smith - along with a team of investors - have bought SU back. Meaning, I suppose, that it's a startup again. An official entry on the StumbleUpon blog suggests eBay had a lack of ambition, saying that \"our goal is to make StumbleUpon the web's largest recommendation engine and we think this is the best way to get us there\".\n\nIt still leaves a big question about where StumbleUpon goes in the future - after all, if venture-backed startups have two ways to rake in cash (the stock market and acquisition) then who's going to take on eBay's sloppy seconds?"
