        "text": "1. The Online Discovery Networking Tool By: Kathleen M. Vogel http://www.stumbleupon.com/productdemo StumbleUpon\n\n2.

StumbleUpon Today  Headquartered in California  Acquired over 8.5 million members  Largest personalized content discovery engine on the Web  425 million recommendations a month and growing\n\n4. How Stumbling Works  High Quality pages matched to personal preferences\n\n5. One Way To Stumble….\n\n6. Sharing Video Content  Via Email, Facebook, Twitter\n\n7. Benefits of Stumbling  Channel surfing video  Sharing with friends  Discovering content for yourself  Combats information overload  Personalized browsing  Just click Stumble: Simple/Easy to use  Advertise your content  A way to have your content stumbled\n\n8. StumbleUpon vs. Pandora  Sharing Emphasized  Facebook  Twitter  Email  Money Maker: Advertising  “Stumbling” for Music vs. “Stumbling” for Video + Text\n\n9. Stumbling vs. Googling  Both find things on the web.  Discovery over utilitarian searching  Google’s huge!  Both use advertising but ads are shown differently\n\n10. Stumbling vs. Digging  Both are built through user submissions  Both deliver a sense of “discovery” to visitors  Digg lacks personalization and does not recommend stories  Digg does not cluster its users and make recommendations based on social network  StumbleUpon doesn’t cover breaking news very well  Digg is better at covering tech, world or other news.  Digg has all stories at once vs. in StumbleUpon showing one story at a time\n\n11. Bibliography  http://www.searchenginejournal.com/stumble- upon-interview-series-stumbleupon-defined- vs-digg-google-myspace-and-more/4414/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon  http://www.stumbleupon.com/aboutus/  www.pandora.com  www.digg.com  www.google.com  www.stumbleupon.com\n\n12. Deli.cio.us  StumbleUpon vs. Deli.cio.us  They are both ways to save and record wonderful bits of information you experience as you cruise the web and they both have browser-side gizmos for users.  The interfaces are radically different, though I suspect you’ll get more link and SEM value from Deli.cio.us in the short term."
