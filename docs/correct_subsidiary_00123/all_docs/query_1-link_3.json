Kara Swisher has the story at All Things Digital.\n\nThe company has organized millions of visitors who refer video and other content favorites to each other. Beet videos are Stumbled quite a lot, and we hope that Garrett and his crew can continue the good work.\n\nIn June I interviewed Garret here in New York. He explains how his company can help publishers in getting their archives discovered. I've republished the interview today.\n\nHere's an analysis of the news by MG Siegler at TechCrunch.\n\n— Andy Plesser, Executive Producer"
