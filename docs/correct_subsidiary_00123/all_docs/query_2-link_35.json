Wow.\n\nOm Malik has a very interesting take on the deal.\n\nI’ve posted my video interview with StumbleUpon co-founder Garrett Camp on this page. Garrett is very nice chap from Canada who moved to San Francisco not too long ago. Here’s my original post.\n\nI reached a company spokesperson by phone a short time ago who declined to comment on the purported acquisition, citing a policy of \"not commenting on rumors.\"\n\n— Andy Plesser"
