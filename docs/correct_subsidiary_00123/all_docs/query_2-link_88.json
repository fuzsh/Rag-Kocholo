Still, they’ve got something in the Mix for old Stumblers.\n\nStumbling since 2002\n\nStumbleUpon will cease at the end of June.\n\nAs a ‘recommendation engine’, it used to be big. It was a staple on content-site social links. It could drive traffic and launch virals. It was a leader in using big data to customise individual experiences.\n\neBay saw StumbleUpon’s potential, and acquired it for $75 Million in 2007. Founder Garret Camp regained control years later. But he couldn’t save it… or could he?\n\nFold or move\n\nAccording to Camp, StumbleUpon catered to over 40 million users, and served up nearly 60 billion stumbles. But, it apparently slipped from modern content discovery trends.\n\nThe homepage now says it’s ‘moving to Mix on June 30th.’ This seems to mean that remaining StumbleUpon accounts are getting auto-migrated to a new platform.\n\nNext, Mix\n\nMix.com—another Camp creation—claims to be ‘All your favourite things. All in one place.’ He thinks we still ‘need better tools to help us filter through… content on the web’\n\nCamp says his team has learned ‘that while simplicity and serendipity is important, so is enabling contextual curation (i.e. “cool space photos”) instead of just clicking “I like it”.’\n\nMix sounds like it might be a next-gen StumbleUpon, with more machine learning and a bit of Pinterest thrown in. Do you consider this move a genuine migration, or a stealthy rebrand while adding features?"
