        "text": "“ There's a good man within you... But he is wrestling with a giant. „ —Mary's last words to Arthur\n\nMary Linton (née Gillis) is a supporting character featured in Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nDuring her youth, Mary was in a romantic relationship with Arthur Morgan and the two were deeply in love, but it ultimately fell through due to Arthur's life as an outlaw and affiliation with the Van der Linde gang, leading to prevalent disapproval from her family as a result, particularly her father.\n\nAfterward, Mary eventually married a man named Barry Linton and took on his surname. Barry later passed away after contracting pneumonia, leaving her a widow. To make matters worse, her family grew to be dysfunctional as well; her younger brother, Jamie had joined Chelonia, an infamous fanatical cult, while her father gradually became more withdrawn and verbally abusive to his children, growing increasingly dependent on alcohol, whoring, gambling, and eventually began pawning off much of their family's property.\n\nEvents of Red Dead Redemption 2[]\n\nHorseshoe Overlook Chapter[]\n\nMary contacts Arthur for the first time in many years and pleads for his help in convincing Jamie to leave the Chelonians. Arthur is apprehensive due to poor relations with the Gillis family but admits that he was at least on good terms with Jamie. If Arthur accepts, he successfully chases down Jamie and persuades him to leave the Chelonians, before taking him to Mary at Valentine train station. Mary thanks Arthur for his help and then boards the train with Jamie to return home. After this, Arthur laments how he feels both elated and foolish for how Mary can manipulate him and resigned to the fact that he would not be able to refuse her. He also writes his initials and Mary's in his journal with a heart between them.\n\nSaint Denis Chapter[]\n\nMary later asks Arthur for help with her father, much to Arthur's ire. Mary begs for his help and tries to justify her father's poor treatment of him, but Arthur angrily points out that Mary's \"pure life\" hasn't fared well at all, referencing Jamie joining the Chelonians, Mr. Gillis' deeply hypocritical and deplorable habits, and the fact that she was now begging him for help. If Arthur accepts, he accompanies Mary to Mr. Gillis, who verbally abuses Mary before storming off. Arthur and Mary follow Mr. Gillis to an alley and discover him selling a brooch gifted to Mary by her mother. Dismayed at what she had seen, Mary angrily confronts her father, as Arthur goes to take the brooch back from the buyer named Ashton. After Arthur gets the brooch, he returns to the alley and finds Mary sitting down dejectedly, expressing indifference to wherever her father went.\n\nAfter the situation with Mr. Gillis, Mary asks Arthur if they could go to the theater together as friends. If Arthur accepts, he takes Mary there and the two begin to warm up to each other and reconnect. After the performance, Arthur walks Mary to the trolley. As they reach their destination, Mary laments the deteriorating state of her life and asks if it is too late for her and Arthur. Arthur admits that he does want to run away and be with her, but states he does not want Mary to get hurt, he has people in the gang to take care of, and that they need money. Arthur promises that his gang life is really coming to an end this time and as soon as he can get some money, they can run away. The two part ways again for the final time.\n\nBeaver Hollow Chapter[]\n\nArthur later receives a letter from Mary, enclosed with the engagement ring he gave her many years ago. In the letter she says her goodbyes to him and that it was time to let each other go, as he never kept his promise to show up after the supposed final robbery. She acknowledges that Arthur is unlikely to ever leave his life behind and apologizes for how their relationship turned out. She hopes that the ring can be passed down to another couple in love in order to help them too.\n\nIf \"Of Men and Angels\" is completed and Arthur has high honor, he will meet Sister Calderón at Emerald Station during \"The Fine Art of Conversation\", in which Arthur mentions Mary when conversing with her, describing her as \"a girl who loved me\" and regretting giving up the chance to run away with her.\n\nMary's final words to Arthur are some of what he reflects upon during his last ride.\n\nEpilogue[]\n\nMary's ring is used by John Marston in his proposal to Abigail Roberts. During the credits, Mary is seen visiting Arthur's grave, quietly weeping for his loss.\n\nCharacter[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMary is a well-meaning woman, who tries to see the best in people and most situations. She loves her family but tries to see past its apparent dysfunction, the brunt of which is attributed to her father.\n\nShe loved Arthur and desired to have a life with him, even retaining feelings for him over the years. However, she acknowledges that Arthur's preference for his criminal lifestyle would prevent them from ever having a future together, eventually coming to terms with it and deciding to cut ties with him. Despite that, Mary visited Arthur's grave and wept for him, showing that she still loved him enough to overlook his faults.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nMary has long, dark brown hair, tanned skin, brown eyes, and a beauty mark on her right cheek. In her first appearance, her hair is tied back in a low braid and is then tied back in a low bun for the rest of her appearances.\n\nIn her first appearance, Mary wears a dark green blouse with light brown ruffles on the front, a gold brooch with a red stone, a brown belt with a gold buckle, and a long dark blue skirt. In her second appearance, Mary wears a pale blue shirt over a checkered yellow dress with a long skirt of the same color. She will always be wearing worn brown boots with light brown half chaps.\n\nMission appearances[]\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\n\"We Loved Once and True I\" (voice only)\n\n\"We Loved Once and True II\"\n\n\"We Loved Once and True III\"\n\n\"\"Fatherhood and Other Dreams I\" (voice only)\n\n\"Fatherhood and Other Dreams II\"\n\n\"A Fork in the Road\" (voice only)\n\n\"Goodbye, Dear Friend\" (voice only)\n\n\"The Fine Art of Conversation\" (indirectly mentioned, determinant)\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption\" (voice only)\n\nEnding Credits\n\nQuotes[]\n\n“ I've... You're... Oh, you'll never change. I know that. „ —Mary to Arthur, before boarding the train at the end of \"We Loved Once and True III\".\n\n“ There's a good man within you... But he is wrestling with a giant. „ —Mary in her last letter to Arthur; the line Arthur remembers from Mary during his last ride, with high Honor.\n\n“ I see clearly that your world is not a world from which one can escape. „ —Mary in her last letter to Arthur; the line Arthur remembers from Mary during his last ride, with low Honor.\n\n“ I understand if you don't wanna help me, but… but… I think of you often. „ —Mary trying to convince Arthur to help her; the line Arthur remembers from Mary during \"A Fork in the Road\", if his Honor is high.\n\n“ Don't make me beg you, Arthur. „ —The line Arthur remembers from Mary during \"A Fork in the Road\", if his honor is low.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nShould Arthur refuse to assist Mary in \"We Loved Once and True II\", the contents of her letters will also change slightly depending on whether Arthur previously helped her out.\n\nSusan Grimshaw expresses her disdain for Mary, stating that she \"never liked her\". Similarly, Tilly Jackson says to Arthur that Linton is \"not worth it\". Mary-Beth Gaskill says to Arthur that Mary was a fool in \"No, No and Thrice, No\". This line can also be heard in \"A Fork in the Road\" if the player has high honor. Mary-Beth additionally mentions her in several private conversations at Horseshoe Overlook and Beaver Hollow. John Marston will also mention Mary once in \"The Sheep and the Goats\" when the two of them are arguing and comparing their own lives. Karen Jones asks Arthur if he will get back with Mary to which he responds that \"it's too late\".\n\nAbigail Roberts on the other hand will mention that she \"always liked\" Mary.[1] Considering that Abigail joined the gang in 1894, this implies that Arthur's relationship with Mary before the latter got married must have lasted at least until then.\n\nFor the credits scene where she cries over Arthur's grave, her motion-capture was done by Roger Clark,[2] who is Arthur's mo-cap, voice actor, and face.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
