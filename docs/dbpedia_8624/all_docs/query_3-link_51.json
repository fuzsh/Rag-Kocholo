        "text": "The following is a list of the descendants that sailed over to the New World on the Mayflower. The information was compiled by Judy Cunniff, an archivist with the Chatham Historical Society:\n\nAlden\n\nJohn Alden immigrated to Plymouth on the Mayflower 1620. Plymouth Gov. William Bradford, in his 1651 account of the Mayflower families, wrote: “John Alden was hired a cooper at Southampton where the ship victualled, and being a hopeful young man was much desired but left to his own liking to go or stay when he came here; but he stayed and married here”. [Bradford 443] John was 21 when he joined the Mayflower crew with the agreement to stay for one year. He signed the Mayflower Compact, considered the first democratic document in the New World.\n\nJohn Alden received acreage in the 1623 land division and was named in John Howland’s company in the 1627 division of cattle. There are numerous land transactions within the Colony where John acquired additional acreage and later deeded much of his land to his children for the benefit of their families. The 1687 inventory of his estate was valued at £49 17s 6d, all “moveables”.\n\nJohn must have had a degree of education, indicated by his appointments as colony treasurer and to committees revising the laws. He was a Deputy from Duxbury to the Plymouth General Court in years between 1641 and 1646. He served as acting Governor of the Colony on at least two occasions.\n\nJohn was frequently on the committee on the Kennebec trade. In 1634 he became involved in an incident where a group of Plymouth men became at odds with a group of the Piscataqua settlement (later Dover) men. One man from each group was killed and John was held in Boston until the conflict was resolved [Bradford 262-68].\n\nJohn Alden and Priscilla Mullens, herself a Mayflower passenger, married about 1623 in Plymouth Colony. The Longfellow poem “The Courtship of Myles Standish”, made famous the names of J. Their children:\n\nElizabeth married in 1644 William, son of John Pabodie [Duxbury c.1635]; she died in 1717, Little Compton RI in her 94th year.\n\nJohn married in 1660 Elizabeth Everill, widow of Abiell. John died in 1702\n\nJoseph married about 1660 Mary, daughter of Moses Simonson/Simmons [Fortune 1621]\n\nPriscilla (unmarried 1688)\n\nJonathan married 1672 Abigail, daughter of Andrew Hallet [Marygould 1635], and died 1697 in Duxbury\n\nSarah married about 1660 Alexander, son of Myles Standish [Mayflower 1620]\n\nRuth married in 1658 John Bass of Braintree [Mass Bay Col 1633]\n\nMary (unmarried 1688)\n\nRebecca married in 1667 Thomas Delano, son of Philip De La Noye [Fortune 1621]\n\nDavid married by 1674 Mary, daughter of Constant Southworth [Plymouth 1628]\n\nAllerton\n\nIsaac, his wife Mary (Norris) Allerton and their children Bartholomew, age 7, Remember, age 5, and Mary, age 3, came on the Mayflower with the Leiden, Holland, group of Separatist Pilgrims. Isaac was a tailor, age 32. With them came a servant boy, John Hooke, age 13, who died in the “first sickness” in 1621.\n\nIsaac was chosen as an assistant to Governor William Bradford in 1621 and “continued sundry years together”. [Bradford 86] In the 1623 division of land, “Mr. Isaak Alerton” received 7 acres and in the 1627 division of cattle, Isaac, his wife Fear, and children Bartholomew, Remember, Mary and Sarah were the first six persons in the 2nd company.\n\nIn 1626, the Colony decided to ‘buy out’ the interests of the London merchants who had financed their 1620 voyage. Isaac Allerton was chosen to represent the Colony and returned to England to negotiate for the purchase.\n\nAt various times, Isaac resided in Plymouth, Marblehead, New Amsterdam (New York City), and New Haven CT. His records may be found in virtually every colony on the Atlantic seaboard and in the Caribbean. The inventory of his estate, taken February 1659, totaled £118 5s 2d but does not begin to illuminate the extent of his business activities.\n\nIsaac married his first wife, Mary Norris, “single woman from Newbury in England” in Leiden on 4 November 1611. Mary (Norris) Allerton died at Plymouth in the ‘first sickness’ in February 1621.\n\nBartholomew, born say 1613, returned to England, became minister at ‘Bamfield’, Suffolk\n\nRemember, born say 1615; married 1635 Moses, son of Rev. John Maverick [Mary & John 1630]\n\nMary, born say 1617; married about 1636 Thomas, son of Robert Cushman [Fortune 1621]; she died 1699, the last of the Mayflower passengers\n\nBetween 1623 and 1627, Isaac married his second wife, Fear Brewster [Anne 1623], daughter of Elder William Brewster [Mayflower 1620]. Fear died in the last months of 1634.\n\nSarah, born Plymouth about 1626; no further record\n\nIsaac, born say 1630; Harvard Class of 1650; married first, about 1652, Elizabeth —- (who MAY have been a daughter of Isaac Sr’s third wife); married second about 1663 in Virginia, Elizabeth (Willoughby) (Overzee) Colclough, daughter of Capt. Thomas Willoughby\n\nIsaac’s third wife was Joanna Swinnerton (“probably the Mrs. Swinnerton who received a grant of land at New Haven on 17 March 1640/1”). They had no children.\n\nBillington\n\nJohn Billington, his wife Ellen (Helen or Elinor), and their children Francis and John came on the Mayflower. In the land division in 1623, he received three acres. In the 1627 division of cattle, they all received a share as Mayflower passengers.\n\nIn the first decade in the Plymouth Colony, John and his sons were often at odds with the authorities. The most significant was their support of a ‘revolt’ against Bradford and the rest of the Leiden contingent.\n\nThe ultimate conflict ended in John Billington being hanged in September 1630 at Plymouth for the murder of John Newcomen.\n\nJohn and Elinor Billington’s children:\n\nJohn, born say 1604 (age 16 in 1620); died at Plymouth between May 1627 and September 1630.\n\nFrancis, born about 1606 (age 14 in 1620 and deposed in 1674, age 68y); he married at Plymouth, July 1634, Christian (Penn) Eaton, widow of Francis Eaton [Mayflower 1620]\n\nBradford\n\nWilliam Bradford, age 30, and his wife, Dorothy (May) Bradford, age 23, immigrated from Leiden to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620. They were part of the Brewster’s Scrooby congregation and the Leiden group of Separatist Pilgrims. He signed the Mayflower Compact. Their son, John was “left behind [in Leiden] who came afterward” [Bradford 441,444].\n\nWilliam was baptized in Austerfield, Yorkshire. Though not educated formally at any university, William was Governor of the Plymouth Colony 1621-33, 1635, 1637, 1639-43 and 1645-56; he was a minister and magistrate; his library one of the most extensive among the early settlers. He was the author of a detailed history of the Scrooby Church which included the history of the foundation of the Plymouth Colony. Much of what is known about the Mayflower passengers comes from this book.\n\nAt his death in 1657, he owned land in Plymouth, Eastham, Bridgewater, Sawtuckett, and Coaksett (Westport Harbor) with rights to the town’s land at Punckatessett\n\nDorothy (May) Bradford died shortly after the Mayflower anchored at Provincetown. Bradford himself reports in 1651 only that she died shortly after their arrival. Some authorities and family legend say she jumped overboard and drowned in Cape Cod Bay.\n\nChild of William and Dorothy:\n\nJohn, born Leiden say 1617; married by 1650 Martha, daughter of Thomas Bourne [Plymouth by 1635]\n\nBradford married second, 14 August 1623 at Plymouth, Alice (Carpenter) Southworth [Anne 1623], daughter of Alexander Carpenter and widow of Edward Southworth.\n\nChildren of William and Alice, born Plymouth:\n\nWilliam, born 17 Jun1624; married 1st by 1650 Alice Richards, daughter of Thomas Richards [Dorchester 1630]; 2nd unknown; 3rd 1676 Mary (Wood) Holmes, daughter of John Wood [Plymouth 1635] and widow of John Holmes\n\nMercy, born by 1627; married Plymouth 21 December 1648, Benjamin Vermayes/Fermais [Mass Bay by 1641]\n\nJoseph, born about 1630; married at Hingham, 25 May 1664, Jael Hobart, daughter of Rev. Peter Hobart and granddaughter of Edmund Hobart [Charlestown 1633]\n\nBrewster\n\nElder Mr. William Brewster was born about 1566, probably at Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, the son of William Brewster, bailiff of the manor house. He was one of the leaders and founding members of the Separatists Congregation at Scrooby, which later evolved into the core of the Pilgrim Church. An Act of Parliament in 1593 had made meetings, such as the Separatist held, illegal. At one point, he was imprisoned for his beliefs. Along with his congregation, he immigrated to Holland, in 1608, seeking religious freedom. They settled first in Amsterdam and later removed to Leiden. Brewster became the elder of their Leiden church, as well as being a printer. He was deposed at Leiden in 1609, aged 42, his wife, age 40, and son Jonathan, age 16.\n\nMr. William Brewster, his wife Mary, and sons Love (age 9) and Wrestling (age 6) Brewster, were passengers on the Mayflower and was a signer of the Compact. His eldest son, Jonathan, came in 1621 in the Fortune, and his daughters, Patience, and Fear, came in 1623 on the Anne.\n\nBrewster was the lay preacher and teacher of the Pilgrim group in Plymouth. As a first comer, he and his family received land in the 1623 division and cattle in the 1627 allotment. Over many years, he acquired more land in Plymouth and Duxbury.\n\nWhen he died in 1644 “a very old age”, his inventory (no real estate included) totaled £150 7d. He was an educated man, his nearly 400 English and Latin books amounted to £42 19s 11d.\n\nWilliam’s wife, Mary (maiden name unknown), died at Plymouth in 1627 “aged”.\n\nThe children of William and Mary Brewster:\n\nJonathan, born 1693 Scrooby, married at Plymouth 1624 “Lucretia Oldham of Darby” [Anne 1623]\n\nPatience, born about 1603; married at Plymouth 1624, Thomas Prence [Fortune 1621] , the first of his four wives\n\nFear, born about 1605; married at Plymouth before 1627 Isaac Allerton [Mayflower 1620]\n\nLove, born about 1607; married at Plymouth 1634, Sarah Collier, daughter of William Collier [Plymouth 1633]\n\nA child, buried Leiden, 1609\n\nWrestling, born about 1611; died unmarried between 1627 and 1651\n\nBrown(e)\n\nPeter Brown immigrated to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620 with no family. He received an acre of land in the 1623 division. Peter, Martha, and Mary Brown are on the list of the 1627 cattle division. He was the brother of John Brown [Plymouth by 1632].\n\nPeter died in 1633, between 25 March (tax list) and 10 October (inventory of his estate).\n\nPeter married 1st, by 1626, Martha [Fortune 1621], the widow of William Ford; she died in 1630-31. Peter married 2nd by 1631, Mary ___, who survived him by at least one year. She had likely died before 1647 when one of her daughters sold land with no reference to the widow’s dower rights.\n\nPeter and Martha (Ford) Brown had the following children:\n\nMary, born about 1626; married by 27 October 1647 Ephraim Tinkham [Plymouth 1634]\n\nPriscilla, born about 1629; married Sandwich 21 March 1649, William Allen\n\nPeter and 2nd wife Mary had the following children:\n\nRebecca, born about 1631; married by about 1654 William Snow [Susan & Ellen 1635]\n\nchild, born by 1633; died in 1647\n\nCarver\n\nMr. John and Katherine Carver immigrated in 1620 on the Mayflower from Leiden, Holland. They were accompanied by a maid (Dorothy? ___) and companion (Desire Mintner) for Katherine and four manservants (John Howland, William Latham, Jasper More, and Roger Wilder).\n\nJohn Carver was one of the most respected members of the Leiden Pilgrims. He and Robert Cushman had traveled to London in the summer of 1620 to arrange the voyage to the Colonies. He signed the Mayflower Compact and was the Governor of the Plymouth Colony upon their landing until his death in early 1621.\n\n“In the month of April, whilst they were busy about their seed, their Governor came out of the field very sick, it being a hot day. He complained greatly of his head and lay down, and within a few hours his senses failed, so he never spake more until he died, which was within a few days after … and his wife being a weak woman, died within five or six weeks after him” [Bradford 86]\n\nJohn and Katherine possibly were the parents of the two children who were buried at St Pancreas, Leiden in 1609 and 1617, respectively.\n\nDesire Mintner\n\nwho was possibly a distant kin, returned to England, and died shortly afterward. [Bradford 441, 443-4]\n\nCarver’s Maid\n\nTeenager on the voyage, may have been the unknown woman who married, as his 2nd wife, Francis Eaton in 1622 and died soon after.\n\nJasper More\n\nage 7 on the voyage, died in the first sickness, possibly as early as December 1620.\n\nWilliam Latham\n\nage 11 on the voyage, received cattle in the 1627 division, had a dwelling house, and twenty acres of land in Duxbury which he sold in 1639. He returned to England after about 20 years in the Colony, then went to the Bahamas “and there with some others was starved for want of food”. [Bradford 441, 444]\n\nRoger Wilder\n\nage 21 on the voyage, died before Mr. Carver “of the common infection”. [Bradford 441, 443]\n\nChilton\n\nJames, his wife, and their daughter Mary, age 13, immigrated from Leiden on the Mayflower in 1620. Another “daughter that was married, came afterward”. It is suggested on reasonable evidence that Mrs. Chilton was Susanne Furner, James’ stepsister.\n\nA record in Leiden from 1619 indicates that James, age 63, and his daughter were assaulted and it is possible that this incident, among others, added to the Pilgrims’ determination to leave for New England.\n\nJames Chilton was among the signers of the Mayflower Compact in Provincetown Harbor. Unfortunately, he died shortly afterward before the ship reached Plymouth. It is a longstanding tradition that Mary Chilton was the first to set foot on Plymouth Rock. Mrs. Chilton died of the first sickness not long after landing at Plymouth. Mary Chilton received an unknown number of acres in the 1623 land division and was listed in the 6th company in the 1627 division of cattle.\n\nJames and his wife had ten children:\n\nIsabella, baptized St. Paul’s, Canterbury, Kent, 1587; married Leiden 21 July 1615 Roger Chandler [Plymouth 1632]\n\nJane, baptized St. Paul’s, Canterbury, 1589; no further record\n\nJoel, buried St. Martin’s, Canterbury, 2 November 1593\n\nMary, buried St. Martin’s, Canterbury, 23 November 1593\n\nElizabeth, baptized St. Martin’s, Canterbury 14 July 1594; no further record\n\nJames, baptized St. Martin’s, Canterbury 22 August 1596; died before September 1603\n\nIngle, baptized St. Paul’s, Canterbury, 29 April 1599; probably the ‘Engeltgen Gilten’ who married Leiden 27 August 1622 Robert Nelson; no further record\n\nChristian, baptized St. Peter’s, Sandwich, Kent, 26 July 1601; no further record\n\nJames, baptized St. Peter’s, Sandwich, 11 September 1603; no further record\n\nMary, baptized St. Peter’s, Sandwich, 30 May 1607; married Plymouth by May 1627 John Winslow [Fortune 1621], brother of Gov. Edward Winslow [Mayflower 1620]\n\nCooke\n\nFrancis Cooke, and his son John, age about 10 years, immigrated from Leiden on the Mayflower in 1620, Francis signing the Mayflower Compact. Francis had married Hester Mahieu in Leiden in 1603. Hester, “and his other children” arrived in 1623 on the Anne. Hester was called “a Walloon of Canterbury” (Walloon being an ethnic group originally from Belgium).\n\nFrancis and his family shared in the 1623 division of land and the 1627 division of cattle. Francis and John were granted more land as the Colony expanded. Francis served on many of the Colony’s committees, often the committee to lay out land and highways. He served on multiple juries from petit jury in 1638 to a coroner’s jury in 1648.\n\nFrancis Cooke died at Plymouth in 1663. Hester died after 1666.\n\nChildren of Francis and Hester (Mahieu) Cooke:\n\nJohn, baptized Leiden Waloon Church 1607; married Plymouth 1634 Sarah Warren [Anne 1623], daughter of Richard Warren [Mayflower 1620]\n\nChild buried at Leiden 1608\n\nJane, born about 1609; married at Plymouth about 1627 Experience Mitchell [Anne 1623]\n\nElizabeth, baptized 1611, no further record\n\nJacob, born about 1618 (deposed 1674, age about 56); married 1st at Plymouth 1646 Damaris, daughter of Stephen Hopkins [Mayflower 1620]; married 2nd at Plymouth 1669 Elizabeth (Lettice) Shurtleff, daughter of Thomas Lettice [Plymouth 1633] and widow of William Shurtleff [Plymouth 1634]\n\nHester, born say 1620; married at Plymouth, Richard Wright [Plymouth c.1635]\n\nMary, born at Plymouth about 1625; married 1645 John Thompson [Plymouth by 1643]\n\nCrackstone\n\nJohn Crackstone, father and son, immigrated from Leiden, Holland in 1620 on the Mayflower. John Sr. signed the Mayflower Compact in Provincetown Harbor. He died in early 1621 of the first sickness.\n\nJohn Crackstone Jr. received land in the 1623 division and was listed in the 1627 cattle division. John Jr. died in Plymouth shortly after the division. Bradford records the “som died, having lost himself in the woods; his feet became frozen, which put him into a fever of which he died”. The “Heirs of John Crackstone” were included in the list of Purchasers and Oldcomers who were to receive land but by 1652, the shares had passed to William Bradford and William Bassett.\n\nJohn Crackstone Sr. had the following children:\n\nAnna, born say 1600; married (banns) Leiden 22 December 1618 Thomas Smith\n\nJohn, born say 1602 or later; died in Plymouth 1627 or soon after\n\nDoty\n\nEdward Doty immigrated in 1620 on the Mayflower as a servant to Stephen Hopkins but was likely near the end of his servitude. He signed the Mayflower Compact. He was a member of the scouting party who went on a voyage of “discovery” on 6 December 1620.\n\nEdward Doty is said to be guilty of the “second offense” committed in Plymouth when he and fellow servant, Edward Leister, fought a duel with sword and dagger in which each received wounds. Over the next twenty years, Edward Doty was frequently in court for fighting, slandering, trespass, and debt. There is a long list of his court disputes, some of which he won but more it appears he lost\n\nIn the 1623 division of land, listed only as Edward, he was granted one acre. As “Edward Dolten”, he was in the 4th company in the 1627 division of cattle. He was a freeman by 1633 when he was assessed £1 7s in the tax list. He continued to acquire land, signing his deeds by his mark. The inventory of “Edward Dotten lately deceased”, taken November 1655, totaled £137 19s 6d of which £60 was real estate.\n\nBradford says that Edward married as his 2nd wife, 6 January 1635, Faith Clarke, daughter of Thurston Clarke [1634 Francis] but there is no record of a first marriage. Faith married 2nd in Plymouth, 14 March 1667 John Phillips.\n\nEdward died 23 August 1655 at Plymouth; Faith (Clarke) (Doty) Phillips was buried in Marshfield 21 December 1675.\n\nThe children of Edward Doty/Doten and Faith Clarke are as follows:\n\nEdward, born say 1636; married Plymouth 26 February 1662 Sarah, daughter of John Faunce [Anne 1623]\n\nJohn, born say 1636; married by 1668 Elizabeth Cooke, daughter of Jacob, granddaughter of Francis Cooke [Mayflower 1620]; married 2nd Sarah Rickard\n\nThomas, born say 1640; married 1st by 1675, Mary, daughter of John Churchill; married 2nd 1679 Mary____. There is a good argument that Thomas only married once, to Mary Churchill.\n\nSamuel, born say 1642; married Piscataway, NJ 13 November 1678, Jeane Harman of Piscataway\n\nDesire, born say 1645; died Marshfield 22 January 1731, aged 86y; married 1st Marshfield 25 December 1667, William, son of William Sherman [Plymouth 1632]; married 2nd Marshfield 24 November 1681, Israel, son of William Homes [Hercules 1635]; married 3rd, as his 2nd wife, Alexander Standish, son of Myles Standish [Mayflower 1620]\n\nElizabeth, born say 1646; married Marshfield 13 January 1675 John, son of John Rowse/Rouse [Marshfield 1634]\n\nIsaac, born Plymouth 8 February 1648; married by about 1673 Elizabeth England\n\nJoseph, born Plymouth 30 April 1651; accused of fathering her child by Elizabeth Warren, 27 October 1674; married about summer 1674 Deborah, daughter of John Ellis; married 2nd Rochester 5 March 1712 Sarah Edwards, widow\n\nMary, born say 1653; married after 10 July 1677 Samuel, son of Walter Hatch [Hercules 1635]\n\nEaton\n\nFrancis Eaton, his wife Sarah, and infant son Samuel immigrated in 1620 on the Mayflower. Francis received land in the 1623 division and was in the 10th company in the 1627 division of cattle with Christian, Samuel, and Rachel Eaton.\n\nSarah Eaton died early in 1621 of the first sickness. Francis married again about 1622, thought possibly to be the unknown maidservant (Dorothy?) of Katherine Carver; she died soon after.\n\nFrancis married third, about 1624, Christian Penn [Anne 1623]. Francis died in Plymouth between 25 March 1633, when he was on the tax list, and 8 November 1633, the date of his inventory. His widow, Christian (Penn) Eaton married, second in July1634, Francis Billington [Mayflower 1620], son of John Billington. [Mayflower 1620]\n\nFrancis and Sarah Eaton had the following child:\n\nSamuel, born late 1619 or early 1620; apprenticed 1636 to John Cook the younger for 7 years; married 1st by 1646, Elizabeth; she died and he married 2nd Martha Billington, his stepsister\n\nFrancis and Christian (Penn) Eaton had the following children:\n\nRachel, born Plymouth about 1625; married Plymouth 2 March 1646 Joseph Ramsden/Ramdell [Plymouth by 1641]\n\nBenjamin, born Plymouth about 1628; apprenticed Feb 1636 to Bridget Fuller for 14 years; married Plymouth 4 December 1660 Sarah Hoskins\n\nChild, born Plymouth say 1630; an idiot living in 1651[Bradford 447]\n\nFuller\n\nSamuel Fuller came on the Mayflower with his brother, Edward, Edward’s wife, and Edward’s son, Samuel Jr. The Fuller brothers were baptized at Redenhall, Norfolk, possibly sons of Robert Fuller. They had removed to Leiden, Holland, with the Separatist Pilgrims.\n\nBoth Edward Fuller and his wife died shortly after coming ashore in Plymouth, January 1621.\n\nChildren of Edward Fuller:\n\nMatthew, born say 1605; married about 1630 Frances ____.\n\nSamuel Fuller Jr. was born, say 1608, lived in the Plymouth household of his uncle Samuel Fuller, the physician, and received land and cattle in the Colony division. He married in Scituate, 1635, Jane Lothrop, daughter of Rev. John Lothrop [Griffin 1634].\n\nSamuel Sr. married three times, first to Alice Glascock (died 1613); 2nd in 1613, Leiden, Agnes, daughter of Alexander Carpenter (died by 1617); and 3rd in 1617, Leiden, Bridget Lee. In 1623, Bridget joined Samuel in Plymouth, a passenger on the Anne.\n\nSamuel Fuller, a surgeon, was an educated man. His inventory at his death showed about thirty books, many religious but also his “physic books”.\n\nUpon coming ashore in 1620, he was confronted with a ‘sickness’ that took many of the Mayflower colonists in the first winter. Disease continued to plague the Colonists and in 1633, an epidemic took their surgeon as well. A quote from Bradford concerning those lost: “in the end, after he had much helped others, Samuel Fuller who was their surgeon an physician and had been a great help and comfort unto them… a man godly and forward to do good, being much missed after his death”.\n\nChild of Samuel and Anna/Agnes (Carpenter) Fuller:\n\nchild, buried Leiden 29 Jun 1615\n\nThe children of Samuel and Bridget Fuller:\n\n(possibly) Bridget, born say 1619, Leiden; married 1641, Plymouth, Henry Sirkman\n\nMercy, born Plymouth after 1627, date uncertain; mentioned in her father’s will, no further record\n\nSamuel, born about 1629, Plymouth; married 1st an unnamed wife; 2nd about 1665 Elizabeth (Nichols) Bowen, daughter of John Nichols and widow of Thomas Bowen\n\nHopkins\n\nStephen Hopkins, his wife Elizabeth, and children Giles, Constance, Damaris, and Oceanus immigrated from London in 1620 on the Mayflower. The family came with two servants, Edward Doty and Edward Leister. Stephen signed the Mayflower Compact.\n\nStephen Hopkins was soon chosen Assistant and, with Edward Winslow, selected to approach Massasoit; Stephen repeated this duty frequently. In the late 1630s, he often ran up against the authorities, fined for battery of John Tisdale (1636); for drinking and playing “shovel board” on the Lord’s Day (1637); excess drinking in his house (1638); selling items overpriced; and dealing harshly with his pregnant servant.\n\nStephen married his first wife about 1607. She is sometimes identified as Constance Dudley, which has not been proved and discredited by some sources.\n\nStephen Hopkins and his first wife had the following children:\n\nConstance, born say 1607; married Plymouth by 1629, Nicholas Snow [Anne 1623]\n\nGiles, born say 1609; married Plymouth 9 October 1639 Catherine, daughter of Gabriel Whelden [Dedham c.1629]\n\nStephen married at St Mary Matfellon, Whitechapel, London, 19 February 1618 Elizabeth Fisher. Stephen died at Plymouth between 6 June (writing of will) and 17 July 1644 (proving of will). Elizabeth (Fisher) Hopkins died at Plymouth sometime in the early 1640s.\n\nStephen Hopkins and Elizabeth Fisher had the following children:\n\nDamaris, born say 1618; probably died at Plymouth before the birth of her sister of the same name.\n\nOceanus, born at sea on the Mayflower voyage, 1620; died by 1627\n\nDeborah, born Plymouth say 1626; married Plymouth 23 April 1646 as his first wife, Andrew, son of widow, Mary Ring [Plymouth c.1629]\n\nCaleb, born Plymouth say 1624; “became a seaman & died at Barbados” between 1644 and 1651\n\nDamaris, born Plymouth say 1628; married Plymouth just after 10 June 1646, Jacob, son of Francis Cooke [Mayflower 1620]\n\nRuth, born Plymouth say 1630; died after 30 November 1644 and before spring 1651 [Bradford 445]\n\nElizabeth, born Plymouth say 1632; believed to have died by 6 October 1659 when her property was appraised; unmarried\n\nHowland\n\nJohn Howland, age about 28, from Fenstanton, Huntingdonshire, immigrated on the Mayflower in 1620 as a manservant to Mr. John Carver. During a bad storm, John, whom Bradford describes as “a lusty young man”, was swept overboard but grabbed a topsail halyard. He was pulled up after nearly drowning “and though he was something ill with it, yet he lived many years after and became a profitable member both in church & commonwealth” [Bradford 59].\n\nJohn received 4 acres in the 1623 land division and cattle in the 1627 division as a passenger on the Mayflower. In 1633, he was among the councilors on the list of Plymouth freemen. He was the Plymouth Colony Assistant 1633-1635, Deputy for Plymouth to the General Court many years between 1641 and 1667. He was in charge of the fur trading post at Kennebec in 1634. Over the years he was granted additional land in Duxbury, Marshfield and “Middleberry”.\n\nJohn married about 1624 Elizabeth Tilley [1620 Mayflower], daughter of John Tilley [1620 Mayflower]. He was the brother of both Arthur and Henry Howland who came to Plymouth later.\n\nJohn Howland died at Plymouth in Feb 1673 “above eighty years”. Elizabeth (Tilley) Howland died at Swansea Dec 1687, aged eighty.\n\nJohn and Elizabeth Howland had the following children (who produced multitudes of descendants):\n\nDesire, born say 1624; married by 1644, John Gorham [Plymouth by 1638]\n\nJohn, born Plymouth 24 April 1627; married 26 October 1651 Mary Lee\n\nHope, born Plymouth 30 August 1629; married by about 1646 John Chipman [Plymouth 1630]\n\nElizabeth, born say 1631; married 1st Plymouth 13 September 1649 Ephraim, son of Robert Hicks [Fortune 1621]; married 2nd 10 July 1651 John Dickerson\n\nLydia, born say 1633; married by about 1655 James Brown\n\nHannah, born say 1637; married Swansea 6 July 1661 Jonathan, son of Jonathan Bosworth [Cambridge 1633]\n\nJoseph, born say 1640; married Plymouth 7 December 1664 Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Southworth [Plymouth 1628]\n\nJabez, b. about 1644 (deposed 1680 age 36y); married by 1669 Bethiah, daughter of Anthony Thatcher [James 1635]\n\nRuth, born say 1646; married Plymouth 17 November 1664 Thomas, son of Thomas Cushman [Fortune 1621]\n\nIsaac, born Plymouth 15 November 1649; married by 1677 Elizabeth, daughter of George Vaughn\n\nLeister\n\nEdward Leister Immigrated to Plymouth, 1620, on the Mayflower as a servant of Stephen Hopkins. He signed the Mayflower Compact. He received one acre of land in the 1623 land division.\n\nHe was involved in a duel with Edward Doty, another servant of Hopkins. They were both injured and punished by the colonists but survived,\n\nPer Bradford, “Lester, after he was at liberty, went to Virginia and there died” [Bradford 442, 445]. Edward Leister was not in the 1627 division of cattle so he must have departed for Virginia between 1623 and 1627. He does not appear in the February 1624 list of those in Virginia living or dead, nor in the Feb 1625 Virginia muster of inhabitants.\n\nMartin\n\nChristopher Martin, his wife Mary, and two servants, Solomon Prower and John Langmore.\n\nChristopher was chosen as the “treasurer agent” for the Mayflower and Speedwell and provided supplies in a very overbearing and brash manner [Bradford 44].\n\nThe whole Martin party, including servants, died in the first sickness.\n\nMore\n\nThe births of Ellinor, Jasper, Richard, and Mary More were registered in the parish of Shipton, Shropshire, England, the children of Samuel Moore and his wife, Catherine Moore, also his third cousin. Apparently, Catherine had maintained an adulterous affair and Samuel suspected he was not the father of the children. He placed the four children, in the care of John Carver to be cared for and transported to the New World. Richard More and his unnamed brother were bound to William Brewster; Jasper was bound to John Carver, and Ellen/Ellinor was bound to Edward Winslow\n\nIn Bradford’s 1651 accounting of the Mayflower passengers, he states that Jasper More died before the Spring of 1621 of the ‘common infection’; the unnamed brother [who was most likely the daughter Mary, Bradford after many years having misremembered the sibling of Richard as a boy] died the first winter; and Ellen died ‘soon after the ship’s arrival’. Richard was the only More to survive.\n\nRichard More returned to England after 1627, when he was named in William Brewster’s company in the Division of Cattle, and returned to New England in the Blessing in 1635. In 1637, he removed to Salem. Over the years he spent in Salem, he conducted many property transactions, both buying, and selling. He had some education since he signed his deeds.\n\nIn September 1674, Captain Richard Moore, master of the Friendship of Salem, was licensed to keep an ordinary to sell beer and cider but not wine and liquors. He died between March 1694 and April 1696, aged 84.\n\nRichard Mo(o)re married twice, first to Christian Hunter (who had come in the Blessing a year earlier) at Plymouth in 1636, and second, by 1678, to Jane, the widow of Samuel Crumpton.\n\nRichard and Christian had the following children, all baptized in Salem:\n\nSamuel, baptized 1642, living in 1651, no further record\n\nThomas, baptized 1642, living in 1651, no further record\n\nCaleb, baptized 1644, died unmarried in 1679\n\nJoshua, baptized 1646, living in 1651, no further record\n\nRichard, baptized 1648, married Sarah (Unknown) before 1673\n\nSusanna, baptized 1650, married first, about 1675 Samuel Dutch; married second, by 1696, Richard Hutton, as his second wife; and third, 1714 John Knowlton\n\nChristian, baptized 1652; married 1676 Joshua Conant as his first wife\n\nMullins\n\nWilliam Mullins, his wife Alice, their children Joseph and Priscilla, and a servant, Robert Carter immigrated to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620. The only survivor of the first winter’s sickness was the daughter, Priscilla, who married John Alden. Their son, William, immigrated and was in Duxbury by 1637.\n\nThe children of William and Alice Mullins, presuming she is the mother of all:\n\nWilliam, born say 1593; married first by 1618, _____; married 2nd Boston 7 May 1656 Ann, widow of Thomas Bell\n\nJoseph, born say 1596; died Plymouth 1621\n\nSarah, born say 1598; married by 1622 ___ Blunden. (“Sare Blunden alias Mullins” natural & legitimate daughter was named as administrator of her father’s will)\n\nPriscilla, born say 1603; married by about 1623 John Alden [Mayflower 1620]\n\nPriest\n\nDegory Priest, hatter, immigrated from Leiden to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620. He died on 1 January 1621 of the first sickness. Bradford states “Digory Priest … had his wife and children sent hither afterward, she being Mr. Allerton’s sister. [Bradford 443, 447]\n\nDegory Priest married Sarah, widow of Jan Vincent, in Leiden on 4 November 1611. She married in Leiden, 3 November 1621 Godbert Godbertson. Sarah, Godbert, and Degory’s two daughters, Mary and Sarah, came to Plymouth on the Anne in 1623. Godbertson received six acres in the 1623 division of land, four of them for the deceased Degory, his wife Sarah, and the two daughters.\n\nThe children of Degory and Sarah (Allerton) (Vincent) Priest are:\n\nMary, born say 1612 probably Leiden; married by about 1630 Phineas Pratt [Sparrow 1622].\n\nSarah, born say 1614 probably Leiden; married by about 1632 John Coombs [Plymouth 1633]\n\nRogers\n\nThomas Rogers and his son, Joseph Rogers, immigrated from Leiden to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620. “His other children came afterward” [Bradford 442, 446], presumably with the last of the Leiden group in 1629-30.\n\nJoseph Rogers was granted two acres in the 1623 division of land, one for himself and one for his deceased father. Joseph was in the 11th company in the 1627 division of cattle. In 1640, Joseph and his brother, John were granted 50 acres of upland each at the North River.\n\nThomas had married Alice, daughter of George Cosford, at Watford, Nottinghamshire, 24 October 1597.\n\nChildren of Thomas and Alice (Cosford) Rogers, baptized Watford, Nottinghamshire:\n\nThomas, baptized 24 March 1599; buried 27 May 1599\n\n(possibly) Richard, baptized 12 March 1600; buried 4 April 1600.\n\nJoseph, baptized 29 January 1603; married by 1633 Hannah ___ (assuming his only wife)\n\nJohn, baptized 6 April 1606; married Plymouth 16 April 1639 Anna Churchman\n\nElizabeth, baptized 26 December 1609; living in Leiden in 1622; perhaps came to NE and married\n\nMargaret, baptized 30 May 1613; living in Leiden in 1622; perhaps came to NE later and married\n\nSamson\n\nHenry Samson immigrated to Plymouth with the Edward Tilley family on the Mayflower in 1620. He was apparently a cousin of Ann Tilley. He received one acre in the 1623 land division and was in the 5th company in the 1627 cattle division.\n\nHenry served the Colony as a juryman, arbiter, surveyor, constable, and tax collector. In 1637, he was one of those willing to serve as a soldier with Mr. Thomas Prence. Over his lifetime, he was granted and/or purchased many additional acres in Plymouth, Duxbury and Dartmouth. His inventory taken in 1685 totaled £106 14s, including “land in Dartmouth” valued at £70.\n\nHenry married in Plymouth, 6 February 1636, Anne Plummer; he died between 24 December 1684 (date of will) and 5 March 1685 (probate of will). His wife died after 24 December 1668 and before 24 December 1684 (date of Henry’s will).\n\nThe children of Henry & Anne (Plummer) Samson, order based on his will, are as follows:\n\nStephen, born say 1638; married by 1686 Elizabeth ___\n\nJohn, born say 1640; died unmarried between 1702 and 1718\n\nElizabeth, born say 1642; married by 1662 Robert Sprout\n\nJames, born say 1644; married by 1679,\n\nHannah (—–), widow of Samuel Wait\n\nHannah, born say 1646; married Duxbury 20 March 1665 Josiah Holmes\n\nDaughter, born say 1648; married by 1682 (probably some years early) John Hanmore\n\nMary, born say 1650; married by 1684 (probably some years early) John Summers\n\nDorcas, born say 1652; married by 1684 (probably some years early) Thomas Bonney [Hercules 1635]\n\nCaleb, born say 1654; married 1st by about 1686 Mercy, daughter of Alexander Standish, and granddaughter of Miles Standish [Mayflower 1620]; married 2nd Duxbury 30 January 1729 Rebecca (Bartlett) (Bradford) Stanford, daughter of Benjamin Bartlett, widow of William Bradford, grandson of William Bradford [Mayflower 1620], and Robert Stanford\n\nSoule\n\nGeorge Soule, age about 18, immigrated to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1629 as a servant to Edward Winslow. He was an educated man, signing documents. He held several offices, such as deputy for Duxbury in 1642, he served on juries and several committees.\n\nGeorge received one acre of land in the 1623 division and George, Mary and Zachariah “Sowle” were in the 9th company. Over subsequent years, George was granted additional acreage including meadowlands, hayfields, and gardens. Before his death, he deeded much of his land to his children. His inventory showed he held £25 worth of real estate consisting of a dwelling house, barn, upland, and meadowland.\n\nGeorge married by 1627 Mary Bucket [Anne 1623]. George died between 20 September 1677 (codicil of will) and 22 January 1680 (inventory). Mary died about December 1672.\n\nThe children of George and Mary (Bucket) Soule are as follows:\n\nZachariah, born say by 1627; married by 1663 Margaret _____\n\nJohn, born about 1632 (deposed 1706 about 74y); married 1st by about 1656 Rebecca, daughter of Moses Simonson [Fortune 1621]; 2nd by 1679 Esther (____) Samson, widow of Samuel Samson\n\nNathaniel, born between say 1634 and 1646; before March 1674, fathered a child with a Native woman; married by 1681 Rose ____\n\nGeorge, born about 1639 (deposed March 1673 “aged 34 years or thereabouts”; married by 1671 Deborah ____.\n\nSusanna, born say 1640; married by 1660 Francis West, probably son of Matthew West [Lynn 1636]\n\nMary, born about 1642; bound out in 1653; married by 1667 John Peterson\n\nElizabeth, born say 1644; fined March 1663 for fornication; October 1663 sued Nathaniel Church for refusing to marry her; ordered whipped July 1667 for committing fornication a second time; married by 23 July 1668 Francis Walker\n\nPatience, born say 1646; married Middleborough January 1667 John Haskell\n\nBenjamin, born say 1652; died 26 March 1676 with Captain Pierce during King Philip’s War; unmarried\n\nStandish\n\nCaptain Miles Standish and his wife Rose immigrated to Plymouth from Holland on the Mayflower in 1620. He was the ‘soldier’ of the Colonists, serving also as councilor, assistant, Deputy to the Governor, and treasurer.\n\nBradford wrote in 1651 concerning the first great sickness: “so as there died sometimes two or three of a day … there were but six or seven sound persons, who, to their great commendations … spared no pains, night or day, but with an abundance of toil and hazard of their own health … did all the homely & necessary offices for them … of these seven … Myles Standish, their Captain & military commander, unto whom myself & many others, were such beholden in our low & sick condition” [Bradford 77].\n\nHe received two acres in the 1623 division of land and in the 1627 division of cattle, Captain, Barbara, Charles, Alexander, and John Standish were in the 5th company. He was granted land in Duxbury. He held the purchaser’s rights to land at Sowamsett, Mattapoisett, and “places adjacent”, which he sold to Capt. Thomas Willett of Plymouth in May 1654.\n\nIn March 1621, Captain Standish and Master Williamson met Massasoit at the brook and began negotiations. He was involved with all of the Colony’s early interactions with the Natives.\n\nMiles married 1st by say 1618 Rose ___. She died at Plymouth 29 January 1621. He married 2nd by 1624 Barbara ____ [Anne 1623]. She died after 6 October 1659.

He was also part of the December 1620 group of discoverers who traveled along the bitterly cold shore of the Cape for seven days. He soon became ill from the exposure.\n\nBoth Edward and Ann had no known children; they died soon after their arrival. Humility Cooper was sent back to England and died there. Edward was the brother of fellow Mayflower passenger, John Tilley.\n\nJohn\n\nJohn, his wife Joan (Hurst) (Rogers), and daughter Elizabeth Tilley immigrated from Leiden Holland to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620.

He and his wife died in Plymouth in 1620 of the first general sickness.\n\nJohn and Joan (Hurst) (Rogers) Tilley had the following children, baptized Henlow:\n\nRose, baptized 23 October 1597; no further record\n\nJohn, baptized 26 August 1599; no further record\n\nRose, baptized 28 February 1601/2; no further record\n\nRobert, baptized 25 November 1604; no further record\n\nElizabeth, baptized 30 August 1607; married about 1625 John Howland [Mayflower 1620]\n\nTurner\n\nJohn Turner and two of his (unnamed) sons immigrated from Leiden to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620. All three of them died in the first sickness.\n\nBradford, in 1651, states that John had “a daughter come some years after to Salem where she is living … well married and approved of”. [Bradford 446] A Lysbet Turner appeared in the 1622 Poll tax for Leiden. There is convincing arguments that she is the Elizabeth Turner who witnessed a deed in Salem on 8 October 1635 and joined the church there in December 1637. Her birth date is estimated at about 1619.\n\nWarren\n\nRichard Warren immigrated from London to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620. His wife and children followed him in the Anne in 1623. Richard was a member of the December 1620 group that explored the outer Cape.\n\nIn the 1623 land division, Richard’s family received an estimated seven acres; in the 1627 division of cattle, they were the first nine persons in the 9th company.\n\nRichard Warren married Elizabeth Walker (the daughter of Augustine Walker) in 1609. She became a purchaser in her husband’s name after his death. Richard died in Plymouth in 1628; Elizabeth died at Plymouth on 2 October 1673, aged about 90, probably an exaggeration.\n\nThe children of Richard and Elizabeth Warren are as follows:\n\nMary, born say 1609; married say 1629 Robert Bartlett [Anne 1623]\n\nAnn, born say 1614; married Plymouth 19 April 1633 Thomas Little [Plymouth 1632]\n\nSarah, born say 1614; married Plymouth 28 March 1634 John, son of Francis Cooke [Mayflower 1620]\n\nElizabeth, born say 1615; married by 1636 Richard Church [Mass Bay 1630]\n\nAbigail, born say 1619; married Plymouth 8/9 November 1639 Anthony Snow [Plymouth 1639]\n\nNathaniel, born Plymouth say 1624; married Plymouth 19 November 1645 Sarah Walker\n\nJoseph, born Plymouth by 1627; married about 1653 Priscilla, daughter of John Faunce [Anne 1623]\n\nWhite\n\nWilliam White, his wife Susanna, and son Resolved immigrated from Leiden to Plymouth in the Mayflower in 1620. In the 1623 division of land, he received 5 acres posthumously. His two sons were on the list for the 1627 division of cattle.\n\nWilliam White married about 1615, Susanna ____.

Edward signed the Mayflower Compact in Provincetown Harbor. He was a merchant.\n\nEdward Winslow received four acres in the 1623 division of land and was listed in the 1627 division of cattle with Susannah, Edward, and John Winslow. He was elected Governor of the Plymouth Colony Jan 1633, Jan 1636, and Jun 1644. He was the Assistant for several other years.\n\nEdward made many trips back to England on both personal and colony business. He authored three important pamphlets about New England, 1624, 1646, and 1647. He was the brother of Gilbert, John, Josiah, and Kenelm Winslow, among the most prolific record creators in that period.\n\nEdward married at Leiden, Holland, 12 May 1618 Elizabeth Barker who died at Plymouth in March 1621. He married 2nd at Plymouth, 12 May 1621, Susannah (—-) White [1620 Mayflower], widow of William White [1620 Mayflower]. Susannah died between 1654 and 1675.\n\n“Edward Winslowe of London, Esquire, being now bound in a voyage to sea in the service of the commonwealth”(Cromwell’s, not Plymouth’s) made his will 18 December 1654 and died at sea near Hispaniola on 8 May 1655, aged 59y 6m 18d.\n\nEdward and Susannah Winslow had the following children:\n\nChild, born and died 1622-23.\n\nEdward, born say 1624; living 1627; no further record\n\nJohn, born say 1626; living in 1627; no further record\n\nJosiah, born after 22 May 1627; married by 1658 Penelope, daughter of Herbert Pelham\n\nElizabeth, born say 1631; married 1st by 1656 Robert Brooks; 2nd Salem 22 September 1669 George Curwin/Corwin\n\nGilbert\n\nGilbert Winslow immigrated from Leiden to Plymouth in 1620 on the Mayflower with his brother, Edward and Edwards Wife, Elizabeth (Barker). He received one acre of land in the 1623 division but had returned to England by the 1627 division of cattle.\n\nBradford wrote in 1651 that “after diver years here, [he] returned into England and died there” [Bradford 443, 447]. He had no recorded wife or children. In 1663, the Plymouth Court acknowledged “Gilbert Winslow, deceased, who was one of the first comers, to have a right of land” and allowed his heirs to “propose a parcel of land that the Court may think meet to accommodate them in”.\n\n[1] Anderson, Robert Charles; The Great Migration Begins: Immigrants to New England 1620-1633, Volumes I-III, 3 vols., Boston MA; New England Historic Genealogical Society; 1995).\n\nBecome a Member\n\nDonate Today\n\nLocation & Hours\n\nLocation\n\nAtwood Museum\n\n347 Stage Harbor Road\n\nChatham, MA 02633\n\n508-945-2493"
