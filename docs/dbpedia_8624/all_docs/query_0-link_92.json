        "text": "QUARTER SESSIONS. - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1842.\n\nBefore Joseph Hone Esq., Chairman, and Messrs. Brock, Hewitt, and Hunt, J. P's. , (ADJOURNED DAY).\n\nWilliam Burgess was indicted for robbing his employer, Mr. Watchorn, of certain monies, to wit, £1, the'1st February : he was defended by Mr. Macdowell.\n\nA. R. Harnett, assistant to Mr. Watchorn, having entered the witness box, Mr. Macdowell rose lo make an objection to the information, which he submitted would be fatal. The prisoner was charged with stealing certain monies; but a bank note was not money. The learned Counsel observed, that that was not the usual time to take an objection, but he did so with the concurrence of the Solicitor General, and if he could show that the information could not be sustained, there would be no use to occupy the time and attention of the court, or the jury, or the public. Mr Macdowell cited an authority from Chetwynd's edition of Burn's Justice, to show that the note ought to have been more specifically described.\n\nThe Solicitor General briefly replied, and although he admitted that it would have been better had the note been more specifically described, yet he apprehended that the description was sufficient, and quoted a case in support of his opinion. The Court, having over-ruled the objection, urged by Mr. Macdowell, the examination of the witness was proceeded with.\n\nOn the first of the present month the prisoner was warehouseman in Mr. Watchorn's establishment, he occasionally served in the shop. Witness remembered a person (Mrs. Johnson) coming to Mr. Watchorn's shop, on the evening of the day mentioned, he saw Burgess serve her ; after he had served her, witness saw him go to the cashier, and hand him some money ; on his return, witness saw Burgess place something between some boxes on a shelf in the warehouse ; he did not see what it was ; Burgess afterwards returned to Mrs. Johnson; witness then called to another shopman, Mr. Sullivan, who went to the boxes, and witness saw him take a £1 note from the place, which Sullivan placed between some gloves in the shop, this was between the hours of 3 and 4 in the afternoon ; witness did not see Sullivan take the note from between the gloves ; he did not examine or mark it ; he could see it was a £1 note, and Sullivan shewed it.\n\nArthur Sullivan corroborated Mr. Harnett's testimony ; and another shopman, Henry Chapman, stated that he found a £1 note between some gloves, in the shop ; he should know the note again ; it was one of the Commercial Bank ; witness did not mark it, but he believed the number was 11854.\n\nCross-examined. - There was no other circumstance to enable witness to identify the note, except the number, and its being one of the Commercial Bank. He would not swear to the number.\n\nRe-examine. - Took down the number on a piece of paper, could not say where the paper then was ; it might be at home ; witness informed Mr. Watchorn of this circumstance, and was present at a conversation between Mr. Watchorn and the prisoner.\n\nMr. Macdowell submitted that the note could not be produced as evidence, the paper upon which the number had been noted down, not having been lost: the jury would doubtless rather have the paper than the memory of the witness to guide them ; and there were no grounds for producing that which was secondary and unsatisfactory evidence, when positive testimony might be found. By Mr. Hone. - Witness gave the same note to Mr. Watchorn.\n\nMrs. George Johnson deposed that on the day referred to, she purchased some articles at Mr. Watchorn's, which came to £1 16s. 2d., and for which she paid Burgess by a £1 note and 4 dollars: witness received a bill, receipted from Burgess, for the amount ; witness did not pay him any other money that day.\n\nMr. Nichol, cashier to the Commercial Bank, proved the genuineness of the note, and supposed it was not paid, but in circulation.\n\nHenry Marsh, apparently quite a little boy, but between fourteen and fifteen years of age, deposed, that he was cashier to Mr. Watchorn ; it was the custom of the shopmen to bring the money to witness as they received it, when he took an account of it in his cash-book ; on the 1st of February witness received from Burgess the following sums - £1 17s. 6d., 15s., 16s. 2d., and 9s. 6d.; the first he received about eleven o'clock, and the 16s. 2d. between three and four in the afternoon ; he gave Burgess 1s. 2d. in change.\n\nCross-examined. - Witness was enabled to recollect the time of the first payment from the prisoner serving in the shop that morning; the 9s. 6d. were paid about a quarter of an hour after the 16s. 2d. ; witness sometimes made mistakes in his accounts; finding, at the close of the day, that he had more money than he had put down ; upon an average once or twice a week.\n\nBy the Solicitor-General. - Could not recollect whether he had received more money than he had accounted for in the week in which the 1st February occurred.\n\nMr. Watchorn deposed, that the prisoner, as his hired servant, was authorised to sell in his shop ; on the 1st February witness received a one pound note from Henry Chapman, which he marked with his initials \" W.W.\" in one corner (Mr. Watchorn identified the note) ; witness asked the prisoner what money he had taken from the last customer ? he replied, £1 16s. 2d.; witness asked him, what he had done with it ? he said, \" I have paid it up to Marsh ;\" witness said, \" no, you have not-you have paid but 16s. 2d., and here is the note in my hand ;\" Chapman was present.\n\nMr, Macdowell rose to object to the reception as evidence, of any communication made by the prisoner under the influence of implied threat. The learned counsel contended that the manner of Mr. Watchorn must have operated, upon the prisoner as a threat ; it was not necessary to use the exact words of a threat, for the learned counsel know of no particular cabalistical form of words in which a threat might be conveyed; if he could show that the witness's manner was calculated to impress the mind of the prisoner as a threat, the Court was bound to exclude any evidence that might have ensued. Had a threat been directly or positively conveyed, there would be then no doubt in the matter ; and if the language or manner of Mr. Watchorn to the prisoner had the effect of a threat, the Court was bound, cautiously, he would admit, but determinedly, to exclude as evidence the communication which followed.\n\nMr. Macdowell here repeated Mr. Watehorn's words, and asked, if any man would tell him, that they did not operate upon the fears and apprehensions of the prisoner ?\n\nThe Solicitor-General fully admitted the rectitude and justness of the position advanced by his learned friend as regarded the law of evidence ; but he contended that no threat was intended to be conveyed by Mr. Watchorn.\n\nThe Chairman was not aware of anything in the books by which they could be guided in the present instance: in the absence of any such guide, His Honor would have taken some time to consider his opinion to place the prisoner in a position to account for the discrepancy in his account.\n\nExamination continued. - The prisoner said, \"I deserve all that you can give me-don't proceed against me, it is the first time I have done it;\" witness said he thought there had been a great deal of ¡t, and, sending for a constable, gave the prisoner into custody.\n\nThis being the case for the prosecution, Mr. Macdowell proceeded to address the Jury, which he did with considerable animation. It would be unsafe, indeed, upon the evidence which had been produced, Jo pronounce a verdict of guilty against the prisoner ; it was a well-known principle of our law, a principle founded upon good sense, as well as upon humanity - that it was better for twenty guilty men to escape, than for one innocent person to be convicted ; and he need not remind the jury that if any fair and reasonable doubt existed in their minds of the guilt of the prisoner, it was their duty to acquit him. He would ask them, and ho did so with the greatest confidence, what was there in the case to induce them to hesitate in acquitting the prisoner without the testimony of the last witness? (Mr. Watchorn). The learned counsel then referred to the evidence of the shopmen generally, and of Mr. Harnett's in particular, neither of whom could identify the note; there was nothing to show that that note had ever been in the possession of the prisoner, hut of this the jury must be satisfied, beyond all question, before they could find the prisoner guilty. The question after all was a mixed question of law and of fact, yet if the jury were of opinion that Mr. Watchorn used any threat towards the prisoner, they would exclude that part of his testimony altogether. Mr. Macdowell here referred to a case where a boy was apprehended on a charge of murder. Some man who saw him a short time after his apprehension, asked him if he had committed the deed, but the boy denied it. The man made use of some prayer by which the boy was induced to confess, and although the confession was admitted as evidence, yet the point was reserved for the opinion of the twelve judges, who confirmed the admissibility, but accompanied their decision by a strong reprobation of the means that had been used. He did not mean to impute any improper conduct to Mr. Watchorn, but every one who had heard him give his evidence, must think that there was something in his manner which might have influenced the apprehensions of the prisoner : if the note had not been found, there would have been an excuse, in a legal point, for Mr. Watchorn'a mode of address, but the note being present)the case was altered. After animadverting upon the errors to which the witness, Marsh, acknowledged he bad been liable, and again adverting to the conduct of Mr. Harnett, the learned Counsel left the Case in the hands of the jury ; but before he did so, he would call some witnesses as to character ; and although their evidence could no alter facts, yet where any doubt existed, or where the testimony was balanced, a good character ought to have its weight : besides it was quite inconsistent that a young man like the prisoner, who had enjoyed a good character since he had been in the colony, and who had no occasion for money, should risk the forfeiture of that character by such a transaction as that which was imputed to him. Mr. Macdowell then called Messrs. Hutchinson, Wilson (the tobacconist), and Frederick Lipscombe, who respectively testified to the good character of the prisoner since his arrival in the colony up to the present time.\n\nThe Chairman summed up with considerable care and minuteness, and the jury after being absent about half an hour, returned a verdict of Guilty, but recommended the prisoner to the consideration of the Court, in consequence of his previous character."
