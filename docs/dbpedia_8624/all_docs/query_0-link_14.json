        "text": "Producer-director-agent-actor Hartney J. Arthur died in Bethel, Conn., of respiratory failure on March 24. He was 86.\n\nArthur was born in Hobart, Tasmania, and began appearing in silent films at age 10. A vaudevillian at 14, he made his legit debut in the mid-1930s, appearing with Judith Anderson in “The Green Hat” and touring New Zealand in the title role of “Charley’s Aunt.”\n\nDuring the next decade he was variously under contract to Warner Bros. and the J. Arthur Rank Studios.\n\nHe moved to the U.S. permanently in 1949 and made his television debut with E.G. Marshall on “Kraft Playhouse.”\n\nArthur worked on Broadway as the director and producer of the production “The Legend of Lizzie Borden,” and he co-produced the West End production of “Auntie Mame” starring Beatrice Lillie.\n\nHe also produced many shows in Australia including the premieres there of “The Sound of Music,” “The Caine Mutiny” and “The Diary of Anne Frank.”\n\nHe was with the theatrical agency Briscoe/Goldsmith handling such established stage performers as Ruth Chatterton, Sylvia Sidney, Eva LeGallienne and Mildred Natwick as well as newcomers Sandy Dennis and William Daniels.\n\nIn 1965 he became the director of the Ford Foundation’s new organization servicing the burgeoning regional theater movement, Theater Communications Group. After six years as its head, he left to teach film history at Fairfield U. in Connecticut."
