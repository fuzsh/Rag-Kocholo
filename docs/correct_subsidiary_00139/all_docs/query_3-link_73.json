Our challenge: to increase new readers, and for this we need your help.\n\nWe’ve decide to offer a Bring Your Friends membership promotion, which offers the SNS newsletter for one quarter for $195. If you have friends who’ve been reading over your shoulder, please tell them about this offer. You know best who we should add to this community, and we’re creating this offer to help you bring them in.

It might have been Steve Jobs’ return to Apple, a sadder but wiser prodigal CEO. It could even have been back in 1995, when IBM did the first unfriendly takeover of a software company, as Jim Manzi went for the dough and sold Lotus to Big Blue.\n\nCertainly, by the time Larry Ellison announced that Oracle’s future lay in mergers, the time had already come. Larry proved himself right, and doubters wrong, by his ability to swallow most of his competitors and grow Oracle’s share price.\n\nHow old is Oracle? This is one you’ll win bets on at the next cocktail party. The company was incorporated in 1977, as Software Development Laboratories, making Oracle 30 years old this year. Larry had been inspired by the Codd and Date bible on (relational) database structures, and made his first sale of Oracle 2 (the first version; even then the company had problems with telling customers the truth). Today it is the second-largest software company, behind Microsoft.\n\nIf none of the little rabbit ears in then-still-young tech land had gone up before, they definitely went up after the Big Bad Wolf ate PeopleSoft, and Siebel Systems, and Sleepycat, and – well, for those who haven’t been paying close attention, here is the current list, from the Software Mergers and Acquisitions Hall of Fame:\n\nOracle acquisitions\n\nCompany\n\nDate\n\nIndustry\n\nValuation\n\nmillions USD\n\nThinking Machines Corporation\n\nJune 1999\n\nDarwin, Datamining technology\n\nN/A\n\nToplink\n\nJanuary 2002\n\nObject relation mapping technology\n\nN/A\n\nNetForce\n\nJanuary 2002\n\nAdverse Event Reporting System\n\nN/A\n\nSteltor\n\nJune 2002\n\nEnterprise calendaring system\n\nN/A\n\nPhaos\n\nMay 2004\n\nIdentity Management\n\nN/A\n\nCollaxa\n\nJune 2004\n\nBusiness Process Management\n\nN/A\n\nPeopleSoft\n\nJanuary 2005\n\nEnterprise Software\n\n$10,300\n\nOblix\n\nMarch 2005\n\nIdentity Management\n\nN/A\n\nRetek\n\nApril 2005\n\nRetail Industry Solutions\n\n$630\n\nTripleHop\n\nJune 2005\n\nContext-sensitive Enterprise Search\n\nN/A\n\nTimesTen\n\nJune 2005\n\nReal-time Enterprise Solutions\n\nN/A\n\nProfitLogic\n\nJuly 2005\n\nRetail Industry Solutions\n\nN/A\n\nContext Media\n\nJuly 2005\n\nEnterprise Content Integration\n\nN/A\n\ni-flex (Oracle Financial Services)\n\nAugust 2005\n\nBanking Industry Solutions\n\n$900\n\nG-Log\n\nSeptember 2005\n\nTransportation Management Solutions\n\nN/A\n\nInnobase\n\nOctober 2005\n\nDiscrete Transactional Open Source Database Technology\n\nN/A\n\nThor Technologies\n\nNovember 2005\n\nEnterprise-wide User Provisioning Solutions.\n\nN/A\n\nOctetString\n\nNovember 2005\n\nVirtual Directory Solutions\n\nN/A\n\nTemposoft\n\nDecember 2005\n\nWorkforce Management Applications\n\nN/A\n\n360Commerce\n\nJanuary 2006\n\nRetail Industry Solutions\n\nN/A\n\nSiebel Systems\n\nJanuary 2006\n\nCustomer Relationship Management Solutions\n\n$5,850\n\nSleepycat\n\nFebruary 2006\n\nOpen Source Database Software for Embedded Applications\n\nN/A\n\nHotSip\n\nFebruary 2006\n\nCommunications Infrastructure Solutions\n\nN/A\n\nPortal Software\n\nApril 2006\n\nCommunications Industry Software Suite\n\n$220\n\nNet4Call\n\nApril 2006\n\nCommunications Industry Service Delivery Platform\n\nN/A\n\nDemantra\n\nJune 2006\n\nDemand-driven Planning Solutions\n\nN/A\n\nTelephony@Work\n\nJune 2006\n\nIP-based Contact Center Technology\n\nN/A\n\nSigma Dynamics\n\nAugust 2006\n\nReal-time Predictive Analytics Software\n\nN/A\n\nSunopsis\n\nOctober 2006\n\nEnterprise Integration Software\n\nN/A\n\nMetaSolv Software\n\nOctober 2006\n\nCommunications Service Providers Solutions\n\n$219\n\nStellent\n\nNovember 2006\n\nContent Management Solutions\n\n$440\n\nSPL WorldGroup\n\nNovember 2006\n\nRevenue and Operations Management Software\n\nN/A\n\nHyperion Solutions\n\n1 March 2007\n\nEnterprise Performance Management\n\n$3,300\n\nAppForge\n\n(intellectual assets only)\n\nApril 2007\n\nCross-platform handheld development\n\nN/A\n\nAgile Software Corporation\n\nMay 2007\n\nProduct Life Cycle Management Software\n\n$495\n\nBharosa\n\nJuly 2007\n\nIdentify Theft\n\n$495\n\nBridgestream\n\nSeptember 2007\n\nEnterprise Role Management\n\nN/A\n\nLogicalApps\n\nOctober 2007\n\nCompliance software\n\nN/A\n\nNetSure Telecom Ltd.\n\nNovember 2007\n\nNetwork intelligence and optimization software\n\nUndisclosed\n\nMoniforce\n\n6 December 2007\n\nEnd-user experience management software\n\nN/A\n\nBEA Systems\n\n16 January 2008\n\nMiddleware software Company\n\n$8,500\n\nCaptovation\n\n16 January 2008\n\nDocument capture software\n\nN/A\n\nEmpirix (Web)\n\n27 March 2008\n\nWeb application testing software\n\nN/A\n\nBy any measure, when Oracle finished its long and bloody PeopleSoft chase, the gun had gone off in the next M and A–driven phase in the world of software. But even then Oracle was a standout, and Larry remained (as he does today, almost by a palpable and public personal desire) the Bad Boy of the industry.\n\nBill Gates’ most common refrain to Wall Street analysts, from the first day Microsoft went public, was that the company would eventually face “the law of big numbers,” referring to the difficulty of continuing to post consistently large percentage growth figures as size increased.\n\nThis single mathematical issue is what drives nearly all the M and A activity on Wall Street, regardless of rationale. And this kind of activity is what uniquely typifies Software Hitting Middle Age: companies having hit a size that prevents continued, historically consistent growth rates.\n\nAs Microsoft now launches out onto a full-time, radar-up M and A program, it’s safe to say: We’re There.\n\nYou say three-quarters of all mergers fail? Who cares? After all, if we asked about the financial fate of the CEOs who did those mergers, we’d find that virtually all of the acquired CEOs took a huge golden parachute and went off to buy their own island, while the acquiring CEO used the transaction to hide any current screw-ups and misdemeanors (or felonies) he/she had been propagating on the shareholders.\n\nIt’s a real win/win, when you see it through the eyes of the people at the levers.\n\nAnd the bankers? They always make money, even when the companies, officers, employees, and shareholders get screwed. After all, theirs comes off the top. That’s why the bankers, like hyenas, are constantly prodding companies to take the next step, either toward IPOs or purchases and sales. Since this activity is rarely good for the company and its stakeholders, this Middle Age thing can be tough on those who don’t live in Connecticut (home of all hedge-fund managers and investment bankers).\n\nI had a couple of calls from journalists this week that weave nicely into this story. The first came from Todd Bishop, at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, wanting to talk about tech employees’ apparent donation preference for Obama. (You can see his story at <http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/358889_software14.html>.)\n\nHe recalled a conversation we had during the Microsoft purchase of aQuantive, reminding me I had predicted then that MS would continue with large acquisitions now that they had started, and here we were with the Yahoo! bid (and with the Tellme purchase done). I guess most people hadn’t expected the buying trend to continue, but really, the company has little choice.\n\nNot that the transactions themselves always make sense, but I’d suggest that, in general, they do. Unlike GE, which is having a bit of trouble making conglomerates look good this week (or year, or three years; Hello, Jeff?), most tech match-ups have a real technology road map driving the purchase, and often a complementary customer set that will fit well into technology dependencies. (By this, I mean if you buy and link their favorite products to yours, their hearts and minds will follow, in Nixonian fashion.)\n\nIt isn’t hard to understand the Microsoft/Yahoo! bid: MS wants a larger share of the online ad revenue pie, which is already huge and which will be five times larger in ten years, as paper media crumble or move onto the Net.\n\nIt’s easy money; go get it.\n\nThe other journalist call came this morning from my friend Steve Lohr at the New York Times, who seemed to have discovered a $100MM “flight insurance” premium MS may have paid to keep employees happy during the $800MM purchase of Tellme Networks. He wanted to know whether a 12% premium was too much to pay in off-budget closing costs, and whether this was keeping MS from raising its current price.\n\nI suggested that MS probably did have to pay a higher premium for its Valley purchases than, say, Google, because of a perception that people would rather work for the latter. I also said this was the result not of how the current MS operates, but probably one more cost item from what I used to call “Bill’s Billion Dollar Mistake,” which by now should be called “Bill’s $50B Mistake.” That mistake was to kill competitors rather than beat them; to be ruthless, rather than tough.\n\nIf there is a premium gap in off-budget closing costs, we could call it the Microsoft Premium. If Google might have to pay, say, 8% in flight insurance, and MS has to pay 12% to close the deal, that gives us an additional 4% Microsoft Premium. It could be higher, because I suspect that Google might find its own number to be zero; that targets are actually happy to be bought. In that case, the MS Premium would be 12%.\n\nAdd that to the Yahoo! bid, and you’re talking serious money.\n\nBut I don’t quite track with Steve’s question: it may be that this cost is assumed, even off-budget. I think MS’ reluctance to raise its bid comes from a presumption that, once official price negotiations begin, it will then have to do so, and doing so early will just double the delta spent. They’re probably right.\n\nI told Steve Lohr that the MS/Yahoo! fight would end up with MS prevailing, but that it would be as protracted as the Oracle/PeopleSoft battle.\n\nBut there is a much larger problem that MS, and the rest of the Middle Agers, face, even when transactions make sense, are tough to do, and finally get done.\n\nOnce you start on this path, you just can’t stop. And that’s one of the big problems with the tech industry at middle age.\n\nFor any given deal, assuming you beat all the odds and it’s well-chosen and well-implemented, there will be an initial bump for the acquirer, as revenues are added, headcount is cut, and cross-sales opportunities are pursued. Let’s say that takes a year or two.\n\nThen the bump’s over, but you’ve really increased your size this time. Uh-oh.\n\nNow you have to do it again, to keep those large numbers up, but you’re much larger, so either the company you buy next has to be even larger, or you have to do it more often, which starts the next turn of the Great Mandela, and the next big bump in earnings, and fall-off, and then ---\n\nWelcome to Wall St. capitalism, smoothed quarterly earnings, deceptive management practices, endless M and A exercises, and no way to get off the treadmill except going private. All thanks to the law of large numbers.\n\nWelcome to Middle Age.\n\nYour comments are always welcome.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark R. Anderson\n\nCEO\n\nStrategic News Service LLC Tel. 360-378-3431\n\nP.O.

Next Question?\n\nLet’s see, which bet should you make: that people will suddenly find their thirst for bandwidth sated, just when the Old Phonies run out of capacity on their ancient plants, OR that bandwidth appetite will continue to grow, fueled by bundling voice with entertainment, Internet access, fax, increased graphic content on the Web, the move to High Definition Video, gaming popularity, and the switch to IPTV?\n\nIt’s obviously a tough choice.\n\nOr at least it is if you’re running AT&T (“T”), long my least-favorite telephone company, not long ago underlining that positioning by RAISING prices on bandwidth, as it drops everywhere else in the world, and from every other vendor.\n\nOn comes Verizon, continuing to benefit from its growing investment in glass (now approaching $23B for its FiOS net), with rumors that it will raise the poker ante from 50 Mbps at $90/month in NYC (and $140 in other states) to 100 Mbps.\n\nFor SNSers who like our updated “Rabbit Ratio” ($ per Mbits per second) as a global measure, that puts Verizon/NYC at 1.8. In other states, it’s 2.8.\n\nAT&T charges $150 for 50Mbps, giving it a nice round 3.0. (Low is good in this game.)\n\nComcast, late to the fiber game, still gets points for playing, and has cobbled together a multi-pipe multiplexing arrangement that, although kludgy, seems able to push it back into competition with Verizon at 50.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the twisted pair and coax ranch, T and TimeWarner are going to be even less happy when Verizon’s new field equipment, rated at 400 Mbps, hits the streets. (See “Quotes.”)\n\nTW spokesperson Alex Dudley claims that “current speeds are more than adequate,” and T’s faceman Michael Coe says consumers may not be able to benefit from fat pipes because the Net might be clogged somewhere else.\n\nNo, I’m not kidding.\n\nT says offering lower speeds at lower prices is the future, 1.5 M for $20 (a record Rabbit Ratio of 13.3).\n\nSo: which will it be? Verizon.\n\n» Trade Down, China Up\n\nThe globe is spinning to a stop, if you are counting world trade.\n\nAccording to the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, a Dutch research institute, global trade growth for the last three months of 2007 increased at an annualized rate of 0.2% vs. the prior quarter. The prior quarter’s measure had been 6.9%.\n\nThis indicator is thought to cover 97% of trade in goods, comprising more than 80% of total world trade. The EPA noted that imports into both the U.S. and Europe fell in the last three months of the year. YTY trade growth maxed out at 9.7% in November of 2006. If trade actually slows, it will be the first time since the 2001 U.S. dotcom debacle.\n\nIt is suggested that global trade growth runs at about 2x GDP growth, so you can back those figures out if you like.\n\nWell, you might say, does that include Net Commerce?\n\nIf you think doing so would automatically favor the U.S. or Europe, you may wrong, according to a new release from firm BDA, using data from the China Internet Network Information Center suggesting that, at least in users, China has now taken the lead internationally.\n\nBased on a declining edge at the end of 2007 (216MM U.S. vs. 210MM China), BDA calculates that, as of two weeks ago, “China has comfortably passed the U.S. as the world’s largest Internet population,” according to analyst Bin Liu.\n\nBDA suggests that Net Commerce will indeed be the next boom segment of the Chinese economy, as a result of this online market growth.\n\nExperience in Japan might lead one to be slightly more conservative in linking spending to lurking, I’d suggest, but it would not surprise me to see spending per capita in Chinese cities run higher than in Japan.\n\nFor that reason, and because users are not dollars (or Yuan), I’ll suggest that China remains a year or more behind the U.S. in total dollars spent in Net Commerce, but there is no reason to think the Chinese won’t also catch up in this more important regard relatively soon.\n\n» BP To Get Putinized\n\nWe might as well make it a verb: what happens to oil companies with deals in Russia.\n\nWithout wasting time or going into the past, Dictator Putin has nationalized every oil field and operation within reach (old news) except for TNK-BP, which BP shareholders were quietly hoping might somehow survive, as they whistled past the graveyard of the Kremlin.\n\nAnd now – drum roll – first for the fake charges:\n\nPolice raided BP Moscow HQ a couple of weeks ago, looking for evidence of “industrial espionage” (or, no doubt, underused toilet paper).\n\nThen the FSB (i.e., the democratically elected federal government, a.k.a. the Kleptocracy) arrested two British-educated brothers (Ilya and Alexander Zaslavsky) with BP links. Both are Oxford-educated; the latter runs the British Alumni Club, under the British Council.\n\nThen comes the environmental guy, Oleg Mitvol, the same stooge who used the same permit tricks to re-jigger ownership against Shell in Sakhalin-2.\n\nBP, with 50% ownership of the JV, is going down. The only question is how far.\n\nInstead of being completely driven out of the deal, the Russians will hope they’ll stay in as minority partner, shut up and do as they’re told, take a fraction of the profit, and continue to bring the necessary technology and expertise to the table.\n\nI was telling a friend this week that I still have colleagues in investment banking who think Russia is a great place to invest – if you stay away from oil.\n\nIt reminds me of the story about the Nazis, and the pastor who said he didn’t complain when they went after the Jews, and then the Catholics, etc. Our banking friends are fooling themselves if they think the new and democratically elected President Medvedev will be any different, or will cease to go after any sector with money in it.\n\nFirst oil, then all mineral resources; let’s see, next, well, it might just be ---\n\nYou!\n\n» U.S. Ad Spending Flat\n\nAs Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, AOL, and News Corp can all attest, ad spending is what it is all about. Normally, this is a moving target, but not in 2007, according to figures just released by TNS Media Intelligence.\n\nFor the year, ad spend was up only 0.2% to $149B; in the fourth quarter, they were down year to year by 0.1%.\n\nWho is losing the most, the fastest? You guessed it: newspapers, down 5.6% to $26B for the year. Ad dollar revenues also fell in television and radio. (Internet ad revenues were up, somewhere in the 25% range, a category not covered in the TNS report.)\n\nWho was responsible? Everyone, really, but here are six of the Top Ten that spent less on ads in 2007: General Motors, TimeWarner, Ford Motor, AT&T, Walt Disney, News Corp.\n\nWhat’s ahead in this category? I think we’ll see continued increases in online ad revenues and spend, in the area of up 23% for 2008. As for traditional media, I would expect this year (2008) to be down in the U.S., with print continuing to lead the pack. Overall, we may move into negative ad numbers this year, with total U.S. ad spending down 3-5%.\n\nThe Dalai Lama comes to Seattle:\n\n(Photo: Seattle P-I)\n\n“Individuals in the Pacific Northwest have several traits. They’re highly educated, very willing to move, they’re unaffiliated with religious organizations and yeah – they tend to be spiritual,” Wellman said. What does that mean? “They believe there’s some purpose or meaning to life. Whether it’s related to God or not is kind of up in the air.” – American religion professor James K. Wellman to the New York Times, last Friday.\n\n(Photo: Seattle P-I)\n\n(Photo: Seattle P-I)\n\n(Photo: Seattle P-I)\n\nWith Governor Chris Gregoire...\n\n(Photo: Seattle P-I)\n\n...and arriving at the first Seattle event, with bodyguards and the Governor.\n\n(Photo: Reuters)\n\nThe world’s spiritual rock star.\n\n“It could be the world’s biggest discovery in the past 30 years.” Harold Lima, head of the National Petroleum Agency, Brazil, on Petrobras’ new Carioca oil find off the coast of Sao Paulo.\n\n“We think having too much bandwidth is a little like being too rich or too thin. For most of us, it is difficult to be too much of either.” Eric Rabe, Verizon spokesperson, on the company’s advantage in glass fiber.\n\n“We expect parallelism to permeate every corner of computing going forward.” Andrew Chien, VP Corporate Technology Group, Intel.\n\nSo do all SNSers.\n\n“The idea that using weapons to topple a democratic government has not been censured is not only stupid. It is frightening.” Vice President Francisco Santos, on finding alleged proof that Hugo Chavez, Venezuelan president, is providing money for guns to the FARC guerillas in Colombia.\n\n“It is difficult to buy more U.S. Treasuries because the portion of our Treasury investment is already too big and Treasury yields have fallen a lot. We need to diversify our portfolio away from U.S. Treasuries and we find asset-backed securities and corporate debt more attractive because of wider credit spreads.” Kwag Dae-hwan, head of global investments at the Korean National Pension Service, running $220B in assets; quoted in the Financial Times.\n\nRe: ***SNS*** The Wave Age, Part II\n\nMark,\n\nRegarding your comments [in last week’s Ethermail]:\n\nPart 1: Convert a couple hundred million–point pollution sources into a few hundred, by driving electric transport vehicles. Which leaves:\n\nPart 2. Invest heavily in cleaning up the power sources.\n\nI agree completely. And I do think most people get it. I think the concern I have (and I admit freely I am probably biased): we seem to chase alternatives almost as if they are social fads at the expense of address the boring, non-glamorous but very important Part 2 you mentioned above.\n\nIf we could generate the same excitement about cleaning up power plants as we had two years ago for ethanol plants, we would have moved the effort on cleaning up the power sources a great deal. I am not suggesting we should not be excited about ethanol or any other alternative, in fact we need all the excitement we can generate on anything regarding energy, but we also need to put more emphasis on your Part 2 now along with working on part 1.\n\nRespectfully\n\nRandy Foutch\n\nCEO\n\nLaredo Petroleum\n\nTulsa, OK\n\nRandy,\n\nYour comments on this are right on target. When you refer to “excitement,” that implies consumer education. Historically, the “excitement” behind things like ethanol, I am afraid, came from mega lobbying firms representing the ag industry.\n\nCan normal people – the voters – gain the same traction with Congress, even if they do get excited? What matters more, 100 letters from constituents or a check for $100k to some nameless re-election PAC by the coal industry?\n\nI wonder if the best way to do this is either pressure (mount a pro–nuclear power move that cuts prior suppliers out completely, la France and Japan) or work directly with coal and gas suppliers to recruit their support and enthusiasm for a new generation of plant technologies.\n\nAs a gas guy, you probably have an opinion on how you, and your colleagues, would see this. Are they ready for a change?\n\nMany thanks for writing in. You remain one of our few beacons in the petro wilderness.\n\nMark Anderson\n\nMark,\n\nWhile all this is great, I’m not sure the Wave Age will really start until we have a generation of people educated from the start on wave theory, non-deterministic systems, probability functions, etc.\n\nToday we still teach classical science at the middle school/high school level -- very deterministic models of chemistry, physics, etc.\n\nThen when you get to college, at some point you have to rip all this framework out of your head and relearn materials science and physics from the bottom up based on quantum theory, waves, etc. All those old models of chemistry and materials just get in the way at this point.\n\nImagine what people will be able to achieve if we have the right tools and framework at the beginning.\n\nJohn Ludwig\n\nPartner\n\nIgnition Partners\n\nBellevue, WA\n\nJohn,\n\nYou said it perfectly.\n\nAnd since you’ve said it, let me add a bit to the rant.\n\nHow is it that society continues to add layer after layer of scientific and technical complexity to our knowledge base, but never changes what is taught in K-12? How will children in the future (or today) ever learn what is known if they don’t have more exposure to modern knowledge in their early years?\n\nBut you’ve said it best: the problem is not only one of quantity, but also of quality. Students are not exposed to the most basic concepts of modern science and technology in K-12, or even in much of undergraduate work. Want to learn about the basics of quantum mechanics, heralded by everyone from psychiatrists to physicists to investment gurus?\n\nWell, too bad, because you’ll probably have to wait until graduate school before you get any real exposure.\n\nConversely (and I’ve shared this with Seymour Papert, who seems to delightedly agree): What is calculus? It is a tool, invented by Leibniz and or Newton, to discover areas under a curve, or rates of change.\n\nThat’s the good news. The bad news: it is only useful, even in the most adept hands, for the most basic shapes and problems. If you try to use calculus with almost anything from nature, it breaks (the area under a coastline, or inside a leaf?). Which is too bad, since the world is 99.9% natural shapes.\n\nGuess what we have today? Computer screens. Want to solve those insolvable problems? OK, here goes:\n\nPut the leaf shape on the screen.\n\nCount the pixels inside the leaf.\n\nMultiply by area per pixel.\n\nTakes about a millionth of a second.\n\nNow explain to me why students should spend three or four years studying calculus. What a HUGE waste of time, to master an outdated and fairly useless toolset.\n\nOK, end of rant.\n\nYou are right; we need to revolutionize what we teach children, and how we do it. Frankly, I don’t see us getting there until we achieve the Inkwell goal of one computer per student, all connected to the Net. These kids need a direct connection to digitized knowledge, and to the best teachers – and teaching techniques – in the world.\n\nMark Anderson\n\nMark,\n\nI know you always have a backlog of reading material but I thought you would make time for good news too!\n\nYou recall we are an enterprise speech play for mobile workers. We have recently included warehouse workers specifically fork lift drivers to our portfolio of mobile workers. As you will see from the diagram, we enabled a fork lift driver with a Cisco IP phone, WiFi in the warehouse, VoIP into the Coke Cola Enterprises’ SAP data center and our packaged application software to direct picking work to 2000 workers in 100 warehouses in three languages (Spanish, English and Canadian French). Coke Cola Enterprises saw a three month payback on this multi-million dollar investment.\n\n(As this was never done before, we solved significant technical challenges with battery life, 8 hour WiFi/VoIP phone call stability, firmware changes, timeout issues and Voice XML changes.)\n\nWe partnered with SAP and Cisco and are included in yesterday’s Cisco press release.\n\nhttp://news.moneycentral.msn.com/ticker/article.aspx?\n\nFeed=MW&Date=20080410&ID=8469365&Symbol=CSCO\n\nQuantum improvements with innovative technology!\n\nAll the best,\n\nJim Greenwell\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nDatria Systems, Inc\n\nEnglewood, CO\n\nwww.datria.com\n\nJim,\n\nIt sounds like win/win, and one of those situations in which existing technology (with tweaking) can, by clean integration, revolutionize current business practices.\n\nMore and more often, it strikes me that the bleeding/leading edge of tech is not only out of touch with real users, but is fading away (in users’ eyes) into a growing “relevance gap.”\n\nThanks for sharing this win with us, and best of luck continuing to solve real problems.\n\nMark Anderson\n\nMark,\n\n[By email: a chain letter, passed to me by friend, fuel cell inventor, and SNSer Geoffrey Ballard]\n\nMaybe this is a good idea, but what if Esso and Shell own the other companies, like Chevron, Tempo etc.? The gas all comes from the same refineries, doesn’t it? Anyhow, it would be interesting to see this put into motion and the end result.\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE ‘DON’T BUY’ GAS FOR ONE DAY,\n\nBUT IT WILL SHOW YOU HOW WE CAN GET GAS BACK\n\nDOWN TO $1.05 PER LITRE.\n\nThis was sent by a retired Coca Cola executive. It came from one of his engineer buddies who retired from Halliburton. If you are tired of the gas prices going up AND they will continue to rise this summer, take time to read this please.\n\nPhillip Hollsworth offered this good idea. This makes MUCH MORE SENSE than the ‘don’t buy gas on a certain day’ campaign that was going around last April or May! It’s worth your consideration. Join the resistance!!!!\n\nI hear we are going to hit close to $ 1.50 a litre by next summer, and it might go higher!! Want gasoline prices to come down?\n\nWe need to take some intelligent, united action. The oil companies just laughed at that because they knew we wouldn’t continue to\n\n‘hurt’ ourselves by refusing to buy gas.\n\nIt was more of an inconvenience to us than it was a problem for them. BUT, whoever thought of this idea has come up with a plan that can really work. Please read on and join with us!\n\nBy now you’re probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.20 is super cheap. Me too! It is currently $1.05 for regular unleaded in my\n\ntown.\n\nNow that the oil companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a litre of gas is CHEAP at $1 .05- $1.20, we need to take aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS control the marketplace... not sellers.\n\nWith the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take action.\n\nThe only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we hit someone in the pocketbook by not purchasing their gas! And, we can do that WITHOUT hurting ourselves.\n\nHow? Since we all rely on our cars, we can’t just stop buying gas.\n\nBut we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all act together to force a price war.\n\nHere’s the idea: For the rest of this year, DON’T purchase ANY gasoline from the two biggest companies, ESSO [Exxon] and SHELL.\n\nIf they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to reduce their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies will have to follow suit.\n\nBut to have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of ESSO [Exxon] and SHELL gas buyers. It’s really simple to do! Now, don’t wimp out on me at this point...keep reading and I’ll explain how simple it is to reach millions of people!!\n\nI am sending this note to 30 people. If each of us send it to at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300) ... and those 300 send it to at least ten more (300 x10 = 3,000)...and so on, by the time the message reaches the sixth group of people, we will have reached over THREE MILLION consumers.\n\nIf those three million get excited and pass this on to ten friends each, then 30 million people will have been contacted!\n\nAgain, all you have to do is send this to 10 people. That’s all!\n\n(If you don’t understand how we can reach 30 million and all you have to do is send this to 10 people.... Well, let’s face it, you just aren’t a mathematician. But I am. So trust me on this one.)\n\nHow long would all that take? If each of us sends this e-mail out to ten more people within one day of receipt, all 30 MILLION people could conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days !!!\n\nI’ll bet you didn’t think you and I had that much potential, did you! Acting together we can make a difference.\n\nIf this makes sense to you, please pass this message on. I suggest that we not buy from ESSO [Exxon] / SHELL UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.08 RANGE AND KEEP THEM DOWN. THIS CAN REALLY WORK.\n\nKeep it going\n\nFrom Geoffrey Ballard\n\n[Ballard Engineering\n\nVancouver, BC]\n\nGeoffrey,\n\nLike you, I can’t really see anything wrong with this idea. Since I believe that current gas (and oil) pricing are not market-driven (i.e., are not driven by user demand or real market supply), I don’t even feel bad about espousing rough tactics.\n\nI hope it works.\n\nMark Anderson\n\nMark,\n\nThis was sent to me by a colleague.\n\n<http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/rumors_arab_israeli_war_and_sum_routine_events>\n\nI am betting you know of Stratfor. I don’t. Just curious about what you think of their perspective on current events in the Middle East and the validity of the assertion that something big is about to happen? (Although in that part of the world, something is always about to happen…. ).\n\nRegards\n\nAlex Baluta\n\n[Analyst\n\nKirchner Private Capital Group\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada]\n\nAlex,\n\nI’ve enjoyed Stratfor for years. In this case, George Friedman seems to be saying that, because of a few other events and large troop exercises/buildups, someone is about to start another Middle East war.\n\nPersonally, I think Israel is completely out of control, and whatever restraint might have previously come from the U.S. as its partner is now replaced by the “preemptive war” doctrine of the current administration.\n\nShoot first, think later.\n\nThe question may be this: having destroyed his father’s family name in politics, will Bush Jr. multiply his adventures in a final blaze of misled neocon adventures? While the neocons have been cleaned out of the Pentagon like so many rats (with one about to be convicted of spying for Israel), Cheney’s office remains well-stocked with them. If you think Dick is running the country, which I do, this means bad things can still happen.\n\nIs Friedman’s concern warranted? Absolutely. I would tend to discount some of the points he raises as worry nodes: once we put the Sixth Fleet off Lebanon, it makes some sense that Syria would launch an exercise, since it runs Lebanon, and wants to keep running it.\n\nIsrael launching its own exercise could be about intimidating Palestine on the way into negotiations (Olmert met with Abbas yesterday, for example). The assassination of the No. 2 leader of Hamas in Syria is not surprising: Israel assassinates every leader it can find, for starters – anytime, anywhere. It is a despicable policy, and one the U.S. quietly condones.\n\nSo: the worry to me is the election. Does Israel feel that it must cash in the rest of its neocon chips now, and get the U.S. deeper into its “mine enemies are thine enemies” program?\n\nIf so, these are indeed risky times.\n\nIt would be simpler if I thought the U.S. actions were being taken solely on the basis of our own national interest.\n\nMark Anderson\n\n» New Members’ Welcome\n\nI would like to welcome, among others, these new members to the SNS family:\n\nTara McKee, T-Mobile, Bellevue, WA; Amanda Cavataio, T-Mobile, Bellevue, WA; Clayton Wilson, T-Mobile, Bellevue, WA; Kush Panatch, President, Panatch Holdings LTD, Richmond, British Columbia; Peter Neupert, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft, Redmond, WA; and many more.\n\n»\n\n(All rates $USD)\n\nIf you are not a subscriber, the prior Strategic News Service item has been sent to you for a one-month trial.
