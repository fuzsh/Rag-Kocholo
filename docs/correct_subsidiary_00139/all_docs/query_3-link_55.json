You can nominate to serve on the expert group of these JSRs by clicking on the \"Join Expert Group\" link on the JSR detail page urls listed below.\n\nYou can also join the Observer Alias of JCP 2.6 JSRs by emailing the spec lead (listed on the JSR detail page).\n\nTwo new JSRs submitted by the OSSJ team.\n\nJSR 263, Fault Management API. This JSR provides for the monitoring and management of alarms within an information or a telecommunications network. The review for this JSR closes on 20 December.\n\nJSR 264, Order Management API. This JSR defines an interface to an Order Management component, with specific extensions for activation and work order management use-cases. The review for this JSR closes on 27 December.\n\nJSLEE Expert Group met in Turin.\n\nJSR 240 experts met in Turin, Italy, in early September to move JSLEE 1.1 closer to completion. The Expert Group is focused on the Java Standard for Resource Adapter interfaces. Resource Adapters allow the JSLEE platform to communicate to the outside world. By providing a standard for Resource Adapters, legacy networks as well as new emerging next generation 3G and IMS networks may readily converge onto a JSLEE platform. In Turin, the expert group provided further definition for profiles and J2EE integration. The spec leads and the experts are working hard to ready the specification for Public Review. The next meeting is planned for January 05 in San Francisco, CA.\n\nIn addition, Lucent, Nortel, BEA, NTTData, Truetel, Net4Call, and Aepona have joined the JSLEE Expert Group.\n\nAs JSLEE moves deeper into Communications, more companies that have a vested interest in Java and Network technologies have joined the JSLEE Expert Group. With Alcatel making early JSLEE announcements, and Network Operators such as Vodafone issuing RFPs and RFIs that include JSLEE, major Network Equipment Providers are making JSLEE product plans for 2005. To insure Network products align with the standard, several NEPs and ISVs have come on board to further drive the specification.\n\nReading for the long winter nights.\n\nJSR 243 Java Data Objects 2.0, An Extension to the JDO specification, Public Draft is available to peruse during the long winter nights. The high level objectives are to make JDO easier to use, closely align JDO with J2EE, standardize JDO's database support, and broaden the scope of JDO. This review closes 17 January.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nJCP PMO Updates\n\nHappy Holidays from the PMO!
