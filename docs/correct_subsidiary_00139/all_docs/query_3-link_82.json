Let’s look at the acquisitions Oracle has done and put them in context. So, in fiscal year 2005, we made four acquisitions. PeopleSoft was the biggest, followed by a few of them; we were just getting started. In fiscal year 2006 we did 17 acquisitions. And, already, in fiscal 2007, we’ve made 8 acquisitions. But what looks like a lot of logos up there is actually a very, very methodical strategy. Let me take you through why this makes sense for both Oracle and for our customers. The first thing is talking about the best-in-class enterprise application suite. When we started off before PeopleSoft, we had 13,000 applications customers. We were committed to applications, but we didn’t have the scale to compete. With PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems, and a bunch of the other acquisitions we’ve made to focus on applications, we now have over 30,000 applications customers and this has given us the scale and leadership in a number of key areas to allow us to compete more effectively and to bring more value to our customers because of the increased scale and increased technology capabilities that all of these product lines provide. Another key part of this is the vertical specialization and domain expertise that is now part of our family of products. Drilling into some industries, let’s talk about communications first. Communications has always been a critical focus industry for Oracle. Through a series of acquisitions in the last 18 months, we’ve helped grow our business so that today we’re responsible for some form of applications or infrastructure software to over 90% of the communications companies worldwide. Siebel Systems, HotSip and Net4Call for our service delivery platform. Times Ten for in-memory database. Telephony at Work for contact center software. And Portal Software for communications billing. Retail, the same thing. Retail is identified as a critical industry with Retek we had an added merchandising applications. Added 360 Commerce for point of sale, Profit Logic for profit optimization and Tempo Soft for workforce management. We have one of the most comprehensive retail industry software application suites in the industry. Turning to the infrastructure, talking about security software, obviously we’ve always been known for secure software, but not for security software. Through a series of acquisitions – Companies like Oblix, Thor and OctetString, Gartner Group came out after the acquisitions of Thor and OctetString and said we had the most comprehensive identity and access management suite in the industry, bar none. That’s the example and power of adding a bunch of great individuals with domain expertise and the right products and bring the Oracle brand behind it. And then at the database layer, we have 275,000 existing customers. We’re obviously the number one database overall. But we’re always focused on the large relational database. Realizing that there are other great opportunities, our acquisitions extended us into memory, embedded, non-SQL, and Open Source database through acquisitions, giving us a whole new opportunity to drive revenue and meet our customer needs. There’s obviously an opportunity for innovation and development within Oracle and there’s an opportunity to look to add in even more innovation and drive value for our customers through a very coherent acquisition strategy.\n\n19 Our Corporate Vision Customer Success Partnering Excellence Innovation\n\nKey Business Drivers Customer Success Partnering Excellence Innovation Continuous Learning Corporate Social Leadership In 2003 Oracle embarked on a strategic growth campaign that to date has seen the acquisition and integration of over 38 business organisations into Oracle. Bringing so many firms together requires a clear understanding of what our Clients and Partners should expect from us, how we will continue the innovation and knowledge sharing in such a complex organisation and not least important what is Oracle in the world community. Oracle created 5 initiative areas to answer these challenges, which constantly guide our daily work: Customer Success, Partnering Excellence, Innovation, Continuous Learning and Corporate Social Leadership.\n\n20 Customer Success Goal: We want to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and contribute to their succe$$. We want to delight our customers so much that they spontaneously offer to act as references. Priorities: Executive Sponsorship Program Collaborative Engagement Program Customer Relationship Survey Customer Feedback Process Executive Sponsorship Program: Each key customer is provided with an executive sponsor from our Country Leaders Team, who looks after them at a top-management level. Collaborative Engagement Program: Solution implementation projects handled by our certified partners are accompanied by Oracle experts. This ensures the adherence to the project timeline and budget. Customer Relationship Survey: Your complete satisfaction with Oracle is a major priority for us - in every single area of our collaboration. Therefore, you will regularly be requested to share your opinion with us, which we will then turn into tangible improvement measures.
