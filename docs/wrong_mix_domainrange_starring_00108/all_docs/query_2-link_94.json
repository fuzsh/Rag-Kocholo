        "text": "Toy Story 4's Voice Cast Is Full Of Surprise Celebrities\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the original Toy Story movie hit theaters way back in 1995. Since then, the franchise continues to deliver heartfelt and rewarding sequels that somehow make theatergoers want to cry, think about their childhoods, and erupt into laughter in the same sitting. Now, nine years after the release of Toy Story 3, which was supposed to be the concluding film, Toy Story 4 brings the celeb voice cast (along with a few new names) back for more.\n\nOver the years, fans of the Toy Story franchise have come to love the voices behind Woody, Buzz, and company — and not just the Tom Hankses and Tim Allens in the lineup, but secondary voice actors like Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and Annie Potts, too.\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Toy Story 4, all the franchise favourites return to reunite with Bo Peep (Potts) and to team up with a few new toys. To boot, the cast even includes a few surprise celebrity cameos. Seriously, there are a so many well-known actors in this film (which is completely understandable because who wouldn’t want to be a part of the Toy Story franchise?) that you might miss a few. Luckily, we caught 'em all for you.\n\n1 of 27\n\nTony Hale: The Voice Of Forky\n\nToy Story 4's Forky, Bonnie’s original creation made from a spork and literal trash, is a brand new character you've probably seen dominating the trailers. He's brought to the big screen by Tony Hale, who's known for similarly panicky, insecure characters like Arrested Development's Buster Bluth and Veep's Gary. Audiences are absolutely going to welcome Forky to this animated universe with open arms, much like the toys do in the film.\n\n2 of 27\n\nAnnie Potts: The Voice Of Bo Peep\n\nAs you may know by now, Toy Story 4 marks the return of Bo Peep, voiced by Annie Potts, who's been working in TV and movies for decades. Her most iconic character, of course, is Mary Jo from Designing Women. For her part, the character of Bo had a major role in Toy Story and Toy Story 2, but she'd been given away as of Toy Story 3. She’s back now and sporting a more combat-ready ensemble.\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n\n3 of 27\n\nKeegan-Michael Key: The Voice Of Ducky\n\nComedian and actor Keegan-Michael Key comes to the Toy Story universe in the form of an adorable toy duck who escapes life as a carnival prize. He's appropriately named Ducky. He will definitely have audiences laughing from the moment he appears until the end credit scenes finish.\n\n4 of 27\n\nJordan Peele: The Voice of Bunny\n\nJordan Peele stepped away from creating genius horror films for a moment to team up again with his Key & Peele co-star for this movie. Peele voices Bunny, who also comes from the carnival and is actually sewn to Key’s character Ducky by his hand. Reunited, er, permanently re-attached and it feels so good!\n\n5 of 27\n\nChristina Hendricks: Voice Of Gabby Gabby\n\nLike her Good Girls character, Mad Men veteran Christina Hendricks’ Gabby Gabby isn’t the sweet, innocent person she first appears to be. But while the antique doll’s big blue eyes and smile become a bit sinister as she's revealed as the film's antagonist, there's another side to her story.\n\n6 of 27\n\nKeanu Reeves: The Voice Of Duke Caboom\n\nThe long overdue “era of Keanu Reeves” continues from Always Be My Baby to Toy Story 4. Reeves isn’t playing himself this time, but don’t worry: He still brings uncontrollable laughter with his new character Duke Caboom. According to USA Today, Reeves advocated for Duke Caboom having a backstory. It does not disappoint.\n\n7 of 27\n\nAlly Maki: The Voice Of Giggle McDimples\n\nShe may be tiny, but Ally Maki’s new character Giggle McDimples becomes a crucial part of Woody’s team in the new movie as the tiny a police officer who works with Bo Peep. In real life Maki is known best for her role as Mina in the TV series Cloak & Dagger.\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n\n8 of 27\n\nJay Hernandez: The Voice Of Bonnie’s Dad\n\nIn a moment that crushed the hearts of viewers everywhere, Andy gave up all his toys, including Woody, to a young girl named Bonnie and left for college at the end of Toy Story 3. Andy will always be missed, but Bonnie is adorable and her comical parents add another funny element to the movie. Magnum P.I.’s leading man and Mila Kunis' love interest from the Bad Moms movies, Jay Hernandez, voices Bonnie’s Dad.\n\n9 of 27\n\nBonnie Hunt: The Voice Of Dolly\n\nBonnie Hunt adds the perfect amount of sass to her character Dolly who was introduced in Toy Story 3 as one of Bonnie’s toys. She is the leader of her group of toys just like Woody but the two alphas still get along.\n\n10 of 27\n\nKristen Schaal: The Voice Of Trixie The Triceratops\n\nWith the growing fanbase for Bob’s Burgers and BoJack Horseman, Kristen Schaal’s voice has become very easy to detect. Like Bonnie, Schaal’s Trixie is a toy dinosaur and one of Bonnie’s original toys who ushers in Andy’s toys at the end of Toy Story 3.\n\n11 of 27\n\nJune Squibb: The Voice Of Margaret, The Antique Store Owner\n\nLike Jay Hernandez, beloved actress June Squibb (Good Girls, Nebraska) is one of the few people who voices an actual person in the movie instead of a toy. Squibb's character is named Margaret and she works in the antique shop which is where her Good Girls co-star Christina Hendricks’s Gabby Gabby also resides.\n\n12 of 27\n\nCarl Weathers: The Voice Of The Combat Carls\n\nA blast from the past! The Combat Carls, who are voiced by actor and former football star Carl Weathers, haven’t been seen in the main franchise films since 1995 in Toy Story. The actor, known for his roles in Happy Gilmore, Arrested Development, and Rocky, makes a (brief!) return in the latest Toy Story flick.\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n\n13 of 27\n\nDon Rickles: The Voice Of Mr. Potato Head\n\nWhat '90s kid didn’t play with a Mr. Potato Head growing up? The late Don Rickles’ Mr. Potato Head is another character who has been here since Toy Story, known for constantly exchanging funny quips with the other toys. While Rickles passed away in 2017, the makers of Toy Story 4 pieced together existing audio Rickles recorded for other Toy Story projects before he passed, according to the Los Angeles Times. Don't worry, Pixar got Rickles' family's permission first.\n\n14 of 27\n\nLaurie Metcalf: The Voice Of Andy's Mom\n\nIf you’re still missing Andy after that heartbreaking sendoff in Toy Story 3, don’t be too sad. He does make it into a few flashback shots in Toy Story 4 at various ages, which means his mom also returns. And if you never thought to look, surprise! Lady Bird star Laurie Metcalf has voiced Andy’s mom ever since the original Toy Story.\n\n15 of 27\n\nCarol Burnett: The Voice Of Chairol Burnett\n\nWhile she's not in the movie for long, the great comedic actress Carol Burnett does pop in to voice a toy early on in the new movie. She's one of Bonnie’s toys, a chair with a pun-name; Chairol Burnett.\n\n16 of 27\n\nBetty White: The Voice Of Bitey White\n\nListen closely so that you don’t miss Betty White’s character! Bitey White — whoever came up with these names deserves a raise — appears alongside Chairol Burnett in the beginning of the film as another of Bonnie's toys.\n\n17 of 27\n\nCarl Reiner: The Voice Of Carl Reineroceros\n\nThe prolific director of movies like The Jerk, producer/writer/actor on The Dick Van Dyke Show, and character actor in Ocean's Eleven, Carl Reiner also makes a cameo alongside Burnett and White’s characters. He plays a toy rhino, if you couldn't tell from the name.\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n\n18 of 27\n\nMel Brooks: The Voice Of Melephant Brooks\n\nMelephant Brooks is the last of Bonnie’s toys that is voiced by a Hollywood legend and icon. Filmmaker, actor, and comedian Mel Brooks is known for Spaceballs, The Producers, Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein (to name a few). He's also the voice behind the cute elephant in Bonnie's closet.\n\n19 of 27\n\nBill Hader: The Voice Of Axel the Carnie\n\nWho isn’t in Toy Story 4? SNL veteran and Barry star Bill Hader subtly delivers laughs as Axel, the attendant at the carnival booth where Ducky and Bunny are first introduced. He makes the most of his quick handful of scenes.\n\n20 of 27\n\nPatricia Arquette: The Voice Of Harmony’s Mom\n\nPatricia Arquette is an Oscar-winner, she's been in about a million movies, she's looking at a potential Emmy nomination for her work on Hulu's The Act, and she also has a teeny tiny part in Toy Story 4. She voices the mother of Harmony, a little girl who Gabby Gabby wishes would take her home.\n\n21 of 27\n\nFlea: The Voice Of Duke Caboom's Announcer\n\nIn Duke Caboom's brief origin story, we also see a commercial for the Duke Caboom toy. It's a callback to the Buzz Lightyear ad we saw in the original Toy Story and it also features the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ bassist and founding member, Flea.\n\n22 of 27\n\nTimothy Dalton: The Voice Of Mr. Pricklepants\n\nRounding out the group of Toy Story 3 characters who return for the newest film is Mr. Pricklepants, a dramatic porcupine voiced by British actor Timothy Dalton, who's known for his years as James Bond and long-running roles on Chuck and Penny Dreadful. As Mr. Pricklepants, he never fails to add some theatrics and a great one-liner to the situation.\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n\n23 of 27\n\nTom Hanks: The Voice Of Woody\n\nYou probably already know that Tom Hanks voices Sheriff Woody, the Toy Story franchise's beloved lead character. He has been there from the beginning and he is the guiding light that the toys can always count on. Toy Story 4, however, might be his last ride in those snake-infested boots.\n\n24 of 27\n\nJoan Cusack: The Voice Of Jessie The Cowgirl\n\nAlthough Jessie wasn’t as much a part of the action in Toy Story 4, she has become a fan favourite since showing up in Toy Story 2. The cowgirl is back with her charm and smile to help save the day, and Cusack's unique voice is back to bring her to life.\n\n25 of 27\n\nTim Allen: The Voice Of Buzz Lightyear\n\nFind someone who is the Buzz Lightyear to your Woody. Buzz and Woody formed their friendship 24 years ago in Toy Story. Despite a few bumps along the way, they are still best buds who help each other and protect their friends. In real life Tim Allen may (or may not) be real pals with Woody's voice, Tom Hanks.\n\n26 of 27\n\nWallace Shawn: The Voice Of Rex\n\nRex, Wallace Shawn’s character, has been backing Woody and Buzz since the original Toy Story. He isn’t ferocious but he is undoubtedly the most lovable Tyrannosaurus Rex to ever be on the big screen. Shawn is not just the voice of a beloved toy, you also might recognize him from his inconceivable! and iconic role in The Princess Bride.\n\n27 of 27\n\nJohn Ratzenberger: The Voice Of Hamm\n\nAnother irreplaceable member of the ensemble cast is Hamm, the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger. His banter with Rex has made him a fan favourite since the first Toy Story. Out in the real world, Ratzenberger is known for his role as Cliff Clavin on Cheers and for voicing a character in every Pixar movie, including Mac in Cars, the Abominable Snowman in Monsters, Inc., the Underminder in The Incredibles, and P.T. Flea in A Bug's Life.\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT"
