        "text": "AS: After you discovered your voice, how did it evolve?\n\nBH: I didn’t think about it that much until I started taking classes at The Second City. I always wanted to be a filmmaker and I read up and studied how to be one but I kind of got in my head a little bit. Some people get a lot out of that. I do to an extent but then I get to a place where I’m over thinking. What was nice with taking improv classes was that the point was not to think but just react and be in the moment. In doing that I figured out what I find funny and why my sensibility is, but it was very natural. In my instance, it’s Monty Python and early Woody Allen movies. For SNL, the question was, “What does the show find funny?” You have to find a Venn diagram of where your sense of humor and the show’s sense of humor intersect. What the overlay is. That was always very difficult. After my fourth year on the show I figured out where I stood on it and I could say “That’s a joke that could work with my friends but not the SNL audience.”"
