        "text": "Sometimes persistence is key.\n\nAli Wong opened up about her personal life, from her divorce to the start of her budding romance with Bill Hader, during a set at the Wiltern in Los Angeles on May 12.\n\nWong and Hader briefly dated in 2022 for two months. After reconciling, they made their first public appearance together at the 2024 Golden Globes.\n\n“I get a phone call from this guy who I met at a dinner party in the past, and he got my number from a mutual friend,” Wang shared onstage, per Rolling Stone. “He was like, ‘Hey, I just happened to hear the news about your divorce, and I’ve had a crush on you forever. I actually told my best friend years ago that you were my dream girl, and I know it sounds crazy, but I want you to be my girlfriend.'”\n\nThe 42-year-old initially turned down Hader because she “wanted to get her money’s worth” after paying $25 for a dating app.\n\nStill wanting a relationship with Wong, Hader did something that alarmed the “Beef” star.\n\nThe 45-year-old “Saturday Night Live” alum sent flowers to the hotel she was staying at in Europe. Though her girlfriend thought the action was sweet, it unsettled her male pals.\n\n“That’s how cheap and lazy men have become. When a fellow man commits any act of kindness, any romantic gesture, it must be a symptom of an undiagnosed mental illness” Wong explained.\n\nShe added she had “never been pursued this much in my life.”\n\nIn January, Wong made headlines when she kissed the “Barry” actor at the Globes ceremony before she accepted her award for Best Actress — Miniseries or Television Film for “Beef.”\n\nDuring her speech, Wong thanked her now ex-husband, Justin Hakuta.\n\n“I really need to thank the father of my children and my best friend Justin for all of your love and support,” the actress gushed at the time. “It’s because of you that I’m able to be a working mother.”\n\nWong and Hakuta married in 2014 and have two daughters — Mari, 8, and Nikki, 6, 8. She officially filed for divorce in December 2023 after the pair separated in 2022.\n\nWhile the “Big Mouth” actress performed several sold-out shows at the Wiltern for the Netflix Is a Joke Fest, Hader joined her on stage at the end of her Sunday night set.\n\nHader quipped: “All I have to say is, Ali Wong is off the market.”"
