Hader stars as Barry Berkman, a former U.S. Marine from Cleveland who works as a hitman; upon traveling to Los Angeles to kill a target, he finds himself joining an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler), where he meets aspiring actress Sally Reed (Sarah Goldberg) and begins to question his path in life as he deals with his criminal associates such as Monroe Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan).\n\nBarry received critical acclaim, with most praise going to its directing, writing, originality, humor, characters, and performances (particularly those of Hader and Winkler) as well as its examination of its subject matter. Several critics have labeled it as one of the best television series of all time.\n\nThe series has received various accolades, including 44 Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Hader won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series twice, while Winkler won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance in the first season. For the second season, Winkler, Root, and Carrigan all received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor, while Goldberg received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress. Hader, Winkler, and Carrigan each received two more nominations for the third and fourth seasons. All four seasons of Barry were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series.\n\nBarry follows Barry Berkman, a U.S. Marine and Afghanistan veteran from Cleveland, who works as a hitman and wrestles with loneliness, depression, and guilt caused by his lifestyle as well as his actions during his service. He travels to Los Angeles to kill a target and finds a new sense of purpose when he follows his target into an acting class. After joining the class and making plans to become an actor, using his newfound passion as an outlet for his anxiety, he struggles to distance himself from his old life and keep his past a secret from new friends and colleagues.[8]\n\nBill Hader as Barry Berkman, a depressed former private first class from the U.S. Marines and Afghanistan veteran who works as a hitman but is drawn towards human connection in an acting class. A mentally unstable yet exceptional assassin, Barry longs to put his criminal history behind him to become a full-time performer under the stage name Barry Block, but struggles to stop his past from creeping into the new life he tries to build for himself. The character's struggle with anxiety in a profession for which he has natural talent was inspired by Hader's tenure as a cast member on Saturday Night Live.[9]\n\nReese Levine portrays Barry as a child in flashbacks (season 4).\n\nStephen Root as Monroe Fuches, Barry's old family friend since Barry's childhood and a former military cook, who groomed him for his post-military career as a hitman. He is cowardly, manipulative, and self-centered, refusing to believe he has been anything but good to Barry despite consistently abusing him and dragging him back into a life of crime to serve his own personal interests.\n\nSarah Goldberg as Sally Reed, an aspiring and talented but struggling actress from Joplin, Missouri. She meets Barry when he joins her acting class and becomes romantically involved with him, culminating in a dysfunctional relationship. Seemingly good-natured but selfish and envious, Sally is focused on gaining fame and fortune as an actress while frequently alternating between bouts of narcissism and self-hatred in both her personal life and creative work.\n\nGlenn Fleshler as Goran Pazar (season 1; guest season 3), the leader of the Los Angeles branch of the Chechen mafia, who employs Barry to kill a man who has been sleeping with his wife, and whose gang is in conflict with a Bolivian drug cartel. Despite his ruthlessness as a crime boss, he cares greatly for his teenage daughter Natasha.\n\nAnthony Carrigan as NoHo Hank, an overly positive, polite, and naïve member of the Chechen mafia, and Goran's best friend and right-hand man, whose birth name is never revealed. Though he would be happier conducting legitimate business, particularly in sales, he sticks to his belief that being a gangster is his life's calling. Hank quickly becomes attached to Barry, who does not reciprocate his attempts at friendship. Following Goran's death, he becomes the leader of the Chechen mafia but struggles with this responsibility as he lacks in the skills necessary to be a gangster. Originally planned to be killed by Barry in the pilot episode, Hank was made a series regular after Carrigan's performance impressed the show's creators.[10]\n\nHenry Winkler as Gene Cousineau, an eccentric acting coach and Barry's mentor whose glory days as a performer are long behind him, having alienated his industry colleagues and loved ones. Cousineau is self-absorbed and rarely seems to help his acting students, in whom he instills a nearly fanatical devotion, unless it directly benefits him. Despite this, he makes a connection with and serves as a father figure to Barry, helping him come to terms with his past atrocities and grow as a person until he learns of his criminal activity.\n\nSarah Burns as Detective Mae Dunn (season 3; recurring season 2; guest season 4),[11] a naïve and obtuse investigator who becomes Loach's partner.\n\nRobert Wisdom as Jim Moss (season 4; recurring season 3), the father of LAPD Detective Janice Moss, who previously served in the U.S. Army in the field of psychological warfare.\n\nTyler Jacob Moore as Richard Krempf / Ryan Madison, a personal trainer and actor in Gene's class whom Goran hires Barry to kill, though Ryan is instead killed by Chechen assassins.

Barry follows Ryan to an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau, where Ryan convinces Barry to perform a scene with him. Despite a poor performance, Ryan befriends Barry and invites him to a bar with the class, where Barry takes an interest in actor Sally Reed. Barry drives a drunk Ryan home, which is witnessed by Noho Hank, Goran's second-in-command. The next day, Barry's handler Monroe Fuches arrives and warns Barry that the Chechens will kill them if Barry does not kill Ryan. That night, Barry tells Gene that he is a hitman but wants a different life. Gene, believing the confession is an improvised performance, gives Barry another chance at his class, and Barry introduces himself as \"Barry Block\", a stage name Ryan devised. Barry decides to kill Ryan but finds Ryan already dead and the Chechens prepared to shoot him, too. Barry shoots the Chechens, unaware that their lipstick camera has recorded him. At a nearby diner, while police cars speed past, Barry tells his waitress that he is an actor.\n\n22\"Chapter Two: Use It\"Bill HaderAlec Berg & Bill HaderApril 1, 2018 ( )0.641[13]\n\nLAPD detectives investigate the murders of Ryan and the Chechen mobsters and discover the Russian lipstick camera left by Hank but cannot figure out how it works. Barry and Fuches are kidnapped by the Chechens, and Fuches is tortured via tooth-filing until Barry reluctantly agrees to carry out one last hit on an informant. Gene tells his class that Ryan was murdered, and the students plan an on-stage memorial service, each performing a piece in Ryan's honor. Sally asks Barry to perform a scene from Doubt, the last piece she and Ryan performed together in the class. At the service, Ryan's father delivers an impassioned speech, causing Barry significant distress because he has never before seen the aftermath of his killings. Shaken, Barry declines to perform the Doubt piece. As he walks Sally home, she expresses her desire to have sex with him, but he declines her advances and rushes off. From afar, a Chechen takes photos of Sally.\n\n33\"Chapter Three: Make the Unsafe Choice\"Bill HaderDuffy BoudreauApril 8, 2018 ( )0.595[14]\n\nBarry is ready to kill the Chechens' next target, Paco, but NoHo Hank tells him to wait. Goran's new assassin, Stovka, arrives and is instructed to kill Barry and Fuches once Barry returns. Fuches attempts to talk Stovka out of killing him, and Stovka ends up killing himself instead. Detectives Moss and Loach learn of Ryan's connection to Goran and question Gene and his students. Barry helps Sally prepare for an audition, where Sally is devastated to find that the lead actress is a former friend she had worked with on a failed TV series, and cries during her audition. Barry again prepares to kill Paco but is interrupted by a phone call from Sally, who vents about her problems and begs him to come over. Barry misses his chance to kill Paco with a sniper rifle, so breaks into his house and strangles him to death. Barry then goes to Sally's house, where they have sex and Barry daydreams about a happy future with her but is haunted by Paco's last words which mean \"you don't have to do this\".\n\n44\"Chapter Four: Commit... to YOU\"Maggie CareySarah SolemaniApril 15, 2018 ( )0.511[15]\n\nBarry reconnects with Chris, an old military friend. Fuches gives Barry his next job: to raid a Bolivian stash house for Goran, but Barry believes it to be too dangerous and backs out. Sally prepares for an audition with her agent, who makes an unwelcome advance and claims he was only joking. At the audition, the casting assistant tells Sally that her agent does not represent her and sends her home in tears. Detective Moss meets with Gene at a restaurant, expecting pertinent information about the case; realizing it is a date, she stays anyway. Police techs unlock the lipstick camera, showing Barry as an obscure, silhouetted figure. At a party, Barry presents Sally with an expensive new laptop as a gift, making her uncomfortable since she barely knows him. Barry invites Chris, who brings two other rowdy marines, Vaughn and Taylor. Barry continues to misinterpret his relationship with Sally, and with the marines encouraging him to assert himself, he oversteps and angers Sally. After the party, Taylor finds Barry's notes on the stash house raid and tells Barry that he wants to take part.\n\n55\"Chapter Five: Do Your Job\"Hiro MuraiBen SmithApril 22, 2018 ( )0.643[16]\n\nSally suggests she and Barry take a break from each other, only to discover they have been cast as scene partners in their class's Shakespeare showcase. Detective Moss returns to the acting class and re-interviews Barry and two others who are consistent with the image from the lipstick camera. Barry provides an alibi with the help of Fuches, who tells him to kill Taylor once the raid is done; Barry reluctantly agrees despite his qualms about killing a fellow marine. The acting class discusses the morality of Macbeth, and Barry, feeling the moral weight of his profession, has an emotional outburst, yelling at the class that he has killed people. The class assumes this confession is about Barry's time in the military, while Gene condemns the idea of killing outside of war. That night, Barry and Taylor successfully raid the stash house, killing several men, with Taylor doing most of the killing as well as saving Barry's life. The next morning, Barry meets with Fuches, who is happy to see Barry alive. Taylor soon joins, revealing Barry did not follow Fuches's advice.\n\n66\"Chapter Six: Listen With Your Ears, React With Your Face\"Hiro MuraiEmily HellerApril 29, 2018 ( )0.560[17]\n\nBarry and Fuches survey a desert airstrip used by Bolivian drug lord Cristobal Sifuentes, and Fuches tells Barry he wants Taylor gone. At the stash house, Goran forbids Vacha from killing Barry to avenge his brother's death. After spending the night with Gene, Detective Moss ends their relationship as she is investigating his class. At Taylor's apartment, Barry suggests that Taylor work for Fuches in his place, but Taylor says Barry should kill Fuches. Without Barry's knowledge, Taylor puts half of the stash house money into Barry's backpack, in place of Gene's acting textbook. At acting class, Barry finds the money and hides it. Vacha arrives at the class and follows Sally to her car, but bumps into Moss, who has come to rekindle her relationship with Gene. Vacha runs, and Moss kills him in a shootout. A search warrant is executed at the acting class and the hidden money is found. Barry tells Taylor he will do the job alone, but Taylor arrives with Vaughn and Chris to rapidly storm the airstrip, following Gene's advice from the book. Taylor recklessly drives them to the airfield, where Taylor and Vaughn are shot dead at long range by the Bolivians.\n\n77\"Chapter Seven: Loud, Fast, and Keep Going\"Alec BergLiz SarnoffMay 6, 2018 ( )0.636[18]\n\nBarry and Chris are the only survivors of the botched attack. After Chris kills a Bolivian gang member, the two escape the airfield and return to Los Angeles. Going immediately to rehearsal, Barry gives poor line delivery and is berated by Sally and Gene. The Chechens receive a call from their assassination target, Cristobal, who says that he would have gladly shared the stash house with them but now is forced to declare war. Goran, furious with Fuches and believing Barry dead, orders NoHo Hank to kill Fuches. Moss learns that there was a \"military guy\" involved in the Chechen–Bolivian violence and suspects Barry, but Taylor is already linked to Ryan by evidence. A visibly shaken Chris tells Barry that he intends to go to the police to clear his conscience. In an act of self-preservation, Barry kills Chris and begins to suffer an emotional breakdown. Arriving late to the class's Shakespeare night, Barry delivers his single line with such emotional intensity that the audience becomes captivated and Sally receives a confidence boost, impressing an agent she had invited.\n\n88\"Chapter Eight: Know Your Truth\"Alec BergAlec Berg & Bill HaderMay 13, 2018 ( )0.548[19]\n\nBarry visits Fuches, punches him, and takes a share of his money before telling him he wants to give up crime. Fuches tells Goran that Barry is alive and should be killed, but Goran prepares to kill Fuches instead. Hank alerts Barry, who promptly kills Goran and others holding Fuches, forcing Fuches out of Los Angeles. Hank assumes leadership of the Chechens and allies with the Bolivians. Moss discovers Ryan's copy of Gene's book in Taylor's apartment, believing the two had conspired to bait the Chechens and Bolivians into war. The LAPD discovers the bodies at Goran's house and conclude the Bolivians were responsible, closing the case. Barry rejoins the acting class, resuming his relationship with Sally. Some time later, Gene invites Barry, Sally and Moss to his country home. Gene tells Moss of the monologue Barry gave about being a hitman, prompting Moss to discover a link between Barry, Chris, and Taylor on Facebook. Barry begs her not to pursue things further. When she refuses, he retrieves a hidden gun, and shots ring out. Barry returns to the still-sleeping Sally, and declares, yet again, that his criminal life is over.\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air dateU.S. viewers\n\n(millions)91\"The Show Must Go On, Probably?\"Hiro MuraiAlec Berg & Bill HaderMarch 31, 2019 ( )0.532[20]\n\nWeeks after Moss' disappearance, the police close the case over a lack of leads, sending Gene further into grief-stricken isolation. Gene eventually visits his students after a long absence and tells them he intends to shut down the acting class, but Barry convinces him to continue teaching by recounting his first killing while serving as a marine. Hank finds his thriving partnership with Cristobal threatened by Esther, a Burmese gang leader the Bolivians want to bring into their operation. Hank, facing retaliation from his family for failing to kill Goran's assassin, pins the blame on Esther to protect Barry. He seeks help from Barry, who furiously turns him away for approaching him in public. Hank later approaches Barry again, reminding him that he owes Hank his life, and threatens to kill Barry and his friends unless Barry kills Esther. Fuches, meanwhile, is arrested in Cleveland after hiring a new hitman to replace Barry. Unbeknownst to him, his DNA is matched to a missing tooth found at Goran's murder. Detective Loach uses this information to connect Fuches to Barry, surmising that Barry is the man in the lipstick camera's footage.\n\n102\"The Power of No\"Hiro MuraiTaofik KoladeApril 7, 2019 ( )0.424[21]\n\nHank enlists Barry to kill Esther, but Barry is reluctant to return to a life of killing. Gene, inspired by Barry's tale of his first kill, tasks the acting class with writing and performing a short piece that encapsulates their own personal truth. Barry, not wanting his \"truth\" to be death, convinces Gene to let him tell the story of the day they met. However, after attempting to reconnect with his estranged son Leo, an organic farmer, Gene realizes that he is too self-absorbed and tells Barry that he must tell the Afghanistan story. Sally has found minor success under her new agents, but becomes frustrated at being cast in insignificant roles. Her agent Lindsay sympathizes and urges her to bide her time until the right role comes along. Loach tracks down Fuches in Ohio, and convinces him to return to Los Angeles and elicit a confession from Barry in order to keep himself out of jail. Barry finds himself unable to carry out the hit on Esther, and narrowly escapes from the furious Burmese mob. Barry finds Fuches waiting for him upon returning home, and angrily rebuffs him while a frustrated Loach watches from a surveillance van.\n\n113\"Past = Present x Future Over Yesterday\"Minkie SpiroJason KimApril 14, 2019 ( )1.78[22]\n\nHank attempts to kill Barry after learning of the failed hit on Esther, but Barry foils the assassination attempt. He offers to train Hank and his men so that Hank can eliminate the Burmese himself, restoring Hank's partnership with Cristobal while fulfilling Barry's debt to Hank. For his scene, Barry decides to tell a different story from the war, in which he saved his friend Albert while serving in the Korangal Valley, but struggles to cast himself in a positive light. Fuches again approaches Barry, who welcomes him this time and asks for advice on how to tell the Korangal story; Fuches advises against it and the two have an emotional reunion, further frustrating Loach. Sally decides to tell the story of the night she left her abusive ex-husband, Sam, but feels ashamed that she never stood up to him, and instead writes a version of the story painting her in a stronger light. Barry is reluctant at having to choke Sally while playing the role of Sam; Sally and Gene berate him to get him in the right headspace, but Barry storms out. Sally follows and attempts to reason with him, but shuts down upon realizing Sam has arrived in Los Angeles.\n\n124\"What?!\"Liza JohnsonDuffy BoudreauApril 21, 2019 ( )1.94[23]\n\nBarry and Sally have dinner with Sam, where Barry is barely able to contain his rage. Barry later asks why Sally was so welcoming to Sam; Sally breaks down and admits that she never stood up to Sam. Sally becomes distraught about telling the truth about her relationship with Sam onstage, but Barry assures her that it is sometimes appropriate to keep secrets. Barry later notices Sam sneaking into the theater to watch Sally rehearse her scene; he confronts Sam, who insults Sally and drives away. Sam later invites Sally to his hotel to receive a gift; Sally goes despite her better judgment, where Sam attempts to coerce her out of performing her scene to preserve his reputation. Barry, who secretly followed Sally to the hotel to kill Sam, nearly shoots her when she opens the door to leave. An ashamed Barry visits Gene and opens up about Korengal, revealing that he killed an innocent civilian in a blind rage after Albert had been shot. Gene, shaken by Barry's confession, agrees that he should not share the story with the class, but reassures him that people can change their nature. His spirits lifted, Barry goes to Fuches's hotel to share Gene's advice, but is cornered by Loach into confessing to Moss' murder. However, instead of arresting Barry, Loach blackmails him into killing his ex-wife's lover.\n\n135\"ronny/lily\"Bill HaderAlec Berg & Bill HaderApril 28, 2019 ( )2.03[24]\n\nBarry finds Ronny, Loach's ex-wife's lover, at his house and attempts to negotiate a peaceful deal. However, he discovers that Ronny is a Taekwondo master, and the two fight until Ronny collapses from a broken windpipe. Ronny's daughter Lily, also proficient in Taekwondo, comes home and viciously attacks Barry before fleeing. Barry, left with a stab wound, urges Fuches to take him to a hospital, but Fuches instead drives to a drugstore and shoddily stitches up Barry's wound himself. When Fuches begins to talk about the wound Ronny caused, Barry says that it was actually Lily that stabbed him, and proceeds to call her a “feral mongoose.” Fuches drives around the neighborhood looking for Lily, but gives up on killing her after watching her scale a tree and sit perched for hours on a roof. That night, Barry rips his stitches; Fuches attempts to close the wound with superglue, but ends up gluing his hands to the steering wheel. Lily sneaks into the car and bites off a piece of Fuches's cheek before escaping. Barry and Fuches return to the drugstore, where Barry finds Ronny alive and ready to fight again. Loach arrives and shoots Ronny, but Ronny kills him effortlessly before being shot dead by other police officers. Barry flees and returns to Fuches's car, contemplating their relationship.\n\n146\"The Truth Has a Ring to It\"Alec BergEmily HellerMay 5, 2019 ( )1.99[25]\n\nBarry, infuriated that Fuches turned on him, breaks off their relationship for good and returns to acting class. Once there, he discovers that Sally has rewritten her scene to tell the truth about her relationship with Sam, but is mortified after doing a cold reading for the class. Barry asks for Gene's help, requesting that Gene help him perform well in Sally's scene in lieu of writing his own. Gene tells Barry to use his own story to find the emotion in Sally's. Onstage, Barry taps into his trauma over killing Detective Moss and delivers a spectacular performance, much to Gene's satisfaction. Lindsay, having witnessed the entire performance, offers to help Sally use it to branch out in her career.
