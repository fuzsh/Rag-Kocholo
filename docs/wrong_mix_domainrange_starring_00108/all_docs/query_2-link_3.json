        "text": "Jason Bateman\n\nHow did working on season two compare to the first season?\n\nIt's a full year more in the groove, and understanding the kind of show that everybody wants to be making. Everyone was really excited about the kind of response we got, because sometimes you do jobs and you're not sure whether it's going to connect to an audience and kind of just stay in a bubble.\n\nHow have you seen your character Marty evolve over the two seasons?\n\nHe seems to be getting a little more aware of what his limitations are and what his strengths are. And fortunately for him, the areas where he's lacking there are people around him — namely his wife — who are helping keep everything afloat. In the second year we saw that there are two oars in the water to get this boat to safety but they ended up traveling into some choppy waters, and in this third year the escalations keep coming.\n\nMy favorite scene or line of dialogue from this season was …\n\nI think my favorite moment from season two was when all of the departments came together with the final sequence of the season; where the writers brought all of the storylines together and the camera department and the music and the actors and production design kind of coalesced and landed the plane, for me, just as a viewer of the show, in a really satisfying way. I was really excited when I read the script, and ultimately when I saw it all put together, I was really happy with the way it all turned out and got fairly close to what I had planned. You never really know — you can think and hope for something, but you're really reliant on everyone bringing their best stuff. I'm just very lucky that everyone knows how to deliver and chooses to deliver on this show.\n\nOzark landed nine Emmy noms, including acting and directing for you. What was your reaction to hearing that?\n\nIt’s really exciting to get recognition for all of the work that goes into it, and while both of those are individual awards, I think everyone understands that this isn’t a one-man stand-up comedy special where you’re up there all by yourself and writing your own lines and dictating your own performance. As a director you’re completely beholden to the crew you pull together and the cast, so it was great to get recognition for everybody and it was nice to be on set when the nominations came in. I think last year I was in Los Angeles, but this year we were all together so it was a fun team thing.\n\nWas there anyone from your show who wasn't recognized that you think should have been?\n\nThat's a question that's completely impossible for me to answer. In my opinion, there's not anyone on the show who's not worthy of recognition, because everybody is working absolutely as hard as they can. There's a great work ethic on the show and I just couldn't be prouder of everybody.\n\nSterling K. Brown\n\nHow has the show changed since you started?\n\nAll of the children are older, and I'm reminded of Lost when Walt had to be kicked off the island because he just didn't look the same age as he was supposed to. I look around at all of the young versions of Randall and Kevin and Kate and watch them grow up in front of my eyes, and I look at Déjà and Tess and Annie — the actors that play them — and I'm like, my goodness, these ladies just keep growing day in and day out, it's kind of amazing.\n\nHow have you seen Randall evolve over the course of the show?\n\nI love Randall, man. What I loved about season three was for the first couple of seasons, people had this idea that he was perfect, besides his social anxiety that he battles with and trying to make peace with always wanting to be perfect. But [this season], some people would consider some of his actions to be selfish in regards to placing his own job and what he thought was important above what was important for his wife. In my mind, I thought he was trying to do what was best for his family — but what I loved overall was people were upset, and I have no problem with people being upset.\n\nMy favorite scene or line of dialogue from this season was …\n\nWhen Tess comes out to her parents. I remember going into the writers room and telling [creator] Dan Fogelman, \"Man, I think we just did one of the most important scenes our show has ever done,\" because it was a pleasure and privilege to portray that level of grace with your child coming out to you. And then I’ll say, Susan [Kelechi Watson] and I talked about this when we were shooting it — when we went back in time on the episode arc to shoot Randall and Beth’s wedding, with my baggy tuxedo on and her very beautiful but simple wedding dress — when we shot it, Sue and I were both like, “Sue, I think we just got married.” And I really had to go home and tell my wife, “Ryan, don’t be mad, but I think I’m married to two people now.” She’s like, “I got you bro, whatever you gotta say.” But it was so meaningful and felt so real, and the extra who played the minister was a minister in real life, and we jumped the broom the same way my wife and I jumped the broom 12 years ago. I did this thing where I said, “I’m not going to look at you until we shoot the scene,” so I did crazy stuff like avert my eyes, close my eyes and not look her in the face as we would run lines with each other, and then I opened my eyes and saw her in this wedding dress, and I was like, “Oh my God, look at my beautiful wife.”\n\nWas there anyone from your show who wasn't recognized that you think should have been?\n\nI would’ve loved to see Susan get a nomination. I thought she was extraordinary and so much of last year was about the relationship between Randall and Beth. I’m so appreciative of the honor of being recognized, but it would’ve been doubly sweet if we got a chance to share in that night together. Not to take anything away from Mandy and Milo and for Sully [Chris Sullivan], it’s such a huge thing. I called him on the phone and he was like, “What the fuck?” But it was dope. We got seven acting nominations and we’re on network television and to be recognized, it’s cool for us to be continuously in this conversation, but if Sue had been in there that would’ve been great.\n\nBenicio Del Toro\n\nDo you have any rituals or music to help you get into the mind-set of your character?\n\nNot necessarily to get into his mind-set because I don't know what kind of music he would have been listening to or would make him who he was, but I'd listen to music for myself. We were on the set when the news came out that Tom Petty had passed away, so we started listening to Tom Petty.\n\nWhat does that do for you — clear your head so you can focus?\n\nYeah, it kind of relaxes me. Music can also pump you up for the next day of work. It gives you guts.\n\nWhat was one of your most challenging scenes?\n\nThe challenge was with what the writers and [director] Ben [Stiller] were trying to do. Usually with a bad criminal, when they look at themselves in the mirror, they don't really see the truth of who they are. Episode six was kind of like a mirror of truth for the audience, where the artist will show the truth about the character. The scripts, up to that point, were kind of showing the human side of my character. For the most part he’s a manipulator, and there are some lies here and there. It just becomes evil in episode six, and I thought the challenge was to play the human side with an edge, so that in episode six, when that truth comes out, it doesn't come out of nowhere.\n\nMy favorite scene or line of dialogue from the show was …\n\nPerhaps that scene when we get out of the manhole. That scene I thought was hard to shoot, but I think it worked within the episode. I was surprised, let me put it that way, that it worked and that people reacted to that scene. [The characters are] free, and they're basically trapped within themselves.\n\nThis is your first TV project in a long time. Do you think you'll do more TV work after this?\n\nWhen I first started, most of the TV movies were kind of B-movie versions. The support, creativity and budget were not at a high level. That has changed completely. When I got involved with this, Showtime was 100 percent committed to something very much like a movie, and the budget was like a movie budget and the support was completely like what I have experienced when it comes to movies, so basically it was like doing a long movie, and that's exciting for the actors and filmmakers. Showtime got really behind Ben's vision and the script that was, in many ways, very subtle. Times have changed, and, for me, there was no difference between shooting a movie and shooting Escape at Dannemora. My approach to it was not any different than when I work on a movie.\n\nBill Hader\n\nAll five of your main castmembers were nominated for Emmys. That's a unique conversation on nomination morning.\n\nOh yeah, I was really happy. With so much television on right now and so many great performances, to get singled out is a massive honor. But in my head I'm more just thinking, what happens next on the show?\n\nAny underappreciated actors that you want to make regulars in season three so they can get a nomination?\n\n(Laughs.) You don't want to say that because then it's not about their performance. Everyone we hired, read. Stephen, Henry, they all had to audition, and they were all the best people for the job. The nice thing about season two is that [now] they all kind of understand their characters better than we do, so they're telling us where the stuff needs to go, or saying \"I'm not sure NoHo Hank would do that\" or \"Sally would do this,\" and we'd make it a discussion. And also, I am fans of all of them, and as a fan you want to see new [dimensions], you know? I want to see NoHo Hank not be funny in a scene and just be hard-core like he was in the first episode in season two when he goes after Barry and says, \"I'm going to kill everybody if you don't do what I say.\" (Laughs.)\n\nAny particular reason you submitted the sixth episode, \"The Truth Has a Ring to It,\" for consideration?\n\nI don't really go back and watch them. I asked Alec and Alec said, \"I really like you in six.\" \"Oh, OK.\" I think Alec really liked the scene when Henry is talking to me and he is saying, \"[Sally's] husband was a violent person, you're not.\" I'm terrible at this stuff; I just leave it up to other people to decide about me.\n\nAs a good actor is it hard to play a bad actor?\n\nPeople ask me this a lot and I don't know the answer. We all have to do it on this show; you are just kind of projecting bad acting on each scene. And usually for Barry it is just being timid. It's hard to pinpoint. But I do remember Alec being very happy with my reaction to when Cousineau says, \"Good job\" [after Barry plays a scene with Sally]. I remember Alec going, \"Oh my God, that's so dark!\" He goes, \"because you are happy but you are also conflicted in a weird way because you had to use when you murdered his girlfriend to get that reaction.\"\n\nDo you know how many people Barry shot in the finale?\n\nNo. [Alec and I] had dinner the week after the last episode aired, and I said, \"I got to be honest: I don't know what happens next,\" and Alec went, \"Yeah, me neither.\" We said the same thing at the end of season one, too, so I don't know. So, when people call and they go, \"Hey, the Emmys!\" and everything, it's so nice and so gratifying and I am so happy that Anthony and Sarah and Stephen got nominated. That was the best part of our morning, you know. Usually the next thought after that subsides is, \"Jesus, I don't know what season three is!\" When you say Barry to me there is always lingering anxiety there.\n\nIf the show goes on for eight seasons at least Jessie will get her own Kill Bill episode.\n\nA lot of people have pitched ways on how the little girl comes back, and I think it makes Alec and me a little like, \"Well now we can't do that because people have thought of it!\" You might never see her or she might come back. I will probably put that on the whiteboard: \"Lily. What happened with her?\" What do you think? Where is she? Does she come back? Do we need her to come back? And it might not be until way down the road in another season when you go, \"If Lily were here that would be interesting.\"\n\nDid you have a favorite line of dialogue from this season that comes to mind?\n\nI liked when our actor Troy [Caylak], he plays this character Akhmal, said to Hank, \"If I suck balls then you're the king of suck-balls mountain!\" It was supposed to be, \"If I'm shit then you're the king of shit mountain,\" and Anthony Carrigan improvised \"suck balls,\" so Troy but had no choice but to substitute it.\n\nWho would you nominate from Barry that isn't nominated already?\n\nI would say Paula Huidobro our DP, she didn't get nominated and I thought she should have. She did an amazing job.\n\nKit Harington\n\nWhat were your initial thoughts when you learned the scope of Jon Snow's ending?\n\nI hadn't read the scripts for the final season until the table read. I wanted to hear them around the table, without having read anything first. I sat on a plane next to Emilia on the way to the read-through in Belfast, and she had read them already, and se was like, \"Shit, Kit. You are in for some surprises.\" That piqued my interest. (Laughs.) I didn't realize what was going to happen the whole way through until maybe half a page before Jon kills Dany. I remember my mouth dropping open and looking across Emilia at the table, who was slowly nodding as I went, \"No, no, no!\" It was a \"holy fuck\" moment, pardon my language. Jaw dropping. I was completely surprised by it, even though you can kind of see the path through the season of how it was getting there — and even the previous couple of seasons before that, once you can look back. But it was still a big shock to me.\n\nWhat do you remember about filming the final scene between Jon and Daenerys?\n\nWe felt a sense of responsibility over it. We shot the hell out of it. It was essentially a page and a half of dialogue, and we spent three weeks filming it. They wanted to shoot every conceivable angle, every way, to make sure they got it the way they wanted it. When you're shooting the same scene for two weeks and it's a page and a half, it becomes a long exercise in concentration. You have to remember the energy you're bringing in, every day, and making sure it's consistent. With a highly emotionally charged scene like that, it's quite a lot, for everyone — the crew, me and Emilia. It was tiring. It's one of the hardest things we filmed.\n\nHow did you come to terms with Jon's decision to assassinate Daenerys, and allowing yourself the ability to accept the choice?\n\nIt's that horrible conflict in a relationship: \"Do I stay or do I go?\" We've all been through it at some point … except this one involves a knife. (Laughs.) So, the stakes are even higher. But that's the way I looked at it: \"Do I leave my lover?\" It was the same kind of thing between Jon and Ygritte [Rose Leslie] earlier in the series, betraying someone he loves for the greater good. But what it really comes down to, the real crux of it, is the decision is made when she puts it between her and his family. Jon essentially sees it as Daenerys or Sansa and Arya, and that makes his mind up for him. He choose blood over, well, his other blood. But he chooses the people he has grown up with, the people his roots are with, the North. That's where his loyalties lie in the end. That's when he puts the knife in.\n\nFrom the start, at its heart, Game of Thrones is an exploration of family — what you're born into, what you can leave and what you can't help but keep. Jon Snow was a key avatar of those questions, given his origin as a \"bastard,\" and his role as both Stark and Targaryen. What do you think Jon's choice — killing Daenerys to protect the Starks — tells us about the series' key theme of family?\n\nIt was said a long time ago, and I agree with it, that Thrones really is about dysfunctional families. It's about mothers, brothers and sisters, but it's also about how far your blood will stretch in your decision making. That's the ultimate choice Jon is left with. He's faced with someone he loves as his lover — who he is related to — but his loyalty is with the people and the part of the world where his roots are, the people who raised him. As much as he was an outcast from that group as a bastard, and even though Jon became the legitimate heir to the throne, he will always be of the North. He'll always be a bastard of the North. He's always done the honorable thing, and Tyrion [Peter Dinklage] appeals to that: \"Do the honorable thing. Do the right thing. Do the hard thing, but do the right thing.\" At the end of it, it's beyond honor for Jon. It's his family.\n\nYour final scene doubles as the final scene of the series: Jon Snow leading the Free Folk back into the true North. How did you read that final moment?\n\nI loved it. When I read it, that bit really made me cry. What really made me cry was on the paper: \"End of Game of Thrones.\" But as far as an ending for Jon Snow, this character that I loved for so many years and had grown so close to, and had meant so much to me … seeing him go beyond the Wall back to something true, something honest, something pure with these people he was always told he belongs with — the Free Folk — it felt to me like he was finally free. Instead of being chained and sent to the Wall, it felt like he was set free. It was a really sweet ending. As much as he had done a horrible thing [in killing Daenerys], as much as he had felt that pain, the actual ending for him was finally being released.\n\nIn the spirit of pain, how painful was it to film the dragon-riding scenes this season, and how much of a different experience was it to film the sprawling battles of \"The Long Night\" as opposed to something like \"Battle of the Bastards\" in season six? Completely different animals?\n\nCompletely. I was on the back of that buck [the rig used for filming the dragon-riding scenes] for longer than we filmed the entire \"Battle of the Bastards.\" Emilia had been moaning about it for seasons, and I was like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. You have not been through the mud in Northern Ireland. A buck in a nice warm room? Boo hoo.\" But she was absolutely right. It was horrific. It's not acting at all. It is not acting, it never will be acting, and it is not what I'd signed up for. (Laughs.) But it looked great, right? It just felt horrible! It is very uncomfortable as a man.\n\nNot recommended?\n\nNot recommended, no. I don't think I can have children now. (Laughs.) I loved \"The Long Night.\" I loved working with [Miguel Sapochnik], one of my favorite directors I have ever worked with. As tough as it was, it was Thrones, man. It was Thrones! It was everything Thrones should have been. It's a full set built, hundreds of extras throwing everything they had into it, all of us as a big ensemble cast — I loved it. I hated it at the time, but I love it, looking back on it. I have some really fond memories of that whole experience.\n\nMany fans were shocked when Arya (Maisie Williams) killed the Night King (Vladimir Furdik) instead of Jon Snow. What was your reaction when you saw how it would play out?\n\nI was a bit pissed off, only because I wanted to kill the Night King! I think I felt like everyone else did, in that it had been set up for a long time, and then I didn't get to do it. But I was so happy for Maisie and Arya. I was secretly like, \"I wanted to do that!\" Especially because I love fighting with Vlad, who also played the White Walker I fought at Hardhome. I've never seen a better swordsman. But it was a really great twist, and it tied up Maisie's journey in a really beautiful way. Over the seasons, we've seen her build up these skills to become this hardened assassin, and she uses it all to kill our main antagonist.\n\nAny thoughts on the fan theory that Jon shouted Arya on and encouraged her to kill the Night King, or is it just flatly ridiculous?\n\nYeah, come on. What, the big man goes and tells the little girl to go and [do it]? No thanks. That's crap. She did it all on her own. It had nothing to do with Jon.\n\nFavorite line of dialogue of the season?\n\nIt's not mine, but it's when Jon and Sansa are talking about Daenerys. I say, \"She's not her father.\" Sansa responds: \"No, she's far prettier.\"\n\nDid you have any rituals to get into the mindset of Jon Snow while you were shooting — any music you would play before getting on set?\n\nNo, I think I used to back in seasons one and two. I would hype myself up into it. But in reality, like so much in Thrones, the art department does it for you. I'm not taking away from how I got into the character, but every day, I have these layers and layers of leather and costume on, and the weight of it would give me that feeling of the character. It's a serious answer to what's supposed to be a lighthearted question, I'm sure, but did I listen to any music? Yes: \"We Are Family\" by Chic.\n\nIs there a prop or costume from Thrones you wish you could have kept?\n\nI'm still hoping for my sword! But they don't seem to be sending it to me. I'm still waiting, let's put it that way way. I'm still waiting for my sword, HBO! When is it going to arrive?\n\nJared Harris\n\nYou've been asked a couple times about your memories of being in England in 1986 when the disaster happened, and how you recalled it being a fairly big story when Russia had to admit what had occurred, but that it also faded from the news pretty quickly despite the ongoing danger.\n\nI don't remember it being in the news a long time. I remember the cloud [of radiation], and I remember being very concerned about that but once the cloud had passed over it sort of faded from people's consciousness. What we weren't aware of is that it was continuing to spew toxic material up into the atmosphere. Depending on which way the wind was blowing, it was coming down on you. There were sporadic stories about the different attempts they were having to try and put it out. And then of course all of the alarmist theories. Because that movie The China Syndrome had come out there was this sort of theory that theoretically a runaway nuclear reactor could burn its way through its containment shield and burn its way into the Earth's core. In the absence of any information, people will make a lot of stuff up. I don't remember there being a lot of it on the news, but people were starting to spread around misinformation. There was a lot of talk about Nostradamus as well at the time, that he predicted this event, and suddenly there was a whole resurgence and interest in Nostradamus. People were buying their Nostradamus and reading it and coming up with all sorts of theories.\n\nYou've portrayed several real-life people — a few kings, a president — but is there anything different about portraying a real-life person who is not well-known? Like going forward, in many people's minds, Jared Harris' Valery Legasov will be inseparable from the real Valery Legasov.\n\nNot really. I suppose what you're asking is, do I feel an extra sense of responsibility since if you're playing John Lennon or Henry VIII — several versions of them have already been put out. Actually, interestingly enough, I felt the most responsibility when I was playing Ulysses S. Grant because the research I did on him, I realized how completely bastardized, misunderstood, mischaracterized, slandered he's been by historians through the ages. His reputation has been slaughtered, absolutely slaughtered largely, over the post-Civil War period, Reconstruction. You have to do the same work, you have to do the same research whenever you're playing a historical character. At the end of the day, you always come back to the script and the version of the character that you're telling is the version in the script that the writers and directors have decided upon telling. In this particular case, the Valery Legasov in the story we tell is accurate, it's authentic to his story. But in terms of his personality, I suspect it was different. Craig [Mazin, the creator] needed a different relationship. I needed to operate in contrast to Stellan [Skarsgard]'s character. I needed to occupy a different space to Stellan. Stellan represented a more traditional Soviet male, that sort of alpha, confident Russian character.\n\nWere you surprised at all how big the series got? It seemed to be appointment viewing for pretty much everyone.\n\nYou can't plan for that. You don't know that's going to happen. You don't know what the zeitgeist is going to be 18 months or two years from now when you're planning on making something or starting to shoot something. I think everyone was confident about the show, the material, the quality of it, the success of it, but in the way that it broke out and became this global phenomenon and global sensation that impacted so many people and became something that really doesn't happen that often anymore, which is a water cooler show. It took a long time for Game of Thrones for impact people in that way. It was several seasons into it before it had that kind of appeal across the board and impact and was part of the cultural conversation, in many many countries. So in that sense, it was a real surprise that it took off that way. That certainly wasn't an expectation of anybody when we started. When we put it out there, we knew it was good, but when saw that the numbers came in for the second weekend and they were bigger in the third weekend and suddenly it was being picked up in conversations and Twitter feeds in several countries and it had kind of become an international conversation.\n\nThere was that story about a Russian network announcing their own series on Chernobyl to \"counter the narrative\" or whatever.\n\nThat's the tail end of that conversation. The beginning part of that is that [our show] was incredibly well received in Russian media, by the Russian audience, by the Russian reviewers and critics. In fact, there was criticism of their own domestic filmmaking. The question was, why is it an American company, an American program showing so successfully what life was like under the old Soviet regime. I think that's the criticism that stung and that's where the state media stepped into the conversation and tried to roll back that narrative.\n\nI also recall a debate over whether it made the Soviet people look bad, which I didn't think it did at all.\n\nI never thought that it made them look bad. It made the Soviet state look bad, which of course is a completely different state than the Russian state as it currently exists — or supposedly. It happened in the Ukraine. The Ukrainians and Belarusians, they come out very well. They are rightfully lauded as making heroic sacrifices.\n\nWhat was your favorite line of dialogue?\n\n\"Why worry about something that's not going to happen?\" \"That's perfect, we should put that on our money.\"\n\nIs there a prop or costume you wish you could have kept from the set?\n\nDid you see the show?! One of the things you can definitely say about this show is Vanity Fair isn't going to do a Chernobyl fashion shoot. I quite often keep glasses from shows that I've done but I didn't keep any. I had the most uncomfortable pair of shoes, so not those. The suits, I look like an unmade bed. I kept a copy of the report, Shcherbina's report, in Russian, that had the section where in episode two, he realizes that something is much more seriously wrong with the accident than they realize. Before he goes into the Kremlin to meet Gorbachev for the first time. I kept that prop.\n\nI'm always fascinated by projects where everyone smokes because all the actors smoke differently, in the way that they use the cigarettes in their performances. How do you approach smoking as an actor?\n\nYou can't smoke real cigarettes on set, they don't allow you to do that. You have to smoke cloves, herbal cigarettes that taste disgusting. You struggle to keep them lit. If you're not puffing on them fairly regularly they go out in the middle of the scene and then you have to cut and do it again. That's why a lot of the time you see that people who are smoking seem like they're completely addicted because they're sucking on that cigarette as if their life depended on it, but it's actually just to keep the bloody thing lit throughout the take! If you know that you're smoking, sometimes directors really like that and DPs love it because it gives them an excuse to put the smoke in so you can see their lighting. Directors like if you light it as well because it's atmospheric and it gives them options. I became aware in my scenes with Emily [Watson] that because of the way our relationship is structured, which is that there's a sort of undercurrent of these are the two smartest people in the room, so there's a slight edge of competition between them, he initially feels a competitive edge about her presence and about her involvement and about her knowledge, so one of the things you do in those situations is you deflect. And you can deflect, you can disconnect with what somebody's saying by lighting a cigarette. But then of course I was becoming aware of that, so I tried not to do that too often because it's also distracting and it means that you can't be standing there watching somebody talk and then cut back to yourself and suddenly you've got a lit cigarette. You're imposing a certain condition upon the editor: They have to show you lighting that cigarette, otherwise where the hell did that cigarette come from? That also means you can be aware of it because it can be an ungenerous thing to do to suddenly lighting a cigarette during the important part of what the other person is doing or saying. You have to be conscious of things like that.\n\nHuh.\n\nYou didn't think of that! (Laughs.) You didn't think you were gonna get that answer when you asked that question!\n\nMilo Ventimiglia\n\nHow do you feel about your nomination?\n\nI feel proud of a group of people. I'm only one small part of the operation of Jack. The words that are written for Jack. The costumes and the hair and makeup, sets that are built that he has to occupy, and me just being the face guy of all of it, I'm very proud of the group of people that contribute to Jack.\n\nThe other good news is that your co-stars Mandy Moore and Chris Sullivan each received their first Emmy nominations.\n\nIt's really wonderful to see all of these talented artists getting recognized. Knowing Mandy was nominated and Michael Angarano was nominated, that is personally satisfying because I saw how beautiful their performances were last season, right there first-hand, I was in the front row for those performances. So, for me again, it's a proud moment. Those two performers, those two actors, but also the group of people that work on those characters.\n\nThis season, viewers got to see Jack's past in the Vietnam War and his complex relationship with his brother. How did you prepare for storyline?\n\nMy Dad's a Vietnam vet so I was never short of stories or experiences through my own dad, but I also spend a lot of time with veterans and for me, I'm always trying to honor the men that I play — like really be respectful of the actual lives that they live — so it was less about understanding the technicality of being in war and more about the emotional weight that’s left on those that wear the uniform and that was kind of the preparation. Beyond that, it's reading scripts, focus on the characters and being present in the moment.\n\nFrom the Jack in the first season to the Jack shown in this recent season, has your perspective on him changed?\n\nWorking backward is sometimes a difficult thing. We met Jack with his kids and his marriage, so to go back to a younger Jack, pre-Rebecca, pre-family, pre-any of that stuff, it was something that I was trying to put out of my mind. I had to go back to the formation of Jack and understanding only what he was raised with, not what he learned in regards to family life and Rebecca and the kids. I was out of sorts a little bit until I latched on to this fundamental quality about Jack, which is he's a protector. He has a lot under the surface. Jack never wants to burden anybody with any of his own shit. He never has, so that kind of constant thread that I'm able to hold on to of Jack through the decades is always something I can rely on.\n\nYou've played this character for three seasons now. What have you learned the most from portraying Jack?\n\nI don't know if he really taught me this but more reaffirmed it but slowing down life. Jack was only 54 when he died. I think he would've liked to have more time with his family. It's just appreciating when life will slow down and when it gets too fast trying to back off a little bit so that you can be present with those that you love.\n\nWhat would you hope that viewers get to see from Jack in future seasons?\n\nWe've seen him in war. We've seen him with his 10-year-olds. We've seen him with his teenagers. We've seen the man die. We've also seen him in new love. I still think there's a lot to see of Jack.\n\nDid you have any rituals to get into the mind-set of your character while you were shooting?\n\nJack is pretty simple at this point. Four years in, for me, a lot of it comes down to the hair and makeup and the wardrobe. Like if I'm in a goatee with some wide cords, in kind of a business look, I'm Jack in his 50s. When I got the mustache, I'm more lighthearted Jack in his 40s. When I got the beard, I'm Jack with the babies. So for me, I feel the ritual is the putting on of the character, and it all comes down to hair and makeup and wardrobe. for me.\n\nMy favorite scene or line of dialogue was …\n\nMy favorite line of dialogue of the season wasn't even my line. It might've been Mandy Moore's and it might've been the most simple line, but what she said in the meaning behind it meant the most. It was episode seven, they're sitting in a car and Rebecca had just been rejected by the music label and Jack had just gotten broken down and she's singing and she just says, \"Let's go home.\"\n\nIf you were personally handling the Emmys nominations, who would you pick from your show that didn’t get recognized this year?\n\nEvery single actor. Every single writer. Every single director. It still blows me away that our writing isn't recognized. Dan Fogelman is one of the best writers as is every writer that occupies that room. Ken Olin and his directing. I think because we don’t have dragons and we don't have big effects and a lot of that stuff we're looked past in directing. It's really a complex show. I think Ken Olin should always get recognized. Justin [Hartley], Chrissy [Metz], Susan [Kelechi Watson], everyone's delivering these amazing performances. Our hair and makeup departments. Our costumes. I wish we could give an award for grip and electric because we have a great crew. Our camera department. Our art department. At the same time, we all are recognized because the show itself got nominated. Everyone is a part of that and everyone can be proud.\n\nA version of this story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
