        "text": "What do Betty Francis (n√©e Draper) and Rick Grimes have in common? Neither character would be who s/he is without \"Love Actually.\"\n\n\"Mad Men\" star January Jones and \"Walking Dead\" leader Andrew Lincoln both appeared in the 2003 romantic comedy hit along with plenty of other now-familiar faces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore she was Betty, Jones was \"Love Actually's\" flirtatious Jeannie, who picked up British horndog Colin (Kris Marshall) at her local Wisconsin bar along with her roommates, one of which was played by \"Happy Endings\" and \"24\" star Elisha Cuthbert.\n\nAnd you can thank Lincoln for that memorable cue-card scene with Keira Knightley. Before he was fending off zombies, the actor played Mark, whose romantic gesture got him a kiss with his best friend's wife (Knightley). Keep it classy, Rick.\n\nSo which \"Game of Thrones\" newbie, \"Lost\" character everyone loved to hate and Showtime star also had roles in \"Love Actually\"?
