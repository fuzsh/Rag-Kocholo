        "text": "A while back we teased the possibility of actor Bill Hader and comedy mastermind Judd Apatow teaming up to do a slasher film. Well, the latest is in and according to CHUD, the project, now titled House of Joel, is moving along nicely with the Apatow gang and Universal on board. Hader co-wrote the script with SNL scribe Simon Rich, and Hader said he would play the titular character Joel himself. The premise of House of Joel surrounds the contemporary state of television violence and how violence in our culture is so prevalent. There aren't a lot of new details, but it's still something that should interest Apatow and Hader fans.\n\nBasically, the film is about a group of \"dipshit friends\" who are forced to deal with the the type of violence they've only seen on TV in their real lives and what they end up doing about it. Though details are still spotty at this point and the project doesn't have a solid timeline for production, if it should happen at all, just the inkling that Apatow is actively entertaining Hader's script is exciting. And it's sounding like the slasher genre will be seeing its fair share of subversive commentary in the near future, with both this film and Whedon's Cabin in the Woods on the horizon for 2010. Apatow, Hader, slasher -- excited?"
