        "text": "The show has always managed to ground its silliness within a quasi believable reality, but that was entirely too stupid for me to take seriously. Hoping next week reveals it was all a dream or something.\n\nIt was amusing in a \"what the fuck am I watching\" kind of way, but no it wasn't grounded in the established reality at all. That little girl was a feral ninja with supernatural abilities for fuck's sake and her dad was the Terminator.\n\nYeah, I realize I'm in the minority here, but this episode was a big \"What the hell?\" for me that, while fascinating and impressive in certain ways, I didn't totally like as an episode of Barry, a show I very much enjoy. I'd probably be more ok with it if it was just a silly, experimental one-off and Barry woke up at the end or something, but it seems everything we were shown actually happened? Given how over-the-top ridiculous and divorced from reality many of the events and character actions were, I'm not sure I'll be able to take anything in this show as seriously or be as invested going forward. Which is a mild bummer given once upon a time (in season 1) this was a show that deftly balanced laugh-out-loud comedy with incredibly weighty/impactful moments and situations in a way I loved.\n\nI don't think it's how it was written, but I read the surreal nature of the episode after the first fight as Barry's skewed interpretation of things after a couple huge blows to the head.\n\nKind of would have preferred that, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nYeah, I realize I'm in the minority here, but this episode was a big \"What the hell?\" for me that, while fascinating and impressive in certain ways, I didn't totally like as an episode of Barry, a show I very much enjoy.

It's always had a nice balance but that last episode was really so far into surreal/fantasy territory that it was kind of jarring. Way too many outlandish things to advance the story and get Barry out of a situation than they've ever needed before.\n\nI\n\nIt was inherently silly, but it's pretty much keeping in line with Barry's incredible luck to get out of jams lol\n\nI don't know, maybe so and I just need a rewatch, but it felt like a step beyond that. Like a combination of those incredible lucky things along with surreal absurdity all together to get to that point.\n\nLike it feels like the show that has that scene with Barry and his friend in the car is a totally different one than whoever last episode was.\n\nYet, it was damn entertaining. I dunno....\n\nI don't know, maybe so and I just need a rewatch, but it felt like a step beyond that.

There's no denying that this is the weirdest, most surreal example yet, but Barry has always been lucky as hell.\n\nAnyways, I had no issue with it. I see it as this show's Atlanta moment, where it just really expands what you thought the show was capable of doing within its universe."
