        "text": "The somewhat creepy scene in Love Actually where The Walking Dead’s Andrew Lincoln declares his love for Keira Knightley, via a series of cue cards, has already been the subject of a solid S.N.L. spoof starring Amy Adams. But the premise—like Love Actually itself—is something that continually pings on the pop culture radar this time of year—and this time, it’s Kate McKinnon’s Hillary Clinton taking the role of the wooer.\n\nIn this sketch, Cecily Strong (in full Knightley drag) plays an elector; Clinton, in a last-ditch effort to stop Donald Trump, has come to make the case for why Strong’s character should vote for someone—anyone—other than Trump on Monday, December 19. (This is a real thing, by the way. Some electors are vowing never to pick Trump. Here’s how you can write in to make your preference known.) How likely is it the electors won’t, in the end, pick Trump? Not very. But it’s a wonderful, romantic fantasy. And isn’t that, after all, what Love Actually is here for?\n\nThe Hunt for Hill\n\nHillary Clinton Emerges from the Woods and Dons Symbolic Purple Again\n\nThe former presidential candidate, current wandering folk hero, gave a cautionary speech against bogus news sites on Capitol Hill Thursday.\n\nreal talk\n\nTina Fey Knows the Real Reason Hillary Clinton Lost the Election\n\n“It’s the thing that people are afraid to talk about.”\n\nNews\n\nDonald Trump “Safe” After Shooting at Pennsylvania Rally, Suspected Shooter and Attendee Dead\n\nSecret Service agents rushed a bleeding Donald Trump from the stage at Butler, PA, on Saturday after shots were fired at a packed campaign rally.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Donald Trump Echoes Joe McCarthy\n\nMy grandfather was jailed in the Red Scare of the 1950s. Political writers could suffer a similar fate in a second Trump term.\n\nPolitics\n\nSupreme Court Immunity Decision Could Put Donald Trump “Above the Law”\n\nThe conservative majority’s ruling potentially paves the way for presidents to act with impunity, legal experts warn, as well as further delay the DOJ’s election subversion case against Trump. Justice Sotomayor dissented, “With fear for our democracy.”\n\nPolitics\n\nWhy the Christian Right Believes Donald Trump Is “Anointed by God”\n\nAuthor Katherine Stewart and sociologist Samuel Perry explain how the attempt on the former president’s life has only solidified his messiah-like mythos—and how Trump has turned Christian nationalists into his own electoral army.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Donald Trump Will Mold America “in the Image of a Dictatorship”\n\nReproductive rights crackdowns, mass deportations, and a fealty-based federal bureaucracy. The former president has disavowed Project 2025, but Vanity Fair’s Molly Jong-Fast and Jeff Sharlet say his prints are all over it.\n\nPolitics\n\nA Mind-Boggling Number of Voters Who Could Decide the Election Think Donald Trump—Yes, That Donald Trump—Is Better for Democracy Than Biden\n\nAs in, the Donald Trump who incited an insurrection because he couldn’t admit he lost the last election.\n\nPolitics\n\nJoe Biden Set All the Rules in the Debate—And Still Got Trounced by Donald Trump\n\nThe 81-year-old president stumbled, froze up, and fell for foolish back-and-forths, delivering a dismal showing that's caused some Democrats to reconsider his candidacy altogether."
