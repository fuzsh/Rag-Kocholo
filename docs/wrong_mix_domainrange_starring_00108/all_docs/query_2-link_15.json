        "text": "Richard Curtis, along with several cast members of the film, were featured in a ABC News special celebrating the movie's release nearly 20 years ago.\n\nLOADINGERROR LOADING\n\n“Love Actually” writer/director Richard Curtis has some regrets about his 2003 cult Christmas classic.\n\nDuring an ABC News special that premiered on Tuesday titled “The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later,” Curtis told Diane Sawyer he was discomfited by one aspect of the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid,” he said about the film, which has a primarily white cast and no LGBTQ couple storyline.\n\nDespite the movie’s lasting impact on viewers, its critics have also called out the power dynamics in some of the characters’ workplace relationships.\n\nCurtis appeared to address parts of the film that he called “out of date.”\n\n“There are things you’d change, but thank God society is changing,” he told Sawyer. “So my film is bound in some moments to feel out of date.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ABC News special also featured several cast members of the popular movie, including Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson and Olivia Olson.\n\nThe cast reflected on some of the film’s most memorable moments.\n\nGrant, who played a fictional British prime minister in one of the movie’s intertwined love stories, described his infamous dance scene to Sawyer as “the most excruciating scene ever committed to celluloid.”\n\nIn 2017, the cast reunited for a mini-sequel titled “Red Nose Day Actually” to support the British charity Comic Relief, which aims to fight poverty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
