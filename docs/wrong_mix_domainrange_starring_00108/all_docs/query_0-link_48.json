        "text": "by Brianna Zigler\n\nI was obsessed with this one guy in high school. I’m open to the possibility that he might read this essay – he tended to stalk my social media, or his friends did, or however my personal info got “magically” sent his way. Up until a few years ago, we were still involved with one another. My friends who read this will be rolling their eyes. I was ridiculous, I know. I hate to look back on who I was at that time. I was already in my twenties and still hung up on a high school boyfriend; fling; fuck buddy. But I was infatuated with him, and this persisted into college, and it persisted long after it should have already ended but, eventually, it did end. I vague-posted about him on my Tumblr a little over two years ago, back when I still had one. He messaged me on Facebook in response and accused me of slander and of still being obsessed with him. I explained that I had a boyfriend, and told him to have a blessed day.\n\nI’m getting off topic. There was a boy, and he was very sad. I don’t mean to sound glib when I describe him, but without exposing any details about his personal life I’ll only say he was a deeply unhappy person when I knew him. But he’s not the main focus of this essay. In fact, most of the guys I’ve been with have tended to be deeply unhappy people. I’m not sure why, and I haven’t ever thought too hard about it before. I don’t really like to assume too much about things I don’t quite understand enough myself, and I feel hesitant to deign to offer my perspective when some of these men from my past are people that I like and still keep in contact with. I’ve always just seen it as a tidbit I’d reveal to a therapist one day, and they’d explain to me why I tend to be attracted to these types of men, or why they seem to naturally gravitate towards me, and I’d say “ok” and it would keep me up that night.\n\nBut it all seemed to spill over from fictional stereotype into my personal life, into the real world. “You can’t just date normal guys, can you Brianna?” I had a friend once say to me, facetiously, in our high school cafeteria. I’ve not been with very many people; I get swept up in my emotions and settle into long-term commitments with ease – too easily – despite how fervently I always tell myself that I won’t once I break off another relationship. I form bonds with people quickly, and I nurture them when they manifest. I like when I connect with someone beneath the surface level, I like learning the deepest, darkest parts of another person; I like the feeling of being wanted, and of wanting back. I’m an emotional person by nature, although I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThere seem to be a plethora of reasons why one might attract dark, brooding, sad people, or be attracted to them in turn. These reasons range from what The Telegraph describes as a “primitive desire to find a mate who appears mentally strong, confident, and physically attractive,” to not liking yourself or having low self-esteem, to a desire to “save” someone, to finding unhappiness and vulnerability to be a form of passion; to being unhappy yourself. Or maybe it’s that I love too much, and “when a woman who loves too much meets a stable, caring, together man, she will get a subconscious vibe that she is not able to love him. Love for her is fixing. Love is a project.”\n\nI’ll admit, as a teenager I did derive a bit of an ego-boost from believing I could save a guy, while I languished over the lyrics to songs by Bright Eyes and Brand New, and mistook the intensity of my own teenage emotions to be some form of “wise-beyond-my-years” bullshit. There was a kind of passion I derived from embracing the throes of emotional instability. Why be with a happy person when the highs and lows of a sad one are just so much more…enthralling?\n\nI never intentionally sought these guys out, though – not even in TV and movies. But each time it happened, I said to myself, “Of course that guy’s the one I’m attracted to. Of course he’s sad. They’re always sad, aren’t they?” And with Barry Berkman, it just feels so palpable. If I’d had Barry during my high school years, I might have collapsed under the sheer weight of my own attraction to him, and somehow being played by Bill Hader just makes him that much more enticing. But Bill Hader being hot is nothing terribly new, and a simple Google search of “Bill Hader is hot” turns up articles, blog posts, and earnest Reddit threads for us to confirm with each other that, yes, Bill Hader is hot. We’re allowed to find Bill Hader hot now. To be fair, however, Bill Hader has always been hot – it’s just a lot clearer now that he’s playing the sad murder man.\n\nI find myself less agitated, more puzzled that my old habits have yet to die hard. I don’t go out of my way to find sad boys, but I seem to end up where I started time and time again, whether I’m sitting down to watch Legion or settling in with Under the Silver Lake. I’m still that wide-eyed and hopelessly romantic thirteen-year-old intent on fixing a guy with daddy issues, except now I’m reaching my mid-twenties. Once I’d fathomed just how immensely attracted I was to Barry, I realized how easily he fits into the rest of the pattern. Barry is just another cog in my endless sad boy machine. I pluck them out of TV and film like juicy berries, this never-ending smorgasbord of slender, occasionally-cigarette-smoking men harboring deep sadness, who just need someone like me to remind them that they’re beautiful, and that their lives have meaning – right?\n\nNo, of course not. And yet…when I watch Barry, I want to fuck him, and when he wrestles his trauma and the conflicting nature of his self with the good person he wants to become, I want to be the one to help him through it. I guess that’s what this all means, huh? Past and present me are forever linked by this childishly inherent desire to help sad men, even if it doesn’t always feel like a conscious thing. I’ve never gone after these men with any intention, not even way back when I was in the thick of my sad boy cravings and at peak teen angst intensity. It was never something I went after with a purpose, and yet I did relish in it when it came my way. It all just sort of happened. And it happened again. And again. Now, it just feels like an inevitability. I’m sure the therapist I’ll go to in a few years’ time will have more possible answers to all this. Some gravitational pull to do with the nature of my personality, or something about something or other that happened to me while I was growing up, or something about my family, or my very first relationship, which has truly seemed to color every single one after it. The first time I ever took a hit, and my body has been chasing that high.\n\nMaybe the moral of this self-indulgent story is that I watch too many movies and TV shows. Those intense periods of rollercoaster romance, scenarios I’ve envisioned in my head that play out like a montage sequence against the music blasting in my car, saying just the right thing at the right moment and everything falls into place – none of it is real, but it all seems like the ideal way for my life to be. I was raised on the melodrama of cinema and screens, or maybe it’s that I have a savior complex, or maybe I just fucking hate myself. Barry hates himself, too. “We are magnetized towards the individuals that ‘fit’ our view for what love is,” writes the author Haley’s Comment. “We chase people where we can repeat relationship roles we’re accustomed to.”\n\n“Everything’s so good right now,” Barry says calmly, but desperately, with both his hands in the air, gun pointed at his chest, in the season one finale of Barry. “I’m a good person now.” His hair is slightly disheveled, his eyes are wide, he’s scared but steadfast. He looks beautiful. In a perfect world, Barry would have the life he dreams of and the “good person” badge of honor that he wants emblazoned on his body for the world to see. But then there would be no Barry, and then there would be no reason to fall in love with him. We want the drama and the desperation, the vulnerability that comes with failure and the thrill of emotional highs and lows as Barry’s perfect life is pulled constantly out of reach. We love the excitement of a sad, hot man burdened by a life of crime. I don’t want Barry to be happy, because I want to be the one to save him.\n\nSo, I fall in love with Barry Berkman again and again – I’ve been doing it for over a decade now. Movies and television bleed into my life and my life bleeds back. It all just comes so easily."
