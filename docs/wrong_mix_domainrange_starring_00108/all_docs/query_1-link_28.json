You (mumbles).\n\nAfter a couple of takes of that,\n\nGreg came over to me and he went,\n\nThis guy's your best friend,\n\nand he just ran out on you.\n\nAnd I went, Okay, got it.\n\nAnd that's the take that's in the movie,\n\nwhere I'm like, Why did you do that?\n\nLike, why would you run off like that, man?\n\nLike, why'd you do that?\n\nAnd it just became infinitely funnier.\n\nI remember, I started doing that,\n\nand the boom started shaking, 'cause the boom guy\n\nstarted laughing, like, everyone started laughing,\n\n'cause it was like, just so real.\n\nAnd that taught me a big lesson.\n\n(rock music)\n\nDave in Hot Rod is based on\n\na guy I went to high school with.\n\nAnd the story in that\n\nabout him being on acid, and a piece of metal\n\nflying into his eye, that happened to my friend.\n\nI think he took magic mushrooms,\n\nand he went into his,\n\nhis garage, and started soldering stuff,\n\nand a piece of metal flew into his eye,\n\nand he called us, and was like,\n\nHey, can you guys take me to the emergency room?\n\nApparently, someone told me he saw the movie,\n\nand then said, Wow, that was nuts.\n\nYou know that scene where the piece of metal,\n\nthe guy's trippin' balls, and the piece\n\nof metal flies into his eye?\n\nYou know that happened to me once?\n\n(laughs)\n\nIt's like, yeah, it's based on you, dumb ass.\n\nI'm making him sound like he's not smart.\n\nHe's actually brilliant, but he's just like,\n\nsuch an Oklahoma dude.\n\nNow, he's like a professor.\n\nI don't think he wants his students to know\n\nthat that's based on him. (laughs)\n\n(rock music)\n\nI auditioned for Tropic Thunder, and there's a,\n\nan executive\n\nwho works at Paramount,\n\nwho I could do a good impression of.\n\nAnd I did the reading a couple times,\n\nand then I told Ben Stiller, I'm like,\n\nYou know I can do an impression of this guy.\n\nAnd he said, Well, what's that?\n\nAnd I was like, I just want you all to know\n\nthat we're having such a good time here.\n\nAnd I remember he said, this executive's on set,\n\nand he goes, Do you know why they\n\nmake the sandwiches so fresh?\n\nAnd then he turned to the guy, who made the sandwich,\n\nhe goes, Why are these sandwiches so fresh?\n\nAnd the guy, kind of awkwardly, was like,\n\nI made them this morning.\n\nHe goes, Because he made them this morning.\n\nAnd I did that in front of Ben,\n\nand he laughed really hard.\n\nAnd I went, oh cool, all right.\n\nWell, and I didn't read the script,\n\nI literally, what I just did, I did that.\n\nAnd he knew the guy, and he started laughing.\n\nAnd then, a couple days later, my agent called me,\n\nand he was like, Yeah, you got the part.\n\nAnd then, we had the table read for that.\n\nAnd the table read for Tropic Thunder was insane.\n\nIt was like, that whole group,\n\nand then, Tom Cruise walked in.\n\nAnd Tom Cruise, because I had a lot of scenes with him,\n\nhe sat down next to me,\n\nand\n\nhe was awesome.\n\nYou know what, when he had all the makeup on\n\nand stuff, it was really easy to chat with him,\n\nbecause you forgot it was Tom Cruise.\n\nAnd he was just going so crazy and over the top in it\n\nthat it didn't feel like Tom Cruise,\n\nbut then we would sit in between\n\nset-ups and I mean, he was so generous,\n\nI mean, I was ask, I go, you know,\n\nRisky Business is such a great movie, man.\n\nAnd he goes, Oh, thank you, thank you.\n\nYeah man, when we did that, it was just,\n\nyou know, and he would really give you\n\nreally great stories that had great advice in them.\n\nIn the full Les Grossman thing, and I would just\n\nbe chatting with him, and it would be fine.\n\nAnd then, it wasn't until the premiere\n\nof the movie, that again, I saw him without\n\nthe makeup on, and he was like,\n\nHey, man!\n\nAnd I was like, oh God, right, you're Tom Cruise.\n\nAnd I was just, yeah, he's just,\n\nyou know, he's a giant movie star.\n\n(rock music)\n\nThat, that's right, yeah, I'm in the second\n\nStar Trek movie, I'm a voice of a ship.\n\nJJ called and said, Hey, man.\n\nYou wanna do a voice for a ship in the new Star Trek?\n\nAnd I went, Sure.\n\nAnd he goes, Can you do it like, today?\n\nI go, Well, I'm in Las Vegas.\n\nHe's like, Let me get into this.\n\nAnd then, I just got a call going,\n\nA car's picking you up to take you to this little\n\nrecording studio in Vegas.\n\nAnd I went in, and I did it like,\n\nthree times, and then left.\n\nAnd then, a bunch of SNL people were watching\n\nthe movie, and they all went, Ah, there's Bill!\n\n(laughs)\n\nI wouldn't have noticed me, but they were like,\n\nAh, there's Bill!\n\nThat's the weird thing, you do these things,\n\nand you do them, they're so fast,\n\nI don't, I've watched things that I've done\n\nvoices in, and I fully forgot I was in it.\n\n'Cause I have three small children,\n\nand we'll watch movies, and then,\n\nsuddenly, my voice pops up in it.\n\nLike, Ice Age Three or something, I'm a gazelle,\n\nand it's like, Hey, and I'm like,\n\nWhen the hell did I do this? (laughs)\n\nThey think it's embarrassing.\n\nThey think it's terrible.\n\nThey don't like it.\n\nThey're like, Ugh.\n\nThat's embarrassing.\n\nBut I mean, I would be embarrassed.\n\nThat's the thing I always say.\n\nIt's like if I was watching Star Wars,\n\nand my dad showed up on the Millennium Falcon,\n\nI'd be like, This blows.\n\nHey, everybody!\n\nHey guys, how's it going, hey, what's happening?\n\nYou guys wanna go, hey, Billy would love it\n\nif you guys went to warp speed, or whatever you call it.\n\nLike, aw Jesus.\n\nYeah, it's embarrassing.\n\n(rock music)\n\nYeah, the BB-8 voice is very,\n\nthat's like JJ Abrams being just a nice guy,\n\nand being like, I'm gonna give you like,\n\na fanboy dream of having your credits in a Star Wars movie.\n\nI just know, I recorded sounds, and it didn't really work.\n\nLike, I was going like (nasal mumbles)\n\nI was doing all these, and I would watch\n\nthe movie, so I got to watch the Star Wars movie\n\nseven months before it came out,\n\nin a little booth, watching it on a little monitor,\n\nand I would just do ADR for any time BB-8 came up.\n\nAnd I'd go, (nasal mumbles)\n\nand I would just do these things,\n\nand it didn't seem right.\n\nAnd I was like, well maybe Gary Rydstrom was like,\n\nwell, maybe we can manipulate it, and do stuff with it.\n\nIt wasn't working.\n\nSo, ah well.\n\nI got to see the movie early.\n\nThat's cool.\n\nAnd then, in November, the movie came out in December,\n\nin November, JJ called me and said,\n\nWe figured it out.\n\nIt's this talk box like the\n\nPeter Frampton, the Peter Frampton like, wow-wow,\n\nyou know like, and then,\n\nand he hooked it to this app on his iPad.\n\nSo, what BB-8 is is me in the first movie,\n\nI don't know what they did in the other movies,\n\nI didn't work on the other movies,\n\nbut it's just me with this,\n\nthis talk box, going (squeaks tones)\n\nand I'm just doing that.\n\nAnd JJ and the guys are manipulating it as I'm doing it.\n\nAnd it took maybe an hour.\n\nAnd I get asked about it, and now I sign\n\npictures of BB-8 everywhere.\n\nAnd now, it's like this big thing,\n\nand I did it in all of an hour.\n\n(rock music)\n\nThe Grey Gardens episode,\n\nthat was Seth Meyers's idea, and he said,\n\nWhat if you guys did Gray Gardens,\n\nand I remember, to be honest,\n\nFred and I were a bit, we didn't want to do it,\n\n'cause it was us dressing in drag,\n\nand we were like, You know, there's a lot\n\nof funny women out there, and I just\n\ndressing in drag feels kind of like,\n\nanother time, I just don't like it.\n\nLike, I love Monty Python, I love Kids in the Hall,\n\nbut anytime they're dressed in drag,\n\nit always feels like a little out of step.\n\nIt just doesn't hold up or something.\n\nAnd so, we didn't want to do it.\n\nAnd then the irony was, he just persisted,\n\nand was like, You guys are the\n\nonly two people on the show.\n\nLike, no one's gonna call you out on this.\n\nJust go do it.\n\nAnd so we did it, and no one gave a shit.\n\n(laughs) It's the one that everyone knows.\n\nSo clearly, Seth was right.\n\n(rock music)\n\nBarry's very different than anything I've ever done.\n\nHe's kind of a,\n\nhe's not necessarily a cipher, but he,\n\nyou know, he's kind of a new soul.\n\nYou know, he doesn't, he's kind of experiencing\n\nL.A., and all these people\n\nand he's trying to find a community,\n\nand he's trying to get in touch with like,\n\nwhat's wrong with him,\n\n'cause he knows he's murdered all these people,\n\nand he knows it's, that's wrong,\n\nbut he can't\n\nyou know, he can't figure it out,\n\nand he can't really even like,\n\nfind a way to talk about it.\n\nHe can't even verbalize it.\n\nYou know, this idea that he works in the shadows,\n\nand lives in the shadows,\n\nbut he wants to be in the spotlight,\n\nthere's a funny conflict there.\n\nSo, we decided to pitch it to HBO,\n\nand again, we said we want to play it very straight.\n\nWe don't want it to be, it's not broad or anything.\n\nAnd HBO, the people at HBO had seen me\n\nin a movie called Skeleton Twins,\n\nand they said, Oh, we really liked Skeleton Twins,\n\nand we liked your acting in that, so yeah.\n\n(rock music)\n\nI would just go do table reads for dramas,\n\nbecause no one thought of me in that way,\n\nand I wanted to do that kind of work,\n\nand so I did a table read for this drama,\n\nand the casting director, Avy Kaufman,\n\nsaw me and really liked me.\n\nSo, when she was casting Skeleton Twins,\n\nyou know, they were looking at more,\n\nkind of, dramatic actors, and she said,\n\nYou know who's really good,\n\nis, you know, who would be really good is,\n\nyou know, me, and so I had this meeting with him,\n\nand he was like, Aren't you the guy who just does\n\nyou know, you do Stefon, you know, and all that.\n\nAnd, No, I could\n\nwork with you on the character,\n\nand the idea was that, him being gay isn't,\n\nhe's out and proud, it has nothing to do,\n\nhe's depressed, and I related to the idea\n\nof like, no one's told you you're good at something.\n\nYou know?\n\nYou move out to L.A., you get away from your home town,\n\nand there was a part of that Milo character,\n\nthat I could have been that, if just like,\n\none or two things went wrong, I would have been\n\nright back home, and pissed off, and you know.\n\nAnd I related to those feelings, and so,\n\nI think we saw the character the same way,\n\nwhich is like, you know, play him out,\n\nand play, you know, he can be flamboyant,\n\nand not, there always seemed to be a thing of like,\n\nyou know, Craig and I talked about like,\n\nDon't, people don't want to play them too flamboyant,\n\nespecially straight actors, 'cause they don't\n\nwanna seem like they're doing a caricature, or whatever.\n\nAnd I get that.\n\nBut Craig and I were saying,\n\nYeah, we know plenty of gay friends who are out,\n\nand very flamboyant, and like, just play it that way.\n\nAnd the fact that he gave me so much,\n\nhe had so much confidence in me,\n\nmeant a lot.\n\nAnd then, to get to work with Kristen in that way\n\nwas fantastic, 'cause it just was so,\n\nwe had eight years of\n\nexperience together, so there was no acting.\n\nIt was just, we were just reacting off each other\n\nand it was,\n\nit was a blast.\n\n(rock music)\n\nWell, the one everyone loved was Stefon.\n\nThat was the one everyone talked\n\nabout the most, which was a blast.\n\nThat was always fun to do.\n\nThat was based on a barista in Chelsea,\n\nwho actually turned out to be friends\n\nwith Kate McKinnon after the fact, which is funny.\n\nHe didn't talk like that or really dress like that,\n\nit was just this attitude he had\n\nand then, John Mulaney had a character\n\nthat he would kind of do the voice of,\n\nand we just kind of brought them together.\n\nA lot of Stefon is John Mulaney.\n\nHe deserves a lot of credit for that character.\n\nI mean, so much of the language\n\nof that character is John Mulaney.\n\n(rock music)\n\nIf I have a favorite role, they're all so different.\n\nI just like that everything's so different, I hope so.\n\nYou know, and just to continue doing that.\n\nYou know, there's like, little moments,\n\nwhere you have like a benchmark, you know,\n\nwhere you felt like, oh man, I was so loose\n\non Superbad, and that was a lot of fun,\n\nor the chance to get to do something like Skeleton Twins,\n\nwhich was so different, and then, Barry,\n\nwhich is its own different thing.\n\nAnd it's just wanting to be able to swerve like that.\n\nThat's my biggest hope.\n\nRight, thanks for hearing me natter on about my career.\n\n(laughs) Hope you enjoyed yourself.\n\nPleee!"
