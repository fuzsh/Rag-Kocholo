        "text": "I love Bill Hader. I’ve loved him for a long time.\n\nBill is the type of actor you hope would be successful, but you know that it’s more than likely he won’t be. He was a hilarious cast member on Saturday Night Live for many years. In each of his skits, however, he was the supporting player. With the exception of Stefon, Bill never landed the skit that made him an SNL star.\n\nMany of the people who went from SNL to the movies had a signature skit that they could bring back week after week so people could remember who they were and ask, “Who plays that character?” This was the path for people like Adam Sandler, Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg, Bill Murray, and to an extent, Will Ferrell. Bill Hader was like Phil Hartman. The best supporting cast member the team had to offer.\n\nBill took this skill to the movies long before his SNL days were over. His first prominent movie role was being funny next to Seth Rogen in Superbad. Next he was the straight man convincing a funnier Jason Segel to go to Hawaii to forget about Kristen Bell. He played similar almost funny characters in Tropic Thunder, Adventureland, and Paul.\n\nThe first time the movies saw Bill Hader be funny completely on his own was in Pineapple Express. He got a microphone, a room, and a joint, and was told, “Be funny.” It’s a great scene, but it gets lost because it’s in a movie that contains a lot of great moments, and it’s easy to forget because it occurs at the very very beginning.\n\nOther than that, we’ve seen Bill Hader be funny in a lot of skits where he impersonates real people real well, compliments an ensemble skit, or makes a cameo appearance in films where only people who pay attention to the entertainment industry get the joke.\n\nFast forward to 2013. Bill Hader makes his final appearance as an SNL cast member. Unlike other SNL alums of the 2005-onward era, he walks away to an uncertain future. Andy Samberg had Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Fred Armisen had Portlandia, Amy Poehler had Parks and Recreation, and Seth Meyers left for his own talk show.\n\nJonah Hill joked at the Roast of James Franco that Bill Hader’s next venture was a T-Mobile commercial. It was true. There did not appear to be a Bill Hader venture on the horizon. He was always destined to get voice acting work, and he found some. Stints on Bob’s Burger’s, South Park, The Awesomes fill out his 2013-2014 IMDb page with a lot of cameos and small roles. The exception to the rule was The Skeleton Twins.\n\nThe Skeleton Twins is one of the biggest good movies turned great due to the acting. The movie itself was not a revolutionary picture. It’s a sweet story about a brother-sister relationship not often shown on film. There are a few great moments, but unlike other Indie darlings it doesn’t have a ‘wow’ moment to vault it into Oscar contention or garner much box-office success. The reason it’s talked about is because of Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig; two comedic actors who get to flex their dramatic muscles.\n\nKristen Wiig got to prove to the Hollywood world that she could act in a drama. I would argue she did it better in her earlier dramedy, Friends With Kids. Kristen already had box-office success to her credit. For Bill Hader, I think the biggest victory was that he gets to shine in this movie.\n\nBill Hader has the meatiest character in the movie. His character, Milo, and Kristen’s character, Maggie, are the only two with any real depth, so it’s not a heavy competition. But compared to Maggie, his character feels more unique. His circumstances growing up were a little heavier, and his character’s reactions to the world are far more interesting. Maggie is often depressed and it shows. Milo responds to everything by dismissing it with sarcasm. This response is interesting. The audience is left to interpret how he’s feeling in contrast to Maggie who wears her emotions on her sleeve. The film is really more a Bill Hader movie where Kristen Wiig is brought along for the ride. Neither one got the major awards to show for their work, but that’s to be expected.\n\nWhere is Bill Hader’s career after The Skeleton Twins? He can be the first guest on a major talk show. He can be billed first on a poster with a more successful budding star in Kristen Wiig. He could sell a movie without depending on the additional star power of the knockoff Wilson brother, and the yearly Emmy winner Ty Burrell from television.\n\nFastforward to 2015. Amy Schumer is the next Louie C.K. She’s an extremely popular stand-up comedian that everyone knows, and most people either love or are offended by. She gets to do whatever she wants for a while because Hollywood wants to see if it’ll work. It’s a calculated risk that pays off if the comedian has enough talent. So she writes a screenplay that’s mainly autobiographical. It’s all about her. There’s room for a few funny cameos and maybe even a side character that’ll get a laugh, but it’s an Amy Schumer movie, and no one would question that.\n\nIn Trainwreck there is a character by the name of Aaron. What’s Aaron like? He’s a nice guy doctor who appreciates Amy for who she is and shows up to be the obvious love interest from the start.\n\nWho should play Aaron? Well you have a lot of obvious options. James Marsden is a nice guy who is good looking who could do a pretty good job at the role. It’s the type of role he’s played before. You could look at a Jude Law or a Colin Farrell type, but they’re too interesting and you don’t want someone who is distinctly more famous than Amy Schumer.\n\nAnother great choice would be to pluck a TV star who has some name recognition and let them take the back seat to Amy Schumer’s antics. Guys like Max Greenfield or Joel McHale may come to mind. But between Schumer and Judd Apatow, someone made the genius move of hiring Bill Hader for the part.\n\nThe immediate knock on this casting is that Bill Hader lacks the sex appeal of any of the previous candidates. For all purposes this is a romantic comedy, and general audiences like attractive people to look at. Bill Hader is a fine looking guy, but he’s not Hollywood handsome. He also doesn’t have the name recognition, or even really the face recognition that typical female audiences would get from the aforementioned men. Did you know who Max Greenfield was without looking it up? If you don’t and you haven’t yet, he’s the guy from New Girl that isn’t Jake Johnson. You may not know his name, but you know who he is.\n\nBut why Hader? And why did it work?\n\nAaron is not a well-written character. If I were to guess, I would say that Judd Apatow knew that the minute he read the script. He’s the kind of character that audiences would complain about if the genders were flipped and Aaron were female (presumably Erin, but that’s besides the point). It’s for all of these reasons that Bill Hader is perfect.\n\nTake a look at his resume. Other than Stefon or Milo all of his greatest hits were being interesting in moments where you wouldn’t expect him to be. The cops in Superbad are not that funny other than being inept. Yet actors like Seth Rogen and Bill Hader provide such an earnest quality to their performances that the audience is able to look past the fact that their characters are traditional dumb guys. It’s easy to overlook that his role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a guy who says expository dialogue. Look again to the Roast of James Franco where someone joked that Bill Hader was a perfect, “Best friend’s best friend guy,” and that after he said his few key lines he should, “Shut the fuck up for the rest of the movie.” It was actually Bill Hader who made the remark.\n\nBill is great in each of these roles though. And he might be the best part of Trainwreck. There is an amazing moment of acting in this movie. Aaron did not get much sleep and is about to do an operation on Amar’e Stoudemire. Any other actor would play up the tired part of this moment. Maybe make a few yawns, blink too many times, and slur their words. I can even picture this scene with James Marsden perfectly, and it’s awful (even though I really like Marsden).\n\nThis moment is perfect because it’s Bill Hader. It feels both authentic and funny. His character bites the cap off of a pen and struggles to spit it onto the ground. The cap drips out of Bill’s mouth in this scene. He actually looks and sounds like a tired person looks and sounds. There’s an old tip about how to act drunk, and it’s to act like you’re trying to prove to everyone that you’re not drunk. That’s what a drunk person does when they are drunk. That’s what Bill Hader is doing in this scene. You can feel his character trying to climb this mountain. He wants to do the surgery so bad, and you can see a real struggle in the moment.\n\nFunny enough, I don’t know if I liked Trainwreck. I liked Amy Schumer and Bill Hader in it. I think it used it’s cameos properly. I just thought that Amy may have toned down the Amy Schumer humor near the end. She wrote something that felt like Schumer humor was sprinkled over, rather than the driving force behind each scene. Parts of the movie feel rom-com formulaic, and that’s just not Amy Schumer’s style. I almost hope that the studios were responsible for these changes because Amy feels like she’d be bold enough to not fall into typical rom-com formulas because she has to.\n\nAmy made out well after Trainwreck. The film was met with a perfect blend of critical praise and commercial success, and her name was written all over the movie. But now what happens to Bill?\n\nIf no one in this movie were famous and you had to make a poster for the movie, you’d probably make the same one that they used, only you’d make two changes. One, you’d let all of Bill Hader’s face be on the poster, and you’d probably put his name on it. He’s amazing in the movie, and his performance should be a selling point. But because this movie has context and it is an Amy Schumer passion project, his name as a selling point is pushed to the wayside. LeBron James and John Cena get as much screen time in the trailers as Bill Hader, but Bill is in the movie nearly 3-4 times as much as either of them. In a movie that may have made a star out of Amy Schumer, Bill Hader may not get the same shot.\n\nComedies that make stars out of their almost famous leads happen all of the time. In 2004 when Anchorman came out, it was billed as a Will Ferrell movie, and it made a star out of Will Ferrell. The irony is that Will Ferrell is very similar to Bill Hader. Both were the All-Star males of their SNL eras, neither man has a typical leading man look, and both played hilarious side-characters in movies in their first few years after SNL. But Will landed an Anchorman. Bill still needs his.\n\nAfter Anchorman’s release, two of the other actors in the movie became stars on their own; Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Rudd had been around for a while and may have been heading that direction on his own. Steve became a household name on The Office, and had his own Anchorman/Trainwreck role in The 40-Year Old Virgin.\n\nThe point of this entire blog is this; I hope that Bill Hader gets one of these movies. He’s such a good actor. From what I understand he’s an incredibly nice guy. People enjoy him in the movies he’s been in. He doesn’t have the household name recognition to sell a movie like this on his own yet, but he is headed in the right direction. A couple more Trainwreck-sized roles and he should be cleared for launch.\n\nThe difference between Bill Hader and many of the comedians whose legacy he could follow is that he really doesn’t have a consistent on screen persona. Will Ferrell is the guy with a little more professional success than his skills imply. Steve Carell is the likable everyman who could be doing a little more than he is with his life right now. Amy Schumer is a little too crass to make it to the big time. Seth Rogen is the lovable schlub who means well. And of course Adam Sandler is the guy who never grew up.\n\nBill Hader has a much larger range than these actors, save for maybe Carell. Someone like Will Ferrell may have already peaked, and may not have any more schtick to offer the movies. Bill Hader has a seemingly unlimited range of characters he could legitimately play.\n\nPicture him in Zach Galifianakis’s role in Birdman. Or Paul Rudd’s in Knocked Up. Of course he has physical limitations as an actor. He probably shouldn’t play a superhero, and is limited to lanky tall white man characters. The good news is there are a seemingly endless number of those parts floating around.\n\nHe’s in two ensemble casts of upcoming movies, including a Spielberg directed Roald Dahl adaptation. He’s got his critically acclaimed mini-series Documentary Now that he makes with his SNL buddies. He’s making a guest spot on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It doesn’t look like there’s anything too exciting on the immediate horizon.\n\nBill Hader could be a legitimate Hollywood A-Lister. He has the talent to be the lead in a box-office breaking comedy, add so much to a comedy with a lot of stars, and branch out into more dramatic roles. As an audience member I hope I get to see what those movies would look like. Because I love Bill Hader."
