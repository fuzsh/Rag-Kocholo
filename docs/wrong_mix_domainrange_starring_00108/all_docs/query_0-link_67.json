I actually told my best friend years ago that you were my dream girl, and I know it sounds crazy, but I want you to be my girlfriend.’”\n\n“That’s how cheap and lazy men have become,” she said in jest. “When a fellow man commits any act of kindness, any romantic gesture, it must be a symptom of an undiagnosed mental illness.”"
