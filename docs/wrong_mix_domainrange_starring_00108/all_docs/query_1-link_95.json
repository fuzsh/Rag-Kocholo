They share two daughters, Mari and Nikki.\n\nBill shares three daughters — Hannah, Harper and Haley — with ex-wife Margaret Carey. He has since been romantically linked to actors Anna Kendrick and Rachel Bilson.\n\nAli and Bill had fans cheering on their relationship when they shared another kiss after her win at the Critics; Choice Awards on Sunday, and then again at the Emmys on Monday night.\n\nShe won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her role in the Netflix series Beef, making her the first Asian American woman to win in the category.\n\nShe also made history at the Golden Globes, becoming the first winner of Asian descent to win in the Best Actress in a Limited Series category for Beef."
