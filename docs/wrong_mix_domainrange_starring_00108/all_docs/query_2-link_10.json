        "text": "From SNL to his new movie, The Skeleton Twins, he's learned a lot along the way.\n\nBill Hader stopped by AOL offices to discuss his new movie, The Skeleton Twins, which co-stars one of his favorite people, Kristen Wiig.\n\n1. On what he thinks makes a good director: \"Good directors give short and specific instructions to their actors.\"\n\n2. On improvising during filming: \"The director told Kristen and I to 'make each other laugh.'\"\n\n3. On improvising during the more serious scenes during the movie: \"They wrote it so beautifully that we didn't want to mess with it at all.\"\n\n4. On becoming his character, Milo, a gay man: \"My director (Craig Johnson) told me: 'Don't try to iron out the gayness of this guy.' I was afraid of being too stereotypical with my actions.\"\n\n5. On the lip-sync scene in The Skeleton Twins: \"It was originally going to be 'Hold On,' but then a little movie called Bridesmaids came along...\"\n\nIf you don't know the scene from Kristen's movie, watch it here:\n\nAnd watch what it turned into here:\n\n6. On Grantland's best SNL cast member bracket: \"Women were always the quarterbacks and doing the best work.\"\n\n7. On his time as a PA for Empire of Dreams: The Story of the 'Star Wars' Trilogy: \"It seemed so rinkidink as a film!\"\n\n8. On playing bass guitar during a sketch where Dave Grohl played drums, his favorite memory from SNL: \"I was on a high for like two months!\"\n\n9. On where Stefon is now: \"Asleep on the corner of 23rd and 9th.\"\n\nIs this true, Stefon?\n\nThanks for being awesome, Bill! In addition to his hysterical characters on SNL, audiences can now enjoy a more dramatic performance from both him and Kristen in The Skeleton Twins.\n\nShare This Article"
