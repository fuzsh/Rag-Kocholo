        "text": "This is another TV review as I haven’t watched any good films this week, but I have binged what is now one of my favourite shows, namely Barry. Why did I post this for Spectre? Spectre is just like boring bad, not fun bad.\n\nBarry stars Bill Hader as an Afghan War vet turned hitman who takes a job in LA and then decides to become an actor. That premise alone is reason to watch the show, but it manages to keep you hooked with likeable characters and a well-crafted story.\n\nThe actors are all on their A game. Henry Winkler brings levity to what could be a really dark show and Anthony Carrigan is the funniest character I have seen in any piece of media.\n\nWhat initially attracted me to this show was Bill Hader. He is a really good comedian and writer. I don’t think the show would work without Hader at the rains. The writing is well done, and Hader manages to portray a deeply human character.\n\nIf you’re a student of film or drama this a pretty good show to watch in one sitting. Each episode is around 20 – 30 minutes long and it provides some insight into the world of theatre and acting.\n\nIf I had to say a bad word to this show it would be how they ended season 1. Throughout the show we get multiple dream like flash forwards which work in the context of the story, it’s Barry imagining how he wanted his life to go. However, season 1 ends with one of these flash forwards coming true which then leaves you questioning whether what you’re seeing actually happens and it’s just a bit messy in an otherwise well written show.\n\nIf you haven’t watched Barry do it. The second season still hasn’t aired fully and it’s available on HBO and NowTV maybe elsewhere. It is a short wonderful series that deserves a lot of love. TV is a nice place compared to film as original ideas like this can actually be made.\n\nPrint this review"
