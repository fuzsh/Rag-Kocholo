        "text": "Tag: Bill Hader\n\nCast Chronology: Kristen Wiig\n\n(*SIGH*)………….I can’t escape it, can I?\n\nI Know that many people out there are willing to walk on Broken Glass to defend Kristen Wiig…and while I’ve stated time and again that I have no problem with her OUTSIDE of SNL, the 7 years she called Studio 8H her home will probably be one of THE Most Polarizing times many SNL fans ever endured (Myself included); If not because we know deep down that she is enormously talented no matter what she does, than certainly because of just how irritating her performances could be in spite of her obvious talents and her seemingly shy nature when the cameras turn off…I know that seems hard to believe now, but there was once a time in certain circles of the SNL fandom where Wiig would be a 4-Letter word…I mean, it is in the literal sense, but I speak more in the figurative here. And speaking as a 25+ year fan of the show, this also meant having to endure the likes of Late period-Molly Shannon, barely tolerating Chris Kattan, and all 5 years of Cheri Oteri—on a Bad day, each of the previous are Teddy bears compared to Wiig on her best day…she was That irritating sometimes…And yet, she was the show’s Golden Girl from 2005 to 2012; with some considering her the 2nd coming of Gilda Radner—Yes, they set the bar THAT high for Wiig…and while I can only KINDA see why people feel that way about her, “Kinda” is better than nothing at all…so there’s that.\n\nSo with her hosting this year’s Christmas episode, this would be as good a time as any to see just exactly How she became a Lionized figure of the show over the years—and with that, it’s time for another edition of “Cast Chronology”; that’s right, one of the most arguably popular cast members of recent years Does Not have a “Best of” show/DVD/Highlight reel to her name…which is unfortunate, because I’m sure there are a number of Hidden Gems of hers out there that are FAR better than even her most irritating pieces, but since she doesn’t, we gotta follow our own rules…\n\n*This is NOT—I repeat, NOT—a “Best Of” or “Favorites” list by any means. This is really more to show how certain cast members evolved over a period of time, and what ultimately brought them to where they are now. So this will mean that I will more than likely include some “Bad” sketches as well.\n\n*Like we said, Wiig doesn’t have a “Best Of” DVD, any sketch in her time frame is fair play.\n\n*The sketches they appear in are either Lead or Supporting roles; no bit parts.\n\n*Since Wiig is one of our more “Tenured” cast members; she’ll have One sketch per Calendar year featured—but ONLY as a Cast member; Cameos/Host appearances since she left the show will not count. However, because she started out as a Featured player (as most cast members do these days), I’ll do some Doubling up on those years.\n\n*Finally, I lift the “Non-recurring” rule for these, partly because a cast member’s run would’ve been incomplete/impossible without mentioning At Least a few of them.\n\nFALL 2005\n\nTHE SOAKING WET KILLER (11/12/2005 – Photo from “One SNL A Day”) – Wiig’s introduction to the show was every bit as auspicious as any other cast member who joins the show while there are fully established players well-rooted in their runs—even more so for Wiig, because not unlike her fellow alumni Rachel Dratch, Maya Rudolph, Jason Sudeikis & Kate McKinnon, she had the distinction of starting her run smack-dab in the middle of a season. Still though, she hit the ground running in–what was otherwise—a relatively low-key straight role. Of course, if all she did on the show were Low-key roles, her tenure wouldn’t be half as memorable as it turned out to be. She had to show a little more range in order for anybody to notice her…\n\nSPRING 2006\n\nTWO A-HOLES AT A CRIME SCENE (5/20/2006) – Disregarding use of a creep in this particular sketch; This is not the first one of these sketches to have aired early in her run, but it certainly was one of Wiig’s first that shows how she could toggle herself between low-key and slightly needling (but in a good way in this case). As one half of the un-named A-Hole couple, Wiig managed to perfectly capture a specific type of person that was running far too rampant, even back then. One of the Clueless, vapid, shallow, self-absorbed excuse of a human being who Thinks they have the world on a string thanks to how clueless those people tend to be; but in the end, nothing winds up getting accomplished. These sketches ran for about 3 years, and while there was an inevitable mark of “Diminishing Returns” each time she & Jason Sudeikis did them, Somehow, the couple’s Ass-holic ways turned out to be somewhat endearing in spite of how much people like that can get to you in real life. So, OK, we can see that Wiig is capable of having a little range…what else can she do?\n\nFALL 2006\n\nTARGET (12/16/2006 – Photo from “The Wicker Breaker”) – Again, this is not the first of these sketches, nor is it even the most famous one of these sketches (Ironically, another Timberlake helmed sketch where he plays someone named “Classic Peg” seems to be the most popular…for some reason). But it’s worth noting that it’s probably around this time where some people started to realize that a flag or two might be raised with Wiig. Not just because of how grating Wiig’s cashier would wind up becoming, but also the notion—at least to some of us—that she may or may not have been trying to horn in the work of another sketch performer from another sketch series? Don’t believe me? Watch the Target sketch I linked you to, and THEN watch Mo Collins of MadTV fame as Stuart’s Mom, and tell me that the two of them could’ve been related…I dare you. Still though, even though this was Wiig’s 2nd year on the show, she was still trying to find her voice; or if she already did, she’s trying to find the right volume to use. Unfortunately, (To borrow a few metaphors from what I do for a living) Volume is just one piece of Calibration needed in order to attain perfection; you still have to adjust the Bass, the Treble, the EQ and the Dynamics in order to achieve a superior product…\n\n2007\n\nWHERE’S MY PURSE (10/13/2007) – I Stand Corrected, I think it’s HERE where we start to see the flags flying on just how hammy she could be on her worst day…AND YET I can’t blame her 100% on the performance—credit/blame has to go to whoever wrote this (I’m guessing James Anderson due to sketches like these being his bread and butter), plus a few other performers in the sketch helping to drag it down with her. I mentioned this sketch years ago, but I feel the need to bring this one up again simply for the fact that this may have represented sort of a “Point of No Return” for Wiig. In that the characters and other people she would play from here on out had to do something “Wacky” or “Kooky” in order to get any kind of reaction from the audience—something I would like to coin as “Look at the Keys Syndrome”, y’know, like when you try to do that for a Baby in order for it to giggle even a little. AND YET, in spite of the sketch’s Major flaws, this could’ve worked under different circumstances…what, I don’t know, but certainly far better ones than whining about the whereabouts of her Purse. As I mentioned previously, something about this sketch felt a little familiar; almost like something “30 Rock” would do (with all due respect). Otherwise, I think it’s safe to say that this sketch began to put Wiig onto a rocky path, one that could only be navigated if she could segue herself into more subtle roles to help balance things out…\n\n2008\n\nVIRGINIA HORSEN’S HOT-AIR BALLOON RIDES (2/23/2008) – THIS…This right Here…This is the Kind of performance that I WISH Kristen Wiig did more often on SNL. Granted, she’s since become Far more subtle & nuanced in her movie roles; but at this point in show history, it started to become increasingly rarer for Wiig to do. So whenever she did pieces like these where she was the right blend of Low-Key and Wacky; and instead, trading those performances for ones that were big and loud by comparison–It almost felt like finding the Pot of Gold at the end of a somewhat jagged rainbow. What’s more, this sketch was only done twice, so even though this had all the potential to be recurring; perhaps whoever wrote both sketches (and maybe even Wiig herself) thought that doing any more than that would probably be overkill…a lesson that Wiig may have conveniently forgot about when it comes to the next few entries…\n\n2009\n\nTODAY (2/7/2009) – When it comes to doing an impression of a famous person on the show, the approach could be taken a number of ways. You could actually not have to give a damn about the person you’re portraying and just reduce it to a few choice foibles (Chevy as Gerald Ford, for instance); Or, you could actually give a damn, put in the effort and try to do something that’s as close to a photocopy of the person you’re impersonating as possible (Messers Carvey, Hartman, Hammond & Hader AND Madams McKinnon, Gardner & Fineman, just to name a few). In Wiig’s case, she sort of fell somewhere in the middle with her portrayal of Kathie Lee Gifford; she’s got the look down, she’s got the mannerisms down, but IMO she may have went a step too far when portraying Gifford as a seemingly clueless day-drinker (You all know that the “Wine” she & Hota Kotb drink on TV is Prop wine, right? They weren’t actually “Drunk” on the air). In other words, as much as I’m sure the Real Kathie Lee may have enjoyed the impression from time to time, I think it may have been a little too unfair a portrayal. Or, to borrow a famous “Lorne-ism” It got a laugh, but did it get the RIGHT Laugh?\n\n2010\n\nSECRET WORD & GARTH & KAT – ………………..(*DEEP BREATH*)…………OK, I’m just gonna treat these as a band-aid I need to rip off my arm; the sooner I do, the better…………(*DEEP BREATH*)…………If “Where’s My Purse” was considered Wiig’s “Point of No Return” when it comes to how hammy she could be, as well as her ability to toggle between that and Subtle performances, then THESE Two entities is the point where Wiig is permanently sucked into a Black Hole of Ham and can only hope she comes across her 80 year old daughter “Interstellar” style in an effort to forgive her for embarking on the mission in the first place (It’s been a while since I’ve seen it, pardon me). These Two characters may be THE most polarizing of all among SNL Hardcore fans and Casual tuners-in; One side LOOOOOVVVES Them to pieces, while the other side wonders if Elvis had the right Idea all along when it comes to Handguns and TV sets. For me personally, this is Kristen Wiig at her Nadir. And, just as it is the case time and time again, these are characters that really only worked ONE Time and ONE time only…yet, for some reason, the audience ate it up just enough so that they would keep coming back again and again…But Why? The “Secret Word” sketches were a send-up on the original 1960s version of the game show “Password”, particularly the times when the Celebrity contestants (and sometimes the host) would screw up gameplay by reading the word that they’re NOT Supposed to read…and that’s all fine and good…for just ONE SKETCH. But thanks to just how over-the-top Wiig plays her attention-seeking, theater actress Bon vivant, Mindy “LOOK AT ME!” Grayson, this sketch somehow repeated itself an additional 8 times—One is Plenty, we get the joke. Same can be said for “Garth & Kat”, Update’s perpetually unprepared singing duo (and sometimes Trio) who SWEAR They have their act together, and yet, somehow, Wiig & Fred Armisen continue to bumble their way through the routine—one that, to my knowledge, is one of the ONLY times SNL allows any form of improvisation on the show, and considering how “to the Script” it tends to be, that SHOULD be saying something; but it doesn’t mean a damn thing if the piece isn’t funny to begin with…and again, that’s all fine and good for EXACTLY ONE APPEARANCE…And Yet………BOY, did this one have endurance, not 100% certain of the exact number of them, but NBC’s site has them listed (at least) NINE TIMES. That’s NINE TIMES that people fell for the ruse. A Ruse that Update Anchor Seth Meyers could’ve easily put a stop to; but given his Characteristic of giving his Update correspondents chance upon chance to get things right the next time (Spoiler alert: Both sketches never did, try as they may to vary things on rare occasions). This one-two punch of More ham than allowed at Chanukah pretty much soured my opinion on Kristen Wiig for some time; and it would take nothing short of a miracle for her to win me back (again, not counting her movies, just SNL Only).\n\n2011\n\nRED FLAG (9/25/2011) – Thankfully by the time of her (unbeknownst to us at this point) final season, she actually managed to find the happy medium between nuance and showing off. Even more happily, this may very well be the best of both of those worlds. A perfume parody—incidentally, narrated by friend of the show Jon Hamm—where we get to see Wiig go back and forth between subtle and manic, and nothing is lost in translation. Even more so, she manages to do this (almost) without a single word of dialogue—a plus—and she’ll still manage to chew more scenery than a famine victim. Maybe because it’s as brief as Commercial parodies go, it–not unlike Virginia Horsen–serves its purpose in not overstaying its welcome; another plus. This piece may arguably be Wiig’s best “non-character” sketch, and it also shows just how far she’s come in 6 years’ time by this time.\n\n2012\n\nGRADUATION (5/19/2012 – Photo from “One SNL a Day”) – It’s fitting that we wrap this up with Wiig’s final appearance as a cast member; and depending on which side you find yourself on, this moment is either gonna be a tearful moment, a “tears of joy” moment, a “Goodbye, and Good Riddance” moment, or a “Please pass the Vomit Bag” moment. For me personally; when this first aired, my immediate reaction on the old S-N-L message board was “IT’S OFFICIAL, SHE’S HISTORY!!!” But not in a “don’t let the door hit you on the way out” kind of way, because even though she was very much a divisive figure to a number of people, you can’t fault the impact she ultimately left on the show in her 7 years for better or worse…so much so, that she continued to make periodic non-hosting cameos for a little while since she left (which she has Thankfully dialed back on over time). Still though, she earned her victory lap; and thanks to Mick “NOT FUNNYYYYY!!!” Jagger hosting, Wiig’s send-off winds up being classier than expected thanks to use of the songs “She’s a Rainbow” and “Ruby Tuesday”; accompanied by the entire cast sharing a dance step or two. What really makes this moment both a Special Occasion AND a point of Polarization among fans, however, was when Lorne would come on stage as Wiig’s final dance partner…Which, I’m sure was a very strong sentiment to Wiig, but I can’t help but think of how other cast members left the show before and since this (that includes Andy Samberg, whose final show it happen to be as well, but he already said goodbye earlier in the oft-forgotten “Lazy Sunday” sequel, so…fair trade?). Nevertheless, after many moments in the sun for the past 7 years, this was her victory lap; and the rest of the cast dancing along with her seem genuinely sad to see her go…even though she will log more than her fair share of cameos in the intervening years.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Wiig certainly deserves her props for doing what she did on the show—but only to a point…that point being somewhere around 2009, but it’s not her fault that she wound up getting the material that she got, and I don’t even blame the writers either for their lack of imagination more often than not. The back-to-back departures of Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph within a year of each other sort of flung Wiig into the role of “Alpha Female” even though many other underperformers tried (and failed) to ease the slack a little. Still, Wiig persisted for better or worse—even more so depending on what side you were on. For what it’s worth, Wiig busted her ass on the show, yet at the same time, she tried too hard just to please us; sometimes appearing in roughly 90% of some shows during her run. Despite the show’s psychological need to seek out a “Star” once every few years from the people they hire; SNL is, was, and will always be an ensemble show. No man (or woman) is an island, and I would’ve been perfectly satisfied if Wiig delegated a role or two once in a blue moon. But because the audience practically ate out of her hands every time she wound up on camera, there she was for the whole world to see, and in some cases, endure. I’m glad she’s since been able to find her niche is roles that cater more to the kind of performer she was meant to be—though I AM dying to know just how she’ll carry herself once “Wonder Woman 1984” rolls out. Considering the Extensiveness of her tenure, I know I left a few more noteworthy moments out (Apologies to Judy Grimes [one of my favorite characters of all time, BTW], Surprise Sue, Suze Orman, Dooneese & Shana—No apologies to “Trina/Thomas”, because at least Wiig came to her senses on that); but like I said at the top, this was more of a look at how Wiig got from Point A to Point B, so apologies for leaving those moments out. I also realize that this analysis of a former cast member may come off as “Bitter” to some of you who have read this article—just as a reminder, I’m only one guy and I am by NO means a definitive resource. If you happen to like Wiig, all the better. I like her too, just not (100%) on SNL.\n\nWith that said, that wraps up 2020 (thank Merciful god), We’ll do another one of these as soon as the show comes back—whenever that is, most likely late January or whenever it’s OK for people to watch TV tapings in closed spaces again, Gov. Cuomo & Mayor DeBlasio, I’m looking in YOUR direction—I hope beyond hope that we don’t screw up 2021 as much as we did this year, and I’ll catch ‘ya on the next one. Happy Giving Month, everybody!\n\nThe Top 12 SNL Holiday sketches (that I remember seeing)\n\nSNL & Christmas go together like Booze in Egg Nog—one can’t be half as enjoyable without the other. So with that here now is a re-configured version of 12 Holiday themed sketches that I posted 3 years ago; now in the form of an actual list. Why am I doing this (aside from the obvious fact that it’s the Holidays as I write this)? For a little while now, I had been teasing some sort of re-vamp of the Original S.O.S.N.L. page—separating some of it (including pieces like this) is one of the first steps in getting it done. Hopefully by later in 2020, we will compartmentalize all the sketches I’ve put up by Decade (70s, 80s, etc). In the meantime, here’s how this works once again…\n\nCRITERIA:\n\n*The sketch Has to have Aired in December\n\n*They have to be Actual sketches—No “Update” pieces (Sorry, Sandler “Hanukkah Song” fans).\n\n*While it is tempting to throw the “No Recurring” rule around, there were some cases where it couldn’t be avoided; two items on the list sort of straddle the line, so I will allow them. In the meantime; this means NO “Schweddy balls”, NO “Dick in a Box”, or anything else that had a holiday edition of itself. I know that seems unfair, but if you haven’t read these things by now, you should know by now that I always like to seek out the underdogs.\n\n*Finally, because I’m expanding this list to 12 as opposed to my usual 8, there will be NO Honorable mentions this time around.\n\n(DO IT ON MY) TWIN BED (Original Airdate: 12/21/2013) – Already mentioned this one on the Main Page; but suffice to say, in a period where the show was still looking for a suitable replacement for Samberg’s “Lonely Island”, Former writers Chris Kelly & Sarah Schneider was able to take the baton—at least for a little while—and give us a slicked up girl-group version of what it would be like to sleep on your childhood bed…also, I’d be lying if I didn’t think each and every one of the ladies looked kinda hot. But that aside, there are still a lot of funny visuals to cover the bases; up to and including 7th grade pics of those who participated in the song and just how awkward a visual doing it on a twin bed can be. Add an infectious rhythm to the song itself, and you’ve got a neo-classic.\n\nCHRISTMAS SERIAL (Original Airdate: 12/20/2014) – SNL is DAMN Lucky I’m a fan of Podcasts & NPR/IFC/PBS Style Documentaries, otherwise this might have been completely lost on me—But I’m not sure about everybody else watching. I also think this is yet another case where the piece would be better if it were on sometime later in the show—not 12:50, but maybe pre-MG/Update. For the uninitiated, yes, “Serial” is a Real Show/Podcast, and for what it’s worth, they Nailed it; Especially Cecily as Sarah Koenig—possibly her best performance to date (not to mention that she once again seems to resemble a Young Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Kyle nails it as sort of a Nouveau Santa, Kenan’s part was quick and subtle, Kate & (host) Amy Adams’ parts were subtle too. Even Jay & Aidy (despite being Crudely Drawn Court sketchings) played their parts well. This was the 2ndbiggest highlight of an otherwise DISMAL Christmas show, Highlight #1 being Mike Myers reviving “Dr. Evil”.They captured the style Very Well, I just fear that most of the audience watching might not “Get it”.\n\nMOMMIE DEAREST (Original Airdate: 12/16/1978)– Just like the movie & the book itself, this is one of those things that people either Really love, really hate, or really love to hate. For me personally, it’s more of a “Guilty Pleasure”. The Daughter of actress/bitch nonpareil Joan Crawford came out with a tell-all book about her troubled Childhood around that time; and well before Faye Dunaway made us unintentionally laugh at her portrayal of Crawford, Jane Curtin probably gives her single best non-Update performance in the 5 years she was on the show (I’m Dead Serious). Practically everything the real Christina Crawford wrote in the book is showcased here; the beatings, the obsessive cleanliness, and even the fact she was fed raw meat was a prototype re-enactment of what was to come later in the 1981 movie. Add to that, Gilda’s underappreciated “Colleen Fernman” character being transplanted into Crawford’s daughter with some great physical comedy—as well as one of opur two exceptions to the “No Character” rule, even though it’s not exactly a “Tentpole” character like, say, The church Lady or The Liar or anything ever featured in an SNL Coffee table book, the character still existed for about 3 years with little to no fanfare, so Fuck it, I’m going to allow this entry. Anyway, add to that well as some sharp “Old Hollywood” impressions from Dan, Bill & Laraine, and this oft-overlooked Holiday gem could use a little more attention than one of Crawford’s neglected children (Wire Coat hangers not included).\n\nA CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS ‘02 (Original Airdate: 12/13/2002)– This is probably my 2ndfavorite Smigeltoon of all time (All time favorite is a few spots below). Largely because Smigel & his animation company discovered a HUGE Flaw with a holiday classic, and then exploited that flaw in order to create a New Holiday Classic—and if his later forwards in the various “Peanuts Treasury” books are any indication, Smigel ESPECIALLY wanted to do this one with great care. It’s all based on that last scene in the original “Charlie Brown Christmas” where the Peanuts kids spruce up Charlie Brown’s stick with a Ball on it, and suddenly it’s a healthy looking tree. Realizing the kids possess the power of Alchemy, they go around town doing the same thing to other things with deep flaws—only for Linus to bring it all back home by the end. Some of the jokes here are inspired, others are a little Too on-the-nose for that point in time (and yes, most of the jokes are now horribly outdated…R.I.P. Michael, David & Anna Nicole); but regardless, it’s still a welcome modern take on something nostalgic. I also have to give Smigel some extra credit in the…well…credits at the end. The Peanuts specials were probably one of the few times they would refer to animators as “Graphic Blandishment”, which Smigel does here as well. Despite the Obvious/Blatant Peppermint Patty/Marcie joke, Charles Schultz would’ve been proud of this.\n\nYOU’RE A RAT BASTARD, CHARLIE BROWN (Original Airdate: 12/15/2012) – Speaking of “Peanuts”, This is probably one of SNL’s greatest impression showcases Ever—or at the very least, the best one in recent memory that’s NOT a “Screen Test” film (You know, one of THESE shorts). Hader’s Pacino, Sudeikis’ (now horribly outdated) Phillip Seymour Hoffman, an early look at Kate’s greatness as Edie Falco. And to top it off, Martin Short as an impeccable Larry David (which also makes me wonder if Short could’ve played Bernie Sanders just in case the Real Larry couldn’t make it in one night or was sick of playing him). Add the childlike innocence of “Peanuts”, and you wind up with a good laugh needed at the right time………Literally. This sketch was one of many that aired a little over 24 hours after the massacre in Newtown, CT occurred. And if SNL knew how to do at least ONE thing right in its 40+ years on the air, it’s giving the audience a much needed laugh. They proved it after 9/11, they proved it during the first Gulf War they proved it after last fall’s attacks in Paris, and I’m sure if they were able to air new episodes during the summer they would’ve been able to prove it after Orlando, Turkey & France again. This sketch was 100% pure catharsis right when we needed it the most, and both the show and the sketch shine brighter because of it.\n\nSANTI-WRAP (Original Airdate: 12/11/1976)– To this day, I Still say “Ho, Ho, Ho” with a slur in my voice A La Belushi…whether I’m drunk or not…and that’s not even the focus of the sketch. Dan & Laraine visit a Mall Santa; and because it’s the far less hygienic 1970s, Dan warns Laraine of the dangers of sitting on Santa’s lap. So he gives her Red & Green colored Toilet Covers, and while that may have been a one-joke premise, sometimes one joke (without belaboring it too much) is all you need…That, and they clearly still had some of the freshman jitters to work through, so that alone gives this a pass. But like I said, Belushi steals the show here playing just about 99% of every Mall Santa EVER, albeit very briefly. Also, I just love the little girl’s reaction here in the still-shot, looking like she’d rather be ANYWHERE else but on a TV show that few thought would make it back then…My guess is she’s probably a lawyer or a nun by now.\n\nTHE NARRATOR THAT RUINED CHRISTMAS (Original Airdate: 12/15/2001)– The 2001-2002 season was a watershed year for SNL; one that started out with a sense that we all had to “get back to normal” after 9/11. Yes, there were several shows & sketches before this one that sort of laid some foundation, but aside from a few “Update” jokes/commentaries and some sketches that walked the line of good taste, this might’ve been the first time they truly dove head-first into the subject while it was still fresh in our minds. At Christmas…with Rankin-Bass puppets. I was a Senior in High School when this first aired, and even though I had no personal loss at the WTC, many people I knew did (Also, I hadvisited the City a few weeks before it happened, so there was a slight sense of “What If” in my home at the time). So when this aired, I honestly didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry about this. And not even for the tragedy still being fresh, but for the fact that they took a symbol of innocence like “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer” and mashed it up with a subject that’s all parts solemn, mournful and still tense while laying down the harshness of it all at the same time (all of Santa’s lines, for instance)…but MAN, was it a much needed sigh of relief—not unlike “Rat Bastard” in ‘12. Not that all previous post 9/11 efforts weren’t, but this felt more like an exclamation point on the subject; and afterwards, we could truly begin to “get on with our lives”—though ANOTHER sketch I’ll talk about this coming 9/11 might actually be a better representative of that mentality. In the meantime, I feel that talking about something with serious subject matter today might’ve been a little too much to take. Fortunately, the next entry—also from 2001–blows the seriousness of this out of the water.\n\nCHRISTMAS KANGAROO (Original airdate: 12/8/2001)– Will Ferrell getting raped by a Kangaroo while Hugh Jackman narrates…And in the end, isn’t THAT what Christmas is all about? Extremely juvenile imagery aside, I’d like to think that the other reasons why this one is funny was either because of Ferrell’s fearlessness in being on the receiving end, or the matter-of-fact way the story is being told by Jackman, or the fact that Jackman is giving the play-by-play of the Roo Rape while keeping a semi-straight face. But while those are valid reasons the sketch is funny by itself, we all know the REAL reason is because after several months of being a tense nation, the audience was yearning to let off some steam. It’s also a sketch like this that make me wonder why the hell Jackman hasn’t come back to host…then again, if other people can all take a long stretch of years to return, maybe the time will be right This year…not that there are any more Wolverine movies to plug anymore, but at least do SOMETHING worth coming back for.\n\nTHE NIGHT HANUKKAH HARRY SAVED CHRISTMAS (Original Airdate: 12/15/1989)– I was debating to myself whether or not to count this one, largely because few people know about the Easter/Passover sequel this sketch had a few months later in April 1990. But since 2 sketches doesn’t exactly warrant the “Recurring” label, and Lovitz was on his way out by the time both aired, I’ll give it a pass…also, I’m Jewish so consider this entry flagrant & blatant tokenism (WINK, WINK). On the surface, it looked like a number of stereotypical Jewish jokes (I.e. Socks & Slacks as presents), but it was the way Lovitz was overly enthusiastic in his performance that sold me—one that he would sort of revisit years later in This scene from “The Critic” (sorry for the music overshadowing). And of course, who could forget the theme song—On Moishe, On Herschel, On Schlomo—All due respect to Sandler, but THAT should’ve been a more popular Hanukkah carol! Surprisingly, the gentile girls & boys at The AV Club goes into almost encyclopedic detail about this sketch and its sequel, I strongly recommend you read that next.\n\nA HOLIDAY WISH (12/13/1986) –This is probably going to be the shortest entry I’ll do in this list, because quite honestly, The premise couldn’t be more straightforward; Steve Martin has a simple holiday wish to share, he then tacks on a little extra, it falls off the rails in the long run, but it stays subtle to the end—all within less than 3 minutes. Say THAT about sketches in this day & age. A sketch that you KNOW has become a part of every holiday season when it winds up as a talking Hallmark Christmas Card years later (Same goes for “Dysfunctional Family Christmas”, but I digress). Also, don’t worry about the screencap, I took the liberty of cueing it past Steve’s introduction and the reminder that “Gilly” was ever a thing.\n\nIT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE LOST ENDING (12/20/1986)– This is one of only a Handful of sketches I could quote verbatim from beginning to end, largely because the source material is also quotable verbatim from beginning to end. The ‘86-‘87 season was already becoming a legendary comeback year when this sketch came along to seal the deal. Carvey had debuted his Jimmy Stewart impression several weeks earlier in the classic “Mastermind” sketch, but it was here where it was perfected (portraying a Stewart 40 years younger helps too). But that’s 2nd to the fact that the sketch itself is pure insanity to the highest regard…especially once Carvey, Hooks & Dennis Miller (in a Rare sketch appearance) start beating the shit out of Lovitz doing an almost pitch perfect Lionel Barrymore. It was not only a high point of the comeback season & Christmases yet to come, but it also further cemented the notion that nothing was safe on SNL…not even hallowed holiday classics.\n\nHOMEWARD BOUND (Original Airdate – 12/20/1975…you’re gonna need Quicktime to watch, BTW): In my mind, there is really only ONE piece that not only sums up the holidays, but also proves once again that a sketch or a film doesn’t necessarily have to be Funny in order for it to be Memorable. That being said, here’s this week’s film by Gary Weis…You may not know this about me, but I’m a bit of a sap on some occasions. I like the funny stuff as much as the next guy, but once in a while, I like the occasional tug at the heartstrings (Half of Tom Schiller’s stuff comes to mind). One of Gary Weis’ first films for the show certainly fits the bill. Not only that, but it does so in the simplest of ways—people are seen arriving at an airport into the arms of their loved ones just in time for the holidays, all while the Simon & Garfunkel song of the same name plays in the background…and that’s it, no gimmicks, no flash, no pizazz, not even any jokes. It’s just a simple & sentimental observation of human joy…something I WISH SNL would do more of in modern day times. It was a kind of film that signaled to the still-curious audience of 1975 “Hey, we don’t HAVE to be funny ALL the time”. That same signal might’ve been brushed off by the majority of the cast/writers/crew, but somebody else on staff wound up catching on, and HIS films would become almost as deep as Weis’. I Could go on about the differences between Weis & Schiller…but I won’t (besides, i’ve got a week of Schiller films to go over at some point). All I’ll say is that while Schiller is the more Avant-garde film maker in SNL Lore, Weis’ films had more of a “Human” touch, and it particularly shows in this one—my absolutely all-time favorite SNL Christmas piece; sketch, film or otherwise. And if you STILL Don’t believe me that a film like this can strike the right nerve, check out Weis’ website, and read the Fan Letter being expressed about this film…you can’t beat that…………..Excuse me, I think I have something in my eye…(*RUNS OFF*)…\n\nWe’ll be back this Weekend with ScarJost’s 4th appearance from 2015.\n\nThe Top 8 Silver Linings of SNL Season 35 – REVISED\n\nSo there’s a reason why I wanted to jump ahead to talking about Season 35, and I did tease that it would be a bit of a personal one—albeit with a bit of a flimsy subtext. This past Wednesday, I myself turned 35; and with it came a number of things I found myself asking: What has my life been up to this point? Where do I see my life going from here on out? Am I ever going to do anything about this pesky toothache without affording Dental Insurance? Why is my Belly Button starting to bleed at random, and DEAR GOD, MAN, WHY HAVEN’T YOU USED YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE YET?! While the other 3 questions have no connection to the subject, the first two holds a parallel pretty close to my own life. For SNL’s 35th season is also a case of asking how far has it come since the beginning, and what else is on the horizon? Based on the refresher course I gave myself for this season, I have a feeling that the 35th year of anything—TV show, human being or otherwise—can be seen by some as the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the end…no matter how optimistic you can be about certain things. After all, some people argue that 35 is the point in a person’s life when a Mid-Life Crisis Actually STARTS, but not all at once and over a stretch of time. Then again, who would’ve foreseen SNL even lasting THIS long even back then? After all; in the TV world, 8 years on the air could be considered geriatric (with Rare exceptions). Looking back on this season, I have to wonder if the Twitter followers who recommended this didn’t actually mean the following year instead, because I remember Season 36 being Slightly Worse than this one. Of course, this doesn’t mean that Season 35 didn’t have its flaws as well—once again, this part is off the top of my head, I’m sure there were other moments I conveniently forgot about:\n\n*This season’s Disappointment Hosts/Episodes: Megan Fox, Ryan Reynolds, Gerard Butler, January Jones (ESPECIALLY), James Franco, Ashton Kutcher, Ryan Phillipe, and Mr. imitation orange himself; Alec Baldwin.\n\n*Far Too Much complacency in the Writer’s room; while there were a few Good Moments below, you can’t help but notice that 75% of the season felt more phoned in than AT&T. Sketches weren’t “Dismal” (with some exceptions), but when the quantity of the quality gets to a certain amount, one has to wonder how much more mediocrity we could take before the next election cycle.\n\n*I think we’ve mentioned Jenny Slate’s opening night F-Bomb enough times around here…but that’s 2nd to the fact that—even to her own admission years later—she simply wasn’t ready for “Not Ready for Prime Time”.\n\n*The Increasing insufferability of Fred Armisen & Kristen Wiig…it was honestly a toss-up each week to see who could out-overact the other…The fact that this was also the season that brought us “Garth & Kat” further punctuated it.\n\n*This sketch—a Family Feud parody of the Richard Dawson era—that poked fun at the HILARIOUS subject of Incest between MacKenzie Phillips and her Father…’nuff said.\n\n*This would be Will Forte’s last year—though we didn’t really know about that until after the season ended…which kinda sucked because of all the people who deserved a “Farewell” sketch of some kind, it was him after 8 years…Then again, see #8.\n\n*An infamous spoof of former host Brittany Murphy via Abby Elliott……airing 2 weeks before she died unexpectedly…awkward…and some days I feel dirty digging deep in the web to find a clip like that.\n\nBe that as it may, those are the ONLY things I can think of that were wrong with this year, (SPOLIER ALERT) This might be one of those years that seemed a lot better in Hindsight…\n\nTHE MacGRUBER MOVIE – The sketches themselves had been running for a few years by this point; and while the formula for each of them were largely the same each time, it was one of those sketches that didn’t disappoint no matter what. Credit for that could go to Will Forte for just how manic his performance was sometimes. But what REALLY tipped the scales for the character was the big-budgeted Movie that opened in May of 2010 to “Meh” reviews and even “Meh-er” Box Office results—so much so, that the movie went from being played in 2500+ theaters in its opening weekend to less than 200 two weeks later, but has since gone on to become a basic/premium cable staple—to say nothing of the fact that this was the first movie since 2000’s “The Ladies Man” to be a Big screen adaptation of an SNL character. For the record, I actually saw this in theaters when it came out…and I was one of only 4 people who was in the theater that day. For what it’s worth, I enjoyed the movie and took it for what it was; a natural—albeit R-Rated—extension of, and a fitting finale for the character…at least for now, because every once in a blue moon, a rumor pops up that perhaps Forte might actually bring the character back as a Streaming TV series…I would Not place any bets of it landing on Disney+ any time soon. Also, one thing that I’m sure millions of others have noticed that’s worth pointing out—ever notice how all of the Bombs in those sketches have “On/Off” buttons? I know it would defeat the purpose of the sketches if that plothole was exploited, but it honestly surprised me that nobody ever thought to end a sketch with Forte hitting the button, he thinks he finally did a good job, but then it blows up anyway…but what do I know about comedy? Speaking of Forte…\n\n7. POTATO CHIP THIEF (12/5/2009) – If this was going to be Will Forte’s last season (unbeknownst to us at the time), the least he could do is give us one last blast of oddness. While “MacGruber”–for better or Worse–was Forte’s “commercial” Peak, This “10 to 1” Classic may very well be Forte at his most absurd; maybe even more than 2005’s “Spelling Bee”…Unfortunately, matters of personal taste are largely the reason why I had to put this otherwise great moment near the bottom of the list. As much as I enjoyed 90% of the sketch (which is already ridiculous enough; especially with such a low-budget looking office for a NASA Job interview), the part where Jason Sudekis–in a Proto-Maine Justice ensemble–Tries to…shall we say…”Return” the Potato chip that he accidentally ate from Forte’s bowl is just…….EWWWW!!! And I know, comedy is all in the eye of the beholder, but…still……..EWWWW! Nevertheless, I felt it was important to not only mention this sketch being one of the highlights of the year, but also just how the show wouldn’t quite be the same after Forte’s departure.\n\nTHE DAWN OF “WHAT UP WITH THAT” – What would turn out to be one of Kenan Thompson’s signature routines made its debut this year………and BOY is this gonna be polarizing for some of us! I should probably explain; when these sketches first aired, a lot of us thought “OK, we’ve got something high energy that’ll keep the audience entertained for a little while, no harm in that.” But then as the season goes on; and people realize just how popular the sketches would become, there was also the lingering dread of having the same joke of the sketch be repeated over and over until the end of time (or at least until 2013 when Jason Sudeikis and his track suited backup dancer left the show along with Fred Armisen’s Kenny-G-ish Sax Player). By all accounts and purposes, this was a sketch that both burnt bright And burnt out in just a few instalments…AND YET, because of the fact that we haven’t seen one of these sketches since 2013, there’s also the lingering sense of actually missing them a little (“How can we miss you if you won’t go away” as they say…pretty easily, as it turns out). Which begs the question of if/when Kenan eventually leaves the show, will he give us the moves one more time? He damn well better, even if it means bringing back everybody involved in the originals—including Sudeikis, Armisen And Bill Hader reprising his put-upon Lindsey Buckingham—it would totally be worth it.\n\nWEEKEND UPDATE THURSDAY – At the risk of saying something speculatory, I think Lorne Michaels has Always been jealous of Jon Stewart and/or his Daily Show crew. After all, they pretty much took SNL’s concept of fake news (which in itself was sort of borrowed from “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh In”) and expanded on it in such a way that a 30 minute comedy program does more to tell us the events of the day than actual news programs. Sure enough, at the seemingly endless peak of TDS’ popularity under Stewart’s reign, TPTB at NBC saw it fit to give half-hour editions of Weekend Update a try in Prime Time. This would not be the show’s first (or last) attempt at doing this. The first time was in 2001 when NBC thought it could counter-program against CBS’ “Survivor” by putting on special 20 minute episodes of SNL (including Update) to help compliment the networks desperation ploy of “Supersizing” episodes of their other hit shows. The gambit barely worked, because it was almost impossible to fit in an opening sketch, and Update segment and a closing sketch in such an illogically short time frame and NOT be an [adult swim] show. Then In 2003, the show took a page from the “In Living Color” playbook and attempted to drain some viewers from that year’s Super Bowl by putting on a special Update at Halftime—while the content was certainly better than watching Shania Twain, No Doubt & Sting performing together, the end result of the program felt like a suicide mission, but NBC was not to be deterred. While technically, “WU Thursday” debuted the year before to mixed results, the show’s 2nd cycle of them in the summer of 2009 fared slightly better, likely because Amy Poehler came back to co-anchor with Seth Meyers, but mostly because people seldom watched TV that time of year due to reruns elsewhere, people would’ve probably tuned in anyway. At the same time, I always thought of “WU Thursday” as a chance for the writers to actually get more stuff on the air that some would fear may have been cut the first time; but now that there was an extra half hour to fill, the chance of getting material on would greatly increase. The Thursday editions would pop up sporadically over the next few years; again during the 2012 election, and most recently in 2017 with Jost & Che—both of those showings had mixed results as well; but again, because it was Summer, it certainly beat the alternative of watching reruns.\n\nSIR CHARLES BREAKS THE SPORTS HOST BARRIER (1/9/2010) – If you have yet to read This List of sports personalities who hosted the show once, do so quickly so you can be brought up to speed……or, don’t, because the list is both relevant and irrelevant to the subject at the same time. Why? Well, If I were a betting man, I’d probably wind up homeless if I were to wager that Charles Barkley would not only NEVER host the show a 2nd time, but also wind up hosting two additional times since this one. But he did, becoming the first (and so far, Only) Sports figure to log multiple times as a host—of course, there’s a stark difference between him hosting in 1993 and him hosting in 2010. For starters, he was no longer a basketball player, but rather an analyst for coverage on TNT—of which, he seemed to be getting a lot of attention for thanks to his color commentary. So, with that much Live TV under his belt, perhaps the time was right for him to make a return after 17 years…either that, or the show had plunged so much in quality, they were looking for just about anybody to host……then again, again, January shows are traditionally Wild Cards when it came to people hosting—no matter who they got it might’ve been a crapshoot at best, and nobody would blink an eye. Fortunately, Barkley not only did a good job, but perhaps better than his first appearance—not too much, but still. As far as this episode goes, Sir Charles held himself pretty well—I especially liked him in “Reel Quotes”, partly because it was one of the only sketches of the show where Barkely isn’t playing himself (Save for MacGruber and the insufferable “Shana”). Fortunately, progress is progress, and not only does he keep making progress with each successive appearance, he has become a friend of the show because of it.\n\nJOSEPH GORDON LEVITT MAKE’S EM LAUGH (11/21/09) – A Monologue I mentioned Many moons ago, but I’ll be more than happy to bring up again. Partly because of all the 4,928,523 Musical Monologues the show has had over the years; this one was not only one of my favorites, but it is probably the only one in show history that didn’t make me roll my eyes Liz Lemon Style. I should probably point out that whenever a Musical Monologue happens, I consider it a sign of one of the following—either (1) everybody’s on Autopilot for the week, or (2) there is no 2. Seriously, I can’t stand Musical Monologues. I’d rather watch an actual musical flop than sit through 5 minutes of something that I have a feeling writer Bryan Tucker concocted while sticking various Broadway songbooks in a blender, and have the emulsion be fed to fellow writer James Anderson……….This, on the other hand, may be the sole exception to the rule, because not only does JGL sell the HELL out of the performance, but it also helps to be a fan of “Singin’ in the Rain” to begin with. It’s one of those moments that really speaks for itself, though I’d be lying if I didn’t think JGL might’ve needed an Oxygen tank when all was said and done—whether he was acting out of breath or not–thankfully, they cut to commercial just in time.\n\nDRESS REHEARSAL CUTS SPONSORED BY BUD LIGHT – In one of the rare deviations from what was an otherwise “Normal” episode of the show–as well as one of the ONLY things that made fellow birthday boy Gerard Butler’s episode worth watching–two significant things wound up happening on October 17th, 2009. First, the show had a singular sponsor for the Entire episode; a new “Golden Wheat” flavor of Bud Light—and with the exception of local commercials that aired as a part of “Station Identification”, that was it as far as advertising goes (Sort of harkened back to the days of the 50s when single-sponsorship was more common, but not quite). But that was 2nd to the fact that in place of commercials from other sponsors, the show decided to fill the Non-Bud Light airtime with stuff that even us Diehard fans had either never, seldom or rarely seen before—Dress rehearsal/Blooper Footage of various sketches. Now, I’m not saying that this has NEVER been done on the show before (Chris Farley’s “Best of” show notably had a couple cuts from some of his sketches), but the fact that they would devote about 30% of the airtime to showing us such gems was a treat…one that I wish they would do again in the future (Nevermind the fact that they already post past & recent “Cut for Time” pieces on their Youtube channel—a step forward, BTW). In fact, one thing that I always hoped they would do as a contingency plan in case they experience another work stoppage (I.e. Actor & Writers Strikes) is just show FULL episodes that contain nothing but Dress cuts. That way, it would technically be “New” content that they would be showing, even though the content itself would be years old in some cases…not to mention, it would probably be the most TV exposure Kyle Mooney would experience in years (sorry for the inside joke). Point is, they teased us a little too much with the stunt, and I hope they open the archive doors a little wider if they do it again (Not counting Youtube, I mean put it on over the air). Among the Dress Bloopers that aired included “Riding My Donkey Political Talk Show”, a cut from 1996’s Chris Rock episode, and Various “Update” cuts that I think eventually made it on to Amy Poehler’s “Best Of” DVD (among other moments).\n\n1…Say it with me now…\n\nBETTY WHITE’S EPISODE (5/8/2010) – By all accounts and purposes, the very idea that somebody would host SNL based entirely on the whims of a (then budding) social media empire, even in the year 2010 as it was just about to hit the first of Many major peaks, seemed too implausible for it to happen…but not impossible (Then again, White isn’t the first elderly woman to host the show based on the whims of a home audience). As the story goes; somebody on Facebook started a group/petition to try to convince the show to have Betty White on as a host. At first, it was nothing more than a passing joke that few took seriously…but in the age of things going viral, it simply caught on—first in drips and drops; a Snickers commercial here, a casual name drop in an actual sketch there, and so on. One thing led to another, and it was eventually announced that White would be hosting the Mother’s Day edition of the show. The big question though, once they knew the booking would stick, is just how much can Mrs. Allen Ludden be able to pull off on Live TV…Late at night…at Age 88 & ½? Turns out, not unlike a certain Mr. Timberlake his first time out, she more than exceeded all of our expectations—then again, she has more than enough TV experience under her belt to have pulled it off without any issues anyway. But just to be safe, the show felt it was necessary to add on a few ringers/alumni as well as Jay-Z to keep the demographics from falling off the cliff. Fortunately, she held her own, and the extra guests were icing on the cake that still made meaningful contributions to the show without taking the spotlight away from Sue Ann Nivens…even if it meant bringing back a few classic characters/moments for old time sake; most notably, a return to the “Delicious Dish” and a surprise sequel to 2000’s Census sketch. Was this episode considered “Fan service” to those who wanted her to host? Maybe. For me personally as a TV fanatic, I’d like to see this as a well-deserved victory lap for a TV Icon who has logged more than enough camera time. And as Ms. White closes in on the Century mark (we hope), there’s still more camera time for her to log.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nINTRODUCING NASIM PEDRAD – Let’s get the history making stuff out of the way, she was the show’s first (and so far ONLY) person of Iranian descent to make it to the cast; but that’s 2nd to the fact that she’s probably one of the more underappreciated cast members of recent years; her first year—as is the case with MANY Featured players since the dawn of time—was a little subdued, but she still managed to hit the ground running by trashing on the Kardashians long before it became the hip thing to do, as well as co-promoter of the Kickspit Underground Festivals just to name a few (Including one other we’ll mention below). She also has the Rare distinction of making her SNL debut before the season formally started (by a few days) when she did an impression of Kathy Griffin in a “WU Thursday” piece (UNAVAILABLE).\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT’S EPISODE (11/7/09) – Just a few years before she became vastly overrated, Swifty was actually kinda charming—then again, this was right after Yeezy “Made that B*** Famous” thanks to his VMA hijacking, so perhaps this was less a charm offensive and more Damage control at the time. That’s a shame, because she actually did pretty well as a sketch performer here—and in recent years as an MG only, she’ll still pop up in a sketch or two, giving us a sliver of hope that she will one day do Double Duty again. Favorite sketches from this show include Swift adopting a mess of Cornrows to participate in one of Kenan’s criminally underrated “Scared Straight” sketches, this piece where all the orthodontia in the world couldn’t keep Swift from doing a PSA about Embarrassing parents driving teens around, and Nasim’s other highlight in “Roomies” where she & Swift send up just how “Clingy” best friends can be sometimes.\n\nHAMM & BUBLE (1/30/2010) – I mentioned this one years ago on a page that if I have to slap myself to remind me that I need to update it, so help me I will…But I’ll summarize. When Jon Hamm first hosted in 2008, he gave us an ad parody that nobody knew they needed, but turned out to be one of the more memorable pieces of that episode; that of “Jon Hamm’s John Ham”—a Toilet paper roll made out of Ham for those times when you’re doing your business but you just HAVE TO have some Ham…it made about as much sense as it sounded, but it still worked. But if “John Ham” was the “Thriller” of Ham-based pun sketches, allow me to re-introduce you to the “Smooth Criminal” of the Genre; as Hamm ropes in MG Michael Buble to promote a restaurant that sells Only Ham & Champagne (or “Bubby”) related items…much to Buble’s increasing talk-singing horror; which, quite honestly is the better half of the sketch versus Hamm’s increasingly antagonizing psychosis; which, don’t get me wrong, is also funny—but perhaps fear is funnier.\n\nSTEFON’S UPDATE DEBUT (4/24/10) – Before you freak out, I put this in the Honorable section out of fairness to others; besides, his Update debut happened very Late in the season, And I already went to great lengths talking about the character once already. One thing I Will add, however, is just how inexplicable it was to see this character come back after its debut nearly 2 years earlier…Little did we know how big it would become from this one appearance. Of course, All the success of Stefon would be incomplete were it not for John Mulaney—who happened to make several Special Commentaries at the Update desk this year.\n\nSo………yeah, maybe this season wasn’t as bad as I (and others) once thought it was, despite its flaws…Just like I hope turning 35 in the real world will turn out to be; a few problems here and there, but ultimately enjoyable……………Maybe I was wrong about this new “Trilogy”, after all, a lot of these things happened a long time ago, and the reactions a lot of us had back then might’ve been too “Knee-jerky” and made us miss the good over the bad. I mean, I’m glad Hindsight is being kind today, but let’s be real, sometimes it’s best to save the worst for last, no matter what order you go in. If not because I wanted to end on a high note, but also so I can avoid paying therapy bills by getting these memories un-repressed…\n\nIN 2 WEEKS: I’m going to save my list of Season 30 Silver Linings for Thanksgiving Weekend; partly because, (1) I’m in Holiday Mode at my workplace and I’m gonna be busy, and (2) what better time than then to cut into a Turkey.\n\nRICK LUDWIN\n\n1948 – 2019\n\nGolden Boy\n\n(*SIGH*) I was really looking forward to taking the Entire month off. I was gonna catch up on some Z’s, get my new computer all configured, even plan out the details for a Podcast I was hoping to launch in Late Spring/Early Summer (more on that later…like, Several weeks later). But sure enough; with there being a looming winter lull, as well as the fact that no host has been announced for SNL’s January 19th return, It’s only fair for there to be SOMETHING to write about at a time when everything slows to a crawl.\n\nEnter our old friend Andy Samberg, who I’m not going to waste too much time talking about because we already know how he & his “Lonely Island” friends helped give SNL a much needed boost in relevancy in 2005 and beyond. Nor am I going to dwell on the fact that although (most of) his Digital Shorts are a part of Pop Culture Lore (Including an Emmy Win for “D*** in a Box”), his Live performances leave little to be desired. Nor will I re-point out the fact that he & his show “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” both have 2014 Golden Globes to their name (To say nothing of him co-Hosting This year’s Globes alongside the eternal goddess that is Sandra Oh this Sunday, so I guess this counts as a shameless plug for it). Despite Samberg’s improvements in the years since he left the show, I still have the sense that Lorne & Co. will be going the “Safe” route for this episode…a little TOO suspiciously safe if you ask me. Considering all the blandness we’ve had to put up with during this season, It could’ve gone either way\n\nAndy Samberg/St. Vincent – Original Airdate: May 17th, 2014\n\nSOLANGE & JAY-Z: Always nice to see Jay’s…uh…Jay, even if nothing changes, it’s still a good impression. Sasheer does most of the heavy lifting as Solange (sufficiently well, too), and Kenan also does a surprisingly good job—though he barely says anything (a Plus?).The re-dubbing of the TMZ Video was the funnier part, but once again, Bobby does what he’s been doing all year & steals scenes like the best of them………And then (*GRITS TEETH*), Maya Showed up—largely to plug her Variety Special without actually plugging it, and any/all hope I had for this being a strong opening took a nosedive faster than (INSERT “BEYONCE” RELATED PUN HERE). It’s been a while since I’ve seen her Beyoncé impression, but I don’t recall it having so many Maya-isms (I.e. That over-exaggerated voice she has when she “Sings”). I really hope Maya’s appearance here is not a harbinger of things to come. Also, blah, blah, blah, Group LFNY, blah, blah blah. I still have no problem with them, so why complain? Though on a plus note, this is Sasheer’s 2nd LFNY in a row, so that has to be an encouraging sign for her future.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10 times I would’ve put a ring on it (Would’ve been more if not for the presence of you know who).\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: It did not. Sasheer’s tenure on the show would be “Quiet” at best…but that’s another story. Watching this sketch again begs the question, how long can it be until a sketch becomes outdated. Yes, the whole Jay-Z/Solange Elevator incident was big news when this aired; but in the 5 years since it happened, all is well in Carter/Knowles land (that we know of). Besides, having a Becky with the Good hair serve Lemonade seems to be more important these days……I think……and that was a mere 3 years ago. Also, that “Variety Special” Maya was there to plug turned out to be a Summer Pilot for the short lived “Maya & Marty”…speaking of whom…\n\nMONOLOGUE: Part of the reason why I was concerned about Samberg hosting is pretty much glossed over in the line “I did 100 Digital Shorts, and 6 Live Sketches!” Fortunately, because of the rapid fire nature of the Monologue, maybe I can forgive the fact that he’s so awkward when he’s Live. The brief Timberlake joke was OK, if not a throwaway. I can’t get too excited about a Seth cameo, considering he’s on TV 5 NIGHTS A WEEK (seriously SNL, have you EVER heard of the word “Overkill”?). But for the most part, he was just there to read cards, so I have no beef with him showing up. The impressions themselves were so rapid fire, I had to re-watch it several times to pinpoint which were my favorites (I liked his Travolta, Reynolds/Carrey, Beetlejuice, Smokey/Pharrell & Bin Laden). But then, much to my delight, “Unstopa-BILL” shows up; and even in the brief time he was there, it felt like all things were right with the world once again. Then, Martin Short (The Hell?!) shows up with roses. All in all, a strong “multi-logue (Patent Pending)” that doesn’t require singing, and I enjoyed it greatly.\n\nSCORE: 8 out of 10 Rich Littles.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Ah, NOW The Martin Short cameo makes a Lot more sense knowing he was gonna be a part of Maya’s show…though we didn’t know it at the time…still a somewhat rando cameo, but at least there’s some logic behind it. Also of note, this would be the Very last time we hear Don Pardo introducing the show until his passing later that summer…but not the last time we would hear him this episode.\n\nCAMP WICAWABE: Because what better time to introduce new characters than the last show of the year? But to be fair, this actually looks kinda promising. In fact, it looks Really Promising—like “Characters that aren’t one-note” promising. Just like Aidy, Kate & Mooney, it’s cute, adorable & harmless…probably a little TOO cute for the show, but at least cute & adorable is different than cut & paste. Aidy played it straight for the most part, but Kate especially reminds me of a cross between a Far Less Hyper “Judy Miller” and Laraine Newman as her “Child Psychologist” character from long ago…only less “flexible”. Could’ve done without Samberg’s “Condom” story, but they made up for it with the “Campers who left us Early” part. I can easily see this becoming recurring, but only if they can come up with a different angle than just doing it at a summer camp.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 bottles of Deep Woods OFF.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: This actually had all the earmarks for this to be the next in a long line of SNL recurring characters…but then, something strange happened in 2014 that has carried on to present day. With very rare exceptions & at the Update desk, the show has had NO major recurring characters for a long time. Perhaps they started to realize—several years too late—that the show actually didn’t NEED to pander to its audience with repetition…unless of course you’re Bill Hader, then you can print up all the Stefon T-Shirts you want (Kidding). Still though, old School SNL fans would’ve probably sniffed this out as a character in the making from miles away; it kinda reminded me of a hybrid of Wayne’s World and Wake up Wakefield with a dash of Muppet Babies…and yet, it was only done one time. Go figure.\n\nWHEN WILL THE BASS DROP?: It feels Weird to review a Digital Short once again after so long, especially since there have been so many different kinds of styles of short films this year alone. Truth be told, I was hoping there would be some kind of brawl between Samberg’s “Lonely Island” and Beck & Kyle’s “Good Neighbor”, but there’s always next time (I hope). True to form, Samberg & the rest of the Island hasn’t missed a beat (No pun intended), though I gotta wonder if Samberg took a little inspiration from This Richard Pryor Classic. Nevertheless, Samberg put his own spin on it. Remember a while ago on the 2014 Charlize Theron review when I said that I found Unexpected Blood funny? Well, this one seemed to have gone a little too far despite it being only 20 seconds (Though thumbs up for Lil’ Wayne showing up AND a well-placed “Raiders” joke). The real comedy, of course, is the buildup leading up to the punchline, and for the most part, it was silly stuff—Frying an Egg, Sand Sculpting & Playing with a train set seem to have stuck out the most for me. In the interest of full disclosure, I’ve only been to clubs a handful of times; but it’s just enough time to realize that they captured the mood of the sketch perfectly.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 Glowsticks.\n\nCONFIDENT HUNCHBACK: Sketches like this are the reason why Samberg was better at the Filmed material than he is at Live sketches (With Some exceptions). Not that this was “Terrible”, but something tells me this might have been a better sketch if it were someone else as the hunchback. The two good parts were Samberg trying on a Fedora, and Aidy being intrigued by Samberg’s junk (Speaking of which, is it me, or has Aidy been doing a lot of “Freaky” things in sketches this year? No complaints or anything, I just never expected her to be the Kinky one of the cast). I almost expected Samberg to break into a chorus of “Jizz in my Pants” when he had his scene with Cecily, but that would’ve been too obvious. The last second ending with the ladies playfully surrounding Samberg makes absolutely no sense considering most of them spend the sketch rejecting him…but to be fair, the ladies Do look good in 15th century garb.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10 bouts of Scoliosis.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nCecily’s Best: Prom Night.\n\nColin’s Best: Worried Feet (Just for the “Below The Belt-ness” of it), Capital Wheel, Daytime Dance Party.\n\nCommentaries:\n\n*This was the 2nd appearance of “Bruce Chandling”—the first one happening 9 months earlier on that season’s premiere; and even more hard to believe, they actually thought it was worth giving a second chance. I recall calling this a bit that Fred Armisen would do in terms of how awkwardly bad it is, But then I started looking up Kyle’s earlier versions of the character on YouTube. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this is really more Andy Kaufman-esque than it lets on. It’s probably going to take me a little bit more time to fully “Get” this character, but thanks to the YouTube clips, I can understand it a little better without rolling my eyes in annoyance (Unlike anything Fred has ever done).\n\n*As much as I‘m not a big fan of Samberg’s “Nicholas Cage”, this actually was a welcome sight to see; especially when Paul Rudd comes back to continue to make up for lost time during all 3 of his hosting gigs. The bit itself is OK, with Samberg doing most of the work while Rudd is there for the Ride (“I’m gonna Teabag the Magna Carta” is Already an internet meme).\n\n*But then…that’s it? Doesn’t “Update” tend to go out bigger than that for the finale? Some kind of piece involving all the “Update All-Stars” or something? (*CRICKETS*) No? OK, Weak finish, Moving on…\n\nJOSTWATCH: I know I said I wasn’t going to make a fair judgment until After his first Full Season ends in 2015, but Good Lord! Does this guy need a tune up over the summer! I’ll give him credit for getting his delivery down, but as a co-head writer for the show, he Really needs to make sure the words that are coming out of his own mouth are funny ones. I don’t know if it was just end-of-the-year burnout on his end, but Colin barely had anything funny tonight. Perhaps he should spend the summer looking for other comedy influences instead of being fed through the umbilical cord of 8H all the time, hopefully by the fall, he’ll be recharged. But for now, he’s simply the One Calorie Diet version of Seth Meyers.\n\nAnd for the heck of it, one Last CECILYWATCH (as of when I first wrote this): I don’t need to offer any more advice for her to improve her performance, Either at the Update Desk or in the rest of the show (Not that she reads this anyway). Instead, I offer a caveat for the rest of her tenure of her show. Whatever you do, Please TRY Not to let your newfound fame get to your head. Otherwise, you will fall into the same traps that befell Kristen Wiig, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph & Molly Shannon once they started getting “Too” popular; You’ll do hammy, over the top sketches that will make us Forum users cringe, yet somehow you’ll still be lauded by the over-coked applause of the studio audience, and also the “Bullseye” section of Entertainment Weekly. In all seriousness, there is no shame in being yourself, try not to believe your own hype, and I hope you can keep yourself in check in the years to come.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10 KSNV’s (NBC in Las Vegas)\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, about that advice for Cecily…seems as though she made good friends with a guy named Anderson in passing years, so to hell with what I just said right now…Stupid hindsight! At least Jost has improved a great deal since then…also, the fact that he’s now been an update Anchor for 5 seasons makes me feel older for some reason. Also, also, this would turn out to be the very LAST sketch of any kind that would feature the late Don Pardo’s voice—prerecorded or otherwise—and Jost’s name in the WU intro was the last that he mentioned. Not quite the same impact as Walt Disney mentioning Kurt Russell’s name before he died, but pretty close I would assume.\n\nVOGELCHECKS: (*HEADDESK MULTIPLE TIMES*) Take it away, Bill Paxton! I honestly have nothing to say, and yet I’m saying things right now—that’s how pissed I am that they would do this. The Saddest part of it all was the fact that the Audience is actually Buying it Hook, Line & Sinker–almost as though they were threatened to laugh at everything, or else they’d level Manhattan with a flood. Sketches like this, and ESPECIALLY the audience’s reaction to it, perplex me the most; How and/or Why the Hell is this Funny to Them, Yet it’s absolute shit to the rest of us? I can only blame it on New York City Tap Water for so long, there Has to be a more Reasonable explanation. Add to that, the fact that the 3-headed Hellhound of Wiig, Rudolph and (For Christ Sake!) Armisen show up, and we’re in for a world of hurt. Not even an Armisen driven flub or the pale irony of watching the Michael Sam kiss, or the aforementioned hellhound using their kissing “skills” to make a chain reaction CPR revival on Kate can make me crack a grin at this. Not now, Not Ever! I’m also genuinely curious as to whether or not Samberg himself Requested doing this sketch. If so, he just lost a Hell of a Lot of Respect from me (Not that one person makes a difference, but still.). To everybody out there reading; if you don’t drink any booze, this might be the perfect time to start. At least that way, it’s a step in the right direction in thinking “What God awful Kissing Sketch?” Sorry to go off on a tear, but if you’re a regular reader at this forum, you’ll quickly understand why we hate this sketch so much (And Trust me, I’m NOT the Only one who feels this way about it). My one Regret is that I can’t give a score of a Zero…but DAMN do I want to right now… (*OPENS BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS, CHUGS IT “BLUTO” STYLE…AGAIN*) Moving……….ON!\n\nSCORE: 1 out of 10 tubes of Chapstick.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: (*SIGH*) Look, I could push the JERRY BUTTON til the cows come home on this one, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. This sketch is one of those types that “Everybody” seems to like, and yet it rubbed certain other fans the wrong way…And I’m not even talking about the dormant homosexuality aspect of it. No, this is more of the notion that “They Kiss…and that’s the joke!” and just how LAZY the sketches themselves are. Sure, they do at least attempt a variation on things with the then controversial Michael Sam reference (currently playing football in Montréal if you were wondering), but then they get back to the kissing and any attempt for something “Interesting” to happen here is rendered pointless. Now, if this was the First and Only time this sketch was done, MAYBE I’d be singing a different tune knowing that they wouldn’t do this again—but this was the SIXTH time they did this sketch…Seven times too many—and for those wondering, that’s also the reason why this didn’t make the cut on my “Worsts” list, they technically count as recurring characters. On a lighter note, my dislike for this sketch wouldn’t last too long; and if Chris Rock ever hosts again some day I’ll be happy to tell you why.\n\nKIMYE: So, How sad a state of affairs must things be in that a Kimye Sketch is (by default) BETTER than the abomination we just saw? It almost seems like an afterthought. Even though it’s the Same Kimye sketch as before, the fact that it comes on after what shall not be named is actually a blessing in disguise. Jay’s Kanye is actually getting a little better (despite a minor flub on his Tuxedo line), Nasim’s voice is still over-exaggerated, Taran’s Bruce (at the time) Jenner was worth exactly a chuckle or two, and Samberg was simply there to list a number of “Wacky” things. Also, IF this is—in fact—Nasim’s last sketch as a cast member, at least I have a lasting, positive memory of her…Putting the sketch on “Mute”, and basking in the eye candy of her in that low-cut dress. It’s my reward for suffering through the sketch that shall not be named.\n\nSCORE: 5 out of 10 Autotuning Soundboards I will give to Kanye as a Wedding Present.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Sure enough, this turned out to be Nasim Pedrad’s last SNL sketch before either leaving the show on her own terms over the summer of ‘14 or getting released from her contract so she could do John Mulaney’s failed sitcom. This also turned out to be the last sketch that an up and coming comedian named Michael Che wrote for the show before joining the crew of The Daily show for about 42 seconds…and we all know what happened after that.\n\nHUGS: Another Digital Short? Well, anything to Save face after The sketch that shall not be named (Sorry, I’m Still Incredibly Angry about it). This one was somewhat lighthearted despite having the Lonely Island’s trademark “Edge” to it. Is that Jorma on camera with Samberg at long last (I’m sure somebody will fill me in)? Pharrell’s cameo was a welcome surprise, but Maya’s appearance as Oprah was the complete opposite. The song itself was just OK, far from the Viral hits of yesteryear, but it’s your standard “Lonely Island”; Rapid Fire Beats & Imagery that despite it being “Comedy”, kinda verges on it being lost in translation and disguising itself as an actual music video. I’d also like to think this was the show’s way of giving me a hug after viewing…….you know what. Like I said, Samberg & Co. has not missed a beat in making these shorts, and this one—though corny—is no exception.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 cuddle parties.\n\nLEGOLAS AT TACO BELL: Another staple of Samberg’s is the “Micro-sketch”; Y’know, the ones with a simple premise that takes less than 2 minutes to tell, doesn’t overstay it’s welcome, and yet, it’s weirder than anything the show would usually do…This one was no exception. There’s not really much to say about it considering how short it is, except it delivers on its promise. It’s Legolas at Taco Bell, he confuses the hell out of Jay’s character, and Bobby makes his only other appearance of the night…and he STILL manages to Steal the scene as Gimli (Though to be fair, at first glance I thought it was Zach Galifinakis). It’s short, it’s sweet, and it proves that “Less is More” despite it still being a strange sketch.\n\nSCORE: 8 out of 10 Gorditas.\n\nBLIZZARD MAN & 2CHAINZ: Of all the “Live” characters Samberg has ever done, this one is definitely the goofiest in his repertoire. 2Chainz showing up was completely random, but still an interesting surprise. Unfortunately, despite Samberg being as White bread as ever in his rapping, this one was unusually weak, especially when Kenan does his 576th Buggy-eyed performance of his career to little avail, and the Newspaper headline at the end did little to help. The one thing that I (surprisingly) did like about this one was 2Chainz’s energy & performance. If he didn’t seem destined for “Flash in the Pan” status, I wouldn’t have minded seeing him host. Otherwise, we Know the Joke, and nothing new has been added to it…but since it’s been a few years, I’ll give it a marginal pass.\n\nSCORE: 5 out of 10 “North Face” Winter coats I wear to perfect my “Street” look.\n\nBVLGARI WATCHES: For all the complaining we do about sketches that run themselves into the ground, this is one of the few that I really don’t mind seeing over & over…and Yes, I’ll actually forgive the fact Wiig is in this one, but just this once. As usual, the combination of non-sequiturs, mispronounced words (my favorite was “Cleomidia”), and words that are meant for a Late Time Slot is what fuels this. Of course, what makes this different each time is what the pornstars’ guests say why they’re there…and is it me, or are some of these guest stories becoming increasingly ridiculous? Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they ditched the “And to my Teacher who never thought I would make it…” line, but something about a Siamese porn actor made me use my imagination…and a not-so-good way. Regardless, by itself, this was the usual enjoyable sketch. But since this is the last sketch of the year, forgive me for saying this was a disappointing way to end it.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10 prescriptions of Valtrex\n\nFINAL SCORE: 72 out of 120 (60% WATCHABILITY)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: This show would’ve actually been a pretty good one…………….If it weren’t for the God damned, (*38 MINUTES WORTH OF PROFANITY CENSORED, LATER…*) VOGELCHECKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111!!!!ZOMG (*PASSES OUT*)\n\n(*STAGEHAND THROWS WATER BUCKET ON EDITOR, SNAPS OUT OF IT*) The guy was dead when I got here, I swear…Wha…oh right, the show. (*DEEP BREATH, SPEAKS CALMLY THROUGHOUT*) OK…That ONE Unfortunate lapse in judgment on whoever wrote that sketch aside; the rest of the show was, in fact, somewhat decent. If it were a regular show during any other part of the year, it would certainly be above average—perhaps somewhere in the top 5 for Season 39. But this is a Season Finale, this is an episode where enough momentum needs to be made so that we have something to look forward to for the next year; which happened to be the 40th anniversary of the show, no less, So there’s a very slim margin of error made available in order to maintain that momentum. To its credit, The show Did start out Very Strong. But then it suffered greatly from an “Update” that felt like eating Styrofoam Toast, another Kimye sketch with a not-so-subtle saving grace, and the……(*SUPRESSES ANGER*) “You know who’s” and their never-ending affection that would be enough to put ipecac out of business. Thankfully, the remaining 3rd of the show pulled it from the brink, and what could’ve turned out to be a disastrous show, actually turned out to be passable instead (When it should’ve been “Great” all along if those particular sketches were replaced with something else).\n\nOK, now that I’ve got that out of the way, we now resume our Hiatus in Progress; Still coming back in February, but now I have a pretty good idea what I’m going to be returning with once we do come back…and I’ll give you a hint; this guy below is a small part of it…\n\nMM: Human Prozac\n\nBefore we actually get to the subject of this list, I think the time has come to be a little “personal” with some of you—my only word of warning is that you Bear With Me on this story, because there will eventually be a happy ending…That said; All the way back in Blog entry #1, I had made a passing mention that I have been working in various aspects of Radio for the better part of my adult life. I’ve been a DJ, a Producer, a Program Director, a Music Director, a Creative Services/Imaging Director, and ultimately a guy who does commercials for a living for a major company whose name I’m not going to mention…but it hasn’t been like that for all these years in a row.\n\nIn 2008, I get the opportunity to take my services to a radio station in the Boston area—being a born & bred Yankees fan, the experience was pretty intimidating enough; but over the next few years, I learned to adapt to life around New England, as well as being able to do my job in an environment that I wasn’t familiar with. I roll with whatever punches are thrown at me; and for the most part, I was living what I thought was a normal “Adult” life…………….And then, New Year’s Day of 2011 happened (give or take a few days). When I got in, one of my bosses asked me to come into his office; when I got there, I noticed that not just my boss (the Program Director) was in the room, but so was the General Manager and the Operations Director (read: the Finance guy). They begin to tell me that the station was going to be undergoing a format change to something that I actually had expertise in; Classic Hits (their previous format was “Light” music, AKA, “Audio Chloroform”). While that news excited me, the next piece of news absolutely gutted me—they then told me that in spite of all of the hard work that I put in there over 3 years, my services were to no longer be required by them.\n\nIn short, I got fired for the first time. To that point, I had exactly 3 jobs in my lifetime, and the first two I left because of the next opportunity being better than the last. But this was the first time IN MY LIFE no less, that I was full-fledged FIRED from my job…seemingly for no reason other than “Change for Change sake”. In fact, after I went home to my apartment that day, my IMMEDIATE thought was a famous quote that Harry Shearer said when he was fired from SNL under Dick Ebersol; citing “Creative Differences”, Shearer made the famed quip “I was Creative, they were different”…But before I could make that reflection, I pretty much went through the “5 Stages of Death”, but with a Workplace twist—First, I couldn’t believe that they would let me go despite actually doing (what I thought was) a reasonable job for them; to which they say that the decision was made “a long time ago”; Bullshit, but whatever. Next, I started getting angry about the whole thing; not in a “I’m gonna set the building on fire” kind of thing, but just enough to seethe and raise further questions—they just repeated that I was no longer required to work there. Next came fear…or in my case, breaking down in that office with choked up tears. My ex-bosses, in all their infinite wisdom, try to assure me that this would be for the best and that things like this happen all the time in a lot of walks of life—which is true to a point, but that just felt like rubbing salt in a wound at that juncture. The “Bargaining” step was made for me when they offered One Month’s Severance, and the “acceptance” step was me choking down my last tears to say to my bosses with as little emotion as possible, “Give me a Box, and Give me an hour”. I packed all my office knick-knacks up, and I left…unsure of what my next move would be…or where it would even take place.\n\nThe Next 3 years of (relative) unemployment would be one of the most harrowing experiences in my life…but the first 5 Months of that were probably the most unbearable period. Without getting too deep, let’s just say that the process of being approved for unemployment money AND Moving back to my home state was enough to hand-pluck all the hairs from my head. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to wait for/the experience to get another radio job, so I had very little choice but to live on the governmental dime for a little bit WHILE getting ready to move back home. On top of that, my car had been experiencing one problem after another; Leaky Radiator, failing alternator, snapped serpentine belt, fuel pump leak, Oxygen sensor malfunction, blown wiper blade motor—ALL Within the first 2 of those 5 months, and with little/no money to get things done. Fortunately, the unemployment money eventually kicked in—retroactively, no less, so that I’d have a decent cushion, and my problems were temporarily over…but I still felt miserable…VERY miserable, like “Bojack Horseman without the drugs or booze” miserable. Short of being forced to move back to New York, nothing really motivated me to do much of anything…I was faced with a situation that countless others have experienced before, but the fact that this was happening for the first time in my life just left me with a lot of anger, confusion, and frequent lunch stops/moments of reflection at my local Wendy’s.\n\nFast forward to May 2011; I’ve since moved back home and I have absolutely no idea what to do next, nor did I have much of a reason why I would even want to wake up each day. So whenever I get really depressed and I don’t want to add on to my waistline, I watch a lot of comedy movies and TV shows to help get my mind off of things. Mostly “classic” stuff; Gleason, Burnett, Sid Caesar, anything Norman Lear ever penned, and of course SNL—though more the earlier years than anything “Recent”; by this point in time, the show was trying to make up some lost ground after a dismal 35th year. But still, I watched the new stuff anyway because it remained one of the few constants in my life that would never fail me no matter how bad I was feeling or how bad the show was at the time. And for whatever reason, I really started gravitating towards the appearances Bill Hader would make as “Stefon”—The character itself would make a number of appearances long before my troubles began, but back then I just thought the pieces were just “OK”; nothing earth shattering, but still good enough to crack a grin……………But then came the Mother’s Day show that year, and the simple utterance of the word “SPICY!” I honestly can’t describe the chemical reaction behind it, but the moment Hader said “Spicy” the way that he did (followed, as usual, by Hader trying to keep it together), it garnered probably the biggest laugh that I have experienced in a very long time; it just felt incredibly satisfying to watch after being in an emotional pit for so long. Not only was I hooked on the character, but I would start feeling a little better about myself every time it was on—so much so, that not too long after that show aired, I decided to go back to college to complete my Bachelor’s degree after a lengthy hiatus.\n\nIt may seem a little hyperbolic to say that “Stefon” saved my sanity at that point, but the misery that I went through during those first few months was something I was more than willing to forget—and there are probably some parts that I left out on purpose either because I’ve repressed the shit out of them, or because they were moments that I wanted to forget. But any time Stefon was on the air during the next few years while I was going for my degree, it acted as a much needed shot in the arm whenever I needed to finish up an assignment, or if I just needed to smile a little extra. Stefon not only saved my sanity, but as you’ll see later in this list, He and I also “Graduated” around the same time; Both a little older and wiser, but more importantly; after giving me a lot of much needed laughs, I felt like I could take on the world again—after graduation and finding some odd jobs in the year after, I FINALLY got back into Radio in 2014, and I haven’t looked back since…and all because of “SPICY!” and the ability to laugh again…and If Bill Hader happens to find this blog by accident, I hope he realizes just how much the character meant to me—and I’m sure Millions of others—through the years, especially the rough ones…Thank you, Bill.\n\nNow that I’ve got that off my chest, let me further remind you why Stefon Zolesky-Meyers is my favorite SNL character, and Bill Hader is one of my favorite SNL people…\n\n…I’ve still got a job to do here, though. Just because it’s my favorite character doesn’t mean that it was “Perfect”…\n\nHIS MOST RECENT APPEARANCE (3/17/2018) – Mojo labels this appearance as the character’s “Return”, but as you’ll see later on, the character has actually “Returned” a number of times, Including when Hader hosted in 2014. Nevertheless, I’ll let that slide since it was as funny as ever, including some instant classic one-liners, (“Moonlight, La La Land…”) and an ample use of a surprise Mulaney appearance. It didn’t miss a single beat. Maybe it’s because of how “recent” this was that Mojo ranks it at the bottom, but that’s understandable.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 0\n\nSTEFON’S DEBUT (11/4/2008) – Now, if I’m going to be REALLY Honest, the first time the party boy made an appearance in sketch form, not only did I not quite “Get” the piece, but this also happened to air during a highly questionable time in SNL’s history. One where it seemed that every couple of weeks, there would be at least One sketch that had either inwardly or overtly Homosexual themes attached to it (*PUSHES “JERRY” BUTTON*). I will always be “Not Gay, but Supportive”, but it always kinda struck me odd that it would happen at critical mass around this time on the show—then again, this was also the year of the infamous “Prop 8” vote in California, so I guess I could see why they threw around a lot of Pro-Gay moments—no matter how poorly written they were. As for this sketch, I could kinda see why casual and Die-hard fans alike might’ve had a little trouble figuring this out the first time; but thanks to Hindsight, it’s really no different than any of the other appearances. Granted; the weirdness is there, but because Mulaney isn’t there to change the words on the cue cards at the last second, it feels like just another sketch—but at least the seeds of greatness were being planted here; so on that note, I give this one a Push because hindsight is fickle and nobody really knew what was coming next.\n\nMOJO: 1\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nSTEFON & ZOOLANDER (10/8/2011) – Speaking as someone who has always been “On The Fence” when it comes to Ben Stiller (Especially as an SNL Alum), I’ll be sure to give him a much needed dissection when the time is right; but for now, the fact that he would bring back a character that nobody heard from in 10 years was a bigger moment than any of the oddities that came out of Hader’s mouth that night. On the surface, Pairing Stefon with Zoolander makes all the sense in the world; “Vapid male model meets Party Boy, Hilarity ensues”, THAT should’ve been the Zoolander sequel instead of whatever convoluted mess they came up with—in fact, it wouldn’t surprise me if this appearance kickstarted the long dormant talk of making said disappointing sequel, so thank God for Small favors (I think?). Two things made Stiller’s appearance work better than it was supposed to; the location where his party was being held (SoWeHoBeLoHoboWo), and the fact that all proceeds benefitted a rather “Wordy” foundation whose name I won’t ruin here.\n\nMOJO: 2\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nHALLOWEEN (10/20/2012) – Speaking of Halloween, I could’ve sworn the “Sidney Applebaum” joke was Much later in the character’s run; but considering how both he and Seth Meyers don’t age, it’s pretty easy to lose track (Just checked, Mojo screwed up the date, this was in 2012, NOT 2010). By this point in the proceedings, we weren’t 100% sure if Hader was going to leave the show yet or not—as this was his 8th year. Watching this again—and also realizing that we’d get one more appearance before his send-off that year—this felt like watching a “Greatest Hits” compilation, featuring such “Everythings” like Nick Nolte & Gabana, HoboCops, Bark Ruffalo, Little Israel, Frasins (Raisins that look like Frasier), human (“Fun Sized”) piñatas, and of course…MY SON! (To say nothing of the “Slimer” story at the end); But the big highlight to me is that we get a rare change of pace where we actually get a little insight to how Stefon spends some of his private time, not to mention Seth actually wanting to tag along to one of the parties without using his girlfriend as an excuse. Perhaps this was a sign of growth yet to come?\n\nMOJO: 3\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nTHE ACTUAL RETURN OF STEFON (10/10/2014) – Conveniently enough, I already mentioned this moment a while back. But since they are talking about one specific moment from the appearance, let’s dive a little deeper into that. For those too young to remember, Dan Cortese was what one called “an Actor”. But not just any actor, one that David Spade once tried to convince Evander Holyfield beat down before he retired (the first time). When he wasn’t doing stuff for MTV “Sports”, he was also known for Gen-X baiting Burger King Commercials in the early 90s. The fact that his name was dropped by Stefon Three times that night must’ve given Cortese not just a spring in his step, but enough phone calls to realize; “Wait a minute, Who would be calling Me?” Considering Cortese’s most recent acting role was nearly 4 years ago as per IMDB; perhaps “Three” isn’t as a magic a number as we once thought, but I’m sure he felt good about himself that night anyway.\n\nMOJO: 4\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 1\n\n“SPICY!” (5/7/2011) – C’mon guys, I just wrote a monologue about the moment! One additional thing I WILL say, however, is that Mojo got the date wrong…again. They have it as 2013, NBC’s website has it as 2011, and the 2 second clip of him just saying “Spicy!” is also from 2011. Nevertheless, let’s look at specifics; it opened 6 years into the future (2017), run by Rabbi “Jew Diamond Phillips”, and has everything from Geishas to Subway Sleeping Bags to (probably) a record number of giggle breaks from Hader…maybe that’s why I enjoy the moment so much; because even professionals need to be human?\n\nMOJO: 5\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 1\n\nSETH’S LAST UPDATE (2/1/2014) – I’m not sure if this moment should’ve been included. Yeah, Stefon does show up, but so do a whole slew of guest stars; and they’re each trying to take advantage of what few seconds they have on camera. The moment really belongs more to Seth than it did to anybody else—and this is despite Hader stealing the scene, as is his right. Tough call, but I gotta give this the ‘ol “Thumb’s Sideways”; Stefon was only there to wish Seth well—give or take a joke or two.\n\nMOJO: 5\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 2\n\n“……..KEVIN?” (3/10/2012) – So many great lines in this moment; “Opened at gunpoint at a lady Foot Locker”, club run by Blow J. Simpson, The “Sunny D” Fridge Spiel, and so forth. But by this point in the proceedings, you could tell that there may/may not have been something going on between Stefon & Seth; Seth resisting, Stefon egging him on—This, of course, leads to “The Kiss”; as well as countless fanfic being launched that night—only for Hader & Mulaney to catch up with everybody (See #1). Otherwise, This was probably the character at its peak…almost. Brushing up on my Shales/Miller, there’s a bit about how when Mick Jagger hosted the same year, Seth couldn’t even get through his intro without the crowd going nuts—and rightfully so, the character not only gained a following, but it kept getting bigger right to the end of the original run and beyond.\n\nMOJO: 6\n\nBLOG: 0\n\nPUSH: 2\n\nTHE 40th ANNIVERSARY APPEARANCE (2/15/2015) – Another questionable inclusion; partly because SNL “Special” episodes (to me, anyway) are largely non-canonical, ESPECIALLY Anniversary shows—the few of them they had, anyway. That, and Edward Norton’s impression of Stefon just isn’t that great (in spite of Hader giving him pointers). I’ll give points for them carrying on with the idea that he & Seth are still “Married”, but this appearance was an otherwise extenuating circumstance.\n\nMOJO: 6\n\nBLOG: 1\n\nPUSH: 2\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\n“BOOOOOOFFFFFF” (2011) – I’m not sure if this is the first time a monosyllabic sound was used as the name of a club; but it must be significant enough to mention on the list. That aside, the name was just one funny part; but the club description didn’t disappoint either.\n\n“YOUR MOTHER AND I ARE SEPERATING” (2013) – This one I Really liked because of just how “out of left field” Hader gets with his sudden voice change—not unlike “Spicy”. Switch this with the appearance from the 40th, and we’ll be OK.\n\nMOJO: 7\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 2\n\n1.STEFON’S WEDDING (5/17/2013) – Like I said at the top, Stefon and I “Graduated” around the same time…Literally; He moved up on a Saturday, while I moved up on a Sunday. I didn’t really think about it much back then because in the midst of all the hoopla and still not sure what my next move would be, when the day was done, I still had to write a review about the episode I recorded the night before (One that has sadly been lost to time and digital negligence). But the fact that I got my degree within hours of Hader getting one of the more memorable send-offs in show history seems sort of poetic in a way; Stefon felt whole again after “marrying” Seth, I felt whole again after completing my education. As for the moment itself, it was as much a funny one as it was Rewarding for those who are not only fans of the show, but those who really keep track of everything; as in “This Wedding had EVERYTHING”: Practically Every bizarre thing that Stefon has ever listed at New York’s hottest clubs—so much so, that watching it over and over just to see if they left anything out is a task in itself. Otherwise, off the top of my head, there were Human Traffic cones, Human Fire extinguishers, ALF in a Trench coat, a Furkel (Fat Urkel), a Coked out Gremlin, Menorah the Explorer, DJ Baby Bok Choy, and yes…not only Anderson Cooper as the jilted groom, but even Ben Affleck as Stefon’s Brother from the first sketch. So great was this moment, that I’ll go one step further and say that this would probably have been better as a stand-alone sketch instead of just as an Update Piece—Like, maybe end Update with Stefon storming out, then wait a few sketches before picking up on Seth in his Dressing room thinking about Stefon, and THEN do the Psychotropic “Graduate” parody, build suspense a little. Still though; as much as I enjoy the character making a comeback every once in a blue moon, this was the perfect way to have ended the character on a regular basis, as well as one hell of a payoff for the fans…………..Now if only we found out what that damn Tree Frog study was all about.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n\nMOJO: 8\n\nBLOG: 2\n\nPUSH: 2\n\nRight about now, you’re probably thinking that covering a list this “Personal” would’ve been a good way to end our Summer of Nitpicking…but the Summer isn’t over until the Calendar says it is; and I did have ONE more topic to look at before we place a bookmark in the Mojo tome and close it up (for now). So, for next week’s Misplaced Finale, we’re going to invoke the name of an infrequently recurring sketch from back in the 70s and wonder……………“What if…?”\n\nMM: The Bonus Round\n\nLet’s move on to a lighter subject, as well as one of my favorite non-SNL subjects…Game Shows.\n\nAnd since this is another one of those lists where I need to compare notes on a previous list, we change the rules a little here. If any of Mojo’s picks wound up on My List, it’s immune from the “Blog” point since I would technically be agreeing with them, but the other two (Mojo or Push) are up for grabs. I also have a sneaky suspicion that there will be at least One “recurring” sketch in here, so we’ll deal with that as it comes. Now then, time for the lightning round…\n\nWWTBAM WITH STEVE HARVEY (4/24/2010) – Sort of a gray area on this one; after all, Kenan Thompson’s impression has been used a number of times since this aired, so you could argue that it’s recurring…But those performances are largely for the “Family Feud” sketches (which we’ll get to in a moment). In this case, he’s doing the impression for a show that–while it’s still on the air–reached peak popularity around 2002. Therefore, it’s OK to judge this on its own merits…and considering that this was very much based on the Real Harvey’s actual hosting skills during the time he filled in for then-host Meredith Viera c2010, I have to award them the point on accuracy alone.
