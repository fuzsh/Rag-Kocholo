        "text": "Ali Wong seems to be doing fine following her amicable divorce from her husband, Justin Hakuta (who got roasted in Wong’s stand-up sets harder than Nikki Glaser roasted Tom Brady). In fact, she’s dating and it’s already a topic of her stand-up set. For instance, during her recent 12-show residency at the Netflix Is a Joke festival, Wong joked about her eagerness to dive back into the dating scene with “just got out of prison energy.”\n\nHowever, before she could even begin exploring her options on a dating app, Wong received a surprise phone call from a man she had met at a dinner party in the past. The admirer, who had gotten her number from a mutual friend, confessed his long-standing crush on her and straight-up asked her to be his girlfriend.\n\n“He was like, ‘Hey, I just happened to hear the news about your divorce, and I’ve had a crush on you forever. I actually told my best friend years ago that you were my dream girl, and I know it sounds crazy but I want you to be my girlfriend.’”\n\n“I was like, ‘I just paid $25 (for a dating app),” Wong said. “You seem really nice, but I gotta get my money’s worth.’”\n\nHe remained persistent, however, leaving her flowers at each of her stops on a European tour. Her female friends thought it was sweet. Her male friends, however, thought the romantic gestures were evidence that he was a psychopath. Her male friends, she jokes, were just cheap and lazy and didn’t want those expectations put on them. “When a fellow man commits any act of kindness, any romantic gesture, it must be a symptom of an undiagnosed mental illness,” she joked.\n\nIn fact, despite the protestations of her male friends, Wong decided to give the man a chance. Then, in a fun reveal during her show, Wong invited her boyfriend, Bill Hader, onstage. He gave Wong a single rose and a hug. The two have been dating for about a year and a half.\n\nHader also revealed that he was the subject of a joke earlier in the set about a guy named Blake who was so unfamiliar with Chinese food that he filled everyone’s rice bowl with hot tea. “When I did that, the look on Ali’s face was a mixture of embarrassment and she was so stoked,” Hader joked. “She had this look on her face like, ‘You’re in the act, motherfucker.’”\n\nBased on the amount of detail she shared about her sex life with her ex-husband, Wong may soon have detailed stories to share about Hader’s large penis, as well, at least according to his ex, Rachel Bilson."
