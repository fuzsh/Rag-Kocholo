        "text": "Warner Bros. Animation is developing a new feature film adaptation of The Cat in the Hat and according to The InSneider, Bill Hader (Barry) is set to provide the voice of the title character. The project was announced years ago, but Hader is the first actor to become attached to the project. It’s kinda funny that Hader has been cast in the role because actually played The Cat in the Hat during a sketch on Saturday Night Live.\n\nAfter Warner Bros. canceled the Coyote Vs. ACME movie, I’m shocked that they are actually going to move forward with a Cat in the Hat movie. The last we heard about the movie is that it had been delayed, but it was previously set to be released in 2024.\n\nThere’s no release date for the film right now, though, but according to the report, the movie could hit theaters sometime in 2025.\n\nErica Rivinoja and Alessandro Carloni (Kung Fu Panda 3) are said to be co-directing the movie from a script written by Rivinoja and Caroline Williams (Arrested Development).\n\nDr. Seuss Enterprises CEO Susan Brandt previously said: \"For the first time we're not just doing one film for one book. We're going to franchise-build beyond the initial story of these books and find out what happens next. I call it stretching the fabric. How far can it go, to go a little bit deeper with our characters.\"\n\nSHe also said: \"For generations, Dr. Seuss has entertained and delighted children and adults alike with his whimsical tales.Our partnership with Warner Animation Group continues those efforts by reimagining the beloved characters and stories for theater-going audiences, while keeping the integrity of Dr. Seuss’s vision intact.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Bill Hader taking on the role of Cat in the Hat?"
