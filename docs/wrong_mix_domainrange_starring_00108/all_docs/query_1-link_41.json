Bill Hader is so kind and funny that sometimes I would think, are you an actual psychopath hiding out in sheep’s clothing? Rarely is someone as successful as him so humble. I had been auditioning for casting juggernauts Sherry Thomas and Sharon Bialy for nearly a decade without actually working with them. They were they at the table read for that final episode where Barry kills the character I played and I tried to thank them for believing in me all those years. They said, thank us when you’re a series regular and winning awards. A lot of the time, actors don’t receive outspoken support and belief from others. We actually get a lot of radio silence. Their belief lifted my spirits more times than I could ever count. #barry #hbo #season4 #actorslife\".",
