        "text": "Only yesterday on the plane,\n\nI was going through my old notes\n\nsection of my phone and I found a whole thing\n\non reasons not to do Thorpe (laughs)\n\n'Cause I was trying to find a reason not to do a job,\n\nbecause acting scares me so much.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nMaurice, I was in a very dark place,\n\nactually it wasn't dark because what I'd give up.\n\nI was writing and producing radio commercials\n\nand I was extremely happy doing it.\n\nAnd I wasn't interested in acting anymore.\n\nThen my agent, who I hadn't spoke to for months\n\nrang and said, Oh, they want to see you\n\nfor this Merchant Ivory film.\n\nAnd I said, no I can't be bothered.\n\nAnd my brother, who is a banker, very bossy,\n\nwho happened to be at home sick that day,\n\nI was living with him, said,\n\nDon't be ridiculous, you gotta go,\n\nyou need some money, I'm sick of paying for you.\n\nSo he made me sort of get dressed up,\n\nand I went and they were kind enough\n\nto like me, that was the first sort\n\nof propulsion into movies.\n\nI didn't know what to expect,\n\nit came out very well, sometimes say to me,\n\noh, were you worried about playing a gay role?\n\nAnd I wasn't at all, never sort of struck me\n\nas that was in any way difficult\n\nor dangerous or controversial.\n\nI remember the Venice Film Festival.\n\nThe world premiere of the film,\n\nI'm sitting next to James Wilby,\n\nJames Ivory, and Ishmael Merchant in the front row\n\nof the sort of circle and at the end of the film,\n\nthe audience really loved it.\n\nAnd they stood up and they clapped\n\nfor a long time, and then the tradition\n\nat Venice is that we the filmmakers stand up\n\nto accept the applause.\n\nWhat I had forgotten is that my suit was much too tight\n\nand I'd undone it, I'd undone my trousers\n\nquite early in the film, and I'd completely forgot\n\nto do them up, so it did look odd\n\nthat at the end of this gay film,\n\nI stand up, and bow solemnly to everyone,\n\nnext to my costar with my trousers undone.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nI got the script and I thought,\n\nwell there must be some mistake,\n\nmy agent has sent me a good script.\n\nSo I rang him up, and I said,\n\nI think there's been a mistake,\n\nyou've sent me a good script.\n\nHe did that once before, actually,\n\nwith Jerry Maguire, and I said, I think there's a mistake.\n\nAnd they said, yeah, sorry, that is is a mistake,\n\nthat was meant for Tom Cruise (laughs).\n\nWith Four Weddings, it was meant for me.\n\nAnyway, it was only an audition, and I went\n\nalong and I auditioned among the Muppets.\n\nThey were all around me.\n\nI remember thinking, it's going quite well.\n\nThe director looks like he likes me,\n\nbut the writer really hates me,\n\nthat was Richard Curtis, and he admits,\n\nhe did hate me, he had a completely different conception\n\nof that part; he'd written it in his own image,\n\nhe thought it was him and didn't think\n\nthat it should be someone who\n\nhe thought might get the girl,\n\nhe thought it should be more like him,\n\nmore kind of nerdish and glasses, anyway,\n\nhe had his arm twisted and I got the part.\n\nThe haircut became quite popular, yeah, with some,\n\nI always hated it.\n\nThe haircut and the clothes, the clothes\n\nare meant to be terrible,\n\nand the haircut's meant to be terrible.\n\nShortly before we stopped shooting that film,\n\none lunchtime, they said, okay, everyone,\n\nall the crew, into this room, we're gonna show you\n\nsome cut footage of what we've shot so far.\n\nIt was meant to be morale-boosting.\n\nAnd it played to sepulchral silence.\n\nNothing has ever been worse except for Rowan's bit,\n\nRowan's bit got a laugh, but the rest of it\n\nwas just abominable, and we all trudged back onto the set,\n\nbroken men and women, and we remained in that mood\n\nthrough finishing the film, through editing it,\n\nthrough the first look at it,\n\nwe just thought wow, we're all gonna have\n\nto go live in Peru, and then they had this screening\n\nin Santa Monica, in Los Angeles, and the audience loved it.\n\nIt's very odd, the speech pattern was very much written in,\n\nconvoluted syntax, if I were to ask you,\n\ncould you possibly ever see your way?\n\nI mean I'm not saying you would, but if you might,\n\nto falling in love with me?\n\nAll that stuff, that's Richard writing that stuff.\n\nAnd Mike Newell who directed that film\n\nwanted it even more messed up, he said, look,\n\nit'll be a disaster if you look smooth.\n\nSo you know, mess up the lines,\n\nand break them up, so I did all that.\n\nAnd then when that film was a success,\n\npossibly subliminally I let it bleed\n\ninto other parts which was a big mistake.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nSense and Sensibility.\n\nEmma Thompson adapted Sense and Sensibility.\n\nShe got Ang Lee to direct it,\n\nand they offered me that part.\n\nAnd I saw the part of Edward Ferrars\n\nand I said, well, he's a bit\n\nof a hesitant in-love Englishman,\n\nI don't think I should do that again.\n\nAnd they said, no, no, we know\n\nyou can do it very differently.\n\nSo I said, all right then,\n\nand then I did it exactly the same (laughs)\n\nAng Lee was, I think it was his first non-Taiwanese film,\n\nhe didn't, hadn't mastered yet the art\n\nof how to talk to British, and sensitive, British actors.\n\nI remember doing my first scene with Emma.\n\nAnd I thought we were marvelous.\n\nAnd we went up to Ang afterwards,\n\nwho's sitting there at the monitor, we said,\n\nWhat did you think, Ang, what did you think?\n\nAnd he went, Very boring.\n\nAnd that was very disheartening.\n\nAnd he famously said to Kate Winslet\n\nat the end of her first day's shooting,\n\nYou will get better.\n\nSo he was scary, but very charming.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nNotting Hill, the good will from Four Weddings\n\nwas dissappating fast, and Richard wrote\n\nthis other film and it was based on something\n\nthat actually happened to a friend of his\n\nwho was a kind of very un-famous bloke\n\nliving in Notting Hill who happened to fall in love\n\nwith an extremely, extremely word-famous person\n\nwho I'm not allowed to mention, and she with him.\n\nSo it was based on that, such an obvious idea\n\nfor a film I can't believe it's never been made before.\n\nAnd it just seemed like it was gonna be dynamite.\n\nAnd then they managed to persuade the then-biggest star\n\nin the world, Julia Roberts to do it,\n\nand then we managed not to screw it up too badly.\n\nAnd it was just obviously a mega hit\n\nat that moment, because it's really properly romantic.\n\nAnd that's the key to his films.\n\nThey're called dramatic comedies,\n\nand he actually is funny, the jokes are good,\n\nbut what's special is that they are genuinely romantic\n\nbecause he's a romantic.\n\nPoor old Richard was always in love\n\nand being rejected, all that's real.\n\nRather than fake, ersatz, kind of Hollywood romance.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nBridget Jones's Diary, you know,\n\nDaniel Cleaver's quite a sort of West London,\n\nsmooth, upper middle class.\n\nI don't know why they came to me.\n\nMaybe she thought I was right for it.\n\nAll the way through those fluffy films,\n\nFour Weddings, Notting Hill,\n\nit had amused Richard, his gang, his wife, everyone,\n\npeople thought I was that nice, fluffy character.\n\nBecause they knew I wasn't,\n\nI was much closer to, for instance, Daniel Cleaver.\n\nSo I think it was fun for them to then slop me\n\ninto a role that was closer to the real me.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nAbout a Boy, it's a novel by Nick Hornby,\n\nand a really good one, possibly it's slightly based\n\non himself, maybe, but I'd been sort of tracking it\n\nfor ages, and it was being made\n\nby a different company, and that director didn't want me,\n\nand then it got shifted over to the Whites brothers.\n\nAnd I met them, and we all got on really well,\n\nand they were making it, actually,\n\nwith De Niro's company, and I enjoyed that aspect of it,\n\nI loved hanging out with Bob,\n\nwe were going night clubbing with him.\n\nNo, I felt very cool doing that.\n\nThe boy in About a Boy needed to be someone nerdy,\n\na loser, someone who's gonna get bullied.\n\nAnd we found Nick, and he was a great actor,\n\nbut he was too good-looking, so we gave him a shit haircut,\n\nterrible clothes, but I see now, the dish has triumphed.\n\nHe's a massive star.\n\nWill, in About a Boy, is North London,\n\nhe's more demotic, trendy, cool,\n\nyou know, the clothes I had then were cool for that period.\n\nIt was a great part, and transforming for me,\n\nand what I've now realized, because you might not hear it\n\nor see it, but because I'm doing an accent in that,\n\nI'm really doing a performance that's much further\n\naway from me, it was very releasing\n\nand I'm much better when I'm doing that,\n\nthat's what's come home to me in the last five years.\n\nGet away from yourself, and I'm actually better.\n\nWhen you're being someone else,\n\nmoving like them, talking like them,\n\nit takes care of the self-consciousness problem.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nLove Actually?\n\nWell, the premise was really again written\n\nrather like Richard Curtis himself.\n\nSo when I read this, I thought,\n\nthis is gonna be a huge hit.\n\nBut I didn't really to be that same character again,\n\nI would get crucified.\n\nSo I said to Richard, can't it just be that guy\n\nfrom Notting Hill and from Four Weddings?\n\nAnd he said, no no no no no no, so it was quite different,\n\nyou know, much tougher and harder.\n\nI went, right, tougher, harder, yes yes yes.\n\nThen I just did exactly the same character (laughs)\n\nof Four Weddings and Notting Hill.\n\nThe dancing scene was a terrible cloud\n\nhanging over the whole production for me.\n\nYou know, it's hard enough to dance\n\nif you're English and middle-aged,\n\neven with six pints inside you,\n\nbut by yourself, so stone-cold sober,\n\nat seven in the morning, in front of a film crew.\n\nTo freak out was going to be misery.\n\nNot only that, but I thought the scene\n\nhad the capacity for being the most excruciating scene\n\never committed to celluloid.\n\nAnd there are plenty of people who still think it is.\n\nBut equally there are lots of people who seem to love it.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nCloud Atlas.\n\n[Interviewer] Could you explain the plot of Cloud Atlas?\n\nNo, no one could (laughs)\n\nIt's kind of slightly about reincarnation, as I recall.\n\nAll my people are vile.\n\nOut of the blue, the very cool Wachowskis\n\nwanted me to play five or six parts\n\nin this extraordinary, the biggest,\n\nthe most expensive independent film ever made.\n\nI went to meet them to see\n\nif it was some kind of joke on me,\n\nand it didn't seem to be.\n\nAnd I liked them a lot, so I did it,\n\nand you know, it seemed irresistible\n\nto play a cannibal from the 23rd century.\n\nAnd then I thought, well, I'm bound to be good at that.\n\nThat's cause I'm so fascinating.\n\nAnd I didn't really think about it too much\n\nuntil I was suddenly on a mountaintop in Germany,\n\nwith my teeth and my makeup, and my tattoos.\n\nAnd I thought, I have no idea how to do this!\n\nI had one of the Wachowskis saying, come on man,\n\nyou look at at him like you wanna fucking eat him,\n\nand I thought, I don't have that face!\n\nGive me a funny lie, I can do that.\n\nNot sure I was very good at the cannibal.\n\nBut I was quite good at some of the other parts.\n\nI think all actors like to be evil.\n\nI think because it smells true.\n\nI've got this horrible feeling, now I'm 57,\n\nthat we are evil and that our veneer of civilization\n\nand niceness is very, very thin.\n\nSo when you're allowed to be your true evil self\n\nit just sort of smells right and feels right,\n\nit's fun to play.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nFlorence Foster Jenkins, in Florence Foster Jenkins,\n\nI am half good, half bad,\n\nI'm a marvelously supportive husband\n\nand sort of manager to Meryl Streep,\n\nan increasingly deranged amateur singer.\n\nBut you're supposed to think,\n\nand I think people did think,\n\nwhat's his real motive, does he really love her?\n\nOr is he in it for himself?\n\nAnd hopefully people, you know, think both simultaneously.\n\nI certainly thought he was both.\n\nWhich I think is also very human.\n\nWe can be loving, unselfish and deeply narcissistic\n\nand selfish simultaneously, and that is what he was.\n\nMeryl's a very good singer in real life,\n\nand probably that's why she was able to be bad so well.\n\nSo she would sing badly\n\nand when she first demonstrated that,\n\nat one of the read-throughs, you know,\n\nI just thought, well that's genius,\n\nand it was incredibly funny, really makes you laugh.\n\nBut like all funny things, as you repeat them,\n\nyou laugh a little bit less, it's to be expected.\n\nShe knew that, and so sometimes\n\nif I was on camera watching her,\n\nand she was off camera, she'd just dial it up,\n\ndouble it to screw me up, make me laugh.\n\nShe was very good at that.\n\nAnd actors like playing actors,\n\nor people in show business, they think\n\nthis will be fascinating, but actually\n\nthe world hates actors quite rightly.\n\nThe key to that character, funnily enough,\n\nis the same key to the next film I did,\n\nPaddington 2, narcissism, they're all narcissists.\n\nI don't know why I keep getting offered these parts,\n\nbut anyway, that's incredibly human,\n\nwe're really just obsessed with looking out for ourselves.\n\nIt's certainly the key to Bayfield\n\nin Florence Foster Jenkins,\n\nhe was a crap actor, the real Bayfield,\n\nor at least very moderate, very mediocre,\n\nand yet dazzled by the limelight.\n\nJust, the limelight, the limelight!\n\nAnd he had therefore the same disease\n\nas Florence Foster Jenkins,\n\nwho was the world's worst singer.\n\nJust wanted to be onstage, Carnegie Hall,\n\neveryone looking at here.\n\nAnd you meet these people, they are very common in life.\n\nAnd anyway, that was definitely the curse\n\nof Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nPaddington 2.\n\nPaul King who wrote and directed it\n\nlikes to tell his story that he wrote a part\n\nof a washed up, narcissistic old actor\n\ncalled it Hugh, and sent it to me first.\n\nThey did actually change the name when they sent it to me,\n\nperhaps out of tact.\n\nBut nevertheless, the letter that came\n\nwith the script did say, we've written\n\nthis narcissistic monster of a washed up actor\n\nand we thought of you.\n\nAnd it was very difficult to get past that letter.\n\nBut you know, it was a funny script,\n\nand I thought, I can do that part.\n\nAnd that film, Paddington, you know,\n\nisn't there when you're shooting,\n\nbecause obviously he's created in the computer afterwards.\n\nInstead you have a choice, I had a choice\n\nevery time I was doing a scene with the bear,\n\nI could have a stick with the bear's head on the end,\n\nwhich was actually a very sinister thing,\n\nI didn't even like looking at it.\n\nIt looked like a kind of warning to bears,\n\ndon't come in to this area,\n\nyou would have your head cut off,\n\nor you could have this stand in lady\n\nwho was the same height as Paddington,\n\nshe was great, but that, I ended up with a stick,\n\nbecame quite fond of the stick in the end.\n\nWe used to have lunch together.\n\n(bright string music)\n\nA Very English Scandal, I was about to do something else,\n\nI was having dinner with Stephen Frears one night,\n\nhe said, oh, don't do that, I've got something else.\n\nAnd he sent me these scripts, and I thought, television?\n\nI don't do television.\n\nBut, it was him, and I love him, and we seemed to,\n\nyou know, we made a successful film together.\n\nIt's a fascinating story,\n\nit's a very interesting part of history,\n\nit's my childhood.\n\nThe book was brilliant in that it brought out\n\nthe black comedy of the whole thing,\n\nvery mischievous, and then the screen writers\n\nare extraordinary, Russell T. Davies,\n\nyou know,he's a proper genius.\n\nSo I had to say yes.\n\nIn the courtroom scenes,\n\nwhere there's long, long push ins on my face,\n\nno actor really likes it, because you start well,\n\nyou think, you know I'm bang in-character here,\n\nas the character dollies in for sixteen blood hours,\n\nyou know, after sort of ten seconds,\n\nI'm slipping out of character, I'm getting self-conscious\n\nand by a minute, you know, you think,\n\nwhat's happened to my jaw, I can't even feel it anymore.\n\nActors decide to do jobs for various reasons,\n\nbut I think the two main ones,\n\nis it a very fascinating and showy role for them,\n\nand the other one is will this thing work?\n\nBut I've always been absolutely fixated\n\non will it also be an entertaining thing,\n\nbecause if not, then this is a wank,\n\nwhat's the point of it?\n\nSo for me, this one had both, and I thought,\n\npeople are definitely going to enjoy this.\n\nBecause it's such a weird story,\n\nand it's just sort of tragic, and repulsive,\n\nand yet at the same time, funny.\n\nAnd equally, this is a great part, you know,\n\nhe was a many who I sort of knew the breed.\n\nMy mother was at Oxford in the '50s.\n\nAnd the friends she'd made there used to come\n\nto dinner sometimes when I was a kid\n\nand they were very Jeremy Thorpe,\n\nand very smooth, and charming, and reptilian.\n\nSo I knew that breed, and here was the sort\n\nof the epitome of one of those guys.\n\nWith all this, you know, just dark secrets\n\nand a weird, sort of nasty narcissistic side,\n\nbut also tragedy.\n\nJeremy Thorphe was never able to be himself.\n\nNever able to love someone in his own way,\n\nwhich happened to be gay.\n\nAnd that's deeply tragic, that what's one of his tragedies,\n\nand then his other tragedies are more sort of classic,\n\nGreek, Shakespearean one, which is one event\n\nin his life, gradually brings him down.\n\nHaving built himself up with a terrific career\n\nand life, reputation, this thing just destroys him."
