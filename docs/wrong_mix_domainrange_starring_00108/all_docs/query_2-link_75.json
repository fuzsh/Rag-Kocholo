        "text": "The It cast includes Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, and of course Bill Skarsgård.\n\nBy Nathan Kamal |\n\nThere is no bigger name in horror than Stephen King and no bigger landmark in his career than his 1986 novel It. We mean that literally, as the original printing weighs in at a staggering 1,138 pages. The epic, decade-spanning story tells of a group of Mainer children who face off against a terrifying, cosmic entity known as It.\n\nThe two-part feature film adaptation of It (directed by Andy Muschietti) quickly became one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed Stephen King adaptations ever. And the It cast is a big reason.\n\nFittingly for one of the most influential of all of Stephen King’s works, It has a pretty enormous cast of characters.\n\nFortunately, we are here to break down its ensemble of humans and manifestations of pure psychic terror. Let’s take a look at every character and what the actors and actresses have been up to since.\n\nSPOILERS FOR IT CHAPTERS ONE AND TWO TO FOLLOW\n\nIT CAST: THE LOSERS’ CLUB\n\nJaeden Lieberher aka Jaeden Martell as Bill Denbrough\n\nIn the It cast, Bill Denbrough is the de-facto leader of the Losers’ Club, the group of outcast kids in Derry, Maine who come together in both friendship and to defeat It. Jaeden Lieberher plays the youthful version of the character, who begins losing his younger brother Georgie to the supernatural monster in the form of Pennywise and a storm drain.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jaeden’s family moved him to Los Angeles when he was 8. Jaeden was only 14 when he appeared in the new version of Stephen King’s It. Despite his young age, he was already an acting veteran. It was the seventh movie he was cast in.\n\nAfter It, Jaeden Martell has continued to work as an actor. Not only did he return in It: Chapter Two, he also had a big role in the hit Netflix mystery movie Knives Out as Jacob Thrombey and a big part in an episode of Barry.\n\nHe also starred in Defending Jacob with Chris Evans. In it, he plays a teenager accused of murder.\n\nSophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh\n\nSophia Lillis plays Beverly “Bev” Marsh in the It cast. She is the sole female member of the Losers’ Club and the one to have the most direct contact with Pennywise. She is bullied at school for supposed promiscuity and is abused (implied to be sexual) at home by her widower father Alvin, who blames her for her mother’s death.\n\nBoth Bill and Ben Hanscom develop infatuations with Beverly, who seems attracted to both in different ways. In the first film, Beverly is kidnapped by Pennywise, who brings her to his lair and reveals his true form to her, rendering her catatonic. However, this also has the effect of giving visions to Beverly later of what could happen to them as adults if they do not confront It.\n\nSophia Lillis was 15 when she filmed It. Prior to it, she’d only ever appeared in one other project.\n\nSince her big break in Stephen King’s adaptation, she’s been busy. Not only did she return in It: Chapter Two, Lillis has starred as the iconic character Nancy Drew in a new movie take on the character.\n\n2023 was a big year for Sophia Lillis. For starters, she had a pivotal role in the acclaimed Wes Anderson movie Asteroid City as Shelley Borden. Being part of an ensemble cast that included Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks is no small feat.\n\nPlus, she played Doric in Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. This character was pivotal to the story playing a crucial role in keeping the group focused and preventing them from spiraling out of control.\n\nShe has been able to forge a solid and growing career in Hollywood with bigger and bigger productions along the way.\n\nFinn Wolfhard – Richie Tozier\n\nAmong the It cast, Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard) is the most talkative, abrasive member of the Losers, frequently targeting his friend Eddie Kaspbrak with insults. He is eventually revealed to be gay and deeply afraid (even as an adult) of anyone discovering it, with the implication that his sense of humor is a defense mechanism.\n\nCanadian-born Finn Wolfhard was 15 and already on his way to becoming a big star before appearing in It, thanks to his leading role on the Netflix series Stranger Things. He’s now also one of the stars of the newest iteration of Ghostbusters, appearing in Ghostbusters: Afterlife and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.\n\nHe’s been busy in recent years with the fame from Stranger Things clearly being the jumping off point.\n\nFinn Wolfhard isn’t just an actor. He’s gone on to become a writer and producer. His first short film was released in 2020, and he co-wrote and produced the 2023 movie Hell of a Summer.\n\nPlus, he’s starring alongside in Julianne Moore in When You Finish Saving the World where he plays an aspiring musician. That makes sense because, well Finn Wolfhard is also a musician. He was the lead singer and songwriter for a Canadian rock band until 2019.\n\nHis new band, The Aubrey’s, released their first single in 2020 as part of the soundtrack for the movie The Turning.\n\nJeremy Ray Taylor – Ben Hanscom\n\nBen Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is a shy, highly intelligent child who spends much of his time reading in the Derry Library. His obesity causes him to be a particular target of the sadistic bully Henry Bowers and his gang, as well as a deep source of insecurity and low self-esteem. He writes poetry for Beverly, but does not have the courage to give it to her directly.\n\nFor the It cast however, it is Ben who first puts it together through his studies that Derry has an unnaturally high rate of murders and disappearances and that they seem to be tied to a 27-year cycle.\n\nAfter It, Jeremey Ray Taylor had a role in Senior Year with Rebel Wilson who awakens from a coma only to head back to high school.\n\nAnd in life news, Jeremy Ray Taylor got married in 2024 to his longtime girlfriend. On the acting front, things haven’t sped up the way one might have thought after having a big role in It, but that doesn’t mean it won’t.\n\nWyatt Oleff – Stanley Uris\n\nStanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) is a quiet, studious boy whose life is dominated by his Rabbi father and bothered by being Jewish. More than any of the other Losers, he is logical and pragmatic and initially the least willing to believe in supernatural forces.\n\nHowever, it is frequently implied that he has an inner strength and perception that his friends do not and a greater understanding of what it will take to destroy Pennywise.\n\nFollowing It, he actually reunited with castmate Sophia Lillis in the Netflix’s I Am Not Okay with This. where he played a high school student navigating the complexities of adolescence alongside his best friend who discovers she has telekinetic powers.\n\nAs is something of a theme with some of his other It stars, he also had a role on the Apple TV+ series City on Fire playing the character of Charlie.\n\nChosen Jacobs – Mike Hanlon\n\nMike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) is the only Black member of the group and is relentlessly, violently harassed by Henry Bowers and his gang. His parents died in a fire when he was young and he is even more socially isolated than his friends.\n\nMike is the last of the Losers to join and is eventually the only one to remain in Derry after they grow up.\n\nSince his role as Mike, Chosen Jacobs has continued to work in both film and television, including a recurring role in the Hulu series Castle Rock. So the dude knows his Stephen King at this point.\n\nHe had roles in the movies Purple Hearts, Sneakerella, and Black Box as well.\n\nJacobs has also pursued a career in music, releasing singles that showcase his talents beyond acting.\n\nJack Dylan Grazer – Eddie Kaspbrak\n\nEddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer) is a deeply neurotic, hypochondriac child, with a close, unhealthy relationship with his mother. It is eventually revealed he is being abused via Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which his mother makes him dependent on her by giving him placebo medications.\n\nAfter It, Jack Dylan Grazer actually got into the superhero game as well. Not a caped hero mind you, but in the now-defunct DC Universe with roles in Shazam! and Shazam! Fury of the Gods.\n\nHe played the non-superhero version of Freddie Freeman in the movies. Adam Brody ended up playing the adult superhero form.\n\nOf course, this timeline of events for DC isn’t going to be anymore with the James Gunn-led version taking the stories and characters in a different direction.\n\nIT CAST: THE GROWN-UPS\n\nJames McAvoy – Bill Denbrough\n\nJames McAvoy plays the grown Bill, who has grown to be a successful novelist (one of Stephen King’s many writer characters). As an adult, he is even more tormented by his belief that he should have been able to prevent Georgie’s death and returns to Derry to once again act as leader of the group.\n\nOf course, this grownup group of Derry folks were pretty much all certified Hollywood stars by the time this movie came around.\n\nIn that way, they were the draw. James McAvoy had played Charles Xavier in the X-Men: First Class run of Marvel movies. And had a number of other major roles.\n\nMore recently he took a turn in The Book of Clarence with LaKeith Stanfield. McAvoy played Pontius Pilate in the biblical comedy drama. On the personal front, James McAvoy was married for a decade to actress Anne-Marie Duff who he met on the set of Shameless.\n\nThe two were divorced in 2016. In 2022, McAvoy married Lisa Liberati. McAvoy has two children.\n\nJessica Chastain – Beverly Marsh\n\nAs an adult, Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is married to an abusive man, implied to be reflective of her relationship with her father. However, much as with her father, she is eventually able to physically confront her husband and return to Derry along with the others. She and Ben eventually reunite as adults.\n\nJessica Chastain is one of Hollywood’s most respected actresses and talents, something that was well in place before even joining the It cast. It’s arguably only gotten better from there.\n\nIn 2022, Jessica Chastain took won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her leading role in George & Tammy. She starred opposite Michael Shannon in the movie about country singers Tammy Wynette and George Jones. Before that she had plate Tammy Faye Baker in The Eyes of Tammy Faye.\n\nShe is married to Italian nobleman Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo and the couple has two children.\n\nBill Hader – Richie Tozier\n\nRichie (Bill Hader) has become a successful stand-up comedian as an adult, albeit one that apparently does not write his own material (though that might have been one of his many jokes). He is still closeted and it is eventually revealed that he has held unrequited romantic feelings for Eddie for years.\n\nAfter portraying the adult Richie Tozier in It Chapter Two (2019), Bill Hader continues to be one of the best in the business. He’s received critical acclaim for his multifaceted career in comedy, acting, and filmmaking.\n\nAmong the highlights is from his HBO series Barry, which he co-created, wrote, directed, and starred in. It’s earned him multiple Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nHader divorced from filmmaker Maggie Carey, with whom he shares three children. He has been linked romantically to Rachel Bilson and Anna Kendrick, and as of 2023, he rekindled his relationship with comedian Ali Wong after a brief split.\n\nJay Ryan – Ben Hanscom\n\nBen (Jay Ryan) has grown to be very physically fit as an adult, as well as a successful, respected architect. It is clear, however, he still has low self-esteem and feelings for Beverly.\n\nJay Ryan has continued to work in both film and television. His post-It career includes starring in the Australian drama Fighting Season.\n\nHe also appeared in the Canadian film The Furnace. Plus, there was the British series No Escape where he plays a boat captain.. Are they hits like It? No, but he’s forged a solid career in a number of different countries.\n\nAndy Bean – Stanley Uris\n\nIn the It cast, Stanley (Andy Bean) is the least-seen of the Losers as an adult; upon being reminded of Pennywise and knowing he has to return to Derry, he commits suicide. It is later seen that he was both too scared to face It again, and also felt the Losers needed a new tragedy to re-form their bond and finally defeat the creature.\n\nAndy Bean played a significant role as Alec Holland in the DC Universe series Swamp Thing. It’s unlikely he’s going to stick with the role now that the DC movies have been handed over to the James Gunn regime.\n\nHe also appeared in the HBO series Here and Now plus added a cameo appearance on the Quantum Leap reboot.\n\nIsaiah Mustafa – Mike Hanlon\n\nMike (Isaiah Mustafa) stayed in Derry when the other Losers left, and has retained memories of Pennywise that have faded for the others. After 27 years, when the cycle begins again, he calls them back and reminds them all of what has happened as well as what he has learned of the origin of It.\n\nIsaiah Mustafa has a background in sports and was a standout wide receiver at Arizona State. He even made it to the practive squad for a few pro teams. So it makes sense that he landed in a role in the Kevin James comedy Home Team. He played one of the opposing coaches. He’s also appeared on series like Black-ish and Grey’s Anatomy in bit parts.\n\nJames Ransone – Eddie Kaspbrak\n\nDespite discovering that his mother was lying about his asthma, Eddie seems just as hypochondriac as an adult as he did as a child. He has married a woman who seems very similar to his mother and returns to Derry with the rest.\n\nJames Ransone has had an eclectic career in Hollywood, somewhat mirroring the personality itself. He stuck to the horror game after It Chapter Two with a role in The Black Phone. Plus, there was the found footage horror movie V/H/S/8/5 which was another installment in that franchise. He’s married to Jamie McPhee and has one child.\n\nIn Stephen King’s It, The Losers’ Club is defending itself against a demonic force that can appear as almost anything. Specifically, It tends to choose the thing that will terrify an individual the most.\n\nPENNYWISE’S MANY FORMS\n\nBill Skarsgård – Pennywise the Dancing Clown\n\nIt is a shapeshifter that takes on many forms through the course of the story, but seems to favor Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård), an eerie, excitable circus performer that mostly dwells in the sewers beneath Derry and emerges from hibernation every 27 years to kill and devour children after terrifying them.\n\nEventually, Mike discovers that It is actually an ancient, primordial predator that crashed into Earth in an asteroid millions of years ago and has since been dwelling under the land where Derry would eventually be. Terrifying its prey serves to make them somehow taste better to It, which is why It generally targets more easily frightened children.\n\nIn addition to its own killings and mayhem, it seems that the mere presence of It influences the town of Derry on a primal level, making its inhabitants more prone to aggression, hostility, and violence.\n\nIn addition to all the forms below, It also appears as the Losers themselves multiple times and is implied to frequently be observing them via more innocuous background figures.\n\nBill Skarsgård has parlayed that creepy appearance into all manner of films after It and It Chapter Two. He had a brief turn in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Kro in Eternals. He also got into the John Wick action as Marquis Vincent de Gramont in Chatper 4 of that franchise.\n\nAnd if going dark and weird is his style, well then his starring role in The Crow reboot might just take the cake. He’s playing the Eric Draven character.\n\nJoan Gregson – Mrs. Kersh\n\nMrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson) is a form taken by It to frighten the adult Beverly, appearing as an old woman who resides in the apartment she had with her father years ago. Mrs. Kersh has an antique picture of a man named Bob Gray on her wall that greatly resembles Pennywise, but whether this has deeper meaning other than It tormenting Beverly is unclear.\n\nJoan Gregson has continued to work following the It franchise. She starred in the miniseries Sam, Dev & Ange, playing the character Ange. The series revolves around Dev, a single dad to 16-year-old Sam, with Ange being the 80-something-year-old that Dev also cares for.\n\nShe also appeared in The Hardy Boys for a couple of episodes and was also seen in American Gods.\n\nJavier Botet – The Witch – The Leper\n\nAfter initially appearing to Beverly as a kindly old woman (a common tactic of It is to appear friendly or harmless at first), It transforms into a giant, naked woman (Javier Botet) who attacks her. It can be inferred that this particular form was chosen to target Beverly’s trauma around her father.\n\nIn the It cast, Javier Botet also plays It as the Leper, a hideously diseased and disfigured hobo who terrifies the hypochondriac Eddie as both a child and an adult.\n\nJavier Botet has portrayed a few notable characters in recent years and you’ll notice that like in It, it often requires him donning a fair bit of makeup. Most notably, he played the role of Dracula in The Last Voyage of the Demeter, a film that focuses on Dracula’s journey from Transylvania to London.\n\nEdie Inksetter – The Hostess\n\nIt appears to Henry Bowers in the form of a children’s show host on television, surrounded by children who were victims of the creature. It convinces Henry to kill his father in this form.\n\nAfter her role in the It cast, Edie Inksetter continued her acting career with a recurring role as Aunt Elizabeth in the critically acclaimed television series The Handmaid’s Tale.\n\nIn addition to her work on The Handmaid’s Tale, Inksetter has appeared in the horror film Spiral: From the Book of Saw as Detective Kraus. Her other television credits include roles Fargo and the CBS drama Clarice.\n\nTatum Lee – The Woman in the Painting\n\nThis particularly scary form of It initially appears as a painting on the wall of Stanley’s father’s office.\n\nInterestingly enough, Tatum Lee’s only two credited roles are in It and It: Chapter Two as this woman in the painting. That’s the long and short of her screen time. The It cast is it. She has a bio that expresses a love for acting, but to date, this is all there’s been of her on screen. Wild.\n\nCarter Musselman – the Headless Boy\n\nAt one point, Ben is pursued through the Derry Library by a spectral, headless boy, though it is also suggested that the Librarian herself is a form of It. It’s really something to make it all the way to a major movie only to have them remove your head, but that’s what happened with Carter Musselman.\n\nBut never fear, after being in the It cast, the actor has landed plenty of other work since then. And a lot of it has had to do with dancing. He played Heath in the television series The Next Step. Additionally, Musselman has been involved in the project Bring It On: Cheer Or Die. This is certainly better than walking around on the big screen without a head on. It would seem like anyone could do that.\n\nThe Deadlights – Themselves\n\nThe ultimate true form of It, the Deadlights, are a trio of interlocked, orbiting lights that bring madness to anyone who perceives them. Though the creature can appear in almost any form and generally chooses shapes that It feels will scare its prey, this is the true essence of It.\n\nBecause this is a Stephen King story, the Losers not only have to deal with It, but human tormentors:\n\nIT CAST: THE BULLIES\n\nNicholas Hamilton – Henry Bowers/ Teach Grant – Adult Henry Bowers\n\nHenry Bowers (played as a child by Nicholas Hamilton and an adult by Teach Grant) is the Losers’ Club’s bully and It’s primary human minion. Henry appears to be psychopathically violent and prejudiced against essentially everyone; at one point carves letters in child Ben’s stomach with his pocketknife, which disgusts even his friends.\n\nIt begins to more overtly manipulate Henry by convincing him to kill his abusive father and then try to murder the Losers (often singling out Mike). As an adult, he has been committed to a mental institution for decades but comes out of his catatonia with the emergence of It from hibernation.\n\nAfter his role in the It cast, Nicholas Hamilton has continued to build his acting career with significant roles in both Gen V and Action Royale. In Gen V, Hamilton gets to go invisible, playing the character Maverick, the son of Translucent. So yeah, he’s not shown at all. In Action Royale, Hamilton plays the lead role of Trilby, a teenager who starts an underground e-sports gambling ring to pay off his father’s debt. Oh, and he starred in the movie Endless as well.\n\nTeach Grant has only had some smaller roles in less notable works including Billy the Kid, Sheltering Season, and Deuteronomy.\n\nOwen Teague – Patrick Hockstetter\n\nIn the It cast, Henry’s second-in-command, Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague) appears to be equally violent, particularly enjoying threatening the Losers with his lighter and hairspray. He is killed by It in the sewers of Derry, who later appears as a rotted, zombie-like Hockstetter to aid the adult Henry.\n\nOwen Teague has been involved in several projects. He starred alongside Winona Ryder and Dermot Mulroney in the mystery thriller Gone In The Night and appeared in the drama To Leslie, which is now available for streaming. He had a role in Netflix’s crime thriller Reptile with Benicio Del Toro and Justin Timberlake. Oh, and he had a major role in the latest adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand.\n\nPlus, Owen Teague is also set to play the lead role in the The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes which will complete that trilogy of movie. But don’t expect to recognize him. He plays one of the apes.\n\nLogan Thompson – Vic Criss\n\nVic Criss (Logan Thompson) is one of the other members of Henry’s gang, though he appears to not be quite as willing to inflict deadly harm on others.\n\nLogan Thompson portrayed the character Nuclear Biff in the TV series Titans after being in the It cast. Nuclear Biff is a member of the Nuclear Family, a group of assassins posing as a conventional family unit, tasked with capturing Rachel Roth. He ended up appearing in three episodes.\n\nThompson also had a role in Sneakerella.\n\nJake Sim – Belch Huggins\n\nBelch (Jake Sim) is the largest of Henry’s gang and notable for being particularly injured during a rock fight between the Losers and his companions.\n\nJake Sim portrayed the character Warren, also known as Warren the ‘Burglar’, in the television series Holly Hobbie. He appeared in this role across several episodes from 2018 to 2022. Jake Sim also played the character Michael, also known as “A,” in the 2018 film Every Day\n\nMegan Charpentier – Greta Keene/ Juno Rinaldi – Greta Bowie\n\nGreta (as a child, Megan Charpentier, and as an adult, Juno Rinaldi) is the primary bully of Beverly at school and the daughter of the town pharmacist who supplies Eddie’s fake medication. She is responsible for revealing to him that they are placebos, though it seems she was attempting to mock him rather than help.\n\nIn the It cast, Greta briefly appears in the second movie, still working at the pharmacy and still insulting Eddie.\n\nJuno Rinaldi is well-known for her role as Frankie Coyne in the television series Workin’ Moms, where she was a series regular from 2017 to 2021. Frankie Coyne is a vibrant and carefree character who, in the series’ first season, deals with postpartum depression, a storyline that Rinaldi has personally resonated with.\n\nAfter leaving Workin’ Moms following its fifth season to pursue other creative opportunities, Rinaldi has been involved in various projects. Most notably, she appeared as April in the series Y: The Last Man. While the show was highly anticipated, it was not renewed for further seasons.\n\nTHE TOWN OF DERRY\n\nJackson Robert Scott – Georgie Denbrough\n\nThe younger brother of Bill, Georgie’s (Jackson Robert Scott) death at the hand of Pennywise is the inciting moment of the story. Because Bill, who was ill that day and made his brother a paper boat to play with, was not present, he views himself as responsible and wants to kill It partly in defense.\n\nAfter being in the It cast, Jackson Robert Scott is probably best known for his role as Bode Locke in the Netflix series Locke & Key, which aired from 2020 to 2022.\n\nBode is the youngest member of the Locke family and plays a central role in discovering the magical keys within their ancestral home, Keyhouse.\n\nScott’s portrayal of Bode has been a defining part of his acting career, showcasing his ability to bring depth and charm to the character.\n\nNotably, Scott was the only actor from the original Hulu pilot of Locke & Key to be retained when Netflix redeveloped the series.\n\nStephen Bogaert – Alvin Marsh\n\nAlvin Marsh (Stephen Bogaert) is the abusive father of Beverly, whose mother is suggested to have either died of an illness or killed herself. Beverly eventually physically confronts him and smashes a toilet lid over his head before being taken by Pennywise.\n\nStephen Bogaert has recently taken on significant roles in two notable television series. In Rabbit Hole (2023), he portrays the character Wilhelm Morello, contributing to the series’ intricate narrative that delves into espionage and conspiracy.\n\nAdditionally, Bogaert appeared in Five Days at Memorial. This series, based on true events, recounts the harrowing days at a New Orleans hospital in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Oh, and he showed up in Umbrella Academy as well.\n\nMolly Atkinson – Sonia Kaspbrak – Myra Kaspbrak\n\nBoth the manipulative, needy mother and the manipulative, overbearing wife of Eddie Kaspbrak are played by Molly Atkinson.\n\nMolly Atkinson only has one acting credit following the two It cast additions. That was in the show Nurses. Other than that, the acting has been on the lighter side.\n\nStuart Hughes – Butch Bowers\n\nAn Officer of the Derry Police Department, Butch Bowers (Stuart Hughes) is physically and emotionally abusive to his son, which is suggested to be at least partly responsible for his own violent behavior. He also seems to have a racial animosity against Mike and his family, which he has taught his son.\n\nFollowing It, Stuart Hughes has been in a few different notable series. He had a smaller turn in The Expanse as well as In the Dark. In the series The Way Home, Stuart Hughes plays the character Elijah Landry, who is Jacob’s adoptive father in the year 1814.\n\nXavier Dolan and Taylor Frey – Adrian Mellon and Don Hagarty\n\nA gay couple visiting Derry, the two are attacked in a homophobic hate crime by a group of youths, leading Adrian to be severely beaten and thrown off a bridge into a river. He becomes the first victim of Pennywise, who has emerged from his 27-year hibernation.\n\nStephen King was inspired by the real-life murder of Charlie Howard in Bangor, Maine in 1984, which happened under very similar circumstances. Thematically, Adrian and Don are victims of both It and the pervasive evil that It infects Derry with.\n\nXavier Dolan was in the It cast but is better known for his filmmaking. Recently, Xavier Dolan has been actively involved in various projects across different roles in the film and television industry. In 2022, he directed his first TV series, The Night Logan Woke Up, marking a significant expansion of his directorial work into television.\n\nHe’s been directing since 2009 with his most notable work likely is Mommy. He was also in Bad Times at the El Royale and Lost Illusions.\n\nTaylor Frey has had some sparing work over the year with roles in A Christmas to Treasue and Secret in the Woods, both of which were TV movies.\n\nLuke Roessler – Dean Miller\n\nWhen the Losers return to Derry as adults, they encounter a young boy several times who they first suspect to be It in a new form. Later, the boy reveals to Bill that It has begun to approach him via whispering voices; Bill later attempts to save the boy from Pennywise.\n\nAfter being in the It cast, there was the Netflix series Dead to Me where Luke Roessler plays the role of Henry Harding, who is the younger son of the main character, Jen Harding.\n\nHenry is depicted as a sweet-natured boy whose grief over his father’s death manifests as anxiety rather than anger.\n\nHe is a bright and perceptive child who becomes intertwined in the complex web of secrets surrounding his family. Roessler’s portrayal of Henry won him fans for sure.\n\nStephen King – Shopkeeper\n\nIt would not be a Stephen King movie without a cameo from the author himself, who appears as a cranky pawn shop owner who sells a bicycle to the adult Bill.\n\nDoes Stephen King need any introduction at all? No, of course not. The King of Horror is just that, the King. Interestingly enough, the picture above from the It cast is the last appearance from King in a movie. He has a voice a credit and was featured on a poster in The Stand, but his acting days might just be behind him."
