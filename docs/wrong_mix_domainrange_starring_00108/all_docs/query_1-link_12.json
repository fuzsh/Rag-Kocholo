        "text": "I haven't watched SNL much in a looonnggg time but has he done Price more then once? I caught the valentines day episode and LOVED his Price impression.\n\nAlso do you have a link to him doing Gizmo?\n\nHe's done Thanksgiving and Halloween Price sketches.\n\nHader even did a great Seth Rogen impression on Saturday.\n\nBill Hader needs to leave SNL. He's been awesome in every movie he's appeared in. I can't wait for him to have the time to be the lead in movies.\n\ni disagree... he really just doesn't have that j'ne sais quoi to be a leading man... his voice is annoying as all get out for one, and the only time he's funny is when he's playing off of other people... he's like will arnett, or jason bateman. those guy's are all awesome, but not enough to do anything on their own.\n\nI love Bill Hader and have been saying that he needs to star in his own movie for a while. Id also like to see Jonah Hill and Danny Mcbride either team up or lead in a movie. Ive heard Jonah has 2 movies he wrote coming out soon. Id also really like to see Nick Swardson in an Apatow movie cuz i just loooove Nick Swardson he so great in Grandmas Boy and Reno 911\n\nagain, every actor you just named only works as a second fiddle... nick swardson in a leading role? jonah hill? are you serious? even danny mcbride has his own tv show, and he's not that good in it. the problem is likability. none of these guys are relatable unless you're kind of a *****e, and people that aren't likable don't carry movies.\n\nYeah I know, eh? Jeeze and people wonder why SUPERBAD made no money at all\n\noh yeah, i'd forgot how jonah hill was the only actor in that movie... i guess the movie's success had nothing to do with mclovin, right?\n\ni must have missed all the t-shirts, bumper stickers, traillers and catch phrases based off of, um.... wait, what was jonah's character's name again?\n\ndon't get me wrong, the kid is hilarious, just about all the people mentioned in this thread are, but they don't sell movies on their own.\n\nMcLovin's \"fame\" came after the films opening weekend when audiences fell in love with him. He wasn't one of the lead characters (he was a supporting character) but his story touched a nerve with auidences.\n\nAnd just because merch is produced of a secondary character because theres easy money to be made dosent take away from the talents/status of others.\n\nagain, every actor you just named only works as a second fiddle... nick swardson in a leading role? jonah hill? are you serious? even danny mcbride has his own tv show, and he's not that good in it. the problem is likability. none of these guys are relatable unless you're kind of a *****e, and people that aren't likable don't carry movies.\n\nI respectfully disagree. Imo Mc Bride is awesome in Eastbound and down.\n\nokay, man... i disagree with you, but i don't really care enough to argue too much... but honestly, that movie, as good as it was, and as funny as jonah was, wouldn't have done half its business without mclovin... just saying.\n\nI respectfully disagree. Imo Mc Bride is awesome in Eastbound and down.\n\noh, dont get me wrong, i do like the show, but mark my words, it'll be lucky to make it to the next season, because the guy just isn't likable. he's a total dick with, so far, no redeeming qualities, and he only works in small doses.\n\nhave you seen the foot fist way? there's a reason it didn't go to theaters."
