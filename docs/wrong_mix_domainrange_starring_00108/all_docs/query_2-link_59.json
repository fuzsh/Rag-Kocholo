        "text": "It's that time of the year when there is no shame in watching a Christmas movie every day.\n\nEven if it's in between playing Mariah Carey's Christmas songs, each viewing of “Elf” or “Home Alone” never gets old and is a bridge back to what is often fond memories.\n\nWith so many famous Christmas movies out there, the question is not when to start watching them (now!), but which movies to watch. TODAY.com gathered an array of options, ranging from family-friendly watches to holiday romances to old black-and-white classics to dysfunctional family comedies to Black Christmas movies to Christmas horror movies for adults. Also expect animated movies beyond \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" though that's on here, too.\n\nGrab some eggnog and enjoy!\n\n'Candy Cane Lane' (2023)\n\nChris Carver, played by Eddie Murphy, is motivated to win his neighborhood's annual home decorating contest for Christmas. He's up against quite the formidable opposition, though, when a crooked elf he agreed to work with casts a spell that brings the 12 days of Christmas to life. Now, Chris, his wife (played by Tracee Ellis Ross) and their kids must try to break the spell before it's too late.\n\n'Best. Christmas. Ever!' (2023)\n\nCharlotte and Jackie are friends, but Charlotte is suspicious of Jackie's supposedly perfect life. A mishap brings them and their families together for the holidays. Brandy, Heather Graham, Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeno star.\n\n'Dashing Through the Snow' (2023)\n\nThis Christmas fantasy comedy starring Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Teyonah Parris and Lil Rel Howery follows Eddie (played by Bridges) as he rediscovers his love of Christmas through his daughter after decades of being a grinch and after incurring the wrath of a politician.\n\n'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' (1989)\n\nEvery attempt that Clark makes at increasing Christmas cheer in his family of Grinches backfires and ends up making things worse. Complete with power outages due to too many lights, canceled Christmas bonuses that were much needed and unexpected visitors just showing up, this comedy film is one for the ages.\n\n'White Christmas' (1954)\n\nBing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney star in this musical, which was nominated for an Oscar for the song \"Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep).\"\n\n'Bad Santa' (2003)\n\nProfessional thieves Willie and Marcus annually rob shopping malls when they accept seasonal jobs as Santa Claus and his elf. This raunchy comedy starring Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox, Bernie Mac, Lauren Graham and Octavia Spencer covers everything from cons to unhealthy relationships to a sweet, sweet resolution at the end.\n\n'Jingle All The Way' (1996)\n\nDads Howard and Myron nearly come to blows (OK, they do) when they set out shopping on Christmas Eve for an action figure that their respective sons want. Through twists and turns, it gets to the point where the dads have dressed as the action figure and his archenemies and fight it out. In the end, they agree to a solution that they consider a win-win.\n\n'Arthur Christmas' (2011)\n\n\"Arthur Christmas\" is like the \"Love Actually\" of Christmas movies, in that it's full of British greats. The cast consists of James McAvoy, Hugh Laurie, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent and Imelda Staunton, among others, helm the animated movie, which follows Santa's son Arthur trying to fix a present delivery gone awry.\n\n'Meet Me in St. Louis' (1944)\n\nYou can thank this classic movie for the classic song \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" Judy Garland stars in the period piece set in St. Louis before the World's Fair. The movie came out, however, amid World War II, giving the melancholy song extra resonance for people missing loved ones.\n\n'The Princess Switch' (2018)\n\nWatch \"The Princess Switch\" and then its two increasingly ridiculous (and fun) movies. Vanessa Hudgens plays identical women – of no relation. One is a baker from Chicago, the other is royalty in a small, fictional European country. They come together during the Christmas season and then decide to switch places, just for the thrill.\n\n'Last Christmas' (2019)\n\nWith a title that pays homage to the popular Wham! song \"Last Christmas,\" the film will keep you guessing and swooning until the very end. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding play a couple who fall in love during the holiday season — but there's something Golding's character isn't saying.\n\n'The Perfect Holiday' (2011)\n\nQueen Latifah and Terrence Howard play angels who narrate the action of this moving Christmas romantic comedy, and sometimes intervene. Nancy (Gabrielle Union) puts her three children before herself, over and over. This Christmas, she gets to be the main character in her life, thanks to a bit of romance.\n\n‘Edward Scissorhands’ (1990)\n\nJohnny Depp’s titular character has large, sharp blades for hands and lives in isolation. He attracts the attention of an Avon salesperson, Peg. Edward spends time with Peg’s family during the holiday season and falls in love with her daughter.\n\n'Carol' (2015)\n\nAdaptations of \"A Christmas Carol\" come up multiple times on this list — but the Carol in question in this Todd Haynes project is of another variety. Cate Blanchett plays a bored, wealthy New Jersey housewife in the 1950s who forms a connection — a deep connection — with a department store clerk (Rooney Mara) while Christmas shopping.\n\n‘Klaus’ (2019)\n\n“Klaus” shows that, no matter how many Christmas movies there are, there’s still a chance to make something wholly original. With beautiful animation, this fairy tale reimagines Santa as a gruff woodworker. In the movie, a postal worker assigned to a far northern town befriends him, and they hatch a plan to deliver presents to the children of the community, divided by a petty rivalry.\n\n'Bridget Jones' Diary' (2001)\n\nSay you don't want a Christmas movie, but a movie that gets the stakes of the season — and what it's like to feel alone at a time of togetherness. \"Bridget Jones' Diary\" is the rom-com for you, teeming with ugly Christmas sweaters, genuine charm and unforgettable leading men.\n\n'Scrooge' (1970)\n\nScrooge is an incorrigibly grumpy old man. For him, Christmas is nothing but one long \"bah, humbug!\" Then, at an inflection point inspired by an employee and his struggling family, three ghosts convene to give Scrooge a change in attitude. Beyond this movie, the classic tale, first written by Charles Dickens, has been interpreted in Muppet movies, one-man shows and more.\n\n'Unlikely Angel' (1996)\n\nDolly Parton is one of the reigning queens of Christmas specials. In this made-for-TV movie from the '90s, she plays a country singer-turned-angel who, after her death, helps people down on Earth.\n\n'Spencer' (2021)\n\nYes, this movie about Princess Diana is grim — but it's also definitely a Christmas movie. The Pablo Larrain biopic imagines three days at the end of Princess Diana and the then Prince Charles' marriage, as they celebrated the holidays at Balmoral. If your days aren't feeling merry and bright, then this might be the movie for you.\n\n'The Family Stone' (2005)\n\nJoining a new family isn't easy, especially when they're the Stones. When Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) heads to her boyfriend's town for the holidays, she hopes for a warm reception and gets, instead, a new set of personalities (and challenges) to face.\n\n'Christmas with the Kranks' (2004)\n\nAfter decades of over-the-top celebrations, two empty nesters decide to skip Christmas and go on vacation instead — only to immediately backtrack when their daughter surprises them for the holiday.\n\n'Noelle' (2019)\n\nAs Santa's son, Nick Kringle was groomed to take over the family business. The only issue? He doesn't much want it. At the start of this Disney+ original, Nick (Bill Hader) leaves the North Pole abruptly. His sister, Noelle (Anna Kendrick), is determined to find him and bring him back home in time for Christmas. Turns out the holidays are a stressful time for the Kringles, too.\n\n'A Snowglobe Christmas' (2013)\n\nA TV executive (Alicia Witt) is busy working on Christmas movies, but has none of the spirit herself. After an accident, she wakes up in a picture-perfect world much like the snowglobe she had just been playing with. Meg is cynical and thinks dreams do not come true, but this adventure (whether real or imagined) may help her change her tune.\n\n'The Christmas Chronicles' (2018)\n\nSanta is cooler than ever in this Netflix series, which stars couple Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn as Santa and Mrs. Claus. In the first installment, two kids catch Santa in their house, so — naturally — they sneak onto his sleigh to leave with him, disrupting his process.\n\n'Office Christmas Party' (2016)\n\nThe title event in \"Office Christmas Party\" will make or break tech company Zenotek in Chicago. It's facing closure and is trying to win over a new investor to stay afloat, but the investor wants proof it's a healthy company with happy workers. Zenotek throws a flamboyant office Christmas party to woo the investor — but everything ends up going wrong, of course.\n\n'A Castle for Christmas' (2021)\n\n\"A Castle for Christmas\" is a romantic comedy starring Brooke Shields as romance author Sophie Brown and Cary Elwes as the Duke of Dunbar. Following a petit scandal, Sophie flees to Scotland to get in touch with her roots. While there, she visits a castle where her grandfather used to work, and ends up clashing (and having chemistry) with its aristocratic owner.\n\n'A Boy Called Christmas' (2021)\n\n\"A Boy Called Christmas\" is a fairy tale-infused take on the origins of Christmas. Come for the family-friendly, imaginative vibes that will make you long for a sleigh ride; stay for the performances by the all-star cast, including Sally Hawkins, Kristen Wiig, Jim Broadbent, Maggie Smith, Michiel Huisman and Henry Lawfull in the starring role.\n\n'Dear Secret Santa' (2013)\n\nJennifer (Tatyana Ali) manages to find time in her busy schedule to travel back home and visit her dad after he has a hard fall. While back home, she starts getting love letters from someone who died three years prior.\n\n'Santa Hunters' (2014)\n\nBe careful what you wish for. The kids in \"Santa Hunters\" devise a scheme to get photographic proof that Santa exists — and it works. But then they learn that Santa loses some of his magic every time he's seen, so they set out to destroy all the evidence before Santa completely vanishes away.\n\n'Ghost of Girlfriends Past' (2009)\n\n\"Ghost of Girlfriends Past\" is a rom-com version of \"A Christmas Carol.\" Matthew McConaughey plays a committed bachelor haunted by the \"ghosts\" of his past — his ex-girlfriends. Their appearances might be enough to inspire him to change his ways.\n\n'Christmas Inheritance' (2017)\n\nThe daughter of a millionaire has her world shaken up in \"Christmas Inheritance.\" She's living the high life in New York City, ready to take over her father's company, but has one last test to past: living in the middle of nowhere with limited resources. There, she gains a newfound appreciation for her privilege and a new perspective on life.\n\n'Frozen' (2013)\n\nIt wouldn't be Christmas without \"Frozen,\" Disney's hit about sisterhood, magic and reindeer. While not holiday-themed, the wintery vibe fits the season. Princesses Anna (Kristin Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) were close as kids, but following the death of their parents, retreated into their own worlds — Elsa, alone with her magic, and Anna looking for a replacement.
