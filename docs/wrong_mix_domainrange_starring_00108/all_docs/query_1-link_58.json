        "text": "Getty\n\nMatt and Ben, Tom and Meg, Keanu and Winona are just a few of the A-list duos who can't seem to get enough of each other!\n\nEveryone has that one coworker that they really love working with -- and the same can be said for actors.\n\nIn fact, some actors love collaborating with each other so much that they do it any chance they get!\n\nAnd when their on screen chemistry proves to have success at the box office, studios have no problem casting them together again and again. That means audiences get to see a lot of these in-demand duos.\n\nSee a list of some of these fan-favorite team-ups below!\n\nGetty\n\n15 Actors Who Revealed How Little They Make In Residuals Amid Strike\n\nView Story\n\n1. Julia Roberts & George Clooney\n\nJulia Roberts and George Clooney have worked side-by-side on five different movies, including Ocean's Eleven and its sequel Ocean's Twelve. The pair also co-starred in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in 2002 and later reunited for 2016's Money Monster. Most recently, they starred in 2022's Ticket to Paradise. While the pair admit they have great on screen chemistry, Julia says when it comes to their romantic scenes, it can be like kissing your \"best friend.\"\n\n\"She is a great friend. It's fun to work with people that are truly good friends,\" George said in an interview with the Today show.\n\n2. Kristen Wiig & Bill Hader\n\nSince first teaming up on the set of Saturday Night Live, Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader have worked on quite a few of the same projects. They both appeared in 2007's Knocked Up, and The Brothers Solomon as well as 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, 2009's Adventureland, 2013's Her, and 2016's Sausage Party. Most recently, they played twins in 2014's The Skeleton Twins.\n\nGetty\n\nKate Beckinsale Reveals Keanu Reeves Saved Her From Wardrobe Malfunction at Cannes\n\nView Story\n\n3. Keanu Reeves & Winona Ryder\n\nThroughout their career, Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder have appeared in four films together: 1992's Bram Stoker's Dracula, 2006's A Scanner Darkly, 2009's The Private Lives of Pippa Lee and most recently, 2018's Destination Wedding.\n\n\"We like each other, personally, I think. And professionally, we have such a short hand because we have gone up against it and gone through the process many times. We're both kind of cut from the same acting tradition cloth. So we view rehearsal the same, we review what a character is, we develop the scene together,\" Keanu shared.\n\n4. Penélope Cruz & Javier Bardem\n\nPenélope Cruz and Javier Bardem have a connection both on and off screen. In addition to being married in real life, the couple have also appeared in eight films together. Both Penélope and Javier starred in Jamón Jamón, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, The Counselor, Everybody Knows, and Live Flesh. Javier also made cameos in several of Penélope’s films including Not Love Just Frenzy, Love Can Seriously Damage Your Health, and Don't Tempt Me.\n\n\"We work as hard as we can, but we recognize how hard we can work depends on each other’s needs. It's important not to be confused by fiction. Fiction is fiction, reality is its own thing. When you're younger -- because we've worked together many times over the years, we met when I was 21 and she was 16 -- you tend to confuse one for the other, or mix them. Now, I'm going to be 50 in a few weeks, and I don't do this anymore. She's the same way. You must always know when you're working on a level of re-creation, outside of real life. Penélope and I, we have to protect the 'us,'\" Javier told Vulture.\n\nGetty\n\nThese 17 Celebrities Have Helped Raise Over $15 Million for SAG-AFTRA Relief Amid Strike\n\nView Story\n\n5.
