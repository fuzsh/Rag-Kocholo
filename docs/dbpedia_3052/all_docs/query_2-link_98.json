        "text": "List of universities in russia for international students\n\nSprawling across two continents and spanning an incredible nine time zones (having cut down from 11 in 2010), Russia is the largest country in the world by far. Within its vast boundaries lie some of the planetâs most luxurious palaces, extensive plateaus, highest mountains, coldest cities, strongest spirits, best ballet companies, and largest collections of stacking dolls. In terms of culture, literature is one of the countryâs most notable displays; Russian authors such as Tolstoy, Bulgakov, Dostoyevsky and Nabokov are celebrated worldwide for creating some of the greatest works of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nOne of the fast-growing economies in the world, alongside the other BRICS countries, Russia is keen to internationalize its higher education system, and is investing in developing its universities and extending support for international applicants.\n\nA total of 97 Russian universities feature in the QS University Rankings: BRICS 2015, a ranking of the best-performing universities in the major emerging economies of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). Read on for an overview of the top 10 universities in Russia this year, with information about each institution, its international rank and its strongest subject areas."
