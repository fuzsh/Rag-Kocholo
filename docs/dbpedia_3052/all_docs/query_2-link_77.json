Ломоносова E-mail: maxim-a15@yandex.ru\n\nСтатья посвящена исследованию потенциала медийно-информационного образования (МИО) в системе российских университетов и университетов стран Содружества независимых государств (СНГ). Потребность в этом новом виде образования сегодня ощущается всеми, однако, далеко не все руководители университетов, которые отвечают за учебный процесс, и преподаватели высшей школы понимают смысл, цели и содержание этого образования, а также каким образом оно может быть интегрировано в традиционную систему обучения. При этом в современных учебных планах университетов имеются некоторые элементы МИО, его составляющие можно обнаружить в системе дополнительного образования и во внеурочной деятельности. Для определения потенциала университетов России и стран СНГ в области реализации программ по повышению медийно-информационной грамотности студентов и запроса на системную работу в этом направлении экспертами Евразийской ассоциации педагогических университетов (ЕАПУ) и Ассоциации специалистов медиаобразования (АСМО) при поддержке кафедры ЮНЕСКО медийно-информационной грамотности и медиаобразования граждан при Московском педагогическом государственном университете был проведен масштабный опрос руководителей вузов России и других стран СНГ на предмет востребованности теории и практики медийно-информационного образования. Результаты этого опроса дают основание полагать, что в настоящее время в ведущих университетах постсоветского пространства сформировался запрос на реализацию комплексного подхода к решению проблем медийно-информационного образования студентов, а также возникла потребность в повышении квалификации работающих преподавателей.\n\nКлючевые слова: Медийно-информационная грамотность, медийно-информационное образование, медиакомпетенции, образовательный процесс, система высшей школы, медиапро-странство.\n\nсо\n\nI_\n\nU\n\nсо\n\nThe problem of public media literacy is currently evolving from the area of purely scientific interest demonstrated by researchers (Kotilainen: 2010, Perez-Tornero, Varis: 2010, Catts, Lau (2008), Ghendina: 2011, Zhilavskaya: 2014), and UNESCO experts program materials (Wilson, Grizzle, Tua-zon, Akyempong, Cheung: 2011), into one of the most important areas of the educational policy in Russia and the CIS. Amid today's chaotic media environment with continuously raging information wars and against the backdrop of state goals to develop digital economy, there is an ever increasing need for a person to acquire new competencies that will enable him to successfully and safely exist in modern complex and dynamic world.\n\nThe focus here is on media literacy achieved through media education. This type of modern education has not yet been sufficiently studied or put into practice and is viewed by many universities in Russia and the former USSR as an extremely important and much needed domain. According to researcher Anna Onkovich, \"the relevance of introducing media education is due to the fact that a fundamentally new concept of professional training appears in the educational process, including media educational strategies in order to form media culture as a necessary component of the professional culture of a future specialist\" [Onkovich, 2013: 87]. On top of professional competencies, a contemporary graduate is supposed to acquire media competencies to understand the processes unfolding in media environment, to be able to distinguish fake information, to take the right side amid multiple views on the political agenda, economic processes, social relations, to be able to build effective media communication, and aptly avert the risks posed to the person in contemporary highly toxic digital media. There are already universities today that begin to introduce media education elements into their curricula, while others limit themselves to launching additional education courses or professional skill upgrade courses. Yet, nearly all of them are looking to integrate media education elements into their basic university curricula, and to make media education consistent and comprehensive. This is the conclusion one will make based on the study of the materials drawn from the surveys covering heads of universities on the proposed topic.\n\nThe key material for this article is based on the findings from surveys covering heads of universities in Russia and other CIS countries to identify the relevance of the theory and practice of media education (ME) in the higher education system.\n\nTo determine the potential of universities in the field of implementing programs to increase students' media and information literacy and to request systematic work in this area, experts from the Eurasian Association of Pedagogical Universities (EAPU) and the Russian Media Education Specialists Association (MESA) with the support of UNESCO Chair for public media literacy and media education under the auspices of Moscow Pedagogical State University there was conducted a survey of classical state universities authorities, as well as of pedagogical universities in Russia,\n\nKazakhstan, Armenia, the Republic of Belarus and other CIS countries. The survey involved such higher educational institutions as Kazakh National Pedagogical University named after Abai, Grodno State University named after Yanka Ku-pala, Armenian State Pedagogical University named after Khachatur Abovyan, Sevastopol State University, North Caucasus Federal University, Yaroslavl State Pedagogical University named after K.D. Ushinsky, Karachay-Cherkess State University named after U.D. Aliyev, Ryazan State University named after S.A. Yesenin, Far Eastern Federal University, Toliatti State University, Bratsk State University, Dagestan State Pedagogical University, Buryat State University, Trans-Baikal State University, Kemerovo State University, Tula State Pedagogical University named after L.N. Tolstoy and many others. In total, the study involved authorities of 46 Russian universities as well as leading universities in the countries-members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nThe questionnaire participants were asked 5 questions that revealed, firstly, the possibilities of universities in this area of training, secondly, revealed the systemic aspects of media educational activities, and, thirdly, allowed to see the development prospect of media education in the vast higher education school. The questions are the following:\n\n1. What courses of study and programs, related to media education, are implemented in the educational system of students at your university?\n\n2. Are the noted by you above courses compulsory, variable-based or elective disciplines of the curriculum?\n\n3. In what other forms is media education implemented at your university?\n\n4. How is the media environment formed at your university?\n\n5. What do you think should be done in order to make media education a true priority in the training system - at your university, in your country?\n\nAnswers to these questions reveled the general presence of media education elements in the structure of educational programs of universities and relevant ideas of the education system leaders about possible scenarios for the development of this promising area of students' training.\n\nIn particular, answering Question 1 about the courses and programs related to media education that are implemented in the educational system of students of your university, almost all respondents name the following courses: \"Information and Communication Technologies\" and \"Computer Literacy\". In just over half of the universities, the courses \"Information Security\" and \"Information Security of the Person\" are implemented. There is a huge number of technological courses such as \"Information Technologies in Education\", \"Information Systems\", \"Programming and Information Technologies\", \"Information and Communication Technologies in Education\", \"Audiovisual and Multimedia Tools in Education\", \"Computer Networks, \"Internet and Multimedia Technologies\", \"Fundamentals of Information Security\", \"Languages and Programming Methods\", \"Architecture of Computer Networks and Systems\" etc. Social courses (\"History and Theory of Media\", \"Media Literacy\", \"Media and Information Literacy\", \"Media Text in the Electronic Mass Media\", \"Fundamentals of Media Pedagogy\" and others) are though to a less degree, but nevertheless presented in Bachelor's and Master's programs at state universities such as Grodno, Nizhnevartovsk, Saratov, Gomel, Zabaykalsky, Tolyatti, Sevastopol, at pedagogical universities - Altai, Armenian, Yaroslavl, Bashkir, Orenburg, Moscow Psychology and Pedagogy University. This fact indicates some rethinking by the pedagogical community of the traditional, very narrowed interpretation of computer science as a science about the methods and processes of collecting, storing, processing,\n\ntransmitting, analyzing and evaluating information using computer technologies.\n\nQuestion 2 is asked to specify the first one. Are the courses compulsory, variable-based, or elective? The vast majority of respondents answer that disciplines on information and communication technologies are compulsory, while the courses related to the broader - media and information education - remain in the variable part of the curriculum among elective or optional courses.\n\nThis indicates the fact that universities of Russia and the CIS countries in such fields of knowledge as information, media and communication are dominated by technocratic disciplines designed to increase the level of computer literacy and information security of students. These are the disciplines that solve the tasks of bygone days. Nowadays, a teacher, a historian, a librarian, a culture worker, a manager in any field of activity, all these professionals urgently need such competencies as the ability to analyze professional information from various points of view, to understand the development trends of the media sphere, the development of legal and ethical standards of information work, the formation of ideas about how the modern media space exists and how a person implements his functions in it - searching and processing information, critical thinking, and production and promotion of information products. Only a third of universities make attempts to introduce new courses and disciplines into the educational process related to media literacy as the new literacy of the future, in general they are very fragmented and are unsystematic. Obviously, these disciplines are not provided in sufficient quantities with professional personnel and high-quality teaching aids.\n\nTo Question 3 about other forms, apart from the academic ones, of media education that are being implemented at your university, two thirds of the respondents answer that it is done in the format of refresher courses, 26 out of 46 - ¡ n the form of additional education, 25 - ¡ n the format of media experts stakeouts, 23 - ¡ n the format of sporadic lectures, 22 - in the form of media or information centers, 17 name special clubs and media studios, 11 note film classes, 9 note media laboratories, 6 mention open discussions and only 5 universities (Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, St. Petersburg Academy of Postgraduate Pedagogical Education, Buryat State University, State University of Humanities and Technology, Glazov State Pedagogical Institute, Saratov National Research State University) note media education centers. This indicates that the spectrum of forms, except for educational ones, in which media education can be implemented, is very poor. Mainly, this is done in the form of upgrade qualifications and additional education, which does not always correspond to the task of increasing the level of media literacy. Such resource as film education is not used enough by universities, also there are extremely few media laboratories where students of non-media specialties can practice; not all universities have media and information centers, and media education centers are a rarity in higher education system, which in fact could function as a kind of resource centers in the development of the of media and information education system both at the university and beyond it.\n\nTo Question 4, how is media environment formed at your university, almost all respondents answer that they create it using the official website, 36 note corporate media (a newspaper, a magazine, university television, radio), 23 refer to informal groups and students' accounts, 25 - to professors' accounts, 23 universities identify the activity of students' media centers, and 28 - identify activities of information structures of students' self-government bodies (students press centers of institutions and faculties, etc.) as essential in the formation of the media environment, 15 note a university media center, just 8 universities name media volunteers and\n\nC3\n\no\n\ncr\n\nIE\n\n0\n\n1\n\n—I\n\ny\n\n\"O\n\nIE\n\ncr\n\nсо\n\nI_\n\nu со\n\nonly 9 universities believe that media environment of higher professional school is formed due to a well-planned communication policy.\n\nThe results obtained indicate that in the vast majority of universities, the traditional technologies of the university official website and university media remain the main technologies by which the media environment is formed, while these technologies are not effective enough. Such activity as media volunteering is unfortunately very poorly developed, while it could have a positive impact both on the formation of an open media environment of a university and on increasing the level of media literacy of students. Also, the problem of creating an effective communication policy still remains unsolved, which in itself should be the key to the formation of a meaningful, creative and effective media environment.\n\nThe most informative part of the questionnaire was the answer to Question 5 about what needs to be done in order to make media education really a priority in the training system. Universities almost unanimously suggest that media courses should be included in the curriculum as a priority. Moreover, respondents claim it significant to introduce courses \"Media Literacy\" / \"Fundamentals of Media Literacy\" in all major curricula of higher education. Furthermore, university authorities offer to widely use various forms of additional education of students, to expand the possibilities of including media literacy / media education in extracurricular activities.\n\nIn general, all respondents' answers to the fifth question can be grouped into several blocks.\n\nBlock 1. Suggestions for the organization of the educational process\n\n- To introduce metadisciplinary course \"Media Literacy\" into the curricula of all areas of training.\n\n- To introduce a course on media-education, media-psychology and media literacy into the curricula at all educational levels / bachelor's, master's degrees /.\n\n- To include the assessment of media knowledge and skills in the program for assessing educational results.\n\n- to develop and implement educational programs promoting skills of working with big data in the field of the Internet of things and other modern technologies.\n\n- To develop educational programs design in \"Digital Pedagogy\".\n\n- To introduce tasks on the use of the media environment in the educational process into the content of internship practice.\n\nBlock 2. Further education and advanced training of teachers\n\n- To develop and implement media literacy courses for teachers and professors.\n\n- To expand the range of media literacy issues in the content of additional education programs for students of different areas of training.\n\n- To hold various workshops on the use of media technologies in the educational process.\n\n- To develop new programs of additional professional pedagogical education (for example, in the field of information security, cyber hygiene, cybersecurity).\n\n- lo develop a personalized learning environment to stimulate the professional self-development and self-education of teachers.\n\n- To develop MOOCs (Massive Open On-Line Course) in order to provide mass advanced training in media education in the remote mode.\n\n- To encourage teachers' participation in students media projects.\n\n- To demonstrate to students the successful practices in the use of digital competencies in teachers' activities. Block 3. Students Activities and Initiatives\n\n- To expand the participation of students self-government bodies in educational campaigns aimed at popularizing media education: conducting interactive classes, event promotions, etc.\n\n- To develop a system of applications for grant support contests of the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs on media literacy.\n\n- To hold students' competitions in media competencies.\n\n- To create students scientific associations (problem groups, scientific clubs) engaged in research work in the field of media literacy.\n\n- To create students clubs of interest, thematic clubs of media orientation.\n\nBlock 4. Structural and organizational activities\n\n- To open university media education centers and media laboratories.\n\n- To implement \"Digital University\" program at universities. Block 5. Research in the field of media education and international cooperation\n\n- To stimulate scientific research related to media pedagogy, media education.\n\n- To promote the development of professional and research strategies related to media literacy. To develop appropriate scientific projects on the problems of media, information, communication and test their results at international conferences.\n\n- To create a tradition of prolonged (at least one-year long) online participation of scientists and teachers in anniversary events dedicated to outstanding national scholars, so that international cooperation expands and material is accumulated on the experience of using best ideas in the world psychological and pedagogical practice.\n\nBlock 6. Application of skills in the field of media literacy as public relations\n\n- To unite media informational and educational resources of structural units with the aim of an integrated presentation of the university efficiency.\n\n- To carry out educational and social integration of vocational education, culture and production using media technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, university authorities almost unanimously claim it important to include media disciplines in the educational programs of all areas of training as a priority. For pedagogical universities, the most significant task is to introduce the discipline \"Media Literacy\" / \"Fundamentals of Media Literacy\" in all the main higher education programs Enlarged Groups of Specialties and Fields \"Education and Pedagogical Sciences\". In addition, universities offer to widely use various forms of additional education of students and teachers, to expand the range of media literacy / media education in the system of extracurricular activities. In all proposals from universities, a common structure is traced, which as a whole consists of designing a strategy for the development of media education, conducting scientific research in this area of knowledge and organizing well-planned systematic work, which should be provided with regulatory documents and qualified personnel. All this testifies to the readiness of the higher school to integrate media education into the existing system of training.\n\nЛитература\n\n1. Catts R., Lau J.
