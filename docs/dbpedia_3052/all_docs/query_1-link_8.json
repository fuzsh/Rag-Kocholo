        "text": "Student of this university: I studied at the Moscow State Pedagogical University at the faculty foreign languages exactly one year and I had enough. I write only my personal impressions of this university. Now I'm studying at another university and I have something to compare. My acquaintance with MSGU happened from the day of open doors. And what should have repulsed me right away was the view of the KGF building on Vernadsky Avenue. But for some reason it didn't turn me off. Inside, on the first floor, everything seems to be decent, as it seemed then. Later, during the admission campaign, I went up to the 6th floor of the Faculty of Foreign Languages. To say that it hasn't been renovated in a long time is an understatement. But by the way, the acceptance of documents took place in a more or less decent audience. I just didn't see other audiences back then. I don’t know what motivated me and why I chose MSGU. I still can't answer this question myself. Probably, its experienced greatness and that it was the first and leading pedagogical university in the country. The key word here is \"was\". We, future students, came to the meeting of students. How many unfounded words were said then, just such noodles on the ears. And about material support, and about large scholarships, and about an individual approach, and even about the fact that the university will try to provide each (!) Student with a laptop if necessary. Naturally, this was all a lie. And by the way, I never met the woman who told us about all the wonderful prospects at the university.\n\nI paid a little attention to the state of the university in the last paragraph, now I want to describe it in more detail. I was utterly horrified by the state of some audiences when we were cleaning. Huge holes in the linoleum, desks that are held only by chewing gum and chairs that seem to have been brought from the garbage heap. These are just some of the delights of the audiences. Windows have not been replaced apparently since the construction of the building. It was scary to even open them, it seemed that they were about to fall on your head. And in winter, a terrible draft blew from them. The most remarkable thing is the toilets, or rather their absence. Instead, there are holes in the floor. No, of course not everywhere, but the main toilets on the floors are the same, except for the first and second. There is no need to talk about the presence of toilet paper. Even in kgf very \"beautiful\" elevators. They, too, do not seem to have been changed since the 60s and 70s of the last century. It may happen that you get stuck and it will take you a very long time to get out of there. A small point in favor of the kgf is a large dining room and there it is not alone. In general, there is where to eat. It’s also very cool at physical education, especially the locker room that doesn’t close, so you either drag bags into the gym, or the duty officer stays and sits with the bags. But this also has a small plus, if you sit with bags, you will be counted as a visit to a couple of fizra.\n\nAbout the state of the classrooms, I have already painted, let's move on to the organization and work of the dean's office, if it can be called \"work\". For the first time, I ran into a problem when I received a student. Most of my classmates received their numbers on September 5-7, while I received them only half a month later. I and other poor fellows stood in line for 4 hours, while the lady who was supposed to give them to us constantly left for lunch. The dean's office did not expel the girl from my group until December, although she did not appear at the university for three months. Then we had a smartly compiled schedule. Firstly, the audiences did not correspond to reality, or two different objects could be placed in one auditorium, and whoever comes first will be the audience. Secondly, 3-4 groups could be assigned to one seminar, in some rooms we could hardly fit. Some had to practically sit in the hallway. Then another of our \"entertainment\" was to look for a floor of a pair of chairs. The lectures were also fun. They often put the whole stream on them, these are 20 groups, and in each group from 16 people. It was such that I had to sit on the stairs or crowded so that it was difficult to write. Accordingly, due to such a large number of people, the teacher was no longer audible at the middle desks.\n\nNow the next point. How are the couples and a few words about the teachers. I admit, not all couples were so terrible, and there were quite a few. The main language pairs go through one group. Such as grammar, speech practice and phonetics. But the language practice itself is incredibly small. We spoke very little English. In other matters, it’s still as lucky as a teacher. Now about teachers. There are many tyrants. For example, Anna Alexandrovna Tirskaya was my worst teacher. She was just a terrible teacher, she could yell, get nasty, she was constantly late for 20 minutes. Insulting students is a common thing for her. I was constantly shaking in front of her couple. She once yelled at me for finding the wrong audience for her. Yes, we had to look for her an audience for a couple, then call her so that she deigns to come down. She is one of the strongest phoneticians in the MPGU, but as a teacher and as a person, she is simply disgusting. Because of her, many students were expelled from the university. She simply brought them down on the zhkzame and on the transfer and did not hesitate to insult them at the same time. She constantly went over our mental abilities, saying that we all made a mistake in the university. I don't know who would like this approach to teaching. I simply did not perceive it, I had to hire a phonetics tutor, because I did not understand anything. She flunked me on the final test, but fortunately, another teacher took the exam. I don't understand why such \"tactful\" teachers are even allowed to work. There are a couple of teachers from whom I was just shocked. But in MPSU there are strong and adequate teachers. The only thing is that they only \"meet\" and how lucky. There was a teacher who allowed himself to be late for 40 minutes, and then generally declared that we would not give lectures and seminars, because the Moscow State Pedagogical University did not pay him for it. Of course, teachers are also in a difficult position in this university.\n\nI also like that now freshmen pay 195 thousand a year and this is only for English, two languages ​​are even more expensive. At Moscow State Pedagogical University, students have an unspoken question: What is the money spent on? Obviously not for repair.\n\nI would like to tell a story about how I was expelled. I went through seven circles of hell. I could not be expelled for three months (!) I cursed and quarreled. It's just scary to remember.\n\nI tried to paint everything to the maximum. These are the memories that this university left about itself. My advice to applicants. Think carefully before applying to MPGU. At least in foreign language. MSGU likes to recruit a lot of people, there can be 18 people in a group. Normal teaching is out of the question. Leakage of money is also another obscure issue. I recommend that if you still want to go to Moscow State Pedagogical University, ask around students of 2-4 courses. Ask about everything that interests you. And better than a few people. Also, if you still will definitely enter the Moscow State Pedagogical University, make acquaintances with people from different groups. This will help you in the future, you will exchange information, homework.\n\nI had such a bitter experience. And how glad I am that I still moved to another university. It's just heaven and earth!\n\nsupport 88\n\nTeaching is an art, a work no less titanic than that of a writer or composer, but more difficult and responsible.\n\nThe teacher addresses the human soul not through music, like a composer, not with the help of colors, like an artist, but directly.\n\nHe educates with his knowledge and love, his attitude to the world.\n\nD. Likhachev\n\nPedagogical universities are the first in the list, as they are the BASIS of any education. They train teachers and teachers for all levels of the educational system - kindergartens, schools, colleges, universities. Teachers do not just teach children the sciences, but also form a worldview, \"sow the reasonable, good, eternal.\" Pupils and students spend most of the study period next to teachers. Therefore, it is so important that graduates of pedagogical universities be highly educated, intelligent, and worthy. The future fate of the younger generation depends on the quality of teaching. As T. Shash said: “A teacher should have maximum authority and minimum power.” Only those who have authority among students can instill a love of knowledge, teach a lot.\n\nFuture teachers can receive fundamental and high-quality education in state pedagogical universities. The page of each university contains its description, addresses and details, open days, forms of education, information on availability budget places, hostel, military department.\n\nTo be a good teacher, you need to love what you teach and love those you teach.\n\nV. Klyuchevsky\n\nIn recent years, the popularity of the teaching profession has increased significantly. The flow of applicants to Moscow State Pedagogical University last year amounted to 25 thousand people - 17 people for 1st place! The number of budget places has been increased to 1290. A similar situation is observed in other pedagogical universities. The reason for the increase in the demand for teacher education is the state program for the modernization of the personnel training system, which has led, among other things, to an increase in the salaries of teachers. The world has changed, and there must be other teachers who keep up with the times. Modern teachers are called upon not only to strengthen the shattered authority of the teaching profession, but also to raise it to new heights. So that in the future it will be considered an honorable privilege to receive a pedagogical education.\n\nThe government is preparing an additional series of measures to improve the quality of life of teachers.\n\nPeople enter pedagogical universities not only to become a teacher, but also to get the profession of a competent municipal manager who applies modern methods management and business informatics.\n\nIts distinguishing feature is the rather unremarkable positions of the Moscow pedagogical universities. There are only two of them in the TOP-10, and the first of them, with an average USE score of 63.6, occupies only the seventh position. And the rating is headed by the Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University(66.4) followed by the Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University and the Russian State Pedagogical University. A.I. Herzen.\n\nThe general shift of emphasis towards the regions and some weakening of the positions of the capital and St. Petersburg universities, apparently, indicates a decrease in demand for pedagogical specialties in both capitals. At the same time, the overall pattern of inflow and rather high density USE results, indicates a relative equality in the level of training of applicants, which naturally affects the search for alternative options.\n\nNo. p / p The name of the university Average USE score Min USE score % of the total number of applicants admitted to the budget through the USE competition 1 Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University 66,4 64,3 5,1 2 Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University 66,2 59,6 68,6 3 Russian State Pedagogical University.

The Finns at one time realized that the education system that existed in the USSR was really the best in the world and stole it, adapting it to their own needs. educational standards. Now the best in the world is the Finnish education system.\n\nHowever, let us return to the Russian reform and pay attention to the fact that in 2013, in order to encourage applicants to enter colleges, that is, in order to motivate, first of all, graduates of the 9th grade to receive a special secondary education, entrance exams were canceled.\n\nInstead, competitions for certificates and passing scores after grade 9 were introduced. At the same time, each, let's call them by analogy with universities, SSUZ for each specialty determines independently. So the question of what is the passing grade for college after 9 years of schooling sounds ridiculous, as is the case with the question of the average temperature of hospital patients.\n\nPassing grade to technical school\n\nCollege and technical school - these educational institutions are twin brothers for receiving SSO after 9 years at school. And paraphrasing Mayakovsky, which of them is more valuable for quality education, we can argue that when “college” is said in a foreign manner, then a technical school is meant, when “technical school” is said, then a college is meant.\n\nSame as college, controversial definition passing score to a technical school, firstly, you need to clarify what the passing score is grade 9, that is, with incomplete or for a graduate with a complete secondary education.\n\nSecondly, in what specialty are you interested in the passing score and, thirdly, you need to indicate a specific technical school.\n\nBecause for graduates of the 9th grade, the passing score is set according to the average grade of the certificate, somewhere in the range from 3.5 to the maximum grade of 5, for graduates with complete secondary education from 130 to the maximum 200 points of the USE result.\n\nAs for passing indicators in the specialty, here, too, there is approximately the same range of knowledge assessments. And if we take individual technical schools, then they can independently set the passing parameters to the lower side of the lower values.\n\nPassing score for medical college\n\nWithout going into banal arguments about humanity and the need for medical professions, which are always in demand by society, it should be noted that secondary medical education can be obtained after 9 classes.\n\nThe passing score in a medical college also depends on specialties such as nursing and midwifery, as well as on the average of the certificate, which the educational institution determines on its own, depending on the enrollment and number of applicants per place.\n\nAs for other areas that are considered related in medical colleges, the principle of determining the average passing score is the same here as for the main specialties.\n\nMore recently, medical schools everywhere complied with the requirement that for admission it was necessary to pass exams in biology, as well as in the Russian language.\n\nNow everything has changed and for admission it is necessary to pass a written psychological test for the compliance of the applicant's psychological and physical abilities with the requirements for a medical specialist.\n\nCollege Passing Scores 2017\n\nIf we take, for example, any medical college, then the passing score of 2017 is unlikely to differ from previous years. Moreover, it is likely that the average passing mark of the certificate and the result of the Unified State Examination will be below the threshold of previous years due to a significant reduction in the number of applicants due to the so-called “demographic hole” that happened at the beginning of the “zero”. It's just that in those days there were not as many children born as there were before.\n\nTherefore, such situations are not uncommon, especially in provincial colleges, where passing grades may not be strictly fixed, for example, in cases where 30 applications for 30 places are submitted to the college, then in this case all 30 applicants enter. Then the passing grade will be considered the average mark of the certificate with the lowest indicators, or the lowest USE indicator. The main thing here is that the grades are, as they say, adequate to the profile of education, and also correspond to the status, or rather, the indicator that the college gives itself an assessment of.\n\nThe passing score is a variable value. Its value is strongly influenced by the number of universities with a similar quality of education, as well as the number of applicants.\n\nYou will need\n\n- admission committee of the university, information on how many applicants with good USE results;\n\n- statistics.\n\nInstruction\n\nIn order to have a clear idea of ​​the value of the passing score, it is worth waiting for the deadline for accepting documents, and based on the data received, find out how many points you need to have in order to become a student. But due to using the USE results, this number may decrease, for example, if someone takes their documents to another university.\n\nIf there is no wait for the mood and patience, you can use the following scheme. To get started, find out the statistics of passing points in this educational institution behind recent years 3-4. Further study the resulting numbers. On average, the passing score fluctuates by 5-10 points annually.\n\nOf course, the chances of getting into the passing score for graduates with perfect USE results increase. However, it is this contingent that can significantly increase the value of the passing score.\n\nRelated videos\n\nLomonosov Moscow State University is one of the leading educational institutions in our country. Every year people come here to apply from different parts of Russia and from abroad. Highly professional teaching staff trains qualified specialists in various specialties. How to get to MSU?\n\nInstruction\n\nFirst, you must get a high school diploma. The presence of a silver medal does not give any benefits upon admission, however, it can be considered during the exams with equal results with another applicant. Further, you can visit the “open day”, where you will find out the necessary information about further education, talk with the rector, ask questions and see the list of documents required for admission to the university. It is advisable to communicate with former university graduates and find out information about the learning process.\n\nSecondly, you will need to write an application addressed to the rector, which is submitted to the selection committee. The form of the document can be viewed on the official website admission committee Moscow State University. Or ask at the admissions office, they will also give instructions on how to fill it out.\n\nOrphans, disabled children, citizens under 20 years of age with one parent of a disabled group 1, citizens with a family income less than the subsistence level, persons who have served in the army under a contract for at least three years are entitled to preferential admission in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. Winners have the same advantage. All-Russian Olympiads held annually on various subjects among secondary school students.\n\nIn addition to the application of the established form, you need to prepare other documents. This may be a certificate or a diploma of secondary specialized education. Copies of the birth certificate and passport, 8 black-and-white photographs 3 by 4 in size, a copy or original of the certificate of results obtained at the Unified State Exam. It should be noted that copies of documents do not need to be certified by a notary. Persons entitled to benefits must also provide the necessary confirmation of their words.\n\nDocuments with the application can be sent by mail to the address of Moscow State University or taken directly to the selection committee in person. After that, applicants are allowed to pass additional entrance exams.\n\nNonresident persons wishing to get into Moscow State University are provided with a hostel for the entire period of study. Moscow State University trains specialists in full-time, evening and correspondence forms. In addition, you can always submit an application and documents for admission to the magistracy and graduate school of an educational institution.\n\nTo submit documents for admission, a certain period is allotted, which changes every year, so this issue must be clarified in advance at the selection committee.\n\nSources:\n\nwhat are the exams at msu\n\nSchool graduates who have applied for admission to the universities of our country are tormented by conjectures whether they will enter or not. They are interested in where they can get data on passing scores. Since results on a 100-point scale are used for admission to universities, no one knows the exact data.\n\nInstruction\n\nWait for the first lists of applicants to be posted, and you will see with what data they are striving to enter this university. Don't be discouraged if your last name isn't at the top of this list. This is just preliminary data. Look carefully at the column of people who submitted the originals (there will be not so many of them). Since, according to the law, it is allowed to apply to five educational institutions, these same names have probably already appeared on the lists of other universities.\n\nFollow the analysis of the results of the Unified State Examination in your area in news reports, on the Internet (on the websites of specific universities), in newspaper articles. Such data is in the public domain, presented in the form of statistics (these can be tables, graphs,). Everything will help you focus and understand how great your chances are. If your scores are satisfactory, consider whether it is worth submitting original documents to the university.\n\nConsult with past graduates enrolled in. On a personal example and the example of their classmates, they will tell you how they did it themselves. By comparing your scores with theirs, you will know approximately checkpoint. But remember that each educational institution has its own passing score - somewhere higher, somewhere lower. To some extent, it depends on the prestige of the university, the number of budget places and the number of beneficiaries who have submitted documents.\n\nBe sure to include your phone number on the application. Universities that value their applicants will inform you personally about the results of enrollment, perhaps even offer to immediately bring all the necessary documents. It also happens that the specialty you have chosen requires high passing scores. In the application, also express your wishes for another specialty, with lower scores. In this case, your chances will increase.\n\nEducation is an important aspect in a person's life. Good professional knowledge and skills strengthen self-confidence, contribute to getting a good job and the formation of material prosperity. \"Where to go to study?\" - ask themselves the question of most of the current graduates."
