        "text": "Teachers at all times belonged to the category of the intelligentsia, were respected and revered in society. Today this trend is also taking place; that is why many graduates, also driven by love for children and the desire to do a good deed for good home country decide to devote their lives to teaching. In this article, we have ranked pedagogical universities Russia. Is it worth going to big cities, or decent universities with high level also exist in settlements with a small population? How many points do you need to score for admission? Let's figure it out!\n\nMoscow Pedagogical State University\n\nOr abbreviated - MPGU. This university, founded back in 1872, is currently a real mastodon in the field of training professional teachers. The main building of this educational institution is located in Moscow at st. Malaya Pirogovskaya, 1. In 2015, another well-known institution was attached to the university, namely, Moscow State University for the Humanities. Mikhail Sholokhov. Today at MSGU you can get an education at the following levels:\n\nundergraduate;\n\nmagistracy;\n\npostgraduate studies;\n\n2nd higher;\n\nadditional education.\n\nOn the basis of the university, its branch branches also function, namely the Sergiev Posad and Yegoryevsk branches of the Moscow State Pedagogical University. In several buildings scattered throughout Moscow, students are trained who have entered one of the following institutes in the chosen direction:\n\nInstitute of Philology;\n\ninstitute foreign languages;\n\nInstitute of Sports and Health\n\nart institute;\n\nInstitute of Politics and History;\n\ninstitute of childhood;\n\nInstitute of Chemistry and Biology;\n\nInstitute of Communications, Journalism and Media Education;\n\nInstitute of Social and Humanitarian Directions;\n\nInstitute of Information Systems, Physics and Technology.\n\nIn addition, in MSGU, in addition to institutes, there are 4 faculties that have not yet been reorganized:\n\nmathematical;\n\ngeographical;\n\npedagogy and psychology;\n\npreschool pedagogy and psychology.\n\nHow to enter MPGU?\n\nAmong pedagogical universities in Russia, MSGU is in demand because it belongs to the category of state ones, which means that it provides state-funded places to applicants (usually there are about 2245 of them!). Moreover, this program operates both for full-time bachelors and absentee form education, as well as for undergraduates. Minimum passing score for free education in 2016 averaged a little over 74 points for 1 subject, with a variation of this indicator in one direction or another depending on the chosen specialty. days open doors are held from March and cover the period of April and even May, when graduates have to finally make their choice. Therefore, opportunities to look at the life of the university with my own eyes enough for applicants. The cost of training on a commercial basis is at least 60-70 thousand rubles, on average - about 160,000-180,000 rubles and more.\n\nPedagogical universities in Russia: MGPU\n\nDo not confuse with the aforementioned Moscow State Pedagogical University, because the vectors of their development are completely different. If the former combines an innovative approach with solid pedagogical traditions accumulated over a period of more than a hundred years of existence, then the Moscow State Pedagogical University, founded only in March 1995, is rather a new type of institution, it is not only a young, but also an extremely promising educational institution. . In the ranking of pedagogical universities in terms of the average competitive score of the Unified State Examination, MSPU takes an honorable 2nd place: in order to enter here on a budgetary basis, a graduate will need to pass each subject by an average of 70 points or more. It is quite possible to enter, because the total number of budget places exceeds 2000! If you canâ€™t get through to the budget, you can apply for commerce, the cost of which will be an average of 170 thousand rubles. In the structure of the Moscow State Pedagogical University, which is currently one of the largest metropolitan centers of education, culture and science, there are 13 institutes:\n\nadditional education;\n\nculture and arts;\n\nmathematics, natural sciences and informatics;\n\npsychology of education and pedagogy;\n\nsociology, psychology and social relations;\n\ncomprehensive rehabilitation and special education;\n\nmanagement;\n\nforeign languages;\n\nhumanitarian education;\n\nsystem projects;\n\nlegal;\n\nsecondary vocational education named after (college);\n\nsports and physical culture.\n\nThere is also 1 faculty, pedagogical, whose building is located in the city of Zelenograd. Applicants should not be afraid and think that in order to become a teacher they will have to move to the Moscow region, because the educational reform system equates the name of the institute with the name of the faculty, which means that all of the above areas are being implemented in the capital. From 4 buildings to different parts Moscow, the main one is the one that is located on the VDNKh metro station at the address 2nd Agricultural passage, 4. It is here in summer time the selection committee works; Documents for admission should be brought here.\n\nAdvantages of MGPU\n\nFrom the objective advantages of the institution: excellent technical equipment (presence of 91 multimedia audiences, of which 18 have interactive whiteboards, and 40 - sound amplification systems), participation in international projects and offering students exchange practices, internships, trips abroad, as well as assistance from the administration in further employment.\n\nRGPU them. Herzen\n\nRussian, based in St. Petersburg, also belongs to the best pedagogical universities in Russia. In order to enter here, you will need to pass each exam by more than 74 points; in general, 2266 applicants can count on the budget. The university was founded in May 1797 and only in 1991 acquired the status of a university. Currently, the university includes 100 departments and 20 faculties. The multilevel education system implemented within the walls of the institution trains teaching staff in the following areas:\n\nmethods of pre-school/primary education and pedagogy;\n\nphilology;\n\nteaching Russian as a foreign language;\n\nliterature and Russian language;\n\nsocial pedagogy;\n\nspeech therapy and oligophrenopedagogy;\n\nsports and Physical Culture etc.\n\nIn the list of state pedagogical universities in Russia, the Russian State Pedagogical University im. Herzen is distinguished by the fact that it leads the direction of labor personnel even at such unique and unparalleled faculties in the country as the Faculty of Human Philosophy, the Faculty of the Peoples of the Far North, and a separate Faculty of Life Safety. More than 20 thousand students study within the walls of the university. A special advantage of the institution is the maintenance partnerships with many overseas educational institutions located in Canada, China, Austria, Poland, the Netherlands, America, Germany and other countries.\n\nNizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University. K. Minina\n\nAt NGPU them. It is much easier for Kozma Minin to enter: here the average examination score in one subject should exceed 69 units. But there are significantly fewer budget places provided annually than in the institutions considered earlier; here about 468 people can count on admission on a free form. The cost of training in commerce will be at least 30 thousand rubles and more. Founded in 1935, the university currently boasts the following institutes:\n\nadvertising and public relations;\n\ninstitute of childhood;\n\nadditional education;\n\nsocio-economic and natural sciences;\n\nart institute;\n\nsocial, humanitarian and historical education;\n\nInstitute of Youth Culture and Politics;\n\ninformation-economic and physical-mathematical education;\n\npsychology, mass media and philology.\n\nOther pedagogical universities in Russia: list\n\nToday, the Naberezhnye Chelny Institute of Social and Pedagogical Technologies and Resources, the Moscow City Institute and also Tomsk, Chelyabinsk, Glazov, Omsk, Bashkir, Voronezh, Ural, Chuvash, Ulyanovsk, Novosibirsk and other pedagogical universities are also in good standing. Therefore, if a person does not have the means to move to the capital, it is not worth chasing just one prestigious name - received in these local higher educational institutions the level of pedagogical education will be very worthy.\n\nHis distinguishing feature- these are quite unremarkable positions of Moscow pedagogical universities. There are only two of them in the TOP-10, and the first of them, with an average USE score of 63.6, occupies only the seventh position. And the rating is headed by the Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University (66.4), followed by the Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University and the Russian State Pedagogical University. A.I. Herzen.\n\nThe general shift of emphasis towards the regions and some weakening of the positions of the capital and St. Petersburg universities, apparently, indicates a decrease in demand for pedagogical specialties in both capitals. At the same time, the overall picture of receipts and enough high density USE results, testifies to the relative equality in the level of training of applicants, which naturally affects the search for alternatives.\n\nNo. p / p The name of the university Average USE score Min USE score % of total number applicants admitted to the budget through the USE competition 1 Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University 66,4 64,3 5,1 2 Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University 66,2 59,6 68,6 3 Russian State Pedagogical University.
