        "text": "Its distinguishing feature is the rather unremarkable positions of Moscow pedagogical universities. There are only two of them in the TOP-10, and the first of them, with an average USE score of 63.6, occupies only the seventh position. And the rating is headed by the Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University (66.4), followed by the Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University and the Russian State Pedagogical University. A.I. Herzen.\n\nThe general shift of emphasis towards the regions and some weakening of the positions of the capital and St. Petersburg universities, apparently, indicates a decrease in demand for pedagogical specialties in both capitals. At the same time, the general picture of admissions and a fairly high density of USE results indicate a relative equality in the level of preparation of applicants, which naturally affects the search for alternative options.\n\nNo. p / p The name of the university Average USE score Min USE score % of the total number of applicants admitted to the budget through the USE competition 1 Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University 66,4 64,3 5,1 2 Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University 66,2 59,6 68,6 3 Russian State Pedagogical University.

I write only my personal impressions of this university. Now I'm studying at another university and I have something to compare. My acquaintance with MSGU happened from the day of open doors. And what should have repulsed me right away was the view of the KGF building on Vernadsky Avenue. But for some reason it didn't turn me off. Inside, on the first floor, everything seems to be decent, as it seemed then. Later, during the admission campaign, I went up to the 6th floor of the Faculty of Foreign Languages. To say that it hasn't been renovated in a long time is an understatement. But by the way, the acceptance of documents took place in a more or less decent audience. I just didn't see other audiences back then. I don’t know what motivated me and why I chose MSGU. I still can't answer this question myself. Probably, its experienced greatness and that it was the first and leading pedagogical university in the country. The key word here is \"was\". We, future students, came to the meeting of students. How many unfounded words were said then, just such noodles on the ears. And about material support, and about large scholarships, and about an individual approach, and even about the fact that the university will try to provide each (!) Student with a laptop if necessary. Naturally, this was all a lie. And by the way, I never met the woman who told us about all the wonderful prospects at the university.\n\nI paid a little attention to the state of the university in the last paragraph, now I want to describe it in more detail. I was utterly horrified by the state of some audiences when we were cleaning. Huge holes in the linoleum, desks that are held only by chewing gum and chairs that seem to have been brought from the garbage heap. These are just some of the delights of the audiences. Windows have not been replaced apparently since the construction of the building. It was scary to even open them, it seemed that they were about to fall on your head. And in winter, a terrible draft blew from them. The most remarkable thing is the toilets, or rather their absence. Instead, there are holes in the floor. No, of course not everywhere, but the main toilets on the floors are the same, except for the first and second. There is no need to talk about the presence of toilet paper. Even in kgf very \"beautiful\" elevators. They, too, do not seem to have been changed since the 60s and 70s of the last century. It may happen that you get stuck and it will take you a very long time to get out of there. A small point in favor of the kgf is a large dining room and there it is not alone. In general, there is where to eat. It’s also very cool at physical education, especially the locker room that doesn’t close, so you either drag bags into the gym, or the duty officer stays and sits with the bags. But this also has a small plus, if you sit with bags, you will be counted as a visit to a couple of fizra.\n\nAbout the state of the classrooms, I have already painted, let's move on to the organization and work of the dean's office, if it can be called \"work\". For the first time, I ran into a problem when I received a student. Most of my classmates received their numbers on September 5-7, while I received them only half a month later. I and other poor fellows stood in line for 4 hours, while the lady who was supposed to give them to us constantly left for lunch. The dean's office did not expel the girl from my group until December, although she did not appear at the university for three months. Then we had a smartly compiled schedule. Firstly, the audiences did not correspond to reality, or two different objects could be placed in one auditorium, and whoever comes first will be the audience. Secondly, 3-4 groups could be assigned to one seminar, in some rooms we could hardly fit. Some had to practically sit in the hallway. Then another of our \"entertainment\" was to look for a floor of a pair of chairs. The lectures were also fun. They often put the whole stream on them, these are 20 groups, and in each group from 16 people. It was such that I had to sit on the stairs or crowded so that it was difficult to write. Accordingly, due to such a large number of people, the teacher was no longer audible at the middle desks.\n\nNow the next point. How are the couples and a few words about the teachers. I admit, not all couples were so terrible, and there were quite a few. The main language pairs go through one group. Such as grammar, speech practice and phonetics. But the language practice itself is incredibly small. We spoke very little English. In other matters, it’s still as lucky as a teacher. Now about teachers. There are many tyrants. For example, Anna Alexandrovna Tirskaya was my worst teacher. She was just a terrible teacher, she could yell, get nasty, she was constantly late for 20 minutes. Insulting students is a common thing for her. I was constantly shaking in front of her couple. She once yelled at me for finding the wrong audience for her. Yes, we had to look for her an audience for a couple, then call her so that she deigns to come down. She is one of the strongest phoneticians in the MPGU, but as a teacher and as a person, she is simply disgusting. Because of her, many students were expelled from the university. She simply brought them down on the zhkzame and on the transfer and did not hesitate to insult them at the same time. She constantly went over our mental abilities, saying that we all made a mistake in the university. I don't know who would like this approach to teaching. I simply did not perceive it, I had to hire a phonetics tutor, because I did not understand anything. She flunked me on the final test, but fortunately, another teacher took the exam. I don't understand why such \"tactful\" teachers are even allowed to work. There are a couple of teachers from whom I was just shocked. But in MPSU there are strong and adequate teachers. The only thing is that they only \"meet\" and how lucky. There was a teacher who allowed himself to be late for 40 minutes, and then generally declared that we would not give lectures and seminars, because the Moscow State Pedagogical University did not pay him for it. Of course, teachers are also in a difficult position in this university.\n\nI also like that now freshmen pay 195 thousand a year and this is only for English, two languages ​​are even more expensive. At Moscow State Pedagogical University, students have an unspoken question: What is the money spent on? Obviously not for repair.\n\nI would like to tell a story about how I was expelled. I went through seven circles of hell. I could not be expelled for three months (!) I cursed and quarreled. It's just scary to remember.\n\nI tried to paint everything to the maximum. These are the memories that this university left about itself. My advice to applicants. Think carefully before applying to MPGU. At least in foreign language. MSGU likes to recruit a lot of people, there can be 18 people in a group. Normal teaching is out of the question. Leakage of money is also another obscure issue. I recommend that if you still want to go to Moscow State Pedagogical University, ask around students of 2-4 courses. Ask about everything that interests you. And better than a few people. Also, if you still will definitely enter the Moscow State Pedagogical University, make acquaintances with people from different groups. This will help you in the future, you will exchange information, homework.\n\nI had such a bitter experience. And how glad I am that I still moved to another university. It's just heaven and earth!\n\nsupport 88\n\nArtist name:\n\nFederal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Professional Education \"Moscow State Pedagogical University\"\n\nLegal address:\n\nRussia 119991, Moscow, st.
