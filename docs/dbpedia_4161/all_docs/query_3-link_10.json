        "text": "Romanian poet Adrian Paunescu died of cardiac arrest, kidney and liver block this morning at the Floreasca Emergency Hospital, where he had been hospitalized on October 26. Paunescu, 67, started the Flacara literary circle during the communist period, in 1973, which became an influent literary and social movement especially among the youth of the time. The circle was suppressed in 1985 and Paunescu became one of the 'undesirable' writers of the period.\n\nAdrian Paunescu is also known for having written laudatory poems about Nicolae Ceausescu at the beginning of his career. He started to write poetry in 1960 and has so far published 50 volumes of poems and journalistic work. He was also the head of the Flacara magazine.\n\nAfter the revolution, Paunescu admitted it had been wrong to write poems for the Ceausescu family. He eventually became a politician. He joined the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and became a Senator for three mandates.\n\neditor@romania-insider.com"
