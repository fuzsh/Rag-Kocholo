        "text": "Editor’s Note:\n\nWe have not heard from Mr. Paunescu for some time, at least not since his memorable appearance in the United Kingdom, as guest of the International Poetry Festival “Stanza’s”, at the University of St. Andrew’s, Scotland, A.D. 2000.\n\nAs our readers will recall, this Festival was organised by the talented Scottish bard, Dr. Gavin Bowd – who introduced Adrian Paunescu as “Romania’s greatest poet and dissident too”. We are very sad to hear since of Dr. Bowd’s severing his links with the very fastival he helped create and would like to reassure him that by his unexpected departure Romania’s poetry lost a staunch supporter.\n\nStill, we feel particularly privileged to be able to compensate for this loss and offer our Anglo-Saxon readership two of the latest ditties written by Mr. Paunescu.\n\nWe would also like to take this opportunity in expressing our grateful thanks to Senator Adrian Paunescu for sending us his latest, if somewhat nostalgic, contribution in memory of our Dearly Departed Leader – President Nicoale Ceausescu (1918-1989).\n\nAt the same time we would also wish to reassure Mr. Paunescu of our humblest and best efforts in conveying into English, as accurately as we could, the Poet’s inimitable style.\n\nThank you Your Excellency!\n\n“Nicolae Ceausescu – In Memoriam”\n\nby Adrian Paunescu\n\n(translated from Romanian by Constantin Roman)\n\nLike all the moral dwarfs, I praised in vain\n\nThe ever greatest Clown – The Leader, born-again.\n\nAnd bending half-way down, I kissed his ass…\n\nMay long you live, Beloved Nicholas!\n\nCompare this with the original Romanian verse below:\n\nRomanian version I:\n\nCa toti Boierii Mintii intr-un cor\n\nTe-am laudat, Iubit Conducator\n\nSi-ncovaindu-ma adanc din sale\n\nTe-am lins profund, Marite Nicolae.\n\nFurther Editor’s Note:\n\nWe are also grateful to our reader, Mr. Dawson, for providing us with another example of Paunesciana, this time in the original vernacular of the Poet’s own:\n\n“Iubit Conducator” de Adrian Paunescu\n\n(citat de Dawson, 29 Nov. 2003\n\nin: http://www.totalsport.ro/forum/showthread.php?t=5309)\n\nGodac fiind, prin jir cutreieram,\n\nSi grohaiam ades despre popor,\n\nSi dosul tau cu stima il pupam,\n\nSa ne traiesti, Iubit Conducator.\n\nADDENDUM: – 23 Years ago commemorative poetry by Adrian Paunescu:\n\n“ROMANIA’S FUTURE (VIITORUL ROMANIEI)”\n\n………………………………………….. …………………………………………..\n\nTranslated from Romanian by:\n\nConstantin Roman 2000.\n\nNote:\n\nAdrian Paunescu, (b. 1943) – Ceausescu’s Official Poet, Nationalist Party Leader, Senator – “Viitorul Romaniei” publ. 1983\n\n………………………………………….. ………………………………………….. ………………………\n\n“We now live a new life, which was dreamt of and fought for\n\nBy our forbears, our national revolutionaries Tudor, Balcescu\n\nHoria and Iancu, who were once upon a time\n\nThe martyrs of our sufferings and of Romania?s fate\n\nToday their heir is this wise old man, brought to us in Spring time\n\nTo be a hero amongst heroes. As Communist Party Leader,\n\nIt stands to reason that he is also the country?s President.\n\nAnd that is why, through the very person of Ceausescu we found our own newborn ethos.\n\nWe too are bearing the burden of past wars through our dead\n\nAs we paid the price of life to enjoy our earthly goods\n\nTherefor it follows that the source of sunshine does not come from Abroad, but that we have our very own Sun emerging from our capital city Bucharest.\n\nIt is Ceausescu himself that introduced honour within the Communist Party and the Country\n\nHe rediscovered our history unadulterated\n\nTo make us reach for the future in our dreams, as well as\n\nIn our daily deeds, full of new meanings.\n\nThat is why we always said and are still saying and will always say\n\nEvery minute of our lives, be it good or bad\n\nThat the Communist Party is strong, as it is nurtured by the whole Nation\n\nAs the Party represents the People at atomic level.\n\nAnd for this very reason as Leader who embodies the whole People\n\nHe will, of course feel their desires and all their wishes\n\nAnd that is why the Communist Party opens new vistas,\n\nA future made of enthusiasm and difficulties which are overcome.\n\nWe can?t accept that our life should be broken\n\nAs we make history day in, day out, the way it was prescribed\n\nBy the 9th Congress of the Communist Party\n\nWhose philosophy is to believe in the People as the ultimate solution\n\nWe were disinherited of our history to forget our forbears\n\nBut he inspired us with a new sense of History\n\nAs he explained to us that our Homeland cannot be reduced\n\nJust to red flags, but above all flies our national three-coloured flag\n\nThat allowed our heroes to come home from their legendary Existence, to enjoin the\n\nHistory this very day of the Party Congress\n\nFrom old deeds to contemporary deeds\n\nInspired by the strength of Prince Michael the Brave.\n\nBut the future is ours, let it be known by all\n\nOur future will get better and better, by the day.\n\nO, eternal Romania, you will shine under the sun,\n\nAlways open as a hand, united as a fist.\n\nNew cities will be built and villages will be born\n\nTomorrow the Carpathians will be our foundations\n\nOf ever new epochs and new civilizations\n\nAnd the folk who live here will be proud as these mountains\n\nBut the most important and most beautiful aims\n\nFor which we struggled so much\n\nIs the very man who is at home in his own country\n\nAnd who is never lonely where ever he may be,\n\nBecause this intimacy he experiences with the greater Romania\n\nIs no other than the expression of Communism which we are building\n\nA system which does not gage us according to our possessions\n\nBut for what we are and we had achieved\n\nThis difficult tasks exacts great sacrifices\n\nAs we build our country from the foundation to the roof\n\nBecause no solution is ever found with a simple ?veni, vidi vici?\n\nAnd as imported solutions don?t exist\n\nAnd just as no dogma will keep us warm in winter\n\nWe shall bring to reality the great ideals\n\nAs we build the future together, during our best years\n\nWhich are equally difficult years.\n\nNotwithstanding all that the centre of our struggle remains\n\nThe Communist Party who knows the problem and has the solution\n\nThe Party is the architect of all our future\n\nThe perfect judge of our past and present\n\nThat is the stuff of which Romania?s hero is made\n\nA true heroes through every fibre\n\nThe first recipient of the Truth\n\nWho knows how to confront all Evil\n\nAbove all our heroes can separate the grain from the chaff\n\nAnd is sensitive to the pains of the lowly\n\nConscious of the responsibility that is bestowed upon him\n\nHe knows how to act in the best interests of the country\n\nHow many fashionable ideas remain now moth eaten\n\nHaving lived a short glory, soon to be extinguished\n\nAs the People paid the price of the absurd egos\n\nExacted in blood and tears for an absurd whim\n\nAs we follow our Hero, we overcome disasters\n\nAs we follow our Hero we shall be able to\n\nMake everything to the measure of our enthusiasm\n\nYou People with a noble spirit, People with a pure soul. ”\n\n————————————————————————-\n\nRead more about Elena Ceausescu, about her Sycophantic Poets, about Dictators and their Victims in:\n\nBlouse Roumaine – The Unsung Voices of Romanian Women\n\n(Centre for Romanian Studies, London, 2009)\n\n(1,100 pages, 160 Biographies, 600 quotations)"
