        "text": "A storm has arisen over an invitation to a Romanian apologist for communism to recite his works at a poetry festival in St Andrews today.\n\nAdrian Paunescu, a friend of Nicolae Ceausescu, will read poems praising the tyrant who was executed in the 1989 revolution that ended communist rule in Romania.\n\nOrganisers of the StAnza event, which also features readings from the Scottish poets Douglas Gunn and Robert Crawford, defended their decision to invite Paunescu.\n\nIn one poem, Paunescu wrote: \"It is Ceausescu himself that introduced honour within the Communist party and the country/He rediscovered our history unadulterated to make us reach for the future in our dreams.\"\n\nA StAnza organiser, Brian Johnstone, said Paunescu would play a small part in the four-day event. \"This is a poetry festival; people are here because they are interested in his poems and not in his political leanings.\"\n\nOthers view Paunescu's inclusion as an affront. Since 1989 he has been a journalist, a children's author and a politician known for his nationalist and anti-western views.\n\n\"Paunescu wrote sycophantic odes about Ceausescu and organised mass rallies at which young people were dragooned into praising the dictator,\" said Tom Gallagher, author of Romania After Ceausescu. \"Paunescu was a cultural commissar for the regime and he did very well out of it.\"\n\nAmnesty International said it had no evidence, however, that the poet was involved in human rights violations.\n\nAnother StAnza organiser, Gavin Bowd, said: \"Paunescu had an ambivalent relationship with the regime, but so did most intellectuals and this is now 10 years ago.\""
