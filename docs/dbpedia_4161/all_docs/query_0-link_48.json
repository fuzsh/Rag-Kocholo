        "text": "In Transylvania, although they formed the majority of the population, Romanians were merely seen as a \"tolerated nation\" by the Austrian leadership of the province and were not proportionally represented in political life and the Transylvanian Parliament. At the end of the 18th century, an emancipation movement known as the Transylvanian School (Şcoala Ardeleană) formed, which tried to emphasize that the Romanian people were of Roman origin and also adopted the modern Latin-based Romanian alphabet (which eventually supplanted an earlier Cyrillic script). It also accepted the leadership of the pope over the Romanian church of Transylvania, thus forming the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1791, they issued a petition to Emperor Leopold II of Austria, named Supplex Libellus Valachorum based on the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, demanding equal political rights with the other ethnicities for the Romanians in Transylvania. This movement, however, leaned more towards westernization in general, when in fact the origin of the Romanian people is not only from the peoples of the former Roman Empire, but also from the ancient Dacians, predating the arrival of the Romans, not to mention that from around the 1600s to the 1800s Romanian culture was heavily influenced by Eastern influences as emphasized through the Ottomans, and the Phanariotes.\n\nThe end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century was marked in Wallachia and Moldavia by the reigns of Phanariote Princes; thus the two principalities were heavily influenced by the Greek world. Greek schools appeared in the principalities and in 1818 the first Romanian School was founded in Bucharest by Gheorghe Lazăr and Ion Heliade Rădulescu. Anton Pann was a successful novelist, Ienăchiţă Văcărescu wrote the first Romanian grammar, and his nephew Iancu Văcărescu is considered to be the first important Romanian poet. In 1821 an uprising in Wallachia (a region of Romania) took place against Ottoman rule. This uprising was led by the Romanian revolutionary and militia leader Tudor Vladimirescu.\n\nThe revolutionary year 1848 had its echoes in the Romanian principalities and in Transylvania, and a new elite from the middle of the 19th century emerged from the revolutions: Mihail Kogălniceanu (writer, politician and the first prime minister of Romania), Vasile Alecsandri (politician, playwright, and poet), Andrei Mureşanu (publicist and the writer of the current Romanian National Anthem) and Nicolae Bălcescu (historian, writer and revolutionary).\n\nThe union between Wallachia and Moldavia in 1859 brought a growing consolidation of Romanian life and culture. Universities were opened in Iaşi and in Bucharest and the number of new cultural establishments grew significantly. The new prince from 1866 and then King of Romania, Carol I was a devoted king, and he and his wife Elisabeth were among the main patrons of arts. Of great impact in Romanian literature was the literary circle Junimea, founded by a group of people around the literary critic Titu Maiorescu in 1863. It published its cultural journal „Convorbiri Literare” where, among others, Mihai Eminescu, Romania's greatest poet, Ion Creangă, a storyteller of genius, and Ion Luca Caragiale, novelist and Romania's greatest playwright published most of their works. During the same period, Nicolae Grigorescu and Ştefan Luchian founded modern Romanian painting; composer Ciprian Porumbescu was also from this time.\n\nIn Transylvania, the emancipation movement became better organized and in 1861 an important cultural organization ASTRA (The Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and the Culture of the Romanian People) was founded in Sibiu under the close supervision of the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Andrei Şaguna. It helped publish a great number of Romanian language books and newspapers, and between 1898 and 1904 it published a Romanian Encyclopedia. Among the greatest personalities from this period are the novelist and publicist Ioan Slavici, the prose writer Panait Istrati, the poet and writer Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, the poet and publicist George Coşbuc, the poet Ştefan Octavian Iosif, the historian and founder of Romanian press in Transylvania George Bariţiu and Badea Cârţan, a simple peasant shepherd from Southern Transylvania who, through his actions became a symbol of the emancipation movement.\n\nBadea Cârțan (roughly: Brother Cârțan – the common nickname of Gheorghe Cârțan; 24 January 1849 – 7 August 1911) was a self-taught ethnic Romanian shepherd who fought for the independence of the Romanians of Transylvania (then under Hungarian rule inside Austria-Hungary), distributing Romanian-language books that he secretly brought from Romania to their villages. In all he smuggled some 200,000 books for pupils, priests, teachers, and peasants; he used several routes to pass through the Făgăraş Mountains.\n\nHe was born in Opra Kertsesora, during the Hungarian occupation of Transylvania, (Romanian: Oprea-Cârțișoara, today part of Cârțișoara, Romania), the second child of poor peasants (Nicolae and Ludovica) who was former serfs, and he spent his childhood tending sheep at the edge of his village. In between his later brushes with fame, he would always return to this activity. He became the head of his family on 2 October 1865 with the death of his father.\n\nCârţan an first crossed the mountains into the Romanian Old Kingdom, founded at 1859, with his sheep and a friend at the age of 18, and it was at that time that his interest in Romanian national unity became powerful. In 1877 he enrolled as a volunteer in the Romanian War of Independence, serving until 1881. In 1895 he traveled to Vác and Szeged to visit imprisoned Romanians, including the signatories of the Transylvanian Memorandum. Badea Cârțan himself was arrested twice: once because he asked the Emperor-King Franz Joseph at Vienna for Transylvania's self-determination, and once because he asked the authorities for permission to sell Romanian books.\n\nCârțan made a journey on foot to Rome, and when he arrived at the city's edge after 45 days, said, \"Bine te-am găsit, maica Roma\" (\"Pleased to meet you, mother Rome\"). He wished to see Trajan's Column with his own eyes, as well as other evidence of the Latin origin of the Romanian people. After pouring Romanian soil and wheat at the column's base, he wrapped himself in a peasant's coat (cojoc) and fell asleep at the column's base. The next day he was awakened by a policeman who shouted in amazement, \"A Dacian has fallen off the column!\", as Cârţan was dressed just like the Dacians carved into the column; the event was reported in Roman newspapers and Duiliu Zamfirescu, Romanian representative in Italy, showed him around the city and introduced him to its important personalities. This January-February 1896 trip was but one of three visits to Rome; on his last, in October 1899, on the occasion of a meeting of the International Congress of Orientalists, he laid a wreath at the column's base.\n\nCârțan also visited France, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Egypt, and Jerusalem.\n\nHe was buried in Sinaia, on soil belonging to the Kingdom of Romania (Transylvania still being seven years away from the declaration of the union with Romania); on the stone cross atop his grave is inscribed the phrase: \"Aici doarme Badea Cârțan visând întregirea neamului său\" (\"Here lies Badea Cârțan dreaming of the unity of his people\").\n\nThe Lake\n\nWater lilies load all over\n\nThe blue lake amid the woods,\n\nThat imparts, while in white circles\n\nStartling, to a boat its moods.\n\nAnd along the strands I'm passing\n\nListening, waiting, in unrest,\n\nThat she from the reeds may issue\n\nAnd fall, gently, on my breast;\n\nThat we may jump in the little\n\nBoat, while water's voices whelm\n\nAll our feelings; that enchanted\n\nI may drop my oars and helm;\n\nThat all charmed we may be floating\n\nWhile moon's kindly light surrounds\n\nUs, winds cause the reeds to rustle\n\nAnd the waving water sounds.\n\nBut she does not come; abandoned,\n\nVainly I endure and sigh\n\nLonely, as the water lilies\n\nOn the blue lake ever lie.\n\n(1876, Translated by Dimitrie Cuclin)\n\nA Dacian's Prayer\n\nWhen death did not exist, nor yet eternity,\n\nBefore the seed of life had first set living free,\n\nWhen yesterday was nothing, and time had not begun,\n\nAnd one included all things, and all was less than one,\n\nWhen sun and moon and sky, the stars, the spinning earth\n\nWere still part of the things that had not come to birth,\n\nAnd You quite lonely stood... I ask myself with awe,\n\nWho is this mighty God we bow ourselves before.\n\nEre yet the Gods existed already He was God\n\nAnd out of endless water with fire the lightning shed;\n\nHe gave the Gods their reson, and joy to earth did bring,\n\nHe brought to man forgiveness, and set salvation's spring\n\nLift up your hearts in worship, a song of praise enfreeing,\n\nHe is the death of dying, the primal birth of being.\n\nTo him I owe my eyes that I can see the dawn,\n\nTo him I owe my heart wherein is pity born;\n\nWhene'er I hear the tempest, I hear him pass along\n\nMidst multitude of voices raised in a holy song;\n\nAnd yet of his great mercy I beg still one behest:\n\nThat I at last be taken to his eternal rest.\n\nBe curses on the fellow who would my praise acclaim,\n\nBut blessings upon him who does my soul defame;\n\nBelieve no matter whom who slanders my renown,\n\nGive power to the arm that lifts to strike me down;\n\nLet him upon the earth above all others loom\n\nWho steals away the stone that lies upon my tomb.\n\nHunted by humanity, let me my whole life fly\n\nUntil I feel from weeping my very eyes are dry;\n\nLet everyone detest me no matter where I go,\n\nUntil from persecution myself I do not know;\n\nLet misery and horror my heart transform to stone,\n\nThat I may hate my mother, in whose love I have grown;\n\nTill hating and deceiving for me with love will vie,\n\nAnd I forget my suffering, and learn at last to die.\n\nDishonoured let me perish, an outcast among men;\n\nMy body less than worthy to block the gutter then,\n\nAnd may, o God of mercy, a crown of diamonds wear\n\nThe one who gives my heart the hungry dogs to tear,\n\nWhile for the one who in my face does callous fling a clod\n\nIn your eternal kingdom reserve a place, o God.\n\nThus only, gracious Father, can I requitance give\n\nThat you from your great bounty vouched me the joy to live;\n\nTo gain eternal blessings my head I do not bow,\n\nBut rather ask that you in hating compassion show.\n\nTill comes at last the evening, your breath will mine efface,\n\nAnd into endless nothing I go, and leave no trace.\n\n(1879, Translated by Corneliu M. Popescu)\n\nOde (in ancient meter)\n\nHardly had I thought I should learn to perish;\n\nEver young, enwrapped in my robe I wandered,\n\nRaising dreamy eyes to the star styled often\n\nSolitude's symbol.\n\nAll at once, however, you crossed my pathway -\n\nSuffering - you, painfully sweet, yet torture...\n\nTo the lees I drank the delight of dying -\n\nPitiless torment.\n\nSadly racked, I'm burning alive like Nessus,\n\nOr like Hercules by his garment poisoned;\n\nNor can I extinguish my flames with every\n\nBillow of oceans.\n\nBy my own illusion consumed I'm wailing\n\nOn my own grim pyre in flames I'm melting...\n\nCan I hope to rise again like the Phoenix\n\nBird from the ashes?\n\nMay all tempting eyes vanish from my pathway\n\nCome back to my breast, you indifferent sorrow!\n\nSo that I may quietly die, restore me\n\nTo my own being!\n\n(1883, Translated by Andrei Bantas)\n\nWe want land !\n\nI'm hungry, naked, homeless, through,\n\nBecause of loads I had to carry;\n\nYou've spat on me, and hit me - marry,\n\nA dog I've been to you !\n\nVile lord, whom winds brought to this land,\n\nIf hell itself gives you free hand\n\nTo tread us down and make us bleed,\n\nWe will endure both load and need,\n\nThe plough and harness yet take heed,\n\nWe ask for land!\n\nWhene'er you see a crust of bread,\n\nThough brown and stale, we see's no more;\n\nYou drag our sons to ruthless war,\n\nOur daughters to your bed.\n\nYou curse what we hold dear and grand,\n\nFaith and compassion you have banned;\n\nOur children starve with want and chill\n\nAnd we go mad with pity, still\n\nWe'd bear the grinding of your mill,\n\nHad we but land !\n\nYou've turned into a field of corn\n\nThe village graveyard, and we plough\n\nAnd dig out bones and weep and mourn\n\nOh, had we ne'er been born !\n\nFor those are bones of our own bone,\n\nBut you don't care, o hearts of stone !\n\nOut of our house you drive us now,\n\nAnd dig our dead out of their grave;\n\nA silent corner of their own\n\nThe land we crave !\n\nBesides, we want to know for sure\n\nThat we, too, shall together lie,\n\nThat on the day on which we die,\n\nYou will not mock the poor.\n\nThe orphans, those to us so dear,\n\nWho o'er a grave would shed a tear,\n\nWon't know the ditches where we rot;\n\nWe've been denied a burial plot\n\nThough we are Christians, are we not ?\n\nWe ask for land, d'you hear ?\n\nNor have we time to say a prayer,\n\nFor time is in your power too;\n\nA soul is all we have, and you\n\nMuch you do care !\n\nYou've sworn to rob us of the right\n\nTo tell our grievances outright;\n\nYou give us torture when we shout,\n\nUnheard-of torture, chain and clout\n\nAnd lead when, dead tired, we cry out:\n\nFor land we'll fight !\n\nWhat is it you've here buried ? say !\n\nCorn ? maize ? We have forbears and mothers,\n\nWe, fathers, sisters dear and brothers !\n\nUnwished - for guests, away !\n\nOur land is holy, rich and brave,\n\nIt is our cradle and our grave;\n\nWe have defended it with sweat\n\nAnd blood, and bitter tears have wet\n\nEach palm of it - so, don't forget:\n\n'Tis land we crave !\n\nWe can no more endure the goads,\n\nNo more the hunger, the disasters\n\nThat follow on the heels of masters\n\nPicked from the roads !\n\nGod grant that we shall not demand\n\nYour hated blood instead of land !\n\nWhen hunger will untie our ties\n\nAnd poverty will make us rise.\n\nE'en in your grave we will chastise\n\nYou and your band !\n\nThree, mighty God, all three!\n\nHe had three sons and they, all three,\n\nWhen called, for the encampment left;\n\nSo the poor father was bereft\n\nOf rest and peace, for war, thought he.\n\nIs hard - one has no time to feel\n\nThat one has ceased to be.\n\nAnd many months went in and out,\n\nAnd rife with tidings was the world:\n\nNo more were Turkish flags unfurled,\n\nThe Moslems had been put to rout,\n\nFor the unscarred Romanian lads\n\nFull well had fought throughout.\n\nThe papers wrote that all the men\n\nThat had been called the spring before\n\nWere due to quit the site of war;\n\nSo to the village came again\n\nNow one, and now another yet\n\nOf those who had left then.\n\nBut they were long in coming, they.\n\nHe wept - he thought how they would meet,\n\nSo at the gate or in the street\n\nHe scrutinized the roads all day,\n\nAnd they came not. And fear was born\n\nAnd lengthened the delay.\n\nHis ardent hope waned more and more\n\nAnd ever bleaker grew his fear;\n\nAnd though he questioned far and near,\n\nAll shrugged their shoulders as before;\n\nAt last, then, he went to the barracks\n\nTo learn what was in store.\n\nThe corporal met him. \"Sir, my son.\n\nMy Radu, well - how does he fare ?\"\n\nHe did for all his children care,\n\nBut Radu was the dearest one.\n\n\"He's dead. In the first ranks, at Plevna\n\nHe fell. And well he's done !\"\n\nPoor man... That Radu was in dust\n\nHe had long felt, and felt past cure;\n\nBut now, when he did know for sure,\n\nHe stood bewildered and nonplussed.\n\nDead Radu ? What ? The news exceeded\n\nAll human sense and trust.\n\nBe curst, o, fiendish arm and man !\n\n\"And how is George ?\" \"Sir, I'm afraid\n\nUnder a cross he has been laid,\n\nBreast-smitten by a yataghan.\"\n\n\"And my poor Mircea ?\" \"Mircea, too,\n\nDied somewhere near Smirdan.\"\n\nHe said no word - dumb with the doom,\n\nWith forehead bent, like, on the cross,\n\nA Christ, he looked, all at a loss\n\nAt the mute flooring of the room.\n\nHe seemed he saw in front of him\n\nThree corpses in a tomb.\n\nWith feeble gait and dizzy eyes\n\nHe walks into the open air;\n\nWhile groaning, stumbling on the stair,\n\nHe calls his boys by name and cries\n\nAnd fumbling for some wall around\n\nTo stand upright he tries.\n\nThe blow he hardly can withstand;\n\nHe does not know if he is dead\n\nOr still alive; he rests his head\n\nUpon a bank of burning sand;\n\nHis long, emaciated face\n\nHe buries in his hand.\n\nAnd so the man sat woe-begone.\n\nIt was midsummer and mid-day;\n\nYet soon the sun faded away\n\nAnd lastly it was set and gone;\n\nThe human wreck would never budge;\n\nHe just stood on and on.\n\nPast him, men, women walked care-free,\n\nCabs on the highroad rumbled by,\n\nPast marched the soldiers with steps high,\n\nAnd then, the moment he could see,\n\nHe pressed his temples with his fists:\n\n\"Three, mighty God, all three !\";\n\nDecebal to his people\n\nThis life is a lost boon if you\n\nDon't live it as you wanted to!\n\nMuch would a warlike, ruthless foe\n\nEnslave us all! Our birth, we know,\n\nWas woe enough; would you get through\n\nAnother dreadful woe?\n\nDeath, even for a godlike scion,\n\nIs a hard law, as hard as iron!\n\nIt is all one to breathe one's last\n\nA lad or an old man bypast,\n\nBut not the same to die a lion\n\nOr a poor dog chained fast.\n\nWhat if you fight in the first line,\n\nWhat if by great exploits you shine?\n\nA grumbler cannot better be\n\nThan those who fear to fight and flee!\n\nTo murmur is to have no spine\n\nAnd make a bootless plea!\n\nLike dead men, cowards will keep still!\n\nThe living - let them laugh at will!\n\nThe really good ones laugh and die.\n\nHold, therefore, heroes, your brows high\n\nAnd let your lusty cheering fill\n\nBoth hell and earth and sky!\n\nBlood may in floods and torrents flow,\n\nThe arm assail with spear and blow,\n\nWhen the fierce enemies are dead!\n\nWell, you may think yourself Godhead,\n\nWhen you but laugh at what the foe\n\nDoes more than all else dread.\n\nThey're Romans, we know that. So what?\n\nWhere they not Romans but our god,\n\nZamolxes, with his creatures, still\n\nWe would, sure, ask them what they will -\n\nThey won't get of our land a jot:\n\nThey have their skies to fill!\n\nNow, men, to sword and shield and horn!\n\n'Twas bad enough that we were born;\n\nBut he is free to go whose fright\n\nMakes him too dastardly to fight,\n\nAnd if there is someone foresworn,\n\nLet him avoid our sight!\n\nWhat I have told you is enow!\n\nYou swore on shields your oath of love\n\nFor Dacia! Might resides in you\n\nAnd in the gods! But, heroes, know\n\nThat they, the gods, are far above,\n\nOur foes - at a stone's throw!\n\nPrayer for parents\n\nEnigmatically and tranquilly\n\nWhile finishing their purpose\n\nBeside us ... give up ... and die,\n\nOur dearest, dearest parents.\n\nGod, please bring them back to us,\n\nNo matter how bad was their life,\n\nAnd make them young as they once were,\n\nMake them younger than we are.\n\nFor the ones who gave birth to us\n\nGive an order ... Do something\n\nTo prolong their stay with us\n\nMake them start over again.\n\nThey've paid with their life\n\nfor their sons' mistakes\n\nGod, give Eternal Life,\n\nTo our dying parents.\n\nBehold them going away,\n\nBehold them fading away,\n\nCandles burning in a cuckoo's nest\n\nAs they ponder, as they snow.\n\nFull of diseases and sufferings\n\nAll of us, are returning to the dust\n\nAs long as we are alive, as long as they are around ...\n\nHonor and obey your parents.\n\nThe Earth is getting heavier\n\nThe departing is getting even harder\n\nI kiss your hand, my father!\n\nI kiss your hand, my mother!\n\nBut why are you looking at me like that\n\nMy daughter and my son?\n\nI'll be the one to follow\n\nMy dear ones, I am leaving you as well.\n\nI kiss your hand, my father!\n\nI kiss your hand, my mother!\n\nFarewell, my son!\n\nFarewell, my daughter!\n\nOh my father, oh my son!\n\nOh my mother, oh my daughter!\n\nRepeatable burden\n\nWho has parents, on earth not in thought\n\nHe still hears even in sleep the eyes of the world crying\n\nIf we have been, if we have been not, or if we are good,\n\nToday getting older we are missing the parents.\n\nWhat parents? Some people who don’t have room anymore\n\nBy so many children and so much bad luck\n\nSome crosses, alive yet, breathing harder and harder,\n\nAre these parents who always sigh.\n\nWhat parents? Some people, there they too,\n\nWho painful know what is one hundred of lei bill.\n\nWhether they are young or not, according their documents,\n\nIt doesn’t matter at all, they’ve become white of longing\n\nTo have their child a step higher,\n\nHow much more work, and what torment, what sleeplessness!\n\nEven now, when I’m writing as if I’d scream,\n\nI know and feel them, suffering somewhere.\n\nWe remember of them, after long weeks\n\nOld children what we are, with old parents\n\nIf they bought woods, if their bones ache,\n\nIf they didn’t die sad in their houses…\n\nBetween them and children is a progeny of dogs,\n\nAnd is the shadow of lead of the daily bread.\n\nWho has parents, on earth, not in thought,\n\nHe still hears even in sleep the eyes of world crying.\n\nThat from all that exist, the hardest thing is to be,\n\nNot a child of parents, but a parent of children.\n\nThe eyes of world weeping, many tears have been wept\n\nBut for the flood, is not yet enough.\n\nDo we still have parents? Do they still have children?\n\nOn the land of crosses, only human not to be.\n\nHumbled of needs and with bowed head,\n\nIn a poor little town, in a remote village,\n\nThey are still waiting even now, signs from ancestors,\n\nOr letters from the children telling they are lucky,\n\nAnd like some ghosts, they come rarely out at the gates,\n\nTalking about us, as about their dead ancestors.\n\nWho has parents, is not lost yet,\n\nWho has parents still has a past.\n\nThey made us, they raised us, they brought us here,\n\nWhere we have our own children.\n\nThey can seem annoying , when you have nothing to ask them,\n\nAnd generally they are bothering a bit.\n\nThey either don’t see, either don’t hear, either make the steps too small,\n\nEither it takes too long time to tell them and explain,\n\nHunchbacks, bents, in an infernal rhythm,\n\nThey ask if you know a chief of a hospital.\n\nIsn’t it that you feel a pity of all,\n\nEspecially that they can not anymore?\n\nThat you feel them as a burden and they know that it is true,\n\nAnd they look at you like they’d implore you…\n\nWe still have, we have yet a short time to carry\n\nOn the conscience the burden of this decline\n\nAnd then we’ll be very free under heaven,\n\nThey will be less those who don’t have and ask to us.\n\nAnd when we’ll start to feel too\n\nThat a burden we are for our children,\n\nAnd hardly after a sad and late time ,\n\nWhen we’ll know desperately news which today they don’t know,\n\nWe’ll understand why the children soon forget,\n\nAnd they don’t see any eye of the world crying,\n\nAnd why is not flood on the surface,\n\nAlthough always is raining, although eternally has snowed,\n\nAlthough the world where we’ve become parents,\n\nFor an eternity is shaken of weeping.\n\nThe fall of soviet-style communism in 1989 elated the cultural world, but the experience hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and the adoption of a free-market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free-market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest in other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralization, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.\n\nAfter the fall of communism in 1989, there was an almost immediate explosion of publication of books previously censored by the regime. Books were published in huge numbers per edition, sales were high, and a great number of publishing houses appeared. However, this soon reached a saturation point, and publishing houses began to decline due to a combination of bad management, a rapid drop in sales, and the absence of subsidies. Many closed after publishing only a few titles; some changed their profile and started printing commercial literature - mainly translations - and the state-owned publishers entered a \"state of lethargy\". The latter survived due to state financing, but their publishing activity diminished. Despite this, some publishing houses managed to survive and develop by implementing market-oriented policies, and by improving the quality and overall appearance of the books they published. Among the most notable contemporary Romanian publishers are Humanitas in Bucharest, Polirom in Iaşi, and Teora, which specializes in technical topics and dictionaries. Some publishing houses developed their own chains or bookstores, and also other new, privately owned bookstore chains opened, replacing the old state-owned ones.\n\nCulturally oriented newsprint periodicals followed a similar trajectory of boom and bust. A few have survived and managed to raise their quality and to maintain a critical spirit despite the hardships they encountered. Dilemma Veche (Old Dilemma) and Revista 22 (Magazine 22) remain respected forces in Romanian culture, with Observator Cultural a lesser, but also respected, weekly paper. Also, a state-financed radio (Radio România Cultural) and a television channel (TVR Cultural) with a cultural program exist, but they are not highly popular.\n\nMany new young writers appeared, but due to financial constraints, only those who have gained a strong reputation could get the financial backing to publish their works. The Writers Association, which should, in principle, support these writers' efforts, hasn't undergone much change since 1989 and there is much controversy surrounding its activity and purpose. The most successful writers, like Mircea Cărtărescu, Horia-Roman Patapievici, Andrei Pleşu, Gabriel Liiceanu, and Mircea Dinescu, are respected personalities in Romanian life, but they have to devote some of their would-be writing time to other activities, mainly journalism. The ties with the Romanian diaspora are now very strong and even foreign-language Romanian writers like Andrei Codrescu (who now writes primarily in English) are very popular.\n\nRomanian theatre also suffered from economic hardships, and its popularity decreased drastically due to the increased popularity of television and other entertainment channels. Some theatres survived due to their prestige (and some continued subsidies); others survived through good management, investing in themselves and earning a steady audience through the high quality of their productions. Experimental or independent theatres appeared and are quite popular in university cities. Uniter - The Romanian Theatres Association - gives yearly awards to the best performances. Some of the most critically acclaimed directors in contemporary Romania are Silviu Purcărete, Mihai Maniutiu, Tompa Gabor, Alexandru Dabija, and Alexandru Darie. Also, among the most appreciated actors, both from the new and old generation, one can name Ştefan Iordache, Victor Rebenciuc, Maia Morgenstern, Marcel Iureş, Horaţiu Mălăele, Ion Caramitru, Mircea Diaconu, Marius Chivu, and others.\n\nDue to the lack of funds, Romanian film-making suffered heavily in the 1990s; even now, as of 2005, a lot of controversy surrounds state aid for movies. Well-known directors such as Dan Piţa and Lucian Pintilie have had a certain degree of continued success, and younger directors such as Nae Caranfil and Cristi Puiu have become highly respected. Caranfil's film Filantropica and Puiu's The Death of Mr. Lăzărescu were extremely well received and gained awards at international festivals in Paris and Cannes. Besides domestic production, Romania became a favorite destination for international producers due to the low cost of filming there, and big investments have been made in large studios.\n\nThe number of cultural events held yearly in Romania has increased over the past few years. Some sporadic events like the \"2005 Bucharest CowParade\" have been well received and yearly events and festivals have continually attracted interest. Medieval festivals held in cities in Transylvania, which combine street theatre with music and battle reenactments to create a very lively atmosphere, are some of the most popular events. In theatre, a yearly National Festival takes place, and one of the most important international theatre festivals is the \"The Sibiu Theatre Festival\", while in filmmaking, the \"TIFF\" Film Festival in Cluj, the \"Dakino\" Film Festival in Bucharest, and the \"Anonimul\" Film Festival in the Danube Delta have an even stronger international presence. In music, the most important event is the \"George Enescu\" Classical Music Festival but also festivals like \"Jeunesses Musicales\" International Festival and Jazz festivals in Sibiu and Bucharest are appreciated. An important event took place in 2007 when the city of Sibiu was, along with Luxembourg, the European Capital of Culture"
