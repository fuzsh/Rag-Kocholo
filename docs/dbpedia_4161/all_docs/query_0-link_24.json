        "text": "Me Without You\n\nBy Adrian Paunescu\n\nAnd suddenly I understood that without you\n\nI’m not completely sane myself,\n\nTo run away and come straight back I’m tempted,\n\nTo never know my place on Earth again.\n\nSo fast did you become part of my blood,\n\nSo much part of myself you are right now,\n\nA mere scratch would make me cry,\n\nFor fear that I might lose you drop by drop.\n\nThere is no springtime anywhere,\n\nWith lifeless blossoms now you button up your coat.\n\nWith springtime’s bitterness I look for honey,\n\nBut you, my love, are there in its place.\n\nAnd suddenly I know that without you,\n\nI die myself and can’t come back to life,\n\nAlthough I had been born, as you well know,\n\nTo be the one protecting you from yourself!"
