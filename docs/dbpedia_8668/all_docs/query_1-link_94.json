So I changed my name.”\n\n“One evening my agent said: ‘I’ve got you a job, I’ve got you three days but you can’t call yourself Michael White, so give me another name.’\n\n“I was in a telephone booth in Leicester Square and I was opposite the Odeon and I looked up, and my favorite actor is Humphrey Bogart, and there it was, it said ‘The Caine Mutiny,’ so I said, ‘Caine! Michael Caine!’”"
