        "text": "One of the original Sixties working-class heroes, he has outlasted his peers with a career that is well into its fifth decade. Bizarrely, Britain's most iconic and prolific actor, and cinema's most famous voice ever, is also a chill-out DJ - and not a lot of people know that. 2007's Lifetime Achiever's name... is Michael Caine.\n\nA few years ago, on a Tuesday morning in March, a friend of mine made a fairly run-of-the-mill telephone call. He dialled a London number - 020 **** 8844 - the phone rings twice, and when it is picked up a familiar - no, make that an unmistakable - voice answers. \"Michael Caine.\"\n\nMy friend is somewhat taken aback. \"The Michael Caine?\" he asks, for want of anything better to say. \"Yes.\" \"I wanted the John Lewis lighting department.\" \"They're 4488.\" \"Oh,\" says my friend, before offering his thanks and saying goodbye.\n\nCan you imagine Tom Cruise behaving in the same way? Or Paris Hilton? Or the latest gormless reject from the Big Brother House?\n\nBritain's most famous, most successful film actor - cumulatively, Caine's films have made more money than the collected works of any other British star - tends to go out of his way to treat as many people as he can as equals. Why wouldn't he? For Caine, this is one of the many ways in which he can continue being a foot soldier in his ongoing battle in the class war. Caine is the last man to suffer fools gladly, but he's been suffering the British class system all his life. \"Don't get me on class or else we'll be here for six hours,\" he says, leaning forward in his armchair in his gorgeous Chelsea penthouse overlooking the Thames. \"Britain is a better place now, but it's still uptight about class. There are still lots of things wrong with it, but there are lots of things wrong with America and I love America. What I get from America when I get off the plane from England is the lack of class distinction, but it's always been an issue here. \"I was interviewed by an English journalist recently and he said that I was wonderful as the butler in Batman Returns, and I said, 'Thank you very much,'\" says Caine. \"But then he said, 'But of course, servants are easier to play, aren't they?' And then I thought, 'Oh my God, all these fucking years I have been ranting on about class in this country and it hasn't changed. Not one bit! And then I had other people say it was easy because I had a cockney accent. I said, 'Do you think that all cockneys are the same, that Alfred Hitchcock, David Bowie and me are the same person?'\"\n\nHe doesn't try to disguise what he is, or who he is, either. How could he? After all, he's Michael Caine. \"I was at a dinner with the Queen once and she asked me if I knew any jokes,\" he says with a smile. \"And I said, 'Not that I can tell you.' So I told her Tommy Cooper jokes. I told her about four or five. He says my wife is very big and she was standing on the corner of the street and the neighbours came down and said, \"Come on fell as break it up.\"\n\nHe said, 'I have given up sex for food, I've got a mirror over the dining room table.' Oh I know another one, 'If it weren't for the pickpockets, I wouldn't have any sex life at all.' \"She laughed at them all.\"\n\nWith a career that has so far lasted 43 years, since his first hit, Zulu, in 1964 - in which he played firmly against type, embodying an upper-class army officer - and one that shows no sign of ebbing away, Michael Caine hardly needs a new vocation. But because of a dinner party with Sir Elton John in the south of France last summer, he's now got one. In his time he has been restaurateur, author and fleetingly the seventh member of Madness, although perhaps even Caine didn't envisage himself becoming a pop Svengali at the age of 74. This month Universal releases Cained, a selection of chill-out classics compiled by Caine, a man with the largest collection of chill-out tunes this side of Manumission. Like, er, who knew?\n\nWhile Caine was having dinner at Elton's house in Nice, during the meal he became aware of the chill-out music in the background.\n\nEvery time a track came on, Caine would mention what it was called, who it was by and offer some little Michael Caine \"Not a lot of people know that\" titbit. Elton asked him how come he knew all this stuff, and then Caine admitted that he was a total buff, and knew more about chill-out than any other form of music, apart from maybe jazz. He also admitted to making his own compilation tapes and CDs. \"Elton said I should release my own compilation CD, and promptly rang Lucien Grainge, who runs Universal: 'I'm going to get you a record deal,' said Elton. And he did. Two minutes later I had a three-album deal! So I pulled a lot of records together and started compiling what I thought was the best stuff. And I've put it all on this record. The weird thing about this type of music is that no one really knows anything about it - who writes it, who records it.\n\nIt's actually very neglected.\"\n\nCained is a chill-out primer, containing everything from Chicane's \"No Ordinary Morning\", John Martyn's \"Sunshine's Better\" and Roy Budd's \"Hurry To Me\" to St Germain's \"Rose Rouge\", Nina Simone and Felix Da Housecat's \"Sinnerman\" and Bent's \"Swollen\". There are half a dozen classics familiar to anyone with a passing interest in the genre, and genuine oddities, such as the Roy Budd tune. Budd wrote the music for Caine's 1971 movie Get Carter, but \"Hurry To Me\" from The Big Tease is far more lounge-core. Altogether Cained is a rather wonderful thing, almost like \"The Best Of Chill-Out\", or \"Chill-Out's Greatest Hits\".\n\n\"I've loved this type of music for years, and have literally hundreds of CDs,\" says Caine, enthused by the topic. \"I've been buying them for about 15 years, and really know my way around. I have records from all over the place. I buy them in shops, on the internet, people give them to me. Anywhere I can find them, basically. About ten years ago I started making my own compilations - I had all the equipment and just went from there. I started on little cassettes, you know, years ago, but now I do it with CD discs. I've always been interested in music, and over the years have made literally thousands of tapes. When I was young there was no pop music, and you had to seek things out on Radio Luxembourg and American Forces Network on scratchy old radios. The BBC didn't fall into it for years; they had a guy playing the violin in an evening suit.\"\n\nParis has been instrumental in giving Caine a musical education, both in the Fifties, when he first travelled there as an unemployed actor chancing upon Jimmy's, in Montparnasse - and more recently, when he sought out the Buddha Bar after hearing some of its compilation CDs. Nights out at the Ad-Lib Club and the Pickwick Club and the Bag O' Nails back in the Sixties might have helped hone his skills - \"Can I dance? Fuck yeah... I used to dance like a loon till three o'clock in the morning\" - as did La Discothèque in Wardour Street - \"I walked past with Terry Stamp in the mid-Sixties, and as this pretty girl was enticing us in, we went for it. First thing I said was, 'This is just like Paris'\" - but it was flying solo in the Parisian back streets that got him acclimatised.\n\nJazz, yes; R&B certainly. But chill-out? Hearing that Michael Caine likes chill-out is a bit like discovering that Hugh Grant is a fan of Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, like finding out that Philip Roth is a Captain Beefheart completist. Like listening to your grandad bang on about emo. \"I don't really know how it happened, but I've become a real aficionado,\" Caine says. \"I have an ear for what I think is right, and whether it's the Buddha Bar, or Café Del Mar, or Stan Getz or St Germain or the Chrissie Hynde song [Moodswings' 'State Of Independence'], I know what makes a good track. I just take it seriously, that's all.\"\n\nMichael Caine still has that thinning Tintin hair and the voice that launched a thousand bad impressions, a voice we all feel we know, if only because most of us have lived with it for as long as Caine has been famous - ie all our lives. We feel we know Michael Caine because he is not just a part of our own lives, but also because what you see is what you get. And can I point out that this is a compliment. A big compliment. He's been unfairly criticised for sleepwalking through roles and for playing every character the same way, although if you can be bothered to analyse his acting technique, and his seemingly random film choices, you'll see that little could be further from the truth. It's not so much that he is a chameleon, it's more to do with his innate honesty as an actor.\n\nAnd of course he has that voice, the voice you still hear on the radio whenever they play \"Michael Caine\" by Madness: \"My name... is Michael Caine.\" \"I have a voice and that's it, that's what you get,\" he told\n\nGQ back in 1998. \"It's like Cary Grant - not that I'm comparing myself to Cary Grant - everyone can impersonate you. But that's me, that's my voice.\"\n\nAnd as for that famous, \"Not many people know that,\" line - it was the work of Peter Sellers. The former Goon was obsessed with gadgets, obsessed with getting them before anyone else could, and he impersonated Caine on one of the first privately owned answering machines. \"I phoned him one day and got his impersonation of me saying: 'Sellers is out - not many people know that,'\" says Caine. \"Unbelievable. The sod.\"\n\nFor me, Caine's indelible image, that sardonic, hooded-eyed cool Sixties persona is summed up by the scene in The Ipcress File when, amid the telltale amateur professional copper pans, hanging onions and coffee grinder, his Harry Palmer breaks two eggs into a bowl at once, while informing the female guest he is about to seduce: \"I... am going to cook you... the best meal... you've ever eaten.\"\n\nIn a way, Caine invented himself in textbook fashion, years later even producing the best textbook on the craft - Acting In Film, a transcript of the BBC masterclass he taught in 1987. \"I was a cockney boy and obviously didn't fit anybody's idea of what an actor was supposed to be, so I decided to put together elements that added up to a memorable package.\" In Acting In Film - which is probably the best manual ever written on the subject of what to do on a film set - Caine expounds upon the rather more prosaic details of film acting, such as how to look at another actor (carefully), how to stand up (slowly) and what to do if you feel someone is trying to upstage you (nothing). \"Marlene Dietrich actually taught me how to look at someone while being filmed. She said she'd seen a film of mine and my eyes were going all over the place. She told me to pick out something behind the actor you're looking at and just stare at it.\" He also talks a lot in the book about familiarising yourself with a set before you have to act on it, essentially so you don't bump into the furniture.\n\nCaine has always been very particular, very considered. When he first got famous - well, when he first got money (£4,000 for\n\nZulu) - it wasn't clothes so much that he thought about, as hygiene. He bought soaps and shampoos, masses of sheets and pillowcases, and loads of shirts and socks. Even toothpaste. He also started getting everything dry-cleaned, simply because he could afford to. \"I'd wear something once and then, bang, it was in the laundry. None of this making something last till the next day.\"\n\nIt's popular to say that Caine really proved he could act in atypical films such as Educating Rita and Hannah And Her Sisters, but that is wrong; Caine was acting long before that, right from Zulu in fact, and it's obvious that what most critics miss is Caine's ability to embody the people he's playing without apparently doing so.\n\nHe knows that if you are ever caught acting then you are doomed.\n\nHis approach is breathtakingly simple: don't act. React. Do not look at the camera and do not blink. \"If you want to break tension, then all you've got to do is blink,\" he says. \"The best example of that is Hugh Grant. People in real life are angry and will stare at you and they don't fucking blink. Blinking weakens you.\" Caine has not blinked his way to numerous awards, including two Oscars for Best Supporting Actor (Hannah And Her Sisters, 1987; The Cider House Rules, 2000); three Golden Globes (Educating Rita, 1984; Jack The Ripper, 1989; Little Voice, 1999); a BAFTA (Educating Rita) and a National Society Of Film Critics Award (Alfie, 1967) among many, many others. And, lest we ever forget, he was the star of the most iconic British film of all time, The Italian Job, a film that has it all: Mini Coopers, Noël Coward, a heist - Caine's Charlie Croker stealing £2m in gold from a van in Turin - Matt Monro's extraordinarily maudlin title song (\"On Days Like These\") and Simon Dee - the Swinging Sixties hipster who wasn't - playing a tailor of all things. Oh, and the greatest car chase this side of Bullitt, The French Connection or Ronin. The final scene is one of the most talked about in British cinema - it's almost a national institution - and as the back end of the getaway coach teeters over the edge of the Alpine cliff, the gold slipping towards the rear doors, Croker attempts to reach the bullion, uttering the immortal words, \"Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea! Err...\" Ironically, this cliffhanger was necessitated by the movie code in the UK at the time, which prevented any film showing crooks getting away with the proceeds of their endeavours. (The film's other memorable line, \"You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off,\" delivered by Caine during rehearsals for the heist, also became the punch line to one of the most notorious jokes of the late Sixties, a gag involving Jim Morrison.)\n\nOne of the most telling things about Caine is his understanding that when a star gets a script he will think, \"How can I change this to suit me?\" Whereas an actor will get a script and think, \"How can I change me to suit that?\"\n\nAnd regardless of how famous he becomes (and it's probably not possible for him to be any more famous than he is right now), Caine will always be an actor.\n\nBut that's not to say that Caine never brings anything to his scripts. In the book that Get Carter is based on, Ted Lewis' Jack's Return Home, there is the following passage: \"'Pint of bitter,' I said. He let his arms unfold, reached out for a pint mug and made his way to the pumps, and without putting anything more into it than it needed, he began to pull a pint. 'In a thin glass, please,' I said.\" Caine's Carter points and doesn't say \"please\".\n\nWith Caine it's all about economy. Most of the time. In Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Pauline Kael's 1968 collection of movie reviews, she has this to say about Funeral To Berlin, the second Harry Palmer film: \"Michael Caine is Harry Palmer again, but this time he is supposed to gain new humanity when he sees that the Israeli agents really believe in principles. But about the only thing that made Palmer amusing was his shabby small-time\n\n'professional's' indifference to the larger stakes: improve his character and you take away the only character he had.\"\n\nThe biggest media misconception about Caine is that he always plays himself, but to his knowledge he has never played himself.\n\nCritics also like to say that he has made more films that you've never heard of than any other working actor, which is frankly libellous. Not all of them are The Man Who Would Be King (the extraordinary 1975 John Huston film he made co-starring Sean Connery), but not many are as bad as The Swarm (generally considered to be Caine's worst moment; sample dialogue: \"We've been losing the war against the insects for 15 years but I'd never thought it'd be the bees - they've always been our friends\"). Caine has a very good relationship with his less-critically acclaimed films, and once said that if he were given the chance to live his life over again, he'd do everything the same. Except maybe appear in The Magus (\"The less said the better about Michael Caine's dreary, sloth-eyed, totally insincere work\").\n\nThe first thing Caine does when preparing for a part is try to get the hair right, although as he says himself, it's always exactly the same. In the early days of his career it was his image as much as his acting ability and his persona that helped him click with the public. He sort of looked cool. Although in many ways he was the antithesis of swinging London, his quiet, humdrum manner, his hooded eyes and the way in which he carried himself suggested the ultimate ascent of the backstreet hero. Not a superhero, not a superstar, but an Everyman - a working-class Everyman who achieved social mobility without growing his hair, dropping his aitches or taking psychedelic drugs.\n\nThen of course there were the glasses, the black, regulation-issue specs that influenced every neurotic boy outsider from Bermondsey to Baltimore. Caine looked like his own man, a chap with an unfashionable haircut, spectacles and an innate confidence.\n\nHe looked so odd that during his first 18 months of success, many Americans simply thought he was French. There were those who weren't impressed - film critic Rex Reed said that Caine swallowed his syllables so much you needed subtitles to understand him - but they were outweighed by the ones who were.\n\nAnd because he was cool, and British - no, English - and because he had that funny accent and the horn-rims, other famous people wanted to hang out with him. After the American success of\n\nAlfie, a film Caine credits with boosting British tourism, all the big Hollywood girls wanted to work with him. Shirley MacLaine got in there first, with Gambit, a film set on which she had a dressing room, Caine said at the time, \"that is better than anywhere I've ever lived\".\n\nFrank Sinatra was a fan, too. When Caine first went to Hollywood - \"I've spent a lot of time there, I lived there for eight years,\" says Caine. \"I wasn't deserting England for tax reasons, that's simply where they were making the movies\" - one of the first stars to befriend him was Frank Sinatra, a man whose music Caine had spent his adolescence using as the ultimate seduction tool. Sinatra was the first person to take Caine to Las Vegas, the first person to take him on a private jet, and the first celebrity to let Caine date their daughter. \"I adored Frank. He was such a generous man. He thought I was very funny, well he thought my accent was funny. And he always had this thing that I made too many movies. We'd meet and he'd go, 'Hey Mikey, how ya doin'? How many movies you make today?' When I was going out with his daughter, Nancy, he flew me in his plane to Vegas; all the girls had gone together and it was just me and Frank on this plane together. And all of a sudden, I froze. Tongue tied.\n\nSinatra said, 'Mikey, what's up? You scared of flying?' And I had to admit to him it had suddenly hit me, I was sitting on a private plane with Frank Sinatra. I'd known him all my life in some way, and here I was, talking to him. 'Frank,' I said, 'I'm overwhelmed.'\"\n\nTerry O'Neill has photographed Caine on more than 150 occasions, cataloguing the myriad personalities of a Very British Institution. \"Over the years I've shot him so often that it became something of a Holy Grail for me to photograph him without his glasses,\" says O'Neill. \"A lot of critics think that Michael's power lies in his specs, but they couldn't be further from the truth. With Michael, it was always his eyes that gave him his power, always his eyes that made people notice him. I think he's often thought acting was a strange profession, but he's displayed a lot more dignity than most.\"\n\nO'Neill became one of Caine's greatest friends, and it was the actor who made the photographer a star - though not a lot of people know that. When O'Neill first went to America in 1966, to photograph Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion in Chicago, the live-in bunnies thought he was nothing but the living embodiment of Caine's blue-collar rogue. It was the voice that did it, a voice that the girls would knock on his door at night just to hear, then giggle and run away. This was the influence that Caine had, that David Bailey had, that every cockney made good had, and it did more for social mobility than anything before or since. \"And we made the most of it,\" says O'Neill. \"Me, Michael\n\n[Caine], [David] Bailey, Doug [Hayward, the tailor], we all used to go to the Ad-Lib, and there'd be the Beatles, the Stones, Jean Shrimpton, Twiggy. You'd be sitting there in rows, talking about jobs we'd have to do when we reached 25 or 30\" - and this is a mantra repeated by many working-class Londoners who had their first flush in the Sixties - \"because none of us thought it was going to last. Something happened every day. You'd wake up one day and Mary Quant had invented the miniskirt, or Antonioni was filming Blowup. It's hard now to explain just how exciting it was, but nobody was famous then, we were all in it together.\"\n\nCaine soon became famous though, playing against type, as an upper-class officer in Zulu. The rest is Sixties folklore: Alfie, The Ipcress File, The Italian Job and onwards, until by the end of the Sixties he was probably the most iconic film star in the country. \"We were all really living that life. It was so much fun to be there - even if you were uneducated you could get a job carrying cameras for David Bailey,\" says Caine. \"There was this sense of possibility, we were opting out of the class system. What we decided was, 'Fuck it, we're going our own way and if you want to come with us, leave your baggage of class, colour and religion at the door. Join us if you are talented!' \"At the beginning of the Sixties I never knew anyone famous; by the end of it everyone I knew was famous, and I hadn't met any new people.\"\n\nAs we all know, the Sixties was a bellwether time of affluence and youth and all the Alfies. For many it seemed like unavoidable and long-overdue justice, when a generation of working-class Londoners suddenly realised that all those people for whom they had respect not only didn't respect them but didn't respect themselves.\n\nOvernight the great struggle was over, and in the space of about six months in 1963 there appeared to be enough for everybody who really wanted it. Caine wanted it more than most, and once he'd tasted the sweetness of success, vowed never to stop eating. For all the ambition, the creative quest and the inability to willingly give up the fame, the real thing that kept Caine going was the fear. The fear that one day the work would stop, the papers would stop calling and he'd be back, moving fish at Billingsgate Market.\n\nRather than any kind of obsessive need for applause, this was simply an ambition honed by poverty.\n\nThe man likes to feel safe. Ten minutes into our interview, his wife of 34 years, Shakira - who he first saw on a Maxwell House coffee commercial - brings him a glass of water, and then disappears into the kitchen to plan some charity event. This is one of those showbiz marriages, like Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward's that has lasted and lasted, essentially because they take it enormously seriously. Always have a family life, Caine would say when asked what advice he could give to a new arrival in Hollywood.\n\nGo home at night. Stay in. Have a life. One of his Alfie co-stars, Shirley Anne Field, said at the time, \"Michael seems to prefer foreign girls, maybe because they don't understand him. He may have the feeling that English girls might find him out.\"\n\nCaine works nearly as hard now as he did 20 or 30 years ago, and although many of the parts he does these days are cameos, he still has a knack for choosing roles with the same sort of abstract approach that has produced his patchwork quilt of a career. His next project is a remake of Sleuth, with Caine playing the Laurence Olivier role and Jude Law in the role originally played by Caine. (This is the second time that Law has stepped into Caine's shoes, the first being his rather less than successful outing as Alfie Elkins in the 2004 remake.) It's directed by Kenneth Branagh from a script by Harold Pinter, and is apparently extremely dark and extremely funny. Caine also reckons this could be the film that finally makes Law a star. He says he still chooses a script because the part is good for him and because it's different from the last one he did. But as he gets older, he looks a little more closely at the circumstances under which the film will be shot. Will he be sitting in mud huts in Tanzania, or staying at the George V in Paris? These things mean a lot to him. If he opens a script and the first line is, \"Alaska: our hero is stumbling through a blizzard,\" he closes it again. \"The worst movie I ever did was Jaws 4. I was only in it for five minutes, but it's bad. But then again, I was in Hollywood and was asked to be in a movie by the man who had just done Towering Inferno with Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. How was I to know?\" \"When I asked him why he wanted to do Jaws 4,\" recalled his former agent Dennis Selinger, \"he just said he wanted a new house and that was that.\" To his credit, Caine once said, \"First of all, I choose the great [roles], and if none of these come, I choose the mediocre ones, and if they don't come, I choose the ones that pay the rent.\"\n\nHis philosophy from the very beginning was to take as much as he could get. His old flatmate Terence Stamp says that Caine never knew what was going to be a hit, \"And as it's impossible to tell which movies are going to be successful, it's best to do anything that comes along. Even if you do something which looks like a hit, you should do another two movies straight after. So if the initial picture turns out to be a flop, you have two more shots.\"\n\nHe's made more than anyone's fair share of stinkers (reviewing\n\nHarry And Walter Go To New York, the New York Post said, \"This film just sits there and dies\"), but will then deliver a performance of such depth that it stays with you for days: California Suite, Mona Lisa, Hannah And Her Sisters, Educating Rita, The Quiet American, The Honorary Consul etc. The usually pin sharp David Thomson, whose The New Biographical Dictionary Of Film is one of the few classic texts of film criticism, doesn't get Caine at all, accusing him of being as cold and as barricaded as his spectacles, and accuses the public of being heartened by his ordinariness. But this could simply be snobbery.\n\nIf it isn't, why would he say that Caine is just a cockney made nervous by awesome circumstances?\n\nBut look who won. Look who became the most famous working-class emigrant, look who became the most famous Sixties Brit. Caine stayed around because Caine stayed level-headed. How could he be unfashionable when he had never really been fashionable in the first place? \"I always knew I wasn't going to be like Gerry and his Pacemakers. Lots of other people went whizzing by me but eventually they broke a leg.\" And Caine's still standing.\n\nWith many performers one gets the feeling that there is a \"Rosebud\" element to their life, some characteristic or trait or obsession or deviance or childhood horror that has either been deliberately concealed or dampened by time - indeed, the Rosebud element is the first thing a publisher looks for when commissioning a celebrity autobiography: were you abused as a child? Are you prone to unbearable depression? Was there a gay period? Come on, we know there was a gay period... Without diminishing Michael Caine's interior world, any Rosebud notion probably revolved around an age-old rhetorical question: would you prefer to be rich or poor?\n\nAt one point in the 1957 movie Sweet Smell Of Success, Tony Curtis' publicity maven Sidney Falco says, \"The cat's in the bag. And the bag's in the river\" (the secret is safe, the secret is drowned). With Caine you feel the bag might be empty.\n\nMichael Caine gives good dinner, as Tony Parsons once said, and you've only got to be in his company for a few minutes to agree. He has unforced, laconic charm, and is almost ritualistic in his display of good manners. A friend of mine who spent some time with the Caines back in the early Nineties said that during the day, Caine would knock about the house, being perfectly amenable, watching the cricket on TV and sipping his tea. And come the evening, the lights would go on, the wine would come out and all of a sudden Caine would become the funniest man in the land. Back when I worked for the Sunday Times Magazine, 12 or so years ago, we commissioned a cover story on Caine, to coincide with the filming of two Harry Palmer sequels, Bullet To Beijing and Midnight In Saint Petersburg. The cover shoot took place in a studio near his home in Chelsea, and he arrived on time, was polite, convivial and impressively low maintenance for a star of his magnitude. And when the camera started clicking he stepped into full Michael Caine mode - joking, laughing and swearing like a soldier. Fuck, he swore. The only other person I've ever met who swears more is David Bailey, another Sixties renegade.\n\nHis friend Doug Hayward has always said you should never argue with Caine, and if he says it takes a man eight seconds to fall off Tower Bridge wearing a mohair suit and seven seconds wearing a Harris Tweed suit, then you shouldn't argue as he'll produce evidence. He's forthright, occasionally loud, but never rude or overbearing. The endearing thing about Caine is his warmth, as well as the dispassionate way he talks about subjects that are obviously important to him. He is an indulgent interviewee, too, happy to be fluffy. What message will he have on his tombstone? \"See you later, no hurry.\" If a movie were to be made about him, who would he like to play him? \"Brad Pitt. He can do a very good cockney accent!\"\n\nWhat would be on his coat of arms? \"Probably a pair of closed garden secateurs.\"\n\nGet him on class, bad reviews, Britain or politics, and he can be pointed and definite and full of opinion. But he doesn't get angry. He doesn't do angry. Not any more. The last time he lost his temper on a movie set was on The Last Valley in 1970, which was being directed by the writer James Clavell. He went \"psychotic\", and regretted it for a month. It was Clavell who calmed him down, Clavell who taught him never to do it again. In one scene, Caine has to ride a horse, \"and the fucking thing ran away for about two miles, and I nearly got killed. When I got back to the set I went apeshit at everybody.\" Clavell waited until Caine's voice was hoarse and then asked the actor to go for a drink with him. \"So we did, and we each had a glass of vodka in the middle of the day which neither of us ever did, and he said, 'What you have just done is shown one of the most intimate emotions, and you must never do that. You must only ever be that angry with someone you love, because only they should ever see something that intimate. You have lost face and you are going to have to apologise to everyone on set. You must never show anger to strangers, you must treat them with contempt and silence.' He was being totally Japanese about it. And that has been my philosophy ever since.\n\nBefore that I used to lose my temper with builders.\"\n\nHis anger got the better of him during his tour of duty in Korea while doing his national service, where he saw active combat in a Communist ambush, when he was confined to barracks for a month after being insolent to the visiting Eisenhower: \"I suppose you are signing on for the regular army, are you?\" Ike asked, to which the young Maurice Micklewhite - he chose his professional name after seeing a film poster for The Caine Mutiny in Leicester Square - instantly replied, \"Am I fuck.\" Asked by a journalist once if his name still felt made-up, Caine shot back with, \"Not at all.\n\nMy name does not feel like a made-up name. I invented myself. I... am Michael Caine.\"\n\nHe tends not to vent his spleen in the press, either. \"The papers do the strangest things,\" he chuckles. \"Apparently I'm meant to be revamping EastEnders and bringing in Gwyneth Paltrow. Well, I don't know Gwyneth Paltrow and I don't watch EastEnders -­ I don't have that sort of life. I got called up in the middle of an England cricket match once, which we were losing, and after I told this American journalist how bad we were, I'm on the cover of the paper the next day saying the British are losers. I have since adopted a motto, which is: shut the fuck up.\" \"I've come a long way,\" he says, allowing sentiment to creep into his thoughts for a moment. \"My mother was a charlady. There was not a lot going on. And everything I've done I've done myself.\n\nI taught myself everything. Even how to enjoy music. I suppose that's why I'm still so curious. I suppose that's why I like this sort of music so much. Because no one knows anything about it. It's funny, isn't it? The only source of music my family had, well we never even had a wireless, we had a loaned wireless - my mother had no interest in music whatsoever - they were very intelligent people, but very simple people. They were not uneducated, but undereducated, which was typical of the working classes at that time.\n\nThere is no suggestion of retirement, either, as the thought of stopping when he can continue to get paid to do something he loves is obviously anathema to him. \"It's like saying to someone who likes to watch television, 'Here's a thousand pounds a week to do just that. When are you going to retire?' How about never? I love the life. I got it from my father's side, from the gypsies. There is something of the traveller in me, and the movie location unit is like the circus. I consider myself to be one of the more fortunate people in the world to be doing what I do, because it's an incredible profession and it has taken me all over the world.\"\n\nWhen he published his autobiography, What's It All About? in 1992, Caine wanted people who read it to come away knowing the following: One: It's not as easy as you think. Two: I'm not as stupid as you think. Three: You can do it too.\n\nFor a man who has often suffered at the hands of the press (he remembers his first review as one of the worst, when he was 14, on stage in south London playing a robot: the review said he was too wooden, he couldn't even do that convincingly), it's perhaps unsurprising that he no longer reads his reviews. Or so he says. He says the only critics he's ever taken any notice of were Dilys Powell, who used to write for the Sunday Times, and the\n\nNew Yorker's Pauline Kael, the doyenne of the art. \"If they said the movie was a dud then it probably was. When I started out, the critics were savage, and every movie I was in I was meant to have destroyed. It still goes on, but I try and keep clear of most of it. My accent got great reviews for The Cider House Rules [in America], but I got terrible reviews in England.\n\nWhat can you do? \"My view now is that a great review isn't going to help me and a bad one won't destroy me, so why read them? They can say Michael Caine is the worst actor in the world, or the best, and both are as silly as each other. \"I'm happy. I've got to a stage in my life where not much can harm me, not even a bad picture.\"\n\nOh, and the \"great idea\" at the end of The Italian Job, the \"great idea\" that would have sown the seeds for a sequel? \"We start the engine, and as the petrol runs out they all jump off. But when the coach goes over, the Corsican Mafia is waiting to collect the gold. And the next chase was to be after them right through the Riviera. But it never happened. The Americans made the movie and while it didn't lose any money it didn't make any either.\n\nAt the time they didn't count foreign money. They do now.\"\n\nDon't they just. A couple of years ago, a film-producer friend of mine who had just had his first hit was talking about various potential new projects over lunch. There was a historical romp, a documentary and a pipe dream, a sequel to the original Italian Job. In his head, the Charlie Croker role was to be played by a Jude Law-type (Jude Law, probably), the old Mini Coopers would be replaced by new Mini Coopers, \"On Days Like These\" would be sung by\n\nRobbie Williams, while the Noël Coward role would be played by - obviously, who else could do it? - Caine himself. \"There is only one person who could play that part convincingly, only one person the public would take seriously,\" said my friend. \"And that's Michael Caine. He's our greatest living institution. And it's all in the name. Let's face it, he... is... Michael Caine.\"\n\nOriginally published in the October 2007 issue of British GQ.\n\nWatch GQ's exclusive interview with Michael Caine for Harry Brown."
