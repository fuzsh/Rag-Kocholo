I was so happy to do it.\n\n\"I just loved the character of Bernie. I thought he was incredible, and it’s so beautifully written.\"\n\nHe previously teased his retirement in 2021, revealing on BBC Radio that he was suffering with a \"spine problem which affects my legs so I can’t walk very well\".\n\nHe suggested at the time that his role in 'Best Sellers' would be his \"last part\", adding: \"There’s not exactly scripts pouring out with a leading man that’s 88.\""
