        "text": "Caine History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nEngland\n\nToday's Irish surnames are underpinned by a multitude of rich histories. The name Caine originally appeared in Gaelic as Ó Cathain.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Caine family\n\nThe surname Caine was first found in Derry, where the name literally meant 'Cathan's Son.' \"This name may be rendered 'warrior'(cath, 'a battle'). The O'Cathains, now O'Kanes, were of the race of Eoghan, who was son of Niall of the Nine Hostages, Monarch of Ireland, who died A.D. 406.\" 1\n\nSaint Cainner or Cannera (d. 530?), appears in the martyrology of Tamlacht and other ancient lists of Irish saints on 28 Jan. \"According to Colgan, she was born of noble parents in the district of Bentraighe (Bantry) in South Munster. \" 2\n\nWe would be remiss if we did not mention the English and Welsh origins of the name. In England, Yorkshire was a popular location for the family. The Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 included: Johannes Cayne, Kirkby Overblow; and Johannes Cayne, Knaresborough. 3\n\n\"Mauritius de Cadomo held lands in Barony, Devonshire, in 1083. William de Cadomo occurs in Norfolk, Walter de Cadomo in Norfolk, holding great estates, 1086. Renebald de Caen occurs in 1130 (Rot. Pip.). The family of De Caen, Caan, &c., is often mentioned later. In Normandy it occurs in the 12th cent. very frequently.\" 4\n\nIn Wales, \"Rhys Cain (16th cent.), was a Welsh poet of the latter part of the sixteenth century, born at Trawsfynydd in Merionethshire, a village on the river Cain, whence he took his surname.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Caine family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Caine research. Another 147 words (10 lines of text) covering the years 1196 and 1672 are included under the topic Early Caine History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nCaine Spelling Variations\n\nThose scribes in Ireland during the Middle Ages recorded names as they sounded. Consequently, in this era many people were recorded under different spellings each time their name was written down. Research on the Caine family name revealed numerous spelling variations, including Cain, Caine, Kane, Kain, Cahan, O'Cahan, Kean, Keane, O'Keane, Ceane, Cean, Kahan, O'Kean, O'Kane, O'Kaine, Kaine, Keann, Cainn, Cainne, Kainn, Cahann, O'Cain and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Caine family\n\nAnother 42 words (3 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Caine Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nCaine Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Caine is the 8,589th most popular surname with an estimated 2,487 people with that name. 5\n\nLoading...\n\nCaine migration to the United States +\n\nDuring the 19th century thousands of impoverished Irish families made the long journey to British North America and the United States. These people were leaving a land that had become beset with poverty, lack of opportunity, and hunger. In North America, they hoped to find land, work, and political and religious freedoms. Although the majority of the immigrants that survived the long sea passage did make these discoveries, it was not without much perseverance and hard work: by the mid-19th century land suitable for agriculture was short supply, especially in British North America, in the east; the work available was generally low paying and physically taxing construction or factory work; and the English stereotypes concerning the Irish, although less frequent and vehement, were, nevertheless, present in the land of freedom, liberty, and equality for all men. The largest influx of Irish settlers occurred with Great Potato Famine during the late 1840s. Research into passenger and immigration lists has brought forth evidence of the early members of the Caine family in North America:\n\nCaine Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nAbraham Caine, who landed in Virginia in 1638 6\n\nAnn Caine, who arrived in Maryland in 1651-1662 6\n\nMary Caine, who landed in Maryland in 1668 6\n\nDarby Caine, who landed in Maryland in 1671 6\n\nCaine Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nHonour Caine, who landed in Virginia in 1702 6\n\nSusan Caine, who landed in Virginia in 1717 6\n\nCaine Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nHenry Caine, aged 52, who arrived in New York in 1812 6\n\nMartin Caine, aged 21, who arrived in America in 1822 6\n\nCaine migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers.

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life.
