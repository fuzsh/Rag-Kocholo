        "text": "Michael Caine is an English actor who has appeared in over 130 films and has had multiple television appearances. Caine's acting career began in the 1950s, when he was cast in many small, often uncredited roles in British films. Caine gained recognition as one of the most famous actors of the 1960s through his breakthrough role in the film Zulu (1964). He then portrayed spy Harry Palmer in the films The Ipcress File (1965), Funeral in Berlin (1966) and Billion Dollar Brain (1967). He also had starring roles in The Italian Job and Battle of Britain (both 1969). His role in Sleuth (1972) led him to an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. Caine has won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the films Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and The Cider House Rules (1999). More recently, Caine has gained a new following through his collaborations with British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight Trilogy films, as well as The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017) and Tenet (2020). Caine officially retired from acting in October 2023.\n\nYear Title Role Director Notes 1950 Morning Departure Teaboy Harold Clayton Uncredited 1956 Panic in the Parlour Sailor Gordon Parry A Hill in Korea Private Lockyer Julian Amyes Originally titled Hell in Korea 1957 The Steel Bayonet Caine Michael Carreras Uncredited How to Murder a Rich Uncle Gilrony Nigel Patrick 1958 A Woman of Mystery Minor Role Ernest Morris Uncredited Carve Her Name with Pride Thirsty Prisoner on Train Lewis Gilbert The Key Bit part Carol Reed Blind Spot Johnny Brent Peter Maxwell The Two-Headed Spy Gestapo Agent Andre De Toth Passport to Shame Bridegroom Alvin Rakoff Also titled Room 43 1959 Danger Within Prisoner with Pin-Up Don Chaffey Uncredited 1960 Foxhole in Cairo Weber John Llewellyn Moxey The Bulldog Breed Sailor in Cinema Fight Robert Asher Uncredited 1961 The Day the Earth Caught Fire Checkpoint Policeman Val Guest 1962 Solo for Sparrow Paddy Mooney Gordon Flemyng 1963 The Wrong Arm of the Law Police Station PC Cliff Owen Uncredited 1964 Zulu Lt.
