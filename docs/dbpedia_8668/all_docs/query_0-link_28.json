While Stamp came on as the smart tough mod, and Newley led with his pathos, Caine's basic persona was the upwardly mobile Cockney, with 1960s executive specs and crispy well-groomed wavy hair, who yet retains, without inverted snobbery and in a naturally neat voice, his Cockney accent. He was laid-back, too—tall, amiable, almost lordly—and his cool blue eyes bespoke calm calculation, bedroom sensitivity, and/or deep dark scheming. This balance of easy sociability and private purpose is of the essence.\n\nSon of a fish porter and a charwoman, Caine rose through rep to television, which he alternated with innumerable bit and supporting parts. Auditioning for a grumbling Cockney soldier in Zulu, he was surprised to be offered a lead role, and as an aristocratic young officer, whose authority must be overthrown by toughly professional Stanley Baker. Caine revamped his stereotypically effete character, so that his languid air proved deceptive.\n\nWhile Caine's performance in Zulu drew considerable critical attention, he languished for almost a year without film offers after the picture's release. Then Harry Saltzman, co-producer of the fabulously successful James Bond films, tapped him for the lead in the screen version of Len Deighton's espionage novel The Ipcress File. As the insolent, working-class secret agent Harry Palmer, Caine was a complete antithesis to James Bond. The long, improvised, supermarket scene in the film embellishes the everyday melancholy that extended Caine's rapport with audiences. The subsequent Palmer films, Funeral in Berlin and Billion Dollar Brain, the latter directed by Ken Russell, Caine's handpicked choice, neglected that intimate rapport with audiences, and failed. As did Caine's return to the character twenty years later in Bullet to Beijing, producer Harry Allan Tower's flat start to a proposed new series of Harry Palmer theatrical adventures that died aborning when the film was spun off to TV and video. In Alfie Caine's Cockney chauffeur, a smoothly relentless Casanova, with his insidiously cynical chats direct to the audience, stirred a deep uneasiness about permissiveness. It was a role shunned by almost every eligible star; Caine won his first Oscar nomination, and the film was the biggest-ever British money-earner in the United States. It made him the star he is today.\n\nCaine contributed polished performances to many lesser films, although his very Englishness, as domestic production flagged, set him adrift in productions of \"ersatz internationalism,\" as he called it. Of various war action films in exotic locales, the most interesting were two toughly ironic meditations on idealism and power: The Last Valley, written and directed by the late novelist James Clavell of Shogun and Noble House fame, with Caine as a thoughtful German mercenary in the Thirty Years' War; and John Huston's long-aborning The Man Who Would Be King, with Caine as the feet-on-the-ground adventurer Peachy Carnehan, opposite Sean Connery's upstart title character. In both films, settings and trimmings somehow eclipsed stars and themes intrinsically as powerful as The Bridge on the River Kwai or Apocalypse Now. Caine's long line of affable scoundrels and conmen extended to chillingly calm London gangsters in Get Carter, a pet project of Caine's directed by Mike Hodges, that has been relocated to America for a 2000 remake starring Sylvestor Stallone in the role originally played by Caine, who is set to play a cameo in the remake; and Mona Lisa, for which Caine took substantially less than his usual astronomical fee in order to get the film made. In Kidnapped his sword-fencing worked in well with his airily long-limbed command of personal space.\n\nCaine's sharply blue, yet softly bulbous, eyes suggested quietly devious, complicated, or creative characters. Pulp, Sleuth, and Deathtrap were dialogue comedies involving writers in murder-plot-andcounterplot; they were near two-handers, Caine \"duetting\" with, respectively, Mickey Rooney, Laurence Olivier (Caine plucking an Oscar nomination from under the knightly nose), and Christopher Reeve. A fourth variation on writer/reality games, The Romantic Englishwoman, with Caine as a writer fantasizing his wife's adultery, promised greater depth, but the eagerly awaited collaboration between Caine and director Joseph Losey seemed short-circuited by a tricksy script.\n\nCaine's air of mischievous sensuality explains his three gay roles: in Deathtrap (where he and Reeve kiss), Dressed to Kill (as a psychiatrist who is also a transvestite homicidal maniac), and California Suite (with Maggie Smith as sexually ambiguous Hollywood marrieds doubly nervy while awaiting the Oscar announcements).\n\nBy 1979 Caine's career again risked losing direction, with a run of parts in mediocre spy, horror, and disaster films. Educating Rita was a \"return to roots,\" to the director of Alfie, and to Oscar nomination. Caine played an extinct poet turned university lecturer, disillusioned by the grooves of academe, and vacillating between his textbooks and his whiskey bottle; but revivified by the cheek and eager optimism of working-class housewife Julie Walters. Alan Alda's Sweet Liberty and Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters brought Caine fully into the American comedy of manners. In Alda's film he sketches a film star surely based on himself. A gregarious Cockney now King of Hollywood, he good-naturedly jollies Alda, as a history professor, out of his misery about moviemakers travestying his serious book. In Allen's slightly sad comedy, Caine, a business manager for rock stars, is torn by guilt about loving two sisters, and ends up prey to the nervousness with which the Allen character began; an intriguing role reversal. Though every character but Allen's was dissatisfyingly foreshortened, Caine won a Supporting Actor Oscar.\n\nHe continues a highly popular star, though he is frequently criticized for being less than selective about the projects he takes on. He played the real inspector Frederick Abberline, the working-class chief detective on the trail of the infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper in writer-director David Wickes's two-part telefilm produced for the Ripper's centenary. The film proposed a final solution to the century-old mystery, naming the Queen's royal physician as the legendary killer, a solution offered by the 1979 Ripper film, Murder by Decree, as well. For Wickes also, Caine played the title roles in Jekyll and Hyde, the umpteenth version of the durable Robert Louis Stevenson barnstormer, this one produced for British and American television. For TV, he also played an unremarkable Captain Nemo in an unspectacular mini-series based on the Jules Verne classic; and gave a remarkable performance (sporting a convincing South African accent) as F. W. deKlerk opposite Sidney Poitier's Nelson Mandela in Mandela and deKlerk, a docudrama about the fall of apartheid.\n\nHe returned to comedy with Noises Off, Peter Bogdanovich's film adaptation of playwright Michael Frayn's takeoff on British sex farces, appearing opposite his old Deathtrap flame Christopher Reeve. In The Muppet Christmas Carol, he played Scrooge opposite a bevy of Jim Henson's puppet creatures in Dickensian garb. 1992's Blue Ice, a film he also produced, found Caine once again embroiled in secret agentry. He was a villainous oil baron whom Steven Seagal prevents from destroying the Alaskan landscape in On Deadly Ground.\n\nLate in the 1990s he returned to more meaty roles. In Little Voice he gave a notable turn as a sleazy talent scout who discovers an introverted girl (Jane Horrocks) with an amazing skill for imitating famous songstresses like Judy Garland and Shirley Bassey. And in The Cider House Rules, based on a novel by John Irving, he adopted his first American accent (down-home Maine no less) to play the sympathetic head of an orphanage and earned another Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his trouble. The busy star somehow managed to find the time find to write his autobiography, published in 1992 under the title What's It All About?, Caine's famous refrain from Alfie, as well as open a string of upscale restaurants in London and Miami.\n\n—Raymond Durgnat, updated by John McCarty"
