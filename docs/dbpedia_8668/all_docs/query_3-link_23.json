        "text": "Finding the perfect name for your baby can feel overwhelming—should you go with trendy? What about uniquely spelled? Should it start with a specific letter? Or stick with family traditions? With so many categories of baby names, it's no wonder that opting for a classic angel name has remained popular.\n\nFun fact: According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), Angel has ranked in the top 100 most popular male names for several years. In 2022, the name Angel saw its most significant spike in popularity, with 5,065 males taking the lovely name—representing 0.272% of the male population born that year. And in pop culture, the name Angel was most famously used for Buffy the Vampire Slayer's undead true love.\n\nIf you're looking for names inspired by angels, we found the perfect masculine and feminine angel name options to add to your baby name lists. Not feeling gendered names? No problem, we have some ideas on how to choose gender-neutral names too.\n\nMasculine Angel Names\n\nWe've got you covered if you're looking for a masculine angel name. Check out these 10 classic examples of angel names—including their meanings and famous examples, traditionally given to male babies.\n\nAngelo: Angelo comes from Greek and means \"messenger of God.\" The Italian form is Angelus, which is a sweet twist on this classic name. Famously, Adele named her baby Angelo,\n\nCastiel: This unusual angel name comes from Hebrew for \"God is my cover.\" It got a huge lift in popularity thanks to the villainous character Castiel (Cas for short) on the smash hit show Supernatural.\n\nGabriel: Gabriel comes from Hebrew for \"God is my strength,\" but this angel name isn't just popular in Judaism; it is also a revered name in Christianity and Islam as well. Gabriel García Márquez, the influential Colombian novelist and short-story writer, may possibly be the most famous example of Gabriel.\n\nHaniel: In Jewish folklore, Haniel means \"God is my grace,\" and it comes from Hebrew for grace, char, or favor. Haniel is also strongly associated with Venus. Famously, Anael, a version of Haniel, appears in the TV show Supernatural as a fallen angel.\n\nMalachi: Malachi means messenger of God, and according to the SSA, it ranks in the top 200 baby names for males. One famous example is Malachi Kirby, a British actor and writer who gained prominence with his role in the 2016 remake of Roots.\n\nMichael: Michael is an archangel that led an angelic resistance in a war against Satan, according to Biblical stories. That may explain why Michael is such a popular name that it continuously ranks in the top 25 names for males. A few famous examples? Michael Jackson, Michal Jordan, Michael J. Fox, Michael Keaton, Michael Caine, Michael Phelps...the list goes on!\n\nNathaniel: Nathaniel is a beloved name that comes from Hebrew for \"gift of God,\" but it is wildly popular in Christianity too. The novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, who authored The Scarlet Letter, might be the most famous Nathaniel.\n\nSamuel: This angelic name comes from Hebrew for \"God has heard\" or \"name of God.\" A few famous Sameuls include Samuel Adams, Samuel L. Jackson, and Samuel Morse, the inventor of the Morse code.\n\nUriel: If you're looking for a beloved but not well-known angelic name, try Uriel, which means \"flame of God.\" The name is considered relatively rare, but the most famous is Uriel Weinreich, a prolific American Yiddish linguist.\n\nZadkiel: If you know the story of the binding of Isaac, then you might recognize the name Zadkiel, which means \"righteousness of God\" in Hebrew. In that story, Zadkiel intervenes and stops Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. This name is so rare that it doesn't even rank in the top 1,000 SSA baby names.\n\nFeminine Angel Names\n\nIf you're looking for feminine angel names, look no further than these 10 adorable names, including meanings and famous examples.\n\nAngelina: This name is perfect if you're looking for a sweet version of Angel. The meaning from Greek, \"the messenger of God,\" is the same as its male version, and of course, there are many great nicknames like Gia, Nellie, and Lulu, to name a few. The most famous example is Angelina Jolie DCMG (Dame Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George).\n\nAnna: Anna comes from Hebrew for \"God has favored me,\" and while Anna wasn't an angel, she was the mother of the Virgin Mary, making this one of the most popular feminine names inspired by the bible. And it may be why Anna has a long history of royalty—more than 27 queens through history have been named Anna.\n\nArella: This Hebrew name, which means \"messenger of God\" or \"high-ranking angel,\" is a lovely take on the word angel.\n\nAriel: You might know this sweet name from the famous Disney character, but did you know that Ariel is an old angelic name that means \"lion of God\"?\n\nCeleste: The name Angel has many variations, and for females, Celeste, which comes from French for \"heavenly,\" is closely related to \"angelic.\"\n\nDina: Dina is the angel of wisdom and learning. In Hebrew, Dina means \"judgment.\" In the bible, Dina is the daughter of Jacob. In Jewish traditions, Dina was also the angel guardian of the Torah.\n\nGloria: Gloria is Latin for \"immortal glory\" or the sometimes \"hymn of the angels.\" Gloria Estafan is one of the most popular modern people with this beautiful name.\n\nMuriel: If you're expecting a summer baby, try Muriel, the angel of the month of June, which means \"bright or sparkling sea.\" It is a popular name in Ireland and Scotland. The most famous Muriel might be Muriel Spark, a beloved Scottish novelist.\n\nRabia: Did you know there's an angel that accompanies the sun across the sky each day? Rabia is Arabic for \"breeze\" and is an adorable choice for a spring or summer baby. This name is so rare in the US that it doesn't rank on the SSA top 1,000 baby names list.\n\nSeraphina: This name comes from the Hebrew word seraphim, which is a six-winged angel. Jennifer Garder and Ben Affleck famously named their daughter Seraphina \"Sera\" Rose.\n\nGender Neutral Angel Names\n\nNot feeling gendered names? You're not alone. According to Listophile, an online reference website that tracks baby naming trends, gender-neutral names have risen 79.4% since 2000. In their study, some of the reasons cited for the uptick in gender-neutral naming appear to show cultural changes in attitudes about naming, which include:\n\nSome parents acknowledge that their kids may be gender fluid.\n\nSome have a desire for a unique or rare name.\n\nSome want to avoid gender stereotyping.\n\nSome believe that gender-neutral names may be a stronger option for females.\n\nFor parents who want an angelic name with a spiritual meaning for their child, consider choosing one you love without regard for traditional gender rules. After all, names like James, Ashley, and Quinn were once considered masculine names but are now mainly seen as unisex."
