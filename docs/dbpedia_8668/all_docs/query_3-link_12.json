        "text": "Caine, also known as Cain, is thought by some to have been the first and most powerful vampire in the mythos of the World of Darkness. Like his Biblical namesake, he is the firstborn son of Adam and Eve and the older brother of Abel and Seth. He was cursed with vampirism by God[4] and His angels as punishment for murdering Abel and lying to God.\n\nBefore the formation of the Camarilla, most vampires referred to themselves simply as \"Cainites\" in recognition of their patriarch.\n\nBiography[]\n\nThe bulk of Caine's history is covered in the Book of Nod, the Erciyes Fragments, the Lilithian, and the Luciferian. These books conflict on Caine's motives, but all agree that he killed his brother Abel. The Luciferian describes how Caine gave himself a \"gift,\" and the gift was delusion. Using this gift, he thought he killed Abel in an act of love when it was really an act of hate. He used this gift to make pride out of shame, which resulted in being outcast. The Gangrel scholar Beckett is also known for interpreting the Caine mythology as a conflict between farmer and hunter tribes.\n\nLand of Nod[]\n\nA farmer named Caine prepared a sacrificial offering to God, of his finest fruits and vegetables. His brother Abel also prepared a sacrificial offering, it being of the finest animals that he had raised. Either there was a dispute over whose offering was better, or God really favored Abel's over Caine's. The final result ended in Caine \"sacrificing\" Abel on the altar, his brother being the \"finest\" offering he could give to the almighty, as he loved nothing more than him. As punishment, Cain's father Adam cursed him with a brand upon his flesh, and cast him out to wander in darkness in the Land of Nod.[5]\n\nRoaming the Land of Nod, Caine encountered Lilith. She noticed a swirling stain in the air around him; a mark of some dark, unfathomable power: murder. He possessed the power to kill higher beings — not to hunt as Adam had, but to kill as had Jehovah.[6] She was amazed, for he bore no signs of godhood, but wandered in the dust like a lesser beast. Seeing that he was cold and hungry, she welcomed Caine into the warmth of her home. Lilith identified herself as the First Woman, the original wife of Caine's father. After staying with her for some time, the two became lovers.\n\nIn time, Cain realized that she had powers and incredible magic that he too wanted to possess, and so he pleaded with her to grant him these gifts, in the name of her love for him. The hesitant Lilith prepared an Awakening ceremony by cutting herself with a sacred knife, bleeding into a bowl, and giving it to him so that he may drink.[7]\n\nAfter Caine partook of Lilith's blood, he was visited by three angels in a vision. These angels, who were agents of God, each offered Caine a chance to repent for the murder of his brother Abel, but Caine rebuffed them out of pride, seeing his actions as justified. Michael, when denied, cursed Caine and his childer to fear his living flame like no other. Raphael cursed Caine and his childer to fear the dawn, as the sun's rays would burn like Michaels holy fire. Uriel then cursed Caine and his childer to cling to the Darkness, drink only blood, eat only ashes, and be frozen at the point of death, cursed so that all they touched would crumble into nothing. A fourth angel, Gabriel, then appeared to offer the way of Golconda, the only way to \"light\", by the mercy of God.\n\nAfter this experience, Caine became officially \"Awakened\", possessing the following Disciplines: Celerity, Potence, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Dominate, Presence, Protean, Animalism, and Auspex. Caine then became aware of the Path of Blood, the Final Path from which all paths stem. And with all these powers, he broke his bond with Lilith and left her in the land of Nod.[8]\n\nCaine continued to wander the Land of Nod in loneliness, the memory of his sin drowning him in sorrow. It was many ages before he decided to be amongst mortal men again. His powers and his mark were well known to mortal men, and some even worshiped him as a god. Finally, Caine settled [9] in a small agricultural community, named Ubar. It was here, in this First City, that he became known as the “Dark Father.”\n\nThe Dark Father[]\n\nCaine finally settled in a small city , known then as Ubar. It was inhabited by the \"Children of Seth,” the descendants of Caine’s younger brother, and ruled over by the ambitious King Enoch. The people of Ubar had been aware of Caine's mark for some time, and were both in awe and terrified by the power all could sense within him. Some even began to see him less as a man and more of a divine being, choosing to worship him rather than Jehovah. Upon his arrival to the city, Enoch too sensed the power and majesty of Caine, and thus relinquished his kingship, so that the Dark Father might rule in his stead.[10]\n\nAccording to a Toreador legend, during his early years back amongst the mortals, Caine noticed a couple who were very much in love. Seeing their affection for one another amplified his own loneliness in sin, and so having dwelt upon that sin for an eon, Caine thought that perhaps he could reconcile something in his nature by Embracing the two with the gift of immortality, so that their love, like Caine, would never die. However, after having been Embraced, the lovers soon discovered that they could no longer have children together as they had wished in life. Overcome with despair at the thought of never having anything blossom of their Union, both husband and wife walked hand-in-hand into the rising dawn, to their Final Death.\n\nCaine was so heartbroken afterwards that he forbade anyone to ever speak their names, be it in his presence or otherwise. Thus, their names were lost to history, and they became simply “The Lovers.[10]”\n\nThe former king, Enoch, saw Caine's power and requested to be Embraced so that he too might share in the Dark Father’s gift. However, Caine showed some considerable reluctance due to the loss of the lovers he had Embraced decades before, and Uriel's warning. Yet the raging of the Beast within, the yearning to be with others like him, and Enoch ultimately begging for the Embrace, softened Caines resolve. He would embrace Enoch, and in honor of his newfound vampiric childe, Caine declared that Ubar now would be known as the City of Enoch.\n\nAfter some time, Enoch desired Kindred, a family of his own to love and cherish for eternity. At Enoch's insistence, Caine Embraced his second childe, Irad, imparting to him a strength unlike any other. Irad thus became Caine's strong right arm, a commander of armies. Soon to follow was Zillah.[11]\n\nZillah was so beautiful, Caine could not resist the Embrace. Interestingly, even after the Embrace, Zillah did not desire him. It frustrated Caine to the point that he was ripping his hair out of his head. He did anything and everything to make her desire him. Yet, she would not have him. Finally, Caine sought the Crone's magic, who ultimately tricked him into a blood bond, she forced the First Vampire to Embrace her. The Crone sent her new thrall away, telling him that his blood would have the power to bond others as Caine himself was bonded to the Crone. The discovery of the blood bond was what finally made Zillah agree to marry her sire Caine.[12]\n\nFor a year and a day Caine labored in the service of the Crone. However, Caine never again drank from the Crone's blood during that period. One night, he tricked her by saying he had terrible dreams in his sleep, and was fearful that his childer lusted after his blood. He asked the Crone for secret knowledge to protect himself against his progeny, and in response to his pleas the Crone went to a tree made of gopher wood and broke off a limb, sharpening it into a stake. She told Caine to pierce the heart of his wayward childe with it to render him still. Caine thanked the Crone, and using quick movements Caine seized the stake and drove it into her heart, breaking the blood bond in the process. He kissed her cold withered lips and left her to meet the sunrise.[13]\n\nNow there were three Second Generation childer who co-existed in the City of Enoch: Enoch, Irad, and Zillah. They in turn learned the ways of making progeny and had Embraced the Third Generation. Under Caine's order, he declared it law that no more childer be made. Supposedly they obeyed and the city prospered for ages, becoming the First City of vampires.[3]\n\nThe city's economy thrived on the technology and the agricultural \"know-how\" that Caine brought to the First City. One, having wandered throughout the Cradle of Civilization, he was able to bring Sumerian technology, namely \"the wheel\". Two, being a farmer most of his life, Caine had cultivated wondrous and perfect groves. So for generations, under Caine's rule, the economy prospered, and the city became a mighty Empire.[10] The Third Generation Antediluvians even built statues, shrines, temples, a grand library, and pools all surrounding a large five level palace, that Caine ruled from, upon his lofty ivory throne.[14]\n\nThe Deluge changed everything. It destroyed the City of Enoch and all of the \"Children of Seth\". Caine was so despondent, that he disappeared. His surviving childer and grandchilder sought him out, and when they found him, Caine told them to go away. Left to fend for themselves, the Antediluvians ended up \"killing\" Caine's second generation childer. When Caine discovered what happened, he sought out the Antediluvians who had rebuilt a new city, known as the Second City. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Father cursed his descendants with the characteristic weaknesses of each clan.[15]\n\nCaine's Return[]\n\nAccording to Noddist mythology, there are claims that Caine will return at the end of time to judge his descendants: the Antediluvians and all vampires descended from them. This event is known as Gehenna, the end of all vampiric races.\n\nThe Sabbat's epithet, The Sword Of Caine, refers to their belief that they will aid Caine in striking down the Antediluvians when Gehenna comes.\n\nThe Camarilla, however, deny any existence of Caine, even going as far as concealing or destroying books that even refer to Caine's return, thus promoting skepticism amongst modern Kindred.\n\nGenealogy[]\n\nCaine\n\n2nd Gen.\n\nEnoch, \"The Wise\"\n\nIrad, \"The Strong\"\n\nZillah, \"The Beautiful\"\n\nThe Crone\n\nThe Lovers\n\nKing and Queen of Enoch\n\nAbilities[]\n\nCaine's capacities are usually described as being outside the ability of the Storyteller system to model. Given that he is two generations beyond the power of the Antediluvians, it is reasonable to assume that he has completely mastered all Disciplines potentially to a greater degree than 3rd generation.\n\nCaine was able to see when one of his children's Disciplines had worked on a human. He was also able to cancel the effects of any Discipline used in his vicinity. It was this total mastery of all Disciplines that kept Caine in power, truly, for although he was a decent king and an honest law-giver, his Disciplines ensured that the rest of the powerful kindred stayed in line. Caine had the ability to create new Disciplines on the spot if he wished. It is thought that his power to do this was the forerunner of the blood magic and its several paths.[16]\n\nAlmost anything else about Caine's attributes follows the Biblical description: if Caine is harmed, the damage is returned sevenfold. In addition, Caine is marked with a sign of God's displeasure.\n\nInterpretations[]\n\nDuring the 13th century, Caine was revered in a trinity.[17]\n\nThe Dark Father: Caine as the father of the Cainite race. Medieval Cainites saw the existence of Caine as the proof of God's existence, as God was the only one who could have cursed Caine in that way.\n\nThe Wanderer: A figure similar to the mythical \"Wandering Jew\", this Caine is a wanderer who never finds rest, awaiting the day of judgement and hoping to one day be freed from his curse.\n\nThe Dark Tyrant: Caine as a wrathful figure who will judge over the sins of his descendants with biblical vengeance, ruling over them for a thousand years covered in darkness.\n\nIn the modern era, many Kindred have different views of Caine, reflecting the trinity popular in the Dark Ages, albeit as individual interpretations and not three aspects of a single dark godhead:\n\nDark Father: Emphasizing the eschatological aspects of Noddism. This Caine is a dark god who wreaks havoc and judgment on his descendants.\n\nFisher King: The standard \"regretful Caine\". The Fisher King interpretation feels remorse for his actions and now seeks a way out.\n\nThe Great King of Blood and Darkness: In Dies Ignis, Caine is depicted as the first being to deny the gifts of the \"One Giver\" in place of his own gifts, and thus as the one whose \"gifts\" tainted the rebel angels and caused them to become demons.\n\nDepending on geography, some vampires coming from a pagan background refer to a figure similar to Caine, although with another name:\n\nThe Einherjar of the Far North spoke of Canarl, who was granted immortality by Odin;\n\nThe Laibon speak of Cagn, who courted the daughter of the sun and fought the Lion of Death;\n\nThe Garou know little about traditional vampiric mythology and instead tell the legend of the Bloody Man.\n\nAppearances[]\n\n- a book covering the history of the world and its coming end, ostensibly written by Lucifer.\n\n- Caine seems to be a minor character.\n\n- the \"Fair is Foul\" and \"The First Vampire\" scenarios. In the \"Fair is Foul \"scenario, he is explicitly targeted and drawn out by Lilith for vengeance. In that scenario the Biblical curse does apply, and Lilith prepares a victim to strike the killing blow on Caine and then get squashed by the ineffable thumb of God. Caine is mentioned in passing in two other scenarios and presumed dead in the remaining one.\n\n- Caine is heavily implied to be Kapaneus in this novel. Where he travels with Beckett while witnessing the end of vampiric civilization.\n\n- a Book of Nod-style creation myth, focusing on Lilith.\n\n- ostensibly penned by Caine.\n\n- an alternative telling of the Book of Nod.\n\nBackground Information[]\n\nAlthough not covered as much in Kindred mythology, Biblically Cain's curse mentions (Genesis 4:12) that the earth will not yield any produce for him, which may be why he went to create the First City. The second part of the curse marks Cain as a fugitive and wanderer, lending credence to the suggestion that Caine may be the Cab Driver in Bloodlines a job where being unable to stay in one place is a defining feature, and even an advantage.\n\nA printout of this Wiki page can be seen in 2018 vampire film Corbin Nash. The movie is not associated with the World of Darkness.\n\nGallery[]"
