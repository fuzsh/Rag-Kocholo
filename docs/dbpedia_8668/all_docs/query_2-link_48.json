        "text": "Recently I was invited to the London HQ of a national newspaper to join the judging panel for a higher education awards event. On my table were luminaries from academia, industry and the media. As we were introducing ourselves, one of them said to me, “As you’re apparently a guru on the subject, perhaps you’d like to stand up and define employability for us.”\n\nThree seconds later, there I was, poised perilously between the soup and the main course, trying my best to dish up the definition of employability - a concept which even for those in the know can be notoriously slippery to convey. Clearly, what I needed was something pithy but illuminating; a metaphor to convey the intricacies of the concept without sending the massed ranks into a postprandial slumber.\n\nSuddenly, from deep in the bowels of the building, a muffled crash, followed by a cockney voice yelling, “Ere, watch it, mate! You nearly had the bloody door orff!”\n\nIn a flash, I had the answer. And the answer was Sir Michael Caine.\n\nYou may recall a scene from the 1971 film ‘Get Carter’ in which a gangster is about to throw the character played by M. Caine from the top deck of a multi-storey car park (crime in multi-story car parks: wrong on so many levels). Facing up to his adversary, Caine says, “You’re a big man but you’re out of shape. For me, it’s a full-time job.”\n\nAt least I didn’t do the voice. History is silent on whether Sir Michael has ever visited Liverpool, but if he has he certainly hasn’t picked up the accent. But the point is this. Just like physical fitness, employability is a full-time job. It’s not something you can ever definitively ‘be’ or for that matter have done to you. To be employable means working at it all the time, developing skills, enhancing and honing experience, adding to and managing networks. For me, this is the key point to try to get across whenever talking about employability. Because mastering employability is very much a full-time job.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nDr Paul Redmond is director of Student Engagement and Enhancement at the University of Liverpool."
