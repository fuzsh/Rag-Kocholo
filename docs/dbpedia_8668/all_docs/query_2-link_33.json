        "text": "As a matter of pure luck, I still have a job at Amazon. But some of my colleagues weren’t that lucky. Whether you are at Amazon, Microsoft or elsewhere, I am sure folks like me don't understand how you feel. So, do what it takes - let this sink in, embrace your emotions, indulge in self-care, and off-load the weight by speaking with a loved one. But when you are ready to ‘use the difficulty’ (as Michael Caine so wisely put), I hope you will see a silver lining. Whether it is the ability to take some time off, spend time with family, or just hit refresh and channel your career in a new direction – these are things you may not have been able to do in your current roles, and this opportunity to pave a new path can be priceless and freeing. You have worked for some of the best companies in the world, so there is no doubt that you will land on your feet and find another opportunity out there. These layoffs are not a reflection of your performance, but that of your company’s. Cut yourself some slack, pull yourself together, and put your head down to get going. I understand, all of this philosophy means nothing to most and it is all easier said than done. But in life’s most difficult moments, all I have wanted is for someone to say ‘It will be fine, you will find your way out of this’. I will be doing my bit to help in some small ways. Note that I will prioritize #immigrants as they are (in many ways) most impacted. If you are just as lucky as I, please extend help or lend an ear to someone in need. 1. Reach out for a free copy of ‘The Internship Hunt - eBook by Nukul Jain’, it has some simple, yet pragmatic tips on job hunting and networking in the US 2. DM for a 1:1 if you need help with reviewing your Resume/cover letter or want to chat about job hunting in general 3. DM me if you are looking to practice some case interviews. Please share the details of the prep (industry, role, focus area) 4. Let me know if there is anyone in my network you want me to connect you with. Please share your Resume and a quick intro too These are stressful times, but I hope this reminds us that just like our companies indulge in ‘self-care’ when shit hits the fan, we should prioritize our physical and mental health when our jobs ask too much of us. At the end of the day – it is JUST A JOB. And there has to be more to our lives than just deadlines and emails (at least for those who are privileged enough to be able to look beyond). #layoffs #jobs #techlayoffs #h1b #opportunity #mentalhealth Use the Difficulty: https://lnkd.in/gJenXk3j"
