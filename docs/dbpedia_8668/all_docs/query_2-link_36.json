        "text": "I was watching an interview clip this morning and it just really resonated with me. Like really resonated. It has stayed with me all morning. So, I thought I‚Äôd share this little gem with you in case you haven‚Äôt come across it before.\n\nIt‚Äôs from a 2002 interview between the inimitable Michael Parkinson with Michael Caine in which Michael shared one of his philosophies in life, and this was to ‚ÄúUse the Difficulty‚Äù. It was only about a minute long so I thought I‚Äôd use his own words here for you to read:\n\n‚ÄúYes. Use the difficulty‚Ä¶.Well, I got it from‚Ä¶I was rehearsing a play when I was a very young actor, and I had to come in this scene ‚Äî it was a stage play. I‚Äôm behind the flats waiting to open the door. There was an improvised scene between a husband and wife going on inside, and then they got carried away and they started throwing things and he threw a chair, and it lodged in the doorway.\n\nAnd I went to open the door and I just got my head round and I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Sir, I can‚Äôt get in‚Äù and he said, ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a chair there‚Äù. He said to me, ‚ÄúUse the difficulty‚Äù. I said, ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù He said, ‚Äúwell if it‚Äôs a comedy fall over it, if it‚Äôs a drama pick it up and smash it!‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúUse the difficulty‚Äù.\n\nNow I took that into my own life. You ask my children. Anything bad happens they go, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got to use the difficulty, how can we work‚Ä¶what can we get out of this‚Ä¶‚Äù you know? Use the difficulty. And so, there‚Äôs never anything so bad that you cannot use that difficulty. If you can use it a quarter of one percent to your advantage you‚Äôre ahead, you didn‚Äôt let it get you down. You know? That‚Äôs my philosophy. Use the difficulty. Also, added philosophy is avoid them if you can!‚Äù (Michael Caine, Michael Parkinson Interview, 2002)\n\nHow profound! What a really great, wonderful philosophy for life. Go Michael Caine, I thought that was just brilliant.\n\nI always say to myself and to my own children (or anyone who will listen really) to look for the silver lining. Out of something bad comes something good, when one door closes another one opens. And it‚Äôs so true, if you are able to stand back and look at a situation objectively, there is always a silver lining.\n\nThe universe has a habit of readjusting our course if we‚Äôre going in the wrong direction, so more often than not, setbacks, challenges and difficulties are there to help us change path, we‚Äôre simply going in the wrong direction and something needs to be changed. If something is that difficult, whether it‚Äôs holiday plans not working out, or the love of your life is walking out the door - then it‚Äôs not meant to be. It‚Äôs a big fat sign that something is not right, ‚Äòthis situation/holiday/person‚Äô, is not for you ‚Äîit shouldn‚Äôt be this hard. If all you get is road block after road block, then see the signs, feel your gut, and hard as it may be ‚Äî change holiday destination, find another partner. When something is ‚Äòright‚Äô things flow naturally, are easy, and full of joy ‚Äî not difficulties and roadblocks.\n\nWhen the universe throws you a curve ball, listen, pay attention, and react accordingly. Trust that what is around the corner in its place is going to be even better, even if you just can‚Äôt see it yet.\n\nBut this one phrase, ‚ÄúUse the Difficulty‚Äù is like the icing on the cake for me ‚Äî it goes that one step further, one step deeper, how can you ‚Äòuse the difficulty‚Äô ‚Äî it encourages you to adapt a behaviour or response to a difficulty that will then improve any difficult situation, now and in the future.\n\nThe human mind is fascinating to me. How unique it is from one individual to the next. Faced with adversity one person will give up at the get-go with an ‚Äúah well, that‚Äôs that then‚Äù attitude, while another will use that adversity as a stepping stone to get where they want to go ‚Äî even if it means a longer more circuitous route to get there. It just means more learning along the way, bigger life lessons, dropping the ego, maturing, ingenuity, creativity, positivity, independence, critical thinking, knocking a few chips off the shoulder, fortitude, resilience, etc. etc. It‚Äôs character forming. These are the entrepreneurs and the trailblazers of the world.\n\nI also agree with Michael when he says to avoid difficulty if you can. We should never go out looking for difficulties‚Ä¶however, we should try and attune our awareness to the fact that some situations may be just too difficult and to have the wherewithal to step back and remove ourselves from the situation or person. One of life‚Äôs most valuable lessons I learned, and it probably really only kicked in in my late 30's/early 40‚Äôs to a point where I fully understood it, was the ability to say no, to set personal and business boundaries. It‚Äôs also OK ‚Äî no it‚Äôs essential ‚Äî to allow people to fail sometimes, and it is OK to walk away from a situation. It was not my job to attempt to fix everything and everyone. (Now obviously one should use your discernment in each instance, but you get my meaning). Oh how this new found wisdom sat uneasily with my people-pleasing side for a longgggg time.\n\nOne of the worst things you can do for someone sometimes is to help them, to swoop in and solve a situation for them. By doing this, often times you are completely dis-empowering the person and they will never learn the lesson that life is putting in front of them. Also, we are further enabling their behaviour, or lack thereof, to continue and never be accountable or attain personal growth. This cycle will continue until at some point they face an even bigger problem or difficulty and actually walk through it themselves.\n\nIf someone you know is on the same hamster wheel of life, going round in circles, repeating bad habits and behaviours for most of their lives and wondering why things keep happening to them ‚Äî step back and look at the situation with fresh eyes ‚Äî do people (parents, friends, partners, employers, you, whoever) step in and continually ‚Äòfix‚Äô things for them, take over, plug a situation here, varnish over things with a few euro/pounds/dollars there‚Ä¶but actually, actually, is it their behaviour that is just not changing and constantly being white washed over with temporary fixes, while the rot underneath just keeps getting more and more pervasive. At some stage a complete renovation will be required! Personal accountability is a very real thing.\n\nThe above is just a little bit of food for the soul, a paradigm for the mind, but worthy of some contemplation I hope.\n\nMy name is Bernie McCullough, and not a lot of people know that! (Do you see what I did there? Groan, sorry‚Ä¶ üòú)\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nEnjoy the Journey!"
