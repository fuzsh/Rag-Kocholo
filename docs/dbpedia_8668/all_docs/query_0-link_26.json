        "meta_description": "Michael Caine. Actor: The Dark Knight. Michael Caine was born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen (née Burchell), a cook, and Maurice Micklewhite Sr., a fish-market porter. He had a younger brother, Stanley Caine, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War,...",

        "text": "Once said that he knew he had made it as an actor when he started getting scripts to read that no longer had coffee stains already on them (meaning that he was the first choice for that role).\n\nThroughout the 1960s, he was by his own estimation drinking two bottles of vodka and smoking at least eighty cigarettes a day. He quit smoking cigarettes following a stern lecture from Tony Curtis at a party in 1971, and finally quit smoking cigars shortly before his 70th birthday in 2003.\n\nStated that for years he hated the smell of garlic as he associated it with his service in the Korean War where North Korean and Chinese troops would munch it as a snack. He eventually overcame his dislike upon becoming a restaurateur.\n\nHe first saw Shakira Caine (then Shakira Baksh) in a 1971 Maxwell House coffee commercial, directed by a then-unknown Ridley Scott. Caine became obsessed with her, calling her \"the most beautiful woman he had ever seen\". He desperately tried to meet her, even planning a trip to Brazil. A friend of his said that she was living in London, and gave him her phone number. Caine and Baksh married at the Algiers Hotel in Las Vegas in 1973.\n\nIn 2016, at age 83, he finally changed his legal name from Maurice Micklewhite to Michael Caine. He said this was because he was fed up being delayed in airport security by staff who did not understand why the name on his passport did not match the person they recognised.\n\nIn 1957, at Brighton University, Caine appeared in a one-act play written by a fellow actor who went by the name of David Baron. It was Baron's very first play. He later changed his name back to Harold Pinter, the name under which he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005.\n\nHe is famous for the catch-phrase \"Not a lot of people know that\", though he never actually said it. The phrase was probably first said by Peter Sellers when he appeared Parkinson (1971) on 28 October 1972 and said: \"Not many people know that. This is my Michael Caine impression. You see, Mike's always quoting from the Guinness Book of Records. At the drop of a hat he'll trot one out. 'Did you know that it takes a man in a tweed suit five and a half seconds to fall from the top of Big Ben to the ground?' Now there's not many people who know that!\".\n\nThough he had been considered for, but never appeared in a Bond movie, Caine was the very first person to hear the completed film score for Goldfinger (1964). After he and roommate Terence Stamp were both ejected from their apartment, Caine asked composer friend John Barry if he could use the spare bedroom at Barry's London residence. As they were good friends, Barry agreed and so for several months Caine crashed with Barry and was there the sleepless night he completed his iconic score. At breakfast the following morning, Barry played his composition for Caine, the first time he had performed it for anybody.\n\nIn every film where Caine and Christopher Nolan make a collaboration, Caine's character either assists, guides, trains or educates the protagonist of each film. In Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), Caine portrays a magician who teaches the main character the art of illusion. For 'The Dark Knight trilogy', Caine plays a butler to the Wayne family, where he supports, nurtures and loves the main character Bruce Wayne (Batman). During Inception (2010), Caine depicts the father-in-law of the main protagonist, Cobb, and aids him in recruiting one of his students. In Interstellar (2014), Caine portrays a professor/engineer, who invites and encourages the central character, Cooper, to lead an important space mission that will determine the future of planet earth.\n\nIt was rumoured that he did not get along with Steven Seagal while filming Auf brennendem Eis (1994). He has stated that while they got on fine, but he hated filming in Alaska, even joking that \"On Deadly Ground\" was an apt title.\n\nAs of 2018, has appeared in five films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Der Verführer läßt schön grüßen (1966), Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986), Gottes Werk und Teufels Beitrag (1999), Inception (2010) and Dunkirk (2017). He was nominated for his performances in the first three of these and won Best Supporting Actor for Hannah and Her Sisters and The Cider House Rules. In Dunkirk, he voices the unseen RAF Squad Leader."
