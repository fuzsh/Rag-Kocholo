        "text": "Meet Maya the Bee. She was born into a hive of rules, fear, and prejudices that are bred into the next generation. From the moment she pushed through her honeycomb room, Maya has seen the world differently, questioned everything, and wanted to have fun. Her life takes a spiral turn to a possible never ending struggle as she attempts to share her open-mindedness with her fellow bees. But by sharing her “radical” ideals, Maya becomes an outcast and often told she is not a normal bee. Although she attempted to make an effort to be a good bee and follow the rules, Maya often found rules regarding prejudice towards other bugs “Kinda Silly”. Her free spirit lands her in trouble many times, eventually leading to her banishment from the hive.\n\nFrom the moment I started watching this film, I could not pull myself away. The story line hit home and I found myself feeling sorry for Maya, who could not find a place to fit in. Every child and adult has felt the need to find their place in the world and watching Maya make the same struggles resonated with emotions pushed aside a long time ago. Maya the Bee Movie connects with children, young and old, enlightening the fact that they are not alone in this struggle of fitting in. Eventually sharing the honest fact that the way to fit in is being yourself. You are special and can make a difference.\n\nWhile “Fitting in” is a common theme in the Maya The Bee movie, it is not the only idea buzzed upon. Maya is different from her hive in many ways. Unlike her fellow Honey Bees, Maya talks to other bugs, asks them for help and makes friends. The hive finds this ridiculous. If it was between death and asking a bug below their station for help, they would rather die first. However, Maya finds it exciting and makes friends with a grasshopper named Flip, a dung beetle, and even a Hornet, the enemy of the Bee Hive. Her compassion for others teaches her Bee friend Willy and other fellow bees what it means to be a friend.\n\nYou could almost do a direct comparison from this movie to our lives. The Moral is simple, don’t be prejudice. In the movie, bugs come in all different colors, sizes, shapes, attitudes, and smells. Maya looks past all that and gets to know the bug behind the outer appearance. We, as humans, should be capable of doing the same thing. Seeing a person for who they are not what they look like.\n\nThis line of thought could continue into themes of “working together”, “don’t fear the unknown”, “Remember to have a little fun in life” etc. However, instead of a blog page, this would become an essay drawing forth all the correlations between what we see happening now and what is happening in the movie. Instead, watch it yourself with the family and make your own connections. It will be easy to do as well. Not only is the story line a hit, the animated graphics are amazing. Truly, the makers of Maya The Bee Movie spent a lot of time creating the vast meadow and each unique characteristic in every Bug. As an adult, I expected something more child like, in the realm of Mickey Mouse Club House, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like a kid, I was drawn to the art and scenery.\n\nAnd if you thought the Maya The Bee Movie was only for young children, think again. There are Geek references to other classic movies. When a Hornet buzzes the sentence, “Nobody puts Queeny in a corner” I almost died laughing. I always enjoy films that are geared towards kids but also add a few nuances for the adults.\n\nAll-in-all this film is amazing for the whole family. From Geeky quotes to lessons in diversity, Maya the Bee Movie is one of the most touching and adorable films I have seen this year. I highly recommend this film to all families.\n\nYou can purchase Maya The Bee Movie from Amazon.com in 3-D Bluray + Bluray + DVD + Digital . It will be released May 19th, 2015!
