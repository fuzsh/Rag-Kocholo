I'm not really a fan of MTV and I don't use PlutoTV that much either. In fact I forgot I still had the App installed on my Amazon Firestick. I'd be curious to see what ends up being on the Nickelodeon channel other than the shows named.\n\nI'd also be curious to see if the Comedy Central channel might show Dr. Katz Professional Therapist. (and I imagine South Park? Even though it's still on the air now.) My mom has seen Dr. Katz before so I always knew about it. I was young when Dr. Katz came out so never had a chance to watch it. I remember the parody from the South Park episode \"Summer Sucks.\" I also remember the Dr. Katz parody from the Arthur episode \"The Contest.\" I may have to check this out when it launches.\n\nSG-17\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 12, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n510\n\nLocation\n\nPennsylvania\n\nApr 30, 2019\n\n#3\n\nFrom what I understand channels on PlutoTV are linear channels like you'd find on cable.

I wish they'd tell us more about what these networks are going to be and what their plans for them are."
