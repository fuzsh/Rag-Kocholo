        "text": "Among what I call The Junior Three (composed of Nick Jr., Disney Jr., and PBS Kids), I’d say that Disney Junior is most consistent with the kinds of great shows they put out. Many of the best shows have a certain element that can appeal to everyone, whether it’s the more complex storytelling of something like Sofia the First, or something that’s just meant to be more simple, wholesome fun, like Alice’s Wonderland Bakery. The upcoming series Kindergarten: The Musical definitely seems like another winner for the network. Let me tell you what it’s about.\n\nKindergarten: The Musical is an upcoming Disney Junior show slated for release on September 3, 2024.It’s definitely fitting for a show centered around school to come out just as kids start school. The series is created by songwriters Michelle Lewis and Charlton Pettus (the former of whom is known for working on shows like Doc McStuffins, The Loud House, Harvey Girls Forever, and Muppet Babies 2018), and produced by Oddbot Animation. They serve as executive producers alongside Kay Hanley, Don Petty, Mr. Tom Warburton (who’s also supervising director), and Laurie Israel (who’s also story editor).\n\nThe show focuses on a 5 year old girl named Berti, who attends her first day of kindergarten at Porter Elementary. She befriends two kids named Rose and Radish. She and the rest of her class go through the typical kinds of problems that many kids go through when starting school, such as working with your friends, acting as a team, and listening to your teacher, Ms. Moreno in this case. These seen like standard premises, but the twist here is that each episode is a musical due to there being multiple songs per episode. Not only that, we sometimes see a shift from CGI to 2D animation during certain songs. These little touches definitely help make the show stand out quite a bit.\n\nThe voice cast includes Andrea Rosa Guzman as Berti, Zander Chin as Radish, Leah Newman as Rose, Shyam Balasubramanian as Tej, Tandi Fomukong as Abigail, Kailen Jude as Kenji, Randy Perrine as Jamil, Alice Halsey as Kat and Ellie, Gina Torres as Ms. Moreno, Aloe Blacc and Ana Isabelle as Berti’s parents, Leona Lewis as Hedgehog Holmes, and Vincent Rodriguez III as Radish’s dad. Below is the theme song and trailer."
