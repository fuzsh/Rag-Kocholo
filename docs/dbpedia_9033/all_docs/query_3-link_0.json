For a list of programs broadcast by the Nickelodeon programming block, see List of programs broadcast by Nick Jr. (block).\n\nThe following is a list of programs broadcast by the Nick Jr. Channel. It was launched on September 28, 2009, as a spin-off of Nickelodeon's long-running preschool programming block of the same name, which has aired since 1988. The channel features original series and reruns of programming from Nickelodeon's weekday morning lineup. A late-night programming block aimed at parents, NickMom, aired on Nick Jr. from October 1, 2012 to September 28, 2015.[1][2]\n\nThe channel replaced Noggin, which was relaunched as a streaming service in 2015 and acts as a separate sister brand. Noggin's programming is distinct from the Nick Jr. channel's; it mainly carried pre-teen-oriented programs at its launch,[3] and its 2015 streaming service features a variety of exclusive series.\n\nCurrent programming\n\n1 Also aired on Nick Jr. on CBS/Nick on CBS.\n\nOriginal programming\n\nTitle Premiere date Source(s) Bubble Guppies January 30, 2011 [4] Blaze and the Monster Machines October 19, 2014 [5] Blue's Clues & You!
