        "text": "MORE ABOUT Nickelodeon Universe American Dream\n\nColorful characters, gravity-defying rides, and tot-friendly play structures will make Nickelodeon Universe® American Dream your favorite East Coast theme park in the United States. Located inside the three-million-square-foot American Dream experience center in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Nickelodeon Universe invites you to spend a few hours or a full day enjoying non-stop fun and entertainment featuring your favorite characters.\n\nThis 8.5 acre indoor theme park is the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. It includes more than 30 rides and attractions for all-ages enjoyment and is open 365 days a year. The rides are themed around Nickelodeon shows that range from your younger days through today’s faves — such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Jimmy Neutron, Rugrats and PAW Patrol. Plus — as you roam the park, be prepared to get a wave or a high-five from larger-than-life characters like SpongeBob, Dora, the Ninja Turtles, and the star of Blue’s Clues herself!\n\nFly like Shimmer and Shine and More Preschooler Fun\n\nWhat’s it like to ride on a magic carpet with genies-in-training? Little fans will find out on Shimmer and Shine Jumping Genies. Pick your favorite colorful carpet and hold on tight. Little ones will also love Blue’s Skidoo, a mild aerial ride, where they can hop on the back of Blue or Magenta and soar up, down and all around. Then they can sit in the iconic Blue’s Clues red Thinking Chair with Blue right behind them.\n\nBig and Small Thrills with Rugrats and More\n\nFamily-friendly rides include Bikini Bottom Crosstown Express — a wild bus ride through SpongeBob’s hometown. The swing ride gets an undersea makeover on SpongeBob’s Jellyfish Jam. And you’ve never ridden a carousel like Rugrats Reptar Go-Round! Hop on the back of the Rugrats’ favorite dinosaur and go for a spin. Saying “Roar!” isn’t required, but it’s encouraged. This cool double-decker, all-ages carousel is surrounded by Grandpa Lou, Tommy, Chuckie and Angelica, so have your camera handy.\n\nBig kids, teens and adults can test their limits on the thrill rides at Nickelodeon Universe, many inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Shredder is a super-tall and super-long free-spinning coaster with hairpin turns, plunging spirals, and high-speed spins. Endure the clutches of the Turtles’ most sinister alien foe on Kraang Prime Pandemonium — a 360-degree pendulum swing. Then drop in to Timmy’s Half Pipe Havoc — a unique, skateboard-shaped shuttle coaster based on The Fairly Oddparents.\n\nA Nickelodeon experience wouldn’t be complete without some Slime. Nickelodeon Slime Streak is a splat-designed, family-friendly coaster that zooms above Nickelodeon Universe on a bright orange track."
