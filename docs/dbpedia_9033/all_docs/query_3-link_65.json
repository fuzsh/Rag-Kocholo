[more info]\n\nNew Animated Shows:\n\nPremieres: Monday, February 12, 2024, at 5:30 p.m. (ET/PT)\n\nWhere: Nickelodeon\n\nInspired by the age-old tradition of settling things with your best friends, the game comes to life through the shenanigans of pals Rock, Paper and Scissors in Nickelodeon’s new animated series Rock Paper Scissors, premiering Monday, February 12, 2024, at 5:30 p.m. (ET/PT) on Nickelodeon. As the first short picked up for series from Nickelodeon’s Intergalactic Shorts Program, new episodes will continue to air weekdays at 5:30 p.m. (ET/PT) and internationally later in the month.\n\nIn Rock Paper Scissors, titular characters, Rock, Paper and Scissors, are a trio of best friends and roommates who lovingly compete over everything in hilarious but mostly wildly absurd ways. Throughout season one, the trio will go to extremes playing hide-and-seek around the world, running from the birthday police, defending the world from an alien invasion, going head-to-head with the Rat Bros and more.\n\nNickelodeon’s brand-new animated comedy stars Ron Funches (Trolls, Trolls Band Together) as Rock, the member of the trio with the biggest heart and moral compass; Thomas Lennon (Zoey 102, 17 Again, Reno 911!) as Paper, the wannabe intellectual who dreams of being a famous inventor; and Carlos Alazraqui (Rocko’s Modern Life, Reno 911!) as Scissors, who acts overly confident and always wants to be cool. The series also stars Melissa Villaseñor (Saturday Night Live) as Pencil, the trio’s incredibly smart neighbor down the hall and Eddie Pepitone (The Muppets, Old School) as Lou, the angry landlord, who is also a garbage can.\n\nOriginally launched in 2019 as a short, Rock Paper Scissors was greenlit for series from Nickelodeon’s Intergalactic Shorts Program. Produced by Nickelodeon Animation, the original Rock Paper Scissors short and series are created, written and executive produced by Kyle Stegina (Robot Chicken) and Josh Lehrman (Robot Chicken), with Conrad Vernon (Sausage Party) and Bob Boyle (The Fairly OddParents) serving as executive producers on the series. Development is overseen by Nickelodeon Animation’s Kari Kim, Vice President of Animation Development and Daniel Wineman, Vice President of Original Animation Development.

Reprising their roles from the film for the series are Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu and Brady Noon as the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael, respectively.\n\nIn the series, the Turtles will be challenged like never before as Leo, Raph, Donnie and Mikey each go it alone for the first time. Faced with new threats and teaming up with old allies, the Turtles will discover who they really are when they don’t have their brothers at their sides.\n\nTales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles currently has two seasons in the works, and will take place between the events of the feature film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and the forthcoming sequel. The series is slated to premiere on Paramount+ in 2024.\n\nPremiered: Sunday, December 31, 2023\n\nWhere: Amazon Prime\n\nFormally Titled: ZJ Sparkleton, Zokie Sparkleby\n\nThis buddy comedy, produced by Nelvana, follows quirky 10-year-old vlogger Ruby and her space alien best friend ZJ Sparkleton.

The series is based on the best-selling children’s book series written and drawn by acclaimed author and cartoonist Lincoln Peirce.\n\nAs a small girl with big ideas in the Middle Ages, Max will defy the status quo, fight for justice, and inspire everyone she meets with her feisty and fearless leadership. Not only will Max and the Midknights battle sword-wielding zombies, duel a malevolent sorceress, and tame a fire-breathing dragon, they'll also have loads of fun, forge lasting bonds of friendship, and push each other to be braver and bolder versions of themselves. Clever, kind, and seriously sassy, Max is always ready to lend a hand -- or a sword -- whenever anyone needs help.\n\nThe greenlight marks Nickelodeon’s second series based off the beloved works from Peirce, following Big Nate. The series will be produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California.
