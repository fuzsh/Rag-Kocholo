        "text": "Background\n\nNick Jr. Productions was the television production arm of Nickelodeon's preschool block, Nick Jr., founded in 1993. On February 2, 2009, the Nick Jr. Productions brand was folded into Nickelodeon Productions, as Nick Jr. was re-branded as \"Nickelodeon's Play Date\" at the same time (though the block's name would return to Nick Jr. from 2014 to 2023). However, international Nick Jr. channels (most notably Nick Jr. UK) continue to use a Nick Jr. production tag (usually in-credit) at the end of their shows.\n\n1st Logo (April 5, 1993-October 3, 2000)\n\nVisuals: On a white background, an orange dad (more commonly referred to as \"Father\") with \"NICK\" on his body and a blue child (more commonly referred to as \"Son\") with \"JR\" on his body (both in the Balloon font used by Nickelodeon at the time) are seen making \"throwing\" motions, like they are playing catch. The orange dad throws underhand and the blue child throws overhand. Several black lines and curved lines are drawn, tracing the motion of their arms. They jump to each other and hold their hands together. The final product resembles the print logo. The copyright stamp is below.\n\nTrivia:\n\nIn the Allegra's Window variant, the \"Grow, Learn and Play\" words were used for the 1993 branding of Nick Jr., which consists of a live action set with kids.\n\nThe dad and child are commonly referred to the title as \"Father and Son\" by fans. Their official name is actually \"Caregivers\".[1]\n\nVariants:\n\nOn 1993-95 airings of the first two Max & His Alphabet Adventures shorts, a still version is shown on a black background. This variant also appears with a copyright stamp at the end of a Little Bear preview on the VHS release of Blue's Clues: Blue's Big Musical Movie.\n\nOn early episodes of Allegra's Window, the words \"Grow, Learn and Play\" appear above the logo. Copyright info for Nickelodeon in its signature Balloon font is seen below. The words start out colored black, but each row's letters shake causing colors to appear (Grow, Learn and Play).\n\nOn Little Bear, the Maggie and the Ferocious Beast shorts and the Blue's Clues: Blue's Safari VHS release, the copyright notice is omitted.\n\nOn an early VHS release of Little Bill, the logo is still and on a yellow background. Below is the word \"Productions\" in black, along with the copyright stamp - considering this would've been a prototype version of the 3rd logo.\n\nOn an early video of Eureeka's Castle, a still variant is used where the orange dad is dancing with the blue child. It also removes the copyright notice and fades in from the credits.\n\nTechnique: Digitally-colored cel animation by Lee Corey.\n\nAudio: Usually the end theme of the show plays over.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn seasons 2-3 of Gullah Gullah Island, a synth piano jingle with notes being corresponded to the movements and a ending similar to the Touchstone Television logo is used. Composed by Peter Lurye and Billy Cobin on a Yamaha DX7.\n\nOn season 1 of the show and the original Sony Wonder VHS of Gullah Gullah Island: Sing Along with Binyah Binyah, the jingle is remixed in a higher key to tie in to the end theme, following into the Nickelodeon Studios logo.\n\nOn some season 1 episodes of the show, the remixed jingle's nearest end is cut short.\n\nOn Allegra's Window, a baby giggling and an ascending xylophone are heard near the end of the show's ending theme.\n\nOn the final two seasons, the tail end of the show's closing theme is cut short.\n\nHowever, on some episodes of season 1 of the show (and most VHS tapes, with the exception of Small Is Beautiful and Play Along With Allegra and Friends), the music is low-pitched\n\nOn the Blue's Clues: Blue's Safari VHS release, it plays the show's ending theme (including the bass pluck and squeak at the end).\n\nAvailability: This was originally used as part of Nick Jr.'s 1993-94 on-air branding.\n\nSeen on several shows of the era, such as Gullah Gullah Island, Allegra's Window and US airings of Little Bear episodes from 1995 to late-1999. It also appeared on the Maggie and the Ferocious Beast shorts (Treehouse airings only; US airings of the shorts are credits-less) and on VHS and certain DVD releases of said shows, as well as the end of the VHS of Blue's Clues: Blue's Safari.\n\nThe still version was found at the beginning of the Blue's Clues video trailer on the VHS releases of Blue's Discoveries, Blue's Big Treasure Hunt, Blue's Big Pajama Party, Blue's Safari, Magenta Comes Over and Stop, Look and Listen.\n\nThis was also preserved on reruns of Little Bear and Gullah Gullah Island when they last aired on Nick Jr. (formerly Noggin).\n\nWith the introduction of the 3rd logo, these were used together in tandem until the beginning of October 2000.\n\n2nd Logo (September 8, 1996-March 2, 2004)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a still version of the Nick Jr. logo is seen (it varies in shape, like Nickelodeon's). The parent is orange and has \"NICK\" on its body while their child is blue and has \"JR\" on its body. It fades out after three to four seconds. The copyright stamp in the logo reads \"© [YEAR] VIACOM International, INC.\", or is sometimes absent.\n\nAnimals Featured: The animals in the logo vary for each episode of Blue's Clues that has this logo (even episodes that have the same pair of animals) from the following:\n\nCat and kitten\n\nDog and puppy\n\nFish (sometimes referred to as \"Dolphins\")\n\nElephant and calf\n\nThis is also used on Oswald, but with a different design and more detail on it.\n\nPig and piglet\n\nGiraffe and calf\n\nDuck and duckling\n\nChicken and chick\n\nRooster and chick\n\nFrogs\n\nPorcupines\n\nPenguin and chick\n\nMonkeys\n\nKangaroo and joey\n\nSeal and pup\n\nHippo and calf\n\nRabbits\n\nBear and cub\n\nTurtles\n\nDinosaurs\n\nLion and cub\n\nSwans\n\nCrocodiles\n\nBirds\n\nA dad and a child\n\nA dad with a child holding hands together (print logo; from the previous logo)\n\nA dad holding a child (predicting the next logo)\n\nA dad and a child walking\n\nA dad and a child running\n\nVariants:\n\nOn 1999-2001 Blue's Clues VHS releases, the copyright is extended to read \"©[YEAR] Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved. Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Blue's Clues and all related titles, logos, and characters are trademarks of Viacom International Inc.\"\n\nA version without copyright info exists on the first two Blue's Clues VHS tapes ever released: \"Arts and Crafts\" and \"Story Time\". The ending theme of said show plays over this.\n\nStarting in June 2001, the logo was used as a primary closing logo at the end of VHS and DVD releases from Nick Jr. The \"Monkeys\", \"Bears\" and \"Pigs\" variants are known to have been used.\n\nOn the 2001 VHS Nick Jr.'s Imagine That!, the \"Monkeys\" logo is small, and three copyrights are under it:\n\nFor the Dora the Explorer episode \"Sticky Tape\", the top copyright reads \"©2001 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved. Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Dora the Explorer and all related titles, logos, and characters are trademarks of Viacom International Inc.\"\n\nFor the Blue's Clues episode \"Blue's Big Treasure Hunt\", the middle copyright reads \"©2001 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved. Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Blue's Clues and all related titles, logos, and characters are trademarks of Viacom International Inc.\"\n\nFor the Little Bill episode \"Super Family Fun Land\", the bottom copyright reads \"©2001 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved. Little Bill is a trademark of Smiley Inc. Original Little Bill characters ©1997 William H. Cosby Jr.\"\n\nTechnique: Digital graphics.\n\nAudio: The end of the Blue's Clues closing theme, concluding with a bass pluck and a small squeak. Composed by Michael Rubin (who also played Mailbox in the series).\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes on Blue's Clues, it has the ending theme without the bass pluck, or silence. VHS and DVD releases from Nick Jr. shows just have a silent version of the logo.\n\nOn the Blue's Clues episode \"What is Blue Afraid Of?\", a The General Series 6000 cat meowing sound effect is added when the logo appears, just before the bass pluck.\n\nOn later episodes of the UK version of Blue's Clues, this logo had the music from the next logo. This is most likely a reverse plaster.\n\nOn some late-1990s episodes of the aforementioned Blue's Clues, a four-note bell tune is heard (the last note held long) followed by a short piano arpeggio, before the bass pluck. This is actually a portion of the closing theme.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Blue's Clues until the episode \"Blue's Big Holiday\". Last seen when it was last re-run on Nick Jr. (formerly \"Noggin\") on July 1, 2019, although the series is intact on Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+ and its VHS releases, with the exceptions of Blue's Birthday (going straight to the closing Paramount Home Entertainment logo after the final Face segment), Blue's Discoveries (using only a Nickelodeon endcap) and Blue's Safari (using the 1st logo).\n\nAlso seen on the UK and Portugal versions of Blue's Clues.\n\nStarting in August 2001, a new version of the \"Elephants\" logo exclusively appeared on international prints of Oswald.\n\nThough Blue's Clues and Oswald were the only shows to air this logo on TV, the version with no audio and without the copyright stamp was also found on some VHS and DVD releases of Dora the Explorer and Little Bill.\n\nAfter October 2003, this was retired, leaving the Nickelodeon \"Haypile/Scribble\".\n\n3rd Logo (November 28, 1999-November 5, 2007)\n\nVisuals: On a yellow \"swirly\" background, the familiar orange dad and the blue child from logo are seen, both with \"NICK\" and \"JR\" on their bodies, though with a notable lumpy look (due to clay sculpting). They bounce around as the word \"Productions\", in a childish multicolored font, forms below them:\n\n\"P\" is purple.\n\n\"r\" is orange.\n\n\"o\" is green.\n\n\"d\" is orange outlined (its counter is filled).\n\n\"u\" is purple outlined.\n\n\"c\" is blue.\n\n\"t\" is green outlined (its apex and terminal is filled).\n\n\"i\" is red outlined, and its dot is heart-shaped.\n\n\"o\" is green.\n\n\"n\" is purple.\n\n\"s\" is green outlined.\n\nThe dad and child both hug and the child waves after the logo completely forms (closely resembling a variant from the previous logo).\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe logo was completed on September 9, 1999.\n\n23 years later, Webster Colcord on his Instagram found the original models in a decayed condition: the dad's arm and the child's head have been ruined or fallen off and the paint has dried off.\n\nVariants:\n\nA raw film scan of the logo has nothing below the dad and son. The logo is also zoomed-out a bit, revealing more of the painted background.\n\nOn 2000-2001 episodes of Little Bear and some episodes of Dora the Explorer, a warp-speed version can be seen.\n\nOn Little Bill, a purple copyright notice is seen.\n\nHowever, on VHS prints of the aforementioned Little Bill, the first frame of the regular copyright stops the logo, causing the heart on the \"I\" to be tilted instead of straight.\n\nOn American prints of Oswald, a black copyright notice (from the HIT Entertainment logo) is seen.\n\nOn Whoopi's Littleburg, an extended copyright notice in blue can be seen. The copyright notice fades out when the logo is completed.\n\nOn VideoNow Jr. version of the Blue’s Clues episode The Legend of the Blue Puppy, there is an error in which the logo uses a dark red color instead of the normal yellow.\n\nOn JimJam Africa prints of Oswald, the logo is still and the copyright notice (from the HIT Entertainment logo) is smaller.\n\nOn some Nick Jr. compilation DVD releases from March 10 to September 15, 2009, the logo cuts directly to the 19th Nickelodeon Productions logo instead of fading to black.\n\nTechnique: Clay animation by Webster Colcord (who previously made the Nick Jr. \"Hippos\" and \"Crocodiles\" IDs).\n\nColcord animated this logo in his garage on a down shooter setup on glass and defined the background as a watercolor painting. Ed Navarro provided the lighting and Jeffery Roth created the letters, which are CGI.\n\nAudio: A bongo rhythm with a tuba rendition of the Nick Jr. \"Just for me\" jingle (used from 1998 to 2001), a final sparkling note and some maracas at the end, with kids laughing and a Hanna-Barbera \"boing\" sound when they jump. The audio was mixed at Clack Sound Studios.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn shows such as The Backyardigans and Little Bill, the ending theme plays over it.\n\nOn some episodes of Blue’s Clues, the closing theme plays under this logo’s music.\n\nOn Whoopi's Littleburg and the raw film scan, the logo is silent.\n\nOn 2004-2006 airings of The Backyardigans and original airings of LazyTown season 1 with the split-screen credits, one second of the ending theme can be heard at the beginning of the music.[2] This also happens on DVD/digital prints of the Dora the Explorer episode \"Swiper the Explorer\".\n\nOriginal TV airings and Paramount+ prints of the aforementioned episode had this logo with the music starting as it regularly would without the end theme. Otherwise, the 2009 Nickelodeon Productions logo would plaster it.\n\nOn a November 2004 TVCosmopolis Greece airing of Dora the Explorer, another laugh is heard along with the original audio.\n\nAvailability: It made its first appearance on Little Bill, and has been seen at the end of shows from the era, usually pre-2005, like Blue's Clues from \"Pool Party\" to \"Bluestock\" and the first season of The Backyardigans. Also appears on the first four seasons of Dora the Explorer.\n\nThis logo made its final appearance after the split-screen credits on the original airing of the 2007 Nick Jr. TV movie Dora Saves the Mermaids. On DVD and current prints, the 6th logo plasters over this logo.\n\nIt plasters over the 2nd logo at the end of the first three episodes on the DVD release of Blue's Clues: Blue's Biggest Stories.\n\nIt continued to be seen on reruns on the aforementioned shows until 2009.\n\nIt also appears on the behind the scenes featurette on the Blue’s Big Musical Movie DVD.\n\nThe logo (along with the 6th logo) is retained on March 10, 2009-February 2, 2010 Nick Jr. compilation DVD releases (with the Nickelodeon Productions logo appearing after).\n\nAs of March 30, 2010, the logo (along with the 6th logo, and the 19th Nickelodeon Productions logo) is plastered by the 2009 Nickelodeon Productions logo on post-2009 Nickelodeon DVDs (which is from 2010-13), it can be only seen on Dora the Explorer, and Blue's Clues.\n\nLegacy: This is considered to be a very iconic and nostalgic logo, but it's also quite infamous for being another subject of usually low-quality \"logo edits\" on YouTube.\n\n4th Logo (In-credit variants) (September 3, 2001-October 8, 2010)\n\nThomas & Friends (Series 6, 2002)\n\nThomas & Friends (Series 7, 2003)\n\nThe Magic Roundabout (2007)\n\nPeppa Pig (Series 1, 2004)\n\nPeppa Pig (Series 3, 2009)\n\nWobbly Land\n\nBubble & Squeak\n\nVisuals: Essentially the same as the 1st logo, but it is still and in-credit.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn some shows, the logo has a gold outline and/or the word \"Join in!\" is under the logo. This variant was used on a white background on some UK prints of Angelina Ballerina: The Next Steps.\n\nAnother variant exists with the logo in a white square.\n\nOn series 1 episodes of Fifi and the Flowertots, the logo has the words \"Join-in TV\" in dark blue and written underneath it.\n\nMost shows used the \"Father and Son\" logo. However, depending on the show, it can be a different creature/shape/person.\n\nSometimes, the outline is a different color.\n\nOn Thomas and Friends, the logo is next to the 2000 HIT Entertainment Logo.\n\nA version exists with the URL \"www.nick.co.uk\".\n\nOn 2009 episodes of Peppa Pig, the word \"NICK\" is off-centered.\n\nHowever on Latin American airings of the aforementioned 2009 episodes, the word \"NICK\" is now centered.\n\nOn Nick Jr. UK airings of series 8 episodes of Thomas and Friends, it has the tagline \"A Nickelodeon UK Channel\" under the logo.\n\nTechnique: Digital graphics.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the series or silence (in other cases).\n\nAvailability: This was used mainly on international co-productions.\n\nThis logo was seen on select episodes of Fifi and the Flowertots and Roary the Racing Car (on PBS Kids Sprout).\n\nIt was also seen on Nick Jr. UK airings of series 6-7 of Thomas and Friends.\n\nIt also appears on the 2003 UK VHS/DVD \"The Chocolate Crunch and Other Stories\".\n\nIt also appeared on the U.S. Thomas & Friends DVD releases of \"Percy's Chocolate Crunch and Other Thomas Adventures\" (2003) and \"Best of Gordon\" (2004), respectively.\n\nAlso appears on series 1-2 and the first half of series 3 of Peppa Pig and the first series of Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom on Nick Jr.\n\nThis was also seen on Peppa Pig when it aired back in 2005 on Cartoon Network's short-lived \"Tickle U\" block (but not on Nickelodeon airings of older episodes of Peppa Pig).\n\nIt also appeared on episodes of Humf on the official Humf YouTube channel (unavailable in the United States) and also on the 2007 reboot of The Magic Roundabout.\n\n5th Logo (You Do Too custom variant) (July 3, 2002-January 27, 2004)\n\nVisuals: On a white background, a postcard with a stamp is seen placed on the right of the screen, with the orange dad and the blue son from the previous logos on it. The blue son jumps around, and is then picked up by the orange dad, with their final pose looking identical to one of the variants from the second logo. The text \"A Nickelodeon UK Channel\" fades in below the dad and son. A copyright stamp can be seen below.\n\nVariant: An opening variant exists where the postcard, the stamp and the copyright stamp are omitted and after \"A Nickelodeon UK Channel\" fades in, big text reading \"presents\" (in VAG Rounded) fades in.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation.\n\nAudio: The sound of a child giggling and laughing.\n\nAvailability: This logo and the opening variant were exclusively used on the Nick Jr. UK original series You Do Too, which hasn't been seen since its original run outside of a brief rerun period in 2010. As such, both the show and this logo are hard to find.\n\n6th Logo (August 22, 2005-January 30, 2009)\n\nVisuals: On a light blue/green gradient background, the orange dad and the blue child are seen standing. After a split second, a colorful water drop appears and the father bends down as the child points to it. More water drops are formed to make a puddle, which they jump around and splash in. The words \"NICK JR\" can be seen on their bodies like the 1st logo, while the word \"productions\" appears via a ripple effect below. The dad and child hug after the company's name appears, and four bright yellow arcs form over the puddle.\n\nVariants:\n\nA more common version begins with the father and son playing around in the puddle. The arcs are also removed and the puddle's animation is delayed.\n\nThere is a short version of the logo, which cuts out the first 1.9 seconds of the above version.\n\nOn the Blue's Clues 10th Anniversary special Behind the Clues: 10 Years with Blue, a copyright notice is shown.\n\nOn The Wonder Pets! and 2007 airings of Go, Diego, Go!, the logo starts with the orange dad and blue child jumping.\n\nFor Christmas 2006, the blue child makes a snowflake come out of the puddle a second after the logo starts.\n\nTechnique: Digital 2D animation produced by Primal Screen in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nAudio: A piece of music played by a cello and a clarinet, with the melody being a four-note vibraphone tune followed by a nine-note clarinet sounder. The music is accompanied by kids laughing and puddle splashing sounds. Composed by Evan Lurie.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn The Backyardigans and Behind The Clues: 10 Years with Blue, the ending theme plays over the logo.\n\nThe longer version has a xylophone/flute remix of Nick Jr.'s \"Love to play!\" jingle (used from 2004-2007) with bongos and a vibraslap (previously used in Nick Jr. on CBS' 2004-06 bumpers), accompanied by a different laugh. This was composed by Stephen Mank.\n\nOn Dora's World Adventure and Dora Saves the Mermaids, the 3rd logo's music is heard.\n\nOn 2006 split-screen airings of The Backyardigans, one second of the show's ending theme is heard at the beginning of this logo's music.[3]\n\nOn pre-2007 broadcasts of The Wonder Pets!, the Little Airplane Productions logo's voice-over fades into the Nick Jr. Productions logo theme, which, unlike on other episodes of the show, starts from the very beginning (minus the first note).\n\nOn the Blue's Room episode \"Knights of the Snack Table\", the audio is high-pitched.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe logo first appeared on Go, Diego, Go! when it sneak previewed on Noggin on August 22, 2005.\n\nSeen on Nick Jr. shows of the era like Dora the Explorer, The Backyardigans, Go, Diego, Go!, LazyTown (beginning with \"LazyTown's Surprise Santa\"), and season 2 of Blue's Room.\n\nThis does not appear on VHS and DVD releases of LazyTown, as it is replaced by the Nickelodeon \"Haystack\" logo.\n\nThe short version of the logo can be seen on Wonder Pets! and original airings of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan.\n\nThe long version seems to be unused and was featured on the Primal Screen website before the redesign.\n\nAnother sighting of this logo was seen twice on the Blue's Clues 10th Anniversary special Behind the Clues: 10 Years with Blue, during the interview with the pilot, and at the end after the County Line Productions logo. While no episodes of Blue's Clues used this logo, it was also seen on the Blue's Clues series finale \"Meet Blue's Baby Brother\".\n\nThe snowflake variant only appeared on Nick Jr. airings of Go, Diego, Go! from November 25 to December 31, 2006 and hasn't been found online.\n\nThe logo (along with the 3rd logo) is retained on March 10, 2009-January 5, 2010 Nick Jr. compilation DVD releases (with the Nickelodeon Productions logo appearing after).\n\nAs of March 30, 2010, the logo (along with the 3rd logo, and the 19th Nickelodeon Productions logo) is plastered by the 2009 Nickelodeon Productions logo on post-2009 Nickelodeon DVDs (which is from 2010-13), it can be only seen on Go, Diego, Go!, Wonder Pets!, and Ni Hao, Kai-Lan.\n\nLegacy: Also a favorite for those that grown-up with their shows from the time, even if it doesn't reach the popularity of the 3rd logo.\n\n7th Logo (In-credit variants) (September 24, 2010-)\n\nVisuals: Same as the 4th logo, but the new Nick Jr. logo (nickjr.) is used.\n\nVariants:\n\nIn the UK sometimes, a URL for Nick Jr. UK is seen underneath.\n\nOn some prints of Tickety Toc, the logo quickly fades in and out, along with the other in-credit logos.\n\nOn the Peppa Pig special \"Around the World with Peppa\", the logo is bigger than usual.\n\nOn Nickelodeon airings of Peppa Pig, the logo appears to have a shadow.\n\nOn season 1 of Digby Dragon, the logo is seen under the Blue-Zoo Animations logo with the text \"for Nickelodeon UK\".\n\nOn season 2 of the aforementioned Digby Dragon, the logo appears as part of the Channel 5 logo under the Milkshake logo and the text reads \"A FIZZY PRODUCTION FOR [Milkshake logo] AND [Nick Jr. logo]\".\n\nTechnique: Digital graphics.\n\nAudio: None, or the ending theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Like the fourth logo, this is used on international co-productions.\n\nSeen on series 2 of Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom and Peppa Pig during the 2nd half of series 3 and all of series 4, in addition to the 2015 specials.\n\nUsually seen whenever the latter airs on Nickelodeon, and even plasters the 4th logo at times, but sometimes it's removed.\n\nOther appearances include Poppy Cat, Tickety Toc, Zack & Quack and Digby Dragon.\n\nUnused Logo\n\nLogo (January 26, 2004)\n\nVisuals: On a green background, two frogs are seen, one orange and one blue. Then, a fly appears, and the orange frog tries to catch it twice, but then the blue frog catches it. The orange frog is briefly surprised and laughs with the blue frog as the words \"NICK JR\" appear on the frogs. Then, fireworks appear below them, spelling \"PRODUCTIONS\".\n\nTechnique: Cel-shaded CGI by Virtual Persuasion.\n\nAudio: A strange fantasy tune with a fly buzzing sound and the frogs giggling, followed by a five-note based on Nick Jr.'s then-current \"Where I Play to Learn/Along\" jingle from 2001 to 2004.\n\nAvailability: This logo was created as a possible replacement for the 3rd logo, but it was never used on-air.\n\nLegacy: For a long time, this logo was falsely rumored to have appeared on the first test screening of Dora's Pirate Adventure (a special that ultimately aired on January 17, 2005), as the only possible reason why the logo was unused is that it used the aforementioned \"Where I Play to Learn/Along\" jingle that in turn was retired on October 8, 2004.\n\nFinal Note\n\nOn February 2, 2009, Nick Jr. shows replaced the Nick Jr. Productions logos with the 2008 Nickelodeon Productions logo, and later on, the 2009, 2017 or 2023 (depending on the release time) Nickelodeon Productions logos."
