        "text": "Neil Vigdor\n\nI am a reporter for The New York Times covering politics.\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nMy focus is on breaking news, voting rights issues and election disinformation. My role involves a mix of reporting from the campaign trail, explanatory journalism and contributing to live coverage of election results, debates and candidate speeches.I am especially interested in tracking voting legislation, keeping tabs on threats against election offices and officials and more broadly, monitoring actions that undermine democracy.\n\nMy Background\n\nPreviously, I covered a wide range of breaking news stories, including the police killing of George Floyd, several mass shootings, pandemic-related news and more. I have written about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, pandemic grifting, cold case breakthroughs, hurricanes and eclectic topics, like bee infestations and the story of a man who tried and failed to walk on water from Florida to New York on a hamster wheel.\n\nI graduated from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., where I was editor of the student newspaper. I covered Connecticut and national politics for The Hartford Courant and Hearst, reporting on four national conventions and two inaugurations. I was named an outstanding state political reporter by The Fix, The Washington Post’s political blog. When I am not reporting, I moonlight in celestial and street photography.\n\nJournalistic Ethics\n\nIndependence and sound news judgment are the bedrock of covering politics. That’s why I place a heavy emphasis on seeking out a variety of voices and perspectives for stories. Not only is it vital to be accurate and transparent, it’s critical that we understand the nuances of the issues that we’re writing about, both for the sake of readers and sources. I am uncompromisingly apolitical, including how I conduct myself on social media. You can learn more about The Times’s ethics policy here."
