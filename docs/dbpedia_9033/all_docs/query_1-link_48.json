        "text": "Mayan Jungle Bee Honey is the result of an ancestral and artisanal harvesting process. The hives are hollow tree trunks, in which we can harvest without smoking the bees. The honey is then centrifuged cold and filtered until it is pure.\n\nOur honey is extracted by our Apis bees according to the season, tropical flowers such as Xtabentun, Dzidzilch and many others but its dominant comes from the Chac√† tree, the sacred tree of the Mayas. These endemic trees of the Yucatan gives it a woody, flowery aroma with a strong and persistent intensity. Maya Jungle Honey is a rare and high quality honey.\n\nHoney from Mayan Jungle Bees can crystallize; this is a phenomenon that proves that this honey is 100% natural, and that it has not been heated. If you want to give it back its liquid texture, just put it in a ray of sunlight."
