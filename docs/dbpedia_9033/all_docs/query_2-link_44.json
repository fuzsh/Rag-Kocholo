        "text": "In recent years, European artists have created animated\n\nfeatures that were original, exciting, funny and personal in ways big-budget\n\nAmerican studio films weren’t: The\n\nTriplets of Belleville, The Secret of\n\nKells, Ernest and Celestine, Song of the Sea, A Cat in Paris. Sadly, The\n\n“Maya the Bee” Movie (2014), an Australian/German co-production, just\n\nrepeats very familiar American-style characters and story incidents.\n\nIn Waldemar Bonsels’ original 1922 children’s book “The\n\nAdventures of Maya the Bee,” the title character was a curious youngster who\n\nleft the hive to explore nearby gardens and meadows. Bonsel was obviously\n\ninspired by Lewis Carroll’s “Alice” books, but he lacked Carroll’s erudition\n\nand imagination. Freed from the constraints of the hive, Maya engaged in mildly\n\ndidactic conversations with other insects. The story took an oddly dark turn\n\nwhen Maya was captured by a tribe of carnivorous hornets, but escaped to help\n\ndefend her hive from their murderous assault. The threats were real, with the\n\ncharacters’ lives at stake.\n\nThe animated Maya (voice by Coco Jack Gillies) looks like a\n\nlittle girl in a striped bathing suit. She and many of the characters around\n\nher never stop talking, but that doesn’t keep Maya from exploring parts of the\n\nhive where she doesn’t belong. Although she’s taught “Every bee has a role to\n\nplay,” after some mild misadventures, she faces the same problem as many other\n\nspunky animated heroines: ”I don’t think I fit in anywhere.”\n\nWhen she inadvertently witnesses the priggish, dictatorial\n\nBuzzlina (Jacki Weaver) scheming with her hench-bee Crawley (Noah Taylor) to\n\nkill the Queen (Miriam Margolyes) and seize the throne, Maya is kicked out of\n\nthe hive as a trouble-maker. Outside, Maya behaves less like Bonsels’ inquisitive\n\ncharacter and more like Dorothy in The\n\nWizard of Oz. Everyone she meets is eager to help her. Flip the Grasshopper\n\n(Richard Boxburgh) gets her to sing; Willy (Kodi Sit-McPhee), a nerdy little bee\n\nwhom no one else has ever treated nicely, becomes her pal.\n\nBefore they left the hive, Maya and Willy were told to beware\n\nof hornets, whom bees regard as evil, thieving bugs. They quickly befriend\n\nSting (Joel Franco), the son of Hank (Andy McPhee), the boss of one of the\n\nlocal hornet gangs. Sting’s been told to beware of bees, whom hornets describe\n\nas evil “soul suckers.” Of course, Maya, Willy and Sting initially fail to\n\nrecognize who belongs to what species, but once they do, the story’s\n\nessentially over—and the film still has a good 20 minutes to run.\n\nBuzzlina tries to provoke a war with the hornets, but it’s a\n\nbloodless farce, with none of the deadly consequences Bonsels described. As\n\nanyone who’s seen an animated feature in the last few decades can predict, Maya\n\nrallies her friends to stop the war, rescue the Queen and, above all, learn the\n\nimportance of being herself every day. The film ends with a party\n\nwhere—surprise!–Hank and the Queen self-conscious dance together.\n\nThe “Maya the Bee”\n\nMovie isn’t excruciating the way Strange\n\nMagic was. But its story and characters are so very familiar, it feels like\n\nthe artists made it with a stencil. Do audiences, especially audiences of\n\nchildren–Maya is clearly aimed at\n\nelementary school viewers–need to see yet another spunky, slightly klutzy\n\nheroine learn the value of being herself? Are children so unhappy and insecure\n\nthat they need yet another dose of heavy-handed affirmation?\n\nOne of the appeals of anime is that Japanese artists have\n\ncreated such a broad spectrum of female characters. Sakura Kinimoto begins as a\n\nfrightened, uncertain little girl, but the audience sees her gain confidence as\n\nshe masters magic in Cardcaptor Sakura.\n\nSpoiled, sulky Chihiro discovers untapped resources of courage, resolve and\n\nlove in Spirited Away. Emilia in The Devil Is a Part-Timer and Kaname in Full Metal Panic are strong, outspoken\n\ngirls who learn to appreciate the offbeat charms of unlikely guys. Shy, quiet\n\nHana grows into her role as a caring mother after her husband is killed in Wolf Children. Winrey in Fullmetal Alchemist is a skilled\n\ntechnician who creates extraordinary robotic prostheses.\n\nYet American animators can’t seem to go beyond the spunky,\n\nslightly klutzy model, and the team behind The\n\n“Maya the Bee” Movie followed suit. During the film, I kept remembering the\n\nfamous exchange with Ed Asner on The Mary\n\nTyler Moore Show:\n\nLou: “You know what? You’ve got spunk.”\n\nMary: “Well, yes… “\n\nLou: “I hate spunk.”"
