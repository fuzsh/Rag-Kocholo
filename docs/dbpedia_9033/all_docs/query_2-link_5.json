If you don't like spoilers, you'd better leave this page.\n\nMaya the Bee: First Flight (promoted theatrically as Maya the Bee Movie) is a 2014 3D German-canadian computer-animated comedy adventure film directed by Alexs Stadermann, loosely based on the 1975 anime Maya the Honey Bee as well as indirectly the German children’s book of the same name by Waldemar Bonsels. It features the voices of Coco Jack Gillies, Julia Sawalha, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Noah Taylor, Richard Roxburgh, Jacki Weaver, The Umbilical Brothers and Miriam Margolyes.

She dreams of an exciting life of freedom, fun and adventure and often behaves like a little whirlwind and won’t follow the rules of the hive. One of these rules is not to trust the hornets that live beyond the meadow. Her funny attempts to fit in bring her into trouble with the Queen's narrow-minded and villainous royal advisor Buzzlina Von Beena.\n\nWhen Maya discovers her plot to steal The Queen’s Royal Jelly, the hornets are suspected and Maya is thought to be their accomplice. No one believes that she is the innocent victim and she is banished from the hive and into the meadow. With her best good-natured and best friend Willy tagging along, they buzz away on an exhilarating adventure of self-discovery.\n\nWhile most bees believe that other insects should be feared, Maya can't help but make friends with Flip the charismatic and eccentric grasshopper, Kurt the dung beetle and even Sting, a young hornet. After a long and eventful journey to the hornets hive, they soon discover the true culprit and together they have to stop the fight between bees and hornets before it’s too late.\n\nProduction[]\n\nAnimation World Network announced that Universum Film would distribute all German rights of the film. The film is directed by Alexs Stadermann, produced by Patrick Elmendorff and Thorsten Wegener from Studio 100 Animation, and Jim Ballantine and Barbara Stephen from Buzz Studios. The film was produced in association with Flying Bark Productions and ZDF. This film was Coco Jack Gillies' film debut as she voiced the role of Maya. Gillies was 9 years old at the time of production.\n\nGallery[]\n\nMaya the Bee Movie/Gallery\n\nTrailers and teasers[]\n\nTranscript[]"
