        "meta_description": "When a tribute announcement demanding half the hive’s honey threatens the very survival of the hive, Maya, and her sidekick Willy, defy the queen’s orders and go to Buzztropolis to confront the Empress. The Empress invites them to participate in the Honey Games, however she explains that if they win, all is forgiven, but if they lose she will take all of the summer honey. Maya and Willy’s teammates are neither enthusiastic nor athletic, but Maya remains positive and exclaims that “every bug has a talent!” While securing her hive’s future and gaining new friends, Maya learns about teamwork, account ability, and overcoming preconceived notions.",

        "text": "Continuing the story of Maya and her hive of friends, Maya the Bee 2: The Honey Games explores and instructs on themes of teamwork and individual gifts. After all, “Every bug has a talent!” is Maya’s motto that she brings along with her throughout the film. This positive momentum is what she brings to her team, and is so contagious that she can help others discover their gifts.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Maya doesn’t have her own faults. Her positivity can be so self-focused that she forgets how to work for the greater good of her hive. She speaks out against her elders and allows rash actions to get in her way. However, these are trials seen by Maya to overcome and strengthen, and the film’s use of bright and cheery animation only welcomes younger audiences to take on these traits in their own lives. What Maya Maya the Bee 2 stand out is how Maya is not simply a platform for self-betterment, but instead hones her skills and builds others up along the way. As an audience, it is most encouraging to see how others can reach out and help, and the film captures this idea beautifully. Dove is proud to award Maya the Bee 2: The Honey Games with approval for All Ages."
