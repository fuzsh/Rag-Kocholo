        "text": "BURBANK -- Nickelodeon is expanding the underwater world of Baby Shark with the greenlight of a new animated preschool series, Baby Shark’s Big Show! (working title), based on the world-famous pop culture phenomenon. Co-produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio and SmartStudy, the 2D-animated series (26 half-hour episodes) will follow Baby Shark and his best friend William as they journey on fun-filled comedic adventures in their community of Carnivore Cove, meet new friends and sing original catchy tunes along the way.\n\n“Having the opportunity to dive deeper into this incredible world and create all-new storylines has been extremely exciting, and our head of preschool Eryk Casemiro and his team can’t wait to help grow the Baby Shark universe and fanbase with an amazing new series that captures the heart and spirit of this beloved property,” commented Nickelodeon executive vice president, animation production and development, Ramsey Naito.\n\nBaby Shark’s Big Show! will debut with an all-new original holiday special this December, with premieres rolling out across Nickelodeon’s preschool platforms in spring 2021. Following the U.S. launch, the series will roll out on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. channels internationally. ViacomCBS Consumer Products (VCP) is managing consumer products licensing for the series worldwide, excluding China, Korea, and Southeast Asia.\n\nBaby Shark launched on YouTube in November 2015 and amassed 5.7 billion views, becoming the second most-watched video in the platform’s history. With music, characters, story and dance all combined, the song recorded a 20-week-streak on the Billboard Hot 100 and spawned a viral phenomenon #BabySharkChallenge, generating over one million cover videos around the globe.\n\nBaby Shark’s Big Show! is executive produced by Gary “Doodles” DiRaffaele (Breadwinners) and Tommy Sica (Breadwinners), with Whitney Ralls (My Little Pony: Equestria Girls) serving as co-executive producer. The production will be overseen by Nickelodeon Preschool senior VP, Eryk Casemiro.\n\nThe series is the latest to join Nickelodeon’s preschool lineup which includes Ryan’s Mystery Playdate, Bubble Guppies and Blaze, and the Monster Machines. It is part of Nick’s strategy to be home to the most popular franchises for kids and their families, expanding their growing portfolio of properties that already includes SpongeBob SquarePants, PAW Patrol, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Blue’s Clues & You!, the first-ever SpongeBob spinoff, Kamp Koral, The Smurfs and an all-new animated Star Trek series.\n\nSource: Nickelodeon"
