        "text": "I think of all the things I’ve posted on this blog, the Tadpole sings category affords me the most retrospective amusement.\n\nListening to her ‘performance’ of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, in French and English, aged two, makes me realise what a long way we’ve come (and just how long I’ve been blogging).\n\nPlaying the song she invented, aged four, about falling down and ripping open her top lip on a jagged manhole cover simultaneously brings tears to my eyes and makes me laugh out loud.\n\nI’m not one for taking a lot of photos, and almost never think to film anything, but I’ll definitely be hanging on to these audio clips for posterity.\n\nTodays podcast features Tadpole’s rendition of the theme tune to a cartoon which was enormously popular in France in the late 70’s and early 80’s, Maya l’Abeille (Maya the Bee). Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think Maya ever aired in the UK, even if the Austro-Japanese production seems to have enjoyed success elsewhere around the world.\n\nSo I have Mr Frog and his fondness for showing Tadpole clips of favourite children’s programmes from his youth on YouTube* to thank.\n\nhttps://petiteanglaise.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/maya.mp3\n\nAnd the funny noises are, um, kisses. I believe there are three. Tadpole was in an affectionate mood…\n\n*original version of the Maya theme tune. Extremely high pitched singing alert. Play at your own risk."
