        "text": "There has been quite a furore surrounding cutesy Netflix children’s cartoon Maya the Bee.\n\nThe premise seems innocent enough. Sweet insect Maya leaves her hive to discover the world around her, educating kids on the beauty of nature along the way.\n\nRecently however, Maya has been more naturist than naturalist.\n\nA drawing of a penis was spotted in the background of a recent episode, leading to a wave of controversy.\n\nReportedly the work of a rogue artist, the incident – in an episode fittingly titled ‘King Willi’ – caused a number of outraged parents to condemn the show.\n\nYet the appearance of sexual innuendos and rude images in kids TV shows is nothing new.\n\nIn fact, it has been happening for as long as cartoons have been broadcast.\n\n‘It starts with some sweets…’\n\nBroadcast in Britain in the 1960s and 70s, clay-mation classic The Magic Roundabout featured more drug references than an episode of Breaking Bad.\n\nThe series, which originally ran on the BBC for 12 years, had copious underlying references to illicit substance use.\n\nExcitable Dougal, a shaggy dog with boundless energy and an addiction to sugar cubes, famously claimed: “It starts with some sweets…and then you’re on two bags a day.”\n\nHis best friend Dylan, a rabbit who plays guitar and sleeps a lot, was assumed by many adults to be smoking pot off-camera.\n\nMeanwhile, loveable cow Ermintrude was often seen chewing on a flower with a striking resemblance to an opiate poppy.\n\nThe five-minute storylines were ‘trippy’ to say the least.\n\nIn one iconic episode, Dougal attends a party he has no memory of, and proceeds to converse with a banana and a pear.\n\nSeventies show Captain Pugwash supposedly employed dirty puns for character names: such as Seaman Stains and Master Bates. However, this is wholly an urban myth. Creator John Ryan successfully sued for damages after a newspaper printed the names as fact.\n\nCartoon Network and Nickelodeon led the way\n\nFor the connoisseur of inappropriate moments in kids’ shows, Cartoon Network’s output in the 1990s represents a veritable golden age of content.\n\nAn episode of Cow and Chicken famously caused controversy when a bunch of butch female motorcyclists turned up and began literally munching on a carpet.\n\nOver on Nickelodeon, cult animation Ren & Stimpy was the subject of a number of bans and re-edits.\n\nChastised for being overly violent and boasting a number of references to alcoholism, it was controversial from the outset. One scene would be worthy of a place in horror franchise Saw.\n\nInnuendo reached new heights when Stimpy was locked in a closet with Ren’s cousin, Sven.\n\n“Hey this is private,” he says. Before shouting “I’m a sword swallower” from behind closed doors.\n\nTaking it too far?\n\nRocko’s Modern Life, meanwhile, was a wallaby-starring cartoon rife with moments that were eventually pulled from broadcast.\n\nIn one episode, Rocko rents a room at the No Tell Motel, an inn with suspect sounds coming from behind each door.\n\nIn another, a jobless Rocko finds work as a phone sex operator.\n\nFor the most part, ‘inappropriate’ content in kids’ TV has typically taken the form of deliberate in-jokes from the writers and creatives.\n\nHowever, as with Maya the Bee, occasionally somebody will sneak something into the background that was clearly not planned.\n\nThe offending episode has now been removed by Netflix. Creators Studio 100 have claimed the mishap “obviously results from a very bad joke from one of the 150 artists working on the production”.\n\nWith so many animators working on children’s shows at any one time, perhaps it’s surprising that these incidents don’t occur more often."
