        "text": "With simple plot lines, loud music, and the repetition that draws your kid in so completely, it doesn't take long to get burnt out on your children's favorite TV shows. But once they get going on a show, it can be hard to pull kids away from them. However, finding a similar replacement may just be the secret to saving your sanity and keeping your little ones engaged. So if shows like PAW Patrol are your kid's jam, this list could come in handy.\n\nPAW Patrol follows a group of adorable rescue dogs who live out their motto of \"no job is too big, no pup is too small,\" and work together to protect their community. The values of teamwork, bravery, innovation, and individual value that appear in the episodes are some that any parent would want their kids exposed to while watching TV. That being said, kids can fly through the seven seasons of the show in what feels like an instant."
