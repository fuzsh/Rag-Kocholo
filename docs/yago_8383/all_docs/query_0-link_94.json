        "text": "Fabrizio, Peppino and Alessio leave to Sweden in order to sell some lingerie. Once in Stockholm they meet Alberto, who allows them to use his office. They think more about the possible romance than their job. Alessio meets Ulla and he ends up at her place. The following morning, when he is leaving, he leaves her some money, but she gets really upset and she sends him away. Fabrizio pretends to be a famous violinist and tries to seduce Ingrid, a policewoman. He takes her to Alberto’s office, but he finds out that he has stolen all the lingerie to pay off his debts and come back to Italy. Because of the sudden anger, he says too much and exposes his true identity. The last one, Peppino, meets Anita and when she misses the last train he takes her home. Her parents ask him to stay for the night to thank him. Peppino, scared of being forced to marry the girl, runs away. He finds her the next day, when he decides he is going to stay in Sweden.\n\nTraduzione in inglese Francesca Sala – English translation Francesca Sala"
