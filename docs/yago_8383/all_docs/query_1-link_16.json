        "text": "According to Roger Ebert (in what he acknowledged as a potentially apocryphal tale) Catherine Deneuve after attending a screening of Marco Ferreri’s notorious darkly comic gross-out La Grande Bouffe refused to talk to her then lover and the film’s star Marcello Mastroianni for a week. Hard to believe that the day time hooker of Luis Buñuel’s Belle de Jour was so susceptible to offence, especially given that Deneuve (a) had previously starred in La Cagna (translation: “the bitch”) a film in which Ferreri has her portray Liza, a woman who both literally and figuratively takes the place of Mastroianni’s character’s dog; and (b) would subsequently star with Mastroianni and the rest of the principal La Grande bouffe cast in Ferreri’s…\n\nIn which Marcello Mastroianni trains Catherine Deneuve to replace his dog. There's quite a few movies like on Marco Ferreri filmography absurd fables about power usually filtered through desire that are more interested in rendering symbolic gestures and considerate them. I don't think La Cagna is not quite among the better examples of this, but the way it plays its dramatic well observed two-handler against the scenario symbolism. The artist needs to control his creating in front and behind the camera getting swallow by the absurdities on screen. A lot of the movie is predicted on Mastroianni's artist desire to live outside of society, much of the jokes derive from him and what his Robinson Crusoe number represent when et…\n\nServes as a quasi-sequel to Ferreri's excellent Dillinger is Dead, picking up where that film left off, with a man escaping heteronormative capitalist existence (that he unhappily thrives in) to live a solitary life enjoying the ocean. While the ending of Dillinger is Dead can be seen as sexist straight male fantasy, I don't think that's the case and I think Liza (or La cagna) proves that the escape to a boat at the end of Dillinger is Dead is not a happy ending for its main character. La cagna is about a man named Giorgio living on a deserted island with his beloved pup when a beautiful woman arrives and, after killing the dog, takes its place. In all…\n\nPurtroppo non sono riuscito a recuperare la versione integrale che, come sappiamo, con i film di Ferreri è quasi sempre l’unica veramente valida, sola custode del concetto, dello stile e dell’impianto narrativo per come erano stati pensati in origine dal visionario regista italiano. Per quanto mi riguarda, anche con venti minuti in meno questo film rappresenta comunque l’ennesimo manifesto di un uomo semplicemente incredibile.\n\nGiorgio, rinomato artista e abituale frequentatore dell’alta borghesia parigina ormai da tempo ha abbandonato famiglia, lavoro e quotidianità per trasferirsi su un’isola deserta in cui continuare a produrre la propria arte immerso nella natura, in sola compagnia del cane Melampo.\n\nI ritmi della solitaria e selvaggia vita da naufrago verranno però sensibilmente alterati dallo sbarco di Liza, bionda…"
