Freaks (Tod Browning, 1932), The Ape Woman (La donna scimmia, Marco Ferreri, 1964), Elephant Man (David Lynch, 1980) and Black Venus (Vénus noire, Abdellatif Kechiche, 2010) are reflexive movies that tell stories of abnormal bodies and of people who buy a ticket to see them. They inquire the fictional nature of “freakness” – a cultural and historical artefact, a social construction, a frame of mind and a set of practices – and draw attention to the continuity between the world of the freak shows and the scientific and medical milieus. The article finally considers the new visibility of the corporeal freak in contemporary voyeuristic television programs.\n\nAlberto Brodesco, \"Filming the Freak Show.

It is structured in three parts: the first concentrates on theoretical and methodological issues, the remaining parts focus on the analysis of two case studies, \"The Red Desert\" by Michelangelo Antonioni (1964) and \"The Seed of Man\" by Marco Ferreri (1969). Both films use pre-existing electro-acoustic compositions, respectively by Vittorio Gelmetti and Richard Teitelbaum. I outline the singularity of the relationship between experimental music and Italian auteur cinema, as a comparison to the codified modalities of the use of post-tonal music in the Hollywood narrative cinema and propose a model of analysis according to which languages and poetics of experimental music become tools for a hermeneutic insight of the filmmakers' aesthetics.\n\nTomando como base de reflexión La grande bouffe, de Ferreri (1973), el presente artículo se propone mostrar hasta qué punto el comer constituye en el mundo contemporáneo un perfecto emblema de la sociedad de consumo y de la propia... more\n\nTomando como base de reflexión La grande bouffe, de Ferreri (1973), el presente artículo se propone mostrar hasta qué punto el comer constituye en el mundo contemporáneo un perfecto emblema de la sociedad de consumo y de la propia subjetividad. Después de que se separa de su sentido y de su sensatez como necesidad de nutrición, el comer se torna obsesivo. En lugar de “comer para vivir”, nuestra voracidad e insaciabilidad (rasgos ya esenciales del ser humano) parecen abocar a un “comer hasta morir” o, como en el film de Ferreri/Azcona, a comer-para-la-muerte. Nos hemos convertido en tragones y glotones, en un delirio de exceso, como respuesta (absurda y, al mismo tiempo, lógica) a la imposibilidad de trascender la “ingestión” no sólo de alimento, sino de Todo. En este sentido, la última de las artes habría de ser el arte culinario, que deberá seducirnos para desear comer cuando ya no tengamos apetito. Por otra parte, desde el punto de vista ético, Ferreri/Azcona nos invitan a pensar,...\n\nCall for papers March 23, 2022 will mark the centenary of the birth of Ugo Tognazzi, an actor from Cremona who was the protagonist of a long season of Italian cinema.

In light of recent studies and research, as well as new awareness and approaches to film history and criticism, this occasion allows us to take stock of his acting and his wide-ranging filmography, which spans more than four decades.\n\nThe University of Pavia - Cremona Campus promotes an international conference dedicated to Ugo Tognazzi, a well-known actor of Italian comedy born in Cremona, in the centenary of his birth, on March 22 and 23, 2022.\n\nThe deadline for submitting proposals is 19 February 2022\n\nUnder which circumstances can a film be seen as originating from or belonging to a specific area?

To investigate this question, it can be useful to go back to the golden age of Franco-Italian co-productions from 1955 to 1975, which formed the template for later joint ventures. This exemplary period witnessed a common construction of cinema, not only in terms of shared imaginaries but also with regards to financial agreements and common policies. How did these co-productions come about and how did they challenge and formulate the notions of national cinema? Answering these questions is also critical for our understanding of the current debates concerning co-productions, which are a key feature of contemporary European cinema.\n\nItaly and France were the first European countries to sign a co-production agreement after WW2. This enterprise was to prove so fruitful that by 1966 Franco-Italian co-productions had reached the record level of 62% of the total Italian film production. What started out as an economic project intended to boost production, share resources and counter Hollywood’s post-war expansion, soon took on an artistic nature. It inaugurated a constant movement of technical and artistic personnel. Successful films, some of which developed into sequels (Don Camillo), led critics to comment upon the existence of strong cultural affinities between the two countries.\n\nThese interactions can help test the co-productions as a model for transnational creativity. This talk will focus in particular on one of the biggest film scandals of the 20th century: La grande abbuffata (1973) by Marco Ferreri, a Franco-Italian co-production (Mara Films, Paris; Films 66, Paris; Capitolina Produzioni Cinematografiche, Rome). The film starred actors who regularly worked across borders: Marcello Mastroianni, Philippe Noiret, Michel Piccoli and Ugo Tognazzi, and was directed by Marco Ferreri, who then worked and lived between Italy and France. However, La grande abbuffata triggered a heated debate about film nationality and the legitimacy of state funding. As such, it shows that even in the context of the most solid co-production partnership, the popular and critical perceptions of a film’s identity can be volatile and conflicting. This talk will highlight some key issues in the history of Franco-Italian co-productions through an examination of specific cases, and will aim to indicate some potential lines of enquiries.\n\nThe article blends the philosophy of food with the study of food films, suggesting an interpretation of Marco Ferreri’s La grande abbuffata (1973).

The movie is read through the lens of the conceptualisations of food advanced, respectively, by Plato, the Cynics, Epicurus and Lucretius, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Arthur Schopenhauer. Each thinker defined the symbolical and practical relevance of food in human existence while indicating a path towards balance, self-awareness, and wisdom, also in reference to sexuality, mortality, and art that are widely dealt with in Ferreri’s movie. I contend that the film’s action, dialogue and visual imagery represent a systematic transgression and subversion of such philosophical teachings. I further argue that this interpretation, while being more fine-grained, integrates rather than replacing the commonplace reading of La grande abbuffata as a social allegory.\n\n\"We define ‘electroacoustic’ a sound or set of sounds resulting from processes of electronic synthesis and/or manipulation.

At the turn of 20th century such technological processes matched with certain ‘tropes’ of western culture such as vibration, inscription and transmission that were subsequently developed in sonic\n\narts. These tropes find a privileged field of application in the domain of audiovisual media, to the extent that some scholars place them at the origin of the theoretical and technical debate concerning the birth of American talkies. It is indeed the fictional\n\ncinema that since its beginnings contributed, through the means of electroacoustic sound, to the development of those tropes towards narrative configurations such as automation and perceptual alteration and eventually to the profound characterization of genres like science fiction and horror-thriller. In an ideal itinerary leading from Rouben Mamoulian’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) to Alfred Hitchcock’s Spellbound and Fred Wilcox’s Forbidden Planet (1956), the topical connotation of\n\nelectroacoustic sound become well established in the American cinema. I argue that Italian auteur cinema of the 1960s rearticulated such topoi under new perspectives and through an approach to electroacoustic sound strongly mediated by the reception of contemporary avant-garde music. Drawing on two case studies––The Red Desert (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1964) and The Seed of Man (Marco Ferreri, 1969)––this paper analyzes how Italian auteur films used electroacoustic sound and music (in\n\nthese cases pre-existent compositions) to give expression to the alienated condition of a generation facing dramatic disillusion after the post-war ‘economic miracle’. In such contexts, electronics are used not merely to produce uncanny effects but as\n\nprocesses of musical construction that challenge artistic creativity and expression, eventually representing tools of hermeneutical interpretations of the films themselves.\"\n\nWe define &quot; electroacoustic &quot; a sound or set of sounds resulting from processes of electronic synthesis and/or manipulation.
