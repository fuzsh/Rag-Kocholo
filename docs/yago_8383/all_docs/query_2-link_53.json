        "text": "Another film from my personal Zodiac of Films. Its difficulty to watch places La Grande Bouffe (1973) high in my estimation. Regular filmgoers might have trouble with the concept: A group of men go to a villa in the French countryside where they resolve to eat themselves to death. If not that, then the actual process of eating and defecating will disgust them and commence an outrage, moral and more. The director is ,Marco Ferreri, a highly conceptual filmmaker, who has a host of films that have outraged both critics and the public.\n\nExcessive movies with food and sex at their core place La Grande Bouffe in a rarified genre. Bunuel’s Discrete Charm of the Bourgoisie (1972) and Phantom of Liberty (1974) come to mind.\n\nAs do Pasolino’s Salo (1975), Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover (1990), and Juzo Itami’s Tampopo (1985).\n\nI first watched La Grande Bouffe in 1979, at the Universale Theater, in Florence Italy – this cinema brought in all kinds of films, dubbed in Italian: Arancia mecchanica (1971) , Paglia di Cane (1971) , I professionale (1966). Ferreri’s is difficult to watch – first, second, third time around. However, by allowing time to pass between viewings, one discovers that things are not as disgusting as one remembers. Why view it again? One gets the ‘idea’ of the four men getting together for a final feast. A “blow out” according to one translaton of the film’s title.\n\nBefore giving you the gory details, we must consider the idea of this gathering as a final feast. Most likely the four men – Marcello (Mastroianni), Ugo (Tognazzi), Michel (Piccoli), Philippe (Noiret) – have decided this is it. They all express dissatisfaction with their circumstances. At no point, however, do they reveal their ultimate intention. It occurred to me, upon a recent viewing, that the presumption I and most other viewers had watching the film is that they are committing suicide. Did director Marco Ferreri intend for us to know they will all (try to) kill themselves? Death by overeating!\n\nI checked several summaries of the film and reviews:\n\nIMDb: A group of men go to a villa in the French countryside where they resolve to eat themselves to death.\n\nWikipedia: The film centers on a group of friends who plan to eat themselves to death.\n\nAmazon: [the film] follows four friends as they hole up in a Parisian villa with three prostitutes and a local schoolteacher to eat themselves to death.\n\nMOMA presentation in 2018: Ferreri’s notorious orgy of Rabelaisian appetites brings together some of Europe’s greatest actors for a defiantly scatological Last Supper.\n\nThe last hints at a finality but adds a sense of ritual and the blasphemous.\n\nFinally, while he gives up the plot, Roger Ebert wites what amounts to the most accurate depiction of the film:\n\nIt’s the story of four friends who gather for a weekend of eating and wenching that gradually reveals itself as a suicide pact.\n\nIf you have read Ebert then, obviously, it will not gradually reveal itself. But we rarely watch a film without a modicum of foreknowledge. Occasionally, you’ll see enough of the previews and advertisements for a film to be able judge it as well as a professional movie critic. Thus, the mere mention of a suicide pact will dampen interest (morbid topic). If this isn’t enough, the means by which they kill themselves will doom it to oblivion. Unless it causes a stir at a film festival, as this film did at Cannes, where it won the International Film Critics Award.\n\nFrustrating many critics, the film offers no elaboration on the reasons why the four men want to die. More damning might be the kind of comment offered by Jamie S. Rich in DVD Talk:\n\nIf one man’s trash is another man’s treasure, then so too can one man’s feast be merely a unfulfilling snack for another. Likewise, what may be a biting and shocking satire to you might turn out to induce merely a shrug from me.\n\nOr there will be a headlines like “A fabulous feast of desire and disgust” or “[the film is] all nudity and fart jokes.”\n\nThese frustrations and faintly damning judgments are the very things that draw me to the film (and to other films of my Zodiac). Resistance to find meaning. Inscrutable motivations of the characters. These and the savagely grotesque measures the men take to die. More than resistance to finding meaning. One must resist the mechanical response to turn away and dismiss it."
