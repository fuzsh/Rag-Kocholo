        "text": "1963. Italy/France. Directed by Marco Ferreri. A satirical Buñuelian grotesquerie that was cruelly censored, Ferreri’s first Italian feature involves the grim fate of a doting, middle-aged husband (Tognazzi) who struggles to get over his neurotic impotence and his fierce wife’s impatience, only to be devoured like a male praying mantis. DCP from Luce Cinecittà; courtesy Rialto. In Italian; English subtitles. 90 min."
