        "text": "There’s something wrong with every Michel Piccoli character. Despite the wide variety of films in which the French actor has appeared as a lead actor or supporting player, his key performances carry a similar note of discord that resonates long after the film is over. This is not because of a bizarre acting style or an affected look: Michel Piccoli has made a career (now in its 7th decade) of playing strange men, men that cause trouble and are always at odds with the world they inhabit.\n\nIn the U.S., Michel Piccoli is not a famous French actor in the same way that Americans know the names of Alain Delon, Jean Gabin, or Gerard Depardieu. Despite his low-key place in our understanding of French cinema, reviewing Piccoli’s 60+ years in film will take you through screenings of such major arthouse filmmakers as Jean-Luc Godard, Luis Bunuel, Marco Ferreri, Jacques Rivette, Agnes Varda, Jacques Demy, Mario Bava, Alain Resnais, Leos Carax, and Louis Malle—not to mention Alfred Hitchcock. Piccoli has co-starred opposite Catherine Deneuve and Romy Schneider numerous times, as well as Jeanne Moreau, Stéphane Audran, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle Béart, and Jane Birkin, to name a few. At age 92 he is still performing in films here and there, most notably 2011’s We Have a Pope, an international comedy about a reluctant new pope who seeks guidance from a therapist.\n\nTransitioning from theater roles into the cinema in the late 1950s and early ’60s, Piccoli didn’t reach prominence as an actor until well into his forties. His swarthy, seasoned look lent itself to typecasting as the corrupt bourgeois, a pillar-of-the-community type whose status belies his hidden desires or perversions. Luis Buñuel utilized Piccoli in roles great and small in seven films, and Jean-Luc Godard cast Piccoli as his doppelgänger in Contempt (1963), sandwiching his performance between the hammish theatrics of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance. Hitchcock’s underwhelming espionage thriller Topaz (1969) has one bright spot in Piccoli as the role of the ultimate Euro-arch-villain, sporting a velvet robe and grinning through his cigar as he sells his country out to the Russians and beds his best friend’s wife.\n\nPiccoli apologizes for talking too much in a 2008 interview with Juan-Luis Buñuel\n\nSelected Filmography (availability as of May 2018)\n\nDeath in the Garden (1956) - Available on DVD\n\nLe Doulos (1963) - Available on Criterion DVD\n\nContempt (1963) - Although the Criterion DVD is out of print, a new Bluray/DVD combo has been released by Lion’s Gate\n\nDiary of a Chambermaid (1964) - Available streaming via FilmStruck\n\nCompartiment tueurs / Sleeping Car Murders (1965) - Piccoli in a small role as a deranged murder suspect in an early Costa-Gavras thriller.

The US DVD release is out of print, try Movie Detective\n\nThe Creatures (1966) - Agnes Varda’s follow up to Cleo from 5 to 7 is this obscure magical-realist fairy tale of sorts starring Piccoli and Catherine Deneuve.

Try Movie Detective\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) - Piccoli dances but does not sing in Demy’s Technicolor musical, alongside Deneuve, Françoise Dorléac, and Gene Kelly (!). Available from Criterion and FilmStruck\n\nBelle de Jour (1967) - Available from Criterion and FilmStruck\n\nDanger: Diabolik (1968) - Out of print on DVD\n\nLa Chamade / Heartbeat (1968) - Dated romance drama with Piccoli and Deneuve is available on DVD\n\nDillinger is Dead (1969) - Available from Criterion and FilmStruck\n\nTopaz (1969) - Available on DVD and streaming via Starz for free\n\nLe Choses de la Vie / The Things of Life (1970) - Intriguing drama with Piccoli and Romy Schneider. Elusive but occasionally available via FilmStruck and as a Region 2 PAL import DVD\n\nMax and the Junkmen (1971) - Another Piccoli and Schneider pairing available streaming via FilmStruck\n\nTen Days Wonder (1971) - Claude Chabrol production co-starring Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles. Available on DVD dubbed in English. I haven’t seen this version so I don’t know if Piccoli’s voice is dubbed or if it’s his voice.\n\nThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) - Piccoli turns up where you most expect him in Buñuel’s surreal classic, available from Criterion and FilmStruck.\n\nThe Woman in Blue (1973) - Piccoli stars as a TV personality unable to commit to being happy if it means sacrificing hope of the unexpected. Co-starring Lea Massari, in print and available on DVD.\n\nWedding in Blood (1973) - Piccoli and Stéphane Audran co-star in this Chabrol thriller. Never in print in the US, Region 2 PAL DVD available with English subtitles.\n\nLa Grande Bouffe (1973) - A new Bluray/DVD combo has been released by Arrow.\n\nLife Size (1974) - Completely unavailable but worth mentioning because all press photos for this film include Piccoli interacting with an inflatable woman. Let me know if you find this one!\n\nLe Trio Infernal (1974) - A truly gruesome thriller with Piccoli and Schneider that’s not for the faint of heart. Bizarre Sergio Leone score should make this film more appealing but watch at your own risk. Try Movie Detective\n\nThe Phantom of Liberty (1974) - Piccoli rounds out the all-star cast of Buñuel’s surreal fever dream, available from Criterion and FilmStruck\n\nVincent, François, Paul, and Others (1974) - Piccoli costars with Yves Montand and Gerard Depardieu in this drama about a group of middle-age friends and their daily lives and dramas.

Don’t rush to watch but if you’re intrigued try Movie Detective.\n\nGodard’s Passion (1982) - Piccoli is one of four main orbits in Godard’s experimental feature. Also starring a young Isabelle Huppert. Out of print on DVD\n\nUne Chambre En Ville (1982) - Piccoli sings but does not dance in Jacques Demy’s all-singing film supporting starring actors Dominique Sanda and Danielle Darrieux. Available from Criterion and FilmStruck\n\nMauvais Sang (1986) - Hard but not impossible to find French sci-fi thriller starring Juliette Binoche with Piccoli as the villain.\n\nMay Fools (1990) - Available streaming via FilmStruck\n\nLa Belle Noiseuse (1991) - Out of print but worth the effort to track down. An unforgettable film from Jacques Rivette starring Piccoli alongside Jane Birkin and Emmanuelle Béart. Piccoli is a retired painter who is drawn back into the studio to resume work on an unfinished portrait once he meets Béart. The intense relationship that develops between artist and model may drive them both to madness; as well as the audience if you’re unprepared for a 3+ hour film that is primarily watching Piccoli paint. But if you like Rivette and meditative films in general it’s worth locating the New Yorker VHS edition online.\n\nTraveling Companion (1996) - Asia Argento is hired to follow an aging Piccoli who may or may not be losing his mind. Out of print on DVD\n\nGenealogies of a Crime (1997) - Overwrought crime thriller directed by Raoul Ruiz where Piccoli is once again teamed with Deneuve. Out of print on DVD\n\nI’m Going Home (2001) - Retired actor played by Piccoli is entrusted with the care of his grandson after a family tragedy. Available on DVD\n\nWe Have a Pope (2011) - Available on DVD and streaming via Hulu for free"
