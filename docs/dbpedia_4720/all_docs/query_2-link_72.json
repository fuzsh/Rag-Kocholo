        "text": "This article was first published in Northern Life in June/July 2008. Further research work resulted in a case study of this remarkable story of the Cottingley Fairies in 2011. Just before the end of the First World War, in the summer of 1917, two young girls claimed to have taken photographs of real-life fairies at the bottom of their long garden behind their house at Cottingley Beck. But when we look at the photographs today we can see that the fairies are only drawings carefully cut out. Hardly anyone can look at these photographs now and accept them as anything but fakes. However, they fooled Sir Arthur Doyle, and their prank had far more reaching consequences than they could have ever imagined. This comprehensive article records in detail the history and events.\n\nPrepublication copy of chapter in Shai Feraro and Ethan Doyle White, eds., Magic and Witchery in the Modern West (Palgrave MacMillan, 2019). Traces the development of contemporary representations of fairies as helpers and protectors of the environment through literature and film in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and explores how fairy narratives among contemporary Pagans reflect these themes. I argue that environmental narratives about fairies among contemporary Pagans reflect literary and popular culture rather than oral tradition.\n\nIntroduce the medieval phenomenon of what “Fairy” is/was; shared phenomenon shaped ideas and practices of medieval peoples. Show of the literature that was studied, reviewed, and manipulated to support the thesis subject. Explain methodological approach of the research design. Discuss the points of the thesis; being origins, the phenomenon, and realms. Explain what limitation were encountered in construing a research design with its basis in speculative and scholarly works concerning the period. A conclusion based on findings in known or collected literature, material discovery, methodological approach, and personal normative opinion based on educated and passionate research for a subject that is very close to the treatise author.\n\nThis chapter examines the influence of literary and folkloric notions of fairies, elves, and related spiritual beings on the folklore of modern Pagan religions. It presents the argument that although modern Pagan conceptions of these beings are deeply rooted in both literature and folklore, the fairies have undergone a significant shift in perception in modern Paganisms, becoming friendlier, less dangerous, and altogether tamer. While this is in part due to their transformation in Victorian children’s literature and twentieth-century animated films, it is also a consequence of the unique Pagan ethos that identifies with alien others. The transformation of the fae from dangerous spirits to companions, protectors, and allies allows many Pagans to cultivate relationships with them through a variety of practices, some traditional, others innovative. Nonetheless, it argues, the phenomenological nature of fairy experiences keeps the fae from becoming too tame: they remain in a liminal cat..."
