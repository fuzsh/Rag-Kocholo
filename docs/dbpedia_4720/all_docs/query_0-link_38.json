Instead, he plays a falconer who wants to confront his cult-running mother for abandoning him as a child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Downey Jr. — \"Johnny Be Good\" (1988)\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 0%\n\nDowney's career has truly been filled with ups and downs, both personal and professional. While his personal struggles have been well-documented in the press, you might not know about this professional low, in which he plays Leo, the best friend of a star high school quarterback.\n\nNearly four decades later, Downey earned a best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss, a foil to J. Robert Oppenheimer, in \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph — \"A Little White Lie\" (2023)\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 34%\n\nThe same year she scored an Academy Award for her heartwarming portrayal as Mary, a cook at a prestigious New England boarding school in \"The Holdovers,\" she appeared in the film \"A Little White Lie,\" co-starring Michael Shannon and Kate Hudson as a handyman masquerading as an author and an English professor, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Stone — \"Movie 43\" (2013)\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 4%\n\nStone won an Oscar for her role as Mia in \"La La Land\" in 2017, and seven years later, she picked up her second statue for playing Bella Baxter in \"Poor Things.\"\n\nIn \"Movie 43,\" Stone plays Veronica, who accidentally has her conversation with her ex-boyfriend (Kieran Culkin, also her real-life ex-boyfriend) broadcast to an entire grocery store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamie Lee Curtis — \"Christmas With the Kranks\" (2004)\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 5%\n\nIn \"Christmas with the Kranks,\" Curtis plays half of a married couple alongside Tim Allen, who are new empty-nesters.

His worst-reviewed film is a personal one for him — it's 2013's \"After Earth,\" in which he co-starred with his son Jaden Smith. They played father-and-son duo, Cypher and Kitai Rage, who must work together to survive on a post-apocalyptic Earth.\n\nAlmost 10 years later, he won an Oscar for portraying Richard Williams, the father of tennis GOATs Serena and Venus, in \"King Richard.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJessica Chastain — \"Stolen\" (2007)\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 0%\n\nChastain finally won an Oscar 10 years after her first nomination for \"The Help\" in 2012. She took home the best actress prize for \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye,\" in which she totally transformed to play evangelical Christian celebrity Tammy Faye Bakker.\n\nBack in 2009, though, Chastain appeared in a career-low, the film \"Stolen\" alongside Jon Hamm and Josh Lucas. The film tells the story of two fathers connected by the kidnappings of their sons 50 years apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Rockwell — \"Gentlemen Broncos\" (2009)\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 20%\n\nRockwell's been nominated for two Oscars, winning one for his performance in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" in 2018.
