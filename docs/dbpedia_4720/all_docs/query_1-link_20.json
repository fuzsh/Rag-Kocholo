        "text": "New. Southern. Film.\n\nBuilding on more than a decade of success, Carrboro’s film festival begins a new chapter in 2019. In recent years, the South has produced numerous independent films that challenge and expand our understanding of Southern culture. In an effort to support what we see as a renaissance in Southern cinema, Carrboro Film Fest embraces its identity as a Southern institution and will present exclusively Southern films in a non-competitive setting. Come celebrate Southern cinema with us.\n\nTickets are $10 per film block, $20 for Saturday, $20 for Sunday, and $40 for a weekend pass.\n\nHome in E Major + “Hebo”: Free Documentary Screening\n\nSaturday, Nov. 16, 10:00, West End Theater\n\nIn this personal and intimate documentary, four strangers from profoundly different backgrounds find themselves living under the same roof in Durham, North Carolina: Elisabeth, the 93 year-old landlord and retired linguist from Austria; Li, a 27 year-old engineering scholar from China; Stuart, a 75 year-old retired American lawyer; and Tamar, the 33 year-old filmmaker from Jerusalem. With time and often dramatic upheavals in the house, the four come to support and care for one another in unexpected ways. Home in E Major explores the meaning of “home” while celebrating the shared humanity between unlikely friends.\n\n“Hebo” is a documentary short that chronicles the unconventional journey of outsider folk artist Sam Ezell in Hillsborough, North Carolina.\n\nOpening this block is a special screening of “The Ebbing Stream,” a film by Hunter Stark.\n\nSouthern Communities: Documentary Shorts\n\nSaturday, Nov. 16, 12 PM, Wynn Theater\n\nSouthern Communities is a collection of documentary shorts illuminating the diversity of Southern cultures.
