So I started in my sandbox developing an article, Walt Disney animated studios including a general history of other Disney animated studios plus sections for the minor ones that don't make sense to have an article for. I would like comments where this article should go forward. Also whether or not DisneyToon Studios and Circle 7 Animation, should be incorporated into the article or stay as stand alone articles.

Should Dimadick wish to work with us, we would discuss the situation here.Forbidden User (talk)\n\nIn an article with such a large Legacy section, I would think the biographic information were lacking. That is why I used a cited biography. Your reversions simply strip the article of a decent bio of the man. Dimadick (talk)\n\nHis teenage years is not the most imortant parts in his life. So as childhood. That's why the original author (who has two detailed books) did not include so much trivial details. (Look at his edits here(clearer version), there were a lot of ciation errors on ref names, multiple citations with the same content, etc, and I'm sure he didn't use preview)) Also, why didn't you post in the talk page to discuss about expansions in the two sections? I wonder that if such \"expansions\" are needed, why didn't anyone mention it in the FAC discussion and peer review? Moreover, his legacy is super-abundant. That means it has a large due weight in the article. I'm looking at your edits again to see if some of them can be added back to the article (and I'll make sure there's no citation errors). I should state that I appreciate such efforts on Wikipedia, but perhaps you should put it on unsourced paragraphs, etc. I hope you can cool down and if you wish, discuss my proposal of a new section about his relationship with colleagues (which consists of the biographical content you wish to have more in the article) ! Have a nice day. Forbidden User (talk)\n\nI should add that the reviewer mentioned addition of information about relationships between Disney and Iwerks, etc, in the peer review.

Any kind of project can have a physical paper leaflet designed - for free - as a tool to help recruit new contributors. These leaflets will be printed at Wikimania 2014, and the designs can be re-used in the future at other events and locations.\n\nThis is particularly aimed at highlighting less discoverable but successful projects, e.g:\n\n• Active Wikiprojects: Wikiproject Medicine, WikiProject Video Games, Wikiproject Film\n\n• Tech projects/Tools, which may be looking for either users or developers.\n\n• Less known major projects: Wikinews, Wikidata, Wikivoyage, etc.\n\n• Wiki Loves Parliaments, Wiki Loves Monuments, Wiki Loves ____\n\n• Wikimedia thematic organisations, Wikiwomen’s Collaborative, The Signpost\n\nThe deadline for submissions is 1st July 2014\n\nFor more information or to sign up for one for your project, go to:\n\nProject leaflets\n\nAdikhajuria (talk)\n\nHi WikiProject, I've seen a lot of questionable edits to Disney-related articles from various disruptive Vietnam-based IPs. Do any of you know of a planned 2015 Beauty and the Beast project? For example, here I notice that Beauty and the Beast (TV series) was a redirect for a couple of years until some IPs came along and co-opted it. Now it appears to be an unsourced article about a proposed 2015 BATB project, and methinks it's a poorly-written hoax. Thoughts? Thanks, Cyphoidbomb (talk)\n\nI've slammed a {{noref}} for warning. This sounds like corporate editing, which should be looked into.Forbidden User (talk)\n\nWent one better: restored the original redirect. Even if this is in the pipeline, we would need to generate it as Beauty and the Beast (2015 series) or something like that, so it wouldn't be here to begin with. --McDoobAU93\n\n(edit conflict) Thanks for the assist, Forbidden. I dunno about corporate, but it's deliberately disruptive. They keep changing Mrs. Potts name to Mrs. Potts Tea (sometimes Mr. Potts Tea), Lumiere becomes \"Light's\" (with apostrophe-s). Obviously none of it is sourced, and it is obvious that an unreleased series shouldn't already have a fully fleshed out infobox yet. Anyhow, they're also screwing with the B&TB template (see history). Currently my plan was to stall them out. I've requested 30 day page protection for the article and for the template, and I planned to go back after those were solidified to revert the nonsense. McDoobAU93 appears to be helping out as well. Thanks all! Cyphoidbomb (talk)\n\nThese two issues have blended into one for me. The Emperor's New Groove (franchise) is the third such article I have created, after B&B and Aladdin. I want to create more for films such as Tarzan and Hunchback, but I have issues with their current templates. Instead of having their own, they are wedged into the template of the property the film is based on. So I ask for help to fix up these templates, which will make my job a lot easier. I can't work out how to fix this problem. See the following templates for examples of this:--Coin945 (talk)\n\nI have nominated Jack Sparrow for a featured article review here. Please join the discussion on whether this article meets featured article criteria. Articles are typically reviewed for two weeks.

The instructions for the review process are here.Forbidden User (talk)\n\nPlease weigh in at this AFD.--Coin945 (talk)\n\nHello there! As you may already know, most WikiProjects here on Wikipedia struggle to stay active after they've been founded. I believe there is a lot of potential for WikiProjects to facilitate collaboration across subject areas, so I have submitted a grant proposal with the Wikimedia Foundation for the \"WikiProject X\" project. WikiProject X will study what makes WikiProjects succeed in retaining editors and then design a prototype WikiProject system that will recruit contributors to WikiProjects and help them run effectively. Please review the proposal here and leave feedback. If you have any questions, you can ask on the proposal page or leave a message on my talk page. Thank you for your time!

In our first phase, we are focusing on research. At this time, we are looking for people to share their experiences with WikiProjects: good, bad, or neutral. We are also looking for WikiProjects that may be interested in trying out new tools and layouts that will make participating easier and projects easier to maintain. If you or your WikiProject are interested, check us out! Note that this is an opt-in program; no WikiProject will be required to change anything against its wishes. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Otherwise, this will be the last notification sent about WikiProject X.\n\nHarej (talk)\n\nI feel like one of us who has a lot of knowledge on Disney's Festival of Fantasy parade should craete a page for it because there isn't one for it yet, and it has almost been a year since it's first appearance.--NAD328 (talk)\n\nDo we have articles for the other parades? I know we have one for the Main Street Electrical Parade but I'm not sure about many others or even how much could be written about a single parade. What if we did individual articles for long-running parades and then did an article for Walt Disney World parades and Disneyland parades (and maybe parades for other Disney parks, but I'm less familiar with them)? That way we can still document all of the different parades in the different parks and also have separate, more fleshed out articles for the major parades. Kaciemonster (talk)\n\nI wanted to ask the members of WikiProject Disney if they thought that some WDW restaurants are notable, like, say, Victoria & Albert's?

I'll try to collect a few sources and see if there's anything I can add to your draft. Kaciemonster (talk)\n\nHello again WikiProject, I need some help from knowledgeable Disney folk to deal with rampant vandalism being caused by an IP-hopping vandal/vandals based in Vietnam. (Typical ranges: 222.*, 123.*, 117.*, 113.*) A lot of the vandalism is subtle and requires some knowledge of the various projects that Disney has produced. I'm not so slick on all of that, and I find myself having to double and triple check stuff. I first brought this problem to your attention above, when the vandal kept adding hoax content about a 2015 Beauty and the Beast animated series. We managed to protect a few articles, but the vandals keep messing with more Disney articles, typically more obscure ones. If you're interested in seeing the scope of the problem, please click here, which details all mentions of \"Vietnam\" in my edit summaries, and which will give you an idea of what sorts of articles/templates are being affected.\n\nMO:\n\nIntroduction of hoax content like the 2015 Beauty and the Beast animated series detailed a few sections above or of Tarzan III: Tale of Two Jungles.\n\nIntroduction of gibberish for example in these four edits or in these 18 edits\n\nAdjusts templates to perpetuate hoaxes, like here where imaginary project \"Tarzan III: Tale of Two Jungles\" gets pointed to a now deleted section at Tarzan II. Cyphoidbomb (talk)\n\nI'm at the point where I feel like reverting anything from a Vietnam IP per WP:RBI, but I think it would be better to get other editors to rifle through the various edits made by these IPs just in case anything is worth keeping. Anyhow, thanks for helping. Cyphoidbomb (talk)\n\n@Cyphoidbomb: Those are really big ranges. Do you have a list of all the IPs you think are being used? If so I can try to place a few narrow rangeblocks for a short period of time. But I can't block like a /4. :) Protonk (talk)\n\nNone of those IPs appear to still be live. The most recent one (near as I can tell) is 113.190.159.202 and they haven't edited today. So I probably won't block anyone just yet. Let me know if it starts up again or if you find any other IPs. Protonk (talk)\n\nHi @Protonk:, they seem to edit daily. I basically keep adding these obscure articles to my watchlist and reverting as much as I can after running a Geolocate on a questionable IP. I feel like I was told once before that it would be futile to try to block the IPs, which is why I typically go for page protection. Although (as you can tell from my edit summary search) we're talking about having to block a shit-ton of pages to prevent the disruptions. So it's a lose-lose. If you need a list of IPs, I can probably pull them from my edit summary history later today. Cyphoidbomb (talk)\n\nThat would be really helpful. I can rangeblock some (I think a few ranges in 113.190.xxx.xxx might work) and try to see if specific pages can be semi-protected for a few weeks, though as you note that's tough to do without semi-protecting half the (wiki)project. Protonk (talk)\n\nAs an aside I'm probably no help on watching the individual articles. Some of the lesser known Disney things (e.g. Playhouse Disney) are so weird that I can't tell nonsense additions from stuff that is real/valid and just doesn't have a source. Protonk (talk)\n\nHey @Cyphoidbomb: I noticed an IP from Vietnam made a bunch of edits to the List of Disney television series page today. I can't tell if the changes they made are actually wrong or not (there's a lot of them but they're fairly subtle) but I thought it might be worth mentioning. They also made a bunch of edits on a handful of other pages -- 123.16.134.156. Kaciemonster (talk)\n\nHi Protonk, I dropped the ball on this for a while--the idea of going through that entire edit summary search and copy/pasting IPs was daunting. Fortunately, I found a web utility that allowed me to extract them in a few seconds using regular expressions (RegEx). Thankfully, I also found an appropriate IP scraping regex string on the web. because I'm not smart enough to come up with one on my own. Anyhow, here are the various IPs that have polluted the various low profile Disney articles:\n\nSo far it's about 30. Interested to see if there's anything you can do about this, as the disruptions do continue. I had to ask for Template:Beauty and the Beast to be indefinitely protected because of this nonsense. Thanks! Cyphoidbomb (talk)\n\nThanks, Cyphoidbomb. I'll take a look at these and see if I can suggest/implement some range blocks. Protonk (talk)\n\nThanks. Cyphoidbomb (talk)\n\nAddendum - I know this is an old thread, but the disruptive user continues to edit (although I believe they have been significantly slowed). I have a long list of IPs used and some behavioral notes here in case anyone is interested.

None of them are sourced, and a lot of them seem to just be dates being changed to other plausible-looking values.

ApLundell (talk)\n\nIs it possible that every article on kids' media this user looks at happens to have incorrect dates and they happen to know the correct dates? Yes, it is theoretically possible. It is, however, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much more likely that they are simply vandalizing articles, as described at WP:KIDSTVDATES. I have warned them and will be reverting the tiny portion of their edits that have not already been reverted. Why none of the other editors reverting them bothered to warn them is beyond me. - SummerPhDv2.0\n\nI have noticed that my role as a Wikipedian has become that of a custodian, cleaning up after the vandalism of what is apparently a single anonymous user obsessed with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, who makes numerous subtle edits all over the Disney WikiProject nearly every day. My daily routine begins by looking at my watchlist to see what was vandalized overnight, undo the vandalism, review (and nearly always undo) all the other changes by the same anonymous IP address, and add all the newly vandalized pages to my tripwire list. Virtually every edit I've made over the past couple of. On this has been undoing the work of this single vandal, and nearly all the recent changes on the pages I edit are an endless string of vandalism and undos.\n\nIs there anything we can do to stop, slow down, or at least discourage this vandal?\n\nFor those of you undoing anonymous vandalism in WikiProject Disney, I urge you to also review all the contributions of the vandal, as the M.O. of this particular vandal is to vandalize multiple Disney-related pages in a single session. Often a Wikipedian will undo one or two of the vandals edits, but will leave some of the other edits in place. If all of us remain vigilant and clean up all of the messes as soon as they happen, perhaps we can persuade this vandal to move on.\n\n06:35, 26 July 2016 (UTC) — Preceding unsigned comment added by Scott Roy Atwood (talk • contribs)\n\nI realize that this is rather \"inside baseball\", but here goes... As of now, just the following two Disney Channel TV series are rated as high importance to the WP:DISNEY project:\n\nHannah Montana\n\nLizzie McGuire (?!! only ran 2 seasons + the film – is it \"high\" importance?...)\n\nI'd argue that this list is incomplete. Some possible suggestions for additions to the \"high importance\" list for WP:DISNEY would be:\n\nThat's So Raven\n\nThe Suite Life of Zack & Cody (I'd list just this one, as The Suite Life on Deck was its sequel)\n\nWizards of Waverly Place\n\nJessie\n\nAustin & Ally\n\n(A good benchmark for this might be Disney Channel series that ran 4 or more seasons...) The only currently running series that might qualify are Liv and Maddie (about to run 4 seasons...) and Girl Meets World, but maybe we should wait until a show is over before assessing it as \"high\" importance to WP:DISNEY?... Pinging the only people I can think of who might be interested in this discussion: @Geraldo Perez, Amaury, Nyuszika7H, and MPFitz1968: --IJBall (contribs • talk)\n\nGiven Wikipedia:WikiProject Disney/Assessment § Importance scale and the examples there, I can't see any of the TV series as obviously being more than mid-importance to the project. I don't think we can just say more than 3 seasons makes it a significant topic although that could go into an evaluation decision. I don't think there is a simple rule we can derive, it remains a judgement call likely backed up with how significant the coverage of a series is in reliable sources. Geraldo Perez (talk)\n\nFirst, note: I actually added most of those examples to the Importance scale, so I wouldn't necessary consider them \"definitive\"!...\n\nBut I think there are other ways to assess \"importance\" of the TV shows. For example – Did it spawn followup \"theatrical films\"? (Yes: Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire.) Did it spawn separate \"TV movies\"? (Yes: Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life.) Did it spawn a \"spinoff\" or \"sequel\" TV series? (Yes: Suite Life (again!), Jessie.)\n\nAddendum: And one other factor: how important were the show's star(s) to Disney Corporate? – In the case of Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez and the Sprouse twins, at the time, I think we can say they were of pretty high importance to Disney... Of the current stars, I'd say Ross Lynch and Dove Cameron, and maybe Sabrina Carpenter, are (or recently were) of similar importance to Disney Corp...\n\nWhen all of those are figured in, I think strong arguments can be made for rating at least Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire, Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life and Jessie as \"high\" importance. The other 2–4 suggestions are probably more borderline. --IJBall (contribs • talk)\n\nBeing the root of a franchise is likely a solid call for high-importance. It impacts more of Disney than just Disney Channel if there are significant other Disney projects spun off from a TV series. Likewise important enough to have a spin-off shows importance to Disney. I think for actors would need to show involvement in multiple Disney projects or lead in a high-importance Disney Channel show. Series actors that show up in multiple Disney series, movies, significant albums show that Disney values them. I think a valuation is a weighing of all that. A good argument show be available if challenged that it is more than just run-of-the-mill TV series or actors that Disney doesn't use much. I think for most articles where a serious consideration has been made by an evaluator this will be fairly non-contentious. Hannah Montana fits most of the requirement as an exemplar, I think. Of the ones you list the only one I'm iffy about is Jessie. Geraldo Perez (talk)\n\nI agree that Jessie is borderline, but I'm basing the argument for \"high\" importance on, 1) it ran 4 seasons, 2) it lead to Bunk'd, and 3) Debby Ryan was of pretty big importance to Disney, spawning one DCOM (Radio Rebel) and a half (16 Wishes was apparently not an official \"DCOM\", but Disney Channel has rerun the film like it was one!). But, like you, I think Jessie (and also That's So Raven) is right on the knife's edge between \"mid\" and \"high\" importance to WP:DISNEY, so I am a little conflicted... Hopefully others will offer their opinions to help us out here. --IJBall (contribs • talk)\n\nDebby Ryan also starred on The Suite Life on Deck as a main character. One thing I noticed from many of the Disney Channel shows is that the lead starring cast stem from them starring, though not in the lead, but still a main character, or guest starring on other shows. Examples I can think of include Good Luck Charlie which stars Bridgit Mendler who previously guest starred on Wizards of Waverly Place, Mighty Med which stars Bradley Steven Perry and Jake Short who previously starred on Good Luck Charlie and A.N.T. Farm, respectively, and, of course, Lab Rats: Elite Force which we already know who it stars and where they stem from. Amaury (talk | contribs)\n\nYeah, I pretty much agree with most things said above. I'm not entirely sure about Jessie either. This makes me wonder about Violetta though, which reached pretty much international popularity (not so much in the U.S. – it only aired on a Spanish TV channel, Azteca [in Spanish, obviously] and only the first season – later the first two seasons were released in English [both subtitled and dubbed] and Spanish on Netflix on July 10, 2015 and the third season on December 31, 2015). It's currently rated \"Low-importance\", which is definitely wrong, it should be at least \"Mid\" but I'd argue it might be even \"High\". nyuszika7h (talk)\n\nDone – I've reassessed Violetta as \"mid\" importance to WP:DISNEY. While I generally think non-U.S. Disney Channel shows should be assessed as \"low\" importance to WP:DISNEY, there will be some exceptions, and Violetta seems to get enough interest/\"heat\" even at En Wiki to justify making an exception and rating it as \"mid\" importance. (I also reassessed Violetta as 'C-class' – while a couple of sections (e.g. the Production section) are inadequately sourced, overall the article is more than long enough and well-sourced enough to be well past 'Start'-class.) --IJBall (contribs • talk)\n\nBack to the matter at hand: I think I will reassess the articles that have been generally agreed upon as \"high\" importance later today. I think I am going to include Jessie (but not That's So Raven or Austin & Ally), for the reasons I outlined above – but I also won't object if another editor kicks it back down to \"mid\" importance afterwards...

In place of static copied and pasted excerpts will be self-updating excerpts displayed through selective transclusion, using the template {{Transclude lead excerpt}}.\n\nThe discussion about this can be found here.\n\nMaintainers of specific portals are encouraged to sign up as project members here, noting the portals they maintain, so that those portals are skipped by the maintenance pass.

On April 17th, the Portals WikiProject was rebooted to handle the revitalization of the portal system. On May 12th, the RfC was closed with the result to keep portals, by a margin of about 2 to 1 in favor of keeping portals.\n\nThere's an article in the current edition of the Signpost interviewing project members about the RfC and the Portals WikiProject.\n\nSince the reboot, the Portals WikiProject has been busy building tools and components to upgrade portals.\n\nSo far, 84 editors have joined.\n\nIf you would like to keep abreast of what is happening with portals, see the newsletter archive.\n\nIf you have any questions about what is happening with portals or the Portals WikiProject, please post them on the WikiProject's talk page.\n\nThank you. — The Transhumanist\n\nHi there.
