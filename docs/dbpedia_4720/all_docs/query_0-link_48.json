        "text": "#100. The Theory of Everything\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.7\n\nYear: 2014\n\nDirector: James Marsh\n\n“The Theory of Everything,” tells the story of physicist Stephen Hawking—who had Lou Gehrig’s disease, a degenerative neuromuscular condition—from the point of view of his wife, Jane. The film is based on her memoir and mostly sticks to the facts. One deviation from real life: Stephen and Jane didn’t meet until after he was already diagnosed.\n\n#99. Zodiac\n\nYear: 2007\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nRobert Downey Jr. and Jake Gyllenhaal star in this historical thriller about the Zodiac serial killer. The film shows how the killer detailed his murders in letters to newspapers and police but was never caught. Critics applauded the film’s attention to historic detail.\n\n#98. Adaptation.\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.7\n\nYear: 2002\n\nDirector: Spike Jonze\n\nDirector Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman teamed up after the success of “Being John Malkovich” to create “Adaptation,” a film based on Kaufman’s experience with writer’s block as he tried to write a screenplay adapted from Susan Orlean’s non-fiction book “The Orchid Thief.” The movie added some elements of fiction, including the creation of a twin brother for Kaufman. The film also portrayed a romance between Orleans and John Laroche—the subject of “The Orchid Thief”—that never happened.\n\n#97. The Blind Side\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.7\n\nYear: 2009\n\nDirector: John Lee Hancock\n\nThe film is based on the true story of NFL star Michael Oher, a homeless black teenager taken in by a well-off white family in Tennessee before professionally succeeding in football. This box office hit was praised by the Academy—Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for Best Actress—but some critics didn’t like how the film portrayed race. Oher said the film had a negative impact on his career.\n\n#96. 50/50\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.7\n\nYear: 2011\n\nDirector: Jonathan Levine\n\nWill Reiser wrote the screenplay for \"50/50\" based on his own experience after he was diagnosed with cancer at 25. Reiser said he survived the disease with the help of real-life friends like Seth Rogen, who also co-produced and starred in the movie opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who played the Reiser character.\n\nYou may also like: Movies and TV shows casting across the US\n\n#95. Argo\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.7\n\nYear: 2012\n\nDirector: Ben Affleck\n\nIn “Argo,” the CIA creates a fake movie production company to extract six Americans during the Iran revolution in 1979. While this part of the story is true—and is based on a Wired article by Joshuah Bearman and a memoir by former CIA operative Antonio Mendez—the film downplays Canada’s involvement in the rescue. Alan Arkin’s character was fictional, and the escape from Iran—which involved a myriad of complications at the airport in the film—was not as dramatic as depicted.\n\n#94. The Social Network\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.7\n\nYear: 2010\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nDirector David Fincher paired up with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (“The West Wing”), who adapted the film from “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal,” written by Ben Mezrich. The film takes a deeper look behind the turmoil surrounding the creation of Facebook. It focuses on founder Mark Zuckerberg, who some say is not as angry in real life as he seems in the film. What the film did get right: the Winklevoss brothers did work with and sue Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin was Zuckerberg’s closest friend, and Sean Parker did play a critical advisement role.\n\n#93. 300\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.7\n\nYear: 2006\n\nDirector: Zack Snyder\n\nWhile there is no way to know if real-life Spartans all had six-packs, the film portrays the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. when King Leonidas of Sparta (Gerard Butler) and 300 of his warriors—along with at least 1,100 Boeotians—fought against the entire Persian army. Snyder claims it is historically accurate, but some critics disagree.\n\n#92. Zulu\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1964\n\nDirector: Cy Endfield\n\n“Zulu” tells the story of the Battle of Rorke’s Drift in 1879 between 150 British soldiers who fought against 3,000 to 4,000 (the exact number varies) Zulu fighters in South Africa. The film is a re-creation of a true event, but some feel it exaggerates the importance of an unnecessary battle.\n\n#91. Loving Vincent\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2017\n\nDirectors: Dorota Kobiela, Hugh Welchman\n\n\"Loving Vincent\" depicts the life and death of Vincent van Gogh by transforming van Gogh's works into a painted animation brought to life with added (famous) voices. The plot begins one year after Vincent van Gogh's suicide, as a postman delivers the artist's last letter to his brother, Theo.\n\nYou may also like: Best comedy movies of all time\n\n#90. BlacKkKlansman\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nDirector Spike Lee shows how Ron Stallworth, the first black police officer in Colorado Springs, Colorado, infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan during an undercover investigation in the late 1970s. Stallworth (John David Washington) sends his white colleague (Adam Driver) to pose as him during in-person meetings while Stallworth himself fools KKK director David Duke (Topher Grace) on the phone. While most of the film is accurate, Stallworth said no bombings took place during his investigation. His love interest in the movie also didn’t exist in real life.\n\n#89. Pride\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2014\n\nDirectors: Matthew Warchus\n\nIn 1984, a group of British LGBT activists worked together to raise money for striking miners and their families during a gay pride march in London. The activists identified with the miners against what they felt were repressive, abusive tactics by Margaret Thatcher.\n\n#88. The Longest Day\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1962\n\nDirectors: Ken Annakin, Darryl F. Zanuck, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, Gerd Oswald\n\nThis epic war film depicts the events of the D-Day landing during World War II on June 6, 1944 in Normandy. The black-and-white movie features an ensemble cast including John Wayne, Richard Burton, and Henry Fonda. Some events are fictionalized, but the crux of the story is true.\n\n#87. The World's Fastest Indian\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2005\n\nDirector: Roger Donaldson\n\nThis film tells the story of Burt Munro, an aging New Zealander who rebuilt a 1920 Indian Twin Scout motorcycle that helped him set a world record for land speed at Utah’s Bonneville Salt Flats in 1967. The real Munro had children, though they were not mentioned in the film.\n\n#86. The Wind Rises\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2013\n\nDirector: Hayao Miyazaki\n\n\"The Wind Rises\" is a controversial animated biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane, which Japan used during Pearl Harbor in World War II. The film shows Horikoshi's skill and dedication as an engineer.\n\nYou may also like: Best Thanksgiving movies of all time\n\n#85. October Sky\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1999\n\nDirector: Joe Johnston\n\nJake Gyllenhaal stars as Homer H. Hickam Jr. in this drama based on the lives of four men in Coalwood, West Virginia, who experimented with creating their own rockets. In real life, Hickam became a NASA engineer and wrote “Rocket Boys.”\n\n#84. The Last Emperor\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1987\n\nDirector: Bernardo Bertolucci\n\nThe life of Puyi, the last emperor of China, is depicted in this biographical drama. In 1908, 3-year-old Puyi, became the Lord of Ten Thousand Years. The film follows the emperor though his life, including his childhood and imprisonment by Russia after World War II.\n\n#83. The Motorcycle Diaries\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2004\n\nDirector: Walter Salles\n\nBased on the memoir of a 23-year-old Ernesto Guevara, “The Motorcycle Diaries” shows Guevara's life in the years before he became known as Che, the internationally famous Marxist leader. The story follows a young Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado as they travel across South America.\n\n#82. Serpico\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1973\n\nDirector: Sidney Lumet\n\nAl Pacino portrays Frank Serpico, an officer with the New York Police Department. Serpico uncovers and exposes police corruption in the 1960s and 1970s. Like in the movie, his real-life efforts led to the creation of the Knapp Commission, which investigated the NYPD.\n\n#81. The French Connection\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1971\n\nDirector: William Friedkin\n\nThis fictionalized crime thriller is based on a work of nonfiction with the same name that tells the story of two NYPD detectives. The real life partners—Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso—were portrayed as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo. The film follows the detectives as they search for a French heroin smuggler named Alain Charnier (whose name in real life was Jean Jehan).\n\nYou may also like: Movies audiences hated but critics loved\n\n#80. Empire of the Sun\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1987\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nThe film tells the story of Jamie “Jim” Graham (Christian Bale), a spoiled young boy from a wealthy British family in Shanghai who becomes a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp during World War II and is later separated from his parents. The film follows Jim as he tries to survive on his own.\n\n#79. The Last of the Mohicans\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1992\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\nSet in 1757, “The Last of the Mohicans” depicts the French and Indian War in the Ohio River Valley. The film, written and directed by Michael Mann, is based on an 1826 novel by the same name. One historian applauded Mann’s attention to detail in costumes and liked his use of French and Indian language, but she criticized the historical accuracy of some of the dialogue.\n\n#78. Hidden Figures\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2016\n\nDirector: Theodore Melfi\n\n“Hidden Figures” shines a light on three black female mathematicians—Katherine Goble (later Johnson), Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan—working at NASA during a time when racial segregation and workplace sexism were still the norm. The film is based on a nonfiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly—who consulted on the film—and centers on the story of Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) who confirmed, by hand, the formula that helped John Glenn make the first human trip around the Earth. Shetterly said that while the main plot of the movie is true, there were far more people who worked on the space projects than depicted in the movie.\n\n#77. Remember the Titans\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2000\n\nDirector: Boaz Yakin\n\nDenzel Washington portrays Herman Boone, a black coach who led the first integrated football team at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971. Washington portrayed Boone as an inspirational character, but some say the real-life Boone wasn’t quite so nice or the cause of the team’s success. The movie also claims that they only played white teams, but many other high school teams were integrated.\n\n#76. Changeling\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2008\n\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\n\nThe film was based on the events surrounding the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop Murders in Mira Loma, California. Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins, whose 9-year-old son goes missing. Collins is institutionalized by authorities when she declares that a boy claiming to be her son is an imposter.

The Big Short\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2015\n\nDirector: Adam McKay\n\n“The Big Short” tells the backstory of how subprime mortgages led to the 2008 housing catastrophe—and subsequent financial crisis—and how signs of an impending crisis were ignored. The film is based on the nonfiction book of the same title written by Michael Lewis. While most names have been changed, the film stays true to the book’s description of the main characters and the timeline of events. What is true to life: Michael Burry (Christian Bale) was a stock market investor who went shoeless and listened to trash metal.\n\n#73. The Fighter\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2010\n\nDirector: David O. Russell\n\nMark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts, who turned his losing streak around and won the WBU light welterweight title in 2000. Ward’s family—a chain-smoking mother, seven sisters, and a crack-addicted half brother—are major forces in the film. Ward said the movie actually toned down the group.\n\n#72. American Gangster\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2007\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nDenzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, a drug lord from the 1970s. While the film portrayed Lucas descending into the jungles of Southeast Asia during Vietnam and smuggling drugs inside soldiers’ caskets, these events never actually happened.\n\n#71. Captain Phillips\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 2013\n\nDirector: Paul Greengrass\n\nThe film depicts the actions of Capt. Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), whose cargo ship was taken hostage by Somali pirates. It is based on Phillips' memoir, \"A Captain's Duty.\" Two things the movie fictionalized: Phillips and the crew did not trick one of the pirates with broken glass on the ground, and he did not feel sorry for any of the captors. Crew members aboard the real-life ship allege Phillips wasn't the hero he made himself out to be.\n\n#70. Titanic\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.8\n\nYear: 1997\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nDirector James Cameron tells the story of the sinking of the Titanic. While the character or Margaret Brown (Kathy Bates)—who tried to get unfilled lifeboats to take on more people—is based on a real-life passenger, Jack and Rose (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) were Hollywood creations. Another fact: the violinist continued to play as the boat sank.\n\n#69. The Killing Fields\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1984\n\nDirector: Roland Joffé\n\nThis biographical drama is based on the experiences of an American journalist, Sydney Schanberg, and his Cambodian fixer, Dith Pran, during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in 1984.

The Right Stuff\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1983\n\nDirector: Philip Kaufman\n\nThe film tells the story of the Mercury Seven, the first astronauts of the United States space program. While the film—which is based on Tom Wolfe’s book of the same name—leaves out some controversy surrounding Virgil “Gus” Grissom, it sticks to historical facts about the space race.\n\n#67. Badlands\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1973\n\nDirector: Terrence Malick\n\nWhile the movie and character names are fictional, it is based on the murder spree of Charles Starkweather and his accomplice Caril Ann Fugate in 1958. Fugate, at 14 years old, didn’t murder anyone, but accompanied Starkweather as he killed 11 people in the Badlands of Wyoming and Nebraska.\n\n#66. My Left Foot\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1989\n\nDirector: Jim Sheridan\n\nDaniel-Day Lewis plays Christy Brown, an Irish man born with cerebral palsy who could only control his left foot. Brown grew up poor and mostly paralyzed, but he became a writer and painter. The film left out the not-so-happy ending with Brown's real-life wife and nurse, Mary Carr.\n\n#65. The African Queen\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1951\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nKatharine Hepburn plays Rosie, a missionary who chooses to stay in the Congo as the First World War starts.

Bonnie and Clyde\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1967\n\nDirector: Arthur Penn\n\nThe film follows the true story of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, who went on a crime spree that ended after a six-month manhunt. The film accurately portrays Bonnie as a waitress in Texas who runs off with Clyde—already familiar with prison—and that the two become famous after a major shootout with police. In reality, it’s not clear just how involved Bonnie was with the actual shooting, or if she and Clyde were more than travel companions.\n\n#63. Spartacus\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1960\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\n\nThis epic historical drama is based on life story of Spartacus, the leader of a slave revolt who died in 71 B.C., and the events of the Third Servile War.

Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick). The film tells the story of the unit’s efforts at the assault on Fort Wagner.\n\n#61. Letters from Iwo Jima\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 2006\n\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\n\nThe film tells the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers.

The Insider\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1999\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\n“The Insider” is based on the true story between Jeffrey Wigand, a research scientist at a major tobacco company, and a producer at CBS, Lowell Bergman, who helped Wigand speak out on the harmful effects of nicotine.

Ed Wood\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1994\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nDirector Tim Burton casts Johnny Depp as filmmaker Ed Wood. Burton portrayed Wood, who was an alcoholic and a womanizer, as a more sympathetic character in the film than he was in real life.\n\n#58. Straight Outta Compton\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 2015\n\nDirector: F. Gary Gray\n\nThis biopic tells the story of N.W.A., the controversial gangsta rap group that started in the 1980s whose members included Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube. The latter two were producers as was Eazy-E’s widow. Ice Cube is played by his actual son, O’Shea Jackson Jr. While some details are changed in the film, one fact is true: Dr. Dre did get Eazy-E to bail him out of jail, and Dre later produced a track for Eazy-E to return the favor.\n\n#57. Walk the Line\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 2005\n\nDirector: James Mangold\n\n“Walk the Line” tells the story behind one of country music’s most famous love stories: Johnny Cash and June Carter. Johnny Cash’s daughter Kathy objected to how her mother—Cash’s first wife, who he had four children with—was portrayed in the film. Kathy Cash said her mother was supportive of the musician until he started using drugs and stopped coming home.\n\n#56. The Untouchables\n\nIMDb user rating: 7.9\n\nYear: 1987\n\nDirector: Brian De Palma\n\nSet during Prohibition in 1930, this drama is based on the story of crime boss Al Capone—who kept the liquor flowing in Chicago—and Eliot Ness, a Prohibition agent assigned to stop Capone.

Aguirre, the Wrath of God\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 1972\n\nDirector: Werner Herzog\n\nHerzog’s film is a fictionalized work based on Lope de Aguirre, a Spanish adventurer in the 16th century who sought El Dorado (the city of gold), and the failed expedition of the conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro. While the events in history are true, Herzog created the characters that appear in the movie.\n\n#54. Battleship Potemkin\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 1925\n\nDirector: Sergei M. Eisenstein\n\nThis silent film is based on a mutiny that occurred in 1905 on the Russian battleship Potemkin. In the film, the crew revolted after they were given maggot-filled meat. However, many parts of the movie plot were embellished.\n\n#53. Stalag 17\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 1953\n\nDirector(s): Billy Wilder\n\n“Stalag 17” is a comedy war film set in a German prisoner-of-war camp. It was adapted from a based-on-real-life Broadway play written by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski—Air Force sergeants who were prisoners in Stalag 17B in Austria.\n\n#52. The Sea Inside\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 2004\n\nDirector: Alejandro Amenábar\n\nThis heart-wrenching tale is based on the real-life battle of Ramón Sampedro, who fought for 30 years to get the right to end his life after an accident left him paralyzed from the neck down. The film shows various friends and family administering Sampedro cyanide poison and the life-ending event that he filmed.\n\n#51. Patton\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 1970\n\nDirector: Franklin J. Schaffner\n\nThis epic biopic is based on the life of Gen. George S. Patton during World War II. Some of the military props in the film are inaccurate, and it also shows Patton scolding a soldier—who had malaria—for being a coward and only begrudgingly apologizing when he found out the soldier was sick. In real life, Patton felt bad about his comments.\n\nYou may also like: All Marvel movies ranked worst to best\n\n#50. All the President's Men\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 1976\n\nDirector: Alan J. Pakula\n\nRobert Redford and Dustin Hoffman star as the journalistic duo of Woodward and Bernstein, The Washington Post reporters who exposed President Richard Nixon with their coverage of the Watergate scandal. The film is based on the nonfiction book of the same name written by Woodward and Bernstein. While the movie pays close attention to factual details, the scene where Bernstein lures a receptionist away from her boss (Ned Beatty) with a fake phone call never happened.\n\n#49. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 2007\n\nDirector: Julian Schnabel\n\nThe film tells the story of Jean-Dominique Bauby, the editor of French Elle magazine who suffered a stroke in 1995. He was in a coma for 20 days after which he woke up completely paralyzed with a condition known as locked-in syndrome. The film is based on the process and content of Bauby’s memoir, which he dictated by blinking his left eye to a transcriber to convey letters.\n\nSome differences between real-life and the film are that Bauby did not write about a bevy of women surrounding him after his stroke. His real girlfriend also didn’t call to say she couldn’t visit, and she actually spent time with him in the hospital.\n\n#48. Papillon\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 1973\n\nDirector: Franklin J. Schaffner\n\nBased on the semi-autobiographical novel by Henri Charriere, “Papillon” depicts the life of a prisoner (who was framed for murder) and sentenced to the French Guiana penal colony of Devil’s Island.

JFK\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 1991\n\nDirector: Oliver Stone\n\nDirector Oliver Stone mixes historical facts with conspiracy theories in his film about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The official story is that JFK was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, who acted alone. One point of fiction in the film: David Ferrie, a real person, confesses his involvement, but he maintained his innocence in real life.\n\n#46. Cinderella Man\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 2005\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nDirector Ron Howard shows the story of Irish-American heavyweight boxing champion James L. Braddock. The Chicago Tribune claimed Howard glorified Braddock and inaccurately portrayed Braddock's opponent, boxer Max Baer, as an \"evil, unredeemable man.\" Baer also didn't train that much, making the upset by Braddock less impressive in real life, the critic noted.\n\nYou may also like: Iconic quotes from '70s movies\n\n#45. Ip Man\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 2008\n\nDirector: Wilson Yip\n\nThis martial arts biopic is modeled on Ip Man, a Wing Chun master and teacher to Bruce Lee.

Woodruff starts the Dallas Buyers Club to distribute treatments not yet approved by the FDA to fellow HIV/AIDS victims. While much of the story is true to life, some things were fictionalized. For example, Woodruff never actually competed in rodeos, and the characters played by Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto weren’t real people.\n\n#42. The Pursuit of Happyness\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 2006\n\nDirector: Gabriele Muccino\n\nWill Smith portrays Chris Gardner, an entrepreneur and single father who tries to raise his son—played by Smith’s real son Jaden—while homeless.

The King's Speech\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 2010\n\nDirector: Tom Hooper\n\nColin Firth plays King George VI, who must give radio broadcasts, as he struggles to overcome stuttering. Some criticize the film for avoiding to point out that George VI once supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s concessions to the Nazis.

The Imitation Game\n\nIMDb user rating: 8\n\nYear: 2014\n\nDirector: Morten Tyldum\n\nBased on the biography “Alan Turing, The Enigma,” Benedict Cumberbatch portrays the father of computer science in “The Imitation Game.” In real life, and in the movie, Turing helped break the code of the German military's Enigma machine. Since not much is known about the personal life of Turing—a closeted gay man—much of the film is embellished. However, Turing was forced to become chemically castrated because his homosexual activity was illegal, and he committed suicide with cyanide.\n\nWhat wasn’t true? Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) didn’t fight with her parents about cracking codes for the government, and she never completed a crossword puzzle test to get the job.\n\n#37.

The film fictionalized some characters, and some of its historical accuracy have been called into question.\n\n#32. Mary and Max\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.1\n\nYear: 2009\n\nDirector: Adam Elliot\n\nThis animated comedy is based on the real-life relationship between the director and his pen pal of 20 years.

Hotel Rwanda\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.1\n\nYear: 2004\n\nDirector: Terry George\n\n“Hotel Rwanda” is based on the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his wife Tatiana who sheltered refuges in the Hotel des Mille Collines during the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

Hacksaw Ridge\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.1\n\nYear: 2016\n\nDirector: Mel Gibson\n\nThis war drama tells the story of Private Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic, during World War II. The film is based on the documentary “The Conscientious Objector.” Doss refused to carry a weapon in the war, but saved around 75 men (he says 50, his battalion says 100) after they came under gunfire at Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa. Some characters are fictionalized and the cliff in the film isn’t the actual Hacksaw Ridge.\n\n#26. Spotlight\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.1\n\nYear: 2015\n\nDirector: Tom McCarthy\n\nThe film is based on The Boston Globe's Spotlight team, a set of investigative journalists.

Into the Wild\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.1\n\nYear: 2007\n\nDirector: Sean Penn\n\nThe film is based by the eponymous nonfiction book written by Jon Krakauer.

The film is based on Northup’s 1853 memoir of the same name. The gritty screenplay stays true to the book, depicting it accurately in the film. One heart wrenching, but believable, scene is fiction: when Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) asks Northup to kill her.\n\n#22. Catch Me If You Can\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.1\n\nYear: 2002\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg shows the story of Frank Abagnale, a teenage con man who served almost four years in prison after getting caught for posing as a Pan Am pilot (he wanted free tickets but never flew) and cashing forged checks.

Though these characters are depicted in the film, some of his outlandish cons are unverified.\n\n#21.

The Elephant Man\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.2\n\nYear: 1980\n\nDirector: David Lynch\n\nDirector David Lynch based his film on Joseph Merrick, a man with a severe facial deformity that led many to believe he lacked intelligence.

Actor Bradley Cooper, who plays the Elephant Man in the Broadway play of the same name, credits the film with inspiring him to become an actor.\n\n#17. The Great Escape\n\nIMDb user rating: 8.2\n\nYear: 1963\n\nDirector: John Sturges\n\nThis 1963 epic World War II film shows the escape of Allied prisoners of war from a German camp.
