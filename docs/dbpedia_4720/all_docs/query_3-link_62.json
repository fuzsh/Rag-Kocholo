        "text": "http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/bl...-join-savanna-herd-at-disneys-animal-kingdom/\n\nWildlife Wednesdays: Sable Antelope Calves Join Savanna Herd at Disney's Animal Kingdom\n\nAfter spending about two months in their backstage habitat bonding with other members of their herd, three sable antelope calves, born this summer at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, have joined the herd on the Kilimanjaro Safaris savanna. The calves – two males and one female – were cared for in their backstage home because sable moms typically will “tuck” their calves in high grass to protect them from the predators they might encounter in the wild and return to them periodically for feeding. This behavior could prevent our animal care team from being able to monitor the calves properly. The calves are now old enough to be out of the “tuck ing” phase and are spending the day traveling with the rest of the sable antelope herd, as seen in this photo by Gene Duncan.\n\nAt birth, the calves weighed between 35 and 40 pounds. When they reach adulthood, the female will weigh nearly 400 pounds, and the males will be about 50 pounds heavier. In their native habitat in southern Africa, the sable’s natural predator is the lion and other carnivores. Like many African species, sable antelopes compete for living space with humans.\n\nDisney’s Animal Kingdom guests can see the sables when they ride the Kilimanjaro Safaris. Another great way to see the sable antelope – and a host of other African wildlife – is by experiencing the Wild Africa Trek, a special adventure that includes a VIP safari and a visit to an exclusive safari camp with fantastic views of the wildlife on the savanna.\n\nSable antelope fun facts:\n\nThe sable has a short glossy coat, which ranges in color from a yellow- or reddish-brown to a rich chestnut found in females and their young.\n\nWhen fighting, they go down on their knees, displaying their long curving horns, which measure 20 to 61 inches.\n\nThey have a high-pitched squeal and produce a horse-like snort when alarmed.\n\nNew Baby White Rhino!\n\nRhino Mom Welcomes Newest Addition to Disney's Animal Kingdom Family\n\nWe are very pleased to announce that a white rhino calf, a boy (no name yet—the team is still deciding), was born May 4 at Disney’s Animal Kingdom. Disney photographer Gene Duncan stopped by to take some photos, and we’re happy to share them with you.\n\nThis birth was the fourth for mom, Kendi, a 13-year-old white rhino, who was the first rhino born at the park. A rhino birth is a significant event because at one time the species was nearly extinct. As a result of conservation efforts and careful management, the species has grown to number approximately 20,150 worldwide, with 215 residing in North American zoological parks.\n\nThe success of our white rhino breeding program has enabled our animal care team to make a direct contribution to the conservation of white rhinos in the wild. In 2006, Nande and Hasani, two rhinos born at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, traveled to Africa to join four others at Ziwa Sanctuary in Uganda, where they are helping to reestablish a population that had been extinct since the 1980s. In 2009, Nande became the first white rhino to give birth in Uganda in 27 years; she gave birth to a second calf last year.\n\nOur new calf currently is bonding with mom in their backstage home and will join the other rhinos on the savanna of the Kilimanjaro Safaris in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund and the Disney Foundation have provided more than $1 million in support to programs in Africa and Asia to protect the last five remaining species of rhino.\n\nMore images can be found in the article itself."
