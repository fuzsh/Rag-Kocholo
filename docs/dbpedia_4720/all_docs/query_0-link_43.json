ago\n\nfew schools had little more than basal textbooks and a\n\nchalkboard Through the combined efforts of educators\n\npublishers and producers children in the schools of today\n\nare provided with a myriad of printed and audiovisual\n\nmaterial The teaching film is one of these resources which\n\nhelps to make learning come alive and to bring the world into\n\nthe classroom\n\nWhen you order a film or receive one through the\n\nmails it is not just a routine affair You are affecting\n\nthe education of some Georgia child somewhere in a\n\nclassroom Who knows but that he may see a subject come\n\nalive from that film and understand things he never under\n\nstood before Democracy puts its faith in the inquiring mind\n\nThe child who wants to learn can learn better if the\n\ncurriculum is made interesting with relevant and dynamic\n\nteaching media like films\n\no\n\nu\n\ns\n\nZ\n\nThis catalog should prove to be a useful tool\n\nTeachers and students of Georgia schools will find the\n\nstate films useful and interesting in teaching and\n\nlearning\n\nat\n\nCLAUDE L PURCELL\n\nState Superintendent of Schools\n\nz\n\no\n\nZ\n\nAtlanta\n\nAugust 1964TO GEORGIAS SCHOOL LEADERS

films\n\nnow owned by the State is also being continued Older films\n\nwhich have been revised are being exchanged for newer editions\n\nFilms which are no longer requested by the schools are being\n\nexamined for future use or discontinuation In summary the\n\nAudioVisual Unit is attempting to keep films in the collection\n\nwhich are applicable and useable\n\nFilms which are selected carefully and used properly\n\npresent information to the students which teachers cannot pos\n\nsibly do in such a dramatic way The information also may not\n\nbe possible to present to students in any other way The pres\n\nsure of time and the content to be covered necessitates careful\n\nselection of the films Thus teaching by film is just another\n\nmeans of presenting information to the students As with any\n\nother single method the usage of film requires its falling into\n\na total plan of organizing for learning No one means of teach\n\ning can do the job effectively for the

of the lesson and after film has\n\nbeen booked and confirmation received notice the date that the film can be sent to you and\n\nplan your lesson accordingly When the film arrives preview it reviewing its content and\n\ntake down teaching cues and points to be looked for in the film Teacher handbooks or guides\n\nare available for use with most films These are inexpensive and should be in every school\n\nlibrary Those film descriptions with an asterisk following have guides available These\n\nguides can be ordered directly from the producer\n\nThe following questions may serve as a guide to teachers in selecting effective films\n\n1 What is my teaching problem Will a sound film help\n\n2 Does the film offer sufficient material directly related to the teaching problem\n\n3 Is the presentation suited to the learning level of the class\n\n4 Will the running time of the film allow sufficient time in the class period for\n\nadequate introduction and followup discussions\n\nI\n\n5 Is the material presented technically accurate and appropriate to the local\n\nteaching problem\n\nUSING THE FILM\n\nTeachers must remember that films are not automatic selfteaching devices AudioVisual\n\nmaterials will make teaching more effective A film is effective only when the lesson in which\n\nit is used has been carefully planned The film presentation must be integrated with previous\n\nstudent experiences and there should be a followup discussion\n\nThe following is presented as an ideal teaching plan for a film This plan can be adapted\n\nfor use of other aids If it is impractical to use this entire plan you may adapt it to fit\n\nyour local needs using the principles laid down to insure that your students will have new\n\nexperiences and that your teaching objectives will be achieved\n\nA SUGGESTED TEACHING PLAN FOR A FILM\n\nStep\n\nPurpose\n\nTiming\n\nProcedure\n\n1 Homework\n\nassigned\n\nfor pupils\n\nTo review related subject\n\nmatter and be

themselves with the films listed in this catalog which relate to their particular\n\nfields of instruction selecting and using those which will supplement and enrich their teaching remembering always\n\nth3t the film alone cannot take the place of the teacher\n\nAuthorities are agreed that the film makes its greatest contribution to the learning situation when used as a\n\nnatural part of the lesson under the same conditions under which the class usually meets It is true that many schools\n\nwill have difficulties providing suitable projection condition for the individual classrooms and will have to use some\n\nroom in the building where these facilities are available This necessitates the moving of the class through the building\n\nwhen a film is to be used in the lesson plan It is better to have one room properly darkened and ventilated than to\n\nhave all the rooms half darkened and no ventilation The State School Architect will gladly help you plan your room for\n\nthe use of AudioVisual Aids\n\nThe use of a classroom film requires essentially the same teacher and student participation which is present in\n\nall good teaching and learning situations A film should only be used to help the teacher develop definite objectives\n\nThis requires much planning by the teacher before the film is shown\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR PROJECTING FILMS\n\n1 Always project films under the best possible conditions See that the room is darkened adequately ventilated\n\nand that the seating is properly arranged\n\n2 Do not run any film borrowed from this Department on a silent projector USE NOTHING BUT SOUND PROJECTOR The\n\nfilms are all sound\n\n3 Be sure that the film tract and aperture of ycur projector are cleaned after every reel of film is run Film\n\ndamage is expensive and unnecessary\n\n4 Allow only an experienced projectionist to run the projector and see that projectionist remains near the machine\n\nat all times so that it can be cut off if damage starts to occur\n\n5 Whenever you are ready to project a film remove it from the film case and can leaving the pink shipping\n\nticket in the case so that the same film and can may be replaced in the same case when the film is ready to be\n\nreturned to your Film Library Remove the small piece of masking tape which is used to hold down the front of\n\nthe film and stick the tape on the edge of your projector to be used later\n\n6 It is recommended that some kind of liquid film conditioner be applied to the side of the film at this point\n\njust before it is placed on the projector This will lubricate the film in such a manner so that the film will\n\ngo through your projector with a great deal more ease and will greatly lessen the possibility of film damage\n\n7 Thread the film into your projector carefully seeing that the film is properly engaged in the sprockets and\n\nthat the loops are carefully formed above and below the film gate After threading the machine it should be\n\nrolled by hand or the motor switched flipped on and off quickly and the film observed at each sprocket to see\n\nthat it is properly engaged and that you do not loose the loops above or below the film gate Be sure to use\n\nthe same size reel for the take up as the film comes wound on Do not switch reel sizes\n\n8 After starting the projecting of the picture feel of the film after it comes from the machine and just before\n\nit winds onto the takeup reel By frequently feeling of the film at this position it will be very easy to\n\ndetect any damage that might be occuring The film will feel rough or torn and by twisting the film into the\n\nlight reflections scratches can easily be detected\n\nXII\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nSee that the projectionist remains at or near the machine at all times and that the film is frequently checked\n\nas indicated above in order to avoid extensive film damage\n\nAfter the film has been run remove the reel of film from the takeup take the masking tape and stick down the\n\nend of the film and replace the film in the film can DO NOT REWIND THE FILM AFTER SHOWING Always wait until\n\nyou are ready to show the film the second time before rewinding then if the occasion should arise that you do\n\nnot get to show the film it can be returned not rewound\n\nWhen rewinding films be extremely careful since there is always danger of breaking or further damaging the\n\nfilm Remember that the rewinds are extremely fast and it is a good idea to apply a little pressure on the side\n\nof the reel of film with the hand by using a handkerchief or a small piece of cardboard to protect your fingers\n\nThis will insure that the rewound film will be tight on the reel and this braking also helps to avoid acci\n\ndental breakage or damage of the films After starting the rewind do not stop it unless some trouble occurs\n\nand should it become necessary to stop the rewind always brake the reel of film that is being rewound by\n\napplying pressure on the side of the film reel as indicated above This will always avoid breakage of the film\n\nand keep the film from unwinding on the floor\n\nIf a film is broken for any reason do not use cellophane tape or other substances on the film This usually\n\ncauses more damage and may cause suspension of service Pull film down rethread and wind end of film around\n\nreel\n\nAfter the last showing of the film the film should not be rewound but stick the end of the film down and place\n\nit into the proper film can and place the film can back into the same case in which it was received Be careful\n\nthat the lids for the various cans that you may have on hand do not become mixed and that the lids of the cases\n\nproperly fit the bottoms of the cases Place the lid on the case so that the strap crosses the narrowest width\n\nof the address card Before the films are placed in the mail to be returned to the Film Library the coordinator\n\nshould check for the following\n\na See that each film is not rewound\n\nb See that the proper film is in the proper can and that the same film is returned in the same case in\n\nwhich it was received\n\nc See that the address card is turned over and that the address of your Film Library is on the outside of\n\nthe case\n\nFollow the manufacturers instruction for oiling and caring for the projector See that you have a brush with\n\nwhich to clean the film gate Your projector is a fine electronic instrument and should receive proper care if\n\nyou expect it to give good service\n\nPlease do not allow your projector to become badly worn for the lack of care proper inspection and repairs to\n\nthe extent that it will perhaps do hundreds of dollars worth of film damage before its condition is known\n\nYearly inspection and overhaul by your dealer ox a competent repairman is highly important and is advised for\n\nthe proper maintenance and care of your projector\n\nXIIISutoCD\n\nYou cannot harm the projector by using it There\n\nis nothing in the usual handling that will damage\n\nthe machine Oil after each three hours of running\n\ntime and clean film gate before each film is run\n\nA brush is necessary Use carbontetrachloride or\n\nvitafilm to remove hardened deposits Anytime a\n\nfilm is burned in the projector clean film gate\n\nthoroughly\n\nYour projector should never be stopped to study\n\nsingle frames The danger of film damage out\n\nweighs the value Always stop projector still before\n\nreversing\n\nAlways see that your projector is properly threaded\n\nbefore starting it Check each sprocket and both\n\nloops Roll projector by hand or switch machine on\n\nand off to check\n\nPLEASE return the film\n\nXIV\n\nTmm\n\nOperators should feel the film along the sprocket\n\nholes every few feet while the film is being pro\n\njected Damage to film can be restricted to a few\n\nfeet by this precaution\n\nSelect the same size empty reel for the film you are\n\nshowing\n\nJVJ\n\nft\n\nFor further information and assistance about the\n\noperation or your projector or the proper training\n\nof projectionists call or write the dealer or sales\n\nman that sells and services your make of projector\n\nWITHOUT rewinding\n\nCourtesy AudioVisual Aids Section Los Angeles City
