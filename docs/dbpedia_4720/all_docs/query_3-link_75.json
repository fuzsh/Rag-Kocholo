Let me begin by thanking Maryellen Green, my first research assistant, who found many of these stories in early folklore journals. Elena P. (Carmela) Morales read through dozens and dozens of Hispanic tales, taking notes and making recommendations. Debbie Gill answered some translation questions. Our local DuBois campus library staff was ever supportive. Anne Hummer, in particular, coordinated literally hundreds of interlibrary loans and article requests with unfailing good cheer. Karen Fuller helped with sticky research issues. Paul Fehrenbach transcribed the music. The Penn State English Department, the Commonwealth College, The Penn State Global Fund, and several DuBois Campus Directors of Academic Affairs provided travel funds. The Penn State Institute for the Arts and Humanistic Studies funded released time. The DuBois Education Foundation funded research assistants and travel. The DuBois Campus supported a sabbatical during which this book first took shape. Chris Klinger, the faculty staff assistant, was always ready to help. And other typists and research assistants contributed more than I can thank them for. Many folklore colleagues offered encouragement. Charles Perdue, in addition, sent a tale. Linda Dégh sent a valuable pair of tales. And Jim Leary sent a tale, photographs, and the analysis that now appears in chapter 18. The late George Reinecke translated a Cajun tale and Mary Beth Wesdock translated one of the Spanish tales. Brian Roberts read selected chapters in manuscript. Manuel da Luz Goncalves helped with transcribing Cape Verde Kriolu. The folks at the American Antiquarian Society were genial hosts for a week, as was my\n\nxiii\n\nAcknowledgments wife’s aunt Dorothy Bourget, who provided meals and resting place during that week. The many copyright holders and other holders of rights are acknowledged elsewhere, but to them too I extend my thanks for their kindness and patience. And special thanks go to all the storytellers who shared their stories with me. Finally, I want to thank my children, Will, Barbara, and Maura, who regularly reinvigorated my interest in folktales by asking for more. My wife, Eileen, and daughter Maura typed and helped with other chores. And all my family provided constant interest, support, and encouragement. To all of you and to all I have, alas, overlooked, many thanks.\n\nxiv\n\nC i n de re l l a i n A m e r i c a\n\nI nt r od uc t i on Yarns Older than Uncle Sam\n\nThe rather hefty volume you are now holding would at one time have seemed an impossibility. American folktales? We knew what those were. They were the tall tales, the jokes, and the urban legends that Americans love so much. But tales of magic? Tales of clever heroes outwitting giants and ogres and oppressive masters? Tales of beautiful younger sisters wedding handsome princes? The kinds of things we call fairy tales? No, Americans never really told stories like that—except for a few that they got out of Grimm or Anderson and told to children until the children got too old for that kind of stuff. The great European tale tradition did not take root in America, we thought. The first settlers—and the later immigrants as well—were too practical-minded to enjoy such trifles, and besides there was no time in the busy workdays of our ancestors to tell those long stories. A quick joke in passing, an outrageous lie told around the stove, or a bit of gossip about some horrific coincidence that really happened to a friend of a friend—they had time for that, of course. But who had time for the long elaborate stories about kings and magicians and talking horses? About magical advice and magical countries beyond the beyond? Nobody. Certainly nobody in our hard-working democracy. Such was the conventional wisdom passed down in folklore courses and textbooks.1 American folklore, we thought, included ballads and dance tunes, arts and crafts, and traditions of cuisine, but not magical stories like those the\n\n3\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam Grimm brothers edited in early nineteenth-century Germany, Asbjornsen and Moe collected in Norway, and Afanas’ev collected in Russia. But if that is true, if Americans did not tell those stories, then where did this heavy book come from? For here you will read about poor heroes and proud heroines, witches and giants, kings and wizards, magic whistles and talking horses—all the trappings of yams older than Uncle Sam, older, indeed, than memory. In point of fact, however, the land that we now call the United States has a five-hundred-year-old tradition of wonder tales. They came with wave after wave of settlers, beginning almost surely with the first Spanish settlers in Puerto Rico. They were entrenched well enough to be unambiguously documented by 1800.2 And they have been collected by scholars, enthusiasts, and common folk for at least two hundred years.\n\nWhat t o Cal l The se S t or i e s But before I can go on, there is a nagging problem that must be solved. What stories are we talking about, and what shall we call them? There is not any single term that unambiguously identifies the particular range of stories represented in this volume. Here are some of the choices. 1. We could call them fairy tales. In fact, I have used that term in the title of this book. In popular usage, fairy tales covers the ground fairly well. And it is the term used in English not only for the tales in Grimm but also for the tales in Asbjornsen and Moe’s Norwegian collection, in Afanas’ev’s Russian collection—both of them closer to oral tradition than the Grimm collection—and in Joseph Jacobs’s rather mixed English collection. But of course most of the stories have nothing to do with fairies. Moreover, American scholars, wrestling with this terminology problem, now restrict the term fairy tale to writer-composed tales fashioned in imitation of traditional stories and story-forms—the tales of Hans Christian Andersen, for instance, or Carl Sandburg’s Rootabaga Stories. So, now that we are past the title, we can’t use that term further. 2. Folktales is a term much used in recent collections. The principal problem with it is that it is too broad. Jokes and legends, for example, are folktales. And many scholars would include personal experience narratives under this term. Moreover, the phrase American folktales almost always connotes tall tales. None of these genres figures prominently in the present collection or in the cognate European collections. 3. Wonder tales is also a term sometimes used, especially with reference to the cognate Irish repertoire. But it doesn’t seem particularly apt for the animal\n\n4\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam tales or tales of clever tricksters that figure prominently in the American repertoire. And the term has not really achieved widespread acceptance and usage. 4. Legends is another troublesome term. Teens are fond of urban legends. Other types of belief legends are also found widely distributed in the United States. But these narratives are not the materials gathered in this volume. Moreover, for many people the term American legends means Paul Bunyan or Pecos Bill. These latter stories, insofar as they have any claim to being considered folktales, belong to the genre of tall tales. They are not what this book holds. 5. Märchen, a German term, covers much the same ground as Wonder Tales. But its use is sometimes restricted to stories of heroes (or heroines) and magic, such as “Jack and the Beanstalk,” “Cinderella,” or “Puss in Boots.” This term will sometimes be used in the present collection when this particular type of tale is meant. 6. So we are left with tales. This term applies equally well to wonder tales or märchen, animal tales, jests, or humorous stories, to all the stories included in this volume, and it is the term that will usually be used. It is, of course, too broad. But all these terms are either too broad or too narrow, and this one at least has the virtue of simplicity.\n\nThe O ld-Wor ld R o o t s of Th e se Tal e s The stories in this collection have their roots in the Old World, specifically in that part of it that extends from Ireland on the west to Russia and Armenia on the east, and from Scandinavia on the north to the Mediterranean countries on the south. This largely Indo-European world possesses as part of its traditional culture a single repertoire of tales and tale genres found throughout its length and breadth. This broad repertoire of tales is united by a European sensibility, worldview, aesthetic, and value system. And this sensibility, worldview, aesthetic, and value system distinguishes it even from closely related tale repertoires such as those of India or the Muslim Middle East, to say nothing of more distant repertoires such as those of the Far East, Sub-Saharan Africa, or Native America. Of course no single part of this region has possessed the entire repertoire as part of its traditional culture. But the traditional tale repertoires of the various subregions are representative of the whole repertoire at the same time that they are distinctive to the particular subregions. Credit must go to the Grimm brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm, for recognizing the scope of this repertoire and its unity. Their famous collection\n\n5\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam of “fairy tales,” the Kinder- und Hausmärchen, provided the model for many later national and regional collections. The Grimm collection includes a wide range of genres or types of tales. There are the magical wonder tales such as “Cinderella,” “Godfather Death,” and “The Singing Bone.” There are novelle or romantic tales, much like wonder tales but without the magic element, such as “King Thrushbeard” and “The Robber Bridegroom.” Animal tales include “The Wolf and Seven Kids,” “The Mouse, the Bird, and the Sausage,” and “The Bremen Town Musicians.” Humorous tales include stupid ogre tales such as “The Young Giant,” stories about human stupidity such as “Clever Hans” and “Clever Else,” tales about human trickery such as “The Brave Little Tailor” and “Doctor Know-All,” and tales about putting one over on the parson such as “Old Hildebrand.” Several of the tales are formulaic, including “Clever Hans,” “The Wedding of Mrs. Fox,” and “The Louse and the Flea.” These are the same categories of stories, and in many cases the same stories as were gathered in the earlier French and Italian collections and in the later national collections from all over the European world. Obviously these are not the only folktales known in European culture. Jokes, tall tales, personal experience narratives, and legends also thrive. But tales from those genres are not a part of the tale repertoire identified by Grimm. And they are not usually found in the classic European collections modeled on the Grimm collection. And indeed, this seemingly diverse range of tales does make up a unified repertoire. It is unified first by its distribution throughout the area under discussion. But it is further unified in that tales from any one of these distinct genres may feature the same central character, call him Jack or Hans or Ivan or Merrywise. He may be the bold hero who goes in search of a wonder-tale princess, or the fearless lad who overcomes a stupid ogre, or the clever trickster who outwits a mean employer or king, or even a human companion in an animal tale. Furthermore, storytellers who tell stories from one of these genres will usually tell stories from other genres without making any distinction. Zsuzsanna Palkó, for instance, the great Hungarian storyteller whose repertoire Linda Dégh published, includes numbskull stories, tales of stupidity, and tales of cleverness, as well as wonder tales and novelle in her repertoire. This repertoire is unified, too, with reference to traditional audience and occasion. The particular audience and occasion will vary as one moves across the continent and through time. But in any particular time and place there will be a sense that this repertoire of stories is suitable for particular people and circumstances—for adults at a wake, for men working at fishing or lumbering, for children at bedtime or when helping with work, for young women amusing themselves as they do handwork, or for family and guests\n\n6\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam whiling away the long hours of winter darkness between sundown and sleep. And in any such culture the occasion and audience for these tales is different from the occasion and audience for jokes, legends, tall tales, or personal experience narratives. When a group of adolescents is exchanging jokes, for example, no one would think of breaking into the conversation with a long wonder tale. And if a group of men is vying with tall tales in a lying contest, no one would try to slip in an animal tale. In short, in these European cultures the culturally established occasions for telling this kind of tale tend to be distinct from the culturally established occasions for jokes, tall tales, or legends. Finally, the point of these tales is different from the point of a joke, tall tale, or legend. Jokes exist to evoke a laugh, and tall tales are usually competitive, deliberately drawing attention to the performance of the teller, while legends seek to draw in the listener to respond with a frisson or a comment about belief. The tales we are here talking about, however, exist principally for the joy of narrative. They evoke delight in what happens. They exist for the sake of the story. This repertoire of tales is principally an Indo-European repertoire. Indeed, the märchen itself may be a specifically Indo-European genre, though it is also shared by non-Indo-European peoples living in the region, such as the Finns and Hungarians.3 Doubtless, parts of the repertoire originally came in from other regions of the world and from other peoples. And the process of colonization has in turn brought elements of this repertoire to other regions of the world, notably to Africa and to the New World (including the United States), where it has spread to the non-Indo-European populations, especially African American, and Native American.\n\nS c op e of Th i s C ol l e c t i on There are many collections presenting this repertoire of tales as it has flourished from Ireland to Russia and Armenia. The French and Italians were active in publishing these stories in the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods. And once the Grimm brothers began publishing their great collection, scholars and collectors from nearly every region of Europe fell into step behind them. Some of these collectors, such as Calvino in his relatively recent Italian collection, have retold and rewritten the stories, just as Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm did. Others, such as the various editors of European volumes in the series Folktales of the World, have sought to present the tales in the words of the traditional storytellers. The repertoire as it spread to Spanish America has also been collected and published. And in the United States scholars have\n\n7\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam published regional collections in both journals and books. But until now no collection has sought to present the larger U.S. picture, insofar as that can be done. That is the task of the present volume: to demonstrate the scope of the Old World tale repertoire as it settled into U.S. American culture, changing, developing, and acclimating in much the way the tales of this repertoire have always settled and acclimated, wherever they have found themselves. The collection embraces wonder tales or märchen, novelle, animal tales, humorous tales, and formulaic tales. It limits itself to the tales derived directly or indirectly from the repertoire of European ancestors. (The Asian, African, Oceanic, and Native American repertoires are distinct, and a collection of such tales from the United States would demand a different approach.) Tales from the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), from France, and from the British Isles dominate, largely because the United States was first colonized from these three regions, but also because collectors sought such tales more aggressively. But this volume also includes tales from other European traditions. I have, moreover, included tales learned from Europeans by Native American peoples. Finally, I also include tales from the European repertoire as told by African Americans. In the latter case, as should be obvious, these tales often were learned in America from European Americans. But often too they had been learned in Africa from Europeans. Nor is it always easy to distinguish European tales brought to Africa by colonizers, travelers, or merchants from tales that may be quite as old in Africa as they are in the Indo-European world. Nevertheless, there can be no question of the importance of the African American contribution to the shaping of the European tale repertoire in the New World. We do not need to be afraid that recognizing how Africans have shaped tales from the European repertoire might detract from the recognition of how African Americans have preserved and shaped distinctly African elements of culture, any more than recognizing how African Americans have reshaped the European harmony system in jazz detracts from recognition of distinctly African elements in jazz. So this collection embraces such tales. This collection, however, excludes jokes, tall tales, and legends as such. It also excludes composed stories in a folk idiom. Here you will not find Pecos Bill and Paul Bunyan. Here you will not find the tall tales of Davy Crockett and the Southwestern humorists. And here you will not find selections from Carl Sandburg’s Rootabaga Stories (1922). But excluding jokes and legends is not so simple as would at first appear. In U.S. oral tradition folktales from the repertoire in question frequently migrate into other repertoires and become transformed. Tales show up as jokes or legends: A numbskull story becomes a Cajun joke, while a particularly\n\n8\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam horrifying märchen becomes a legend about a maid who cooks the child and serves it to the parents. So I have included tales from the repertoire that have become jokes or legends, to show how the process works. Occasionally, too, the opposite process takes place. Legends märchenize, becoming wonder tales about wailing witches or monster snakes, and I have included examples. This is the first time this range of American folktales has been gathered between the covers of one volume. Indeed, as I have already said, some have stated over and over that the old-world folktales did not gain any secure foothold in the United States. And yet I found many kinds of sources for folktales and a vast amount of material to choose from. The number of excellent regional collections, for example, is impressive. In addition, tales are lodged in journals, public archives, WPA files, archives of faculty collections and student papers at colleges and universities with folklore courses, proceedings of learned societies, and fugitive publications, as well as in my own field notes, in unpublished data generously shared by my fellow folklorists, and even on the internet. The earliest such tales to be collected in the United States were taken down not from a European American but from a MahicanMiami chief by one John Dunne (Smith 1939). Dunne included the tales in his “Notices Relative to Some of the Native Tribes of North America” in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, proceedings doubtless edited by Bishop Percy of ballad fame. The most recent tale here included was brought home from Girl Scout camp by my own daughter. The range of traditional folktales available today in collections, archives, manuscripts, and fugitive publications is indeed impressive. Of course none of that material would be available if collectors, professional and amateur, had not busied themselves with gathering it. The converse is also true: what is now available in collections, archives, manuscripts, and fugitive publications is limited to what collectors have bothered to put there. And this anthology must perforce submit to those limits, at least in part. Thus the material here assembled reflects, more than I should like, the vagaries of folktale collecting in the United States since the earliest days of the Republic. A number of factors have affected what stories would enter the record. In the first place, the largest ethnic groups are, as might be expected, the best represented. What is now the United States was settled in the colonial period largely by migrants from Spain, France, the British Isles, and German-speaking parts of Europe, roughly in that order, and by enslaved peoples from Africa. These ethnic groups, along with Native Americans, have turned out to be the best represented in the folkloric record. Consequently, a large part of the present anthology consists of tales with European roots gathered from representatives of these six ethnicities.\n\n9\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam But even within such limits the vagaries of collecting still operate. In the first three decades of the twentieth century, for example, it became very clear that the southern Appalachians housed a people with a rich musical tradition. One extended family, the Hickses and Harmons of western North Carolina, could boast of a seemingly limitless repertoire of songs to surprise avid collectors from Cecil Sharp to Frank and Anne Warner. But the equally rich folktale tradition was largely overlooked—despite significant publication in the Journal of American Folklore—until Marshall Ward, a cousin of the Hickses and the Harmons, confessed diffidently that he didn’t sing but that he did tell stories about Tom, Will, and Jack. Collectors still visit this family, and the folktale material amassed from this one group of kinsmen is probably vaster than the traditional folktale collection from whole states elsewhere in the country. Another decisive factor affecting what was collected was the early influence of Joel Chandler Harris’s books. Harris’s tales of Uncle Remus and Br’er Rabbit were a national sensation. In offering them to the reading public he inspired a whole cottage industry of gathering and setting down tales from the descendants of African slaves. Moreover, southern black servants, field hands, and tenant farmers conformed more closely to the definition of “folk” fashionable at the time of the founding of the American Folklore Society and the establishment of folklore as a field of enquiry. Consequently, many early folklorists devoted themselves to black tradition. Native Americans were the other U.S. group that seemed very “folk,” as that word was understood a hundred years ago. For many years the Journal of American Folklore devoted one issue a year to American Indian material, including tales. And some of those tales were European in origin. Fashion to some extent dictated not only which ethnic groups were suitable objects for folklore study but also which parts of the country were suitable regions for collecting folklore. Obviously, as we have already seen, the southern Appalachians seemed suitable. But indeed the whole South, from the Virginia tidewater to the Texas plains, featured picturesque rural populations from whom to gather tales. The Pennsylvania Germans were another such obvious choice for field collection. And the Schoharie Hills of New York, the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, and the rocky coasts of Maine offered good picking conveniently close to home—if home was one of the eastern colleges and universities where the study of folklore first took root. But whole sections of the country were relatively neglected, including the urban Northeast, much of the Midwest, and the Upper West and Northwest. This neglect has been corrected to some extent in the last forty years, but in the same period much of the nation has industrialized, and the collectible folklore\n\n10\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam in these regions as elsewhere in the country reflects this industrialized culture, often more than it reflects the old-world roots of the people. Fashion of another sort was a negative factor affecting what got collected. The early New England collectors did not have much respect for French Canadians, though there were many in New England. Nor for the Irish. Nor, later, for the Polish. As a result, though all three of these groups are of significant size in the United States, the collected record of their folktale traditions is quite skimpy. We have already seen how the fashion of collecting music from the people of the southern Appalachians almost led to overlooking the tale tradition. Fashion in collecting had more serious effect in some other cases. I am convinced that the reason I was not able to find Scandinavian folktales, despite the fact that the Old World Scandinavian tradition was so strong, is that Swedes were the fashionable ethnicity to research, and foodways, crafts, and customs—especially Christmas customs—were the fashionable areas for research. As a result, Swedish folklife in the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth century is well documented, but I have not found comparable data on a tale tradition, though some such tradition must have been there. Sometimes, however, an ethnic group was simply too small or too isolated to call attention to itself. Some ethnicities, too, worked hard to assimilate, shedding their language and the tales that were a part of that language. And it is indeed true, as scholars have been claiming for a hundred years, that daily life in the United States often does not make room for telling long leisurely stories. So doubtless many tales died out because immigrants or their children could not find a place for taletelling in their daily life. Carl Lindahl, in several publications, has indicated yet another reason why folktales go uncollected, calling them a “shy tradition.” In one essay he says that storytellers felt that “these tales, which served principally to entertain children in intimate family settings, were completely out of place in the formal company of strangers” (2001: 9). He goes on to refer to storyteller Jim Couch’s reluctance to share tales with outsiders: “We was all kindy skittish about strangers that way. We got the idea they wanted to know our family affairs, or make fun of us” (citing Roberts 1974: 7). Then he adds: In my own fieldwork, I have encountered several tellers who have shared Jim Couch’s sense of privacy regarding the magic tale. The intimate, family-based, child-targeted nature of the Appalachian Märchen makes it difficult for most narrators to retell it to adult outsiders. Even willing tellers tend to render the tales only as plot abstracts unless or until children are present, and only then will they actually perform the tales. Ballads, on the other hand, generally are considered more appropriate as public and adult entertainment. (10)\n\n11\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam Elsewhere Lindahl discusses the issue of a “clash between Märchen and mountain aesthetics” (and mores) characterized by “a strong tendency to call attention away from one’s art.” But the verbal art of the märchen, he asserts, calls attention to itself and cannot hide, so narrators tend to reshape the tale into a joke, legend, or tall story instead (2001: 89–90). This comment suggests a further reason why narrators who do tell märchen as märchen might wish to avoid performing them for strangers, lest they give the appearance of showing off. Although Lindahl is speaking specifically of the southern mountains, much of what he says may well apply more widely. Finally, I suspect that one important strain of the märchen tradition in America is the one-story tradition. It is not uncommon for a significant person in a family to have one tale, and one tale only, that is “their story.” On special occasions, or upon special demand, they will perform it for children in the family. Emma Neuland’s story in chapter 14 and Jim Hickey’s story in chapter 16 are just such stories, as is the story of “Peazy and Beanzy” in chapter 11. And I have heard others at times when I was not in a position to make a recording. I believe this family tradition is relatively widespread in the United States. But seldom does anybody outside the family know about such a tale. And more seldom is there a folklorist lurking about who can collect the tale, even if the storyteller should be willing to perform it for a recorder. As a result of all these factors, the picture of the old-world folktale repertoire in America is uneven and incomplete, and must ever remain so.\n\nAmer i c an Ta l e s It was once common to question whether one could even speak of a properly American folklore, apart from Native American tradition, because so many of us who make up the country derive from other parts of the world and our traditions too derive from traditions found in other parts of the world. But after five hundred years on the continent and two hundred years under the Constitution there is no longer any question that we are a distinct and distinctive people with a distinct and distinctive set of customs, traditions, mores, and folkways not shared by the visitor to our shores, and not yet wholly shared or even wholly understood by the new immigrant. The new immigrant may indeed come bearing some cultural element—a word, a custom, a fashion, or a food—that will eventually become as American as frankfurters, pizza, tacos, and fried-rice-to-go. Eventually, but not yet. The distinction is important. Not everybody in America is an American, nor is everything in America American. What is true of people and words and foods and customs\n\n12\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam is also true of tales. In the last fifty years American folklorists have gathered outstanding collections of folktales from immigrant narrators. One thinks of the Armenian tales Susie Hoogasian-Villa collected in Detroit (1966), or the Italian stories of Clementia Todescu (Mathias 1985). But these are Armenian and Italian stories, happily gathered from immigrants in Michigan or Arizona when they might not so easily have been gathered in the old homeland, but Italian and Armenian still. Though gathered in America, they are not American stories, except perhaps in some accidental sense. The present collection, however, seeking to present tales that are distinctively American, focuses on storytellers whose families had already been on this continent for generations at the time each particular tale was collected. This focus meant the exclusion of beautiful immigrant tales, tales that I folded away in my files with many a wistful sigh. But it also meant the inclusion of tales that beautifully express the American experience just as surely as they reveal their old-world roots. We all know, nevertheless, that there is more than one way to become American. Not every good citizen is born here. The same proved true of tales. Not every good American tale came from someone born here. Immigrants have not limited themselves to nostalgically retelling the tales of the homeland as faithfully as possible. They have also used tales to adapt to the new. And these adaptive tales, expressing the American experience of the immigrant whether ruefully, opportunistically, or enthusiastically, are also American tales. The anthology includes a representative sampling: tales turned into jokes on the immigrant’s plight, tales used to enhance the livelihood available in lumber camps, and a tale that expresses wonder at the role of the businessman in our culture. For such tales could not have surfaced any place else but in America.\n\nA m e r i c a n Fol k ta l e S c hol a r s h i p The study of folklore concerns itself with the informal, traditional, everyday, homemade aspects of life. It is not specifically concerned with what we study in school and the university or as part of our training in a profession. Nor is it really concerned with the media and the products and jobs of our technological society. It concerns itself, rather, with what we learn in immediate face-to-face contact with other people—parents, peers, friends—and with what we do in informal moments of our life, whether amusing ourselves and others or working at traditional trades or crafts. So folklorists are interested in handed-down skills, family recipes, home-grown beliefs, local language,\n\n13\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam homemade music and games, and the beliefs, recipes, language, music, and games of all sorts of groups, such as students, workers, teams, neighborhoods, and congregations. The stories that people tell as part of their family or other group are especially important to create group cohesion and preserve the group’s traditions. And folklorists study these stories—these folk tales—too. Though perceived as the Cinderella of American folklore studies, the folktale has in fact attracted distinguished scholarship in the United States. The 1880 publication of Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings is as convenient a place as any to begin such a survey. Harris’s book was a sensation and demonstrated to the world that the United States had a vital folktale tradition. When William Wells Newell undertook editorship of the Journal of American Folklore in 1888 for the newly organized American Folklore Society, he made discovery of American folktales one of his publication priorities. Beginning with the first issue, the early volumes were full of tales, especially from Native Americans, Louisiana French, and Americans of English ancestry. The first four decades of the twentieth century saw outstanding field collections formed from Puerto Rico (Mason and Espinosa 1922–1929), the Schoharie Hills of New York (Gardner 1937), the Cape Verdeans of Rhode Island (Parsons 1923a), the Sea Islands of South Carolina (Parsons 1923b), Florida (Hurston 1935), the Louisiana and Missouri French (Claudel 1941, 1942, 1944, and Carriere 1937), and the Southwest (Espinosa 1937 and Rael [1957]), among many others. In the 1930s, to combat the Great Depression, the Roosevelt administration organized employment for writers in the form of state writers’ projects. These projects regularly made gathering folklore a part of their agenda. It was while working on such a project that Richard Chase discovered the Jack Tale repertoire of Marshall Ward and his Hicks and Harmon cousins in the Beech Mountain area of North Carolina (Chase 1943). Meanwhile, folklorist Stith Thompson was analyzing American Indian repertoires to discover to what extent European folktales had infiltrated them. When Antti Aarne’s great 1910 folktale index needed to be revised and translated into English, Thompson seemed the logical man for the job. He published a translation and modest revision in 1928, then undertook a major revision in 1935 that was not finally completed until 1960. (A further revision was published in 2004.) Thompson also completed a massive six-volume index of traditional motifs as found in European and world folk literature and literature with folk roots. These motifs are numbered according to a complex system, and prominent motifs are frequently referred to by number in discussing folktales. Thompson synthesized his vast knowledge in The Folktale, a 1946 handbook that is still a standard on the subject.\n\n14\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam In the years after World War II the interest among American folklorists shifted from wonder tales and their kin to tall tales, jokes, and most recently legends. But collectors such as Vance Randolph in the Ozarks and Leonard Roberts in Appalachia resisted the trend. Richard Dorson collected significant numbers of tales in Michigan and Arkansas (1952, 1967). The time was ripe, too, for Francis Lee Utley to produce a magisterial article synthesizing New World folktale scholarship (1974). Subsequently, Herbert Halpert, who had begun by collecting tales on the East coast and annotating Randolph’s Ozark collections, went on to do a monumental collection in Newfoundland with J. D. A. Widdowson (1996). This collection in its published form sets a high standard for all future folktale scholarship. A revival of storytelling that came in on the crest of the folksong revival of the 1960s forced a reappraisal of the European folktale repertoire in the United States.4 This reappraisal expressed itself in Margaret Read MacDonald’s encyclopedic Traditional Storytelling Today. The long years of collecting in the United States are especially well represented in Carl Lindahl’s American Folktales from the Collections of the Library of Congress. Other important collections are Storytellers: Folktales and Legends from the South by Burrison; Swapping Stories, a Louisiana collection by Lindahl, Owens, and Harvison; Cajun and Creole Folktales by Ancelet; and my own Jack in Two Worlds. Lindahl’s volume, however, represents only one archive, while the last four collections tend to focus on the South, long perceived as the most folkloric part of the United States—a perception that even we folklorists are not entirely immune to. The present volume, by contrast, seeks to present the whole picture of folktale telling in the United States, insofar as that is possible (though the South still receives more attention than any other part of the country). By surveying the many collections made over the last two centuries, it provides an overview of scholarship as well as of tradition.\n\nEdi t or i al Pr i nci pl e s Many editors of folktale collections, from Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm to such recent authors as Virginia Hamilton and Richard Erdoes, have rewritten the tales so that they appear in the words of the author/editor, not in the words of the original storyteller. In such translation from one linguistic register to another something of the original storyteller must inevitably be lost along with his or her words, and something of the editor/author’s world must inevitably creep in. To keep the tales as told, not as reimagined by the editor, this collection presents each narrative in the words of the original storyteller,\n\n15\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam as far as that can be determined. Not all storytellers are smooth and slick, of course, so some tales will seem more rough-hewn than we are used to. But the gain in immediacy surely compensates for any loss in fluidity. Presenting the original storyteller’s words faithfully is fairly straightforward in the case of a storyteller who created a recording on audio tape, or even better on video tape. In such a case the editor sets down the words as heard. Of course even then things are not entirely straightforward. Words can be ambiguous or hard to distinguish. And the division into sentences and larger units is still largely a matter of the editor’s discretion, as is the decision about how many of the inevitable slips of the tongue, self-corrections, and ers and uhs to include. (I have included rather more than some editors would, but not everything.) In the case of publications based on oral recordings I went back when possible to the original recording and compared the published version to the recording, making corrections when I was able to catch something that eluded the original transcriber. It must be added that every transcriber misses things, as I was reminded every time I re-listened to a tape; for each time I caught further things that I had missed on previous passes through the material. In the case of tales for which we do not have a recording but have the original field transcription, it is often possible to revise the printed version to accord more closely with the transcription. In the case of Richard Dorson’s Upper Peninsula Michigan tales, for instance, he sometimes smoothed the narrative considerably if he was editing it for a more popular as opposed to a more scholarly publication (1952). Consulting his original field notebooks has enabled me to present tales more nearly in the storyteller’s exact words insofar as Dorson set them down accurately. For many tales, however, we have only the published version, and must rest content with that. The tale as published may have derived from an oral recording or from dictation more or less skillfully set down. In such cases we can be sure of being more or less close to the original words of the storyteller. But in the case of many earlier texts, the tale was set down from memory after the storyteller finished. Since early collectors often tended to focus on the plot rather than on the narrative style, such records may be only distant echoes. In some cases, too, the collector set down the tale long years afterward, making it even less likely that the text has captured the style and words of the earlier storyteller. If, however, the storyteller was a favorite family servant or favorite relative, the story was somewhat formulaic, and the childthat-was loved the storyteller and the way of the telling as well as the plot, in such a case there is hope that much of the original performance may be preserved, even in a record not made until many years after.\n\n16\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam So, in the tales of our book we are never in direct contact with the speaking voice of the storyteller. There is always some level of mediation. But I have striven to present the record as faithfully as it has been preserved and never to falsify whatever echo of the original voice may yet be preserved. But just as a photographer can enhance an old and faded photograph, enabling us to see without falsification what is there but formerly not clear, so the editor can enhance the presentation of the tale on the page, enabling us to hear it more clearly than before. The first and most obvious enhancement has already been mentioned, namely correction. When the printed text disagrees with the recording or the manuscript, I have accorded priority to the recording or manuscript. I have further sought to enhance the text by exercising editorial discretion on the matters that go beyond the determination of which words to print. Many of these tales were first published in journals that crammed everything into as small a space on the page as possible and did not use the ordinary conventions of paragraphing and quotation marking. The result is texts that are unnecessarily hard to read. Current publishing practice has rediscovered the virtues of white space for enhancing comprehension, and I have tried to follow those contemporary conventions as far as possible. Words of speakers stand in quotation marks. Paragraphing is frequent, marking the movement of the tale as well as indicating shifts in speaker. Indentations mark verse clearly. Abbreviations are spelled out. Et ceteras are expanded into full formulaic phrases or narrative units. Odd spellings are standardized. And when storytellers make slips of the tongue, or make references that were probably quite clear to a listener but are not so clear to the reader—a loose he, for instance, whose referent is not immediately clear—in such cases explanatory words in brackets clarify. In the case of tales presented in Gullah or other African American dialects, the issue of spelling requires special care. When the transcription inspired confidence I did not tamper with the orthography. Nor did I try to regularize grammar in any case. But when the spelling seemed to be strictly eyespelling, intended to indicate black dialect by calling on the conventions of the minstrel stage or comic strip, I did venture to regularize. I saw no reason to print cawze, for example, when ’cause would do just as well and indicate just as clearly how the word was probably pronounced. In the case of other dialectical pronunciations I tried to retain essential nonstandard spellings, but only those. Often there seemed no particular reason to print walkin’ or taIkin’ as if there were something extraordinary or idiosyncratic in such pronunciations: in point of fact most Americans truncate those words in casual conversation but feel no need to abbreviate the spelling to so indicate. When,\n\n17\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam however, a specialized spelling truly helps to capture specialized pronunciation or rhythm, it is entirely appropriate. The range of language used in the United State is very broad. These editorial conventions help bridge the gap between ethnic or regional dialects and more widespread or standard practice. When the original language is French, Spanish, or a Creole, however, no amount of fancy editorial footwork will do the job. Translation becomes essential. (Indeed, translation was even essential for one Gullah tale.) Some of the translations are my own, some were done by colleagues at my request, and some were done by the original editors or collectors. In the case of previously published translations I have edited as I did English-language tales. This editing has on occasion extended to revision of a translation for accuracy or readability. So I must accept responsibility for any infelicities in the translations as they here appear. There is a further editorial step that I chose not to take, although I took it in an earlier folktale book, Jack in Two Worlds (McCarthy, Oxford, and Sobol 1994). The present volume does not include any tales printed to represent an ethnopoetic analysis. In much oral tradition, including at least some folktale telling in the United States, the language falls into rhythmic or sense units that are clearly units of composition analogous to the lines, stanzas, and so on that occur in conventional poetry and song. We might call this use of language ethnopoetry. It is not a universal phenomenon. Of the tales included in Jack in Two Worlds, the six collected from southern mountain storytellers all exhibited the phenomenon: all were composed in ethnopoetry, no matter the education level of the storyteller (three were educators and one had a Ph.D.). The remaining two stories, however, one from a Pennsylvania educator and one from a Toronto performer, did not. They were clearly told in prose, the only discernible rhythmic or sense units corresponding to the grammatical units of the sentences. Currently there are two main but mutually exclusive systems for ethnopoetic analysis. Each type of analysis is valuable. But each provides different information. Simplistically put, that developed by Dennis Tedlock looks at rhythmic units, identified by pause (sometimes emphasized by a rising inflection), and isolates the poetic beat of the piece (1983). That developed and used by Dell and Virginia Hymes looks at sense units organized into lines, stanzas, scenes, and acts, and articulates the overall structure of the piece (2003). Sense lines and rhythmic sound lines do not always correspond, however. Consequently there is a kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy at work here that makes it impossible to carry out the two types of analysis simultaneously: with rare exceptions, the more we determine the Tedlockian sound units, the less we can determine the Hymesian sense units, and vice\n\n18\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam versa. One can represent the rhythmic lines or the sense lines, but not both. Only a small percentage of the texts in the present collection, moreover, are suitable candidates for ethnopoetic analysis. To do a proper Hymesian analysis one must have an exact transcription of the story, just as the storyteller told it. But many of the tales in the present volume have been set down from memory, or written down by the storyteller rather than dictated, or in other ways distorted, as indicated above, so that we have lost the careful structure, phrase by phrase, of the master storyteller. To do a proper Tedlockian analysis one must have something even rarer, an audio recording. Without such a recording there is no way to know when the storyteller took rhythmic pauses. But the majority of the stories in the present book were set down without the benefit of audio recording. Finally, such analysis requires a great amount of space and time, more of each than I have at my disposal if this volume is ever to appear. So, while I am excited by the possibilities of these two complementary modes of analysis, the tales are here presented unanalyzed. The reader will, however, find indentations and verse lines occasionally in the following tales. Sometimes a tale includes clear examples of verse, as in cante fables and riddle tales. Sometimes formulaic language and runs are easier to spot if printed as verse. And sometimes the language approaches verse in other ways. My aim is ever to make the tales more readable.\n\nPre sentat i on of Ta l e s Each tale appears with a title at the beginning and a note at the end. And each tale is cited in the index of tale types at the back of the volume. The titles are usually those that I found with the stories. Sometimes they were the titles given by the storyteller, and sometimes they were supplied by the original collector or editor. Occasionally, when the title was too misleading and there was no evidence that it came from the storyteller, I have substituted what I hope is a more appropriate title. It is customary to put the notes at the head of the story. But I as a reader am usually impatient to get to the story, which certainly has primacy over anything a scholar might have to say about it. Halpert and Widdowson, in the Newfoundland collection referred to above, provide brief formulaic headnotes but reserve discussion for what might be called tailnotes. I have decided to go further and move all commentary to the tailnote of each story. These tailnotes contain the following information, in this order. 1. Source for the story. Usually this is simply a last name and a page number, referring to an item in the bibliography.\n\n19\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam 2. ATU number. This is the number assigned to stories of the type in question (i.e., stories that have that particular basic plot) in The Types of International Folktales (ATU, 2004), which uses a classification system first conceived by Antti Aarne, translated, revised, and expanded by Stith Thompson, and recently updated by a group of folktale scholars under the direction of Hans-Jörg Uther. Aarne, Thompson, and Uther are the A, the T, and the U of ATU. Most European folktales have been indexed in The Types of International Folktales. For example, Jack and the Beanstalk is ATU 328, and The House That Jack Built is ATU 2035. Many tales, however, are rather complex and have subtypes. For instance, the more familiar Cinderella story, with the two stepsisters, is ATU 510A, but the English Cinderella story that is called Rushen Coatie, which often includes the heroine’s flight to escape incest, is ATU 510B. Similarly, the familiar Hansel and Gretel story is ATU 327A, but there are versions with other kinds of human flesh-eaters, other ways of escaping, and one or three children instead of two. And the popular tale of Beauty and the Beast is ATU 425C, while the classical tale of Cupid and Psyche is ATU 425B and the related Norwegian folktale East of the Sun and West of the Moon is ATU 425A. Not every tale gets a simple ATU number, however. The ATU classification has been supplemented by special indexes for particular tale repertoires. For our purposes the Irish index by Ó Súilleabháin and Christiansen (1963), the Hispanic index by Hansen (1957), and the English and North American index by Baughman (1966) are most helpful, and, in a few cases, tales are identified by Ó Súilleabháin and Christiansen, Hansen, or Baughman tale type numbers, rather than by ATU numbers. In two cases, the older number from the Aarne-Thompson classification (AT) is given along with the new number from ATU. Finally, in a few cases, a whole tale has been built up around a single simple motif. In such cases the Thompson motif number is assigned to the tale. It is fairly common, moreover, for a particular tale to be a complex amalgam of tale types, sometimes with stray motifs added in. In such cases I have assigned what seem the most pertinent type and motif numbers. But I have not tried to identify all the motifs contained in the many tales here included—an endless task. Nor have I analyzed particular tales into their main motifs as Thompson and Uther did in The Types of International Folktales. The Aarne-Thompson-Uther Classification gives each tale type a generic name. Sometimes this is the name of a familiar tale or related group of tales (e.g., Cinderella and Peau d’Áne). Sometimes it describes broadly the action of the story (e.g., The Man on a Quest for His Lost Wife, or The Maiden in the Tower). The Uther revision has considerably improved these titles. Like\n\n20\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam Halpert and Widdowson, however, I have not employed them in the notes. They are not always appropriate as descriptors of the American versions of the tales in question. I have, however, included these Aarne-ThompsonUther titles in the index of tale types at the end of the volume, where the curious reader can check them out. This index of tale types, though it covers only tales included in this volume and not all the tales that have been current in American oral tradition, will help the reader appreciate the wide range of tales that Americans know and tell. It will also enable the reader to find alternate developments of tale types that may be of interest. For several very common tale types, such as ATU 313 (The Magic Flight; The Devil’s Daughter), ATU 327 (The Children and the Ogre; Hansel and Gretel), ATU 480 (The Two Sisters), and ATU 720 (The Juniper Tree), I have included a number of versions from different traditions. By comparing these versions the reader can easily see the variation possible even within a single tale type as well as see how regional and ethnic traditions differ characteristically, even in their treatment of identical plot lines. For more on tale types, see the appendix, “Studying American Folktales,” in this volume. 3. After supplying the source for the text and the appropriate tale type (or motif ) number, the notes go on to identify the storyteller who provided this version of the tale. Ideally, there would be a great deal of information about storytellers, including how old they were, how many such tales they knew and told, whom they learned them from, how they understood the tale, and what value they put on it. But until sometime in the last half century or so most collectors did not think of asking for information of this sort. Prior to that, collectors tended to focus on the story itself and its affinities in the wider tale repertoire. So we often do not even know the storyteller or when they told the story. 4. Fortunately, information about the collector is usually available, even in the case of quite early texts. This information comes next in each note, followed by information about the circumstances of collection. Sometimes that information is quite detailed, in which case the note will be rather longer. The name of the translator, when required, is provided after the name of the collector or before the name of the storyteller, as is most convenient in each case. 5. The note may go on to comment upon unusual aspects of the story, the place of the story in the local or broader American repertoire, or other versions of the tale that are included in the present volume. The notes do not, however, provide exhaustive comparative and historical data or guidance to scholarship about the tale. Readers who are interested in learning more about\n\n21\n\nYarns Older than Uncle Sam American or world folktale scholarship may turn to the appendix, “Studying American Folktales,” at the end of this volume. Each note tries to cover this ground as adequately as the surviving data allows. In most cases, however, the contextual data is inadequate. To compensate a little for this inadequacy I have included as a final chapter a story embellished with full discussion of the storyteller, the collector, the circumstances of the collection, salient points about the story, and photographs. This chapter will serve as a demonstration of what would be ideal if we were not constrained by issues of history, contingency, space, time, and economics. I am grateful to colleague Jim Leary of the University of Wisconsin, who collected the tale, took the pictures, and wrote the essay. In compiling this anthology my aim has been three-fold. First I hoped to provide teachers, students, and families with a handy sampling of our rich folktale heritage. Then I hoped to equip scholars with a convenient book to consult and place on their shelves alongside the parallel collections from Norway, Russia, France, Spain, and all across the European world. And finally I wanted to present naysayers with irrefutable refutation of their argument that the wonder tale and its kin put down no lasting roots in America. I have nourished the collection and watched it develop and take shape for more than a decade. And like a healthy child, in that decade it has grown from a scrawny thing, little more than a gleam in my eye, to a stout and substantial parcel quite able, as I hope, to stand on its own two feet and fight its own battles in the schoolyard of the world. And I, ever the anxious father, pray as it goes forth that it will fulfill my fond hopes for it.

See below and chapter 17. 3. One of the oldest wonder tales we have is an example of just that phenomenon. The Deuterocanonical (Apocryphal) Book of Tobit is a version of ATU 505–7, the Grateful Dead Man complex of tales. Indeed, it seems to be the oldest known example of a tale from that complex. The tale was probably adapted by a Jew or Jews living in the Indo-European Persian Empire. In the Book of Tobit it has been well Semitized. The Indo-European ghost has become a Semitic angel, for example, and the details of the burial reflect Jewish burial customs. Nevertheless, the Indo-European cultural background still shows through, most clearly in the pet dog of the young hero. Treating dogs as pets is a fundamental Indo-European cultural trait, but one not shared by ancient Semitic peoples. 4. For a rich account of the Storytelling Revival, see Sobel 1999.\n\n23\n\nPart I The Ear ly Record\n\nCha p t e r 1\n\nTal e s f r om a N e w R e p u b l i c When the first settlers came to the eastern part of the New World from England, Scotland, Ireland, France, and the German-speaking states of Europe, we can be sure that they brought with them their wonder tales to soothe children and intrigue adults. These Americans of European extraction exchanged tales around the home fire, or in taverns, at markets, and wherever two or three gathered. But, so far as we know, there was no field collector in those early years going around the different communities to hunt out the great storytellers and persuade them to dictate their stories for posterity (though there were already people setting down Native American tales, including tales of European extraction; see chapter 17). So we must work indirectly to get some idea of American storytelling in those early years. To reach that goal there are really two routes we can follow. First, knowing that people tend to retell the good stories that they read, especially in an environment in which reading matter is at a premium, we can look at the folktales that surfaced in the popular press of the period, that is, in almanacs and chapbooks and on broadsides. Second, recognizing that people remember good stories for a very long time, we can look at certain tales set down in the waning years of the nineteenth century: Elderly people who heard tales in their pre–Civil War childhood from grandparents, aunts, and uncles who in turn had heard them in the waning years of the eighteenth century, did make some record of those tales. From these two sources we can partially reconstruct the content and even the context of storytelling on the East Coast, on the frontier, and in the Old Northwest Territory—north of the Ohio and west of the Alleghenies—in the first decades of the United States.\n\n27\n\nThe Early Record In those early years of the American Republic printers put out one-page broadsides and small chapbooks and almanacs that included tales of various kinds. Almanacs were the standard calendars of early America, and so in constant demand. In addition to providing a list of days, they indicated phases of the moon and other astrological information helpful to those who planted by the signs or otherwise directed their life by such considerations, as well as various other types of information such as commemorations, court days, tables of coinage, and bits of legal, economic, and medical wisdom. The layout of an almanac usually left room for filler, frequently historical or humorous. Brief folktales served the purpose, and printers reprinted stories from each other or from English (or German) sources (see Stitt and Dodge 1991). Many of the stories they reprinted were the sort that also passed easily back and forth when folk met at the crossroad, emporium, tavern, or hearth. This chapter begins with the sort of tales that provided humorous filler for almanacs. Like almanacs, chapbooks and broadsides also sold well in the early United States. Versions of Jack the Giant Killer were especially popular, as were two variants of the Cinderella story, Catskin and The Golden Bull (or Horse), both versified. This chapter includes a version of Catskin apparently copied out from a garland, as chapbooks of verse were sometimes called. This particular garland may have been printed in England or Scotland, but a copy was carried into Kentucky in the 1790s, where a young woman admired it and entered it by hand, word for word, into her commonplace book. Chapbook tales also circulated by word of mouth, thus entering oral tradition. In the early twentieth century, Catskins showed up in the repertoires of Jane Hicks Gentry of Hot Springs, North Carolina, and Sam Harmon, of Cades Cove, Tennessee, and The Golden Bull in the repertoire of Jane Buell of Schoharie County, New York. So, while we do not have any field-collected tales from the United States before 1800, we do have almanac and chapbook versions of popular tales. From these we can extrapolate to arrive at a view of tales and taletelling in the United States in those early years. The memories of people who recorded their memories are the other main source for information about taletelling in the early days of the Republic. When the American Folklore Society was founded in 1888, William Wells Newell, the first editor of the Journal of American Folklore, considered it important to seek out and publish American versions of classic European tales. Most of the texts that came his way were “self-collected,” that is, the people who remembered the stories wrote them down themselves just as they had heard them—as nearly as they could remember—and then communicated them to Newell for publication in the Journal. Although the resultant texts were in a sense literary, the contributors sometimes valued the oral qualities\n\n28\n\nTales from a New Republic of the tales and made a successful effort to catch those qualities in their renditions. In some cases, too, they provided recollections of the storytellers, the style of narration, and the storytelling milieu. I have selected seven of these early tales as windows on American taletelling in New England and Ohio in the half century before the Civil War. Since six of them are in varying degrees formulaic, we can even hope that in these six at least we come correspondingly close to the very words of the early-nineteenth-century narrators. And all the tales except “The Forgetful Boy” have continued to be popular in one strand or another of American tradition. These tales from almanacs, chapbooks, and broadsides, and from the memories of people who had heard storytellers tell stories learned in the eighteenth century can help us understand how important stories were to people in the first years of the Republic. When we think about that chapbook carried across the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky where Polly Webb then painstakingly copied it out, we can get some idea of the importance people there and in all parts of the new Republic attached to those frail and modest bits of printing. It is not hard to imagine a father, returned from Worcester or Boston or Philadelphia at the turn of the year, drawing forth the new almanac to read to his family the witty tales spread among the calendrical pages. It is not hard to imagine his children rereading the tales and sharing them with their friends, whose fathers would in turn perhaps have brought back different almanacs or chapbooks, with different tales. Nor is it hard to imagine the delight on the Kentucky or Ohio frontier when a newcomer had arrived who was a born storyteller or who had some few thin pieces of fresh reading matter. New tales could be shared and reworked and combined with other remembered stories to fit the circumstances of daily life. Reverend Joseph Doddridge writes in the 1820s about his boyhood on the Virginia frontier some fifty years earlier: Dramatic narrations, chiefly concerning Jack and the Giant, furnished our young people with another source of amusement during their leisure hours. Many of those tales were lengthy, and embraced a considerable range of incident. Jack, always the hero of the story, after encountering many difficulties, and performing many great achievements, came off conqueror of the Giant. Many of these stories were tales of knight-errantry, in which case some captive virgin was released from captivity and restored to her lover. . . . They certainly have been handed from generation to generation from time immemorial. (Cited in Purdue 1987: 97)\n\nFor the early settlers, tales filled the hunger of the imagination. Whether drawn from memory or from almanacs and chapbooks, they were precious\n\n29\n\nThe Early Record commodities, shared and shared again from colony to colony, state to state, up and down the seaboard and across the mountains into the frontier.\n\n1. Clever Crispin and the Calf: A True Story A butcher who had purchased a calf sat out with it on a horse at a public house door, which a shoe-maker, remarkable for his drollery, observing, and knowing that the butcher had to pass through a wood, offered the landlord to steal the calf, provided he would treat him with sixpence worth of grog. The landlord agreed, and the shoe-maker set off and dropt one new shoe in the path near the middle of the wood and another near a quarter of a mile from it. The butcher saw the shoe but did not think it worth getting down for. However, when he discovered the second he thought the pair an acquisition and accordingly dismounted, tied his horse to the hedge, and walked back to where he had seen the first shoe. The shoe-maker in the meantime unstrapped the calf and carried it across the fields to the landlord, who put it in his barn. The butcher, missing his calf, went back to the inn and told his misfortune, at the same time observing that he must have another calf, cost what it would, as the veal was bespoke. The landlord told him he had a calf in the barn which he would sell him. The butcher looked at it and asked the price. The landlord replied, “Give me the same as you did for the calf you lost, as I think it is full as large.” The butcher would by no means allow the calf to be as good, but agreed to give him within six shillings of what the other cost, and accordingly put the calf a second time on his horse. Crispin, elated with his success, undertook to steal the calf again for another sixpenny worth; which being agreed on, he posted to the woods and hid himself; where, observing the butcher come along, he bellowed so like a calf that the butcher, conceiving it to be the one he had lost, cried out in joy, “Ah! are you there! Have I found you at last!” and immediately dismounted and ran into the woods. Crispin, taking the advantage of the butcher’s absence, entrapped the calf and actually got back to the tavern before the butcher arrived to tell his mournful tale, who attributed the whole to witchcraft. The tavern keeper unraveled the mystery, and the butcher, after paying for and partaking of a crown’s worth of punch, laughed heartily at the joke. And the shoe-maker got applauded for his ingenuity. Evans 26569, The Virginia Almanack for the Year of Our Lord 1795. ATU 1525D. This particular “true story” was extremely popular with early almanac publishers, who often republished one another’s stuff. Stitt and Dodge (1991), in their index of tales occurring in almanacs, list\n\n30\n\nTales from a New Republic six occurrences in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The present version was placed immediately after a similar tale of a sharpster tricking three lawyers in succession out of substantial sums of money. The tale type is often called “The Master Thief,” and the classification into subtypes is based on the initial situation and the particular tricks the clever hero plays in order to steal the seemingly unstealable. The present version is probably English in origin, but the story is also popular in French and Spanish traditions in this country. In fact, variations on this story have proved among the most popular in American tradition. In recognition of that popularity the editor has given variants of 1525 pride of place as the first and last stories in this collection. As the title suggests, the incident was presented as having actually occurred. One almanac even includes the citation of the British newspaper whence the editor had obtained the tale, in a version verbally close to the present one. Folk tales that are presented as true or possibly true are called legends by folklorists. Legends frequently include ironic elements, as does the tale of Clever Crispin, and also assurances that the tale is verifiable, as does the alternate version that cites the English newspaper where the facts may be checked. The assurance that it is a true story moves this tale into the genre of legend, a fairly common move for märchen and märchen-like stories in North America. It is also worth noting that this clever shoemaker is named for St. Crispin, patron saint of cobblers and shoemakers. The Evans number before the name of the almanac in which this tale appears, above, is the number that Charles Evans assigned to that publication in his American Bibliography: A Chronological Dictionary of All Books, Pamphlets, and Periodical Publications Printed in the United States of America from the Genesis of Printing in 1639 Down to and Including the Year 1820.\n\n2. The Fortune Teller There lived a schoolmaster in a certain village, who formed a particular satisfaction in the study of astrology or the art of telling by the position of the stars things to come. His prophesying of the weather proved to be more true, in general, than what was commonly put down in the almanac; for which reason the villagers reported him to be a fortune-teller. The nobleman to whom the village belonged, hearing of the abilities of this schoolmaster, sent for him. The schoolmaster accordingly made his appearance one morning very early, before the nobleman was out of his bed. “I have been told,” said the nobleman, “that you pretend to be a fortune-teller.” The schoolmaster answered that he had never done the like, but as he was a lover of astrology, it so happened now and again that certain things came to pass as he, by the aspects, conjunctions, and influence of the heavenly bodies, had prognosticated. But the nobleman, who was an ignoramus, understood nothing of these words. “Hear me,” said the nobleman in a passion: “If you do not answer me four questions which I am going to ask, you shall be treated as an imposture. First, you are to tell me where the center of the earth is. Secondly, how much I am worth. Thirdly, what I think. And, fourthly, what I believe.”\n\n31\n\nThe Early Record The schoolmaster wanted to get clear of all this by telling the nobleman that it was God alone that was able to search the hearts of men and disclose their thoughts. But the nobleman insisted on having the above questions answered. The schoolmaster, seeing he could not disengage himself, requested the favour of having one day’s time allowed him that he might consult his books. This being granted, the schoolmaster made his respects, and departed. On his way home, he met a miller who lived in the same village. The miller, perceiving him to look much dejected, asked him what was the matter. The schoolmaster related all that had passed between the nobleman and himself. The miller laughed heartily at it, but at the same time promised that he would take the affair on himself. “For,” said he to the schoolmaster, “as you made your appearance before the nobleman in a dark bedchamber so early in the morning, it was impossible for him to take a strict observation of your face. As for me, he don’t know at all. It will therefore be very easy for me to represent your person after I have dressed myself in your clothes. As for his questions, I shall, no doubt, be able to answer them all completely.” The schoolmaster very willingly consented, as he knew the artful miller was better able to satisfy the demands of the nobleman than himself. Accordingly, the next morning the miller dressed himself in the schoolmaster’s clothes, and, with a cane in his hand, repaired to the nobleman’s house and let him know that the schoolmaster was come, in obedience to his orders, to answer his queries. The nobleman ordered him immediately before him, and asked him whether he really thought himself capable of answering his queries? The miller said he would stake his life for the performance. “Well,” said the nobleman, “where is the center of the earth?” “I will not only tell you,” said the miller, “but I will also show you the very spot, if you will follow me.” They both went therefore into the adjoining field, and after the miller had measured the ground for a while with his cane, he stuck it in the earth. “Here, Sir, is the very spot,” said the miller. “How will you prove that?” says the nobleman. “Have you it measured,” replied the miller, “and if it fails one inch, I will forfeit my life!” The nobleman knew it was out of his power to have it done. He therefore dropped that query, and came to the second, that is, how much he was worth. The miller answered, “Our Saviour was valued at thirty pieces of silver, and, he was undoubtedly worth more than you. I hope you will not take it amiss if I value you at twenty-nine pieces of silver.” “You are right, my friend,” says the nobleman. “But now let us hear if you can tell me what I think. I vow that will be somewhat heavier for you.”\n\n32\n\nTales from a New Republic “Not at all,” said the miller. “I would lay any wager that you think more on your own interest than on mine.” “That is very true,” says the nobleman. “But what say you to my fourth query? Do you know what I believe?” “O yes,” said the miller, “you believe that I am the schoolmaster. Is it not so?” “I certainly do,” said the nobleman. “But you are mistaken, Sir,” replied the other, “for I am the miller in the village.” So saying, he made a low bow to his honour, and departed. Evans 23264, The Columbian Almanac for 1792, and Evans 23363, Father Abraham’s Almanac for 1792. ATU 922. These two almanacs were both printed by the same Philadelphia printer, Peter Stewart. Though the first has thirty-six and the other forty pages, the central calendrical pages with their accompanying matter (such as this story) seem identical. Apparently the printer simply printed different sets of opening and closing pages for different clientele, while printing enough copies of the almanac proper to supply the two separate publications. This tale is the subject of a classic early folktale study, Kaiser und Abt, by Walter Anderson. The present version, lifted, no doubt, from an English almanac, illustrates one way that colonial-period Americans would have heard the tale. They might also have heard the ballad King John and the Bishop (Child 45), which tells the same story though obviously with different personnel. In later American tradition the story becomes a reverse numbskull story or joke featuring a pair of brothers or Irishmen, in which the duller of the pair is rescued by the brighter. Usually there are three, not four questions. The first, second, and fourth questions and respective answers in this text are found in many other variants as well. The third question and its answer are more unusual.\n\n3. The Three Wishes A poor man was asked what three things he would have, could he have them for the wishing? “Why, in the first place,” says he, “I would have as much good strong ale as I could drink.” “Very well, what next?” “Then I would have as much fat beef as I could eat.” “And what’s your third wish?” But now he was puzzled, for with him all happiness lay in fat beef and strong ale. At last, after much consideration, “Hang it,” says he, “I’ll have a little more ale still.” Evans 16167, Bickerstaff ’s New-England Almanack for 1779. ATU 1173A. It is fairly common in the U.S. tradition for a more formal tale to settle down as a simple joke. In the present version of ATU 1173A we can catch this process very early on, for this is a Colonial joke based on such\n\n33\n\nThe Early Record a tale. In that more formal tale a peasant makes a bargain with the devil to sell his soul if the devil can grant him three wishes. His wishes: that the devil bring him all the grog in the world, all the tobacco, and then more grog. Since there can not be more than all, the man wins his bet, retaining the grog and tobacco. Ironically the same third wish that in the tale demonstrates the cleverness of the peasant serves in the joke to illustrate the poor man’s simplicity and even his simple-mindedness.\n\n4. Catskin Cat skin’s Gar l and, Pa rt the First Ye fathers and mothers, and children also, Come draw near unto me, and soon you shall know The sense of my ditty, for I dare to say, The like han’t been printed this many a day. The subject which to you I am to relate, It is of a Squire’s son of a vast estate. And the first dear infant his wife to him bear, It was a young daughter of beauty most fair. He said to his wife, “Had this child been a boy ’Twould have pleased me better and increased my joy. If the next be of the same sort, I do declare Of what I’m possessed she shall have no share.” In twelve months time after, this woman we hear Had another daughter of beauty most clear, And when that her husband knew ’twas a female, Into a strong bitter passion he fell, Saying, “Since this is of the same sort as the first, In my habitation she shall not be nursed. Pray let it be sent into the country. For where I am, truly this child shall not be.” With tears his dear wife to him thus did say, “Husband, be contented, I’ll send her away.” Then unto the country with speed did it send For to be brought up with one who was a friend.\n\n34\n\nTales from a New Republic Although that her father hated her so, She good education on her did bestow.

And when unto stature this damsel was grown, And found by her father she had no love shown, She cried, “Before that I lie under this frown, I’m fully resolved to range the world round.”\n\nPart the Second But now, good people, the cream of the jest, In what sort of manner this creature was dressed: With cat skins she made for a robe I declare, The which for her cov’ring she daily did wear. Her new rich attire and jewels besides, Then up in a bundle by her they were tied. Now to seek her fortune, she wandered away. And when she had traveled a whole winter’s day, In the evening tide she came to a town. When at the knight’s door she then set her down For to rest herself, who was tired to be sure, This noble knight’s lady she came to the door. And, seeing this creature in such sort of dress, The lady unto her these words did express: “From whence cam’st thou, girl, and what will you have?” She cried, “A night’s quarters in your stable I crave.” The lady said to her, “I’ll grant thy desire. Come into the kitchen, and stand by the fire.” Then she thanked the lady, and went in with haste Where she was gazed on from biggest to least. And being well warmed, her hunger being great, They gave her a dish of good meat for to eat.\n\n35\n\nThe Early Record And then to an out-house this creature was led Where she with fresh straw then made her a bed. And when in the morning that daylight she saw, Her rich robes and jewels she hid in the straw, And being very cold, she then did retire To go to the kitchen and stand by the fire. The cook said, “My lady hath promised that thou Shall be as a scullion to wait on me now. What say’st thou, girl? Art thou willing to bide?” “With all my heart, truly,” to him she replied. To work with her needle she could very well, And for raising of paste few could her excel. She, being very handy, the cook’s heart did win. And then she was called by the name of Catskin.\n\nPart the Third This lady had a son both comely and tall Who oftentimes used to be at a ball. A mile out of town in an evening tide To see the ball acted away he did ride. Catskin said to his mother, “Madam, let me Go after your son, this fine ball for to see.” With that, in a passion this lady she grew, Struck her with a ladle, which she broke in two. And being thus served, she then went away And with a rich garment herself did array. Then to see this ball with great speed did retire, Where she danced so rarely all did her admire. The sport being done, the young Squire did say, “Young lady, where do you live, tell me I pray?” Her answer was unto him: “That I will tell: At the sign of the Broken Ladle I dwell.”\n\n36\n\nTales from a New Republic She, being very nimble, got home first, ’tis said, And with her catskin robes she soon was arrayed And into the kitchen again she did go, But where she had been none of them did know. Next day the young Squire, himself to content, To see the ball acted, away then he went. She said, “Pray let me go this ball for to see.” And then struck her with a skimmer and broke it in three. Then out of doors she ran with heaviness, And with her rich garments herself then did dress, And to see this ball she ran away with speed And to see her dancing all wondered indeed. The ball being ended, this young Squire then Said, “Where is’t you live?” She answered again, “Sir, because you ask me, an account I will give: At the sign of the Broken Skimmer I live.” Being dark, then she lost him, and homeward did hie, And with her catskin robe was dressed presently, And into the kitchen among them she went, But where she had been they were all innocent. When the Squire came home and found Catskin there He was in amaze, and began for to swear: “For two nights at this ball has been a lady, The sweetest of beauties that ever I did see. “She was the best dancer in all the whole place, And very much like our Catskin in the face. Had she not been dressed to that comely degree I’d sworn it had been Catskin bodily.” Next night to this ball he did go once more Then she asked his mother to go as before, And having a basin of water in hand She threw it at Catskin as I understand.\n\n37\n\nThe Early Record Shaking her wet ears, out of doors she did run, And dressed herself, when this thing she had done. To see this ball acted she then went her ways. To see her fine dancing, all gave her the praise. And having concluded, this young Squire he Said, “From whence come you, pray, lady, tell me?” Her answer was, “Sir, you shall soon know the same: From the sign of the Basin of Water I came.” So homeward she hurried as fast as might be. This young Squire he then was resolved to see Where to she belonged; then, following Catskin, Into an old straw house he saw her creep in. He said, “O, brave Catskin, I find it is thee These three nights together hath so charmed me. Thou art the sweetest creature my eyes e’er beheld. With joy and contentment my heart it is filled. “Thou art the cook’s scullion but, as I have life, Grant me but thy love, I’ll make thee my wife, And you shall have maids to be at your call.” “Sir, that cannot be. I have no portion at all.” “Thy beauty, my joy and my dear, I prize it fair better than thousands a year, And to have my friends consent, I have got a trick. I’ll go to my bed and feign myself sick. “There none shall attend me but thee, I protest. So one day or other, when in thy rich dress Thou shalt be dressed, if my parents come nigh, I’ll tell them ’tis for thee I’m sick and like to die.” Part the Fourth Having thus consulted, this couple partéd. Next day this Squire he took to his bed,\n\n38\n\nTales from a New Republic And when his dear parents this thing perceived, For fear of his death they were heartily grieved. To tend him they sent for a nurse presently. He said, “None but Catskin my nurse now shall be.” His parents said, “No, Son.” He said, “But she shall, Or else I shall have no nurse at all.” His parents both wondered to hear him say thus, That none but Catskin must needs be his nurse. So then his dear parents, their son to content, Up to the chamber poor Catskin they sent. Sweet cordials and other rich things were prepared, Which between this couple were equally shared. And when they were alone in each other’s arms Enjoyed one another in love’s pleasant charms. At length on a time, poor Catskin, ’tis said, In her rich attire she was arrayed. And when that his mother the chamber drew near Then much like a goddess Catskin did appear, Which caused her to startle, and thus for to say: “What young lady is this, Son, tell me I pray?” He said, “Why, ’tis Catskin, for whom sick I lie And without I have her, with speed I shall die.” His mother ran down then to tell the old knight, Who ran up to see this amazing great sight. He said, “Why, ’tis Catskin we hold in such scorn. I never saw a finer dame since I was born.” The old knight said to her, “I pray thee, tell me, From whence dost thou come, and of what family?” Then who were her parents she gave him to know, And what was the cause of her wandering so. The Squire cried, “If you will save my life, Pray grant this young creature she may be my wife.”\n\n39\n\nThe Early Record His father replied, “Thy life for to save, If you are agreed, my consent you shall have.” Next day with great triumph and joy as we hear There was many coaches both far and near. Then, much like a goddess dressed in rich array, Catskin to the Squire was married that day. For several days this great wedding did last. There were many a topping and gallant rich guest, And for joy the bells rang over the town, And bottles of canary trolled merrily round. When Catskin was married, her fame for to raise, To see her modest carriage, all gave her the praise. Thus her charming beauty the Squire did win, And who loves so great as he and Catskin!\n\nPart the Fif th Now in the fifth part I’ll endeavor to show How things with her parents and sister did go. Her mother and sister of life are bereft, And now all alone the old Squire he is left. And hearing his daughter was married so brave, He said, “In my noodle a fancy I have: Dressed like a poor man, a journey I’ll make And see if she on me some pity will take.” Then, dressed like a beggar, he went to her gate. There stood his daughter who appeared very great. He cried, “Noble lady, a poor man I be, And I am now forced to crave your charity.” With a blush she asked him from whence he came. With that he then told her, and gave her his hand. She cried, “I’m your daughter that you slighted so; Nevertheless, to you some kindness I’ll show.\n\n40\n\nTales from a New Republic “’Tis through mercy the Lord hath provided for me. Pray, Father, then come in and set down,” said she. Then the best provision the house could afford For to make him welcome was set on the board. She said, “You are welcome, feed heartily, I pray, And if you are willing, with me you shall stay So long as you live.” Then he made this reply: “I only am come, thy love for to try. “Through mercy, my child, I’m rich and not poor. I have gold and silver enough now in store, And for the love which at thy hand I have found For a portion I will give thee ten thousand pound.” So in a few days after, as I understand, This man he went home and sold off all his land, And ten thousand pounds to his daughter did give And then all together in love they did live. Webb 1797–1799. ATU 510B. From a manuscript commonplace book of Mary (Polly) Webb, Kentucky, 1797, in the possession of Duke University. ATU 510 is the broad number for the Cinderella family of stories, to which Catskin belongs. The word “garland” in the title probably indicates that Polly Webb copied the poem from a chapbook. In the original manuscript the words “Entered According to Order” are copied after the title. These words refer to the license required by British law, and indicate that the chapbook from which Webb copied was printed in England. According to dates in her commonplace book, Webb spread her copying over a little more than a week, completing her work on or about May 24, 1797. She filled out her commonplace book with other pieces in verse, mostly popular ballads. The tale is here presented as far as possible in modern spelling, including consistent spelling of the heroine’s name, and with a very few silent emendations (“Her answer was unto [rather than under] him,” for example), but metrical and syntactical irregularities that came from copying the verses out by hand have not been corrected. Joseph Jacobs, in More English Fairy Tales (241), points out one particularly provocative detail in this story. When the mother throws a basin of water at Catskin, the girl runs outside “shaking her wet ears.” One can’t help wondering whether this detail remains in the story from an earlier version in which the heroine was under enchantment and transformed bodily into a cat, not simply dressed in cat skins. Such relic details, incomprehensible without reference to an earlier recension, are not uncommon in folktales. Broadside and garland printings of Catskin were moderately popular in eighteenthcentury America as well as in England, and ATU 510B seems to have secured a firm position in Appalachian oral tradition, with some ten versions identified from Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina (Lindahl 2004: 340). In the 1920s Jane Gentry, of Hot Springs, North Carolina, told Isabel Gordon Carter a version that included the motif of the incestuous\n\n41\n\nThe Early Record father, a motif not found in this garland version (Carter 1925: 361–63; for more on Gentry, see chapter 13). Gentry’s cousin Sam Harmon, aided by Harmon’s granddaughter Alberta, also told a version for Herbert Halpert (Lindahl 2004: 40–42).\n\n5.
