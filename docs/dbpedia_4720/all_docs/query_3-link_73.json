        "text": "Author: Josh Malerma\n\nPublished: May 31, 2014 (US), March 27, 2014 (UK)\n\nPages: 260\n\nSpecial Features: none\n\nPrice: $19.99 (CAD)\n\nISBN: 978-0-06-235212-5\n\nMovie stars: Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes, Jacki Weaver, John Malkovich, Sarah Paulson, Rosa Salazar, Daniella Macdonald, Lil Rel Howery, Tom Hollander, Machine Gun Kelly, and B.D. Wong.\n\nBy now everyone and their Grandmother has heard of Bird Box. Or at least, The Bird Box Challenge. With all the commotion this movie has caused I figured why not finally read the book. Why not hop on this train, so once finished I can watch the movie, and see what’s it’s all about.\n\nFirst off, there’s nothing more frustrating than reading a book and later watching the movie adaptation of it. Expections are way too high, and you’re almost always setup for disappointment. In this case though, I don’t know where I stand, in the case of, which material did I like better? I want to keep this review spoiler free as much as I can for anyone who has yet to either read the book, or watch the movie.\n\nWhile reading the book, all I wanted was for the story to speed up. All I I wanted was to know what happened to all the housemates, because the book starts off with just Malorie and the children. This was the bit that kept me going. What happened to them? But when the time came, and the fate of the house was revealed, I was left feeling disappointed. With everything the housemates learned and overcame, the fact that they all met that fate just didn’t sit right with me. Especially when it came to Victor the dog being in the cellar. It just doesn’t feel right that no one thought to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves. The end just came so quick and swift. When I finally finished the book, I was underwhelmed. Which is way I’m conflicted when it comes to, which material wins? Book or movie?\n\nBird Box on Netflix was chaotic, and moved at a way too fast a pace. Obviously from book to movie, details will be left out and others added in to make the transition smoother. But I felt there were unnecessary changes that prevented the movie from having a nice flow. Characters back stories were left out, which made the household seem cold, and odd. A nice change from the book was the relationship between Tom and Malorie. Something I was actually rooting for in the book, and made the ending much more meaningful. But the movie seemed messy, and put together way too quickly. There wasn’t enough time to explain the characters, how they got there, and overall making the characters their own. You never got to know them. In the book they almost became their own unintentional family, whereas in the movie they are just a bunch of strangers who unfortunately are stuck together.\n\nSo which material triumphs? In this case, neither. They both lacked luster for me, and offered no excitement.\n\nWould I recommend Bird Box, book or movie? I would recommend watching the movie versus the book. The book is worth the read, but not if you plan on watching the movie afterwards, as you will most likely be left feeling disappointed. Where as watching the movie first and only, at least the ending will leave you with a little more satisfaction.\n\nTo me, the only appeal that Bird Box seems to draw is the wonder of people learning to live blindfolded from a mysterious monster that makes lose your sanity. And who wouldn’t be drawn to a story like that?\n\nBird Box rating: Book 2.5(3)/5 stars.\n\nTell me, have you seen or read Bird Box, and what are your thoughts?\n\nBird Box is available at:\n\nChapters\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nAnd Watch Now on Netflix.\n\nDirector: Ran Coogler\n\nCast: Chadwick Boseman, Michael B.Jordan, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong’o, Daniel Kaluuya, Letita Wright, Angela Bassett, Martin Freeman, Andy Serkis, Winston Duke\n\nRelease Date: February 16, 2018\n\nRunnin Time: 134 minutes\n\nWow. Just wow. Aside from breaking records at the box office, Black Panther opens the door even wider. Not only into Wakanda, but into the world of equality. Yes Black Panther is a politically heavy film, but not so in a way that has you feeling you’re at home watching the news in our living room, or squirming in your seat for the full 134 minute run. Black Panther brings a breath of fresh air to the discussion, and you’re nothing but captivated. It handles diversity, and equality in a sophisticated, age and time appropriate way. And this movie couldn’t have come at a better time.\n\nBlack Panther is powerful. It is humorous. It is captivating. It is brilliant.\n\nFinally a villain who has an actual purpose and reason for the things he’s done. Not that I would condone a villains evil acts. But how often have we seen a villain in a movie who wants to rule the world for nothing but just for the sake of ruling the world and being all powerful. To avoid spoilers, Erik Killmonger’s (Michael B. Jordan) actions are derived from a past altercation between his father and Wakanda’s King, that later motivates him to expose Wakanda to the rest of the world. Not only it’s existence, but the technology to create mass weaponry. Killmonger is the type of villain who we have yet to see in the MCU.\n\nThe technology in Wakanda is all created and developed by Shuri (Letitia Wright) T’Challa’s sister, otherwise known as the smartest person in the world. Who else wants to see Shuri and Tony Stark in the same room? It is rumoured that Letitia Wright is set to return for Avengers Infinity War, so perhaps the possiblity isn’t far off. However, as cool has vibranium based technology is, I couldn’t help but think; is it too perfect? And has much as I loved Shuri, she is a bit of a technology Mary Sue. But then again, in today’s movies, who isn’t? I know some people will hate that about her character, and I can understand not liking a character who can do all, let remember: Rey.\n\nNow as much as I loved Black Panther, the lack of action was little shocking. Don’t get me wrong, there are actions sequences but not as many as I was hoping, and what few there were, they weren’t long enough, and if you blinked they were gone. However there were two scenes in particular that stood out. The club scene and towards the end of the film. Wow. Again, avoiding spoilers, but Danai Gurira’s Okoye I think is the best character to come out of not only the club scene but the whole movie. I loved her, and I’m so happy she will be returning in Avengers Infinity War. Out of the entire MCU, and I have no problem saying this, she is probably the best fighter and is going to make a great addition.\n\nNow I wanted to keep this review spoiler free, but there are a few things that can’t be talked about without discussing portions of the film. So before I get into spoiler territory, should you see Black Panther? A thousand times yes. The time has come that we finally celebrate diversity, and embrace that an all black cast, a film with a black lead, a film that isn’t dominated by white cast is brought to the screen. That’s not to say that we can’t celebrate a movie that has a white lead, but Black Panther shows us that there is no excuse good enough to not cast either an African-American or any other person of color in a lead role for “fear” that it won’t do well or “people won’t relate” to it. Black Panther has broken recorsds in it’s short run. It is now the 5th highest grossing film of all time for it’s opening weekend, beating out Avengers: Age of Ultron, and falling just behind the first Avengers. That number is only counting the traditional 3 day weekend, as Black Panther did open on a 4 day holiday weekend. But if ou were to count the extra day, it would be the 4th night grossing opening weekend ever beating out both Avengers.\n\nOkay now for the spoilers. You’ve been warned.\n\nStill here?\n\nOkay, I think we were all wondering, will the soul stone appear in Black Panther? Sadly there was no reference to it in the movie, but I believe the stone is there in Wakanda. How? When the meteorite hit Wakanda, I think it brought the soul stone with it, and through it grew the heart herb that allows you inhabit the power of the black panther. Once you drank the herb you’re taken to the plain where the souls of the past panther reside. Souls? Soul stone? Makes sense that the stone is in Wakanda, and is probably near were the meteorite hit, and/or the source from which the herb grows. Another clue for the soul stone being in Wakanda, in the Infint War trailer, the war is brought to the country, so one could think Thanos knows the stone’s location and is trying to retrieve is.\n\nAnother act that raised some questions, when Killmonger was crowned king, he ordered all the heart flowers to be burned, (and Nakia was the only one to think to pocket one) leaving nothing left should a new king, or queen be crowned. While I understand the motives behind burning the garden, it was a mistake to not have someone else realize the importance of the herb and try to save has many as they could.\n\nSo while I think it was a misstep to not mention the soul stone, and destroying the garden, I think the number one mistake was letting Killmonger die. Yes, again I can understand why he wanted to die, and his reason was so powerful. I’m getting sick of seeing great villains rise, only to be killed off in the same movie. Killmonger would have made a great addition to the MCU. Possibly even an ally to Thanos. I hate seeing perfectl fine villains go to waste, when they have such potential and can add so much more.\n\nBut let me know what you think. Do you think they should’ve killed off Killmonger or let him live? What do you think of the political views that are in Black Panther? Do you think it should be so politically heavy or do you think they should’ve kept it more light, like the rest of the Marvel movies? And just in general what did you think of Black Panther, did you see it it’s opening weekend? Are you seeing it again this weekend?\n\nFollow me on:\n\nTwitter: Kat-Reviews @KaterinaShirley\n\nGoodreads: Katerina Shirley\n\nDirected by: Zack Snyder\n\nCast: Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, J.K Simmons\n\nSo after seeing Justice League tonight, it is absolutely clear, that the DCEU is terrible at story and world building. Granted it was still an enjoyable movie, however it needs work. I hate pitting DC against Marvel, but the truth is, is that Marvel does do a better job at committing you to their characters, and becoming invested in them. And a big thanks to that is the sole movies, something the DCEU lacks. That and so many reboots. Yes Sony has Spiderman which has been redone three times, but the Marvel story as a whole hasn’t been redone. Where has DC has redone Batman and his history too many times, you can’t get a foot in the door before you’re kicked out again.\n\nWhile I enjoyed Cyborg, and Barry Allen a.k.a The Flash (but that feeling died quick) I wouldn’t have been sad if they’d die, or were no longer apart of the team. There wasn’t enough to make me feel anything towards the character. Towards the end Cyborg grew on me, but not enough that I’m eagerly awaiting his movie, or to see him again in a team up. However, Ray Fisher did a tremendous job at playing the part, it’s just unfortunately he was thrown at us, and there was too much to take in, as the movie as a whole, to make me love his character.\n\nBarry Allen “Flash” was annoying, and I wanted him gone almost immediately. At first his corky jokes were fun, but the problem? They never stopped. Either it was the writing, or Ezra Miller trying to steal the show, and was putting in to much effort to be funny, it was just childish. He was the kind of annoying that you hoped something would happen to his character just to make the, boarding on obnoxious behaviour, stop. Especially the bat cave scene *insert intense eye roll here*.\n\nJason Momoa’s Aquaman ‘Arthur Curry”, I felt near the end was too much like Momoa himself, however I left the theatre eagerly awaiting to see his movie. Mainly because I have such faith in James Wong, and he’ll make sure the movie has what it needs, and rein in any behaviours, or creative choices that don’t belong in the film. And there was a nice little surprise, that we’ll be seeing more of the Aquaman’s feature film.\n\nBatman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman “Diane Prince” (Gal Gadot) were the best in the film. Nothing too much to really add on them, other then they were the ones to carry this film. However, there was a major problem with Wonder Woman, and it had everything to do with how she was treated in this film. The Wonder Woman film is 10X more cleverly written, and thought out, especially once you’ve seen this movie. Diane Prince was just boarding on solely being a sexual object to the men. There were two terrible jokes involving The Flash and Aquaman. While everyone gets the title of “strong”, “warrior”, Wonder Woman in not one of them. Even though when it comes down to it, she could easily take out every single member of the Justice League should she see fit. But she doesn’t, nor does she belittle anyone with degrading comments or actions the way Aquaman and Flash did. And after the success of Wonder Woman (which was written by Allan Heinberg, so being written by a man is no excuse to knowing how to write a female character, it just depends on the man writing it) there is no excuse for her to have been treated son poorly by not only for fellow team mates, but by the people behind the camera bring her to life. And the two men behind Justice League, Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon.\n\nThe villain, Steppenwolf and his parademons, were weak opponents. Again he was just thrown at us, and made to believe he this otherworld, unimaginably powerful foe, and yet when you meet him, he’s meh. His defeat was slightly pathetic, and considering how it happened, the group should have managed to bring him down sooner.\n\nOverall Rating: 3/5\n\nWould I recommend: Justice League is still an enjoyable movie, and I would definitely see it again, however it has many flaws. Flaws that I hope are fixed with the upcoming movies. One of the flaws being Joss Whedon not returning to the franchise.\n\nFollow me on:\n\nTwitter: Kat-Reviews (@KaterinaShirley)\n\nGoodreads: Katerina Shirley\n\nCast: Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Rilley, John Goodman, John Ortiz, Jign Tian, Terry Notary, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston\n\nWho needs actors when you have a visual effects team with this much talent. I could have watched a whole 2 hours of just Kong defending the island, and learning and seeing all the different creatures that live on this island. The visuals told a better story then the actors (except some, some of the actors were great). The emotions that they gave Kong made it so by the end of the film, you were rooting for him, and hoping he triumphed over the humans.\n\nBut the humans themselves weren’t all trouble, there were a few actors that actually served a purpose and who had a story/background that made sense. I’m looking at you Tom Hiddleston, I’m thinking he was just there for eye candy. Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), Randa (John Goodman), San Lin (Jing Tian), Houston (Corey Hawkins), Hank (John C. Rielly), and Glenn (Jason Mitchell) were either the real stars of the show, or at least the characters that actual served a purpose, even if they weren’t shown a whole lot. The main stand outs in the film were Jason Mitchell and Jonh C. Reilly, if anything this felt like their (and Kong’s) movie. Every time they were on screen they stole the show. Jackson and Goodman were the follow up scene stealers, and both ended up going down the same story path.\n\nBrie Larson and Tom Hiddleston played roles that could have very easily been absurd by another, and to a degree they were. Mason (Larson) is a photojournalist hired to document, through pictures, what they see on the island, while Conrad (Hiddleston) is a former British Air Service Captain, who now offers his (poor) tracking services. His role was so incredible pointless, I have no clue has to why they added him or his character. Randa paid Conrad to do the job that all the soldiers on the team were practically already doing. Mason was probably the worse photographer they could have hired. She was slow to take a photo, and didn’t take enough of them. Hiddleston’s character didn’t even need to be combined with another actors character because he already was, he was just an unnecessary addition to the cast who took up room. As for Larson’s character, she could have been combined with Jing Tian’s character, who is a biologist brought to study the land and it’s inhabitants.\n\nLarson and Hiddleston are the only down falls of the movie, and their obviously forced romance. Aside from the few actors that stole the show the visual effects and the action sequences are what made this movie. This film has a plethora of action scenes, and the movie opens with one that is the base for the whole film. The action was incredible, the design of Kong and all the creatures that live on Skull Island were beautifully crafted. The visual effects team did a fantasic job at creating and bring this creatures to life. I’d say they’re the best CGI, and original (except Kong) that I’ve seen in awhile.\n\nOverall Rating: 4/5 stars. Just try to ignore Laron and Hiddleston and the movie is perfect.\n\nDirector: James Mangold\n\nStarring: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen, Richard E. Grant, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant\n\nRelease Date: March 3, 2017\n\nRating: 18A (R)\n\nShould the X-men rights go back to Marvel? After the success of Deadpool, and now Logan, both being rated R, it seems FOX has found a formula that’s working for them. While Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, The Avengers and many other Marvel superhero films have been great, Deadpool and now Logan are at the top of my list of best Marvel movies, even though both are owned by FOX. While Marvel’s movies are a bit more lightweight, and not so dark, it seems the darker, grittier, and bloodier superhero movies FOX is now producing is where these superhero movies should be heading.\n\nLogan is by far, not only the best X-men movie, but probably the best superhero movie to date. After 17 years, we finally get to see what the Wolverine is really about. Hugh Jackman’s performance in Logan is his best performance has the Wolverine, and even though it would be nice to see more of r-rated Wolverine, the film is a perfect way to say goodbye to the character.\n\nBut not only are we saying goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Logan, but Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier a.k.a “Professor X”. After watching Stewart play such a calm, clean mounted character for so long, it was almost comical to see him cursing Logan when the time seemed fit. But just like Jackman, this is a strong performance for Stewart as the telepathic mutant.\n\nX-23 a.k.a Laura played by Dafne Keen not only sold you on her action sequences, but she could probably give Black Widow a run for her money.\n\nThere wasn’t a moment in this movie where it gave you a chance to sit down and relax. From the moment of the first fight, the movie never let up. Just when you thought you could have a breather, something else would happen and through the characters into another whirlwind.\n\nWhile it would be nice to see Marvel recieve all the rights to all their characters again, with the path that FOX seems to now be following, maybe now isn’t the best time for Marvel to get the X-men back. Not only that, but if they ever did and decided to reboot the X-men and recast Logan “Wolverine”, especially after this performance, they won’t be able to find someone to replace or even come close in comparison to Hugh Jackman.\n\nMy rating: 5/5 stars. A definite must see film.\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nStarring: Lily James, Richard Madden, Cate Blanchett, Stellat Skarsgard, Helena Bonham Carter, Nonso Anozie, Holliday Grainger, Sophie McShera, Derek Jacobi, Hayley Atwell, Ben Chaplin\n\nDistributor: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\nRunning Time: 105 minutes\n\nGenre: American, Romantic-Fantasy\n\nRelease Date: March 13, 2015\n\nThis movie was absolutely stunning to watch. The visuals were beautiful, and so captivating. I could watch Cinderella over, and over again just for that reason alone. Particular favorites of mine were Cinderella’s (Lily James) transformation, from her ripped up pink dress, to the sparkling blue princess ball gown. Also the transformation of the pumpkin into the carriage, the mice into the horses, the goose into the Coach man, and the lizards into the horsemen. It was all breathtaking, and everything else in the movie didn’t compare. Except for maybe Cate Blanchett, who played the evil Stepmother. But then again, whenever Cate Blanchett is anywhere near a scene, she takes the spotlight.\n\nLily James was a great Cinderella, though I thought at times she was too quiet, and soft spoken. This might be the way Disney wants their princesses to be, because this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a quiet, and barely audible princess. Aurora from Maleficent, played by Elle Fanning, was very soft spoken (and British/English speaking), and judging by the Beauty and the Beast trailer, though there was barely any dialogue there to judge, Belle will also be quiet, and light in voice (also with a British accent). What’s with soft, British speaking princesses?\n\nCate Blanchett can never do any wrong, and the case is the same for her when she plays a villain. She played an excellent Stepmother, and she had a few funny moments. The ever so caring mother, who just wants to best for her daughters, is also aware of how dim witted they are, and just how untalented.\n\nHolliday Grainger, and Sophie McShera did a wonderful job at playing the dim witted, and childish step sisters, Anastasia, and Drizella. Richard Madden, was an okay Prince Kit, though I wasn’t particularly wowed. Maybe because Blanchett, and the visuals were so on point, I couldn’t tear my eyes away long enough to focus on him.\n\nThe only qualm I would say I had with the film is that, while I loved the visuals, and the costumes. SOme of the costumes, for example the servants in the place, were a little too flamboyant, to a point where they boarded on clownish/cartoonish. I know it’s a fairy tale, but it was almost a little too much. And bright, what an awful shade of yellow.\n\nOverall rating: 5/5 stars.\n\nWould I recommend: Yes. It’s such a fun, whimsical, and visually appealing movie, that even if you’re not a huge fan of Disney movies, just seeing it for the costume design, and visual effects will make it worth the watch.\n\nFollow Me On:\n\nTwitter: Kat Reviews (@KaterinaShirley)\n\nGoodreads: Katerina Shirley"
