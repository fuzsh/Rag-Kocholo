        "text": "ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. â Disneyâs Animal Kingdom, which opened on April 22, 1998, will celebrate its 25th anniversary on Saturday.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nDisney's Animal Kingdom celebrates its 25th anniversary on April 22\n\nThe park is home to 2,000 animals and 42 of them have been there since opening day\n\nVisitors can spot these longtime residents at The Oasis, Kilimanjaro Safaris and other areas of the park\n\nRELATED: Disney highlights 'secret' animals ahead of Animal Kingdom anniversary\n\nThe park has changed a lot over the years from new shows and dining experiences to new themed lands and attractions. But one of its biggest draws are the animals.\n\nAnimal Kingdom is home to about 2,000 animals, and thereâs a dedicated team of animal care professionals looking after them.\n\nâThe care we offer these animals doesnât just come down to the species,â said Dr. Mark Penning, vice president of Disneyâs Animals, Science and Environment. âWe look at the individual needs of that animal. So thinking about the different phases of lifeâa young animal versus an older animal, a pregnant animal versus not and things like that. Focusing on individual and specific needs.â\n\nBut what some visitors might not know is that dozens of animals at the park have been there since opening day, with some arriving nearly a year before the park first welcomed guests.\n\nThe parkâs 45 longtime animal residents include a western lowland gorilla, a rhinoceros iguana and a white stork.\n\nDisney says itâs a testament to the level of care the animals receive.\n\nHereâs a look at some of the opening day animals and where you can still find them in the park.\n\nGino\n\nAt 42, Gino, a western lowland gorilla, is the oldest gorilla at Animal Kingdom. Heâs been at the park since 1997 and can be found in the Gorilla Falls Exploration Trail. Gino is also a trailblazer. Heâs one of the first gorillas in the world to allow his caretakers to perform cardiac ultrasounds without anesthesia.\n\nJohnny\n\nAt the base of the Tree of Life, a popular spot to take pictures, visitors might spot a white stork named Johnny. Standing at over three feet tall with a wingspan of over five feet, Johnny has been a constant presence at the park for 25 years. He current shared his habitat with kangaroos and vultures.\n\nMac\n\nMaclean, known simply as âMac,â is a 13,000-pound African elephant. Heâs one of nine elephants in the herd that can be spotted on Kilimanjaro Safaris. Elephants communicate with each other through different sounds. By caring for elephants like Mac, scientists have been able to learn how they communicate. Mac also has a special way of communicating with his keepers: Heâll wave his truck to get their attention or extra treats.\n\nSid\n\nSid, a rhinoceros iguana, can be found in The Oasis area of the park. Another opening day animal, Sid is in his 40s. The rhino-like âhornsâ on his body are actually scales and thatâs where the rhinoceros iguanas get their name.\n\nTuma\n\nAnimal kingdom is actually home tom five hippos that have been at the park for 25 years. The youngest one is Tuma, also known as Tuma Toes by her keepers because of the pink spots near her toes. She arrived at the park when she was just over a year old. Now, sheâs a mom of twoâ5-year-old Augustus and 2-year-old Greta. Look for them on Kilimanjaro Safaris."
