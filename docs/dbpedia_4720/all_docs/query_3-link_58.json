        "text": "In previous posts I have alluded to folklore reports that the faeries have a distinctive smell (perhaps not always agreeable to humans) which distinguishes and identifies them- or their recent presence at a place (see the discussions in my books on The Faery Lifecycle and Manx Faeries.)\n\nIt’s only fair to add, though, that this process works both ways. There are two stories from the Isle of Man which illustrate this. Firstly, a man who was walking from Peel to Surby across the mountains came across a fine house where he was offered lodging for the night. However, soon after his arrival he was told he would have to be hidden because some faery visitors had arrived. His concealment notwithstanding, his presence inside a barrel was easily exposed by their sensitive noses. As soon as he’d been found, the house and all the company evaporated, leaving the man sitting alone on the moor in the sunshine.\n\nSecondly, a very grubby fisherman from Port Erin was forcibly washed by the faeries. Whilst it’s true that he’d seen them swinging on the gorse, dressed in their red caps and red and green clothes, this punishment was evidently about something more than his intrusion on their privacy, and I think it’s reasonable to infer that they objected to his odour as much as to the fact that he’d trespassed on their pastimes.\n\nThese two incidents are, I believe, unique in faerylore, but they’re not alone in wider folklore. Most readers will, I’m sure, be familiar with the rhyme from Jack and the Beanstalk “Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.” In this fairy tale, it’s a giant speaking, but the origin of the phrase seems to have been rather different. In Shakespeare’s King Lear Edgar, pretending to be mad, chants:\n\n“Child Rowland to the dark tower came,\n\nHis word was still ‘Fie, foh, and fum\n\nI smell the blood of a British man.”\n\nKing Lear, Act III, scene 4\n\nThis line doesn’t seem to have been Shakespeare’s invention either, because it appears in the ballad of Child Rowland and Burd Ellen.\n\n“With ‘fi, fi, fo, and fum!\n\nI smell the blood of a Christian man!\n\nBe he dead, be he living, wi’ my brand\n\nI’ll clash his harns [brains] frae his harn-pan!”\n\nThis time, though, the lines are spoken by the King of Elfland, whom Rowland also calls ‘Bogle of Hell,’ before fighting and killing him, so that he can release members of his family from fae captivity. These are Ellen, his sister, who was carried off to Faery by its monarch, as well as their two brothers, who went to rescue her but were defeated by the elf king. The Warlock Merlin had advised the three brothers that they should kill every person they met with after entering the land of Faery, and that, in addition, they should neither eat nor drink of what was offered to them in that country, whatever their hunger or thirst might be; for if they tasted or touched food in Elfland, they would remain in the power of the elves, and would never see Middle Earth again. We’ve looked at this taboo before. In this story, only the youth Child Rowland had the strength of character to obey these instructions to the letter.\n\nBehind this ballad lay a now-lost folk tale, which also inspired John Milton’s poem Comus and George Peele’s 1595 play The Old Wive’s Tale, in which the faery knight Huanebango exclaims “Fee, fa, fum/ Here is the Englishman!”\n\nAs we’ve seen, the sensitivity of the faeries to the humans’ smell is also linked to a rather vampiric interest in their blood. In fact, this isn’t wholly unknown amongst the more beastly and deadly faeries, such as the ‘mere maid‘ or water sprite in the Scottish story of Lorntie. Riding by a lake, Lorntie sees a woman floundering and apparently drowning in the water. He dashes to save her, but fortunately his squire sees the trap and holds him back. In a rage, the maiden declares:\n\n“Lorntie, Lorntie, were it not for your man,\n\nI’d have got your heart’s blood, skirling in my pan.”\n\nTo conclude- some unwelcome news: not only may we smell a bit to the faeries- but we might be quite tasty too…\n\nt\n\nAmazon have recently released a trailer for their new Lord of the Rings series and there has been disquiet amongst Tolkien fans to see that non-white characters are included amongst the cast. My own (British) newspaper devoted nearly a whole page to the debate this sparked. In the course of the article, the journalist reporting suggested that there was already good precedent for such diversity in the Norse Prose Edda, which refers to the svartalfar- the dark or black elves (the journalist plainly understanding svart in the sense of ‘swarthy’ in English). This suggestion was, I believe, entirely misconceived- firstly, because Norsemen actually referred to black people as ‘blue men’ (blaumenn). Secondly, and equally as importantly, Old Norse speakers weren’t using the word ‘black’ in the modern sense seen in ‘Black Lives Matter.’ They deployed it as contrast to ‘white’ in the dark/ light or good/ evil dichotomy, as is made abundantly clear by the other ‘clan’ of elves mentioned in the Edda, the ljosalfar or ‘light elves.’\n\nCrofton Croker, in Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland vol.3 (which largely isn’t about Ireland at all), discussed the Norse elves at some length. Quoting from the Grimm Brothers, he described the white, shining elves of light as being pure of colour and nearly transparent, dressed too in white or silver garments. They can be depicted as snow-white virgins who appear in the midday sunlight and disappear at dusk- the sun itself being called alfrodull (shining on the elves). Amongst these beings are the water elves who resemble white swans.\n\nAll in all, then, we can’t call on the Prose Edda to support Amazon’s decision to have a diverse cast. Does this mean that there’s no basis for such an idea? I’d say not, because, in fact, British faerylore and literature suggest that Amazon may not have strayed from tradition at all. Interestingly, earlier eras appear to have been more open to ideas of varied faery skin tones than we may be today- a subject I reviewed in my book The Faery Lifecycle (2021).\n\nThere’s a well-established tendency for us to assume that the British past was whiter than the present. In fact, a racially diverse population has been with us since Roman times (and, if we want to go back into the Mesolithic, Cheddar Man has been shown by DNA to be dark skinned, albeit blue-eyed). Certainly, during the Middle Ages British people were familiar enough with non-white neighbours- and that, apparently, included the Good Neighbours.\n\nMedieval chronicler William of Newburgh, writing about England in the late 1100s, recounted the story of a man called Ketell, from North Yorkshire, who was accosted on the road by two little black men. Although it is often the case in faery accounts that any colour mentioned relates to the faeries’ clothes, rather than to their complexion, the Latin text in this case reads “duos quasi Ethiopes parvulos.” There’s no mistaking William’s meaning here: the men Ketell encountered looked like ‘two little black Africans.’ Much more recently, some men “with black faces and wee green coaties” were seen by Jenny Rogers, wife of the coachman on an estate in the Scottish Borders. Once again, they seem to have been diminutive- judging by the coats anyway- and they don’t have a Caucasian skin tone. Likewise, some little people seen by men working in the fields at Strathpeffer were reported to have had “very dark skins” (although we must admit that weather-beaten skin is another very common faery trait).\n\nSimilar diversity is found in faery writing too. For example, in William Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream, the faery court has very strong connections with the far east, with Titania and Oberon disputing over a boy “stolen from an Indian king” whose mother served as a “votaress” to Titania, the pair having been in the habit of sitting together gossiping in the “spiced Indian air, by night.” Likewise, Milton in Paradise Lost imagined faeries as a “Pygmean race beyond the Indian mount.” In 1819, the poet John Keats described a faery city “in midmost Ind [India]” where a “fay of colour” resided- although admittedly this character is presented as an unhappy exception to the ruling population, being “slave from top to toe/ Sent as a present…”\n\nThese references all demonstrate that, into the early nineteenth century, there was no difficulty conceiving of a racially mixed Faery- even if the human evils of enslavement were reproduced there as well. This may have been done primarily for exotic effect, but at the same time there was no apparent sense that non-white faeries were impossible to imagine, either for authors or their audiences.\n\nWe might go even further, though, for there is in fact quite a lot of evidence (especially in Tudor and Stuart– sixteenth and seventeenth century- British sources)- as well as some more recent Welsh sightings- that faery beings might have skin colourings radically different from our own. Texts mention faes whose faces are chalk white, jet black, crimson, blue and green. It’s quite possible that the faeries in green coats with black faces seen by Jenny Rogers were in fact to be counted amongst these faes.\n\nWe have forgotten some of the more ‘alien’ looking skin tones that our ancestors apparently took in their stride just as (it seems) we have forgotten the potentially racially mixed nature of earlier faery sightings. As for Tolkien and Lord of the Rings, I suspect that he knew perfectly well what older generations had seen and written about. He was extremely well read in traditional stories, as well as in the medieval literature and myth, in light of which he may well not have been that surprised or distressed by Amazon’s decision to include some black actors in their adaptation.\n\n‘The Immortal Hour’\n\nMy consideration of the period of the First World War and its impact on visions of faery continues with this posting on the work of Rutland Boughton. He may be unknown to almost all readers, but he’s a fascinating subject for many reasons- for his fae operas, for his radical political views and as the founder of the original Glastonbury Festival.\n\nHe’s been described as a “socialist, patriot, musician and domestic genius, an agnostic of deep religious feeling and a man of many contradictory characteristics.”\n\nThe young Boughton by Christina Walshe\n\nBoughton was born in Aylesbury in 1878. His family ran a grocer’s shop which was not particularly successful, meaning that his schooling and prospects were limited. However, through luck and hard work, he managed to establish the musical career he had aspired to and, by the early 1900s, he was developing a reputation as a teacher and composer. He was working in Birmingham and his experience there with choirs convinced him of “the immense civilising influence of music and he began to feel that music, and art generally, might one day succeed where religion had failed.” He pursued these thoughts in a book, Music Drama of the Future, in 1911. He had become aware of:\n\n“the truly popular nature of all the greatest art and of the fact that the greatest artists acquire their superhuman power by acting as the expression of the ‘oversoul’ of a people.”\n\nBoughton was a great admirer of Wagner and argued that he had chosen folk subjects for his operas (such as the Rheingold) because these myths had been produced by this ‘oversoul.’\n\nBritish legend and British drama\n\nMusic Drama of the Future formed a sort of manifesto for Boughton. He wanted to produce heroic music dramas based upon the British ‘national scriptures’- stories like the legends of King Arthur which were the birth right of the British people. In addition, he wanted to create a national theatre where this might be done and which might lie at the heart of a larger community. He argued that previous attempts at communes had failed because they lacked a religious centre- a function that this new theatre could perform. He realised that he needed to find a “civically conscious” place where he could co-operate with the inhabitants to develop a “new city” focused on the drama venue.\n\nAround this time too, Boughton began to collaborate with writer Reginald Buckley. They shared a mutual love of Wagner, Ruskin, Milton, Dante and Tennyson and each wanted to write ‘music drama.’ Buckley had already written a text called Arthur of Britain and had been searching for a composer. Boughton had already identified the Arthurian myths as a subject. He saw them as the “best tap into the mystical heart of Great Britain.”\n\nA social experiment\n\nThere were various false starts in the plan for establishing the national theatre. Boughton proposed a summer school at Hindhead in 1912 and then went on to consider Letchworth Garden City as a possible setting for his experiment. By 1913, however, he’d chosen Glastonbury in Somerset as the best location in which to found his “English Bayreuth” and moved into a large house called Chalice Well where he also opened a school of music and drama. The aim of this was to train local singers, instrumentalists and dancers so that they could perform in the festivals, which would take place four times a year, at Easter, Whitsuntide, August and at Christmas. His plans were ambitious and unusual: he envisaged a festival linked to a commune for artists who preferred a country life and who felt that they should earn their livings through art combined with running a co-operative farm. In 1916 he wrote that “the whole business is for me as much a sociological as an aesthetic thing.” He and Buckley wanted to control the performances of their works completely, but they also wanted to involve the local community actively in all aspects of the festivals- performing, designing clothes and scenery and choreographing dances.\n\nBoughton was evidently ahead of his time- a fact demonstrated by his unconventional love life. He had married in 1903 but the marriage had not been wise or successful. Whilst in Birmingham he had formed a relationship with a music lover called Christine Walshe and in 1911 he left his wife and moved in with Christina.\n\nThe first Glastonbury Festival of Music Drama and Mystic Drama opened on August 5th 1914- the day after Britain entered the First World War. It featured performances of ‘A chapel in Lyonesse’ based on a poem by William Morris and the Immortal Hour, based on the faery play of that name by Scottish poet Fiona Macleod (real name, William Sharp). We’ll discuss this opera in more detail later, but it proved extremely popular and has been called “England’s greatest fairy opera.” The Immortal Hour was performed again at Easter 1915 and again in August 1916. That summer saw the first performance too of Boughton and Buckley’s opera The Round Table.\n\n‘Music of the duration’\n\nJust as the 1916 Festival ended, Boughton received his call-up papers from the Army. He appealed this to a tribunal, on the grounds that his work in Glastonbury was “of national importance.” In this he may have found encouragement from Lloyd George who, in 1916, had asked “Why should we not sing during the war?” He had been speaking in support for the annual eisteddfod but Boughton might well have drawn a parallel with his own English venture.\n\nThe authorities did not accept Boughton’s case- even though he argued that the Glastonbury festivals could draw money away from Bayreuth and Oberammergau- and for the next two years the festival was suspended whilst he served King and country. It has to be admitted, though, that whilst other artists like Tolkien, Ledwidge or Graves served on the front line, Boughton never did. He was bandmaster of a succession of regiments. Nevertheless, when in December 1918 The Times newspaper reviewed the music composed during the war it recognised Boughton’s contribution to the ‘artistic war effort’.\n\nThe older Boughton\n\nReturn to Avalon\n\nAs soon as the war was over, Boughton began planning the revival of the festival. He moved to a new and larger house called Mount Avalon which served as a school and hostel and at the first post-war festival, in August 1920, he presented The Immortal Hour, The Round Table and the new opera written with Buckley, The Birth of Arthur.\n\nThe revived festival as an idea, and the individual performances, attracted great praise and encouragement, but there was too a universal feeling that it could not grow as it should so long as it was staged in the cramped Assembly Rooms in Glastonbury High Street, in which there was neither space for larger audiences nor for the performers. Nonetheless, there were great hopes for the future and admiration for the way all the performers were able to contribute- as well as to develop their skills. The Times had, for example, been impressed how the school’s teachers had “discovered the children of the town to be fairies, nymphs, water sprites and elves.”\n\nThe festival continued until 1927 but steadily declined, despite successful national tours. A major contributing factor was Boughton’s ‘adulterous’ circumstances combined with his left-wing opinions. In 1923 he separated from Christina and moved in with one of his local pupils, a woman called Kathleen. This was scandalous in the Glastonbury of the 1920s- pupils were withdrawn from the schools and money was withheld for developing a dedicated theatre in the town. Money, too, had always been a problem: the festival launched with appeals for funds and always made a loss. Eventually the festival company went into liquidation; nevertheless, it had presented 350 stage performances and 100 concerts during its existence and permanently had an effect on the little town of Glastonbury. As many readers will know, the town itself is now a centre for alternative spirituality and lifestyles- a place where today Boughton’s love life would scarcely raise an eyebrow; secondly, as all readers will surely know, there is the modern Glastonbury Festival; organiser Michael Eavis must have derived some inspiration for this from the 1920s forerunner (even though the present day event is not, strictly, in Glastonbury at all, but several miles east).\n\nIn November 1927 Boughton moved to a smallholding at Kilcot on the edge of the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, where he and Kathleen raised a family, kept pigs, goats and hens and grew vegetables and cider apples. From this point on, his career also sank steadily into obscurity- something he ascribed (perhaps with a hint of paranoia) to his political views.\n\nRutland & Kathleen in later life\n\nPolitics\n\nThe early 1920s Boughton was involved with the London Labour Choral Union. Along with Herbert Morrison, he believed that “working class music making could be an invigorating element in Socialist politics and culture.” The choral union was indeed a vital part of Labour Party culture until it was cut as an unaffordable luxury.\n\nBefore then, though, Boughton had joined the Communist Party, expressing his belief in organised control by the workers. He identified personally with this because he felt that, as a composer, he had very little control over the fruits of his labour. Boughton resigned from the Party in 1929 because he felt he had been undervalued and underused, but rejoined in 1945, only to quit again in 1956 over the invasion of Hungary.\n\nIt was only very late in his life that Boughton returned to the Arthurian Cycle, which he had largely abandoned after the death of Buckley in 1919. He wrote the final two operas, Galahad and Avalon, in the mid-1940s. The final scene of Avalon shows his continuing belief in Socialist principles: the Lady of the Lake reveals three visions of the past, present and future to the dying King Arthur. These are the star of Bethlehem, the white star of hope shining over his own land and, finally, a red star that will rise in the east. At the outset, the composer had seen Arthur as “an essentially British fount of inspiration” but clearly over the decades it changed from Wagnerian epic to a political tract with strong religious overtones. The cycle as a whole may not be a success, but it has been described as “an extraordinary demonstration of artistic courage and determination- a ruin perhaps, but undeniably impressive.” Certainly, the cycle to many seemed to represent the raison d’etre of a national festival founded in Avalon; the dramas were the source of the festival’s vitality and its justification.\n\nWilliam Sharp- the artist formerly known as Fiona Macleod\n\nFaeryland\n\n“I have gone out and seen the lands of Faery/ And have found sorrow and peace and beauty there.” (Dreams within dreams, Fiona Macleod)\n\nMyth and faerie magic suffuse much of Boughton’s work. They are of course present in the Arthurian cycle, but he also wrote a range of other songs and operas based on fairy poems. These include Faery people, based on a poem by Mary Webb, and a large number of poems by Fiona Macleod, amongst which are Dalua and Avalon, part of Boughton’s Six Celtic Choruses.\n\nThe most important of these latter works is The Immortal Hour. Christina Walshe was very influential in developing Boughton’s taste for Irish and Scottish mythology; she was half Irish and was a great supporter of the ‘Celtic revival.’ Boughton studied Hebridean folk songs before writing the music for The Hour and, whilst he was absent in the army in September 1918, she arranged performances of W. B. Yeats’ play The land of heart’s desire and of The Immortal Hour.\n\nFiona Macleod was the secret pseudonym of William Sharp (1855-1905), something kept secret during his lifetime. Sharp was a Scottish author, a prolific writer of poetry, plays and literary biography. He was much involved in the ‘Celtic revival’ in Scotland and became familiar with W. B. Yeats. Like Yeats, he was a member of Alistair Crowley’s Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Consonant with these occult interests, Macleod/ Sharp wrote a great deal of mystical and mythical verse, amongst which are small a number with an explicit fairy theme, including The bugles of dreamland, The hills of Ruel, The moon child, The lords of shadow, Dreams within dreams and The last fay. Sharp was plainly very familiar with the key elements of Gaelic fairy belief and with the overall mood of magic and sadness that pervades Celtic legend. These are powerful elements in the Immortal Hour, which is a verse drama of some seventy pages concerned with Celtic myths of the sidh folk and based on the Irish story Tochmarc Étaíne, the ‘Wooing of Etain.’\n\nMacleod’s Immortal Hour has been described as being ideal for Boughton as it was “a legend only half told, with meanings hinted at, never spoken out.” This left him free to mould the work into any musical shape that appealed. He did so, but still left much to the audience’s imaginations. As The Times acknowledged in 1919, “the vague imagery of Fiona Macleod was easy to catch in music- and easy to dissipate.” Boughton had captured it effectively. Whilst the original play was “visionary and vague” the opera was visionary but not vague- full of tunes that haunt you.\n\nMacleod’s play is very short- only two brief acts- and not a great deal happens in it. In the first act fairy princess Etain and High King of Ireland, Eochaid, are brought together by fairy trickster Dalua. In the second act Etain’s former lover, Midir, comes from faery in search of her. She remembers her former life and departs with him and Dalua casts a spell of death over Eochaid. The drama is perhaps best known for the recurring ‘fairy song’:\n\n“How beautiful they are, the lordly ones, who dwell in the hills, in the hollow hills.”\n\nMary Webb’s poem ‘Fairy led’ was used as the basis for Boughton’s ‘Fairy song:’\n\n“The fairy people flouted me,\n\nMocked me, shouted me–\n\nThey chased me down the dreamy hill and beat me with a wand.\n\nWithin the wood they found me, put spells on me and bound me\n\nAnd left me at the edge of day in John the Miller’s pond.\n\nBeneath the eerie starlight\n\nTheir hair shone curd-white;\n\nTheir bodies were all twisted like a lichened apple-tree;\n\nFeather-light and swift they moved,\n\nAnd never one the other loved,\n\nFor all were full of ancient dreams and dark designs on me.\n\nWith noise of leafy singing\n\nAnd white wands swinging,\n\nThey marched away amid the grass that swayed to let them through.\n\nBetween the yellow tansies\n\nTheir eyes, like purple pansies,\n\nPeered back on me before they passed all trackless in the dew.”\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nBoughton combined many intriguing characteristics- he was a social radical, he was interested in self sufficiency and communal living, he had an intense spirituality without being conventionally religious and he recognised the potential power of music, poetry and myth in our lives. Boughton reasserted the place of the Arthurian legends and of Avalon in British culture in the twentieth century and, significantly for us here, he is a notable example of the power of Faery in art.\n\nFurther reading\n\nI’ve written more about the impact of the fairy faith on British music, on the composers Arnold Bax and John Ireland. This essay should be read in conjunction with my discussions of Tolkien, Bernard Sleigh and his map of faery and the role of the arts during the Great War.\n\nFor more on Broughton, and the influence of Faery in classical and contemporary music, see my 2022 book The Faery Faith in British Music which is available from Amazon, either as an e-book (£5.95) or a paperback (£7.95).\n\nReading Minor White Latham’s Elizabethan fairies recently, I was struck by his argument that Tudor and Stuart conceptions about the race and colour of fairies might have been quite different our own assumptions. I’ve argued before that there’s a good deal of evidence of ethnic diversity in Faery Let’s not forget, for example, that in Midsummer Night’s Dream the fairy court has connections with the far east, Titania and Oberon disputing over a boy “stolen from an Indian king” whose mother was a “votaress” of Titania’s, the pair sitting together gossiping in the “spiced Indian air, by night.” Likewise, Milton in Paradise Lost imagined a “Pygmean race beyond the Indian mount.” African and Asian fairies ought not to surprise us at all, then, but Latham goes considerably further than this.\n\nMasks for masques\n\nThe Tudors and Stuarts loved performing as faes in masques and plays, and to do so they put on masks. For example, in George Gascoigne’s 1565 comedy The Buggbears there’s reference to spirits played by actors in “visars like devills,” to going “a-sprityng with this face and that” and “buggbears with vysardes.” Latham’s argument is that the colour of these masks reflects conceptions about what he calls the ‘complexion’ of the fairies. A very good starting point for an exploration of this argument is Shakespeare’s Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nIn the Merry Wives of Windsor, Shakespeare returned to a fairy theme for comic effect. Fairies often appeared on the English stage as a vehicle for cheating or tricking characters, and that is their purpose in this play. A plot is hatched to make a fool of Falstaff by dressing up some children as fairies and scaring him. Mrs Anne Page decides her daughter Nan, her young son and three or four more of his age group shall “dress / Like urchins, ouphs and fairies, green and white,” holding candles and rattles (IV, 4). Nan is to be the fairy queen in a white silk dress and it’s very evident from the line quoted above that the others will be wearing green and white too. Mrs Page’s friend, Mrs Ford, then says “I’ll go buy them vizards.” In a slightly later scene (IV, 6), in which the women go over their plans again, it’s agreed that the children should be “mask’d and vizarded.” They’ll be in disguise, then; their faces will be covered. As a consequence, when Falstaff is confronted by Nan as the fairy queen (V, 5) and she calls forth “Fairies, black, grey, green and white” there’s a good deal of support for Latham’s suggestion that these colours relate not to their clothes (which we already know about) but to the colour of their masks (faces).\n\nSupport for Latham’s contention comes from the text of a masque performed for Queen Elizabeth at Woodstock in 1575. The entertainment began with the monarch being approached by the ‘Queen of Fayry’ who presents herself by declaring that her love for Elizabeth had drawn her out of her woodland retreat and “caused me transforme my face/ and in your hue to come before your eyne/ now white, then blacke, your frend the fayery Queene.” Black and white were the colours of the English queen, but at the same time it did not appear to be considered odd that her supernatural counterpart might have a black face.\n\nRed, black & white spirits\n\nIn light of these examples, I’d return to other evidence I cited for you in an previous post on red and white fairies, and argue more confidently that those citations weren’t descriptions of clothes but of skin colour. There are further examples to consider.\n\nReginald Scot in his Discourse concerning the nature and substance of devils and spirits mentions “white spirits and black spirits, grey spirits and red spirits” (c.33); in Macbeth the three witches meet with Hecate and “Like elves and Fairies in a ring” summon up “Black spirits.” The 1618 masque at Cole-Orton featured a character asking Puck about “ye faries, those little ring-leaders, those white and blew faries.” In his play, Monsieur Thomas, John Fletcher has a character attempting to conjure spirits of earth and air, whom he addresses thus: “Be thou black or white or green, be thou heard or seen.” (c.1637, Act V, scene 9) Lastly, Joan Willimot, accused of witchcraft in 1618, had a fairy woman called Pretty as her spirit guide, who would advise her on those who had been cursed. She told Joan that the Earl of Rutland’s son had been “stricken with a white spirit.” This is very suggestive of a white fairy, akin to those ‘white ladies’ who are often seen haunting springs or old houses.\n\nAll in all, it seems to me that we have pretty strong evidence for the fact that English people of the early modern period conceived of their fays as being quite alien in appearance- red, green, blue, grey, jet black and snow white.\n\nFurther reading\n\nMy posts on diversity in fairy and on fairy colours touch on closely related topics; my post on fairy stature examines another convention of the fairy drama of Shakespeare’s time.\n\nAn edited and expanded version of this post will be found in my book Fayerie- Fairies and Fairyland in Tudor and Stuart Verse. See my books page for more information. There’s more too on faery anatomy and physiology in my Faery Lifecycle published in 2021:\n\nKing Arthur and the Fairy Queen, by Henry Fuseli\n\nIt is often said that true happiness passed away with the departure of the fairies from our land. In this posting I want to examine the traditional ties that exist between fairies and the myths Merry England.\n\nFairies are inextricably linked with joy and merry making in the English/ British tradition. In many accounts their sole or main occupation is dancing in rings and one persistently identified characteristic of fairyland is joy. The fairies take a simple, unalloyed pleasure in dance and music, so much so that circle-dancing in the moonlight has become a defining trait. Accordingly, William Warner’s Albion’s England published in 1602 described how:\n\n“The Elves and Faries, taking fists, did hop a merry Rounde…\n\nThe ayrie Sprites, the walking Flares, and Goblins great and small,\n\nHad there good cheare, and companie, and sporte the Devill and all.”\n\nIn his 1611 masque Oberon the fairy Ben Jonson celebrates that:\n\n“These are Nights,\n\nSolemn to the shining Rites\n\nOf the Fairy Prince and Knight:\n\nWhile the Moon their Orgies light…\n\nStand forth bright Faies and Elves and tune your lays.”\n\nIn Milton’s Comus of 1632 we read how:\n\n“And on the Tawny Sands and shelves,\n\nTrip the pert Fairies and the dapper Elves,\n\nBy dimpled Brook and Fountain brim,\n\nThe Wood-Nymphs deckt with Daisies trim,\n\nTheir merry wakes and pastimes keep:\n\nWhat hath night to do with sleep?” (lines 117-122)\n\nFairies continued to be associated with innocent pastimes into the nineteenth century, for example in Ann Radcliffe’s poem Air the “Fays of lawn and glade” circle to the merry tabor sound and Paul Dunbar reassured his readers that the fairy rout still shouted, sang and danced their roundelays, even in late Victorian times (Dunbar (1872-1906), The discovery).\n\nFairies, therefore, may be said to have been synonymous with ‘merry England.’ Unfortunately, the general opinion emerged that those times were over- despite Dunbar’s promises that fairy glee persisted- and this, of course, necessitated the poet’s assurances to the contrary. Most later writers felt that the fairies had departed, or at least fallen silent, and that Britain had become a less joyful place. As early as the seventeenth century, indeed, Richard Corbet in Farewell rewards and fairies explicitly blamed the Reformation and the baneful effect of Puritan morality for this:\n\n“At morning and at evening both\n\nYou merry were and glad,\n\nSo little care of sleep or sloth\n\nThese pretty ladies had;\n\nWhen Tom came home from labour,\n\nOr Cis to milking rose,\n\nThen merrily went their tabor,\n\nAnd nimbly went their toes.\n\nWitness those rings and roundelays\n\nOf theirs, which yet remain,\n\nWere footed in Queen Mary’s days\n\nOn many a grassy plain;\n\nBut since of late, Elizabeth,\n\nAnd later, James came in,\n\nThey never danced on any heath\n\nAs when the time hath been.”\n\nJohn Selden expressed the belief most memorably and succinctly: “There never was a merry World since the Fairies left Dancing and the Parson left conjuring” (Selden, Table talk, 1689, c.XCIX). Later the same century John Dryden, in his version of The wife of Bath’s tale, conveyed the same sentiment, but emphasised the intimate connection of the fairies to the British Isles:\n\n“Above the rest our Britain they held dear,\n\nMore solemnly they kept their Sabbaths here,\n\nAnd made more spacious rings, and revelled half the year.\n\nI speak of ancient times, for now the swain\n\nReturning late may pass the wood in vain,\n\nAnd never hope to see the nightly train:”\n\nThe death of ‘Merrie England’ continued to be mourned long after the event. Thomas Hood lamented that the “Fairies have broke their wands/ And wishing has lost its power!” (Hood (1799-1845), A lake and a fairy boat). In the ‘Dymchurch flit’ Kipling’s fairies declared “we must flit out of this, for Merry England’s done” (Kipling, Puck of Pook’s Hill, 1906). Folklorists on the Isle of Man in the nineteenth century heard the same stories of the fynoderee: “There has not been a merry world since he lost his ground” ( J. Train, Account of the Isle of Man, vol.2, p.138). This supernatural Manx being is comparable to the British mainland brownie; he lives on a farmstead and is the source and guarantor of good fortune. It follows that “The luck of the house is said to depart for ever with the offended phynnod-derree” (William Harrison, Mona miscellany, pp.173-174.) The same of course is true in England and Scotland: there can be no happiness or contentment on a farm if the brownie is displeased or has disappeared.\n\nTo summarise, then, we can only hope to reconnect with joy and good luck if we re-establish contact with our good neighbours. This was certainly the conviction of William George Russell (AE). His poem The dream of the children describes how music and wonder are revived:\n\n“For all the hillside was haunted/ By the faery folk, come again.”\n\nIdentification of elves with older, happier times holds out to us the hope that they may be restored. Through the fairies we may recover our innocence, simplicity and sense of community. The fairies’ unaffected love of dancing and music, their childlike joy in play, imply that our own ability to reconnect with a better, less complex world persists undiminished and may be revived.\n\nFurther reading\n\nAs well as symbolising and linking us to a ‘merry England’ of the imagination, fairies had another historical role- to explain and contextualise monuments and prehistoric sites that were otherwise mysterious and anomalous. See my posts on fairies and megaliths and on the use of fairy-lore to explain the past.\n\nThe fairy as conceived by British folk tradition was effected- and not for the better- by the revival of classical learning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this post I wish to trace the course and impact of this rebirth of Roman and Greek knowledge in the specific context of British fairy lore.\n\nRenaissance writers\n\nThe very earliest sign of classical influence comes from Chaucer, in the Merchants Tale. He refers there to “Pluto, that is the king of fayerye/ And many a lady in his companye/ Folwinge his wyf, the quene Prosperpyne.” This can be dated to about 1390 and is probably more a sign of Chaucer’s own education and reading than any real indicator of the spread of new thinking from Italy, where the rinascimento was at that time still in its infancy.\n\nI suggest a more significant start date is the appearance of Gavin Douglas’ 1513 translation of Ovid’s Aeneid, in which he chose to refer to “nymphis and faunis apoun every side/ Quhilk Fairfolkis or than Elfis clepen we…” This linking of nymphs and elves remains consistent then for the next 150 years; for example, Thomas Nash makes this analogy: “The Robin Goodfellows, Elfs, Fairies, Hobgoblins of our latter age, which idolatrous former days and the fantastical world of Greece ycleped Fauns, Satyrs, Dryads and Hamadryads…” Latterly, Milton in Comus from 1630 spoke of fairies and elves as equivalent to nymphs. Of this work, Floris Delattre observed that “the now trite assimilation of English fairies to classical nymphs gains … a fresh beauty” thanks to the poet’s “refined language” (English fairy poetry, 1908, p.165).\n\nTranslations of Ovid soon spread other classical concepts: for example Thomas Phaer in his 1550 version of the Aeneid mentioned fauns, nymphs and the fairy queen whilst Arthur Golding’s translation of the Metamorphoses of 1565 described “nymphes of faery.” The process could work in reverse as well, with native terms being used to explain classical ones. For example, Golding felt that the best translation he could make was to describe the “Chimaera, that same pouke.”\n\nNymphs and fairies\n\nThe easy reference to classical deities then became habitual. Nymphs and fairies were inseparable. Drayton in Poly-Olbion treats “Ceres nymphs” as interchangeable with fairies (Song XXI) and also marries a nymph to a fay and has dryads, hamadryads, satyrs and fauns dance with fairies in his Nymphals 8 & 6. Other Greek and Roman figures also begin to insinuate themselves. Scot in The discovery of witchcraft (1584) mentions “satyrs, pans, fauns, sylvans, tritons, centaurs…” in his list of fairy beings (Book VII c.XV) and he names the fairy queen variously as Sibylla, Minerva, Diana and Herodias. For King James VI in Daemonologie Diana and her court are synonymous with ‘Phairie.’ Ben Jonson’s Masque of Oberon from 1610 carelessly mixes the “coarse and country fairy” with satyrs and sylvans. Burton, writing the Anatomy of melancholy in 1621, listed such “Terrestrial devils [as] lares, genii, fauns, satyrs, wood nymphs, foliots, fairies…” Spenser meanwhile introduced the Graces to the company of fairies in both The Fairy queen and Epithalamium.\n\nIt may be helpful to provide a summary of the various Greek and Roman gods and spirits with whom parallels were so freely drawn. It must be acknowledged that there are undeniable parallels and comparisons between some British fairies and some Mediterranean deities, analogies sufficiently strong to justify a few of the identifications made. This is, of course, due to the fact that all of these supernatural beings derive ultimately from the same Indo-European sources and are responses to the same natural processes and features. Nonetheless, each culture had developed differently and whilst there were links to be made (as, for example, was done in works such as Frazer’s Golden Bough) these beings had evolved separately for centuries and, whilst comparable, were very far from being identical.\n\nClassical references\n\nWriters freely made reference to:\n\nAbundantia- who was the Roman goddess of fortune and prosperity. She evolved into a beneficent spirit and, ultimately, into Habundia, queen of the witches and fairies;\n\nCeres- she was a goddess of the growth of plant foods. Insofar as she had vegetative associations, there was some tenuous link with British fairies;\n\nDiana– who was goddess of childbirth, of nature and of the moon. Queen Mab was a midwife, as testified by Andro Man, accused of witchcraft in 1598, and fairies often danced in the moonlight, so that Diana’s transfer to Britain makes some sense;\n\nDryads– nymphs of trees and woods and so comparable to elves;\n\nFauns– a faun is a rural deity who bestows fruitfulness on fields and cattle. He can also have prophetic powers. His influence over natural processes suggested the analogy with elves;\n\nGenii– are clan spirits and perhaps therefore allied to brownies, banshees and the like;\n\nGraces- these were Greek goddesses of fertility in fields and gardens and accordingly comparable to elves and fairies;\n\nHecate- was the goddess of magic and spells; she was linked to the moon and was a goddess of childbirth and the night. Through Queen Mab she was therefore associated with fairies and witches;\n\nHerodias– was mother of Salome and was reputed to be head of a witch cult. She became linked to fairies through the witch craze and was identified with Habundia, queen of Elfame. By circuitous routes, therefore, Heywood ended up equating sibils and fees, white nymphs, Nightladies and Habundia their queen;\n\nLares- are tutelary deities of fields and homes and are accordingly similar to boggarts, brownies and such like;\n\nMinerva- was linked to the arts and crafts and had no real identity with British fairies;\n\nNymphs- these are minor deities linked to fertility, growth, trees and water (streams, lakes and the seas). As such they are clearly comparable to elves and fairies. For example, the nymphs tended to protect specific locales so that there may be some analogy to be made between the water naiads and British sprites like Grindylow and Peg Powler;\n\nPan- was a deity of Arcadia, part-goat, part-human. He haunted the high hills and brought fertility to the flocks and herds, but not to agriculture. He could send visions and dreams. He has a vague resemblance to pucks and hobgoblins, but no more;\n\nSatyrs– were envisaged as half-man and half-beast; they were brothers to the mountain nymphs and akin to fauns. As such, they resembled pucks, brownies and hobgoblins to some extent;\n\nSibylla– was a prophetess, and so became linked to fairies through the witch craze;\n\nSylvans– these are woodland deities, readily associated with fairies.\n\nSome of the classical names used had no relevance at all to British fairies; some denoted distantly related beings. All were facile and ultimately uninformative and unhelpful. The use of the classical comparisons diluted and disrupted more accurate knowledge of genuine British traditions, inhibiting rather than encouraging study. They were superficial displays of learning which detracted from a deeper and more valuable investigation of the ‘national fairies’ as Floris Delattre termed them. Classical references added nothing of value to the verse- rather it obscured the nature of insular tradition and accelerated its decline by promoting false analogies and parallels. The Greek and Roman figures had character traits and qualities unknown before, with notions of hierarchy, worship and relationships that were alien and inapplicable to British folklore. All in all, therefore, the impact of the Renaissance learning was in this instance entirely negative.\n\nNymphs in literature\n\nNymphs have always been popular characters, in poetry in particular, and have been possessed of a distinct character and attributes. They are associated inextricably with fairies in the earliest quote, from Melusine, of around 1500:\n\n“Ye should have ben out of the handes of the Nymphes and of the fairees.”\n\nTheir physical attractiveness was their primary feature, as this string of quotations demonstrates:\n\n“O nymph of beauty’s train, The onely cause and easer of my paine.” (Thomas Lodge, The delectable history of Forbonius and Prisceria, 1584)\n\nLodge hammered home his idea of ‘nimphs’ in many other lines of verse, in which they were lauded as ‘gorgeous’, ‘faire’, ‘lovelie’, ‘heavenly,’ ”tender’ and ‘sweet’ (Glaucus and Scilla; Euphues’ golden legacy). The effect of such attractiveness was predictable:\n\n“he hath seen some beautiful Nymph, and is growen amorous.” (Euphues)\n\nIt was perhaps Edmund Spenser who was most especially devoted to the celebration of their charms:\n\n“Ye silvans, fawns and satires that among these thickets oft have daunst,/ Ye nymphs and nayades with golden heare.” (A pastoral eclogue upon the death of Sir Philip Sydney, 1595).\n\nHe placed them securely within a classical, woodland landscape, describing variously a swain “”who in these woods amongst the nymphs dost wonne” and invoking:\n\n“O flocks, O faunes, and O ye plesaunt springs/ Of Tempe, where the country Nymphs are rife…” (Virgil’s gnat)\n\nTheir unspoiled, rural nature is a trait that was to appeal to poets for centuries. Their physical attractiveness was undeniable and irresistible. In Colin Clout’s come home again Spenser mentions “the nymph delitious” and declares that “a fairer nymph yet never saw mine eie.” These praises reach their natural conclusion in verses from The Fairy Queen:\n\n“As if the love of some new nymphe late seene/ Had in him kindled youthful fresh desire…” (Canto VIII, stanza XI)\n\n“Finding the nymph asleepe in secret wheare/ As he by chance did wander the same way,/ Was taken with her love, and by her closely lay.” (Canto IV, stanza XIX)\n\nLastly, it will have been seen that other terms are sometimes employed. Spenser grouped his nymphs with naiads and these divinities occasionally appear in verse, the earliest being Lydgate’s Troyyes Book of 1495, in which he refers comprehensively to-\n\n“Water nymphs, nor this nayades, Satiry, nouther driades, that goddesse bene of wode and wildernesse.”\n\nSpenser elsewhere speaks of “Fayre Naiades” (Virgil’s gnat, 1597) and Milton charmingly imagines them as being “flowrie-kirtl’d” (Comus, 1637). Finally, we may note that Nabokov was by no means originator of the term ‘nymphet.’ In the Polyolbion of 1612 Michael Drayton makes mention “of the Nymphets sporting there, In Wyrrall and in Delamere.” (XI, Argument 171)\n\nProgressively over time, as I have argued in another post, the nymph and the fairy drew ever closer together- the fairy assimilating to the nymph and becoming younger and more feminised.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, we must first concede that British fairy lore was already a hybrid, containing elements of Celtic, Saxon and French myth; Morgan le Fay mixed with Germanic elves and Cornish pixies to create complex and many layered stories. Classical themes added nothing to this. References to nymphs and fauns were a learned and literary graft upon native roots and served only to stunt further development of the tradition. Whatever the wider enriching qualities of the Renaissance, it only did damage to British folk lore.\n\nAn expanded version of this posting is found in my book British fairies (2017). See too my posting Not all nymphs are nice for some alternative approaches to our classical inheritance, in which I discuss nymphs in the work of Arthur Machen, and also his influence on the depiction of nymphs and fairies in early twentieth century classical music.\n\nSee my more recent books, dealing solely with nymphs and nymphets, Nymphology (2020), Sea-Nymphs, Sirens, Sphinxes (2022) and The Woods are Filled with Gods- Dryads, Centaurs & Satyrs (2022). Full details are available on my dedicated Nymphology blog.\n\nThe cheese well\n\nOne of the explanations of the belief in fairies is that they are the degraded remnants of former gods, the traces of ancient pantheistic belief in Britain. The habit of making offerings of one description or another to these beings lends support to this theory but, as we shall see, the evidence presents a confusing picture of what people understood themselves to be doing. The recorded practices could be worship, or they could even be something akin to a commercial transaction.\n\nOfferings to fairies\n\nThe offerings take several forms. The first is a general gift made to ‘the fairies’ as a sign of respect and propitiation. Several examples of this come from Scotland: in the Highlands and Islands it was common for milk to be poured on stones with hollows in them in order to ensure the protection of the herds of cattle. On top of Minchmuir, Peebles-shire, there was the so-called ‘Cheese Well’ into which locals threw pieces of cheese for the guardian fairies. If we see the fairies as once having been gods, then these marks of honour aimed at appeasing the ‘good neighbours,’ averting ill fortune and ensuring their continuing good will, appear to be strong confirmation of divine origins.\n\nSimilarly, on Lewis farmers would wade out into the waves and pour beer into the sea, invoking the water-spirit Shoney and asking for a good harvest of seaweed for the fields. Comparable conduct was found in the South West of England: miners would give up a portion of their lunches to the ‘knockers’ in the mine, hoping that they would then be led to the best lodes of tin, and at Newlyn the pixies living between low and high water mark, the bucca, would be offered a ‘cast’ of three fish so as to guarantee a good catch in the nets. These ‘sacrifices’ made with a view to a specific outcome are a very familiar aspects of human interactions with divinities. They also imply that the fairies possessed some kind of control over the sea and its contents. This is not a typical fairy attribute, although the Cornish spriggans were said to have power over the weather and could call on thunder and lightning when they wished to.\n\nIn England there is an example of a more direct exchange between human and fairy. There was a belief that elder trees were inhabited by the ‘old lady of the elder tree.‘ If a person wished to cut some branches from a bush, a vow had to be made: ‘Old Lady, if you let me take some of your wood now, you can take some of mine when I’m a tree.’ Omission of this promise could lead to disaster- fire or illness in the household.\n\nSecondly, there are examples of offerings being made in return for which a gift of money might be expected from the fairies. An example comes from Llanberis, in Snowdonia, from the 1750s: the practice was for farm maids to place a jug of fresh sweet milk and a clean towel on a stone in the morning. When they later returned, the jug would have been emptied by the Tylwyth Teg and a handful of coins would have been left. This kind of exchange between humans and fairies is very closely associated with the reports of fairies leaving small sums of silver for chosen people- albeit on the strict condition that they maintain secrecy as to the source of their new found prosperity. Violation of this would inevitably terminate the fairies’ good favour. These practices clearly are a kind of bargain as much as an oblation. An interesting variant on this practice comes from Wirt Sikes in British goblins (p.22). He tells of a “servant girl who attended to the cattle on the Trwyn farm, near Abergwyddon, [who] used to take food to ‘Master. Pwca,’ as she called the elf. A bowl of fresh milk and a slice of white bread were the component parts of the goblin’s repast, and were placed on a certain spot where he got them. One night the girl, moved by the spirit of mischief, drank the milk and ate most of the bread, leaving for Master Pwca only water and crusts. Next morning she found that the fastidious fairy had left the food untouched. Not long after, as the girl was passing the lonely spot where she had hitherto left Pwca his food, she was seized under the arm pits by fleshly hands (which, however, she could not see), and subjected to a castigation of a most mortifying character. Simultaneously there fell upon her ear in good set Welsh a warning not to repeat her offence on peril of still worse treatment.” This might be read as either divine punishment for disrespect or simply revenge for a practical joke.\n\nDomestic offerings\n\nThe exchanges just described were made in the open air or in uninhabited or deserted buildings. Throughout Britain, though, there was a very similar practice of householders leaving out bread, milk or clean, warm water for the fairies at night. Once again, a small gift might be anticipated in the morning. Sometimes, the coins were more like a reward- a clean and neat house was appreciated by the nocturnal visitors and was acknowledged by a couple of coppers. Some writers were in no doubt as to the nature of these interactions. Robert Burton, in Anatomy of melancholy (1621), understood fairies to be erstwhile deities “which have been in former times adored with much superstition, with sweeping their houses and setting of a pail of clean water, good victuals and the like, and then they should not be pinched but find money in their shoes and be fortunate in their enterprises.” Avoidance of punishment was a clear motivation: John Aubrey noted that, until the reign of King James I, country folk were “wont to please the fairies, that they might do no shrewd turnes, by sweeping clean the Hearth and setting by it a dish of fair water and halfe sadd bread, whereon was set a messe of milke sopt with white bread. And on the morrow they should find a groat” (Remains of Gentilisme & Judaism, 1687 pp.29 & 125).\n\nOfferings to brownies\n\nThe last kind of fairy offering we should note is that made to known individual beings- most commonly the brownies and other domestic hobgoblins of English and lowland Scottish folklore. A kind of bargain is again involved in these cases. The brownie undertakes some “drudgery work” in the house or on the farmstead (threshing, mowing, cleaning) and gets remuneration. However, it was fundamental to the transaction that this gift of cream, milk or cake did not seem like a direct payment. The items were ‘left out’, available for the brownie to find and consume, but they were not explicitly given to the hobgoblin in return for the labours undertaken. If the offering was too plainly intended for the spirit- the worst examples being specially-made clothes to cover their hairy nakedness- then the brownie would take offence and would either leave the holding in a huff or, worse still, remain but as a malevolent presence.\n\nAn example of this tradition is found in Scot’s Discoverie of witchcraft (1584): “your grandams maides were woont to sett a boll of milke before … Robin Good Fellow for grinding of the malt or mustard and sweeping the house at midnight: and you have heard that he would chafe exceedingly if the maide or the goodwife of the house, having compassion on his nakedness, laid anie clothes for him, besides his messe of white bread and milke which was his standing fee” (Book IV, c.X). Milton, in L’Allegro, gives a similar account of the country dweller’s stories of brownies:\n\n“Tells how the drudging goblin sweat,\n\nTo earn his cream-bowl duly set,\n\nWhen in one night, ere glimpse of morn,\n\nHis shadowy flail hath thresh’d the corn\n\nThat ten day-labourers could not end;\n\nThen lies him down, the lubber fiend,\n\nAnd stretch’d out all the chimney’s length,\n\nBasks at the fire his hairy strength;\n\nAnd crop-full out of doors he flings,\n\nEre the first cock his matin rings.”\n\nA curious example of domestic interaction between humans and fairies which sits somewhere between the brownie and ‘neatness rewarded’ is a story from Stowmarket in Suffolk, recorded in the mid-nineteenth century. An old man in the town was regularly visited by the ‘ferriers’ or ‘ferrishers’ (as they were termed in the county) who used to meet in his home; he recalled that they wore long green coats and yellow shoes. He kept his house scrupulously clean for them and in return the ferriers supplied faggots which they put in his oven and, from time to time, would leave a shilling for him under a chair leg. When he spoke about these visits, he lost their favour. It’s hard to say in this account who is more beholden to whom- there’s an equality of exchange which obscures any suggestion of devotion.\n\nThe exact relationship between fairies and humans is, on the evidence of these examples, confused and ill-defined. This need not be too surprising, given that such uncertainty exists as to the origins of the fairy belief. In the first examples, maintaining the benevolence of the supernatural realm was a key element in the folk customs. The later examples, though, whilst made in propitiative guise, should really be seen as bargains. In return for labour or for food a payment is made; the pretence is that these are offerings but actual truth appears to be that the fairies are the supplicants, a relationship that Katherine Briggs identified when she spoke of the ‘dependence of the fairies’ upon humans.\n\nAn expanded version of this posting is found in my book British fairies (2017)."
