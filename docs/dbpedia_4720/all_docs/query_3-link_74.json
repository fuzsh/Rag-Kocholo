        "text": "Robert Gregg asserts that films provide an insight into the real picture of international relations. (Gregg, 1998.P.10) Films serve as an important tool in manufacturing the consent of the target audience. By remaining loyal to the narrowest lines of foreign policy of a government, film makers urge to define and redefine friends and foes on silver screen. Sticking to above context, film may be taken as an important manuscript of socio-political history of a nation. Every film continues to be political as its basis lies in some ideology. In the words of Merrill, a film is not only an instrument of communication but it also serves as an organ of propaganda to build or rebuild one's image.\n\nNico Baumbach’s book examines an ongoing and variegated conversation in cinema studies with roots in Jean-Louis Comolli and Jean Narboni’s 1969 editorial statement in Cahiers du cinéma, ‘Cinéma/Idéologie/Critique.’ Not only does Comolli and Narboni’s article inform the book’s title but also its theoretical trajectory. The duo once posed the maxim that ‘every film is political,’ insofar as ‘the political’ is an outgrowth of the ideology/ideological apparatuses which (pre)determine it. The next decade, the seventies, saw the rise of psychoanalytic film theories, spearheaded by Christian Metz, Laura Mulvey, and ‘Screen Theory’s’ emphasis on the Lacanian symbolic. Theory was granted an emancipatory prowess, allotting what Louis Althusser deemed the ‘knowledge effect,’ as theory held the unique position to cognize vis-a-vis the symbolic structure upon which cinema’s ideological immediacy was stilted, with the cinematic-imaginary galvanized vide the participatory and voyeuristic pleasures of viewership. Soon after came David Bordwell and Noël Carroll’s attempts to unshackle cinema studies from the tethers of ‘Grand Theories.’ This position fomented during the next two decades and is most explicitly elaborated in the 1996 anthology, Post- Theory: Reconstructing Film Studies. Consequently, ‘post-theory’ cinema scholars co-opted the piecemeal modalities familiar to analytic philosophy, wielding empirically based histories, narrative analyses and cognitivist proclivities, and postulating a means of philosophizing the moving image without the assignment of a priori political stakes. The depoliticized post-theory position has certainly been challenged in the following decades, with the robust return of psychoanalytic and Marxist renderings of film theory – one only needs to consult Slavoj Žižek or Joan Copjec’s expansive literature – and a groundswell of Deleuzean film philosophies and theorists. Nonetheless, even politically guided responses such as D.N. Rodowick’s do not regard cinema, in and of itself, as inherently political but, instead, affirm that politics is a commitment that corresponds to one’s methods and conclusions. Similarly, both Žižek and his adversary, Bordwell, relegate cinema to the side of the imaginary, using theory to explicate objects (i.e., films) while placing knowledge on the side of theory. Baumbach’s program is a response to these tendencies, as his book proposes that we cannot separate pleasures and affects, ideas about what cinema is and the politics of cinema any more than we can effectively unify them.\n\nAbstract: We can divide the society into two groups, one is the public group which is the general audience who has no right or the authority to make a film, the other group is the special one which is specializing in making the films. Governments however, are the ones and only main authority that can set ground rules for the special group, in order to limit the productions according to their needs, politically, economically, socially and so on. There are many major companies in the world, one of them is Hollywood which is the biggest one and located in the United States of America. Films have two effects on society, positive and negative one, the audience is responsible for both of them and can direct both of them under their own will. Since the government of the country has the main authority to direct the media, we will mention a brief look into my governmental impact which is the Iranian government on the films, which is in a way limited the products because of their strict rules. Films are produced according to many aspects, they are based on the culture of each country, and however, some countries try to influence their society by producing some movies that have some hidden ideas which is called the imperialism."
