        "text": "Sanchez: Leave SWAT in your rearview. Hondo: SWAT is where I belong.\n\nSergeant II Daniel \"Hondo\" Harrelson Jr. is the main protagonist of S.W.A.T. and leader of the 20-Squad S.W.A.T. (Special Weapons And Tactics) team of the Los Angeles Police Department (L.A.P.D.).\n\nHe's the title character portrayed by American actor, producer and former ''Criminal Minds'' star Shemar Moore.\n\nBiography[]\n\nA native of South Los Angeles, Daniel Harrelson was born to Daniel Harrelson, Sr. and Charice Harrelson; he also has a sister, Winnie. When he was a kid, his father left the family after falling in love with another woman and moved to Oakland, California, where he eventually had another daughter, Brianna. Hondo and his dad remained in touch.\n\nAs a kid, Hondo and two of his best friends Leroy Henderson (portrayed by Michael Beach) and Darryl, ran with a gang, but after Darryl's death, Hondo went to high school and eventually joined the force.\n\nA few months before Hondo graduated, he and his father witnessed the 1992 Los Angelos riots. While trying to get home safety, Hondo and Sr saw two black rioters pull a white man from his car and start attacking him. Despite Sr. attempts to keep Hondo in the car, Hondo jumped out the car and ran to intervene. This forced Sr. to also leave his car and help his son. They were able to stop the beating and get the man to the hospital where he was saved. Hondo was left in awe that he and Sr. managed to save someone's life. It's heavily implied that this helped influence his eventual path to the police force.\n\nAfter high school, Hondo enlisted in the United States Marine Corps (USMC). He served four years (1994 to 1998) with the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9th Marines) out of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and deployed to Somalia. Upon leaving the Marines, Hondo joined the Los Angeles Police Department (L.A.P.D.).\n\nHondo began his Los Angeles Police Department (L.A.P.D.) career as a patrol officer with the 77th Street Area. He served as a patrolman for six years before becoming a member of the Special Weapons And Tactics (S.W.A.T.) Team\n\nS.W.A.T stands for Special Weapons and Tactics. By 2016, he was serving as a Senior Lead Officer on Sergeant Buck Spivey's (Louis Ferreira) S.W.A.T. Team. He knows everyone in the neighborhood and treats them all with respect, which is why some of the usually police-distrusting South L.A. residents sometimes trust him with information pertinent to his cases. It is around this time that he had gone on his first date with Elle Trask who was an FBI Agent before her promotion to the District of Columbia. They later broke up the relationship after finding the long distance scenario to be too complicated which Hondo mentioned that he didn't end it too well.\n\nIn 2017, Hondo was unexpectedly promoted to Team Leader after Buck was fired for accidentally shooting an unarmed black teenager during a shootout. Senior team member Sergeant David Kay (Jay Harrington), who was next in the hierarchy after Buck, was overlooked in a blatant attempt to ease the tensions between the community and the Los Angeles Police Department (L.A.P.D.)\n\nFour months prior to the series, Hondo began a surreptitious romantic relationship with Captain Jessica Cortez (Stephanie Sigman), which, while frowned upon, is not expressly forbidden by Los Angeles Police Department (L.A.P.D.)policy. However, after his promotion to Team Leader, which put him directly under her command, the two struggle to keep their relationship secret. Hondo ultimately breaks up with her after they were caught by Commissioner Michael Plank (Peter Facinelli) in order to protect her career. He later starts a relationship with Nia Wells (Nikiva Dionne a Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney and recent divorcée, but the relationship is not serious and does not hold long after he told her that he had threatened to come after a man who he accused of drugging his younger half-sister, Briana, and possibly try to take advantage of her one night at a nightclub which was one of the reasons Nia decided to break oeers.\n\nNichelle Carmichael[]\n\nNichelle and Hondo meet in season 3. Soon, they feel attracted to each other and start a romantic relationship. Nichelle runs a youth center in South L. A. and is committed to supporting the children and teenagers who come there, wanting to motivate them towards better lives. Hondo and Nichelle break up eventually, due to Hondo's emotional and temporal unavailability due to his work. However, they get closer again after some time apart and become friends. Nichelle encourages Hondo to open up more and talk about his emotions, preventing that they wear him down. In season 5 they make up with each other and build a strong relationship. They also try to adopt a kid, and later to build their own family by trying to make a baby. In season 6, Hondo's girlfriend Nichelle is pregnant and have a daughter named Vivienne. At the end of season 6, he and Nichelle are now engaged after baptized to Vivian.\n\nDavid \"Deacon\" Kay[]\n\nHondo has a different relationship with Deacon than with the rest of his team. Deacon is his second in command and was supposed to be team leader after Buck instead of Hondo. Being openly overlooked he gnaws at Deacon for some time, even though he tries not to let on about it. In season 1, ep. 21 (\"Hunted\"), Hondo and Deacon have to escape from a group of shooters through a wild area and during that they get into a fight about Deacon's resentment, eventually managing to put it aside. Hondo respects Deacon and sometimes asks for his opinion about leadership decisions, which shows that Hondo sees Deacon is able to lead a team.\n\n20-David Special Weapons And Tactics (S.W.A.T.)Team[]\n\nHondo and the members of the S.W.A.T (Special Weapons and Tactics) team have a good relationship with each other. He keeps a special eye on the team youngsters, particularly Street and Chris. In the first two seasons, Hondo and Street get into disagreements about Street's impulsive and reckless attitude and about Street's mother, which culminates in Hondo banning Street from the S.W.A.T. team. However, after some time, Street apologizes for his behavior and Hondo helps to get him into the S.W.A.T. academy, thus offering Street a second chance. When it comes to Chris, Hondo relies on her to do a good job. He respects and honors her skills and treats her no different than the other team members, unlike other S.W.A.T. members who make jokes about her being the only woman. Hondo's relationship with Luca and Tan is not particularly highlighted, but it is clear that they also have a very good contact. Hondo is an understanding and supportive team leader but is also well able to tell them off strongly. It is shown that the team members act slightly different with Hondo as their boss around than when they are alone, but in general they have a very amicable and honest policy in their entire team.\n\nRobert \"Bob\" Hicks[]\n\nHondo and Hicks don't have a good relationship at first, as the former only sees him as someone who \"covered his ass\" by firing Buck and the latter doesn't see him as a leader for a SWAT team, but during Radical, Hicks reveals that it was Buck who wanted to be fired and that he tried to talk him out of it. After this the relationship between them improves and they are seen supporting each other to the point that in Next of Kin Hondo declares to Lynch that if Hicks doesn't stay Hondo will leave and go to the Times to talk about the real problems of the police.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nS.W.A.T.: Season 1 (22/22) \"Pilot\": \"Cuchillo\": \"Radical\": \"Pamilya\": \"Octane\": \"Imposters\": \"Homecoming\": \"Miracle\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Blindspots\": \"Seizure\": \"K-Town\": \"Contamination\": \"Fences\": \"Ghosts\": \"Crews\": \"Payback\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Armory\": \"Patrol\": \"Source\": \"Vendetta\": \"Hunted\": \"Hoax\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears\n\nS.W.A.T.: Season 2 (23/23) \"Shaky Town\": \"Gasoline Drum\": \"Fire and Smoke\": \"Saving Face\": \"S.O.S.\": \"Never Again\": \"Inheritance\": \"The Tiffany Experience\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Day Off\": \"1000 Joules\": \"School\": \"Los Huesos\": \"Encore\": \"The B-Team\": \"Fallen\": \"Pride\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Jack\": \"Cash Flow\": \"Invisible\": \"Rocket Fuel\": \"Day of Dread\": \"Trigger Creep\": \"Kangaroo\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears\n\nS.W.A.T.: Season 3 (21/21) \"Fire in the Sky\": \"Bad Faith\": \"Funny Money\": \"Immunity\": \"The LBC\": \"Kingdom\": \"Track\": \"Lion's Den\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Sea Legs\": \"Monster\": \"Bad Cop\": \"Good Cop\": \"Ekitai Rashku\": \"Animus\": \"Knockout\": \"Gunpowder Treason\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Hotel L.A.\": \"Stigma\": \"Vice\": \"Wild Ones\": \"Diablo\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears\n\nS.W.A.T.: Season 4 (18/18) \"3 Seventeen Year Olds\": \"Stakeout\": \"The Black Hand Man\": \"Memento Mori\": \"Fracture\": \"Hopeless Sinner\": \"Under Fire\": \"Crusade\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Next of Kin\": \"Buried\": \"Positive Thinking\": \"U-Turn\": \"Sins of the Fathers\": \"Reckoning\": \"Local Heroes\": \"Lockdown\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Whistleblower\": \"Veritas Vincint\": Appears Appears\n\nS.W.A.T.: Season 5 (22/22) \"Vagabundo\": \"Madrugada\": \"27 David\": \"Sentinel\": \"West Coast Offense\": \"Crisis Actor\": \"Keep the Faith\": \"Safe House\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Survive\": \"Three Guns\": \"Old School Cool\": \"Provenance\": \"Short Fuse\": \"Albatross\": \"Donor\": \"The Fugitive\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Cry Foul\": \"Family\": \"Incoming\": \"Quandary\": \"Zodiac\": \"Farewell\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears\n\nS.W.A.T.: Season 6 (22/22) \"Thai Hard\": \"Thai Another Day\": \"Woah Black Betty\": \"Maniak\": \"Unraveling\": \"Checkmate\": \"Sequel\": \"Guacaine\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Pariah\": \"Witness\": \"Atonement\": \"Addicted\": \"Lion's Share\": \"Gut Punch\": \"To Protect and to Serve\": \"Blowback\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Stockholm\": \"Genesis\": \"Bunkies\": \"All That Glitters\": \"Forget Shorty\": \"Legacy\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears\n\nS.W.A.T.: Season 7 (13/13) \"The Promise\": \"Peace Talks\": \"Good for Nothing\": \"Spare Parts\": \"End of the Road\": \"Escape\": \"Last Call\": \"Family Man\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears \"Honeytrap\": \"SNAFU\": \"Whispers\": \"Allegiance\": \"Twenty Squad\": Appears Appears Appears Appears Appears\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis series marks Shemar Moore's fourth consecutive leading role on a network television series following The Young and the Restless, Birds of Prey and Criminal Minds.\n\nShemar Moore also serves as executive-producer on the series.\n\nIn Cuchillo, it is implied that Hondo has a fear of snakes (ophidiophobia)"
