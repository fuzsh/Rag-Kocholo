        "text": "July 18, 2007\n\nGoRedbirds.com: You were born in Atlanta, Ga. How did you end up in Illinois?\n\nTiffany Hudson: My parents decided to move here because my mom's family lives in Illinois as well as my dad's family. They actually moved to Atlanta before they had me, and then I was born and four years later we moved back to Illinois.\n\nGR: Was basketball your favorite sport growing up or did you have other sports interests?\n\nTH: I never really did any other sports. I took dance class and gymnastics, but sports wise it was just basketball.\n\nGR: Who is your favorite NBA or WNBA team?\n\nTH: My favorite team in the WNBA would be the Sacramento Monarchs, and for NBA I'm going to have to go with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nGR: Who did you root for in the NBA Finals, the San Antonio Spurs or Cleveland Cavaliers?\n\nTH: The Cavaliers for sure, because I like LeBron James. They were the underdogs and I like rooting for the underdogs.\n\nGR: Where can you be found when not in the gym?\n\nTH: I can be found relaxing, sleeping and hanging out with my friends. I like to shop and go to movies and I also like hanging out at the pool.\n\nGR: If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you?\n\nTH: Oh, that's a tough one. Sanaa Lathan, Jada Pinkett Smith or Nia Long. Those are my three favorite actresses.\n\nGR: What are your goals for the 2007-2008 basketball season?\n\nTH: Obviously we want to make it to the NCAA tournament again, so that's a big goal. I want to make it to the post season, and to have a successful season. Usually that is measured by having 20 or more wins, but just being successful and playing to the best of our ability is the biggest goal.\n\nGR: You are majoring in public relations. What do you want to do with your degree after you graduate?\n\nTH: I want to go into corporate public relations. I grew up around the corporate world because both my parents work in the corporate world. So, I think that is something I would enjoy doing. Or I would like to work in sports administration public relations, possibly representing a sport company.\n\nGR: If you were able to have an abundance of money for a day, what would you do with it?\n\nTH: I would take my family, friends, coaches and teammates out and splurge on food and clothes.\n\nGR: Chili's or Applebee's?\n\nTH: Chili's.\n\nGR: Do you have any nicknames?\n\nTH: Tiff, T-Hud and T-Stud. My friends call me T and my coaches call me Tiffer.\n\nGR: What is your favorite thing to do when you get to go back home?\n\nTH: Spend time with my family. I miss my family a lot. I'm a big family person, so spending time with my mom and dad and my brothers, and seeing my friends that I grew up with. I don't get to see them a lot so I also love doing that.\n\nGR: Favorite on-campus food option?\n\nTH: I would say the food court at Watterson Towers. I used be to a big Chatters fan, but I kind of got over that. Watterson is always a good place to eat.\n\nGR: You have three brothers. Did they teach you any moves that you use on the court?\n\nTH: Not really. They're younger than me, so I pretty much taught them how to play.\n\nGR: What is your favorite memory of ISU basketball?\n\nTH: Making it to the 2005 NCAA tournament is by far the best memory so far.\n\nGR: Are there any superstitions or rituals that the team takes part in?\n\nTH: We pretty much do the same thing every game. I don't know if there are any specific things, but we all pretty much do the same routines before each game.\n\nGR: Favorite pizza?\n\nTH: I'm a big Home Run Inn fan and a Giordano's fan, but neither of those places are in Bloomington-Normal. In general, I like any sausage and pepperoni pizza.\n\nGR: What is the best advice you have ever been given.\n\nTH: Something that coach Pingeton always preaches to us is that everything you do will affect your life. She talks about what you do on the basketball court crosses over to the classroom and to give your best every time and never hold back. Basically, give 100 percent of what you've got 100 percent of the time.\n\nGR: What music are you listening to right now?\n\nTH: Everything! I love all types of music. R&B, rap, neo soul and acoustic. In my CD player right now I'm listening to Bobby Valentino."
