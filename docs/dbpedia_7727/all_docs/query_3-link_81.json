        "text": "Billy Ray Cyrus has quite a talented family.\n\nAfter marrying then-wife Tish Cyrus in 1993, the country singer adopted Tish's two children, Brandi, 37, and Trace, 35. The couple then welcomed three more kids during their nearly 30-year marriage: Miley, 31, Braison, 30, and Noah, 24. Billy Ray also shares son Christopher Cody, 32, with Kristen Luckey, whom he dated before meeting Tish. Out of his six children, the majority have pursued musical careers — daughters Miley and Noah have been nominated for Grammys.\n\nIn April 2022, Billy Ray and Tish announced their divorce in a joint statement to PEOPLE. At the time, they emphasized the importance of family. \"It is after 30 years, five amazing children and a lifetime of memories, we have decided to go our separate ways — not with sadness, but with love in our hearts,\" they said. \"We have grown up together, raised a family we can be so proud of, and it is now time to create our own paths.\"\n\n\"We will always be family and look forward to a continued and loving shared experience as friends and parents,\" they added.\n\nA few months after the divorce, Billy Ray confirmed his engagement to Australian singer Firerose in November 2022. The couple originally met on the lot where Hannah Montana was filmed and became friends. Billy Ray proposed to the singer in August 2022.\n\nThe Busy Man singer told PEOPLE that \"there's no hard feelings\" between him and his family regarding the engagement.\n\n\"Everyone knew that that relationship was over a long time ago,\" he said, referring to his marriage to ex-wife Tish. \"Everybody's turning the page.\"\n\nTish is now engaged to actor Dominic Purcell.\n\nHere's everything to know about Billy Ray Cyrus' six children.\n\nBrandi Cyrus, 37\n\nOn May 26, 1987, Tish welcomed daughter Brandi Cyrus with then-husband Baxter Neal Helson. Six years later, Brandi was adopted by Billy Ray following his wedding to Tish.\n\nBrandi began riding horses at a young age and credits Billy Ray with helping her become an equestrian. In January 2021, she told World Equestrian Center, \"I have been riding horses since I was 6 years old. I was very fortunate that, when my dad got his record deal in the early 90s, he took his money and bought a ton of land in Tennessee, so I grew up on a horse farm. My dad put me on a horse and just said, 'Have at it.' It was a hold on and figure it out kind of thing and I spent almost every day riding on the property with him.\"\n\nAlong with being an equestrian, Brandi is a successful DJ; co-hosts two podcasts, Your Favorite Things Podcast and Sorry We're Stoned; and has a style blog called Style Native.\n\nTrace Cyrus, 35\n\nTrace Cyrus was born on Feb. 24, 1989, to Tish and Helson.
