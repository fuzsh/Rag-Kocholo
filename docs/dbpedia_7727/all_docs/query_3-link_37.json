I am a first-generation college graduate and I grew up in San Ysidro, CA. I have three fur babies and I also enjoy being outdoors. Anything from nature walks, hikes, kayaking, swimming etc. I truly love it.\n\nI graduated from CSU Chico with a B.A. in Sociology and Spanish in 2015. I was part of the Educational Opportunity Program and participated in Summer Bridge in 2010. As an undergrad student I had the opportunity to join a multicultural organization, Lambda Theta Nu which allowed me to have a strong community and enhance my leadership skills with my involvement outside of the classroom. In addition, I was also able to study abroad for a full academic year in Madrid, Spain. The best part about my study abroad experience was that financial aid was able to fund this amazing opportunity. Through my different experiences, I knew I wanted to go back to San Diego to pay it forward and empower students to pursue higher education and help students take advantage of all the opportunities and free resources available to them.\n\nAfter I graduated from CSU Chico, I attended graduate school and earned a Masters degree in Postsecondary Educational Leadership with a Specialization in Student Affairs from San Diego State University in 2018.

My participation in summer bridge helped me combat imposter syndrome and gain a sense of belonging on the campus. EOP gave me a home away from home. I am passionate about playing a key role in supporting EOP students by providing them with the tools, guidance and most importantly the agency to make empowered decisions while attending San Diego State University.\n\nCharnise Bumpus is a proud Southeast San Diego native.
