        "text": "The University of Colorado Boulder has appointed a new director of the Center of the American West to replace founding director Patty Limerick, who was abruptly fired in 2022.\n\nThomas Andrews, a CU Boulder history professor, was appointed to the position effective July 1. The decision was made public Wednesday.\n\n“I’m excited and I’m honored,” Andrews said. “I’m really looking forward to taking the center forward and building on the excellent work it’s been doing for quite a long time and trying to solidify the center’s place at CU Boulder for years to come.”\n\nAndrews was born and raised in Boulder. He graduated from Fairview High School in 1990 before earning his bachelor’s degree at Yale and his master’s and doctoral degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Before joining the CU Boulder history department in 2011, he taught at CU Denver.\n\nThe Center of the American West is a hub for showing the role of the western United States in regional, national and global issues. It has a history of bringing people together to explore the ongoing complexities and challenges facing the western United States through education, research, programs and projects.\n\nThe center was founded by Limerick in 1986. Limerick was suddenly fired as director of the Center in 2022, which sparked outrage from her colleagues and fellow historians and academics.\n\nIn 2023, more than 300 professors signed a letter criticizing the CU Boulder administration for firing Limerick. Limerick maintains her position as a tenured history professor at CU Boulder and said she still does not know the reason for her sudden dismissal.\n\n“Patty Limerick is a brilliant scholar, a giant in western American history, and one of the nation’s foremost advocates for public-facing humanities, which we need now more than ever,” Andrews said. “She has made immense contributions to the center and CU Boulder, and I am deeply honored to be following in her footsteps.”\n\nCU Boulder history professor Tom Zeiler was appointed the interim director of the Center following Limerick’s firing. Andrews said Zeiler has helped by working with the staff to stabilize the center, and it is and continues to be a big transition following Limerick’s removal.\n\n“What we’re really looking to do from here on out is build and develop and move forward,” Andrews said.\n\nIn the next year, the Center of the American West is planning several events Andrews hopes will draw people in from Boulder. He wants to grow the center’s certificate program and continue its Indigenous Connections project with the National Park Service.\n\nAndrews is one of only a handful of second-generation faculty members at CU Boulder. His mother was a research librarian at the Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research, and his father joined the same institute and the geological sciences department. Now, his father is an emeritus faculty member.\n\n“Professor Andrews is an exceedingly skilled and respected historian who has helped broaden and deepen our understanding of the history of the American West,” Daryl Maeda, the interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, said in a release. “The Center of the American West makes critical contributions to national thought and discourse about the American West, and Professor Andrews is particularly well suited to stand at its helm.”"
