The two had a son named Trey.\n\nWill and Sheree got divorced in 1995, and Will and Jada started dating that same year.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Access, Jada said that Will reached out to her when he was separated from Sheree before their divorce was finalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecember 31, 1997: The pair walked down the aisle on New Year's Eve.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1997, Will and Jada were married in a private ceremony at the Cloisters Mansion near Jada's hometown of Baltimore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 8, 1998: Their son Jaden was born.\n\nIn 1998, Jada and Will's oldest son Jaden was born.\n\nToday, Jaden is a rapper and actor who's known for his head-turning outfits.\n\nJaden even acted alongside his dad, playing his on-screen son in \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" and \"After Earth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctober 31, 2000: The couple welcomed their daughter, Willow.\n\nIn October 2000, Will and Jada's family grew with the birth of their daughter, Willow.\n\nShe followed her family into the entertainment industry and made a name for herself in the music scene with her 2010 single \"Whip My Hair.\"\n\nShe was also featured in \"I Am Legend\" alongside her father, and she voiced Baby Gloria in \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" alongside her mother.\n\nWillow cohosts the Facebook Watch show \"Red Table Talk\" with her mother and grandmother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAugust 23, 2011: The couple squashed reports that Jada was cheating on Will with Marc Anthony.\n\nIn 2011, reports began to circulate that Will and Jada were headed for divorce.\n\nPer Us Weekly, an unnamed source from the set of Jada's TNT drama series \"HawthoRNe\" suggested that the actress was having an affair with her on-screen love interest, Marc Anthony.\n\nAnthony and his now ex-wife Jennifer Lopez were divorcing at the time, and observers noticed him getting closer to Jada.\n\nPer \"Today,\" Will and Jada put out a joint response denying the reports.\n\n\"Although we are reluctant to respond to these types of press reports, the rumors circulating about our relationship are completely false. We are still together, and our marriage is intact,\" the statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAugust 3, 2015: Will took to Facebook to deny another round of divorce rumors.\n\nWhen more rumors started to circulate about the Smiths' marital troubles in 2015, Will took to Facebook to deny that he and Jada were getting divorced.\n\nPart of the post read, \"I promise you all — if I ever decide to divorce my Queen — I SWEAR I'll tell you myself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016: Will and Jada separated.\n\nIn a recent interview with People, Jada said that she and Will were separated for six years before the famous \"slap\" incident at the 2022 Oscars.\n\n\"We're still figuring it out,\" she told the publication.\"We've been doing some really heavy-duty work together. We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\"\n\nIn a clip for an upcoming October prime-time interview with NBC News' Hoda Kotb, the star further explained that they are still legally married but have been living \"completely separate lives\" since 2016.\n\n\"By the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying,\" Jada said, later adding that she's considered divorce but hasn't gone through with it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMay 7, 2018: Jada hashed it out with Will's ex.\n\nOn a Mother's Day episode of her Facebook Watch series \"Red Table Talk,\" Jada sat down with Zampino, Will's ex-wife.\n\nJada admitted that she thought it was wrong that she got involved with Will while he was still technically married to Zampino. But the two agreed to leave their bad feelings in the past, and in a tearful exchange, Zampino thanked Jada for her role in co-parenting Trey.\n\n\"Thank you for loving my baby,\" Zampino said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 2018: Will said that he and Jada are \"life partners.\"\n\nDuring a 2018 appearance on Tidal's \"RapRadar\" podcast, Will opened up about his relationship with Jada.\n\n\"We don't even say we're married anymore. We refer to ourselves as life partners, where you get into that space where you realize you are literally with somebody for the rest of your life,\" he said. \"There's no deal breakers. There's nothing she could do — ever. Nothing that would break our relationship.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 10, 2020: Will and Jada talked about Jada's extramarital relationship on \"Red Table Talk.\"\n\nAfter rapper August Alsina claimed that he'd had an affair with Jada in 2015, Jada invited Will to appear on \"Red Table Talk.\"\n\nThe couple explained what really happened — they'd been formally separated in 2015 when Jada had her \"entanglement\" with Alsina — and opened up about how they got through this period of their marriage.\n\nUltimately, Jada said the couple has \"really gotten to that new place of unconditional love.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeptember 27, 2021: Will said that their marriage is no longer monogamous.\n\nIn a recent interview for the November cover of GQ, Will told the publication that at one point in their marriage, he and Jada decided they would no longer be monogamous.\n\n\"We have given each other trust and freedom, with the belief that everybody has to find their own way,\" he said.\n\n\"And marriage for us can't be a prison. And I don't suggest our road for anybody. I don't suggest this road for anybody. But the experiences that the freedoms that we've given one another and the unconditional support, to me, is the highest definition of love.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctober 11, 2023: Jada spoke about the \"slap\" for the first time.\n\nIn the same recent interview with People, Jada publicly opened up about the Oscar slap incident for the first time.\n\n\"I thought, 'This is a skit,'\" she told the publication. \"I was like, 'There's no way that Will hit him.\"\n\nShe continued, \"It wasn't until Will started to walk back to his chair that I even realized it wasn't a skit.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on September 12, 2018, and most recently updated on October 11, 2023.\n\nRead next\n\nRelationship Will Smith\n\nAdvertisement"
