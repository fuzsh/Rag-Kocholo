        "text": "November 24, 2006 at 1:09 pm | Posted in Books, Globalization, History, Philosophy, Research | Leave a comment\n\nCarl Schmitt\n\nJuly 11, 1888 – April 7, 1985\n\nCarl Schmitt (July 11, 1888 – April 7, 1985) was a German jurist, political theorist, and professor of law.\n\nSchmitt was born the son of a small businessman in Plettenberg, Westphalia on July 11, 1888; he studied political science and law in Berlin, Munich and Strasbourg and took his graduation and state exams in the then-German Strasbourg in 1915.\n\nHe became professor at the University of Berlin in 1933, the same year that he entered the Nazi party (NSDAP). Schmitt remained a party member until the end of the war, and never recanted his party membership. His ideas continue to attract the attention of several philosophers and political theorists, including Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, and Chantal Mouffe.\n\nWritings\n\nOn Dictatorship (1921)\n\nIn 1921, Schmitt became a professor at the University of Greifswald, where he published his essay “Die Diktatur“\n\n(“On Dictatorship“), in which he discussed the\n\nfoundations of the newly-established Weimar Republic,\n\nemphasising the office of the Reichspräsident.\n\nFor Schmitt, a strong dictatorship could embody the will of the people more effectively\n\nthan any legislative body, as it can be decisive, whereas parliaments inevitably involve discussion and compromise:\n\n“If the constitution of a state is democratic, then every exceptional negation of democratic principles, every exercise of state power independent of the approval of the majority, can be called dictatorship.”\n\nFor Schmitt, every government capable of decisive action must include a dictatorial element within its constitution. Although the German concept of Ausnahmezustand is best translated as state of emergency, it literally means state of exception, which Schmitt contends frees the executive from any legal restraints to its power that would normally apply. The use of the term “exceptional” has to be\n\nunderlined here: Schmitt defines sovereignty as the power to decide the instauration of state of exception, as Giorgio Agamben has noted. According to Agamben, Schmitt’s conceptualization of\n\nthe “state of exception” as belonging to the core-concept of sovereignty was a response to Walter Benjamin‘s concept of a “pure” or “revolutionary” violence, which didn’t enter into any relationship whatsoever with right. Through the state of exception, Carl Schmitt included all types of violence under right, linking right & life (zoe) together, and thus transforming the juridical system into a “death machine”, creating an Homo sacer.\n\nSchmitt opposed what he called “chief constable dictature”, or the\n\ndeclaration of a state of emergency in order to save the legal order (a temporary\n\nsuspension of law, defined itself by moral or legal right): the state of emergency is\n\nlimited (even if a posteriori, by law), to “sovereign dictature”, in\n\nwhich law was suspended, as in the classical state of exception, not to “save the Constitution“, but rather to create another\n\nConstitution. This is how he theorized Hitler‘s continual\n\nsuspension of the legal constitutional order during the Third\n\nReich (The Weimar Republic‘s Constitution was\n\nnever abrogated, underlined Giorgio Agamben; rather, it was “suspended” for four years first at February 28, 1933 Reichstag Fire Decree and the suspension was\n\nrenewed every four years similar to a – continual – state of emergency).\n\nPolitical Theology (1922)\n\nThis was followed by another essay in 1922, titled “Politische Theologie” (“Political Theology“); in it,\n\nSchmitt, who at the time was working as a professor at the University of Bonn, gave further substance to his authoritarian theories, effectively denying free will based on a catholic world view. The book begins with Schmitt’s famous, or notorious, definition: “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” By “exception,” Schmitt means the appropriate moment for stepping outside the rule of law in the public interest. (See discussion of “On Dictatorship,” above.) Schmitt opposes this definition to those offered by contemporary theorists of sovereignty,\n\nparticularly Hans Kelsen, whose work is criticized at\n\nseveral points in the essay.\n\nThe book’s title derives from Schmitt’s assertion (in chapter 3) that “all\n\nsignificant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological\n\nconcepts” — in other words, that political theory addresses the state\n\n(and sovereignty) in much the same manner as theology does God.\n\nAnother year later, Schmitt supported the emergence of totalitarian\n\npower structures in his paper “Die geistesgeschichtliche Lage des heutigen Parlamentarismus” (roughly: “The Intellectual-Historical Situation of Today’s Parliamentarianism“, translated as The\n\nCrisis of Parliamentary Democracy by Ellen Kennedy). Schmitt criticized the institutional practices of liberal politics, arguing that they are justified by a faith in rational discussion and openness that is at odds with actual parliamentary party politics, in which outcomes are hammered out in smoke-filled rooms by party leaders. Schmitt also posits an essential division between the liberal doctrine of separation of powers and what he holds to be the nature of democracy itself, the identity of the rulers and the ruled. Although many critics of Schmitt today take exception to his fundamentally authoritarian outlook, the notion that there is an incompatibility between liberalism and democracy is one reason why his work is of continued interest to students of political philosophy.\n\nThe Concept of the Political\n\nSchmitt changed universities in 1926, when he became professor\n\nfor law at the Hochschule für Politik in Berlin, and again in 1932, when he accepted a position in Cologne. It\n\nwas in Cologne, too, that he wrote his most famous paper, “Der Begriff des\n\nPolitischen” (“The Concept of the Political”), in which he developed a\n\ntheory of a specific domain of interest, called “the political”. This concept\n\ngives the state its own area of predominance, just as churches are predominant in religion\n\nor society is predominant in economics. Schmitt, in perhaps his best-known formulation,\n\nbases his conceptual realm of state sovereignty and autonomy upon the distinction between friend\n\nand enemy. This distinction is to be determined “existentially,” which is\n\nto say that the enemy is whoever is “in a specially intense way, existentially\n\nsomething different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are\n\npossible.” (Schmitt, 1996, p. 27) Such an enemy need not even be based on\n\nnationality: so long as the conflict is potentially intense enough to become a violent one\n\nbetween political entities, the actual substance of enmity may be anything. Although there\n\nhave been divergent interpretations offered of this work, there is broad agreement that “The Concept of the Political” is an attempt to achieve state unity by defining the\n\ncontent of politics as opposition to a foreign “other,” and also through the\n\npreeminence of the state, which stands as a neutral force over potentially fractious civil\n\nsociety, whose various antagonisms must not be allowed to reach the level of the\n\npolitical, lest civil war result.\n\nThe case “Preussen contra Reich”\n\nApart from his academic functions, in 1932 Schmitt was counsel for the Reich government\n\nin the case “Preussen contra Reich” wherein the SPD-led government of the state\n\nof Prussia disputed its dismissal by the right-wing von Papen government. Papen was motivated to make this\n\nmove because Prussia, by far the largest state in Germany,\n\nserved as a powerful base upon which the political left could draw, and also provided them\n\nwith institutional power, particularly in the form of the Prussian Police. One of the\n\ncounsel for the Prussian government was Hermann\n\nHeller. In German history, this struggle leading to the de facto destruction of\n\nfederalism in the Weimar republic is known as the ‘Preußenschlag’.\n\nInfluence\n\nThrough Giorgio Agamben, Chantal Mouffe and other writers, Carl Schmitt has become a common reference in recent writings of the intellectual left as well as the right. This debate concerns not only the interpretation of Schmitt’s own positions, but also matters relevant to contemporary politics: the idea that laws of the state cannot strictly limit actions of its sovereign; the problem of a “state of exception“, etc.\n\nSchmitt’s influence has also recently been seen as consequential for those interested in contemporary political theology, which is much influenced by Schmitt’s argument that political concepts are secularized theological concepts. The German-Jewish philosopher Jacob Taubes, for example, engaged Schmitt widely in his study of Saint Paul, The Political Theology of Paul (Stanford Univ. Press, 2004). Taubes’ understanding of political theology is, however, very different from Schmitt’s, and emphasizes the political aspect of theological claims, rather than the religious derivation of political claims.\n\nNazi complicity\n\nCarl Schmitt, who became a professor at the University of Berlin in 1933 (a position he held until the end of World War II) joined the NSDAP on May 1, 1933; he quickly was appointed\n\n“Preußischer Staatsrat” by Hermann\n\nGöring and became the president of the “Vereinigung nationalsozialistischer\n\nJuristen” (“Union of National-Socialist Jurists”) in November. He thought his theories as an ideological foundation of the Nazi\n\ndictatorship, and a justification of the “Führer“\n\nstate with regard to legal philosophy, in particular through the concept of auctoritas.\n\nHalf a year later, in June 1934, Schmitt became editor in\n\nchief for the professional newspaper “Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung“\n\n(“German Jurists’ Newspaper”); in July 1934, he\n\njustified the political murders of the Night\n\nof the Long Knives as the “highest form of administrative justice”\n\n(“höchste Form administrativer Justiz“).\n\nSchmitt presented himself as a radical anti-semite and also was the chairman of a law teachers’ convention in Berlin in\n\nOctober 1936, where he demanded that German law be cleansed of\n\nthe “Jewish spirit” (“jüdischem Geist“), going so far as to demand that all publications by Jewish scientists should henceforth be marked with a small symbol. Nevertheless, two months later, in December, the SS\n\npublication “Das schwarze Korps” accused Schmitt of being an opportunist, a Hegelian state thinker and basically a Catholic, and called his anti-semitism a mere pretense, citing earlier statements in which he criticised the Nazi‘s racial theories. After this, Schmitt lost most of his prominent offices, and retreated\n\nfrom his position as a leading Nazi jurist, although he\n\nretained his post as a professor in Berlin thanks to Göring.\n\nPost World War II life\n\nIn 1945, Schmitt was captured by the American\n\nforces; after spending more than a year in an internment camp, he returned to his home\n\ntown of Plettenberg following his release in 1946, and later to the house of his housekeeper Anni Stand in\n\nPlettenberg-Pasel. Despite being isolated in the mainstream scholarly and political\n\ncommunity, he continued his studies especially of international\n\nlaw from the 1950s on, and he received a never-ending stream\n\nof visitors, both colleagues and younger intellectuals, until well into his old age. Among\n\nthese visitors, important are Ernst Jünger, Jacob Taubes, and Alexandre\n\nKojève. Schmitt died on April 7, 1985\n\nand is buried in Plettenberg.\n\nLegacy\n\nDespite recent apologies for Schmitt’s conduct during the Nazi era – no such apologies were issued by Schmitt himself during\n\nhis lifetime – Schmitt, along with the early Heidegger, lent\n\nhis considerable authority to the Nazi regime, and played a leading role in constructing\n\nthe legal basis that justified its seizure of power.\n\nIt seems unlikely that a political mind as insightful as Schmitt’s could have been\n\nmistaken about the true nature of the NSDAP and its leadership.\n\nSchmitt clearly favored a strong, even dictatorial executive.\n\nSome have wondered whether he was looking forward to the Führer regime of Hitler or backward to the authoritarian regime of Otto von Bismarck. However, Schmitt showed only contempt in Die\n\nDiktatur (1921) for the “chief constable dictature”, to which he opposed\n\n“sovereign dictature”.\n\nIt may be called one of the many ironies of Schmitt’s story that, at the very\n\nmoment of Nazi triumph, he decisively declared his support for a regime that ultimately\n\nhad little use for someone like him. Yet the fact remains that Schmitt tried to use his\n\nstatus within the NS Party to make himself the foremost authority in his field in Nazi\n\nGermany.\n\nSee also\n\nCommand\n\nresponsibility\n\nGiorgio Agamben\n\nWalter Benjamin\n\nMartin Heidegger\n\nHermann\n\nHeller\n\nHans Kelsen\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Return of Carl\n\nSchmitt by Scott Horton Balkinization 7 November 2005 — discusses the\n\ncontinuing influence of Schmitt’s legal theories in modern American politics\n\nFocus on the International Theory of Carl Schmitt in the LeidenJournal of International Law (LJIL).

He became State Secretary at the Reich Ministry of Justice and President of the Volksgerichtshof, a court handling political\n\ncrimes.\n\nIn contrast to most of the Nazi leadership, little beyond basic details is known about\n\nRoland Freisler the man. He was born in Celle, the son of an\n\nengineer, and saw active service during World War I: he\n\nwas an officer cadet in 1914, and by 1915\n\nhe was a lieutenant and was decorated before becoming a prisoner\n\nof war in Russia in October 1915. While interned in Russia, he learned the language\n\nand developed an interest in Marxism. He returned to Germany\n\nin 1920 a fanatical Communist to\n\nstudy law at Jena University, becoming a Doctor of Law in 1922. From 1924 he worked as a lawyer in Kassel and also as a city councilor for the Völkisch-Social bloc.\n\nHe joined the Nazi Party in July 1925.\n\nDuring this period, he served as defense counsel for members of the nascent Party who got\n\ninto trouble with the law. He was also a delegate to the Prussian Landtag, or state\n\nlegislature, and later he became a member of the Reichstag.\n\nIn 1927 the Gauleiter of the Gau\n\nKurhessen characterized Freisler in the following manner: “Rhetorically he is equal\n\nto our best speakers, if not superior to them. Particularly on the broad masses, he has\n\ninfluence, but thinking people mostly reject him deep down. Party Comrade Freisler is only\n\nusable as a speaker. He is unsuitable for any leadership post, since he is unreliable and\n\nis a moody person.”\n\nIn 1933 and 1934 he was State Secretary in the Prussian Ministry of Justice, and in the\n\nReich Ministry of Justice between 1934 and 1942; he represented the latter at the Wannsee Conference, where he stood in for Franz Schlegelberger.\n\nHis absolute mastery of legal texts, mental agility and overwhelming verbal force\n\njelled with strict adherence to the party line and the corresponding misanthropic ideology, so that he became the most feared\n\njudge and the personification of the Nazis’ “blood justice.” Despite his\n\nundisputed legal competence, he could not rise further. According to Uwe Wesel, this can be attributed\n\nto two factors:\n\nFreisler was regarded as a lone fighter and had no influential patron at his disposal who could have championed him.\n\nIn the eyes of the Nazi elite, Freisler was compromised by his brother Oswald’s rise to prominence. Oswald Freislercommitted offense against the party line appearing as defense counsel, in politically\n\nsignificant trials which the Nazi regime sought to debase for propaganda purposes. In so\n\ndoing, he wore his Nazi Party badge in a clearly visible way, which made an unambiguous\n\ninterpretation of the party’s position more difficult. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels accordingly reproved Roland Freisler and\n\nreported the incident to Hitler, who, for his part, decreed the immediate exclusion of\n\nOswald Freisler from the party.\n\nOn August 20, 1942, Hitler\n\npromoted Otto Thierack to Reich Justice Minister and\n\nnamed Freisler to succeed Thierack as president of the Volksgerichtshof\n\n(“People’s Court”). This court had jurisdiction over a rather broad array of\n\n“political offenses”, which included crimes like black marketeering, work\n\nslowdowns, and defeatism. These crimes were viewed by Freisler’s court as Wehrkraftzersetzung (“destruction of defensive\n\ncapability”) and were accordingly punished severely, the death penalty being\n\nmeted out in numerous cases.\n\nThe number of death sentences rose sharply under Freisler’s stewardship. Approximately\n\n90% of all proceedings ended with sentences of death or life imprisonment, the sentences\n\nfrequently having been determined before the trial. Between 1942 and 1945 more than 5000\n\ndeath sentences were handed out, and of these, 2600 through the court’s First Senate,\n\nwhich Freisler headed. Thus, Freisler alone was responsible, in his three years on the\n\ncourt, for as many death sentences as all other senate sessions of the court together in\n\nthe entire time the court existed, between 1934 and 1945.\n\nFreisler acted as judge, prosecutor and jury all embodied in a single person. He was\n\nparticularly known for humiliating defendants and barking loudly at them. A number of the\n\ntrials for defendants in the July 20 plot before the\n\nPeople’s Court were filmed and recorded. In the 1944 trial against Wilhelm Graf Schwerin von\n\nSchwanenfeld, for example, Freisler screamed so loudly, the technicians who were\n\nfilming the proceeding had major problems making the defendants’ words audible. Count\n\nSchwerin, like many other defendants in the plot, was sentenced to death by hanging. Among this and other show trials, Freisler headed the 1943\n\nproceedings against the members of the “White Rose” resistance group.\n\nFreisler chaired the First Senate of the People’s Court. Insofar as he led the\n\nproceedings, he designated himself as court reporter. That way, he was also responsible\n\nfor the composition of written grounds for the sentences, that he wrote up in his own\n\nunique fashion, namely in accordance with his own notions of a “National Socialist\n\ncriminal court.” Meanwhile, he introduced judgment advisories with remarks like\n\n“Off with his head,” and “The beet must be uprooted,” and so forth.\n\nDuring an Allied air raid on Berlin on February 3, 1945, Freisler was fatally struck by a beam in the cellar of the\n\ncourthouse. His body was found crushed beneath a fallen masonry column, clutching the file\n\non anti-Hitler conspirator Fabian von\n\nSchlabrendorff.\n\nTrivia\n\nFreisler has been portrayed by screen actors at least four times: by Rainer Steffen in the 1984 German television movie Wannseekonferenz,by Brian Cox in the British 1996 television movie Witness\n\nAgainst Hitler, by Owen Teale in the 2001 BBC/HBO film Conspiracy, and by André Hennicke in the 2005 film Sophie Scholl – Die letzten\n\nTage.\n\nSee also\n\nHans-Joachim Rehse\n\nHans Frank\n\nCarl Schmitt\n\nOtto Georg Thierack\n\nAnna Freisler"
