        "text": "Some theorists argue that religion relates to politics in one of two ways: either it asserts its authority over the public sphere, or it withdraws from the world in preference for spiritual concerns. Against those who appropriate divine authority in support of a given regime, Jewish and Christian negative theology argues that God is radically elusive. Where resistance movements sometimes struggle to transition from opposition to governance, negative theology models a critique that allows for robust affirmation.\n\nAlthough the tradition of negative theology does not directly address democratic politics, it demonstrates that a commitment to radical transformation does not rule out the compromise required to enact concrete policies. In this way, negative theology offers resources for addressing the crises that currently threaten democratic politics in the West.\n\nNegating political theology\n\nThe term “negative political theology” has a short history. It is chiefly associated with Jacob Taubes’s 1987 lectures on the Apostle Paul. In an afterword to the published edition of the lectures, the editors remark that “Taubes regards the function of the Pauline critique of the law to be a negative political theology.” On their account, Taubes appeals to Paul in order to delegitimise every political structure. They explain:\n\n[Paul] doesn’t oppose a political theology of the Torah to the Roman nomos of the earth in order to establish a new national form of rule. He fundamentally negates law as a force of political order.\n\nIn their view, where first century Jews appealed to divine law in developing a positive political theology, Paul explodes every claim to authority. On this reading, Taubes follows Paul in negating political theology.\n\nThis places Taubes at odds with Carl Schmitt, the progenitor of modern political theology as a descriptive discipline. In his 1922 book Political Theology, Schmitt argues that the concepts of modern politics are theological, not simply because they are historically linked to Christian thought but because they systematically rely upon the miraculous. Schmitt writes, “Like every other order, the legal order rests on a decision and not on a norm.”\n\nAgainst those who portray politics as the rational adjudication of contested questions, Schmitt argues that — in the foundation of any system and in the application of any norm — a decision is required that goes beyond the norm itself. According to Schmitt, such a decision is irruptive and irrational, and so it resembles divine intervention to contravene natural law. In Schmitt’s account, the paradigm of decision is a sovereign who acts unilaterally.\n\nAlthough Taubes owes a great deal to Schmitt, he objects that Schmitt’s account of sovereignty aims to legitimate authority. In this way, Taubes extends a criticism of Schmitt first articulated by Erik Peterson in 1935. Peterson argues that “Orthodox Trinitarian doctrine in effect threatened the political theology of the Roman Empire.” According to Peterson, in Jewish and pagan theologies monotheism represented a political problem insofar as it identified the earthly emperor with the divine Monarch. Where some early Christian theologies reiterated this form of monotheism, the doctrine of the Trinity described the Godhead as one God in three persons, united without subordination. Because the Triune God has no analogy in the created realm, Peterson argues that this rules out the representation of the divine by a human ruler. “With this,” Peterson writes, “the linkage of the Christian proclamation to the Roman Empire was theologically dissolved.” Like Taubes, Peterson’s point is that earthly power should be strictly distinct from the spiritual.\n\nIn the final footnote to his treatise on monotheism, Peterson addresses Schmitt directly: “To my knowledge, the concept of ‘political theology’ was introduced into the literature by Carl Schmitt ... Here we have tried to show by a concrete example the theological impossibility of a ‘political theology’.” Peterson construes political theology as the legitimation of political power through theological authority, and he argues that the doctrine of the Trinity excludes it altogether. For this reason, he says, political theology must be negated.\n\nPessimism and affirmation\n\nBecause some theologians tend to triumphalism, I think Taubes and Peterson are right to resist the theological legitimation of power. However, political theologies that are purely negative sometimes struggle to contribute positively to political reflection. Following Augustine of Hippo, theologians such as Reinhold Niebuhr have interpreted politics in terms of the pervasiveness of sin. On Niebuhr’s account in his 1940 book Christianity and Power Politics, since pride corrupts human activity, every political project is problematic. Niebuhr argues that Christian tradition teaches humility, and he implies that a key function of theology is to criticise political structures:\n\nOnly in a religion in which there is a true sense of transcendence can we find the resource to convict every historical achievement of incompleteness, and to prevent the sanctification of the relative values of any age or any era.\n\nFor Niebuhr, as for Peterson and Taubes, theology is political above all because it prevents political order from appropriating divine authority. The problem is that Niebuhr’s pessimism inhibits theology from constructively addressing questions of policy.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, a wave of German theologians argued along similar lines that political theology is primarily negative. Dorothee Sölle, Johan Baptist Metz and Jürgen Moltmann each argued that Christian thought must engage political questions, but they tended to present theology as a force that judges politics from the outside rather than contributing constructively.\n\nSölle foregrounds the critical function of political theology, Metz equates “political theology” with “(socio-)critical theology” and Moltmann writes that “political theology is the internal critique of the modern world.” In each case, the emphasis upon critique resists the tendency of political leaders to appropriate divine authority, but it discourages theologians from addressing debates over policy. As Metz explains, “The Church’s task here is not the elaboration of a system of social doctrine, but of social criticism.”\n\nThese pessimistic political theologies offered an important corrective to the tendency to see theology as a purely spiritual affair. However, some feminists responded by arguing that their negativity is corrosive. Where Niebuhr presents pride as the primary sin, Valerie Saiving argues that the problem for marginalized groups is not self-assertion but “underdevelopment or negation of the self.” In her view, Niebuhr’s insistence upon meekness is the wrong recommendation for some people. Although pride sometimes needs to be checked, it sometimes needs to be nurtured.\n\nAuthority sometimes needs to be resisted, but at other times it should be bolstered. Since Augustine, Christians have struggled to acknowledge both demands, and they have not always succeeded. This suggests that while Niebuhr and theologians like him are right to insist that God must not be identified with a given political regime, they are wrong to imply that critique must be the primary focus of political theology.\n\nWhere these twentieth-century theologians worked under the shadow of Hitler and Stalin, we now confront other dangers. Although sovereignty remains a problem for politics, we must also address systems of power that have a deep but indirect influence on each of us. Niebuhr argued that the idealism of the social gospel movement underestimated the human capacity for evil, so he opted for a tough-minded realism that some took to justify torturing terrorists, albeit with a frown.\n\nAs I have argued at greater length in a recent book, Hope in a Secular Age, negative political theology constitutes an alternative to both optimistic idealism and pessimistic realism. By holding construction and critique together in tension, negative theology demonstrates that it is possible to pursue particular aims while acknowledging their inadequacy. In this way, it models a hope that encourages critical vigilance while allowing the compromise that is required for concrete action.\n\nTheological negativity\n\nThe tradition of negative theology explores a tension between negativity and affirmation that is woven deeply within Jewish and Christian scriptures. The Torah insists that God alone should be worshipped, and so it proscribes the representation of God in graven images (Exodus 20:4). Although early Christians affirmed that Jesus Christ was “the image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15), this paradoxical phrase suggests that God remains obscure. Jesus’s closest contemporaries repeatedly failed to recognize his divine mission, and later Christians disagreed concerning what that mission meant. Although Paul claims to possess apostolic authority, he writes that “we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known” (1 Corinthians 13:12). On this view, Christians’ knowledge of God is imperfect: at least for now, it fumbles in the dark. Some theologians therefore insist that every attempt to represent God must be accompanied by a disciplined negativity.\n\nIn the second century, theologians such as Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria adapted vocabulary drawn from contemporary philosophy in order to underscore that God is beyond understanding. Several centuries later, Dionysius the Areopagite (also known as “Pseudo-Dionysius”) developed this ethical discipline into a systematic account of unsaying. In his view, because theological language is drawn from creation, it falls short of the Creator, and so every name for God must be negated. In TheMystical Theology, Dionysius describes an ascending series of negations, which systematically undoes the categories of human thought:\n\n[The Cause of all] cannot be spoken of and it cannot be grasped by understanding. It is not number or order, greatness or smallness, equality or inequality, similarity or dissimilarity. It is not immovable, moving, or at rest. It has no power, it is not power, nor is it light … It is not kingship. It is not wisdom. It is neither one nor oneness, divinity nor goodness … There is no speaking of it, nor name nor knowledge of it. Darkness and light, error and truth — it is none of these. It is beyond assertion and denial.\n\nDionysius construes this negativity as a discipline of unknowing, which pursues intimacy with God by renouncing security. Dionysius’s many followers in the Middle Ages are diverse, but they agree that a disciplined negativity is integral to Christian life.\n\nSome theorists claim that this negativity is a disingenuous ploy. In their view, mystical discourse attempts to eliminate particularity, but it remains bound to the content of specific traditions. I think these readers are right to identify a tension between negation and affirmation, but they are wrong to suggest that it constitutes a contradiction. In fact, this tension is explicitly central to negative theology in its classic formulations. According to Dionysius, theological affirmations are inadequate to the divine, but theological negations are no better. Because saying “God is not wisdom” might imply that this statement accurately describes God (albeit negatively), he claims that it is necessary to say at the same time that “God is wisdom.” In similar fashion, Gregory of Nyssa refers to “the seeing that consists in not seeing,” and Meister Eckhart suggests that we “pray to God that we may be free of God.”\n\nIn each case, these paradoxical formulations indicate that neither affirmation nor negation is adequate. Rather than requiring pure negativity, negative theology juxtaposes affirmation and negation in order to prevent Christian discourse from settling into stasis.\n\nNegativity and politics\n\nIt is understandable that—with some notable exceptions—relatively little has been written on the political significance of negative theology. Because the texts in question are elusive, it is difficult to extract instructions concerning worldly life. To complicate matters further, many commentators claim that the tradition is centrally concerned with mystical experience, which is implicitly apolitical. In my view, however, this reading rests upon a misunderstanding. In fact, theologians such as Dionysius and Eckhart directly reject the claim that one could know that one has had an experience of God, mystical or otherwise. Rather than appealing to extraordinary experiences, they describe a discursive practice that calls into question every claim to grasp God.\n\nIn my reading, although negative theology does not offer direct prescriptions for modern politics, it exemplifies an ethical discipline with political implications. By holding affirmation and critique together in tension, it models a circumspection that avoids both optimism and despair.\n\nForty years after Valerie Saiving criticised Reinhold Niebuhr’s pessimism, a group of scholars in other fields argued along similar lines that critique is corrosive. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick claims that, although critique equates itself with dispassionate truth, it anticipates the negative in order to neutralise the threat of pain and surprise. In her view, this motivation overrides other affects — joy, nostalgia and so forth — in order to foreclose anticipated danger.\n\nIn similar fashion, against the view that critique is a destabilising force that disrupts unjust relations, Rita Felski argues that it has hardened into a new orthodoxy. She writes that “what is needed … is a politics of relation rather than negation, of mediation rather than co-option, of alliance and assembly rather than alienated critique.” Like Saiving, these theorists argue that critique can preclude other approaches.\n\nWhere Felski opposes relation and negation, love sometimes calls for negativity. The rise of right-wing movements around the world has cast a cold light on the racism, sexism and xenophobia that poisons the heart of ostensibly democratic societies. In response, critique is required — to demonstrate that the current configuration of power is contingent and to condemn injustices that have become entrenched.\n\nI think Sedgwick and Felski are right to argue that this negativity must not be allowed to overwhelm the affective range that is required by constructive politics. The challenge, therefore, is to find a form of critique that encourages robust affirmation. This is, I believe, what negative political theology offers the world. In the wake of the Great Recession of 2007, a range of movements emerged around the world to resist racial and economic injustice, from Occupy to Syriza and the “Arab Spring.” The energy that animated these groups was inspiring, but they struggled to transition from opposition to sustainable power. Where protest movements pursue the purity of justice, the work of governing must reckon with ambiguity and compromise. Both relation and negation are needed, but — as Felski and Sedgwick observe — it is difficult to maintain these affective registers at once. In my view, the tradition of negative theology demonstrates that it is not impossible.\n\nNegative theology affirms particular projects that it subjects, at the same time, to critique. When situated within the unfolding time of human life, this tension functions as an ethical practice that is oriented toward unexpected possibilities. In contrast to an unmodulated negation that simply obliterates its object, it exemplifies a negativity that holds affirmation open to future revision. Because this negativity is reflexive, it resists the hegemony that Felski and Sedgwick fear.\n\nNegative theology calls everything into question, including itself. Rather than foreclosing creativity, negative theology encourages experimentation by rendering every attempt provisional, fungible and fresh. It is thus possible to affirm particular projects while acknowledging that our best judgments remain subject to revision.\n\nNegative political theology does not answer every question that confronts those who are concerned for the future of our societies. However, it does hold the potential to reframe debates over religion and politics, realism and idealism, optimism and pessimism, negation and relation. By holding together construction and critique, it offers an alternative to the pessimistic political theology that colours Christian thought in the West, and it models the bold circumspection required to sustain political movements in the face of uncertainty."
