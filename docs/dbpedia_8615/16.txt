Organized by the Herbert Kopp-Oberstebrink and Martin Treml (Research Project Edition Jacob Taubes) in cooperation with Dana Hollander (McMaster University/ZfL) and Arnd Wedemeyer (Duke University).

Jacob Taubes (1923–1987), philosopher of religion and of Judaism, subversive intellectual, and the most extensively networked agent provocateur of postwar intellectual life on three continents, accepted an offer to join Berlin’s Free University in 1966, founding its Institute for Judaic Studies as well as its Institute for Hermeneutics. While his regional influence should not be underestimated and while he has had a continuous impact on Berlin’s and Germany’s academic life, he is currently being discovered internationally as a ceaselessly provocative and highly original thinker. With the English translations of Taubes’s lectures on Paul, his earliest book Occidental Eschatology, and the essay collection From Cult to Culture, Taubes has joined the echelons of the “Theory” elite. He is being read alongside Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou, Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Gershom Scholem, and others. His work is being hotly debated in many contexts, from political philosophy to intellectual history, from so-called post-secularism to cultural studies.

We convene this workshop as an attempt to collect these interests, but also to bundle and focus them, and to contemplate Taubes as a thinker, historical phenomenon, and exceptional intellectual in his own right.
