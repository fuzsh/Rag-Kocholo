        "text": "(born 1971). American music producer and hip-hop and rhythm-and-blues performer Timbaland contributed to the success of many recording artists in the early 21st century. He also created new record labels—Beat Club and Mosley Music Group—under the umbrella label of Interscope.\n\nTimothy Z. Mosley was born on March 10, 1971, in Norfolk, Virginia. He grew up with rappers Missy Elliott and Magoo. At age 19 Mosley began to learn how to use studio equipment under the direction of producer and musician DeVante Swing. Swing’s mispronunciation of the shoe manufacturer Timberland resulted in a new name for Mosley. Timbaland’s inventive production skills were first noticed on Aaliyah’s 1996 hit song “One in a Million.” Soon afterward Timbaland signed with Blackground Records as both a solo act and part of the rap duo Timbaland and Magoo. In 1997 the two put out their first album, Welcome to Our World. It featured the contributions of Elliot and Aaliyah, along with the hit song “Up Jumps da Boogie.”\n\nBy the late 1990s Timbaland had developed a signature sound that made him a much sought-after and often-imitated hip-hop and rhythm-and-blues producer. He used original beats—rather than samples—to create complex rhythms and complemented them with quiet background rapping or obscure sounds, such as a whinnying horse. With an uncanny knack for crafting commercially successful singles and albums, Timbaland produced hits for Jay-Z, Ginuwine, Elliott, Ludacris, and Snoop Dogg.\n\nIn the early 2000s Timbaland moved beyond the genres of hip-hop and rhythm and blues to produce albums for rock and pop stars, including Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake, Beck, Björk, and Madonna. In addition to his notable work as a producer, Timbaland continued to release albums, both as a solo artist and in conjunction with Magoo."
