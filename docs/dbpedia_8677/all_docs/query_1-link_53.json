        "text": "Timbaland is in the very top tier of producers. Timbaland started the 90s creating songs for Jodeci, MC Lyte and for Missy Elliot’s R&B group ‘Sista’. By the mid 90’s Timbaland produced the hi Pony for Ginuwine, alongside holding the controls for Aaliyah’s second album One In A Million(1996), Missy Elliot’s debut album Supa Dupa Fly (1997), He then produced her second album Da Real World (1999) as well as Aaliyah on her self-titled third album which included the beautiful songs We Need A Resolution, More Than A Woman and I Care4 U.Timbaland also grew very much as an artist in his own right, releasing his debut album in 1997 alongside his rap colleague Magoo. His albums across the decade included an all-star line up of featured artists including Missy Elliot, Alliyah, Elton John, Justin Timberlake and Nelly Furtado. As the millennium arrived, Timbaland produced the hit single Cry Me A River for Justin Timberlake and he went on to produce Justin’s subsequent albums FutureSex/LoveSounds and the 20/20 Experience. In the mid 00’s, he produced Nelly Furtado’s Loose album (2006) which featured the monster hit Promiscuous and worked with many other artists including Keri Hilson and D.O.E. Timbaland’s output was prolific during this time, contributing to songs for an exceptional range of artists including Rihanna, Madonna, Ludacris, Nas and JayZ, but also more leftfield artists like Bjork where he produced her 2007 album Volta. In 2009, a collaboration occurred with Chris Cornell for the Soundgarden man’s 2009 album Scream. Always moving things on, Timbaland has more recently been responsible for starting the online hip hop ‘battle series ‘Verzuz’ with fellow producer Swiss Beatz and also for soundtracking the hit tv show Empire."
