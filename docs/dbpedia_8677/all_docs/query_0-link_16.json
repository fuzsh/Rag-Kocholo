        "text": "Today, it is widely regarded as one of the greatest dance songs of all time.\n\nAsked why he wishes he made the song, Timbaland said: \"You hear the melody?! 'She's homeless.' I was like, 'Yo.'\"\n\n\"I need to have that in my catalog,\" he added. \"I'm a DJ. When I play that the crowds go crazy. That record was monumental.\"\n\nTimbaland also detailed to Insider what his favorite songs are to play when he's behind the decks.\n\n\"When I DJ now I just be playing my own records,\" he said. \"Because I got two or three hours full of them that jam in the club. That's why I'm the legend.\"\n\nMissy Elliot's \"Get Ur Freak On,\" Bubba Sparxxx's \"Ugly,\" and Justin Timberlake's \"SexyBack\" are just some of the mammoth hits the Virginia native has produced over the years.\n\nDespite his impressive catalog, however, his own hits aren't the only songs he loves to play.\n\nRelated stories\n\nDescribing his dream set, Timbaland said: \"I'd probably start with not one of my songs, but probably 'Paris,' the Hit-Boy song. Then I'd go into 'Big Pimpin' and 'Drunk in Love.'\"\n\nFrom there, the 51-year-old producer said he'd dip into some Skrillex and Diplo, before returning back to hip-hop and R&B.\n\n\"Then maybe some Aaliyah. They thought we was going pop? Take them straight back to the ghetto,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he'd close out his set with \"Gypsy Woman,\" Timbaland replied: \"Damn straight.\""
