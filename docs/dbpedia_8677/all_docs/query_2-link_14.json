        "text": "As I sit here listenin’ to this “Timbo The King!” playlist on my obscenely incredible iPod, I gotta say Timbaland is a bad muh’fukka. I’ve been a fan of his beatwork over the better part of the last 14 years or so, as he’s constantly dropped too many game-changing tracks to name.\n\nThe earliest knowledge I had of Tim was being credited on Jodeci‘s Diary of a Mad Band album, when he was still part of the Swing Mob. Under the direction of Devante, he was beginning to co-produce with him, although he was often uncredited. Eventually, like most of the other Mob members (Missy Elliott, Ginuwine, Playa, Magoo), Timbaland left the situation once it got stagnant and headed downhill. By ’96, the former Swing Mob became Tha Bassment, and both Timbaland and Missy were gaining recognition for their work (Tim as a producer, Missy as a songwriter). Their first major project together was Aaliyah‘s second album, One In A Million… and from there, everything was a go.\n\n’96 was a major year for me when it came to music. I stayed buyin’ new records, so I always had my ear out there for all the new shit. I knew next to nothin’ about Timbaland, but his name started poppin’ up on some of the most popular singles during late-’96. His beats instantly stood out, because he (kinda like DJ Premier, but in a much different way) was using all kinds of unusual-ass sounds and makin’ some hot shit out of it. It seemed like he was toyin’ around with as much stuff as he could, just to see if it would work, and it usually did. Whether it was crickets, a laughing baby, or Jurassic Park-ish dinosaurs– it used to fukk me up that he was able to flip those over his tracks. Everything about it was different- the drums, the beat changes, his occasional beat-boxin’- just a lotta stuff you didn’t hear everyday.\n\nFor that same reason, Tim’s also one of the most imitated producers ever. I think at one point, just about every slow song on the radio had that stuttering-beat shit with the shuffling drums, like how he did it on “One In A Million”. I was far more partial to his R&B work than his hip-hop stuff, though. I swear, this dude has wasted great tracks on some of the most remedial MCs in history (including Missy, whose singing is waaaay more tolerable). On the occasions that he did work with more capable rappers, the results were a lot better (well, at least most of the time). There’s a number of songs that eventually grew on me- mostly due to the beats- but I still wish he’d given them to people who woulda done them some justice.\n\nThe main thing that’s helped Tim thrive for this long is his willingness to move it along and do new things. Some producers lost their spot because they had trouble adjusting when everybody jacked their shit, and others have gotten so stuck on their sound that they went years without switchin’ it up. Timbaland has been able to keep it movin’ without being on his own shit for what he did way back when (which he’d legitimately have a right to do). His work was still hot during the 2000s, as he was still cranking out hip-hop and R&B hits, before venturing into the pop market and scoring there too. Matter fact, one of my favorite albums of the last five years was Justin Timberlake‘s FutureSexLoveSounds, which surprised the hell outta me.\n\nWhen he started getting coverage, a lot of the mags used to call Timbaland’s music “futuristic”. While I agree that it was clearly ahead of the loop, I’d say it was also right on time. It was something that shook things up when everybody else was dickriding the Bad Boy sound and running it in the hole. His own albums have always fallen short of the standard he sets when working with other artists, and he’s surely had some lapses in judgment, but he’s easily been one of the best since he broke through. One of the things that marks a producer’s dominance is when their shit is so in-demand, everybody’s waitin’ to see what they do next. Even after almost 15 years, Tim still got ’em waitin’.\n\nAaliyah “If Your Girl Only Knew” (1996)\n\nGinuwine “I’ll Do Anything (I’m Sorry)” (1996)\n\nTimbaland & Magoo “Luv 2 Luv U” (1997)\n\nMissy Elliott feat. 702 & Magoo “Beep Me 911” (1997)\n\nUsher “You Make Me Wanna (Remix)” (1997)\n\nLil’ Kim “Money Talks” (1997)\n\nPlaya “Cheers 2 U” (1998)\n\nTotal feat.
