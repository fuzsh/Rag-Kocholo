        "text": "Beat/Rank:\n\n#25- “If Your Girl Only Knew” by Aaliyah [One In A Million (1996)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nWith any good Timbo beat there will, of course, be great drums and some futuristic sounds. But, I submit that Mr. Mosley’s secret weapon is the bass. Other than the amazing vocals of Aaliyah on this track, it’s Tim’s bass line that will stick with you.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#24- “Is That Yo Chick” by Memphis Bleek (ft. JAY-Z/Twista/Missy) [The Understanding (2000)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nWhat you thought that you wouldn’t see Hip Hop’s War Machine again? While it’s not an out and out bass that creates the best part of this song its the bass tone that Timbaland gets from the low register of the strings on this song. After that you have a dope Missy hook and some super futuristic sounds and horns!\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#23- “You Owe Me” by Nas (ft. Ginuwine) [Nastradamus (1999)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nI’m not the hugest Nas fan. I certainly respect his talent and his importance to Hip Hop but… you get the deal. All of that to say I was taken aback when JAY-Z brought this song up as a negative during their beef and to find out that other people don’t like this song.. I can’t help but appreciate the instrumentation on this beat. I’m sorry.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#22- “My Love” by Justin Timberlake (ft. T.I.) [FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nI actually like the stripped down version that the album version starts with more, but then we wouldn’t get to THE KING, T.I. Plus, I do like the vibe of this beat. The keys really work for me on this since there isn’t a prominent bass element. But there is some dope beat boxing and I’m always here for some Timbaland beat boxing and adlibing.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#21- “Are You That Somebody” by Aaliyah (ft. Timbaland) [Dr. Dolittle OST (1998)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nThat baby laugh, tho! Again there is some great bass work at play here, however, the synthetic beat boxing ain’t too shabby either! Can we just take some time to remember when soundtracks were truly dope even though the songs had nothing to do with the movie other than the music videos straight up showing scenes from the movie?\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#20- “To My” by Nas & Skillz [Tim’s Bio: Life From Da Basement (1998)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nIt’s all about the piano on this song. Yes there are some great Tim adlibs and amazing percussion but I really dig the piano on this song. Stick around till the hook to hear a variation on the baby laugh. Not sure quite they were going for but that’s that out there Timbaland touch you gotta love.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#19- “Nigga What, Nigga Who” by JAY-Z (ft. Jaz-O & Amil) [Vol.2 (1997)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nBack to the amazing bassline! I must admit my love for this track comes down to how Jay performs it at all his shows and the rapid fire flows on display that I once was able to recite. But as a piece of music, you can’t deny that there’s something infectious to the way this beat is pieced together. Thanks, in big part, to the bass.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#18- “In the Club” by Beanie Sigel [Backstage OST (2000)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nRemember DJ Clue? Remember the documentary Backstage? Great times! I love Beanie Sigel and I was so happy to hear him over Timbaland production. Now let’s get into the actual beat. There’s something akin to a theremin at beginning of this beat that really sets the tone. It’s out there Tim meets dark Beans. Wish there was more of this.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#17- “Lobster & Scrimp” by JAY-Z [Tim’s Bio: Life From Da Basement (1998)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nIt’s the bass that drives this frenetic beat. There’s an immediacy to this beat that comes across in the drums but the bass helps give the beat a sense of authority making everything sound that much better.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#16- “Hey Papi” by JAY-Z (ft. Memphis Bleek & Amil) [The Nutty Professor II OST (2000)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nNot sure why I can’t find the version of this with words, but the good news is this list is really just about the beats. I was a big fan of the first Nutty Professor and it’s soundtrack. Unfortunately, the sequel only produced a great soundtrack. That’s where I heard the fully fleshed out version of this beat with the amazing horns at the beginning creating anticipation.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#15- “We At It Again” by Timbaland & Magoo (ft. Sebastian) [Romeo Must Die OST (2000)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nAnother great soundtrack cut from the still great Romeo Must Die. This time around, the great percussion, and adlibs are joined by a great guitar and bass tandem that creates the quintessential Timbaland sound.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#14- “Call Me” by Tweet [Southern Hummingbird (2002)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nI want to say its a sitar being used on this track. But as these musical posts have proven, my musical vocabulary is shrinking as the days pass. The point I’m all in for the instrument I assume is a sitar and the flute like sound that feels like a busy bee all over the track. Don’t Worry Gillian. As long as I’m writing about music, no one will forget about Tweet!\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#13- “Party People” by Timbaland & Magoo (ft. JAY-Z & Twista) [Indecent Proposal (2001)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nI think my favourite part is the fact that the beat sounds like a heart monitoring machine and then JAY-Z calls attention by stuttering like a sped up heart beat and the beat drops out and then comes back just for JAY-Z to end his verse talking about the doctors needing to help. I suppose Magoo even brings up the hospital. It’s just ill that this sound could be the backbone of such an dope song. Definitely keep your ear out for the great bass work as well as guitars with the chorus voices that angelically grace us with their presences every now and then.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#12- “Oops” by Tweet (ft. Missy) [Southern Hummingbird (2002)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nLook at that Gillian! Two Tweet entries. I don’t know how to describe what makes this beat so great. I genuinely feel like the beat sonically sets the scene for Tweet’s story about self love. It fits so well for the subject matter that it feels like a perfect marriage of lyrics and music.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#11- “Get On Dis Motorcycle” by Petey Pablo (ft. Bubba Sparxxx) [Still Writing In My Diary: 2nd Entry (2004)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nI really really like the vocals chanting throughout this beat. Petey Pablo needs a very specific sound and I’m so glad that he and Timbaland honed in on this unique sound. And I’d be lying if I said the way the motorcycle revs up coming out of the hook didn’t do it for me!\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#10- “Lovely” by Bubba Sparxxx [Dark Days, Bright Nights (2001)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nOh look Mr. Sparxxx doesn’t get a “featuring” mention in this post. I was really into the Timbo and Bubba Sparxxx era. His country ways mixed really well with Tim’s sound. This song in particular has a country feel word to the OOO, OOO, OOOOOs thoughout but a real funky bassline that creates a special sound. I’m also here for the pizzicato throughout the hook.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#9- “I’ll Be Around” By Cee-Lo (ft. Timbaland) [Cee-Lo Is The Soul Machine (2004)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nAnother instance of a beat so good I jacked it back in my “I bet I could be a rapper’ days. If there is a good bassline to this song, I wouldn’t know. I’m completely mesmerized by the Horns and drums. and that’s just during the verse. Then a choir of angels sings during the amazing chorus and I can’t help but enjoy this beat.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#8- “Big Pimpin’” by JAY-Z (ft. UGK) [Vol.3 (1999)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nMy introduction to Bun B has to be represented on this list. This beat is so good my mother listens to the uncensored version without flinching because she doesn’t really hear the lyrics once the flutes and other accoutrements are in full swing.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#7- “Oh Timbaland” by Timbaland [Shock Value (2007)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nI’m here for the Nina Simone. It took me forever to pin point what I loved about this song. Becasue a big part of it is the way Tim layers his voice during the hook. But it’s his use of “Sinnerman” that makes this a truly underrated Timbaland beat.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#6- “Dirt Off Your Shoulder” by JAY-Z [The Black Album (2003)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nThat’s right. JAY-Z had an influence on Luke’s last stand. Tell me your The Last Jedi audience didn’t react to Luke dusting his shoulder off after Kylo Ren unleashed ALL THE GUNS on him. Dusting your shoulders off may have been a thing before this song but no one will ever really be sure because of the way this song hits. Just go back up to the video at the top of this post and look at JAY-Z’s reaction to hearing this beat for the first time!\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#4- “Ugly” by Bubba Sparxxx [Dark Days, Bright Nights (2001)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nI know this is a take on “Get Ur Freak On” but there’s something about the energy of this song and the possible Missy and Tweet vocals on it that makes it seem like this is truly the beat that should be on this list of the two. Plus when I listened to it again for this list, it was just as good as the first time I heard it! Another favourite of my mother’s by the way.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#3- “One Minute Man” Missy ft. (Ludacris/JAY-Z/Trina) [Miss E So Addictive (2001)]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nYou probably were waiting for the magic that is Missy. Well here we go! One of the illest beats period. One Minute Man has some great bass that’ll sneak up on you what with all the high pitched things going on. I’m also a big fan of the percussion that sounds like sweeping. Also, don’t we miss the days where DJ edits with all the guest verses on one song were readily available???\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#2- “Sock it 2 Me” by Missy (ft. Da Brat) [Supa Dupa Fly (1997))]\n\nWhy Though:\n\nThe fact that the Delfonics “Ready or Not” is sampled for this song is everything. Those menacing horns. The TImbo drums and, of course, some deceptively effective bass work all come together for a beat that will never stop being cool.\n\nBeat/Rank:\n\n#1- “Baby Bubba” by Timbaland & Magoo (ft. Petey Pablo)\n\nWhy Though:\n\nThe guitar and pizzicato. If I’m being honest, that’s all this beat needed to shoot it to the top of this list for me. I’m all in for strings which this beat has but there’s an undeniable energy on this beat that demands a certain type of approach. This isn’t a plug and play beat. Timbaland & Magoo with their friend Petey are the only ones who could have used this beat and I respect the custom fit that this beat has.\n\n-YG"
