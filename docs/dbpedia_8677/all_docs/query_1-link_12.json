        "text": "Much has been made of Justin Timberlake’s triumphant return to music with his third solo album, “The 20/20 Experience,” but it also marks a return of sorts for its producer, Timbaland, who has laid (relatively) low over the past two years after spending nearly two decades as one of mainstream music’s most prolific producers. After cutting his teeth by working with Missy “Misdemeanor” Elliott, Ginuwine and Aaliyah, the Virginia native became one of the inescapable pop personas in the 2000s, concocting hits with Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado and OneRepublic while staying atop the hip-hop game next to Missy, Jay-Z and Young Jeezy.\n\nTo celebrate the release of “The 20/20 Experience,” a stellar R&B/pop effort produced entirely by Timbaland, check out Billboard.com’s countdown of the producer’s 20 biggest Billboard hits. This ranking is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart. Songs are ranked based on an inverse point system, with weeks at No. 1 earning the greatest value and weeks at No. 100 earning the least."
