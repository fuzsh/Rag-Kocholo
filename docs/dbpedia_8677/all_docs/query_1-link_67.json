        "text": "Here's a historical, musical timeline of 67 songs of over 4 hours of just some of Timbaland's production over the years. From Missy Elliot to Justin Timberlake to Jay-Z, Timbo is really the King when it comes to some of the most top charting beats across all music genres. We could only imagine the records he would have produced for the late great Aaliyah. Come take this journey with us.\n\nFollow @Spotify\n\nMotzy Says.....\n\n\"When I first really heard a Timbaland beat, I was like WTF is this? Is that a baby? It was the Aaliyah, “Are You That Somebody” song and ever since then, I knew dude was gonna be a problem. The Missy run was incredible. They were like Jordan and Pippen but then the songs he did with Jay-Z just solidified his skills as a producer. To working on whole albums with Justin Timberlake and making some of the biggest Pop and Hip-Hop records, Timbo is truly one of the best producers EVER! Hope y’all enjoyed.\""
