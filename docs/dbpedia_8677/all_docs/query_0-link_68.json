        "text": "Topline\n\nDays after former “Dance Moms” and Nickelodeon star JoJo Siwa released her single “Karma” in an attempt to pivot to a more mature image, a recording of the same track from 2012 by the largely unknown artist Brit Smith went viral on TikTok, prompting Smith to release her version—and earning Smith a higher rank on the iTunes chart than Siwa.\n\nKey Facts\n\nContra\n\nSiwa told TMZ she does not know who Smith is and denied allegations made by social media users that she “stole” Smith’s song, stating it is not uncommon for songs to get passed around to other artists before being released.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nSmith told Page Six that Rock Mafia had originally written “Karma” with Miley Cyrus in mind, but she passed on it. Some social media users had also speculated “Karma” was intended for Cyrus based an exchange between Cyrus and Rock Mafia on X in 2012, in which the latter used the hashtag #karmasabitch.\n\nTangent\n\nSiwa also stirred controversy during her “Karma” rollout for stating in an interview with Billboard she wants to “start a new genre of music” called “gay pop,” citing Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga as influences for her new musical direction. Musical duo Tegan and Sara—twin sisters who are both openly gay and have been releasing music since 1999—stitched a TikTok of Siwa’s Billboard interview, in which they silently stared into the camera before smirking. “These gay popstars love Jojo,” they captioned the video. Out Magazine posted a list, “as part of our love for Siwa,” ranking 25 of the best “gay pop” songs from the 1970s to the present. Siwa clarified to TMZ that she did not mean to imply she created the genre, stating: \"I definitely am not the inventor of gay pop, for sure not. But I do want to be a piece in making it bigger than it already is.”\n\nKey Background\n\nSiwa released “Karma” earlier this month, admitting the single was an attempt to shed her previous image as a child star. She rose to fame as a dancer on the Lifetime reality show “Dance Moms,” and signed a deal with Nickelodeon in 2017 that allowed Siwa to star in multiple Nickelodeon projects and for the network to use her for live programming. Siwa previously forayed into music with her single “Boomerang” in 2016, which has nearly one billion views on YouTube. Her rebrand with “Karma” has been largely panned by critics and social media users. Vulture slammed the single’s “faux-edgy lyrics, performed with all the conviction of the elementary-age students who used to be her fans.” Rolling Stone criticized Siwa as “trying too hard to shock us,” rejecting her self-professed comparisons to Cyrus. “Karma” has gone viral on TikTok, in part because Siwa has consistently promoted the song to her 45 million TikTok followers—but many of the top comments on Siwa’s videos are critical of the song.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nJoJo Siwa Grows Up (Or tries to.)
