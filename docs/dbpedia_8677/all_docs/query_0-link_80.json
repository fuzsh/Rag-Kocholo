There's dozens of videos showing the source materials that he steals and shoves in his product.\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=LepUbHjT-Z8\n\nWelcome to 1984! Sampling is a part of Hip-Hop. Just ask the Beastie boys who became the force they are today off of sampling. License to Ill and Paul's Boutique wouldn't have been able to be made today with the rules and fees concerning sampling.\n\nLed Zepp\n\nBeasties\n\nNERDS!\n\n0\n\nBiz markie was the first to feel the wrath of the copyright laws. he got screwed out of a lot of money because he used a sample without permission and the courts made an example out of him.\n\nhiphop will never die because its already dead. everything in hiphop is recycled it is the definition of the genre; sample and make new out of old. been happening since they started samplin beats by james brown.\n\nVan '98, Sea I+II '00, Sea '01, Sea II '02, Van '03, Gorge, Van, Cal, Edm '05, Bos I+II, Phi I+II, DC, SF II+III, Port, Gorge I+II '06, DC, NY I+II '08, Sea I+II, Van, Ridge , LA III+IV' 09, Indy '10, Cal, Van '11, Lond, Van, Sea '13, Memphis '14, RRHOF '17, Sea I+II '18, Van I+II, Vegas I+II '24\n\n0\n\npuff daddy took A LOT of hits from the 80's, he made them sound so crazy....\n\nVan '98, Sea I+II '00, Sea '01, Sea II '02, Van '03, Gorge, Van, Cal, Edm '05, Bos I+II, Phi I+II, DC, SF II+III, Port, Gorge I+II '06, DC, NY I+II '08, Sea I+II, Van, Ridge , LA III+IV' 09, Indy '10, Cal, Van '11, Lond, Van, Sea '13, Memphis '14, RRHOF '17, Sea I+II '18, Van I+II, Vegas I+II '24\n\n0\n\npeople like to forget that back in the 50s, most record labels would have their white artists simply record the hit songs of black artists in order to steal the income from that hit song.\n\nso in the 80s, black artists started a new genre doing it to white artists\n\nbut then, it was copyright infringement\n\nseriously, how many record labels wouldn't exist if they hadn't stolen from a bunch of black guys to begin with?\n\nanswer: ALL OF THEM.\n\nYou can't spell \"dumb\" without DMB\n\n0\n\nMrSmith wrote:\n\ndont all of these guys constantly rip off...er... i mean \"sample\" each other? its all just part of the inbred music industry.\n\nHey, some samples make the original more famous. Take \"Roc Boys\" by Jay-Z for example. That song, which samples the horns from \"Make The Road By Walking,\" by the Menahan Street Band, was the only reason I heard the latter to begin with. Some samples do suck, but a lot do some justice to the original. You want samples to pick on? Don't stick with Timbaland. He rarely samples the work of other artists. Sean Kingston has sampled Led Zeppelin, Ben E. King, and Phil Collins in his work. It sounds awful. That's the stuff people should hate on. No, Timbaland's got a lot of creativity and people who make samples put a lot of time into how to approach the sample so it does justice to the original song.\n\nNow if someone sampled Pink Floyd or Pearl Jam...whole different story. That's not cool.\n\nwww.myspace.com/fusionsong\n\n0\n\nOmega47 wrote:\n\nHey, some samples make the original more famous. Take \"Roc Boys\" by Jay-Z for example.

One of my friends was singing the oh oh oh oh oh part one day, and I was like, oh that's an awesome song, I've got it on my zen. And then a little while later they were like, play that Sean Kingston song. I was like, who the hell is Sean Kingston? Then I heard that song. It makes me angry.\n\n0"
