        "text": "Timbaland is tapping into the Latine market. The world-famous producer teamed up with Argentinian artist Paulo Londra for their new song, “Toc Toc.” The song was released as a part of a new Latine music initiative at Amazon Music, “El Género.”\n\nTimbaland is the hit-maker who has produced hits for artists like Aaliyah, Justin Timberlake, and Nelly Furtado. Nowadays, Timbaland is very selective with the projects he works on, so it was surprising to see him team up with Londra for “Toc Toc.” Londra returned to the music scene this year when he signed a partnership with Warner Music Latina.\n\nLondra started out doing rap freestyle on the Córdoba streets, and he returns to his roots in “Toc Toc.” Backed by very distinct and freaky hip-hop beats courtesy of Timbaland, Londra raps about coming up in Argentina to become one of the country’s biggest artists. The freestyle is under two minutes, but Londra leaves an impact with his passionate bars. “It was a great experience and we hope you like the hit that we prepared with Timbo and Fede for the people!” Londra said in a statement.\n\nLondra and Timbaland’s “Toc Toc” was released as part of Amazon Music’s new Latin music initiative. The song leads the launch of “El Género,” an initiative that features new music, programming, and editorial content highlighting the diversity and globalization of el movimiento.\n\n“‘El Género’ spotlights one of the most-listened-to Latin music genres globally, with an emphasis on the diversity of the voices and sounds that contribute to the movement today,” said Rocio Guerrero, head of Global Latin, Amazon Music, in a statement. “From Argentine trap, to Dominican dembow and Colombian guaracha, these once-local sounds now travel faster than ever before, influence artists globally, and are enjoyed by fans everywhere.”\n\nListen to “Toc Toc” below."
