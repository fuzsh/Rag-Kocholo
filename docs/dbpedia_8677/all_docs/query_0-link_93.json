        "text": "Not exactly new news, but I'm sure it's news to some of you. Timbaland, the guy who made that single with Nelly Furturdo, stole a song from the 8-bit demo scene to make his song \"Do It\".\n\nDIGG It:\n\nhttp://digg.com/music/Timbaland_ripped_off_a_track_from_my_buddy\n\nAnalytical Video Comparison:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4KX7SkDe4Q\n\nDownload the Original MOD:\n\n(this is what Timbaland ripped off)\n\nhttp://www.file-wire.net/?pdl=mt4RrhlE0HhT\n\nThe original artist of the song is a Finnish chiptune guy called Janne Suni. He has not made a dime off this, meanwhile Timbaland is raking in millions. I love chip music, but Timbaland basically based his whole song on the exact melody. It's not a \"sample\", it's a direct cut-n-paste.\n\nIt's no secret that pop musicians have little or no true talent, but this is really pissing me off...really wish I could initiate legal action on this finnish guy's behalf. I would be happy to pay for the legal costs myself...hey Janne if you ever read this then contact me.\n\nChip music, besides being awesome, is music that is made using old-school synth chips. A popular example of a synth chip is the Yamaha FM Midi chip that was prevalent on most early generation sound cards. Chip musicians use sounds from chips found in old video game systems, like the gameboy or NES...they can also generate pure sounds using software. Most geeks around 22-25 should love chip music...and surprisingly it seems to be gaining some popularity nowadays.\n\nI don't really believe in copyright for music any more.. but the problem is, in order for the RIAA to bust me, they have to catch me downloading their music..\n\nThe joke is on them.. their music now is soo bad that it is not worth my time to even download.\n\nThe RIAA isn't involved per se, but it's an ironic twist...you must know about the RIAA little war on P2P, how they've been crying that piracy is killing them and they've been suing children and old people as a result. Well now, one of their artists is guilty of plagiarism...and it does seem that the original author of the song is taking legal action against Timbaland and his label, Geffen.\n\nwow man that is really really scummy that he would do that. Who knows how many other old school songs he has ripped off - very few people have heard any at all to even verify if they're being ripped off.\n\nI'm surprised someone noticed. He should never be allowed to make music again imo\n\nWhat he did basically undermines music as an art. What if someone copied this website verbatim, but renamed it to something like \"VishnuTech\"? IT's pretty much what Timbaland did.\n\nthey're not it's just a bunch of immature pricks bitching about how they're pissed off at the evil fat corporations trying to keep their IP.\n\nWhy is the artist who got ripped an \"immature prick\" for defending HIS copyright? You make it seem like he doesn't deserve to have his copyright acknowledge because he does what he does for a hobby rather than as a commercial venture.\n\nOriginally posted by: EricMartello\n\nWhat he did basically undermines music as an art.

I think Tab is referring to everyone who is blaming the RIAA for this. How is the RIAA (or more accurately, the record label) supposed to know when one of their artists rips off some obscure, unknown, niche musician?"
