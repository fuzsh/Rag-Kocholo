        "text": "I agree anything he does, does well - however I don't think he provides anything, think he's a waste of space and is over-rated. I just think he is an American version of Mark Ronson (I think Mark Ronsons British - not sure).\n\nTimbaland does eff all - occasionally raps a verse - I can hardly understand him - I'm 17 and listen mainly to Rap, Hip Hop, and R&B - and the majority of his work features somebody who is amazing anyway - 50 Cent, JT, Nicole Scherzinger, Nelly Furtado, PCD...\n\nAnd then he claims it as his own - he does my head in =[\n\nSorry but I personally disagree with both above statements.\n\n0\n\nI think he's overrated too.\n\nTrue he's talented in as much that he can produce music which sells well.\n\nBut then again so do lots of other people who don't get the same hype about them.\n\nI think it's to do with the modern hip pop producer trend of promoting your egotism which Puff Daddy seems to have really kicked off in a big way.\n\nI think Timbaland is competent enough as a producer, he can make sound commerical music, but I think he's overrated rather than underrated because as far as I'm concerned he's doing nothing that different from a lot of other producers.\n\nHe's just a name to me that's all.\n\nI think that there's been very good producers in the past who have been underrated, but Timbaland, no. His name is everywhere.\n\nI don't understand how anybody can think that he's underrated with his name being touted all over the place. Isn't that enough? How high do you want to rate him? It's not as though nobody has heard of him and he's living in anonymity with not a cent to his name.\n\n0\n\nI agree anything he does, does well - however I don't think he provides anything, think he's a waste of space and is over-rated. I just think he is an American version of Mark Ronson (I think Mark Ronsons British - not sure).\n\nTimbaland does eff all - occasionally raps a verse - I can hardly understand him - I'm 17 and listen mainly to Rap, Hip Hop, and R&B - and the majority of his work features somebody who is amazing anyway - 50 Cent, JT, Nicole Scherzinger, Nelly Furtado, PCD...\n\nAnd then he claims it as his own - he does my head in =[\n\nSorry but I personally disagree with both above statements.\n\nYou do realise that it's usually just a case of Justin, Nelly or the Pussycat Dolls singing over his work? And he doesn't claim it as his own unless it's on his own album (which the various stars agreed to appear on).\n\nI loved that OneRepublic song for a year or so before Timbaland got involved. I don't actually see much difference from the original apart from Timbaland going \"eh eh\" at the beginning.\n\nBut I guess it got them good exposure, even though it does annoy me that its credited as Timbaland featuring OneRepublic, it should be the other way round....\n\nI agree about One Republic, but I think the label actually released the song as Timbaland presents One Republic, but the media couldn't get their heads around this new idea and just said \"featuring\". Ryan Tedder said in an interview that it meant they got the album out sooner and now have the chance to release material on their own like \"Stop and Stare\". Obviously it's not so much that he produced the song as them being signed to Mosely Music Group.\n\nI don't think he's under-rated, he's widely regarded as the best producer in the world for pop music. Given the sales and brilliant songs (Loved Nelly F's album, \"Sell Me Candy\", \"Rehab\", \"What Goes Around...\", \"The Way I Are\" and more) I think that's fair enough.\n\nI think he is fairly \"rated\".\n\n0\n\nTimberlands Amazing!!! Not only is he a brilliant producer but his album is hot!!!\n\nBut his album consists of songs that are mainly by other artists.\n\nFor instance, on Shock Value - \"Scream ft. Keri Hilson and Nicole Scherzinger\"\n\nHe doesn't sing or wrap at all on it, he says about 4 lines in the last 20 seconds of the song and that's it - yet it's claimed by him.. He might have produced it, but it his song if that makes sense - It's practically Keri Hilson ft. Nicole Scherzinger.\n\nThe Way I Are - if you were to edit out Keri Hilson, you would barely be left with 30 seconds of his voice.\n\nApologize - It's one republic singing - he occasionally goes \"eh eh eh\" which is pretty pointless.\n\nHe might produce the songs, big woop, but he surely shouldn't be referred to as an artist, or be releasing albums with other peoples work. Of the 19 songs on Shock Value, 13 are \"Timbaland featuring\" - more than your normal artists album of about three.\n\nWhen you click on \"Timbaland\" in iTunes - it presents you with 2 Omarion CDs, 3 Justin Timberlake CDs, 2 Destinys Child, 2 Ginuwine, 1 Duran Duran, 1 Paula DeAnda, and 2 Nas. Just on the first page of 2.\n\nAnother way of putting it is this:\n\nGus Dudgeon produced many of Elton John's tracks and albums - the songs however are not Gus Dudgeon ft. Elton John. Dudgeon doesn't get the same appreciation as Timbaland.\n\nThis is why I think he's overrated - just because he'll occasionally have a line (or even rarer an entire verse) on over two thirds of the songs on his album shouldn't make him an artist, or singer, or rapper.\n\nIt is the same reason above for why I detest Mark Ronson - He is not an artist - He doesn't deserve or earn the title \"Artist\".\n\n0\n\nSurely production is an art form too.\n\nSomething like Endtroducing by DJ Shadow is 100% samples, he doesn't sing on it, he doesn't play instruments. Yet it is HIS album.\n\nTimbaland clearly has no voice and no ability to rap - so he gets other people in to complete what he can't do, as with any other artist. Only difference is he uses big names instead of session singers. He's writing/re-writing the stuff, arranging it, putting down beats and loops. Writer AND producer - so his song's.\n\n(Don't care for Timbaland in the slightest I should add)\n\n0\n\nI agree.\n\nI think people should also recall the work he did with Aaliyah, Ginuwine and Missy in the 90's. In my opinion some of the best RnB tracks ever were made were on albums produced by Timbaland.\n\nTook the words right out of my mouth. Timbaland is extremely popular and successful at the moment; largely due to working with Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake, and in doing so, bolstering their otherwise middling careers.\n\nBut back in the mid-to-late 90s he was coming out with some of the most innovative beats and melodies. Missy Elliot and Timbaland were a great pairing, (Get Ur Freak On, etc). His style is updated, but in its foundations is still the same as it was way back when.\n\nIt's a testament to his ability to produce that he has become more commercially-successful without selling out.\n\n0"
