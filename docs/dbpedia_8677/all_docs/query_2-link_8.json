        "text": "Y'all just can't handle this beat.\n\n#22\n\nTimbaland - Give It to Me ft. Nelly Furtado & Justin Timberlake\n\nScore: 7,872580645\n\nHighest score: 10 x 3 (@KingBruno, @Terminus, @tylerc904)\n\nLowest score: 2 x 1 (@Aester)\n\nMy score: 10/10\n\n\"Is it going? Is it going? Is it going? Is it going?/I don't know what you're looking for\"\n\n*insert iconic beat*\n\nYAS! This song has one of the most addictive beats Timbaland ever created, and I stand by that statement. Overall I'm not a big fan of Timbaland's studio albums, but he absolutely delivered right here. I can't think of a better lead single for Shock Value.\n\n\"Give It to Me\" contains elements of electro and hip hop and has a club touch in it. It has a notable variety of instrumention, but in the end it does get that very modern sound Timbaland was chasing after. The verses – that are almost objectively better than the chorus – are supported by a tribal beat accompanied by synthezisers. The three artists all refute criticism that they received in the past, which results in a few epic moments during the song. For example, Timbaland raps about the fame he has while slating an unnamed producer (that's obviously Scott Storch) during the lyrics \"I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan/I'm a real producer and you just a piano man\". Justin disses Prince and in all probability, my fave Janet Jackson.\n\n(Don't let this turn into a Justin vs. Janet war thread thank you.)\n\nI do think the featured artists on this track sound impressively well; their verses in my opinion outclasses Timbaland's. Both Nelly and Justin sound full of themselves and I'm so here for that. Overall, \"Give It to Me\" has one incredible combination of artists; the three of them really were pop rulers during the '00s.\n\nIt's the first single from Shock Value (2007). \"Give It to Me\" is classified as an electro song with a club music feel. The song is noted for Timbaland's abusive speech in the second verse towards former co-worker Scott Storch. The song received a positive reception by critics and praise for its production and songwriting. It became Timbaland's only number one single in the US as a main artist. The single got nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2008 Grammy Awards.\n\nMost of the comments were favourable! Heaven on Earth (9) finds it underappreciated: \"If you ask the average American if this song was a #1 hit, they wouldn’t believe it. It’s so fucking strange, because it was! BUT IT NEVER GETS PLAYED ON THE RADIO THESE DAYS! Why?! “The Way I Are” still does get played significantly, why not this song? This is a really good song. It did not deserve this treatment by the general public.\" Because the radio can't handle such a collaboration! DJHazey (9) sees it more as a song to be played in the club: \"Yeah this will always go awf in the club. What an anthem in that regard. Also, I want to point how iconic Timbaland's facial expressions are in his videos. He seems like somebody who'd be fun to hang out with.\" I want to be part of Team Timbo.\n\nhaps (9,5) takes it: \"They gave it to me. A BOP.\" A bop it is. iheartpoptarts (9) gets more into the details by saying \"I love it when artists reference their past songs in other songs.\" I'm glad Nelly loved her ass and abs in the video of \"Promiscuous\". Serg. (9) saw criminals: \"Some people in comments slandering Nellegend get a job challenge.\" I just read throughout the YouTube comments! A fucking mess.\n\nEpic Chocolat (9) calls it a \"A somewhat enjoyable diss track.\" ohnostalgia (7,5) thinks about something else: \"I remember that \"your body\" production from a DJ Earworm mashup.\" Oh, him.\n\nSprockrooster must've expected less (9): \"This is actually holding up brilliantly and perhaps even grew in love in time.\" tylerc904 (10) remembers the good 2007: \"God I was obsessed with this at the time. Just such a moment.\" Oh yeah, you can call it a moment for sure.\n\nWe close with slaybellz (9) who cites some highlights: \"\"I'm a real producer and you just a piano man\n\nYour songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-an-an\"\n\n\"We missed you on the charts last week, damn, that's right you wasn't there\n\nNow if se-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi-i-it?\"\n\n.\"\n\nThe music video premiered on MTV's Total Request Live on 26 February 2007. Throughout the video we see their performance of the song at the 2007 Grammy Awards pre-show and Justin and Timbaland in a tour bus. Nelly is on a balcony for some reason. The directors were Paul \"Coy\" Allen and Timbaland.\n\n​\n\nWell this is unexpected...\n\n#21\n\nTimbaland - Apologize ft. OneRepublic\n\nScore: 7,911290323\n\nHighest score: 10 x 9 (@KingBruno, @Sprockrooster, @GhettoPrincess, @DJHazey, @2014, @berserkboi, @Epic Chocolat, @Conan, @Petty Mayonnaise)\n\nLowest score: 2 x 1 (@Heaven on Earth)\n\nMy score: 10/10\n\nThat's my third ten in a row.\n\nSeriously though, this song is wonderful. I know it's not usual to include a remix in a production discography rate, but this song has been so important for Timbaland and in the end it was a single of Shock Value. And you know what? This version may not have that much additions, but what Timbaland did makes this song even more powerful than it already was. Yes, it's better than the original if you ask me.\n\nThe remix includes an additional percussion line, new backing vocals and added sound samples together with further sound mixing and some other small chances. And of course, that incredible guitar solo after the second verse that adds a more R&B sound to the song.\n\nThe remix got included on Timbaland's album Shock Value and the deluxe edition of OneRepublic's album Dreaming Out Loud. Firstly, radio stations announced the artist of the song as \"Timbaland\". Later it got changed to \"Timbaland Presents OneRepublic\" after the song became more popular.\n\nGhettoPrincess (10) finds it outstanding for an OneRepublic song: \"I find OneRepublic’s material very patchy but this one is a classic. Everything about it just works so well.\" To be honest, I actually like them. \"Stop and Stare\" especially is such a good track. But well, after their first studio album everything went backwards for them. ohnostalgia (9) is not a fan either though: \"Minus one point for Ryan Tedder.\" Never forget that he produced the masterful \"XO\" by Beyonce!\n\nhaps (9) can enjoy it: \"Oh. This is such a guilty pleasure.\" Unfortunately, Serg. (7,5) can't as much: \"I'm kinda bothered by the beats in this song.\" But why?\n\niheartpoptarts (8,5) plainly finds it a \"Gorgeous song.\" Absolutely! DJHazey (10) is into it as well: \"Oh wow, I didn't expect this to be on the song list. Look at me giving out so many high scores to male-vocalist songs, ddd. This is a generational anthem. Yes, I was legit getting my life to it back when it was big.\" Men can bring it too! Epic Chocolat (10) gives credit to Timbo for it: \"Timbaland's input is minimal but it elevates the song.\"\n\nNow let's give a whole paragraph to Heaven on Earth (2) who slanders this '00s anthem: \"Never liked this song both in its original or the Timbaland remix. I’m seriously perplexed how this song became the tenth most successful song of the 2000s in the U.S. This song was the “Shape of You” of the 2000s.\" .\n\nLet's end on a positive note with praise coming from Sprockrooster (10): \"One of the best urban ballads from the 00's. Timbaland has a great sense for a big hit and he was a true king picking this out.\"\n\nThe remix received an official video that got released at the beginning of October 2007. It premiered on VH1's Top 20 Countdown on October 27, 2007. The director is Roberts Hales and it shows OneRepublic in a recording studio performing the song. It also contains some scenes of a New York's Eve Party. A third version of the video has Timbaland remixing in it. I'll post that one because this rate is for Timbaland and not Ryan Tedder.\n\n​"
