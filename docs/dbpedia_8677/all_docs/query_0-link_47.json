        "text": "He got caught out with the Nelly Furtado song Do It, he took that with no permission. People think just cause its from unknown countries no one will notice. Wrong.\n\nFinland.. an unknown country? :lol:\n\nAnd this is what Timbaland has answered\n\nTimbaland interviewed on \"Elliot in the Morning\", 2007-02-02\n\n============================================================\n\ntranscribed by Matt Westcott - comments and corrections to gasman@raww.org\n\nPresenter: Timbaland is with us this morning - the CD \"Shock Value\", that's up next for you. Interesting mix of people on it.\n\nTimbaland: Yes. Lot of shocking news.\n\nP: Let me ask you this. How hard is it- well, I mean, it's easy for you to, like you said, create a beat. Is it, um- we were talking about it before you got here. Is- If somebody is close to the same level as you are, is it conceivable that two people could sit down and create something that's pretty similar?\n\nT: [long pause] You could have sampled something to similar, but you can't- In our opin- Music today, you [look at] some old song, and it's like \"hey, that's how [it went], this song out today\".\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: And what if they got it from that. And somebody says, \"I've never heard that song a day in my life.\" Music isn't nothing but sounds and notes that repeats itself.\n\nP: Do you feel like you get ripped off a lot?\n\nT: Yeah. All the time, but I'm used to it now. But now I'm like \"Hey, you love me don't you.\" That's what I tell people. \"You love me, I'm [all your mine]\".\n\nP: Have you ever ripped anybody else off?\n\nT: Er - I haven't *ripped* nobody else off. But have I sampled? Hell, yeah.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: I didn't rip- go say \"Hey I'm gonna steal your beat\". I don't have to, I'm too good. [laughs]\n\nP: Now what is the- so what's with the- okay, I love it! - What's with the case with these- with the Finnish guys, who say-\n\nT: Finn- er...\n\nP: From Finland, who say you stole their stuff?\n\nT: I put it this way. 'Cause, that mess is so ridiculous, I can't really talk about it because I'm in legal- legal discussions and whatever, but I'm gonna tell you, if people- That's what I don't believe. Look at my face- I don't know who they faces are.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: The hell wrong with them? [laughs] That's all I can tell you.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: It's from a video game, idiot! [laughs]\n\nP: [laughs]\n\nT: Freaking jerk.\n\nP: So that's, so that's all in, tied up in court right now?\n\nT: Yeah, 'cause it's like, my whole thing is, yeah, because don't say I stole some- like, you act- like you just say- A sample, and stole, are two different things.\n\nP: Right. Give me the quick definition that splits those.\n\nT: S- Stole is like I walked in your house, watch you make that beat, took your pro tools and went to my place and gave it to Nells and said \"Hey, I got this great song.\"\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: Is he crazy? I live in America. I don't even stay in Finla- I ain't gonna get into it. Then sample is like, you heard it somewhere, and you just sample it.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: But you didn't know, maybe you didn't know who it was by because it don't have the credits listed.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: So you just use it. Hey, I don't know, I like it, but I'm gonna use it. Maybe somebody, you know, might well put a sample claim in, or, I don't know. You know what I'm saying, but-\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: I like it, I don't have no researchin'- time is coming up when I got to turn a record in.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: So, that's what sampling is. That's not stealing, 'cause everybody sample from everybody every day.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: And that's what a sample is, like, it maybe [even needs a] credit, cause, hey, I sampled it, I got it from a game. I don't know.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: And you have a listen. And it say, C-64, Commodore 64. I don't know. You know what I'm saying? So, I like it. I found it. I got sounds upon sounds upon sound. I don't know what's public domain and what's not. Some stuff don't say.\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: Some stuff say it, it says it.\n\nP: So the stuff that's public, you just - \"F- it, I'm gonna use it\"?\n\nT: Yeah, you can use it. It's like, I think Swizzy got sued one time for using the Casio thing, in the Casio equipment that you buy. But who- well I think they settled, because it's like \"Yo, I brought 'em keyboard. I brought it. They made it for me to use...\"\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: \"It was a demo in there that I like, and I flip it a certain way - how you gonna sue me? It's a demo. I brought - the demo.\"\n\nP: Right.\n\nT: \"Don't - you can't sue me for buying what I b- I purchased this.\" You just say \"Hey, by the way, don't sample\"- it's like, \"Well why am I gonna buy the keyboard?\" You know?\n\nP: In the world you live in, in terms of being a producer, does that kind of stuff, all the behind-the-scenes legal stuff, does that go on a lot?\n\nT: It go on a lot 'cause everybody want to come out of the woodwork, say like \"you done something. You stole this.\" Or, You- whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Come on man, I'm good.\n\nP: [laughs]"
