        "text": "TLDR: old news - Timbaland ripped off a small time chip-tune musician, acted like a jerk about it and got away scott free - still getting paid royalties to this day. How does that sit with you?\n\nSo this may or may not be a well known story, but waaayy back in 2005, Timbaland sampled what he “thought” was a commodore 64 video game song by playing back the ASID file on his Elektron Sidstation, then used large portions of it in his own production of a ringtone called “block party”, and then the block party beat was later reworked into a break on the song “do it” which was released as part of Nelly Furtado’s mid 2006 dance-pop album “loose” thus sparking a controversy which proved just how little respect the proverbial small-time musician gets in a court of law.\n\nBecause as it turned out, as with most good things you didn’t create but used anyways, the “video game” song in question (acidjazzed evening) was not just some catchy long forgotten C-64 tune, it was actually a work by Finnish demo-scener Janne Sunni (Tempest) from circa Y2K, which had (with permission) been added to a compilation of songs which had in 2002 (with permission) been re-mapped by Glenn R. Gallefoss (GRG) to play on a commodore 64 native music program and this release is the version Timbo got a hold of and “borrowed”.\n\nSo without further ado - the comparison of the works:\n\nTimbaland and Busta Rhymes in studio, sidstation prominently on display.\n\nAs early as July 2006 people on the internet were bringing attention to the sample-gate status of the Nelly Furtado track and subsequently there were some attempts by Sunni to file an infringement suit against Nelly Furtado’s publishing in Finland, Universal Music ltd. Turns out Timbaland felt literally no remorse about this, was rather derogatory in referencing the artist and went on record calling the whole thing ridiculous. Although he admitted to sampling the other work, he implied his time “in the game” gave him pedigree over the other musician thus he had carte blanche and basically laughed it all off as a joke (in the most obnoxious way possible).\n\nJust an eye opening event that shows how much easier it is for the big guy to rip off the little guy and get away with it - unfortunately this time around, Sidstation made it really easy for the big guy. Goes to show, keep track of what you put out into the world or it might come back on someone else’s royalty check.\n\nSome of you I’m sure were already aware of this but any thoughts about this type of sampling? is this different than the type of sampling “we” do when we hunt down some “forgotten” break on a record or find some sample-worthy video game sound/ cool video / random non public domain pre-published sound source? I’d like to think that when I grab a sample I’m not the evil mastermind behind robbing someone of their work but is there a difference? I’m not releasing anything like that for profit, that’s certainly different (in my opinion at least).\n\nAny thoughts on this event, Timbaland or sampling in general? I searched before I made this post and was surprised to find only a vague joke reference to “if Timbaland stole my beat…” but aside from that, it looks like this was never a topic of discussion.\n\nI don’t know how others go about it, but if I sample something that isn’t in the public domain or doesn’t have a license permitting such use, I get permission if I’m releasing anything containing the sample. If I can’t, I won’t release it.\n\nThe difference between a big name and a small name sampling something they don’t have permission for and releasing it, is that the big name always knows what they are doing. Otherwise they are the same thing. The scale of course is wildly different.\n\nI take a slightly more Realpolitik view of things. Facts were then as they are now, big names and big labels do whatever they want, nothing anyone can do to stop them.\n\nSure, you can take a stand and try and get them to stop it (or at least credit your work) by force, which absolutely won’t work at all. Or you could use the exposure to your advantage and accept that, yes, this is some bullshit, but if it leads to more ears on your tunes/bodies at your gigs, then overall you might be able to turn it into a positive.\n\nI know, sounds like I’m siding with the bad guys here, but what are you gonna do, really?\n\n…the idea, that an idea can also have a value, was a big step in civilisation…\n\nbut the only constant thing in time is change…\n\nthe days of copyrights, as we know them, are coming to an end…\n\nbad for arts, good for medication and such things…\n\nthere was a time, timbo was one of my heros…\n\nand to give him some credit, he used/sampled whole musical phrases not very often…\n\npretty much all other biggis in hiphop did that way way more…some even shamelessly, that their “little” steal was the only real idea in the whole track…\n\nwhile timbo in his prime, almost never had to rely on such shady biz…he created wide a list of tracks that sparkled full of fresh and original ideas…\n\nand the art of chiptune music always sounds kind of kiddish by “nature” and defenition…pretty easy to not take it too seriously when it comes to cherry pick some next samples…\n\nLot to unpack with the Timbaland example. He’s certainly a douche if he didn’t acknowledge the situation, but it also seems to be a kind of borderline sampling - he was using a re-mapping of the tune, and then playing that back as an asid file, so he’s twice removed from the source. Copyright still applies (as it would have if he was “just” using a game soundtrack as he originally thought), but it seems to be at least on the border between sampling and interpretation.\n\nBut even that’s complicated, because an asid file probably isn’t very different to a recording - it’s not like a MIDI file where you can plug in any old instrument at the end of the chain and alter the end result. Like an MP3, it sounds like it’s a set of digital data that reproduces the original. So sampling an asid file being played might be equivalent to sampling a CD, for example.\n\nAnd then on top of all that are the usual quandaries you face if you’re in favour of permissive sampling rights - they should apply to Timbaland just as equally as they do to a teenager in a bedroom with a janky old laptop. My own moral perspective is that acknowledgement and attribution are the central requirements - that’s what I’d found my sampling laws on, so it sounds like Timbaland failed on that count and would be thrown in jail under my benevolent dictatorship. A shame for him, but I still think more people would be happy overall. Well, one day,\n\nIt is a bit like midi in the way it plays back, but it’s more akin to a player piano. Like, it only makes one sound, you feed it the roll of music and it plays back the notes in that one voice.\n\nBut with the ASID player I think you can mute a channel - so if the file has 3 channels, you could play back 2 out of 3.\n\nRegardless, I think I agree with what everyone is saying. It’s a bit of a dick move, the way he handled it is a dick move, if you got your shit sampled by a major artist it’s a bit flattering but it’s also a bit of a slap in the face so you just have to make the best of it. If you have money to go to court do it, if you don’t? then try your best to leverage it.\n\nSo I don’t know, I see the side where you just have to make the best of the situation, but I also see where the original artist and the people in the scene where they take making chiptunes as a serious artform would feel like they got slapped.\n\nI mean song rights do apply differently from a legal standpoint than sampling someone’s recording, but what’s the purpose of the song registration process if it only applies to some people?\n\nAlso with the example given of Dua Lipa, it’s hard to deny the similarity between the songs in question but it also goes to show that if you can’t prove your case to within a window of reasonable proof (if not beyond a shadow of a doubt) then you may be screwed from a legal perspective because the courts or the law will always require you to fill out your forms and present your case according to the letter of the law - no room for interpretation on that.\n\nI tried to avoid putting it that way deliberately because I don’t think they should be grateful for the exposure. But exposure is exposure, the industry is a complete cunt and the ones at the top of the food chain will always win. Fight them if you want, people should always be given the opportunity to defend themselves and their work, but unless you can afford better lawyers than them (spoiler, you can’t) then you ain’t gonna win.\n\nTimbaland isn’t the problem (I mean, yeah, he’s an arsehole, but he’s just doing what he’s being allowed to do), systemic inequality and legal accessibility is the problem.\n\nI can’t quite put my finger on it, IP (intellectual property) doesn’t completely sit well with me yet if a popular entity blatantly took my creative work I would be upset.\n\nOn one hand money making popular music seems more about winning a popularity contest than a song or idea being “quality.”\n\nIdeas seem to come out of thin air and are often shared in zeitgeist fashion, but biting is basically theft.\n\nSampling/re-contextualizing is sort of a grey area for me.\n\nReminds me of hearing Jack White bitching about the Black Keys ripping him off yet he made a high profile career re-imagining what so many had done before, such as Led Zeppelin.\n\nOne of my favorite albums is Paul’s Boutique.\n\nI’m also a huge fan of how hip hop can flip a sample/idea, but when it’s not “flipped” enough I tend to frown on it.\n\nIt happens in movies SO MUCH. Same with stand up comedy.\n\nWhen art, music etc is viewed as content or as a product, to be consumed and as such tries to make profit, either as a consequence, or either as a goal then thats what you get.\n\nIf we want to be actually fair, whoever chooses to release music through labels, the label should pay like a big chunk of money to an international organisation whose job is to share that money amongst every single poor person with half a brain that can come up with more than a sentence to describe somebody’s work of art. Or.\n\nAll i mean is influences are everywhere, and instead of having a copyright police that makes people pay for being influenced by anything, we should encourage getting interested in art and stuff, and not punish people. Corporations are not people, they are systems and as such they are different. But most of us agree they are scum.\n\nMaybe all music should he free, and art too, and we should be getting payed for even getting interested in it, and all ideas should be free to roam around and influence people and make them have more ideas. Instead we try to make a system to police, not only what we express, but also where it came from. To me this sounds like a totalitarian dystopia. And i think we might be living in it already."
