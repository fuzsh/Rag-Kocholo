        "text": "Reading on mobile? Click to watch\n\nTimbaland has hinted that he is currently working on music by Michael Jackson, with a first single release to be called Chicago. In a heavily edited 39-second video clip, the producer revealed that LA Reid had visited him to discuss the project, which he described as \"two kings working together\". When it eventually emerges, the result will be \"my music with his voice on it\", Timbaland said.\n\nTimbaland has previously been critical of the reanimation of dead artists by contemporary musicians. When Drake and Chris Brown recorded songs featuring his late protege Aaliyah, the producer said: \"Chris Brown got a record, it won't work. Drake can go do a record with Aaliyah, it ain't gonna work â€¦ Aaliyah music only work with its soulmate, which is me.\"\n\nJackson's record label, Epic, has kept up a steady flow of Jackson releases since his death in 2009. The most notable has been This is It, which featured six previously unreleased recordings. There has also been an anniversary reissue of Bad, as well as the remix album Immortal and a live DVD. Motown, too, has released several posthumous compilations of material Jackson recorded while signed to the legendary soul label, as well as four \"remix suites\"."
