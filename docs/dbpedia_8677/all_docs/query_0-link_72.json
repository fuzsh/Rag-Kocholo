        "text": "Quite simply, pop, hip-hop and R&B music since the mid-1990s would not have been the same without Timbaland. Hailing from Norfolk, Virginia, the 51-year-old has given his producing, rapping, and mixing skills to some of the most celebrated songs of the last 30 years, by some of the most iconic artists.\n\nBest known for his instrumental chops, Timbaland famously worked as the primary producer for songs like “Dirt Off Your Shoulder” by Jay-Z, “Cry Me A River” by Justin Timberlake, “Promiscuous” by Nelly Furtado, and “Get Ur Freak On” by Missy Elliott, among dozens of others.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nBut, an overlooked aspect of Timba’s artistry is his songwriting contributions. Mostly used in tandem with his production skills, the multi-hyphenate’s writing expertise has also been employed on all-time hits.\n\nHere are six of the best songs Timbaland has landed songwriting credits on.\n\n“Drunk in Love,” Beyoncé featuring Jay-Z\n\nIn 2014, married couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z released their joint song “Drunk in Love” as part of the former’s self-titled fifth studio album. The song would eventually hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earn a remix with Kanye West.\n\nTimbaland would earn writing and production credits on the song.\n\n“The Weekend,” SZA\n\nFor “The Weekend,” the sixth song on SZA’s 2017 debut studio album Ctrl, both Justin Timberlake and Timbaland earned songwriting credits. This is likely because the song samples Justin Timberlake’s 2006 hit “Set The Mood (Prelude)/Until The End Of Time,” which landed on his sophomore studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds.\n\nTimbaland also earned writing credits on “Set The Mood (Prelude)/Until The End Of Time.”\n\n“Bedrock,” Young Money\n\nIn 2009, Young Money Records’ compilation song “Bedrock” hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, as it could be heard in almost every bar/club and on every urban radio station in the country. Featuring vocals and verses from Drake, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Lloyd, and more, “Bedrock” was an iconic moment for mainstream hip-hop as we entered a new decade.\n\nTimbaland earned songwriting credits along with 10 others.\n\n“Sorry Not Sorry,” Bryson Tiller\n\nLouisville, Kentucky, R&B singer Bryson Tiller’s debut album Trapsoul reached No. 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, putting the mainstream music community on notice that he was a force to be reckoned with. Within this album, tracks like “Exchange” and “Don’t” both peaked inside the top 30 of the Hot 100.\n\nAdditionally, the album’s 11th song “Sorry Not Sorry” climbed to No. 67 on the chart, as it saw Timbaland earn both production and songwriting credits.\n\n“Pray,” Sam Smith\n\nIn late 2017, Sam Smith released their promotional single “Pray” with Logic, just a few weeks before their second studio album The Thrill of It All was set to drop. “Pray” would peak at No. 55 on the Hot 100, and would be certified platinum by RIAA two years later.\n\nTimbaland would earn songwriting and production credits on “Pray.”\n\n“Yeah, I Said It,” Rihanna\n\nAs the eighth track on Rihanna’s beloved 2016 album ANTI, “Yeah, I Said It” was one of the more underrated songs on the track list. With Timbaland earning writing and production credits, “Yeah, I Said It” is still the most recent on the list of Rih and Timba collaborations that also includes “Lemme Get That” (2007) and “Rehab” (2008).\n\nPhoto by Roger Kisby/Getty Images"
