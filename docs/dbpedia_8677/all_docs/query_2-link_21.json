        "text": "“Look at Quincy Jones – he was 50 when he did Thriller! What’s my Thriller? That’s the goal.” These exact words could have been spoken by just about any ambitious producer of the last 30 years. But the fact that they come from none other than Timothy Mosley, aka Timbaland, may come as a bit of a surprise. After all, for someone who by the age of 40 had already crafted huge, era-defining hits for Missy Elliot, Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Jay-Z and scores of others, coasting towards an early retirement would have been an acceptable, even predictable, career trajectory.\n\nBut Timbaland today is as busy and enthusiastic as ever, and he wouldn’t be Tim if he wasn’t focussed on the future and the evolution of his craft. Technically speaking, one of the bigger changes in Tim’s recent past was his switch from keyboard workstations to a production set-up centered around Ableton Live and Push. So when we heard that Timbaland was going to be teaching an online class with MasterClass, we were more than just a little curious to see what insights he would share in his role as instructor. We reached out to MasterClass and were kindly allowed to share a few choice nuggets of Tim’s wisdom with you.\n\nThe first thing that’s immediately clear is that Tim lives and breathes music. Of course we all have musical ideas inside of us, but often the problem is how or where to begin. Timbaland’s way of getting those first ideas to flow out is by starting his tracks with an instrument every one of us already has; the voice."
