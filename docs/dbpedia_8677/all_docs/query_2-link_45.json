        "text": "Missy Elliott has announced she’s hitting the road with her first-ever headlining tour, sending fans into a frenzy.\n\nOn Monday (April 8), taking to social media, the Grammy-winning rapper dropped a bombshell: the Out of This World Tour is officially happening, and she’s not going solo. Joining her for the cosmic journey are none other than her longtime collaborators Busta Rhymes, Timbaland, and Ciara.\n\nBeginning July 4 in Vancouver, the 24 city tour will kickoff in Vancouver before making stops in cities like Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, New York and Toronto before closing things out on August 22 in Rosemont, Illinois.\n\nThe announcement came with a wild tour trailer, featuring the trio decked out in cosmic gear as they hilariously attempt a Mars landing instead of reaching their intended destination, Earth. “The year 2024, these three icons come together to show you something you’ve never seen before.”\n\n“This is an incredible time in my life as I am experiencing so many milestone ‘firsts,’” Elliott said in a press release, reports Variety. “Being the FIRST female Hip Hop artist to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and now going out on my FIRST headline tour.\n\n“Fans have been asking me to tour forever but I wanted to wait until I felt the time was right because I knew if I was ever going to do it, I had to do it big, and I had to do it with family!\n\n“So get ready to be taken OUT OF THIS WORLD with me, Busta Rhymes, Ciara, and Timbaland! We can’t wait to share this experience with the fans!”\n\nThe touring artists share a deep-rooted history with Missy Elliott and Timbaland having not only collaborated on their own music but also produced hits for renowned acts such as Aaliyah, SWV, 702, and Total.\n\nMeanwhile, Ciara and Elliott joined forces on smash hits like “1, 2 Step” (2004) and “Lose Control” the subsequent year. Their collaboration continued with a remix of Ciara’s “Level Up” in 2018, featuring Fatman Scoop. On another note, Busta has worked alongside all three artists."
