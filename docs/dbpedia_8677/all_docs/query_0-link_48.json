        "text": "It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you, without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, step to...\n\nDJ, please pick up your phone, I'm on the request line.\n\n​\n\nAfter more than two months, we finally reached the climax of the rate. Who wins? Let's find out...\n\n#2\n\nMissy Elliott - Work It\n\nScore: 9,432258065\n\nHighest score: 11 x 2 (@Sprockrooster, @Furball), 10 x 17 (@KingBruno, @GhettoPrincess, @2014, @kermit_the_frog, @haps, @londonrain, @Heaven on Earth, @AshleyKerwin, @LE0Night, @Jwentz, @slaybellz, @NecessaryVoodoo, @ohnostalgia, @Number, @K94, @Petty Mayonnaise)\n\nLowest score: 5 x 1 (@iheartpoptarts)\n\nMy score: 10/10\n\nWhere to start with \"Work It\"? It's astonishing that a female artist could make such a big impression on the world of hip hop at that time, mostly because only men were seen as icons from that genre in the past. She completely overshadowed her fellow rappers with the release of Under Construction, and it was \"Work It\" that brought old school hip hop back to the mainstream. The impact she had on music with the release of this track is insane. The song we speak about is a hip hop classic on the name of, indeed, a woman. No one would've expected that during the early and mid-'90s.\n\nThe media attention this song received back then brings me to the moment where I need to point out what kind of lyrical masterpiece this is. \"Work It\" makes use of many metaphors that ultimately became outright iconic. The slang term \"badonkadonk\" that pops up in the second verse raised in popularity, for example. Or what about the voice reversing? The aspect I like the most is the elephant sound in the line \"If you got a big [sound], let me search it\" that makes you automatically fill in the wordless gap. The song teases you in a way that's funny; the use of onomatopoeia later on serves this effect brilliantly as well.\n\n\"Work It\" showcased the creativity of both Missy Elliott and Timbaland in the best way possible. They showed the world how it's done. I can say for a fact that female hip hop wouldn't have been the same without this body of work.\n\nAll that's iconic aside, Timbaland delivered a beat in here that was ahead of its time. It's arguebly his most bizarre one to date, too.\n\nThe commenters were very positive on this one. Heaven on Earth (10) says \"I bop like insane to this.\" It also receives a label as \"One of the best dance tracks of all time.\" I mean for a rap song, yes. GhettoPrincess (10) links the 'bop' to an annoying X Factor character: \"This reminds me of Honey G now…. (HELP!) but it’s an amazing song especially that chorus.\" I REFUSE to post that here.\n\nSome people commented on the \"Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup\" lyric. DJHazey (9) mentions it: \"Oh my God I had totally forgotten this song existed, what a mega bop! That \"screwing with the soundwaves\" synthesizer thing that was popular at the time combined with Missy's attempt at creating a new language in the chorus...I always loved this one.\" ohnostalgia (10) is wondering if it is indeed a new language: \"Okay the fake (?) Chinese is not a great look now, but this is a literal masterclass in production.\" But it's just \"I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it\" reversed?\n\nWe close with Sprockrooster (11) who actually didn't want to give this the perfect score: \"'Say It Right' would honestly be my 11. But I have 11ed it already a few times before and I feel like I could support other songs too. Work It is my obvious next choice as that song is monumental and completely groundbreaking in my taste. Missy broke my stigma about the tongue in cheek hiphop and she took it to the next level instantly with this track. For some reason it is also very easy on the ears and catchy. It stucks easily with me the whole day and I do not mind.\" But now \"Say It Right\" ended up being third place!\n\nLove the way my ass go bum-bum-bum-bum. Keep your eyes on my bum-bum-bum-bum-bum. You think you can handle this badonkadonk-donk.\n\nWhat an anthem. The music video directed by Dave Meyers is astounding as well. Timbaland, Eve, Tweet and Halle Berry make cameos. There's also a tribute to Aaliyah and Left Eye who recently died at that time. Britney Spears danced to the song along a few other Missy Elliott tracks at her Britney: Piece of Me residency show.\n\n​\n\nThat means it actually happened...\n\n#1\n\nAaliyah - Try Again\n\nScore: 9,480645161\n\nHighest score: 11 x 3 (@londonrain, @Heaven on Earth, @berserkboi), 10 x 19 (@KingBruno, @Sprockrooster, @GhettoPrincess, @Terminus, @2014, @tylerc904, @kermit_the_frog, @haps, @AshleyKerwin, @send photo, @Jwentz, @slaybellz, @NecessaryVoodoo, @ohnostalgia, @Epic Chocolat, @Conan, @Number, @K94, @Petty Mayonnaise)\n\nLowest score: 5 x 1 (@iheartpoptarts)\n\nMy score: 10/10\n\n*immense brass*\n\nIt's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you, without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, freaky-freaky.\n\n*drums*\n\nIt's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you, without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, step to, freaky-freaky. Baby girl, oh.\n\nOkay, fuck. Fuck. It's not like I regret my 11, but this winning just feels so right. In my opinion, this is one of the best modern urban contemporary song. It's a career highlight for one incredibly talented singer and one exceptionally creative producer. To me, this has always felt like a rare piece of fused music. There's R&B, there's pop, there's electronic and there's hip hop. Who would've been a better choice to bring all this genres together perfectly than early '00s Timbaland?\n\nIt feels strange that such an important song only got included on a soundtrack album from a badly received movie and became an international bonus track (!) on Aaliyah. Would they've done the same if they knew this ended up becoming a modern classic? Aaliyah's self-titled is one fascinating record, but picking \"Try Again\" as a single for it instead of one from a soundtrack album would've been so much better. At least I can describe it as my personal favourite soundtrack, I guess.\n\nWasted opportunity or not, \"Try Again\" remains Aaliyah's finest work to me. The vague, powerful beat delivered by Timbaland appears to be influenced by acid house. Aside from this, the song is accompanied by a techno sound that's inspired by the genre its origination. Aaliyah's vocals were recorded while sounding turtuous – that were also used as riffs – which adds much to the song's rhythm. In general, many of the additions to the composition by the producer represent effects of house. Timbaland altered the thing by making an R&B song sound more electrifying and dancey. Due to this, \"Try Again\" turns into something notable.\n\nThe song contains verses, a chorus and a middle eight that are all fascinating in their own, specific way. The intro, I must say, is splendiferous. Possibly one my favourite introductions to an R&B song ever, it makes use of a heavy brass eventually merged with drum beats. Timbaland raps lines of the fantastic \"I Know You Got Soul\" by Eric B. & Rakim during this part, but replaces \"strong rhyme\" with \"beat\". Just when you thought it all couldn't get any better.\n\nI'm glad this song received acclaim by almost all of the commenters. Sprockrooster (10) knows what's up: \"This has always been my Aaliyah favourite. That intro is mostly part of my immense love for it. Instantly drawn in.\" Oh, that intro. GhettoPrincess (10) is one that honours it too: \"That intro, the production, the vocals, everything is just perfect!\" It's indeed that intro, isn't it?\n\nsend photo (10) was and still is a big fan: \"Little me discovering and subsequently hammering my Now 4 CD for this one.\" At the moment I'm wondering how you'll react to Aaliyah snatching the top spot. According to Epic Chocolat (10), it's \"A classic hit.\" So that means you don't mind this winning? I hope so. ohnostalgia (10) refers to a genre that lost this rate: \"Pop girl anthem of 2017, minus the future success potential.\" Is this meant to be rude?\n\nSpeaking of that, negative attention is attention as well. iheartpoptarts (5) hates on the wondrous chorus: \"I actually prefer almost all her big singles to this one. There’s something about the chorus that just doesn’t work for me. Don’t kill me.\" Awh, don't you like enthralling aspects in music? DJHazey (8) says: \"I enjoyed this alot more at the time.\" That's okay, but the following is incorrect: \"Unlike Are You That Somebody? which is timeless, this lost alot of luster over the years for me despite still being a solid bop.\" If one Aaliyah song is everlasting it's \"Try Again\".\n\nFor the first time in this rate, everyone who gave an 11 commented! berserkboi (11) didn't doubt: \"This was always going to be my 11 despite so many other options here as it was my first experience of Timbaland and from the first second, it relentlessly grabs you and won’t let go. Aaliyah’s sultry vocals complete it all magnificently!\" Her voice in here is perfection. londonrain (11) must be pleasantly surprised by this song being the winner: \"My second favourite song of all time. Simply flawless. (Fun fact: this is the first ever song to top the US charts based on airplay alone. When will your faves, etc.).\" You have taste! Now I'm wondering what's your all-time number one, though. I guess we'll find out in @ufint's rate?\n\nLet's close the last comment section with Heaven on Earth (11) who split the commentary into two paragraphs: \"There’s no question that this is my eleven. If someone asks me what is one of the most haunting songs in existence, this is one of the songs I pinpoint. When Timbaland raps “It’s been a long time, long time/I shouldn’t have you let you go” in the intro, it immediately sticks in your memory and always sends chills down my spine. This is the sole song during their entire career that Timbaland’s rap is absolutely necessary to. When you enter Aaliyah into the question – “If at first, you don’t succeed/Dust yourself off and try again” – it automatically becomes an instant earworm while adding to the song’s mysticism at the same time. Oh, and since this is a Timbaland rate, I sure have to talk about Timbaland’s wonderful production here. It accentuates the lyrics beautifully and there is something both so urgent yet free-flowing about it. How did this guy go from “Try Again” to create appalling crap like “Murder”?\n\nI was two years old when Aaliyah died in that plane crash so I wasn’t aware of her until I started branching into music. I knew of Aaliyah’s martyrdom (that’s what people treat her unfortunate death as), but I had never heard a single song of hers before. One day, I was listening to the radio when I was about twelve years old and I heard the song “Try Again.” It automatically captured my attention in a way few songs have. Maybe it is her untimely death that seems to have lent this ghostly atmosphere “Try Again” has for me, but it is the reason why I love this song so goddamn much. And also it’s probably the fact that this song takes me to an Asian-inspired fantasy world and I’m just in this state of lucidity – almost Matrix-like (strangely enough, Aaliyah had been signed on to do the sequels) – and I’m spiraling into a state of dream.\"\n\nYou don't wanna throw it all away. I might be shy on the first date, what about the next date?\n\nJust watch that wonderful video already.\n\nI wish she was still with us...​"
