        "text": "Our Ranking Criteria\n\nThe top online music production courses provide you with a balance of inspiration, clear instructions on how to make the best use of music production software, and the skills needed to develop, create, and refine your music. We researched 30 online music production courses before narrowing down to the top 10 in this guide. When deciding which programs to include and which to leave out, we used the following criteria.\n\nBasic Ranking Criteria\n\nBefore committing to an online course, you should have a sense of the time required to complete the course, whether any prerequisites are required, how flexible the schedule is, and what sort of certificate you can expect to earn upon completion. That’s why for each online music production course covered in this guide, we looked at four basic factors.\n\nTime to complete. You should be able to complete your online music production course relatively quickly to create tangible products (songs). The courses in this guide take anywhere from a few hours to five months to complete. They are all self-paced, so the time to complete is ultimately up to you.\n\nPrerequisites required. None of the courses covered in this guide require any prerequisites. If you have no background in music creation or production, you can dive straight into any of the courses and start learning.\n\nFlexible schedule. Most people are strapped for time so we selected self-paced, part-time courses with flexible schedules to best suit your needs.\n\nCertificate of completion. Some of the courses in this guide offer a certificate of completion, which is a valuable addition to your resume.\n\nAdvanced Ranking Criteria\n\nThe basic criteria mentioned above are relevant to nearly all online courses. Listed below are some of the key factors specific to music production.\n\nThe course covers a variety of music production skills, from composition and songwriting to recording and sound engineering to mixing and mastering.\n\nThe instructors are skilled teachers with first-hand experience as successful music producers.\n\nThe course’s effectiveness has been proven by graduates successfully producing music or advancing in their music-related careers.\n\nThe course utilizes hands-on, project-based exercises that help students learn by doing.\n\nThe course provides students with clear, step-by-step instructions for using industry-standard music production software.\n\nThe course acquaints students with important techniques, vocabulary, and norms within the world of music production.\n\nThe course walks students through the entire process of creating a song so by the end, they have at least one polished piece of music.\n\n10 Best Online Music Production Courses\n\nCoursera\n\nMusic Production Specialization\n\nIntelligent Award: Top Pick\n\nCoursera’s Music Production Specialization is offered by Berklee College of Music. It’s a bundle of four courses on the following topics: the art of music production, the technology of music production, Pro Tools basics, and a music production capstone project.

Recording Studio owner, Larry Crane. With over 20 years of experience, Larry Crane is a great source of industry tips and tricks on topics like “remove snare ring”, “double compressing vocals”, and “autopanning guitars and keyboards.” These mini-lessons in this course have a lot in common with the other LinkedIn Learning course featured in this guide, Audio Mixing Masterclass on LinkedIn Learning.

Consider the cost\n\nHow much do online music production classes cost?\n\nOnline music production course costs vary widely. You can expect to spend $0 for a free course or trial to several hundred dollars for a more intensive course. Keep in mind many of the courses included in this guide charge by the month for course access, so the sooner you complete the course, the cheaper it is.. Also, most fee-based courses offer the option of making payments in installments as opposed to upfront in one lump sum.\n\nWill my employer pay for me to take the course?\n\nEmployers often reimburse or help to subsidize the cost of professional development courses and programs for their employees. If you work in an industry related to music, sound, production, or performance, there is a chance your employer will be willing to reimburse you for the cost of the course or at least pitch in to help. This is worth speaking to your boss or HR department about.\n\n2. Get your tech squared away\n\nMost of the online music production courses featured in this guide require some form of DAW software such as Pro Tools, Logic, Ableton Live, and/or FL Studio. These software tools typically offer a free trial period after which you need to pay for access to the software. It’s important to have access to the proper DAW for your course so you can make the most of hands-on assignments. Outside of the software, you can engage with all the course materials through your web browser. Your computer will need to be able to support streaming video, so you’ll want to make sure you have a fast, reliable wifi connection and at minimum, an i5-level processor and 8 GB of RAM. Keep in mind DAWs and large audio files use up a lot of space on your hard drive.\n\n3. Use the right study resources\n\nMany courses are geared towards beginners, so they offer great materials for laying a solid foundation in music production fundamentals. It’s beneficial to supplement course materials with outside resources. A few good places to start are MusicTech’s Beginner’s Guide to Music Production, Pensado’s Place episodes, and Mike Senior’s book Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Online Music Production Courses\n\nInterested in a degree instead?\n\nLearn more about online degrees, their start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below."
