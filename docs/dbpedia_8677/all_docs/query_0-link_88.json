        "text": "Busta Rhymes’ new album will boast plenty of firepower behind the boards as he’s recruited Pharrell, Timbaland and Swizz Beatz to oversee production.\n\nSwizz shared the news in a video posted to Instagram on Sunday (May 14), in which he gave the Brooklyn rap veteran his flowers for his unique musical style, electric stage presence and long and decorated career in Hip Hop.\n\n“This is a Busta Rhymes appreciation post,” the Ruff Ryders producer said while on a boat. “My brother’s been doing this so long, from Leaders of the New School … to headlining every major festival, tour, show. Leaders was the ’80s and Busta’s been kicking ass since [then].\n\n“It’s 2023. My bro got all new deals, all new music coming out. I just want to take the time to say I appreciate my brother Busta Rhymes for his longevity, his distinctive style, voice. I wish everybody a long career like Busta Rhymes. He’s the biggest deal.”\n\nHe continued: “Him and Spliff Star don’t play no games on that stage doing older songs and new songs. He’s boxed with the best of ’em. He’s been on the charts with the best of ’em. And one week he was on the stage with Janet Jackson and Mary J. Blige — that’s just one week!\n\n“Cheers to my brother Busta Rhymes for life. Wait until you hear this new music this man got. The album executive produced by Swizz Beatz, Timbaland and Pharrell. Wrap your face around what that’s gonna sound like.”\n\nBusta confirmed the news in the comments section and further fueled excitement by claiming his upcoming project will “shift the culture.”\n\n“I Guess it’s Time!!!! You let the cat out the bag huh King???!!!!! SWWWWWIIIZZZYYYY!!!” he wrote. “I love you and appreciate beyond description King!! Our years of friendship and being brothers cannot be described in words!!\n\n“Wait till they hear how we are going to SHIFT THE CULTURE with this album Executive Produced my you @timbaland @pharrell & myself King!! It’s been an incredible process doing this every step of the way with you Kings and we ain’t Stoppin’ NO TIME SOON!!”\n\nSwizz Beatz, Timbaland and Pharrell producing Busta Rhymes’ new album should come as welcome news to fans, especially considering the Flipmode Squad frontman has no shortage of hits with the trio of super-producers.\n\nBusta and Swizz previously teamed up for party-starters like 2006’s “Touch It” and 1998’s “Tear Da Roof Off,” while his work with Pharrell and The Neptunes includes the infectious “Pass the Courvoisier Part II,” “As I Come Back” and “Light Your Ass on Fire.”\n\nAlthough his discography with Timbo isn’t as deep, the Brooklyn and Virginia natives have connected in the past on The Big Bang‘s “Get Down” and several interludes on Missy Elliott’s early albums.\n\nBusta Rhymes has been teasing his 11th studio album as early as June 2021 when he reunited with Pharrell and Chad Hugo. “Guess who’s back at it? The Dragon & The Neptunes @pharrell @chadhugo Oh Shit!!” he wrote on Instagram while sharing a photo of him hanging out with the Grammy-winning duo in Miami.\n\nThe following year, Busta teased collaborations with yet more heavyweight producers by previewing an unreleased song with the late, great J Dilla and hitting the studio with Metro Boomin.\n\nHis forthcoming album will serve as the follow-up to 2020’s Extinction Level Event 2: The Wrath of God, which debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 and boasted appearances from Kendrick Lamar, Q-Tip, Mary J. Blige, Anderson .Paak, the late Ol’ Dirty Bastard and more."
