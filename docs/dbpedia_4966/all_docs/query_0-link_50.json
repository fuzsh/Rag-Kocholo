        "text": "Reprinted by permission from the Connecticut Broadcaster's Association\n\nWritten by Michael Collins © ® 2005\n\nThe following is from a pamphlet entitled \"TIME LINE FOR CONNECTICUT BROADCASTING\" released in November, 2005 by the Connecticut Broadcaster's Association to commemorate their 50th anniversary. It is one of the only comprehensive lists of its kind that we are aware of, and serves only as a companion to the WWUH History documents elsewhere within this website.\n\n1921 - 1949\n\n1921 Earliest Stations In CT Begin\n\nWCJ New Haven, owned by A.C. Gilbert toy company, the third radio license in the U.S.; also WDAK Hartford, Hartford Courant, and WAAQ Greenwich, New England Motors (none of these survive more than a few years).\n\n1922\n\nWPAJ New Haven begins, founded by Franklin Doolittle, later becoming WDRC, Connecticut's oldest radio station.\n\n1923 WCAC Storrs, CT Agricultural College station begins as CT's first educational station.\n\n1925 WTIC Hartford begins, owned by Travelers Insurance Company.\n\n1926 WTIC becomes 4th affiliate nationally of NBC.

WICC Bridgeport becomes CBS affiliate\n\n1931 WTIC synchronizes broadcasts on 660 khz with NBC's WEAF New York City certain evenings each week, which continues until 1934.\n\n1934 WATR Waterbury begins as Waterbury's first station, and which today is oldest continuously owned station in the state, never having been sold, owned by the descendants of the founder Harold Thomas.\n\n1935 WNLC New London begins, first station east of the Connecticut River. WCAC Storrs, sharing time with WICC on 600 khz, shuts down, leaving Connecticut with no educational radio station for 20 years until WHUS 90.5 Storrs, - owned by the same school - now the University of CT -- opens on the FM band in 1956. Later WHUS moves to 91.7 and 90.5 becomes available for Connecticut Public Broadcasting.\n\n1939 W1XPW begins broadcasting from West Peak, Meriden, as state's first FM station, becoming WDRC-FM in 1943 and WHCN in 1956. 1940 WXSO Hartford begins as states second and its only other pre-World War II FM station, becoming WTIC-FM in 1940.\n\n1941 Every AM station in Connecticut except WICC 600 changes frequency in March as new international radio agreement with Canada, Cuba, the Bahamas and Mexico takes effect.
