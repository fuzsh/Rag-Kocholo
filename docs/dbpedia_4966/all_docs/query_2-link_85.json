(Jack) Ruttle from a staff announcer's job in radio/TV in Barrie to the Vice-Chairmanship of Power Broadcasting Inc., and thence to his own consulting firm. In the process he made major contributions as an executive in many areas of the private broadcasting sector during its formative years.\n\nJack was born in 1936 in Windsor, Ontario, where access to both Canadian and US radio stations gave him an early interest in the medium. He took music lessons in Windsor and Detroit, learning to play trumpet, and his early interests in jazz, and broadcasting, were fostered particularly by his enjoyment of Phil McKellar's all-night jazz programs on CKLW. Phil became a good friend, and it was he who suggested that Jack should take the Radio/Television Arts course at Toronto's Ryerson Polytechnic Institute.\n\nHe started there in the fall of 1955, having graduated from Kennedy Collegiate Institute in Windsor in the spring. During his first year at Ryerson he met Al Hamel, a second year student who was working a weekend announcer job at Ralph Snelgrove's CKBB Barrie (and who later became a popular television personality). Al had just got a full-time job with CBC Radio and suggested Jack apply to Program Director Bob McLean for a job at CKBB. His application was successful, and Jack began working for the station as a staff announcer at CKBB Radio.\n\nThe summer job became a fulltime job - goodbye Ryerson - and Jack stayed with the Snelgrove organization for five years, eventually becoming Program Manager of CKBB in 1957. He also did some on-air announcing, news reading and hosting for Snelgrove's new CKVR-TV station. While in Barrie he met sales executive E.J. (Ted) Delaney, and when Ted joined the new Baton Toronto television station CFTO-TV, he suggested that Jack should apply for a job there. The then CFTO executive Al Bruner hired Jack, who started in the station's Promotion Department on October 1st 1960, three months before the station went on the air.\n\nJack eventually became Promotion Manager and then Program Manager for the Bassett station, where he stayed for ten years. In 1970, CFTO-TV owners Baton Broadcasting Ltd & the CBC were jointly awarded a licence to buy CKLW-TV Windsor, and for his 75% ownership, Baton President John Bassett wanted someone he knew he could rely on to run the station. On the recommendation of Ted Delaney, now CFTO-TV Vice President Programming and Sales, it was Jack Ruttle who got the nod, and in 1970 he began a three-year stint as Vice-President, Programming for CKLW-TV.\n\nIn 1973, with CKLW-TV only two years away from becoming a full CBC-owned affiliate station, Baton Broadcasting again offered Jack a promising upward move - this time to become President of Baton's CFGO-Radio in Ottawa. Then in March 1975, Standard Broadcasting acquired ownership of CTV affiliate CJOH-TV Ottawa, and it was Jack Ruttle who Standard President Mac McCurdy invited to join them as Vice-President and General Manager of the station.\n\nJack stayed with CJOH-TV for two years, before being approached by Maclean Hunter in 1977 to replace his friend Herb Marshall as Vice-President of Calgary television station CFCN-TV. He stayed there from 1977 to 1979, when the doors opened again to another new opportunity.\n\nOver the years, Jack's work with CTV affiliates CFTO-TV, CJOH-TV and CFCN-TV gained him many insights into the operational structure of the network, and in 1979, when CTV President Murray Chercover was looking for a new Executive Vice-President, he immediately thought of his former CFTO colleague. Jack joined the network in 1979, and was there for eight years, until an approach from the Power Corporation of Canada offered attractive and interesting new challenges.\n\nSo, in 1987, the Ruttle family bags were packed again, and Jack moved to Peterborough to become President of Power's Kawartha Broadcasting, which consisted of CFMP-FM and CHEX-AM radio and CHEX-TV. Within a year, Jack had become Vice Chairman of a new entity, Power Broadcasting Inc., into which had been folded Kawartha Broadcasting and other Power holdings.\n\nIn 1993, Jack left Power to return to Toronto and form his own consultancy business, with Power as his first client. In addition, he and two former CTV colleagues, Keith Campbell and Don McPherson, got together to handle several consultancy assignments for both government agencies and the private sector. In 2000, Jack began what would prove to be a four-year assignment, teaching Management in the Media to students at Ryerson, his old alma mater.\n\nDuring his broadcasting career, Jack held directorships in many key industry groups, including the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, the Television Bureau of Canada, the Children's Broadcast Institute, the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement and the Canadian Advertising Foundation. His many involvements in local community activities included a directorship of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada (Metro Toronto Chapter).\n\nIn November 2011, Jack Ruttle was elected to the Board of the Canadian Communications Foundation. On January 1st 2015 he was elected Vice-President of the Foundation, with which he served for several years.\n\nJack Ruttle died on April 29th 2021.\n\nFrom The Globe and Mail, May 1-5, 2021:\n\nJACK RUTTLE OBITUARY\n\nJACK FRANCIS RUTTLE (John) October 31, 1936 - April 29, 2021 Pioneer Canadian broadcaster and superb family man Jack Ruttle died April 29 at Toronto Western Hospital as the result of a blood clot. He leaves his wife Sheri, children Lisa (Gary), Mickey (Paul), Joe (April), John (Celia) and Charlotte (Jeremy) as well as stepchildren Stacey, Meredith (Andy), Rennie (Silvia), Braden (Sadie) and Gabrielle (Matt), 13 grandchildren and nine step-grandchildren. He was born in Windsor, ON, October 31, 1936, to the late Anne Edna Purser Ruttle and Joseph Wickens Ruttle. He was predeceased by brothers Bill and Patrick, sister Joanne Eagleson and his first wife Anne. Jack loved the broadcasting business, baseball and jazz. His broadcasting career spanned almost 50 years, starting in 1956 as a staff announcer at CKBB Radio in Barrie, ON, moving up to program manager and also on-air work at CKBB company station CKVR-TV. An opportunity to join CFTO-TV three months before it went on air took Jack to the promotion department of the Toronto station in 1960. He became promotion manager and then program manager before CFTO-TV owner Baton Broadcasting in1970 appointed Jack vice-president, programming for Baton and the CBC's CKLW-TV in Windsor, ON. Jack moved to Ottawa in 1973 as president of Baton's CFGO-Radio. In 1975, he was approached by Standard Broadcasting to become vice-president and general manager of CJOH-TV, Ottawa. In 1977, he joined Maclean Hunter as vice-president of Calgary television station CFCN-TV. Then in 1979, CTV appointed Jack executive vice-president of the TV network. His final broadcast move came in 1987 when Power Corporation of Canada asked him to become president of Power's Kawartha Broadcasting CFMP-FM, CHEX-AM radio and CHEX-TV in Peterborough, ON. A year later, he was named vice-chairman of Power Broadcasting. In 1993, Jack moved back to Toronto to establish a consulting business with two colleagues and in 2000 he took on a four-year assignment to teach Management in the Media to students at Ryerson University, his old alma mater. Jack played and coached baseball. He was a trumpet player with his own band while he was at school. He was a great storyteller, always enjoying the opportunity to meet and entertain new audiences. He was a loyal friend, a true mensch, as one longtime associate said. But most important to him always were his wife, children and grandchildren. Because of Covid restrictions, a small family service will take place. A family and friends reception is planned for a later date when great Jack anecdotes will be celebrated.

Art-Colortone postcard that was published by the Union News Co. In the place for the stamp on the divided back of the card, it states:\n\n'Place One Cent\n\nStamp Here.'\n\nThere is also a brief description:\n\n'Detroit is the gateway to Canada,\n\nand thousands of tourists cross the\n\nborder daily at this point.\n\nSplendid Ferry Boats carry both\n\nPassengers and Motor cars.\n\nAlso, the Ambassador Bridge and\n\nDetroit-Windsor Tunnel maintain\n\ncontinuous service between the\n\ntwo shores.'\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge is a tolled international suspension bridge across the Detroit River that connects Detroit, Michigan, United States, with Windsor, Ontario, Canada.\n\nNote the slight upward curve of the main span. The curve helps to dissipate the force of the weight of the people and vehicles on the bridge lengthways instead of downwards like on a linear bridge. The curve produces a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either end. This means that the bridge can handle more weight without breaking.\n\nOpened in 1929, it is the busiest international border crossing in North America in terms of trade volume, carrying more than 25% of all merchandise trade between the United States and Canada by value. The bridge carries 60 to 70 percent of commercial truck traffic in the region.\n\nA 2004 study showed that 150,000 jobs in the Detroit–Windsor region and US$13 billion in annual production depend on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing.\n\nThe bridge is one of the few privately owned US–Canada crossings; it was owned by Grosse Pointe billionaire Manuel Moroun until his death in July 2020. Moroun also owned the Ammex Detroit duty free stores at both the bridge and the tunnel.\n\nHistory of the Ambassador Bridge\n\nThe passage across the Detroit River became an important traffic route following the American Civil War. The Michigan Central and the Great Western railroads, in addition to others, operated on either side of the border connecting Chicago with the Atlantic Seaboard.\n\nTo cross the Detroit River, these railroads operated ferries between docks on either side. The ferries lacked the capacity to handle the shipping needs of the railroads, and there were often 700–1,000 freight cars waiting to cross the river, with numerous passengers delayed in transit.\n\nWarehouses in Chicago were forced to store grain that they could not ship to eastern markets, and foreign goods were stored in eastern warehouses waiting shipment to the western United States. The net effect of these delays increased commodity prices in the country, and both merchants and farmers wanted a solution from the railroads.\n\nThe Michigan Central proposed the construction of a tunnel under the river with the support of their counterparts at the Great Western Railway. Construction started in 1871, and continued until ventilating equipment failed the following year; work was soon abandoned.\n\nAttention turned in 1873 to the alternative of building a railroad bridge over the river. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers commissioned a study of a bridge over the Detroit River.\n\nRepresentatives of the shipping industry on the Great Lakes opposed any bridge with piers in the river as a hazard to navigation. Discussions continued for the remainder of the decade to no avail; a bridge over the Detroit River was not approved.\n\nFinally, the Michigan Central built the Detroit River Tunnel in 1909–10 to carry trains under the river. This tunnel benefited the Michigan Central and Great Western railroads, but the Canada Southern Railway and other lines still preferred a bridge over the river.\n\nPlans for a bridge were revived in 1919 to commemorate the end of the Great War and to honor the youth of Canada and the United States who served in the Great War.\n\nHowever neither Ontario nor Michigan wanted to finance a river crossing. Michigan automakers subsequently decided to take the initiative to connect the Midwest to central Canada. After they created a bridge company, the project got into trouble when a Toronto financier hired to sell its securities embezzled the money and ran off, before ultimately committing suicide in a prison cell after conviction for murdering a drugstore clerk.\n\nBridge advocates turned to New Yorker Joseph A. Bower, a businessman who specialized in rescuing mismanaged companies. Bower succeeded in raising the necessary initial $12 million. Henry Ford, who backed the project, stated:\n\n\"The only way things can be done\n\ntoday, is by private business.\"\n\nThe bridge was constructed with investment from Detroit business people. Berkshire Hathaway acquired a quarter of the shares before selling to another investor, local trucking entrepreneur Manuel Moroun. Moroun continued buying until he eventually privatized it.\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge opened on the 15th. November 1929, at a total cost of $23.5 million.\n\nIn April 1930, shortly after the bridge opened, a Canadian immigration inspector jumped to his death. The bridge has been used by other suicide jumpers.\n\nAfter it opened, high divers considered it as a venue for a record; but after measurements of the height and currents were taken into account, they were dissuaded and abandoned the attempt.\n\nOn the 14th. November 2000, a scaffold on the bridge collapsed, sending three men into the Detroit River and leaving four workers dangling from safety harnesses. Jamie Barker, one of the workers who fell into the water, died.\n\nAn engineer, George Snowden, was disciplined for his role in the collapse; in 2012, a design that Snowden approved caused the Radiohead stage collapse in Toronto. Snowden's associate Domenic Cugliari was also involved in both collapses.\n\nStatistics of the Ambassador Bridge\n\nThe bridge over the Detroit River had the longest suspended central span in the world when it was completed in 1929—1,850 feet (560 m). This record held until the George Washington Bridge between New York and New Jersey opened in 1931.\n\nThe bridge's total length is 7,500 feet (2,286 m). Construction began in 1927 and was completed in 1929. The general contractor and steel erector was the McClintic-Marshall Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe bridge is made up of 21,000 short tons (19,000 tonnes) of steel, and the roadway rises as high as 152 feet (46 m) above the Detroit River. Only the main span over the river is supported by suspension cables; the approaches to the main pillars are held up by steel in a cantilever truss structure.\n\nThe bridge's only sidewalk is on the structure's southwest side. After the 9/11 attacks, pedestrians and bicycles were prohibited from traveling across the bridge due to increased security measures. For years prior to September 11, 2001, the sidewalk was closed due to ongoing maintenance projects and repainting.\n\nOriginally painted gloss black, the bridge underwent a five-year refurbishment between 1995 and 2000, which included stripping and repainting the bridge teal.\n\nGranite blocks, originally used on the U.S. side, were given to the Windsor Parks and Recreation Department, and now grace many of the pathways in Windsor parks.\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge is the busiest crossing on the Canada–United States border. The four-lane bridge carries more than 10,000 commercial vehicles on a typical weekday. The Canadian end of the bridge connects to busy city streets in west Windsor, leading to congestion.\n\nControversies Associated With the Ambassador Bridge\n\n(a) Ownership Issues\n\nThe bridge's private ownership has been controversial because the bridge carries approximately 25% of trade between Canada and the United States. Although alternate routes exist, including the nearby Detroit–Windsor Tunnel, preventing monopoly status, the route is of significant value since it passes directly through major metropolitan areas. The aforementioned tunnel prohibits certain vehicles.\n\n(b) Access Roads\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Wayne County Circuit Court found the Detroit International Bridge Company in contempt for failing to directly connect bridge access roads to I-75 and I-96, and making other required improvements.\n\nThese improvements would normally be under the control of the state government; however, the Detroit International Bridge Company withheld the improvements as part of a negotiation strategy. At one point, Matty Moroun and his chief deputy at the Detroit International Bridge Co, Dan Stamper, were jailed for non-compliance with orders to complete the on-ramps.\n\n(c)Traffic Volumes\n\nAfter years of legal battles, activism by local people against neighborhood truck traffic, and stalling by Matty Moroun, the Michigan Department of Transportation took over the I-75/I-96 on-ramp project and opened the ramps in September 2012 after a six-month construction period.\n\nOne possible motive for the delays was Moroun's desire to route traffic past his lucrative duty-free store and fuel pumps, one of only two border locations to sell untaxed fuel (the other is International Falls, Minnesota).\n\nCritics of the duty-free fuel operation objected that sixty cents from each U.S. gallon went not to paving Michigan's underfunded highways, but instead directly to Matty Moroun.\n\nOperators of large trucks under the International Fuel Tax Agreement, which in theory should impose Ontario tax and partially refund Michigan tax on fuel purchased in Detroit and consumed on Ontario's Highway 401, may be disqualified for the Michigan IFTA refund, as the tax was never paid.\n\nIn a 2012 lawsuit, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development sued Moroun's company, Ammex, claiming it mislabeled motorcar fuels as 93 octane while tests showed as little as 91.2 octane.\n\n(d) Repair Issues\n\nIn 2015, Windsor city officials criticized the decaying appearance of the bridge, and called attention to the hazard posed by crumbling concrete from its superstructure.\n\nIn response, Matt Moroun accused the city of attempting to thwart the company's efforts to rebuild or repair the structure because the Canadian government is supporting plans for a new bridge downriver.\n\n(e) Deliberate Blockage of the Bridge\n\nAccess to the Ambassador Bridge was impeded by protesters during the Freedom Convoy 2022 protests in Canada. Protesters at the bridge blockaded it on the 7th. February from about 3 pm. Later that evening, traffic on the bridge came to a complete halt.\n\nThe blockade continued into the 8th. February. On the morning of the 8th., officials declared the bridge reopened, but the blockade later resumed, pushing trips to the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia and Port Huron.\n\nThe blockade shut down traffic on the bridge for about a week, causing disruptions at automobile manufacturing plants on both sides of the border.\n\nThe Detroit–Windsor Tunnel\n\nThe Detroit–Windsor tunnel is an international highway tunnel connecting the cities of Detroit, Michigan, United States and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It is the second-busiest crossing between the United States and Canada, the first being the Ambassador Bridge, which also connects the two cities, which are situated on the Detroit River.\n\nConstruction of the Tunnel\n\nThe Detroit–Windsor tunnel was built by the firm Parsons, Klapp, Brinckerhoff and Douglas (the same firm that built the Holland Tunnel). The executive engineer was Burnside A. Value, the engineer of design was Norwegian-American engineer Søren Anton Thoresen, while fellow Norwegian-American Ole Singstad consulted, and designed the ventilation.\n\nThe method used to construct the tunnel was immersed tube (sections of steel tubing floated into place and sunk into a trench dug in the river bottom).\n\nThe tunnel sections have three main levels. The bottom level brings in fresh air under pressure, which is forced into the mid level, where the traffic lanes are located. The ventilation systems forces vehicle exhaust into the third level, which is then vented at each end of the tunnel.\n\nThe total cost of construction was approximately $25 million (around $313 million in 2020 dollars).\n\nThe river section of the tunnel was connected to bored tunnels on both banks. The tubes were then covered over in the trench by 4 to 20 feet (1.2 to 6.1 m) of mud. Because the tunnel essentially sits on the river bottom, there is a wide no-anchor zone enforced on river traffic.\n\nThe tunnel is 120 feet (37 m) short of a mile at 5,160 feet (1,573 m). At its lowest point, the two-lane roadway is 75 feet (23 m) below the river surface.\n\nCompletion of the Tunnel\n\nThe Detroit–Windsor tunnel was completed in 1930. It was the third underwater vehicular tunnel constructed in the United States, following the Holland Tunnel, between Jersey City, New Jersey, and downtown Manhattan, New York, and the Posey Tube, between Oakland and Alameda, California.\n\nThe cities of Detroit and Windsor hold the distinction of jointly creating both the second and third tunnels between two nations in the world. The Detroit–Windsor tunnel is the world's third tunnel between two nations, and the first international vehicle tunnel.\n\nThe Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, also under the Detroit River, was the second tunnel between two nations. The St. Clair Tunnel, between Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, under the St. Clair River, was the first.\n\nOperations Since 2007\n\nIn 2007, billionaire Manuel Moroun, owner of the nearby Ambassador Bridge, attempted to purchase the American side of the tunnel. In 2008, the City of Windsor controversially attempted to purchase the American side for $75 million, but the deal fell through after a scandal involving then-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.\n\nSoon afterward, the city's finances were badly hit in a recession, and the tunnel's future was in question. Following Detroit's July 2013 bankruptcy filing, Windsor Mayor Eddie Francis said that his city would consider purchasing Detroit's half of the tunnel if it was offered for sale.\n\nOn the 25th. July 2013, the lessor, manager and operator of the tunnel, Detroit Windsor Tunnel LLC, and its parent company, American Roads, LLC, voluntarily filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe American lease was eventually purchased by Syncora Guarantee, a Bermuda-based insurance company. Soon afterward, the lease with Detroit was extended to 2040. Both Syncora and Windsor retained the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel Corporation to manage the daily operations and upkeep of the tunnel.\n\nA $21.6 million renovation of the tunnel began in October 2017 to replace the aging concrete ceiling, along with other improvements to the infrastructure. Completion of the project was initially scheduled for June 2018, but was still ongoing in 2021.\n\nUsage of the Tunnel\n\nAt the point where the Detroit–Windsor tunnel crosses the Canada–United States border; an plaque marking the boundary is displayed between the flags of the two countries.\n\nA 2004 study showed that 150,000 jobs in the region and $13 billion (U.S.) in annual production depend on the Windsor-Detroit international border crossing.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2005, profits from the tunnel peaked, with the cities receiving over $6 million annually. A steep decline in traffic eliminated profits from the tunnel from 2008 until 2012, with a modest recovery in the years since.\n\nTraffic in the Tunnel\n\nAbout 13,000 vehicles a day use the tunnel despite having only one lane in each direction and not allowing large trucks. Historically, the tunnel carried a smaller amount of commercial traffic than other nearby crossings because of physical and cargo restraints, as well as limits on accessing roadways.\n\nPassenger automobile traffic on the tunnel increased from 1972, until it peaked in 1999 at just under 10 million vehicle crossings annually.\n\nAfter 1999, automobile crossings through the tunnel declined, dropping to under 5 million for the first time in over three decades in 2007. Traffic on the tunnel later recovered slightly in the following years when the economy began to improve after 2008.\n\nTunnel Tolls\n\nTolls were last increased on the Canadian side in July 2021.\n\nStandard tolls for non-commercial Canada-bound vehicles are $5 USD and $6.25 CAD; United States-bound tolls are also $5 USD but $6.50 CAD. Commercial vehicles and buses are charged higher rates. Motorcycles, scooters and bicycles are prohibited.\n\nThe Rescue Vehicle\n\nWhen the tunnel first opened in the 1930's the operators had a unique rescue vehicle to tow out broken-down vehicles without having to back in or turn around to perform this role.\n\nThe vehicle had two drivers, one facing in the opposite direction of the other. The vehicle was driven in, the disabled vehicle was hooked up, then the driver facing the other way drove it out. This emergency vehicle also had 600 feet (180 m) of water hose with power drive and chemical fire extinguishers.\n\nCKLW, WJR and the Tunnel\n\nIn the late 1960's, Windsor radio station CKLW AM 800 engineered a wiring setup which has allowed the station's signal to be heard clearly by automobiles traveling through the tunnel. Currently Detroit radio station WJR AM 760 can also be heard clearly in the tunnel.\n\nVentilation of the Tunnel\n\nThe upper and lower levels of the tunnel are used as exhaust and intake air ducts. One hundred-foot ventilation towers on both ends of the tunnel enable air exchange once every 90 seconds.\n\nA great Canadian artist,songwriter and record producer who worked at Motown.\n\nR Dean Taylor - Indiana Wants Me 1970\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=fZL_tZxyBDo\n\nR. Dean Taylor\n\nR. Dean Taylor (born Richard Dean Taylor, 11 May 1939)[1] is a Canadian singer, most notable as a recording artist, songwriter and record producer for Motown during the 1960s and 1970s. According to Jason Ankeny, Taylor \"remains one of the most underrated acts ever to record under the Motown aegis.\"[1]\n\nAs a singer, American audiences know Taylor best for his chart-topping 1970 hit \"Indiana Wants Me\",[2] which hit No. 1 in Cash Box in the United States and was also No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 in the UK. It peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was featured in the opening minutes of the 1980 American movie, The Ninth Configuration. He is well known in the United Kingdom for other hits, including \"Gotta See Jane\" and \"There's a Ghost in My House\".\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Taylor began his career in 1961, as a pianist and singer with several music bands in Toronto. He also made his first recordings in 1961, for the Audiomaster record label. The next year, Taylor's \"At The High School Dance\", a single for Amy-Mala Records, was a minor success. His next single, \"I'll Remember\", on the Barry label, was a No. 23 success for Toronto rock and roll radio station CHUM, and the singer decided to relocate to Detroit, Michigan to further his career.\n\nIn Detroit, Taylor was hired by Motown Records in 1964 as a songwriter and recording artist for the Motown subsidiary V.I.P. label. Taylor's scheduled first single (March 1964) for V.I.P. was the topical satire \"My Ladybug (Stay Away From That Beatle)\", but it was deemed too weak for release and was never issued.\n\nIt was not until November 1965 that Taylor's debut V.I.P. single, \"Let's Go Somewhere\", was issued. It was written by Taylor in conjunction with Brian Holland, and produced by the team of Holland and Lamont Dozier, who had already produced five No. 1 scoring songs for The Supremes. However, the song was only a regional success in several U.S. cities and Toronto.\n\nTaylor's next single (1967's \"There's A Ghost In My House\") was written by the team of Holland–Dozier–Holland along with Taylor, and again produced by Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier. It was also a commercial disappointment in the US — but later it was a No. 3 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1974. Taylor was also beginning to become a songwriter for other acts, as \"I'll Turn to Stone\" by the Four Tops, and \"All I Need\" by The Temptations were both charting US singles in 1967, co-composed by him.\n\nIn 1968, Taylor's self-produced single \"Gotta See Jane\", (co-written with Brian Holland), became a Top 20 hit in the UK.[3] However, his real success came as a member of the Motown writing and production team known as \"The Clan\". This production group was briefly the prime creator of material for Diana Ross & the Supremes after the Holland / Dozier / Holland team left Motown. Among Taylor's successful co-compositions and co-productions during 1968 and 1969 as a member of The Clan were Diana Ross & the Supremes' No. 1 US hit \"Love Child\" and their Top 10 follow-up hit \"I'm Livin' In Shame\".\n\nTaylor resumed his recording career in 1970, becoming one of the first artists assigned to Motown's new subsidiary Rare Earth, which was dedicated to white artists. In that year his first Rare Earth single, \"Indiana Wants Me\", became a No. 1 hit in his native Canada and in Cash Box magazine in the US. It peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and at No. 2 in the UK. \"Gotta See Jane\" was also reissued in 1971, and became a Top 10 success in Canada. His 1972 single \"Taos New Mexico\" did not do well on the Canadian charts.\n\nTaylor continued recording for Rare Earth, and working as a writer / producer for other artists until Rare Earth was ended in 1976. Though he never again scored the charts as he had done with \"Indiana Wants Me\", his releases did moderately well, especially in Canada. As a Canadian citizen, he could be played on CKLW and other Canadian radio stations and counted towards the stations' Canadian content quotas.\n\nTaylor attempted a comeback during the early 1980s, after which he had a hiatus from the music industry. He also established his own record company, Jane Records.\n\nDiscography\n\nSingles\n\nAudio Master releases\n\n1961: \"At The High School Dance\"\n\nBarry releases\n\n1962: \"At The High School Dance\"\n\n1962: \"We Fell In Love As We Tangoed\"\n\n1962: \"I'll Remember\"(Toronto (CHUM) No. 23)\n\nMala releases\n\n1963: \"It's A Long Way To St. Louis\"\n\nV.I.P. releases\n\n1965: \"Let's Go Somewhere\" (Toronto (CHUM) No. 39)\n\n1967: \"There's a Ghost in My House\"\n\n1967: \"Gotta See Jane\" (UK No. 17 summer 1968, NL No. 32)\n\nRare Earth releases\n\n1970: \"Indiana Wants Me\" (Canada No. 1, US Billboard No. 5, US Cashbox No. 1, UK No. 2, South Africa No. 3) (RE 5013)\n\n1971: \"Ain't It A Sad Thing\" (Canada No. 35, US No. 66) (RE 5023)\n\n1971: \"Gotta See Jane\" [re-issue] (Canada No. 12, US No. 67) (RE 5004)\n\n1971: \"Candy Apple Red\" (Canada No. 69, US No. 104)\n\n1972: \"Taos, New Mexico\" (Canada No. 48, US No. 83, US Adult Contemporary No. 28, NL No. 22) (RE 5041)\n\n1973: \"Shadow\" (Canada No. 75) (RE 5041)\n\nPolydor releases\n\n1974: \"Window Shopping\" (UK No. 36)\n\n1974: \"Walkin' In The Sun\"\n\n1976: \"We'll Show Them All\" (Can.
