        "text": "“It is finished.”\n\nIt is what is called Holy Week. We do not confer holiness, but we call things names. When I googled “Easter” almost all the images were bunnies and chocolate. We define the word “Easter” this way, now.\n\nSued\n\nSince June 13, 2022, Duo Dickinson, architect has been under threat of being sued by Temple Beth Tikvah. Apparently, 370 drawings, over 150 Project Meetings, over 200 field meetings, and over 5000 emails taking 5,367 hours were deemed inadequate, despite the finished result, built all through COVID.\n\nIntrepid Explorers\n\n“We are going to The Octagon House!” my mother chirped one afternoon. I was 4 years old; I think. If so, it was the summer of 1959. My father’s general law\n\npractice of the mid-century allowed him to do trusts and estates, public offerings,\n\neven a few criminal representations. But that general practice also allowed him to\n\nrepresent the author Carl Carmer, too. And the Carmer’s invited the Dickinson’s to dinner, all of us, in the fully amazing “Octagon House” a Victorian marvel of domed ornament and material.\n\nOne Meal A Day\n\n4.5 months ago I was just fine.\n\nBut then, at the Spring Solstice, a 61.5 year old blood tube decided it’s inadequate middle layer had performed as long as it could: it blew, the tube blew, part of my brain was flooded and I lost (only) balance.\n\n1) Plan. 2) Section. 3) Elevation\n\nIn the dim past, some sage architect looked at me and said:\n\n“There is one way to describe a building, one sequence. Plan. Section. Elevation. In that order. One defines the other. Once you start there then they all change each other.”\n\nOccupation Preoccupation\n\nI have no hobbies.\n\nOh, today I will plant perhaps a dozen begonias, 3 bleeding hearts, and assorted other summer plants. But this beautiful Saturday morning I will spend 3 hours driving to and spending time with strangers to look at a potential deck site for a couple. We have, as always, over 50 active projects in my architecture office, and I have 6 employees. Over 30 years.\n\nAstonishing\n\nIt has been 4 months. I offered the situation to no one, but I wrote about it – twice, including a national venue. http://www.mbird.com/2017/05/an-irrational-lack-of-fear/\n\nPlease forgive a Thrombus coda, but a handful might appreciate it.\n\nOnly Consistency Allows Change\n\nA Bishop and I talk.\n\nNot often, but enough. Through these two years our jobs, to lead, listen, act and create have remained the same. But everything else has changed. Everywhere.\n\n“In the name of the Bee – And of the Butterfly – And of the Breeze – Amen!”\n\nWe are at the end of the Triduum – the three days of Easter. “Three Times The Charm” is chanted after two failures. Plato (and the Baha’i faith) defined the mind/body/spirit essence of humanity. Triple plays, third downs, Musketeers, trifectas now The Tennessee Three.\n\nWHAT IS GONE IS BACK AGAIN Bruce Barber and I went to high school together 45 years ago: Over the last decade, Bruce has included me in his creative machinations, both of us trying to find connection to the world at a time of change and opportunity: This is a third iteration of a very human effort: (click here to read more)"
