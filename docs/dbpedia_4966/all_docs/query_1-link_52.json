I am happy to know that there are others who feel as I do about Dan Hicks. And, I'm not speaking as a fanatic or obsessive devotee ... I finally understand why an old friend was trying to expose me to the music several years ago. He's no longer stomping the terra, but I checked out a show in 1993(?) at the <a href=\"http://www.bellyup.com/\">Belly-Up Tavern</a> in Solana Beach, CA, where I was working and realized the favorite songs on the \"Muzak\" tapes the owner made were Dan's. Also, in case you're listening (Marianne does !!) sorry about playing \"Vinny...\" when you walked into the bar that day, I know it pissed you off. I hope Dan plays in London UK someday, as I am moving.\n\nI'll keep in touch with the list.\n\nta ra morganism\n\nName::\n\nStacie Endicott\n\nEmail::\n\ncourtldy@aol.com\n\nDate:\n\n04 Apr 2000\n\nTime:\n\n22:42:31\n\nMy trip to Hicksville was...\n\nOh God!

When he heard the recent jazzier songs I brought over, he said, you know, you really ought to send some of this material to Dan..which I'd like to do, got a Po box for me, or an address?..just made a kinda jazzy CD with friends in NAshville, where I'd been a couple years, after Billy and i hit our customary two year wall in Europe..but all's well now, we may do some stuff later in the summer. Nuff said, love to hear from you, and send you a reckid. My address is 2302 Brookhaven Dr. Yardley. PA 19067, #215-369-3220. Hope you're well, drop a line..\n\nall the best, Frank\n\nName::\n\nNorm J\n\nEmail::\n\ntwodeer@beer.com\n\nDate:\n\n14 Apr 2000\n\nTime:\n\n20:38:09\n\nMy trip to Hicksville was...\n\nlike a haunt from da good ol' days of a US Army rented apartment in Alexandria VA 1972.

What an absolute treat and release his music has been for me. When ever I need or feel like a pick-me-up I slide the cassette in. I was driving to work today and the Lord only knows what brought Dan to mind. But, there the thoughts of his music were and the tape wasn't handy. Is the the bugger still alive, I wondered? I had not heard anything about him in years. I've missed him. Well, I crawled on to the internet and decided to do a search. He lives! I'll be loading up on some of the recordings I don't have. Man, it's peculiar, isn't it, how there are tunes or images that remain with you for a lifetime. Dan's work has been on the edge of my thoughts for 2+ decades now.

Actually, a local news columnist recently discovered Dan Hicks for the first time, (I don't KNOW where he's been) & mentioned it in a column. I took out my vinyls, gave 'em a dusting, & have been humming my old favorites for a couple of weeks now. I thought I'd check out Dan's latest shennanigans for myself & was pleased to find this (well-executed) site. Yes, I'll buy the new CD. And, if Dan comes a little closer to Kansas, I'll venture out to a concert. Thanks for your hospitality. I enjoyed the visit.

It just never came up until one of those - \"Hey, I bet you'd like this music\" conversations. Having met with puzzled stares from many of my friends who consider Mariah Carrey(urk) an \"edgy\" music choice, you can imagine my hesitation at bringing this up to my future(at the time) husband. We already talked about Ricky Lee J., Joni Mitchell, my love of folk, jazz and swing music and his long-time devotion to the less traditional form of bluegrass.. This was the next logical subject.\n\nGlad you are all out there.\n\nCris and Selwyn/Atlanta Ga.\n\nName::\n\nBill Hawayek\n\nEmail::\n\nhawkeye@fastband.com\n\nDate:\n\n22 Aug 2000\n\nTime:\n\n07:48:18\n\nMy trip to Hicksville was...\n\nEnjoyed the Dan info, many thanks.

Been a fan since I saw Dan and the gang on Carson back in '71 or so, saw the classic Hot Licks lineup twice during their heyday, even had a long message board discussion w/John Girton about 7-8 years ago. I've only seen Dan and the Warriors once (he don't seem to get down to south Fla very much).\n\nAmazing how much of the good music I listen to has come into my life via hixdom. Artists from Bob Wills to Lambert Hendricks and Ross to Stephane Grappelli and everywhere in between: all from conversations with other Hicksvillians about the roots of Dan's music and \"What else do you like\".\n\nName::\n\njohn herlehy\n\nEmail::\n\njohnnycisplatin@aol.com\n\nDate:\n\n26 Aug 2000\n\nTime:\n\n09:11:40\n\nMy trip to Hicksville was..."
