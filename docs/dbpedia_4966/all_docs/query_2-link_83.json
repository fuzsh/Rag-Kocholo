        "text": "Generally speaking the Album Rock stations played mostly from vinyl. I was on the air at a rock station here in Miami and we were 100% from vinyl until sometime in late 84 when the sations first 2 CD players were installed. They were Sony consumer units! The best part was since we had to fire them from their remote control which would obviously be in our hand, half the time they didn't start and we'd be sitting there talking into the mic while pointing the stupid remote at the player off to our left side and hoping it would start!\n\nClear channel leads the way in the above technology. I was working for them when they just started that system in South Florida. All of their stations here have their music uploaded on a server.\n\nThe station I work for now which is not a clear channel station also has the music on computer but we do have CD's in the studio and still use them from time to time.\n\nSeeeeeeeeeeeeYa, Bruce\n\nCollege radio still plays vinyl. Before it turned into KEXP, I remember driving through Seattle with KCMU on and hearing that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi album on World Pacific.\n\nI was a DJ during high school in the mid/late 80's, and I remember when CD's were being played, but it was still somewhat of a novelty. The mainstream stations were in \"transition\" during this time. Meanwhile, we high school radio people had the vinyl and we also played from cassettes. We did have carts too, I was the music director for awhile and I would select 20 or so songs that I felt should go into rotation. That would change every week or so.\n\nI know at the same time, record labels were trying to phase out vinyl completely, and it worked for most pop genres at the time. But country and hip-hop had its supporters, so you will see your share of white label promo 45's for both genres, meant specifically for radio. So I would say late 80's/early 90's.\n\nMy question is, I know a lot of stations still play CD's but when did the big transition from CD's to digital files start? I had participated in a radio contest a few years ago (which I didn't win), and I was still stuck in the 80's. I got there, and the guy at the station told me that the station is generally automated, and it could run itself for a week without anyone knowing. I know I've often read how Clear Channel's database is located somewhere in Colorado or something, and basically the program director at a local radio station is nothing more than \"maintentance\", or the equivalent of the janitor. I know that's not the case everywhere, but it felt like it.\n\nThat's pretty much how it was for me too when I was in college radio. At first I had a helluva time getting record labels to even service us with CD singles and full lengths. By the beginning of 1990 that started to change. WEA was always the best when it came to DJ service. Sony and EMI were the toughest nuts to crack, but eventually they came around too. A lot of stuff just came automatically through the mail, both CD's and vinyl. If there was anything extra we needed, I found that I could always call the local promo people and they would send it to us. Amazing since it wasn't like we were a big P-1 FM station, but they realized that we were having some influence on their future programming choices. So sending the little college guys some CD's and vinyl was a lot cheaper than fulfilling the outrageous demands(take your pick of what that might be ) of a big station PD."
