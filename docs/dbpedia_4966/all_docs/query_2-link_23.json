        "text": "SEPTEMBER 2023 Highlights from Six Years of “Spotlight” Interviews David Green’s last broadcast was organized around clips from some of his favorite Spotlight broadcasts over the last six years.

AUGUST 2023 RiseUP for Arts and Public Art Murals in Connecticut We focused our August “Spotlight” on RiseUP for Arts, a member organization that, though based in Hartford, is active in organizing mural projects around Connecticut, including in our region of Fairfield County. We speak with executive director Matt Conway about how this organization trains artists, negotiates with municipalities and building owners, raises funds and coordinates the completion of amazing murals, often working with young people. Other guests include three artists involved in RiseUP projects: Alissa Siegal, Lauren Clayton and John Paul O’Grodnick as well as with building owner Mitchell Kidd, with The Wellbuilt Company, that has sponsored murals in Stamford, and Marc Alan, with the Norwalk Arts & Culture Commission.Check out this program and learn about the impact this organization, and the murals it coordinates, are making in our region. JULY 2023 Good to Great: Transforming Cultural Organizations Our July “Spotlight” shined a light on 9 quite different organizations in our region who received the highly competitive “Good to Great” grant, jointly administered by the CT Office of the Arts and CT Humanities, designed to help transform the visitor experience at their institutions. The grant is awarded to “organizations of all sizes who demonstrate deep thinking about who they are as organizations, and what they could be if granted access to capital funding.” We thought this was a great opportunity to spotlight these organizations, the work they do, and how they will be using their grants to transform their organizations.\n\nOur guests were:\n\n• Cybele Maylone, Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield\n\n• Peter Gistelinck, Avon Theatre Film Center, Stamford\n\n• Kathy Maher, Barnum Museum, Bridgeport\n\n• Tracy Kay, Bartlett Arboretum & Gardens, Stamford\n\n• Howard Lasser, Brookfield Craft Center, Brookfield\n\n• Hilary Wittmann, Carriage Barn Arts Center, New Canaan\n\n• Clare Murray, cARTie, Shelton\n\n• Maggie Dimock, Greenwich Historical Society, Greenwich\n\n• Steve di Costanzo, WPKN, Bridgeport\n\nJUNE 2023 The ACE Awardees: The Role of the Arts & Culture in Building Community As we celebrate our ACE Awardees (see details here), we interviewed them on our June show about the role that community plays in their work. At our June 21 awards breakfast we will focus on how the arts and culture is the glue for our communities, highlighting the significant role that artists and arts and cultural institutions play in connecting communities across government, businesses, nonprofit agencies, educational institutions and municipalities.

The arts especially can breathe new life into old buildings when they are smartly and sensitively restored. This month we look at the journey that two groups took in finding the right space for their arts organization, how they redeveloped the buildings they found, and what the impact has been. The Norwalk Art Space opened in June 2021 and greeted 14,000 visitors in its first year. Metro Art Studios in Bridgeport opened in November 2021. Both buildings won Awards of Merit from PreservationCT in 2022. In addition, we look at a building that is currently being restored and renovated for use as an art space: The Granite Church in Redding.\n\nOur guests are:\n\n• Jane Davila, Executive Director, Metro Art Studios, Bridgeport\n\n• Robin Panovka, The Norwalk Art Space\n\n• Richard Wenning, Executive Director, Be Foundation, Co-founder at SpreadMusicNow & Granite Church\n\n• Christopher Wigren, Deputy Director, Preservation Connecticut\n\nAPRIL 2023 The Arts and Healing For our April broadcast we examined the power of creative expression as a means of coping, healing, and restoration.

Debra Greenwood leads the Center for Family Justice, and Edith Boyle, LifeBridge. They are joined by multidisciplinary Bridgeport artist Alicia Cobb, who has been working with both organizations. FEBRUARY 2023 The Meaning of Black History Month Hear from Maisa Tisdale, President and CEO of The Mary & Eliza Freeman Center for History and Community, and Pam Lewis, Executive Director of Connect-Us, about the meaning of Black History Month: how it got started, what its importance is today for all of us, and especially for young black people. JANUARY 2023 2023: Artists Looking Back/Looking Forward For our first broadcast of 2023 we invited a range of artists to look back at their highlights of 2022 and what they were looking forward to in 2023. Most were still feeling the impacts of COVID in various ways. Many were looking forward to recalibrating their public:private balance – some looking forward to more studio time, others to more public engagement.

Jonathan Yates, on the other hand, has been Music Director at the Norwalk Symphony and the Norwalk Youth Symphony since 2011. Hear how these orchestras found creative ways to respond to the COVID challenge to keep audiences connected, and how they continue to plan new ways of expanding their audiences and attracting new sponsors through increasingly creative and innovative programs.\n\nNOVEMBER 2022 Giving Thanks for Arts Support in Connecticut In our November “Spotlight on Arts & Culture” we took advantage of the season, and of the recent election results, to give thanks – for the support that the arts and culture sector receives from our state legislature, as well as from individual donors, our local businesses and family foundations.

It is located in a beautifully renovated Christian Science Church adjacent to Norwalk’s Mathews Park. The visionary founder of The Norwalk Art Space was Alexandra Korry, who died before the building was finished and the Space was opened last June.
