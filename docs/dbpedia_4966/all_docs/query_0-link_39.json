        "text": "After decades of making music around the world, Paul Winter returns to Connecticut for a special benefit concert to support WPKN 89.5 FM radio on Saturday, May 12, at 8 p.m. at the Unitarian Church in Westport, CT. Grammy-Award Winning Saxophonist Paul Winter is a long-time WPKN supporter and listener, and honorary fundraising chair for the current year. He is donating his time and talent for this benefit concert to generate support for WPKN, a non-commercial, community radio station based in Bridgeport, Connecticut that raises a major portion of its operating funds through its listeners. Joining Mr. Winter will be pianist Paul Sullivan from the Paul Winter Consort.\n\nPaul Winter’s roots were in traditional Jazz and Bossa Nova. In 1967, he abandoned this format in favor of a lineup that featured non-Western instruments. The Paul Winter Consort, as the band was renamed, became one of the earliest exponents of world music, combining elements from various African, Asian, and South American cultures with jazz. The Consort's 1972 release, Icarus, was produced by George Martin. After hearing the songs of humpback whales, he was inspired to create a new form of music which would bring together elements of music from around the world as well as animal songs, thus creating an “orchestra of the entire world”. In response he created “Earth Music”, a vital celebration of the creatures and cultures of the whole earth as a way of using the power of music to achieve conservation, social justice and other ends. His music label, “ Living Music” has produced dozens of albums, and his Winter and Summer Solstice Celebration have become a tradition at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine where musicians and audience members from around the world come together to celebrate and make music in a spiritually charged atmosphere.\n\nWPKN 89.5 FM, and online at www.wpkn.org, now in its 50th year of broadcasting, wishes to thank Paul Winter and the Unitarian Church of Westport for their generosity. General admission tickets are $45, and VIP seating and a pre-concert reception with Paul Winter and WPKN programmers is available for $75, and are available for purchase online at www.brownpapertickets.com/event/241004. For more information call 203-331-9756.\n\nCONCERT SITE: The Unitarian Church, 10 Lyons Plains Rd, Westport, CT 06880\n\nTIME: Concert at 8 p.m., doors open at 7:30 p.m.\n\nMore about WPKN:"
