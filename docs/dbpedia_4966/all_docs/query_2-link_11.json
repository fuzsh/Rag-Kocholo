        "text": "NEARLY 22 years ago Bill Nolan was cruising down Interstate 95 in his apple-red Mustang flipping the radio knob and searching for the answer to his prayers. Mr. Nolan's passion was 50's rock and roll, which at the time had all but faded from the American memory, he said. As a record collector and devotee of music from the early-rock era, he said, he knew he could help spark new interest in it if only he could find a station that would allow him to broadcast his message. After switching to 89.5 on the FM dial, WPKN at the University of Bridgeport, Mr. Nolan said, he knew his search had ended.\n\n\"I remember they were playing some pretty hot acid rock,\" he said, \"real controversial, pre-Woodstock stuff that the commercial stations wouldn't touch.\"\n\nSoon after, Mr. Nolan, who works for the Ansonia Copper and Brass Corporation, became the station's first volunteer program host with a Sunday evening program called \"Antique Blues.\" Using his record collection, he sought to educate as much as entertain, he said. By the mid-1970's \"Antique Blues\" had attracted a faithful audience, and Mr. Nolan founded an organization for lovers of rhythm-and-blues music, the R. & B. Society, which he called the first group in the country devoted to promoting rock and roll. The society now has 50,000 members worldwide, he said. 'Hobgoblin of Little Minds'\n\nMr. Nolan's debut also changed the character of WPKN, which had been a training ground for broadcasting students. Now operated by 120 volunteers with a drive to promote music and points of view not often covered by the commercial media, WPKN has built its reputation on its eclectic and often unpredictable approach, said the station manager, Harry Minot.\n\n\"Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, 'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,' \" said Mr. Minot, the station's only paid employee. \"Here at WPKN we have made it a point to take our listeners down roads they normally wouldn't travel.\"\n\nTwo years ago when the university, faced with mounting financial problems, cut the station's $90,000 budget, WPKN's listeners came to its rescue. With the help of its staff and more than 150 more volunteers, the station raised $100,000 during a monthlong on-the-air fund-raising campaign that has since become an annual event held each October. As part of its independent status, said Mr. Minot, WPKN has become the only listener-supported radio station in New England, and perhaps the country, that accepts no program underwriting, commercial advertising, grants or membership dues. He added that WPKN's transition to self-supporting status has unified the station and brought its personalities closer to their listeners, who often drop by for coffee, attend monthly meetings and come on the air to oppose the views expressed in commentaries.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
