        "text": "Tomorrow, 5.11.12, I’ll be a guest on Del’s “In Transition” show in the eight o’clock hour. We’ll be listening to some recent productions I’ve put together at Gold Coast Recorders and talking shop about music, audio, love, loss, and life. In addition to being a radio host and rocknroll aficionado Del is a veteran audio tech with a long resume that includes many of the greatest recording studios in NYC. So it promises to be an interesting chat. Listen in at 8AM tomorrow EST at 89.5FM in the New York Metro Area or stream it live at www.wpkn.org.\n\nUPDATE: This segment has aired and can now+forever be streamed from the WPKN archive. Click on this link to listen. My bit comes in around the sixty-minute mark. One correction: in the piece I state that my tenure at SONY began in 1991; this is not correct. I started in 2001. Blame it on the A – M."
