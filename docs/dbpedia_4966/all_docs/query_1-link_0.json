He is graciously giving me two hours of airtime to play and talk about my music that I’ve produced, written and recorded (sometimes all three!).. WPKN is one of the most esteemed and respected community radio stations in the country and the subject of a 2021 documentary film, \"The Greatest Radio Station in the World\". You can listen in worldwide on wpkn.org.\n\nWay back when in 1981, I began as a volunteer at community radio station WPKN in Bridgeport, CT at the tender age of 11. John Lennon had just been assassinated, and after listening to several radio specials of final interviews and tributes, I wanted to make my own. Harry Minot, then general manager, gave me hands-on training in audio production. I stuck around for three years, learning the ropes, doing production on the evening newscast and listening to any kind of music I could find in their expansive record library. Then I went on to be a classical DJ for WMNR in nearby Monroe before I moved away to St. Louis. Now Harry has asked me to guest host a special show highlighting my work. I'm honored to be asked and feel fortunate for having had an experience that put me on the path to being a producer, composer and musician."
