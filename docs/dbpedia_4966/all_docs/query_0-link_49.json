        "meta_description": "“The Greatest Radio Station in the World” is the title of a new documentary film about radio station WPKN, located in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nWPKN began as the University of Bridgeport’s college radio station in 1963. It has been operating as a listener supported, community based radio station since 1989. There are only two paid staffers…the General Manager is full-time, and the Operations Manager is part-time. All of the Programmers are volunteers.\n\nThe film will be carried by this cast of characters, as well as the listeners, station volunteers, and DJ’s from the past. We will hear interviewees share their personal, idiosyncratic stories, speaking passionately about their love of music, news, politics, health, cars, organic gardening, space exploration, and culture.\n\nLike the radio station, this film is fearless, boldly independent, free form, and unconventional. WPKN prides itself as being a real alternative to an increasingly homogeneous broadcast radio landscape. It enriches the lives of their listeners while promoting diversity, tolerance, and freedom of expression.",
