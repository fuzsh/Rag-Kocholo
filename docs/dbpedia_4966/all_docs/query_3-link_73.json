        "text": "JONAH AND OTTO, by celebrated UK playwright Robert Holman, began performances last night and the official Opening is set for next Wednesday, February 8th at The Lion Theatre at Theatre Row, 410 West 42 Street.\n\nOne of the production's two stars, Sean Gormley, is this week's special guest on the popular WPKN Radio (89.5 FM) program \"State of the Arts,\" airing today (Friday) at noon. The segment can be heard online at www.wpkn.org. Under the direction of Geraldine Hughes, Jonah and Otto also stars Rupert Simonian.\n\nIn 2003, Jonah is 26, Otto, 57-two men different in every way. But not everything is what it seems when their two lives collide one summer's night in a mysterious walled garden on the south coast of England. As their stories of love and loss unravel in front of us and memories of the past unturned come to light, on parting, neither can be the same again. Robert Holman's play is a deeply humane, funny and ultimately haunting exploration of what it is to be alive.\n\nSean Gormley is a company member of Irish Rep. NY: THE WEIR, DA, TRANSPORT, ARISTOCRATS, THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE, YEATS PROJECT, THE SHAUGHRAUN (Irish Rep); A DAY BY THE SEA (Mint Theater); NORA, SHADOW OF THE GLEN (Marvell Rep); LADIES AND GENTS (Irish Arts Center); THE GOOD THIEF (solo performance at Players Theatre directed by John Keating); ROSS (Storm Theatre). Regional: SUCKER PUNCH (Studio Theatre DC), DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE, MACBETH, WAITING FOR LEFTY, ANTIGONE, THE RESISTIBLE RISE OF ARTURO UI, HELLHOUND ON MY TRAIL, RIDERS TO THE SEA, HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. Film/TV: \"Person of Interest,\" \"Treme,\" \"The Edge,\" \"Z: The Beginning of Everything,\" WHAT MAISIE KNEW, FALLING APPLES.\n\nRupert Simonian was born in London. At 26 he has already appeared in numerous films including THE CONSTANT GARDENER, SKYFALL, PETER PAN, KEEPING MUM, THE BOYS ARE BACK, PICCADILLY JIM, FINDING HER, and DOWNHILL. TV credits include \"Foyle's War,\" \"Ashes to Ashes,\" \"Murdoch Mysteries,\" \"Not Going Out,\" \"X Company,\" \"Appropriate Adult,\" \"Life Bites\" (Disney), \"Hidden,\" \"Doctors,\" \"Murderland,\" \"Le Grande,\" and \"The Bill.\" Rupert received an Off West End Award nomination in the Best Actor category for his acclaimed performance in PUNK ROCK (UK tour). Other theatre credits include FIREFACE (Young Vic), TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (Royal Exchange Manchester) and THREE KINGDOMS (London and EU tour).\n\nRenowned playwright Robert Holman is making his New York debut with Jonah and Otto. He is an acknowledged inspiration for many of the younger generation of British playwrights including, most notably, David Eldridge and Simon Stephens (CURIOUS INCIDENT WITH THE DOG IN THE NIGHT, HEISENBERG, PUNK ROCK). In 2010, the three collaborated on A THOUSAND STARS EXPLODE IN THE SKY at the Lyric Hammersmith. Robert Holman's plays have been produced at the Royal Shakespeare Company, The National Theatre, Royal Court Theatre, Donmar Warehouse, Bush Theatre, and throughout the UK. Internationally, Robert Holman has had his work produced in Chicago, L.A. and Tokyo, among other cities. He has served as resident dramatist at both the RSC and the National Theatre.\n\nDirector Geraldine Hughes is also an actress whose career has spanned Broadway (JERUSALEM, TRANSLATIONS), Off-Broadway (MOLLY SWEENEY, PUMPGIRL), films (GRAN TORINO, ROCKY BALBOA, DUPLEX), and TV (\"The Good Wife,\" \"The Blacklist,\" \"ER,\" \"Nurse Jackie\"). She received the Los Angeles Ovation, Garland and Drama Critics Circle Awards for Outstanding Performance for her solo play BELFAST BLUES, which she also wrote and which ran Off-Broadway at the Culture Project and Barrow Street.\n\nSet design for Jonah and Otto is by Ann Beyersdorfer, with lighting design by Kate Bashore, costume design by Katie Sue Nicklos, and sound design by Ian Wehrle.\n\nThe playing schedule is Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8pm, with matinees Saturday at 2pm and Sunday at 3pm through February 25th. Tickets are $50 and are available through www.Telecharge.com 212-239-6200. Student tickets (with valid student ID) are available for $23. Jonah and Otto is being presented Off-Broadway by Lost Tribe Theatre (www.losttribetheatrefilm.com) and Firefly Theater & Films (www.fireflyinc.com).\n\nComments\n\nTo post a comment, you must register and login."
