        "text": "Housatonic Community College Theatre\n\nCob Carlson’s new two hour documentary about WPKN, The Greatest Radio Station in the World, will have a screening at Housatonic Community College, in the Black Box Theater 900 Lafayette Street on Saturday. It is being brought to the community by the Bridgeport History Center, in conjunction with the Theatre Arts Department at Housatonic Community College, and WPKN.\n\nThe film tells the 60-year history of WPKN (launched in 1962) with a great deal of color, in-depth interviews with employees, programmers, station volunteers, and listeners going back to the founding, and unique “found” footage. The film highlights the city of Bridgeport and its integral role as the home for WPKN. Carlson will host a Q&A session with the audience after the screening.\n\nA trailer for the film can be found at https://vimeo.com/714993269\n\nAbout the film’s producer Cob Carlson:\n\nCob Carlson was born in Bridgeport and grew up in Fairfield. He attended Fairfield Prep High School. Cob has been a film editor/producer for 33 years, the past 30 spent in Boston. Cob has worked on documentaries, feature films, major network television programs, music videos, trailers, commercials, and web videos of all kinds. He is currently an adjunct professor at Eastern Connecticut State University. His 16-millimeter documentary film, An Irish American Story, about his grandmother who lived in the South End of Bridgeport, received critical acclaim and was broadcast on PBS in 1998. He also produced the 2015 feature-length golf documentary Donald Ross: Discovering the Legend."
