They moved across the street to the Stratford side when Steve Kochiss had a falling out with SaL, and the old Micalizzi's became the Kitten Club which was run by Mrs. Fry.

The main mechanic at the city line garage was Ralph Mingalello, who opened his own garage at the foot of Grand Street across from Frankie's Dinner, and then opened the school bus lease to the city. Ralph passed way July 7, 2005, at St. Vincent Medical Center; How about Honest John's Pawn Shop on Barnum Avenue which was owned and operated by Phil Smackey; Dugan's Bakery was behind Maraczi's, and Borck and Stevens Bakery on Barnum Avenue, now Borck's Country Home Bakery; Abe Newman was the manager of the \"The Time Saver Auto Wash\" behind Maraczi's and also manager of the bowling alleys. His brother Dave was the actual owner of the auto wash; How about the Italian pastry shop on Pembroke St across from Edo's? The owner was my (Marianne D'Allura Rinaldi's) very tall, very kind Grandpa, who made the best canoli and lemon ice, not to mention the most memorable wedding cakes. As an infant I slept in a cookie box as my mother worked in the store with her parents; The screeching chickens from Joel Levines chicken market also on the Eastside; Yetta, the wonderful woman who worked as the head bookkeeper; What about the Eastside gang, THE HORSEMEN; ? I accidentally caught the tail end of one of their gang fights when I was 10 down on Cedar St. Still, they were pacifists by today's standards! Sharp dressers, too, black cashmere coats and some of them wore berets as I recall. How about the social club on East Main Street where the \"boys\" hung out, and the owner's dog, a boxer named Yogi who always hung out right there asleep under a wire chair - the club's name was the Amiga Club...I think; That was at time when everyone had work. In fact the buses ran all night in order to serve the many factories that were so busy they had 3 shifts. A bum named \"Whammy\" who wandered the East End and who would sing the Al Jolson song using the word 'whammy' instead of 'mammy' and would tell you that Al Capone killed his sister. He usually had a dog with him, and when he did, you didn't go near \"Whammy\"; When you got a new bike and it was from Watson's on East Main Street you knew you had made it to the big time!; Remember going downtown the day after Thanksgiving to watch the Christmas lights being lit! And those hot & salty nuts & real popped popcorn from \"Morrow's Nut House\" on the corner of Main Street and Fairfield Avenue; I don't know if you remember Valley Farms hot dog stand on Boston Ave. I used to live right behind there. I went down there about 4 or 5 weeks ago to get a hot dog and it had been burnt down. Boy, all those memories gone. I was talking to the owner, whom I grew up with, and it will be rebuilt, but to me will never be the same. Had a lot of good times there and lot of good hot dogs; The Bridgeport Harbor tugboat, the \"Mary P. McKenna\", operating in the Pequonnock River in 1953: View; The Carpenter Steel mill was originally Stanley Works; Peck's Lot on Stratford Ave - it had a grand old home that was demolished for the Thruway; PAL shoeshine boxes; Madris shirts that \"bled\" and khaki's; Hickey and Star cabs; \"Murray the K\" on the Swinging Swaree with a blast from the past; 1010 WINS NY, Cousin Brucey on 77 WABC; Del Prete's Italian Rum Cakes; Charles \"Buddy\" Breene (now deceased) was the \"special cop\" that patroled Pleasure Beach and also had a post on ground floor of Read's Dept. store right in front of the elevator.

The cost of admission in the 50's was a nickel. St. Michael's Grammar School on the first block of Pulaski Street, between East Main Street and Kossuth Street. Across Kossuth Street was the Frisbie Pie Company and Bullard Havens Technical School. Directly across East Main from Pulaski Street was Krentzman's Variety Store, where we bought Spaldeens, baseball cards, jet airplane cards, water pistols, pea shooters, and even the occasional note book. The second block of Pulaski Street, between Kossuth Street and the railroad tracks and across from Bullard Havens, was the location for a while of a raunchy block where things went on that we did not understand until we were quite a bit older; \"Sylvo's\" Barber Shop in Success Park; The East Side Florist where my dad always got my big yellow chrysanthemum corsage with the blue ribbon and gold \"H\" which I wore when I escorted him to the Thanksgiving Day Harding-Central games; John the Butcher and the Olympia Chicken Market on East Main Street; Also on Pembroke Street was \"Joseph Curiale and Sons\" Tailor Shop that was there for at least 50 years. On a Saturday afternoon all the chairs in the shop were filled with all the locals stopping in to chat; Lookin' so \"Boss\" in your brand new Shark Skin \"Continental\" suit, from Jerrys Apparel I believe, along with your Flag Brothers Cuban heel matador shoe/boot. From an anonymous member: \"Billy Joel had it right when he said \"Ditty Bop\" - I was a Ditty Bopper in those days. I did the Shimmy and the Mashed Potatoes and we did Splits (that hurts to think about). The Cool Jerk was BOSS, and the walk, it had to have that \"Avenue Strut\" with the backs of your hand facing forward, the wrist a little cocked tight to the thighs, the fingers pointing to the back and no arm sway, but the shoulders would lead the way your hands normally do. The head did its' own little slide & snap with each step. It was all an attitude. Too cool!\" The Frisbie pie store on Kossuth St. where my friends and I would buy pies with the broken top crust; Krentzman's store on East Main St. where you could get the best candies and shakes and malteds, etc; Olson's variety on East Main where I would purchase packs of baseball cards for my collection; the Homestead Bar and Restaurant where I would stare in the window at my Uncle Ted until he would have me come in for chips and soda; walking to St. Cyrils during all kinds of weather and waiting for the hot and humid days of summer to play stick ball in the huge backyard with the neighborhood kids; The aromas of the local bakeries, the French Baking company, Richesolphs, and the Italian Bakery around the corner. What Smells!!! All in all, it was great growing up in such a diverse neighborhood. Do you remember the B&T Diner on Stratford Ave? We lived right around the corner from it just before I95 was build and took the diner. They had the very best food and Naomi Britlin (?) who co-owned it with her husband Eddie was always so nice to us children. Had the best homemade donuts and crullers, fish and chips, pie, you name it! Wish someone had photos or memories of that diner to share about it . It was a favorite spot for many and it was always crowded. Coffee was 10 cents! Ms. Dorothy Kaplan, a favorite teacher at Lincoln School. How about the guys who cut our hair and gave us those fabulous \"Flat Tops\" back-in-the-day, like Joe Kanski, one of the barbers at the Lincoln Barber Shop on Stratford Ave across from Lincoln School. Steve's Market, on White Street. The horse stables at Glenwood Avenue. When my parents would go shopping at the A & P on Boston Avenue, we children tagged along during the summer months. Our favorite thing to do after shopping was to go to Uncle Miltie's, a \"greasy spoon\" located on the street next to the A & P. As Dad was checking the groceries out and paying the bill, Mom would take us to Uncle Miltie's. We each had about 50 cents allowance which was big money to a kid in the mid to late 1950's. We would each order two hamburgers which cost 24 cents for the two. We would get french fries and I would always get a Royal Crown Cola. The whole meal was less than 50 cents. The burgers were greasy, but very tasty to the young palate. Many times, I would hand Uncle Miltie or his wife my 50 cents and the change I received back was always more than that. Being brought up in the right way, I always told them that they gave me too much money back. To this day, I don't know if it was a test to see how honest I was or if they just couldn't count correctly. I tend to think it was the former! Also, I remember seeing a man eating scrambled eggs at Uncle Miltie's and he had ketchup on them. I said \"Ew! How can you eat your eggs with ketchup on them?\" He said in reply \"Have you ever tried it?\" I said \"no\" and he said \"Then don't criticize it until you've tried it!\" Well, the next time I had scrambled eggs, I tried it and to this day, I prefer my scramble eggs to have ketchup on them! We got the milk delivered by Sealtest in their boxy milk truck; We played football on the small piece of grass at the Bordens Dairy on Seaview Ave. Another great place for football when Newfield Park was too crowded was the in front of the sewage treatment plant on Seaview Ave. This was a couple of doors down from Dana Stanziales house. Was it the #13 Bus to Pleasure Beach that took us downtown? We would hop that and do our shopping at the A & P on Fairfield Ave. I took Guitar lessons from Guy Smith right upstairs from the market. I know it was the #9 that took us from East Main to Harding, I used to catch it at Berkshire once I moved away from Seaview Ave, but only in the winter. If the weather was tolerable, meaning above 30, I would walk Noble Avenue to Arctic Street then up to Ernies Confectionary before the final hill. Does anyone remember what I think was called the \"Date Line\", a phone number ED4-1000? Do you recall what you heard when you called that number? (Answer: When you dialed the dateline number, you got a \"busy signal\" and in between the busy signal beeps, you could hear people talking, mainly asking \"whats your number?\" and if you got a number or gave yours out, one could usually dial it and talk with the person giving it out or you could count on getting called. The poor mans chat room of the era.) Do you remember these places from the East End portion of Stratford Avenue: Gene's Market, Jacobian Cleaners, Shine's Five and Dime, Amy's Fish Market, and the Hippadrome Theater? - What a great time we had on that stretch of the Avenue. We would buy candy at Leroy's Smoke Shop then cross the Avenue and take in the Saturday afternoon matinee. Does anyone remember Sunbeam Bread days at Pleasure Beach, where on Tuesdays you rode for free if you had a sticker from the end of a loaf of Sunbeam Bread?; Remember Mickey's Market on Jane Street and buying penny candy during recess. Also Briarwoods.... Question: What did the sign over the take-out window say? Answer: Be quiet, Behave, or Be-gone. I was shocked when I recently drove down Main Street during a visit to Bridgeport. It's all gone! It is just astounding how that happens. To have all those vivid memories of the crowded streets, HL Greene's, Leavitts, Read's, Kresge, the theaters - Poli and Majestic - all gone! My family moved into what was then Yellow Mill Village in 1940, as one of the first tenants. YMV was pristine, with lawns, benches, trellises, 2 playgrounds with \"showers for summer\", swings, see-saws, and there were enough to accommodate great games of \"pink ball baseball.\" Our own drug store (Scinto's), Grocery (Jarusinski's), a notions store (Mellitz) and a bakery. Pembroke street was the neighborhood and you could get your clothes \"sponge and pressed\" at our cleaners. Kott's was THEE delicatessen, and we support ed three bakeries on Pembroke Street (3 Italian, & 1 Jewish), and 2 other drug stores besides Scinto's (Riccio's, and one other) plus 2 Italian markets, one was Lisi's, and we even had a fresh chicken market which provided live chickens that you selected and they prepared them for you before your very eyes. So, I ask if anyone has any photo's of that era (1940 - 1952) from family albums, it would be so incredibly great if they would submit them for posting on this website; The Stone Bridge out to the island in Beardsley Park: View; The cotton candy truck - you could hear the \"hummmm\" of the truck; The fruit and veggie man driving street to street, house to house, and building to building; Fishing in the Yellow Mill River (yikes!); Bottled milk - with cream on the top; Penny candy was a penny; Father Panik Village's Sand Cellars; Being home by the time the street lights came on; Family Picnics; Sled riding at Bullard Havens; The Organ Grinder and his Monkey who traveled Stratford Ave - Anyone remember his name? Remember calling Success Village \"Sussex Park\", Remember the \"vegetable man\" with his pickup truck that had the scale hanging on the back; Remember the \"rag man\" with his horse drawn buggy collecting rags; Remember the insurance man coming to your apartment every week to collect the 65 cent premium for your dad's life insurance; Remember the Mechanics and Farmers Savings Bank envelopes that you brought to school with a quarter in it every few weeks; Remember Valley Farms \"ahbeets\" slices for a quarter; Remember the parking lot at the end of Court A in Success Park was \"the woods\", not a parking lot; Betty Ann's on Success Ave, Vincent's Market with the boxing ring in the back, also on Success Ave; Remember when the Barnum theater was 25 cents and the Highway show was 35 cents - you flattened out your popcorn box and \"scaled\" it at the movie screen. The Remington self-propelled car that took explosives and personnel from the plant (near the shot tower) up to the Remington Woods on Success Hill -- the tracks ran under Boston Ave. and along side the GE plant next to the spray ponds: View ; Frank's Ahbeets on Pembroke Street next to Fazio's Bakery & Lisi's Importing. \"Larry's Variety\" on the corner of Pembroke and Jane (also known as Lafoye's Variety - it was owned by the father of member Dan Luparello from about 1940 to 1953) the store was kitty corner from Saint John Nepomucene School and was a popular kid's hangout for that part of the East-End. How great was Newfield Park in the East End -- a haven for all who lived around it -- except when the Park was enveloped in the pink cloud of whatever was released when the Stanley Works knocked down their furnaces, or smelting towers, or whatever. Whatever the crud was, it left a catch in the throat and was probably toxic as all hell. From the \"Did you know this?\" files.... back in the early 1970's Harding High's Principal was named Richard Mayer (he later went on to Harding's arch-rival, Central High) -- his son is recording artist/musician rock star John Mayer (View their photo); How did you order that pizza?... Everyone say \"ahbeets with scamotes\" -- here's a link to a Roadfood website blog discussion about just what is \"scamotes\" along with lots of references to Bridgeport area pizza places from our era: Click on: Roadfood.com; St. John Nepomucene Class of 1956's teachers (from 1949-1956): First Grade: Sr. Mary Armelda; Second Grade: Sr. Mary Grace; Third Grade: Sr. Mary Rosemarie; Fourth Grade: Sr. Mary Borgia; Fifth Grade: Sr. Mary Esperance; Sixth Grade: Sr. Mary Felica; Seventh Grade: Sr. Mary Lawrence; Eighth Grade: Sr. Mary Emmerich. Remember going to tell Santa Claus what you wanted? Santa was in the basement of Howland's Department Store. I can vaguely remember the line wrapped around waiting for our term on his lap. One other memory is going to St. Augustine's Church before it was a cathedral. But there were so many people attending Christmas Mass that they had to put a loud speaker outside because people stood outside to attend Mass! Purchasing Marvel Comics for a dime at Charlie Pressmen's Drug Store on the corner of Barnum and Central Avenues. Going to the American Theater and the Mayfair Theater on East Main St, or the Barnum Theatre on Barnum Ave. The Barnum & State and CR&L buses struggling in the snow and ice while going up the Barnum Ave hill between Seaview and Central Avenues. Running home after school to watch Zorro at 3:30pm. The 20 cartoon matinees at the Barnum Theater. Remember when Pleasure Beach was a pleasure and we'd ride the CR&L bus for three tokens for a quarter to get there. Wednesdays was 10cents a ride day. Uncle Milties on Boston Ave, and not to forget the Greeks hot dogs. Remember all the late forties and early fifties Fords and Mercs lowered, chopped, the flat head V-8s supped up with steel packs blasting away. What ever happened to Herbie Sutton, Stacy Kormetis, Dennis Vestunis, who together with Buttons Parker, Vinny Lombardo, and others whooped Central that Thanksgiving Day a million years ago. Girl Scout Camp Trefoil located in Stepney. The US Navy ships that visited Bridgeport Harbor and tied up at the Buckley Brothers fuel dock for 4th of July walk-aboard tours.

Click on: Loew's Poli and Majestic Theaters\n\n\"A Brief history of the East End section of Bridgeport\"\n\nSome HISTORY of the some areas of the East End of Bridgeport....\n\nThe East End: The portion of the city east of Old Mill Creek and Yellow Mill Pond that was part of the Town of Stratford until 1889 (it was the Borough of West Stratford from 1886-89). It was comprised of three villages -- (1) Lake Village (aka Gretna Green) along Seaview Avenue from Barnum Avenue to Ogden St. Ext.; (2) Deacon's Point, the Seaview Avenue area of Williston Street, Holly Street, and Deacon Street; and, (3) Newfield Grove, comprised of the 'Presidential' streets (Jefferson, Adams, along with DeKalb) to the south of Newfield Park.\n\nThe area known as Newfield: The 'new field' was a tract of farming land officially laid out by the town fathers of Stratford in 1717. The present Stratford and Newfield Avenues were laid out for access, and it was divided into three-to-five acre parcels (every upstanding white male citizen of the town owned and frequently traded several of these). Newfield Harbor (18th-century name of Bridgeport Harbor) took its name from this undertaking. The area currently known as 'Newfield' was laid out by New York developers in 1869.\n\n\"Remember when Bridgeport was a city of factories and factory workers?\"\n\nBridgeport was once a bustling industrial city, and there are few from our \"era\" who didn't have a parent or relative working in one of the many Bridgeport factories.

Click on: Video\n\n\"Bridgeport Sightings in the Movies\"\n\n(From Don Browne) In the 1972 movie, \"The Effect of Gamma Rays On Man-In-The-Moon Marigolds\", directed by Paul Newman, which was filmed entirely in Bridgeport; (1) the \"high school scenes\" were shot inside and outside Warren Harding. Inside scenes in the \"Art's classroom\" on the second floor facing Hedges Stadium, and in hallways which had lockers. Outside scenes in a parked car at the corner of Central Avenue and Ogden Street Extention, where the \"mother\" (Joanne Woodward) was waiting for her two daughters, the \"popular\" child (Roberta Wallach) and the \"gifted\" child (Nell Potts) to get out of high school. Harding was on \"single sessions\" at this time. Students flood out of new entrances facing Central Avenue where the old \"boy's gym\" entrance had stood. Then the car travels down various \"disconnected\", but photogenic, streets until; (2) the \"grocery store scenes\". The grocery store was \"Milano's Superette\", located on the east side at 604 East Main, at the \"T\" intersection of Burroughs Street. The film camera faces south as the car stops directly in front of \"Milano's\". The film camera covers the western side of East Main, between Burroughs Street and Seymour Street. The historic \"Freedman Brothers Furniture Store\" is visible to its conclusion at Seymour Street. Judging from the lack of traffic and parked cars in front of Freedman's, this scene was filmed on a Sunday. I knew this neighborhood well as I lived at 65 Seymour Street until I was 16 years old. Then the car and its occupants travel to; (3) their home, which is inexplicably located in Bassick High School's jurisdiction. The \"house scenes\" are filmed in a single story home with a large backyard, on Russell Street, across from the harbor. Strangely, this was the street where my Seymour Street friends, four brothers, the Shumosky family, had moved from 90 Seymour Street in 1961. The \"high school scenes\" were filmed in September 1971. The film was pre-released to test audiences on December 27, 1971. The film was not commercially successful, although nominated for several Golden Globe Awards. (Note: We recently received an email from Mike Freddino, the owner of the \"Buy-Rite Market\" which was located at 604-612 East Main St from December 1967 until June 1995. He indicated the grocery scene mentioned above was shot at his Buy-Rite Market and he appeared as the cashier in the market scene, which was shot on a Monday.

We all know what Bridgeport ,Connecticut meant to Mitchum, so it's one of those things that makes you think - did he or didn't he help choose the name of the Californian town for the movie? (Note, there is an actual Bridgeport, CA, east of San Francisco near the Nevada border.)\n\nThe 1937 film \"There Goes My Girl,\" a screwball comedy in which Jerry (Gene Raymond) and Connie (Ann Southern) are ace reporters for rival newspapers.

Included among them are (1) The Congress Candy Store and The Loew's Poli at Main and Congress Streets, (2) Dolan's Corner and the Waldorf Cafeteria at Golden Hill and Middle Streets, (3) The Globe Theatre on Main Street, (4) The White Tower Restaurant at Main and Congress Streets, (5) The corner of Main Street and Fairfield Avenue, (6) Thursday Night Downtown at the corner of Main and Fairfield, (7) Lane's Diner on Broad Street next to the old UI building. To view them, click on: View\n\nLouis, who lived on Smith Street directly behind Newfield School, attended Newfield and Lincoln schools, and Blessed Sacrament Church. He would like to expand this series of paintings to cover some of the old neighborhoods in other parts of the city - like the East End and the East Side. Ultimately, he wants to produce a group of paintings that the city would retain as a visual addition to the historical record of Bridgeport's past, and which would always be available for public viewing. Unfortunately, Louis says his memory is not sharp enough to produce an accurate representation without the help of photographic reference material (I think we all can empathize with that!)

THERE IS SO MUCH MORE LETS HEAR FROM SOME HOLLOW KIDS!!! And from Black Rock comes the following: You watched the 4th of July fireworks from St. Mary's-by-the-Sea; You watched the Black Rock Day Parade, then walked to Ellsworth Field for the festivities; You attended Brownies' meetings at Bartram Hall on Brewster Street; You remember the concrete playgrounds and basement bathrooms of Black Rock School; Your parents didn't mind if you played by Ash Creek; You went to the movies at the Beverly Theater for 99 cents, and it had the biggest screen around; You remember when Pantry Pride burned to the ground; If your school didn't have a shop or home ec classroom, you walked to another school for that class (unescorted). I attended Elias Howe School, old even when I went to it (1939-48), Maplewood JHS for 9th grade, and then off to Bassick. Growing up during WWII was an exciting time with the factories going 24 hours a day, anti-aircraft batteries on their roofs, guards around their perimeters, and Corsairs flying over town from Chance Vought in Stratford. We would go every Saturday to the Matinee at the West End Theater to see the serial, previews, cartoon, newsreel, and two movies - usually one a western. Bassick had such a small field, that we had to walk over to Went Field near Wordin Avenue for baseball. As I got older I would go with my friend, Billy, downtown to see a movie at the Poli, Majestic or Globe. We would take the Barnum & State to town and return on the CR&L. When the weather was nice, Bill and I would walk home, past Zemel's, the beautiful traffic circle at Park and Fairfield Avenues, past the Klein Memorial with the Cadillac dealer across the way, by Bassick HS, past Women's Drug Store on Fairfield and Clinton, and back home. We would play stickball and touch football at the library park where State Street meets Fairfield Avenue. I never had a male teacher in my nine years at Elias Howe (K-8). They were all up in age and mostly unmarried ladies, but fantastic teachers and greatly respected by me. I worked part time on Saturdays at Miles Shoe store the corner of Fairfield and Main, and eventually had an internship at Bridgeport City Trust on Main Street. I even worked one summer at Manning, Maxwell & Moore in Stratford, before going off to law school and then the Air Force. I remember my mom loved the beach and we would go to Seaside Park in the summer and change in the beach house and get some Cracker Jacks before going through the tunnel to the beach. We would travel there on the Gray Line. I remember they had bars on their windows. I also worked in the Howard Johnson's in Milford on the Boston Post Road and in the Old Fashioned Ice Cream Parlor in Westport for Bob Beach. Waited on several celebrities including Martha Raye and Enzio Pinza from South Pacific. We wore handlebar moustaches and had a feature article in the NY Sunday Mirror. For several years we had a summer cottage in Woodmont (Milford) and often went to Savin Rock for the amusement park and Jimmy's hot dogs. There were summer pop concerts at both the Yale Bowl and in Fairfield. Cannot forget the Ritz Ballroom in Black Rock on Fairfield Avenue with all the famous bands playing there. Kids today do not know what they are missing. I remember after dates on Saturday night, a lot of the fellows would gather at the Fairfield Dinner to shoot-the -breeze. I could go on and on, but I was so thrilled in reading your website, that I wanted to share some of my thoughts with you (Roger Shatanof, Coral Gables, Florida). 5 cent Saturday matinees for the younger set at the Bostwick Theatre in Hunktown, followed by adult movies on Sunday where your admission ticket got your Mom a plate or cup for free. My Mom collected a whole service for 8, and I can still see the hand-painted flower that adorned each piece. The West End Movie Theatre on State Street where many couples shared first hugs & kisses. The Mosque Roller Rink on Sunday Afternoons --- fun for all ages. For you North Enders who haven't been back to Bridgeport in a while, here's a link to the home page of the iconic Merritt Canteen Those hot dogs have gotten a little expensive! Santa coming in by Chopper to the Lafayette \"Mall\". Emmy's Pizza in the mall. Nick's Grocery in the Rock. The Beverly Theater across the \"Ave.\" Corner stores on Ellsworth St, Canfield Ave, The Coal deposits of Ash Creek, Bullard's Foundry, and how the marshes thrived and we swam in as kids, and none left today, but mud flats. All the Factories that once were in the Rock. The great times at the true \"Field\" and Black Rock Day's and BRLL. Greenwald's Mens Store; The Liberty Theater was between Howard Avenue and Colorado Avenue on State Street. The Liberty Theater had 9 cent matinees for kids on Saturdays. I also remember helping the owner's son exterminate rats in the theater after closing. The rats would come out to feast on popcorn and candy that was dropped on the floor during the movies. We dispatched many of them with our air rifles. It wasn't uncommon for one of those furry rats to run across your feet while you were watching a movie! The Flying Saucer; Banvilles; Weitenstien's Newsroom; the West End Bowling Alleys;\n\nAnd..... For All You South End \"kids\", too.....
