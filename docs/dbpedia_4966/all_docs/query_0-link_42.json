It has been operating as a listener-supported, community-based radio station since 1989. There are only three paid staffers…the General Manager and the Operations Manager are full-time, and the Office Manager is part-time. All of the Programmers are volunteers.\n\nThe film by Cob Carlson, will be carried by this cast of characters, as well as the listeners, station volunteers, and DJs from the past. We will hear interviewees share their personal, idiosyncratic stories, speaking passionately about their love of music, news, politics, health, cars, organic gardening, space exploration, and culture.\n\nLike the radio station, this film will be fearless, boldly independent, free form, and unconventional. WPKN prides itself on being a real alternative to an increasingly homogeneous broadcast radio landscape. It enriches the lives of their listeners while promoting diversity, tolerance, and freedom of expression. It is a story worth documenting!\n\n10:00pm-1:00am\n\n​VIP After Party* [at Wali Kafe]\n\nFeaturing DJ Eric Otero spinning live!\n\n​*Must have a VIP Pass or purchase an additional ticket to this event. ​"
