Hi,

I've been on a couple of courses, most notably the advanced workflow developer course. IMHO you either need a course for this or you need someone else who knows about them to coach you. I haven't tried the online courses so can't comment on those.

(*Slight dig at Interwoven coming*) You will also find that if you don't go oon a course that the documentation is not a good as it could be.

Just my opinion.

I took the Advanced Workflow Development course in February of this year. It was a two day course, and I understand there was the option to take less advanced workflow and Perl courses in the preceding days.

The Advanced course packed a lot of stuff in to the time - but it was definitely the more technical people in my class who got the most out of it. It alternated between going through a chapter in a workbook with the instructor, then doing the exercises at the end. It's a good foundation for developing your own workflows, and you can pick up some useful tips and tricks. I thought the course was well structured and explanatory.

Also, the Sunnyvale location is very nice, I got a free pen, and the cafeteria there is very impressive
