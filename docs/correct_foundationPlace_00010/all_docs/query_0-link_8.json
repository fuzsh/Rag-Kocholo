As an operating foundation, we focus our efforts on creating long-lasting change and supporting community members disproportionately affected by health disparities. Our approach is both multi-pronged and interwoven through our roles as a Funder, Advocate, and Catalyst. Together with supporters and partners, we work to fulfill our vision of a Silicon Valley where everyone has a fair chance at leading a healthy life and a person’s immigration status, income, race, and zip code are not barriers to health."
