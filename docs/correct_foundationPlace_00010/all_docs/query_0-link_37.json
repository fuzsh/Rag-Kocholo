        "text": "The Hillbrook Middle School experience is all about balance: challenging and rigorous academics interwoven with extracurricular learning and opportunities for student-led exploration. Encouraged by an active learning environment, students dive deeper into their interests and passions in their elective periods and lunch clubs, and an interdisciplinary curriculum builds bridges between subjects, classes, and ways of thinking: science and social studies, English and math, history and electives.\n\nThe Middle School experience doesn't stop with the school day - teachers hold after-school office hours four days per week to provide extra help; students are welcome to sign up for after-school Athletics starting in 5th grade, and the Hub is open for projects and exploration. Our Performing and Visual Arts program invites students to discover their artistic talents.\n\nAt Hillbrook, students and faculty are a team, working together to co-create an educational experience that encourages our entire community to be the best that they can be. Academic rigor extends beyond the classroom - the challenges of social impact play a key role in students' intellectual and emotional development.\n\nAcross our Middle School, the SEL Competencies we teach remain the same, though their complexity and nuance progress with children’s age and stage. The Hillbrook Social-Emotional Core Competencies are:\n\nPerspective-Taking\n\nSelf-Awareness\n\nSelf-Regulation\n\nSocial Awareness\n\nConflict Management\n\nEffective Communication with peers and adults\n\nStress Management\n\nResponsible Decision-Making\n\nRelationship Building\n\nRespect for Self & Others\n\nLunch Clubs allow our students to dig deeper into areas of passion while cultivating community and connections across grade levels. Lunch Clubs are offered in both the Fall and Spring semesters and are constantly changing based on student interests and suggestions.\n\nLunch Clubs have included:\n\nSocial Justice Club\n\nRobotics\n\nRock Band\n\nSports Club\n\nH.E.R.O. (Helping Everyone Reaching Out)\n\nShow Choir\n\nDungeons & Dragons Club\n\nSoCaH (Students of Color at Hillbrook)\n\nHub Club\n\nEnrichment Classes take place after school, and offer a great opportunity for students to expand their learning and explore their interests. Enrichment classes have included chess, fencing, filmmaking, AI Adventures, and our homework center.\n\nIf you can dream it, you can make it in the Hub! The Hub is where engineering and the arts come together, allowing creativity and curiosity to flourish. Intertwined with middle school integrated studies, the Hub invites students - through electives and in their own free time - to design, imagine, and create incredible projects and works of art, with access to tools and experts they need solve any problem and imagine any future.\n\nWith woodcutters, a laser printer, sewing machines, silkscreens, a drill press, hot glue, pottery wheels, and an endless collection of craft supplies (paint, fabric, scrap wood, string), the Hub is the ultimate makerspace, with everything students need to make their ideas come to life.\n\nA journey like no other: building upon Reach Beyond Block studies and mindsets, our annual Reach Beyond Week provides middle school students a tangible experience of hands-on, real-world learning with potential to impact people or the planet. By dedicating a full week to Reach Beyond experiences, students achieve an ever-greater understanding of how we each make a difference in the world. Experiences range from local to international, offering a variety of ways to engage in the communities, experiences, environments, cultures, events, and complex issues that extend beyond our campus.\n\nPrevious Reach Beyond Week Experiences Have Included:\n\nThe Circus is Back in Town - Cirque San José\n\nYosemite Adventure\n\nService, Culture & Peer Exchange in the Southwest: A Journey to Cochiti Pueblo\n\nUrbanization, Culture & Justice in the Rust Belt (Chicago and Detroit)\n\nSocial Impact in the Sacred Valley (Peru)\n\nFood, Farms, and Fashion (Southern California)\n\nLeadership in the Field: A Journey to Teton Science Schools (Wyoming)\n\nBicycling Adventure & Advocacy"
