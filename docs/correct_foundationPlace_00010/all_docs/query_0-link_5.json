        "text": "Position Paper\n\nContent Management for Web Services\n\nInterwoven, a leading content management provider, boasts an infrastructure that allows users to integrate applications that provide active content into their eBusiness environment. We are seeing a noticeable shift from applications to Web services as they are being increasingly used to provide active content from across the Internet. Our infrastructure has proven to be important in this process because it is used to engineer production quality services through a rigorous development, test, and deployment cycle.\n\nInterwoven endorses the standardization of Web services and supports further activities that lead to interoperability. We believe that the services must be engineered to be used accountably in businesses settings. Engineering is essential if the routine use of Web services is to gain widespread adoption by the business community. We have highlighted some key areas below that we feel are important to engineering Web services and should be studied by the working group. We will encourage the group to define a reasonable scope for any such Web service initiative so that baseline implementations can be worked on in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nEngineering Environment\n\nWhat does the engineering environment look like for development, test, and deployment of Web services? Will debug tools be incorporated into this environment? Are there certification procedures in place?\n\nInterwoven is committed to bringing Web services to the production environment. We will work with the Web services effort to provide a reasonably scoped problem and then define baseline requirements to deploy realistic services for business applications.\n\nDescription and Discovery of Web Services\n\nHow are Web services described? How and where will Web services be registered? What discovery mechanisms are there for locating services in a production environment? Are there varying QOS levels for the Web services that can be expected? How can the data formats (DTDs, Schemas, etc.) used to communicate with Web services be catalogued to facilitate integration (there are literally hundreds of DTDs from domains alone)? Does the registration authority maintain the catalogue?\n\nInterwoven works directly with application, commerce, and personalization servers in content management. Their services are integrated through the use of well-defined APIs. We work to standardize the way in which active content is presented in the development cycle. This work also includes the addition of meta-data, necessary for the construction of the semantic Web, in which services are described in a way that promotes accuracy of their use. We also have techniques for discovery at the content, classification, and meta-data levels.\n\nAggregation\n\nCan Web services from different sources be aggregated into new services? Is there a manageable workflow model that can be used to govern this? How can these new services be developed and tested for deployment in real business settings? How is session security maintained across multiple service providers? How are aggregates of services certified?"
