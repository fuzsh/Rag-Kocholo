        "text": "Kerrie Leever\n\nKerri grew up in the Midwest and received a Double B.S. from Indiana University. She moved to Southern California in the late 90’s where she worked as a sales manager. After taking some time off to raise her 2 children, Kerri started working part time in a wine shop. Discovering a love of wine, she pursued many classes to earn certifications in Californian, Italian, and French wine as well as earning her entry Sommelier Certificate. Today, Kerri is the General Manager and Wine Buyer for the Half Moon Bay Wine and Cheese Co., where she enjoys teaching customers more about wine and helping them find the perfect bottle for any occasion.\n\nStephanie Mitchell\n\nStephanie is a native Californian who followed in her mother’s footsteps into the hospitality industry, starting as a restaurant hostess at the age of 19. At 23 she was offered the position of wine director which she held for 4 years. After finishing her degree in Anthropology at Sonoma State University she decided that a career in the wine industry encapsulated all her interests. COVID has changed so many lives including hers. Becoming a new mother during the crisis and developing a disability have caused her to take a step back from her career as a portfolio specialist from a prominent importer. She has used this time to obtain the WSET level 3 award in wines and is currently pursuing her Diploma. She is also focused on obtaining the Guild of Sommeliers Spanish Wine Specialist certification. Her goal is to become a Master of Wine and to help shape the future of wine education in the United States.\n\nChristian Medina\n\nCristian graduated from the University Cristobal Colon in 2004 with a degree in hospitality. He decided to move his family from their hometown of Veracruz, Mexico to the United States in 2015, because he wanted to apply his schooling to the restaurant industry. He immediately began working at Donato Enoteca, a restaurant known for regional Italian dishes as well as highly-rated Italian wines. He pursued the CMS Introductory level in 2017, and he is now pursuing his CMS Certification. His goal is to found and own a restaurant group that specializes in traditional coastal Mexican cuisine, pairing with fine wines from all over the world. Cristian believes that hospitality is more than good food and wine. Hospitality is about caring for the people he serves and works with.\n\nLouise Olivares\n\nLouise Olivares has over 15 years as a sales and marketing professional in the high-tech world. In 2012, she decided to pivot and explore a wine career and her first job in the industry was in wine sales working for wine brokers in the San Francisco Bay Area. She is a Certified Sommelier and was recently hired as a sommelier for Solage, an Auberge Resorts property in Calistoga. During the Covid lockdown in 2021 she completed the French Wine Scholar, Spanish Wine Scholar, and California Wine Appellation Specialist program through San Francisco Wine School. In 2022, Louise looks forward to working on the CSW and the Italian Wine Scholar programs.\n\nMartin Ladera\n\nBorn in San Martin, Peru, Martin moved to Japan when he was 11. This move marked the beginnings of his exploration and later passion for cultural and national cuisines. When he moved to California in 2000, he began part time work at many restaurants while attending college to learn English. His fascination and interest in wine developed over the course of many day trips to Napa Valley, Lodi, and Sonoma. In 2012, Martin joined MarketBar in the San Francisco Ferry Building as a server and later became lead trainer. He became manager of MarketBar in 2017, and was promoted to assistant general manager and beverage purchasing manager which included becoming the wine director in 2018. Martin hopes to obtain his Sommelier Certification one day, and dreams of highlighting the wonderful world of wine from his native Peru.\n\nLynn Dowdell\n\nLynn Dowdell is a wine curator and consultant with Vin Collective LLC.

He spent his childhood working with his father tending to the family ranch and garden where they cultivated most of the food they ate. Anthony spent his mid 20’s and 30’s pursuing his passion for music; a lifestyle that bartending allowed. It wasn’t until a few years after arriving in California that he realized how much that time spent with his father seeded his passion for food and wine. In 2011 Anthony started volunteering with 18Reasons and Good Food Foundation. That same year Anthony met Foreign Cinema’s Sommelier, Zach Pace, while attending a Summer Sommelier Intensive. During the pandemic, Anthony started researching wine schools and David Glancy’s story really resonated with him.\n\nJamie Knee\n\nJamie is a Wine Consultant for several Santa Barbara wineries.
