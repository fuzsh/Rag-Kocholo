        "text": "Background\n\nThe Eastridge to BART Regional Connector Project (EBRC) extends light rail from the existing Alum Rock Light Rail Station to the Eastridge Transit Center with an elevated guideway primarily in the center of the Capitol Expressway. The Eastridge extension will include an elevated light rail station at Story Road and an at-grade station located at the Eastridge Transit Center. When this project is complete, VTA riders can board the light rail at the Eastridge Station and connect directly with BART at the Milpitas Station.\n\nThis project (formerly Capitol Expressway Light Rail Project) has been delivered in phases. The first phase was delivered in two parts. In Phase 1A, VTA addressed pedestrian access and improved safety measures along the expressway between Quimby Road and Capitol Avenue. This was completed in Fall 2012 and included new sidewalks, street lighting, and a landscaping buffer. Phase 1B was the reconstruction of the Eastridge Transit Center. The improvements to the transit center included new shelters and amenities and support BRT. This was completed in 2015.\n\nThe light rail extension is Phase 2, and the final phase of the larger Capitol Expressway Transit Improvement Project that transforms the Capitol Expressway into a multi-modal expressway offering bus rapid transit (BRT), light rail transit, and safe connections to the regional transit system.\n\nProject Status\n\nConstruction has started and is anticipated to be completed in 2028. Construction activities will increase traffic and drive time from permanent and temporary lane closures on Capitol Expressway. Construction activities are noisy. There will be large equipment that causes vibrations that will be felt by people who live or work along the corridor.\n\nWeekly Updates\n\n071924 Community Outreach Trailer Has Arrived\n\nTo All,\n\nConstruction activities are taking place at multiple locations along the 2.4-mile Eastridge to BART Regional Connector. We are preparing for months of continuous pile driving beginning in August 2024.\n\nThe City of San Jose resurfacing project will have intermittent traffic control in the coming weeks on Story Road, Ocala Avenue, and Capitol Expressway. City DOT Outreach recently posted about the maintenance work and will be distributing flyers to residents whose streets are on the list for corrective maintenance. https://www.sanjoseca.gov/Home/Components/News/News/6035/5104)\n\nAnticipated work from 07/19 to 08/01\n\nNight Work - Drainage work is scheduled on Capitol Avenue, in the northern part of the project.\n\nDay Work - Tree removal in the northern part of the project.\n\nDay Work - Remove portions of the median and islands on Capitol Avenue, in the northern part of the project.\n\nDay Work Remove pavement areas on Capitol Expressway between Ocala Ave and Tully Road, northbound and southbound.\n\nTemporary ramps for pedestrians and bikes at various locations.\n\nGood News\n\nOn Capitol Expressway and Cunningham Avenue, two pedestrians push buttons damaged by a car have been repaired.\n\nOn Capitol Expressway and Quimby Road, a loose pedestrian push button has been repaired by the Project.\n\nCommunity Outreach\n\nThe Community Outreach trailer arrived at 1093 S. Capitol on Monday, July 15, 2024. Residents neighboring the property received advanced notice on July 12, regarding early morning activities.\n\nThere is work to do to make the trailer office functional. We anticipate moving in mid-August and be open to the public soon after. Please join us for a neighborly gathering on 9/21/2024, at 11:00am-1:00pm. We’ll be sending you photos soon!\n\nLooking ahead, VTA Outreach is participating with Mayfair/Plata Arroyo, Mt. Pleasant, and Foxdale neighborhood associations on National Night Out, August 6. Later this summer we plan to participate in Viva Parks events at Sylvia Cassel Park 8/29, and Mayfair Park on 9/26. A new set of community meetings to provide construction updates will occur in October (Exact dates and locations TBD).\n\nMoving Forward,\n\nThe EBRC Construction & Engagement Team\n\n062424 Test Pile Driving and Sidewalk Removal\n\nEastridge to Bart Regional Connector\n\nWeekly Construction Update\n\nJune 24, 2024\n\n​​​​​​Last week, construction crews for the EBRC project conducted preparations for test pile driving in the median at Capitol Expressway, near Ocala Avenue. This is in the south part of the project. Sound barriers have been installed on both sides of the road. Test pile driving and other activities will continue this week. We continue monitoring and mitigating the potential effects of noise, vibration and dust.\n\nOther teams are working at the north side of the project, demolishing areas east of S. Capitol Ave between Story Rd. and Excalibur Dr. to ultimately widen Capitol Expressway as per the project’s scope of work.\n\nAnticipated work for the week of 06/24/24\n\nTEST pile driving during the day and mobilization of a second crane during the night.\n\nUtility potholing and drainage work.\n\nRemove existing fiber optics systems and street lighting.\n\nRemove concrete sidewalks and curbs during the day and continue to install sound barriers on the northbound Expressway toward Sussex Ave at night.\n\nPlace temporary ramps for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nOther construction activities.\n\nUpcoming Community Meetings\n\nA community meeting for the Foxdale Neighborhood Association took place on Tuesday, June 18th, in English and Spanish. VTA’s resident engineer and community relations officer provided an update on construction activities.\n\nA house meeting requested by homeowners on Dover Way, in the northeastern side of the project is scheduled for Saturday, June 29th. Dover Way is in the northeastern part of the project. Homeowners indicated to be concerned about vibration.

Even though we at VTA have had to adjust to to the way we work, the planning work on Eastridge to BART Regional Connector Project continued. Let's catch up!\n\nStation Art Enhancement\n\nDid You Miss the Station Art Concept Meetings - August 31, AND September 13?\n\nVTA has provided opportunities for community review of proposed light rail station art concepts. The designs the artists presented were inspired and influenced by community input shared in January’s Meet the Artists meetings and coupled with the artists’ research.\n\nEastridge Station\n\nOur first meeting, held on August 31 revealed the design for Eastridge Station. Artists Laura Haddad and Tom Drugan presented Radiance, an abstract sculpture inspired by East San Jose’s community celebrations, agricultural history, natural environment, and quality of light.\n\nRadiance is a metaphoric graft of aspects of the Eastridge Station’s surrounding community and nature in which its diverse cultures and landscapes come together to form a radiant whole. The sculpture forms a portal to be walked through. It is intended to be located so it will greet residents and visitors from many vantage points at the nexus of the future light rail station, bus terminals, Park & Ride, and pedestrian trails.\n\nThe sculpture changes in appearance as people move around and through it. When viewed from the front, its lower arbor pipes form a subtle heart shape. Viewed diagonally, they form a moon-like ellipse. Viewed from the side, the vertical arbor pipes with the matrix on top suggest a grove of trees. Standing beneath the sculpture will be like looking up into a tree canopy of fruit and flowers. Walking through the sculpture is intended to be a small moment of magic.\n\nStory Road Station\n\nBuilding on the momentum and spirit of weaving in community engagement and historical research, artist Amir Fallah presented his design concept for Story Road Station, Interwoven on September 13.\n\nInterwoven was inspired by San José’s diverse patchwork of people, cultures, and landscapes. The concept transforms the three elevator towers, and pedestrian overcrossing, into a feature gateway over Capitol Expressway. Collaborating with the architects, the original metal panels design has been reimagined in a custom blueberry color palette, designed to visually connect the three towers. Standing proud of the tower cladding are sixteen glass light boxes of various sizes. The light boxes are strategically placed to be seen from every vantage point, including the roadway, sidewalks, stairs, lightrail platform, and from the train itself. The vibrant and colorful images, lit from within, will have an identity both day and night.\n\nInterwoven features a complex array of images that portray the intersection of landscapes and cultures that is San José. The lightbox element of the artwork includes pictures and patterning from the cultures making up the tapestry of San José, including indigenous, Mexican, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian, and Persian. Throughout the artwork geometric designs refer to the larger theme of interconnectivity and community. A redwood tree refers to the nearby forests, a hand holding a mirror reflects a Mexican desert landscape, a detailed geometric motif commonly seen in East Asian artwork is placed alongside a traditional Mexican textile pattern. Driving south on Capitol Expressway a dreamed panoramic image, split in two, continues from the east elevator tower to the western tower.\n\nContributing an additional dimension to the work, Mr. Fallah will be commissioning four San José poets, several from east San José, to contribute lines of poetry that will be a central component of the artwork. They will be prompted to respond to themes of travel, journey, voyage, and wandering. From the submissions, Mr. Fallah will select text as part of the artwork.\n\nEach of the recorded meetings and copy of the presentation are linked below for your review.\n\nYou have one more opportunity to see the artists presentations\n\nThe City of San Jose Public Art Committee will receive similar presentations from the artists when they meet on October 3, 2023 at 5:30pm. Both stations will be reviewed. The San Jose Art Commission meetings are open to the public. Refer directly to the Public Art Committee website for meeting agenda and other information.\n\nDownload the Station Art Concept presentations:\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 8-31-23 – English\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 8-31-23 – Spanish\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 9-13-23-English\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 9-13-23-Spanish\n\nOr watch the recorded meetings located on SCVTA YouTube:\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 8-31-23-English\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 8-31-23-Spanish\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 9-13-23-English\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 9-13-23-Spanish\n\nPreviously\n\nMeet the Artists!\n\nWe have been very excited to introduce the community to the artists selected to enhance the new light rail stations planned for Story Road and Eastridge. Through a rigorous process of artist outreach and selection, Amir Fallah, and the team of Laura Haddad and Tom Drugan, have been commissioned. These artists are all experienced public artists. Their work extends beyond their studios and responds to site and community. They also have track records for sizable, successfully maintainable, permanent public artworks.\n\nThe Station Art Enhancement Community Meetings held on January 9 and January 11 (facilitated in Spanish) were the “kick-off” for the artists’ design process, in advance of them doing any design work. The purpose of the meetings were for the community to become acquainted with the artists, and to get a sense of their visual vocabulary and their approach to public art. Each artists presented examples of previous public art installations, and their approach to the designs and mediums used. These meetings were also meant to provide foundational inspiration for the artists’ work, here, in San Jose.\n\nThrough an on-line activity, participants responded to four questions:\n\n1. Which neighborhood are you connected to? What is important for us to know about it?\n\n2. Think about a place that is special to you in San Jose. Describe the spot and why you chose it?\n\n3. Please provide three words describing what is important to you personally, or which symbolize your community?\n\n4. What is one of your favorite public artworks in San Jose (or anywhere)? Why?\n\nThe meetings provided an opportunity for the artists to learn about the community. It was not surprising that participants represented a wide variety of East San Jose neighborhoods! When asked about a place that is special in San Jose, we heard about the foothills, the greenery, the views, and about the Mexican Heritage Plaza, Alum Rock Park, Eastridge Mall, Marks Hotdogs, Emma Prusch Farm, and the list goes on.\n\nThrough the responses to the four questions, the artists gained a good sense of the community. The responses articulated the richness and diversity of East San Jose. It helped the artists get to know you.\n\nIn case you missed it, the meetings were recorded. Due to a technical glitch, the meeting on January 9 had to be re-recorded. Instead of watching the activity, we share how it went. The meeting on January 11 went off without any glitches and the recording, in Spanish, has the same artists presentation, and you can watch how the activity was facilitated. Links to the recorded meetings are available on YouTube:\n\nEBRC Station Art Enhancement 1-9-2023\n\nEBRC Majora artistica la estacion 1-11-2023\n\nJanuary 9, 2023 - presentation slides and script\n\nJanuary 11, 2023 - presentation slides and script (Spanish)\n\nIf you attended, or missed it, but had a thought to any of the questions asked that we should include, go ahead and send that to community.outreach@vta.org, and we will pass that along to the art team.\n\nLater this spring, we will host the next meeting to update and share the concepts each of the artists’ have for the new stations!\n\nStakeholder Working Group\n\nA Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) has been created.

The removal of additional trees is a result of new information, received from PG&E, that trees above a certain height under high voltage electric lines are required to be cleared for public safety reasons and to provide access to the lines for maintenance and repairs.\n\nAll trees removed by the Project will be replaced at ratios determined by their size and replacement species (i.e., native versus non-native). In the Second Addendum to the Final SEIR-2 approved in February 2020, the VTA Board approved the payment of in-lieu fees to replace trees within two miles of the project corridor to the maximum extent practicable given the limited right-of-way available for tree replacement within the project limits. According to a tree inventory conducted by a certified arborist, the Project will be required to provide an additional 67 – 128 replacement trees depending on the replacement species (i.e., native versus non-native).\n\nOn February 18, 2021, the Congestion Management Program and Planning Committee (CMPP) will make a recommendation to VTA's Board of Directors regarding the adoption of the Third Addendum and approval of the proposed change to the Project.\n\nOn March 4, 2021, VTA's Board of Directors will consider adoption of the Third Addendum and approval of the proposed change to the Project.\n\nIf you have any written comments on the adoption of the Third Addendum and the approval of the change to the Project, it is requested that you submit them as soon as possible but no later than 12:00 pm on February 17, 2021, for the CMPP meeting, and no later than 12:00 pm on March 4, 2021, for the Board meeting.\n\nVerbal comments may also be provided at both meetings via Zoom.

On this page you will see all open and upcoming contracting opportunities, learn how to register for contract notifications, and become certified with VTA's Business Diversity Program.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Eastridge to BART Regional Connector Project (EBRC) extends light rail from the existing Alum Rock Light Rail Station to the Eastridge Transit Center with an elevated guideway primarily in the center of the Capitol Expressway. The Eastridge extension will include an elevated light rail station at Story Road and an at-grade station located at the Eastridge Transit Center. When this project is complete, VTA riders can board the light rail at the Eastridge Station and connect directly with BART at the Milpitas Station.\n\nThis project (formerly Capitol Expressway Light Rail Project) has been delivered in phases. The first phase was delivered in two parts. In Phase 1A, VTA addressed pedestrian access and improved safety measures along the expressway between Quimby Road and Capitol Avenue. This was completed in Fall 2012 and included new sidewalks, street lighting, and a landscaping buffer. Phase 1B was the reconstruction of the Eastridge Transit Center. The improvements to the transit center included new shelters and amenities and support BRT. This was completed in 2015.\n\nThe light rail extension is Phase 2, and the final phase of the larger Capitol Expressway Transit Improvement Project that transforms the Capitol Expressway into a multi-modal expressway offering bus rapid transit (BRT), light rail transit, and safe connections to the regional transit system.\n\nProject Status\n\nConstruction has started and is anticipated to be completed in 2028. Construction activities will increase traffic and drive time from permanent and temporary lane closures on Capitol Expressway. Construction activities are noisy. There will be large equipment that causes vibrations that will be felt by people who live or work along the corridor.\n\nWeekly Updates\n\n071924 Community Outreach Trailer Has Arrived\n\nTo All,\n\nConstruction activities are taking place at multiple locations along the 2.4-mile Eastridge to BART Regional Connector.

Even though we at VTA have had to adjust to to the way we work, the planning work on Eastridge to BART Regional Connector Project continued. Let's catch up!\n\nStation Art Enhancement\n\nDid You Miss the Station Art Concept Meetings - August 31, AND September 13?\n\nVTA has provided opportunities for community review of proposed light rail station art concepts. The designs the artists presented were inspired and influenced by community input shared in January’s Meet the Artists meetings and coupled with the artists’ research.\n\nEastridge Station\n\nOur first meeting, held on August 31 revealed the design for Eastridge Station. Artists Laura Haddad and Tom Drugan presented Radiance, an abstract sculpture inspired by East San Jose’s community celebrations, agricultural history, natural environment, and quality of light.\n\nRadiance is a metaphoric graft of aspects of the Eastridge Station’s surrounding community and nature in which its diverse cultures and landscapes come together to form a radiant whole. The sculpture forms a portal to be walked through. It is intended to be located so it will greet residents and visitors from many vantage points at the nexus of the future light rail station, bus terminals, Park & Ride, and pedestrian trails.\n\nThe sculpture changes in appearance as people move around and through it. When viewed from the front, its lower arbor pipes form a subtle heart shape. Viewed diagonally, they form a moon-like ellipse. Viewed from the side, the vertical arbor pipes with the matrix on top suggest a grove of trees. Standing beneath the sculpture will be like looking up into a tree canopy of fruit and flowers. Walking through the sculpture is intended to be a small moment of magic.\n\nStory Road Station\n\nBuilding on the momentum and spirit of weaving in community engagement and historical research, artist Amir Fallah presented his design concept for Story Road Station, Interwoven on September 13.\n\nInterwoven was inspired by San José’s diverse patchwork of people, cultures, and landscapes. The concept transforms the three elevator towers, and pedestrian overcrossing, into a feature gateway over Capitol Expressway. Collaborating with the architects, the original metal panels design has been reimagined in a custom blueberry color palette, designed to visually connect the three towers. Standing proud of the tower cladding are sixteen glass light boxes of various sizes. The light boxes are strategically placed to be seen from every vantage point, including the roadway, sidewalks, stairs, lightrail platform, and from the train itself. The vibrant and colorful images, lit from within, will have an identity both day and night.\n\nInterwoven features a complex array of images that portray the intersection of landscapes and cultures that is San José. The lightbox element of the artwork includes pictures and patterning from the cultures making up the tapestry of San José, including indigenous, Mexican, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian, and Persian. Throughout the artwork geometric designs refer to the larger theme of interconnectivity and community. A redwood tree refers to the nearby forests, a hand holding a mirror reflects a Mexican desert landscape, a detailed geometric motif commonly seen in East Asian artwork is placed alongside a traditional Mexican textile pattern. Driving south on Capitol Expressway a dreamed panoramic image, split in two, continues from the east elevator tower to the western tower.\n\nContributing an additional dimension to the work, Mr. Fallah will be commissioning four San José poets, several from east San José, to contribute lines of poetry that will be a central component of the artwork. They will be prompted to respond to themes of travel, journey, voyage, and wandering. From the submissions, Mr. Fallah will select text as part of the artwork.\n\nEach of the recorded meetings and copy of the presentation are linked below for your review.\n\nYou have one more opportunity to see the artists presentations\n\nThe City of San Jose Public Art Committee will receive similar presentations from the artists when they meet on October 3, 2023 at 5:30pm. Both stations will be reviewed. The San Jose Art Commission meetings are open to the public. Refer directly to the Public Art Committee website for meeting agenda and other information.\n\nDownload the Station Art Concept presentations:\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 8-31-23 – English\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 8-31-23 – Spanish\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 9-13-23-English\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Presentation 9-13-23-Spanish\n\nOr watch the recorded meetings located on SCVTA YouTube:\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 8-31-23-English\n\nEastridge Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 8-31-23-Spanish\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 9-13-23-English\n\nStory Road Station Art Enhancement Community Meeting Recording 9-13-23-Spanish\n\nPreviously\n\nMeet the Artists!\n\nWe have been very excited to introduce the community to the artists selected to enhance the new light rail stations planned for Story Road and Eastridge. Through a rigorous process of artist outreach and selection, Amir Fallah, and the team of Laura Haddad and Tom Drugan, have been commissioned. These artists are all experienced public artists. Their work extends beyond their studios and responds to site and community. They also have track records for sizable, successfully maintainable, permanent public artworks.\n\nThe Station Art Enhancement Community Meetings held on January 9 and January 11 (facilitated in Spanish) were the “kick-off” for the artists’ design process, in advance of them doing any design work. The purpose of the meetings were for the community to become acquainted with the artists, and to get a sense of their visual vocabulary and their approach to public art. Each artists presented examples of previous public art installations, and their approach to the designs and mediums used. These meetings were also meant to provide foundational inspiration for the artists’ work, here, in San Jose.\n\nThrough an on-line activity, participants responded to four questions:\n\n1. Which neighborhood are you connected to? What is important for us to know about it?\n\n2. Think about a place that is special to you in San Jose. Describe the spot and why you chose it?\n\n3. Please provide three words describing what is important to you personally, or which symbolize your community?\n\n4. What is one of your favorite public artworks in San Jose (or anywhere)? Why?\n\nThe meetings provided an opportunity for the artists to learn about the community. It was not surprising that participants represented a wide variety of East San Jose neighborhoods! When asked about a place that is special in San Jose, we heard about the foothills, the greenery, the views, and about the Mexican Heritage Plaza, Alum Rock Park, Eastridge Mall, Marks Hotdogs, Emma Prusch Farm, and the list goes on.\n\nThrough the responses to the four questions, the artists gained a good sense of the community. The responses articulated the richness and diversity of East San Jose. It helped the artists get to know you.\n\nIn case you missed it, the meetings were recorded. Due to a technical glitch, the meeting on January 9 had to be re-recorded. Instead of watching the activity, we share how it went. The meeting on January 11 went off without any glitches and the recording, in Spanish, has the same artists presentation, and you can watch how the activity was facilitated.

The removal of additional trees is a result of new information, received from PG&E, that trees above a certain height under high voltage electric lines are required to be cleared for public safety reasons and to provide access to the lines for maintenance and repairs.\n\nAll trees removed by the Project will be replaced at ratios determined by their size and replacement species (i.e., native versus non-native). In the Second Addendum to the Final SEIR-2 approved in February 2020, the VTA Board approved the payment of in-lieu fees to replace trees within two miles of the project corridor to the maximum extent practicable given the limited right-of-way available for tree replacement within the project limits. According to a tree inventory conducted by a certified arborist, the Project will be required to provide an additional 67 – 128 replacement trees depending on the replacement species (i.e., native versus non-native).\n\nOn February 18, 2021, the Congestion Management Program and Planning Committee (CMPP) will make a recommendation to VTA's Board of Directors regarding the adoption of the Third Addendum and approval of the proposed change to the Project.\n\nOn March 4, 2021, VTA's Board of Directors will consider adoption of the Third Addendum and approval of the proposed change to the Project.\n\nIf you have any written comments on the adoption of the Third Addendum and the approval of the change to the Project, it is requested that you submit them as soon as possible but no later than 12:00 pm on February 17, 2021, for the CMPP meeting, and no later than 12:00 pm on March 4, 2021, for the Board meeting.\n\nVerbal comments may also be provided at both meetings via Zoom.
