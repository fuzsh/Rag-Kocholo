According to CISA “The nation’s growing dependency on IT makes the Information Technology Sector mission – to identify and protect against cyber threats and vulnerabilities - more complex and important every day.” Cybersecurity is a vital part of the nation's industrial infrastructure, impacting various industrial sectors but not limited to, emergency services, defense industrial base, manufacturing, dams and waterways, and energy. Cybersecurity also plays a critical role in the protection of the diverse array of the 15 CTE industry sectors such as, agriculture, business and finance, health science, arts, media, and entertainment, among others.\n\nThe 2023 Cyber Security Report report conducted by Check Point Research discusses the challenge of protecting both public and private network assets. There is an increased emphasis to stimulate interest at middle and high school levels through sponsored competitions such as, the Air Force Association’s CyberPatriot. Our students have engaged in competitions such as the USCyberPatrioit national competition. This year our intent is to participate in more events in the Bay Area Cyber League. The BayCyber Presentation video includes former Irvington student participation at the 9 minute, 48 second mark. As a student, there are10 Reasons You Should Consider a Career in Cybersecurity. The BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) projects a faster than average employment growth rate at 32% from 2018 to 2028. Any interested student can participate in these competitions. You do not need to be enrolled in a cybersecurity class to participate in cybersecurity competitions, nor do you need experience.\n\nIndustry Certifications: Through the Cisco Networking Academy, we offer select courses leading toward industry recognized certifications. Industry certifications are valuable to employers because they verify a job candidate's technical skillset. Having earned a certification credential, an employer can safely assume that the candidate has proven knowledge and skill in a particular subject. These certifications are, CompTIA A+; CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) and CCNA CyberOps. These courses have been approved by DOD (Department of Defense) for inclusion in the DoD-Approved 8570 Baseline Certifications for Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program. They are an accepted certification for job roles of CCSP Cybersecurity Analyst and CCSP Incident Responder\n\nTesting Facility: Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST) certification program -- Cisco has partnered with Certiport to create the Cisco Certified support Technician (CCST) certification program. We applied to Certiport and have been designated as a Certiport Authorized Testing Center (CATC) for CCST Networking and CCST Cybersecurity.\n\nCisco Mobile Testing -- Cisco Mobile Testing provides the ability to integrate testing as part of a certification training program that will help increase the rate at which students can successfully achieve certification. The current list of proctored exams are CCNA, DevNet Associate, CyberOps Associate and CCNP.\n\nGet ready to challenge yourself, collaborate with classmates in any of the above fields, and embark on an exciting journey of innovation and growth. Welcome to your first step in becoming a success!"
