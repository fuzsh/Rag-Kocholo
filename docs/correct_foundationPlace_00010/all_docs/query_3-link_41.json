        "text": "Employees' paths to Uber and previous experiences are all unique. We spoke to 11 women across our Engineering and Product teams in India about their journeys to Uber, growth on the job, and what life’s really like once they joined.\n\nTwo veterans-turned-software engineers find love, then Uber. From working on amphibious ships to joining coding boot camps, Anthony and Miah Clay certainly have an interesting and interwoven path to Uber.\n\nWe believe in learning by doing — and that there is no better classroom than real-world experience. We trust that you know what you’re doing and that you can learn whatever you don’t. That’s why every Uber intern is supported by both a manager and mentor.\n\nUber received the Data Streaming Award at the annual Kafka Summit 2023 organized by Confluent – the world’s largest data streaming conference – for innovation, impact, and interest in how we use data streaming to power the services you love."
