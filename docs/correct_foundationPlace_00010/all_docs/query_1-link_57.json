Ayesha is passionate about preventing nonprofit burnout and encouraging boundaries and balance in the workplace.\n\nIn her home country of South Africa, Ayesha worked in community organizing around issues of education equality and gender justice. She has held project manager positions at the organizations Equal Education and Olico Education in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nIn her free time, Ayesha is an avid knitter, home cook and bread baker.

He has worked in a variety of settings including non-profit organizations serving low-income populations, and juvenile detention facilities working with sexual trauma and gang violence. Chris currently works in private practice with a broad range of clients.\n\nChristopher is guided by the belief that we are all imperfect people hoping to be better. Sometimes failing, sometimes successful, but always hopeful. Normalizing mental health and vulnerability is a central mission for Christopher, and he feels it is the best way to foster connection.\n\nIn his spare time, Christopher wrestles with existential dread, imposter syndrome, and enjoys fishing for big game fish.\n\nKaila (she/her/hers) identifies as 2nd generation Chinese American. She completed her graduate education in clinical psychology and social work from Columbia University and the University of Southern California, respectively. Kaila is currently a candidate at the Emory University Psychoanalytic Institute.\n\nA San Francisco native, Kaila is now based in Atlanta where she works as a psychotherapist. In private practice, she works predominantly with AAPI folx on issues pertaining to attachment, stress, and identity. Kaila is passionate about advocating for racial, gender, class, and mental healthcare equity in a variety of settings.\n\nWhen she isn’t working, Kaila can be found cuddling with her three cats, searching for the best eats, and watching the latest cartoon or horror series.\n\nLisa (she/her/hers) is a first generation Chinese-American based out of Chicago, Illinois. At AMHC, Lisa serves as the Director of Human Resources. In this role, she supports subtle asian mental health on Facebook and is the Internship and Volunteer Coordinator at AMHC. Inspired by community organizers, Lisa is especially passionate about addressing structural and systemic change. She is dedicated to addressing mental health in a grassroots, community-first manner. Lisa’s personal mission is “to do good,” and this led her to study for her Master’s of Social Work at the University of Chicago. As someone who sees a therapist every week, Lisa aims to help destigmatize mental health in the Asian community by normalizing therapy and conversations about mental health.\n\nLisa has served in housing and homelessness for the last 4 years. During her internship experiences in Chicago, Japan, and South Africa, she saw firsthand how factors like the environment, food security, housing, and homelessness affect people all over the world. Witnessing how these structural issues impact society has motivated Lisa to address barriers to mental health access. Lisa is passionate about the intersection of social justice and mental health and currently serves as a Mental Health Justice Organizer at ONE: Northside and as a Civic Engagement Educator at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn her free time, Lisa enjoys reading, weightlifting, running, dancing, and cooking.\n\nChristian (he/him/his) is a Filipino-American new to the Bay Area hailing from the Greater New York Metropolitan area (specifically by way of the GREATEST New Jersey area). He works at Apple as a project manager and has a personal passion for exploring the intersection of mental health and technology. A 16-year survivor of Major Depressive Disorder, Christian strives to explore new ways of fostering awareness and understanding of mental illness through digital storytelling.\n\nChristian wrote his Master’s thesis at Columbia University on the depiction of Depression in video games and their efficacy in promoting empathy compared to other media. Currently, he is designing Virtual Reality experiences that portray mental health disorders through different perspectives. He helped co-found WAVES in NYC in 2019 to create a space to share Asian stories and to destigmatize conversation around mental health.\n\nIn his free time, Christian likes to lounge on the couch with some streaming and video games or go completely off the grid into nature.\n\nJohn (he/him/his) is a Filipino-American Technology Consultant in Atlanta, Georgia.

Stemming from issues of anxiety in the past and a close friend passing due to mental health issues, he has a strong interest in mental health advocacy and destigmatization. His dream is to combine his technology experience with his interest in mental health to help others in his community.\n\nIn his spare time, he loves to play music and be outdoors. He plays in a band, has a YouTube channel, and has hiked the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail.\n\nMIchael Ge (he/him) does digital marketing and web design in New York City. Raised in Wisconsin, he spent lots of time figuring out what his Asian identity meant– he’s firmly settled on the answer of equally loving cheese curds and red braised pork.\n\nHe works alongside minority- and immigrant-owned businesses in NYC and Wisconsin, crafting websites, consulting on business strategy, and creating educational marketing resources. Michael graduated from Washington University in St. Louis (‘22), where he built a pan-Asian mental health conference and discovered that the wonder of on-demand cafeteria chicken tenders does, indeed, get stale. Having made pit-stops in education, healthcare IT, and software development, he’s eagerly focusing his energies into for-impact work. Michael loves connecting with like-minded people (maybe it’s you, if you’ve read this far 😁)!\n\nWhen Michael isn’t working, he is an avid breaker, locker, and house dancer. When his knees aren’t working, he’s busy getting through his immense backlog of video games. He always adores cooking for his partner and catching a Liverpool match on weekends.\n\nJeanie Chang is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and Founder of Your Change Provider, PLLC®, an interdisciplinary practice founded on solutions and her unique framework Cultural Condence®.
