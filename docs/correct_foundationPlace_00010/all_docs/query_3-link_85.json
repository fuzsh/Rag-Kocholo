        "text": "Sebastian Holst, Senior Analyst, The Gilbane Group, March – July 8, 2003\n\nSponsored by Sun Microsystems\n\nThis paper includes 6 sections. The first section includes an overview the Sun ONE content services platform and a discussion of its applicability to financial services organizations in combination with Documentum’s enterprise content management (ECM) platform. The next 5 sections describe how each of Sun’s content management technology partners integrate with the Sun ONE architecture.\n\nVignette\n\nDocumentum\n\nInterwoven\n\nMy Yahoo! Enterprise Edition\n\nFileNet\n\nThere are also links to individual partner PDF versions in the relevant sections below.\n\nThe Sun ONE Content Infrastructure Platform for the Financial Services Industry\n\nYou can also download a PDF version of this section (8 pages).\n\nThis paper presents the case for proactively developing a broad content strategy and architecture built upon a “content-capable” infrastructure. Optimizing operational efficiency, leveraging existing technology investments and investing in emerging business opportunities are among the many, often competing, demands on today’s businesses. The teaming of the Sun ONE Content Infrastructure Platform with the Documentum enterprise content management (ECM) platform presents an example that illustrates the benefits of an integrated architecture and advanced content management services.\n\nWhy an Infrastructure Approach?\n\nContent Volume, Diversity, and Complexity\n\nToday’s businesses are faced with an exponential growth in business content. Many companies have deployed enterprise content management systems to control, leverage, and reduce the cost of managing and delivering business critical content. The problem of managing enterprise content however, is too cumbersome for point-application solutions to solve alone. Businesses need to develop a comprehensive content strategy and architecture that is built upon a content-capable infrastructure.\n\nThe increase in the volume of content is only part of the problem. Content has become increasingly richer and more complex.\n\nContent is comprised of multiple data types sourced from disparate repositories and databases.\n\nThe use of rich media content is growing, which adds new requirements is management functionality, bandwidth and storage.\n\nBusinesses are learning the benefits (and difficulties) of more sophisticated use of metadata, which compounds the complexity of content.\n\nContent in the enterprise includes a wide variety of formats, including structured database records, and unstructured text, graphics, audio, video and streaming media. There are a growing number of content application services, including web content management, document management, digital asset management, knowledge management, enterprise search and categorization, collaboration, and syndication that focus on managing either specific content types, or specific aspects of the enterprise content management problem. Many medium to large sized companies now have many of these content services in place, but while these provide important benefits, in most cases their real value is only realized when the content is integrated with larger enterprise data systems, and when a business has implemented disciplined, yet flexible, business process management.\n\nThe good news is that more business content is being managed; the bad news is the growing complexity of integrating and managing all of the systems that manage the content.\n\nContent Accessibility & Integration\n\nMost enterprise content is tightly integrated with one or more business applications (although that is not to say it is integrated with all appropriate business applications). Content plays a critical role in business processes ranging from customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), business intelligence (BI), and other enterprise applications. In order for these processes to provide value, they must be able to incorporate the right data, in the right process, at the right time. Content often comes from diverse repositories across the enterprise and even between enterprises that have business-to-business relationships. Data exists in structured databases or may exist as unstructured data in numerous content repositories – from the desktop to back-up tapes. Furthermore, many companies already have one or more enterprise systems, and most companies need a strategy for extending the value of, and not replacing, those systems. Yet, there also needs to be a strategy that allows for a smooth migration to new systems when there is a need for technology change.\n\nNot only is content complexity on the rise, but the integration required to make a content solution provide value for the enterprise has become a daunting challenge. Companies need a strategy that simplifies content accessibility and helps to manage this content complexity throughout the content lifecycle.\n\nContent Services Infrastructure\n\nThe rise in content complexity means that businesses need to follow an infrastructure approach that enables content services throughout the enterprise. It means that IT managers need to deploy an architecture that ties content and content-based applications together in powerful yet flexible ways. The need to share and integrate content is broad based, and not limited to particular vertical or departmental applications. Therefore it doesn’t make sense to solve the problem only through individual integration efforts – a strategy that is based an infrastructure approach is the only way to meet this challenge head on.\n\nToday, this means deploying a stack built on a network-computing infrastructure foundation. It also means an architecture that can support legacy applications, but is designed to optimize the use of web services for both content and application integration.\n\nSun ONE Content Infrastructure Platform\n\nThe Sun Open Net Environment (Sun ONE) Content Infrastructure platform in Figure 1 (Diagram courtesy of Sun Microsystems, Inc.) is an example of what we mean by an integrated infrastructure for content services. The figure illustrates the way business content and processes fit into infrastructure stacks both vertically and horizontally. This requirement for an integrated content services approach cuts across various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, government, media and entertainment, and of course, financial services.\n\nFigure 1 is designed to show the range of solutions that Sun provides, from servers, storage and operating system, to application server, identity management, and portal technologies. On top of this network computing infrastructure Sun partner technology can be integrated into this modular architecture. This illustration also suggests how one could incorporate other component technologies into an integrated infrastructure. Note that if you think of an infrastructure in this way, light is shed on the relationship and scope of the components, which is very useful given the extensive functional overlap between many of the functional categories. It is important to understand the functions and features of the various components, so as to better able to make your own choices to match your business requirements, and to be able to substitute components with minimal effort, and cost.\n\nOne Architecture, Multiple Choices\n\nParadoxically, the one-to-many relationship between an architecture and the suppliers that populate that architecture is both the root of the value proposition, and often the cause of anxiety for businesses that must assimilate and build out that architecture. This anxiety often results in avoidance strategies that rely unnecessarily upon service-laden “one-stop” solutions at the high-end or simpler, more proprietary solutions at the low-end.\n\nA compelling characteristic of the Sun ONE Content Integration Platform is that it provides an infrastructure that frees content technology providers to focus valuable resources on their areas of expertise by providing easy and reliable access to critical portal, networking and storage services. The following section illustrates the value of this approach by taking a closer look at the synergistic characteristics of the combined Sun ONE Content Integration Platform and the Documentum ECM platform.\n\nThe Documentum ECM Platform\n\nEnterprise Content Management Platform Provides Real-Time Control over Enterprise Content and Documentation\n\nJust as Sun has considered the complete solution as it delivers a “content capable” infrastructure, Documentum has also anticipated the broad requirements an enterprise will have in order to manage content throughout a customers’ own product lifecycle including design, manufacture, sales, marketing, customer support, and maintenance.\n\nThe Documentum architecture hosts and integrates each of its product components including web content, digital asset and compliance management. However, the value of Documentum’s architecture is that its approach ensures that their suite of components can leverage an infrastructure such as the Sun ONE Content Integration Platform.\n\nTargeted Feature Functionality for the Financial Services Industry Clarifies Value Proposition and Speeds Adoption\n\nA comprehensive content architecture that is built upon a content-capable infrastructure is by its very nature a generalized, scalable solution whose value stems from an ability to ingest, manage and distribute all kinds of content across the complete spectrum of use cases. Paradoxically, it is the generality, or horizontal design, that often makes specific applications and use cases difficult to evaluate and specify, and expensive and time consuming to deploy.\n\nFinancial professionals live in a world filled with funds, portfolios, trades, customers, regulations and reports. They do not think in terms of content infrastructure services. Generalized technology that has been embedded in specific applications targeting particular use cases is often simpler to cost justify, easier to deploy, and more valuable to the customer.\n\nDocumentum offers financial services applications designed to increase the value of their ECM services platform to financial service institutions. These solutions are intended to reduce expenses while addressing complex enterprise content management issues. Documentum’s premise is that, while financial services convergence has created many opportunities, it has also increased the importance of automation and increased the complexity of regulatory compliance. Further, each financial sector: insurance (and the multiple lines with-in it) retail, commercial and investment banking, continue to have unique content management requirements. With the goal of addressing both the broader integration issues and sector- specific requirements, Documentum has packaged their products and technology into four “solution suites:”\n\nCompliance and Regulatory\n\nInfrastructure Operations and Automation\n\nClient and Corporate Communications\n\nBanking and Insurance Operations\n\nIt is Documentum’s assertion that their solutions are more than enabling technology. They are prepackaged stacks that directly address a specific class of business problem. For example, one Compliance and Regulatory “solution suite” is designed to simplify SEC 17a (For the complete text of SEC 17a visit http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec17A.html.) compliance as well as Sarbanes Oxley. The suite includes records management to address the SEC 17a regulations for “books and records” and for communications such as email and instant messaging. In addition to this, their collaboration features are offered to facilitate communication and coordination with internal and external auditors and counsel to create and implement business controls that are key to complying with Sarbanes Oxley (For complete text of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 visit http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/SOact/soact.pdf.).\n\nStraight through Processing (STP): A Case in Point\n\nAccording to SWIFT (the industry-owned cooperative that supplies secure messaging services and interface software), the lack of STP across the securities industry costs the industry $12 billion every year. This comes from the need to manually intervene as the record of a trade passes between systems from pre-trade to fulfillment.\n\nTo achieve STP, communications between the various parties connected to a trade need to be streamlined and the manual intervention in the trade process needs to be limited or completely removed. STP requires a comprehensive content architecture that is built upon a content-capable infrastructure such as the Sun ONE and Documentum solution.\n\nSTP minimizes manual handling and redundant processing which can be automated, leading to greater efficiency, as well as reduced cost and risk exposure. The value of this specialized version of a content infrastructure and service solution is easily measured in terms of\n\nLower costs per trade\n\nFaster settlement time\n\nBetter risk management and risk reduction\n\nThe trend of building commercially available specialized solution stacks built upon generalized infrastructure and content management services is extremely encouraging and is likely to become highly popular as customer successes are more widely understood.\n\nSponsoring Company\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.sun.com or contact:\n\nSun Microsystems, Inc.\n\n4150 Network Circle\n\nSanta Clara, CA 95054 USA\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.documentum.com or contact:\n\nDocumentum Inc.\n\n6801 Koll Center Parkway\n\nPleasanton, CA. 94566\n\nVignette Content Suite & Sun ONE Content Services Platform\n\nThis section presents the case for proactively developing a broad content strategy and architecture built upon a “content-capable” infrastructure. Optimizing operational efficiency, leveraging existing technology investments and investing in emerging business opportunities are among the many, often competing, demands on today’s businesses. The teaming of the Sun ONE Content Services Platform with Vignette’s Content Management and Portal Solutions presents an example that illustrates the benefits of an integrated architecture and advanced content management services.\n\nYou can also download a PDF version of this section (7 pages).\n\nThe Vignette Content Suite\n\nFull Function Content Management and Portal Solutions Deliver Business Process and Content Across the Enterprise\n\nVignette focuses its resources and talent on the management of content throughout their customers’ organizations, and to ensure that web-based interactions are personalized, meaningful, and add to an organization’s understanding of its business and the communities it serves.\n\nThe Vignette V7 architecture provides a services delivery foundation for its content management and portal offerings. The Vignette V7 architecture ensures that each of Vignette’s components work well together. However, a critical value of Vignette’s architecture is that its support for open standards including J2EE, XML and Web services allows that their suite of components to leverage components of a standards-based infrastructure such as the Sun ONE Content Services Platform.\n\nA Case in Point: The Georgia Technology Authority (GTA)\n\nEstablished by the Georgia legislature in July 2000, the GTA helps connect citizens to state government through information technology and ensures the effective use of IT resources. The GTA charter includes the development of a statewide technology plan and to oversee the purchase of technology resources. In the development of the state’s web site, www.georgia.gov, the GTA had a number of objectives including:\n\nThe presentation of easy to understand, intention-based state information and services to Georgians, regardless of physical abilities, cultural backgrounds or language\n\nThe availability of all public records, state information and Web-enabled services via the state government’s enterprise portal\n\nThe ability to share information and processes between state entities\n\nSun Microsystem’s Sun ONE Content Services Platform and Sun ONE Portal Server 6 coupled with Vignette’s Content Management provided a content management backbone with a 24X7 portal that helped GTA to achieve their goals. Notable features and benefits included:\n\nPersonalization improving service to Georgians\n\nCost reduction achieved through simplified facilities management\n\nGreater agency independence from IT staff through simplified content contribution and review and a\n\nConsistent user interface across agencies reducing training requirements and improving navigation.\n\nThese changes resulted in a ranking in the top ten best of the web for eGovernment by Government Technology Magazine, the Center for Digital Government, Public Technology, Inc., and State Technologies in 2000. The fact that the respective product lines and architectures from Sun Microsystems and Vignette can be developed independently and deployed concurrently show that that large, complex and mission critical deployments can be built upon a modular technology stack.

Optimizing operational efficiency, leveraging existing technology investments and investing in emerging business opportunities are among the many, often competing, demands on today’s businesses. The teaming of the Sun ONE Content Services Platform with the Interwoven Content Platform presents an example that illustrates the benefits of an integrated architecture and advanced content management services.\n\nYou can also download a PDF version of this section (7 pages).\n\nInterwoven’s Open Content Platform\n\nA Code and Content management and Distribution Platform Improves Service, Accelerates Development and Reduces Cost\n\nInterwoven focuses its resources and talent on the broad requirements an enterprise will have in order to manage content and code across their customers’ organizations and to ensure that the distribution of this code and content across multiple outlets is secure, accurate, timely and personalized.\n\nThe Interwoven Platform consists of four primary components; Content Integration Enterprise Repository Connector Suite, TeamSite Content Management, MetaTagger Content Intelligence, and OpenDeploy Distribution Server.\n\nThese four primary components combine to manage of a wide range of content:\n\nContent Management for Portals: Business users maintain content control, facilitate portal adoption, and place searchable content onto portals.\n\nCollaborative Document Management: Simplify document management, collaboration, and the sharing of work.\n\nMedia Asset Management: Enforce brand control across channels, reduce production and access complexity and provide marketing automation across an organization.\n\nWeb Application Management: Provide content and code management in a single environment.\n\nWeb Content Management: Create, manage, and deploy content to web sites.\n\nContent Management for CRM: Integrate unstructured enterprise content with structured customer information.\n\nA Case in Point: The American Hospital Association\n\nThe American Hospital Association, founded in 1898, has a mission to advance the health care of individuals and communities by leading, representing, and educating health care provider organizations that are accountable to the community and committed to improving healthcare. AHA members include nearly 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks and other care providers and over 37,000 individual members.\n\nThe American Hospital Association (AHA) faced a classic problem: affiliate information was spread out over multiple sites, administered by different managers on a variety of different operating platforms. AHA conceived of a unique type of portal to solve the complex content publishing and distribution issues that its members faced. The group used an enterprise-wide content management and delivery solution from Interwoven and Sun Microsystems to consolidate material from 50 disparate websites and reinvented the way that it supports, educates, and represents the interests of hospitals and healthcare providers.\n\nThe AHA solution, HospitalConnect.com, is built upon the content management and distribution products from Interwoven and the Sun ONE Content Services Platform. The resulting benefits of centralized management and automated content submission and distribution workflows across their entire affiliate community included increased operational efficiencies, a more productive workforce, better-organized content, and improved patient care.\n\nDiagram courtesy of Interwoven, Inc.\n\nSome specific characteristics of the AHA solution include\n\nAffiliates and staff contribute and manage files directly from existing word processing and desktop applications.\n\nUsers can convert content into form-based XML data\n\nCollaborative users can add “sticky notes” to content directly from their browsers.\n\nUsers can browse and review content as it appears throughout the portal and related websites.\n\nUsers can access content management tasks within an existing email system so that content can move quickly through the approval process.\n\nUsers can automatically distribute material to the HospitalConnect.com portal and AHA affiliate sites.\n\nOne advantage to Interwoven’s architecture is that its open approach ensures that their suite of components can leverage an infrastructure such as the Sun ONE Content Services Platform.\n\nThe fact that the respective product lines and architectures from Sun Microsystems and Interwoven can be developed independently and deployed concurrently is a positive indication that large, complex and mission critical deployments can be built upon a modular technology stack.\n\nThe American Hospital Association case study shows how a solid, scalable content-driven infrastructure can effectively integrate key business processes, content services, and healthcare industry solutions all into one system.\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.interwoven.com or contact:\n\nInterwoven, Inc.\n\n803 11th Avenue\n\nSunnyvale, CA 94089 USA\n\nMy Yahoo! Enterprise Edition & Sun ONE Content Services Platform\n\nThis paper presents the case for proactively developing a broad content strategy and architecture built upon a “content-capable” infrastructure. Optimizing operational efficiency, leveraging existing technology investments and investing in emerging business opportunities are among the many, often competing, demands on today’s businesses. The teaming of the Sun ONE Content Services Platform with My Yahoo! Enterprise Edition illustrates the benefits of an integrated architecture, advanced content delivery services, and premium content.\n\nYou can also download a PDF version of this section (7 pages).\n\nMy Yahoo! Enterprise Edition\n\nFamiliar Content Tools and Premium Content Drive Adoption of Corporate Portals\n\nMy Yahoo! Enterprise Edition is designed to add value to corporate portals through premium content and familiar content applications such as Industry News and Financial information to accelerate adoption and build employee, partner and customer loyalty.\n\nOne advantage of the Sun ONE open approach is that Sun and Yahoo! have been able to embed My Yahoo! modules in the Sun Portal to provide an entry point to this combined offering that requires very little effort and is simple to administer.\n\nIf You Build It, Will They Come?\n\nA technology Return On Investment (ROI) cannot be achieved without the adoption of both the technology and user behaviors that the technology was intended to facilitate. Given Yahoo!’s 72% reach into the workplace (NetRatings, January 2003); many corporate employees are frequent and dedicated Yahoo! users. By bringing Yahoo! content and tools inside the corporate portal, companies can dramatically increase portal usage and frequency. When employees go to the company portal to check their Yahoo! information, they maybe more likely to stay and use the other portal resources.\n\nBeyond the reasonable assumption that users will tend to gravitate to portals that offer the most complete and integrated set of services, the personalization modules from My Yahoo! Enterprise Edition that are embedded in the Sun ONE Portal provide a means for portal administrators to serve specialized content “in context.” For example, a financial services portal can feature banking self-service applications, surrounded by content feeds related to money management.\n\nIn this infrastructure and content offering, Sun and Yahoo! offer a unique pairing that should increase user demand for Sun ONE-based portals and open new markets for Yahoo! content services.\n\nFor more information, please visit http://enterprise.yahoo.com or contact:\n\nYahoo! Inc.\n\n701 First Avenue\n\nSunnyvale, California 94089\n\nFileNet Business Process Manager & Sun ONE Content Services Platform\n\nThis paper presents the case for proactively developing a broad content strategy and architecture built upon a “content-capable” infrastructure. Optimizing operational efficiency, leveraging existing technology investments and investing in emerging business opportunities are among the many, often competing, demands on today’s businesses. The teaming of the Sun ONE Content Services Platform with FileNet’s Business Process Manager presents a solution that illustrates the benefits of an integrated architecture and advanced content management solution.\n\nYou can also download a PDF version of this section (7 pages).\n\nThe FileNet BPM Solution\n\nBusiness Process Management across the Enterprise\n\nJust as Sun has considered the complete solution as it delivers a “content capable” infrastructure, FileNet has also anticipated the broad requirements an enterprise will have in order to manage content throughout their organizations and to effectively automate and streamline business processes.\n\nFileNet’s P8 offering is differentiated by its Business Process Management capabilities, which include integrated process simulation, reporting and analytics. The FileNet P8 architecture features four pre-packaged suites including the Business Process Manager suite, designed for applications that automate complex business processes to improve process performance and reduce cycle times. FileNet’s real time and historical tracking of these processes combined its process analysis and simulation capabilities place a premium on utilization of resources and process optimization.\n\nFileNet’s P8 architecture hosts and integrates each of its enterprise content management offerings including its Business Process Manager, Content Manager, Web Content Manager and Image Manager as shown below. The standards-based FileNet P8 architecture ensures that each of FileNet’s ECM components work well together. In addition, FileNet’s approach ensures that their family of ECM offerings can leverage an open systems, network infrastructure like the Sun ONE Content Services platform.\n\nA Case in Point: The State of New Jersey Division of Revenue\n\nThe State of New Jersey Division of Revenue processes tax returns and payments from New Jersey taxpayers totaling more than 8.5 million total returns and remittances each year. Prior to deploying the Sun and FileNet image-enabled processing system, the cost to the state and its citizens included a combined permanent and seasonal staff of 700 and mounting delays in revenue collection. The “heads down” method of processing returns increased repetitive strain injuries resulting in increased medical expenses, lost time and lawsuits.\n\nToday, the Division of Revenue’s image-enabled processing systems handle in excess of 1 million pages per day during peak periods, while more than 250 users in seven state agencies retrieve more than 23,000 documents each day. Taxpayers now receive more timely responses to their inquiries and, on average, are sent their refunds one week earlier. Seasonal staffing and tax processing costs have both been reduced by 50 percent and storage costs have been cut in half.\n\nThe State of New Jersey success story is powerful for a number of important reasons. First, in order to achieve their objectives, legacy technology and practices (processes) had to be upgraded simultaneously. Second, the sheer scale and time-sensitive nature of the project illustrates how critical it is to be able to build on a broad and deep architecture that facilitates complex integrations of technology components and workflows.\n\nThe fact that the respective product lines and architectures from Sun Microsystems and FileNet can be developed independently and deployed concurrently can be seen as a positive indication that large, complex and mission-critical deployments can be built upon a modular technology stack.\n\nFurther, the New Jersey case study shows how a solid, scalable content-driven infrastructure can effectively integrate key business processes, content services, and government agency industry solutions all into one system.\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.FileNet.com or contact:"
