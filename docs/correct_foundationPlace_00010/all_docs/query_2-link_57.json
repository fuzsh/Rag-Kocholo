        "text": "NBUC Runathon 5K Run for Sustainability - A dream run, comes true ! It was just an idea in the brainstorming meeting at the beginning of the year hosted by our Director and Head of NBUC, Ponni Krishnamoorthy. Thanks to her vision and direction to celebrate this decade long journey and legacy of NBUC, we have lined up 10 ambitious programs included in the wider umbrella of “Decathon” ( like Labathon, Makethon, Appathon , Ideathon ,etc.). One of which is #NokiaRunathon. We chose the theme as 'Run for Sustainability' and the date was well planned - on the weekend following the World Environment Day (June 5th ) which was also the Global Running Day, celebrated on the first wednesday of June to promote the joys of running and a healthier lifestyle. As planned, on June 9th 2024, we had that dream come true , alongwith the entire team of Nokia Bangalore University Collaboration and other Nokians who volunteered and also University Students and Professors who were invited for the event. An inspiring marathoner Venkatesh Adiga was our Chief Guest. He shared his running journey and wonderful tips for all runners and has inspired many of us with his engrossing talk. He also Flagged-off the Run and followed it up himself doing a Super-Fast Run- but it must have been just a walk in the park for him. Thanks to all the runners who made this event a successful one. We had a very diverse participation of engineering students from PESU, RVCE, RV University, RNSIT and DSCE and also enthusiastic professors from these universities. We also had passionate Nokia Runners who made this Sunday - A Day at Office, by participating in the Runathon ! Energetic emcees Senapathy K and subbaiah nachiappan kept all the participants engaged throughout and also got us warmed-up for the Run. Arun Gopinath, Head - Technology Centre, Mobile Networks at Nokia Bangalore delivered the key-note speech on \"Software as a catalyst for Sustainability\" which was very interesting and opened up totally different perspective of how we can all influence and contribute to building Sustainable SW products. For me, it was a pleasure to work with everyone in planning and organizing this event alongwith Chandrakala M and Prema Hebbar which would remain very close to my heart for many years to come and I thank #NBUC , especially Ponni and #Nokia for such an opportunity. My heartfelt thanks to each and everyone involved in the event and also to all in Bangalore Location Steering Board for their enthusiastic support for conducting such a memorable event. Ponni Krishnamoorthy, Chandrakala M, Indumathi Sandirane, Adarsh Ramakrishnappa, Arun Gopinath, Venkatesh Adiga, Karthik K N, Vinayak BA, Senapathy K, subbaiah nachiappan Prema Hebbar best regards, Prashanth"
