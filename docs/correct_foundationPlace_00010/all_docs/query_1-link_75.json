        "text": "July 9, 2020\n\n3.5 #TeamKai stars!\n\nThe Year of Falling in Love is the second book of Isabella Anders. I read the first book a few weeks ago, and I was so excited to dig into this one. Honestly, I don’t know how I’m going to wait for book 3! I am so curious to what is going to happen with Isa’s situation.\n\nThere is a lot going on in Isabella Anders life. After her Dad and Lynn threaten to send her to a reform school, she is able to move in with her Grandma Stephy and cousin Indigo. She’s still trying to find out about her past, her life, and most importantly, her mother. She’s got her long time crush Kyler in the picture, and her best friend (who she’s also got some feelings for), Kyler’s brother, Kai. Oh yes. I love it. Kai is trying to help Isa the best he can. They may be ‘just friends’ but Kai is the guy she feels safe with, the one she feels butterflies with.\n\nDid I mention that Kai is my favorite? I adore him! Jessica Sorensen writes some of my favorite YA/NA’s. I love that she mixes romance, a tad bit of mystery, some self discovery and also a bit of the feels in this series. I enjoyed it lots, and I really hope the next installment comes out soon! I need to know who is up to what Hannah? Lynn? Dare I say Kyler?, who’s in that blue car etc.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>\n\nJune 1, 2016\n\nUPDATE AFTER I READ THE YEAR OF FALLING IN LOVE #TeamKaiEVENMORENOW\n\n#TeamKai\n\nAugust 15, 2018\n\nDue to a big old cliffhanger I had to read book two. Not that book one was bad, I was just geared up to read something new.\n\nOne page in and I’m thinking, oh god this is becoming ridiculously far fetched. Her real mother is In jail for murdering her stepmothers son? Really? It makes it easier to see why the family dynamics are so tense and over the top agressive though.\n\nThen we still have the mystery of the unknown caller keeping things chugging along nicely. And of course her feelings for Kai, I loved seeing the development with that though.\n\nI think I liked this one more than the first book, there was a lot more intrigue and even some edge of your seat moments. Finally it’s revealed who is behind everything, whilst it’s not a shocker it’s still a bit of a thrill ride until the end.\n\nOne little thing though.If I have to hear isa go on about unicorns and rainbows any longer though, I’m binning my entire kindle. Enough. Stop it.\n\n4 stars 🌟 it’s nowhere near the best series I’ve read but for some reason I can’t get enough of it. There’s a few parts that make me inwardly cringe but other than that, the drama, relationship developments and little bit of mystery really carry the book. I’ve already got the next instalment downloaded.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJanuary 23, 2018\n\nIt’s been a hot minute since I read a Jessica Sorensen novel but she has always been my favorite when it comes to the New Adult genre, so I really didn’t mind returning to this world.\n\nIsabella Anders and Kyler follow the same mold of Sorensen’s other characters. They’re a sweet couple, but they do have their slew of personal, and in this case, family trouble. They happen to seek solace in one another and it’s really an inspiring story to read. I loved how simple the writing is. It makes the more difficult scenes easier to write because the emotions feel that more raw and potent.\n\nWhile this series isn’t my favorite of Sorensen’s, I do think her writing is worth checking out, especially if you like to see how trouble family dynamics. She always comes up with complex and inventive conflicts so there’s really something for everyone to enjoy in this series.\n\nMay 22, 2016\n\nWHY IS SORENSEN DRAGGING THIS OUT?!\n\nThis book was FREE via my KINDLE UNLIMITED, so, despite the mediocre experience I had reading the first book, I gave this one a shot. After all, I did wanna read more about Kai.\n\nUnfortunately, although I did get a LOT more of Kai in this book, Isa drove me nuts. She was very wishy-washy, and that insecure girl she once was continued to resurface throughout this book. Also, her family issues suddenly got really extreme - moreso than I expected. There was a sudden jump from the first book to this, and it just felt off to me. I can't say I appreciated it.\n\nKyler makes more of an appearance in this book too, and I didn't really like that... It just started feeling like a tug of war b/w the two brothers, and just this whole long, drawn out process of Isa ping ponging back and forth. Waste of time. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the occasional love triangle, but like I've always emphasized... it's gotta be worth it. I hate it when authors create love triangles just for the sake of doing it, or drawing out the inevitable. There's NO question that Kyler's not the one for Isa.... it's just a matter of her SEEING what's right in front of her. SIGH.\n\nOverall, the plot was more dry than the first book. I thought the whole story could've been wrapped up in this book, but Sorensen's dragging this out for another. I do like Kai still, but not sure if I'll be interested in picking up the third book by the time it's released. Again, Kai and Isa's interactions were noteworthy, but nothing else really stood out.\n\nIf you really liked the first book, then MAYBE give this a try, but otherwise -- NO. Skip it & move on! There are books with actual plots and with no cliffhingers that you can read instead.\n\nJanuary 4, 2016\n\n3.5 stars\n\nI was very excited to get the second book in this series. The first one ended at such a pinnacle point in the story I was desperate to get more. I had so many questions that I needed answers to.\n\nBook two picked up right were book one left off and was written well, with highs and lows in all the right places. However in the grand scheme of things it fell flat for me. None of the big issues got resolved and Isa was really wishy-washy about everything.\n\nWe get to know Kai a little better with this book being duel perspectives. But most of what we learn is in regards to his feelings for Isa. I felt like he needed more depth to his story.\n\nIsa is seventeen in the book and it shows. She is just a jumble of nerves, fears, and indecision. While this holds true for most teen girls by the end of the book I found myself liking her less and less.\n\nI do love the love, support, and kick in the butt that Isa's Grandma and cousin give. They truly care about her and can get vicious when fighting to protect her.\n\nOverall a good story but, I wish I could have gotten more out of it.\n\nReviewed for FMR Book Grind\n\nDecember 29, 2019\n\nAs soon as I finished Book #1, I just had to continue with Book #2 The Year of Falling in Love as the series was getting good with its twists and turns. I have to admit that I didn't enjoy this book as much as Book #1 though as I hate when the characters play with feelings and games as Isabella is getting more confident and is almost dating both brothers Kai and Kyler. Though I think she should end up with Kai as Kyler is your usual jock playboy and only likes her now that she is at pretty status whereas Kai has always been in the background and been her friend. At the end of Book #1, it's we learned Isabella's name and in Book #2 Kai's friend Big Doug does some research and learns that her mother has been in prison for murder and that murder is connected to Lynn - the woman who raised her. In Book #2 Isabella is still receiving threatening messages and has been banned seeing her grandmother which of course isn't going to stop her as she feels like she can't turn to anyone else but her grandmother Stephy. Also, mother's there is someone following Isabella in a blue car? Who is the mysterious person and why don't they want Isabella to find out about her mother? We didn't find out the identity of the person in Book #2 so hoping when I move onto Book #3 more answers will be revealed as this series is getting good and I have my fingers crossed that hopefully Isabella will be reunited with her mother eventually and the real truth revealed\n\nOctober 21, 2016\n\nI got this free on Goodreads, and it was worth every penny. Apparently it's the second book in a series of three, so no worries about spoilers because it doesn't even HAVE an ending in this volume. It starts out with a girl named Isabel who is living with a father and stepmother that she evidently hates, and the feeling is reciprocal. Isa (as she's known) is pushing 18 with a ton of worries and being continually stressed out. She likes her next-door neighbor Kai, but has had a crush on his older brother, Notkai, or something similar to Kai, for years. Isa was taunted and laughed at all through school until she went to Europe and got a complete makeover, which evidently included a facelift or a new face and a personality transplant. Now she's a hot babe. Notkai is already in college at UW (Washington? Wisconsin? West Virginia? Wyoming?), but she and Kai have been friends since childhood. She's never been kissed, but when Kai licks her neck, and she licks his back, she can at least say she's been licked.\n\nIsa doesn't know who or where her biological mother is, or evidently how long she's been in this hateful family that includes her half-sister Hannah, a raucous, nasty person who calls her Isasmell. As the book begins, she had pushed her wicked stepmother and she and her husband decide to send Isa off to a mean school in Montana (U-M?). Instead, she runs away to her cool, hipster grandma Stephy (although she's referred to once as Grandpa Stephy, so she might be gender-questioning).\n\nDuring the course of the book, she meets characters like Big Doug, whose last name she never knows and who is \"sketchy\" because he lives in a poolhouse surrounded by computers and might be a hacker, because he has many sketchy friends and does secret missions. A guy named T (no first name or last name) smashed Kai's ribs once after Kai, in his ingenuous trustingness, guarantees a five grand loan to a known junky friend, and T is after the money. Five grand! What was he thinking? Of course, the loan to his friend, which was supposed to keep his family from debtor's prison, instead goes up the friend's nose or into his veins, and Kai is stuck with the debt.\n\nIsa can't decide whether she likes Kai or Notkai, because the latter kisses her on the corner of her mouth, whereas Kai has only licked her neck. The two brothers are jealous of each other, because Notkai is a player who wants to claim Isa as his next conquest, whereas Kai wants to be her \"friend\" (wink wink, tingle tingle).\n\nA person named Indigo, who, we find out 40 percent of the way through the book, is her cousin. She lives with Grandma or Grandpa Stephy and smokes cigarettes all the damned time. Evidently, relations between Indigo and her own parents are also less than ideal because her father keeps going on trips with his secretary, to whom he is not married, while his wife impotently fumes along.\n\nKai tries to pay his debt back by working for Big Doug, delivering a mystery envelope to an even sketchier figure in an entirely sketchy town, but he stops for five seconds at a gas station, and another guy who is built like a sumo wrestler breaks Kai's car window and grabs the secret envelope. Kai tries to get feisty with him, because what the heck, the guy's only wearing a ski mask and carrying a crowbar and is sumo-built. But naïve Kai rushes to fight him and is hit a few times with the crowbar until he has a concussion and is out cold. Also, the guy wrecks Kai's car even more and tells him Big Doug is going down.\n\nMeanwhile, Isa, who gets tingly and like melted chocolate (or once like melted caramel) (which might explain why guys like to lick her neck) whenever Kai stands two inches from her, is in a continuous dither because she has a ton of problems and hasn't grown the \"lady balls\" to solve them. She is, like, stressed to the max because of her mean father and stepmother, but she's also, like, having her heart pound in her chest whenever Kai comes close to her. She eats ice cream with cotton candy and chocolate, and worries about a blue car that follows her and once takes her picture while she's playing HORSE with NotKai. Notkai thought they were playing PONY, because he wants to quit early. He takes her to a pickup football game, although Isa HATES football, but amazingly scores the winning touchdown in front of all the mean girls wearing high heels (to a football game?)\n\nThen Isa finds out that her biological mother, whose name she doesn't know, is in prison for murder. What's going to happen? We don't know; we apparently have to pay full price for book three. Although book two made my heart beat like a cracked hummingbird, I was, like totally bummed, TOTALLY, because we didn't find out what happened. Times that by ten and that's how totally bummed I was. \"It got super complicated to breathe...and I ended up with my jaw hanging open like an idiotic.\"\n\nBy the time this frantic book comes to a close, I felt like an idiotic myself. I've never heard the terms \"tons of\" and \"super\" used so much. It was, like, super, super frustrating. When Kai bit Isa's earlobe, I could tell heavy panting was about to erupt, and perhaps he would be more than a friend. There.Are.A.Lot.of.Sentences.Like.This. These apparently help out slow readers who are just learning the value of periods.\n\nJanuary 5, 2016\n\nDebbie's Review\n\n4 Mind Boggling Stars!!!!\n\nAfter the way the first book in this series left off I could not wait to get my hands on this book and see what was going to happen. Just like the last book when I got to the end Author Jessica Sorensen left me with so many questions unanswered yet again.\n\nThe story flowed really well and I could not help but fall head over heels for Kai. He is just so sweet and really cares for Isa. Isa just like the last book is a strong main character that has been hurt so many times but just will not let that stop her from living. All the characters in this book kept the story interesting and had me second-guessing some of their motives. You could really feel the chemistry between Kia and Isa. I kept waiting for them to act of their feelings and admit they wanted to be more than just friends.\n\nThis book sort of has a love triangle and I am a huge fan of that. There is just something about Kyler that has me questioning his real motives. He is Kia’s older brother and both of them have feelings for Isa. I don’t really trust Kyler though and the way the book ended I might be on to something.\n\nI absolutely loved Grandma Stephy in this book. I love how nothing gets by her and she is very blunt and direct with what is on her mind. This book has so many twists and turns and left me needing to know what the hell is going on. My only issue is that a few parts felt a little dragged out and I was hoping to get some answers. I know that the author loves to keep you hanging so I am looking forward to the next book and hopefully will get my answers.\n\nJanuary 6, 2016\n\nGah....this is killing me. More and more secrets and twists!\n\nReview:\n\nThis series is torturing me and it’s only book 2!!!!! I love it yet it’s driving me nuts. LOL\n\nOnce again, I finished this book in less than a day. Jessica just sucks me right in and makes me forget about everything else going on around me. I love that I can’ stop thinking about what is going, what could possibly happen and then freaking out all over again. LOL It’s a dirty cycle and I love it!!\n\nJust when I think we are going to get answers, which we do, we have even more questions!! It’s not just the drama with Isa and her damn “family” but it’s the twist and turns surrounding her. The craziness of all the outside nuisances adding more and more tension. And the shit going on between T and Kai. I NEED MORE!!!\n\nJessica does a fabulous job weaving a dramatic and very interwoven story. We are given some more interesting facts and that just adds more to the already intense plot. And Isa is just trying to wrap her brain around everything while trying to finish high school. This girl has some pretty damn strong shoulders and a very level head – cause as an adult, I would be freaking out if I was her.\n\nIf you have not started this series yet, YOU MUST START NOW!! Yes, it’s YA but it’s so damn good. Don’t let the genre fool you. Jessica writes damn good stories and this one is phenomenal and she’s just getting started!!!\n\nI need the next book, like yesterday! Fantastic job Jessica!\n\nDecember 9, 2018\n\nEn este libro, Isa y Kai se centran en conseguir respuestas a todas las preguntas que hay, ¿por qué la mamá de Isa está en la cárcel realmente? ¿Quién es el verdadero culpable? y una muy importante ¿A quién le pertenece el corazón de Isa, a Kyler o a Kai?\n\nReseña completa en http://the-old-bookstore.blogspot.com...\n\nJanuary 7, 2016\n\n**an ARC was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review**\n\nThe Year of Falling in Love was the second book in the Isabella Anders series. While it didn't quite live up to its predecessor, it held its own ground. Picking up where The Year I Became Isabella Anders left off, this book wastes no time to go into further exploration of Kai (and his secrets) along with the budding romance between Isabella and Kai.\n\nThis book introduced a couple of new characters (who might or might not play an important role in later books to come), and I'm fascinated to see how these characters will impact the storyline.\n\nI'm hoping that Isabella's grandma Stephy and her cousin Indigo will have more scenes in the later books, as they were two of the supporting characters that I actually adored. I'm also hoping that Kai will have more scenes as well (especially from his perspective), because his PoV scenes shed light on some scenarios of his home life.\n\nI'm excited for the third book. The ending of this book (and all of the reveals) did not disappoint at all. I didn't expect half of the things that were revealed as the novel progressed, and was very surprised (yet pleased) at how suspenseful this book ended up becoming.\n\n4.25 / 5 stars\n\nJanuary 12, 2016\n\nThis series, like many others, should've been two books instead of three. I like the short format, but this one felt so short and instead of giving us answers it, it just gaves us even MORE questions. At least Isa is starting to see who cares about her (OH KAI!) and wants her to be happy. Especially now that the shit has hit the fan, big time. I do like the mystery aspect, which is something that the other Sorensen's series I read didn't. Plus though we have a sweet romance, Isa's journey of selfdiscovery is the important part. Really appreciate that! ^^\n\nNow if only we had a release date for book 3 :((\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nKai is awesome, and Kyler is a twat. Still waiting for Isa to wake up to that truth. Really enjoying this series.\n\nSeptember 19, 2016\n\nPodría decir que no me gustan las trilogías, o los libros que al final te dejan en un jodido suspenso, pero la verdad es que suelo leer todo lo que cae en mis manos. Esta saga es así, son tres libros y cada que termino uno, termino en un estado de ansiedad y comiéndome las uñas en espera de poner mis manos en el siguiente, jajajajajaja.\n\nComencemos por un pequeño resumen introductorio, Isabella Anders descubrió recientemente que su 'madre' no es realmente su madre sino su madrastra, lo cual no es del todo malo, ya que la mujer es una completa perra que se ha dedicado a arruinar su vida y su autoestima. Ademas en un viaje de autoconocimiento y gracias a su prima y su abuela descubre que puede ser una chica hermosa.\n\nEste libro comienza al final de este viaje, es bueno tambien aclarar que Isa vive justo al lado de 2 chicos calientes, Kyler y Kai, ella ha tenido un enamoramiento platonico por Kyler desde que tiene uso de memoria, y tuvo una especie de amistad con Kai que se rompió durante algún tiempo y retomó recientemente.\n\nAhora bien, Lynn, la madrastra de Isa domina a su padre como a un cachorro, y no se mueve una hoja si ella no lo determina así, y decidió decirle a Isa que su madre esta muerta, lo cual ocasiona una reacción devastadora en ella, y además decide enviarla a un internado en otro estado.\n\nIsa siente que el piso bajo sus pies desaparece, y en medio de este caos es Kai quien le tiende una soga y la mantiene atada a la cordura, Kai ha estado secretamente enamorado de Isa y hará todo cuanto esté a su alcance para darle paz mental y fortalecer su espíritu, él descubre que su madre no solo esta viva, sino que está acusada de asesinato, aunque se deja entrever que al parecer fue inculpada.\n\nEsta historia gira en torno a los ires y venires de una chica a la que su mundo se le ha puesto de cabeza, la madre que no es su madre, la búsqueda de la verdad sobre su verdadera madre, su enamoramiento de toda la vida por un tipo que no le daba ni la hora y de repente se interesa en ella y los sentimientos encontrados por el que siempre considero su amigo pero se está convirtiendo rápidamente en algo más, sentimientos que la sobrepasan por completo. Adicionalmente si a todo este enredo le sumamos los problemas que Kai enfrenta y de los que Isa apenas conoce tangencialmente pero que en cierta manera la afectan hacen de esta historia una lectura rica en matices y hacen que consumas cada página con avidez, siempre a la espera de lo que vendrá, el final como era de esperarse deja la puerta abierta al tercer y último libro, en el que esperó ansiosamente resolver los misterios que aun se me ocultan y apenas he logrado vislumbrar.\n\nJanuary 6, 2016\n\nOkay read..cliffhanger..a filler book for sure.\n\nNothing really happened on this book except she found out her mom was alive and in jail. Just boring storyline. No resolution. Just when it got some sort of answer as who done it, the book ended. I hate reading a storyline where the main characters just kept getting bad things hap p to them. Both Isa and Ma I got kicked out of their homes. Kai gets bitten up. An unknown car follows Isa around like at 60% of the book. Kyler only showed up maybe at 4 pages of the book. This book was too many angst against the main characters where it becomes tiring. I ended up flipping the pages. Wasted money and reading time. I won't be following this series. Book one was better. Don't waste your time on this on.\n\nJanuary 7, 2016\n\n4.5 STARS\n\nLoved it! I adore this series. I, absolutely, love Isa and Kai. And where can I find myself a Grandma Stephy?!?! She's the best! I thought this one was better than the first. I guess because it didn't have all of the characters that I hated in the first in this one much. Questions were answered and more questions were asked. It ends in typical Jessica Sorensen fashion and I can't wait for the next book! I don't think there's long to wait, I need answers!\n\nThis is a Young Adult series so if you like YA, have a young adult, or know one then this series is perfect.\n\nARC given in exchange for an HONEST review\n\nFebruary 7, 2016\n\nwell written and enjoyable but nothing useful really happened. we didnt make much progress from the last book and now we have to wait again to see what happens. feeling a bit disappointed by that.\n\nMarch 19, 2017\n\nI've been reading a lot of different genres of books lately but I'm so glad this was the first book to bring me back to my contemporary obsession! SO MANY SECRETS, SO MANY OSCAR-WORTHY LOVE QUOTES, SUCH CUTE SCENES. GAHHH. i just can't even. It filled my heart, and it made me just love the book. I'm hands down #TeamKai. Like there's no doubt. The fact that she's so much more open with Kai shows that she trusts him more. And trust is the foundation to any good relationship. Plus they are both so crazy protective and jealous of each other, it's clear that they are madly in love. I just wish they would date already. Plus, i think Kai deserves it. He's done so much for Isa and he's always there for her, and his life has been hard enough. Whereas Kyler just wants Isa because he wants to prove to his brother that he's better. He's just a player. IDK. But definitely Team KAi. I'm hoping they will start dating in the next book. I didn't even know this was part of a series I kind of wish they just wrapped it up in one book because I always forget to read the next book and by the time I do, I already forgot most of it. Now, looking at the actual plot. It was intense. Twisted families, dark secrets, and lots of plot twists. It was like the typical mean step mom but then you realize that there's reasons for her to be mean and then you wonder why she accepted Isa in the first place and the dad is so confusing Like he kinda loves Isa but he's also snake IDK. Everyone needs a Grandma Stephy though. She's so cute, just plain adorable. She goes beyond what is expected and I just love her. She's hilarious. I also wonder what happened to Indigo. The fact that she didn't reply to the message is kind of sketchy. So many secrets yet to unfold!!! The plot is a good balance of intense but also sooo cute! I definitely enjoyed this book and there's many aspects to it../ Love, mystery, action. The lines were super cheesy though, which made me love it more!\n\nJanuary 22, 2018\n\nIt’s been a hot minute since I read a Jessica Sorensen novel but she has always been my favorite when it comes to the New Adult genre, so I really didn’t mind returning to this world.\n\nIsabella Anders and Kyler follow the same mold of Sorensen’s other characters. They’re a sweet couple, but they do have their slew of personal, and in this case, family trouble. They happen to seek solace in one another and it’s really an inspiring story to read. I loved how simple the writing is. It makes the more difficult scenes easier to write because the emotions feel that more raw and potent.\n\nWhile this series isn’t my favorite of Sorensen’s, I do think her writing is worth checking out, especially if you like to see how trouble family dynamics. She always comes up with complex and inventive conflicts so there’s really something for everyone to enjoy in this series.\n\n*Reviewed by Annie❤ ♡ Don't want to miss any of our posts?

Hasta ahora tengo series asi 4 ya con esta serían 5 incompletas y que estoy leyendo. Pero luego empiezan como otras autoras a hacer libros donde ya abarcan hasta 15 a 20 libros donde ya no sabe uno donde empezó y donde terminó... y de pasada se olvida uno de los principales personajes ejemplo es de la Familia Ferro, ya no supe ni como ni cuando ni donde y mejor los dejé de leer. Espero que no pase asi con esta serie. Ni como la serie de Abbi Glines ... ya ni recuerdo cual y esta largíííísimaaaaa...\n\nMarch 7, 2019\n\nSo much freaking unanswered questions!!! I have a gazillion questions and if I had to wait for the next book I would bang my head against the wall.\n\nBYE YALL, IM OFF TO READING BOOK 3!!\n\nMay 12, 2019\n\nWonderful second installment! Loved reading the continuation of Isabella's story"
