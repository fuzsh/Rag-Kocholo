        "text": "Interwoven, Inc. (Nasdaq: IWOV), provider of Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solutions for business, today announced that it has acquired Scrittura, the leading provider of document automation technology and straight-through-processing for the complex non-exchange based trading operations of financial services institutions. The strategic acquisition maps to Interwoven's strategy to deliver targeted ECM solutions, and positions Interwoven as the leading ECM provider in the rapidly growing market for the trading of non-exchange based financial instruments. As a result of the acquisition, Interwoven is now the first ECM vendor to offer a complete solution for the automation of Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives trading.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Scrittura shareholders will receive initial cash consideration of approximately $16.3 million and up to $2.0 million of additional cash consideration if certain revenue and operating contribution goals are achieved by December 31, 2005. In addition, Interwoven will assume certain Scrittura stock options in the acquisition. Interwoven preliminarily expects the impact of the acquisition to be dilutive to earnings in the third quarter of 2005, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by approximately $0.03 to $0.06 per share. These GAAP estimates are preliminary and subject to change as the Company completes its allocation of purchase price. On a non-GAAP basis, Interwoven expects the acquisition to result in a $0.00 to $0.02 decrease in non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter. Interwoven expects the acquisition to be neutral to slightly positive to non-GAAP earnings and slightly negative to GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP estimates exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock compensation, a possible charge for in-process research and development and merger integration charges, the amounts of which have not been determined.\n\nThe Interwoven OTC Derivatives solution is the first solution Interwoven is delivering based on the acquisition to address a critical need within the burgeoning market for non-exchange based trading. Interwoven believes a number of factors have contributed to the need for a specific, targeted solution for straight-through-processing of OTC Derivatives confirmation:\n\nMarket Growth—According to The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the OTC derivatives market has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 31 percent since 2001, with a reported value of over $220 trillion at the start of 2005.\n\nTechnology Spend—TowerGroup, a leading financial services industry analyst firm, reports that technology spending for the OTC Derivatives market is expected to reach $1.07 billion by 2006.\n\nTrading Volume—The International Swaps and Dealers Association (ISDA) reports that the average number of weekly trades has risen from 1,975 in 2001 to 3,704 in 2004.\n\nCurrent Solution—ISDA members depend on home grown technology solutions or manual processes to settle complex trades, however, these solutions often fracture under the weight of increased trade volume and the complexity and variety of products being traded.\n\n\"The historic growth statistics of the BIS mask the fact that the growth rate is accelerating and the growth is occurring in increasingly complicated instruments. To put this market into context, the OTC derivatives notional value of $248 trillion dollars is more than 30 times the size of the US mutual fund market,\" said Gavin Little-Gill, director, TowerGroup. \"While the market has grown, it has struggled to integrate the automation necessary to maintain this growth. Many of the proprietary and niche solutions that characterize this market are creaking under the strains that this growth has created. As a result, institutions are looking for more robust third party applications from vendors with the capability to support continued development of those applications. Automation of contract management is top on the list of pain points for both buyers and sellers of these securities and central to efforts to manage the growth of this business. The combination of a market leader in the Enterprise Content Management market and a dominant OTC derivatives platform shows promise in providing a scalable solution to this market.\"\n\nDelivering Industry-Leading ECM Solutions for the Financial Services Market\n\nInterwoven's strategy is to deliver end-to-end ECM solutions designed to address specific business challenges across enterprises and within priority vertical markets such as financial services. Currently, Interwoven provides targeted solutions to capital markets, corporate banking and retail banking operations, with customers such as ABN Amro and Credit Suisse First Boston. With the addition of Scrittura's impressive customer base—including AIG International, Bear Stearns, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Wachovia Bank—Interwoven now has as customers 19 of the top 25 financial services companies on the Financial Times 500 list.\n\n\"Interwoven is focused on bringing to market best-in-class ECM solutions that address specific business challenges across enterprises, and within vertical markets,\" said Martin Brauns, chairman and CEO, Interwoven. \"Interwoven's acquisition of Scrittura not only reinforces this commitment, but adds to our already strong leadership role within the financial services industry. Building on the success Scrittura has already achieved in the OTC Derivatives market, we expect to continue strengthening our existing footprint in the financial services industry by providing additional high-value solutions in the coming months.\"\n\nInterwoven Delivers Industry's First Complete OTC Derivatives Solution\n\nDesigned to enable financial services customers to more quickly and easily conduct complex non-exchange based trades with other financial institutions, the new Interwoven OTC Derivatives solution will provide complete functionality including: business process management; document management; records management; fax and paper capture; and messaging brokering. As a result, financial services customers are expected to be able to reduce the amount of time it takes them to complete a trade from days and weeks, to hours or even minutes.\n\n\"In the last 15 years, Scrittura has marked out a territory in the financial services technology market that no other vendor has been able to successfully enter,\" said John Lewis, CEO, Scrittura. \"The root of our success has been our specialist focus and responsiveness to the exacting demands of a very complex industry, and this focus will continue as we merge with Interwoven. As a result, we expect clients to be able to benefit from a powerful combination of market-leading technologies enabling them to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by the growing popularity of OTC trading.\"\n\nAbout Interwoven\n\nInterwoven, Inc., provider of Enterprise Content Management solutions for business, enables organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total cost of ownership.
