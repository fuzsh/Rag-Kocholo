        "text": "At times, Mike Jaixen feels like he’s drowning in content. The manager of information architecture for transportation giant Union Pacific (UP) was charged with finding a way to manage an ever-growing warehouse of documents on the company’s internal and external Web sites. At last count there were 200,000 pages stored on the company’s servers.\n\nAfter evaluating products from Documentum, Vignette and others, Union Pacific picked an enterprise content-management platform from Interwoven. A big factor was the ability to create easy-to-use templates for UP employees to generate content and have it flow through an automated editing and approval process.\n\n“It really addressed the ability for Joe Q worker, who is an expert in his job but doesn’t know a thing about HTML, to contribute content to the site,” says Jaixen.\n\nLovelace Health Systems, one of the largest hospital groups in New Mexico, found its approval processes were so cumbersome that the organization’s site was only updated on a weekly basis. After deploying Interwoven, the hospital group went to a daily publishing schedule. Matt Berlin, director of Internet operations, estimates the system will eliminate about 180 hours of work per month once staff are fully trained in its use.\n\nInterwoven has been one of Berlin’s favorite vendors to deal with, and his only knock was that there was some confusion in support when a regional sales group was created in Phoenix.\n\nThe state of Massachusetts needed to coordinate content published online by 160 state agencies. Robert Nevins, director of the Mass.gov portal, says Interwoven provided it with a way to develop a standard look for the state’s Web sites, and helped get rid of bottlenecks that had prevented timely publication of information. Now each agency can designate its own content contributors, and customize the work flow procedure for approving and publishing content.\n\nEarly on, the state wasn’t happy with the user interface developed by a third-party integrator. However, Nevins says when Interwoven was notified of the issue, it was resolved. “And since then their support has been very good,” he adds.\n\nInterwoven, Inc.\n\n803 11th Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94089\n\n(408) 774-2000 www.interwoven.com\n\nTicker: IWOV\n\nExchange: NASDAQ\n\nEmployees: 900\n\nMartin Brauns\n\nChairman\n\nJoined company in 1998.
