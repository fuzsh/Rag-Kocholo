        "text": "Yufei Song (he/him)\n\nComputer Engineering\n\nCOLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n\nShanghai, China\n\nWhat's the biggest lesson you've learned during your time at UCSB?\n\nLiving by the sea is incredibly nice and enjoyable. The beach becomes my go-to destination when I don't know where to go. I can either sit and watch the waves during the day or gaze at the stars at night. The connection with nature has been a profound and rewarding experience. Regarding academics, I would say I learned never to hesitate to reach out and ask for help, either to peers or to professors and advisors.\n\nWhat are your future endeavors, and how has UCSB prepared you for them?\n\nI will enter a master's program at UCLA in electrical and computer engineering. I have gained knowledge in software and hardware, covering everything from traditional computer theory to the latest advancements in machine learning. I have developed strong programming skills and a solid understanding of embedded systems. The comprehensive education has equipped me with the technical expertise and problem-solving abilities needed for a successful career.\n\nWhat about your UCSB experience has been special?\n\nBeyond acquiring knowledge, UCSB has enriched my life in numerous ways. The friendships I've made here are priceless, and the memories we've created together are unforgettable. I am grateful for every moment spent on this campus and for the incredible people who have made it feel like home. I won't forget the sun setting over Henley Gate, biking home as the sky turned to fire, the tranquil water of the lagoon, and the sound of waves at Campus Point. I won't forget the bustling library, the energy at the tennis courts and recreation center, and the vibrant atmosphere of Isla Vista.\n\nMarian Walker\n\nEnvironmental Studies\n\nCollege of Letters & Science\n\nCORONA, CA\n\nWhat's your favorite memory from UCSB?\n\nGetting involved in my first research project with Dr. Jennifer King's lab in the Geography Department, alongside The Cheadle Center. As I embarked on this journey, I had little idea of what to anticipate or the extent of what I might accomplish. Little did I know, this would be the start of my involvement in a series of projects that have allowed me to gain a breadth of experience in fieldwork and laboratory procedures as well as present my work to the broader scientific community. The opportunities I’ve had to collaborate with nonprofit organizations such as The Nature Conservancy or Channel Islands Restoration have even further enriched the research experiences I've had at UCSB. I am immensely grateful to my peers, graduate students, and faculty mentors that have supported all of my creative endeavors and the beginnings of my future career.\n\nWhat's the biggest lesson you've learned during your time at UCSB?\n\nEmbrace change. In many ways, pursuing an undergraduate degree is a transformative journey into adulthood. It teaches you not only academic lessons but also how to take care of yourself and when to seek support from those around you. As a first-generation and financially independent student, shouldering the responsibilities of coursework and extracurricular activities while sustaining an income has been a balancing act. Through these experiences, I have honed two invaluable skills: adaptability and communication. Life doesn't slow down, but learning to go with the flow and building a supportive community of friends and UCSB faculty have made all the difference in my journey.\n\nWhat about your UCSB experience has been special?\n\nThe love this community has for each other. Until moving to Santa Barbara, I hadn't experienced a community where I felt so free to explore my interests and embrace my desire to make a positive impact. The way UCSB's students wholeheartedly support one another is truly remarkable. Whether it's spontaneously attending a concert to cheer on a friend's new band, gathering in the late hours of the night at the library with Yerba Mate in hand to group study for an exam, or dedicating time to meaningful social causes, you can always rely on the unwavering presence of the students here to show up for one another. At UCSB, there is an ingrained culture of solidarity and collective support, which I feel so lucky to have been a part of.\n\nÁngela Godoy-Fernández\n\nPh.D. in Education\n\nGevirtz School of Education\n\nSalinas, CA\n\nWhat's your favorite memory from UCSB?\n\nBeing a teaching assistant for SOC170 with Dr. Martinez! I have loved every week that I am working with the students from that course, whether it be about the material itself or mentoring students in their graduate applications. I truly do believe that to be in community is to experience the soul be gravitationally defiant. I have found an abundance of comfort in the community SOC170 has built.\n\nWhat are your future endeavors, and how has UCSB prepared you for them?\n\nI will always be working in the east side of Salinas, the space that has nurtured me and prepared me for my undergraduate and graduate experience. UCSB has connected me to people outside of my limited universe who are also working in similar spaces. I've learned there are multiple ways to connect with people and grow in community. Community is geographical, yes. It's also spiritual — UCSB as a space that has within itself a population of like-minded individuals has prepared me for connecting spiritually to those who may not be in geographical proximity.\n\nWhat about your UCSB experience has been special?\n\nThe undergraduate students! If my kids read this, it has been a privilege to assist you in your academic journey. I go to every graduation I am invited to, and I appreciate every end-of-the-quarter email. Undergrad students get 120% of me, muchas gracias mis pedacitos de cielo!\n\nXochitl Clare\n\nPh.D. in Ecology, Evolution & Marine Biology\n\nDepartment of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology\n\nGlendale, CA\n\nWhat's your favorite memory from UCSB?\n\nMy favorite memories at UCSB have been when I have been able to mentor the next generation of marine scientists. I also have enjoyed sharing my unique cultural lens and disciplinary background in performance — dance, directing & writing — with other conservationists, biologists, social scientists, educators, and artists to protect our blue backyards while at UCSB.\n\nWhat's the biggest lesson you've learned during your time at UCSB?\n\nIt's important to be your \"authentic self\" in academia. As a Latina African American with Caribbean heritage, the importance of life at sea is interwoven in my culture via storytelling. Over the course of my time at UCSB I set forth to explore our underwater world using the combined power of science and performing art while inspiring others to find their own path in marine science during my time at UCSB.\n\nWhat are your future endeavors, and how has UCSB prepared you for them?\n\nMy training at UCSB has helped me become a highly skilled marine scientist with the ability to investigate climate change stressors in an interdisciplinary fashion. I was awarded a three-year Washington Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship to serve as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington in the Padilla-Gamiño Lab. In my next steps, I will use my expertise in eco-physiology and scientific storytelling to understand and mitigate the effects of pollution and ocean warming in Placencia, Belize. My postdoctoral work will be in collaboration with educators and NGOs that are currently advocating for conservation in Belize.\n\nChloe Wang\n\nActuarial Science & Physical Geography\n\nCollege of Letters & Sciences\n\nDalian, Liaoning | China\n\nWhat's the biggest lesson you've learned during your time at UCSB?\n\nThe biggest lesson I have learned during my time here is that every individual possesses unique talents and abilities in their respective fields. Everyone has spark! I used to be proud of myself. However, as I interacted with more students at UCSB, I came to realize the immense talent that exists within our community. The person sitting next to me in class might be a remarkable sports team leader, while someone I encounter in the dining commons might be a gifted pianist hosting their own concerts. The more I acquaint myself with the people around me, the more I appreciate their distinctive abilities, which make them exceptional in their own way. This experience has humbled me and taught me the importance of recognizing and valuing the strengths and merits of each individual. It is an invaluable lesson that I have truly learned during my time at UCSB.\n\nWhat are your future endeavors, and how has UCSB prepared you for them?\n\nI want to become an actuary and I'm currently working towards obtaining the FCAS credential. My journey toward this career path began at UCSB, where I was introduced to the field. From my very first year, I actively engaged with the UCSB Actuarial Association, which provided me with valuable insights into the profession. Over the next four years, I had the privilege of learning from exceptional and knowledgeable faculty members who not only guided me academically but also taught me valuable life lessons about being a diligent student and a well-rounded individual. The support and resources offered by UCSB for actuarial students were truly remarkable, providing me with both financial assistance and academic support, propelling me closer to my dream of becoming an actuary.\n\nWhat about your UCSB experience has been special?\n\nUCSB has been a remarkable place for me to explore my varied interests and satisfy my curiosity across different fields of study. Throughout my five years of study, I have completed a total of over 330 units of coursework, delving into two completely different majors. Additionally, in my final year, I pursued a spatial study minor, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of a wide range of topics in the world. The diversity of classes I have taken is truly impressive, spanning various disciplines. From accounting and art to history, philosophy, environmental studies, and entrepreneurship. I have had the opportunity to engage with a broad array of subjects. One particular aspect that captivated me was the study of different languages. In my last year, I embarked on the journey of learning both French and German, and I am immensely grateful that I made that decision. The experience has enriched my perspective and opened doors to new cultures and possibilities. I am grateful to UCSB for providing me with the platform to explore my passions, expand my knowledge across different fields, and embrace the joy of lifelong learning.\n\nCaroline He\n\nBiology\n\nCollege of Creative Studies\n\nSunnyvale, CA\n\nWhere is your favorite study spot on campus?\n\nMy favorite study spot is at the Arbor! Specifically at a table in the shade of one of the palm trees, with a matcha latte.\n\nWhat's your favorite memory from UCSB?\n\nMy favorite UCSB memory is from my first year, during the fall quarter when you'd still have hot days sometimes. I had a class that ended later in the evening in Buchanan. I remember that I had a test this day, and the class let out about an hour and a half before sunset. I immediately ran to my dorm room in Anacapa, changed into a swimsuit, and rushed to Campus Point to get a paddle board from the adventure program people. A couple of my friends were there already, so I was paddle boarding with my friends in the ocean during golden hour. I remember being offshore and looking at the cliffs, then turning around and looking at the Channel Islands and thinking that there was no way this was real. It was just so beautiful.\n\nWWhat are your future endeavors, and how has UCSB prepared you for them?\n\nI'm beginning my Ph.D. in neuroscience at UC Berkeley this fall, and I want to ultimately be a research scientist who studies aging and neurodegeneration. I feel like spending the last four years here at UCSB, and in CCS, has prepared me for this better than any other university could have. I was able to begin my career as an undergraduate researcher in my first year, and I found a group of incredible and diverse mentors among the faculty members, graduate students, and staff here. I also found a larger community of undergraduate researchers on campus, which prepared me to engage with the scientific community as peers.\n\nLiam Dow\n\nPh.D. in Biophysics and Bioengineering\n\nCollege of Engineering\n\nWest Newbury, MA\n\nWhere is your favorite study spot on campus?\n\nMy desk, underneath a framed print of the epithelial cells that I study!\n\nWhat's the biggest lesson you've learned during your time at UCSB?\n\nSince being at UCSB, the biggest lesson I've learned has been how to communicate with others. We can't assume we know how people are thinking and feeling. It's just as important to let others know how we are thinking and feeling. This is especially true when working in collaborative environments. I believe most problems can be mitigated by communicating more effectively. However, communicating effectively doesn't necessarily mean writing out more words or sending emails more often. Some people learn better visually or through analogies.\n\nWhat are your future endeavors, and how has UCSB prepared you for them?\n\nAfter I earn my Ph.D., I'm excited to be a part of research and development in the biotech industry. My research has taught me how to problem solve effectively in the face of technical challenges or interpersonal challenges. I'm excited to bring these skills to a team environment and learn new skills as well!"
