Advent in Zagreb 2023 officially kicked off on the 2nd of this month. However, there was snowfall in the perfect time.

Advent in Zagreb received vote as Europe’s Best Christmas Market for three consecutive years in- 2016, 2017 and 2018.

While all that is well and good. The festive atmosphere that adorns Zagreb at this time of year is absolutely beautiful.

There’s something that only nature can do to really make it feel like Christmas, and that’s snow.

This year, it was a surprise to many people in Zagreb to be able to get a glimpse through the city’s characteristic thick fog and notice what first appeared to be rain falling.

As temperatures dramatically fell this weekend it turned out that it was in reality snow.

This sleet-like snow that fell from the sky did temporarily turn the ground a soft white.

It was light and unable to really settle.

It fell at the perfect time as Advent in Zagreb 2023 opened in various locations across the city.

As previously touched on, Advent in Zagreb received high applause beating the likes of festive classics like Switzerland, Germany and Austria.

The crowds have since been flocking to the Croatian capital. It is a rather unlikely “target” for any sort of tourism at this time of year until recently – from all over Europe and indeed the rest of the world.

Advent in Zagreb 2023 received high amount of praise before it even opened for this festive season.

Despite the fact that they are only a mere two days into the festive cheer they can 100% say that it is well worth every effort and expectation.
