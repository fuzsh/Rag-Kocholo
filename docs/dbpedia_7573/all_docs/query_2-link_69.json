        "text": "A few weeks ago, I took you on a trip through the beautiful coastal towns of Croatia that are stabbed like pearls on the Adriatic Sea. You felt the spirit of the Mediterranean warm summer nights, beautiful beaches and islands, feasting on wine and fish specialties. Now you will meet the capital city of ‘our beautiful’ (as the Croats proudly called their country) in a completely different guise, covered with snow and in New Year’s euphoria.\n\nZagreb is located in the northwest of Croatia and has a rich historical background, namely the city dates back to the Roman period, and is now one of the most beautiful metropolises in Europe.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of this special city at Christmas that you must experience if here in December.\n\nZagreb Christmas Market\n\nZagreb Advent is known as one of the most beautiful Christmas markets – some may even claim that it is the MOST beautiful in all of Europe. Advent in Zagreb won the European Best Christmas Destination award three times in a row. Amazing atmosphere, energy, cheerful people, full squares, hospitality as well as delicious food will surely leave a mark on you – as it has for so many locals and travelers alike.\n\nThe kitchen at Zagreb's Advent market is very diverse and you have you stopping at every corner to see what is simmering.\n\nThe unavoidable dish of every table are gourmet sausages with various toppings. Most stands offer traditional food, such as sarna with mashed potatoes (cabbage rolls with minced meat), soparnik (swiss chard, garlic and olive oil in a phyllo crust pie), fritule (like a croatian donut), etc.\n\nThe squares are the heart and soul of every city. Squares are places where you can feel the life of the city. Ban Jelacic Square makes you feel as if you are home—you belong there and just can't get enough of the this place. Especially in these winter days, the square is crowded, excitement and joy are almost palpable in the air.\n\nThere is a constant stream of events here as well, from numerous performances, beautiful square decor, ice skating, houses with mulled wine and many delicious dishes, etc. Not even frozen fingers and a red nose will drive you away from this kind of fun! In the square there are numerous cafes and restaurants where you can continue to enjoy until late at night.\n\nOn the square, there is a fountain called Manduševac which is also one of the symbols of the city. An interesting fact about this fountain is according to court records related to the persecution of witches in the Middle Ages, this fountain is mentioned as their main meeting place.\n\nIlica Street\n\nJarun is a famous street in Zagreb where—believe it or not, there is a lake! in the middle of the city, this is a paradise where you can walk, ride a bike, or just relax looking at the water without moving far away from the city. The locals are especially proud of this lake and call it the 'Zagreb Sea'.\n\nThe lake consists of a large and small lake. On summer days, it is the perfect place to freshen up, swim or kayak. But during this time of year, the lake is frozen and feels very winter-wonderland-esque.\n\nMuseum of Broken Relationships\n\nA little known fact is that Zagreb is also called the city of museums. The Telegraph's list of amazing museums to visit before you die recommended the Zagreb Museum of Broken Relationships (which is so successful that it now has a sister museum that opened up in Los Angeles)!\n\nThe Museum of Broken Relationships can often be heard to be one of the most unusual and popular spots in the city, especially among foreign tourists. It is one of the few private museums and the winner of the Kenneth Hudson Award for the most innovative European museum.\n\nIt is a place created for one purpose - to preserve objects, memories and reminders of connections and to share stories of broken connections. This is a museum about all of us and our emotions, about the ways we love and lose. Also, and perhaps most importantly, a visit here can act as a reminder of our former relationships – reflecting on how they impacted us as individuals and pushed us forward in our lives.\n\nFlower Square\n\nThis cathedral is a truly amazing sight. It is the largest Croatian sacral building and one of the most valuable monuments of Croatian cultural heritage. It is the first and most important Gothic building in Croatia. It was 105 meters high until the earthquake and the demolition of the towers (now it is 92 meters high).\n\nIt is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The first forms of the cathedral were built as early as the 11th century, after which it was demolished several times in numerous expeditions and rebuilt again.The original cathedral was destroyed in a great fire in the 19th century after which it was completely rebuilt. the first forms of the cathedral were built as early as the 11th century, after which it was demolished several times in numerous expeditions and rebuilt again.\n\nCastle Luznica\n\nAbout twenty kilometers from Zagreb, there is a fairytale castle Luznica, in the Baroque style from the 18th century. IT is surrounded by picturesque greenery, a large English park, lake, woods and long promenades. In the winter, it is snow-capped and will have you feeling like a princess for a day!\n\nThe castle has changed owners numerous times over the decades. And the current owners are nuns. They maintain the gardens themselves with a lot of effort and love, & their table is always rich in organic food which they also produce themselves.\n\nThe nuns bought the castle in order to provide accommodations for retired nuns who had nowhere to go. In addition, they also set up a kindergarten, school, hospital and chapel within the castle. Their work paid off, because they received a prestigious award from the Association of Croatian Travel Agencies for their great contribution to the community.\n\nMedvednica Mountain"
