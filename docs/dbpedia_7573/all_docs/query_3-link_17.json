        "text": "Close your eyes and think of Croatia. You’re seeing medieval coastal cities, aren’t you? As glorious as Croatia’s coastline truly is, there’s more to Croatia and Dubrovnik and Split. Venture inland and experience a different side of the country in its capital city, Zagreb.\n\nGrand squares, a charming walled old town, and breathtaking nineteenth-century architecture await you. Unlike much of the coast, Zagreb reflects Austro-Hungarian influences. It moves faster. Zagreb boasts a world-class café culture, vibrant festivals, and a very cool street-art scene. Oh, and the cutest funicular you’ll ever ride.\n\nI spent a month in Zagreb, at the end of a three-month trip in the region, and I grew to love this city because it was so different from the coast. I’d missed “real” city life, and, while Zagreb still retains a bit of a town feel, it’s definitely buzzier than life on the coast.\n\nZagreb is recovering from a big earthquake in 2020, so there’s construction, but what city isn’t undergoing some kind of construction project or another?\n\nZagreb has so much to offer that it’s hard to narrow down a few highlights. One of my favorite things to do was just go exploring, taking one of Upper Town’s staircases and seeing where it led me. And then sitting in a café for hours. And then finding some street art, or discovering a bit about Zagreb’s creepy side. Or ducking into one of the city’s unique museums. It’s a cool place, you’ll find.\n\nFrom antique markets on a Sunday morning to the daily bustle of the Dolac public market, Zagreb boasts some great open-air markets. I lucked out and was in the city for Advent Zagreb, and, if you haven’t been to a European Christmas market before, they are not to be missed.\n\nIf coastal Croatia is known for its Mediterranean food, Zagreb is known for heartier fare. Don’t miss trying štruckli, a delicious dish of cheese and dough that comes to you piping hot and glorious, or Zagrebački odrezak, a cutlet with cheese that’s breaded and fried. In other words, wear loose-fitting clothing.\n\nThe Dolac market is perfect for fresh produce, with farmers and producers from all over the region filling the stalls every day except for Sunday (Saturday is the best day).\n\nZagreb’s café culture is one of Europe’s best, and the city is also known for its craft beer.\n\nZagreb is a great city for walking and supported by public transport if you found that you walked so far that you’re tired out. Getting up to Upper Town is a steep hill, but otherwise, it’s pretty flat. There are pedestrian zones that invite you to stroll at leisure.\n\nAs with the rest of Croatia, drivers are aggressive, so take care when crossing streets. In Upper Town, drivers whip through the tiny streets, and you’ll want to pay attention!\n\nZagreb’s tourism board indicates that it is working toward becoming more accessible, but it acknowledges that it is not there yet. Public transport is accessible. As with other European old towns, not everyplace is wheelchair friendly, and there are a lot of stairs and uneven surfaces. However, there is more accommodation in Zagreb than in other Croatian cities I visited.\n\nThe link includes attractions that can accommodate wheelchairs, but, as they have also advised, I would suggest visiting a website or getting in touch before going.\n\nYou can buy metro tickets at a Tisak (tobacco stand). You can buy multi-day tickets, but one-way fares are so cheap that I found it easier to just buy one when I needed it.\n\nNote that to validate your ticket, you will need to enter by the first car and get it stamped. The other doors have transport card readers, which you likely wouldn’t have as a tourist. I never saw one, but there are inspectors, and, should you get caught, you can get a hefty fine. Generally, taking the bus can be a bit tricky if you don’t know where you’re going.\n\nUber runs in Zagreb, as does Wolt. I used it instead of taking the bus but took the tram lines at other times.\n\nAs of January 2023, Croatia is part of the Schengen Zone, meaning that stays in the country now count toward the 90-day limit for those visiting from outside the Zone.\n\nWhen the ETIAS system rolls out (now expected mid-2025), travelers from the US will need to comply. Croatia has a visa that allows qualifying digital nomads to stay in Croatia for up to a year.\n\nNOTE: Hotels and short-term rental hosts are required by law to register your presence. They will ask you for your passport in order to do this. If your hotel or host does not do this, ask about it, because it may not be a legal rental. Staying in an unregistered place could land you in some trouble when leaving the country. You can now register yourself. See the official information by clicking the link."
