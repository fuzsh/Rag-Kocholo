        "text": "Croatia is a beautiful and diverse country. In recent years it has become one of the most popular countries among students looking to study abroad. And it's easy to understand why. Located in between western and eastern worlds, Croatia presents a wonderful mix of cultures. Throughout the country, you will find amazing food, breathtaking landscapes and wonderful historic architecture.\n\nWhether you are just visiting or considering studying abroad in Croatia, you will feel safe. Croatia is widely considered to be one of the safest countries in the world. According to the 2023 Global Peace Index rankings, Croatia ranks 14th out of 163 countries. Tourism is the strongest force within the Croatian economy, which means that the country is not only extremely beautiful but that you will have no problems communicating. According to the EF English Proficiency Index, Croatia is in the world’s Top 15 countries with high proficiency.\n\nCroatia has one of the most stunning coastlines in Europe. Its geographical location means you can experience totally different climates, cultures and lifestyles in the space of a few hours – you could swim in the sea in the warm sunshine in one moment and hike on snow-covered mountain tops on the same day.\n\nMany Croatian innovators and scientists are known outside Croatia, such as Nikola Tesla, Slavoljub Penkala, or Franjo Hanaman. Also, a large number of lesser-known innovators receive awards and medals at various world innovation fairs each year. Every year, The Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development is investing more and more money in new patents in Croatia. One of the best examples of success in Croatia is Mate Rimac, an entrepreneur and founder of the Croatian car company Rimac Automobili."
