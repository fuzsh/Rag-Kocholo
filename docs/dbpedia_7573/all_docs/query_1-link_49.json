We use Safety Wing and highly recommend it. With insurance designed for frequent travelers and digital nomads, it ticks all the right boxes. ✔\n\nIn our opinion, Zagreb is absolutely worth visiting! Zagreb is Croatia’s principal city, so as you can imagine, there is a lot going on there.\n\nIt’s the perfect size city for a short break, as you feel you can really see everything in a few days. It’s got a great mix of pretty buildings, culture, and buzz plus some interesting things to do nearby if you wanted to stay for longer.\n\nBut we do recognise that Zagreb might not be for everyone.\n\nWe’ve put together our top reasons you should visit, but we’ve also included some of the things that might put people off booking Zagreb for a holiday. You’ll just have to weigh up what it is you’re after before booking that trip!\n\nReasons To Visit Zagreb\n\nThere are several compelling reasons to visit Zagreb, the capital city of Croatia. Here are some of the key attractions and features that we think make Zagreb an appealing destination.\n\nHistoric and Cultural Heritage\n\nZagreb boasts a rich history and a well-preserved old town that dates back to medieval times. The Upper Town (Gornji Grad) is particularly charming with its cobblestone streets, medieval architecture, and landmarks like St. Mark’s Church and the Lotrščak Tower.\n\nThe Lower Town (Donji Grad) is characterized by elegant 19th-century architecture, vibrant squares, and cultural institutions.\n\nWe loved the older part of the city best as it was full of charm, but that doesn’t mean the newer side didn’t have anything to offer! It’s definitely worth exploring both areas.\n\nOne of the best ways to see all the main sites is by walking tour. We always start city breaks with a walking tour as you learn so much about the city you’re about to explore.\n\nWe would recommend you book a small group tour for Zagreb as the traffic can be quite loud in places and it’s much easier to get close to the guide when there’s only a few of you, or ask for information to be repeated if you don’t catch it.\n\nIf you visit in the winter then make sure you wrap up nice and warm! And don’t forget to budget a little extra – tipping is polite in Croatia.\n\n✔ Book a small group walking tour here\n\nBeautiful Architecture\n\nZagreb showcases a blend of architectural styles, including Austro-Hungarian, Gothic, Baroque, and Art Nouveau.\n\nThe city’s impressive buildings include the Croatian National Theatre, the stunning Cathedral of Zagreb, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, among others.\n\nWe absolutely loved taking in all the different buildings on a bike tour. This was such a fun way to see the city and a little different from the usual walking tours we go on.\n\nYou get to take in a lot more than you do from just walking and it’s quite exciting to be riding a bike around a new city (with someone who knows where they’re going!)\n\n✔ Book a bike tour of Zagreb\n\nRecent History\n\nCroatia doesn’t just have ancient history to marvel at, it also has more recent history that is fascinating and well worth learning about while you’re here.\n\nOne of the most popular and best tours in Zagreb is this historical walking tour which will teach you all about the city’s experiences of World War II, Yugoslavia and communism under Tito, and the war in the 1990’s. You’ll visit WWII-era tunnels and see a multimedia exhibition about war.\n\nHaving a tour like this with a local is a real highlight. You can see how much the history really means to them and how the Croatians have been affected, even today. We highly recommend it.\n\n✔ Book the history walking tour here\n\nMuseums and Galleries\n\nZagreb is home to numerous museums and galleries that cater to various interests. This means it’s the perfect city to visit when the weather isn’t ideal, as you will still have plenty of things to do that are based indoors.\n\nThe Museum of Broken Relationships, the Mimara Museum, and the Zagreb City Museum are just a few examples that offer unique and engaging exhibits.\n\nLively Street Life\n\nThe streets of Zagreb are vibrant and full of life, especially in the city center. You could spend a whole day just wandering around and soaking in the atmosphere (if your legs didn’t tempt you into a cafe first!)\n\nThe Ban Jelačić Square is a bustling hub, lined with shops, cafes, and street performers. Tkalčićeva Street is a popular pedestrianized area known for its charming cafes, restaurants, and boutiques.\n\nZagreb felt like a safe place to wander around (in fact, Croatia in general felt very safe) and we enjoyed exploring at night too, though we did stick to tourist areas that were well lit just to be on the safe side. It is a city after all!\n\nParks and Green Spaces\n\nDespite being a bustling capital city, Zagreb offers plenty of green spaces for relaxation and recreation.\n\nThe city’s largest park, Maksimir Park, features beautiful lakes, walking trails, and a zoo which is great for kids.\n\nJarun Lake is another popular spot, offering opportunities for water sports, cycling, and picnics.\n\nFood and Drink\n\nZagreb has a burgeoning culinary scene, with a wide range of restaurants, cafes, and bars to suit different tastes. You can savor traditional Croatian cuisine, as well as international dishes. Don’t forget to try local specialties like štrukli (pastry filled with cheese) and šljivovica (plum brandy).\n\nIf you have time it’s totally worth going on a food tasting tour of Zagreb. On this popular tour you get to visit different restaurants and eateries in town (the local ones you won’t find on your own!) and you learn all about the food from different regions. Obviously you’ll also need several glasses of wine to wash it down!\n\nWe were stuffed by the end so just make sure you don’t eat beforehand!\n\n✔ Book the best food tour of Zagreb here\n\nAdvent and Christmas Markets\n\nZagreb is known for its enchanting Advent and Christmas markets, which have gained international recognition. During the winter season, the city transforms into a winter wonderland with festive decorations, ice skating rinks, delicious food stalls, and live music.\n\nYou might also be surprised to hear it snows in Zagreb, making it feel extra seasonal!\n\nWe’ve included more on this below, as the Christmas markets are a huge reason people visit Zagreb.\n\nDay Trips\n\nZagreb serves as a convenient base for exploring other parts of Croatia. You can take day trips to nearby destinations like Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its cascading lakes and waterfalls, or the historic town of Samobor, famous for its picturesque streets and traditional crafts.\n\nHere are some of the best day trips to take from Zagreb.\n\nPlitvice Lakes National Park\n\nBook a trip to Plitvice if you do nothing else! This isn’t just one of the best things to do from Zagreb, it’s one of the best things to do in the whole of Croatia. In fact, we based our trip around visiting the lakes when we first visited Croatia and it was a real highlight.\n\nThe park is absolutely huge, and leads you around to see a huge number of impressive waterfalls and pretty lake views. Pack a picnic and spend the whole day exploring. It’s a truly incredible place.\n\nThe best way to get here from Zagreb is with a tour that will take you straight to the park and includes entrance.\n\n✔ Book the trip to see Plitvice lakes\n\nLjubljana and Bled Lake\n\nThis is pretty cool because you get to fit in another country on your trip away. Ljubljana and Bled in Slovenia are two of the country’s most famous places, and you can see them both on a little day trip.\n\nYou’ll get to explore Ljubljana’s old city center, Ljubljanica River’s Triple Bridge, Bled Castle, and Lake Bled. The price includes a tour guide for the cities so you really make the most of your short time there.\n\nJust don’t forget to pack your passport!\n\n✔ Book a trip to Slovenia here!\n\nThese are just some of the reasons why Zagreb is worth a visit. The city offers a blend of history, culture, and modern amenities that cater to a wide range of interests, making it an appealing destination for travelers.\n\nReasons Not To Visit Zagreb\n\nWhile Zagreb has many attractions and qualities that make it an appealing destination, it’s important to consider different perspectives. Here are a few reasons why someone might choose not to visit Zagreb.\n\nLimited Natural Beauty\n\nCompared to some other Croatian destinations, Zagreb may not offer the same level of natural beauty. While the city has parks and green spaces, it lacks the stunning coastal landscapes and pristine beaches that draw many visitors to Croatia.\n\nWe liked the contrast, but then we did get a taste of both. If you’re only here for a short time and are desperate for those sea views then you might be better off heading to Dubrovnik.\n\nSmaller Tourist Infrastructure\n\nZagreb, while the capital city of Croatia, may not have the same level of tourist infrastructure and amenities as more popular tourist destinations in the country. This can mean fewer English-speaking locals and a slightly less developed tourist infrastructure.\n\nWe didn’t find this much of a problem, but then we did a lot of English speaking tours and did stick mostly to the tourist areas.\n\nLack of Major Tourist Attractions\n\nWhile Zagreb has its share of historic and cultural attractions, it may not have the same concentration of iconic landmarks and world-famous sites as some other European cities.\n\nVisitors seeking a city with a wealth of famous landmarks and attractions might find other European destinations more appealing.\n\nClimate\n\nZagreb experiences cold winters with occasional snowfall, which might not be ideal for travelers who prefer milder or warmer climates. If you’re seeking a sun-soaked vacation or outdoor activities that are better suited for warmer weather, Zagreb may not be the best choice.\n\nLess Cosmopolitan Atmosphere\n\nZagreb, while a vibrant city, might not have the same cosmopolitan or international atmosphere as some other European capitals. It may not offer the same level of diversity in terms of international cuisines, cultural events, or expat communities.\n\nIt’s important to note that these points are not intended to discourage visitors from considering Zagreb as a destination, but rather to provide a balanced view and cater to individual preferences.\n\nUltimately, whether or not to visit Zagreb depends on personal interests, preferences, and the type of travel experience you’re seeking.\n\nIs Zagreb Worth Visiting In Winter?\n\nYes, Zagreb is definitely worth visiting in winter! In fact, the city is renowned for its festive atmosphere and enchanting Advent and Christmas markets, which draw visitors from around the world.\n\nZagreb’s Advent season is particularly special, with the city transforming into a magical winter wonderland. The main square, Ban Jelačić Square, and other locations throughout the city are adorned with festive decorations, lights, and Christmas trees.\n\nThe Christmas markets offer a variety of food stalls selling traditional Croatian delicacies, mulled wine, roasted chestnuts, and sweets. You can also find handmade crafts, unique gifts, and enjoy live music performances, creating a joyful and festive ambiance.\n\nDuring the winter months, several ice skating rinks are set up in Zagreb, including one at King Tomislav Square. Skating under the lights and surrounded by the city’s beautiful architecture is a wonderful experience for locals and visitors alike.\n\nZagreb’s charming streets, with their cobblestones and historic buildings, take on a cozy atmosphere during winter. Cafes and restaurants offer warm and inviting spaces to enjoy a cup of coffee, hot chocolate, or traditional Croatian cuisine.\n\nThe city’s parks, such as Maksimir Park, are still enjoyable in winter and can be great for a walk or a peaceful retreat.\n\nWinter in Zagreb is not just about Christmas markets. The city also hosts a variety of cultural events during this season. You can enjoy concerts, theater performances, art exhibitions, and film screenings.\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art and other cultural institutions often have special winter-themed exhibitions.\n\nZagreb’s location makes it a great base for day trips to nearby winter destinations. You can visit the stunning Plitvice Lakes National Park, which turns into a winter wonderland with frozen waterfalls and glistening lakes.\n\nYou can also go skiing in the nearby Medvednica mountain range, which offers slopes for different skill levels.\n\nYou should bear in mind that typically people see Croatia as a summer destination due to the beautiful islands here, so if you wanted a longer trip to Croatia then winter might not be the best time to visit. But for a city break just to Zagreb it’s the perfect time of year!\n\nOverall, visiting Zagreb in winter provides a unique and memorable experience, with its festive atmosphere, cultural events, and opportunities for winter activities. The city’s charm, combined with its seasonal offerings, make it a worthwhile destination to explore during the colder months.\n\nConsidering exploring Europe in December? Extend your trip and check out some of the other firm favourites at the same time.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWe’ve got answers to some of your most asked questions!\n\nHow Many Days Should I Spend In Zagreb?\n\nThe ideal number of days to spend in Zagreb depends on your interests, the pace of your travel, and the activities you plan to engage in.\n\nWhile some travelers might prefer a shorter visit to explore the highlights of the city, others may want to delve deeper into its cultural offerings and experience a more leisurely stay.\n\nHere are a few considerations to help you determine the duration of your stay in Zagreb:\n\nCity Highlights: If you’re mainly interested in visiting the major attractions, exploring the historic districts, and experiencing the vibrant street life, a stay of 2 to 3 days can provide ample time to cover the city’s highlights. This duration would allow you to visit landmarks like the Cathedral of Zagreb, St. Mark’s Church, the Croatian National Theatre, and explore the charming streets of the Upper Town and Lower Town.\n\nMuseums and Cultural Experiences: If you have a particular interest in museums, galleries, and cultural institutions, you might want to allocate extra time to fully immerse yourself in Zagreb’s cultural offerings. The city has a variety of museums to explore, such as the Museum of Broken Relationships, the Mimara Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Adding an additional day or two to your visit can allow for a more in-depth exploration of these attractions.\n\nSeasonal Events and Festivals: Consider any seasonal events or festivals taking place during your visit. Zagreb’s Advent and Christmas markets, for example, are a major draw and can add a festive atmosphere to your trip. If you plan to attend specific events or festivals, ensure you have enough time to fully enjoy the festivities.\n\nDay Trips: Zagreb’s central location makes it an excellent base for day trips to nearby destinations, such as Plitvice Lakes National Park (which we would highly recommend). If you intend to explore the surrounding areas, you may need to allocate an additional day or two for these excursions.\n\nConsidering these factors, a stay of 3 to 5 days is generally a good starting point for experiencing Zagreb.\n\nThis timeframe allows you to explore the city’s highlights, visit museums and galleries, and even include a day trip or two.\n\nWhich Is Nicer, Dubrovnik Or Zagreb?\n\nComparing the cities of Dubrovnik and Zagreb is subjective, as they offer distinct experiences and cater to different interests. Here’s a comparison of some key aspects of both cities.\n\nHistorical and Architectural Beauty\n\nDubrovnik: Dubrovnik is renowned for its stunning medieval walls, limestone streets, and well-preserved Old Town. The city’s historic charm and picturesque coastal location make it a favorite among visitors.\n\nZagreb: Zagreb also has its share of historical and architectural beauty, with a blend of styles ranging from medieval to modern. The Upper Town’s medieval streets and landmarks, combined with the elegant 19th-century buildings of the Lower Town, offer a unique charm.\n\nNatural Setting and Scenic Beauty\n\nDubrovnik: Located on Croatia’s Adriatic coast, Dubrovnik boasts breathtaking views of the sea, surrounding islands, and rugged cliffs. The city’s coastal location provides opportunities for scenic boat trips and beachside relaxation. Some of the best hotels in Dubrovnik are next to the sea.\n\nZagreb: While Zagreb is not situated on the coast, it has its own appeal with parks, green spaces, and nearby mountains. Parks like Maksimir Park offer pleasant settings for walks, and Zagreb’s proximity to nature allows for day trips to scenic areas.\n\nTourist Crowds and Atmosphere\n\nDubrovnik: Dubrovnik is a highly popular tourist destination, particularly during the summer season. The narrow streets of the Old Town can become crowded with tourists, especially when cruise ships dock at the port.\n\nZagreb: Zagreb, while still attracting visitors, generally has a more relaxed atmosphere compared to Dubrovnik. It offers a mix of vibrant street life, cultural events, and a lively local scene that may be appealing to those seeking a less crowded and more laid-back experience.\n\nCultural Offerings\n\nDubrovnik: Dubrovnik offers a rich cultural heritage, including historical sites, museums, and an annual Summer Festival featuring various artistic performances, including theater, music, and dance.\n\nZagreb: Zagreb is the cultural capital of Croatia, with numerous museums, galleries, theaters, and a vibrant music scene. The city hosts various cultural events throughout the year, including festivals, exhibitions, and concerts.\n\nUltimately, whether Dubrovnik or Zagreb is “nicer” depends on personal preferences. Dubrovnik’s coastal beauty and medieval charm make it a captivating destination, especially for those seeking a picturesque seaside experience.\n\nOn the other hand, Zagreb’s blend of history, cultural richness, and its role as Croatia’s capital offer a different kind of appeal. Plus we loved being able to visit Plitvice from here.\n\nIt’s worth considering your interests, desired atmosphere, and the type of experience you seek when choosing between these two cities.\n\nIs Zagreb A Good Place For A City Break?\n\nYes, Zagreb is an excellent destination for a city break. The city offers a mix of history, culture, vibrant street life, and various attractions that make it well-suited for a short getaway.\n\nHere are the reasons we recommend Zagreb as a city break destination.\n\nCompact and Walkable: Zagreb’s city center is compact and easily navigable on foot (or bike!), making it convenient for exploring its main attractions within a short period. Many of the city’s key landmarks, museums, and shopping areas are located in close proximity, allowing you to make the most of your time.\n\nRich History and Architecture: Zagreb’s historic areas, including the Upper Town and the Lower Town, are filled with beautiful architecture from various periods, such as Medieval, Baroque, and Art Nouveau. The city’s well-preserved buildings, churches, and squares provide a captivating backdrop for exploration and sightseeing.\n\nCultural Offerings: As the cultural capital of Croatia, Zagreb has a vibrant arts scene with numerous museums, galleries, theaters, and music venues. You can immerse yourself in the city’s cultural richness by visiting museums like the Museum of Contemporary Art, exploring art galleries, attending a performance at the Croatian National Theatre, or experiencing live music in one of the city’s many bars and clubs.\n\nLively Street Life: Zagreb offers a bustling street life, particularly in the city center. The main square, Ban Jelačić Square, is a vibrant hub with shops, cafes, and street performers. Tkalčićeva Street is a popular pedestrianized area known for its charming cafes, restaurants, and boutiques. Exploring the lively streets and soaking up the local atmosphere can be a delightful part of your city break.\n\nCulinary Delights: Zagreb’s food scene is diverse and evolving, offering a range of culinary delights to indulge in during your city break. From traditional Croatian cuisine to international flavors, you’ll find a variety of restaurants, cafes, and street food stalls to satisfy your taste buds. Don’t miss the opportunity to try local specialties like štrukli (pastry filled with cheese) and Zagreb’s famous street food, the “šiš-ćevap.”\n\nParks and Green Spaces: Despite being a capital city, Zagreb provides ample green spaces and parks where you can relax and unwind. Maksimir Park, the city’s largest park, is perfect for a leisurely stroll, enjoying nature, or even visiting the Zagreb Zoo. Jarun Lake is another popular spot, offering opportunities for outdoor activities like walking, cycling, and enjoying water sports.\n\nThese factors contribute to Zagreb’s appeal as an ideal destination for a city break. Whether you have a few days or a long weekend, you can experience the city’s highlights, soak up its culture, and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere that Zagreb has to offer.\n\nConclusion: Is Zagreb Worth Visiting?\n\nYes, Zagreb is definitely worth visiting.
