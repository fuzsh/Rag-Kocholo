        "text": "December the 4th, 2023 – Advent in Zagreb 2023 officially kicked off on the 2nd of this month, and the snow’s arrival, however light, was perfectly timed.\n\nAdvent in Zagreb was voted Europe’s Best Christmas Market for three consecutive years (in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to be more precise). While all that is well and good, and the festive atmosphere that adorns Zagreb at this time of year is absolutely beautiful – there’s something that only nature can do to really make it feel like Christmas, and that’s snow.\n\nThis year, many of us here in Zagreb were surprised to able to get a glimpse through the city’s characteristic thick fog to notice what first appeared to be rain falling. As temperatures dramatically fell this weekend, it turned out that that “rain” was in actual fact snow.\n\nThough light and unable to really settle, this sleet-like snow that fell from the sky did temporarily turn the ground a soft white, and it fell at the perfect time as Advent in Zagreb 2023 opened in various locations across the city.\n\nAs previously touched on, Advent in Zagreb was highly awarded, beating the likes of festive classics like Switzerland, Germany and Austria. The crowds have since been flocking to the Croatian capital – a rather unlikely “target” for any sort of tourism at this time of year until recently – from all over Europe and indeed the rest of the world.\n\nAdvent in Zagreb 2023 was being showered in praise before it even opened for this festive season, and despite the fact that we’re only a mere two days into the festive cheer – we can 100% say that it’s deserved.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
