        "text": "Originally Posted by nei\n\nA very similar climate has been rated: New Suffolk (which is actually my hometown in a semi-fake name). Except New Suffolk has 2500 hours of sun a year not 1913 hours. Zagreb seems to change to spring (Feb and March are warmer) a bit quicker than New Suffolk but autumn comes quicker (Oct-Dec are quite a bit colder). My hometown gets about 35% more precipitation and 30% more sun. Would you give my hometown an A, too?\n\nhttps://www.city-data.com/forum/weath...w-suffolk.html\n\nThe winters are still rather chilly in Zagreb, but cloudier than New Suffolk. To still get a B with extra cloudiness, it would need milder winters. I gave New Suffolk a B, so Zagreb gets a C. Nothing that bad about its climate, just not all that great.\n\nOriginally Posted by ben86\n\nI didn't actually look at your thread first time round as I thought it was a fake climate but I've given it a B. I personally prefer Zagreb as though the extremes are more extreme I think the day-to-day temperature variation is less - Long Island would have more uncomfortably cold/hot/humid days than I'd prefer. It might sounds strange but for me your area actually gets too much sun - winters to me are supposed to be mostly cloudy and a bit depressing (though preferably not as bad as what we've just had here), else how else can you fully appreciate sunny days in the rest of the year?\n\nWhat I like about Zagreb's climate is that basically it's an \"optimum\" version of what I'm already used to. Your climate would be too unfamiliar at first.\n\nOriginally Posted by nei\n\nGrowing up, I never thought of one season as a cloudy season or a sunny season. One appreciate the rest of the year for its warmth not it sun. Though my hometown is cloudier in the winter as you could tell by the numbers, but if you don't pay attention to the weather it's not extremely noticeable.\n\nI still think Long Island and Zagreb look very similar temperature wise except maybe during the summer."
