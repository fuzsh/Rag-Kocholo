        "text": "Due to the Mediterranean climate and mild winters, Croatia is definitely worth a trip in winter. Here you can take a leisurely stroll along the empty beaches and let your soul dangle. Besides that, Croatia also offers many other activities and sights in winter!\n\nWinter in Croatia – what to see and experience?\n\nCroatia and winter – doesn't that actually exclude each other? The country offers year-round culture and entertainment as well as extremely mild temperatures, which can vary quite a bit in winter depending on the climate zone:\n\nIn Dalmatia on the Adriatic coast, winter is mild and usually not below 10°C during the day and 5°C at night.\n\nIn the lowlands (around Zagreb), temperatures can drop below 0°C, and there is snow in January and February, inviting winter sports.\n\nIn Central Croatia, the mountain climate is the coldest, with daytime temperatures around 5°C and nighttime temperatures that can drop below freezing.\n\nEven with lower temperatures, you have a wide range of activities, exhibitions, concerts, and theater performances as well as street festivals and masquerade balls to choose from in Croatia in winter:\n\nChristmas events:\n\nThe popular Christmas market in Zagreb\n\nThe well-known 40-day Winter Festival in Dubrovnik with concerts, ice skating, Christmas plays, and much more.\n\nCarnival:\n\nCarnival events in Rijeka (Kvarner Bay) and Samobor (near Zagreb)\n\nWinter Carnival in Pag. This spectacle has been one of Croatia's most popular winter events for 90 years.\n\nNational parks in Croatia in winter:\n\nThe landscapes are partly spectacular, especially in the national parks, which you can visit in peace in Croatia in winter. The highlight among the national parks in Croatia in winter is the Plitvice Lakes National Park. However, the Krka Park is just as impressive.\n\nRelaxation in the hot springs:\n\nThe thermal baths are very popular and especially relaxing in Croatia in winter. You will find a very large selection in all regions. Some of the best include the baths in Daruvarske Toplice, Krapinske Toplice, Stubičke Toplice, Sveti Martin na Muri, Tuhelj, and Varaždinske Toplice.\n\nHiking, culture, and delicacies:\n\nIn the cool winter climate of Croatia, you can enjoy excellent hiking in Croatia or cultural sightseeing. The historical buildings in Dalmatia are particularly popular for this.\n\nWhen you stop for a meal, you can satisfy your hunger with many traditional winter dishes. Various stews, bean soup, delicious desserts and sweets, as well as top-quality Croatian wine, await you. In Baranja, you can also enjoy excellent fish dishes, sausages, or goulash.\n\nCroatia in winter – can easily compete with European ski resorts\n\nCroatia in winter is not suitable for swimming, but it is perfect for relaxation or a great adventure vacation. It doesn't get as cold on the Adriatic as in Germany, with temperatures around 10°C still common in Croatia in winter. However, it can be rainy and windy, so you should definitely pack appropriate clothing for winter in Croatia.\n\nWhile you are unlikely to encounter snow by the sea, there is snowfall in the middle of the country, and you can even enjoy a budget-friendly ski vacation here! Preferred areas for winter sports include the Dinaric Alps, the Medvednica Mountains, or the southern slope of Mount Papuk.\n\nZagorje, north of Zagreb\n\nPlatak, north of Rijeka\n\nVelika (Papuk)\n\nFrom December to February, these are the perfect spots if you want to enjoy a great ski vacation with less crowding than in the major European ski resorts.\n\nWintering in Croatia – best in a holiday home\n\nDue to the significantly milder winter, Germans tend to not only book a trip to Croatia in winter but to spend the entire winter there. It won't be boring, and the temperatures are also more pleasant than in Germany.\n\nWhat options do you have for this? On the one hand, you can winter on one of the many campsites in the Kvarner Bay or near the Plitvice Lakes. In Istria, Pula or Poreč are suitable for this. However, wild camping is prohibited, so we strongly advise against it.\n\nTo settle comfortably and homely in Croatia in winter, fully packed campsites are often not a relaxing alternative – especially if children or pets are involved. For this, holiday homes with great amenities are the better alternative.\n\nDiscover Croatia in Winter – of course with Crovillas"
