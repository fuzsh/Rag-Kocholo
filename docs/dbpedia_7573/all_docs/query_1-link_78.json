        "text": "Living in Zagreb has many advantages. One of them is certainly the possibility of escaping into nature, which is within easy reach. The proximity of Medvednica to Zagreb is something that the people of Zagreb really appreciate, and the best indicator is that Medvednica Nature Park is visited by about a million people every year!\n\nImage credit: Lice grada\n\nAlthough it seems to many that the ideal time for hiking trips is in the warmer months, nature in winter has a special charm and carries its own beauties that can only be experienced during that time. Zagrebians enjoy spending time exploring Medvednica throughout the whole year, but it offers something different during the winter months, when many visitors go to enjoy the joys of the snow.\n\nImage credit: Lice grada\n\nMedvednica covered in snow\n\nThe top of Medvednica is Sljeme, where parents with children, grandparents, athletes and amateurs go to try out skiing for the first time. I remember the time I first went to Sljeme as a child, with my sleigh. I was so excited that I almost crashed into a nearby tree because I was looking around so excitedly. Don't worry, nothing happened to me, it just encouraged me to go again. It’s a different feeling when you are outside the city, surrounded by snow, and everyone has to come to the same place as you to experience the joys of snow. Winter takes on a different shape and image.\n\nImage credit: Lice grada\n\nSkiing for the first time? Go to Medvednica\n\nWhat is interesting is that due to its proximity to Zagreb, Medvednica is the most visited mountain in Croatia. Medvednica is a rare case of a nature park belonging to the capital, and Zagreb during winter would not be what it is without Medvednica. You can see its peak, Sljeme, covered in a white blanket of snow, from almost every angle and direction. As soon as the first snow falls, crowds of people go to Sljeme, and so the skiing and sledding season begins. The average annual number of days that Medvednica spends under the snow is 93 days, which is quite enough for all Zagrebians to spend at least one weekend enjoying the snow of Sljeme.\n\nImage credit: Ivona Kezić\n\nŽumberak - home of bears\n\nSamobor mountain – Žumberak does not lag behind Medvednica when it comes to the natural beauty of rich flora and fauna that regularly attracts hikers, mountaineers and nature lovers. Medvednica is a mountain without bears, but walking through Žumberak you could see a bear or a wolf walking quietly through the forest and hiding from prying eyes. I visited Žumberak once and realized that one day is not enough to get to know the beauty of it, because it is a journey that reveals something new every time. I definitely have to go again as soon as possible during the winter months, and embark on an adventure that consists of an easy walk and lots of fun and new experiences.\n\nImage credit: Ivona Kezić\n\nIf you are near Zagreb, trails that you can walk in Žumberak are at your fingertips and, through a couple of very interesting tours, you can meet all your needs for recreation in winter. You will be in good company, with invigorating food and drinks and many interesting things that will satisfy everyone's needs- from playful children to adults who are looking for a fine glass of homemade wine, or a more serious winter climb.\n\nHeader image credit: Lice grada\n\nAuthor: Ivona Kezić"
