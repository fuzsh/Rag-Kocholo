        "text": "INFORMATIONS\n\nZagreb Adventure Tours – This active holiday called Zagreb Active Adventure is all about exploring the surroundings of the capital of Croatia. Famous for its cultural beauties, Zagreb is often ignored as tourists make a detour to the coast. Zagreb is an exciting city and offers a great window into Croatian culture. It offers arts, music, architecture, gastronomy, and all the other things that make a quality capital city. Such as the lovely nature that surrounds it, including the famous Medvednica Nature Park, a favourite destination for the citizens of Zagreb and their guests.\n\nZagreb Active Adventure unforgettable experience\n\nWhile on board the Zagreb Active Adventure tour we will be kayaking down the Mreznica river. The fragrant fresh air will refresh our spirits. We will also visit the infamous National Park Plitvice Lakes, one of the oldest national parks in Southeast Europe and the largest national park in Croatia. Plitvice Lakes National Park was added to the UNESCO World Heritage register in 1979. The combination of activity, scenery, and cultural immersion makes this journey a unique and unforgettable experience.\n\nZagreb Adventure Tours will provide you with an expert local guide who will accompany you and ensure you have the full experience of the tour.\n\nITINERARY\n\nDAY 1 – Arrival in Zagreb\n\nOur trip begins today in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. The hostel is well-located for exploring the city’s main attractions. We will meet for a welcome drink and discuss the upcoming itinerary. Depending upon your arrival, we can organise either a cycling tour of Zagreb or a tour on Segway for an extra charge. Spend the evening enjoying the beautiful architecture, the old town, ancient monuments, and Zagreb nightlife.\n\nVan drive from airport: Zagreb 30 min\n\nDAY 2 – Kayaking Mreznica canyon and Plitvice Lakes walking\n\nThis morning we drive from Zagreb to Slunj and prepare ourselves for a water day in the upper Mreznica canyon. We start our expedition upstream, travelling through a gorge so narrow and deep that the sun enters it for only a few hours each day, around noon, creating spectacular light effects. We continue our journey to the second-highest waterfall on Mreznica (8m), a magical place ideal for swimming and a picnic. After a break, we head downstream and finish the adventure back where we left our vehicles.\n\nIn the afternoon you’ll head to Plitvice Lakes National Park, a stunning landscape of lakes, forests, caves, and waterfalls. You’ll spend several hours hiking into the park, then head back to the start by boat and train. Return to Zagreb in the evening to enjoy the city.\n\nVan ride: 1 hour one way; canoeing/kayaking or rafting: class II-III, 3-4 hours\n\nDAY 3 – Nature Park Medvednica (Bear Mountain)\n\nMeet in the hostel lobby after breakfast and head out to Medvednica, the mountain embracing Croatia’s capital city. Zagreb citizens’ favorite destination takes us to Medvedgrad, a medieval fortress with a stunning view over the city. Just like Zagreb hikers used to do, we’ll take a tram leading to the bottom of the mountain and make our way up to the top on foot. Medvednica is a unique example of an almost fully preserved natural environment just out the back door of a large city. The mountain massif is covered by dense forests of beech, oak, and chestnut. Bikceviceva trail (2.5 miles) leads us through rich forest habitats to Puntijarka mountain hut. It would be a shame to miss out on a traditional lunch of warm bean soup with sausages. The peak, Sljeme, is only a short walk away (0.8 miles). We’ll visit the top of the mountain, including a ski resort famous for the Snow Queen Trophy slalom race held as a part of the Alpine skiing World Cup. On our way back to the bottom, we will pass by Tomislavov Dom to catch the route Bazulovka (meaning the bean trail). This will lead us to Medvedgrad (3.8 miles), a medieval fortress with a stunning view over the city. We will again use public transport (bus and tram) to get back to our hostel. Depart from Zagreb for the airport and flight home. You are welcome to schedule your homeward transport for any time. If you decide to spend more time in Croatia, our guides will be happy to recommend other beautiful places to visit – especially those you won’t find in tourist guidebooks.\n\nHiking: 6-8 miles; Terrain: moderate, well-marked paths; Elevation: 3.395 ft. (1035 m, Sljeme), Van drive from airport: Zagreb 30 min\n\nNote on Itinerary:\n\nThis itinerary is subject to change due to group abilities and preferences, weather, water levels, special events of interest, etc. Raftrek Guides and Trip Leaders will do their utmost to ensure the best possible experience for their clients without compromising safety at any time.
