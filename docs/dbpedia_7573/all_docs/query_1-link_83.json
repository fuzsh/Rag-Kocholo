        "text": "The \"Old Village\" (Staro selo) Museum Kumrovec\n\nLooking for a fun day trip from Zagreb (that’s not too far of a drive)? I’m always on the hunt for new places to discover, and having lived in Zagreb for almost 8 years now, I’ve compiled a list of the best places we’ve explored and loved as a family.\n\nWhat have we found? Samobor for its famous dessert and quaint small town feel, Varazdin and Trakoscan to explore some medieval castles, Turanj for the Homeland War Museum to learn about recent history, Kumrovec to see Tito’s birthplace and take a glimpse into village life back in the day, Krapina to learn about the history of humans and the Earth, and the list goes on!\n\nKeep reading for a complete guide to these day trips: what to do there, how far it is, if there’s anything else to discover in the nearby vicinity, are there any entrance fees, is it kid friendly, etc\n\nDelicious Kremsnita, at \"U Prolazu\"\n\n,\n\n1. Samobor\n\nHow far? About a 45 min drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Walk around the quaint little town and along the river, then sit for coffee and try their famous dessert, Kremsnita, at “U Prolazu” on the main square\n\nEntrance fees? No, just wander at your leisure\n\nDirection? West of Zagreb.\n\nVisit anything else nearby? You could hike to Japetic, the highest peak of Samoborsko gorje (the mountain nearby) or visit Samobor Castle ruins, which are atop of Tepec Hill.\n\nIt’s on the way to… It could be a nice stop if you’re driving from Zagreb to Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nCan you get there without a car? Yes! Public buses go regularly from the main bus station in Zagreb to the main bus station in Samobor, and cost about 28 kunas each.\n\nSamobor is a sweet little town on the Gradna River, with a quaint center square filled with cafes and little shops. We go there once every couple of months to get our fix of my favorite dessert, Kremsnita, which the city is famous for. “U Prolazu” is the best place for Kremsnita, in my opinion.\n\nYou can also stroll along the river, through the park behind the center, and there’s plenty of hiking in the hills as well.\n\nThe Old Town (Stari Grad) - Varazdin\n\n2. Varazdin\n\nHow far? About an hour drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Walk around the center and admire the unique architecture, have a coffee at a cafe overlooking the castle on Miljenka Stančića Square, visit the fortress and enter the museum inside if you wish!\n\nEntrance fees? Only for the little museum inside the castle which is 35kn, but you can walk through other parts of the fortress, free of charge\n\nDirection? North of Zagreb.\n\nVisit anything else nearby? The town of Cakovec with the medieval Zrinski Castle ​from the 16th century.\n\nIt’s on the way to… It could be a nice stop if you’re driving from Zagreb to Budapest, Hungary\n\nCan you get there without a car? Yes! Buses go regularly from the main bus station in Zagreb and cost about 85 kunas each.\n\nThis picturesque city and former capital of Croatia makes for a great day trip from Zagreb. You can walk around the castle along the higher bank to see it from all sides, and then walk over the little drawbridge to Miljenka Stancica Square to have a coffee and admire the castle from afar.\n\nWalk through the main square, King Tomislav Square, and see the town hall, as well as Draskovic Palace, and like any other European town, there are plenty of little churches to visit as well.\n\nFeeding animals in Krasograd\n\n​3. Krasograd / Ekopark Kras\n\n​\n\nHow far? About a 45min drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes! It’s practically made for kids!\n\nWhat to do? Have a picnic and watch your kids play on several outdoor playgrounds, visit the horses, feed the ducks, have lunch at the lovely restaurant on the grounds, your kids can also drive little electric cars or jump on the trampolines there for a small fee (last time we were there, it was around 10kn for a short ride or jump)\n\nEntrance fees? Only for extra activities for kids like driving the little electric cars or jumping on the trampoline, no main entrance fee.\n\nDirection? Southwest of Zagreb.\n\nVisit anything else nearby? If you are a wine lover, the stunning Plesivica Wine Road & region is nearby!\n\nIs it on the way to… It’s on the way if you’re driving from Zagreb to Karlovac\n\nCan you get there without a car? Unfortunately, not very easily or directly\n\nKrasograd is a little gem for kids and families owned by the best and biggest Croatian candy factory, Kras. We came here on a whim and our babies loved it. There are many different little playgrounds kids can climb on, places to picnic, a nice restaurant for lunch, even a little pool (but we went in early spring, so the pool wasn’t open).\n\nThere are also some farm animals you can see (horses, goats, ducks donkeys, pigs, chickens..), and lots of green space for a nice break from the city.\n\nTrakoscan Castle\n\n4. Trakoscan Castle\n\nHow far? About 1hr and 15mins drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Visit the castle, walk the pathway around the small lake behind the castle, enjoy the beautiful scenery, you can also rent a small pedal boat to enjoy the lake at your leisure (and squeeze in some exercise, too ;)\n\nEntrance fees? To enter the castle/museum - 40kn for adults, 20kn for kids 8-18, free for kids 7 and under\n\nDirection? North of Zagreb\n\nVisit anything else nearby? Vuglec Breg Winery if you’re a food and wine lover. The Neanderthal museum is also nearby.\n\nIt’s on the way to… it’s on the way when driving from Zagreb to Graz, Austria\n\nCan you get there without a car? Unfortunately, not very easily or directly\n\nThis is one of the most stunning castles in Croatia, especially with the view when you look back across the lake! It’s a great castle & museum to visit on its own (showing and telling stories about the daily life of residents in their time), but what I love about this place is the beautiful setting, and walking all around the lake.\n\nSljeme is fun for kids even in the winter!\n\nIn front of Puntijarka mountain house\n\n5. Sljeme\n\nHow far? About a 40min drive to the peak, or about 15mins drive to the starting point if you want to hike to the top instead!\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Enjoy the breathtaking views of Zagreb from the top of the mountain, have some traditional mountain food at the restaurant at the peak, ski if it’s winter time, hike or bike to the top and back down if you’re up for it in the other seasons (you can also take the bus one or both directions)\n\nEntrance fees? No\n\nDirection? North of Zagreb\n\nVisit anything else nearby? On the opposite side of Zagreb, there is Marija Bistrica the largest Marian shrine in Croatia\n\nIt’s on the way to… just the peak of the mountain ;)\n\nCan you get there without a car? Yes! You can take the tram (8 or 14) to the end of the line, and then a bus from there to reach the starting point of the hike, or ride the bus right to the top if you’re not up for a hike\n\nSljeme (on Mount Medvednica) is a wonderful, active day trip to spend in nature! You can hike (or bike) right to the top with well marked trails, or you can drive to the peak and still enjoy a beautiful day on the mountain. The peak is at 1033m and the views of course, are breathtaking!\n\nHomeland War Museum in Turanj\n\n6. Homeland War Museum\n\nHow far? About 1hr drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Explore the indoor part of the museum, as well as the open-air section, where you can see many amazing artifacts from the war (tanks, planes, etc.)\n\nEntrance fees? 60kn for adults,120kn for a family ticket (2 adults and any underage children)\n\nDirection? Southwest of Zagreb\n\nVisit anything else nearby? The beautiful city of Karlovac (situated on 4 rivers built by Austrians as a six-pointed star fortress in the 16th century).\n\nIt’s on the way to… it’s on the way when driving from Zagreb to Karlovac / to the coast / to Rastoke Village / to Plitvice Lakes National Park\n\nCan you get there without a car? Unfortunately, not very easily or directly\n\nThe Museum of Homeland War opened just recently (the indoor part), and is a nice educational trip to learn about the recent history and war in Croatia. There is an outside part which showcases tanks, planes, vehicles, etc., and also now a small indoor museum, which shows an informative timeline and description of events. It’s worth a visit, especially if you’re on the way to Plitvice Lakes, as it’s right en route!\n\nVeliki Tabor Castle\n\n7. Veliki Tabor\n\nHow far? About 1hr and 15min drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Visit the castle and museum and enjoy the beautiful scenery\n\nEntrance fees? 25kn for adults, 55kn for a family ticket (2 adults and any underage children)\n\nDirection? Northwest of Zagreb\n\nVisit anything else nearby? Kumrovec (Tito’s birthplace), Staro Selo Museum\n\nIt’s on the way to… not really on any direct route to other “places of interest”\n\nCan you get there without a car? Unfortunately, not very easily or directly\n\nThe newly restored Dvor Veliki, is one of the best known castles in Croatia. It’s beautiful, interesting and educational! My favorite part was learning about the love story and legend of Veronika Desinicka. It’s also interesting to see the artifacts that span through some of the history of the castle.\n\nKrapina Neanderthal Museum/Photo credit IG @josip.biondic\n\n8. Krapina Neanderthal Museum\n\nHow far? About 1hr drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Visit the museum\n\nEntrance fees? 60kn for adults, 120kn for a family ticket (2 adults and small children)\n\nDirection? North of Zagreb\n\nVisit anything else nearby? Kumrovec (Tito’s birthplace) & Staro Selo (Old village Museum)\n\nIt’s on the way to… it’s on the way when driving from Zagreb to Ptuj Thermal Spa in Slovenia\n\nCan you get there without a car? Unfortunately, not very easily or directly\n\nThis museum is so interesting (I think one of the best in Croatia) with all of the educational, interactive displays, explaining human history and evolution. There are also some multimedia presentations, and all of the descriptions and exhibits are nicely put together.\n\nTito’s birthhouse\n\n​9. Kumrovec (Tito’s birthplace), Staro Selo Museum\n\nHow far? About 1hr drive from Zagreb\n\nKid friendly? Yes!\n\nWhat to do? Visit the “Staro Selo” (Old Village) museum, which takes you by foot from place to place within the village\n\nEntrance fees? 25kn for adults, 55kn for a family ticket (2 adults and any underage children)\n\nDirection? North of Zagreb\n\nVisit anything else nearby? Veliki Tabor Castle\n\nIt’s on the way to… not really on any direct route to other “places of interest”\n\nCan you get there without a car? Unfortunately, not very easily or directly\n\nThe Staro Selo Museum in Kumrovec gives a great, authentic representation of living and working in the past, and is more of an open-air museum, as you can wander from one “house” or “shop” to the next throughout the village.\n\nThe village actually still has a few residents, but has been turned into a sort of living museum to honor Tito (former president of ex-Yugoslavia), as this was his birthplace and hometown. We were pleasantly surprised with our visit, and loved how it was done to portray real village life as it was.\n\nFamily lunch at Kezele\n\nThe best buffet in Croatia"
