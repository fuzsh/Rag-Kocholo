        "text": "About my trip to Tuscanyâ€¦\n\nIâ€™ve visited Tuscany a couple of times before, in fact quite a few years ago. Once it was a trip to Florence and another time a short trip to the countryside. But it was my dream to do a road-trip and visit as many charming little hilltop towns as I can. All that while staying in a beautiful Tuscan villa among the vineyards and olive trees of course! Drinking red wine and eating cheese! ðŸ˜€ And this Spring my dream came trueâ€¦ The best part is I shared the experience with my best friend so that made everything that much more special.\n\nThis blog post is not intended to be a travel guide so I wonâ€™t be sharing tips on where to eat or what tourist attractions to visit. I wanted to do a blog post as a photo diary of all the beauty we saw on our 5-days journey and images from 12 towns we visited. Most of them are small towns as that was what we wanted this trip to be all about.\n\nCharming towns, delicious food, best gelato, great wine, lots of walking and just taking in all the beauty that Tuscany has to offer. This time we didnâ€™t visit Florence as we both visited it on some previous trips and as I said, this trip was all about smaller towns. But we did spent half day in Siena, a much bigger city but one of the most beautiful ones. Even if I already visited it, itâ€™s a city that I can come back to over and over again. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy the photos and that they will possibly inspire you for your next tripâ€¦ ðŸ™‚\n\nSan Gimignano\n\nSan Gimignano is a small walled medieval hill town in the province of Siena, Tuscany, north-central Italy. Itâ€™s rich in medieval architecture and is one of the best-preserved Italian medieval towns. With city walls, gates, and 14 of its famous old towers remaining intact. These towers, characteristic of San Gimignano, once numbered 72. They were built by leading families competing with each other for prestige. San Gimignano may be small but we loved it so much that we returned few times (it didnâ€™t hurt that our Tuscan villa was just on the opposite hill :D). To just wander the beautiful streets, exploring charming hidden corners, to admire its architecture and gorgeous little shops. I have to mention that we had a fantastic gelato in award-winning artisan gelateria Dondoli. Here are some fragments of beauty and charm of San Gimignanoâ€¦\n\nâ€¦\n\nRead More Â»\n\nAfter years of dreaming about snow, I finally got a chance to enjoy and photograph true winter magicâ€¦\n\nJust a week before my planned trip to Slovenia this January where I joined a photography workshop, the temperatures both in Croatia and Slovenia were more like spring than winter. It was way above average warm! It didnâ€™t look very optimistic that we will get the snow and winter conditions we wanted. However, I still had hope and call it a hunch that things will change and that I will finally get the snow Iâ€™ve been waiting for years.\n\nThe last few years we didnâ€™t have â€˜real winterâ€™ in this part of Europe and even when there was snow somewhere nearby, for one reason or another I couldnâ€™t travel to enjoy it. But this year yes! The photos will show the best how I feel about that week of winter magicâ€¦\n\nâ€¦\n\nRead More Â»\n\nHow is this Autumn treating you? Between work I did manage to enjoy some beautiful moments in nature and my favourite season. I wanted to share with you this moody and beautiful early Autumn morning in Maksimir Park, Zagrebâ€¦\n\nOn another note, I know itâ€™s been too long since my last post! I have so many things that I wanted to post but the time somehow escaped me. This year has been very busy and I didnâ€™t have as much time as I wanted for the blog. Or for creating just for the purpose of creating. But Iâ€™m not complaining. Iâ€™m so very grateful for all the work opportunities and shooting on great projects and for amazing clients!\n\nSince my blog and my social media pages are so important to me as an outlet to share my photography with people who share the same passion or simply enjoy and appreciate the beauty, I will find more time for that too. Itâ€™s a promise. To myself.\n\nI wonâ€™t be writing much this time as I want to you to sit back and enjoy this early morning Autumn mood I captured in Maksimir Park in Zagreb, Croatia. I know that some people donâ€™t enjoy these kind of mornings but I find them wonderfully melancholic and beautiful. Melancholy is one of the favourite moods to portray in my photography and often I am more inspired by it than by joy and happiness. Finding beauty in melancholy intrigues me. Also, expressing mood of tranquility, slowing down, ordinary momentsâ€¦ Those are the moments I am drawn to and I feel passionate about. I hope my photography brings something beautiful and peaceful to you too.\n\nâ€¦\n\nRead More Â»"
