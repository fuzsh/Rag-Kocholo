        "text": "As the crisp air brightens my cheeks and little puffs of breath escape from my mouth, I inhale the scent of sizzling sausages and sweet fritule drenched in chocolate sauce. The tantalizing aroma intertwines with Croatian Christmas music and drifts on a light breeze from the cheerfully decorated wooden huts at the Zagreb Christmas Market.\n\nFestive lights and classic Croatia Christmas decorations hang in a canopy over the street, casting a warm glow onto the revelers as they peruse the wares for sale. It was our first night celebrating Christmas in Croatia and we were just getting an introduction to the famous Advent in Zagreb event, but it was already putting us in a festive mood!\n\nChristmas Markets Zagreb: What You Need To Know\n\nTravelers interested in attending the Zagreb Christmas Markets likely have heaps of questions…and we’ve got answers! In this Zagreb Travel Guide, we include everything you need to know about the Zagreb Christmas Market. In addition to highlighting specific events at Advent Zagreb – like the ice rink and must-see squares – we also include details of other Christmas markets in Croatia. So, are you ready to find out why Christmas in Croatia is the perfect place to be? Of course you are!\n\n{Find details and dates for 2023 Advent Zagreb Program at the end of the article}\n\nZagreb Advent: Christmas in Europe\n\nAlthough lesser-known than the long-standing and famous Christmas markets in Germany and Austria, the Advent in Zagreb Winter Festival is truly impressive!\n\nWe were first intrigued by the Zagreb Christmas Market when glittering images of the celebration flooded our social media feeds. Unlike the stunning coastline photos of Croatia we are accustomed to seeing, these featured an entirely different scene: Croatia in winter. And it was beautiful.\n\nMost people don’t think of Croatia as one of the Best European Cities for Christmas, but the ‘Advent u Zagrebu’ event has changed that. Croatia in December might just be one of the merriest places to be for the holidays thanks largely to the award-winning Advent in Zagreb!\n\nWhy is Zagreb a Great Place to Visit for Christmas?\n\nZagreb in December is amazing! The capital city is adorned with bright Christmas lights, theme-festooned streets and an outdoor ice skating rink. The Zagreb, Croatia Christmas Market, which began as a modest affair in 2002, grew in just a few years to something utterly spectacular. And, each year the Advent Zagreb festival gets even better.\n\nEuropean Best Destinations Christmas Markets\n\nAdvent Zagreb has garnered so much attention that it was bestowed the honor of Best Christmas Market in Europe by European Best Destinations for three consecutive years – in 2016, 2017 and 2018. We can’t think of a better way to kick off the holiday season than at the Advent in Zagreb, Croatia Festival!\n\nOur Zagreb Christmas Market Review\n\nWe have visited the famous European Christmas Markets in London, Frankfurt and Dusseldorf and celebrated Christmas in Amsterdam and Paris. To be honest – we wondered how the Zagreb, Croatia Christmas market would stack up. After spending two weeks at the Zagreb Advent Festival, we believe it’s one of the best holiday fairs in Europe!\n\nAs we wandered through the decorated lanes each evening, we couldn’t keep the giddy grins from our faces. Advent Zagreb is full of festiveness – and there is nothing quite like a European Christmas market to usher in the holiday spirit. With a steaming cup of mulled wine in one hand and the other tucked into the crook of Kris’s arm, we navigated our way through the merriment and beauty of Christmas in Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nWhat Makes Zagreb Xmas Market Unique?\n\nUnlike some holiday markets that cluster solely around a single main square, the Zagreb Christmas Market location is appealingly spread throughout the city. Furthermore, each year the Advent Markets in Zagreb evolve and expand.\n\nBooths selling classic Croatian Christmas gifts line the streets and sit in clusters at the center of multiple squares – not just the main Ban Jelačić Square. A live Croatian nativity scene is set up in Kaptol next to the Zagreb Cathedral. The Gric Tunnel is turned into a festive wonderland. The gazebo in Zrinjevac Park serves as a stage for live music. Fairy tale holiday huts are set up in European Square.\n\nEach district is thoughtfully designed to create a specific ambiance and to attract a certain audience. From kid-friendly corners celebrating Croatian Christmas traditions to streets for shopping and eating Croatian Christmas food to a lane just for ‘fooling around’, visitors can wander the transformed urban spaces and find something unique about them all.\n\nExperience All The Best Things To Do in Zagreb!\n\nWhat We Loved About Zagreb Advent\n\nOften, we were drawn down the cobblestone lanes of the oldest part of Zagreb into one of the five enclaves for the Advent Edition of Dvorista. Dressed up for the holidays with Croatian Christmas decorations – white lights, garland and Christmas trees – these intimate courtyards presented a cozy retreat from the lively celebrations elsewhere in the city. Complete with lounge singer style performances, Dvorista was our favorite part of the Zagreb Christmas market.\n\nWe’ve spent a total of 2 weeks celebrating Advent in Zagreb over the years, but haven’t actually stayed for Christmas in Zagreb. However, we can say with certainty that Zagreb Advent got us in the holiday spirit and we look forward to seeing what is new each year!\n\nAdvent Zagreb Highlights\n\nZagreb is one of the best European Christmas destinations for good reason: the Zagreb Christmas Market features an array of places and ways to celebrate the season. As the Zagreb Christmas Market grows, new events are added to the already incredible line up. The following are the most admired Zagreb Christmas Market locations every year.\n\nIce Skating Zagreb\n\nThe Zagreb Ice Skating Park is always a popular part of the Zagreb Christmas market holidays. The open-air ice park is illuminated by the glow of Zagreb Christmas lights. It is located next to the Art Pavilion on King Tomislav Square and is surrounded by traditional Christmas market huts.\n\nThe opening of the entire Advent Zagreb event is kicked off at the ice skating rink with a beautiful performance. Those who want to go skating in Zagreb can rent skates for either a daytime or evening spin out on the ice.\n\nZagreb Advent in Zrinjevac Park\n\nPart of the city’s Green Horseshoe, Zrinjevac is one of our Favorite Zagreb Parks anytime of year – but especially during the holidays. Advent on Zrinjevac is a magical fairytale of lights and wonder. Huts line the main path and the fountain and gazebo are covered in lights.\n\nThe market in Zrinjevac is home to several Croatian Christmas traditions, including homemade Christmas ornaments and classic Croatian Christmas food. On select evenings, there are live performances from the gazebo, adding to the festivities.\n\nChristmas in Zagreb on Strossmayer\n\nAdvent on Strossmayer is one of the best events in the Zagreb Upper Town. The lane, which is lit in a dazzling array of lights, is lined with pop-up cafes serving mulled wine and holiday-themed drinks. Don’t miss the views over the city – or the fun Christmas-themed cut-out photo ops!\n\nBest Things To Eat at the Christmas Market in Zagreb\n\nWherever our wandering wonderland trail took us we always found rows of little huts selling holiday gifts and serving Christmastime fare. While many booths sell Croatian classics, international holiday fare is also available. We are highlighting some of the must-try Zagreb Christmas Market food.\n\nCroatian Sausages\n\nAt the Zagreb Christmas market, heaps of sausages – of which we ate our fair share – are grilled to perfection in the small huts. There are numerous types of Croatian cured meats to choose from, but our favorite is the Kranjska sausage.\n\nClassic Croatian Christmas Food\n\nPlates of Charcuterie – which often include Zimska salami and Kulen – are another popular Croatian cured meat option at the Zagreb Advent Market.\n\nHowever, salty meats aren’t the only Croatia food at the Christmas markets in Zagreb. We saw tempting bowls of goulash and platters of Sarma (cabbage rolls stuffed with minced meat), which is a classic holiday meal in the region!\n\nCroatian Christmas Cookies and Sweet Treats\n\nMany booths sell Croatian Christmas cookies that are cut into stars and wreaths and are prettily packaged to give as gifts. We like Paprenjaci – a spicy gingerbread cookie, but Vanilin Kiflice (Vanilla Crescents) are even more in demand.\n\nThat said, the most popular treats at every Croatian Christmas market is hot fritule. More than once, we were lured to the booths cranking out the small doughnuts drizzled with warm chocolate sauce.\n\nKuhano Vino/Mulled Wine\n\nThe real treat for us, however, was the kuhano vino (mulled wine), which is on offer at every Christmas market in Croatia. The warm, spiced drink flows in an endless stream from nearly all directions, making evenings at Zagreb Advent all the merrier!\n\nLive Music at Advent Zagreb, Croatia\n\nTo further enhance the festive mood of Advent in Zagreb, live music drifted down the streets from stages all around the city. Entertained by the varied performances – we were astounded by the sheer number of musical acts at the Zagreb winter festival.\n\nWe witnessed rock bands, brass bands, jazz singers, women’s choirs, children’s chorales and folk dancers performing everything from holiday tunes to classic hits of every decade.\n\nZagreb Xmas Tour\n\nVisit the best Zagreb Advent events with a local guide and learn about Christmas in Zagreb from someone who actually lives there.

Zagreb winter weather is typically cold with highs in the 40Fs and lows in the mid 30Fs. Snow is possible – as is a rain/snow wintery mix. However, due to it’s unique geography, the weather in Croatia at Christmas varies drastically, with much milder climates along the southern Dalmatian Coast.\n\nHow To Get to Zagreb, Croatia\n\nGetting to Zagreb in Christmas season can be a bit trying. There are no direct flights to Zagreb from the United States and throughout Europe there are far fewer flights to Zagreb in winter than in the bustling summer travel season.\n\nThat said, most major European flight hubs – such as London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam – provide flights to Zagreb in the wintertime.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to get to Zagreb by train or bus from regional destinations like Mostar, Belgrade, Ljubljana, Vienna or Budapest.\n\nWe share our advice for finding cheap airfare in our article, How To Find the Best Flights.\n\nWhere To Stay for Zagreb Advent\n\nAdvent in Zagreb has fast become one of the city’s biggest events – meaning accommodations can fill up quickly during the holiday season. Although celebrations take place all over the city, we think it’s best to choose accommodations in the center.\n\nFor our longer stay, we opted to rent an apartment through Airbnb, but there are many hotels to choose from, as well. If you are looking for place to stay during Christmas in Zagreb, take a look at these top-rated hotels (based on guest reviews):\n\nHotel Central\n\nSheraton Zagreb Hotel\n\nBest Western Premier Hotel Astoria\n\nHotel Orient Express\n\nBefore you start searching for your accommodations, use our Tips for Finding the Best Hotels.\n\nWhat To Pack for your Zagreb Christmas Market Trip\n\nPacking for winter trips can often be tricky.

Make sure to bring a good travel camera to capture the sights. We recommend using an actual camera rather than your phone to get the best pictures.
