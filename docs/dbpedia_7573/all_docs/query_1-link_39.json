        "text": "Christmas in Zagreb\n\nCroatia’s vibrant capital is a living city, home to a quarter of the country’s population, and serving as the cultural and political heart of the nation. An amalgamation of cultures, Zagreb perfectly blends the sophistication of Central Europe with the laid-back charm of the Mediterranean. It is home to a thriving creative scene, countless cultural institutions, and some of the country’s finest restaurants, as well as one of the best Christmas markets in all of Europe.\n\nAdvent for Christmas in Zagreb is a spectacular city-wide experience which transforms the capital into a winter wonderland. More than 25 individual Christmas Markets are spread throughout the city’s main squares and promenades, each with its own unique theme and atmosphere, yet blending together to give the feeling of one all-encompassing market. Charming stalls offer artisan products and handicrafts as well as hearty regional cuisine and aromatic mulled wine. Glistening lights, colorful ornaments, and seasonal decorations complement a daily program of open-air entertainment and cultural performances, imbuing the atmosphere with holiday magic.\n\nWith a myriad of activities on offer for guests of all ages, Advent in Zagreb offers something for everyone. The team at Tasteful Croatian Journeys is on hand to offer expert suggestions, guiding you through each of Zagreb’s unique individual markets on an unforgettable, tailor-designed Christmastime journey.\n\nAdvent in Zagreb had the honor of being named “Best Christmas Market” by European Best Destinations three years in a row, from 2016 – 2018. As a three-time winner, Zagreb has now received this award the maximum number of times.\n\nShopping, Cuisine & Merry-Making for Christmas in Zagreb\n\nZagreb’s colorful market stalls present a wide variety of goods, often with a connection to local traditions and culture. Items on offer include decorative ornaments, candles, ceramics, jewelry, woolen scarves and hats, an array of toys, and more. One popular souvenir from the north of Croatia, able to be found year-round, are the hand-carved wooden toys from the Hrvatsko Zagorje region. This craft, developed in the 19th century by the villagers along the pilgrimage route to the Marian shrine of Our Lady of the Snows, is listed on the UNESCO Representative list of intangible heritage of humanity. The toys, made of soft wood, take the form of whistles, horses, roosters, birds, butterflies, cars, doll furniture, and spinning dancers, many with moving parts which make noise. Cut and carved by the men, and hand painted by the women of the villages, no two toys are exactly the same. Another noteworthy souvenir are Licitar, the ubiquitous red heart-shaped gingerbread cookie which has become a symbol of Croatia. These colorfully painted cookies date back to the 13th century. At that time, they were an edible sweet, but now serve mainly decorative purposes, especially as Christmas ornaments in Croatian homes. They too find a home on the UNESCO Representative list of intangible heritage of humanity.\n\nIt is easy to eat well during Advent in Zagreb. Food stalls are plentiful and located throughout the city’s markets offering a wide variety of seasonal and year-round delicacies, both local and international. Regional favorites such as Kobasice (homemade pork sausages), Sarma (cabbage leaves stuffed with minced meat, rice, and spices, simmered in tomato sauce or broth), Štrukli (baked rolled pastry filled with cottage cheese and sour cream), and Fritule (small fried balls of dough dusted with powdered sugar and occasionally topped with chocolate or caramel) can be found at multiple locations all around the city’s numerous markets. Warming beverages such as Kuhano Vino (literally, cooked wine) are so pervasive that the scent of citrus and warm spices permeates the chilly market air, wafting off the freshly mulled wine steeped with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and dried fruit. Croatia’s popular drink, Rakija (a type of brandy), comes in a variety of flavors and warms from the inside out.\n\nChristmas markets are, above all, a place for gathering and spending quality time with family and friends. Therefore, in addition to shopping and dining, each year brings new ways to experience Advent in Zagreb with a program of concerts, activities, games, and entertainment. Yearly staples include the ever-popular open-air skating rink at King Tomislav Square, the live nativity scene staged in Kaptol outside the Zagreb Cathedral, and the imaginative themed installations in the Grič Tunnel. Numerous stages throughout the city host live concerts, as do some of Zagreb’s most beautiful balconies. Even Zagreb’s public transportation gets a holiday makeover with the introduction of a family favorite, the Merry Christmas Tram, which runs along Praška Street connecting Ban Jelačić Square to Zrinjevac and is driven by Father Christmas himself!\n\nZagreb’s Regional Highlights\n\nTake a day trip to nearby Varaždin, a quaint, beautifully preserved baroque city, tenderly referred to as, “the city where angels sleep.” Having once briefly served as Croatia’s capital, this splendid small city has much to offer curious travelers. Stroll through the charming cobblestoned center, stopping by the town’s delightful museums, churches, and medieval castle before finishing the day with a steamy cup of mulled wine at the festive Christmas Market.\n\nVisit Trakošćan Castle located on the banks of the Drava River in the Krapina-Zagorje region roughly an hour north of Zagreb. Originally built in the late 13th century, the castle is a cultural treasure, rising above the forest as if in a fairy tale. In 1953, it was opened to the public as a museum, home to examples of baroque furniture and historical weapons. Encircled by romantic gardens, and overlooking a picturesque lake, the castle and its grounds should not be missed.\n\nIndulge in the seasonal cuisine of Zagreb with a private Christmas Market Food Tour and Holiday Cookie Baking Class. Begin with a guided tour of Zagreb’s colorful Advent Market, stopping to taste local delicacies and learn about regional customs. After the tour, head into the kitchen to learn traditional recipes and techniques for baking homemade Croatian Christmas cakes and cookies.\n\nSample authentic regional cuisine at Tavren Gabreku 1929 in Samobor, a restaurant which embodies the local spirit with its warm hospitality and traditional fare. Here, age-old recipes are brought to life using fresh, organic produce from local farmers – a favorite of locals and visitors for nearly 100 years.\n\nWitness one of Croatia’s most stunning natural attractions, Plitvice Lakes National Park, blanketed by freshly fallen snow, its color palette transformed from the green of summer to the purest white imaginable, set against the pristine turquoise lakes. The national park’s “Lower Lakes” remain open year-round, rewarding visitors with spectacular views of the icy wonderland.\n\nAdvent in Zagreb Dates & Duration\n\nThe Zagreb Christmas Market normally begins on the Saturday before the first Sunday of Advent and runs through the first week of January.\n\nContact Us Now!\n\nImages ©Zagreb tourist board, ©Varaždin tourist board, and ©Plitvice Lakes National Park"
