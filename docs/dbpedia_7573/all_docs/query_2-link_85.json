        "text": "Croatia has two climates, as you may well expect – one along the coastline, and one for the interior of the country. If you’re visiting, here’s what to expect for climate and weather in Croatia!\n\nClimate & Weather in Croatia – Coast\n\nThe coast has a typically Mediterranean climate consisting of hot, dry, sunny weather during summer, and relatively mild – though somtimes wet – weather in winter.\n\nAverage temperatures during summer should lie in the mid-to-high 20s °C/77-86°F, although it is more likely that you’ll have temperatures well into the 30s °C/high 80s or low 90s °F.\n\nWinters are obviously cooler, although temperatures never really get below about 5°C/41°F. Anything colder than this is considered freak weather, though technically not impossible – in the last ten or so years, there have been occasions of snow in parts of Dalmatia, such as Zadar and Split. In some winters, even Dubrovnik (one of the most southern points of Croatia) has seen a light dusting of snow.\n\nIt is not usual for summer weather to stretch out into autumn with temperatures in the high teens or even low 20s (Celsius) – meaning some hardy souls still hit the beach and go swimming.\n\nIn general, however, during autumn and winter on the coast, you will still experience some sunny days, although it can sometimes get quite rainy.\n\nsource\n\nsource\n\nClimate & Weather in Croatia – Interior\n\nA continental climate exists in the interior of Croatia which means that winters can be pretty cold, with temperatures often falling below 0°C/32°F. Snow is very likely, and can be pretty heavy during the winter.\n\nSummers, on the other hand, can very often be sweltering with temperatures often reaching the mid to high 30s °C/high 80s or low 90s °F. When there’s no cool sea breeze (or the sea itself), it can get a little uncomfortable at times. Officially, average temperatures in the interior would be around the low 20s °C/low 70s °F but, from personal experience, it will be much hotter.\n\nAir-conditioning is reasonably common in Croatia these days. Wherever you are during summer, it is more than likely that your accommodation (hotel or private) will have it, providing you with a bit more comfort in summer. Air-con is also pretty common in cafes, restaurants and bars.\n\nThe climate of Zagreb (country capital city) is classified as an oceanic climate, near the boundary of the humid continental climate. Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are warm, at the end of May the temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with occasional thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above 30 °C (86 °F) on an average 14.6 days each summer."
