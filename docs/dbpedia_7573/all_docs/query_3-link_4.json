        "text": "After an unseasonably warm January, the white stuff has landed in Zagreb with 10-15cm of snow predicted to fall today. Zagreb experienced some of the balmiest temperatures since records began last month and it's fair to say we've got off pretty easy this year. Now the weather has taken a sudden and chilly turn, you're probably going to need that winter coat again.\n\nWeather agencies advise travellers to be cautious on the roads, and HGVs and freight vehicles are restricted unless fitted with winter tyres. Sharp icy winds and a slurry of unset snow are creating a headache for public transport users, as regular services are disrupted by security measures around Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's visit to the capital.\n\nSub-zero temperatures will plummet us right back into the freezing depths of winter this week. Today's bleak mix of snow and rain is set to continue tomorrow with 5-10cm of snowfall expected to drop. So far, this season's snowfall has resulted in less of a powdery playground, and more of a blink-and-you'll-miss-it flurry of frost.\n\nGiven the storm's timing, travellers will face a particularly grim journey home thanks to increased security measures and protests amid the two-day visit from Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic. Closed roads and diverted routes mean getting around Zagreb could be a challenge today. If you don't want to squeeze on to an overcrowded bus or wait around in an insanely long taxi queue, hailing an Uber might help smooth your way."
