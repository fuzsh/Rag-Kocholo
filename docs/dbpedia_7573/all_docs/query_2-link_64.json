        "text": "Warm temperatures made for challenging conditions for the higher bibs once again, at the annual FIS Alpine Snow Queen Trophy World Cup slalom at Sljeme in Zagreb, Croatia, with no Americans making the second run.\n\nA little over a week after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck central Croatia, Germany's Linus Strasser grabbed a sensational career-first slalom victory, with the Austrian duo of Manny Feller and Marco Schwarz rounding out the podium in second and third.\n\nThe organizing committee worked tirelessly to make the Snow Queen Trophy slalom races happen, despite an earthquake and warm temperatures. The course crew watered and salted the track, but the soft conditions and big ruts made it a challenge for the highter bibs, including the Land Rover U.S. Alpine Ski Team, who all started between bibs 45 and 50. Luke Winters, Ben Ritchie, and Jett Seymour—are one of, if not the, youngest men's slalom team on the Tour with an average age of just under 22-years-old.\n\nWinters and Ritchie finished just outside the top-30, in 36th and 39th, respectively, while Seymour did not finish first run.\n\nThe men’s tech team now will jump on a flight to travel to Adelboden, Switzerland for a giant slalom and slalom series this weekend.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMen’s slalom\n\nHOW TO WATCH\n\nJan. 6-13, 2021\n\nFriday, Jan. 8\n\n4:15 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Giant Slalom, run 1 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Streaming Peacock\n\n7:15 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Giant Slalom, run 2 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Broadcast Olympic Channel\n\n7:15 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Giant Slalom, run 2 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Streaming Peacock\n\nSaturday, Jan 9\n\n4:30 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Giant Slalom, run 1 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Streaming Peacock\n\n5:45 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Women's Downhill - LIVE, St. Anton, AUT, Streaming Peacock\n\n7:30 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Giant Slalom, run 2 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Broadcast Olympic Channel\n\n7:30 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Giant Slalom, run 2 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Streaming Peacock\n\n8:00 p.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Giant Slalom - same-day broadcast, Adelboden, SUI, Broadcast NBCSN\n\nSunday, Jan. 10\n\n4:30 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Slalom, run 1 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Streaming Peacock\n\n5:30 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Women's Super-G - LIVE, St. Anton, AUT, Streaming Peacock\n\n7:30 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Slalom, run 2 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Broadcast Olympic Channel\n\n7:30 a.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Slalom, run 2 - LIVE, Adelboden, SUI, Streaming Peacock\n\n2:00 p.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Men's Slalom - same-day broadcast, Adelboden, SUI, Broadcast NBCSN\n\nTuesday, Jan. 12\n\n12:00 p.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Women's Slalom, run 1 - LIVE, Flachau, AUT, Streaming Peacock\n\n2:45 p.m.FIS Alpine World Cup Women's Slalom, run 2 - LIVE, Flachau, AUT, Streaming Peacock"
