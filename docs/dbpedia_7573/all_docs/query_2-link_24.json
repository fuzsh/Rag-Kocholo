        "text": "Adverse winter weather is forecast across Croatia through at least Jan. 19. A storm system is expected to pass over the region from early Jan. 19 and rain will gradually transition to snow throughout the day. Snowfall accumulations of 15-40 cm (6-16 inches) are possible in Gospic Region, 8-25 cm (3-10 inches) in Karlovac Region, and 2-15 cm (1-6 inches) across much of the rest of central and northern Croatia Jan. 19. Strong winds are also expected across Croatia and the combination of gusty winds and snowfall will lead to blowing and drifting snow in places. Hazardous travel conditions are likely due to reduced visibility and slippery roads.\n\nCroatia's State Hydrometeorological Institute (DHMZ) has issued the following weather warnings across the country Jan. 19:\n\nRed heavy snowfall warnings (the highest level on a three-tier scale): Gospic Region.\n\nRed strong wind warnings: Rijeka Region and northern and central Damlamtian coastal waters.\n\nOrange heavy snowfall warnings: Karlovac Region.\n\nOrange strong wind warnings: Gospic, Knin, and Split regions and northern and southern Dalmatian coastal waters.\n\nYellow heavy snowfall warnings: Knin, Osijek, Rijeka, and Zagreb regions.\n\nYellow strong wind warnings: Dubrovnik, Karlovac, Osijek, and Zagreb regions.\n\nOfficials could update and possibly extend the coverage of the weather alerts over the coming hours and days.\n\nIn addition to the heavy snow, strong wind gusts could lead to periods of blowing and drifting snow. Sporadic power outages are possible throughout the affected area.\n\nThe winter weather will likely cause ground transport disruptions in the region over the coming days. Traffic and commercial trucking delays are probable along regional highways. Hazardous driving conditions are likely due to slippery roads and reduced visibility. Authorities will probably close stretches of highways if driving conditions become too dangerous. Gusty winds may threaten to topple high-profile vehicles throughout the affected area. Flight delays and cancellations are likely due to ground stops and deicing operations at regional airports."
