You will explore it like a real local.\n\nSource: intrepidtravel.com\n\nThe Capital City\n\nFirst of all,Zagreb is thecapitaland the largest city ofCroatia.It is located in the northwest of the country. It is also placed along theSavariver, at the southern slopes of theMedvednicamountain. Also, Zagreb lies at approximately 122m (400ft)above sea level. Furthermore, the estimated population of the city in 2018 was 802 762. Moreover, the population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is about 1.2 million. That is approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia.\n\nSource: croatiaweek.com\n\nHence, the city extends over 30 kilometers (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometers (12 miles) north-south.\n\nThe main point\n\nZagreb is the seat of thecentral government,administrative bodies, and almost allgovernment ministries. Therefore, almost all of thelargest Croatian companies,media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. As a result, Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia.

Moreover, it is a city known for its diverseeconomy, high quality of living,museums, sporting, and entertainment events.\n\nHow the City got its name?\n\nSource: infozagreb.hr\n\nName origin?\n\nThe etymology of the nameZagrebis unclear. First, people used the word for the united city only from 1852. But it had been in use as the name of theZagreb Diocesesince the 12th century. And was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century. Ostrogon archbishopFelician first recorded the name in a charter by, dated 1134, mentioned asZagrabiensem episcopate. The older form of the name isZagreb. Nicolas Sanson first recoreded the modern Croatian formZagrebin a 1689 map. On the other side, the name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word*grębъwhich means hill, uplift. (However, note Serbo-Croatianbrȇg< Proto-Slavic*bergъ, whichalsomeans '(smaller) hill', andza brȇg'toortoward the hill'.\n\nHow Germans called Zagreb?\n\nOn the other side, Germans in the Habsburg period used the nameAgram. First of all, this name has been classified as \"probably of Roman origin\". But it could be anAustrian Germanreanalysis of*Zugram. Moreover, inMiddle LatinandModern Latin, Zagreb is known asAgranum(the name of an unrelated Arabian city inStrabo),ZagrabiaorMons Graecensis(alsoMons Crecensis, in reference toGrič(Gradec).\n\nLocal story\n\nIn Croatianfolk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verbza-grab-, meaning \"to scoop\" or \"to dig\". Therefore, oral stories and folk legends tie the name to a drought of the early 14th century. First one is that Augustin Kažotić(c. 1260–1323) has dug a well which miraculously produced water. In another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \"scoop\" water fromManduševacwell (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jelačić Square).
