        "text": "With temperatures dropping, it may seem like the best thing to do while you're in Zagreb is snuggle up and stay indoors. But there's no reason a cold snap can't come with a little adventure or good cheer. Wintertime in the Croatian capital has plenty on offer – here are just five ways to get the most out of Zagreb when it's cold!\n\nDiscover Zagreb's secret side\n\nSure, every city has walking tours for curious tourists, but nobody does them quite like Secret Zagreb. Their wide range of themed walks highlight different aspects of the capital. Badass Women of Zagreb, for example, celebrates influential ladies throughout the city’s history, while Dark Romance in Zagreb reveals tragic love stories from days gone by. Zagreb Ghosts and Dragons provides a spookier look, but since it’s winter, why not discover the stories and history behind the capital’s seasonal traditions with the Zagreb Christmas Carol tour?\n\nEnjoy award-winning Advent festivities\n\nAdvent in Zagreb is a winter must. Running from December into early January, this city-wide celebration offers daily musical entertainment, street food, art installations and workshops, to mention a few. Go ice-skating in the centre of town, or visit one of the many museums taking part in the festivities. Ideal for all ages, Advent caters to families, romantics and anyone looking for some Christmas cheer.\n\nEscape the cold in an Escape Room\n\nNot the type to enjoy the winter outdoors? Then spice up your indoor environment! The escape room craze is well and truly alive in Zagreb, with a wide range of games available throughout the capital. Banding together over the festive period, a number of escape rooms offer participants a tournament-style series of games with weekly winners. Check it out here!\n\nScale Sljeme and trek around Medvednica\n\nJust north of Zagreb – but closer than you think – the wintry slopes attract hikers and nature-lovers. Medvednica is referred to by locals as Sljeme, though that technically only refers to its highest point at 1,033 metres. With all kinds of hiking paths, it’s the perfect way to challenge the winter cold and get the blood pumping, both for enthusiastic casuals and seasoned mountaineers. Grab some bean soup from a mountain lodge, bask in the surroundings and soak up the stunning views.\n\nTake a trip to Samobor"
