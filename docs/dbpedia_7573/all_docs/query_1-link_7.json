        "text": "Croatia Winter is not the most common choice of visitors; most people associate Croatia with sun, sea, and summer. Croatia has its charms in winter, and every year it attracts an increasing number of tourists even in the winter months.\n\nCroatia Winter Weather\n\nSnow in Croatia: snow is characteristic of the continental part of Croatia, especially for the mountains and highlands, and mostly occurs between December and February. Snow on the coast, islands, and southern parts of Croatia is an exception and rarely happens.\n\nWinds in Croatia: everything you need to know about winds boils down to two words: jugo and bura. Jugo is the wind that brings moodiness, nervousness, and rain, while the bura is strong, clean, and unstoppable and most often causes low temperatures on the coasts and numerous traffic problems.\n\nMore about the jugo:https://dreamindalmatia.com/wheater-in-croatia-meet-wind-jugo/\n\nMore about the bura:https://dreamindalmatia.com/weather-in-dalmatia-meet-wind-bura/\n\nCroatia Winter Temperature: after summer, in November the temperatures drop, and in December the average is from 5 to 15°C on the coast and from 0 to 10°C in the continental part.\n\nChristmas in Croatia: Christmas is a very important holiday in Croatia and a point around which family and friends gather. During this period, there are frequent celebrations, outings, gatherings, and trips to various winter festivals. In Dalmatia and parts of Croatia by the sea, this part of the year is mostly characterized by a pleasant Mediterranean winter, so staying outdoors is very pleasant.\n\nThe most famous Croatian Advent event is Advent in Zagreb."
