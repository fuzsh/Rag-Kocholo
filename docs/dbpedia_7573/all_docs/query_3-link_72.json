        "text": "Welcome to Zagreb Airport with our tour guide and transfer to your accommodation in Zagreb. Once you accommodate, we invite you for a short orientational tour of Zagreb, “the Capital of Croatia”. During the tour, you will see the main Zagreb square – Ban Jelačić square, Zagreb Cathedral, green market “Dolac” and more. You will take a ride with Zagreb’s funicular, which is the shortest cable car in the world. The rest of the day is yours to enjoy Zagreb streets.\n\nOn this day, we will take You on our memorable “Advent Tour of Zagreb”. Following the path of thousands of Xmas lights and the scent of gingerbread and mulled wine, we will have plenty of fun. Try excellent food and enjoy the cheerful atmosphere the city has to offer. Zagreb Christmas market is perfect to get in the mood for Christmas. We will start by ice-skating at Tomislav Square and continue through Zrinjevac Park and Chef’s Street in Tomićeva to end up in the Upper Town of Zagreb for some fantastic sights. Don’t forget to try some of the Croatian traditional cuisines.\n\nIn the morning, leave Zagreb and transfer to Slovenia. After 2 hours of pleasant drive through the Slovenian Alps, we arrive at Ljubljana – “the capital of Slovenia”. Our local guide will take an orientational tour of the old town. The colorful market, the cathedral, and the fortress up the hill are some of the highlights. The “Ljubljana Christmas Market” is well known for its vibrancy and cheerful atmosphere. The locals refer to the markets as the Christmas Fair, where you can find mulled wine, tea, liqueurs, and various grilled dishes. After the city tour and lunch, free afternoon and overnight stay in Ljubljana.\n\nAfter breakfast, we leave Ljubljana for Austria country and Salzburg town. On our way, we will stop at Lake Bled. What to say, the stunning blue lake in the heart of the town. The picture-postcard church on the island. A medieval castle is clinging to a rocky cliff and some of the highest peaks of the Julian Alps. We recommend visiting the island church on a traditional “pletna” boat. The town of Bled is everything you could want for a cozy Christmas vacation. It’s a place for a fabulous winter escape. You can try local delicious food and shop for Slovenian souvenirs. After lunch, we continued the trip toward Salzburg. Overnight stay in Salzburg.\n\nWe continue our tour in Salzburg, the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salzburg has so many different faces that are well worth discovering. From New Town to Old Town, learn about the area’s diverse history on this 2.5-hour walking tour. Palace Mirabell, Makartplatz and Mozart House are highlights included in this tour. The Salzburg Christmas has deep historical roots and is one of the world’s oldest Advent markets. It has existed since 1974 in the heart of Salzburg’s old town. At the market, you will discover everything you would possibly wish for. Local folk customs, traditional decorations, mulled wine, hot punch and all forms of Austrian specialties.\n\nOur tour continues towards “Vienna – the capital of Austria.” Driving along the Wolfgangsee, our trip will bring us to Bad Ischl. We will reach one of the highlights of our tour, Hallstatt “the pearl of the Lake District”. You can choose to take the railway funicular up the mountain for a panoramic view above the town. This is probably the most spectacular viewing platform in the Alps. The pure white snow is stunningly draped over the old wooden houses, mountains surround the glassy lake, icicles hang from the roofs, and the Christmas lights twinkle. It is simply magic.\n\nThis day is reserved for exploring the old town of Vienna, “the capital of Austria”. Our experienced local guide will walk you through the charming, historical Vienna center. Enjoy a visit to the city’s highlights: Hofburg Palace, the Vienna State Opera, the Parliament Building, City Hall, Schonbrunn Palace, St Stephen’s Cathedral, Danube Tower, Belvedere Palace, and Mozart Memorial. The Christmas markets in Vienna are an age-old tradition. The aroma of Christmas baking, hot punch and toasted almonds hangs in the air. The Old City and shopping streets are decorated with festive lights that create a Christmas atmosphere in Vienna.\n\nToday is the last day of our tour, the departure day. Your guide will drive you to Vienna Airport with a complimentary transfer. We Wish You a safe journey back home and hope that you will have a great memory of these days spent with us!"
