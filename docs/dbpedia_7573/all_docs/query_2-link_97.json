        "text": "If you’re itching for a unique winter getaway, let me spill the beans on why Croatia should be on your radar. Forget about the crowds and high prices—visiting Croatia in winter is where it’s at. Trust me, as a local who loves to explore Croatia during the off-season, I’ve uncovered some hidden gems to share with you in my travel guide.\n\nChoose from skiing down powdery slopes, getting your hands on juicy mandarins fresh from the trees, and wandering through charming Christmas markets. Croatia has it all, even when the temperatures drop and the European winter sets in.\n\nIs A Trip To Croatia In Winter A Good Idea?\n\nSure, Croatia is renowned for its summer splendor, attracting hordes of beach-loving travelers. That said, from frozen waterfalls to enchanting landscapes, Croatia transforms into a captivating winter wonderland.\n\nHere’s the scoop on why this European gem should be on your radar for a chilly season getaway.\n\nHere are six reasons why I think that a winter trip to Croatia is a great idea.\n\n1. Scenic Winter Landscapes\n\nWinter transforms Croatia’s already stunning landscapes into serene, snow-dusted wonderlands. Walking through Plitvice Lakes National Park during the colder months, with its waterfalls and lakes surrounded by snow-covered trees, is downright magical. It’s a quieter, more peaceful version of the natural beauty you’d see in the summer.\n\n2. Cultural Exploration Without The Crowds\n\nCroatian cities like Split take on a whole new charm in winter. You can wander the historic, medieval streets without the summer crowds, making it feel like you’ve got the place to yourself. The architecture stands out more, and the vibe is just different—more intimate and authentic.\n\n3. Festive Christmas Markets\n\nThe Christmas markets, especially in Zagreb, are a highlight. They’re full of twinkling lights, delicious smells of mulled wine and holiday treats, and rows of stalls selling unique crafts. It’s a festive experience that perfectly captures the holiday spirit, Croatian style.\n\n4. Winter Sports And Adventure\n\nCroatia’s winter landscape offers plenty of opportunities for those who love a bit of adventure. Whether tobbogoning in Gorski Kotar or snowboarding near Zagreb, you’ll find exciting ways to enjoy the snow without the long lines and high prices of more well-known ski destinations.\n\n5. Culinary Delights\n\nWinter is the perfect time to dive into Croatian cuisine, which is all about hearty and comforting dishes. From sarma (meat-filled cabbage rolls) to rich stews, the cooler weather is your excuse to indulge in the country’s delicious, warming foods.\n\n6. Value For Money\n\nTraveling in the off-peak season means your money goes further. You’ll find better deals on accommodation and flights, plus you’ll enjoy attractions without the peak season price hikes. It’s a budget-friendly way to enjoy what Croatia has to offer.\n\nBest Things To Do & Places To Visit In Croatia\n\nSo, I’ve sold you on the idea that Croatia in January or February is worth visiting, right? Here is what to see if you plan a trip to Croatia during winter this year.\n\nVisit Plitvice Lakes National Park & It’s Frozen Waterfalls\n\nWhile the beaches are the most popular destinations during the summer, there are other unique sites to see in the winter. A great example is the iconic lakes and waterfalls of Plitvice Lakes National Park. The place transforms into a winter wonderland as the lakes freeze over – it is the perfect winter visit.\n\nThey are dreamy and astounding, just like a scene you might expect to see in the movie Frozen. Plitvice Lakes National Park is open all year round and is one of Croatia’s star attractions – and in winter, the entrance tickets are around 70% cheaper. Yay.\n\nAs gorgeous as the park is in summer, I wouldn’t say I like it; with so many people, you feel like you’ll be pumped off the boardwalk at any moment. Whereas in winter, it’s magical and wonderfully empty.\n\nA visit to a frozen-over Plitvice Lakes National Park is one of the most incredible things to do in Croatia – trust me.\n\nSkiing & Snow In Croatia\n\nDoes it snow in Croatia?\n\nYou bet it does!\n\nIn winter, Croatia becomes an inexpensive place to ski. Head to the Mèdvednica mountain range (1000 meters of elevation), north of Zagreb, one of Croatia’s top winter sports destinations. In addition to skiing, Croatia also offers fun tobogganing and sledding, which are super popular among kids.\n\nThere are several different places in Croatia where you can enjoy winter sports, such as skiing, sledding, tobogganing, Nordic skiing, or ice skating.\n\nYou can strap on the skis or skates at these top Croatian winter sports locations.\n\nSljeme Ski Resort\n\nOne of the top ski resorts in Croatia, the Sljeme Ski Resort, is located on Mèdvednica Mountain’s slopes in Mèdvednica Nature Park. Just 10 km from the Zagreb city center, it attracts locals and tourists alike.\n\nThe main event at this popular ski destination is the annual Snow Queen Trophy, a competition that’s part of the FIS Ski World Cup and occurs every January. Non-professional skiers and winter sports enthusiasts can also enjoy a variety of slopes and runs here. The resort has three lifts and five slopes: White Meadow, White Slope, Red Slope (the most difficult), Green Slope, and Blue Slope.\n\nThe Red Slope has a chairlift and is also equipped with an artificial snowmaker, which prolongs the skiing season.\n\nOn the other hand, the White and Green slopes have T-bar lifts. Most pitches are gentle and suitable for children and those just learning how to ski. The Red and White slopes also have a lighting system, making it possible for skiers to enjoy skiing at night.\n\nPlatak Ski Resort\n\nA popular destination throughout the whole year, Platak’s peak season is winter. Located just north of Rijeka and west of Risnjak National Park, this resort has been around since the mid-1960s, when its first ski lift was built.\n\nThe Platak Ski Resort is near the mountain towns of Snježnik and Risnja. Even though it’s only 10 km from the Croatian coast, snow does cover the area’s tall mountains for much of winter. Platak’s highest peak is Radeševo (1,363 meters above sea level), the ski resort’s longest and most famous trail. In addition to challenging skiing and snowboarding runs, several easier and gentler slopes are perfect for children and beginners.\n\nThere’s even a Baby Trail, equipped with a conveyor belt for kids and tubing and sledding slopes. As one of Croatia’s best ski resorts, Platak is an excellent destination for everyone, from families with small children to recreational and even professional skiers and snowboarders. Non-skiers also visit the area to enjoy its gorgeous winter scenery.\n\nMukinje Ski Resort\n\nLocated near one of Croatia’s most famous natural attractions, Plitvice Lakes, the Mukinje Ski Resort is about 700 meters above sea level and offers you various winter sports.\n\nIt is only 2.5 km from Plitvice Lakes National Park’s Entrance 2 and 5 km from Entrance 1. Experienced skiers, recreationists, beginners, and children can all enjoy the wintry beauty of this part of Croatia.\n\nIn addition to one ski lift with a capacity of 400 people per hour, there are several ski trails, all about 400 meters long.\n\nThe average slope gradient at Mukinje Ski Resort is only 15%, making it a suitable destination for learning to ski or snowboard. Most slopes are also great for sleighing and sledding.\n\nAt the resort, you can also rent all kinds of winter sports equipment, including snowboarding and skiing equipment, toboggan sleds, sleighs, and incredibly fun snow saucers. Everything can be reserved in advance.\n\nČelimbaša Ski Resort\n\nThe Čelimbaša Ski Resort is in Mrkopalj, about 15 km from Delnice. Located at an elevation of 1,100 meters, its slopes start at 825 meters above sea level, while its drag lift is about 700 meters long and has a capacity of 600 skiers per hour.\n\nThis resort has three different ski trails, all of which have different lengths. The longest of the three, the Tourist Trail, is 1,400 meters long and has the gentlest grade. Tobogganing is possible here, too. The Sunny Trail is roughly 1,000 meters long, while the Black Path is 500 meters long and the ski resort’s steepest run.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for an alternative winter sports destination to the popular resorts of France, Italy, and Switzerland, consider visiting Croatia in winter.\n\nBrands We Use And Trust\n\nTake A Winter Trip To Croatia To Harvest Mandarins In Neretva\n\nThe Neretva Valley is known as the “garden of Dubrovnik” for good reasons. This verdant and fertile valley has been a fruit-growing region since the 1400s, and now the orchards are busier and more productive than ever. It’s said that there are about 1.3 million mandarin seedlings in the valley, which explains its other nickname—the “mandarin valley.”\n\nThe mandarin harvesting season starts in the fall but runs well into the winter. It makes for a fantastic day trip from Dubrovnik in winter, an ideal activity to stock up on vitamin C before the coldest winter days arrive. Even if you’re visiting Croatia in December, you can still head over and grab some fresh citrus fruit.\n\nVisit Croatia Without The Crowds\n\nOh, but where to start? There are just so darn many places to choose from, especially if you’re visiting the coast.\n\nHere is my list of places to visit to get you started.\n\nWinter In Dubrovnik\n\nThe “Pearl of the Adriatic” needs no introduction, but it’s a different experience in winter. With smaller crowds, you can take your time while exploring the centuries-old city walls and narrow alleys.\n\nThe historic sites, such as the majestic Fort Lovrijenac and Dubrovnik Cathedral, are more accessible, allowing you to appreciate their grandeur without the usual hustle and bustle. Don’t forget to warm up with a cup of local mulled wine from the charming cafes scattered throughout the city.\n\nZadar At Wintertime\n\nEscape the typical summer tourist crowds and discover Zadar’s winter allure – which also happens to be my hometown.\n\nStart your exploration with the Sea Organ, an enchanting musical instrument powered by the sea’s waves. As the waves crash against the stone steps, delightful melodies fill the air.\n\nAnother must-see is the Greeting to the Sun installation, a mesmerizing display of lights that dances beneath your feet. Take a leisurely walk along the waterfront promenade up to Five Well Square, where you’ll find us locals at the restaurant eating a hearty Croatian lunch for cheap.\n\nWinter In Split\n\nWhile Split’s Diocletian’s Palace is an iconic destination, it’s even more magical in winter when all you see are locals.\n\nExplore the ancient sites, marvel at the well-preserved architecture, and enjoy the peace that descends upon this historical site during the colder months. Afterward, wander through the quaint streets of the Old Town, discovering hidden shops and bustling local markets. Don’t forget to try “fritule” – small doughnut-like pastries – a delectable winter treat from the Advent street vendors.\n\nRovinj At Wintertime\n\nKnown for its colorful buildings and charming streets, Rovinj is a coastal gem that genuinely shines in winter. Stroll through the cobbled alleys lined with galleries, boutiques, and local artisan shops.\n\nVisit the St. Euphemia Church, perched atop a hill, and enjoy panoramic views of the picturesque town and the shimmering Adriatic Sea. Warm up with a cup of hot chocolate in a cozy café, savoring the calm and serenity of this hidden winter oasis.\n\nWintery Trogir\n\nOne of the prettiest small coastal towns in Dalmatia, Trogir, is an ancient stone town that gets overrun by tourists in summer. Located a quick drive from Split, this UNESCO World Heritage-listed town makes for one of the top sights in Croatia in winter, just because it’s super-quiet this time of year. It’s that breathtaking.\n\nEven though many stores and restaurants close for the season, a visit is still worth it, perhaps even more so.\n\nLike Dubrovnik to the south, Trogir returns to its authentic self in winter. Locals come out, and tourists stay away, offering a more “real” experience of wandering the streets by yourself. This is when you can start a conversation with locals much more easily than in summer when the town is super-crowded and everyone’s more stressed.\n\nYou can spend the morning sipping coffee at the main square, surrounded by locals, and the rest of the day wandering about the stone core of the town and along its stunning harbor.\n\nExperience The Dubrovnik Winter Festival\n\nI know I already mentioned Dubrovnik, but you should think about the Dubrovnik Winter Festival specifically. It is the wintry counterpart of the super-popular Dubrovnik Summer Festival.\n\nThis multi-day festival, which runs from Advent into the New Year, provides tons of fun for young and old. This cultural feast features various events and loads of entertainment all across the Old Town of Dubrovnik and beyond. There are Christmas concerts and other musical performances, New Year’s parties for children and adults, and endless food and merriment.\n\nSeveral stalls line Stradun, the Old Town’s main street, selling everything from handicrafts, toys, and Christmas tree decorations to mulled wine and cakes. Of course, thousands of twinkling lights magically illuminate everything, creating an atmosphere unlike any other season.\n\nBest of all, visiting off-season means skipping the summer crowds (I know, I know, I keep reminding you of that!) so you can make the most of your time in the city!\n\nCroatia For Christmas & Stroll Advent Markets\n\nSome of my best memories of Croatia in winter are from the Advent festivities in Zagreb, Croatia’s vibrant capital. In December, Christmas and Advent markets spring up all over the country, from Zagreb to Zadar, Opatija, and from Split to Dubrovnik.\n\nIndeed, this is the most magical time of the year, and we can’t imagine a more atmospheric month for a Croatia vacation than this.\n\nSo, think again if you only think of Croatia as a beach destination. The country has much more to offer, even during winter.\n\nHead to King Tomislav Square, where you’ll see an enormous ice skating rink at the ready. After taking a twirl around the arena, head to the small markets in Croatia to pick up last-minute handcrafted Christmas gifts.\n\nIf you ever need reasons to visit Croatia in winter, these glorious Christmas markets are one of the main ones.\n\nSoak In Hot Springs\n\nThere’s no better way to escape the low temperature in Croatia in January than soaking in a natural hot tub. Another fabulous option when visiting Croatia in winter is one of its natural hot springs and, of course, the thermal spas built around them. The rates at these resorts are usually excellent during the off-season, so why not try them?\n\nMost of the thermal spas in Croatia have been used since Roman times, so you might absorb some history while soaking up the mineral-rich hot waters. The thermal spas offer reasonably priced luxury accommodations during winter and will even throw in extra services!\n\nReputable spas include:\n\nSveti Martin na Muri\n\nTuhelj\n\nStubičke Toplice\n\nKrapinske Toplice\n\nVaraždinske Toplice\n\nDaruvarske Toplice\n\nGo To The Beach\n\nOkay, it is winter in Croatia, but that doesn’t mean a beach visit is out of the question. Although Croatia’s winter temperatures might be too low for a swim or an afternoon of sunbathing, winter days can still be delightful.\n\nOn a sunny winter day, you can easily pull up a chair on the beach and soak up the sights, sounds, and smells of the gorgeous Adriatic Sea or pass a few hours with a good book.\n\nOn top of that, the huge summer crowds are nowhere to be seen in winter. Being on the beach in Croatia with only a few other people present, how often is that possible in Croatia nowadays?\n\nCroatia In February Means Carnival Time\n\nSpeaking of January, if you are in Croatia at this time of the year, you might want to attend the Rijeka Carnival, one of the largest carnival festivals in Europe.\n\nConcerts, exhibitions, masquerades, and parties follow the ceremonial handing over of the city’s keys to the Master of the Carnival, leading to a large international masked festival in February.\n\nCelebrate Valentine’s Day In Croatia With Your Other Half\n\nFebruary 14, the global day of love, falls in the middle of winter. And guess what? Croatia is an incredible place to visit for romantic getaways, intimate seaside dinners, couple’s activities, and much more, even in February.\n\nWinter in Croatia has lots to offer to couples. Thanks to the country’s stunning old cities, such as Zadar, Split, Trogir, and Dubrovnik, you’ll have plenty of choices for a Valentine’s Day destination.\n\nEnjoy amazing winter sunsets, soak in hot springs, pamper yourself with a spa treatment, and indulge in mouthwatering Croatian food.\n\nWinter Weather In Croatia\n\nWhen winter arrives in Croatia, it brings with it a unique mix of weather across its different regions. Let’s take a closer look at the weather patterns in each area so you’ll be well-prepared for your winter adventures, whether you’re seeking coastal charm or exploring the central and northern parts of the country.\n\nCoastal Croatia\n\nAlong the stunning Coastal Croatia, you can expect average daytime highs around 12°C (53.6°F) and nighttime lows of 5°C (41°F). These temperatures create a pleasant atmosphere, perfect for leisurely strolls along the seafront promenades or sipping hot beverages at cozy cafes while basking in the refreshing breeze.\n\nCentral Croatia\n\nMeanwhile, in Central Croatia, winters can be a touch chillier. During the day, temperatures typically reach around 4°C (39.2°F), while at night, they dip to an average of -1°C (30.2°F). It’s good to pack some warm layers to bundle up as you explore.\n\nNorthern Croatian\n\nHeading towards the north, winters in Northern Croatia can give you a genuine taste of the colder side of the season. During the daytime, temperatures hover around 3°C (37.4°F) while dropping to an average low of -3°C (26.6°F) after sundown. Be sure to bring your winter coat, hat, and gloves.\n\nEastern Croatia\n\nIn Eastern Croatia, the winter climate strikes a balance between the chillier north and milder coastal areas. Plan for daytime highs around 5°C (41°F) and nighttime lows of -2°C (28.4°F)\n\nIstria\n\nLast but not least, Istria invites you to experience its winter wonders, offering a blend of natural beauty, historic towns, and excellent gastronomy.

With mild temperatures like these, you can comfortably explore the enchanting towns and countryside, indulging in local delicacies along the way.\n\nNote: remember to check the weather forecast closer to your visit, as temperatures can fluctuate and surprise you.
