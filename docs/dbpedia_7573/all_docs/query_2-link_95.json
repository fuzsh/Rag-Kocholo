We'd hire a car b/w Split and Zagreb and maybe tour something in between. Based on research it looks like weather would be @ 60F/15C on the coast and a bit cooler in Zagreb. It also could we be wet around the coast.\n\nQuestions for the forum:\n\nAre the cities still predominantly open during the off season?\n\nIs this still a decent time to visit these cities?\n\nAre we spending enough time in each place?\n\nOther ideas for an itinerary in the region?"
