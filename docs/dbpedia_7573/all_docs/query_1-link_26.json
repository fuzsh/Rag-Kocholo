        "text": "Having lived in Croatia for over a year, one of the big questions I hear is “is it worth visiting Zagreb?”\n\nI know most people associate Croatia with the stunning Adriatic Coast and are probably considering a holiday to Croatia for the beaches and coastal attractions. But if you have longer or perhaps you’re visiting out of season (or maybe you’re just not a beach person!) then you might be wondering, is Zagreb worth seeing?\n\nHaving been to Zagreb at least 6 times now (I’ve lost count), I’ve come to love the city so much and really do encourage you to visit if you’re able to. It’s walkable, the Old Town is beautiful, it’s well connected and there’s plenty to do.\n\nRead on to find out why I recommend visiting Zagreb.\n\nIs Zagreb expensive to visit?\n\nIs Zagreb worth a visit if you’re on a budget? I think being able to stick to a budget is more doable when you visit Zagreb compared to the coast of Croatia where the prices can fluctuate extensively during the summer.\n\nBeing the capital city, prices are of course higher than a rural location, but they aren’t as high as Dubrovnik or Split and the “tourist tax” doesn’t seem to exist in the same way as it does on the coast - or at least not noticeably.\n\nI definitely spent less on a weekend in Zagreb vs. a weekend in Dubrovnik!\n\nBut as always it depends on your choice of accommodation, what activities and Zagreb attractions you want to see and the time of year you visit.\n\n2. The architecture is unique and completely different from the coast\n\nCroatia has a real mix of architecture due to its complex and varied history. If you visit the coast, you’ll see the Venetian influences, with everything built from the nearby sandstone and the almost palatial influences of the Diocletian Palace in Split. Or the colourful, compact houses of Rovinj, reminiscent of Venice and Burano.\n\nGo down to Dubrovnik and you’ll see more Gothic and Renaissance influences.\n\nBut in Zagreb, you can see the inland influences of nearby Austria, Germany, Slovenia and Hungary in the streets and buildings - they’re colourful and compact but you really feel like you’re closer to western Europe with mountains and wooden houses more common.\n\n4. The food scene is great\n\nAgain it’s to be expected that there’s a more diverse food scene in the capital, but as two people who LOVE Asian cuisines, especially Korean and Japanese, we really missed having a good choice of restaurants in Split with those cuisines.\n\nThe food choice in Zagreb is epic. Don’t miss traditional Strukle from La Struk in the old town. Get epic Asian street food at Kai Street Food. Or try Croatian street food from Heritage. We also love Torikaya Ramen Bar and Byblos Lebanese Restaurant.\n\nThey also have a great drinks scene, as someone who loves craft beer, I’ve visited the Garden Brewery every time we’ve visited Zagreb!\n\nUnlike the coastal cities which are incredibly seasonal, Zagreb is open and thriving all year round.\n\nFlights to Split, Dubrovnik and Zadar stop completely to places like the UK, with only a couple of flights a day either to other Croatian destinations or to Germany or Amsterdam.\n\nWe were so surprised how much Split changes in the winter, cafes, bars and restaurants just shut for half the year and while the locals seem to reclaim the city after tourist season is over, it’s definitely not as easy to book a trip to Split or Dubrovnik in the winter.\n\nIs Zagreb safe? In a word, yes.\n\nThis is applicable to the whole of Croatia but the country is so incredibly safe with low crime rates, even in the capital city where you would expect there to be more crime, I’ve found it welcoming, comfortable and safe to visit all year round, both solo, with girlfriends and with my partner.\n\nSo if you’re wondering, is Zagreb a good place to visit from a safety perspective, I think definitely! Of course take all the usual precautions as you would when visiting anywhere.\n\n7. Great connections both nationally and internationally\n\nZagreb’s airport is open and running all year round with connections all over the world. But Zagreb train station is also incredibly well connected, being on one of the main rail routes in Europe and one that’s popular on Interrail routes.\n\nIn fact, the first time I came to Zagreb was 2015 on an interrail trip when I took the train from Budapest to Zagreb and then onwards to Belgrade in Serbia.\n\nYou can also take easy day trips by train to Ljubljana or overnight trains even to Paris!\n\nAnother epic day trip for skiers and snow lovers is to the mountains and ski resorts close to Zagreb.\n\nBut even if you’re not a skier, you can see snow in Zagreb during winter, or head to Plitvice Lakes in winter to see a truly magical scene - I’ve never seen so much snow in my life! But interestingly it’s not that cold, we didn’t see much below -5C so it was very easy to keep warm with the right clothes - hiking and taking the boat in Plitvice in the snow was magical.\n\nThe whole northern inland area of Croatia, above the Velebit Mountain range gets a substantial amount of snow each winter - something I had no idea about until we visited Croatia, but we definitely loved the snowy contrast with the fair weather on the coast!"
