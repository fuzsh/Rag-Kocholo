        "text": "The Croatian capital, Zagreb, is a gorgeous historical metropolis that’s worth visiting year-round.\n\nWhile it’s not quite as famous as other destinations in the country like Dubrovnik and Hvar, the capital is brimming with historical attractions, quirky museums and plenty of places to grab some amazing food.\n\nThe best bit? All of these points of interest are accessible and available in Zagreb in winter.\n\nWhether you’re visiting in the holiday season or want a budget break in January or February, Zagreb still has plenty on offer outside of peak season!\n\nHere’s a full guide to visiting Zagreb in the winter by Andrej, our Balkans expert.\n\nThis blog post may contain affiliate links.\n\nWhat’s Zagreb like in winter?\n\nZagreb is the capital and the biggest city in Croatia, so the atmosphere is great during winter.\n\nWith the temperatures dropping, the historic city center also gets quieter and more peaceful, enabling you to see attractions without other hordes of tourists!\n\nPlus, you’ll probably find the best-value flights and luxury accommodation options for a fraction of the price outside of summer.\n\nWhile the capital isn’t the most popular compared to other Croatian cities, it’s a great winter city break.\n\nThere’s plenty of museums, historical attractions, beautiful day trips and amazing food to enjoy when you’re visiting Zagreb in winter!\n\nIf you’re exploring more of the country, check out the best places to visit in Croatia in winter!\n\nWhat’s the weather like in Zagreb in winter?\n\nEven though Croatia is known as a warm summer destination, Zagreb’s non-coastal position means that it can get very cold in winter.\n\nIf you want winter sun, I’d recommend heading further down the coast in Croatia to Dubrovnik.\n\nThe temperature is generally between 0°C and 10°C throughout most of the winter but sometimes goes under 0°C in December and January.\n\nThe country also gets a lot of rain and snow in winter, with around 20-25 days of snow per year, mostly during December and January, whereas rain is more present in other months.\n\nIt’s also quite windy in winter, so make sure to be well-prepared for that too.\n\nWhen you’re creating your packing list, it might be a good idea to add an umbrella, waterproofs and plenty of layers, so you can enjoy all of these Zagreb winter attractions without the weather being too disruptive!\n\nThings to do in Zagreb in winter\n\nZagreb Cathedral\n\nZagreb’s Cathedral of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin Mary is the most popular tourist attraction in the city, and it’s not hard to see why.\n\nIt’s located less than five minutes from the city’s traditional European square and can be seen from almost anywhere in the capital.\n\nThe main features of the Cathedral are the twin towers which were added by famous architect Hermann Bollé in the 1880 rebuild (after it was hit by an earthquake).\n\nThe towers, as well as the interior, were built in a neo-gothic style.\n\nIt’s also the resting place of Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac, whose effigy can be found resting on a platform behind the main altar.\n\nIf you’re walking around Zagreb and getting a little chilly, it’s definitely worth ducking in here to see the incredible architecture.\n\nMuseum of Broken Relationships\n\nWhen most people think about museums, they usually consider them to be places that hold valuable and important objects from the past.\n\nWell, the Museum of Broken Relationships is a bit different. It was established in 2010 (by two exes, Olinka Vištica and Dražen Grubišić!) and won the reward for the most innovative museum at the European Museum awards in 2011.\n\nThe museum is ideal for people who have just experienced a breakup, with installments from people in Zagreb and further afield about their own broken relationships!\n\nAll of the objects in the museum have been donated by members of the public, and include a love letter stuck to glass and smashed into tiny pieces and a simple toothbrush. Every relic has a backstory about why it’s ended up in the museum.\n\nThe museum is also located in a beautiful Baroque mansion, so it’s definitely worth a visit.\n\nGrič Tunnel Bomb Shelter\n\nGrič Tunnel is both a tourist destination and the perfect place to warm up a bit if it’s too cold outside!\n\nIt was used as a bomb shelter during WW2 but has now been transformed into an attraction thanks to its history and beautiful street murals which can be found on each of its entrances.\n\nYou can also find a lot of old signage on the walls of the 350-meter-long tunnel, as well as a central hall where different exhibitions are held.\n\nIt’s said that one of Croatia’s first raves took place here in the 1990s!\n\nYou can visit the tunnel every day from 9 am to 9 pm.\n\nZagreb Christmas Market\n\nIf you’re looking to try some of Zagreb’s Christmas specialties and buy a souvenir or two, you must visit the famous Christmas Market.\n\nIt is a part of a Christmas festival known as Advent in Zagreb, one of the best winter festivals in Europe.\n\nIt was even voted as the best one for three years straight, in 2016, 2017, and 2018.\n\nAdvent lasts from early November to early January and features various activities, such as cultural performances, light displays, and of course the market.\n\nThe market helps Zagreb enjoy the holiday spirit even on cold days – plus this makes it one of the best places to visit in Europe at Christmas!\n\nIf you want to get in the festive mood while in the city, don’t miss a Christmas market visit – and you can also read my blog post about all of the best Christmas markets in Europe.\n\nLotrščak Tower\n\nAccessed by a narrow flight of stairs, Lotrščak Tower leads to a viewing platform where you can enjoy breathtaking vistas of Zagreb.\n\nYou’ll see many of the city’s best buildings, one of which is the colorful roof of St. Mark’s Church. It is one of the oldest buildings in Zagreb, dating back to the 13th century and featuring a beautiful interior – although the main attraction is its roof.\n\nSt. Mark’s Church roof was designed by Viennese architect Friedrich Schmidt and it has two emblems, one for the city of Zagreb, and the other for the Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia.\n\nIt’s worth looking for St. Mark’s Church when you’re at ground level too!\n\nYou can also see the Cathedral from Lotrščak Tower.\n\nTkalčićeva\n\nTkalčićeva is Zagreb’s main street for partying and eating!\n\nIt’s a long road filled with numerous bars and restaurants serving traditional Croatian cuisine and other European dishes.\n\nSome of the food which you must try include sarma (stuffed grape or cabbage leaves), rastika (a Croatian soup), cevapi (ground meat sausages) and Zagrebački strukli (stuffed dough), all with some ajvar (red pepper sauce) on the side.\n\nMost Croatian dishes have a big focus on meat, but if you’re veggie try Abšmalcane mahune which is a dish made from green beans. There are also plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Zagreb – you can search for them on Happy Cow.\n\nTkalčićeva’s nightlife is vibrant thanks to many cafes which turn into clubs after sunset.\n\nThe most popular one is the Funk Bar, which is a cafe that transforms into a DJ basement and offers banging tunes throughout the night.\n\nCroatian National Theatre\n\nRegarded as one of the most important cultural places in the country, the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb has to be on your visiting list if you’re into art.\n\nIt was established in 1895 by the Habsburg Emperor Franz Josef in a beautiful neo-baroque style building.\n\nIt features all sorts of art performances including opera, drama, and ballet, which are hosted all year long.\n\nThe theatre is very popular so you have to pre-book a ticket to secure your seat, but with tickets being really cheap (around 8-10 euros), it is definitely worthwhile.\n\nHrelić Flea Market\n\nIf you’re in Zagreb and you need basically anything, visit the flea market at Hrelić.\n\nIt has everything you may need, from vintage clothing to traditional souvenirs and even car parts and, if you’re looking for a really niche souvenir, portraits of Tito.\n\nPrices are extremely low so you’re sure to get a good deal on whatever you buy.\n\nThe market is located near the Sava River and it is open on Sundays from 7 am until noon, but it’s best if you arrive early to make sure the stuff you want doesn’t sell out.\n\nStone Gate\n\nLeft as the only remaining of the 5 gates of Zagreb, the Stone Gate is a popular tourist destination. It’s also a place where locals come to light candles and pray to the Virgin Mary.\n\nWhile going through the gate, you can also see messages of thankfulness written on the walls.\n\nThe gate is famous for surviving numerous fires, along with the statue of the Virgin Mary which was left untouched during all of them, and inspired many stories.\n\nOn the entrance to the gate, you can also find a blue-green star on top, which was believed to not allow witches in!\n\nPark Maksimir\n\nWhen you get tired of exploring the city, and just want to relax and spend time in nature, Park Maksimir should be your number one choice.\n\nThis green space is the largest park in the city, and it also has a pond and a couple of coffee shops, which are perfect to help you stay warm on a cold winter day.\n\nIt’s a bit further from the center of the city, so taking a tram or a city bus is recommended.\n\nWinter day trips from Zagreb\n\nPlitvice Lakes National Park\n\nPlitvice Lakes National Park is hands down the most beautiful in Croatia, especially during winter, and it’s a bucket list destination for most travellers to the country.\n\nIt is located a few hours away from Zagreb, so you have to take a bus or go there by car (or you can do a guided tour!), but the views make it worthwhile.\n\nIt has 16 smaller lakes which usually freeze during winter, creating a fairytale-like sight of frozen lakes surrounded by layers of snow.\n\nThere are also a couple of restaurants where you can sit and enjoy nature, making it a perfect one day trip from Zagreb.\n\nClick here to book a day trip to Plitvice Lakes National Park.\n\nLjubljana and Bled day trip\n\nAfter exploring Zagreb and experiencing Croatian culture, you might want to take a road trip to Slovenia and visit Ljubljana and Bled.\n\nThanks to Zagreb’s position in Northern Croatia, it’s easy to hop across the border to Slovenia!\n\nDay trips include transport to and from Slovenia, plus a tour guide who will tell you about the history and importance of these two places.\n\nYou’ll also have some free time to explore the locations yourself.\n\nClick here to book a Ljubljana and Bled day trip.\n\nSki resort Sljeme\n\nCroatia isn’t known as a country full of ski resorts, but there are a couple of them close to Zagreb.\n\nThe nearest is the Ski Resort Sljeme. It’s only 19 kilometers away from Zagreb so you can easily get there by taxi.\n\nIt’s not the biggest ski resort, as it only has around five kilometers of ski slopes, but they are of a range of difficulties. It’s also quite cheap, with lift passes being less than 15 euros!\n\nWhat to pack for Zagreb in winter\n\nIf you’re visiting Zagreb in the cooler months, include these items on your packing list:\n\na thick coat, scarf, gloves and a hat – you might be in sunny Croatia, but it can be very chilly!\n\ncomfortable shoes or boots\n\na camera or smartphone that takes decent photos\n\nwhatever toiletries you usually use – although you can purchase them in Zagreb (DM is a great toiletry shop in Central and South East Europe!)\n\nan EU adaptor\n\nWhere to stay in Zagreb in winter\n\nAs Zagreb is the Croatian capital, hotels tend to stay open outside of peak season.
