        "text": "This post covers when it snows in New York, and how much snow to expect in any given month.\n\nWe also provide tips on things to do, and how to dress for the snow and cold.\n\nAs a retired meteorologist turned tour guide, I didn't expect that I would use my experience as a forecaster in my new career in tourism.\n\nBut here I am, finding myself answering more weather questions as a blogger than I ever did as a weatherman.\n\nSo, here are answers to some frequently asked questions about when it snows in NYC and what you should expect.\n\nOverview\n\nSnowfall by Month\n\nThis Winter's Prediction\n\nHow to Dress\n\nThings to Do in the Cold\n\nWhen is it Best to Visit NYC\n\nIN WHICH MONTH DOES IT START TO SNOW IN NEW YORK?\n\nTypically, it starts to snow in New York in December and the snow season stops in early March.\n\nJanuary and February are the two most likely months to have snow in New York.\n\nDecember and March are not big snow months, but you should be prepared to deal with snow during these two months as well.\n\nWhile it's possible to snow as early as November and as late as April, snowfall in these months is extremely unlikely.\n\nSnowfall is certainly not of concern from May through October, outside of the extremely rare occurrence.\n\nA few things to consider about the averages and stats that we provide in the content below.\n\nThese Are Averages\n\nThe snowfall amounts are averages and actual snowfall can range quite a bit.\n\nIn some years, NYC gets little to no snowfall, sometimes for even several years in a row. The opposite is also true.\n\nCheck out our predictions for Winter 2024-25.\n\nThe City Can Handle the Snow\n\nMuch to the chagrin of the city's students, NYC knows how to deal with snow, even heavy snow.\n\nSnow removal teams are coordinated and dispatched with ruthless efficiency.\n\nBoth roads and sidewalks are usually clear of snow and ice just hours after a storm.\n\nGo to a Museum\n\nWith the exception of the times around Christmas and Easter, snowfall usually coincides with tourist low periods.\n\nThis means that NYC's museums are near empty relative to the high season, particularly on weekdays.\n\nThere are enough indoor attractions and museums to keep you busy.\n\nAnd, did you know that many NYC museums are free or offer pay-what-you-like days? Read about them here.\n\nYou could also listen to our NYC Travel Tips podcast episode on the pros and cons of visiting NYC in each of the 4 seasons.\n\nThis podcast offers bite-sized audio clips with tips on how to plan your trip to NYC. You can get our podcast wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nNYC HOTEL DEALS ON TRIPADVISOR – If you haven’t already booked your accommodations.\n\nSNOWFALL IN DECEMBER\n\nUnlike November, when snow is fairly rare, snow in December usually occurs on about 2-3 days during the month with 1 day, on average, receiving a snowfall of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or more.\n\nHeavier snowfalls of 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more occur only once every other year.\n\nHistorically in New York City, December has seen a very large range in snowfalls from one year to the next.\n\nDecember snow totals have ranged from only a trace of snow to nearly 30 inches (76 cm).\n\nHowever, the long-term average is closer to 5 inches (13 cm).\n\nThe risk for snow in December increases throughout the month with the end of the month about 3x more likely to see snow than at the beginning of the month.\n\nRegardless, you are more likely to deal with freezing rain than snow in December. Be sure to check out our full NYC December weather post.\n\nJANUARY SNOWFALL IN NYC\n\nIn January, snow falls on about 4 days on average with 2 days normally seeing snowfalls of at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) and one day getting 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more.\n\nIn the past, January has seen as little as 0 inches to as much as 36 inches (92 cm), however, the long-term average is about 7 inches.\n\nIt's important to mention that there are likely to be more rainy days than snowy days in January.\n\nWaterproof boots or shoes are a must, as the sidewalks can be slippery due to a mix of snow and rain.\n\nBe sure to check out our NYC January weather post.\n\nFEBRUARY SNOWFALL IN NYC\n\nFebruary is usually the snowiest month in New York City with snowfalls occurring on 3-4 days.\n\nTwo of these days will record 1 inch (2.5 cm) or more and 1 day will record 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more.\n\nPast Februaries have seen total snowfalls from as little as a trace to almost 37 inches (94 cm).\n\nHowever, the long-term average is just over 9 inches (23 cm).\n\nAs with January, there are more rainy days than snowy days in February, with 7-8 days of precipitation.\n\nCheck out our February NYC weather post for more details.\n\nMARCH SNOWFALL NYC\n\nDuring March the snowfall risk tends to decrease rapidly.\n\nHowever, on average, you can still expect 2 days with some snow and 1 day with a snowfall of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or more.\n\nSnowfalls of 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more occur only about once every other year.\n\nPast years have seen snowfall totals for March ranging from 0 inches to almost 31 inches (79 cm)\n\nHowever, the average snowfall in March is about 4 inches (10 cm).\n\nThe risk for snow is highest near the beginning of the month and drops significantly by month’s end.\n\nCheck out our March NYC weather post for more details.\n\nHOW MUCH SNOW IN NYC THIS WINTER?\n\nAs we mentioned above, there are many factors determining how much snow and precipitation, in general, will fall in NYC during any given winter.\n\nAnd predictions for any particular snow event aren't accurate until approximately 2 weeks out.\n\nNOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) does not forecast seasonal snowfall amounts.\n\nHowever, the best snowfall estimate for this winter in the Big Apple is for near-normal totals.\n\nThe average winter snowfall in New York City is about 25 inches.\n\nSo, Ocean Weather Services is predicting that the 2024-25 winter in New York City will most likely be between 22 and 27 inches.\n\nEarly forecasts predict precipitation in NYC this winter to be at usual levels.\n\nEarly indications suggest winter temperatures will be warmer than normal across the eastern part of the United States, which includes NYC.\n\nAs winter advances warm ocean temperatures along the US East Coast may intensify coastal storms and produce locally heavy snow events over the US Northeast during mid to late winter.\n\nWHAT TO WEAR IN THE WINTER IN NYC\n\nWinter in New York City requires warmth and waterproofing.\n\nWe write in detail about winter packing on our Winter Packing List, but you can find the highlights for what to wear in the winter in NYC listed here:\n\nDisclosure: While our recommendations are always unbiased, we may receive a small share of sales through some of the links as an Amazon Affiliate below at no cost to you.

Waterproof Jacket\n\nCamel Crown has affordable 3 in 1 winter hiking jackets that come in men's and women's cuts for the trifecta of winter wear: warm, waterproof, and stylish.\n\n2.

Umbrella\n\nA small portable compact umbrella that fits in small bags will help keep you dry whether it is rain or snow.\n\n4. Winter Accessories\n\nWarm wool socks are a must.\n\nA scarf is essential. You can pick from 45 different colors for an Achillea Pashmina (or get a reversible one for more outfits!)\n\nA warm hat and gloves.\n\n5. Extra Warmth\n\nOur biggest tips are always to bring things that serve multiple purposes and for winter travel, you can't do better than a portable charger.\n\nYou never know when you'll find a working and available outlet, so why not find one that does double duty as a hand warmer?\n\nZippo makes a rechargeable handwarmer that also has a USB port to charge your devices.\n\n6. Last, but not least, footwear is an important part of vacationing in a walking city like Manhattan. Waterproof boots or shoes will keep your feet dry.\n\nVivobarefoot Gobi is hands down the best stylish winter boots for traveling,\n\nTHINGS TO DO WHEN IT SNOWS IN NYC\n\nIn our opinion, there's nothing you can't do when it snows, but of course, some things are more appropriate than others.\n\nWe have created things to do posts for each month.
