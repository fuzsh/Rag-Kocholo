        "text": "ZAGREB, 19 December 2023 – The first day of the winter solstice falls on 21 December. It is also the shortest day of the year.\n\nWhilst winter is just about to start, it seems almost certain that there will be no White Christmas in Croatia again this year.\n\nAccording to the forecasts, highs of between 5-15 °C, with sunshine, is expected across the country on Christmas Day with no sign at all of snow on the forecast.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the capital Zagreb will see highs of around 8 °C. On the coast in Split and Dubrovnik it will be dry and sunny with highs of around 14-15 °C.\n\nAccording to meteorologists’ predictions, the chance of snow falling in Croatia for Christmas is not likely.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Zagreb is expected to see a day-time high of 14 °C, whilst in Split and Dubrovnik it will be considerably warmer with highs of around 15 °C with sunshine.\n\nThe best chance of snow in Croatia on Christmas Day is usually in Lika and Gorski Kotar, but this year not even there does it look likely it will be a White Christmas with highs of around 11 °C for the 25th of December.\n\nIn Slavonia in the east there does not look like there will be snow either. Temperatures for most of the area will mirror those in Zagreb over the Christmas period. In Osijek on Christmas Day there will be a high of 14 °C with some sunshine.\n\nTo be declared a ‘White Christmas’ in America, there must be 1 inch or 2 and a half inches of snow cover on the ground at 7 a.m. on Christmas morning. In fact, snow doesn’t even have to fall on Christmas Day itself.\n\nAccording to that criterion, the last White Christmas in Croatia was thirteen years ago in 2007 when Zagreb was adorned with a white blanket of 11 centimetres of thick snow on Christmas morning.\n\nKarlovac had the same morning snow cover, thanks to snow showers on Christmas Eve. There was more snow in Gorski Kotar, a little less in Slavonia, and the least in Lika."
