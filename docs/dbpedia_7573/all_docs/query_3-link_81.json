        "text": "Day 1 AIRPORT – ZAGREB\n\nThe programme can start in Zagreb to see a bit more of the non-GOT Croatia, or in any of the nearby airports like Zadar or Split. Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, will soon be 1000 years old. As a typical Central European town it is comfortable, full of history, charming coffee places, fine restaurants and green parks.\n\nDay 2 ZAGREB – KRKA NATIONAL PARK – ŠIBENIK\n\nStart the day slowly with the visit of the season 4 scenes while enjoying the freshness and the view of the waterfalls. And soak in the first views of the Mediterranean from the walls of Šibenik seen in the 5th season (1).\n\nDay 3 ŠIBENIK – TROGIR – SPLIT\n\nOn the way towards Split you will first stop in the picturesque city of Trogir, also known as the City of Qarth – “The Greatest City that Ever Was or Will Be”. Split is already an impressive town with its own real history. Adding to it all, through this amazing Croatian GOT location you will get to see a mix of both. Split hosted the city of Meereen, The Slave Rebellion and even Daenerys’ Throne Room.\n\nDay 4 SPLIT – MAKARSKA\n\nAnd do you remember Daenerys’ Journey to Meereen? You’ll be able to recreate it, relive it. And enjoy all the beauty of the Croatian coastline – from the shore or from a boat.\n\nHere, if you want, you can prolong your stay and get active at the Croatian coastline.\n\nDay 5 MAKARSKA – STON – TRSTENO – DUBROVNIK\n\nBut why not combine several passions into one? In the little village along the way named Ston, you’ll see a small part of King’s Landing walls while being able to try the best oysters of the world.\n\nHere is something for you if you’re looking for a truly romantic experience in Croatia. Oysters are believed to be a very good aphrodisiac, even more so when pulled from the water fresh and consumed with the view of crystal seas and Dubrovnik in front of you.\n\nDay 6-7 DUBROVNIK – AIRPORT\n\nDubrovnik, better known to the GOT fans as the King’s Landing, has its fair share of incredible GOT sights. You will see The Red Keep, Stairs to the Great Sept of Baelor, a House of the Undying, Spice King’s Palace, the Docks, Littlefinger’s Brothel, the King’s Landing Gates and you’ll even get to sit on the Iron throne. You will be guided by expert guides that have all participated in the filming and have many inside stories to tell. Get ready to see Dubrovnik from a completely different point of view."
