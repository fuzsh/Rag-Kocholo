        "text": "Have you ever considered visiting Croatia in winter?\n\nWinter in Croatia serves up a delightful blend of local charm, cozy ambiance, and festive spirit - minus the throngs of summer tourists. The friendly locals reclaim their cities like Split, Dubrovnik, and Zagreb, creating a welcoming and authentic atmosphere.\n\nImagine paying local prices instead of inflated tourist rates. Sounds good, right? And you'll be greeted by a friendlier, more local vibe as the crowds of summer tourists thin out, giving you a taste of authentic Croatian life. Having lived in Croatia for over a year, this easily made winter in Croatia my favourite time of year!\n\nPlus, with the onset of Advent in late November in Croatia, the country starts decking out for Christmas and by month's end, Christmas Markets are in full swing. Christmas markets amidst palm trees is pretty unique!\n\nHere’s some inspiration for why you should visit Croatia in winter.\n\nWinter travel in Croatia is truly a hidden gem. Gone are the bustling crowds of the summer months, replaced by a calmness that feels more authentic. Even though it's not as warm as the summer, the temperatures are still pleasantly mild on the coast, averaging around 10C even during the day. If you want to see snow though, head inland towards Zagreb and Plitvice National Park for a truly snow-covered winter experience!\n\nYou won't be lounging on the beaches, but there's so much more to enjoy! The food, drinks, and accommodation are a steal, with prices dropping considerably after the tourist season. Local establishments are more than happy to welcome you with open arms, giving you a taste of genuine Croatian hospitality.\n\nCities like Split, Zadar, Pula, Dubrovnik, and Zagreb transform into local hubs, with a friendly atmosphere that's super welcoming. My time spent living in Croatia in winter without the hordes of summer tourists was my favourite time of year during the 15 months we lived there —it's a much more authentic and relaxed experience.\n\nAnd while you might not thinking of Croatia for Christmas Markets in Europe, they still have them and it’s called Advent. Starting from mid-November, Croatia starts getting into the holiday spirit. By the end of the month, you'll find Christmas markets popping up everywhere, adding a magical touch to your winter visit. Imagine sipping hot cocoa under a palm tree, surrounded by vibrant Christmas decorations. It's a unique experience you won't want to miss!\n\nExperiencing Croatia winter weather\n\nIf you're considering a winter trip to Croatia, you can expect a mix of weather patterns, but nothing too severe. The coastal regions, like Split, typically enjoy milder winter temperatures, generally between 10-15°C (50-60°F) during the day and dropping to single figures in the evening.\n\nInland areas can be a bit cooler, often getting as low as 0-5°C (30-40°F) during the night. Particularly inland towards Zagreb and the north of Croatia and in rural areas. We visited Plitvice in January and I’ve never seen so much snow in my life! But it never really dropped below -3C which was pleasant and not uncomfortable! Visiting Croatia in January is a great time to have a snowy winter experience in Plitvice too with the national park ticket prices at their lowest!\n\nSnow in Croatia during winter isn't a common sight along the coast, but it's not entirely off the cards, we had a couple of flurries in Split during December but nothing settled, although we could see it on the mountains. January and February are usually the coldest months of the year.\n\nWe were lucky enough to be in Croatia in December and take a trip to visit the Zagreb Christmas Markets and we go some snow there too which was magical!\n\nCroatia in February and March are more likely to come with rain on the coast. But that said, the weather remains relatively mild compared to much of Europe at this time. So, if you're up for a European winter that isn't too harsh, trying out Croatia could be your best bet!\n\nHow to get to Croatia in winter\n\nIf you’re in the UK, you might notice that direct flights to Croatia are harder to find after the 5th of November. Generally the summer flight routes end on this date to the Croatian coastal destinations. But don't fret, you can easily land at Zagreb and then take a domestic flight or even hire a car to get you anywhere else you fancy in Croatia.\n\nAlternatively if you’re in Europe, perhaps you’re based there or you’re hopping around on a trip in Europe, there are direct flights from other European cities into Split, Dubrovnik, or Rijeka. Here's a list of airports in Europe that can give you a straight shot:\n\nMunich\n\nFrankfurt\n\nDusseldorf\n\nZurich\n\nAmsterdam\n\nRome\n\nDublin (Just for Dubrovnik though)\n\nLondon (Only to Zagreb and Dubrovnik)\n\nFor all other routes, your best bet would be to touchdown in Zagreb and then take a domestic flight.\n\nHopping Over to Croatia from the US in winter\n\nDon't worry my US friends, we've got you covered too.\n\nWhile you might find more budget-friendly deals from European airports, flights to Croatia are still pretty available in winter. I would suggest looking for a flight into Frankfurt, which is a major European hub serviced by Delta and Virgin Airlines.\n\nPlus, we've personally flown from Ft. Lauderdale and Detroit into Frankfurt before. If you're all about those savings, keep in mind that prices are generally lower November-February than the peak season. The accommodations are cheaper too! So this is a great chance for a budget friendly off-season trip as long as you don’t mind some chilly weather!\n\nRijeka, the European Capital of Culture in 2020 hosts numerous cultural events, including the Rijeka Carnival, during the winter months. The city's lively atmosphere and mild climate make it an ideal winter destination.\n\n5. Istria:\n\nThe Istrian peninsula offers picturesque towns like Rovinj and Pula. In the winter, you can enjoy truffle dishes, local wines, and olive oils without the summer tourist rush. The mild coastal climate also makes it an ideal destination.\n\n6. Gorski Kotar:\n\nFor winter sports enthusiasts, Gorski Kotar in the Croatian interior offers skiing and snowboarding opportunities in places like Platak. The region is also known for its pristine nature, making it great for winter hikes.\n\n7. Sveti Martin na Muri:\n\nIf you're looking for relaxation and wellness, Sveti Martin na Muri in northern Croatia is known for its thermal spas. It's a perfect destination for rejuvenating in the warm waters and enjoying spa treatments.\n\n8. Osijek:\n\nOsijek is in eastern Croatia, has a charming Baroque-style Old Town and offers unique winter experiences like ice fishing on the Drava River. The city's cozy cafes and traditional cuisine are also worth exploring.\n\n9. Slavonia:\n\nThe Slavonia region is known for its winter festivals and traditions. You can experience local customs, warm hospitality, and delicious cuisine while exploring charming towns like Đakovo and Vinkovci.\n\n10. Sljeme mountain and ski resorts\n\nPopular with locals but less well-known internationally, this ski resort area in the mountains outside of Zagreb is an affordable and beautiful option for a ski trip to Croatia this winter."
