        "text": "Come with us on our most popular day trip. Discover why million people every year visit this pearl of world's natural heritage that is on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1979.\n\nJoin us on our most popular day trip. Discover why million people every year visit this pearl of world's natural heritage that is on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1979. Experience a unique blend of continental and maritime Croatia on sixteen remarkable cascade lakes. Timeless beauty of waterfalls thrills in every season in a different way. The perfect picture nature has been creating for several millenniums, leaving everyone breathless. Experience the birth of a vivid rainbow while getting refreshed with the scattered drops of 78 meters high waterfall. Find out why and how the Lakes change colors from emerald green to azure blue. Enjoy thousands of sparkling falls, clean pure air, the great Splasher, idyllical boat ride on Lake Kozjak, endemic flora and fauna and Lika’s food. Take a walk on one of 18 kilometres marked trails in unspoiled countryside or relax while driving on electric boat or small train. Only 2 hours from Zagreb, do not miss the opportunity for unique experience that attract visitors from all over the globe.\n\nOn the way to Plitvice we stop at small Millers village Rastoke usually called “Little Plitvice”. Rastoke is situated at the Slunjcica River estuary which over travertine barriers \"dissolves\" into the river Korana creating a series of small lakes and picturesque waterfalls. Experience this natural monument compared with famous Fontana di Trevi in 1860 by well known philologist and travel writer Adolf Veber Tkalcevic. Discover the rare symbiosis of fantastic natural creations and centuries old human technical achievements such as old mills from the 17th century.\n\nEnjoy the fresh caught trout, well known Lika lamb or veal, deer dishes and other specialties in restaurants smartly fitted in the nature.\n\nAnd if we get lucky – we meet the otters that build their homes in riverbanks burrows or under the rocky ledges of Rastoke."
