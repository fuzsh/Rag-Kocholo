        "text": "When I put my superpower travel goggles on, I can see you hover over a map of Croatia, tracing a wish-route that’ll make your holiday unforgettable.\n\nYour eyes sparkle at the sight of Croatia’s crystal blue water.\n\nNext, your mouth waters as you read about Istria’s hand-harvested wines and pastas drowned in opulent truffle sauces.\n\nFinally, your heart races when you imagine yourself exploring ancient Dalmatian towns that your blogger idols just returned from.\n\nAnd there’s just one question before your sweet travel anticipations turn into a set itinerary.\n\nWhat about Zagreb? Is Zagreb worth visiting too?\n\nIf I simply told you ‘Yes, of course it is’, you’d want to know why. Is it an instant winner as the fabulous Croatian coast? Is it ‘the next Prague’? Or something completely different?\n\nI hear you.\n\nWhen I lived in London, I’d coax my British friends to stop in Zagreb before rushing off to the coast. Not a single one regretted changing their plans. Even when it meant less time sun-bathing or island-hopping.\n\nOf course, I made sure they had me to unravel Zagreb for them. But even if I don’t take you by the hand to my favourite places and share the city’s stories over a cup of coffee, this post will help you find out:\n\nwhat to generally expect from your visit to Zagreb\n\nwhat travel experiences Zagreb is worth visiting for\n\nwhere to get information and inspiration to have a blast in Zagreb\n\nSo, is Zagreb worth visiting?\n\nTimeless and elegant like a small black dress, Zagreb is a city that draws you in slowly. If there’s a destination that delivers on the ‘still water runs deep’ statement – it is Zagreb.\n\nLike any Central European capital, Zagreb is not short of praiseworthy highlights: bountiful museums, captivating architecture and an explosion of outdoor activities.\n\nSo, think of vibrant food markets, everyday cafe culture, lush greenery and a host of street festivals. But know, they are stylish accessories to the graceful fabric of its biggest highlight – the life attitude.\n\nWhere other cities attract with charismatic yet prepackaged tourist attractions, Zagreb delights with its human-scale graciousness.\n\nAs James of Nomadic Notes says, it’s ‘a real city, without all the tour buses and restaurants with menus in four languages’. Even when you set out to explore its sights, you’ll be spared the corporate tourist aftertaste: a feeling that you’re in a theme park.\n\nMaybe you’re already itching to explore the best of Zagreb? Then dig into my ultimate guide!\n\nGet 10% off all our cookbooks\n\nStill don't have our cookbooks? Get a 10% OFF discount code when you join our list.\n\nZagreb is worth visiting if you like:\n\n1) GETTING AROUND IN A LAID-BACK STYLE\n\nIf you have a thing for characterful public transport, such as trams in Lisbon or San Francisco, you’ll be easily impressed in Zagreb.\n\nThe squealing sound of Zagreb blue trams adds a note of the old word charm to the city’s unhurried pace. Riding a packed carriage will give you a flavour of the local life. But you can just as easily explore the historic centre on foot.\n\nWalking is one of the greatest things you can do in Zagreb.\n\nThe Upper Town dimly lit narrow streets will draw you in on a romantic quest. You’ll be poking your head around each corner, wondering where such a secluded alleyway or a staircase might lead? A mysterious park, hidden courtyard, or a world-class museum?\n\nEven when you join pedestrians in the busier Lower Town, walking from point A to point B will be a joyful sidewalk dance. A mellow stroll infused with window-shopping, people-watching and happily getting distracted with new discoveries.\n\nGET INSPIRED:\n\n1) Michael Hodson of Go See Write loved the idea that you can get inside a courtyard of each historic building and find a world for yourself: a café or a boutique shop. He could stay in Zagreb for 3-4 months!\n\n2) Frank of Frank about Croatia created a guide to Zagreb for couples, revealing places and itineraries that make Zagreb a perfect romantic getaway.\n\n3) Some Upper Town spots are so perfectly hidden and beautiful, they just lend themselves to romance. I call them Zagreb kissing spots. Find them on this Romantic Zagreb Walk.\n\nZagreb is worth visiting if you like:\n\n2) STRAYING OFF THE PATH\n\nRambling around Zagreb pretty cityscape will put you in a perfect holiday mood. You’ll be carefree as well as thrilled with things you do and places you see. If you completely ditch your to-do list, Zagreb’s walkable character will wow you even more.\n\nAimless meandering could take you to secluded leafy paths, just around the corner from bustling streets and squares. So follow your curiosity. There is street art, spooky gargoyles, bygone courtyard wells or painted water pumps waiting out there.\n\nYou’ll wonder why these enchanting oddities are not sign-posted or widely advertised. The answer? Because Zagreb is still not a touristy place. You’ll be thankful for that because part of the excitement is discovering them on your own.\n\nGET INSPIRED:\n\n1) Get deliciously aimless with my self-guided Zagreb walks through city’s uncharted territories. You’ll get a map and a bunch of captivating stories, from art history to the city lore, to keep you going.\n\n2) Iva Silla from Secret Zagreb is more than a tourist guide. Her gripping storytelling about Zagreb legends leaves no stone unturned, even in the darkest Upper Town alley or inside secret Zagreb tunnels. If you want your curiosity fired up and then be guided to lesser-known parts of the city, book one of her inspiring walks.\n\n3) Kris and Sarah of Jetsetting Fools stayed in Zagreb long enough to discover the delights of many Zagreb outdoor spaces. Follow their trail through landscaped parks, such as Maksimir, the Green Horseshoe or the Botanical Garden, or venture out to semi-wild greenery and Zagreb lakes.\n\nZagreb is worth visiting if you like:\n\n3) TRAVELLING WITHOUT TO-DO LISTS\n\nDo you know the feeling of overwhelm after spending a few days in Paris or London?\n\nIt’s not only the busy ‘things to do and places to see’ itinerary that sends you off spinning but the gnawing guilt about not having covered it all. Even your memory of these grand places carry a tinge of failure.\n\nOn the other hand, Zagreb is utterly different. Not only can you do your to-dos short and sweet, it’s a city that forgives you for missing out on some of its official highlights.\n\nIn fact, many travellers wish they had allowed more time in Zagreb. But the regret is not about running out of time to do more sightseeing. It’s about not realizing sooner that Zagreb is at its best without an itinerary.\n\nAnne Lowrey of Part Time Traveler said next time she visits Zagreb, it’ll be only to loaf around and sip one coffee after other. Honestly, if you want to experience Zagreb at its most exquisite, you need to match its languid attitude to life.\n\nCOFFEE DRINKING IN ZAGREB\n\nWhat Zagreb people love most is their free time. Actually, they’ll conduct even their busiest tasks in what seems like a leisurely context – coffee drinking.\n\nIf the sight of crowded terraces in the middle of a workday makes you think no one works here, remember that you might be witnessing a bunch of business meetings.\n\nAlso, having a drink with friends is often a spur of the moment thing. Few people will ever require you to arrange a date long in advance. It’s an attitude thing.\n\nZagreb people believe they should have time for their friends, even if it means taking it out of their work schedule.\n\nSo throw away your agenda.\n\nInstead of getting busy sightseeing, meet a local and enjoy the sweetness of doing nothing… one cafe after another after another. Or if Zagreb is a stop on your world travels, use your time here to slow down and recover from other busy destinations.\n\nPretend you live here and the coulda woulda shoulda’s will soon disappear. You’ll love Zagreb for giving you a wonderful freedom to just be.\n\nAs you move from a café to a restaurant, you’ll soon encounter something worth seeing. Maybe it won’t be a guidebook highlight, but it will be just as memorable. Why? Because you’ve discovered it by chance.\n\nAnd because it’s the way Zagreb unfolds to visitors.\n\nGET INSPIRED:\n\n1) The beauty of Zagreb for Matt Long of Landlopers is in discovering small and unexpected delights like statues of the famous sculptor Ivan Meštrović: ‘a tour just of his statues in Zagreb could easily fill a day’.\n\n2) Iva Silla’s guestpost for the popular Croatia blog Chasing the Donkey praises Zagreb street art scene – just as vibrant and interesting as must-see museums. Why not track down the Zagreb Solar system – a treasure trail of nine planets scattered around the city, relative in size and distance to the real thing. Or stop at a painted water pump to learn about the Pimp My Pump art project?\n\n3) Kami of My Wanderlust took amazing photos of the Zagreb graffiti – another lesser-known city delight, discovered only if you lose your itinerary and hop on an aimless walk.\n\nZagreb is worth visiting if you like:\n\n3) CITIES WITH THEIR OWN COOL\n\nPeople often compare Zagreb to the Croatian coast or to cities like Prague or Vienna. But Zagreb is neither and both at the same time.\n\nAn eclectic mix of Central European and Mediterranean mentalities, it’s smart in an Austro-Hungarian way and spruced up with warm Southern gusto.\n\nMost of all, Zagreb has developed its own way of cool.\n\nResisting the onslaught of large international franchises, the city centre abounds with idiosyncratic cafes, restaurants, boutique shops, even old-style cinemas.\n\nIn the words of Jonathan Bousfield, author of the Rough Guide to Croatia, this ‘makes Zagreb something of a collector’s item among connoisseurs of Central European authenticity’.\n\nRead about other places to visit in Croatia.\n\nFacts that make Zagreb a singular city:\n\n#1 ZAGREB HAS THE BIGGEST NUMBER OF MUSEUMS PER SQUARE METER.\n\nThe Museum of Broken Relationships is the most raved about gallery. But more unique museum spaces are sprouting all the time.\n\nThere is Lauba, an Austro-Hungarian riding stable turned interactive contemporary art showroom, small but quirky Mushroom Museum or the bewildering Museum of Illusions.\n\nGET INSPIRED:\n\n1) Sarah Ricks of Traveling Mom speaks of Zagreb as an architectural feast and includes a list of must-see museums. Her impressions will set you off on a cultured trail.\n\n2) There’s hardly a blog post about Zagreb that doesn’t praise the Museum of Broken Relationships. You get the point – go see it. But Wandering Earl has the most poetic and touching review of his afternoon spent in this ‘graveyard of love’. For him it was an uplifting experience.\n\n#2 ZAGREB IS A CINEPHILES’ PARADISE IN MORE THAN ONE WAY.\n\nIt was a movie set for the famous films Sophie’s Choice, Fiddler on the Roof and Orson Welles’ The Trial.\n\nIt hosts an incredible number of independent film festivals. For example, The Zagreb Film Festival (October), Animafest (June) and Fantastic Zagreb Film Festival (June/July).\n\nIndependent films are screened in old-style arthouse cinemas and are never dubbed. Come summer, you can watch them under the starry skies in the middle of the Tuškanac forest.\n\n#3 ZAGREB HAS OVER 20 FARMERS MARKETS.\n\nThe most central and famous one is Dolac. Mingling at colourful fruit and veg stalls is a prime tourist attraction.\n\nBut markets here still keep their primary function. They connect Zagreb people with local food producers. Walk into any neighbourhood and the freshest from farms awaits at the stalls.\n\n#4 ZAGREB RESTAURANT SCENE HAS EXPLODED.\n\nThe whole of Croatia is dished out on Zagreb plates: traditionally cooked or with a twist.\n\nFish restaurants cook up a storm with ingredients caught the same day. Whiffs of Turkish-influenced filo pastry or kebab radiate from street bistros. And continental meat dishes wait at vaulted-brick dining rooms.\n\nEating out in Zagreb has never been so exciting and so easy on your wallet.\n\nGET INSPIRED:\n\nFrank of Frank about Croatia really knows his way around Zagreb restaurants. Not only does he know what and where to eat, but, most importantly, how to eat. Dig into his guide to Zagreb best lunch restaurants and learn why gablec (lunch-time meal) is so crucial for the city food culture.\n\nStreets are lit up, food stalls sell sausages and mulled wine. And each square has a unique range of tidbits at their Christmas fair.\n\nThe rhythm of live music quickly makes you forget the below zero temperature that turns your feet stiff with cold. If your inner child rejoices at the thought of ice-skating, you can glide across Europe’s biggest open-air ice-rink at the Zrinjevac Square.\n\nHIKING IN ZAGREB\n\nFinally, Zagreb’s quintessential open-air experience is climbing the Medvednica Mountain.\n\nWithin 20 minutes on public transport, you’ll start on the trails through an unspoilt nature park. Whatever the season, there are lodges with hearty meals and impeccable city views waiting at the top.\n\nLocals venture out there every weekend, so if you really want to crack Zagreb, you’ll follow too.\n\nGET INSPIRED:\n\n1) Follow Frank’s suggestions on how to conquer Medvednica for yourself. If you prefer a more unorthodox leafy stroll, take his word and go to the amazing Mirogoj cemetery.\n\n2) Rambling Mandie has a funny account of hiking up Medvednica in search of the elusive Medvedgrad Castle.\n\n3) Travel writer Anja Mutic takes you on an intriguing exploration of Zagreb hidden courtyards. You’ll be amazed with cafes, restaurants and shops concealed from the main street view and better understand why Zagreb keeps its biggest charms away from the spotlights.\n\nAre you sold on the idea of Zagreb now that you know what to expect?\n\nDrop me a comment if there’s more you need to dispel your dilemma…\n\nAND BOOK YOUR PERFECT STAY IN ZAGREB NOW!\n\nTry Swanky Mint B&B in the centre of Zagreb. It’s a revamped 19th-century factory full of character and historic industrial features. The best part? It has a fantastic garden and a private roof-top pool!
