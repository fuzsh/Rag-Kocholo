Full Name: Julia Agrippina

Profession: Roman Empress

Biography: Agrippina the Younger was a Roman empress and key figure in the Julio-Claudian dynasty. She was notable for her relationships with important figures of her time, being the sister of Emperor Caligula, the fourth wife of Emperor Claudius, and the mother of Emperor Nero.

Born into the elite of Roman society, Agrippina the Younger was the daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder and a great-granddaughter of Emperor Augustus. At the age of 13, she entered into marriage with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and bore him a son, Nero. Following her husband's death, Agrippina became involved in a conspiracy to overthrow her brother, the Emperor Caligula, which led to her exile.

Her exile ended with Caligula's assassination in 41 AD when her uncle Claudius ascended to the throne. Agrippina seized the opportunity to return to power, marrying Claudius in 49 AD. She played a pivotal role in securing the adoption of her son Nero as Claudius's heir, ensuring Nero's path to the imperial throne.

Agrippina was renowned for her political maneuvering and ambition. She used her status to advance her son Nero's political career. As Nero grew in power after becoming emperor, however, Agrippina's influence began to decline. Their relationship ultimately soured, culminating in her murder in 59 AD under suspicious circumstances.
