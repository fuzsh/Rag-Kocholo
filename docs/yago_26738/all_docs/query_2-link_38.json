        "text": "One of the most infamous of Roman Imperial women, Empress Agrippina the Younger (15 – 59 CE) was sister, niece and wife, and mother to three successive Emperors. Though she stands accused of incest, murder, and a whole host of intrigues designed to secure her own power, her reputation prevents us from really knowing exactly what happened.\n\nAgrippina was the daughter of Agrippina the Elder and Germanicus. She spent much of her childhood in Rome while her parents traveled. At age 13 she married Domitius Ahenobarbus, a man whom Suetonius calls “in every aspect of his life detestable.” The couple had one son together, the future Emperor Nero.\n\nHer life changed when her brother Caligula became Emperor. For a while he honored his sisters very highly, but after Drusilla’s death showed Agrippina and Livilla no respect and ended up exiling both of them. It was probably during this time period that Agrippina wrote her (now lost) history of her family and of her mother’s life.**\n\n[Agrippina the Younger, 1st century CE, source: Wikimedia Commons]\n\nAgrippina is probably best known for her relationships with her uncle Claudius and her son Nero. She married Claudius in 49 CE after the Senate made unions between uncle and niece legal by special decree, largely due to her own political maneuvering.\n\nOnce Empress, Agrippina encouraged Claudius to prefer Nero over his son Britannicus. She moved decisively to remove from power anyone who might oppose her plans to make her son Emperor and quickly married her son to Claudius’s daughter Octavia. Ancient sources claim that Agrippina poisoned her husband when he began to favor Britannicus again, but how true that accusation was is unknown.\n\nI find the power dynamics in this sculpture fascinating.\n\n[Agrippina crowning her son Nero, 1st century CE, source: Wikimedia Commons]\n\nAgrippina remained quite powerful during the early years of Nero’s reign. It was only when he took up with his mistress Acte that her influence waned. A rift grew between them and in 59 CE Nero attempted to have her killed in a shipwreck. When she survived that, he sent his guards to kill her.***\n\nAll of the major sources on Agrippina’s are heavily biased against both her and her son. As a result, we cannot know which of the accusations against her were true and which were mere fabrications. What comes through is her desire for power and her intelligence in getting it.\n\n*Romans and their terrible, confusing naming conventions for women. Gah! What? Have strong opinions on this? Who me?\n\n**Thus she predates Anna Komnene as a female historian.\n\n***We acted out the murder of Agrippina the Younger in one of my Classics courses in college. Every single role (down to Agrippina’s maid and guardsman) was cross-cast except Nero. I played the captain of the soldiers sent to kill her."
