        "text": "From her mother, the wife of Germanicus, she inherited an imperious and ambitious temperament; she was prepared if necessary to wade through slaughter to the throne.\n\n- Edward Togo Salmon ‘A History of the Roman World 30BC to AD138’\n\n​syllabus\n\nFocus of study\n\nBackground and rise to prominence, including:\n\nfamily background and status\n\nearly life, ambitions and marriages\n\nAgrippina was born to power and also its shadow.\n\n-Bill Leadbetter ‘The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger’\n\nfamily background\n\nAgrippina the Younger was born in a military camp in Germany in 15 CE, her mother was Agrippina the Elder and her father was Germanicus. As one of 6 children, in her childhood she watched her mother and brother Nero starve in exile, her father possibly poisoned by the princep, her brother Drusus starve to death in prison, found with mattress stuffing in his mouth, her sisters Livilla’s exile and her brother Gaius and sister Drusilla marry. This is a woman who by no means had a normal upbringing, nor could we expect normal behaviour from her. She, like Gaius managed to survive the constant persecution of her family under the principate of Tiberius, her brother Gaius, her uncle Claudius, only to be executed by her own son Nero.\n\nShe began life as a daughter of the most beloved family in Rome and died as a mother caste off by the monster that she bore and raised to power. Agrippina has been remembered as a villain throughout history, the ancient writers have given us a picture of an immoral woman who would sacrifice anything to the pursuit of power. The Agrippina of Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio is cruel, jealous, incestuous, power hungry, ambitious and manipulative.\n\nHowever modern historians attempt to peel back the prejudice to reveal a more holistic picture of a woman in the pursuit of survival and protection of her child. Even Tacitus, her most hostile critic acknowledges her unique position as ‘the daughter of a great commander and the sister, wife and mother of emperors’. However we see Agrippina, it is a fact that she attained more power than any Roman woman before her and at least a century after her.\n\nAgrippina the elder\n\nAgrippina the Elder (14BC-33AD) was the daughter of Julia Caesaris and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and therefore granddaughter of Augustus on her mothers side. She was married to Germanicus Julius Caesar, the son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor and therefore granddaughter of Livia Drusilla on her father’s side. She was both Julian and Claudian by blood. This lineage was impeccable and of all the women in her immediate family, she alone escapes the scorn and embarrassment the others brought on her family. Born in 14 BC in Athens, her father Agrippa died when she was 2 years old and her mother Julia was remarried to the reluctant Tiberius, stepson of the Princep Augustus. The marriage was an unhappy one, and her mother disgraced the family with numerous counts of adultery and was eventually exiled. Left an orphan at the age of 12 her Agrippina the elder was raised by her grandmother Livia. Her mother Julia finally died of malnutrition in 14AD.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Agrippina had a strict upbringing and education. Her education included how to spin and weave and she was forbidden to say or do anything, either in public or private. Augustus made her record any daily activities she did in the imperial day book and the emperor took severe measures in preventing Agrippina from forming friendships, without his consent. As a member of the imperial family, Agrippina was expected to have and show strict traditional Roman virtues for a woman that was frugality, chastity and domesticity. Agrippina and her grandfather Augustus reportedly had a close relationship.\n\nBetween 1BC-5AD Agrippina was married to her maternal cousin Germanicus Julius Caesar. Their marriage was a loving one and she was a loyal, affectionate wife, who supported her husband. The Roman historian Tacitus states that Agrippina had an ‘impressive record as wife and mother’. In her marriage to Germanicus she bore him 9 children 6 of whom survived infancy:\n\nNero Caesar6 CE-30 CE (lived 24 years)\n\nDrusus Caesar7 CE-33 CE (lived 26 years)\n\nGaius (Caligula)Born in Antium, Italy, 12 CE-41 CE (lived 29 years)\n\nJulia Agrippina Born in Oppiddum Ubiorum (Cologne) Germany, 15 CE-59 CE (lived 44 years)\n\nJulia Drusilla Born in Ambitarvium, Germany, 16 CE-38 CE (lived 22 years)\n\nJulia Livilla Born in Lesbos, Greek Islands, 18 CE-42 CE (lived 24 years)\n\nDuring one of the mutinies on the Rhine, Germanicus took his pregnant wife Agrippina with him with the young Gaius at foot. The sources paint a unique picture of the woman in this event as it appears that Germanicus might be killed and she makes a public spectacle out of taking her young son and leaving the army camp because she fears for her son’s life. She appears in this passage intelligent and protective, an excellent matrona, while Germanicus appears weak and sulking. At seeing the blood of Augustus in fear of their lives, the army feet ashamed and apologised. Later, Agrippina quelled a mutiny of Germanicus’ troops by encouraging the troops as they returned to camp after battles, and distributed clothes and medicines.\n\nMarble bust of Agrippina the Elder - often mistaken for Agrippina II\n\nMeanwhile a rumour had spread that our army was cut off, and that a furious German host was marching on Gaul. And had not Agrippina prevented the bridge over the Rhine from being destroyed, some in their cowardice would have dared that base act. A woman of heroic spirit, she assumed during those days the duties of a general, and distributed clothes or medicine among the soldiers, as they were destitute or wounded. According to Caius Plinius, the historian of the German wars, she stood at the extremity of the bridge, and bestowed praise and thanks on the returning legions. This made a deep impression on the mind of Tiberius. \"Such zeal,\" he thought, \"could not be guileless; it was not against a foreign foe that she was thus courting the soldiers. Generals had nothing left them when a woman went among the companies, attended the standards, ventured on bribery, as though it showed but slight ambition to parade her son in a common soldier's uniform, and wish him to be called Caesar Caligula. Agrippina had now more power with the armies than officers, than generals. A woman had quelled a mutiny which the sovereign's name could not check.\"\n\nTacitus' Annals\n\nLater when Germanicus died in Syria, and accused the princep of poisoning him, Agrippina returns to Rome with her 6 children in tow, her husband’s ashes in an urn. The spectacle drew massive crowds in Rome who mourned his death, and Agrippina gathered groups of people around her and told them of the emperor’s crime.\n\nAs soon as the fleet was seen on the horizon, not only the harbour and the adjacent shores, but the city walls too and the roofs and every place which commanded the most distant prospect were filled with crowds of mourners, who incessantly asked one another, whether, when she landed, they were to receive her in silence or with some utterance of emotion. They were not agreed on what befitted the occasion when the fleet slowly approached, its crew, not joyous as is usual, but wearing all a studied expression of grief. When Agrippina descended from the vessel with her two children, clasping the funeral urn, with eyes riveted to the earth, there was one universal groan. You could not distinguish kinsfolk from strangers, or the laments of men from those of women; only the attendants of Agrippina, worn out as they were by long sorrow, were surpassed by the mourners who now met them, fresh in their grief.\n\n​Tacitus' Annals\n\nThe whole situation was made worse by the fact that neither Livia the grandmother of Germanicus nor Tiberius his uncle, came to the public funeral of Germanicus.\n\nAgrippina finally went too far Tiberius accused her of plotting to mutiny with an army of her own. Whether or not it was true, she was exiled in 29 CE to the island of Pandateria but not before she was flogged so harshly that she lost and eye in the process. Her son Nero Caesar was exiled to the island of Pontia and in 30 CE Drusus was imprisoned in the palace cellar where he died in 31 CE. Agrippina apparently attempted to starve herself to death, but her jaws were forced open and she was force-fed. She survived until 33 when both she and her son died of starvation.\n\nquestions\n\nHow was Agrippina the Elder both Julian and Claudian?\n\nWho were Agrippina and Germanicus’ children? What became of them?\n\nWhen had Agrippina the elder exercised power like a man?\n\nCould Agrippina I have been guilty of the crime she was accused of?\n\nWhat became of Agrippina the elder? ​\n\nSee: Julio Claudians - Tiberius & Germanicus for a review of the life of Germanicus - Agrippina's father.\n\nBasanite bust of Agrippina II wearing a diadem with covered head. Capitoline Museum\n\nEarly life & marriages: Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus\n\nAfter her fathers’ death in 40 CE, Agrippinilla (little Agrippina) was required by law to be under the protection of a guardian or tutela impurberis, until the age of twelve. As Tiberius arranged her first marriage to Gnaeus DomitiusAhenobarbus when she was twelve, it is assumed that he was also her guardian. What is known is that from age 13 onwards Agrippina’s father was dead, her mother was in exile on Pandateria, two of her brothers were imprisoned and her remaining siblings, sisters Livilla, Drusilla and her brother Gaius lived with their aunt Antonia Minor. Agrippina lived for this time in the house of her great grandmother Livia Drusilla. This was a young woman very much alone in the world, and very much in danger.\n\nDomitius was the representative of an illustrious family; in the male line descended from noble ancestors, and on the maternal grand-nephew to Augustus, being grandson to Octavia, sister to that Emperor. These splendid considerations rendered the alliance acceptable to Agrippina; but had the character been taken into the account, she ought sooner to have consigned her daughter to the arms of the meanest slave. In an age of unexampled depravity, Domitius was considered as the most depraved.\n\nThe intended bride, now in her fifteenth year, was beautiful and accomplished. Endowed with all that quickness of perception and vivacity of fancy, which so often passes for superiority of talent, she made an early progress in every branch of literature, and is said to have composed both in prose and verse with facility and elegance.\n\nThat most important part of education, which arises from the circumstances in which the individual is placed, was all against her. Pride of birth, indignation of injustice, resentment of injuries, were all first impressions received by her young mind. Hatred and revenge were never taught by precept but they were excited by example; while pride, which coalesces with every malignant passion, and augments its fury, was enforced as the prerogative of high descent. ....If she might have been so fortunate as to have been united to a man of virtue, she might still have been virtuous; but with such a husband as Domitius, there was little room to hope that Agrippina would escape the contagion of vice.\n\nElizabeth Hamilton Memoirs of the Life of Agrippina: The Wife of Germanicus, 1804\n\nGnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus was the son of a long distinguished family of the Ahenobarbii who had been involved with the civil war between Augustus and Mark Antony. Ahenobarbus Senior had been given clemency under Augustus despite having opposed him originally and was eventually even honoured on a coin minted under Augustus for his role in the battle of Actium. His son Ahenobarbus the younger was known for his cruelty and malice and was married to Agrippina when she was 13 years of age. They lived together somewhere between Antium (57 km south of Rome) and Rome. ​\n\n…..the father of Nero, a man hateful in every walk of life; for when he had gone to the East on the staff of the young Gaius Caesar, he slew one of his own freedmen for refusing to drink as much as he ordered, and when he was in consequence dismissed from the number of Gaius' friends, he lived not a bit less lawlessly. On the contrary, in a village on the Appian Way, suddenly whipping up his team, he purposely ran over and killed a boy; and right in the Roman Forum he gouged out the eye of a Roman knight for being too outspoken in chiding him. He was moreover so dishonest that he not only cheated some bankers of the prices of wares which he had bought. Just before the death of Tiberius he was also charged with treason, as well as with acts of adultery and incest with his sister Lepida, but escaped owing to the change of rulers and died of dropsy at Pyrgi, after acknowledging Nero son of Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus.\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars ​\n\nIn 37 CE Tiberius died and Gaius was proclaimed princep. On 15th December 37 CE Agrippina gave birth to a son, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. This was exactly 9 months after the death of Tiberius, which has led some historians to believe that Agrippina feared persecution from Tiberius and thought that any son of hers would be a rival to the office of princep. Therefore she may have deliberately avoided having children until she knew it was safe. As a Roman woman Agrippina could never hope to attain power for herself but this must have been an important time for her as she decided on how best to survive and protect her son in this family. Suetonius states that when Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, he replied \"I don't think anything produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people.\"\n\nAnother manifest indication of Nero's future unhappiness occurred on the day of his purification; for when Gaius Caesar was asked by his sister to give the child whatever name he liked, he looked at his uncleClaudius, who later became emperor and adopted Nero, and said that he gave him his name.\n\n​Suetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\n‘Agrippina was a woman who had been educated in the traditions of the Roman aristocracy, and who therefore considered herself merely a means to the political advancement of her relatives and her children’.\n\n​Guillermo Ferrero, Women of the Caesars\n\nAs such her son was a dynastic weapon, to be honed carefully to ensure her future exercise of power.\n\nBill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger\n\nquestions\n\nDescribe the nature and personality of Ahenobarbus.\n\nDescribe Agrippina’s family background.\n\nOutline the significance of her first marriage.\n\nDescribe Agrippina's status (Definition of status: 'relative social or professional position; standing')​\n\nambitions\n\nIt is impossible to know the true ambitions of Agrippina. Her actions go some of the way to letting historians know what she aspired to, but there are significant gaps in our knowledge as all our ancient sources are hostile to her and suspect the worst of her ambitions.\n\nThe most common ambitions she seems to have are:\n\nTo make Nero emperor\n\nTo make herself empress\n\nThe problem with these two ambitions is that she did not seem satisfied with Nero as emperor when she achieved it, and there is no actual position available to a woman in roman government. Did she mean for him to be a puppet king? Certainly she ruled through him as the archeological and written sources attest. However it is not necessary to see Agrippina as having one single ambition throughout her life. If she did, based on the history of her family it may simply have been ‘to survive’.\n\nHistorian Donald RDudley calls her “this Clytemnestra of a woman” and suggests that at any time she had 3 motivations:\n\nTo draw political power into her own hands\n\nTo advance her son Nero\n\nTo remove those who posed a threat to either of those ambitions​\n\nShe was asserting her partnership in the empire her ancestors had won.\n\nTacitus Annals\n\nNothing seemed to satisfy Agrippina, though all the privileges that Livia had enjoyed had been bestowed upon her, and a number of additional honours had been voted. But although she exercised the same power as Claudius she desired to have his title outright…\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nAgrippina the Younger, unlike her mother and most other women of her dynasty, sought not only political power for her son but a publicly recognized position of authority for herself.\n\nSusan Wood\n\nThe sight of an empress sitting in state before the military standards of the Roman army and personally receiving the homage of foreign captives was a novelty and Agrippina’s habit of attended this and the other public functions at Claudius’ side was remarked on by some who saw it as proof of her desire to be an equal partner in the running of the empire.\n\nAnnelise Freisenbruch\n\nquestions"
