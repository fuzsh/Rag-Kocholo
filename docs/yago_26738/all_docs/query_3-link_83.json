        "text": "Suetonius: The Twelve Caesars - Index A\n\nAborigines, a term used here for the indigenous population of Latium. They came from the area of Reate, drove the Sakrani or Siculi from Lazio and defeated the Umbrians. Sallust describes them as uncultured, other sources disagree, however, and describe a monarchical organized community. Several kings, many of whom became gods, were: Saturn, Thybris, Faunus, Aventinus, Picus and the alleged namesake of the country of Latium, Latinus. They appear together in Roman mythology and legend with the Trojans as the root-stocks of the Latin people.\n\nBookSevenXXXVI Faunus was their king.\n\nAccius (170BC - c. 86BC), or Lucius Attius, was a tragedian and literary scholar. The son of a freedman, Accius was born at Pisaurum in Umbria. The year of his death is unknown, but Cicero (64 years younger) speaks of having conversed with him on literary matters. About 700 lines from his works survive.\n\nBookFourXXX Caligula quotes ‘Oderint, dum metuant’.\n\nAcerronius Proculus, Gnaeus, was consul in 37AD, the year in which Tiberius died. He was perhaps a descendant of the Gnaeus Acerronius whom Cicero mentions in his oration for Tullius, Pro Tullio, from 71BC. He may also have been the father of Acerronia Polla, a friend of Agrippina the Younger, murdered by the emperor Nero in AD59.\n\nBookThreeLXXIII Consul in 37AD.\n\nAchaica, see Mummia\n\nAchilles was the greatest warrior among the Greek heros in Homer’s Iliad. Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the Trojan War, he was concealed at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros. There, Achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among Lycomedes’ daughters, under the name ‘Pyrrha’ (the red-haired).\n\nBookThreeLXX His name among the girls was the subject of one of Tiberius’s questions to the grammarians.\n\nAcilius, Gaius, was a soldier who distinguished himself in the naval battle off Massilia (Marseilles).\n\nBookOneLXVIII His bravery at Massilia.\n\nAcilius Aviola, Manius was consul in 54AD.\n\nBookFiveXLV Claudius died during his consulship.\n\nAcilius Glabrio, Manius was consul with Trajan in 91AD. He was exiled and then executed by order of Domitian probably in AD95. He is claimed as an early Christian convert.\n\nBookEightXLVI Executed for plotting rebellion.\n\nActe, Claudia, was a freedwoman who became a mistress of the emperor Nero. She came from Asia Minor and may have been a slave of the Emperor Claudius, or of Octavia, Claudius’s daughter.\n\nBookSixXXVIII Nero’s mistress.\n\nBookSixL She helped to deposit Nero’s ashes in the family tomb.\n\nActium was the ancient name of a promontory of western Greece in northwestern Acarnania, at the mouth of the Sinus Ambracius (Gulf of Arta) opposite Nicopolis, which was later founded by Augustus on the north side of the strait. On the promontory was an ancient temple of Apollo Actius, which was enlarged by Augustus (Octavian) who also renewed the quinquennial games known as Actia or Ludi Actiaci. There was a village, on the promontory also called Actium. The Battle of Actium was fought between the forces of Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, on 2 September 31BC, in the Ionian Sea nearby. Octavian’s fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, while Antony’s fleet was supported by that of Cleopatra VII, Queen of Ptolemaic Egypt. Octavian’s victory enabled him to consolidate his power over Rome and its dominions.\n\nBookTwoIX Augustus (Octavian) involved in civil war there.\n\nBookTwoXVII Octavian (Augustus) achieved victory there.\n\nBookTwoXVIII Augustus also consecrated the site of his camp.\n\nBookTwoXXII BookThreeVI Augustus celebrated his victory at Actium in his triple-triumph of 29BC.\n\nBookTwoXCVI An omen of Augustus’ victory there.\n\nBookFourXXIII Caligula refused to allow the annual victory celebration.\n\nActius, was a comic actor whose freedom was purchased by Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeXLVII Mentioned.\n\nActorius Naso, Marcus, a historian.\n\nBookOneIX BookOneLII Mentioned.\n\nAdminius, Amminius or Amminus was a son of Cunobelinus, ruler of the Catuvellauni, a tribe of Iron Age Britain. He himself was ruler of the Cantiaci of eastern Kent, and was deposed and exiled by his father c. 40AD. He fled to Europe with a small group of followers and surrendered to the Romans there. Sallustius Lucullus, Roman governor of Britain in the late 1st century may have been a son of this prince.\n\nBookFourXLIV His surrender was received by Caligula.\n\nAegisthus, in Greek mythology was the son of Thyestes and of his daughter, Pelopia. While Agamemnon was absent on his expedition against Troy, Aegisthus seduced Clytemnestra, wife of Agamemnon, and impiously offered thanks to the gods for the crime. When Agamemnon returned, Aegisthus treacherously murdered him.\n\nBookOneL Caesar described by Pompey as an ‘Aegisthus’.\n\nAelia Paetina was the daughter of the consul of 4AD, Sextus Aelius Catus. She was raised by her relative the Praetorian Guard Prefect, Lucius Seius Strabo, her adoptive brother being Lucius Aelius Sejanus, commander of the Praetorian Guard under Tiberius. Aelia Paetina married Claudius in 28AD, as his second wife. Their only child was their daughter Claudia Antonia, born in 30AD. Claudius divorced Paetina after October 31, when her adoptive brother fell from power and was murdered.\n\nBookFiveXXVI Second wife of Claudius.\n\nBookFiveXXVII Her daughter Claudia Antonia.\n\nAelianus, see Aemelius\n\nAelius Plautius Lamia Aemilianus, Lucius was consul suffectus in 80AD, under Titus, and the first husband of Domitian’s wife Domitia Longina.\n\nBookEightXXXVII His wife Domitia Longina married Domitian.\n\nBookEightXLVI Executed by Domitian.\n\nAelius Seianus, Lucius, known as Sejanus (d. 31AD) was an Equestrian by birth, the son of Lucius Seius Strabo who became Governor of Egypt, and succeeded his father as prefect of the Imperial bodyguard, the Praetorian Guard, which he commanded from 14AD until his death in 31AD. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in 26, Sejanus became de facto ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, He fell from power in 31AD, the year of his consulship. Amidst suspicion of conspiracy, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.\n\nBookThreeXLVIII Tiberius paid a bounty to those Praetorian guards and Syrian legions who did not acknowledge Sejanus.\n\nBookThreeLV BookThreeLXV BookFourXII BookFiveVI Tiberius brought about his downfall.\n\nBookThreeLXI Tiberius’s subsequent persecution of Sejanus’s friends.\n\nBookThreeLXII His rumoured poisoning of Drusus the Younger.\n\nBookFourXXX Caligula called the Senate disparagingly ‘friends of Sejanus’.\n\nBookFiveXXVII Claudius’ son Drusus was betrothed to Sejanus’s daughter Junilla, shortly before Drusus died.\n\nAemilia Lepida (b. c. 5BC) was the eldest daughter and first born child of Julia the Younger (the first granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus) and the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. Lepida married, by 13AD, Appius Junius Silanus.\n\nBookFiveXXVI Her betrothal to Claudius was broken off c. 8AD.\n\nAemilius Aelianus, a Cordoban.\n\nBookTwoLI Accused of vilifying Augustus.\n\nAemilius Lepidus, Marcus (120BC – 77BC), was the father of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and of the consul of 50 BC Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paulus. He was politically allied to Sulla, but once the dictator had resigned in 79BC, Lepidus attempted to undermine the Sullan constitution. Sent to administer Transalpine Gaul, he ultimately brought his army back to Rome, where he was defeated by Catulus in a pitched battle on the Campus Martius. Forced into exile in Sardinia, he died soon afterwards. His fellow rebel, Marcus Junius Brutus the Elder, the father of Caesar’s assassin of the same name, remained at Mutina, in Gaul. Pompey marched against him, but Brutus surrendered and was killed.\n\nBookOneIII Julius Caesar contemplated joining his faction.\n\nBookOneV Supported by Lucius Cornelius Cinna.\n\nAemilius Lepidus, Marcus (the Triumvir) (b. c. 89BC or 88BC, d. late 13BC or early 12BC) rose to become a member of the Second Triumvirate and Pontifex Maximus. His father, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, had been involved in a rebellion against the Republic which led to his death. Lepidus was among Julius Caesar’s greatest supporters. A praetor in 49BC, he ran Rome while Caesar defeated Pompey in Spain, and was rewarded with the consulship in 46BC after the defeat of the Pompeians in the East. When in February 44BC Caesar was elected dictator for life by the senate, he made Lepidus Master of the Horse, effectively his deputy. After Caesar’s assassination, Octavian, Antony and Lepidus ultimately met on an island in a river near Mutina (Modena), and formed the Second Triumvirate. Unlike the First Triumvirate of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, it was formally constituted, signalling the death of the Republic. He was consul for a second time in 42BC. After the pacification of the east and the the Battle of Philippi, during which he remained in Rome, Lepidus assumed rule of the western provinces of Hispania and Africa. Subsequently Lepidus was accused of usurping power in Sicily and of attempted rebellion and was forced into exile at Circeii. He was stripped of all his offices except that of Pontifex Maximus. He spent the rest of his life in obscurity.\n\nBookOneLXXXII Prevented Caesar’s assassins carrying out their plans after the assassination.\n\nBookOneLXXXVII Caesar had dined at his house on the eve of the assassination.\n\nBookTwoVIII BookTwoXIII He formed the Second Triumvirate, with Octavian and Antony.\n\nBookTwoXII BookThreeIV Antony fled to join him after Mutina.\n\nBookTwoXXVII His argument to the Senate for clemency regarding future proscriptions.\n\nBookTwoXXXI Lepidus held the office of Pontifex Maximus, the Chief Priesthood, from 44BC to his death.\n\nBookThreeV Tiberius born during his second consulship in 42BC.\n\nAemilius Lepidus, Marcus, Lepidus the Younger, (d. 30BC), was the only child of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Lepidus’ mother was Junia Secunda, a sister to Marcus Junius Brutus. Lepidus served as a Roman Senator, and was executed by Octavian (Augustus), as a leader in a conspiracy against him. Lepidus in his younger years was betrothed in 44BC to Antonia the Elder, the eldest daughter of Mark Antony. However the betrothal was later broken off.\n\nBookTwoXIX He was executed by Augustus in 30BC for conspiring against him.\n\nAemilius Lepidus, Marcus (6AD - 39AD) was the son of consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus. He and his sister Aemilia Lepida (d. 36AD) were both married to siblings of the Emperor Caligula (Aemilia married Caligula’s elder brother Drusus Caesar; Lepidus married Caligula’s younger sister Julia Drusilla in 37AD. Sometime in 39AD, Caligula made public letters by his sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla detailing adulterous affairs with Lepidus and a plot against the emperor. Lepidus was executed and Agrippina and Livilla exiled.\n\nBookFourXXIV His trial.\n\nBookFourXXXVI Caligula was rumoured to have had sexual intercourse with him.\n\nBookFiveIX His involvement in the conspiracy.\n\nBookEightII Vespasian proposed he was refused public burial.\n\nAemilius Mamercus, Lepidus Livianus, Consul 77BC. Brother of Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune) and son of Marcus Livius Drusus (censor), he was adopted into the Aemilii Lepidi. He married Cornelia Sulla, daughter of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, and may have been (the evidence is inconclusive) princeps senatus in the Sullan senate. He was consul in 77BC, the year after Sulla’s death.\n\nBookOneI Identification presumed. He interceded on behalf of the young Julius Caesar.\n\nAemilius Papus, Lucius was praetor for Sicily in 205BC. He may be the same as the Lucius Aemilius Papus, decemvir sacrorum, who died in 171BC. He may also have been the son of the consul of the same name of 225BC.\n\nBookTwoII Augustus’ great-grandfather served under him in Sicily in 205.\n\nAemilius Lepidus Paulus, Lucius was the brother of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and son to an elder Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. He supported Cicero during the Catiline Conspiracy. Paulus was Consul in 50BC. During his consulship, Julius Caesar bribed him for his support. Paulus reconstructed the Basilica Aemilia in Rome, with part of his bribery money. Paulus joined Marcus Junius Brutus and after Brutus’ suicide in 42BC, was pardoned, living out his remaining years at Miletus.\n\nBookOneXXIX Bribed by Caesar to elicit his support.\n\nBookTwoXVI Mentioned as having been proscribed by Octavian.\n\nAemilius Lepidus Paulus, Lucius (c. 77BC - c. 14BC) was nephew to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Triumvir, and son of his brother Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paulus. He served as consul in 34BC and censor in 22BC. Paulus married firstly Cornelia Lentula by whom he had two children: the son being another Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paulus, executed for conspiracy sometime before 14AD, husband of Julia the Younger, grand-daughter of Augustus. Secondly he married Claudia Marcella Minor, daughter of Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor and Octavia Minor, without issue. Augustus (Octavian) was her maternal uncle. Paulus died of unknown causes\n\nBookTwoXVI Mentioned as being on Octavian’s staff in Sicily.\n\nBookFiveXVI He was censor in 22BC.\n\nAemilius Lepidus Paulus, Lucius (c. 37BC - 14AD) was the son of Aemilius Lepidus Paulus (suffect consul 34BC and later censor) and Cornelia, the elder daughter of Scribonia. He was married to Vipsania Julia, the eldest granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus. His first and only known post is that of consul in 1AD with his brother-in-law, Gaius Caesar. He is also known to have been a member of the Arval Brethren, a priestly college. His wife Julia the Younger was exiled in 8AD for having an affair with a senator. Paulus himself was executed as a conspirator in a revolt at some point between 1AD and 14AD, and may have been involved in earlier conspiracies.\n\nBookTwoXIX Mentioned.\n\nBookTwoLXIV BookFiveXXVI His marriage to Julia the Younger c. 5BC.\n\nAenaria, modern Ischia, is a volcanic island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, at the northern end of the Gulf of Naples. The roughly trapezoidal island lies about 30 km from Naples. The Romans seized Ischia (and Naples) in 322BC.\n\nBookTwoXCII Augustus exchanged the island for that of Capri, with Naples, in 6AD.\n\nAeneas, the mythological Trojan hero, was the son of the mortal Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite. His father was also the second cousin of King Priam of Troy. The journey of Aeneas from Troy (with help from Aphrodite), which led to the founding of the city Rome, is recounted in Virgil’s Aeneid.\n\nBookOneXXXIX BookTwoXLIII BookThreeVI BookFourXVIII BookFiveXXI BookSixVII Supposedly Aeneas introduced the Troy Game, into Italy and his son Ascanius imparted it to the Alban kings and through them to the Romans. The game, which Augustus encouraged, consisted of a processional parade or ritual ‘dance’, by troops of boys, in which some of the participants appear to have been mounted on horseback. Virgil draws a comparison between the complicated movements of the game and the convolutions of the Cretan Labyrinth in Aeneid, V. (lines 585-591) Caligula and Claudius presented the Troy Game also. Nero performed in it as a youth.\n\nBookSixXXXIX Aeneas carried his father on his shoulders from the ruins of Troy.\n\nAequiculi, Aequicoli, or the Aequi, were an ancient people of northeast Latium and the central Appennines of Italy who were defeated by the Romans, after which substantial colonies were established. They occupied the upper reaches of the valleys of the Anio, Tolenus and Himella; the last two being mountain streams running northward to join the Nar.\n\nBookSevenXXXVI A Roman colony, named after the Vitelli, was defended against them by the Vitelli.\n\nAesculapius was a god of medicine and healing in ancient Greek and Roman religion. In Rome, there was a major temple to the god on Tiber Island, Isola Tiberina, located in the southern bend of the Tiber, and associated with the myth of how his worship was introduced to the City. BookTwoLIX His statue in Rome.\n\nBookFiveXXV Claudius stopped sick slaves being abandoned on the Island.\n\nAeserninus, see Claudius\n\nAesius Proculus was a leading centurion’s son noted for his good looks.\n\nBookFourXXXV Caligula had him executed.\n\nAetna is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, close to Messina and Catania.\n\nBookFourLI Its eruption scared Caligula.\n\nAetolia is is a mountainous region of Greece on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, forming the eastern part of the modern prefecture of Aetolia-Acarnania.\n\nBookTwoXVII Augustus met with a storm at sea between there and the Peloponnese in 30BC.\n\nAfer, see Tedius\n\nAfranius, Lucius was a comic poet, who lived at the beginning of the 1st century BC. His comedies described Roman scenes and manners (the genre called comoediae togatae) and the subjects were mostly taken from the life of the lower classes (comoediae tabernariae).\n\nBookSixXI His play ‘The Fire’ performed for Nero.\n\nAfranius, Lucius, d. 46BC was a legatus and client of Pompey. He served with Pompey during his Iberian campaigns against Sertorius in the late 70’s, and remained in his service through to the Civil War. He was killed after the Battle of Thapsus in 46BC.\n\nBookOneXXXIV Defeated by Caesar in Spain.\n\nBookOneLXXV His behaviour at Ilerda.\n\nAgamennon was a Greek king, leader of the army at Troy in Homer’s Iliad.\n\nBookThreeLXI Mentioned.\n\nAgermus, or Agerinus, was a freedman of Agrippina the Younger.\n\nBookSixXXXIV He was arrested on Nero’s orders.\n\nAgrippa, Marcus Vipsanius (c. 63BC – 12BC) was a close friend, and defence minister of the future emperor Augustus. He was responsible for many of his military victories, most notably Actium against the forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII of Egypt. He was son-in-law to Augustus, maternal grandfather of the Emperor Caligula, father-in-law of the Emperors Tiberius and Claudius, and maternal great-grandfather of the Emperor Nero. He probably served in Caesar’s campaign of 46/45BC against Pompey and Caesar regarded him highly enough to send him with Octavius in 45BC to study at Apollonia. From then on Agrippa played a major part in Augustus’ career, as military commander and admiral, also undertaking major public works inRome and elsewhere, and writing works on geography (following his survey of the Empire) and other subjects. His last campaign initiated the conquest of the upper Danube region, which would become the Roman province of Pannonia in 13BC. Augustus had Agrippa’s remains placed in his own mausoleum.\n\nBookTwoXVI His victories at Mylae and Naulochus in 36BC.\n\nBookTwoXXV He was granted the right to fly the blue ensign, off Sicily.\n\nBookTwoXXIX BookTwoXCVII He erected many fine buildings in Rome, including the original Pantheon on the Campus Martius (during his third consulship 27BC).\n\nBookTwoXXXV He assisted Augustus in pruning the Senate.\n\nBookTwoXLII Agrippa became aedile in 33BC in order to work on Augustus’ aqueduct projects. He restored the Appia, Anio Vetus, and Marcia, and combined an existing aqueduct, the Tepula, with a new aqueduct, the Julia.\n\nBookTwoLXIII He married Claudia Marcella the Elder, daughter of Octavia the Younger in 28BC, and Julia the Elder in 21BC.\n\nBookTwoLXIV His five children by Julia the Elder.\n\nBookTwoLXVI BookThreeX In 23BC, a year of constitutional crisis, Augustus fell ill and presented his signet ring to Agrippa, who seemed thus to be designated the emperor’s successor. Agrippa traveled to Mytilene on Lesbos, from which he administered affairs in the East. It has been argued that the Senate gave him an imperium greater than that of any other provincial governor in the East (imperium majus). After Augustus’ death Roman historians claimed that Agrippa’s journey to Mytilene was a self-imposed exile as a result of Augustus’ preference for his own nephew Marcellus.\n\nBookTwoXCIV He was at Apollonia in 45/44BC with Augustus, at which time both of their horoscopes were cast and indicated fortunate lives.\n\nBookThreeVII His daughter Agrippina Vipsania the Younger the married Tiberius.\n\nBookFourVII His daughter Agrippina Vipsania the Elder married Germanicus.\n\nBookFourXXIII Caligula despised Agrippa’s lowly origins.\n\nAgrippa Postumus, Marcus (12BC – 14AD) also known as Agrippa Postumus, or Postumus Agrippa, was a son of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder. His maternal grandparents were Augustus and his second wife Scribonia. Upon his adoption as the emperor’s son in 4AD, with Tiberius to guarantee the line of succession, he became Marcus Julius Caesar Vipsanianus Agrippa Postumus. Some time after 6AD, for reasons unknown but possibly conspiracy, Augustus banished Postumus to the small island of Planasia. Tacitus suggests that he was always disliked and shunned by Livia, as he stood in the way of her son Tiberius, who probably had Postumus executed on his accession.\n\nBookTwoXIX A plot mentioned to free him from Planasia.\n\nBookTwoLI A plebeian fined for libelling Augustus under his name.\n\nBookTwoLXIV Grandson of Augustus.\n\nBookTwoLXV BookThreeXV Adopted by Augustus in 4AD, he was exiled by him sometime after 6AD.\n\nBookThreeXXII He was executed at Augustus’ death on the written orders of Augustus, possibly signed by Livia and with the complicity of Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeXXV His slave Clemens pretended to be him after his dath, and gained a following, but was trapped and executed by Tiberius.\n\nAgrippina, Vipsania the Younger, (36BC - 20AD) was the daughter of Agrippa by his first wife Pomponia Caecilia Attica, and thereby the granddaughter of Cicero’s friend, the knight Caecilius Atticus. Octavian and her father betrothed her to Tiberius before her first birthday, and sometime after 19BC they married. Their son Drusus the Younger was born in 13BC. Her father Agrippa died in March, 12BC. He had been married to Julia the Elder, daughter of Augustus. Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce Vipsania and marry Julia. After the divorce, in 11BC she married Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus, a Senator and son of the orator Asinius Pollio. They had at least six sons. She died in 20AD, a few days after the ovation of her son Drusus, on 28 May. Tiberius detested Gallus, not least because Gallus claimed that Drusus was his own son. In 30AD, at Tiberius’ instigation, the Senate declared Gallus a public enemy (Cassius Dio 58.3). He died in prison in 33AD, of starvation.\n\nBookThreeVII She married Tiberius after 19BC.\n\nBookThreeX Her son by Tiberius, Drusus the Younger.\n\nAgrippina, Vipsania the the Elder (14BC - 33AD) was the wife of Germanicus, second granddaughter to Augustus; sister-in-law, stepdaughter and daughter-in-law to Tiberius; mother to Caligula; maternal second cousin and sister-in-law to Claudius and maternal grandmother to Nero. The second daughter and fourth child of Agrippa and Julia the Elder, Agrippina married her second maternal cousin Germanicus between 5 and 1BC. In 29AD, Agrippina and her sons Nero and Drusus, were arrested on the orders of Tiberius, and she was banished with her sons to the island of Pandataria (modern Ventotene) in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the coast of Campania, where it is claimed she ultimately starved herself to death. This was the island where her mother Julia the Elder had been banished. Caligula later retrieved her ashes and honoured her in Rome.\n\nBookTwoXXXIV BookFourVII Her children by Germanicus.\n\nBookTwoLXIV Her marriage to Germanicus, between 5BC and 1BC.\n\nBookTwoLXXXVI Augustus praises her accomplishments.\n\nBookThreeLII BookThreeLIII BookThreeLXIV BookFourXXX Tiberius’s cruel treatment of her, and her banishment to Pandataria.\n\nBookFourVIII Altars to her child-bearing in Gaul.\n\nBookFourX Caligula lived with her until her exile.\n\nBookFourXII Caligula supposedly wished to avenge her death.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula recovered her ashes from Pandataria in 37AD.\n\nBookFourXXIII Caligula claimed he was the product of her incest with her father Augustus.\n\nAgrippina the Younger, Julia Agrippina, or Agrippinilla (Little Agrippina) after 50AD known as Julia Augusta Agrippina (c. 16AD – 59AD) was sister of Caligula, niece and fourth wife of Claudius and the mother of Nero. In 28, Tiberius arranged for Agrippina to marry her paternal second cousin Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. Their only son was named Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after Domitius’s recently deceased father. This child would become the Emperor Nero. In 39AD, Agrippina and her sister Livilla, with their maternal cousin, Drusilla’s widower, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, were involved in a failed plot to murder Caligula, and make Lepidus emperor. Lepidus was executed.

He was the son of Antiochus III who died in 17AD, when Tiberius agreed that Commagene become a part of the province of Syria. Between 17AD and 38AD, Antiochus lived in Rome. In 38AD, Antiochus received his paternal dominion from Caligula but was subsequently deposed by him and did not obtain his kingdom again till the accession of Claudius in 41AD. In 55AD he received orders from Nero to make war against Parthia, and in 61AD obtained parts of Armenia. He supported Vespasian as emperor in 70AD, but in 72AD, was accused of conspiring with Parthia. Deprived of his kingdom, he retired to Sparta, then Rome, where he passed the remainder of his life.\n\nBookFourXVI Caligula paid him the taxes and revenues accumulated since his father’s death.\n\nAntistius, Lucius, was a tribune of the people, and a member of the gens Antistia a well-known plebeian family.\n\nBookOneXXIII He attempted to bring Julius Caesar to trial.\n\nAntistius was a physician who examined Caesar’s body after his assassination.\n\nBookOneLXXXII His opinion that only one of the wounds was fatal.\n\nAntistius Labeo, Marcus (d. c. 11AD) was a prominent jurist the son of Quintus Antistius Labeo, also a jurist who died at Philippi. A member of the plebeian nobility, Marcus rose to the praetorship; but his undisguised antipathy to the new regime, and his republican sympathies, what Tacitus calls his incorrupta libertas, proved an obstacle to advancement, and his rival, Ateius Capito was promoted by Augustus to the consulate, when the appointment should have fallen to Labeo, who later declined the office. His most important literary work was the Libri posteriores a systematic exposition of the common law. His Libri ad Edictum embraced a commentary, not only on the edicts of the praetors, but also on that of the curule aediles.\n\nBookTwoLIV His nomination of Augustus’ enemy Lepidus to the Senate.\n\nAntium, modern Anzio, is a city on the coast of the Lazio region of Italy, about 35 miles south of Rome. It was the capital of the Volsci until conquered by the Romans. Augustus had a villa there, as did Maecenas and both Caligula and Nero were born there.\n\nBookTwoLVIII Augustus received a delegation from Rome to acclaim him Pater patriae (Father of the Country)\n\nBookThreeXXXVIII The furthest from the City that Tiberius travelled during his period in Rome, after his accession.\n\nBookFourVIII The birthplace of Caligula according to Suetonius.\n\nBookFourXLIX Caligula had intentions of ruling from there temporarily.\n\nBookFourLVII Fortuna’s worship at Antium included a celebrated oracle, only slightly less famous than the oracle of Fortuna Primigenia at Praeneste.\n\nBookSixVI The birthplace of Nero.\n\nBookSixIX Nero founded a new colony there, relocating the wealthiest of the leading centurions, and building a harbour.\n\nBookSixXXV Nero entered the town triumphantly on his return from Greece in 67AD.\n\nAntonia the Elder (b. 39BC) was a daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia the Younger. c. 25BC, Antonia married Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16BC).\n\nBookSixV The mother of Gnaeus Domitius, Nero’s father.\n\nAntonia the Younger (36BC - 37AD) was a daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia the Younger. In 16BC, she married the Roman general and consul Nero Claudius Drusus the Elder, the stepson of her uncle Augustus, second son of Livia Drusilla and brother of future Emperor Tiberius. They had several children, but only three survived, Germanicus, Livilla, and Claudius. Antonia was the grandmother of the Emperor Caligula.\n\nBookFourI The mother of Germanicus.\n\nBookFourX She cared for Caligula until he joined Tiberius on Capri.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula awarded her all Livia’s honours on his accession in 37AD, before her death in October of that year.\n\nBookFourXXIII Caligula hastened her death, some say poisoned her.\n\nBookFourXXIV She caught Caligula and his sister Drusilla in an incestuous relationship.\n\nBookFourXXIX Caligula insults her.\n\nBookFiveI BookFiveIV The mother of Claudius.\n\nBookFiveIII Her disparaging comments on her son Claudius.\n\nBookFiveXI Claudius honoured her with the title Augusta.\n\nBookFiveXLI She warned the young Claudius over the sensitivity of the work on history he was writing.\n\nBookEightIII Caenis was a former slave and secretary of hers.\n\nAntonia, see Claudia Antonia\n\nAntonius Hybrida, Gaius, was the uncle of the triumvir Mark Antony. His military career started as a legate and cavalry commander of Sulla during the Mithridatic Wars, and earned his nickname ‘half-beast’, due to atrocities committed in Greece. In spite of his reputation, however, he was elected tribune in 71BC, praetor in 66BC, and finally consul with Cicero in 63BC. He became governor of Macedonia, where he made himself so detested that he was forced to leave the province. In 59BC, he was accused of having taken part in the Catiline conspiracy and of extortion in his province. Despite being defended by Cicero, Hybrida was condemned and went into exile at Kefalonia. He seems to have been recalled by Caesar, since he was present at a meeting of the Roman Senate in 44BC and was censor in 42BC.\n\nBookTwoV He was consul in the year of Augustus’ birth, 63BC.\n\nAntonius, Gaius (d. 42BC) was the second son of Marcus Antonius Creticus and Julia Antonia, and thus, younger brother of Mark Antony, the triumvir and enemy of Augustus. During the civil war, Gaius was a legate of Julius Caesar (49BC), and entrusted, with Publius Cornelius Dolabella, with the defence of Illyricum against the Pompeians. While Dolabella’s fleet was destroyed, Antonius was shut up in the island of Curicta and forced to surrender. After the assassination of Caesar, Gaius (as a Caesarean) was appointed governor to the Roman province of Macedonia. Marcus Junius Brutus and the other assassins, however, chose Macedonia as refuge from Octavian and dispossessed Antonius of his governorship. Brutus ultimately ordered his death.\n\nBookOneXXXVI His defeat off Illyricum.\n\nAntonius, Lucius was the younger brother and supporter of Mark Antony. After Caesar’s murder, he proposed an agrarian law in favor of the people and Caesar’s veterans, and took part in the operations at Mutina (43BC). In 41BC, he was consul with Publius Servilius Vatia. In that year, he raised an eight-legion army to fight against Octavian’s unpopular policies, subsequently marching on Rome, driving out Lepidus, and promising the abolition of the Triumvirate. On the approach of Octavian, he retired to Perusia in Etruria, where he was besieged by three armies, and compelled to surrender (40BC). The city was destroyed but his life was spared, and he was sent by Octavian to Spain as governor. Nothing is known of the circumstances or date of his death.\n\nBookTwoIX BookTwoXIV BookTwoXV BookThreeIV Defeated by the forces of Augustus (Octavian) at Perusia.\n\nBookTwoLXVII He accused Augustus of homosexuality.\n\nBookThreeV His consulship in 41BC.\n\nAntonius, Marcus (Mark Antony) (83BC – 30BC), was a Roman politician and general. He was an important supporter and the loyal friend of Gaius Julius Caesar as a military commander and administrator, being Caesar’s second cousin, once removed, by his mother Julia Antonia. After Caesar’s assassination, Antony formed an official political alliance with Octavian (Augustus) and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, called the Second Triumvirate. The triumvirate broke up in 33BC. Disagreement between Octavian and Antony erupted into civil war, the Final War of the Roman Republic, in 31BC. Antony was defeated by Octavian at the naval Battle of Actium, and in a brief land battle at Alexandria. He and his lover Cleopatra committed suicide shortly thereafter.\n\nBookOneLII He had attested to Caesarion being Caesar’s son by Cleopatra.\n\nBookOneLXXIX He attempted to crown Caesar in 44BC.\n\nBookOneLXXXII He prevented Caesar’s assassins carrying out their plans after the assassination.\n\nBookOneLXXXIII Caesar’s will was read at his house.\n\nBookOneLXXXIV His speech before Caesar’s bier in the Campus Martius.\n\nBookTwoII BookTwoIV BookTwoVI He poked fun at Augustus’ ancestry.\n\nBookTwoVIII BookTwoXIII He formed the Second Triumvirate, with Octavian and Lepidus.\n\nBookTwoIX BookTwoXI BookTwoXX BookTwoXLIX Defeated by Augustus (Octavian) at Mutina and finally at Actium.\n\nBookTwoX Blocked Augustus’ application for tribuneship, and mocked his contribution to the first battle at Mutina.\n\nBookTwoXII BookThreeIV He fled to join Lepidus after Mutina.\n\nBookTwoXIV His brother Lucius in alliance with him.\n\nBookTwoXVI Mark Antony’s taunting of Augustus regarding Naulochus.\n\nBookTwoXVII His will opened, his defeat at Actium, and his suicide.\n\nBookTwoXXI His standards lost to Parthia by his generals in 40BC and 36BC, were returned in 20BC.\n\nBookTwoXXVIII His charge that Augustus was an obstacle to restoring the Republic.\n\nBookTwoLXII Augustus married Antony’s step-daughter Claudia.\n\nBookTwoLXIII His claim that Augustus had betrothed Julia to his son Antyllus.\n\nBookTwoLXVII He accused Augustus of homosexuality.\n\nBookTwoLXIX BookTwoLXX He accused Augustus of various adulteries and debaucheries.\n\nBookTwoLXXXVI Augustus ridiculed his elaborate style of speech.\n\nBookThreeLIX BookSixIII Mentioned.\n\nBookFourXXVI Grandfather of Ptolemy of Mauretania.\n\nBookFiveXI Claudius honoured his grandfather Antony’s memory.\n\nAntonius, Marcus (Antyllus) (47BC - 30BC) or Marcus Antonius the Younger, also known as Antonius or Antyllus, was the son of Mark Antony by Fulvia. He was betrothed at one time to Octavian’s daughter Julia the Elder. After the alliance between his father and Octavian ended, the engagement was terminated. Between 40 and 36, he lived with his father, stepmother, Octavia the Younger, and siblings in his father’s mansion, in Athens. After 36BC, he lived his remaining years in Alexandria, at the court of Cleopatra VII of Egypt.\n\nBookTwoXVII Augustus had him killed.\n\nBookTwoLXIII Antony’s claim that Antyllus had been betrothed to Julia.\n\nAntonius, Iullus (43BC - 2BC), was the second son of Mark Antony and his third wife Fulvia. He is best known for being the lover of Julia the Elder. Iullus became praetor in 13BC, consul in 10BC and Asian proconsul in 7BC, and was highly regarded by Augustus. In 2BC, when Augustus acted against his daughter Julia’s promiscuity, Antonius was exposed as her lover. He was charged with treason and sentenced to death; subsequently committing suicide.\n\nBookFiveII Claudius born during his consulship.\n\nAntonius Musa was a botanist and Augustus’ physician. In 23BC, when Augustus was seriously ill, Musa cured the illness with cold baths, drinks and compresses, but reputedly failed to save Marcellus in his illness. His brother Euphorbus was physician to King Juba II of Numidia.\n\nBookTwoLIX Mentioned.\n\nBookTwoLXXXI He treated Augustus after the Cantabrian Campaign, possibly for typhoid fever for which cold fomentations are a rational treatment, rather than liver abscess.\n\nAntonius Primus, Marcus (b. before 36AD - d. after 81AD) was born at Tolosa (Toulouse) in Gaul. During Nero’s reign he was banished from Rome after a forgery charge. He was subsequently reinstated by Galba, and placed in command of a legion in Pannonia. During the civil war, Primus supported Vespasian. He gained a decisive victory over the Vitellians at Betriacum in October 69, and then stormed and set fire to Cremona. He then made his way to Rome. He must have been alive during the reign of Domitian, since four epigrams of Martial are addressed to him. His childhood nickname was Becco.\n\nBookSevenLIII Mentioned.\n\nAntonius Saturninus, Lucius, was the governor of Germania Superior during the reign of Domitian in 89AD. Motivated by a personal grudge he led a rebellion involving the legions Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, camped in Moguntiacum (Mainz). His Germanic allies were prevented from joining him by a sudden thaw of the river Rhine, and the revolt was quickly put down by Domitian’s general Trajan, who afterwards burned Saturninus’ letters in an attempt to avoid implicating others.\n\nBookEightXLII BookEightXLIII BookEightXLVI Mentioned.\n\nAntyllus, see Antonius, Marcus\n\nApelles of Ascalon was a tragic actor, and a companion of Caligula.\n\nBookFourXXXIII An incident involving him described.\n\nBookEightXIX Vespasian rewarded him.\n\nApis or Hapis, was a bull-deity symbolic of strength and fertility worshipped in the Memphis region of Egypt. Excavation of the Serapeum at Memphis has revealed the tombs of over sixty sacred bulls, the animals dating from the time of Amenophis III. Ptolemy I Soter integrated Apis with aspects of Osiris to create the Egyptian-Hellenistic deity Serapis. In Rome, Serapis was worshipped in the Iseum Campense, the sanctuary of the goddess Isis located in the Campus Martius and built during the Second Triumvirate.\n\nBookTwoXCIII Augustus disdained to visit the Apis sanctuary.\n\nBookEightXXX Titus attended the Apis bull’s consecration ceremony at Memphis.\n\nApollo, in Greek and Roman mythology, was a god of light and the sun; truth and prophecy; archery; medicine, healing and plague; music, poetry, the arts; and more.

The serpent was associated with Apollo as a symbol after the god rid Delphi of the Python.\n\nBookThreeLXXIV The ‘Apollo of Temenos’ was presumably from The Temple of Apollo on the island of Ortygia in Syracuse, Sicily, a Greek temple dating from the 6th century BC. Temenos simply means sacred space. This is the oldest peripteral (possessing a row of columns on each side) Doric temple in the world.\n\nBookFourXXI Caligula planned to restore the Temple of Apollo at Didyma, the modern Didim, Turkey. Next to Delphi, Didyma was the most renowned oracle of the Hellenic world, and is mentioned in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. Didyma was the largest and most significant sanctuary near the great classical city of Miletus.\n\nBookSixXXV The Pythian Games (Delphic Games) were held every four years at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi.\n\nBookSixXXXIX Paeon, the Healer, was an epithet of Apollo, as was the contrary name of the Far-Darter. The god could ambivalently bring death or healing.\n\nBookSixLIII Nero flatteringly acclaimed as his equal in music.\n\nApollodorus of Pergamon, was one of the two most prominent teachers of rhetoric in the 1st century BC, the other being Theodorus of Gadara.\n\nBookTwoLXXXIX Augustus studied under him.\n\nApollonia was an Ancient Greek city and colony in northern Epirus, now modern-day Albania, located on the right bank of the Aous River; its ruins are situated in the Fier region, near the village of Pojani. It was founded in 588BC by colonists from Kerkyra (Corfu) and Corinth. Like Dyrrachium further north, it was an important port on the Illyrian coast as the most convenient link between Brundusium and northern Greece, and as one of the western starting points of the Via Egnatia leading east to Thessaloniki and Byzantium in Thrace. Augustus studied in Apollonia in 45BC - 44BC under the tutelage of Athenodorus of Tarsus; it was there that he received news of Caesar’s murder.\n\nBookTwoVIII BookTwoX BookTwoLXXXIX BookTwoXCIV BookTwoXCV Augustus studied there in 45BC - 44BC.\n\nApollonius Molon was a Greek rhetorician who flourished about 70 BC. He was a native of Alabanda, a pupil of Menecles, and settled at Rhodes. He twice visited Rome as an ambassador from Rhodes, and Marcus Tullius Cicero (who visited him during his trip to Greece in 79BC - 77BC) and Gaius Julius Caesar both took lessons from him.\n\nBookOneIV Caesar decided to study rhetoric with him.\n\nApollophanes, one of Sextus Pompey’s admirals.\n\nBookTwoXVI Mentioned, commanding off Sicily c. 36BC.\n\nAponius Saturninus was a praetor at the time of Caligula.\n\nBookFourXXXVIII Caligula knocked down an auction lot to him while he was asleep.\n\nAppius, see Claudius and Junius\n\nAppuleius, Sextus, was related to Augustus, and a consul in the year of Augustus’ death.\n\nBookTwoC He was consul in 14AD.\n\nAquileia was a Roman city at the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about 10 km from the sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has altered since Roman times.

It lies in present-day southwest France, where it gives its name to the modern region of Aquitaine. Caesar named Aquitania as the triangular territory between the Atlantic, the Pyrenees and the Garonne. He fought and almost completely subdued the tribes in 56BC, though rebellions ensued up to 27BC - 28BC, Agrippa gaining a great victory over the Gauls of Aquitania in 38BC. A land extension stretching to the Loire River was added by Augustus, and Aquitania became an imperial province.\n\nBookTwoXXI Finally subdued by Agrippa.\n\nBookSevenVI Galba was governor of Aquitania for almost a year.\n\nBookSevenIX Galba received a request for aid from its governor.\n\nArchelaus IV (d. 17AD) was the last King of Cappadocia. In 36BC, he was made king by triumvir Mark Antony, whom, however, he deserted after Actium. Augustus enlarged his kingdom by adding parts of Cilicia and Lesser Armenia. He was not popular with his subjects, who brought an accusation against him in Rome on which occasion he was defended by the young Tiberius. He was the great grandfather of Julius Tigranes, King of Armenia under Nero. After 8BC, Archelaus married Queen Pythodorida of Pontus. Subsequently he was accused by the Emperor Tiberius, of endeavouring to stir up revolution, and died in confinement in Rome. Cappadocia was then made a Roman province.\n\nBookThreeVIII Tiberius acted as his advocate in Rome.\n\nBookThreeXXXVII Detained by Tiberius.\n\nArelate, modern Arles, is a city in the south of France, in the former province of Provence. The Romans took the town in 123BC and expanded it into an important city, with a canal link to the Mediterranean in 104BC. However, it struggled to escape the shadow of Massalia (Marseille) further along the coast. Massalia however backed Pompey; and when Caesar emerged victorious, Massalia was stripped of its possessions, which were transferred to Arelate. The town was formally established as a colony for veterans of the Roman legion Legio VI Ferrata.\n\nBookThreeIV Tiberius’ father, Tiberius Nero, established a colony of Caesar’s veterans there.\n\nAreus, of Alexandria, was a Stoic or Pythagorean philosopher who enjoyed the favour of Augustus and Livia in Rome.

In 43BC, Octavian joined forces with Mark Antony and Lepidus in the Second Triumvirate, which was eventually torn apart, Lepidus being driven into exile, while Antony committed suicide after his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian’s fleet commanded by Agrippa, in 31BC. Octavian restored the outward forms of the Roman Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, but in practice retained autocratic power.
