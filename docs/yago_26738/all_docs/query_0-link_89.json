        "text": "Most scholarship on women and their position in antiquity generally agrees that women's status was largely low. Relatedly, in the ancient Republican Rome, women had no significant political, economic, legal and social rights. However, by the Imperial period, it appeared that the status quo was altered as many Roman women pursued tall ambitions such as desire for wealth, political power, fame, elegance, adornment and control of their families. Using the mistresses, wives, mothers, and daughters that were either married or related to first century Julio-Claudian Caesars as a case study, this paper examined women's struggle for ambition, dominance, and control of the Roman Empire. Approached chronologically through a method of content analysis of archival materials and the evidence provided by Roman writers such as Tacitus, Livy, Sallust, and Seneca, the paper highlighted some ambitious behaviours of selected women within the period 31B.C. – A.D.68. Rather than exude the virtues of true matronae (noble women) to advance their society, Caesars' women exhibited flagrant indiscipline, immorality, and wickedness in form of subtle naggings, conspiracies, promiscuity, prostitution, debaucheries, poisonings, and murders of relations in order to achieve their varied notorious ambitions. The paper concluded specifically that these women's drives ultimately contributed to the collapse of socio-political order under the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nMost scholarship on women and their position in antiquity generally agrees that women's status was largely low.

Nor is it my intention to rehearse in detail the background and significant events associated with the 1st century CE female rulers of the Iceni and Brigantes, Boudica and Cartimandua; or, more briefly, with the Julio-Claudian women of power and influence, Valeria Messalina and Julia Agrippina. Rather, I want to examine the literary sources that form the substance of the historical record as it relates to the years leading up to the rebellion of Boudica (43-60/61 CE ). I hope to show how these sources intersect with the representations of contemporary females of historical significance and to indicate some of the problems and difficulties encountered in their use. This will entail some comment on the representations in the same sources of the principes Claudius and Nero and their British contemporaries."
