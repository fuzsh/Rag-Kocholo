        "text": "“Do not eat Agrippina’s mushrooms” is a thought journal. I don’t mean it to be a daily account of my deeds, but somewhere I can write the ideas, opinions, and thoughts that I have as I travel through life. It can be interesting to some, and perhaps not so much to others. As I publish more, I’ll be able to identify the patterns in my writings and will be able to classify each entry properly. I’m also pledging to post at least once a week and to be engaging.\n\n“Why did you choose such a quirky title for your blog?” you might ask. Reading about Roman History is one of my hobbies. Agrippina the Younger was an important woman of the first imperial family, the Julio-Claudians: the great-granddaughter of Emperor Augustus, the wife of Emperor Claudius and mother of Emperor Nero. She was politically savvy and very controversial. I like Agrippina: she embodies the female archetype that I like the most, the Athena woman. Like the goddess, the Athena woman is not afraid of getting her hands dirty to achieve her purposes and is not afraid of any men that might be in her way. Agrippina was such a woman.\n\nAncient historians, however, tarnished her name. Roman senators were not fond of women in power, and Agrippina, just like her great-grandmother Livia, was turned into a power-hungry virago who would do anything to achieve her means. While I am sure that Agrippina was not the easiest person to deal with, I think ancient historians are wrong about her character. Claudius’ rule became enlightened after his marriage to Agrippina, and Nero heavily relied on his mother’s patronage networks to make his early administration successful.\n\nOne of the tales Agrippina is most famous about is related to mushrooms. Nero claimed that mushrooms were the food for the gods for Claudius had eaten some and had become a god. Romans had the custom of deifying their dead emperors, and Nero implied that his mother had poisoned Claudius so he could become emperor. No one knows how true the story is, but Nero had his mother assassinated a few years into his rule for selfish reasons and political maneuvres. I named the blog “Do not eat Agrippina’s mushrooms” because being a god means being dead to the world’s experiences. I do not mean to bash Agrippina, for she is one of my favorite roman personalities, but I liked the quirkiness of the title. Let’s focus on not becoming gods and live what the universe brings to our lives."
