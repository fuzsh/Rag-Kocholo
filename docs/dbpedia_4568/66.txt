Promising basis for a Luhmann Archive

Many consider the sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927â€“1998) to be one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century. In 1968, he became the first ever professor at Bielefeld University where he taught until his retirement in 1993. Even just in terms of size, Luhmann's exceptionally challenging scientific work is enormous, encompassing a good 50 of his own books and hundreds of articles in which he comprehensively developed his theory of social systems. One secret behind Luhmann's productivity is certainly his legendary "card box".
