        "meta_description": "Of the writers included in this book, Niklas Luhmann is unquestionably, and in many ways, the most comprehensive. He has written more than 50 books and over 400 articles. One of his goals has been to test the general stating power of systems theory by writing at least one book about each of the function systems of modern society. Hence, he has conducted extensive historical analyses of the scientific system, the political system, the system of arts, the educational system, the system of justice, the system of regions, love and family as a system, the system of mass media, and the system of economics. But his work is also the most comprehensive in another respect. Of the authors in this volume, Luhmann’s work probably involves the highest number of different theoretical questions, provides the widest scope of theoretical approaches and possesses the highest degree of flexibility for the elaboration of projects within theory. However, in this book, we are not concerned with the many analyses of different social systems but only with the Luhmanian ‘eye’ for social systems as communication. Luhmann’s path towards the ‘communication-theoretical turn’ is completely different from that of Laclau and Foucault. The communication-theoretical turn did not appear until around 1980. Prior to this, Luhmann had suggested that meaning was the fundamental concept of sociology (Luhmann, 1990b, pp 21-79), but it was not until the beginning of the 1980s that he changed his notion of social systems as systems of action to an understanding of these systems as autopoietic systems of communication, consisting in and by communication. To a certain extent, Luhmann’s systems theory can be viewed as a communication-theoretical rewriting of the systems theory of Talcot Parsons.",
