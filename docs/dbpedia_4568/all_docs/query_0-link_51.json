        "text": "âGreat intellectual curiosityâ\n\nHistorian Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger awarded Bielefeld Science Prize\n\nThe early modern historian Prof. Dr. Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger, Deputy Speaker of the Cluster of Excellence âReligion and Politicsâ, will be awarded this yearâs Bielefeld Science Prize, as was announced by Bielefeld University. âWith Prof. Stollberg-Rilinger, we honour a scholar who is not only one of the most outstanding representatives of her discipline, but who has also kept crossing disciplinary boundaries with great intellectual curiosity,â explains the rector of Bielefeld University and chairman of the jury, Professor Dr.-Ing. Gerhard Sagerer. âIn her research, Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger has always looked beyond the boundaries of her field, drawing her inspiration from sociology and not least also from Niklas Luhmann.â\n\nSince 2004, the Bielefeld Science Prize has been awarded in memory of sociologist Niklas Luhmann by the foundation âStiftung der Sparkasse Bielefeldâ in association with Bielefeld University and the city of Bielefeld.\n\nCultural history of the political\n\nAccording to the jury of the Bielefeld Science Prize, Prof. Stollberg-Rilinger has opened up a new perspective on the practices of power and the exercise of power not only to the science of history with her programme of a cultural history of the political. Her books, which are read far beyond the boundaries of the discipline, include âDes Kaisers alte Kleider. Verfassungsgeschichte und Symbolsprache des Alten Reichesâ (The Emperors Old Clothes. Constitutional History and Symbolic Language of the Old Kingdom; 2008) and the biography âMaria Theresia: Die Kaiserin in ihrer Zeitâ (Maria Theresa: the Empress in Her Times; 2017). In them, she succeeds in âmaking the foreignness of the early modern period vivid and understandable without abandoning the difference between then and now or describing early modernity as a phase of the ânot yetââ.\n\nThe award ceremony is expected to take place early next year. The laudatory speech will be given by historian Prof. Dr JÃ¼rgen Osterhammel from the University of Konstanz, a âleading representative of global historyâ, according to the University of Bielefeld.\n\nThe early modern historian Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger has since 1997 held the Chair for Early Modern History at the University of MÃ¼nster. She received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the German Research Foundation (DFG) in 2005 and the German historian prize âPreis des Historischen Kollegsâ of the Historische Kolleg in Munich in 2013. From 2011 to 2015, she was Speaker of the Cluster of Excellence âReligion and Politicsâ at the University of MÃ¼nster and has been deputy speaker since then. She will become Director of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin in September, remaining professor at the University of MÃ¼nster and principal investigator of the Cluster of Excellence. Her biography about Maria Theresa has received numerous awards, including the Leipzig Book Fair Prize. (Bielefeld University/sca/maz)"
