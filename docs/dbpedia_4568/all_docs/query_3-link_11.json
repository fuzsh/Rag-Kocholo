        "text": "@Annabella said:\n\n@GraemeWeston\n\nI'm reading the chapter on Niklas' Zettelkasten from Forgetting Machines edited by Alberto Cevolini. An argument that one of the writers made reminded me of your post. The argument was that Niklas started a second Zettelkasten probably because they needed to bring a top-level Folgezettel structure that would fit into their new interest. You can tell because Niklas' first Zettelkasten was about completely different things in comparison to the second. Also, they're organized differently Folgezettel-wise.\n\nI think that the Luhmann-ID might not be what you want. What if, later on in your journey, you decide that the current top-level Folgezettel structure doesn't fit your interests? You'll have to re-index everything, which would be time-consuming, or make a second Zettelkasten. If you choose the latter, you can then ignore the first Zettelkasten, as Niklas mostly did, or not but that would be time-consuming too."
