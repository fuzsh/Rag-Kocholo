        "text": "How extensive the literature notes should be really depends on the text and what we need it for. It also depends on our ability to be concise, the complexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand. As literature notes are also a tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notes make sense in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might be sufficient to just jot down some keywords. Luhmann, certainly being on the outer spectrum of expertise, contented himself with pretty short notes and was still able to turn them into valuable slip-box notes without distorting the meaning of the original texts.[27] It is mainly a matter of having an extensive latticework of mental models or theories in our heads that enable us to identify and describe the main ideas quickly (cf. Rickheit and Sichelschmidt, 1999). Whenever we explore a new, unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn’t get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip. Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single sentence. The only thing that matters is that these notes provide the best possible support for the next step, the writing of the actual slip-box notes\n\n@Sascha said:\n\n@Nick To me, it seems that Ahrens is not that familiar with Luhmanns endproducts: Very often Luhmann's references indicated that he took the reference as mere inspiration to put it euphemistically. If you read him in the original you ask yourself quite often how his reference relates to what he wrote.\n\nI would be open for the idea that Luhmann himself did not just wrote three words and then remembered all the essentials of the important paragraphs he read, but often just was in the flow and wrote what came to mind in reaction to his notes.\n\nI wouldn't be suprised if the notes shown in the presentation resulted in some odd references.\n\nBeginners, especially beginning students, find that they are first confronted with a mass of words, which are ordered in sentence-form, which they read sentence by sentence, and which they can understand as sentences. But what is important? What must be “learned?” What is important, what is mere adornment? After a few pages of reading, one can hardly remember what one has read. Which recommendations can be offered?\n\nOne possibility is to remember names: Marx, Freud, Giddens, Bourdieu, etc. Obviously most knowledge can also be ordered by names, eventually also by names of theories such as social phenomenology, theory of reception in the literary disciplines, etc. Even introductions to sociology and basic texts are conceived in this way. What one cannot learn from such works, however, are conceptual connections and especially the nature of the problems that these texts try to solve. Still, even candidates in exams at the end of their studies want to be examined on Max Weber or, if that is too much, on Humberto Maturana, and they are prepared to report on what they know about these authors.\n\nThe problem of reading theoretical texts seems to consist in the fact that they do not require just short-term memory but also long-term memory in order to be able to distinguish between what is essential and what is not essential and what is new from what is merely repeated. But one cannot remember everything. This would simply be learning by heart. In other words, one must read very selectively and must be able to extract extensively networked references. One must be able to understand recursions. But how can one learn these skills, if no instructions can be given; or perhaps only about things that are unusual like “recursion” in the previous sentences as opposed to “must”?\n\nPerhaps the best method would be to take notes—not excerpts, but condensed reformulations of what has been read. The re-description of what has already been described leads almost automatically to a training of paying attention to “frames,” or schemata of observation, or even to noticing conditions which lead the text to offer some descriptions but not others.\n\n@GeoEng51 said:\n\nI am always interested in how other people create and use their ZK, and see if I can learn something from them that I can apply to my own ZK. But in the end, I don't worry very much about if I can get their system to work for me, or even if I understand their system. I just work away on the basics - my Zettels - writing them, connecting them, adding tags, seeing where that takes me, and (rarely) writing a structure note if that seems to make sense, for example if the number of zettels linked together in a line of thinking is starting to get long.\n\n@Gabi said:\n\nI am an average researcher with normal capabilities and a novice in the ZK method. This is what I do about Lit Notes:\n\n1) I make a Map of the source (article or chapter). That is, I make a list of ideas and keywords on a card, with page numbers, for further reference. Like Luhmann's \"long\" biblio note, I just call it a \"map.\" This goes into my Biblio box.\n\n2) If the source is complex, I take more copious notes in Citavi. Because I may need details of that argument later.\n\n3) The ideas (pertinent to my present interest) that I get from the reading will go, in my own words, to Permanent Notes. If I paraphrase the author, I indicate that this is a paraphrase, and specify the page number.\n\n4) Exact quotes from the critical Lit (no more than 1 or 2 by source) also go into Permanent. This is because I write literary criticism and (Alas!) I am not building a theoretical oeuvre like Luhmann. When I want to quote other critics I need not jump boxes."
