        "text": "@damianrocks said:\n\n1) When I think and want to create new notes... having to search existing notes in the Zettelkasten stops my thinking flow.\n\nI am wondering if it’s not better to just create note without connection when I think... and only then look at the possible connections.\n\nSwitching context from creating to linking comes with unbearable costs if not carefully planned and watched. These costs run a spectrum. Sometimes there is little toll when switching especially if there is some familiarity with the topic. Sometimes, as you describe, the costs are stifling and prevent a smooth transition.\n\nSeparating the two modes can help. This period of separation is almost a requirement. It can be conducive to creativity to let the subconscious work unmonitored. The steps would be, create a zettel, set it aside for fermentation like a baker would, in a proofing oven, and returning to link it into the full zettelkasten.\n\nThe most important step is returning to link the zettel. Without this step, you have fallen into The Collector’s Fallacy. This is the discipline required to be successful. Without dedication to this step, you'll flounder.\n\nWhen I want to create a new content... going to the Zettelkasten kills my creative flow. As I am not creating academic content (but marketing content)... The most important in the content isn’t the information, but the emotion (you can only put emotion in a content with your first brain in a specific mood)\n\nWhen you create content that is non-text think of your zettelkasten as an instruction manual. Notes on how a photo was manipulated, a poster was drawn, a marketing package format. Things like that, that might be repeated in the future and mixed in different contexts.\n\nMostly and ideally a zettelkasten is full of ideas and memes, with little or no data. I'm not sure how your idea of information lands here. Maybe we're equating emotion with ideas and information with data. In which case love the emotion with a zettel and jettison the information.\n\n... I am wondering if a Zettelkasten is the best tool for me.\n\nHum? Maybe. Other tools have as steep, if not steeper learning curves and require their own levels of dedication.\n\n... And why mainy people create longer note with digital zettelkasten.\n\nBecause we can, we are not limited to A6 and have a full-text search.\n\nI'm totally chaotic in my approach, and it doesn't really bother me. After all, my notes archive is for me, not for anyone else. So I don't worry about anything much except recording where something came from (be it a book, article, website, or my own head). I take the view that I will probably discover things that would benefit from linking as I am reading through what I have gathered, quite possibly long after I originally recorded them. I regard this as being likely to be a never-ending process. This view probably stems partly from my background in psychology, so I see the process as being like organic growth in which ideas will float to the surface when they are ready, not when we want them to. Others have a more \"engineering\" approach -- which is equally valid!\n\nAs I always say, I think we have to find a method that works for us. The fact that something works for others is not really a guarantee of effectiveness in our own particular case. And I also think that the effort put into finding our own method is very useful. Even the failures teach us valuable things -- perhaps especially the failures. We may eventually come back to the method that we first read about in whatever book or website that it was, but the journey will have taught us things. And in my own case, I don't think I've ever come across a method that suited me 100%. I always have to modify it in some way. So I suppose I would say that I take elements of the Zettelkasten method that I feel are useful to me (especially having UUIDs for items, and trying to keep notes limited to a single/concept/topic/whatever, though that is quite difficult at times), but I am not religious about the method. Maybe because I don't need to be, because I am not building some great knowledgebase for myself or others. I'm just pottering around and picking up some interesting bits and pieces. Collecting, probably. But I quite enjoy that\n\nFirst, wow. Thanks for your feedbacks guys.\n\nI have read them 3-4 times each.\n\n@Will So, what I understand is: you create a Zettel without thinking about what is already in the Zettelkasten. Then you create the link.\n\nYou don’t bother that much with duplicates right ? What is important is the emergent structure of the notes.\n\nI am not sure if I really grasp the subtility of this 2 paragraphs :\n\nWhen you create content that is non-text think of your zettelkasten as an instruction manual. Notes on how a photo was manipulated, a poster was drawn, a marketing package format. Things like that, that might be repeated in the future and mixed in different contexts.\n\nWhat do you mean is: Look at the final product and ask yourself what is the different pieces ?\n\nMostly and ideally a zettelkasten is full of ideas and memes, with little or no data. I'm not sure how your idea of information lands here. Maybe we're equating emotion with ideas and information with data. In which case love the emotion with a zettel and jettison the information.\n\nDo you mean : capturing the emotion inside a Zettel directly ?\n\n@GeoEng51 question for you:\n\nI might then write down whatever ideas are in my brain, trying to capture them in a \"flow of consciousness\" manner. After that, if I still feel inspired, I'll go back and try to process those quick thoughts into a proper zettel. But I might let the ideas stew in my brain for a few hours or days, before coming back for the last step\n\nSo you don’t put all your idea inside your Zettelkasten like a skeptic tank (Luhmann’s words) ?\n\nBut you process the fleeting notes, than create a proper Zettel right ?\n\nAnd my real question : When you create the « real » Zettel... this is when you look for duplicate and connection ? (Or you write, and then connect)\n\nI ask this, because I feel lot of friction to take new notes because of the need to feed a connection before creating the note.\n\nMaybe it’s better for me to just create a Zettel (with an UUID) and then connect the notes to other Zettel.\n\nSome Zettel are just draft of little thoughts... and with emergence some sharper concepts Zettel emerge naturally in a structure.\n\n@MartinBB\n\nI don't need to be, because I am not building some great knowledgebase for myself or others. I'm just pottering around and picking up some interesting bits and pieces. Collecting, probably. But I quite enjoy that\n\nSo you are using your Zettelkasten not as a thinking tool... but more as an ideas collecting tool ?\n\nThis is interesting in my case, because as I am not an academic researcher... my job is more about finding good ideas to mix and share... than theorizing new concepts.\n\nThank you for your amazing feedbacks. (This forum and his members are really high quality)\n\nHave a nice day,\n\nDamian\n\n@damianrocks said:\n\nSo you are using your Zettelkasten not as a thinking tool... but more as an ideas collecting tool ?\n\nThis is interesting in my case, because as I am not an academic researcher... my job is more about finding good ideas to mix and share... than theorizing new concepts.\n\nI am a \"sort-of\" academic (now retired). My main work has been in history and psychology (nowadays counselling and psychotherapy). I have had to do an enormous amount of collecting over the decades, and for a long time I used DEVONthink as a repository for the material. Much of it was original source material (transcriptions of letters, documents, and so forth, that I had found in archives), much of it was quotes from books, and there were maps, pictures, and I don't know what else.\n\nWhen you have to travel 300 miles to visit an archive, and spend three expensive nights in a hotel, your work is more like a commando raid than anything else. At the archive you ask for as many documents as they will let you consult at a time, copy as many of them as you can, send them back, ask for more, copy those, and eventually you travel back home with the vague idea (hope?) that you have some useful material, but you are not really sure, because you probably haven't read much of it very carefully. You dump everything into your own archive, and depending on where you are in the process, you may collect some more material, or you may start looking at what you already have.\n\nThe whole thing is very cyclical, or iterative. What you collect can often set you off on collecting more. I once looked at the reference section of a book and was thunderstruck to discover a whole ton of material that I didn't know existed. It took me about nine months to work through what I found that day.\n\nAnyway, I am very familiar with collecting, as it has been an essential part of my work. It is very difficult to say in advance whether something will be useful for a piece of writing I may be planning. And in any case, if it is not useful for the present piece, it might well be useful for some piece in the future.\n\nI would hesitate to say that I have a \"genuine\" Zettelkasten at the moment. I think of it as a notes archive that is gradually morphing towards a Zettelkasten, though I doubt it will ever be a \"proper\" one. I am not a social scientist like Luhmann, and my needs are probably different from his. It is useful for me to have a note with a verbatim quote from Freud, or Napoleon, for example, because I may need to quote it myself. And if it is in my notes archive, I know where I can find it, and if it has a UUID, I will always be able to go straight to it from another note that refers to it.\n\nSo, I would agree that my notes archive is not really a thinking tool. For me it is a finding tool. And that is OK for my purposes. I'm not trying to do what Luhmann did. My ambitions are much more limited. I just want to find that blasted quote/idea/concept that someone came up with so I can quote it or refer to it myself. And I know from experience that it can take me anything from a few seconds to several days to find the text that I wanted. I'm trying to cut down the search times."
