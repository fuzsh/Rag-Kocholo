With a digital system, you can create sequences on the fly through lists of links. The benefit of having one note directly next to the other (\"juxtaposition\" in my post) is outweighed by clickable links.\n\n@wlars said:\n\nIn my current point of view I think Luhmann's approach to IDs is a central part of his whole \"Zettelkasten\" method. Only by using this kind of approach to IDs the benefits of the whole method can be gained.\n\nI think this is somewhat of a technical question. Luhmann was using an analog system, he was doing everything manually. He had to devise his system in such a way that it would help him to be as fast as possible. Otherwise, Zettelkasten would've never been so successful for him.\n\nBut we're using digital systems. Computers do the work for us. And at such simple tasks computers are orders of magnitude faster than us.\n\nEven without special data structures and algorithms, modern computers will easily work with any Zettelkasten. Even 23,000 of Luhmann's notes are nothing compared to billions of records that Google handles every second. The only way for a normal person to grow their Zettelkasten to such a size that it'll cause problems is... to become immortal.\n\nFun fact: Sascha and Christian use their Zettelkasten as a very simple relational database. The relational model is well established in Computer Science. So, if you ever have any issues, you can just start using any high-performance relational database. Or NoSQL, if it's your jam.\n\n@ctietze said:\n\nI recently linked to a couple on central posts on this topic here:\n\nhttps://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/3530#Comment_3530\n\nAlso see the discission \"Thoughts on Folgezettel\" for more.\n\nTL;DR: Luhmann's system is super useful to organize physical sequences of notes in a sensible way.

I am new to Zettlekasten and I am stuck at an ID system for my file naming structure. I would still timestamp my notes, but i am not sure about having a timestamp in the filename.\n\nWhat I still prefer to see in my folder is a filename structure that's easy to read. If for wat ever reason I don't have a tool I still want to be able to view my filenames in the same style as Luhnmann's id system. I like timestamps...but having filenames as dates doesn't show me the relationships in my directory system.\n\nExample 1: file name date stamps\n\n20210101.md\n\n20210102.md\n\n20210501.md\n\netc...\n\nExample 2: Luhmanns ID system applied for filenames\n\n1.md\n\n1a.md\n\n2.md\n\n2a.md\n\n2b.md\n\n2b1.bd\n\netc...\n\nplain text is future proof...but timestamped filenames is visually impossible to see the relationship's in my opinion. I am only speaking from point of view at visually glancing my filenames in my filesystem.\n\nMaybe I am missing something?\n\nI don't have a Mac. I am on windows trying to decide between obsidian, zettlr or anything else i can find.\n\nI'd consider filenames that were of the format - UID(Timestamp) Title.md or UID(Luhmanns ID) Title.md. Include the title in the file name. The combo of UID and Title give so much more information.\n\nEither would work. Both show different points of view at a visual glance. I consider Luhmanns ID system harder as it takes time to slot the note correctly to get the ID, whereas timestamping is done in software. I can describe connections verbosely within a note. I don't feel I've missed anything by not using Luhmanns IDs. Remember, he didn't have a full-text search.\n\nWill Simpson\n\nMy zettelkasten is for my ideas, not the ideas of others. I will try to remember this. I must keep doing my best even though I'm a failure. My peak cognition is behind me. One day soon, I will read my last book, write my last note, eat my last meal, and kiss my sweetie for the last time.\n\nkestrelcreek.com\n\nEither or OR both? It probably doesn't matter.\n\nDon't let this be the reason for procrastination. How about flipping a coin? You can change later with a simple script to rename files. Or you can intermingle both ID systems.\n\nIn the final go, I'd recommend going exclusively with UID(Timestamp) Title.md and ignoring all the esoteric discussions about the old man's ID system. He did what he did with the tools he had available. We have vastly superior tools. Lucky us!\n\nWill Simpson\n\nMy zettelkasten is for my ideas, not the ideas of others. I will try to remember this.
