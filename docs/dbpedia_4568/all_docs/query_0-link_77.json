Eva Illouz is professor at the the Department of Sociology and Anthropology since 2006. Her research interests include the field of Cultural Studies, Social and Cultural Anthropology, Cultural Sociology and Feminist Theory. She is an expert and well known for her research in sociology of culture, sociology of emotions, sociology of capitalism, and the effects of capitalism on emotional life. Her work is applied in many research disciplines, including literature, anthropology, and sociology.\n\nDuring her stay at the Faculty of Sociology in Bielefeld from 19 June to July and for a second stay for two weeks in October Eva Illouz will hold a public lecture to the topic »What is Capitalist Subjectivity?« (19 June, 6 p.m., main building, H1). Moreover she will give a seminar entitled »The Paradoxes of Capitalism and Emotions« for doctoral researchers at the Bielefeld Graduate School in History and Sociology (BGHS).\n\nFor the first time in 2005, the Faculty of Sociology and the Rectorate of Bielefeld University established a Niklas-Luhmann-guest professorship. The intention of this guest professorship is to attract internationally renowned sociologists in order to offer the students and a wider academic as well as non-academic public audience the opportunity to become directly acquainted with influential and innovative theories."
