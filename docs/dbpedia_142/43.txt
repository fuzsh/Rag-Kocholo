Animal Crossing: New Horizons [Edit] [Talk]

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a life simulation game released worldwide on March 20, 2020 for the Nintendo Switch. It is the sixth mainline Animal Crossing game. The main change for this game is the theme of a Deserted Island Getaway. Instead of moving into an existing town, the player helps develop their island from an uninhabited island to a modest town.

Gameplay[]

The main gameplay is similar to the previous entries in the series with the player controlling a single villager using tools and interacting with villagers on a real-time schedule. The crafting system expands on what things players can collect and customize. The Nook Miles program is similar to achievements that can help guide players into certain activities.

The game features new tools in the form of the vaulting pole which allows players to cross bodies of water and the ladder, which allows the player to scale cliffs. There are later tools that help the player manage and terraform the island. However, the tool system has been changed that the tools now degrade rapidly with use though higher tiers last longer and are more effective.

A new feature with New Horizons is the fact that the player can decorate the outside with furniture. This can be stacked like inside decorating with virtually no limitations. Created patterns can also be placed on the ground. Inside decorating keeps the decorating mode from Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer.

Crafting System[]

The new crafting system introduces a large variety of new mechanics. Most of the features on the island now produce materials for crafting on top of the normal fishing and bug catching. The trees now produce branches and pieces of wood while all the rocks can now be hit like money rocks to produce materials like stone and iron nuggets. Even trash can be converted into furniture or clothing.

Taking these materials to a workbench will allow the player to construct various tools and pieces of furniture. However, the player will need to learn DIY recipes to make them. Several are given to the player in initial days by various important characters while others can be bought with upgrade facilities. Most of them are learned randomly through villagers, messages in bottles and with presents in balloons.

The new facilities in towns are now unlocked by providing the proper materials and crafting the appropriate kits rather than supplying enough Bells. Rather than bringing Isabelle around, the player just goes to the spot and guidelines will show where it will be with an option to imagine it to show how it will actually look and what things it removes by being placed there. Any furniture or materials that gets removed will appear in the Town Hall Recycling Bin. The player also has control over where Villagers will move in. However, they need a much wider space than a simple facility for their outside furniture. Additionally, they will need pieces of furniture for both the inside and outside before their house can be built. These items of furniture can be crafted though.

Nook Miles[]

The Nook Miles system is an achievement system built into the game similar to badges from previous entries. Players unlock Nook Miles as a reward for completing various challenges and goals with more earned as the player gets higher levels in challenges. The player also gets Nook Miles+ after purchasing a home which are simpler challenges that earn small amounts of Nook Miles. These refresh on a daily basis and change based on what the player has unlocked or caught.

Nook Miles can be spent at a Nook Spot terminal after paying off the initial loan for the getaway package. They can be exchanged for upgrades for the player, new hair options, Nook Miles tickets or Nook themed items. The selection expands as the player improves the island including an option to exchange Miles for Bells.

Dodo Airlines and Multiplayer[]

At the base of the island, the player can using their island's airport to travel to other islands or to send letters. They can also have the gates be opened for multiplayer. This can be chosen for local or online and can be restricted to a code or just people on the player's friends list. For players visiting another player's island, they need to choose the flying option and select the friend's island. Up to eight players can be on one player's island.

The Nook Miles ticket can also be redeemed at the airport. Using one will let the player travel to a random island with a bounty of resources and sometimes a villager. If tools break, the player can spend Nook Miles to replace them or craft them themselves. However, any items left on the island will be lost forever. These islands tend to have rarer resources including occasionally nonnative fruit.

There is an option for local multiplayer on the console for up to 4 residents of the island. These players have simplified control with no real inventory. Instead, their tools are used from their actual inventory and anything picked up gets sent to the recycling bin. They also cannot use the crafting bench, enter or exit buildings, or talk to villagers. The main player controls the screen movement with any players offscreen warping to the player. The leader can be changed when they shake the controller and another press a button. This changes the game to their profile with full access to their inventory and abilities. This mode of multiplayer cannot be used with online multiplayer.

Save Data[]

The island is shared across the Switch with all 8 accounts capable of making a villager on the island. However, due to this, the game is not supported by Nintendo Switch Online cloud saving feature and the save data cannot be transferred normally. Later in 2020, a save data transfer tool will be available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers that will also allow cloud saves.

Characters[]

The game contains both new and returning characters. New villagers included Raymond, Audie, Judy, Sherb, Cyd, Dom, Megan, and Reneigh.
