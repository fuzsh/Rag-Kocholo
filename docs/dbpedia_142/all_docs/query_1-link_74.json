        "text": "NookLink is the name of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons companion app, which is available inside the Nintendo Switch Online App. It's available on Apple iOS devices via the App Store, or on Android devices via the Google Play store.\n\nIt is a free app, and will never cost or ask you of any money to use (outside of the Nintendo Online subscription required to use online features with your Nintendo Switch).\n\nHow to Download and Set Up NookLink\n\nSetting up NookLink will require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.\n\nIf you've deleted your Animal Crossing: New Horizons save data and started over, you will have to redo this process in order to use NookLink's features again.\n\nTo set up NookLink, you'll first need to activate it in-game. Here's how to do it:\n\nLaunch the game from the Switch's Home Menu\n\nAt the title screen, press the Minus Button to go to the Settings Menu.\n\nSelect \"NookLink Settings\".\n\nYou'll be asked if you want to activate the NookLink Features. Select \"Yes, please\".\n\nWith that done, you now need to set things up on the app itself:\n\nSearch for the app on your device's store (either the App Store or the Google Play Store) and search for \"Nintendo Switch Online\".\n\nDownload the app. If you can't find the app after it's downloaded, check your device's app library.\n\nWhen prompted, enter the email and password of the Nintendo Account that you use with Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nFrom the Nintendo Switch Online App's main menu, tap the Animal Crossing: New Horizons icon, found under Game-Specific Services at the bottom of the screen.\n\nNookLink App List\n\nThere are a total of twelve different apps available in NookLink that cover a wide variety of features and functions. Here's a breakdown of what each one does, as well as links to jump down to that specific section:\n\nApp Name Description PassportView your Passport, Dream Address and Creator IDs, and your Residents. KeyboardsSend Chat messages via your phone that will then appear to you and all player in-game. Best FriendsPersonally message Best Friends while they're playing the game. ReactionsSend Reactions via your phone that your character then uses in-game. CatalogSearch and purchase the Nook Shopping Catalogue to order items to your in-game mailbox. Nook PointsCheck in daily for Nook Points that can then be spent on exclusive Nook-themed items and Photos. Happy Home NetworkIf you have the Happy Home Paradise DLC, you can access the HHN from this app. Island NewspaperView recent island events and Turnip Prices via this map, and view newspapers for previous days. Island Life 101View the last 50 loading screen hints that you saw in the game. Custom DesignsScan QR Codes from New Leaf and Happy Home Designer, which can then be downloaded into New Horizons. SettingsChange the NookLink language, and change to a different player on the island linked to the NookLink app.\n\nEvery NookLink App Explained\n\nPassport\n\nThe Passport App is a little bit more than what its name implies, as it covers Dreams and your island's villager residents as well. Here's everything the Passport NookLink App is able to do:\n\nView the Passport that you can customize via your in-game NookPhone Passport App.\n\nView your Dream Address, Custom Design Creator ID and, if you have the DLC, your Happy Home Network ID.\n\nYou're able to copy these codes to your device's clipboard, allowing convenient access to them for you to easily share with others.\n\nIf one of these codes is not being displayed, you'll need to talk with either Luna (Dream Code), Lottie (HHN ID) or use the Custom Designs portal within Able Sisters and ask to display them on your Passport.\n\nView a list of recent Dream Islands that you've visited, in case you want to look up their Dream Code to visit them again. You can also see how many times your Dream Island has been visited!\n\nA complete list of your Island's Residents, and view their birthdays.\n\nYou are not able to edit your Passport within the NookLink App. To do that, you need to view the Passport app via your in-game NookLink Phone, accessed with the ZL Button.\n\nKeyboards\n\nThe Keyboard App is a combination of two in-game features: the Chat app from your in-game NookPhone, and the in-game chat feature that you access by pressing R on your controller. This allows you to send the messages to all your Friends and Best Friends as they play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, just like with the R Button while playing the game itself!\n\nThe Keyboard App may be preferred over the in-game Chat, since you can type much faster than using the in-game keyboard. You may also want to consider using it if you don't have a USB keyboard plugged into your Switch's dock, or play your Switch primarily in Handheld Mode or Tabletop Mode. It is worth noting however that the app is still limited to 25 characters like the in-game chat is.\n\nOne extra-neat feature is that you can also quickly access the Emote NookLink App from within the Keyboard App!\n\nBest Friends\n\nThe Best Friends App is essentially a Best Friends-oriented version of the Keyboards App listed above. Here you can send messages to all of your online Best Friends, or to a specific one, just like you can with the Best Friends app on your in-game NookPhone.\n\nYou can also view their Profiles, from which you can Remove them from your Best Friends list, or Report them if they've done something bad.\n\nReactions\n\nThe Reactions App allows you to access all of your unlocked Reactions, as well as a list of your five most recently-used ones. You may find this faster than bringing up the full Reactions Menu in-game!\n\nThere are two ways to use a Reaction within this app:\n\nTap the Reaction's icon, then tap the Send button at the bottom of the screen.\n\nDouble-tap the Reaction icon.\n\nIt is worth noting that it can take 1-2 seconds for your character to actually perform the Reaction you chose.\n\nCatalog\n\nThe Catalog is a convenient and powerful NookLink App, and is equivalent to your in-game NookPhone's Nook Shopping app. Here's everything that you can do with it:\n\nSearch all your catalogued items by name.\n\nSearch all your catalogued items with search criteria. Criteria can include Object Category, Colour, if you can Order or Customize them, between two Bell cost amounts, and Size.\n\nYou can also leave the criteria empty to see an alphabetical list of every item in that game that you have catalogued.\n\nJump straight to your Favourite Items. Favouriting items can only be done via the NookLink Catalog on your device, giving you quick access to specific items you want.\n\nView New Items, the 20 most recent items you either ordered or received from someone (items found from trees or balloons don't count). Here you can Favourite them, view their Category, their Purchase Cost, their Sell Value, and if you can Customize them with Customization Kits or need to do so via Cyrus at Harv's Campsite.\n\nYou cannot buy these items from this menu: you'll have to manually search for them elsewhere.\n\nView the items displayed in the background of the Catalog App's menu. This will only display their icon and what they look like.\n\nSee when the Catalog was last updated. Visible at the bottom of the Catalog App's menu will be an indicator of when the Catalog was last updated, in case you can't find an item you only recently received.\n\nIf you can't find an item you recently received, go to Animal Crossing: New Horizon's main menu, press the Minus Button to go to Settings, then ask about NookLink and ask to have your save data synced. This should resolve the issue.\n\nNook Points\n\nThe Nook Points App is the first App with features exclusive to the NookLink app, and is arguably one of most important ones.\n\nIn this app, you can check in every day to earn Nook Points. Typically you only get 10, but sometimes you may get 20 or even 30 Nook Points! Nook Points can only be redeemed on the day that they're available, meaning if you wait five days, you cannot redeem five days worth of Nook Points all at once; they'll have been lost forever.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the reset time for Nook Points is midnight, rather than 5am like in the main New Horizons game.\n\nNook Points are spent at an exclusive item store filled with Nook-themed items and clothing. Initially this had six items in it, but as of Update 2.0, it now contains twelve!\n\nName Cost Description Nook Inc. Poster10 The Tom Nook poster seen on the left wall of Resident Services. Nook Inc. Toilet Paper10 Toilet Paper with a pattern of the Nook Inc leaf logo. Nook Inc. Balloon30 A plastic balloon that can either be placed or held in your hand. Nook Inc. Doorplate40 A doorplate of the Nook Inc. leaf logo. Nook Inc. Pochette50 A tiny backpack of the Nook Inc. leaf logo. Nook Inc. Sweater50 The yellow sweater that Tom Nook wears under his jacket during Autumn and Winter. ACNH Carrying Case60 In-game replica of the official ACNH-themed Switch Carrying Case that released with the game. Nook Inc. Cushion60 Cushion of the Nook Inc. leaf logo. Can be placed on surfaces, or on the ground to be sat on. Raccoon Wall Clock80 Wall clock in the style of the Nook Miles raccoon, with a swinging pendulum tail. Timmy and Tommy's Photo100 Photo of Timmy and Tommy, with their date of birth and their favourite sayings on the back. Tom Nook's Photo100 Photo of Tom Nook, with his date of birth and his favourite saying on the back. Isabelle's Photo100 Photo of Isabelle, with her date of birth and her favourite saying on the back.\n\nUnlike items obtained via the Nook Shopping or Catalogue apps, items purchased from Nook Points will arrive at your in-game Mailbox instantly, just like sending to Friends!\n\nIf your Mailbox isn't showing it has new mail, check it anyway: this will sync it up and the new items will be there for you.\n\nNotably, the Turnip prices are tracked and looged without you having to check them in-game. This makes the process of checking your Turnip prices much easier to do, so long as you remember to check them of course.\n\nIsland Life 101\n\nA new app that was also added in Update 2.0, Island Life 101 is an archive of your 50 most recent tips that you saw in the loading screen when going to Isabelle's daily announcement. There's an equivalent app available for your in-game NookPhone, however you need to purchase it from the NookStop terminal inside Resident Services first.\n\nCustom Designs\n\nThe Custom Designs app has one purpose: scanning in the images of QR Codes that were created for Animal Crossing Custom Designs.\n\nWith this App, it's possible to copy Custom Designs created in Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer on Nintendo 3DS to your in-game Custom Designs NookPhone App in Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH Customs Designs can also be scanned, of course).\n\nYou can scan a QR Code using your Camera, or you can opt to scan it from an image already saved to your device (you may need to give the app permission to access your images first).\n\nOnce you've scanned a QR Code, open the Custom Designs app from your in-game NookPhone and then press the Minus Button to go to the download menu. From there you can then download the design and add it to your collection of Custom Designs!"
