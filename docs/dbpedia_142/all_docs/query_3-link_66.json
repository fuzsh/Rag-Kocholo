        "text": "Summary\n\nFishing in Animal Crossing is much calmer of an experience than many expect it to be.\n\nCompleting the museum with all 80 fish in the game will be a long-term project, taking at least a year.\n\nCozy games like Animal Crossing offer a meditative quality, aiding in reducing stress and providing mental health benefits.\n\nLongtime Animal Crossing: New Horizons players are just now figuring out how relaxing the in-game fishing mechanic really is, with some players noting exactly how long it took them to figure out. There is so much to do in Animal Crossing: New Horizons and though players might lean towards other options first, fishing is an important part of the game. With the seasons bringing new varieties of fish to Animal Crossing, players will oftentimes find themselves standing near an ocean, lake, or a pond with a fishing rod in their hands waiting for a bite.\n\nReddit user junimo- shared that after 45 hours of playing Animal Crossing, a random decision opened their eyes to how fishing should really work. Most players decide to tap A furiously in order to reel in their catch, but junimo- said that all they really need to do is just press A once and the game takes over the rest. Another player, Own_Butterscotch_445, said they had never realized this was an option, writing:\n\n\"Wait what?... ive played this game for over 500 hours... ive restarted my island... multiple times... this is a thing?\"\n\nThis revelation came as a shock to many, with numerous comments agreeing they didn't know this. The thread then quickly turned into players sharing their various other rituals to help them catch fish, including closing their eyes to listen for the audio cue to prevent them accidentally hitting the button too early - or too late.\n\nFishing In Animal Crossing Is Actually Relaxing\n\nCozy Games Should Be A No-Stress Zone\n\nIt does make sense that the fishing mechanics in the game are so simple. While Animal Crossing might not be as big as it used to be, it is still one of the most popular cozy games and cozy games aren't supposed to be stressful. Having players tap a button in that manner might detract from the ability to just relax and take in the game. Though sometimes this challenge was a welcome one, since junimo- mentioned they will miss the adrenaline rush they got from the way they used to fish.\n\nThough the act of fishing itself might be less stressful for players thanks to junimo-'s discovery, those who want to complete their museum will find other things to worry about. Rare fish can be really difficult to find, like the ever-elusive oarfish in Animal Crossing. There are very specific requirements that need to be met in order to catch the rarer fish, like weather, time of day, and season. Hopefully, this will help players focus more on the type of fish they catch, instead of focusing on the fishing part itself.\n\nCozy Games Often Have A Meditative Quality\n\nFishing In Animal Crossing Can Be Good For Mental Health\n\nOne of the most endearing qualities of many cozy games is that they can often provide a truly calming, therapeutic sensation while completing simple tasks such as fishing or doing other repetitive chores. Fishing in Animal Crossing can often provide a chance to slow down and enjoy the calming virtual water while just taking a moment out of one's busy reality, and offers some unique benefits that are not found in the more action-oriented video games that lead the market. Therefore, it makes sense that the task is not an adrenaline rush, as that would take away from the tranquility.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why many cozy games have been heralded for their mental health benefits, particularly for players who may suffer from anxiety, as the quietness and peaceful moments that come from the slower pace of cozy, casual games can reduce stress. These escapes onto a virtual island to fish and pick flowers provide a space to unwind, while the simple act of fishing can offer a chance to think through problems or stresses in a safe, though virtual, space.\n\nFishing In Animal Crossing Is A Long-Term Project\n\nThe Museum Requirements Will Take At Least A Year\n\nEven with the gained knowledge that fishing in ACNH is less stressful than previously believed, that doesn't make it any less challenging. Completing the museum will require catching and donating one of each of the 80 fish in the game to Blathers. With fish such as the Coelacanth, which can only be caught while it's raining and has a very low spawn rate, and the Great White Shark, which can only be found in the ocean from 9pm to 4am between July and September, getting each fish in the game is a true feat.\n\nMany of the fish are only available during certain seasons, and the game follows the real life calendar and clock for the players' location. This means that unless a player wants to fudge the system by changing their date and time in the Nintendo Switch's system settings, the museum will require a player to continue playing Animal Crossing for at least a full year to get 100% completion. However, the undeniable beauty and serenity found in walking around the completed aquarium section of the museum is meditative in its own right.\n\nOne of the best parts of Animal Crossing is how new ideas and ways to play the game keep popping up, regardless of the fact it has been out for four years. Many find the game to be worth continuing to go back to, whether for the peaceful nature of fishing and crafting, or to check in on their island villagers. From hilarious recreations, like this Willy Wonka Experience meets Animal Crossing scene, to new realizations like junimo- made, the Animal Crossing: New Horizons fandom will continue to thrive and enjoy sharing their love of the game all these years later."
