        "text": "It might have taken a while, but the powers that be eventually bestowed upon us a glorious update that introduced swimming and diving to Animal Crossing: New Horizons — and with these activities, a whole host of collectibles.\n\nThe update brought a brand-new set of creatures found under the sea. In addition, Pascal and his philosophical pearls of wisdom returned — and yes, Pascal will still trade you rare items for any scallops you uncover (this time, it's the Mermaid furniture series).\n\nIn order to partake in any of these activities, one must first acquire and wear a wetsuit, which can be purchased in the cupboard at Timmy and Tommy's for 3000 Bells and comes in many different styles and colors. Just what we needed — more clothing options!\n\nOnce you're suited up and ready for a swim, you can dive into our complete list of sea creatures, catching conditions and shop sell prices below.\n\nRemember: Certain fish and bugs will be leaving Animal Crossing: New Horizons (temporarily) at the end of the month, you'll want to catch those before they leave.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons - Sea Creature Complete List\n\nIn total there are 40 sea creatures to catch in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and they have their own page in your Critterpedia. Remember, you can donate these to Blathers at the Museum.\n\nHere are all the Sea Creatures listed alphabetically - our thanks to the Animal Crossing Wiki on Fandom for some of the icons below.
