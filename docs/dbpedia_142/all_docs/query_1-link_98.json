You can share physical games across different Switch consoles, the data is connected to the Nintendo account.\n\nPlaying together is only possible with 2 game copies though.\n\nMiss Mandy\n\nModerator\n\nJoined\n\nMay 29, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n15,199\n\nReaction score\n\n10,271\n\nPoints\n\n4,047\n\nLocation\n\nEssex\n\nNov 19, 2020\n\n#6\n\nYou can game share digital copies across two accounts, but with physical copies or if they want to play at the same time you'll need two copies.\n\nLast edited: Nov 19, 2020\n\nS2000 VTEC\n\nProminent Member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 18, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n2,048\n\nReaction score\n\n337\n\nPoints\n\n628\n\nLocation\n\nLondon\n\nNov 19, 2020\n\n#7\n\nI haven't done it myself but I think you can share them. However they can't play at the same time, it checks if the game is being used and boots the other person off. I have 2 AC:NH digital codes if you wanted them in the Classifieds.

(ie it’s just ‘local play’ same way as on Mario Kart you can use a single cartridge to have a 2 player race together, but you couldn’t both play 1 player using a single cart).\n\n2 copies of Animal Crossing would allow you to each have your own independent island.\n\nlittlesheepy\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 18, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n6,353\n\nReaction score\n\n715\n\nPoints\n\n1,446\n\nLocation\n\nStaffs\n\nNov 26, 2020\n\n#12\n\nSorry to jump in here. Anyone in the situation where 1 person has 2 switches, say a standard and a lite. Can you play on one and pick up where you left off on the other or are your game saves on one of the switches?\n\nMiss Mandy\n\nModerator\n\nJoined\n\nMay 29, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n15,199\n\nReaction score\n\n10,271\n\nPoints\n\n4,047\n\nLocation\n\nEssex\n\nNov 26, 2020\n\n#13\n\nI'm not 100% sure, but I think it can be done although there are caveats. If I recall correctly you need the online membership and the game needs to support cloud saves. Not all games do though.\n\nlittlesheepy\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 18, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n6,353\n\nReaction score\n\n715\n\nPoints\n\n1,446\n\nLocation\n\nStaffs"
