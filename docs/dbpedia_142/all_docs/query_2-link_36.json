        "text": "Controls\n\nMoving Around\n\nYou can walk somewhere by simply tapping your destination on the screenâ€”you can also drag your finger across the screen, and your character will follow along. If you want to go to a different area, open the map, choose a destination, and select Let's go!\n\nMaking Furniture\n\nTap the Craft icon to make furniture. When it's finished, it will be marked \"Complete!\" You'll need to acquire certain craft materials to craft a piece of furniture. If you don't have enough craft materials, you can use Leaf Tickets to acquire them and then place an order. And if you can't wait any longer to see the finished product, you can also use Leaf Tickets to immediately complete the crafting process.\n\nFishing Tips\n\nIf you see the shadow of a fish in the river or the ocean, tap on it to cast your line. Once the fish bites, an exclamation point (!) will appear over it. Tap quickly to reel that fish in! If you're having a hard time catching a certain type of fish, a throw net can come in handy. But remember - there are different types of fish living in the ocean and the river.\n\nBug-Catching Tips\n\nIf you're holding your net at a recreation spot, that means you can catch bugs. To start, tap on a bug. When you're close enough to catch it, an exclamation point (!) will appear. Quickly tap again to trap the bug in your net. If you're having a hard time catching a certain type of bug, you can use honey to catch many types of bug at once.\n\nDecorating Your Space\n\nYou can use the Arrange button on the right to place furniture at your campsite or inside your camper van. Tap on a piece of furniture to rotate it, or drag it across the screen to move it to a different spot. If you no longer wish to display an item, tap the Put Away button and then tap on the furniture you wish to store.\n\nShovelstrike Quarry\n\nLend Lloid a hand digging for ore in exchange for bells or crafting materials.\n\nWhat you'll dig up will change throughout the day, so remember to return frequently.\n\nEnter Shovelstrike Quarry by getting help from Friends or by using Leaf Tickets.\n\nReceiving Items\n\nItems you receive as gifts are sent to your mailbox. When something's in your mailbox, the mailbox icon will start flashing. Remember to check it frequently!\n\nMaking Friends\n\nOther players will appear at recreation spots from time to time. Don't hesitate to reach out and ask to be their friend!\n\nBecome friends with real-life friends by sharing your ID via email, text, etc.\n\nInteracting with Friends\n\nVisit a friend's campsite and give them kudos to earn friend powder, a valuable type of craft material. You can also buy items from a friend's Market Box or help each other enter Shovelstrike Quarry. Eventually there will be more events where you can cooperate with friends, too!\n\nRevisit the Tutorial\n\nAll About Items\n\nLeaf Tickets\n\nLeaf Tickets are items that can be purchased with real money.\n\nThey can be used to buy things like throw nets or honey, or to complete a crafting job immediately.\n\nLeaf Tickets can also be earned in-game by completing Goals, accepting Welcome Bonuses, etc.\n\nThrow Nets\n\nA throw net is a convenient tool for catching lots of fish.\n\nYou can acquire them with Leaf Tickets at any pier on a river or beach.\n\nThe kinds of fish you can catch varies depending on the type of throw net you use.\n\nHoney\n\nUsing honey is an easy way to catch lots of bugs at once.\n\nYou can acquire it with Leaf Tickets at the hollow stump marked with a honey icon.\n\nThe types of bugs you can catch will vary depending on the type of honey you use.\n\nFertilizer\n\nFertilizer is a helpful tool to have when you want to regrow fruit on trees immediately. If you tap a fruit tree that's currently fruitless, you can use Leaf Tickets to buy fertilizer.\n\nCalling Cards\n\nA Calling Card is for when you want to summon an animal from your Contacts to a recreation spot they aren't currently visiting.\n\nTo use one, select an animal from your Contacts and then tap \"Call\". If you don't have any Calling Cards, you can pay Leaf Tickets to call an animal directly.\n\nBut keep in mind that you can't call an animal when they're visiting your campsite or another recreation area.\n\nRequest Tickets\n\nWhen you want to fulfil more requests after you've done all you can for an animal, use a Request Ticket to unlock additional requests.\n\nIf you don't have any Request Tickets, you can pay Leaf Tickets to unlock more requests.\n\nCraft Materials\n\nCraft materials are used to craft furniture and amenities.\n\nYou can earn them by fulfilling requests for animals or by raising your Friendship Level.\n\nAmenities\n\nAmenities are special items that you build in your campsite. As you level up, you'll be able to build all sorts of things!\n\nOnce you've finished a new amenity, you'll hold an Unveiling Party at your camp.\n\nYour friendship level with all animals in attendance will go up all at once."
