I’ve gone on about ten so far, but the only different things I’ve gotten are rain and coconuts.\n\nI can't help it, garbage flows from within\n\nZ999z3mystory 4 years ago#2\n\nIt's possible, but I think the odds are very heavily weighted in favor of having the same stuff as your home island.\n\nNot changing this signature until I do, unless I change my mind.\n\nSteitz (Topic Creator)4 years ago#3\n\nZ999z3mystory posted...\n\nIt's possible, but I think the odds are very heavily weighted in favor of having the same stuff as your home island.\n\nThats what I thought since a lot of people talk about finding bamboo and other fruits on different islands they have in game so I was wondering if I was just unlucky.\n\nI can't help it, garbage flows from within\n\nNicoGrimm 4 years ago#4\n\nOut of 10 or so islands Ive been to, 1 had bamboo, 1 had peaches, and all the rest had pears (my native fruit).\n\nHow dare the Gods work against me! I don't remember giving them permission.\n\nHirokey123 4 years ago#5\n\nIt’s totally random. I have traveled at least 7 times and 3 of those times it was cherries which is not my native fruit, 2 of those times the layout was different, 3 of those times the flowers were different, and all 7 times there were coconuts.\n\nI've got a quote that embodies you perfectly, but it's seventy-three posts long, has a few massive flowcharts, and lots of Xion-KMA to Me\n\nTheBest69 4 years ago#6\n\nSo why do we even pay 2k miles if it has the exact same s*** our island has? I only use tickets so I can smash a rock or two and maybe catch things (that are also available on my island...). I don't really see the point of it.\n\nHirokey123 4 years ago#7\n\nTheBest69 posted...\n\nSo why do we even pay 2k miles if it has the exact same s*** our island has?

Especially good for harvesting ores since you have a very limited stock you can collect due to our town only having like 4 rocks and weeds take a long time to regrow in bulk without TTing.\n\nThere are special islands with different properties you can get like the island that spawns excessive amounts of tarantulas or endless emperor butterflies for big bells. Or an island that just gives you trash when you fish which is good for getting the cans, boots, and tires you need to get and make special DIY items.\n\nThe weather can be very different like it might be storming on an island when it’s sunny in your town. Letting you catch things that wouldn’t normally be possible to get that day in your town like fish that only appear in the rain.\n\nIt’s a rather luck based mechanic but it can have very large payout and the whole infinite source of woods and ore is true always.\n\nI've got a quote that embodies you perfectly, but it's seventy-three posts long, has a few massive flowcharts, and lots of Xion-KMA to Me\n\nTheBest69 4 years ago#8\n\nHirokey123 posted...\n\nWell because again the contents are entirely random and it’s a place where you can...\n\n* Recruit Villagers quickly\n\n* Potentially get different fruit and trees than what is native to your town.\n\n* Harvest for resources till it’s a barren wasteland with no consequence.

Didn't think of all that. I already have all fruits though thanks to friends haha. But all the other stuff sounds interesting. So it's kind of a gamble eh? Heh Never had special occasion islands though. Hope that changes soon."
