        "text": "This ACNH multiplayer guide explains how to play 2-4 player local couch co-op (aka Party Play), how to play local wireless and online, how to play with friends, how to add people to your best-friends list, and how to message and talk to friends. Plus a detailed break down on how the Call Islander and Best-Friends List NookPhone apps work alongside the real-life Nintendo Switch Online App (aka NookLink).\n\nUp to 8 players can live on one island; 4 players living on the same island can play together - at the same time - on a single system (couch co-op style). Here's how to do it.\n\nIf you're over the idea of sharing an island, freedom is possible! But remember the person who named the Island i.e the Resident Rep cannot leave. But others totally can!\n\nThe person leaving the island needs to launch the game. When the home screen appears press the (-) to access Settings. Then select save data settings. From here the person can remove themselves from the island. This will cause them, their money and items, their property, and even villagersâ€™ memories of them to disappear completely.\n\nYou cannot add Best Friends until you've played with them at least once so we'll start with how to play online. There's no way to send a direct invite to your Nintendo Switch friends. Instead you're \"opening the gates\" to your island. They don't get a notification about this but you do have some in-game messaging options (we'll discuss that in a bit).\n\nWhen you go to Dodo Airlines and ask to visit someone \"far-away, Online\" or ask for visitors \"far-away, Online.\" Orville will add the Best-Friends List App and the Chat Log app to your phone.\n\nHere's how to play with friends and how the best-friends list can change things. Everything you get on another island will go into your pockets, allowing you to take it back to your island later!\n\nHere are the ACNH messaging features. Orville will give you both the Best Friends App and the Chat Log app when you ask to play Online.\n\nWhether you have island visitors or are visiting an island yourself, you can use the Chat Log app to send messages to everyone as long as you're on the island together. It's basically a giant group text but your message also appears as a speech bubble above your head.\n\nWhen you're by yourself you can still send messages but ONLY to your Best Friends using the Best Friends App. You can ONLY send these messages when the recipient is online. Be sure to enable the communication feature by opening the Best Friends List app and hitting the (-).\n\nFinally, the other form of communication in ACNH is good ol' fashion mail! Just head to Dodo Airlines and interact with the card stand on the right of Orville. From here you can send a letter to another resident (human or animal!), your future self, or any friend! They'll get the letter shortly after."
