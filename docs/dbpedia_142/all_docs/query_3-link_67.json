        "text": "What you need to know\n\nHokko Life is an Animal Crossing-like game where players will be able to customize their town\n\nThe game has a deep customization tool for player characters and items, and designs can be shared online with friends or other players around the world.\n\nIt will be launching for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on Sept. 27.\n\nHokko Life will be coming to Xbox One alongside other platforms next month, developer Wonderscope and publisher Team17 announced today.\n\nThe game is a community life sim in the same vein as Animal Crossing, right down to players beginning the game on a train taking them to start a new life in a new town. Players take over an old workshop and must expand upon the town through collecting resources, placing and decorating new houses, and building furniture. There is even animal-like townsfolk that will visit your town and possibly stay alongside minigames like fishing, bug catching, and planting crops.\n\nThe biggest difference that sets Hokko Life from Animal Crossing is in its customization. The 3D design tool allows players to customize everything within the town of Hokko from clothing to household items.\n\nFor example, a single pillow can have its color, fabric, and the angle which it is placed customized. Players will also be able to share their custom designs with friends and other players around the world in the game."
