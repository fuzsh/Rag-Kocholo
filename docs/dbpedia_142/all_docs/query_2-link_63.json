You'll need to pick from one of four options, with no clear indication of what each one does. We'll explain everything in this guide.\n\nOn this page:\n\n'If You Could Only Bring ONE Thing With You' Question Explained\n\n'If You Could Only Bring ONE Thing With You' Question Explained\n\nAfter being asked the 'If you could only bring ONE thing with you to a deserted island, what would it be?' question, you'll be asked to choose between the following four options:\n\nA sleeping bag\n\nA lamp\n\nSome food\n\nSomething to kill time\n\nDon't worry about which one you pick, as Tom Nook later explains that the question is completely rhetorical. It's a joke of sorts, as you'll be receiving all four things courtesy of Nook Inc. once you arrive at the island. For more on the intro section of the game, head to this guide.\n\nWe've been busy plugging away on a bunch more Animal Crossing New Horizons guides. You can find close to 100 guides right here on USG, and if you head to our AC: New Horizons Walkthrough you'll see them all in one handy place. From guides on the different kinds of buildings, to detailed breakdowns of how to catch specific bugs and fish, we've got you covered.\n\nWe have plenty more Animal Crossing New Horizons content here on USG. First off, you'll want to read Caty's review. Then, why not check out Hirun's write-up of the community's fondness for Roald?"
