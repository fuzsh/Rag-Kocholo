        "text": "In the whimsical world of Animal Crossing, you have a few options when it comes to what game you want to play. Whether you’re a seasoned islander or a newcomer to the series, here’s a guide to help you navigate the best Animal Crossing games across different platforms and spin-offs.\n\nThe best way to play Animal Crossing on a console\n\nI think the simplest answer is also the correct one when it comes to the best console Animal Crossing release. Simply pick up a copy of Animal Crossing New Horizons. On TV, the game looks great and is even more immersive. Kicking back on the couch and escaping to your island is like a vacation after a hard day.\n\nNew Horizons offers loads of features and the most customization options in any Animal Crossing game yet. With tons to keep you busy and a bustling player community, you’ll easily sink hundreds of hours into this one from the comfort of your own home.\n\nThe best way to play Animal Crossing on a handheld\n\nIf you’ve still got a 3DS, I think Animal Crossing New Leaf is still worth tracking down. The vibe in New Leaf is just so much more relaxed, yet the game is still full of all the delightful activities and quirky characters that make Animal Crossing a beloved franchise.\n\nKeep in mind, the online services just closed for this game. However, there’s still tons of content for solo players. If you had your heart set on playing with friends or if your 3DS is long gone, I do think that New Horizons is a wonderful handheld option too.\n\nBest Animal Crossing spin-off\n\nWhen you’re ready to try something new in the Animal Crossing world, check out Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. It’s a spin-off title built around creating dream homes for your favorite animal villagers. With its focus on creativity and decorating prowess, Happy Home Designer might just be highlighting the very thing you play Animal Crossing for anyway.\n\nIf you’re the type to spend hours getting your rooms looking perfect you have to try this game out. You might also like the DLC to New Horizons which sort of acts as an almost sequel to this game.\n\nBest retro Animal Crossing\n\nFor those yearning for a more nostalgic experience, I must tip my cap to the classic GameCube version of Animal Crossing. With its quaint charm and the unmistakable retro vibes the atmosphere is just so serene. Animal Crossing on GameCube remains a beloved favorite among longtime fans too. Heck, it even still has a speedrunning community.\n\nYou’ll have to drop a little coin in your search for a copy. While a lot of other Gamecube games have a far worse aftermarket price, Animal Crossing isn’t dirt cheap either. Keep in mind that this Animal Crossing also needed a dedicated memory card, so factor that into your budget. You’ll also need the Gamecube to play the game if you don’t have one. Alternatively, remember that the Wii played Gamecube games.\n\nWhether you’re crafting your dream island getaway on console, tending to your village on the go, there’s really no wrong way to play. If you’re looking for the very unique experience Animal Crossing offers, you’re going to find it in just about any title you pick up. So grab your fishing rod, and don’t forget to water your flowers."
