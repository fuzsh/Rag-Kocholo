        "text": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons lets you have your very own Nintendo Switch as an in-game item, and when you take a closer look at it you'll notice just how detailed it is.\n\nIf you're really committed to the Nintendo Lifestyle, you can actually buy a Switch in New Horizons – a Nintendo-exclusive game. You know, just to make things nice and meta. These guys certainly seem to derive a good deal of pleasure out of placing all kinds of Easter Eggs related to themselves in their games. But we're not complaining – have you seen how cute the thing is?\n\nRELATED: Animal Crossing: New Horizons - How To Get The Viral Strawberry Dress From TikTok\n\nBut while we're sure everyone can appreciate its general charm factor, perhaps some have yet to notice that if you zoom in real close, you can actually see the Nintendo logo itself engraved onto the back of the console (see the screenshot below). Evidently, Nintendo isn't playing games (yup) when it comes to the level of detail they've included in their lovable life simulator.\n\nAnother fun fact about the in-game Switch is that its price in bells matches the price of the real-life Switch in Japanese Yen - ¥29,980 to be exact. A nice little reminder of the approximate $285 you had to fork out in order to play the game in the first place, amirite?\n\nRELATED: Animal Crossing New Horizons: 10 Tips On What To Do If Your Turnip Prices Suck This Week\n\nWe always love writing about New Horizons for many different reasons, not least because of the sheer attention to detail the game boasts. Take for example, the fact that in-game fireworks light up the inside of your house, wind from fans make the leaves of indoor plants rustle differently depending on their orientation, and your yukata sleeves get rolled up when you hold tools. Just to name a few.\n\nSo remember to keep your eyes peeled for all these charming little details that will undoubtedly make you fall even further in love with the game!\n\nSource: Twitter"
