So is there a list that tells us which items influence the villagers?\n\nAnd I oop- :^)\n\nLil_Puddin (Topic Creator)4 years ago#2\n\nflump\n\nAnd I oop- :^)\n\ndanmiy12 4 years ago#3\n\n-any music item they have a chance of playing it\n\n-any stereo can cause them to start singing (ones with the music hobby will sing way more often)\n\n-if the item has 2 states like lights they will play with it occasionally\n\n-if the item is a picture like the the plain wooden shop sign they might stare at it\n\n-beds give them a chance to lie down in it, chairs they might sit\n\n-any flower item they might spray water on it, read books on it, or smell it. They will finish the animation even if you dig up the flower\n\n-any item that animates when you interact with it will cause them to play with it for a bit like the ball item or tiger toy.\n\n-if you have a snack machine they might use it then animate getting a bag or sandwich outta it, sometimes i see a lolipop then they use it.\n\n-if theres water or a tree nearby they might sit down, this can interupt you if you are cutting trees or terraforming water\n\n-they look at taralulas and scorpians and not move\n\n-they panic if theres wasps nearby\n\n-some bugs cause them to chase it\n\ntheres prob more then this though.\n\nsuper mario maker 2 maker id:GFH-MCB-51H AC NH Dream address:DA-8686-0818-6844\n\nMonster hunter HH Main 30k+ uses over 6 games/ switch fc SW-7322-5459-7505\n\nAjidoMarujido 4 years ago#4\n\nIn addition to what was mentioned above:\n\n- Placed bugs/fish can cause them to bring out a book to study them\n\n- Food related objects (clay furnace, fortune cookie cart, etc...) may cause them to stop and smell the food\n\n- Like a stereo, a microphone stand can cause the villagers to stand behind it and sing\n\n- Water coolers and drink machines can cause them to come up and \"get a drink\" from it, though unlike the snack machine, they don't walk away with it in their hand.\n\n[[ PSN - MilesEdgeworth ]] ~ [[ Switch - 5798.9459.4957 ]]\n\n[[ Currently ]] ~ Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5), Persona 3 Reload (PS5)\n\nDork_Vader 4 years ago#5\n\nThey pose in front of mirrors.\n\nThey spin/stop the colorful wheels.\n\nIn the museum with certain exhibits but especially art they comment on it and note when you were the one who donated it.\n\nThis is not a signature.\n\nMayorDarcy 4 years ago#6\n\nAdditional items villagers interact with:\n\n*Espresso maker\n\n*Water pump\n\n*Brick oven\n\n*Hammock\n\n*Garden faucet\n\n*Coconut juice (which they sniff like they would the flowers, it's hilarious)\n\n*Cushion (which my villagers seem to prefer though they also use the benches,stools, etc. but I used the fertilizer design on the cushion for my garden and someone would always be sitting on it lol)\n\nACNH: Momo of Haven\n\nDA: 0109-6875-5636 RA:7459-6825-1081\n\nDork_Vader 4 years ago#7\n\nI had Gayle living near Zucker and I put the fish drying rack by Zucker's house with the octopus customization on it.\n\nGayle, being the mega-creep that she is, would regularly walk over and take a big deep sniff before sitting behind his house gazing vaguely towards the window.\n\nThis is not a signature.\n\nLil_Puddin (Topic Creator)4 years ago#8\n\nDork_Vader posted...\n\nI had Gayle living near Zucker and I put the fish drying rack by Zucker's house with the octopus customization on it.\n\nGayle, being the mega-creep that she is, would regularly walk over and take a big deep sniff before sitting behind his house gazing vaguely towards the window.\n\nGayle fetishises Octopi. w•o•w\n\nAnyway OT, I guess they only grab snacks from the vending machine?
