        "text": "We all know how great this game is. You get to talk to animals, participate in events, buy clothes for your character, and invite animals to your campsite + cabin!\n\nIâve been playing for a while and even most of my friends have played it. However, coming from a player, I would really like to see at least an icon of what a player wants to buy from the market place. I think that would be really cool. Right now, my wool stock is really low. I already am doing requests but it isnât helping. It would be cool for my player to show that I need wool so others can sell.\n\nIt would be even cooler if players can gift other players items! My friends and I would love this! I donât think weâd be the only ones honestly. Of course, these items would include clothes or any duplicate furniture that we want to get rid of. In order so this doesnât dominate the purpose of the market place; fruits, bugs, and other resources will be limited to the market place.\n\nMy third suggestion comes from the AC games. I think players would be extremely excited to design their own clothes. However, if everyone could do this freely, the clothes from events and the marketplace would have almost no value. Therefore, we must charge a certain amount of leaves.\n\nI hope someone reads this even after the New Horizons release. I know people who do not have access to a Switch will continue playing this game! Thank you for reading.\n\nIâve been an Animal Crossing veteran and I honestly think that this is one of the best mobile games. First off, you can make your campsite an actual theme of your choice or mix it up. Plus, the villagers have a preference toward a certain theme. Also, Iâve heard people say that the guests at your campsite keep on pestering them with quests, but I honestly donât mind them at all. Plus, you can get more furniture for your campsite or your camper and a couple of resources like the essence of that villagerâs preferred theme. Like for example Bam told me to make a Skateboard rack while I have a skateboarding rink and it made it look more lively once I placed it right next to it. Even though leaf tickets are hard to find and they can save you from waiting around 12 hours for a new amenity, you can still get them by doing quests and increasing your level. Plus crafting a new amenity doesnât get rid of your crafting space(s) so you can still craft furniture in the process and will allow you to chat and do quests for your guest and visitors so that you can increase your level, which gives you 10 leaf tickets, 1,000 bells, new furniture, and new villagers. And finally, the personality traits that they were given in the mainline games are still there. I love how charming they are when they tell you random things and honestly some can be quite humorous. So yeah, this is by far one of the best mobile games of all.\n\niâve never written a review before for any game but i figure my favorite app is the best place to start! iâve been playing animal crossing for over a year now and let me say it is a pleasure to play this game! thereâs daily rewards to keep you motivated to check in on your animal buddies, cute dialogue between characters, and engaging/new events that occur monthly (fishing tourneys are my favorite because of the weird collectible fish you can get). the music, aesthetics, and design are really pleasant and iâve only had one glitch occur before in the whole time iâve played it. the designers of this game keep up with what needs to be fixed and make sure that the game runs smoothly. i love being able to connect with other players without a chat room or anything like that because that can lead to harassment and just ugly stuff. my ONLY edits would be that i wish this app would lean into the âcuteâ aesthetic a bit more. recently they did a ârock and rollâ theme event and it was so dark and didnât fit my vision of animal crossing at all. i would love some more light, cute things that i can obtain! secondly, in the original animal crossing thereâs a museum where you can keep rare animals youâve collected. i think this would be a great idea so that way you donât just look in your catalogue to see rare things youâve caught. i want a place to keep them and put them on display so i can know my accomplishments! thatâs all though i love this game keep up the amazing work!"
