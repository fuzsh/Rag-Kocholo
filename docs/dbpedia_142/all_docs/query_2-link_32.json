        "text": "Summary\n\nFish and bugs can be displayed uniquely, such as in cages or aquariums with different designs.\n\nVillager personalities play a role with campsite guests often balancing existing personality types on the island.\n\nKatrina's fortunes can impact gameplay positively or negatively, affecting daily activities and relationships.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is a game many players have already put countless hours into since its original release in 2020. Despite that, the numerous intricacies and subtle nuances that have been programmed into the game mean there could still be more to discover. Whether someone has played daily for years, taken a break, and recently returned, or is picking up the game for the first time, this cozy life simulator has many hidden secrets and easter eggs that can bring extra delight.\n\nAs far as cozy games for the Nintendo Switch go, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the clear winner for its ability to encourage players to slow down and explore a peaceful island lifestyle. The game is designed for regular, even daily, moments of popping onto the island to water flowers, chat with villagers, and catch a few bugs, and yet it has a large number of small details that can remain unnoticed by most players. Here are some of the fun things that may still be exciting and fresh to learn about in ACNH.\n\n10 Many Fish And Bugs Have Unique Displays\n\nCages Can Look Different Depending On Creature\n\nOften, catching bugs and fish in ACNH can be a means to completing the museum collection and earning Bells. There are, of course, regular tournaments related to the activities, but these only come at certain times. The in-game artist, Flick, can take bugs and fish from the player to create lifelike, although not quite true-to-size models of the creatues that can be used to decorate, but that is not the only way a player can use them for looks and roleplaying.\n\nPlacing bugs and fish in Animal Crossing will put them in cages or aquariums, but there are many different varieties of styles that these will take on, depending on the creature being placed. Some of these cages can also have internal lights turned on, created a cool look when the lights are off or at night. Best of all, snapping turtles, horseshoe crabs, and spider crabs can all be placed without any form of container and will interact with the player when clicked on, becoming fun pets.\n\n9 Campsite Guest Personality Types Aren't Random\n\nThe Villagers Already There Play A Part\n\nThere are eight character personalities that the villagers can have in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, including snooty, jock, lazy, smug, peppy, cranky, normal, and sisterly. These personalities will determine how the characters will talk and act, and so some players like to have a variety on the island, while others prefer to have their villagers stick to the same one or two types.\n\nWhen villagers stay at the campsite with the possibility of moving to the island, surprisingly, the choice of who might appear is not entirely random. ACNH will provide more campers of personality types that are not already represented on the island in an attempt to balance things out. Therefore, if one type is not already on an island, the majority of campers will be that missing style.\n\n8 Multiple Family Connections In Animal Crossing\n\nSome Confirmed, Others Are Still Speculation\n\nSome of the familial relationships in ACNH are very obvious and straightforward, such as the trio of Able Sisters, Mable, Sable, and Labelle. Other relations can be a bit more blurred, such as how Timmy and Tommy are surprisingly not related to Tom Nook by blood, as was explained by Mr. Nook in Wild World, although he refers to them as his nephews in New Horizons.\n\nOf the villagers in the game, the bunnies Chrissy and Francine are the only truly confirmed relations, despite there being much speculation on several others.\n\nWhether or not these will be confirmed or denied in the next game will be interesting to see, but for now, players are free to imagine what they would like.\n\n7 Katrina's Fortunes Can Affect A Lot\n\nFor Good And Evil\n\nHaving a fortune told by Katrina in Animal Crossing can be fun, but might actually affect more than players realize. Her vague descriptions of what might happen can be a bit cryptic and are either positive or negative, with her stating that she can purify any negative fortunes for a whopping 10,000 Bells.\n\nThese silly fortunes are not just a strange discussion with an NPC, however, and will change the way the day will go for the player, for better or worse. Some can provide better items being found or having tools not break, they could cause no Bells to be earned from shaking trees or gold nuggets to come from rocks, or even improve or diminish friendship levels. If a bad fortune is given regarding health, the player may even find their character falling over unexpectedly a lot.\n\n6 Wasps Hate Parties\n\nParty Poppers Serve A Purpose\n\nBeing stung by a wasp after shaking trees in ACNH isn't really too terrible, as other than providing a little bit of an adrenaline rush for the player, the character is only left with a bit of a swollen eye which can be cleared up with some medicine. This unexpected surprise of wasps swarming can also present an opportunity to either catch them for the museum or find hilarious ways to avoid the situation.\n\nAvoiding wasps can be accomplished by running into a building or even dancing, but if one is prepared with a party popper in their hands, they can turn the tables and scare the wasps right back. Shooting off a party popper as soon as the bugs begin to swarm will make them disperse, giving a silly benefit to having the otherwise useless party item.\n\n5 Fishing Is Much Calmer Than Many Think\n\nIt's Meant To Be Peaceful\n\nFor years, many have misunderstood the calm and tranquil nature of the fishing mechanics in this cozy game. Fishing in ACNH is designed to be a calm, meditative way to slow down and enjoy a stress-free moment of peace, yet for many it is the exact opposite. To many players, fishing is an adrenaline-filled burst of energy as they frantically press the A button as soon as the fish bites. However, that is not necessary and, in fact, really isn't doing anything.\n\nAs soon as a fish bites the lure in the game, all that a player needs to do is simply press the A button once, and the game will do the rest. One simple touch of the button is much calmer and simpler than frantically pounding the button, as many have previously thought.\n\n4 Gyroids Can Be Wall Decorations\n\nShelves Will Automatically Appear\n\nGyroids are a silly and fun dynamic of the Animal Crossing games and come in a huge variety to collect, even being able to be customized to multiple colors. While it is a challenge to collect one of every gyroid in the game, it can be a fun and unique form of decorating one's house, as well as the rest of the island. The musical and dancing little objects can be fun to have around, and the bright colors and plethora of designs make for wonderful artwork.\n\nWhat many do not realize is that when placing gyroids in the player's home in ACNH, they are not limited to the floor or tables. Putting a gyroid up on a wall will automatically create a little shelf for the gyroid to sit on, giving even more possibilities for decorating designs.\n\n3 Brewster Has A Special Gyroid: The Brewstoid\n\nAnd It Coos Like A Pigeon\n\nPerhaps the best and most one-of-a-kind gyroids in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a special reward that can only be gifted to the player by the barista pigeon, Brewster. Brewster's unique gyroid, the Brewstoid, can only be gained once and is gifted after the player buys 51 cups of coffee at The Roost.\n\nThe Brewstoid cannot be purchased anywhere in the game or be obtained a second time, so be wary in gifting or selling it as there will be no replacement.\n\nThe special gyroid known as the Brewstoid looks like a miniature doll of the coffee-loving pigeon, and not only will it dance in a wobbly fashion like other gyroids in the game do, but it will coo like a pigeon in an adorable fashion. This is the only gyroid that can not be customized, so it will always look just like Brewster himself and is a loving symbol of the players' support for the coffee shop.\n\n2 The King Tut Mask Will Make Players' Trip\n\nNo Running Allowed For Pharaohs\n\nThe craftable golden item, the King Tut mask, is a hilariously oversized wearable mask that can work great for a Halloween costume to look like a pharaoh or just for wearing around for fun. The recipe requires five gold nuggets to make, which can be learned while picking up some of the gold that has been knocked out of rocks.\n\nOne hilarious feature of this giant hat is that if the player runs while wearing the King Tut mask, they will frequently trip and fall on their face, even leaving large skid marks in sand or dirt. If any villagers are nearby when the player trips, they will often look shocked or worried, sometimes even running over to see if the player is okay. Thankfully, nothing happens other than a little stumble, and even the marks on the ground disappear fairly quickly.\n\n1 Aliens Are Trying To Communicate\n\nEvery Week, They Hack The Game\n\nThere are more than just the friendly villagers and other common NPCs wanting to chat with the main character in ACNH; in fact, there are weekly communications from extraterrestrial lifeforms. This event is not one that is likely to be stumbled across inadvertently, as it requires the exact right timing and situation to see, but it can absolutely be a fun or scary reason to watch the television."
