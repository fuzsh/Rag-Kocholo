        "text": "If you have been active to social media lately, you may have seen so many posts about Animal Crossing on your feed. It has been getting a lot of attention and seems like almost all people are playing it. Thus, you have been wondering what is this hype all about. Unfortunately, you can’t buy a Nintendo Switch now because apparently it is already sold out. But there’s an alternative, and the good news is that it is free!\n\n♡ What is Animal Crossing? ♡\n\nAnimal Crossing is a social simulation video game series developed and published by Nintendo. The game mainly focus is that the player will be placed in an island where there are animals that you can interact, do activities such as harvesting fruits, catching bugs, fishing, and doing some missions. The game is known for its open-ended gameplay and real time clock. Meaning if its day time in the real world, it is also day time in the game.\n\n♡ Why is it famous? ♡\n\nThe game gained its fame from it’s first release way back 2001 for Nintendo 64. Since then, the series has been well loved by players. It is popular for its cute graphics, storyline, and background musics. But what really captured the hearts of many players was its relaxing gameplay. It is really up to you how would you play the game. Nobody’s going to tell you what to do, when to do it, how to do it. You can be yourself, and nobody will bother you. Another big thing is the capability to customize your characters and your island. And lastly, this game definitely has a humour. The animals’ dialogues are sometimes about hilarious jokes, witty lines, on-point advices and just anything under the sun.\n\n♡ What is Pocket Camp? ♡\n\nSince 2001, the Animal Crossing series has released 8 games already for different platforms. The latest one was the New Horizons which is for the Nintendo Switch. But before the New Horizons was released, Animal Crossing is actually available in iOS and Android devices which is the Pocket Camp.\n\nAnimal Crossing: Pocket Camp was released way back in October 2017. The good thing about it is that it is actually for free! Yes, you’ve heard that right. Unlike the other series, which is actually a bit pricey, it is for FREE! There are some in-game purchases to get a leg up on handy resources, but it’s definitely not necessary to have the full experience. of the game.\n\n♡ What is the difference between New Horizons and Pocket Camp? ♡\n\nIn Pocket Camp, the player will start off with a campsite and your goal is to build up the best campsite possible to invite all your animal friends to hang out at. You still gather gather various materials, befriending campers, craft furnitures and clothes. You can also invite campers, build relationship with them, give them treats, and dress them up.\n\nHowever, Pocket Camp is actually streamlined, slimmed-down version of the Animal Crossing games meaning it is kinda limited. One example is that you can’t really customize your own clothes or furnitures, which is the most seek after feature of New Horizons. Also, the crafting style in Pocket Camp is different because it is time based. You still have to wait for hours in order for your furniture or clothing to be finished. There are some features that are also time-based, such as some resources and the appearance of the animals.\n\n♡ How to download Pocket Camp? ♡\n\nUnfortunately, Pocket Camp is not available for some countries such as the Philippines. If it’s not available in your country, you can change country by doing these steps listed here. Please read the instructions there carefully and proceed with precautions.\n\n♡ My Personal Story ♡\n\nTo tell you the truth, I’ve been longing for this game for years already. I’ve discovered this game way back tumblr.com and weheartit.com days. The screenshots of the game are all over the site. I’ve been actually saving up in order for me to buy a Nintendo DS just for this game. However, as years go by, my priority has changed, well in short I’ve became an adult. Haha! Also, I don’t want to ask my parents to buy it for me. So, I decided to move on.\n\nHowever, because of the release of New Horizons, the urge for me to play this game came back. I really wanted to buy a Nintendo Switch. However, because of the demand, this game console was sold out. That’s why I’ve settled with the mobile version which is the Pocket Camp.\n\nEven though the Pocket Camp is kind of a limited version of New Horizons, I actually like the idea that it is time based because you won’t be playing it for long hours. You can stop and do some work or study for school. It is recommended for busy persons but not for hardcore gamers. It is like an entry point or a preparation for the New Horizons game.\n\nHave you already tried this game? Or are you currently playing New Horizons? I’d love to talk about Animal Crossing in the comment sections below. You can also drop your questions there as well. I’ll be happy to assist you if you’re having a hard time installing the game. Hope you’ll try out this game, because I’ve been enjoying it so far!"
