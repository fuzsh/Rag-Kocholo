        "text": "So, as we all know, Nintendo has had some questionable game experiences as with their past online gaming qualities. But, thereâs a lot of things that should be fixed about this app and just the service. But, I am talking about the app, not the service. Anyway, voice chat. There is a possible way to make this better: Allow us to use a headset via the headphone jack, implement a audio jack in the Switch Pro Controller. You get the idea. Also, if you have the app and you enter a game that is supported, you can replace voice chat with an actual chat; and other people can chat with a headset. Hereâs another idea...another chat function. It would be nice if through this app you could chat to your friends...especially for Animal Crossing, as you have codes. It would also be just convenient. Most of the previous features are only here for convenience. âEverybody relies on and uses their phone, so why not implement a voice chat system in the app?â Other things I think are useful, but my list of possible things they could change could work if applied.\n\nI only ever use it for Splatoon 3, as of now, and itâs pretty useful. The shop can help me get rare gear you usually donât get elsewhere, like the Red Battlecrab Shell. Being able to see the catalog is pretty cool, and I donât have to check my Status section in the menus. Wandercrust is ok, the Stay Crusty cap (and maybe in the future, any other gear) is ok at the very least, but it wouldnât remove much if it were removed. This is the only time you can see more Salmon Run stats more elaborately, and it warns you better than the ingame menus, such as Wildcard Rotations. As of now, we have only had 2 Splatfests in the full game, Gear vs. Grub vs. Fun, and Grass vs. Fire vs. Water, and itâs nice you can see who won and all the points. Itâs really useful that you can see what your friends are doing, especially when Iâm trying to host a friend game/private battle/league battle (in the future), and they arenât joining. Overall, this is WAY better than Splatoon 2âs, which was a more Cluttered mess. I donât have any other games with it, but Iâll take other reviewsâ word for it. Itâs ok, but not perfect.\n\nAlso, before you ask, I donât really use voice chat, I have my online friends on my contacts, so Iâm not sure about the quality.\n\nI really do like the spirit team creation features for ultimate and the recording side for splatoon but if this review get in the app developers hands I would recommend having more immersive features added for support for the games like guides or character stats or how in game tip are read through loading screen as well as update history so itâs one place they can quickly access instead of going to a website and waiting for people to sift through it and for spirit team building it would be helpful for it to display descriptions on what the effects do and if they stack or not and I would suggest that for any games that are supported by this app if DLC is made available details can be seen through the app as well as game purchase like how on the console you a wishlist or prepurchase option itâd be convenient if the eshop and its contents are visible through the app just like how Sony and Microsoft do with their apps in relation to their platforms you can buy the games and dlc using a mobile cellular device without being restricted of not have WiFi connections to make purchases for the console whether you have it in your hand or not"
