        "text": "I thought I was getting close to finishing up the aquarium wing in my Animal Crossing: New Horizons museum, but man, was I wrong. The July update just brought with it swimming, meaning that your little villager can now go explore the oceans surrounding the island and dive down for new critters to round out water, and I managed to deliver a ton of specimens to Blathers just this morning, and there’s no feeling like watching those new things pop up in there.\n\nThere are an absolute ton of sea creatures available, but unlike fish or bugs, there’s no real way to tell what you might be looking at before you collect them. You just need to swim around and look for some bubbles cropping up: when you see them, press Y to dive down and move yourself to the shadow. All shadows look the same, as far as I can tell, so you’ve got to just go over and see what it is.\n\nIt will take you more or less all year to get them all, just like with bugs and fish. Let’s take a look at what seems to be on offer, with credit to a few different sources for collation. I’ll update with more info soon, such as what’s available right now and what you’ll have to wait for to get later in the year.\n\nSea Pig\n\nSea Grapes\n\nSea Cucumber\n\nSeaweed\n\nSea Urchin\n\nSea Star\n\nSea Anemone\n\nSlate Pencil Urchin\n\nWhelk\n\nMussel\n\nOyster\n\nPear Oyster\n\nSea Slug\n\nMoon Jellyfish\n\nScallop\n\nAbalone\n\nGigas Giant Clam\n\nUmnrella Octopus\n\nOctopus\n\nChambered Nautilus\n\nDungeness Crab\n\nGazami Crab\n\nSnow Crab\n\nRed King Crab\n\nTurban Shell\n\nScallop\n\nSpider Crab\n\nTiger Prawn\n\nSweet Shrimp\n\nMantis Shrimp\n\nSpiny Lobster\n\nLobster\n\nGiant Isopod\n\nHorseshoe Crab\n\nSea Pineapple\n\nSpotted Garden Eel\n\nFlatworm\n\nVenus’s Flower Basket\n\nAmong all of these, the Scallop deserves a special note: when you get one of these, you’ll get a visit form the chilled-out Sea Otter Pascal, who will give you a DIY recipe from the Mermaid set. And everything will go to Blathers, of course, and I’ve got to say that I’m really loving how the aquarium is panning out. A few under-utilized areas are really opening up now, and it’s lovely."
