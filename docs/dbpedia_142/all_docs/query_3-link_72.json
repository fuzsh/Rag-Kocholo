        "text": "Both Stardew Valley and the Animal Crossing series have a lot in common in terms of atmosphere and prioritizing friendship in their games. Not only that, but both titles are available to play on the latest Nintendo console, the Switch.\n\nRELATED: Animal Crossing: 10 Quality Of Life Issues That Ver. 2.0 Still Didn't Address\n\nWith farming and cooking elements introduced through the version 2.0 update of Animal Crossing: New Horizons in November of last year, the games are more similar than ever. However, there are some aspects to Stardew Valley that make it stronger, and more importantly, a more memorable gaming experience than Animal Crossing.\n\n8 Profound Relationship With The Townsfolk\n\nIn Animal Crossing, players are encouraged to befriend the villagers to receive better gifts and possibly a portrait that can be hung up in their homes. In Stardew Valley, however, there is a carefully weaved narrative that progresses as players form closer relationships with the townsfolk.\n\nBy giving gifts to characters like Robin and Clint, players can delve deeper into their characters and find out about their pasts and personal hardships. The result is a more profound experience in the social element of Stardew Valley, which feels more realistic than in Animal Crossing.\n\n7 Helpful And Nutritional Recipes\n\nRecipes are acquired through finding and learning DIYs in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but in Stardew Valley they are learned through the cooking channel called The Queen of Sauce or through blossoming friendships.\n\nRELATED: Stardew Valley: Marriage Candidates And Their Zodiac Signs\n\nThere may be more recipes in Animal Crossing, at a whopping 141 in total, but the 74 Stardew Valley recipes not only improve players' health and energy, but also have special effects â€“ including improved mining and farming. Later in the game, having the right meals for certain activities can be the difference between success and complete failure.\n\n6 Are There Really Unlimited Quests?!\n\nPlayers can often run out of things to do in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, especially once all the shops and required buildings are complete, and the goal reached of having a 5-star island. However, even when Stardew's supposed end has been met, and all quests sent via mail are done and dusted, randomly generated quests can be found frequently outside Pierre's General Store. These quests can often be a bit random, with unusual requests being made from time to time, but players can be sure to never run low on to-do list tasks.\n\n5 A Gripping, Character Led Narrative\n\nThere isn't really a story mode in Animal Crossing, just tasks to complete to ensure a fully-realized island experience. Stardew Valley gives players the ability to work at their own pace, focusing on their skills or the aesthetics of their farm. All the while, there is a permeating narrative.\n\nRELATED: The 10 Most Popular Animal Crossing: New Horizons Villagers\n\nThe main character inherits their grandfather's old and run-down farm and decides to leave the corporate life behind to live in the rural Pelican Town in Stardew Valley. From there, it's all about the player learning to adapt to their new life, making money and friends along the way.\n\n4 Thrilling And Dangerous Combat\n\nAs players continue to progress, they'll start engaging in combat. In the mines of Pelican Town, near Robin's house, players will meet monsters from the plentiful Green Slime to the Shadow Shaman. Once players have unlocked Skull Cavern, they're likely to encounter the Pepper Rex and Serpent, which require better weapons and skills to defeat.\n\nMonsters will also drop loot once killed, which can be used for important upgrades. If players decide to have a Wilderness Farm, monsters will spawn each night, increasing in difficulty as the player's combat level rises.\n\n3 Play On Practically Any Console Or Platform\n\nWhile Animal Crossing is only available on Nintendo consoles, Stardew Valley can be played on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, iOS, and Android. This means budding farmers won't need to shell out on a specific console to be able to play the game.\n\nRELATED: 10 Games To Play If You Think Animal Crossing Should Have A Story Mode\n\nFor the moment, players from different consoles or platforms can play together just yet. Farmers will need to be playing on the same platform to be able to join multiplayer games.\n\n2 Multiplayer LAN Play With Friends\n\nIn Animal Crossing: New Horizons, players can visit each other's islands via the airport with a Nintendo Online subscription. However, unless players share a console, there's no way to build an island from scratch in a multiplayer game. If Stardew Valley players are on the same platform, they can start up a multiplayer farm with up to four players, each with their own cabin. This makes creating a highly successful farm a whole lot easier. However, the farm will only be accessible by the owner, so other players will only gain access once the main player logs on.\n\n1 Almost Infinite End Game\n\nStardew Valley can often feel somewhat endless, with so many characters to meet, locations to unlock, and missions to complete. Even though the game technically ends when Grandpa evaluates the player's success at the beginning of Year 3, farmers can play for as long as they want. One of the best aspects of the late game of Stardew Valley is fixing the boat at the back of Willy's Fish Shop, which opens up a whole new world to this cozy farming simulator. Players will need a hefty amount of iridium, batteries, and hardwood."
