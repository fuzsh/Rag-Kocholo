        "text": "Pendrecht is a post-war neighbourhood in the southern part of Rotterdam.\n\nHeritage status: No General condition of Garden City: Reasonable condition\n\nGeneral description\n\nRead more ...\n\nArchitecture / Urban planning\n\nPendrecht is bounded by Oldegaarde to the north, the Zuiderparkweg to the east, the Charloisse Lagedijk to the south, and the Groene Kruisweg to the west. Slinge is the main traffic artery and also shopping street. The square Plein 1953, which also has shops, is the hart of the neighbourhood.\n\nStam-Beese designed an urban planning structure with straight streets, where high and low building blocks are situated in a tight pattern. The open streets had lots of greenery and the open land between the houses were shared by all. It was meant as a place where different population groups could live side by side. Shops and schools were also planned precisely; in a way the neighbourhood was meant to be largely self-sustained.\n\nThe flats all had the same convenient and practical layout. Since the aim was to build as many flats as possible, the flats were small in size, with an average area not exceeding 53 square metres.\n\nRecent developments\n\nIn the early 21st centruy, many homes proved outdated and too small. Young people moved away to better housing, while seniors stayed. New residents flocked to the low rents. Vacancy and impoverishment caused the neighbourhood to fall into disrepair and acquire a bad image. A major restructuring took place, when hundreds of homes were demolished or renovated. New, larger houses were built, which attracted families again, and the number of rental properties was reduced in favour of owner-occupied ones. It did Pendrecht good.\n\nSources\n\nWebsite URL\n\nWikipedia [in Dutch]\n\nWebsite URL\n\nThe history of Pendrecht [in Dutch]\n\nOrganizations"
