        "text": "Walk-in Cinema\n\nFebruary 12 and March 4, 19.00\n\nTwo Stones (2019)\n\nWendelien van Oldenborgh\n\n61 minutes and 15 seconds\n\nEnglish, Dutch, Russian, Ukrainian; Turkish and English subtitles\n\nCommissioned for the bauhaus imaginista project, this film explores the significance of Bauhaus-trained architect Lotte Stam-Beese and writer, editor and equal rights activist Hermina Huiswoud. Though they never met, both women experienced life in the Soviet Union in the early 1930s and ended up influencing public life in the Netherlands in the 1950s. Two Stones highlights Stam-Beese’s thoughts on housing and Huiswoud’s struggles for racial and class equality through the ideals and practice of communism.\n\nThe 2019 film focuses on two important locations: the constructivist neighborhood in the vicinity of KhTZ (a tractor factory) in Kharkiv, Ukraine—where Stam-Beese served as part of a Soviet design team in the 1930s—and the acclaimed 1950s Pendrecht district in Rotterdam, which introduced her ideas on urban planning to the post-war Netherlands. 20 years later, Huiswoud protested against the Rotterdam housing rule, limiting Caribbean Dutch inhabitants to settle in any districts if their presence would exceed 5% of the population. Superimposing these two locations as well as both women’s legacies, the film shows the resonances and dissonances in the ideals and life experiences of the individuals who inhabit there today.\n\nOrganized in parallel to the exhibition bauhaus imaginista: Moving Away. Istanbul at SALT Beyoğlu until April 3, Bauhaus Screenings are open to all and free. Reservations are not accepted.\n\n  Share\n\n  "
