        "text": "By Greyscape\n\n1st November 2017\n\n2019 saw the centenary of the opening of the Bauhaus in Dessau. A school whose influence fuelled the design and development of beautiful buildings, furniture and good taste in function and ornament. The story of the Bauhaus encapsulates so much of the tragedy of the last century. Society in Germany came to be so barbarous that a school of design and it all it stood for, its teachers and students, became anathema.\n\nPhoto Credits:"
