        "text": "Nieuwe Vroenten breaks through the inertia of the Dutch rural landscape, particularly in regions dominated by industrial farming. The project by Jaap Korteweg, LOLA Landscape Architects, Gezond Boeren & Wonen - Rabobank, P2 and Arcadis envisions transforming 1,000 hectares of rural land into healthy, sustainable landscape that combines food production with energy generation, nature and living spaces. To establish a landscape for working, living and agriculture, that gives as much as it takes, the agricultural industry needs the transition to animal-free farming. This shift will increase calorie productivity, which in turn will free up a third of the land for conversion to nature, creating space for 2,000 homes of various types. The biobased model shows the possible future landscape in North Brabant. By creating a tangible, exemplary agriculture and residential landscape that functions within the planetary boundaries of food and energy, Nieuwe Vroenten demonstrates the beauty and feasibility of the protein transition. From 29 June to 13 October 2024, the Nieuwe Vroenten model is part of the International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam (IABR). An exhibition at the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven will also follow later in October.

Concept yearbook. The work of LOLA Landscape Architects has increasingly focused on the climate crisis. Not only does this play an increasing role in our design projects, LOLA also develops ideas through research projects and exhibitions. In the CG. Concept yearbook 2024, several of our projects are addressed; Sponsland, Merwede Utrecht, Park Poelzone Westland, Stadhuispromenade Almere and Superbloei Arnhem. You can read the full article on our website (in Dutch and French). The yearbook is a publication of CG Concept by PSG Editions, in collaboration with CoÃ¶peratie De Bloeimeesters Embuild Vlaanderen and BFG - FBEP.

Together we created a green oasis at the heart of the of the industrial heritage setting of De Meelfabriek, a landmark complex in the city of Leiden. Based on the masterplan of Studio Akkerhuis, De Meelfabriek Leiden site has been redeveloped into an attractive mixed-use area. The garden is a lush planted and peaceful place. Carefully framed, it is designed as a large â€˜nature paintingâ€™. Every season reveals a new beautiful color and shape, utilizing the seasonal dynamics in its best interest. The garden is fitted with pebble-shaped sitting objects and from these benches, one can enjoy the activities of the animals, insects and people in garden in the best way.

PAYSAGE TOPSCAPE honors landscape architecture projects that combine landscape and architecture both with large-scale interventions and through smaller scale and dimension experiences in which the vegetation is used as a construction material, and not just ornamental, pursuing biodiversity and sustainability objectives. The more than 242 candidate projects, characterized by a high level of design quality, made the jury's task extremely difficult, and each decision was made with great care and respect for the work of each participant. We are therefore proud that both â€˜Bajeskwartierâ€™ and â€˜Etzenrade Castleâ€™ have been rewarded. ðŸŒ³ Category â€˜Drosscape landscape redevelopment of former industrial areasâ€™ Bajeskwartier Amsterdam (first place) ðŸŒ³ Category â€˜Interventions on parks and gardens of historical, artistic or landscape interestâ€™ Etzenrade Castle (second place) LOLA associate and Bajeskwartier project leader, Artur Borejszo attended the â€˜City landscape for climate changeâ€™ symposium for a presentation and to accept the awards on behalf of our partners Eric-Jan Pleijster, Peter Veenstra, Etzenrade project leader Brigitta van Weeren and the LOLA team.

The municipality of Vlaardingen wants to restore the city's connection with the river and make the Rivierzone (river zone) an attractive area for living, working and recreation. Together with Kickstad, Studio for New Realities, Dick van Veen, ToekomstEnergie, the Municipality of Vlaardingen, and residents, we will create an attractive public space. Our goal is to transform the Rivierzone into a lively destination for the people of Vlaardingen by focusing on green connections between city center and river. Rivierzone as the place you want to be!

At the presentation of the 2024 awards, the landscape design of the public space of Merwede Utrecht received a special mention. LOLA Landscape Architects is designing Utrecht's newest urban district as a car-free area, where green is the starting point. Merwede is to become an inviting, green, and lively high-density urban district of 6,000 homes spanned over 24ha in southwest Utrecht. With nature being a precondition for healthy urban living, maximizing urban nature in a car-free public space that prioritizes pedestrians and cyclists is a priority. The nature-inclusive design goes hand in hand with climate adaptation and the social design of the city. For the landscape design, LOLA Landscape Architects teamed up with Bureau Stadsnatuur to work in close collaboration with the Utrecht Municipality, BURA, and other stakeholders.
