        "text": "How did progressive architecture develop in The Netherlands in the past hundred years and what have the residents of 'normal houses' gained from the wild experiments that the architects have sometimes carried out? In September, we will put the strongest examples of innovative, avant-garde residential architecture in the spotlight in five online modules.\n\nThe online program for the online edition of the Iconic Houses Conference in September provides insight into Dutch residential architecture of the 20th century for architecture enthusiasts, owners of modern homes, professional managers of modern museum houses, architects and heritage specialists.\n\nThe program consists of five modules of one and a half hours, each with a live-streamed keynote lecture and an episode of a new series of thematic videos in which twenty iconic houses across the Netherlands are discussed: from the Amsterdam School and De Stijl to Postmodernism, from Gerrit Rietveld to Mart van Schijndel and many others. There are also famous examples of social housing, an area in which the Netherlands was particularly successful. The modules will go live on Thursday 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 September. The lectures are in English, the thematic video series is Dutch spoken with English subtitles. The package of recorded lectures and video series can later be purchased via the webshop to view on demand.\n\nThemes addressed in the live streamed lectures and video series, which features the twenty modern house museums in The Netherlands, will include:\n\n• Hygiene and Health in the Modern Home\n\n• Palaces for the People\n\n• A Woman’s Place: Clients, Architects, Promoters\n\n• Experiments with Space\n\n• Home as Self-Portrait: Architect’s Houses\n\nModule 1.
