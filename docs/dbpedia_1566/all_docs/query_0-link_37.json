        "text": "Abstract\n\nFrom the end of the 19th century women architects had played important roles in the making of the built environment. But their presence and participation in the building of the modern city was a fact that has been forgotten over time. This text introduces the case study of the proposals made by four women: Margarete Schütte Lihotzky, Jakoba Mulder, Lotte Stam-Beese and Carmen Portinho. They are just a sample to show the importance of women’s contribution in the building of better housing and neighborhoods.\n\nKeywords\n\nModern Movement, Modern architecture, Living heritage, Modern housing, Housing preservation, Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, Jakoba Mulder, Lotte Stam-Beese, Carmen Portinho.\n\nIssue 51\n\nYear 2014\n\nPages 74-79\n\nDOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.52200/51.A.M2WWVTW8\n\nPDF (English)"
