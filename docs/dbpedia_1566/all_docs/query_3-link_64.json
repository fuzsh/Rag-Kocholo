        "text": "The members of Opbouw, the group of modern architects based in Rotterdam, made a study plan for Pendrecht and presented it at the 1949 CIAM congress in Bergamo. CIAM stands for Congrès Internationaux d’Architecture Modernes, the platform where modern architects and urban designers gathered to exchange ideas.\n\nThe key principle behind these post-war districts was the so-called neighbourhood concept, an American idea propagated in the Netherlands in particular by Alexander Bos, director of the Department of Public Housing, and architect Willem van Tijen. The construction of clearly defined neighbourhoods, each with its own centre containing amenities, would counteract the social fragmentation and massive scale of the big city by fostering a sense of community.\n\nIn addition, a new plot arrangement called the wooneenheid (‘residential cluster’) was employed in Pendrecht. Each cluster consisted of about eighty homes for both big and small families, such as singles and seniors. It consisted of two tall freestanding apartment blocks and three low-rise blocks grouped around a shared green space. Eight to ten of these clusters formed a neighbourhood; the whole district consisted of four neighbourhoods grouped around the centrally located Plein 1953 and the central access road, called Slinge. Each neighbourhood contained a commercial centre for daily needs, a kindergarten and a community centre. Primary schools were situated centrally between the neighbourhoods. That was also the location of the Saint Bavo Catholic Church by architect Harry Nefkens (1958-1960), with its freestanding bell tower, the only striking structure in the district. Five high-rise slabs scattered around the district also form landmarks. Construction of the first six homes started on 21 December 1953. The streets of Pendrecht are named after villages in Zeeland and Zuid-Holland that were hit by the disastrous flooding of 1953.\n\nThe residential cluster was later commonly referred to as a stempel, or ‘stamp’. For it looked as if the clusters had been stamped onto the available site. However, closer examination reveals that these stamps show much more variation than a quick glance might suggest. Moreover, the mirroring of stamps added variety in terms of patterns.\n\nPendrecht consisted of ten sub-areas, which were developed around the centre clockwise, starting from the north-west. The small shopping centre at Zijpe, designed by Lucas and Niemeijer, is a good example of the careful urban design and functionalist architecture of Pendrecht. Pitched roofs even featured in this oldest part of Pendrecht. Apart from Lucas and Niemeijer, typical residential architects such as Herman Bakker, Joost Boks, Harry Nefkens, Kuiper Gouwetor & De Ranitz, Jos. and Leo de Jonge, bureau Hendriks Van der Sluys and Van den Bosch, bureau Vermeer and Van Herwaarden and Ernest Groosman designed buildings here.\n\nThe residential cluster was therefore intended for various categories of residents, which was expressed in the appearance. Unlike the members of Opbouw, Stam-Beese saw the residential cluster not as a social grouping but as a design element. Sociological studies also revealed that the residential cluster did not function as a social group. In theory, one could live in a residential cluster from the cradle to the grave. In practice, however, children left home and departed the neighbourhood, leaving the original residents behind.\n\nThe population of Pendrecht aged, and from the 1990s on the small and spartan flats became a temporary station for residents from urban renewal districts and groups attracted by low rents. The maintenance of the plentiful public space became problematic and neighbourhood amenities gradually disappeared. The distinctively functional style and industrial construction systems of the 1950s gave the neighbourhood a frugal appearance. The architects had devoted more attention to optimizing residential floor plans than to the appearance of the homes. Energy efficiency was not an issue in the design of the blocks.\n\nSince the start of the twenty-first century, large parts of Pendrecht have been torn down and replaced by larger and more expensive homes for a more varied population composition. Some 1750 homes have disappeared, and 1600 new ones built.\n\nA total of 177 homes by Duinker Van der Torre have been built in the north-eastern area, and the distinctive 'fishbowls' by Harry Nefkens have been renovated. Some homes for seniors and a residential block on Slinge have been replaced by studio apartments and a tall block of apartments for seniors by Karelse Van der Meer. Henk van Schagen renovated a number of complexes around Zierikzeestraat. Endry van Velzen of De Nijl (1996-2000) built patio dwellings near the centre of Pendrecht. He also drew up the urban design for Plein 1953. Three urban villas by Inbo Architects, two residential towers containing 132 so-called ‘lifetime-compatible homes’ by Daan ter Avest (XX architects) and a supermarket and library achieve the desired increase in density.\n\nThe urban structure has been maintained in the south-eastern part, but the blocks of staircase-access apartments have been replaced by rows of ground-access dwellings. They have vertical facades to the street but mono-pitch roofs at the rear."
