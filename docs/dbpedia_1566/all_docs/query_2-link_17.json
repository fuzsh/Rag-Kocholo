        "text": "How has avant-garde architecture developed in the Netherlands over the past hundred years and what have the residents of 'ordinary houses' benefited from the -sometimes wild- experiments of the architects? The film Pioneers of the Dutch Modern House provides insight into Dutch residential architecture of the 20th century. A must for architecture enthusiasts, owners of modern houses, architects, architecture students and anyone with an interest in young heritage or design.\n\nThe film consists of five themes in which twenty iconic houses, spread throughout the Netherlands, are discussed: from the Amsterdam School to Postmodernism, from Gerrit Rietveld to Mart van Schijndel and many others. There are also famous examples of social housing, an area in which the Netherlands was particularly successful. Iconic Houses counts 26 member museums in the Netherlands now and internationally almost 200 modern house museums are affiliated with the network.\n\nBecause of its success, the film is programmed regularly by member museums of Iconic Houses. The next screening is in Mies van der Rohe's Haus Lange in Krefeld on Sunday, March 24, 2024.\n\nIf you sign up for our newsletter, you will automatically be informed when new screenings are scheduled. You can also stream Pioneers of the Dutch Modern House via the webshop.\n\nThemes addressed in the film include:\n\nHygiene and Health in the Modern Home\n\nPalaces for the People\n\nA Woman’s Place: Clients & Architects\n\nExperiments with Space\n\nHome as Self-Portrait: Architect's Houses\n\nTheme 1.
