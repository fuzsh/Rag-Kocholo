        "text": "\"Frau Architekt\" by DAM shows the emancipation movements and in particular gender politics which were driving forces, over the last 100 years, in the 20th century. Women entered Modernism by conquering professions from which they had hitherto been excluded, by becoming politically active, in part taking extreme positions, and by trying out new gender relationships.\n\nThe exhibition shows how 22 women encountered the massive upheaval by questioning the conventional standards of what was feminine and establishing themselves in the architectural profession.\n\nWhy FRAU ARCHITEKT now?\n\nOne reason: For some time now clearly more women than men have been studying architecture, and the trend is upward. By no means all of them actually make it in the profession; some do not even join in the first place, or they stop after only a short time. The “missing group”, the discrepancy between the number of female students and the number of women who are registered as member architects of a chamber of architects, is about 20 percent.\n\nOf those who stay, few make it into the top league. There, architecture remains a men’s affair. So the big question is:\n\nWhy do so many women who have often graduated with flying colors then turn their backs on architecture again?\n\nA second reason: A disturbing number arose when we looked back at the history of the DAM itself. Of the total of about 370 exhibitions that have taken place since the museum’s foundation back in 1984, about 100 were shows on individual architects; by contrast, of them, only four were monographic exhibitions on a female architect. FRAU ARCHITEKT took this imbalance as a reason to focus for the first time on women architects in Germany as a whole, on past and present, on their achievements in architecture, their lives, and their struggle to survive.\n\n22 portraits of women architects from 1900 to the present\n\nFRAU ARCHITEKT presents 22 women in Germany who have substantially influenced architecture since 1900 – or still do so. To be precise, it is slightly more than a century, as the story begins with Emilie Winkelmann, who founded her own architecture office in Berlin in 1907. The line runs from the beginnings right through German history since 1900, the Reich under the Kaiser, the interwar years followed by the Third Reich, through the division of Germany and its reunification into the 21st century. Analogously to that history and all its ruptures, FRAU ARCHITEKT presents a broad spectrum of major female architects who not only come from different social milieus, but can also be assigned to conflicting gender positions and opposing camps in both architecture and politics. Thus, the group includes female pioneers driven by Modernism, members of the women’s movement and staunch feminists, aristocrats and members of the middle class, left-wingers and right-wingers, socialists and businesswomen, Jews forced into exile and last but not least a prominent Nazi – the pioneers were not always to be found under the banner of democratic progress.\n\nSome of the architects are as good as unknown even among the specialists, and certainly to the general public. FRAU ARCHITEKT seeks to give women in architecture more visibility, to ensure they do not remain anonymous and to put faces to their names and give them voices. The flashback into history also serves as an instrument that enables us to see the present and the future with a keener focus.\n\nFRAU ARCHITEKT in film\n\nIn addition to the 22 portraits, the exhibition aims to give women architects a voice – as examples and representatives. The house within a house, which Oswald Mathias Ungers inscribed into the DAM as a programmatic core, has been transformed into a “women’s room”, acting as a cinema for nine film portraits for the duration of the exhibition. Women architects address questions that have been important to women in architecture over the last century, and possibly still are today. Born between 1930 and 1995, they report on their experiences in the postwar period, in East Germany, West Germany, following Reunification and in the present day – a broad spectrum of very different professional foci and decades of bundled occupational and life experience in the male-dominated architectural profession.\n\nIris Dullin-Grund (Berlin) won the competition for an “educational and cultural building” in Neubrandenburg in 1960. Ten years later she became municipal architect, a position she held until Reunification. In the former East Germany this was one of the most renowned posts in architecture. In 1983, 39-year-old Ingeborg Kuhler (Berlin) won the competition for the Museum für Technik und Arbeit (today the Technoseum) in Mannheim. In 1984 she became the first woman to be appointed to a German architecture faculty as professor of design – at Berlin’s Hochschule der Künste (today the UdK, Berlin University of the Arts), where she taught until 2007. Single mother Marie-Theres Deutsch (Frankfurt/Main) made an architectural mark on Frankfurt with the Portikus and the revitalization of the banks of the River Main. Susanne Hoffmann (Berlin) founded the studio Baupiloten in 2001 and takes a participatory approach to all her projects, primarily educational buildings, one that involves users in the planning process. Since graduating in 2004, Bavarian architect Anna Heringer (Lauffen) has principally constructed buildings in Bangladesh that take into consideration traditional design. She has received numerous awards for her work. The two young architects Cathrin Schultz and Kathrin Sievers have been successfully working together in Bremerhaven for a few years and received the BDA Award Bremen in 2014. Students Aylin Akgöz and Meike Kimmel are about to graduate and enter the profession.\n\nFRAU ARCHTEKT and “Treasures from the Archive”\n\nParallel to the exhibition the DAM is showing in its series “Treasures from the Archive” a small selection of the plans and drawings for an unrealized design for a Berlin office building by Zaha Hadid (1950-2016). The late Zaha Hadid is undoubtedly the most famous female architect of the 21st century. Even though she cannot be counted among German women architects, her early successes in Germany (Aedes exhibition, West Berlin, 1984; Vitra Fire Station, Weil am Rhein, 1997) played an important role in her career.\n\nBeyond FRAU ARCHITEKT – supporting program and cooperations with other institutions\n\nToday the gender upheaval is discussed right across society; it affects the social reality of women in all professional fields. For this reason too FRAU ARCHITEKT targets a broad spectrum of visitors. The exhibition is intended to address not only female and male architects, men and women in design professions, but also an audience interested in such topics as gender equality and contemporary history. FRAU ARCHITEKT acts as a visualized platform offering everyone information and an opportunity for discussion. As such, the extensive supporting program relies on cooperation with universities, professional associations and networks as well as with institutions that are a significant part of urban society and likewise address topics relating to gender equality. Accompanying film series, work reports by Frankfurt women architects, an informal talk round with the very first women architects, workshop series and a PechaKucha Night round out the exhibition.\n\n“Jeanne D’ARCH”, a symposium curated by Julia Hinderink and planned for early November, invites eleven women architects to debate (female) architectural positions in relation to the topics material, participation, education, role models, awards, and exhibitions. An international symposium entitled.\n\n“Women Architects and Politics in the long 20th Century” will follow in January 2018 and will address the current status of gender research in architecture – with academics from Europe, the USA and Israel. The cooperations are very broad, ranging from the neighboring Filmmuseum, the Historisches Museum and Jüdisches Museum to the Dept. of Women’s Affairs of the City of Frankfurt/Main, the Evangelische Akademie and Volkshochschule Frankfurt (Adult Education Center), to Goethe University Frankfurt (Institute of Art Education), Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences and Technische Universität Darmstadt.\n\n“Who’s afraid of women who build?” – FRAU ARCHITEKT for children and young people\n\nA comprehensive educational program is geared towards children and young people, aiming here too to discuss opportunities and limitations in the architectural profession and to sharpen gender awareness of the challenging of existing role models. As such, a technology action week entitled “Jungen konstruieren – Mädchen dekorieren?” (Boys construct – girls decorate?) is planned in cooperation with the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. It will offer both mixed school classes and groups of just girls an opportunity to try out several things at “experiment stations”.\n\nWorkshops and projects such as “Bauen Frauen anders?” (Do women build differently?), “Rosa Räume für Rapunzel” (Pink rooms for Rapunzel) and the building academy “Wer hat Angst vor Frauenzimmern” (Who’s afraid of women who build?) offer practical opportunities for exploration, also and in particular for target groups for whom cultural participation is not a given. A children’s non-fiction book “Frauen bauen. Kinder entdecken Architektinnen” (Women who build. Children discover women architects) will put the gender question on the compass of 10-14 year olds and tell stories of women who had or have to hold their own in the man’s world of architecture – in an authentic manner and on an equal footing.\n\nFRAU ARCHITEKT is sponsored by the German Federal Cultural Foundation, Halle. The exhibition is under the auspices of the Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, Dr. Barbara Hendricks, and the President of the German Federal Chamber of Architects (BAK), Barbara Ettinger-Brinckmann.\n\n22 PORTRAITS"
