        "text": "Lotte\n\nStam Beese created this work by superimposing a photograph of Otti Berger over\n\nan image of the Bauhaus studio building in 1928. The Bauhaus was Germany’s most\n\nadvanced school of modern design. Stam Beese studied architecture, weaving, and\n\nphotography at the Bauhaus; Otti Berger was one of the school’s most well-known\n\nweavers.\n\nIn Stam Beese’s photograph, the linear structure\n\nof the Bauhaus balconies adds a sense of assertiveness and hope to Berger’s\n\nfeminine face. Nevertheless, destiny did not favor this gifted weaver. In 1939,\n\nwhile visiting her ailing mother in Yugoslavia, Berger was seized by the Nazis\n\nand died in a concentration camp."
