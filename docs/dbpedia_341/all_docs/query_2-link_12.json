        "text": "Queen Victoria has been portrayed or referenced many times.\n\nLiterature\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1937 Lord Chamberlain the Earl of Cromer ruled that no British sovereign may be portrayed on the British stage until 100 years after his or her accession. For this reason, Laurence Housman's play Victoria Regina (1935), which had earlier appeared at the Gate Theatre Studio in London with Pamela Stanley in the title role, could not have its British premiere until the centenary of Queen Victoria's accession, 20 June 1937. This was a Sunday, so the new premiere took place the next day, at the Lyric Theatre. Pamela Stanley reprised the title role at Housman's request, and Carl Esmond played Prince Albert.[1] The play later appeared on Broadway, where Helen Hayes portrayed the Queen, with Vincent Price in the role of Prince Albert.\n\nVaughan Wilkins' novel And So-Victoria (1937) focuses on Victoria's life.[2]\n\nQueen Victoria appears in Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel From Hell, where she is depicted as instigating the Whitechapel murders.\n\nA Royal Diaries book was written, documenting her childhood between 1829 and 1830: Victoria, May Blossom of Britannia by Anna Kirwan.\n\nThe Victorian age is experienced through the eyes of the fictional Morland family in The Abyss, The Hidden Shore, The Winter Journey, The Outcast, The Mirage, The Cause, The Homecoming and The Question, Volumes 18â€“25 respectively of The Morland Dynasty, a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles. One of the characters becomes Victoria's devoted lady-in-waiting.\n\nCynthia Harrod-Eagles also wrote I Victoria, a fictional autobiography of Queen Victoria.\n\nThere is a Sanskrit poem named Cakravarttini gunamanimala, written by T. Ganapati Sastri on Queen Victoria.[3]\n\nAnother Sanskrit poem, titled Victoria Carita Sangraha, was written by scholar Keralavarman on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the coronation of Queen Victoria.[4]\n\nAlthough she did not live to see the Victorian age, Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) wrote a number of poetic tributes to the young princess and queen. These are:\n\nFisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832. 'The Princess Victoria', to accompany a plate drawn by Anthony Stewart and engraved by T. Woolnoth. (This plate is in some editions, entitled 'The Princess Alexandrina-Victoria')[5]\n\nFisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837. 'The Princess Victoria', to accompany a plate engraved by J.

Another Monty Python sketch contains a footrace in which all the contestants are dressed as Queen Victoria.\n\nIn a series of sketches portraying the Phantom Raspberry Blower, the Two Ronnies dress an entire squad of policemen as Queen Victoria to act as body doubles for protection from the PRB.\n\nIn the 2006 series of Doctor Who, Queen Victoria appears in the episode \"Tooth and Claw\", where she is played by Pauline Collins. In the episode, set in 1879, she is threatened by a werewolf that wants to infect her and take control of her empire. It is suggested that a scratch from the werewolf is the source of haemophilia in many of her descendants. Rose Tyler makes a bet with the Doctor for Â£10 that she can get the Queen to say \"We are not amused\". At the episode's conclusion, she founds the Torchwood Institute, an integral feature of the spin-off series Torchwood, with various (fictional) speeches and proclamations by her available on the Torchwood Institute website. An image of Collins as Victoria was later displayed prominently in the 2017 episode \"Empress of Mars\", set during the later years of Victoria's reign (coincidentally, the episode guest-starred Ferdinand Kingsley, who at the time was co-starring with Jenna Coleman in the ITV series based on Victoria's life). In 2008, the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith, notes Her Majesty's awareness of aliens in The Sarah Jane Adventures episode, \"Enemy of the Bane\", to which her young apprentice Rani Chandra responds, \"I'll bet she wasn't amused.\"\n\nThe BBC series Blackadder Goes Forth, set in World War I, alludes humorously to Queen Victoria's heritage. Captain Blackadder interrogates Captain Kevin Darling whom he suspects to be a German spy. Captain Darling claims that he is \"as British as Queen Victoria\", to which Captain Blackadder replies: \"So your father's German, you're half German and you married a German?\"\n\nStatues\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll's works as a sculptor is her marble statue of her mother at Kensington Palace, and a bronze version erected in front of the Royal Victoria College, McGill University in Montreal.[16]\n\nThe prominent Victoria Memorial stands in Kolkata (Calcutta), and in Bangalore the statue of the Queen stands at the beginning of MG Road, one of the city's major roads.[17] In the town of Cape Coast, Ghana, a bust of the Queen presides, rather forlornly, over a small park where goats graze around her.[18] In Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, a statue toward the harbour from the centre of Kent and Cambridge Terraces. There is also a Queen Victoria Statue in the heart of Valletta, Malta's capital.\n\nVictoria Jubilee Town Hall in Trivandrum is still one of city's most sought after theatres for live entertainment and is considered a prestigious landmark by both locals and tourists alike.\n\nIn Hong Kong, a statue of Queen Victoria is located on the east side of Victoria Park in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Island. The statue once sat in Statue Square in Central but was removed and sent to Tokyo to be destroyed at the time of Japanese occupation of the territory, during World War II. With Japan's defeat and subsequent retreat in 1945, The United Kingdom recovered Hong Kong, and the statue was retrieved and placed in the park.\n\nIn Pietermaritzburg, capital of the South African province of KwaZulu Natal, formerly the British colony of Natal before formation of the Union of South Africa, there is a statue of Victoria in front of the provincial legislature building, the former parliament building of the colony of Natal. There is also a statue of Queen Victoria in front of the South African Parliament.\n\nMost of the large cities in Australia that prospered during the Victorian era feature prominent statues of Queen Victoria. Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales has several. There is one statue (re-sited from the forecourt of the Irish Parliament building in Dublin) dominating the southern entrance to the Queen Victoria Building that was named in her honour in 1898. Another Sydney statue of Queen Victoria stands in the forecourt of the Federal Court of Australia building on Macquarie Street, looking across the road to a statue of her husband, inscribed \"Albert the Good\". In Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, the Queen Victoria Gardens named after her also features a large memorial statue in marble and granite. In Perth, capital city of Western Australia a marble statue stands in King's Park overlooking the city. In Adelaide, capital city of the state of South Australia, the Queen Victoria Square, named after her also has a large statue of her.[19] In Brisbane, capital city of the state of Queensland, there is a statue of her in Queens Square, also named for her;.[20] Ballarat, a boomtown in Victoria has a statue of Queen Victoria in the main street directly opposite its town hall. A small bust of the Queen is in the Queen Victoria Gardens in Burnt Pine, the largest town in the Australian territory of Norfolk Island.\n\nStatues erected to Victoria are common in Canada, where her reign included the original confederation of the country and the addition of three more provinces and two territories. A bas-relief image of Victoria is on the wall of the entrance to the Canadian Parliament, and her statue is in the Parliamentary library as well as on the grounds.[21]\n\nMusical theatre\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1972 Charles Strouse wrote a musical, I and Albert,[22] which was presented in the West End at the Piccadilly Theatre on 6 November 1972. The musical was not a success and did not transfer as planned to Broadway. It remains notable chiefly as Sarah Brightman's stage debut.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish rock band The Kinks honour Queen Victoria and her empire in their 1969 song \"Victoria\". The song has since been covered by English rock band The Kooks, English post-punk band The Fall, American alternative rock band Cracker, and American rock band Sonic Youth. Both The Kinks' and The Fall's versions were UK Top 40 hits.\n\nCanadian singer Leonard Cohen refers to her in a mostly non-factual way in his 1964 poem \"Queen Victoria and Me\", and again in the 1972 song \"Queen Victoria\" (based on the poem). The song was later covered by Welsh musician John Cale.\n\nIn 2006, the Comics Sherpa online comic service started carrying a comic strip titled The New Adventures of Queen Victoria using cut-out photographs and portraits of the Queen and others.[23]\n\nIn the Japanese anime and manga series Kuroshitsuji (Black Butler), she appears as Ciel Phantomhive's primary boss.\n\nQueen Victoria's reign features in the 2003 Paradox Interactive grand strategy game, Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun. In this game a player guides a country through colonisation, the Industrial Revolution, warfare and various historic events.[24]\n\nShe makes an appearance in the 2015 action-adventure video game Assassin's Creed: Syndicate developed by Ubisoft Quebec.[25]\n\nQueen Victoria leads the English civilization in the 2016 4X video game Civilization VI developed by Firaxis Games.[26][27]"
