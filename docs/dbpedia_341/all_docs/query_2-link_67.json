General or approximate dates file before specific dates of events. The section covers events to the end of 1902. Most films come from four main producers:\n\ni) British Mutoscope and Biograph Company\n\nBiograph's cameraman was William Kennedy-Laurie Dickson, accompanied by his assistants William Cox and Jonathan Seward. Dickson, who recounts his experiences in The Biograph in Battle (1901), sailed from Southampton on 14 October 1899 aboard the SS Dunottar Castle along with Sir Redvers Buller. Dickson followed Buller's progress from Cape Town to Durban, and thereafter to the camp at Frere, where he filmed during the Battles of Colenso and Spion Kop. He followed Buller into Ladysmith, then covered the fall of Bloemfontein and Pretoria to Lord Roberts before leaving South Africa on 18 July 1900. Dickson used the bulky 70mm Mutograph camera (NFTVA viewing copies are on 35mm).\n\nii) Paul's Animatograph Works\n\nRobert Paul is known to have had two cameramen working in South Africa, recruited from the British armed forces. One was Surgeon-Major Walter Calverley Beevor, of the Scots Guards; the other is not given in British sources, but Thelma Gutsche names Sydney Melsom of the City Imperial Volunteers (no such name is listed among the CIV, but there was a F.A. Melsom). Beevor was probably able to film between October 1899 and February 1900, when he filmed the surrender of Cronje to Lord Roberts. Paul also produced `fake' newsfilms of the war (none survive).\n\niii) Warwick Trading Company\n\nThe Warwick Trading Company, run by Charles Urban, had four cameramen in South Africa: John Benett-Stanford, Edgar Hyman, Joe Rosenthal and Sydney Goldman. Benett-Stanford (who had filmed at the Battle of Omdurman the year before) filmed in the Orange Free State with General Gatacre from November 1899, probably until January 1900. Hyman was a South African theatrical impresario who mostly sent films from Cape Colony. Rosenthal left Britain on the Avondale Castle on 1 December 1899, arriving mid-January, probably as a replacement for Benett- Stanford. He joined Buller's army in Natal before crossing over into Orange Free State to follow Roberts to Pretoria (where he was joined by Hyman). He returned in June 1900, being replaced by Sydney Goldman (none of whose films are known to survive).\n\niv) Hepworth & Co.\n\nCecil Hepworth's Hepworth & Co. did not send anyone to South Africa,\n\nand hence only covered events in Britain. Several of the films are\n\ncontained only within the newsfilm compilations THROUGH THREE REIGNS\n\n(GB 1922 pc. Hepworth) and ROYAL REMEMBRANCES (GB 1929 pc. Gaumont).\n\n(GORDON HIGHLANDERS LEAVE FOR THE BOER WAR)\n\npc. [unknown]\n\ndate: October 1899\n\n35mm bw st 62ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA procession of Gordon Highlanders, led by pipers, marches from left to right in front of the camera and before watching crowds. Small boys are brushed out of the way. Taken at Union Terrace, Aberdeen. Note: Possibly filmed by the Aberdeen-based film-makers Paul Robello and William Walker. A shorter version (46ft) is held under the title SCOTTISH TROOPS LEAVE FOR SOUTH AFRICA).\n\nGENERAL BULLER EMBARKING ON THE `DUNOTTAR CASTLE' AT SOUTHAMPTON\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 14 October 1899\n\n35mm bw st 48ft 1min viewing copy\n\nWatched by crowds, Sir Redvers Buller, Lady Buller, the Mayor of Southampton and others walk along the gangway leading to the ship towards the camera. He pauses to be introduced to one of the ship's officers before embarking. Fortuitously W.K-L. Dickson, war cameraman for the British Mutoscope and Biograph Company, can be seen (without camera) standing on the bottom left. Note: Buller was setting off to head the British armed forces in South Africa. W.K-L. Dickson travelled on the Dunottar Castle at the same time. Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5473: \"Shows the Castle Line Docks, crowded with troops, spectators and well-wishing friends, also the gangway leading to the ship, down which is seen approaching Sir Redvers Buller and staff accompanied by Mayor of Southampton, Lady Buller, and friends, who bid them a hearty farewell. Every personage portrayed in this subject is an absolute portrait. A splendid view of the General was also secured\".\n\nTHE `ROSLIN CASTLE' (TROOPSHIP) LEAVING FOR SOUTH AFRICA\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 20 October 1899\n\n35mm bw st 65ft 1min viewing copy\n\nSpectators on the quayside at Southampton wave farewell as the crowded troopship Roslin Castle moves away to the right and out of the picture, with large numbers of troops on board waving back. Note: A large number of troopships left Southampton for South Africa over 20/21 October. The Roslin Castle left bearing Major-General Hildyard and 2nd Brigade Staff, special service officers and the 2nd Battalion West Yorkshires. Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5476: \"The best of the series of the transports leaving Southampton for South Africa. The camera was so placed as to show a large portion of friends and spectators on the docks, who add to the action in the film by a vigorous waving of hats, handkerchiefs, umbrellas, &c., to the 1,700 troops who swarm the decks and rigging of the departing troopship, the full length of which is seen passing before our instrument. No up-to-date exhibition of animated pictures is complete without showing this subject, which is enthusiastically received by all audiences before whom it has been shown\".\n\nCOLDSTREAM GUARDS EMBARKING ON TROOPSHIP GASCON\n\npc. Fuerst Brothers\n\ndate: 21 October 1899\n\n35mm bw st 26ft 1min viewing copy\n\nRear view close shot of a line of troops in dark uniform (2nd Coldstreams) passing up the gangplank to board the Gascon troopship at Southampton, while a line of troops in khaki come down the gangplank on the right. A soldier in charge stares at the camera. Note: The 2nd Coldstreams left Southampton for South Africa on the Gascon on 21 October. A frame still under the descriptive title of `Embarkation of the 2nd Coldstreams' is reproduced in John Barnes, Filming the Boer War (1992), p. 146, among a series of photographs from films of the embarkation reproduced from a special supplement of To-Day (23 November 1899). The general descriptions of these closely match known titles taken by Fuerst Brothers. Fuerst took two films under this title, the first (the above) marked `close view', the second marked `Showing the Royal Engineers in the foreground'.\n\nREVIEW OF THE LIFE GUARDS BY HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 11 November 1899\n\n35mm bw st 118ft 2mins viewing copy\n\nQueen Victoria seated in her carriage with her back to the camera (on the left-hand side of the frame, barely visible), and surrounded by invited guests, acknowledges the salutes of the officers as the 1st and 2nd Life Guards (in khaki) march before her at Spital Barracks, Windsor. Note: The Review took place prior to the Life Guards' departure for South Africa. Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5483a: \"This is one of the most inspiring films, showing the 1st and 2nd Life Guards on Review before Her Majesty The Queen seated in a carriage surrounded by invited guests, before whom the troops are marching thirty-six abreast, clad in their khaki uniform. As each Company passes, the officers are seen saluting the Royal carriages. Photographed by Royal permission\".\n\nDISPERSING THE TROOPS AT WINDSOR AFTER PARADE\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 11 November 1899\n\n35mm bw st 49ft 1min viewing copy\n\nThe dispersal of the Companies following the review of the 1st and 2nd Life Guards by Queen Victoria at Spital Barracks (see above); the Companies, drawn up in single file, march towards the rear of the barracks before dispersal. Note: Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5486b: \"Showing each Company drawn up in single file marching towards the rear of the parade ground, after which they disperse, each going to their different quarters. A splendid ending to the above series. Photographed by Royal pemission\". There were six titles in the Warwick series `Mobilization of Troops in England', of which the two titles above formed a part.\n\nTHE FIFTH NORTHUMBERLAND FUSILIERS DIGGING ENTRENCHMENTS AT ORANGE RIVER, SOUTH AFRICA - THE PASSING OF THE ARMOURED TRAIN\n\nph. John Benett-Stanford\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 12 November 1899\n\n35mm bw st 35ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA large group of British soldiers digging entrenchments under the supervision of officers. A brief second shot shows an armoured train going past. Note: Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5507: \"This photograph gives a splendid idea of the rapidity with which our troops throw up entrenchments, showing hundreds digging and shovelling under the supervision of officers and engineers. The fact that many belonging to this regiment appear among the 600 troops missing from General Gatacre's Column after the Stormberg Reverse adds additional interest to this film, the last portion of which shows the passing of the Armoured Train, going in support of Colonel Gough's Column at the Battle of Belmont and Kaffir Kop. While the film is a comparatively short one, every inch of it is valuable owing to the interest at present connected with every portion of the life of our troops during the Campaign. Photographed November 12th, 1899, by Mr Bennett [sic] Stanford\".\n\nPANORAMIC VIEW OF FRERE CAMP TAKEN FROM THE FRONT OF AN ARMOURED TRAIN, NOVEMBER 29TH, 1899\n\nph. W.K-L. Dickson\n\ndate: 29 November 1899\n\npc. British Mutoscope and Biograph Company\n\n35mm bw st 32ft 1min viewing copy\n\n'Phantom ride' taken from a moving train (moving right to left) showing to the right-hand side the British encampment at Frere, with rows of white tents, soldiers staring at the train as it goes by, a large number of horses, further tents and some field artillery. The image is very unsteady. Note: Dickson's own account is as follows: \"In spite of the general activity we succeeded in getting the use of an engine and flat car, and in taking a Biograph panorama run of the camp. In this undertaking we were materially assisted by the courteous and capable stationmaster. The public must not too severely judge this picture, as the goods van, or flat car, lacked the best of springs, and consequently the scene might show considerable vibration\" (The Biograph in Battle, pp. 52-3).\n\nREPAIRING THE BROKEN BRIDGE AT FRERE\n\nph. W.K-L. Dickson\n\npc. British Mutoscope and Biograph Company\n\ndate: 29 November 1899\n\n35mm bw st 47ft 1min viewing copy\n\nBritish officers (Royal Engineers) supervising repair work on a bridge at Frere, spanning the Blaauw Krantz River, Natal. In detail: one end of a mangled metal bridge with black workers, white overseers, and some British troops (helmeted but not in full uniform). A team of blacks carries a long girder from right to left across the frame, raising it up a couple of times. Once they are past, the camera pans slightly to the right to show a large stone bridge-support and standing by a few British troops, one wearing a Red Cross armband. Camera pans further right to show more mangled metal. Note: Dickson's own account is as follows: \"We wake at dawn to the clash of shunting trains. Breakfast over, we toil at the unloading of our Cape cart and goods in order to take a view of the broken bridge, and the reconstruction of the same. Our Biograph is carried down to the stream facing the bridge, and I get a good view of the new foundation laid for the wooden trestles. The Kaffirs as help are simply invaluable, and they may be seen and heard everywhere as they cheerfully toil, chanting the while keeping time with their work. Every hand stopped work and gazed steadily at the camera while taking the first picture, thus depriving us of the necessary movement. After this we had of course to make another attempt\".\n\nARRIVAL OF WOUNDED AT HOSPITAL SHIP\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 75ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA succession of British soldiers being carried up a gang-plank by stretcher-bearers from the quayside to a hospital ship at Durban; walking casualties make their way up a different gang-plank. Note: Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5551b: \"A continuous line of sick and wounded being transported by stretcher-bearers on board the Hospital Ship at Durban; while those able to walk follow, supporting themselves on sticks, some with arms in a sling, others using crutches. This picture portrays one of the dark sides of war\".\n\nAMBULANCE CROSSING THE MODDER\n\nph. Walter Beevor (?)\n\npc. Paul's Animatograph Works\n\ndate: 6 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 74ft 1min viewing copy\n\nHauled by a long mule train a four-wheeled cart with three British\n\nsoldiers crosses the Modder river. Oxen harnessed to a covered ambulance with Red Cross markings drink from the river, then pull the ambulance (apparently carrying Boer wounded) across. Note: Paul catalogue entry: \"This beautiful picture has been one of the most appreciated of the War Films, forming in itself a grand and interesting picture, even apart from the fact that it includes a large ambulance wagon drawn by 14 oxen, containing 25 Boer wounded being taken to Cape Town\".\n\nRIFLE HILL SIGNAL STATION NEAR FRERE CAMP\n\nph. W.K-L. Dickson\n\npc. British Mutoscope and Biograph Company\n\ndate: 7 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 46ft 1min viewing copy\n\nTroops aiming rifles from a British trench on a high vantage point near Frere. An officer (Captain Bartram?) walks along behind them. A flag signaller gives the message, `Have your picket under arms and send out patrol. Kitchener December 7th'. Note: Dickson's own account is as follows: \"We again visited the outposts, and managed, not without extreme difficulty, to haul our machine, &c., to the top of Rifle Hill signal station, just in time to catch a message from Colonel Kitchener, which was flagged to picket No. 8, the operators kindly waiting until we got the machine in position before they sent the message. The men were watching the enemy below while the signalling was in progress, Captain Bartram being in command of signal and picket. This is a splendid scene, and one of which we are very proud, for we nearly killed ourselves and our horses in our endeavour to get planted in time. We could not have secured it but for the extreme courtesy of the officer. This is the message which was sent to O.C. No. 8 picket: `Have your picket under arms and send out patrol. Kitchener, December 7th'. It was sent in plain flag, Morse, not code, so that any one who knew Morse could read this message\".\n\nLANCERS CROSSING THE MODDER RIVER\n\nph. John Benett-Stanford\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 8 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 44ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA long column of Lancers fording a steep-banked river, filmed from one bank, riding towards and past the camera. Note: Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5523: \"The Lancers, under the Earl of Airlie, fording this famous river after the Enslin engagement, December 8th, 1899. The cavalry is seen descending the steep banks on the opposite side of the stream, and after crossing, gallop close by the camera\".\n\nTROOPS PASSING OVER MODDER RIVER BY TRAIN\n\nph. John Benett-Stanford\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 8 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 30ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA train, with locomotives and armoured cars at each end, passes over a temporary bridge erected over the Modder river; Seaforth Highlanders are riding in coal trucks and the train passes towards the camera. Note: Warwick catalogue no. 5525: \"After the blowing up of the bridge by the Boers, the Army Engineers constructed a temporary structure, over which is seen passing a train with engines and armoured cars at each end, while the Seaforth Highlanders which it is transporting are riding on coal trucks, all passing close to the camera\".\n\nBOYS OF H.M.S. `TERRIBLE' GETTING THEIR GUNS INTO POSITION\n\nph. W.K-L. Dickson\n\npc. British Mutoscope and Biograph Company\n\ndate: 12 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 48ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA long double line of British naval ratings hauling a 4.7\" naval gun across open country (from right to left) before Colenso. A second group hauling a second gun follows behind. Note: There are two illustrations in The War by Biograph (see Sources), only one of which matches this film, suggesting that Dickson took two scenes. There is no particular passage in The Biograph in Battle which describes the taking of this film. The date given is that prior to the opening of the British assault.\n\nNAVAL GUNS FIRING AT COLENSO\n\nph. W.K-L. Dickson\n\npc. British Mutoscope and Biograph Company\n\ndate: 14 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 35ft 1min viewing copy\n\nClose shot of a 4.7\" naval gun at Colenso with a group of British naval ratings standing around it. The gun fires and the men run up to reload, then begin to pull the gun forward. Note: Dickson's own account is as follows: \"We could only get one Biograph of all this, though magnificently effective, owing to the cloud of dust caused by the recoil and concussion. I was obliged to ignore the kindly advice to stay on the opposite hill and take it from there by the telephoto: but not being very sure of this new lens, I preferred to use my 8-inch Bausch and Lomb, and get within fifty feet instead of 1,500 yards or 2,500 yards. As soon, however, as we had taken the view, I had the machine dismantled and carried behind huge boulders for protection. Our horses, trembling and jumping at every shot, behaved splendidly, however, never moving from the spot, but scared out of their wits. My companions used cotton-wool in their ears to prevent the tremendous concussion, but as I wished to hear which way the shells were coming I preferred to drop my jaw at the word `Fire', a trick I learned at Sandy Hook, U.S., at the firing of the 10in., which answered the purpose very well\".\n\nTHE AUSTRALIAN MOUNTED RIFLES MARCHING THROUGH CAPE TOWN\n\nph. Edgar Hyman\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 22 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 90ft 1min viewing copy\n\nGround-level view of a column of Australian cavalry riding down Adderley Street, Cape Town, watched by enthusiastic crowds. The man in the foreground apparently directing the camera may be Edgar Hyman. Note: Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5526: \"A finer lot of troopers, in their picturesque uniforms and mounted on their splendid horses, can hardly be imagined that these, seen marching through Adderley Street, Cape Town, on their way to the front. This regiment has already distinguished itself in many a battle and skirmish with the Boers\".\n\nLORD ROBERTS LEAVING FOR SOUTH AFRICA\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 23 December 1899\n\n35mm bw st 48ft 1min viewing copy\n\nLord Roberts, preceded by Lady Roberts, walks up gangway with number of dignitaries onto deck of SS Dunottar Castle (filmed from on board the\n\nship). He pauses to acknowledge the cheers before proceeding to embark. Note: Lord Roberts left to take over the command of the British forces in South Africa from General Buller. Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5521: \"A splendid picture depicting the arrival of Lord Roberts on board the `Dunottar Castle', December 23rd, 1899, on his way to South Africa. He is preceded up the gangway by Lady Roberts, while scores of firends and officers accompany him on deck, where he is given a rousing reception. Beautifully sharp and clear. Every face a portrait\".\n\n(BOER WAR RECRUITMENT MARCH)\n\npc. Hepworth and Co. (?)\n\ndate: c.1900\n\n35mm bw st 51ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA contingent of British troops marching down a street towards the camera.\n\n(TRACTION ENGINE HAULING TIMBER)\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company (?)\n\ndate: c.1900\n\n35mm bw st 72ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA steam traction engine hauling timber in a dockyard, apparently in South Africa. A number of cyclists and troops and a donkey cart pass by. Note: This may be Warwick's TRANSPORTING SUPPLIES BY TRACTION ENGINES, catalogue no. 5541b: \"The heavy war stores, guns and amunitions are transported from the steam ship docks to the railway station by means of McKenzie Traction Engines. These powerful machines draw from 10 to 15 heavily laden trucks. The view is full of life and action, and is quite unique and interesting\".\n\n(BOER WAR: CROSSING A RIVER)\n\npc. Paul's Animatograph Works (?)\n\ndate: early 1900\n\n35mm bw st 50ft 1min viewing copy\n\nBritish troops in pith helmets, some on horseback and some leading horses, fording a river and climbing the bank; second view of the river showing horse carts and a long team of oxen pulling a wagon bearing British troops and possibly an artillery piece. Note: Possibly Robert Paul's ARTILLERY CROSSING A RIVER. Paul catalogue entry: \"A good scene on the Vaal River, showing naval guns and wagons being drawn over the rocky bed of the river by struggling teams of oxen. It includes two different aspects of a busy and lively scene\".\n\nA SKIRMISH WITH THE BOERS NEAR KIMBERLEY BY A TROOP OF CAVALRY SCOUTS ATTACHED TO GENERAL FRENCH'S COLUMN\n\nph. Joe Rosenthal\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: early 1900\n\n35mm bw st 150ft 2mins viewing copy\n\nA staged attack by British troops in South Africa. In three sections: mounted troops riding across open country towards the camera; the troops dismount and set up their Maxim guns; the troops fire from behind some low brushwood. Note: This is the only surviving example of a British military action being staged for the cameras in South Africa, the catalogue description implying that it was meant to be taken as the real thing. Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5545: \"One of the liveliest scenes yet photographed in three views. I. - The Scouts in pursuit of the Boers. II. - Bringing the Maxims into Action. III. - A Charge and general fusilade. These scenes portray one of the many Brushes with the Boers by a contingent of General French's Army during his march to relieve Kimberley. Several kopjes in the background. (Photographed by Mr. J. Rosenthal, of our War Staff). These pictures produce a stereoscopic effect, and the clear atmosphere gives it a tremendous depth, enabling one to see thousands of troops in the distance fighting at the base of a kopje, while the dust arising from the galloping cavalry lends further realism to this splendid subject\".\n\nTHE ARRIVAL AND RECEPTION OF LORD ROBERTS AT CAPETOWN\n\nph. Edgar Hyman\n\npc. Warwick Trading Company\n\ndate: 10 January 1900\n\n35mm bw st 109ft 1min viewing copy\n\nA guard of honour arrives; Roberts arrives and inspects them; he drives away in his carriage. Note: Warwick Trading Company catalogue no. 5540a: \"The first section shows the `Dunottar Castle' lying along side the dock at Cape Town, while the officers and troops who are to receive Lord Roberts, arrive and march past the camera. The second section shows the gangway from the ship, down which Lord Roberts is seen descending. He then inspects the troops drawn up along the docks, and finally steps into a carriage in company with other prominent officers. The portrait of Lord Roberts is a magnificent one, we being specially favoured with a prominent position to do full justice to the event. By kind permission of the Union Castle Steamship Company, Messrs. Donald Currie & Co., agents. (Photographed by Edgar M. Hyman of our War Staff)\".\n\n(EMBARKATION OF THE C.I.V.

Note: The title is that given in the ROYAL REMEMBRANCES compilation film. A shorter version (26ft) is held in the compilation film THROUGH THREE REIGNS under the title (DURING THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR, THE CITY IMPERIAL VOLUNTEERS LEFT LONDON AND TOOK SHIP FOR THE SCENE OF ACTION).\n\nBATTLE OF SPION KOP: AMBULANCE CORPS CROSSING THE TUGELA RIVER\n\nph. W.K-L. Dickson\n\npc.

There are three separate scenes on three films: [First scene] In the foreground four British soldiers positioned in a trench; in the middle ground a long line of British troops crossing the pontoon bridge, accompanying an ambulance wagon carrying a Red Cross flag; in the distance another ambulance with troops coming down a slope towards the pontoon bridge; and in the extreme distance a large number of wagons and troops taking part in the retreat. [Second scene] The same camera position, with the four men in the trench in the foreground, but only one ambulance wagon in view (having just crossed the pontoon bridge), a few men walking down the slope, and some wagons visible high up in the far distance. [Third scene] Slightly closer shot [using a telephoto lens] from same camera position (distant hills no longer in frame), with same four men in the trench in the foreground, and in the middle distance a Red Cross ambulance being pulled over the pontoon bridge by troops; it is then attached to a team of horses. There are a few men walking down the slope and a couple of men on horseback on the nearer side of the river. Note: This shows the British retreat following the disastrous assault on Spion Kop. The order in which the scenes were taken is not clear. Dickson wrote: \"We were not long in following with our Cape cart, and after several hours' severe work for horse and man succeeded in getting a good picture of the Ambulance Corps crossing the Tugela River over a hurriedly spanned pontoon bridge. In the immediate foreground may be seen trenches filled with our men to guard against any sudden attack should the wounded be fired on by the enemy. A little below the Tugela wends its way through great boulders and a rocky bed, over which our sick and wounded must be driven as they make their way down the opposite side across the pontoon bridge and up the embankment where we now are, the worse cases being carried by innumerable volunteer stretcher-bearers, mostly coolies. On the other side, as far as the eye can reach the Red Cross ambulances are seen waiting their turn to make their perilous descent, nearly all of them having been previously emptied of their worst cases of wounded for fear of an upset, the patients being carried over and replaced after arriving at the other side, when comparatively on safe ground. The picture has an additional value that in the background is part of the battlefield where Warren's men fought so gallantly as they advanced towards and up Spion Kop to the right\".\n\nCRONJE'S SURRENDER TO LORD ROBERTS\n\nph.

A large group of cavalry armed with rifles follows. Note: General Cronje surrendered to Lord Roberts at Paardeberg on 27 February 1900. The NFTVA film was previously called (BRINGING A CAPTURED BOER GENERAL ACROSS THE VELDT). Paul catalogue entry: \"This historical Film, which is the only one of the subject taken, shows Cronje in a cart after his defeat at Paardeberg, followed by an escort of CIV. As the cart passes the camera, Cronje is seen to look out in astonishment at it. The picture is most successful, considering the circumstances under which it was taken in the early morning\".\n\nTROOPS LEAVING PORT ELIZABETH JETTY\n\nph. Edgar Hyman (?)\n\npc.

Lord Kitchener is mounted on a White Charger (with Indian officer riding beside him), on the right of Lord Roberts, and Sir John Hill Johnes, V.C., on the left of the Commander-in-Chief.

A large flag is unfurled. Note: On 28 May 1900 at Bloemfontein General Pretyman named the Orange River Colony (formerly the Orange Free State) on behalf of the Queen. The ceremony took place at noon. Dickson's own acount is as follows: \"At noon Governor-General Prettyman [sic] and Staff, preceded by a mounted escort, approached the flag-staff, and as soon as the proclamation had been read in a loud, clear voice by that gentleman, Her Majesty's name for the new colony given, the flag was unfurled, cheer after cheer rending the air, while the troops presented arms. And so we have another good slice of mother earth in the Orange Valley River Colony added to our long list of possessions. Long live the Queen! It was a glorious event. Thanks to the Biograph, which faithfully recorded this magnificent scene, the people of the world who were not as fortunate as those present will see what it saw, and doubtless sing `God save the Queen'\".\n\nLORD ROBERTS HOISTING THE UNION JACK AT PRETORIA\n\nph.
