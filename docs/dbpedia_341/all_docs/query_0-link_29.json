Raised borders outline the shape of the cross. The plain reverse bears a central circle (with raised edge) to enclose the date of the act of gallantry. The suspension bar comprises a straight laurelled bar with integral 'V' lug; the plain reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with details of the recipient. The 1½-inch wide ribbon is dark blue. [Note: originally the ribbon was dark blue for Royal Navy recipients and crimson (described as 'red' in the Warrants) for the Army. After the formation of the Royal Air Force (1 April 1918) the crimson ribbon (sometimes described as 'claret', 'maroon' or 'dark red') was adopted for all recipients. When present, a straight laurelled Bar (in the same form as the suspension bar but without the 'V' lug) indicates a subsequent award.] This Victoria Cross is engraved on the reverse of the suspension bar: 'BOY FIRST CLASS J.T.CORNWELL. ROYAL NAVY'. The date of the action, '31.MAY 1916', is engraved on the reverse of the medal in the central circle.\n\nLabel\n\nVictoria Cross (with blue 'Naval' ribbon) awarded during the First World War to Boy, 1st Class John Travers Cornwell for gallantry displayed as a sight setter for the cew of the 5.5-inch gun on the forecastle of the light cruiser HMS Chester during the Battle of Jutland, 31 May 1916 After firing just one salvo the ship was badly damaged by German gunfire. The forecastle received a direct hit, killing or wounding every member of Cornwell's gun crew. Cornwell was hit in the chest by a shell fragment but he remained at his post, awaiting orders from the bridge (receiving instructions over a headset from the gunnery control officer) until HMS Chester was disengaged from the action and his wounds were treated. Two days after the battle, on 2 June 1916, Cornwell died in hospital aged only sixteen and was buried at Grimsby. When the full story of his last hours became known his body was exhumed and, in July 1916, re-buried with full naval honours at Manor Park Cemetery . The announcement of the posthumous award of the Victoria Cross to Jack Cornwell was made in the London Gazette of 16 September 1916.\n\nHistory note\n\n'Jack' Cornwell was born in east London on 8 January 1900; a keen Boy Scout, he longed to be a sailor, and joined the Royal Navy in 1915. After training in seamanship and gunnery he joined the light cruiser HMS Chester, as a Boy, 1st Class in 1916 and became the sight setter of the crew of the 5.5-inch gun on the forecastle. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his gallantry and steadfastness during the Battle of Jutland.\n\nEngraved on reverse of suspender bar\n\nBOY FIRST CLASS J.T.CORNWELL. / ROYAL NAVY\n\nEngraved on reverse of central boss\n\n31.MAY / 1916\n\nObject Details\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.

The most important of these was the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA), passed on 8 August 1914 ‘for securing public safety’.\n\nFirst World War\n\n8 Celebrity Air Aces Of The First World War\n\nAviation was one of the most romanticised elements of the First World War. 'Air aces' in particular achieved celebrity status both during and after the war and their photographs regularly appeared in newspapers. Of the eight aces listed here, seven were killed in action between 1916 and 1918 or died in flying accidents during or after the war.\n\nFirst World War\n\nWhizz Bangs And Wind-Ups: 10 Tommy Slang Terms\n\nDuring the First World War, British soldiers used language in inventive and often humorous ways.
