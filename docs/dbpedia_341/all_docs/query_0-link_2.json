        "meta_description": "Major Ralph Seton, a British soldier stationed in Cawnpore, India, during the Sepoy Uprising of 1857, is in love with Joan Strathallen, the daughter of one of his superior officers, Sir Strathallen. After distinguishing himself in battle, Seton receives the Victoria Cross, a prestigious medal of valor, but later is stripped of it for participating in a drunken debauch. Meanwhile, Azimoolah, an Indian rebel leader who wants to rid his country of the British, stages a revolt among the natives. Through blackmail, Azimoolah enlists the aid of Adala, a beautiful Indian princess, to preoccupy Seton while his rebel forces attack the British. Joan denounces Seton for his activities with the princess and is kidnapped by Seereek, Azimoolah's lustful henchman, who threatens to kill her unless her father's troops agree to withdraw from Northern India. With the aid of Sir Strathallen's troops, Major Seton defeats Azimoolah and his followers and regains both the Victoria Cross and Joan's love.",
