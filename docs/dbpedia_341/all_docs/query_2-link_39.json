        "text": "Have you ever watched a war movie and thought, “when are they going to mention Canada?” It’s rare that the great white north gets anything more than a nod in cinematic depictions of warfare, but these 7 movies break the mould and let Canada take centre stage.\n\nHyena Road (2015)\n\nSet in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, Hyena Road follows Canadian Forces snipers as they attempt to construct a road deep in the heart of Taliban territory.\n\nThe film explores the complex relationships between foreign soldiers and local civilians, while also depicting the moral grey area of modern combat.\n\nDirected by Paul Gross, Hyena Road received three Canadian Screen Awards for audio and visual effects.\n\nPasschendaele (2008)\n\nShot mainly in Calgary, Passchendaele depicts Sergeant Michael Dunne, of the 10th Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) fighting for both his country and his lover, during one of the most significant battles of the First World War.\n\nHis battalion, known as “The Fighting Tenth,” participated in every major battle of the First World War and set the record for the most individual decorations earned by a Canadian unit during a single battle.\n\nDirected by Paul Gross, Passchendaele received a National Arts Centre Award and multiple Genie Awards.\n\nThe Devil’s Brigade (1968)\n\nThe 1st Special Service Force, a joint American-Canadian commando unit, also known as The Devil’s Brigade, is tasked with penetrating a seemingly impregnable Nazi mountain stronghold: Monte la Difensa in Italy.\n\nThe film was co-written by Colonel George Walton, a member of the brigade.\n\nBattle of Britain (1969)\n\nBased on the book The Narrow Margin by Derek Wood and Derek Dempster, Battle of Britain is a fictional retelling of the historic military campaign.\n\nThe film was praised for its practical effects, specifically the model work used to create flying sequences.\n\nAlthough focusing mainly on British efforts, Canadians receive prominent play through the role of Canadian fighter pilot Colin Harvey.\n\nCaptains of the Clouds (1942)\n\nThe only film on our list to be shot during wartime, Captains of the Clouds aimed to show Americans, who had just recently entered the war, the contributions of the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the Canadian military as a whole.\n\nThe film even features Victoria Cross recipient and First World War air ace, William Avery “Billy” Bishop\n\nAttack on the Iron Coast (1967)\n\nFollowing the exploits of Canadian commando Major Jamie Wilson (Lloyd Bridges), Attack on the Iron Coast tells the story of soldiers on a mission of near-certain death to destroy a Nazi naval stronghold—the fictional, Axis held French port of Le Clare.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Attack on the Iron Coast premiered as a double bill with The Beatles’ animated film Yellow Submarine.\n\nBomb Girls (2012)\n\nTechnically not a movie, but a TV show with a two-season run and a feature-length series finale, Bomb Girls shows the perspective of wartime life back home.\n\nThis female-led drama follows four women breaking free of their home and social restrictions when they go to work in a Canadian munitions factory during the Second World War.\n\nOriginally aired on Global TV, Bomb Girls was syndicated internationally in the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Poland."
