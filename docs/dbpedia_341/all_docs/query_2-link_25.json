        "text": "Not too long ago I read William Goldman's Adventures of the Screen Trade, and one of the movies that Goldman had wrote the script for which I had never seen was A Bridge Too Far. Not only had I never seen it, I had never even really heard of it.\n\nFiled that away in the back of my brain, and then recently saw it pop up as available on Netflix so sat down to watch it this weekend.\n\nIn many ways I was totally blown away, I felt like there were various moments throughout the movie that were clearly inspirations for more modern day war movie classics like The Thin Red Line, Dunkirk, Inglorious Basterds, Fury, etc.\n\nThe scale of this movie is really incredible, as if Director Richard Attenborough conducted his own miniature war that he filmed. There's no slight of hand here. It's clear as day that those are real actors being airdropped, and all of the action and fighting scenes feel intense and real. I remember one of the complaints some people (not I) had about Dunkirk was that they didn't feel like the movie REALLY showed the scale of the battle. That is not an issue with A Bridge Too Far. Fury is often lauded as having some of the best action scenes featuring tank battles ever filmed, but I would put some of the tank fight scenes from A Bridge Too Far right up there with it.\n\nAnd holy moly, this cast is stacked. A funny aside, I was talking to my wife about this movie, and I said \"Name an actor from the 70s, any actor, and he'll probably be in this movie.\"\n\nShe thinks for a minute, can't think of any actors from the 70s, then says \"Burt Reynolds.\" I laugh, say that is a really good choice but she managed to pick the one major film star not in the picture.\n\nBut still, Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, James Caan, Elliot Gould, Robert Redford in a small but meaningful part. It just goes on and on.\n\nI think it's fair to say that all of the films strengths are also it's weaknesses. The film wants to be a big, sprawling epic that shows the whole scope of the operation Market Garden. In doing so, it becomes unwieldy, tedious at times and overly long. The film has a huge cast of Hollywood stars, and none of the characters ever fully coalescence in order to get everyone the appropriate screen time. Some, like Hackman and maybe even Caine, are criminally underused.\n\nAdditionally, Goldman's screenplay is really excellent. A lot of the problems of the movies confusing plot and runtime are probably partly to blame on the screenplay, but it is peppered with absolutely wonderful scenes and vignettes of these soldiers. The first that springs to mind is James Caan's character threatening to shoot the surgeon if he does not inspect a soldier Caan is convinced can be saved with medical intervention. Apparently Caan was given his choice of characters from the screenplay, and choose this part with less screen time than other parts simply because of this one scene. That's the kind of script this is, and it's got probably 6-7 of these types of scenes. Maybe they are not the most \"realistic,\" but they're pure hollywood movie making/storytelling in the best possible sense of heightened reality.\n\nSo the film obviously had mixed reactions when it came out, and it's certainly not flawless, but why has this film been all but forgotten? I again have to admit that until I had read Goldman's book, I had never even heard of this film. Somewhat shocking to me given the starpower on hand and even if the movie is not a flawless masterpiece, it is an incredible spectacle that when it works it really works.\n\nApparently it was the most expensive movie ever made when it was released. I think part of the critical reaction was also because the film really falls apart in the last 30 minutes of it's 180 minute runtime, just kind of meanders to the end and peters out. I had trouble staying engaged with it. I could see this being the lasting memory from people having seen it. I also think the film really could have used some simple cards or on screen text to help clarify things, at the end of the movie Sean Connery's character says his men have been fighting for 9 days and this was totally lost on me, I would have guessed 2-3. Again going back to Dunkirk, even with the time-jumping antics Nolan does a really good job of orienting you to WHEN you are in the battle. Days and nights just seem to fly by in A Bridge Too Far and it's not really clear.\n\nI searched through TrueFilm after watching to see if there's any discussion on it, and there has never even been a single post in TrueFilm about this movie! Truly a forgotten classic worthy of a place in the World War II movie pantheon, if as an engaging and entertaining romp if nothing else."
