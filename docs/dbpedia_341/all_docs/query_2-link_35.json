I noticed that he also wore spurs\n\nGTB\n\nYes, it does. But would an RMC officer, ostensibly just back from the front, be posted to a backwater station?\n\nI know the film has some incongruous parts, the officer being a Victoria Cross holder one of them, to my mind, considering that nothing shown points in that direction. So it might just be that the film's military advisor(s) did not give full merit to the insignia worn. I suppose the Director didn't really expect any nit-picking where badges and the like were concerned. But you cannot be faulted in comparing the cap badge to an RMC one.\n\nGTB\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by GTB\n\nCan anyone confirm the cap badge worn by the young officer (Major) played by Christopher Jones in the 1970 film \"Ryan's Daughter\"?\n\nIt resembles a Househod Cavalry badge although I expect it may be a fantasy item.

What cap badges were the ORs wearing?\n\nAttached Images\n\nLorry back.jpg (48.4 KB, 37 views)\n\n__________________\n\nOrationem pulchram non habens, scribo ista linea in lingua Latina"
