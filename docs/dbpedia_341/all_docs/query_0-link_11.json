        "text": "The Military Air-Scouts (Vitagraph, 1911)\n\nDirected by William Humphrey\n\nStarring Earle Williams and Edith Storey\n\nSo this is a curious one, not so much because of the plot (what little there is of it) but because of the timing.\n\nLieutenant Wentworth (Earle Williams) is in love with Marie Arthur (Edith Storey) and hopes to marry her. When war is declared between the United States of America and the United States of Europe, he accepts a dangerous air-scout commission. After successfully sinking the enemy’s fleet of battleships, his plane is shot down. The lieutenant, not badly hurt, returns home and finds Marie ready to marry him.\n\nNow, I’m reading a lot into the story that is never actually portrayed on the screen—especially when it comes to Marie and Wentworth’s motivation—but I think that’s the essence of the plot.\n\nNot dissimilar to The Victoria Cross, you might be saying, but whereas the Crimean War had already happened prior to The Victoria Cross’s release, not so for The Military Air-Scouts and the First World War. Air-Scouts, released in 1911, is set in the not-too-distant future of August 4th, 1914. For those playing along at home, it might interest you to know that Franz Ferdinand was assassinated on June 28th of that year.\n\nDid ancient aliens write this scenario or is it simply indicative of the feeling at the time that the Balkans were a powder keg and war was sooner or later inevitable?\n\nAlso interesting to note that the stunt pilot actually flying the plane is a young Henry “Hap” Arnold, who would later become both General of the Army and General of the Air Force in the Second World War—the only man to be a five-star general of two different military services.\n\nMy rating: This is a very, very slight film, but I like it purely for the miniatures in the naval battle scene.\n\nAvailable from Harpodeon.com\n\nJane’s Bashful Hero (Vitagraph, 1916)\n\nDirected by George D. Baker\n\nStarring Edith Storey\n\nI’ve said in the past that the release notices placed in trade magazines don’t always correspond in every detail to the film as it was actually released, but I don’t think any that I’ve worked on are quite so different as Jane’s Bashful Hero. First, let’s look at its synopsis in Moving Picture World:\n\nBashful Willie Wiggins courts Jane Brown, the village belle, but after nearly wearing out the sofa cannot find the courage to pop the question. Jane finally resorts to the old ruse of jealousy. That night the village folks of Mudville are scandalized to see Jane in the arms of a stranger silhouetted against the window shade. The whole town rises up in protest, and Willie, backed by the minister, demands an explanation of Jane. She guiltily denies the impeachment and the crowd, calmed by the dominie, disperse, but Willie camps on the doorstep to catch his “rival.” Jane during the night regrets the scandal her little trick caused and flings the dummy she used into the well. Willie sees this and is horrified, believing it is the body of his rival, whom Jane has murdered. Frantic with excitement, he arouses the whole village. The indignant mob rush to Jane’s home in their nighties and drag her forth dramatically. The sheriff goes down the well, and of course Jane has a good laugh on them all when the dummy is hauled up. Willie now realizes the depth of Jane’s love and pops the question right then and there\n\nThat’s almost but not entirely different from Paul West’s shooting scenario for Jane’s Bashful Hero. There’s enough similarity that I don’t think it’s describing an entirely different film, but only just.\n\nJane Brown (Edith Storey) is a rather homely young woman—looking rather disheveled with messy pigtails and missing a front tooth—and the townspeople regard Willie Wiggins (Donald MacBride) courting her as very much of a joke. Indeed, they gather round to point and laugh at them when they’re together, causing Jane to chase them off, swinging her broom like a sword.\n\nBut Willie is too bashful to propose. Conversely, Dutch Louie (Billy Bletcher), the town’s grocer, is anything but bashful. He’s courting her aggressively and would marry Jane that day if she would have him, but she won’t. She wants Willie.\n\nShe reads in the newspaper that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, so she plans a dinner and invites Willie over. The meal starts well, but Jane’s playing footsy embarrasses him to such a degree that he confuses the table cloth for his napkin, tucking it into his shirt; and when she begins stroking his hand, he abruptly stands up, pulling Jane’s dinner onto the floor. Mortified, Willie flees from the house.\n\nA gang of kids is forever pulling nasty practical jokes on Jane. She shoos them off when one of them dresses as a mustachioed home intruder. Leaving the mask behind, Jane gets an idea: maybe the way to spur on Willie is to make him jealous. With the mask and some old clothes from the attic, she builds a scarecrow rival, which both Willie and Louie see Jane petting and kissing in silhouette on the window shade that night.\n\nA detective from the big city arrives in town with a wanted poster for Banker Bill, the notorious and at large bank robber. It isn’t him, but he looks rather like Snub Pollard, with a large mustache as his defining characteristic—just like Jane’s scarecrow. Willie and Louie both see the poster and react accordingly: Louie reports to the constable (Edward Elkas) that Jane is harboring the fugitive, hoping to dispose of his rival, while Willie rushes to Jane to tell her that the coppers are out to arrest Banker Bill and she had better hide him.\n\nJane dumps the scarecrow down the well, which Louie spies from around the corner. The constable, looking to impress the detective, comes to arrest Jane when she won’t say where the fugitive is hiding. Willie, meanwhile, dumps a bottle of ink on his face and fashions it into a crude mustache, parading in front of the constable and pretending to be Banker Bill. The constable isn’t fooled. Louie tells them he’s really hiding down the well. They pull up the bucket, and with it, the scarecrow. In shock, Louie falls down the well himself, and Willie, just now discovering his initiative, finally proposes to Jane.\n\nSo, as I said, there are enough similar points in the Moving Picture World synopsis that I don’t think it’s summarizing a different film altogether, but the overall plot it describes is vastly different from the real Jane’s Bashful Hero.\n\nThe real Jane is a fun enough film, though. Very well edited, and as always, Storey is a remarkably fine actress.\n\nMy rating: I like it.\n\nAvailable from Harpodeon.com\n\nA Regiment of Two (Vitagraph, 1913)\n\nDirected by George D. Baker and Ralph Ince\n\nStarring Sidney Drew and Harry T. Morey\n\nWhat! A review! I thought this blog was dead!\n\nI mentioned, lo these many years ago, that I thought that the Sidney Drew short The Professor’s Romance had more than enough material and could really have stood being a two-reel production. Well, A Regiment of Two is a Drew two-reeler that I recently worked on and it really lacks the material for even one reel.\n\nTo ensure themselves a regular boys’ night out, Ira Wilton (Sidney Drew) and his son-in-law Harry Bennett (Harry T. Morey) have pretended they’ve joined the 13th regiment and, as military men, they’ve got to drill every Friday. In reality, they’re down at the stag night at the Tigers Club, dancing with Mademoiselle Zoric, “The French Top”. But that storyline is dropped almost before it starts.\n\nWe now join Conrad Meltzer (Charlie Edwards), the very German boyfriend of Lena (Josie Sadler), the Wiltons’ cook. I think they meant to get Kate Price for the Lena role. The part is right up her alley and Sadler even looks a lot like Price. Melzer is a plumber and happens to be on-hand with Lena in the kitchen when the water main springs a leak. Rather than fix it now, he picks up a convenient piece of kindling and jams it in the hole. “I put plug in der pipe und it lasts until tomorrow und I’ll fix it up goodt den!” he says to Lena.\n\n(That might be the first time I’ve ever seen “tomorrow” rendered as one word. It was usually hyphenated “to-morrow” well into the ‘30s.)\n\nLaura (Edith Storey), Ira’s daughter, is in on the ruse and helps to keep it up. She’s in love with Jack Brent (E.K. Lincoln), who really is a corporal in the 13th regiment. And I think they meant to get Wallace Reid for the role. It fits in with his characters at Vitagraph to a T and Lincoln even looks a bit like him. Anyway, Laura’s mother (Rose Tapley) favors Lord Dudley (Ralph Ince) and tries her best to marry the two, even though Dudley is simply impossible.\n\nWhile Ira and Harry are dancing the night away with Mademoiselle Zoric, Meltzer’s quick fix fails and the pipe positively erupts water, flooding the kitchen and adjoining dining room ankle-deep. Laura, Mrs. Wilton, and Mrs. Bennett (a young Anita Steward when she was still Anna Stewart) send Dudley into the fray. After his initial bumbling attempts with a pillow, he at last finds the wedge-shaped bit of kindling and shoves it back in.\n\nThat took the whole reel. How does it continue into the second? It doesn’t!\n\nJack receives a telegram telling him that the 13th is being mobilized to “suppress the recent outbreak” in Panama. Laura is worried about her beau’s safety, but Ira and Harry are elated. While they’re “mobilized”, they’ll be rusticating on a fishing boat out on the lake.\n\nThey’re resting at ease on the dock, a cold drink in their hands, when they read the news: “Thirteenth Regiment Completely Annihilated”. That puts them in a rather awkward situation. They dress up in bandages, an arm sling, and an eye patch and go home with rousing stories of their heroism and narrow escape ready on their lips.\n\nBut it turns out that the tales of the regiment’s demise were greatly exaggerated. Jack returns and Meltzer, too—injured, but not from the shooting—he’s got gout. Harry pulls Jack aside to tell him to backup their heroic claims and Ira slips a little cash into Melzer’s hand to convince him to do the same. And so Ira and Harry “earned for themselves everlasting fame as two of the bravest warriors of the campaign”.\n\nSo, the two halves of this short have precious little to do with one another. Lord Dudley even disappears after the first reel ends. There was story enough in Ira and Harry’s pretended enlistment in the second reel, but the burst pipe plot of the first is a single joke stretched very, very thin. Sidney Drew is always delightful, and he wears outrageous false mutton chops here, and it’s a pleasure to see Edith Storey in anything, although she has little enough to do in this film.\n\nMy rating: Meh.\n\nAvailable from Harpodeon.com\n\nEnchanting\n\nPart Six\n\nI’ve seriously looked into resurrecting the Super 8mm distribution side of the business, because I do love film more than you can imagine. Fifty foot digests (let’s say three minutes and a half minutes), color, sound. On Super 8, those digests would cost a minimum $100 to break even. I am not making a penny— bare minimum. There is a single lab — a single lab — in Germany still making prints from Super 8 negatives. They could name their price, but they’re nice and are being realistic. I might could just about swing black and white silent prints for $40. That’s shooting on expired stock that might not hold out. And, of course, doing all the processing myself. Film is expensive, yo. Back when I used to do B&W digests for $50 and people complained that they could get so much more for so much less in ‘70s — yeah. Yeah, you could. The days of cheap film are over, never to return.\n\nOne thing I should have said, lo these many years ago when I first reviewed A Florida Enchantment, was how it differed from the novel. I’m borrowing liberally from my post on silentphotoplay.com without shame.\n\nThe film largely follows the book faithfully, down to some of the male and female divides shown already seeming a bit old-fashioned for 1914. It does make some very notable changes.\n\nMore than twenty years had passed since the book was published, and by that point the war was nearly fifty years in the past. It wasn’t as relevant to the film as it was to the book, so all mentions of it or of slavery are dropped. Major Thornton, for example, was a Confederate officer in the novel and Captain Oglethrope was a 1790s slave trader and his encounter with Quasi is much less friendly than the story the film relates. Dropping all of that doesn’t affect the plot and was the right thing to do. Bowdlerizing the Quasi story does leave out an important element, that the magic tree was burned with the village and the four seeds enclosed are the last.\n\nA big difference, and one that explains a lot of the gaps in the film’s logic, is that in the novel, Fred actually is cheating on Lillian with Stella Lovejoy. Lillian and Bessie catch them, much is made over the difference infidelity makes when the perpetrator is a man versus a woman. That is a large part of the reason why Lillian swallowed the first seed.\n\nIf you’ve read much Archibald Clavering Gunter, you know he’s not really a comic author. You might think so at first blush: he’s got a light tone, he’s satirical, he’s fond of complements that are dripping with sarcasm, but for all that, he treats his subject matter fairly seriously. The difference from the film to the novel that turns everything on its head is that it isn’t a dream. That’s where the four seeds element comes in that the film sets up but then abandons. Lillian takes the first, she gives Jane the second, and then Fred takes the third. And I don’t know why screenwriter Marguerite Bertsch didn’t change it to three but the film is done after that. In the novel, Lawrence dreams of what would happen if the public knew about the last seed. He imagines the newspaper ad — millions offered—richest widow in New York in negotiations—the queen who wants to be a king — etc. Frederica is miserable living as woman and is going broke because no one will trust a “doctress’s” care. While Lawrence and Bessie are boarding the ship on their honeymoon, Frederica finally convinces Lawrence to give up the seed by asking what would happen if Bessie should ever stumble onto it. At that, the doctress immediately changes back to a doctor as the tugboats pull the ship off the shore.\n\nThe tagline of A Florida Enchantment, the film, is “The Funny Phantasy”, but the book’s not so fantastic. It’s really trying to examine the different ways society treats the sexes and the different reactions society has to one sex behaving or presenting as another. Namely, that gay women are disapproved of but accepted, while gay me are condemned, and Gunter is trying to point out the hypocrisy in that. The film does that too, of course, but it muddles it a bit in trying to make it more of a comedy than it wants to be. The book is satyric but not really a comic.\n\nThat the film was really only funny in its first half was really the public’s response to it, too. One contemporary review — I think it was the Variety one — thought the film was only funny up to Lillian’s transformation and then the comedy all seemed forced onto the plot.\n\nThe changes to the film’s plot probably came from the earlier Broadway stage adaptation. In terms of page count, A Florida Enchantment isn’t a long book, but it’s awfully involved with the setting changes from New York to Florida and back constantly. Simplifying things to make them easier to stage with only one New York act makes sense. And it didn’t help that Gunter’s hypocrisy was the accepted view at the time and audience wouldn’t have liked it. We can’t know, though, what the play is like because it’s presumed lost.\n\nThere’s been some question over the years about what exactly Lillian/Lawrence’s relationship with Bessie is supposed to represent. Whether its what it looks like today — a look at someone who’s transgender seeking a straight partnership—or if, trying to look at it through what may be Gunter’s lens — the gender-bending is more of a code meant to show discovering one’s lesbianism and marrying another woman. There are arguments to be made for either position, but speaking of coding, the names Lawrence and Clarence were seen as extremely gay in that era. Think Bruce in the 1980s. Calling the character Lawrence was certainly not unintentional.\n\nAvailable from Harpodeon.com\n\nBehind the Screen (Lone Star, 1916)\n\nDirected by Charles Chaplin\n\nStarring Charles Chaplin\n\nThere are LGBT silent films, actually more than you’d imagine. The one I’m talking about today is a Charlie Chaplin two-reeler, Behind the Screen. I sourced it from three prints: primarily from a 35mm nitrate print I got from Italy, a 16mm positive that nearly every copy comes from today (I only needed the last shot from that), and an 8mm positive than had rather attractive titles (I needed those as none of the 35mm titles were in English and the 16mm are horrible replacements. I don’t think they’re original, but they’re original-ish, and look a lot better than the boring old actually original ones.)\n\nBehind the Screen is interesting because the stage boss doesn’t need any more hands and Edna Purviance wants to break into pictures, so she disguises herself as a man and takes a scab job when the others strike. Only Chaplin knows she’s a girl and much comedy ensues when the boss sees Chaplin kissing the scab.\n\nThis is the second LGBT Chaplin film. The other is the one-reeler The Masqueraders, also called (and I know it more as) A Woman, which isn’t… really all that LGBT at all. No more than any film where a man is confused for a woman. Behind the Screen, now, has real LGBT themes.\n\nNow I’ve had sickness and illness and illness and sickness. Left kidney failure and double pneumonia. All right now, mostly — just a broken rib from coughing — but I have fallen behind in my projects. I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I were healthy.\n\nYou know, almost all summer and autumn, it’s poured down rain on the weekends. Comes the very last day the train is scheduled to run before shutting down for the winter. It’s beautiful, not a cloud in the sky, and for late October not too cold. You could not ask for better filming conditions. Head up to Phillips… and the train broke down before I got there. No more rides until next year. Oh well.\n\nI shot the Chester Greenwood parade on 35mm with my silent-era camera. Greenwood, who you may or may not know, was the inventor of earmuffs (along with a host of other things, but earmuffs are all he’s known for) and a Farmington native. I shot 100 feet of film, which works out to approximately a minute and forty seconds. I figure film development and video transfer of the negative will cost about $150. To make a print of the negative that I can actually project will be around $100 more. And that isn’t including title cards, which will have to be shot separately. (I will develop those myself, though, using the same process that I’ve always used to develop titles — namely, a high-contrast stock pushed two stops and developed in high-contrast D-19 to provide an almost literally black and white image with no shades of gray at all.) It’s all so very expensive. The short I shot for the last Florida Enchantment DVD ten years ago was nearly three times as long and, all told, cost a bit under $400. In future, I may have to go with 16mm. I don’t want to, though — I love 35mm, and it has the authenticity I crave.\n\nI think it’s true that I’ve never shot on video — not since the early ‘90s at any rate. Whether 8mm, 16mm, or 35mm, I do prefer film. Plus, the expense keeps you rather mindful of wasting time. Take a vacation home movie. On video, you can drag it out for hours and hours and nobody in the world wants to watch that. Let’s say I’m shooting on Super 8mm: unless the trip is rather short or boring and I can do with less, I tend to take 34 minutes’ worth of film — that is, ten cartridges. I tend to edit it down to maybe 25 minutes afterwards, and that climbs back up to 30 minutes after I shot and insert the titles.\n\nSame goes for stills, really. Unless it’s very, very dull and mundane, I shoot on film. Typically with one of my half-frame cameras, so a 36 exposure roll of film turns into 72 exposures — more if you load it in darkroom and needn’t waste the first few inches. (Half-frame, or four-perf, film is exactly the same as motion picture film. Full-frame, or eight-perf, is what most still cameras take.) I like film. What can I hold with digital? Nothin’, that’s what. Any photolab can handle half-frame pictures just fine, but I always develop and print my own stills.\n\nI said before that the last seizure I had caused a bit of damage. My bed is repaired and now my clock is at what I consider the best clockmaker in New England. It’s a Gustav Becker clock that I love dearly. I do like good furnishings. If a piece has stood the test of time for 150 or 200 years, then it’s a good piece. It won’t fall apart on me in the coming decades. Wheat from the chaff, you know. It will be a month or more before he’s finished overhauling my clock. Was I talking about a film? I find Chaplin rather… repetitive isn’t the right word, but samey? I find his jokes all rather samey. There are so many good comedians beyond the canonical ones, but sticking strictly to them, I rather like Lloyd more. But that may just be my general aversion to slapstick. That scene with Charlie kissing the “stagehand”? Two or three minutes out of a thirty minute film.\n\nMy rating: Meh."
