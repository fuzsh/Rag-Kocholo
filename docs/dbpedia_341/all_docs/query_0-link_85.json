        "text": "A World War One soldier who was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) in an outstanding act of bravery has been commemorated 100 years after the event.\n\nPrivate George William Chafer, who was born in Bradford, delivered a message under bombardment after the original messenger was knocked unconscious.\n\nThe VC is the highest military decoration and awarded for valour in the face of the enemy.\n\nA commemorative paving stone has been laid in the city's Norfolk Gardens.\n\nLive updates on this story and others from across West Yorkshire\n\n\"For conspicuous bravery during a very heavy hostile bombardment and attack on our trenches, a man carrying an important written message to his company commander was half buried and rendered unconscious by a shell.\n\n\"Private Chafer, at once grasping the situation, on his own initiative, took the message from the man's pocket, and, although severely wounded in three places, ran along the ruined parapet under heavy shell and machine gun fire, and just succeeded in delivering it before he collapsed from the effects of his wounds.\n\n\"He displayed great initiative and a splendid devotion to duty at a critical moment.\""
