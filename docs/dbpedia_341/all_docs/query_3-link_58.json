        "text": "The year is 1916. As Chet’s parents look for work in California, the 10-year-old lives with his Uncle Jerry in Elm Hills, New Jersey. He enjoys working with his uncle in the Elm Hill diner and is happy when three local boys invite him for a swim at the creek. While they’re swimming, the boys play a trick and make Chet think he’s seen a shark. When he realizes he was pranked, Chet feels angry and leaves.\n\nUncle Jerry says the boys were just trying to make him feel like part of the gang. Chet has moved around a lot with his parents, so he hasn’t stayed in one place long enough to make real friends. Uncle Jerry urges him to play along, so Chet decides to pull a prank of his own. He covers himself in ketchup and jumps out at the boys when they arrive at the creek. He wants them to believe the fabled creek monster attacked him. They’re scared when they think he’s been hurt, but fear turns to anger when they learn it was a joke.\n\nLater, Chet goes to the creek alone to swim. He’s shocked to find himself in the water with a real shark. He escapes without major injuries, but no one believes his story when he runs for help. He finally turns to an old sea captain most people think is crazy. The captain once told Chet and the boys he was bitten by a shark.\n\nChet and the captain race to the creek where Chet’s friends are now swimming. He yells at them to get out of the water, but they think he’s playing another prank. Suddenly, they see the fin. Two manage to get out of the water. Chet jumps in to save the third. The third boy escapes, but Chet is bitten badly before the captain shoots the shark.\n\nThe news later reports that two other people were killed by the same shark further down the creek. The shark had likely been pulled from the Atlantic by strong currents. Chet’s friends visit as he recovers in the hospital. Uncle Jerry says he’ll try to get Chet’s parents to stay and work with him at the restaurant so they don’t have to keep wandering in search of work. Chet is excited about the prospect of staying in Elm Hills. He also realizes this experience has created a special bond between him and his new friends."
