        "text": "Hi, I don't know if this has already been discussed on the forum but it should make for an interesting debate.\n\nI hope I haven't broken any rules here, I just cut and pasted from the BBC website.\n\nThe wrong soldiers were awarded Victoria Cross medals after the British Army's battle with the Zulus at Rorke's Drift, while the true heroes went unrecognised, a new BBC documentary will claim this week.\n\nIn stark contrast to the film Zulu, in which Lt John Chard and Lt Gonville Bromhead, the commanding officers of the Rorke's Drift outpost, are portrayed as heroes, the BBC programme depicts them as dithering and \"hopeless\".\n\nThe documentary also claims that the pair sought to flee during the battle in 1879, which has become renowned as one of the Army's most inspiring actions.\n\nIt claims that the real hero of the action was James Dalton, the acting assistant commissary in the Army's supplies section. He is depicted in Zulu as a wimpish character.\n\nThe documentary, however, shows Dalton as leading the defence when the British garrison of 140 men in the South African bush comes under repeated attacks from the 3,000-strong Zulu army.\n\nRorke's Drift is the most famous action in the Zulu War, which began on January 11, 1879 when the Army, commanded by Lord Chelmsford, invaded the Zulu kingdom in an attempt to extend British control in South Africa.\n\nEleven days later, the British suffered a disastrous defeat at Isandlwana, where 1,350 soldiers died, after under-estimating the Zulus' fighting capabilities.\n\nHowever, British honour was retrieved the same day by the valiant defence of Rorke's Drift, 10 miles from Isandlwana. Eleven VCs medals were awarded in recognition of the men's bravery - the most gained in a single action.\n\nThe BBC's claims that some of the medals were undeserved has prompted an angry reaction from historians and enthusiasts for the Zulu campaign. They described the BBC's conclusions as \"rubbish\" and insisted that the medals given to Lt Chard and Lt Bromhead were justified.\n\nSaul David, a historian who acted as a consultant to the makers of the BBC documentary, insisted, however, that the trumpeting of the two senior officers' alleged achievements had been a deliberate ploy to mask the defeat at Isandlwana.\n\n\"Few remember that the battle of Rorke's Drift was fought on the same day that the British Army suffered its most humiliating defeat at nearby Isandlwana,\" he said. \"It suited those responsible for the disaster to exaggerate the importance of Rorke's Drift in the hope of reducing the impact of Isandlwana. The true story of the day is one of unprovoked slaughter, heroes ignored and the guilty protected.\"\n\nDr David cites documents from the time that describe the two commanding officers in less than flattering terms. He said: \"Many of their fellow officers were amazed that they were recommended for VCs.\n\n\"One senior officer wrote: 'Bromhead is a great favourite in his regiment and a capital fellow at everything except soldiering . . . He had to be reported confidentially as hopeless.' Another described Lt Chard as 'a most useless officer fit for nothing'.\"\n\nDr David said that Dalton, who was eventually awarded a VC after intensive lobbying in the press, had been overlooked initially because, as a former non-commissioned officer, he came from the \"wrong background\". At least two other soldiers, Commissary Walter Dunn, and Colour Sgt Frank Bourne, had also deserved the VC for their bravery, he said, but had not received the honour.\n\nFurthermore, Dr David claims that the two scouts, Lt Teignmouth Coghill and Lt Nevill Melvill of the 24th Regiment of Foot, who were honoured with posthumous VCs after they were killed trying to save Queen Victoria's colours at Isandlwana, were not heroic, but were in the process of \"bolting\" from the scene.\n\nHe said: \"Did they deserve the VCs? They were, after all, simply fleeing the site of the disaster. Some have even suggested that they took the colours with them as an excuse.\"\n\nDr David quotes Sir Garnet Wolseley, who succeeded Lord Chelmsford as the Army's General Officer Commanding in South Africa, as saying: \"It is monstrous making heroes of those who saved or attempted to save their lives by bolting.\"\n\nBrian Best, the secretary of the Victoria Cross Society, criticised the suggestion that the men should not have received their medals. \"Even if there were truth in the view that by today's standards some of the VCs may not have been awarded, there is no doubt that these men were brave and deserved to be honoured,\" he said. 'It's stupid to say they are undeserving of the VC.\"\n\nAlan Critchley, who has studied the conflict since 1969 and runs a website devoted to the history of Rorke's Drift, also described the BBC's argument as \"rubbish\".\n\nHe said: \"It's all sour grapes. The BBC are trying to be controversial and the truth is there is some controversy surrounding the event, but the BBC have pandered to people who resented the fact that these soldiers won VCs.\n\n\"It's nonsense to say that they tried to flee or that they were not heroic. Bromhead was almost completely deaf, so many people misunderstood that for stupidity. He wasn't stupid. The facts speak for themselves. What those soldiers did was magnificent.\"\n\nThe BBC film reserves the most scathing criticism for Lord Chelmsford. He is depicted as lying and blaming others for his own error in under-estimating the Zulus, and as being ultimately responsible for the deaths of the 1,350 British soldiers.\n\nAt the time, Lord Chelmsford blamed the defeat at Isandlwana on Col Durnford, who died in the battle, claiming that Durnford had disobeyed orders to defend the camp.\n\nDr David said that this was wrong. \"The truth is that no orders were ever given to Durnford to take command. The actual order was later found on the battlefield, but suppressed for a number of years,\" he said.\n\n\"Chelmsford used Rorke's Drift against his critics. Though undeniably heroic, the importance of the defence of Rorke's Drift was grossly exaggerated by both the generals and politicians to diminish the impact of Isandlwana.\"\n\nZulu: The True Story will be broadcast on BBC2 on Friday at 9pm.\n\nIt's the only reference I can find regarding Dalton Explaining why they should stay. Hook claimes they had loaded two wagons. Anyone know what with?\n\nExtract form Henry Hooks account.\n\n\"Everything was perfectly quiet at Rorke's Drift after the column had left, and every officer and man was going about his business as usual. Not a soul suspected that only a dozen miles away the very men that we had said 'Goodbye', and 'Good luck' to were either dead or standing back-to-back in a last fierce fight with the Zulus. Our garrison consisted of B Company of the 2/24th under Lieutenant Bromhead, and details which brought the total number of us up to 139. Besides these, we had about 300 men of the Natal Native Contingent; but they didn't count, as they bolted in a body when the fight began. We were all knocking about, and I was making tea for the sick, as I was hospital cook at the time.\n\nSuddenly there was a commotion in the camp, and we saw two men galloping towards us from the other side of the river, which was Zululand. Lieutenant Chard of the Engineers was protecting the ponts over the river and, as senior officer, was in command at the drift. The ponts were very simple affairs, one of them being supported on big barrels, and the other on boats. Lieutenant Bromhead was in the camp itself. The horsemen shouted and were brought across the river, and then we knew what had happened to our comrades. They had been butchered to a man. That was awful enough, but worse was to follow, for we were told that the Zulus were coming straight on from Isandhlwana to attack us. At the same time a note was received by Lieutenant Bromhead from the Column to say that the enemy was coming on, and that the post was to be held at all costs.\n\nFor some little time we were all stunned, then everything changed from perfect quietness to intense excitement and energy. There was a general feeling that the only safe thing was to retire and try and join the troops at Helpmakaar. The horsemen had said that the Zulus would be up in two or three minutes; but luckily for us they did not show themselves for more than an hour. Lieutenant Chard rushed up from the river, about a quarter of a mile away, and saw Lieutenant Bromhead. Orders were given to strike the camp and make ready to go, and we actually loaded up two wagons. Then Mr Dalton, of the Commissariat Department, came up and said that if we left the drift every man was certain to be killed. He had formerly been a sergeant major in a line regiment and was one of the bravest men that ever lived. Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead held a consultation, short and earnest, and orders were given that we were to get the hospital and storehouse ready for defence, and that we were never to say die or surrender.\""
