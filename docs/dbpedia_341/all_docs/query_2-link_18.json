        "text": "Saturday\n\nMen of Valour: Heroes of\n\nthe Victoria Cross\n\nHistory, 7 p.m. In recognition of Remembrance Day, History has a rebroadcast of the excellent documentary Men of Valour: Heroes of the Victoria Cross. The stirring doc profiles six of Canada's Victoria Cross recipients from both the First and Second World Wars. It also includes an interview with Ernest \"Smokey\" Smith, the last surviving Canadian Victoria Cross recipient.\n\nHChris Rock: Bigger and Blacker\n\nComedy, 9 p.m. On stage, Chris Rock paces like a panther. It's fitting somehow, given his propensity to deliver killer lines and always go for the jugular in his choice of topics. In this performance taped at the Apollo Theatre in New York City in 1999, Rock is at his brightest and baddest, too. He dishes out keen observations on American politics, AIDS, relationships, moms who are out trolling at bars on weekdays, white folks (aka \"crackers\") and homosexuality. Whatever topic he tackles he puts race in the forefront and handles it deftly and with a big dose of smarts. His potty mouth might bother some and this program is definitely not family viewing. (M.S.)\n\nSunday\n\nCelebrity Who Wants to\n\nbe a Millionaire\n\nABC, CTV, 9 p.m. Many were surprised when this game show decided to do a celebrity edition. Mostly, they were shocked at how smart some of the celebrities actually were, especially Drew Carey and David Duchovny, who were the big money winners. A whole new crop of talent shows up for this second version. They include: model Tyra Banks, talk show host Joy Behar, musician Sean 'Puffy' Combs, actress Vivica A. Fox, actors Charlie Sheen and Alec Baldwin and comedians Jon Stewart and Norm Macdonald. Each celeb, of course, is actually playing for a charity of their choice. From our perspective, the smart money is on Macdonald. For one thing, he's the only Canadian in the lineup; for another, although his main shtick is playing dumb (as evidenced on his weekly sitcom Norm), he's actually a very smart guy.\n\nThe Passionate Eye:\n\nIn the Shadow of a Saint\n\nNewsworld, 10 p.m. Airing for the first time ever on television is the acclaimed film In The Shadow of a Saint. The documentary follows the saga of Toronto writer Ken Wiwa, who returned to Nigeria last year to arrange a proper burial for his father, Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed by the Nigerian government in 1995 for being a political activist. Things get particularly interesting upon his arrival in Nigeria: The people there expect the son to become a freedom fighter -- like his father, and demand that his funeral be a huge spectacle, with thousands of mourners. Told in the first person by the junior Wiwa, the documentary is fascinating on two levels -- as an example of father-and-son relations, and by providing insight into those who value personal freedom above all else.\n\nMONday\n\nA Touch of Frost\n\nTVO, 9 p.m. For discerning mystery fans on a slow Monday night, there's an excellent two-part A Touch of Frost. In Paying the Price, intrepid Detective William \"Jack\" Frost (David Jason) is presented with a kidnapping case at the same time he's left homeless after a house fire. With no options left to him, Frost moves into the home of the kidnap victim's sister, where they commiserate during a long vigil while waiting to hear from the kidnappers. There's less action in this episode than previous Frost outings, but there's plenty of delicious and nasty twists along the way.\n\nTuesday\n\nThe Itch\n\nComedy, 9 p.m. The world of showbiz reportage is the focus of the new parody series The Itch, debuting tonight. It is produced by Salter Street Films, the same fine people who make This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Made in Canada. Jessica Holmes and Jason Jones play a Canadian version of two fawning ET-type TV\n\npersonalities. Their job is to dish out entertainment news and gossip, all pre-packaged in nice short news bites. As with 22 Minutes, virtually all the reports are, of course, entirely fictional. It's a light, fluffy half-hour and quite biting, especially the segment entitled Celebrity Drunk Driving. The real find here is the multi- talented Holmes, who also plays several other strange characters (her portrayal of trashy European fashion reporter Jean Ennui is particularly on-the-money).\n\nWednesday\n\nThe Storm of the Century\n\nTLC, 10 p.m. Moviegoers were recently enthralled by the feature film The Perfect Storm (which comes out on video this week and is reviewed on Page 11). This gripping documentary, however, tells the true story. It's about a weather catastrophe that occurred in October, 1991, in which three massive storm systems collided over New England. The result was a colossal and deadly storm that caused multiple deaths and property destruction along the Eastern Seaboard. Although the special effects in the movie were authentic, the footage shown in this special -- of decimated beaches and flattened homes -- is even more terrifying.\n\nThursday\n\nCops: Top 15 Moments of All Time\n\nFox, Citytv, 8 p.m. Okay, I totally admit that Cops is an acquired taste. Now in its ninth season, the cinema verit√© series -- which follows real police officers as they patrol the streets in various U.S. cities -- can be a bit brutal at times, and isn't recommended for all viewers (especially younger ones). At the same time, it's the type of TV that is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. Tonight, the series has a compilation episode of their most memorable arrests. It's not especially pleasant viewing, especially in one segment when the police pull over a woman for drunk driving, and she bursts into tears. One thing I've always wondered: Would the police officers involved be half as courteous if they weren't being filmed for national television?\n\nFriday\n\nTattoo: Beauty, Art and Pain\n\nDiscovery, 9 p.m. Although it's one of the oldest forms of body adornment on earth, tattoos are a particularly hot topic these days among young people. This doc spans the earth -- from ancient Japanese tattoo parlours to the laidback parlours in California. There are also several interviews with people who've undergone the experience. Cleverly, the filmmakers focus on two women: One is considering a tattoo, while the other is undergoing the excruciating process of getting one removed. This documentary should be required viewing for anybody ever considering getting a tattoo -- odds are they'll change their minds. GTV"
