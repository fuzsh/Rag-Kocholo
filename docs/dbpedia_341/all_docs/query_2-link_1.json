        "text": "On 10 June, Violette and a resistance leader, Jacques Dufour known as 'Anastasie', were intercepted by German soldiers at a roadblock. A gunfight ensued, Violette was taken prisoner and 'Anastasie' escaped. Violette was interrogated and tortured by her captors and was imprisoned in Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany, where she was executed in early 1945. She was awarded a posthumous George Cross, which was presented to her daughter Tania after the war. Violette Szabo was portrayed by British actress Virginia McKenna in Carve Her Name with Pride. Although McKenna did not resemble the petite, dark-haired Szabo, she later said 'the more I spoke her words and hopefully felt some of her feelings the more I seemed to identify with her'. The actress has also taken part in commemorative events in memory of Violette. The movie was based on the book of the same name by R J Minney and, apart from a few changes, is considered to be a faithful portrayal of Violette Szabo's wartime heroism.\n\nWith the final tests complete and the bomber crews ready, the raid took place on the night of 16/17 May 1943. Flying in modified Lancaster bombers, the men took off from RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire in several waves. Gibson led the first in against the Möhne dam and was the first to attack it. All three dams were bombed but only the Möhne and the Eder were breached. An estimated 1,300 people were killed in the resulting flooding, bridges and buildings were destroyed and production in the area was brought to a standstill. It was also a propaganda victory for the British. But the costs were high. Eight aircraft were lost, 53 men were killed and three were taken prisoner.\n\nOn 28 May 1943, Gibson was awarded a VC for his bravery and leadership during the 'Dambusters Raid'. The official citation noted the risks he took after dropping his bomb, twice drawing anti-aircraft fire onto himself and away from the other attacking aircraft. Gibson was killed in September 1944 when his aircraft crashed over the Netherlands during a bombing mission. The film was based on Gibson's account of the raid, detailed in his 1944 book Enemy Coast Ahead, as well as The Dam Busters (1951) by Paul Brickhill. The screenplay was written by the well-known First World War playwright and soldier, R C Sherriff, author of Journey's End. Gibson was played by actor and former Second World War soldier Richard Todd and Barnes Wallis by British actor Michael Redgrave. In the closing scenes, Wallis and Gibson reflect on the raid and its human cost in terms of the German and British lives that were lost. The film was a huge success in Britain when it opened and has endured as one of the most popular war movies of the twentieth century.\n\nWhen Allied forces entered Germany, Ravensbrück's camp commandant, Fritz Suhren, wanted to escape. Believing Odette to be related to Churchill, he took her with him. But when they met American forces on 3 May 1945, Odette told the Americans to take Suhren prisoner. He was later hanged for war crimes. Soon afterwards, Odette returned home to England and her family. In 1946, she was awarded a George Cross for her protection of others. Odette became a national heroine. The movie about her was based on Jerrard Tickell's book Odette: The Story of a British Agent. She was played by Anna Neagle, Peter Churchill by Trevor Howard and Maurice Buckmaster appeared as himself. Odette was a technical advisor for the film and worked closely with Neagle to ensure accuracy. The movie was a box office success and cemented Odette as a wartime heroine. Despite this, she disliked fame and made a point of dedicating her GC to the memory of her wartime comrades who did not survive.\n\nKeyes and his men silently crept through the perimeter wire and towards the house. They encountered a German sentry and Keyes shot him – the element of surprise was now gone. The commandos now rushed into the villa, shooting at any Germans they met. Keyes led them in, searching the rooms for his target, Rommel. He flung open the door to one of the rooms and was immediately shot at from within. One of his men threw in a grenade and the commandos retreated. Keyes died several minutes later. In June 1942, Geoffrey Keyes was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. Rommel had not in fact been at the villa – or even in the country – at the time of the raid. When he heard of it, he expressed admiration for Keyes' courage. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said, 'I would far rather have Geoffrey alive than Rommel dead.' The 'Rommel Raid' is recreated at the start of The Desert Fox. The action is tense as the commandos are shown landing on the coast, approaching the headquarters and gaining access to the compound. Following the gunfight that ensues, the character based upon Keyes is shown being shot and the raid ends in failure. The movie stars James Mason as Rommel and portrays his role in the last years of the Second World War.\n\nAt dawn on 25 April 1915, the SS River Clyde approached 'V' Beach on the Gallipoli peninsula. The plan was for the ship to run aground and for a smaller vessel to form a bridge so that the 2,000 men aboard could run across onto the shore. Commander Edward Unwin was the captain of the River Clyde and had come up with the scheme. Midshipman George Drewry was tasked with guiding in the smaller boat – a long, flat vessel called a hopper – to bridge the gap between the ship and the beach. Also on board the hopper, helping Drewry, was Seaman George Samson. From the outset, the plan went awry. The River Clyde ran aground, but the hopper swung to the left while attempting to connect with the beach. Working quickly, Unwin managed to get two rowing boats, or lighters, in position in front of the ship. With Able Seaman William Williams, he held them in place while the troops went ashore. But, as the British soldiers surged onto the beach, they were pinned down by heavy Turkish fire. Dead and wounded piled up and Unwin recalled they soon 'were literally standing in blood'. For an hour, Williams and Unwin stood in the water, holding the boats in place. Then, hit by a shell fragment, Williams fell and died. Unwin soon collapsed with exhaustion.\n\nDrewry waded across to help his stricken captain. Despite receiving a head wound, he worked on the lighters, encouraged men ashore, brought in the wounded and kept the landings going. He was helped by Midshipman Wilfrid Malleson. When Drewry attempted to secure the boats around the River Clyde together, Malleson went to his aid. He leapt into the water and managed to get a rope out, but soon had to give up owing to exhaustion. After a brief rest, Unwin returned to the boats and kept trying to secure them together so men could get across. He also went out in a boat to fetch in wounded men from the beach. Samson also worked to bring in the wounded, despite suffering multiple injuries himself. He had earlier assisted in the attempts to establish a bridge from the boats.\n\nThe disastrous SS River Clyde landing is recreated in the 1931 British drama film Tell England. Directed by Anthony Asquith and Geoffrey Barkas, it is based on the novel Tell England by Ernest Raymond. The movie merges the fictional story of two young men who join up to fight in the First World War with the real events at 'V' Beach of April 1915. Asquith corresponded with Unwin about the making of the film and the reconstructions of the landings are held to be largely accurate.\n\nWatch extracts from Odette, The Desert Fox and Tell England in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery: Extraordinary Heroes at IWM London."
