I found it really humbling.\n\nIt seemed to be quite well researched, and centred on the actions of a Major Robert Cain. (Clarkson's father-in-law, incidentally). If they made a film about him, you wouldn't believe it: http://www.extraplan.demon.co.uk/robert_cain.htm\n\nAm I right in thinking that the VC can only be awarded during wartime? The programme didn't mention that.\n\nS\n\nsdh500\n\nGuest\n\nNov 5, 2003\n\n#2\n\nNot necessarily, rhoamish. It is awarded (and I quote Victoria herself) \"to those officers or men who have served Us in the presence of the Enemy and shall then have performed some signal act of valour or devotion to their country\". In fact, the very first batch was awarded to 62 soldiers over 12 months after the end of the Crimean War.\n\nEd Selley\n\nHi-Fi Editor\n\nJoined\n\nJun 26, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n12,094\n\nReaction score\n\n5,627\n\nPoints\n\n3,130\n\nAge\n\n43\n\nNov 5, 2003\n\n#3\n\nOriginally posted by rhoamish\n\nAm I right in thinking that the VC can only be awarded during wartime?\n\nIt can technically be awarded at any time but due to its description- what exactly would you be doing to get it when not in hostilities? Black Ops cannot be publicised to the any extent and the UK/Commonwealth does not award \"record\" commendations (where your service file noted the award but due to the nature of what you were doing at the time it cannot be publicly announced).\n\nThought the program was excellent and that Clarkson managed something approximating to humility (I had previously thought this was impossible) and Cain's story and the others was well portrayed. Is it a one off?\n\nchard\n\nEx Member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 12, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n398\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n50\n\nNov 6, 2003\n\n#4\n\nthe VC can be awarded at any time, so long as it is for an action in the face of an 'enemy'.\n\nthis is why the young soldier was awarded last week, with a George Cross instead for his life saving act in the Iraqi war, as it was during a 'friendly fire' incident.\n\nI agree about the drama of the Cain VC, there are so many of these stories ...so how come the Brit film industry is still making feckin gangster films ? unfortunately VC winners are not politically correct....hence no film about the greatest Brit soldier of all time, Blair Mayne (Col Paddy), now theres a film waiting to be made !!\n\nchaz\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 7, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n4,644\n\nReaction score\n\n322\n\nPoints\n\n1,301\n\nAge\n\n74\n\nLocation\n\nsussex\n\nNov 6, 2003\n\n#5\n\nA girlfriend of mine her late father won the Victoria cross and bar which means i think he won th V C twice phew!

The insurance must be high and if it is sold to a museum, then far more people will see it and appreciate it than if it locked away in a bank vault.\n\nThe price of VC's and other medals has rocketed recently. There is a multi millionaire who has been buying up every medal that comes on the market , at any price. I used to collect medals myself and remember when you could get a VC for @10 K only 10 years back - the moe 'famous' the recipient , the more valuable the medal. A bar adds considerably, as would a famous battle, such as the only Rorkes Drift VC in private hands, it woul dprobably fetch a new record amount if it came up for auction."
