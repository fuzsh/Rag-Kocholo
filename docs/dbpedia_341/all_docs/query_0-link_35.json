The Lord Bishop of Liverpool, of The Palace, 19, Abercromby Square, Liverpool. His brother, Aidan also fell (HU 119837).\n\nObject description\n\nCaptain Noel Godfrey Chavasse VC and Bar MC of the Royal Army Medical Corps, attached to 1st/10th Battalion, The King's (Liverpool Regiment). Places and dates of deeds, France, 9 August 1916 and Bar to VC, Belgium, 31 July - 2 August 1917.\n\nLabel\n\nCaptain Noel Chavasse VC* MC \"The Captain took no more notice of the enemy's fire than he would of a few raindrops, and even when the bullets were whistling all around he didn't get in the least flurried in his work\" A stretcher bearer of the Liverpool Scottish describing Noel Chavasse Captain Noel Chavasse VC* MC was a medical officer in the British Army and one of only three people to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice. Chavasse was born in Oxford in 1884, but his family moved to Liverpool after his father was appointed Bishop of the city in 1900. He qualified as a doctor in 1912. In 1913, Chavasse became a medical officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and was attached to the Liverpool Scottish. When the First World War broke out, he accompanied his unit to the Western Front. Chavasse soon developed a reputation for bravery under fire. Having already been awarded the Military Cross, Chavasse received his first Victoria Cross for his actions near Guillemont in August 1916. Over a period of two days and nights, he saved the lives of more than 20 men. He was also wounded by a shell splinter. A year later, he again demonstrated extreme bravery. Near Wieljte in Belgium, Chavasse continued to tend to the wounded in terrible conditions for two days and nights, despite suffering wounds himself. He died of his wounds at Brandhoek on 4 August 1917 at the age of 32. Chavasse was awarded a second Victoria Cross after his death.\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.

The most important of these was the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA), passed on 8 August 1914 ‘for securing public safety’.\n\nFirst World War\n\n8 Celebrity Air Aces Of The First World War\n\nAviation was one of the most romanticised elements of the First World War. 'Air aces' in particular achieved celebrity status both during and after the war and their photographs regularly appeared in newspapers. Of the eight aces listed here, seven were killed in action between 1916 and 1918 or died in flying accidents during or after the war.\n\nFirst World War\n\nWhizz Bangs And Wind-Ups: 10 Tommy Slang Terms\n\nDuring the First World War, British soldiers used language in inventive and often humorous ways.
