        "text": "In the year 2005, Mitchell and Kenyon, a late Victorian and Edwardian film company, went from being a footnote in the received film history of cinema scholars to becoming a virtual household name. The company is certainly of interest in its own right, but this remarkable re-evaluation also makes it the perfect illustration of how film history - both popular and academic - is influenced by the survival and availability of materials.\n\nJames Kenyon (1850-1925) and Sagar Mitchell (1866-1952) formed their partnership at the very end of the 19th Century and continued making films until 1913, but the bulk of their film activity was in the first five years of the 20th Century. They were thus among the wave of filmmakers who swiftly followed in the footsteps of Britain's film pioneers - rather than themselves being pioneers of British filmmaking itself.\n\nGenerally, film historians had tended until recently to characterise the firm in terms of its relatively modest surviving output: fictional, or fictionalised, films, notably relating to the Boer War. They were thus interesting, minor regional figures. However, buried in the nation's paper archival sources was considerable evidence that most of their work was in a different type of filmmaking altogether. In fact, the great bulk of the firm's work was the making of non-fiction 'actuality' films across the UK (largely excepting only Southern England, and being especially active in the North West and Yorkshire). These were generally shot by the firm's camera operators, having been commissioned by travelling showmen. In other cases, the firm supplied the materials needed for the showmen or associates to arrange for the filming themselves.\n\nThe resulting films, typically two minutes in length, can be grouped into a few basic categories such as 'Factory Gate' scenes; films relating to sporting events; records of local processions; 'phantom rides' filmed from trams; and street scenes. In most cases, the commissioner's requirement would have been that as many people as the operator could possibly film in two minutes be captured somewhere in the frame, if only for seconds, thereby increasing the film's audience when it was screened at the fairground or other venue. The motive behind such films (which we might today prize for their 'documentary' qualities) was therefore almost always a highly commercial one!\n\nThe rediscovery and archiving (by the bfi National Film and Television Archive) of the Peter Worden Collection of Mitchell and Kenyon films - some 800 of these early films, unusually in the form of the original negatives - was accompanied by a major research project (at the University of Sheffield) exploring this generally neglected history. Interestingly, this has tended to reveal more about the colourful lives and characters of the showmen, and about the company's practices, than perhaps it has about Mitchell and Kenyon themselves as individuals. This is despite the fact that the sheer quality of their rediscovered films - explored through television, DVD releases and screenings - has made their names almost synonymous with early British filmmaking in the public mind. Future film histories may reach a settled judgment on Mitchell and Kenyon's real importance. It is likely that this will leave them neither the footnote they were for so long, nor perhaps the key filmmakers that they have now become. What future histories cannot take away from them is their place in the imagination of the early 21st Century British public. They owe this partly to the attention brought by the rediscovery of so much lost material, partly to the wealth of research that now supports it - but also to the skill, humour and humanity the films display.\n\nPatrick Russell"
