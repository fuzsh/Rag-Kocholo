        "text": "The UK premiere of the Berlin-based artist’s documentary fiction film, presenting a speculative narrative of maritime and epidemiological movement across oceanic space and time.\n\nClara Jo (b. 1986, United States) works with film, photography, and installation to re-engage socio-political understandings of the world in ways that entangle the senses. She plays with speculative narratives to offer alternative readings of certain landscapes, examining their material imprints and deep erasures. By reimagining these contexts through her work, Jo questions how these stories can feed into our collective imaginations during moments of crisis.\n\nFor her first institutional solo exhibition in the UK, Jo presents the documentary fiction film, Nests of Basalt, Nests of Wood. This new film is grounded by documentary footage shot by the artist whilst embedded with a research group from Mauritian Archaeology and Cultural Heritage on location in Albion and Flat Island, Mauritius. In Albion, Jo filmed the excavation and preliminary analysis of human skeletal remains from an unmarked cemetery on a former cotton plantation and sugar estate, as well as footage from Flat Island, an uninhabited islet located twelve kilometres off the north coast of Mauritius. This islet had been used as a 19th-century quarantine and detention station for indentured labour during several waves of the cholera epidemic.\n\nNests of Basalt, Nests of Wood weaves fictive elements through the concrete realities of these ghostly terrains via computer-generated animation drawn from her research within colonial archives in London. In doing so, the work makes visible certain scars that are hidden within these island landscapes and highlights the human capacity to forget the most traumatic parts of our history, privileging sanitised versions of the past in their place.\n\nThe film is narrated through the perspective of the Paille-en-queue bird, who has inherited oral histories from their ancestors of all they have witnessed from an aerial perspective. Spanning different elevations and time registers, this avian narrator highlights and commemorates erased and unknown histories from the legacy of British and French colonialism and movements of indentured labour across the Afrasian Sea (Indian Ocean).\n\nWatch the trailer for Nests of Basalt, Nests of Wood here.\n\nJo’s work has been exhibited and screened at Gropius Bau, Berlin; Centre Pompidou, Paris; ARKO Art Center, Seoul; Spike Island, Bristol; Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, and Edith-Russ Haus für Medienkunst, Oldenburg. She has previously held fellowships and residencies at Art Explora, Paris; Akademie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart, and the Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship, USA."
