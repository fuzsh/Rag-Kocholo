        "text": "By A Staff Reporter Kathmandu, Jun 1: A film Gurkha beneath the Bravery based on the true story of Kul Bir Thapa, who received the Victoria Cross for the first time for the Gorkhas, has been produced.\n\nThe film, which was shot entirely in England, is currently undergoing post-production works in London, said director Pradip Shahi. The production team plans to release the film in August. On September 25, 1915, the British forces launched a major invasion in France.\n\nKul Bir Thapa, then a 26-year-old rifleman from the 2nd Battalion, was wounded in the battle. However, he managed to survive. Thapa had been working for the rescue of the victims since September 26, 1915. It was after this incident that he received the Victoria Cross for the first time for the Gorkhas. Director Shahi said that the film was made to pay homage to the ancestors who fought for world peace putting their life at risk.\n\nHe said, \"The film shows that the Gorkhalis are brave and equally kind-hearted.\" The theme of the film is: The wounded soldiers in the World War are rescued by the Gurkhas.\n\nThe film is about a story of self-sacrifice, compassion and friendship.\n\nThe film, produced under the banner of Shy Productions, stars Samir Gurung, Gaumaya Gurung, Stuart Walker, Agostino Oberhofer, Olly Bassi, Rajan Gurung and Surya Gurung among others.\n\nThe story of the film is written by director Shahi himself. He has been making films in the UK for a long time and has won various international awards. Madhu Gurung and Prayas Gurung are the producers and Kshitij Subedi is the executive producer of the movie."
