        "text": "It is a still-vibrant and exciting film, featuring awe-inspiring battle scenes as well as three-dimensional performances of great subtlety and emotional truth. Lillian Gish wrote in her memoir, The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me, “To me, Intolerance recalls Mr. Griffith’s words: ‘We have gone beyond Babel, beyond words. We have found a universal language, a power that can make men brothers and end war forever. Remember that! Remember that when you stand in front of a camera!’”\n\nIntolerance weaves together four stories: the fall of Babylon in 539 B.C., the crucifixion of Christ, the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre in 1572, and a modern-day tale involving labor disputes, poverty, and being wrongly accused of murder. All four stories have something to do with intolerance in these tellings: persecuting those who are unlike us, massacring those of different faiths or creeds, or, even simpler, being cold-hearted towards those in need. Intolerance is a ultimately a cry for empathy and understanding.\n\nGriffith’s manipulation of different timelines and chronologies is still being imitated today in such multiple-storyline films as 21 Grams, Short Cuts, Babel, and Traffic, although none have quite so broad a scope. Griffith tells his four tales concurrently, so that we fly backward and forward in time, encouraged to find the links, to make connections. At first, the scenes in each storyline are lengthy, but as the film nears its thrilling climax, the scenes become shorter and shorter, until finally it all seems to blend together into one gigantic rushing river, which was, of course, Griffith’s intention.\n\nIn the modern-day story, we see a priggish do-gooder who dislikes youth, fun, and leisure time, beginning to gather power in various “uplifting” charities (which really just specialize in judging and condemning others). At the same time, labor unrest breaks out in local factories. The scenes of striking workers being fired upon by policemen crackle with such chaos and movement that some of it looks like it could be newsreel footage. It is not. Mae Marsh, a beautiful and sensitive actress, plays “Dear One,” the star of the modern story, a young woman who lives with her father, and then marries a guy who is wrongly accused of murder. Much of the blame for how things go down can be laid at the feet of the moralizing do-gooder whose heartlessness points an accusatory finger towards those in need.\n\nAnd back in B.C.-era Babylon, we see how the scheming priests of the great city sold out to the Persians (under the gloriously armored Cyrus), allowing the sacking of Babylon to take place. In Babylon, we meet a young feisty woman known as the “Mountain Girl” (played insouciantly and humorously by Constance Talmadge), who puts on the armor of a man to fight in defense of the city and the King she loves. But along the way, she has some trials and tribulations with courtship (she is trailed by a romantic dude with long curly locks known as “The Rhapsode,” and she is also put up for sale on the marriage market, where she stands on the platform, chewing on onions casually, pushing away the hands that grasp at her). The Mountain Girl is a great character, reminiscent of some of Shakespeare’s feisty cross-dressing heroines. Meanwhile, Jesus performs miracles, and then is betrayed, and the Hugeunots are slaughtered in 16th century France after increasing persecution and fear. We fly around in time.\n\nThe stories are held together visually by a haunting image of Lillian Gish, repeating with variations throughout the film. Gish sits in a dark dramatically-lit space, rocking a cradle (sometimes empty, other times seemingly full), and Walt Whitman’s words “out of the cradle endlessly rocking” is how Griffith chooses to open the film. Three cloaked figures huddle in the shadowy background behind Gish. They are not explained. Gish here seems to exist on the level of dreams and the collective unconscious, the human spirit aware of itself and its bloody history, and hoping that we (the collective “we”) can do better. The image is surreal, beautiful, resonant.\n\nThe film’s first act (there are two) ends with the sack of Babylon which is so thrilling, so spectacular and gruesome, that it puts many smash-'em-up blockbusters of today to shame. There are gigantic siege towers pushed up against the towering wall of Babylon (recreated in exquisite detail by Griffith), with flaming torches and boulders catapulted over the walls. Heads are lobbed off, people fall from great heights, chariots gallop along the top of the wall, and there are times when, looking at the screen, you are overwhelmed by the action. And Griffith, despite the chaos on screen, maintains control of how he tells his story. He cuts away from the carnage, to show us the Mountain Girl shooting arrows and laughing delightedly as they hit the mark, or to show the scheming priest standing in a tower, or the Princess offering up prayers in her inner chamber. Griffith controls the tone, the pace, the mood, in such a masterful way that we never lose our bearings, we never lose where we are. We have invested in the Mountain Girl, in the Princess; Griffith has made sure of it by setting up their characters so specifically. When the fall of Babylon comes, it is a devastation, and it is one of the great achievements in cinematic history.\n\nUnderstanding the potential inherent in cinema, and how it was different from the stage, was one of Griffith’s revolutions. Early moviemakers came out of the theatre tradition (as did Griffith), and early movies often feel like filmed plays, with the camera acting as the “proscenium,” and all of the action taking place in a literal space that feels and looks like a stage.\n\nIt was one of Griffith’s innovations to go in close, to highlight faces filling the screen, something that cannot be done on the stage. Griffith understood that cinema could play with time, condense it or stretch it out, depending on what tale he was telling. He could cut the film in such a way that tension would intensify, he could create a collage effect by cutting away from the main action to a smaller detail. All of these innovations are, of course, how we understand cinema now.\n\nThere’s nothing revolutionary now about a close-up of a face in the middle of a chaotic crowd scene. That is one of the ways a director tells his story, and tells us what to look at and how to feel. But in 1915 it was a revolution. As James Agee wrote, again in 1948, “There is not a man working on movies, or a man who cares for them, who does not owe Griffith more than he owes anybody else.”\n\nOr, as Charlie Chaplin, no slouch himself in the pioneering-genius department, once said of Griffith, “The whole industry owes its existence to him.”\n\nIntolerance is a film meant to be seen projected large, in a dark movie theatre, surrounded by a crowd. Now’s your chance."
