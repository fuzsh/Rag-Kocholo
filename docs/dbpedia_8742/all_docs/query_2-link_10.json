Contao CMS was first released in 2006 by Leo Feyer under the name TYPOlight. On June 6, 2010 it changed its name to Contao in order to avoid confusion with another content management system name TYPO3. According to the developer, the word “light” in the name suggested the CMS was only suitable for small projects. Contao CMS is mostly used by medium to large website, as it offers an intuitive web interface for users and a customizable administrator panel for developers.\n\nContao features focus on making this content management system adaptable to the needs of the user, while offering a search engine friendly and appropriate designs for different devices like desktop, tablet, and smartphone. Contao benefits from an international community of developers that actively works on improving Contao features and releasing new versions. On the community page of Contao CMS you can find out new the most recent news about the content management system, get support, discuss bugs or learn how to develop your own extensions and plugins that will enhance current Contao features.\n\nIn terms of design, this content management system allows you to customize the appearance of your website through Contao themes. You can purchase different Contao themes from their official website, from third party developers, or learn how to develop and implement your own Contao theme.\n\nIf you’re interested in getting a full Contao review you can visit their official website and check out the Contao demo. After you login to the online demo you will be redirected to an admin demo where you can customize how your Conteo demo site looks like. You can also try Contao by going to the CMS download page on their website. Choose the version you want to download and go through the installation process. In order to successfully set up you Contao demo you will need an Apache or IIS webserver, a minimum version of PHP5.2 and at least MySQL 4.1, though version 5.x is recommend and MySQLi is also supported. To preview all your changes and use the Contao demo site you’ve just created you will need a modern browser, and keep in mind Internet Explorer 6 is definitely not on the list. You will also need to install some PHP extensions, for example GDlib, which is used for image resizing.\n\nThe latest version released for Contao CMS is 4.5.6 and it became available for download on 6 March 2018, the same day as version 4.5.5. The software is released under a GNU LGPL free software license. While it was still known as TYPOlight, Contao CMS won second place in the 2007 Packt Publishing awards, in the “Most Promising Open-Source CMS” category.\n\nKey Facts\n\nCMS nameContaoUser rating (52 votes, average: 4.17 out of 5)\n\n4.17 5 52 Loading...CMS CategoriesCMS / PortalsCurrent version (stable)4.5.6Latest release date (stable)03/06/2018First release dateUnknownLicenseGNU Lesser General Public LicenseSupported languagesEnglishCMS Demo available (see above)Admin Demo available (see above)Helpful Links\n\nOfficial Website\n\nDownload Contao\n\nScreenshots"
