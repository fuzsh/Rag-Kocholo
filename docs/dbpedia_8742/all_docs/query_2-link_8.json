        "text": "How to Install Contao on Linux Mint\n\nContao is an open source content management system that allows users to create and manage websites with ease. This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing Contao on Linux Mint.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, you should have the following:\n\nA Linux Mint Latest installation.\n\nAccess to a terminal window.\n\nSudo privileges on the system.\n\nStep 1: Update the System\n\nBefore installing any new software, you should update the system to ensure that all packages are up to date.\n\nTo update the system, open a terminal window and run the following commands:\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nStep 2: Install Apache\n\nContao requires a web server to be installed on the system. Apache is the most popular web server software available.\n\nTo install Apache, run the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nAfter the installation is complete, start the Apache service:\n\nsudo systemctl start apache2\n\nTo make sure that the service starts at boot time, run the following command:\n\nsudo systemctl enable apache2\n\nStep 3: Install MariaDB\n\nContao requires a database to store its data. MariaDB is a popular database management system that is fully compatible with MySQL.\n\nTo install MariaDB, run the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client\n\nAfter the installation is complete, start the MariaDB service:\n\nsudo systemctl start mariadb\n\nTo make sure that the service starts at boot time, run the following command:\n\nsudo systemctl enable mariadb\n\nDuring the installation process, you will be prompted to set a root password for the MariaDB server. Make sure to set a strong password and keep it safe.\n\nStep 4: Create a Database for Contao\n\nBefore installing Contao, you need to create a new database for it.\n\nTo do this, open a terminal window and log in to the MariaDB server as the root user:\n\nsudo mysql -u root -p\n\nEnter the root password that you set during the installation process.\n\nNext, create a new database for Contao:\n\nCREATE DATABASE contao;\n\nCreate a new user for the database and grant them full access to the contao database:\n\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON contao.* TO 'contao_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n\nReplace password with a strong password of your choice.\n\nFinally, flush the privileges and exit the MariaDB shell:\n\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES; EXIT;\n\nStep 5: Install PHP\n\nContao is built using PHP, so you will need to install PHP on your system.\n\nTo install PHP, run the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql\n\nThis command will also install the PHP MySQL extension which is required to connect to the MariaDB server.\n\nStep 6: Download and Extract Contao\n\nVisit the Contao website and download the latest version of the software.\n\nhttps://contao.org/en/download.html\n\nSave the downloaded file to a folder in your home directory, such as ~/Downloads.\n\nNext, extract the downloaded file using the following command:\n\ntar -xvzf ~/Downloads/contao-x.x.x.tar.gz -C /var/www/html\n\nReplace x.x.x with the version number of the software that you downloaded.\n\nThis command will extract the Contao files to the /var/www/html directory, which is the default document root for the Apache web server on Linux Mint.\n\nStep 7: Configure Contao\n\nAfter extracting the files, you need to configure Contao. Start by creating a new configuration file:\n\ncd /var/www/html/contao-x.x.x cp system/config/localconfig.php.sample system/config/localconfig.php\n\nNext, open the localconfig.php file in a text editor:\n\nnano system/config/localconfig.php\n\nUpdate the following settings in the file:\n\n$GLOBALS['TL_CONFIG']['dbUser'] = 'contao_user'; $GLOBALS['TL_CONFIG']['dbPass'] = 'password'; $GLOBALS['TL_CONFIG']['dbDatabase'] = 'contao';\n\nReplace contao_user and password with the username and password that you created earlier. Also, make sure that the dbDatabase setting points to the correct database name.\n\nStep 8: Set File Permissions\n\nFor security reasons, you should set the correct file permissions for the Contao files.\n\nTo do this, run the following command in the terminal:\n\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/contao-x.x.x sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/contao-x.x.x\n\nThese commands will change the ownership of the files to the www-data user, which is the user that Apache runs as on Linux Mint. They will also set the file permissions to 775, which allows the web server to read and write to the files.\n\nStep 9: Access Contao\n\nAfter completing the previous steps, you can access Contao by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost/contao-x.x.x.\n\nReplace x.x.x with the version number of the software that you downloaded.\n\nYou should see the Contao installation page. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to install Contao on Linux Mint. You also learned how to set up Apache, MariaDB, PHP, and file permissions. With these tools in place, you can create and manage your own websites using Contao.\n\nIf you want to self-host in an easy, hands free way, need an external IP address, or simply want your data in your own hands, give IPv6.rs a try!"
