The release includes new features such as PHP 8 and Symfony 5 support, dynamic XML sitemaps, a simplified way to customize the back end, a new \"figure\" insert tag, custom regular expressions in the DCA and a lot more.\n\nPHP 8\n\nSupporting PHP 8 was more complicated than expected, since quite a few engine warnings were reclassified in PHP 8 (see https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings) and suddenly messages that were previously ignored as E_NOTICE now prevented code execution as E_WARNING. In particular, accessing undefined array properties in conjunction with the DCA was a major problem - the initial pull request for this contained over 1,800 changes in over 100 files alone.\n\nDue to the large number of changes and the expected side effects, we decided not to include PHP 8 support in Contao 4.9 LTS as originally planned, but as a new feature in Contao 4.11.\n\nNote on Contao 4.9 LTS\n\nSince Contao 4.9 LTS will be maintained until February 2024, but there will not be an active version of PHP 7 after the end of 2022, it was clear to us that Contao 4.9 LTS must also run with PHP 8. We have therefore modified the error reporting in Contao 4.9.10 so that E_WARNINGs are automatically ignored if the installation runs with PHP 8. If you have customized contao.error_level in your app, you need to apply this change to run Contao 4.9 with PHP 8.\n\nResources: #2568, #2594, #2599, #2606, #2679\n\nDynamic XML sitemaps\n\nDynamic sitemaps are no longer written as static files on the server, but generated depending on the context when the /sitemap.xml route is called and stored in the HTTP cache. This way, protected pages can be found by the Contao crawler and included in the search index, too.\n\nThe output can be customized using the new ContaoCoreEvents::SITEMAP event.\n\nResources: #2295\n\nBack end customization\n\nTo make it easier to customize the Contao back end, some configuration options have been added:"
