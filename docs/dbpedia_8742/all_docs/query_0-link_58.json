        "text": "Contao is a robust open-source content management system that is user-friendly, instinctive, and adaptable, and it enables you to develop websites in various languages and designs.\n\nContao can also be incorporated into a standard Symfony application. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to set up Contao on Ubuntu 22.04.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAn Ubuntu 22.04 VPS\n\nSSH root access or a regular system user with sudo privileges\n\nStep 1. Log in via SSH\n\nLet’s log in to your Ubuntu 22.04 VPS with SSH as a root user or as a regular user with sudo privileges.\n\nssh root@IP_Address -p Port_number\n\nIf you cannot log in as root, remember to replace “root” with a user that has sudo privileges. Additionally, replace “IP_Address” and “Port_Number” with your server’s respective IP address and SSH port.\n\nYou can check whether you have the correct Ubuntu version installed on your server with the following command:\n\n# lsb_release -a\n\nYou should get this output:\n\nNo LSB modules are available.\n\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\n\nDescription: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS\n\nRelease: 22.04\n\nCodename: jammy\n\nStep 2. Install and Configure Apache\n\nContao was initially created for the well-known LAMP stack, but it can operate on any web server that offers an up-to-date edition of PHP and MySQL. In this step, we are going to install Apache as the webserver. Let’s install Apache now.\n\n# apt install apache2\n\nOn Ubuntu machines, Apache will automatically start upon installation. To verify this, you can execute the command below.\n\n# systemctl status apache2\n\nYou will see the status there, apache is functioning.\n\nContao requires mod_rewrite, and the rewrite module is not enabled by default, let’s enable it now.\n\n# a2enmod rewrite\n\nAfter enabling a module, we need to restart apache to activate the new configuration.\n\n# systemctl restart apache2\n\nNow, let’s create two directories for our Contao installation.\n\n# mkdir -p /var/www/html/yourdomain.com/{web,contao-manager}\n\nThen, let’s give them the appropriate permission.\n\n# chown -R www-data. /var/www/html/yourdomain.com/\n\nThe next step is to create an apache virtual host.\n\n# nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/yourdomain.com.conf\n\nThen add the following in to the file\n\n<VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin [email protected] ServerName yourdomain.com ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com DocumentRoot /var/www/html/yourdomain.com/web ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com_error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/domain2.com_access.log combined <Directory /var/www/html/yourdomain.com/web> AllowOverride All Require all granted </Directory> </VirtualHost>\n\nSave the file, then exit. Make sure to replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain name or subdomain name pointing to your server.\n\nOnce the virtual host is added, we need to activate it.\n\n# a2ensite yourdomain.com\n\nThen, restart or reload apache\n\n# systemctl restart apache2\n\nStep 3. Install MariaDB Server\n\nContao supports MySQL server version 8.0+ or equivalent MariaDB server. In this step, we are going to install the MariaDB server from the default Ubuntu repository. To install the MariaDB server, execute this command below:\n\n# apt install mariadb-server\n\nThat’s it, the MariaDB server should be up and running now.\n\nStep 4. Create a Database\n\nAfter installing the MariaDB server on an Ubuntu system, the MariaDB server will run automatically. Therefore, we can now create a new database and database user for our Contao website. Let’s log in to MySQL shell as root users and create a database for our Contao website.\n\n# mysql\n\nOnce logged in to MySQL shell, we can run the following commands.\n\nmysql> CREATE DATABASE contao;\n\nmysql> GRANT ALL on contao.* to contao@localhost identified by 'm0d1fyth15';\n\nmysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nmysql> \\q\n\nMake sure to create a more complicated database password, and replace m0d1fyth15 in the command above with a more secure one.\n\nThe next step is optional but highly recommended. We need to create a password for our MySQL root user. Let’s invoke this command to proceed.\n\nStep 5. Install Composer\n\nContao utilizes Composer, a tool for managing dependencies, as the officially endorsed approach for installation. Let’s execute the following command below to download the Composer installer using wget command:\n\n# wget -O composer-setup.php https://getcomposer.org/installer\n\nOnce downloaded, we need to execute the following command to install and setup composer on our Ubuntu machine:\n\n# php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer\n\nVerify the installation and check the installed build version of Composer:\n\n# composer -V\n\nThe command above will return an output like this.\n\nComposer version 2.5.8 2023-06-09 17:13:21\n\nStep 6. Install PHP\n\nContao requires at least PHP 7.4, and specifically for Contao 5, PHP Version 8.1.0 or higher is required. On the Ubuntu 22.04 system, PHP 8.1 is the lowest version we can install. Let’s install PHP and its extensions from the Ubuntu repository.\n\n# apt install php-{xml,pear,intl,common,json,curl,mbstring,mysql,gd,imagick,zip,opcache} libapache2-mod-php\n\nStep 7. Install Contao\n\nThere are two methods to install Contao on your server, using Contao Manager and using the command line. In this tutorial, we will show you how to install Contao using Contao Manager.\n\nFirst, let’s enter /var/www/html/domain1.com/web\n\n# cd /var/www/html/domain1.com/web # sudo -u www-data wget https://download.contao.org/contao-manager/stable/contao-manager.phar -O contao-manager.phar.php\n\nNavigate to http://yourdomain.com/contao-manager.phar.php\n\nClick on Create Account button\n\nClick on the Setup button to install Contao\n\nClick on Get Started button\n\nClick Continue\n\nSelect distribution, we are going to install version 5.1; click Install\n\nPlease wait while the Contao Manager is running task operations in the background.\n\nOnce completed, you will be presented with a database configuration page.\n\nPlease fill the forms with the database details we created in the previous step in this tutorial. , make sure to choose MariaDB in the Server Version dropdown menu. Click the Save button to save the config.\n\nClick on Check database\n\nNow, click on the Execute button to create database tables, and once completed, click on the Confirm & Close button.\n\nYou will be brought to this page\n\nClick on Continue to create a new account\n\nClick on Add Account\n\nThat’s it! You have installed Contao on Ubuntu 22.04. You can click on Login to Contao to start using Contao\n\nLogin using the account credentials you created a moment ago.\n\nYou are logged in now, and you can start customizing your Contao website.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully installed Contao on Ubuntu 22.04.\n\nOf course, if you are one of our Ubuntu Hosting customers, you don’t have to install Contao on Ubuntu 22.04 yourself – simply ask our admins, sit back, and relax. Our admins will install Contao on Ubuntu 22.04 for you immediately without any additional fee, along with many useful optimizations that we can do for you.
