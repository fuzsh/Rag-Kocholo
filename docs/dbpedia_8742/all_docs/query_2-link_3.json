[eg: I have database table named Country with 2000 records in it].\n\nThen in CONTAO I have the page called Record (alias: record.html) in which I want to display information about one record at a time (depending on which one was requested). I thought of something like this http://path.com/to/my/page/record.html?id=201 and the information displayed should be of the 201st record in the table.\n\nThe problem is that I don't know how to achieve that in CONTAO.\n\nI also used this CONTAO insert tag: {{file::myfile.php?id='someid'}}. It works, in myfile.php i get the someid and query the database for the information needed. The problem of this solution is that I don't know how to pass the ID from the browser URL inside this CONTAO TAG.\n\nLooking forward to any solutions you can provide!"
