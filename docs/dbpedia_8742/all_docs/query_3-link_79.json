        "text": "Welcome to the Magin Lab\n\nTissues and organs depend on a strong cytoskeleton and its interaction with cell adhesion structures in order to provide strength to tissues and to maintain order at the subcellular level. Our research aims to understand the multiple functions of keratin proteins, which form the major cytoskeleton in all epithelia, during development, pathogenesis and regeneration of epithelia. We have a strong interest in the epidermis, where keratins not only maintain tissue strength and adhesion, but coordinate skin barrier formation, immune responses and organelle functions. This interest results from the fact that mutations in epidermal keratin genes cause a large number of rare but life-threatening blistering and hyperkeratotic genetic diseases, e. g. epidermolysis bullosa simplex for which currently no therapy exists.\n\nOne of the aims of our work is directed toward understanding molecular mechanisms of the blistering skin disease Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS), caused by mutations in keratin genes. Our research aimed to develop molecular therapy approaches to improve the EBS condition is supported by the patient organization DEBRA International. Prof. Magin serves on the Medical and Scientific Advisory Panel of DEBRA International since 2008. The Magin lab provides an open, collaborative and stimulating research environment promoting high impact research through national and international collaborations and is involved in mentoring students to develop a career as independent scientists. For further details, browse our website and feel free to contact us if you need further information.\n\nThe Magin group participates in the DFG priority programme SPP1782 (“Epithelial intercellular junctions as dynamic hubs to integrate forces, signals and cell behavior”) which is coordinated by Prof. Thomas Magin (for further information, see https://www.spp1782.de).\n\nThe Magin group coordinates the Bioimaging Core Facility of Leipzig University together with colleagues from the Faculties of Life Sciences and of Veterinary Medicine (for further information, see https://www.bioimaging.uni-leipzig.de)"
