If you want to install them please repeat the step for rocksolid-theme-assistant and rocksolid-frontend-helper.\n\n2. Step: Download the theme and import it\n\nImmediately after purchasing your theme you can download the theme package in your personal customer area.\n\nUnpack the ZIP file and you'll see multiple folders and files. We'll only need the file tao.cto for now, you can find it in the contao subfolder.\n\nLog into your back end and goto Layout › Themes click on Theme import in the upper right section. Choose the tao.cto in the file menu and click on Theme import. If no conflicts are detected click on Continue to complete the theme import.\n\nAlmost done: Import the website template (demo data)\n\nInstalling the demo data is perfect for new projects, since you'll get everything shown in the demo and can edit the content right away, additionally you'll see how everything is put together. On top of that all the for Contao typical connection between modules and content are already made for you.\n\nIf you website is already filled with content, that you can't transfer afterwards, skip this step.\n\nIf you're using Contao 4: To import the website template go back to the Contao installation tool under /contao/install. Open the section Import a template, select the tao/demo-website.sql and click on the button Import template.

You can get a free key on https://developers.google.com. After receiving your key you can edit the maps modules and enter it in the field Google Maps API key.\n\nCentered areas and background settings\n\nThe theme includes the content element Zentrierter Bereich (engl. centered area). You can use this element to wrap certain parts of full-width pages. Just create an element Zentrierter Bereich Anfang (engl. centered wrapper start) and Zentrierter Bereich Ende (engl. centered wrapper end) in an article and add your content in between.\n\nAdd the css class footer-bar to centered areas (as mentioned above) to activate the footer specific font and form styles.\n\nThe wrapper element allows you to define background images, positions, colors and effects – including a parallax effect and a background animation that is controlled by the users mouse movement.\n\nIf you want to display an HTML5 video in the background of a centered area, you should save them in the formats with the widest browser support. We recommend mp4/H.264 and webm/VP8. To set the background video, select both video files and the image you want to use the preview image.\n\nCSS classes\n\nYou can add the CSS class tao-boxed to a page or a page layout to display the single page in the boxed version (Example). If you want to use the boxed look for the entire website you can activate it using the Theme Assistant.\n\nYou can deactivate animations by adding the class not-animated either on single elements, pages or layouts.\n\nUse the class no-border to remove the borders around gallery, image and text elements.\n\nTo remove the responsive scaling of content images add the class no-resize to individual elements. If you want to deactivate responsive scaling for all content images you can disable it using the Theme Assistant.\n\nCSS icon classes\n\nYou can add the icons to elements either by using the data-icon attribute or by adding a CSS class like icon-.... You can find a list of all available icons in the Tao Live-Demo. Additional information about the icon font can be found in our icon font tutorial.\n\nNewsletter-Template\n\nIf you've purchased the theme including the newsletter template, please unpack the download package and copy all files and folders from the unpacked folder templates into the templates directory on your webspace.\n\nOptional: If you haven't imported the demo data, please add a hidden page named \"Newsletter Includes\". Use this page to add a single article for every newsletter you create. Fill the article with the newsletter-specific custom content elements found in the category Newsletter."
