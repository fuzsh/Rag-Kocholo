        "text": "WordPress CMS installations are vulnerable to a PHP bug related to data deserialization (also known as unserialization), a security researcher has revealed at the start of the month.\n\nThe bug has been reported to the WordPress team on February 28, 2017, but has remained unfixed to this day, more than a year and a half after the first report.\n\nVulnerability is in PHP, not WordPress per-se\n\nThe issue doesn't affect WordPress only —the Internet's most widespread CMS— but all PHP-based applications and libraries that handle user-supplied data.\n\nThe vulnerability is in the way PHP converts PHP objects (raw data) into strings and back into PHP objects again. This process is called serialization and deserialization, respectively, and is used in all programming languages to move data between different servers, services, or apps.\n\nPHP's serialization/deserialization process has been known to be vulnerable to various exploits since 2009 when German security researcher Stefan Esser documented the first attack leveraging flaws in the serialization/deserialization routine. Since then, other researchers have recorded various other methods of exploiting this process to take over servers and PHP applications [1, 2, 3].\n\nNew PHP deserialization attack discovered\n\nSpeaking at two security conferences this month —Black Hat Las Vegas and BSides Manchester— Sam Thomas, a security researcher with Secarma Labs, has revealed a new way of using PHP's deserialization process to achieve code execution on servers and apps.\n\nHis technique relies on attackers having the ability to supply (upload) malformed data to a server. The data is malformed in such a way to call on PHP's \"phar://\" stream wrapper and eventually chain various operations that grant the attacker the ability to execute malicious code.\n\nThomas has documented this vulnerability in a whitepaper released this week, and which he presented at both Black Hat and BSides conferences. The whitepaper is available for download here, while a video of Thomas' BSides presentation is embedded below.\n\nIssue affects WordPress, Typo3, TCPDF, probably more\n\nHis presentation includes three case studies showing how he used the bug he discovered in PHP's unserialize process to exploit the WordPress and Typo3 CMS platforms, but also the TCPDF library embedded inside the Contao CMS.\n\nOn WordPress, the PHP deserialization bug affects the CMS' thumbnail processing functions, and exploiting the flaw requires an attacker having the ability to upload a malformed image on the platform.\n\nThe attack requires two different types of payloads to exploit due to changes in the WordPress platform in version 4.9 —one payload for WordPress versions before 4.9, and another for subsequent versions. You can see Thomas explaining the attack steps on WordPress at the 29:25 mark in the video above.\n\nWhile the issue has remained unfixed in WordPress, Thomas says the Typo3 team patched the bug in versions 7.6.30, 8.7.17, and 9.3, released on July 12, 2018. He filed a report with Typo3 on June 9, 2018.\n\nThe vulnerability was also reported on May 24, 2018 to the TCPDF project, the go-to library for working with PDF files in PHP, but has also remained unfixed. Fixing the issue in PHP itself is not an option, and patching needs to be done at the application level.\n\nSerialization issues affect many programming languages\n\n\"The research continues a recent trend, in demonstrating that object (un)serialization is an integral part of several modern languages,\" Thomas wrote in his whitepaper. \"We must constantly be aware of the security impact of such mechanisms being exposed to attacker-controlled data.\"\n\nThomas is referring to the fact the serialization/deserialization flaws have been a headache in many programming languages."
