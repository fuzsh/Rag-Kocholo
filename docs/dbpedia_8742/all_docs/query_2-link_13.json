        "text": "Install Contao - Quick start\n\nWe assume here that you want to install either the latest version or the Long Term Support Version with the Contao Manager. This is the easiest and recommended way for beginners. Some hosting providers offer 1-click installations. However, for the best user experience, we recommend using the Contao Manager or the console.\n\nHosting configuration\n\nYou configure the hosting via the admin panel of your hosting provider.\n\nRoot directory (document root)\n\nYour provider will usually give you a folder where you can store your websites - this is often a /www, /public_html or /httpdocs folder. There you can install Contao for your new website. It has proven useful to first create a subfolder in this path, e.g. /example for the page example.com - this is then your installation or project folder.\n\nIn Contao, all publicly accessible files are located in the /public subfolder. Create a folder called public and set the root directory (document root) of the installation to this subfolder via the admin panel of the hosting provider to this subfolder.\n\nExample: example.com points to the directory /www/example/public.\n\nDatabase\n\nContao requires a MySQL database for operation, which you should ideally create right away. Its login credentials will be needed later.\n\nInstalling the Contao Manager\n\nThe Contao Manager consists of a single file which can be downloaded from contao.org. After a successful download you will receive a file called contao-manager.phar. Transfer this file to the public directory on your web server.\n\nCall Contao Manager\n\nNow call up the URL www.example.com/contao-manager.phar.php with your browser, replacing www.example.com with your domain. You should see the welcome page of the Contao Manager.\n\nBasic configuration\n\nBefore you install Contao you need to configure the manager itself. To do this create a new user by assigning a username and password. Username and password are independent of the later Contao installation!\n\nServer configuration\n\nThe Contao Manager needs the path to the PHP binary and other server information to run background processes correctly. Usually, this information is detected automatically.\n\nComposer Resolver Cloud\n\nThe Composer Resolver Cloud allows the installation of Composer dependencies even if the server does not have enough memory. Please note that your package information is sent to a Contao Association cloud service for dependency resolution.\n\nInstalling Contao with the Contao Manager\n\nAfter the successful basic configuration, Contao can now be installed. To do this, select the desired version and the initial configuration and click on the “Install” button.\n\nOptionally, you can also install the Contao “sample website”.\n\nThe installation may now take several minutes. Details of the installation process can be viewed by clicking on the following icon .\n\nUpdating database tables\n\nOnce the Contao Manager has installed all packages, the database needs to be updated. To do this the Contao-Installtool has to be started (Contao 4.13 LTS) or the required information has to be entered directly in the Contao Manager (Contao 5.x).\n\nCreate an administrator account\n\nFinally, you need to create an administrator user with which you can log in to the Contao back end later.\n\nUser name: Here you define the user name of the administrator.\n\nName: Here you enter the first and last name of the administrator.\n\nE-mail address: Here you enter the e-mail address of the administrator.\n\nPassword: Here you set the password of the administrator and confirm it."
