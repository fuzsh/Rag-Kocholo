Select the desired version and the initial configuration and click the “Install” button.\n\nThe installation can now take several minutes. Details about the installation process can be displayed by clicking the following icon .\n\nOnce the Contao Manager has installed all packages, you have to run the Contao install tool to update the database.\n\nInstallation via the command line\n\nWhen installing from the command line via create-project, a composer update command is executed during the installation. This will cause some hosters not to be able to terminate the process due to high system load, and the installation will fail. In this case you should use the Contao Manager.\n\nYou have logged on to your server with your user name and domain.\n\nChange to the public directory of your web hosting.\n\nInstall Composer\n\nComposer is an application-oriented package manager for the PHP programming language and installs dependencies.\n\nInstalling Contao from the command line\n\nIn the second step, you install Contao using the Composer. “example” stands for the desired installation directory and 4.11 for the version of Contao you want to install.\n\nHosting Configuration\n\nIn Contao, all publicly accessible files are located in the subfolder /web of the installation. Create this folder and use the admin panel of your hosting provider to set the document root of the installation to this subfolder and create a database on this occasion.\n\nExample: example.compoints to the directory /www/example/web\n\n(since 4.12 Following the Symfony standard, the public subfolder of /web has been renamed to /public. If there is a /web directory in your installation, Contao will automatically use it instead of /public).\n\nEvery Contao installation therefore requires its own (sub)domain.\n\nAfter installation, you can update the database using the Contao install tool.\n\nSince Contao 4.9 you can use the following command on the command line:\n\nCreating Contao back end users"
