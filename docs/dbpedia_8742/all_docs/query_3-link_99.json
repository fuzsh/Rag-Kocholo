        "text": "Outstanding teamwork, modern technology, flexible structures and an environment that promotes creativity and communication – this describes the world of work Berlin Hyp is heading towards with its future-oriented process. The name says it all: “next dimension berlin hyp”. It is a matter of taking the Bank’s development to a new level and gearing it to future requirements.\n\nHere, agility and flexibility are of particular importance. “From my point of view, this is primarily a question of mindset” says Sascha Klaus, Chair of the Board of Management of Berlin Hyp. “That is why we are paying particular attention in our future-oriented process to how to maintain and develop our corporate culture”.\n\nCulture and organisation as a basis, modern IT as the technical backbone (please refer to this page for more information on this topic) – the question remains as to how this new type of cooperation will be expressed in spatial terms.\n\nOur “B-One” project is the answer to this. Within the next few years, Berlin Hyp will build a new corporate headquarters. The headquarters’ workforce, which was spread over two building sections so far, will then work in a new building that will provide space for contemporary forms of cooperation. After its completion (scheduled for 2024), the headquarters will not only offer a modern working environment; B-One will also be considerably more cost-effective, resource-saving and climate-friendly in its operation.\n\nThese new working environments contribute to the Bank’s sustainability strategy, which is also being taken to the next level: the Bank has drawn up a far-reaching sustainability agenda, which includes a clear commitment to the Paris Agreement and the Climate Paths of the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as a comprehensive set of measures (please refer to this page for more information).\n\nWe use so-called session cookies (also called non-persistent or transient cookies) on our website.
