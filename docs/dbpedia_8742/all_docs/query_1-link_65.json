        "text": "If there are multiple records in the database table “tl_user” for which the admin flag is set, you can reset the first value for all of them to create a new administrator in the Contao install toolbar.\n\nYes, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), under which Contao has been licensed since version 2.5, allows you to use the system for commercial projects. Please note that the copyright notices in the Contao files may not be removed or changed according to the license terms.\n\nYes. You have to rename the directory. Check if the entry \"public-dir\": \"web\" exists in the “composer.json” and remove it or change it to public. Then set this directory as the document root via the admin panel of your hosting provider. Afterwards execute composer install from the manager or the console.\n\nsince 4.13 You can add the entry route_prefix in config.yaml and then you have to empty the application cache once using the Contao Manager or the console.\n\n# config/config.yaml contao: backend: route_prefix: '/myadmin'\n\nCheck the SMTP details of your hoster in your parameters.yaml or add them if missing. Then you have to empty the application cache once via Contao Manager (“Maintenance” > “Application Cache” > “Rebuild Production Cache”) or via the console.\n\nThe e-mail address set in “Settings > E-mail address of the system administrator” is also used as the sender for e-mails sent by the form generator. You can enter an additional e-mail address in the “Site structure” section for the “Starting point of a website” page type. This E-Mail address will then be used as the sender. Since Contao 4.10 you can set different e-mail configurations per website starting point, form and newsletter channel.\n\nYou can add the entry prepend_locale: true in config.yaml and then you have to empty the application cache once using the Contao Manager (“Maintenance” > “Application Cache” > “Rebuild Production Cache”) or the console. Since Contao 4.10, you can freely define the URL prefix, independently of the language.\n\n# config/config.yaml contao: prepend_locale: true\n\nYou can add the entry url_suffix: '' in config.yaml and then you have to empty the application cache once using the Contao Manager (“Maintenance” > “Application Cache” > “Rebuild Production Cache”) or the console.\n\n# config/config.yaml contao: url_suffix: ''\n\nCheck in the file manager if the directory with your images is marked as “Public”. Also make sure that there is no outdated .htaccess file in the /web folder or a parent folder of your installation.\n\nIf you make changes to a SCSS partial file, you must then empty the script cache in “System Maintenance”.\n\nThe Contao Manager automatically performs an update check when it is accessed. If a new version is available, Contao Manager will update itself.\n\nThe Composer Resolver Cloud allows you to install Composer dependencies via the Contao Manager even if your server does not have enough memory.\n\nIf the Contao Manager stops responding, the console output window does not close, or after a reload of the manager page or after a reload of the manager page you always get the same output, delete the file contao-manager in the directory task.json. delete the file task.json.\n\nAfter that, the Contao Manager should run again.\n\nYes. You can use any file name you want. However, the Contao Manager is no longer accessible from the Backend. In this case, you can change the config.yaml accordingly. Afterwards, you have to empty the application cache once using the Contao Manager (“Maintenance” > “Application Cache” > “Rebuild Production Cache”) or the console.\n\n# config/config.yaml contao_manager: manager_path: your-name.phar.php"
