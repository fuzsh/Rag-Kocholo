        "text": "SHE won hearts as the main character in the movie A Little Princess - championing the mantra that all girls are princesses.\n\nAdorable Liesel Matthews played the lead character of Sara Crewe when she was nine, and has had a complete change of career 20 years down the line.\n\nIn the movie she played the role of a young girl who is sent to boarding school in New York, only to be later kept as a servant in the attic.\n\nThe movie, which saw her entertain friends with her positivity and stories, was beloved when it was released in 1995 and was even nominated for two Academy Awards.\n\nLieselâ€™s acting career was short-lived, however, and she only made two further films, Air Force One (1997) and Blast (2000), according to IMDB.\n\nNow she is 33, and lives in Greater Boston, Massachusettes with husband Ian Simmons, who she married in 2011.\n\nShe goes by her marital name of Liesel Pritzker Simmons, and has kept busy since leaving the big screen.\n\nOutside of Hollywood, Liesel was an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune which was estimated by The New York Times in 2002 to be around $15 billion.\n\nWhen she was studying at Colombia University that same year, Liesel and her brother filed a six billion dollar lawsuit against her father and eleven older cousins.\n\nThey claimed the family had misappropriated their trust funds, and the case proved successful.\n\nThe lawsuit resulted in Liesel receiving a $500 million payout according to Forbes, and she left America soon after to head to India, similar to her character in A Little Princess.\n\nShe spent her time and as a yoga teacher in a program designed to rehabilitate heroin addicts and also volunteered in a nursery.\n\nLiesel has since dedicated her post-acting career to setting up a number of philanthropic firms such as the Young Ambassadors for Opportunity (YAO).\n\nSimilar to her generous character in A Little Princess, she has pumped millions of dollars in non-profit organisations which focus on promoting education and clean water initiatives.\n\nAnd do you remember Sara's on-screen best friend Becky?\n\nShe was played by actress Vanessa Lee Chester, who has gone on to star in How I Met Your Mother and The Lost World: Jurassic Park.\n\nIf you were surprised to see the actress grown up, check out Eminemâ€™s adorable daughter Hailie now she is 20."
