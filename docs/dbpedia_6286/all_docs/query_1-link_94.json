        "text": "Before Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN or PRISONER OF AZKABAN or CHILDREN OF MEN, director Alfonso Cuaron enchanted with this wonderful family film. Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, who also wrote THE SECRET GARDEN, the film captures the power of the imagination. It can make a life magical.\n\nSara Crewe (Liesel Matthews, AIR FORCE ONE) has been living in India with her father (Liam Cunningham, THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY), but when WWI breaks out and he is sent to war, Sara moves to a boarding school in New York City. She isn't accustomed to all the ridged rules of the headmaster Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron, THE HOUSE OF MIRTH), who doesn't like the girls of the school to act like children. She's cruel to the slower student Ermengarde (Heather DeLoach, BALLS OF FURY) and treats the young black maid Becky (Vanessa Lee Chester, THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK) like a slave. Sara quickly becomes one of the most popular girls with her fantastic stories. But her world takes a dark turn when she gets news that her father has been killed in battle.\n\nThe best children's stories always deal with the harshness of life with honesty. While endings are often happy, the road to them isn't easy. With his talented production team, Cuaron really captures these Dickensian elements of the story perfectly. Emmanuel Lubezki's Oscar-nominated cinematography creates a hazy world that idealizes the high points and emphasizes the lows, but keeps everything grounded in realism at the same time. His work brings out Bo Welch and Cheryl Carasik's Oscar-nominated art design, which creates a magic realism feel at times.\n\nMatthews, whose real last name is Pritzker-Bagley, is one of the heirs to the Hyatt Hotel fortune and is worth around $500 million. Since 2000 she has slipped out of the film world. Besides being fun facts, they underline the loss of a promising actress. She performs here with an unforced grace. So many child performers who play kind play it maudlin, but Matthews is a natural. She also has the skills to not overplay the low moments. When she is turned into a servant by Miss Minchin and she loses faith, we feel the character's depression. It's one of those rare captivating child performances.\n\nBron plays the wicked Minchin with secrets. She's a bitter woman whose life hasn't turned out as she would have liked, so she is hell bent on making everyone else miserable. A nice contrast to Bron's glowering sourpuss is Rusty Schwimmer (THE PERFECT STORM) as Minchin's flighty, jovial sister, Amelia. And if you keep an eye out who can catch a young Camilla Belle (PUSH, WHEN A STRANGER CALLS) as the schoolgirl Jane.\n\nSara's father tells her that every little girl is a princess if they believe they are. This bit of whimsical advice goes very far. It gives her the kindness to be nice to all the girls (unless they really deserve a curse). It gives her the freedom to be imaginative. And most importantly, it gives her the optimism to overcome any hardship. Combined, all three, allow her to transform the girls around her. She brings out the princesses in them all. These young girls don't need a handsome prince to save them.\n\nBuy \"A Little Princess\" on DVD Here!"
