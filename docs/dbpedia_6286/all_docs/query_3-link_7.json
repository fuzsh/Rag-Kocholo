        "text": "SHE became a household name in the hit 90s film A Little Princess.\n\nBut these days Liesel Matthews looks a far cry from the role that made her famous when she was just nine days old.\n\nNow she is 39, and lives in Greater Boston, Massachusettes with husband Ian Simmons, who she married in 2011.\n\nShe goes by her marital name of Liesel Pritzker Simmons – leaving her child star past well and truly behind.\n\nIn A Little Princess she played the role of a young girl, called Sara Crewe, who is sent to boarding school in New York, only to be later kept as a servant in the attic.\n\nThe movie, which saw her entertain friends with her positivity and stories, was beloved when it was released in 1995 and was even nominated for two Academy Awards.\n\nBut despite her huge success, Liesel’s acting career was very short lived and is thought to have only starred in two more films - Air Force One (1997) and Blast (2000).\n\nHer real life was however just as eventful as a movie because she was an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune which was estimated by The New York Times in 2002 to be around $15 billion.\n\nWhen she was studying at Colombia University that same year, Liesel and her brother filed a six billion dollar lawsuit against her father and eleven older cousins.\n\nThey claimed the family had misappropriated their trust funds, and the case proved successful.\n\nThe lawsuit resulted in Liesel receiving a $500 million payout according to Forbes, and she left America soon after to head to India, similar to her character in A Little Princess.\n\nShe spent her time and as a yoga teacher in a program designed to rehabilitate heroin addicts and also volunteered in a nursery.\n\nSpeaking previously about getting away from it all, Liesel told Forbes: \"When you go someplace where you're completely foreign to anybody, you're just there.\n\n\"You're seen for who you are and not for all of the Googling behind you, so to speak.\"\n\nLiesel has since dedicated her post-acting career to setting up a number of philanthropic firms such as the Young Ambassadors for Opportunity (YAO)."
