        "text": "Staring: Liesel Matthews, Liam Cunningham, Eleanor Bron, Vanessa Lee Chester\n\nDirector: Alfonso Cuaron\n\nRating: G\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to one of my favorite childhood films. A Little Princess has been a film that's stuck with me all throughout my twenty four years on this earth. Getting the chance to watch it again as an adult only solidifies just how much of an impact it has had on my life. This is Alfonso Cuaron's best film that he has ever directed. Period. The script, the music, the cinematography; it all combines perfectly to create a beautiful masterpiece that leaves me breathless.\n\nThis film tells the story of young Sara Crew (Liesel Matthews), who is sent to a prestigious boarding school in New York City while her father, Captain Crew (Liam Cunningham), sets off to fight in the first World War. Sara and her father have an inseparable bond, as the two of them are all they have left in the world. The school headmistress, Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron), immediately clashes with Sara. Miss Minchin has no patience for Sara's grand imagination and strong sense of self-worth. Despite Miss Minchin's many attempts to put an end to such things, Sara relishes her class mates with tales of her old life in India, and the magic that exists in those lands.\n\nThings all fall apart when tragedy strikes and Captain Crew is presumed dead; his assets are seized by the government, leaving Sara penniless. Miss Minchin informs her that she will now have to earn her keep here, and she is banned to live in the attic as nothing more than a servant girl. Sara befriends the other servant girl, Becky (Vanessa Lee Chester), and the two soon become fast friends.\n\nThroughout her hardships Sara still retains the title of princess. Not by her birth right, nor by her appearance, but by her actions. Sara stands up for her friends on numerous occasions, always willing to take the blame so that they don't have to. She also sees the good in all people, regardless of social class or race. She believes that all girls are princesses, and she holds firmly to that belief even when challenged by Miss Minchin.\n\n“I am a princess. All girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics. Even if they dress in rags, even if they aren’t pretty, or smart, or young. They’re still princesses. All of us. Didn’t your father ever tell you that? Didn’t he?”\n\nAt the heart of this film is the tale of a father and daughter; and a love between them that defies all of the odds. That underlining message is what causes me to bawl like a baby every time I watch this film. I don't want to give away the ending, but there's one scene specifically that makes me so thankful to have my father in my life.\n\nAnother one of the aspects of this film that I love is the cinematography. The colors! Oh My God, the colors! I can't even begin to describe what a large part they play in my love for this film. The set designer and cinematographer are pure geniuses. I also love how Alfonso Cuaron specifically worked with them to set different colors for different levels of symbolism. Sara's life in India is shown in creams, pinks and oranges; while her time New York is shown in dark greens and black.\n\nThe musical score is still stuck in my head after last nights viewing. It is simply so hypnotic and beautiful, especially due to the fact that each piece has a hint of India behind it. For a children's movie the acting in this film is superb. Eleanor Bron is deliciously evil as Miss Minchin, I wanted nothing more than to smack her character upside the head throughout the entire movie. Liesel Matthews outshines most of her older counterparts, and you really get the sense that she is Sara Crew.\n\nIf I haven't said it enough already, I absolutely adore this film and everything it chooses to be. I will remember it for the rest of my life and share it with my children someday. This is storytelling at it's finest. Thank you, Alfonso Cuaron.\n\nOne a scale of 1 to 10: A Little Princess receives a stunning 10."
