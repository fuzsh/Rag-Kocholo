        "text": "The young pupils of Miss Pinchon's finishing school for girls love their classmate Sara Crewe, captivated by her pre-TV imagination, which spins magical tales more romantic and quaintly adventuresome than anything their domineering headmistress allows.\n\nOne trip through director Alfonso Cuaron's sumptuous adaptation of France Hodgson Burnett's beloved book A Little Princess lets us know exactly how they feel.\n\nIn a hectic summer season of bombs, bats and busts, A Little Princess is a delightful family surprise; as classy as a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation, with all the lump-in-your-throat emotion of the greeting card commercials in between.\n\nSara (played with uncommon maturity by newcomer Liesel Matthews) is a girl raised by her widowed military father (Liam Cunningham) in India in 1914. When he is called away to World War I, Sara is sent to New York City, where her sweet independence doesn't mesh well with Miss Pinchon's strict ways. Eleanor Bron plays the spinsterish villain with a stern demeanor that never shrieks of parody.\n\nBad news from the war front pulls Sara off her pedestal, to the satisfaction of Miss Pinchon, which sends A Little Princess gliding into a different sort of Cinderella tale, touching to the hardest hearts and beautifully realized.\n\nMatthews is the best of a remarkably affecting cast of young performers, and her scenes with Cunningham are priceless _ glowing remembrances of loving father-daughter relationships so often ignored by filmmakers. This is a film that will make parents glad they have a daughter, or wish they did.\n\nProduction values are extraordinary, with special praise for Emmanuel Lubeski's lush cinematography. Scenes of Lisa's favorite fantasy _ the romance of Prince Ram Dass and Princess Sita _ pulsate with glorious color, counterbalancing Sara's situation and occasionally sharing the spectacle, as in a wonderful snow flurry revival of Sara's spirits.\n\nSara, of course, is the little princess of the title, but Cuaron's film constantly reminds us that every girl deserves royal treatment, and why. A Little Princess is a small, lovely jewel for their crowns.\n\nA Little Princess.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW\n\nA Little Princess\n\nGrade: A\n\nRating: G\n\nRunning time: 100 min."
