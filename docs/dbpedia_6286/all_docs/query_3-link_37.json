        "text": "Film by Alfonso Cuarón\n\nA Little PrincessDirected byAlfonso CuarónScreenplay by\n\nRichard LaGravenese\n\nElizabeth Chandler\n\nBased onA Little Princess\n\nby Frances Hodgson BurnettProduced byMark JohnsonStarringCinematographyEmmanuel LubezkiEdited bySteven WeisbergMusic byPatrick Doyle\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed byWarner Bros.\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n97 minutes[1]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$17 million[2]Box office$10 million[3]\n\nA Little Princess is a 1995 American fantasy drama film directed by Alfonso Cuarón. Loosely based upon the 1905 novel A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett, the film stars Eleanor Bron, Liam Cunningham, Liesel Matthews, Vanessa Lee Chester, Rusty Schwimmer, Arthur Malet, and Errol Sitahal. Its plot, heavily influenced by the 1939 cinematic version, focuses on a young girl who is relegated to a life of servitude at a New York boarding school after receiving news that her father was killed in combat.\n\nA Little Princess was released in the United States by Warner Bros., through their Family Entertainment label, on May 10, 1995. The film garnered positive reviews and received various awards, including two Oscar nominations for its achievements in art direction and cinematography.\n\nIn 1914, a kind-hearted young girl named Sara Crewe lives in India with her widowed father Richard, a wealthy British Army Officer, who shares his love for stories of myths and magic. Called in to serve in the Great War, Richard enrolls Sara at an all-girls boarding school in New York City, which her late mother had attended run by its haughty and spiteful headmistress Maria Minchin, and her kindly sister Amelia.\n\nInstructing Maria to spare no expense for his daughter's comfort, Richard furnishes the school's largest suite and leaves Sara with a locket once owned by her mother and a doll named Emily, which he tells her will keep them connected through magic. Although stifled by Maria's strictness, Sara becomes popular among the girls, including an African-American scullery maid, Becky, for her kindness and powerful imagination. In her spare time, Sara writes to her father, who is caught in a gas attack while trying to save a fellow soldier in the trenches.\n\nHoping to extort more money from Richard, Maria throws Sara a lavish birthday party, but Richard’s solicitor arrives with news that he has been killed in battle; the British government has seized his assets, leaving Sara penniless. Maria moves Sara to the school's attic with Becky to work as a servant and confiscates her belongings, including the locket, allowing Sara to keep only Emily and a book.\n\nThough her life is bleak, Sara remains kind to others, but gets her revenge on Lavinia, a school bully. Charles Randolph, the school's elderly neighbor, receives word that his son John has been declared missing in action while fighting in Europe. Ram Dass, Charles' Indian associate, comes to notice Sara from the neighboring attic, overhearing her imaginative stories. When a wounded soldier suffering from amnesia is misidentified as John, Ram Dass encourages Charles to take the man in.\n\nMeanwhile, Sara's friends sneak into Maria's office and recover her locket, visiting Sara that night to hear her tales of Prince Rama. Scorned after catching Sara, along with the other girls, Maria punishes her and has Becky locked up in the attic for an entire day. However, Sara stands up to Maria's cruelty with her father's belief that \"all girls are princesses\" no matter their lot in life. She later comforts Becky by imagining a feast and fine clothes for them, awakening to find that the dream has come true, with their attic secretly transformed by Ram Dass.\n\nInspired by Sara, Amelia runs away with a milkman, and Maria soon discovers the locket is missing. Confronting Sara in the attic, she accuses her of \"stealing\" the finery left by Ram Dass and viciously locks Sara in her room while she summons the police. With Becky's help, Sara narrowly escapes by making a perilous climb over to the Randolph house. As Maria and the police search for her, Sara discovers that Richard is the recovering soldier but he, suffering from amnesia, does not recognize her. Though Maria does clearly recognize Richard, she deliberately lies by spitefully saying that Sara has \"no father\". As Sara is dragged away by the police, Ram Dass helps Richard regain his memory. Outside Richard saves Sara and the two are happily reunited while Maria, defeated, angrily walks away.\n\nSometime later, Charles has taken over the school, now a much happier place for the girls, and has found peace in knowing that Richard tried to save his son. Richard's fortune has been restored and he has adopted Becky. As punishment for her vile treatment of Sara and the other girls, Maria is reduced to working for a young chimney sweep she mistreated earlier. Sara gives Emily to the girls and shares an unexpected hug with Lavinia, before she and Becky depart for home.\n\nLiesel Matthews as Sara Crewe, Richard’s sweet, kind and caring daughter who enrolls at a New York City boarding school and forms a relationship with the other students while clashing with the headmistress.\n\nEleanor Bron as Maria Minchin, a cynical, cruel, greedy and heartless headmistress, and Amelia's older sister, who runs the boarding school where Sara is enrolled.\n\nLiam Cunningham as Richard Crewe, a captain in the British Army and Sara's father.\n\nCunningham also portrays Prince Rama, a character from Sara's story.\n\nVanessa Lee Chester as Becky, a young African-American servant who lives in the attic of the school.\n\nTaylor Fry as Lavinia, a vindictive bully who is bitterly jealous of Sara's wealth and popularity.\n\nHeather DeLoach as Ermengarde, a shy, insecure girl often bullied by Lavinia and Miss Minchin.\n\nKelsey Mulrooney as Lottie, a volatile youngest girl at Sara's school prone to tantrums and fits.\n\nRusty Schwimmer as Amelia Minchin, Maria's younger, long-suffering sister.\n\nArthur Malet as Charles Randolph, a kind old man who lives next door to the school. He is loosely based on Mr. Carrisford.\n\nErrol Sitahal as Ram Dass, A lascar who is Randolph's wise Indian servant who later befriends Sara.\n\nCamilla Belle as Jane, Sara's schoolmate\n\nRachael Bella as Betsy, Sara's schoolmate\n\nJonás Cuarón as Jim, the chimney sweeper\n\nKen Palmer as John Randolph\n\nVincent Schiavelli as Mr. Barrow\n\nPeggy Miley as Mabel, a cook who works for Miss Minchin.\n\nAll of the tracks were composed by Patrick Doyle. Three of the tracks feature soloists. The \"String Quintet in C major Perger 108, MH 187\" by Michael Haydn is also used in the film. The film also features the New London Children's Choir.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 37 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Alfonso Cuarón adapts Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel with a keen sense of magic realism, vividly recreating the world of childhood as seen through the characters.\"[4] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 83 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[5]\n\nJanet Maslin called the film \"a bright, beautiful and enchantingly childlike vision\", one that \"draw[s] its audience into the wittily heightened reality of a fairy tale\" and \"takes enough liberties to re-invent rather than embalm Miss Burnett's assiduously beloved story\". She concluded:\n\nFrom the huge head of an Indian deity, used as a place where stories are told and children play, to the agile way a tear drips from Sara's eye to a letter read by her father in the rain, A Little Princess has been conceived, staged and edited with special grace. Less an actors' film than a series of elaborate tableaux, it has a visual eloquence that extends well beyond the limits of its story. To see Sara whirling ecstatically in her attic room on a snowy night, exulting in the feelings summoned by an evocative sight in a nearby window, is to know just how stirringly lovely a children's film can be.[6]\n\nRita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film Cuarón's \"dazzling North American [sic] debut\" and wrote it \"exquisitely re-creates the ephemeral world of childhood, an enchanted kingdom where everything, even make-believe, seems possible ... Unlike most distaff mythology, the film does not concern the heroine's sexual awakening; it's more like the typical hero's journey described by scholar Joseph Campbell. Sara, the adored Spoiled and pampered child of a wealthy British widower, must pass a series of tests, thereby discovering her inner strengths\".[7]\n\nAward Category Recipient Result Academy Awards[8] Best Art Direction Bo Welch and Cheryl Carasik Nominated Best Cinematography Emmanuel Lubezki Nominated Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards[9] Best Picture 2nd place Best Production Design Bo Welch Won Best Music Patrick Doyle Won Young Artist Awards[10] Best Family Feature - Drama Nominated Best Young Leading Actress Vanessa Lee Chester Nominated Liesel Matthews Nominated\n\nAs of April 1997 Warner Bros. sold two million copies for an estimated $32 million in video revenue—the studio receiving 75%—greatly exceeding box office gross.[11] The film was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on September 19, 1995 and was first released on DVD on November 19, 1997.\n\nFilm portal\n\nUnited States portal\n\n1990s portal\n\nSarah...
