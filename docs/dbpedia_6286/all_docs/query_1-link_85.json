        "text": "It’s Remembrance Day today.\n\nMy grandfather fought in WWII and before he passed away when I was seven, I remember thinking that the point of Remembrance day was to make sure people like him knew how much we appreciated them for what they did for us and I’ve pretty much kept that perspective into my adulthood.\n\nI’m not a big fan of War movies. I understand that some of the best movies in history have been about war (Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, etc.) and although I concede that these movies are fantastic, none of them have rooted themselves into my heart like so many other films have. Except for one. And you can barely say it’s a War movie.\n\nOne of my favourite films of all time which I will watch over and over again until the end of time is the 1995 film, A Little Princess. This is one of those movies where the feeling and tone of the film are some of it’s best attributes. It’s a gorgeous movie where the art direction, cinematography and music play such a gigantic role in how awesome it is.\n\nPeople who know me well know that I have a weakness for Father-Daughter moments in movies, and I credit this movie for having one of the most consistent Father-Daughter moments which makes me bawl like a little baby every single time.\n\nThe basic plot of this film is that a wealthy, yet creative and endearing girl, Sara Crewe is enrolled in a New York boarding school while her father fights for the British army in WWI. When her father is thought to have been killed at war, the British government seizes his assets, forcing Sara to remain at Miss Minchin’s elite boarding school, but as a servant instead of a student.\n\nAlthough there are only a few scenes in the film which depict the actual war happening, the general sense of intensity and fear that everyone is experiencing throughout the story adds to many of the best emotional moments.\n\nSome great things about this movie:\n\n– IT IS BEAUTIFUL. The scenes in this movie have been stuck in my brain permanently since the first time I watched it years and years ago.\n\n– The soundtrack is awesome and haunting. Just another dark and unexpected surprise.\n\n-It was nominated for Academy Awards for Art Direction and Cinematography\n\n-Directed by Alfonso Cuarón who also directed films such as Y Tu Mama Tambien, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men. He also produced Pan’s Labyrinth. Just in case you thought this film was similar to the Shirley Temple version…\n\n-Liesel Matthews, the talented lead actress who plays Sara, starred in this film and played the President’s daughter in the Air Force One movies and then basically stopped acting in movies. She also happens to be a Pritzker, and an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain. She is currently worth billions of dollars after suing her father and other members of her insanely rich family for siphoning approximately $1 billion from her personal trust fund left to her by her Grandfather. It’s all very Gossip Girl and I found this Vanity Fair article to be particularly interesting.\n\nP.S. I’m fighting every fiber of my being by not including a clip of the climax of the movie. It will ruin everything for you, so I’m not doing it, but it’s also one of the best movie scenes (and father-daughter scenes) EVER."
