        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn 1914, Sara lives in India with her widowed father Richard, a wealthy British Army officer, with whom she shares a love of myths and magic. When World War I breaks out and he is called to serve in it, Richard enrols his daughter at an all-girls boarding school in New York City which was also attended by Sara’s mother when she was a child. Despite the behaviour of Miss Minchin, the school’s strict headmistress, Sara becomes popular among the other girls for her kindness and wild imagination. But as time goes on, Miss Minchin resolves to take advantage of Sara’s finances and to make her life a misery in the meantime. With the help of her newfound friends alongside her resilience and creativity, Sara continues to stand up for what she believes in and sets out to make the school a better place for all. Based on a classic children’s novel, ‘A Little Princess’ explores themes around storytelling, friendship, and anti-bullying."
