        "text": "Adaptations are notoriously difficult. The very set-up of trying to take a beloved novel and turning it into a movie people will like, is a recipe for failure. THE HEIRESS is an anomaly, a successful and beloved adaptation of Washington Square by Henry James. Actress Olivia de Havilland, who recently celebrated her 103rd birthday, saw an adaptation of the book on broadway and immediately got the rights, needing to play Catherine Sloper.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the film, THE HEIRESS follows Catherine Sloper (Olivia de Havilland), a young, introverted heiress lacking proper social skills by 19th century societal standards. At a party, she meets Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), a poor, but handsome man who woos Catherine with great tenacity. Catherine falls for him easily, having not been paid attention to very often, if at all. Catherine’s father (Ralph Richardson) disapproves of the union because he believes Morris’s intentions dishonorable. Simply put, her father believes Morris only wants her for her money. Catherine wishes to give up her inheritance if it means Morris and her can be together. So I don’t ruin its ending, let’s just say, drama ensues!\n\nTaking place in the late 19th century, it’s fascinating to examine the gender roles. This film almost feels like the anti-Pride and Prejudice. In Pride and Prejudice, you have a poor, but intelligent woman rejecting the concept of marriage without love, even if it means security. Whereas, in THE HEIRESS, you have a wealthy, but naive girl rejecting the idea of a life without love, even if the person doesn’t necessarily want her for her. The most gut-wrenching bit of the film for me is when Catherine’s father and aunt tell her they believe Morris only wants her for her money. Moreover, her father tells her she has nothing else that anyone could love her for. I was so angry on Catherine’s behalf. The idea that the two people Catherine is closest to see her as nothing is emotionally terrifying. It made me think about how much of our sense of self is built on the validation of the people around us.\n\nThe movie is expert in just about every way. Certainly, director William Wyler is partially responsible for that. This is specifically true in his direction of his lead actors, Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift. Olivia’s performance is stunning and by the end, unsettling. She won her second Academy Award for the role. Clift was originally not wanted for the role of Morris as it was thought that he would appear too modern to be a 19th century gentleman. Clift and de Havilland apparently didn’t see eye to eye on their acting techniques either. Clift believed Olivia came to set knowing her lines and nothing else. He believed she put everything into the direction she was given which he didn’t believe to be “real acting.” Olivia respected Clift, but thought that everything he did acting-wise was for himself. Still, she said it helped her give the best possible performance as Catherine is supposed to feel isolated.\n\nThe film was apparently going to be remade in 1993 by Director Mike Nichols and Tom Cruise. However, after screening the film, they didn’t believe it could be improved upon. A remake was finally made in 1997 with Jennifer Jason Leigh, though, of course, it didn’t surpass the success and critical acclaim of the original.\n\nFamily films or movies directed at children usually get a bad wrap, or well, not enough attention. That quota goes up when you have a children’s film about a little girl. Even more if you have a word like “Princess” in the title. A LITTLE PRINCESS, the 1995 Alfonso Cuaron adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s turn of the century novel, is one such film. A movie made for young girls that’s so smart and fun and moving that it resonates with adults too. There had been previous adaptations of the novel, most notably the 1939 film starring Shirley Temple in her heyday.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar, A LITTLE PRINCESS (1995) follows Sarah Crewe (Liesel Matthews), a wealthy little girl with a big imagination. Her greatest hero is her dad who’s been raising her in India since the death of her mother. When WW1 breaks out, Sarah’s father takes her to America to stay in a boarding school while he enlists. There, Sarah makes quick friends with the other girls, regaling them with tales of India and happy times. But when news reaches Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron), the school’s headmistress, that Sarah’s father has died and his assets have been seized by the government, Sarah is made a servant in the school, living in the attic with Becky, an orphaned Black girl. Sarah must overcome her adversity and keep her idealism in the face of deep heartache and pain.\n\nAs a kid, I saw this movie many times over. I think what sets it apart is that it doesn’t talk down to young people. Instead, it validates children’s feeling, seeing their problems and emotions as real and important. When Sarah is told that she is alone in the world, I can’t help but tear up. Part of that is due to the fantastic script by Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler, which toes the line of sentimentality and broad comedy expertly. I also love the scenes between Becky and Sarah, the moment where they wake up to a full and beautiful meal waiting for them, after they had “imagined” it the night before. The final scene between Sarah and Miss Minchin is heartbreaking because while Miss Minchin is evil, you actually feel bad for her. She’s allowed to be human too. The score by Patrick Doyle is beautiful and moody.\n\nIn Alfonso Cuaron’s oeuvre, this is perhaps a lesser known, lesser thought of entry. His stamp is all over this film specifically in the magical realism of Sarah’s stories and in his almost technicolor set design. He contrasts the color palette depending on the emotional moment. Cuaron is also adept at deep emotional moments. The relationship between Sarah and her father is the core of the emotional drama. It reminded me so much of Harry Potter and Sirius in PRISONER OF AZKABAN. Even though you know where the movie is heading, you’re still on the edge of your seat wondering if Sarah and her father will reunite.\n\nIt’s one of those rare films that can truly be watched by the whole family. To me, it’s about keeping your spirits up, even when the world seems stacked against you. Children are open enough to believe in that. Adults sometimes need a reminder. I love this movie for that."
