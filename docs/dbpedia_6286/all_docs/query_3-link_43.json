        "text": "Movie Openings\n\nA Little Princess ****\n\n(Century 16, Century 12) Once in a very great while, I see a movie that is truly as satisfying for adults as it is for children. \"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" came close, but the complicated chess moves were confusing for younger children. \"The Little Mermaid\" was charming, but some adults found the perky flounder slightly nauseating. \"A Little Princess\" is immensely satisfying for all ages, a film of such exceptional quality that it's almost impossible to believe that it's a remake of the plodding 1917 Mary Pickford silent and the 1939 saccharine-sweet Shirley Temple vehicle, all based on the novel and subsequent play by Frances Hodgson Burnett (\"The Secret Garden\").\n\nThe story is simple. Imaginative 10-year-old Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) lives a charmed life in early 20th-century India with her devoted father Captain Crewe (Liam Cunningham), who is ultimately called to war. Sara is immediately enrolled at a tony New York Academy, Miss Minchin's School for Girls. Devastated, but determined to support her absentee father, Sara maintains a stiff upper lip and wins over her classmates with her confident ways and extravagant storytelling. When Captain Crewe is reported missing in action and all his assets frozen, the unsympathetic Miss Minchin strips Sara of all possessions and privileges and demotes her to the role of servant girl. But is Sara's father really dead?\n\nA stunning film of fresh visual style and cinematic originality, \"A Little Princess\" manages to pull out all the stops while remaining sincere and unaffected. A perfectly performed drama cut with fantasy sequences illustrating Sara's imaginative stories, it's reminiscent of last year's \"Heavenly Creatures,\" in which fact and fiction were combined into a fluid blend of good storytelling. Liesel Matthews' Sara is a constant delight, as is the intense relationship between father and daughter. Bold, often outrageous color, camera work of exceptional clarity, flawless period costuming and a diverse score make for glorious entertainment.\n\nIf my four stars aren't convincing enough, my daughters, both savvy moviegoers, insist on assigning their own: four and four. Rated G, but the fantasy monsters are intense. 1 hour, 37 min.\n\n--Jeanne Aufmuth\n\nForget Paris ***\n\n(Century 16, Century 12) This very funny comedy-romance starts where many of the same genre end: The once-committed bachelor and the the pretty woman entwined in each other's arms, dancing to a lone saxophone player on the banks of the Seine, each with that goofy \"happily ever after\" grin on their face.\n\nHello. Reality check. Who lives happily ever after anymore?\n\nMickey (Billy Crystal) is an NBA referee and middle-aged bachelor who lives in an L.A. apartment that's a \"shrine to watching ESPN.\" We meet him just as he sets off to accompany the body of the father he barely knew to the old man's final resting place, alongside his World War II buddies in France. When the airline sort of--er, misplaces the coffin, he is sent to talk with its public relations agent, Ellen (Debra Winger), an American living in Paris. Charmed by Mickey's sarcastic wit (indeed, it's impossible for him to utter one serious sentence), Ellen accompanies him on the requisite sightseeing tour of Paris. Who wouldn't fall in love over candlelighted suppers in the shadow of an illuminated Eiffel Tower?\n\nCut to L.A.\n\nWhen Mickey's back in his element--joking around with Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Spud Webb and Isiah Thomas, and eating nothing but veal parmigiana--Ellen must find solace in her two best new American friends, Ben and Jerry. Not to mention get through the trauma of a truly bizarre (and very hilarious) little incident involving glue paper meant for trapping mice, a pigeon and a harrowing car ride to the vet's office. (Don't ask. Just see the movie.)\n\n\"Forget Paris\" is an honestly told tale of a couple trying to salvage a troubled but potentially good relationship under the '90s-style pressures of dual careers, infertility problems and an annoying in-law who walks around muttering, \"You asked for it. You got it. Toyota.\" It's the second outing as director for Crystal, whose \"Mr. Saturday Night\" wasn't nearly as successful as this charming comedy.\n\nWinger, mostly known for her dramatic roles, has a good sense of comic timing and is a nice balance to Crystal's manic sarcastic self. His every word, his every joke--and there are many--is just too obviously written for him. There's that old \"stand-up\" feel to many of his scenes. But he is a very funny comedian. And \"Forget Paris\" is a very funny movie. Rated PG-13 for profanity and very mild love scenes. 1 hour, 40 min.\n\n--Monica Hayde"
