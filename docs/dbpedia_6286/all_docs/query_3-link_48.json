        "text": "A Little Princess is a beloved childhood classic, and the film turns 20 this year. In the process of rewatching the movie so we could reminisce about its empowered, hopeful message, we also had to pause many times to investigate what the cast members were up to now. This led us to connect with Vanessa Lee Chester, who played Becky in the film. She was only nine when she was cast as Miss Minchin’s scullery maid, and it was her first-ever feature role.\n\nHow does Chester remember A Little Princess? “It’s just such a special story with so much heart and so many beautiful themes and elements in it,” she told Refinery29. “As a kid, I knew the film was special, but it wasn’t until I started getting messages on Instagram and Twitter that I really started to understand the impact it had on little girls. I love it when fans tell me they used to pretend I was their best friend as a child. I had no idea my character was that loved!”\n\nDirector Alfonso Cuarón, who’s now known for helming more adult fare like Gravity, was also a dream to work with. “I think my favorite memory from the set would involve bright pink foam rollers and Alfonso’s luscious locks,” Chester says. “He had amazing jet-black curly hair in which the girls and I would put pink rollers. I mean, how could you not love him for letting us do that? Not only was he a good sport, [but] he would direct in the curlers for hours.”\n\nChester recalls having a blast on-set. “It was never-ending jokes, giggles, and pranks. Liesel [Matthews, who played Sara] and I went through a stage where we became poker experts. We would bet sticks of gum from craft service in between takes. I became unnaturally skilled at poker for a nine-year-old.”\n\nShe still keeps in touch with some members of the cast on social media, but told R29 that, “It would be really nice to have a reunion with all the gals.” Since we couldn’t quite arrange that, what with scheduling issues and one of the original cast members crushing it on Game of Thrones, we compiled this virtual round-up as a way to check in with the stars of A Little Princess, 20 years later. Here’s what they’re up to now.\n\nVanessa Lee Chester (Becky)\n\nChester went on to star in The Lost World: Jurassic Park and many more films and TV shows. Still, “There was definitely a sweetness and simplicity about A Little Princess that I wish more projects possessed,” the actress says.\n\nToday, she’s “living the dream and still acting! Since my Little Princess days, I graduated with a degree in economics at USC — go Trojans! I’m still very active in the entertainment industry, whether it’s in front of or behind the camera. I just finished an episode of Scorpion and have some other projects coming out this year. All in all, life is good and free of complaints.”\n\nYou can follow Chester on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nLiesel Matthews (Sara Crewe)\n\nMatthews was the stage name Liesel Pritzker used during her brief stint in movies. Following A Little Princess, she played the President’s daughter in Air Force One and only made one more film before leaving Hollywood.\n\nShe comes from one of the wealthiest families in the country — the Pritzkers own the Hyatt hotel chain, among other enterprises. While attending Columbia University, she sued her father and other relatives over her inheritance. The family settled internally, and Pritzker (who later married and now goes by Liesel Pritzker Simmons) has since devoted the hundreds of millions of dollars she inherited — along with her time and energy — to philanthropic endeavors.\n\nToday, she and her mother head the IDP Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit that helps schools in Ghana. She also runs the Blue Haven Initiative with her husband, Ian Simmons. You can watch Liesel Pritzker Simmons discuss the impact of investing and her decision to use her inheritance to give back here.\n\nLiam Cunningham (Captain Crewe)\n\nThe Irish actor has had a very long career on both stage and screen, but he’s best known today for his role on Game of Thrones. Cunningham plays Ser Davos Seaworth, a former smuggler who (as of now) is Stannis Baratheon’s right-hand man. You can follow him on Twitter.\n\nKelsey Mulrooney (Lottie)\n\nShe was the motherless girl who could throw a fit on command, until Sara acted as a surrogate mom and taught her to rein in those tantrums (unless they were needed, as with the film’s great locket-retrieval scene). Mulrooney continued acting through the ’90s, but her career in front of the camera seems to have tapered off since 2002.\n\nCamilla Belle (Jane)\n\nBelle began acting at a very young age, and like her Little Princess costar Vanessa Lee Chester, she also appeared in The Lost World. She’s since starred in big releases like 10,000 BC as well as indie fare including Open Road. You can follow her on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nEleanor Bron (Miss Minchin)\n\nAlthough most millennials probably recognize Bron as the evil Miss Minchin, who was never told she was a princess, Bron was first thrust into the spotlight when she starred in the Beatles film Help! According to The Telegraph, Paul McCartney claimed to have used her first name as the inspiration for “Eleanor Rigby.” Bron talked at length about her life and career in this fascinating interview with The Independent. She’s still acting and has written several books.\n\nErrol Sitahal (Ram Dass)\n\nSithal played Kumar’s father Dr. Patel in the Harold & Kumar franchise. According to a 2012 profile in The Guardian Trinidad and Tobago, he continues to act both on stage and screen in the U.S., Canada, and his native Trinidad.\n\nHeather DeLoach (Ermengarde)\n\nForget about A Little Princess. Heather DeLoach was the friggin’ bee girl in Blind Melon’s “No Rain” video! She even has an awesome public Facebook page called Heather DeLoach, “The Bee Girl.” Today, she owns and operates Sweet Bee Candy Stations and Event Planning. She told MTV that she still gets recognized as the bee girl.\n\nRusty Schwimmer (Amelia Minchin)\n\nSchwimmer (no relation to David) has been acting steadily since ALP, with roles in The Perfect Storm and Louie being highlights. (Yup, she played Louie’s pregnant sister.)\n\nLike this post? There’s more. Get tons of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and cat videos on the Refinery29 Entertainment Facebook page.
