        "text": "Cuarón beautifully adapts the classic story by Frances Hodgson Burnett about young Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews), sent from her home in India to a New York boarding school when her father leaves to fight in WWI. Her engaging spirit and imagination win her many friends, and one enemy: the headmistress Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron). Miss Minchin tolerates Sara only because of her father’s wealth, so when he disappears, his estate taken by the government, Sara is consigned to a cold attic room and expected to work to keep her place at the school. Capturing a youthful sense of delight and wonder with precise detail, A Little Princess shows how to handle difficult situations with clever perseverance."
