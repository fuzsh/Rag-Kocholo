        "text": "The Saturday morning screening of Warner Bros.’ “A Little Princess” at the DGA was followed by a kid-friendly party at a kid-friendly hour.\n\nIndian princesses in colorful saris attended the buffet tables and staffed the arcade games, which included face painting, balloons, a ringtoss and an inflated bouncing arena. Kids dined on miniature hamburgers and hot dogs, while adults ate curried chicken salad and finger sandwiches.\n\nThe event was chaired by Big Princess Lezlie Johnson, Nancy Short, Kate Capshaw and Marsha Williams, who are married to handsome princes Mark, Martin, Steven (Spielberg) and Robin, respectively. Also on hand: Kevin Costner, Amy Ephron and many of the film’s diminutive stars.\n\nThe movie, about a temporarily orphaned girl who never fails to believe that “all girls are princesses,” was quite the tear-jerker. The actresses, however, were full of near-Amazonian attitude. Vanessa Lee Chester, who plays Becky, a beleaguered serving girl, came bounding up to director Alfonso Cuaron, who is from Mexico City, and gave him a high-five. “Felicidades Alfonso!” Vanessa cried. “Felicidades Vanessa!” Cuaron replied.\n\nStar Liesel Matthews said, “The hardest part was all the emotional scenes, having to prepare. Sometimes the director would play music, sometimes he’d yell at me. Not at me, but my character.”\n\nThe event benefited Westside Children’s Center, which provides services to at-risk families. Several foster-care children from the Center were on hand, and one had to wonder how they saw the movie. “We talked about it,” said Galen Thomas, director of the Center. “When I asked what they liked best, the littlest one said, ‘The sad parts.’ ”\n\nA 10-year-old girl with hearts painted on her face said, “I liked the way she never gave up and believed in things.”\n\nCuaron agreed with the children: “Movies for kids--why do people try to avoid sadness?”\n\nRobin Williams commented on why so many children’s stories are about orphans: “No matter if your parents are around or not, you always want more of them.”"
