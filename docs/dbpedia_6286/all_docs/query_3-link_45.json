        "text": "Before Alfonso Cuarón directed Roma, Gravity, and Children of Men, he made this beautiful adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s classic story—one of the finest children’s films of the 1990s. Plucky young Sara (Liesel Matthews) arrives at a New York boarding school when her father is sent off to war. Her engaging spirit and imagination win her many friends and one enemy: the headmistress Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron). With Cuarón’s famous attention to detail and wonder, the film captures the delights of childhood and shows how to handle difficult situations with clever perseverance. (97 mins., 35mm) Recommended for ages 7 and up.\n\nSee the complete Zoom: Family Film Festival 2019 lineup"
