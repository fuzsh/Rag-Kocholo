        "text": "I’m actually kind of astonished. I expected this to very much not be my thing, even with Cuarón goggles on, but I regret doubting my boy. What a shame Cuarón and his team can’t make every movie ever. I love what he’s doing right now, but the fact that this creativity and filmmaking skill is absent from so many children’s movies does make me wish he would do more, or at least that more people would take some notes from him. What we have on our hands is a fairy tell in every sense bursting with creativity, that at the same time has refined wide interiors that at times rival Barry Lyndon (yeah I said it), scenes that look ripped…\n\nOne of those films where the message is strong (imagination, caring for everyone) but the execution centers whiteness and privilege in a way that sidelines the non-white characters in a patronizing and isolating manner. Exotifying the stories and characters of India and treating the Black girl as an almost silent side character both make it hard to like this film despite moments of joy or empathy. This feels like The Secret Garden but less beautiful and more Dickensian.\n\nSometimes I feel like children's films need to be more punishing of their villains.\n\nThere is a literal monster of a child in this film. She is constantly saying \"spend the whole day watching me comb my hair\", \"don't touch anything of mine, your poor\", and \"ew your black, don't talk to me\".\n\nShe is fucking terrible and at the end of the movie she hugs the good people and all is forgiven. No movie! I want her dead or at the very least have the other kids punch her in the throat.\n\nKill the fucking racists you cowards!!!"
