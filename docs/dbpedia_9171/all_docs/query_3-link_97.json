My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of David, i was invited and went blindly after not hearing any of his music before. I was pleasently surprised! It was an amazing show! I would 100% go again! Can't wait for him to be back in birmingham.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nWe had a great concert last night with David Rovics at the Mount Toby Friends Meeting House. We heard a lot of his new songs: lots of funny songs interspersed with serious history lessons. I especially enjoyed the Hillary and Trump songs.\n\nIf you like to hear the truth about history and politics, don't miss a concert by David Rovics.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
