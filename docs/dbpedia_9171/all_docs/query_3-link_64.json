You can also download the song as an MP3.\n\nAll of my spring and summer tour plans are currently on hold, along with everyone else’s, for obvious reasons. Lots more on that later, but I thought I’d share this new song with you for now. And here’s the latest episode of Song For Today, on the anniversary of the My Lai massacre in 1968 (today).\n\nViral Solidarity\n\nThere’s foreboding in the air\n\nWaiting for an earthquake\n\nPandemic spreading\n\nNo telling how it might remake\n\nA world so divided\n\nIn so many, many ways\n\nAnyone can see\n\nIt’s no way to greet such days\n\nWhen you can shut your borders\n\nBut it’ll barely slow the spread\n\nWith a million people homeless\n\nAnd not enough hospital beds\n\nIn times like these we find out\n\nThat a society\n\nIs only just as strong\n\nAs our solidarity\n\nThe foreboding in the air\n\nCan get only thicker\n\nAs we see our leaders\n\nPassing blame and getting sicker\n\nA crashing economy\n\nLeaders fraught with indecision\n\nOnly capable of thinking\n\nLike bought-off politicians\n\nNot enough testing kits\n\nAnd the ones you got were broken\n\nBut hey\n\nThe president has spoken\n\nChorus\n\nA million people wake up\n\nIn the morning thinking\n\nThoughts they never had\n\nTil they found that they were sinking\n\nOn a cruise ship full of holes\n\nWhere if you can’t catch the breeze\n\nThere are no fences tall enough\n\nTo keep out the disease\n\nLifting every boat\n\nOr watching them all sink\n\nReady or not\n\nWe’re standing on the brink\n\nChorus\n\nContain an epidemic\n\nLike in Wuhan or in Seoul\n\nOr watch a catastrophe\n\nTake its toll\n\nHide behind our gates\n\nCowering, afraid\n\nOr organize our neighbors\n\nIn mutual aid\n\nIn synchronicity\n\nSuch great things can be done\n\nA planet to lose\n\nOr a world to be won\n\nChorus"
