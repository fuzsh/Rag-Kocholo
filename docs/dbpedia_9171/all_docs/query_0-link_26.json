In 1640, New York governor William Cosby burned disrespectful ballads on the steps of the City Hall in frustration at not being able to discover their authors.1 Abolitionists during the slave trade and plantation era adapted hymns to their cause, changing the lyrics to protest against slavery; the rise of the labor movement in reaction to the ill effects of the industrial revolution in the late 19th and early 20th century was accompanied by musical resistance. “Every participant in revolutionary activity knows from his own experience that a good mass song is a powerful weapon in the class struggle,” American composer Aaron Copeland wrote in the first Workers Song Book. “No other form of collective art activity exerts so far-reaching and all-pervading an influence.”2 Each chapter in this volume discusses that influence through movements in the United States that have challenged authority and the status quo and have been fired up by music. Protest songs in the United States have either complimented or contradicted the strain of individualism that runs alongside resistance in U.S. history. From the gospel music of slavery in the 18th and early 19th centuries with its messages of freedom shared through an underground system, to the music of the Occupy Movement of 2011 shared through Facebook and Twitter, music has played a key role in the tradition of rebellion in the United States. To fully comprehend the motivating qualities of the music described in the following chapters, it is, of course, necessary to actually listen to it. Nothing illustrates the power of music more than hearing it. The message described through lyrics and context tells a story, but the written word fails to convey the emotional unifying effect of protest songs, especially\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The nuances of resistance music and its performance underpin its message, giving songs an added force that words on a page obviously cannot express. Listening to protest songs in isolation, however, is still not the same as collaborating with them as part of a collective response to oppression—any more than reading Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech is the same as hearing it for the first time as part of a crowd. Regrettably, it is not possible for either the music described in each chapter to burst out from the pages of this volume or the dancing that often accompanied it, particularly in the case of African American and American Indian music. What is accomplished by each contributor, however, is the painting of a vivid picture of resistance through music within the context of specific oppression followed by specific reaction. The stories of the musicians involved are often as compelling as the music itself and these stories connect the creative urge within humanity to the collective urge to address injustice, whether through songs that inform and provoke thought and eventual action, or through songs that directly unite and propel those already protesting. More recent examples of the former category include songs such as P. F. Sloan’s “The Eve of Destruction,” Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” and Sly and the Family Stone’s “Everyday People.” Music in the latter category includes freedom songs of the civil rights era such as “Everybody Says Freedom” and the legendary “We Shall Overcome.” There are also songs that provide a message of protest written in code, the most obvious example being resistance hymns of the Underground Railroad. All three of these forms of protest music play a part in the stories of resistance covered in this volume. The relationship between politics and music is a strange one. Any discussion of protest music can awaken emotions as strong as those that have driven political movements, possibly because protest music often represents the intersection of politics and fandom. Woody Guthrie was a protester, but he was also a musician with a following, as was Bob Dylan. Dylan’s switch in the 1960s to electrified music and to songs that were viewed by a disappointed fan base as an abandonment of a cause, provoked as much if not more heated discussion and protest as the music of his folk period. Dylan responded with his own form of resistance. When asked during an interview in 1966 in Stockholm why he was no longer writing and singing protest songs, Dylan answered that “Rainy Day Women #12 & 35” was “very, very protesty. And, uh, one of the protestiest of all things I ever protested against in my protest years.”3 Politics can also direct the response to music.\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

In 1949, Robeson had to run for his life in Peekskill, New York, after singing the same material. He was chased by rock throwers organized by the same political party in coordination with the Ku Klux Klan.4 The sometimes comfortable, but often uneasy relationship between politics and music is demonstrated by Craig Meyer and Todd Snyder in their chapter on the changing political rhetoric of hip-hop in the era of Barack Obama. As they point out, in the 1990s, most, if not all, politicians distanced themselves from hip-hop and rap, and often made political capital out of denouncing this form of music as violent and degenerate. Obama changed that relationship in the expression of his preference for various hip-hop songs, and his acceptance of and direct dialogue with rap artists, bringing their music into the arena of public discourse and capturing a large part of the youth vote in the process. The relationship between politics and music is also highlighted in a quote by John Morgan O’Connell, found in Paula Conlon and Paul McKenzie-Jones’s chapter on American Indian activism and powwow music. O’Connell observes that protest music both promotes conflict and attempts to find its resolution. The legendary Pete Seeger, whose presence is ubiquitous in many resistance movements—both national and international—and in a number of chapters in this volume, represents one example of this contradictory relationship. The music and activism of Seeger, promoting both aggressive challenges to the status quo and calls for peace, run like a thread through the history of protest songs in the 20th century, and even into the 21st century; for example, when Seeger made an appearance at the Occupy Movement of 2011 at Zuccotti Park in New York City. As Victor Wallis points out in his chapter on labor music, Seeger has often been strategic in his use of music; at times pouring on the message of resistance full force, and at other times watering it down to create a mass appeal. Pete’s father Charles Seeger played a key role in the revolutionary impulse of the Composers’ Collective in the early part of the 20th century and, regarding the complex relationship between politics and music, Charles later made this unsettling observation: “No one had any idea what would be the nature of ‘revolutionary music,’ you see, and it took me a long time after this to realize that there’s no such thing as revolutionary music. Music doesn’t take any cognizance of the dichotomy between revolutionary and not revolutionary.”5 The complicating factors that both connect and divide activist movements necessarily spill over into the musical aspect of resistance and include elements such as the heightened emotions of participants, the “mainstreaming” of issues and musical genres, and the racial, gender, and\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

With regard to emotions and music, these can be strong on both sides of an issue, a situation which at times leads to the strange connection of music and violence. The youth of the 1960s rebelled not only against their society and government, but also, in keeping with the tradition of younger generations, against their parents; and this rebellion was reflected in popular songs of the time. Those of the previous generation often reacted against the youths’ rebellion with enhanced patriotic fervor, reflected in military music and suppressive actions. In 1963, for example, the Fire and Police Research Association of Los Angeles called for the investigation of folk music as a tool in the subversion of American youth; demonstrations of that decade were punctuated many times by violent clashes between singing protesters and reactionaries. Music has often been viewed as a threat by the authorities it criticizes, making it a direct target for attack. Ian Michie illustrates this point in his chapter on black American resistance and protest from the antebellum period to the present, when he quotes civil rights activist John Lewis describing how prison guards taunted those jailed to “sing your goddamn freedom songs now!” Meyer and Snyder also underline this aspect of protest music in pointing out the strong reaction to the messages and aggressive nature of hip-hop music that in the 1990s led to censorship, public destruction of recordings, and denunciation by prominent politicians. Regarding the mainstreaming or commercialization of resistance music, this phenomenon has often acted as a subtle yet effective means of undermining the revolutionary strength of protest songs, especially since it tends to involve the participation of the artists themselves. Two different types of evolutions of the commercialization of protest music can be seen to take place in the more recent history of activism in the United States: musicians moving from protest to popular music and musicians incorporating protest in their already popular music. Bob Dylan and other musicians from the 1960s, along with many hip-hop artists of the 1990s fit into the former category. A large number of musicians occupy the latter category, including Harry Belafonte, Bruce Springsteen, and, more recently, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine who has moved back and forth fairly effectively between popular music and protest. While these artists have focused primarily on social and political concerns, popular musicians have also taken on broader issues such as the environment, as described by Tyson-Lord Gray in his chapter on eco-protest music of the 1970s. Joni Mitchell, Bo Diddley, and Marvin Gaye are three musicians highlighted by Gray who have addressed environmental destruction specifically in their songs. Another particularly well-known example of the adopting of a serious cause\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nIntroduction to Volume 1\n\nxv\n\nby popular musicians in the United States is the release of the song “We Are the World” in 1985, a collaboration of celebrated pop artists designed to put attention on famine in Africa (and resurrected in 2010 as “We Are the World for Haiti” following the devastating Haitian earthquake). This example, however, and some of the songs that have called attention to world pollution, demonstrate the difference between direct musical criticism of authority and oppressive policies, and a call for collective action in largely acceptable causes such as providing aid to starving Africans or awareness of global warming. The last element—racial, gender, and class divisions—represents the combination of issues and identity in protest movements. All the chapters in this volume contain some aspect of this element as it relates to resistance music. It is what makes the participants often feel that they are singing and performing to maintain their own existence as a people, class, or culture, and, in some cases, to save their own lives. Academic and activist Cornel West states,\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nIt was music that sustained Africans on the slave ships making their way from Africa to the New World . . . We had to constitute some form of comradery and community, and music did that. It preserved our sanity, as well as our dignity. . . . as a nonliterate people, we learned to manifest our genius through what no one could take away—our voices and our music.6\n\nSix chapters directly address the issues of ethnic identity and the use of music to combat attempts by the government and society to deny, suppress, and at times destroy that identity. Conlon and McKenzie-Jones describe the strong connection between activism and the music of the powwow in American Indian tradition to illustrate its major role in strongly challenging the destruction of a culture and a people by U.S. authorities whose government laws issued the disturbing mandate in the 1880s, “Kill the Indian and Save the Man.” Native children sent to federal boarding schools to cleanse them of their heritage returned to their reservations even more determined to maintain that heritage through singing and dancing in defiance of federal law. Conlon and McKenzie-Jones further describe how the powwow became a powerful expression of cultural activism in the 1960s, culminating in the formation of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and adoption of the AIM song as its anthem. Chris Aplin uses the example of three indigenous MCs—RedCloud, Quese, Imc, and Emcee One—to discuss American Indian contributions to hip-hop performance as it relates to colonial oppression and social\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction to Volume 1\n\nawareness of Native identity and culture. Each MC has his own definition of his role as activist musician. Quese puts a stress on human rights and using music to bring social awareness to the history and circumstances of his people while, at the same time, returning to his people a sense of their own power. Emcee One defines “activism” as getting people to “act,” not necessarily against authority, but against those things he believes harm his community and communities as a whole such as domestic violence, rape, drugs, alcohol, genocide, and poverty. Red Cloud is more cautious in adopting the mantle of activist, claiming that he does use his music to bring awareness to issues, but that he picks his battles. Gray connects the Environmental Movement of the 1970s with the investment of minority and indigenous groups in this cause through ecoprotest music in order to illustrate the point that environmental issues and the music that accompanies them should not be and have not been primarily the concern of white people. Examples he discusses include the Hawaiian Renaissance that protested destruction of wetlands and testing of bombs on the island of Kaho’olawe, and the cultural diversity of musical participants in the first Earth Day Celebration of 1970. He also makes the larger point of eco-protest music creating and encouraging greater knowledge and empathy regarding issues such as the toxic effects of chemicals that seeped into the water and environment of the Love Canal community in Niagara Falls, New York, exposed in 1978. Several chapters in this volume address the issues of oppression of African Americans and their response through music. Michie highlights the direct connection between slave songs that brought, in the words of Frederick Douglass, the “horrible character of slavery” to an unaware public, and the freedom songs that carried on into the civil rights era to challenge the continued oppressed condition of black people in U.S. society in terms of segregation, their limited role in government, and lack of protection from violence. Michael Jeffries makes a connection between resistance and the drug culture of the predominantly black underclass of the projects as expressed in rap and hip-hop music. The music, as he points out, in all its complex and contradictory expressions of rebelliousness, represents both an aggressive demand for attention and assistance and a statement of survival at whatever cost. Meyer and Snyder, in discussing Obama, and Michie, in tracing the continuing theme of resistance in black American communities, address hip-hop in the context of identity and culture. All three chapters explore how this genre of music reflects the feelings of disempowerment and challenges the oppression experienced by those the hip-hop songs represent. Both Michie and Jeffries also highlight the role resistance\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The relationship between music and the issue of oppression of the poor and working classes is examined in Aaron Bryant’s chapter on music and photography and the Poor People’s Campaign of the 1960s, and Wallis’s chapter on music and the labor movements of the 20th and 21st centuries. This relationship is also taken up by Matthew Sutton in his chapter on the music and activism of Woody Guthrie. Bryant illustrates the intersection of images and music as powerful creative expressions of the plight of the poor in the United States which was the last campaign led by Martin Luther King Jr. before his assassination in 1968. The Robert Houston photographs in his chapter punctuate a story that tells how King came to connect the war on poverty with anti–Vietnam activism, as he viewed the money spent this war as contradictory to attention on the plight of the poor in the United States. The chapter also illustrates how King appreciated the need to utilize the powerful effect of music on his movement, and Bryant demonstrates this specifically in Houston’s photography which captures, for example, images of musicians such as Harry Belafonte and activist–folksinger Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick, who worked closely with King early on and as part of the Poor People’s Campaign’s cultural programs. Sutton makes a strong connection between Woody Guthrie’s championing of the rights of working people, particularly farmers and immigrants hit hard by the Depression of the 1930s and the Dust Bowl, and his celebration and respect for the natural land of his country. Guthrie’s promotion of a vision of harmony between the land and working people “in the service of democracy” is spelled out in his music and performances; for example, in his tour to support Aid for Agricultural Workers in 1939, during which he stressed the need for people to have music in order to work the land and to fight against oppression. Wallis links the songs about work and organizing in labor movements with songs that express personal hardship in such a way that they unite working people through a common experience. He makes the point echoed throughout both volumes in this series that music takes a message beyond the comparatively pedestrian approach of pamphlets and speeches and, in the case of union organizing, beyond the language barriers between many of the workers, to unite its participants in a common feeling and direction.\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Charles Walton, in his chapter on women and the music of cultural resistance, discusses the relationship between music and womanhood in terms of both identity and as an expression of resistance against male oppression; and he traces this relationship against the backdrop of the history of popular music in the United States. Using examples that include musicians such as Maybelle Carter, Billie Holiday, Loretta Lynn, Patti Smith, Queen Latifah, and those in the riot grrrl movement, Walton lays out the constant challenge to female performers of positioning themselves as artists and women in an environment controlled largely by men, and how that challenge is further complicated by capitalism and media distortion of both women’s place in society and their message. Many of the issues and accompanying protest music that propelled resistance movements in the United States came together in an outburst of protest and song that marked the 1960s. The folk music tradition that characterized protest movements of earlier eras erupted in a newfound widespread popularity that shared the stage or merged with the Freedom Songs of the civil rights movement and politically conscious rock music. In the course of this decade, popular songs began to express rebellion on a large scale and the voice of popular singers such as Joan Baez served as a clarion call for social awareness and resistance to policies and laws viewed as oppressive. The growing opposition to the Vietnam War became a rallying point for musical expression and protest as the youth increasingly questioned their direct participation (by draft) in a war they saw as destructive and unnecessary. Neill Clegg examines this development in his chapter on anti–Vietnam War protest music, picking out specific songs dealing with the war and examining their message as well as their social, political, and musical impact. He argues that the music and protest represented an antidraft movement as much as it acted as an antiwar movement. Clegg further puts forward the proposition that, although their popular appeal brought attention to issues of war and peace, in many ways, the protest songs that targeted the Vietnam War had more of an impact on popular music than they did on the war itself. Activists have never been slow to recognize the unifying effect of music. Phil Ochs, a musician specifically discussed in Clegg’s chapter, expressed the motivation of protest singers shared throughout the history of resistance\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nIntroduction to Volume 1\n\nxix\n\nwhen he stated, “One good song with a message can bring a point more deeply to more people than a thousand rallies.” Ochs also said, “A protest song is a song that’s so specific that you cannot mistake it for bullshit.”7 That is the unusual power of a protest song. Music, furthermore, is a particularly difficult thing to suppress. Sheet music and recordings can be destroyed or censored, but if the tune or words remain in people’s memories, it is very difficult to completely eradicate them or their message, unless, ironically, by overkill which is what often makes commercialization the most effective means of weakening the force of resistance music. The pattern of the relationship of resistance music to authority can be seen as similar to that of resistance itself to authority: the music at first flies under the radar of the system, drawing attention in small pockets of alternative venues; it then becomes popular enough to threaten the system; the system suppresses then co-opts the music; and, after a while, the music reformulates itself and once again flies under the radar of the system. Such has arguably been the tradition of music and resistance in the United States. Each of the following chapters in this volume tells the story of one particular aspect of that tradition.\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nNotes 1.

The Caribbean, Africa, Latin America, and above all black America contributed to our lived sense of racial self. The urban context in which these forms were encountered cemented their stylistic appeal and facilitated their solicitation of our identification. They were important also as a source for the discourses of blackness with which we located our own struggles and experiences. —Paul Gilroy1 What you’re looking at is a culture of people so in love with life that they can’t stop fighting for it—people who’ve seen death up close, literal death, but also the kind of dormancy and stagnation that kills your spirit. They’ve seen it all around them and they don’t want any part of that shit, not at all. They want to live like they want to live—they want to impose themselves on the world through their art, with their voices. This impulse is what saved us. It’s what saved me. —Jay Z2\n\nIn 1845, Fredrick Douglass wrote of the songs he would hear slaves sing on their way to complete errands for their home plantation in Talbot County,\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\n2\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nMaryland. The duty was considered a privilege, and, as Douglass describes it, the entrusted group would “make the dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness.”3 The slaves would invent the songs as they traveled “consulting neither time nor tune,” combining their shared experience to produce “the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone.” At the time of hearing these sounds Douglass was unconscious of their complex meaning, believing that the songs only conveyed the sentiment of joy at being released from the daily toil of the plantation. But writing in later years Douglass understood the true significance of the improvised slave songs, believing that those “wild songs” ingrained the first notions of the dehumanizing effects of slavery into his conscious self. Douglass considered slaves songs as one of the most effective tools in bringing the “horrible character of slavery” to the unaware public. “Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains,” Douglass writes, “those songs still follow me to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.”4 Douglass, the preeminent African American abolitionist and philosopher, recognized the conscious expression of resistance in the slave songs he heard, but he also understood that in slave society overt expressions of resistance usually met with severe retaliation from the planter authority. The songs he heard were presented in improvised, inconsistent, and contradictory language thus providing multiple meanings that covertly conveyed the cruel and dehumanizing effects of slavery. African Americans had employed this form of expression since the 17th century, using musical structures imported from Africa to generate communal idioms that resisted the imperial planter authority from a position of severe disadvantage. The songs, however, endured the institution of slavery, providing a vital element of collective communication to a segment of society that had few other means of communal resistance. Songs such as the ones Douglass heard on his Maryland plantation provided a foundation for black American music through which a thread of resistance toward white American authority has run unbroken into the 21st century. Resistance in African American music existed well before Douglass’s writings, with idiomatic musical expressions traveling with slaves from Africa and combining with the conditions of Anglican Christian slave society to form a distinctive language of communal experience. Slave songs, which informed the creation of spirituals, conveyed the sentiment of resistance in implicit terms, often disguising the desire for freedom in the\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Freedom songs, often less implicit than slave songs, nevertheless expressed a desire for inclusion in the American franchise, freedom from the restrictions of segregation, and a legitimized voice in the political process. Themes of freedom and inclusion linked these two forms of African American music, motivating endurance in the struggle to gain access to an equal standing in American life. A turning point occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As Douglass’s account attests the passively resistant character of slave songs, spirituals, and freedom songs do not make them any less powerful idiomatic tools, but because of the severely marginalized position planter culture, and later segregationism, place them in, African Americans found few viable opportunities for direct and active confrontation toward the plantation franchise. The music, therefore, reflected an expression that worked within the strictures of the oppressive social system. Many black activists of the 1960s and 1970s were seeking to break those strictures. Events and developments such as the assassination of Martin Luther King, the escalation of the Vietnam War, the confrontational rhetoric of African American leaders such as Malcolm X, and the creation of the revolutionary leftist Black Panther Party, influenced a sentiment of renewed nonpassive resistance against American oppression toward blacks. Musical forms began to reflect this sentiment more frequently, allowing for overt expressions of resistance, often improvised, in a style that conveyed the anger and frustration of black American life. From this reformed interpretation of black resistance music emerged rap and hip-hop that often addressed issues of identity, culture, and violence in inner-city black communities. To many black artists the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did little to relieve the inequality experienced by blacks in American society, and they now expressed their disillusion in direct and confrontational terms creating an overt language that many believe is the most effective expression of black identity and resistance. The late 1960s and 1970s marked the time when African American resistance music transformed from a passive expression of resistance to an active rejection of the white American social system. The message went from being a call for inclusion to one of extreme disenchantment that directly confronted racism and threatened revolution. The transformation was not immediate; themes of resistance had gradually emerged and strengthened\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n4\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nduring slavery, through the Jim Crow era, and into the civil right movement, but the disillusionment experienced after the apex of the civil rights movement informed a denunciation of American culture by many African Americans, which is directly reflected in current forms of black activist rap and hip-hop.\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Du Bois wrote that “by fateful chance the Negro folk song—the rhythmic cry of the slave—stands today not simply as the sole American music, but as the most beautiful expression of human experience born this side of the seas.”5 Douglass thought of them as “altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish.”6 Diarist Mary Boykin Chestnut described the experience of hearing a camp meeting hymn: “To me this is the saddest of all earthly music, weird and depressing beyond my powers to describe.”7 White Southern author Eliza Frances Andrews reinforced these experiences by portraying the songs as “mostly a sort of weird chant that make me feel all out of myself when I hear it way in the night, too far off to catch the words.”8 These descriptions allow for an imagined sense of what it was like to hear the songs within their context. But the meaning of the songs was often lost on their audience. Du Bois was frustrated with those who misunderstood the songs’ meanings, which he called “the articulate message of the slave to the world.”9 To Du Bois’s mind the songs may have been be perceived as careless and at times happy but were actually “the music of an unhappy people, the children of disappointment,” telling of “death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.”10 In the songs the slave resisted his or her position in life, hoping for a better life either on earth or in heaven. Du Bois writes that “Through all the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope—a faith in the ultimate justice of things, the meaning is always clear: that sometime, somewhere, men will judge men by their souls and not by their skins.”11 Du Bois, writing these words in the early 19th century, used the slave songs as an example of the injustice he still saw in the world around him; thus, the song allowed for an evaluation of the treatment of blacks in the time of slavery and in succeeding generations. While the emotional delivery of the slave songs appears to have been poignant to those who heard them, a tangible and consistent element of direct\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The introduction of Christianity to African American communities brought biblical interpretations of suffering, redemption, forgiveness, and reward to black music in the form of spirituals, but historians and sociologists disagree on the degree to which slaves used spirituals to openly express resistance. On the one hand scholars such as Lawrence Levine assert that spirituals are the primary evidence in understanding the slaves’ world view because they “afforded them the possibility of both adapting to and transcending their situation.”12 Other scholars point to work songs, word games, and play songs as equally important in that they were more apt to display satire and humor, allowing for a more complete picture of slave imagination culture. Regarding this cloudy understanding historian John White concludes that “the slave spirituals, like other ‘black sources,’ offer ambiguous, ambivalent and incomplete testimony concerning the slave experience.” White goes on to describe this two-sided coin by stating “Afro-American slave religion simultaneously provided rationalizations for a submissiveness that allowed the sufferer to embrace the divinity of the martyred Savior and the apocalyptic vision and retributive actions of a Nat Turner.”13 This sentiment is fully expressed in the description of African American religious music during and after slavery. The songs could radiate great hope and extreme despair seemingly at the same time. Ethnomusicologist Ronald Radano further underscores the intricacy of the songs’ meaning by observing that they “may have represented the sonic evidence of a more performative gesture that incorporated a variety of bodily action, from singing to acting to stepping out.”14 These elements taken together could allow the song and the performance to mean many different things to a variety of audiences, inviting evaluation of the black American condition on several interpretive levels. Whether slave songs and spirituals promoted submissiveness in black populations or provided an instrument for distinct self-expression, most observers agree that the inequality inherent in the slave and segregation eras found a conscious outlet in the delivery if not always the verbal message of the songs. W.E.B. Du Bois called them “sorrow songs,” in that the singers “walked in darkness, for they were weary at heart.”15 In Du Bois’s interpretation the music he heard came from a place of despair that related directly to the dehumanizing conditions of slavery. James Weldon Johnson, co-composer of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” which was for some time regarded as the Negro National Anthem, viewed the creation of spirituals in a somewhat different light. In the spirituals, many of which had become standards by Johnson’s day, the author found incomparable nobility. “I have termed this music noble,” Johnson writes, “and I do so\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n6\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nwithout qualifications. Take for example Go Down, Moses; there is not a nobler theme in the whole musical literature of the world. If the Negro had voiced himself in only that one song, it would have been evidence of his nobility of soul.”16 Johnson produced a two-volume anthology of African American spirituals in which he traced a direct line from African musical forms to the songs he presented in his book. He criticized those who regarded the songs as amusements asserting that “such people have no conception of the Spirituals. They probably thought of them as a new sort of ragtime of minstrel song. These songs cannot be properly appreciated or understood unless they are clothed in their primitive dignity.”17 Johnson is attempting to redirect attention away from the vaudevillian and minstrelsy reception of the songs whose meaning had, through white interpretation and rationalization, transgressed into one of childlike nostalgia for the Old South. Johnson, a prominent Harlem Renaissance activist, promoted the songs’ true dignity in an effort to rehabilitate the traditional African heritage that created such an expressive and influential art form. His anthology contains over 300 songs, the lines of which employ: great play for their powers of graphic description. The stories are always dramatic and the pictures vivid and gorgeously colored. The style, in contradiction of the general idea of Negro diffuseness, is concise and condensed. It might be said that every line is a picture.18\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nMoses plays a predominant role in many of the songs, reinforcing the notion of American slaves’ identification with the People of Israel and physical as well as spiritual emancipation. “Go Down, Moses” offers the verse: Go Down, Moses, Way down in Egypt land, Tell ole Pharaoh, Let my people go.19\n\nThe line “Let my people go” has unmistakable double meaning in the context of slavery, and many other songs such as “Steal Away to Jesus” reiterate the sentiment of escape from bondage, which calls for a homecoming: Steal away, steal away, Steal away to Jesus. Steal away, steal away home, I ain’t got long to stay here.20\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n“Toward a Truer World”\n\n7\n\nThe notion of a temporary condition permeates the spirituals in Johnson’s book. The themes of displacement so present in Old Testament stories held particular significance for the creators of these songs. Death, redemption, and independence all take on similar importance as salvation offers freedom from slavery either in the form of emancipation or the spiritual passing into the next world. The messages vary between uplift of the spirit at the promise of heavenly reward to the trials of living in the earthly realm. “Nobody Knows the Trouble I See” laments the seemingly irrevocable condition of earthly temptation, but can also be interpreted as a cry for relief from the trials of slavery:\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nNobody knows the trouble I see, Lord Nobody knows like Jesus. Brothers, will you pray for me, Brothers will you pray for me, Brothers will you pray for me, An’ help me drive ole Satan away.21\n\n“I’m Troubled in Mind” also calls on Jesus to offer redemption to a soul who is “ladened wid trouble an’ burdened wid grief.”22 Forgiveness is less of a theme than salvation in many of these songs, as if the authors were appealing for a softening to their burden of suffering rather than pardon for past behavior. In “Nobody Knows the Trouble I See” the narrator asks Jesus to drive ole Satan away but does not say if Satan is the tempter or simply the cause of the narrator’s pain. Interpretation of these appeals could include an implied critique of the conditions of slavery by the author with characters such as Pharaoh and Satan representing the oppressor, in this case the slave system, and the paternal characters such as God, Moses, and Jesus acting as representatives, leaders, and redeemers for an otherwise disenfranchised population. While the interpretation of slave songs and spirituals lent themselves to assertions of black identity and nationalism for authors like Douglass, Du Bois, and Johnson, it would be overly presumptive to regard the songs as primarily overt songs of resistance against slavery. Above all, the songs served a religious purpose, addressing a distinctive set of circumstances for a distinctive American population. Themes of redemption, salvation, independence, justice, exoneration, and vindication abound in white Christian forms of religious expression as well as black, indicating a communal desire to transcend the earthly trials of life. But the creation of so many spirituals in the black Christian tradition with themes such as coming home and\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n8\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nstealing away to freedom do allow for the identification of complex and multiple political meanings beneath the surface of the songs’ religious context. As African American Studies professor Craig Werner states: “The use of double meanings, accessible only to those attuned to the cultural code, developed as a survival strategy.”23 To Du Bois the final message was clear, that the songs expressed a deep desire that one day, like God, society would judge men by quality of their soul rather than the color of their skin.\n\nGospel and Freedom Songs In 1933, Zora Neale Hurston wrote of the lack of authenticity in contemporaneous performances of spirituals, particularly by whites, but also by black performers of spirituals such as the Fisk Jubilee Singers who enjoyed worldwide acclaim in the late 19th and early 20th century. Hurston asserts, “The spirituals that have been sung around the world are Negroid to be sure, but so full of musicians’ tricks that Negro congregations are highly entertained when they hear their old songs so changed.”24 The delivery was so full of embellishments that the songs became hard to recognize to the source from which they originated. What Hurston calls the “Glee Club” style had:\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\ngone on so long and become so fixed among concert singers that it is considered quite authentic. But I say again, that not one concert singer in the world is singing the songs as the Negro songmakers sing them. If anyone wishes to prove the truth of this let him step into some unfashionable negro church and hear for himself.25\n\nThe “unfashionable negro churches” Hurston speaks of continued the tradition of the spiritual by producing exalted forms of religious expression that directly related to their condition as patient but active recipients of God’s reward. From the time of Hurston’s writing black gospel music, a continuation of spiritual song writing and singing from the slave and post– Civil War eras, has influenced American culture as well as activism within the black community immeasurably. Ethnomusicologist Portia K. Maultsby traces the impact of black gospel music on 20th century culture by asserting that the distribution of the music through media such as radio stations and record companies as well as performances in large concert halls, theaters, and festivals produced a secular audience apart from the congregations from which the music originated.26 While other forms of African American music developed and became popular during the 20th century, most significantly blues and jazz,\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\n“Toward a Truer World”\n\n9\n\nblack gospel music did the most to provide a musical language that sustained the civil rights movement and augmented the rhetoric of resistance so prevalent in the era. The combination of gospel’s messages of uplift and perseverance and the advancements in audio and radio technology gave the voice of African American resistance a much wider and responsive audience than in the preceding century. The reverberation of sentiments that had survived since slavery worked to reinvigorate activism against Jim Crow and segregationist attitudes. Black gospel singers, perhaps more so than their jazz counterparts, became international celebrities, and gospel’s lyrical idiom could more directly express sentiments of resistance than many instrumental jazz forms. Gospel ultimately informed the freedom marches of the 1950s and 1960s, providing familiar ballast to a leadership that had gained prominence in southern black churches. The transformation from spiritual, to gospel, and then to freedom song was direct and did not require significant retooling. The message was still one of a community that maintained its solidarity and resistance through strong spiritual conviction, unified expressions of hope, and continuity of community tradition. African American historian Craig Werner asserts that if Martin Luther King gave the civil rights movement a vision, gospel singer Mahalia Jackson “gave it a voice.”27 Jackson became a celebrity among blacks in the 1960s and hosted a weekly radio show on CBS that exposed whites to black gospel music around America. She occasionally crossed over into pop music, but managed to stay true to her gospel roots, which she had absorbed growing up in poverty in Louisiana and Chicago. Jackson’s music came from what Werner refers to as “sanctified churches,” which “valued religious ecstasy more highly than polished phrasing or perfect pitch.” Werner describes the highly charged atmosphere during these church services stating: “at times, a sanctified church could erupt with a collective energy that transformed centuries of bitter hardship into moments of pure connection—with self, community, and the soul-deep presence of the Lord.”28 Jackson’s appeal reached a crossover audience as well, allowing rural whites access to black music that they could only previously experience by attending a sanctified church service. In 1955, during the Montgomery bus boycott, King and Ralph Abernathy asked Jackson if she would use her voice to support their struggle. She began performing at rallies around Montgomery despite physical threats by racist whites. Gospel music reinforced Jackson and many others’ resolve in not giving in to the white power structure. Jackson continued to lend her voice to the movement, and in 1963 made her famous appearance at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in which King\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n10\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\ndelivered his defining “I Have a Dream” speech. Jackson sang Clara Ward’s “How I Got Over,” which echoed the spirituals’ message of perseverance toward heavenly reward through the Savior’s guidance: How I got over How I got over You know my soul looks back and wonder How I got over\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nI’m gon’ wear a di-garment In that New Jerusalem I’m gonna walk the streets of gold In that homeland of the soul.29\n\nAs Werner asserts “When Mahalia sings that she’s going to make her heaven home, she’s most certainly singing about saving her soul. But she’s also, and without any sense of contradiction, singing about freedom, moving up to full participation in American society.”30 American commentator Studs Terkel recalled a conversation with Jackson where “she explained to me that the spiritual wasn’t simply about Heaven over there, ‘A City Called Heaven.’ No the city is here, on Earth. And so, as we know, slave songs were code songs. It was not a question of getting to Heaven, but rather to the free state of Canada or a safe city in the North—liberation here on earth!”31 Jackson carried these codes, less implicit but still working under the suppression of an often hostile and violent white majority, and employed them in her delivery at Montgomery, Washington, and other locations where she sang for the movement. She tailored the message to fit the demands of the struggle, that of political and social equality for African Americans. This adaptation of expression carried over to direct activism by the civil rights movement’s youth factions who used music to sustain them as they staged protests, marches, sit-ins and cross-country journeys to bring awareness to their cause. Perhaps the most effective of these organized protests were the Freedom Rides of the early 1960s. Organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), young black and white men and women took part in the protests, which defied segregation by having multiracial groups openly ride forms of segregated public transportation in the South. They often broke laws, which led to jail time during which they would use music, frequently borrowed and adapted from spirituals, to sustain them. “Singing was a way of releasing tension,” says Freedom Rider Ernest “Rip” Patton Jr., “so we did a lot of singing, a lot of the songs came from old spirituals, they just changed the words to fit whatever was going on at that time.”32\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n“Toward a Truer World”\n\n11\n\nJim Zwerg, also a freedom ride participant, demonstrates the spontaneous quality of the singing claiming that an adapted verse came to him for the folk song “Eyes on the Prize” and he sang it as he boarded a segregated bus, inserting “Riding on this big Greyhound (bus)” in the lyrics.33 CORE member Ernest Patton reiterates this notion of experiential spontaneity, demonstrating how protesters altered the songs to strengthen the resolve of the group with words such as:\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nAin’t gonna let nobody turn me around Turn me around, turn me around Ain’t gonna let nobody turn me around I’m gonna keep on walkin’ Keep on talkin’ Walking up the King’s highway34\n\nPatton’s variation on a spiritual melody still holds fast to certain elements of African American musical expressions of resistance. The “King’s highway” has both a spiritual and political meaning in the verse, allowing the notion of defiance of the oppressing political power, the king’s highway in secular terms, while acknowledging the presence of the true King, God, whose highway ultimately leads to vindication and equality. During the civil rights era, messages such Patton’s and Zwerg’s became more explicit, although direct political expression could still result in severe retaliation. White authority now had no trouble in identifying the songs’ significance. This often brought stricter punishment and intimidation tactics for protesters who spent time in jail for their activism. John Lewis recalls, “You get to the prison, a guard gets out with his rifle drawn and he says something like ‘sing your goddamn freedom songs now!’ ”35 The protesters would ignore this intimidation. Hank Thomas who was not deterred by the jailers’ threats recalls, “because I wouldn’t stop singing I got put in solitary confinement three different times.”36 Patton remembers that the jailed activists would use music to communicate from cell to cell: “We had a small group in our jail cell, and we had a quartet and I was part of the quartet, and we would sing to the ladies late at night when things were quiet.” Patton sings a verse that promises continued unity: I know, I know we’ll meet again, I know, I know we’ll meet again, I know, I know we’ll meet again, Someday.37\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\n12\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nPatton explains “the reason for that singing was to let them know that we were okay, and then they would sing back to us and then they would let us know that they were okay.”38 Guards would retaliate in various ways. “If they wanted to stop our singing or control our behavior they would take the mattresses,” remembers Joan Mulholland to which Bernard Lafayette Jr. adds, “We’d say [singing] You can take our mattresses, oh yes, you can take our mattresses, oh yes, [ends singing] we’d start piling mattresses at the door, so we were with the program, we were still gonna sing, and we continued to sing.”39 Singing Freedom Songs became the primary form of communication in these protesters’ experience. Similar to slave songs and spirituals of their ancestors they contained the combined elements of being both a soothing activity to lessen the burden of their singers’ condition and a direct expression of resistance to oppression. Like Fredrick Douglass’s traveling slaves, the Freedom Riders combined tradition with spontaneous adaptation to relate their experience as it occurred in the present. As Lafayette relates, “Music put us in harmony with each other, gave us support for each other, and we relished the opportunity, even if you didn’t have a great voice it didn’t matter, you could hum, so everybody would sing.”40 John Lewis also notes the importance of Freedom Songs to the movement stating, “singing, the music, became a powerful non-violent instrument, I’ve often said without the music, without the singing, we would have lost the sense of solidarity, it gave us hope in a time of hopelessness.”41 The music also brought adapted spirituals and gospel music into the mainstream of American political consciousness. At the same time it reinforced notions of a black nationalist identity proposed by writers such as Du Bois and the cultural assertions of the Harlem Renaissance. White recording artists such as Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, and Joan Baez helped popularize the music while becoming heavily influenced by its style and message. Songs such as “We Shall Overcome” and “Keep Your Eye on the Prize,” became symbols of resistance to an unequal social system. Freedom songs still employed traditional forms of expression in African American music, but the broadcasting of the civil rights movement into the living rooms of America by major news networks allowed the songs to be viewed, perhaps for the first time, primarily for their political message. While the music opened many Americans’ eyes to the struggles of the civil rights movement it also laid the groundwork for what would become an increasingly open and direct criticism of America in black American music. The civil rights movement helped bring traditional spiritual black music to the mainstream by transmitting voices such as Mahalia Jackson’s into the\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

At the same time rhythm and blues borrowed gospel forms to broaden the audience further to American radio stations that catered to an often younger generation. Artists who, like Jackson, honed their talents in church settings, began to emerge on American Rock and Roll and R&B stations and continued to echo sentiments of resistance to the unequal social system. Ray Charles, Otis Redding, and Aretha Franklin brought a gospel background to their performances and while radio stations in the early 1960s were reluctant to play songs with overtly political lyrics, the consciousness of America toward black struggles raised by leaders such as King and Jackson allowed for implied messages to surface. Otis Redding’s 1965 “Respect” tells of a relationship where one member is not getting the respect he deserves, but the politically charged title and refrain also imply a persistent disrespect by white society for blacks.42 In the voice of Aretha Franklin the song became a gendered political statement that found (and still finds) resonance in practically all forms of political resistance to the status quo. Franklin furthered her message in a 1968 song called “Think” in which she asks her lover to stop and think about what he is actually doing to damage their relationship. This is a common theme in popular music, and on its own does not necessarily indicate a political agenda, but the refrain of “freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom!” sung in an ascending scale with increasing timbre allows a reevaluation of the song as a direct political assertion toward genuine equality in American society.43 By the time of the release of “Think,” politics had become a staple in much of popular music’s message, and the end of the 1960s marked a critical point in African American music as disillusionment toward the nonviolent protest strategy employed by Martin Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other organizations gave way to anger and frustration over blacks’ continued mistreatment by the white establishment. The civil rights movement had given rise to an increasing reevaluation of what it meant to be black in America, and the creation of several black studies programs at U.S. universities encouraged an embracing of African and African American heritage and rejected the American mainstream, which, it was thought, sought to eliminate an authentic African identity through assimilation. Direct assertions of identity became more prominent than sentiments of inclusion and participation. Along with Franklin’s “Think,” 1968 saw the release of Soul singer James Brown’s “Say it Loud—I’m Black and I’m Proud,” which called for black empowerment in language that in no way was couched or veiled with vague meaning. The song asserts: we demand a chance to do things for ourselves.44\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n14\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nBrown’s song was strengthened by his use of the call and response style, using children—the future generation—to affirm his declaration and drive home the point that direct black cultural assertion and resistance was now a permanent element of American culture.\n\nCopyright © 2013.

The organization’s leader Elijah Muhammad preached on the total rejection of white society, paramilitary training for black youths, and the creation of autonomous black institutions. Malcolm X’s candid anger at the injustice of American society resonated with blacks but alarmed many whites who could more readily receive the nonviolent appeals of Martin Luther King when considering equality. Malcolm X disputed that American liberalism aided blacks in their struggle. In 1964, he declared, “No, I’m not American. I’m one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy.”45 These sentiments would reverberate with many other youth activists whom historian Gary Gerstle observes, “formed an articulate vanguard, their stature enhanced by a national television media corps that couldn’t resist showcasing them in news broadcasts and documentaries.”46 Rather than reaching out to an aspiring middle class of blacks who called for assimilative integration into the political process, Elijah Muhammad and Malcom X sought to influence a younger, angrier, more urban population. As Gerstle states: “these organizations possessed indirect but powerful links to tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of poor and restive blacks living in impoverished and isolated ghettoes in northern and western cities.”47 It was in this geographical locality, black nationalists argued, that blacks were the most underserved by the civil rights movement. As nationalists attempted to provide the population with a political voice, disenfranchised urban environments gave rise to alternate modes of dress, speech, economy, and artistic expression. Music particularly took on a directly political tone, and overt, often angry, political expression became an integral part of urban artistic creation. As anthropologist John F. Szwed states in his attempt to define the origins of rap, “Rap is rhythmic talk, talk leaning toward music.” Szwed locates the difference with English language in rap by stating: “Rap departs from the regular stresses of English, redeploys them, making the sounds and words jump to the superimposed beat. It retunes English, causing pitch\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n“Toward a Truer World”\n\n15\n\nand stress to move independently, making speech appear even less speechlike and more musical.”48 This transformation of language resulted directly from the influence of black ministers and orators who would speak in a performative style that employed rhythm to add emphasis and multiple meanings to their speech. Along with ministers, Szwed credits toastmasters, radio DJs, and celebrities such as boxer Muhammad Ali as allowing an assertion of spontaneous rhythmic speech to emerge in the 1970s. Like Szwed, musicologist William C. Banfield also locates the origins of rap in earlier performative speech, especially in DJs “whose music grew out of the Jamaican tradition of rapping over the beat breaks of old James Brown and other 1960s–1970s R&B records.”49 While these influences were often more directed at entertainment than resistance and political action, the combination of cultural forces, as in the days of slavery and segregation, allowed multiple interpretations and deliveries. Artists who continued to witness injustice in American urban environments in the 1970s began to use rap as a new mode of political expression that allowed an outlet for freeform and spontaneous social criticism. Sociologist Theresa A. Martinez argues that “present day African American popular cultural expression is yet another form of oppositional culture in the face of perceived institutional discrimination, racial formation, and urban decay.” She goes on to assert that\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\npolitical and gangsta rap of the late 1980s and early 1990s was an ardent form of resistance and definite expression of oppositional culture, bringing to light long perceived problems in our nation’s inner cities, and effectively heralding the 1992 Los Angeles riots that shocked a nation and a globe.50\n\nMartinez explains that current discourses on rap frequently conclude it to be the most prevalent form of cultural resistance and survival within the dominant culture, but, similar to slave spirituals before it, the art form often appears contradictory. Working within an exploitive, materialistic and commoditized industry model (much like slavery and sharecropping) rap still allows for a serious evaluation of social injustice by managing, in the words of activist and journalist Clarence Lusane, to “deconstruct and destroy racist images of black youth while at the same time construct a new humanity and society that is more egalitarian and just than the one in which they live and function.”51 The assertion of aspirations toward a society where blacks enjoy equality and autonomy within dominant American culture informs this deconstruction of the former black nonviolent resistance and reinforces young urban black identity as the harbinger of the new humanity of which Lusane writes. Maneuvering in the “contradictory and tense space” of\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Although rap presents a much more overt assertion of resistance to cultural and political hegemony it still operates within a capitalist mode of distribution just as slave spirituals resisted through Christian modes of conveyance. Their similarities lie in this characteristic: the ability to use the hegemonic constraints to form their own modes of resistance that is then directed back at mainstream culture. One distinguishing difference between the two is the increased language of violence present in many forms of rap. While the language of violent revolt is not new in African American history, communicating it publically was not usually viable in most African American communities until the last half of the 20th century. During the Reagan era of the 1980s and early 1990s, urban environments became increasingly violent and impoverished while law enforcement, perceived as the strong arm of oppression, became a major target for rap lyrics.52 Groups such Public Enemy and N.W.A. (Niggas With Attitudes) addressed problems in the inner city and police, culminating in N.W.A.’s 1989 release of “Fuck tha Police,” which predicted a violent resolution to police harassment, stating he’s “a young nigga” on the warpath and, when he’s finished, “it’s gonna be a bloodbath of cops dying in L.A.”53 Ice Cube, a member of N.W.A., and other urban rappers wrote lyrics that predicted a series of revolts in Los Angeles and in retaliation for political and economic disenfranchisement of blacks in the inner city. African American Studies scholar Donn C. Worgs calls these lyrics “fantasies of violent revolt,” and theorizes that they act as ways for black youths to “seize or reconstruct their humanity” concluding that essential component has been a “persistent element in the black imagination.” Worgs’s assertion underscores the concept that the definition of identity and nationhood in African American culture based on nonhegemonic self-description is a recurrent and enduring theme in black resistance music.54 A direct connection between slave spirituals and rap music may be found in the understudied but increasingly popular form of gospel rap. Belonging to a group referred to as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM), gospel rap grew out of a push in the late 1960s and 1970s by Christians, mainly youths, to retool traditional conveyances of Christian themes. The music held appeal for young Christians who responded to a combination of evangelical presentation and rock and roll arrangements, and while conservative church leaders struggled at the time to maintain established forms of worship, CCM has become an influential and profitable industry with record\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

This has caused criticism from religious leaders and secular rap artists alike with one claiming a corruption of traditional church values and the other claiming a lack of authenticity in gospel rap’s message and presentation.56 When seen as simply a way to appeal to younger worshipers, gospel rap may have less to do with resistance than secular forms of the genre. A reevaluation of black churches, though, where messages of resistance persisted and informed the civil rights movement in gospel music, can provide exegesis into the implied forms of resistant expression found in the new genre. Black churches can be viewed as having two fundamental functions, that of the priestly and the prophetic. The priestly function provides traditional symbols, modes of worship, and community activities to strengthen the congregation’s relationship with the Deity.57 In this form, the church is not seen as direct commentator on secular matters, but as a separate community whose function is to provide a direct connection to the spiritual realm. In the prophetic form the church is more “focused on societal problems and considers the church a mechanism for social, economic, and political liberation.”58 Prophetic churches view their relationship with God as being intrinsically tied to active involvement in the outside community. To be a successful member of a prophetic congregation activism must accompany faith, and political commentary may be related from the pulpit to resist and critique secular institutions in society. Within this prophetic tradition gospel rap emerged as an extension of societal interpretation. As one gospel rap artist puts it: “Holy hip hop is the language of this generation . . . to filter the gospel in a form of parable to music. Isaiah said God was going to do a new thing, the people preaching aren’t the messengers your parents listened to, the message—living a positive life, being a man for God or a virtuous woman—is the same.”59 Sandra L. Barnes concludes in her study of rap and religion that “gospel rap artists use this music medium to evangelize to young audiences who are interested in both Christianity and the hip hop culture and contend that gospel rap is a viable, valid, and effective Christian expression on par with spirituals, gospels, and hymns.”60 Barnes asserts that rap in a church setting may indicate “new appropriations of Black Church culture for contemporary times and contemporary challenges.”61 As secular rap acts as a transformative and humanizing practice, gospel rap, bridging the implied resistance\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n18\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nof spirituals and gospels with overt style and activism of hip hop culture, has the potential to provide just as valid a transformation for black youths through the prophetic form of worship. In writing of the group of men singing as they traveled to the plantation house Fredrick Douglass remarked on the spontaneous quality of their songs. The lyrics sprang up from an experiential quality in the slaves’ lives, one that directly confronted their surroundings and condition but masked their critique in vague, contradictory terms. Their resistance remained coded in language and presentation that connected the group in implied meaning yet fooled others around them, even their fellow slave Douglass. As 19th-century commentators observed the haunting, sorrowful sounds of slave songs many were moved toward sympathy, but as James Weldon Johnson asserted, slave spirituals did not have to indicate a pitiable condition as he located nobility and dignity in the hundreds of spirituals he collected. This dignity carried over into the 20th century with the emergence of gospel as one of the driving forces behind the successes of the civil rights movement. Frustration and violence marked the end of the 20th century for blacks, most prominently in poor inner cities, and with the violence came direct expressions of resistance that reclaimed an African American identity in the form of rap and hip-hop culture. While rap has been mainstreamed to a point where it may be considered past its political potency, resistance is still present in implicit and explicit terms. African American culture has reacted to diverse and challenging conditions with music for four centuries, culminating in a complex relationship between American hegemony and transformative assertion. Each stage of African American resistance has transformed not only African American life but American life in general.\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nNotes 1.

ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nPaula Conlon and Paul McKenzie-Jones\n\nThe AIM Song, considered the national anthem of the American Indian Movement (AIM), continues to generate an outpouring of memories about fighting for Native rights wherever and whenever the song is performed. Much of the song’s power, however, derives from the vibrant relationship that activism and the powwow have shared from long before the AIM Song became a siren call to disaffected American Indians and captured the imagination of the general public. As noted by anthropologist William Powers, Plains music and dance have become symbolic of American Indian resistance to the adoption of Euro-American culture since the turn of the 20th century.1 This chapter will look beyond the myth that American Indian activism rode on the coattails of the 1960s civil rights movement. The initial growth of Native activism was a reaction against EuroAmerican interference and misinterpretation of Native cultural life, showcased in Wild West shows and World Fairs at the turn of the 20th century. In contrast, the intertribal powwow that spread across the continent provided a means for Native people to network and share experiences. For many Native activists, powwow music and dance have been the embodiment of their cultural past and formed the bedrock of their identity, dating from prereservation tribal military societies through the reservation and allotment eras to the present day. The multilayered cultural event that became the modern intertribal powwow was used to honor Native veterans at the end of the Second World\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\n22\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nWar in the mid-1940s, which contributed to the decision to formally revive many of the Plains warrior societies. This in turn fostered the renewal of tribal ceremonials that took place outside of the powwow circuit. The music and dance performed at these powwows and ceremonials reinvigorated a sense of nationalism that carried over into the political arena. These artistic expressions became the thrust that resulted in the activist movements of the 1960s and 1970s that fought for the right of tribal self-determination, founded on cultural expression of traditional values exemplified by prayer songs at the drum to open and close political meetings. Tara Browner, Choctaw ethnomusicology professor and longtime powwow dancer, begins her Native American music classes at the University of California Los Angeles by defining the powwow as an event where “American Indians of all nations gather together to celebrate their culture through music and dance.”2 The emblematic drum group, considered the “heart beat” of the powwow, is made up of 10 to 12 male drummer/ singers seated around a large, wooden-framed drum. Behind the men, female singers join in later in the song at a higher pitch (usually using octave displacement). Honor beats—a succession of hard drum beats—occur at predefined places in the song to honor the drum and cue the dancers. Dancers interact with the honor beats in various ways defined by their style of dance.3 For instance, the men’s straight dance style accentuates the act of bending over and peering at the ground during the honor beats, to symbolize hunting for animal tracks. The AIM Song typifies the basic powwow song structure of lead (head singer begins the first line of the song); second (the rest of the male drummer/singers join in the song); first chorus (“A” section of the song); honor beats (strong drumbeats); second chorus (“B” section of the song); repetition of the entire song (often four times through); tail (“coda” or final section, a repetition of the second chorus); and a short series of strong drumbeats to end the song. The AIM Song also typifies classic Plains singing, featuring a tense, tight vocal style; melodic phrases exhibiting “tumbling strain” contours that begin on a high pitch and drop drastically lower over the course of the song; the presence of minor third intervals between pitches; repetitions of the most prominent note at the end of the song; frequent rapid changes in pitch and volume along with pulsation of notes; and mostly unison singing accompanied by one large drum played by several people.4 Reflecting the birth of AIM in the Minnesota area, the AIM Song exhibits the Northern style powwow song features of a high male vocal range and hard drumbeats. Northern songs (from the central and northern Plains\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nRed Power\n\n23\n\nand Great Lakes regions) are contrasted with Southern songs, synonymous with Oklahoma and featuring a lower male vocal range and less strident drumbeats. Competitive powwow dance styles are similarly associated with their region of origin. Northern “drums” (referring to a powwow singing group) are used for the women’s northern buckskin, jingle dress, and fancy shawl dance, and for the men’s northern traditional, grass dance, and northern fancy dance. Southern drums are used for the women’s southern cloth and southern buckskin, and for the men’s straight dance and southern fancy dance. Noncompetitive social powwow dances, accompanied by either Northern or Southern drums, include the round dance, intertribal, and two-step.5 The powwow generally begins with the grand entry, a colorful parade in which dancers enter the arena, beginning with flag bearers and followed by head dancers, tribal leaders, men, women, and children, while the drum group sings an intertribal dance song. Intertribal powwow songs are often made up of a combination of translatable text and vocables (syllables without dictionary definition, such as “hay yah, yo he yay”). Contemporary songs comprised entirely of vocables, such as the AIM Song, have become increasingly common. Most powwow dances, including the grand entry, move in a circle in a clockwise direction. Dennis Zotigh (Kiowa, Santee Dakota, and Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo), longtime powwow dancer and singer from Oklahoma, currently serves as a cultural liaison person with the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) that opened in Washington, DC, in 2004. He notes that the competitive nature of American Indians has prevailed throughout history, displayed in footraces, wrestling matches, and lance or arrow throwing contests.6 These physical competitions involved athletic training in order to excel, and paint and amulets were worn to gain advantage and protect them from negative forces. This spirit of competition now asserts itself in dancing and singing competitions at intertribal powwows, with Plains warrior societies dictating a male-dominated social order. As powwow contests and prize monies expanded, specific divided categories were developed, which were determined by dance style, age, and gender. Basic rules such as keeping time with the beat of the drum, stopping on the last beat of the drum, and not losing a major regalia article remained in place. Plains Indians lived by the honor system and would disqualify themselves if any infraction of these rules was broken. As in most athletic events, dance preparation has become an art, with physical stamina, dedication, showmanship, and knowledge of songs, along with an outstanding dance outfit as the key ingredients needed to produce a champion dancer.\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\n24\n\nSounds of Resistance\n\nThe roots of Native activism go back to the treaties, traditions, and ceremonies of the past, all of which revolved around music and dance. Often subtle but ever present, music provided the backdrop to numerous moments of Native protest against the federal campaign to destroy tribal cultures and assimilate Indians into the dominant society. This chapter will examine the role of the powwow as an integral part of American Indian activism and identity, and analyze the use of powwow music and dance as a strategic political tool to display Native pride and resistance and combat assimilation.\n\nCopyright © 2013. ABC-CLIO, LLC. All rights reserved.\n\nAssimilation and Allotment Era, 1871–1934 In 1871, the U.S. Congress ended treaty making, albeit acknowledging its obligation to uphold existing treaties. In 1883, the Courts of Indian Offenses were established on reservations to enforce federal regulations banning dancing, traditional religion, polygamy, gift giving, and other Native customs. Canada followed the U.S. lead, enacting federal laws banning Native ceremonies, including cultural artistic expression through music and dance. The Native experience in Oklahoma has a particularly complicated history. Sixty-seven tribes were forcibly removed from various parts of the United States to Indian Territory (present Oklahoma) from the 1830s through the 1870s. Allotment, the federal policy of dividing communally held tribal lands into individually owned private property, took effect in 1887. The 1889 Land Run, with the “surplus acreage” sale to settlers, was the forerunner to Oklahoma’s statehood in 1907.7 It is generally accepted that the Ponca “homecoming” celebration in 1876 was the first intertribal powwow, held to commemorate the Ponca’s arrival at White Eagle in Indian Territory after forced removal from Nebraska. This celebratory dance, to which all neighboring tribes were invited, provided a traditional Plains introduction of the Ponca to the community, despite the fact that the reservation era was now in full swing. The Ponca’s subsequent gifting of the “rights” to their Hethuska Society over the next 40 years to the Osage, Sac and Fox, and Comanche tribes, also forcibly removed to Indian Territory, forms the basis of the modern powwow’s southern straight dance category. The first diffusion of the Ponca tribe’s Hethuska Society was to the Osage in appreciation for that tribe’s protection and support in tending to their elderly and infirm while the Ponca strove to acclimatize to their new environment. The motif of cultural activism is apparent when one takes into account that the gifting of the Hethuska to other tribes occurred at the height\n\nSounds of Resistance : The Role of Music in Multicultural Activism, edited by Eunice Rojas, and Lindsay Michie,\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Indeed, the Ponca Hethuska ceased as an active organization in 1919 after two federal laws banned Native dance, and the society was not resumed until 1958. Throughout this time, however, the Ponca continued to sing and dance as guests to the Osage In’Loshka Society. By the 1960s, the Ponca had established a reputation of being the best powwow singers in Oklahoma. Ponca Hethuska songs around the big drum gradually became known as War Dance songs, and later as Intertribal songs.

The mortality rate in Native boarding schools hovered around 10 percent of each year’s crop of students, often due to tuberculosis, and was aggravated by overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and inadequate nutrition.
