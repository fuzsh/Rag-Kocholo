        "text": "Most of August 14th, 2024's edition of Flashpoints -- the daily news and information show hosted by Dennis Bernstein on KPFA Community Radio in Berkeley, California -- was dedicated to music and poetry related to the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe segment consists of Kamala Emanuel and me going back and forth with the absolutely breath-takingly powerful poet, Anita Barrows, who has written a poem every day since the genocide began in October.\n\nMany of the Australians I know who are now in their forties or older participated in the convergence on the Woomera detention center for refugees just after Easter, 2002. It was a protest that became especially legendary because it was during this protest that a successful breakout of refugees detained in the facility took place.\n\nIt would be hard to overstate what an impact this protest, and the Woomera Breakout, seems to have had on both Australian refugee policies going forth, as well as elsewhere in the world that I have witnessed. Off-shoring refugees as well as dramatically increasing security measures at such facilities in many different countries followed. But the Woomera Breakout inspired many, and continues to do so. Many of those refugees who escaped detention then are still free people today, known collectively as the Skippies.\n\nChet Gardiner has delivered a wonderful, old-timey remix of this song I just wrote, which shall be included in our ever-expanding upcoming album, to be titled I Heard A Rumor.\n\nThe song may or may not be the best song I've ever written. Judging from the vast majority of comments thus far, most people understand where I'm coming from here. Especially folks who have read some of the essays I've been writing related to social engineering.\n\nBut to clarify for those who aren't sure what I'm trying to say in this song: I don't at all mean to be suggesting that having an opinion or doing something about each of the issues mentioned in the verses is unimportant. Just that these issues are some of the issues that are being methodically used by the entities that control the social media matrix of hegemonic control that we all live in these days as useful tools for keeping us constantly engaging in circular arguments with each other, and thus rendered totally useless.\n\nHere's another song destined for my next album, which focuses on life in the matrix -- the operation of the rumor mill in its various toxic, destructive forms. The aspect of the disinformation nexus highlighted here are the sectarian cancellation campaigners, and one of them in particular -- author, journalist, and serial liar, Shane Burley, guru of a small local cult that calls itself Rose City Antifa.\n\nFor more information about Shane, his deep confusion about history, his bizarre obsession with rooting out antisemitism on the left, and the widespread promotion of people with his worldview by the liberal section of the mainstream media, my latest blog post/podcast is titled The Progressive Embrace of the McCarthyite Left and you can find it at davidrovics.com/thisweek."
