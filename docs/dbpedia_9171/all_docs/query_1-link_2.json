We also discuss his most recent album, Say Their Names, the current situation in Portland, the important role music plays in protest movements, the challenges of being a DIY artist, among other topics.\n\nThe podcast features portions of the title track off his new album, “Don’t Pay The Rent” from another one of his 2020 albums, Notes From A Failed State, and “A Penny A Play” from yet another 2020 album Strangers & Friends. The podcast concludes with the opening track from Say Their Name, “Anarchist Jurisdiction” played in its entirety."
