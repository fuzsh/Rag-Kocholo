This year, Addi Road will host US singer-songwriter David Rovics’ first live concert in Sydney for many years. Rovics is one of the heroes of political music, a veteran activist who commands a wide audience. He carries on the Woody Guthrie tradition of singing for peace and integrity, his songs being contemporary callouts for justice. Widely regarded as one of the great American songwriters, Rovics has shared the stage with big names like Billy Bragg, Joan Baez and Tom Morello from Rage Against The Machine, to name a few.

The gig will be a fundraiser for Addi Road and is sure to be a great night!

In a desperately unequal world facing a climate emergency, everyone has to pick a side.

Our side is — and always will be — that of the 99%.

Our goal is not only to expose the lies, hypocrisy and bias of the billionaire class and their media: we seek to help the organising efforts of all those actively resisting the increasingly authoritarian rule of the corporate rich, here and overseas.
