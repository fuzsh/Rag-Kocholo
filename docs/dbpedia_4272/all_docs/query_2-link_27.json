Repertoire for solo recorder (descant, treble, tenor and bass), Recorder Duets, Recorder Trios, Recorder Quartets, Recorder Quintets right up to Recorder Orchestra with 12 parts.\n\nThe music covers everything from solo recorder to full recorder Orchestra, new music and old music - all possible combinations and standards from the beginner to the professional recorder player.\n\nThe recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four-part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered.\n\nThe recorder is first documented in Europe in the Middle Ages, and continued to enjoy wide popularity in the renaissance and baroque periods, but was little used in the classical and romantic periods. It was revived in the 20th century as part of the historically informed performance movement, and became a popular amateur and educational instrument. Composers who have written for the recorder include Monteverdi, Lully, Purcell, Handel, Vivaldi, Telemann, Johann Sebastian Bach, Paul Hindemith, Benjamin Britten, Leonard Bernstein, Luciano Berio, and Arvo Pärt. Today, there are many professional recorder players who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range and a large community of amateurs.\n\nPublishers Include: Alfonz le duc, Amadeus, Barenreiter, Berondol, Boosey & Hawkes, Bornmann, Bosworth Edition, Brass Wind Publications, Brennan and Lutzeler, Breitkopf & Hartel, Broekmans en van Poppel, Bushfire Press, Cheap Trills, Carus, Doblinger, Dowani, Dolce, Dovehouse Editions, Earlham, Early Music Library, Editio Musica Budapest, Edition Guntersberg, Edition Kunzelmann, Edition Melodie, Edition Minkoff, Edition Peters, Edition Walhall, EJA Publications, Fentone, Fidula, Flautando Edition, Friedrich Hofmeister, Fuzeau Editions, Girolamo, Glen Shannon Editions, Hargail Music Press, Harmonia, Hawthorns, Heinrichshofen, Hortus Musicus, Jolly Robin Press, Janus Music, Keys Press, Leduc, Lengnick, Lerista, London Pro Musica, Loux Music Publishing, Manuskriptesammlung, May Hill Editions, Max Hieber, McGinnis and Marx, Mieroprint, Motem Music, Move Records, Moeck, Musica Rara, Noetzel, Novello Publishing, Orpheus Music, Pan, Peacock Press, Phoenix Music, Polyphonic Publications, Presser, Recordi Germany, Robert Lienau, Schott, Spartin Press, Tonos Musikverlags, Trinity College London, Universal, Ursus-Verlag, Ut Orpheus Edizioni, Zen-On, Zimmerman.\n\nOrpheus Music publishes contemporary recorder music featuring such composers as Diana Blom, Nigel Butterley, Zana Clarke, Justo Diaz, Lance Eccles, Ross Edwards, Malcolm Tattersall and Benjamin Thorn.

The recorder is an old instrument that has taken the new world by storm. Some modern music calls for the recorder to produce unusual noises, rhythms and effects, by such techniques as flutter-tonguing and overblowing to produce multiphonics. David Murphy's 2002 composition Bavardage is an example, as is Hans-Martin Linde's Music for a Bird.\n\nThe recorder is often used in popular music, including that of groups such as The Beatles; the Rolling Stones (see, for example, \"Ruby Tuesday\"); Yes, for example, in the song \"I've Seen All Good People\"; Jefferson Airplane (see Personnel as well as Grace Slick); Led Zeppelin (Stairway to Heaven); Jimi Hendrix;[100] Siouxsie and the Banshees;[101] Judy Dyble of Fairport Convention; Dido (e.g. \"Grafton Street\"); and Mannheim Steamroller.\n\nIn the 2012 Charlotte Barbour-Condini became the first recorder player to reach the final of the biennial BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. Recorder player Sophie Westbrooke was a finalist in the 2014 competition."
