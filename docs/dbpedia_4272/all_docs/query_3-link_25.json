        "text": "Automorphic Forms, Reprensentations, and L-Functions.\n\nContains sections on Automorphic representations and L-functions as well as Arithmetical algebraic geometry and L-functions.\n\nContributions to Group Theory\n\nThis volume grew out of a desire by the editors to honor their teacher, Roger Lyndon, on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday. Five short articles about Lyndon and his contributions to mathematics, as well as twenty-seven invited research papers in combinatorial group theory and closely related areas are contained in this book. It is a tribute to Lyndon's mathematical breadth that papers covering such a wide array of topics are all closely related to the work he has done. Several of the articles fall into subfields of combinatorial group theory, areas in which much of the initial work was done by Lyndon. Remaining research articles fall into various subfields of homological groups, another area in which he has made major contributions. Research articles, written by some of the leading practitioners in the field, are listed below.There is a biographical essay about Lyndon by Kenneth Appel, and there are expository articles about his work by Saunders MacLane, John Ratcliffe, Jerome Keisler and Paul Schupp. MacLane describes the results in Lyndon's doctoral thesis and explains how they fit into the early history of spectral sequences while Ratcliffe presents Lyndon's fundamental work in cohomology of groups in the early part of his career. His work in logic, especially his fundamental results in model theory in the mid 1950s is discussed by Keisler. Lyndon's contribution to group theory over the past twenty years is described by Schupp.\n\nLocally Convex Spaces\n\nThe present book grew out of several courses which I have taught at the University of Zurich and at the University of Maryland during the past seven years. It is primarily intended to be a systematic text on locally convex spaces at the level of a student who has some familiarity with general topology and basic measure theory. However, since much of the material is of fairly recent origin and partly appears here for the first time in a book, and also since some well-known material has been given a not so well-known treatment, I hope that this book might prove useful even to more advanced readers. And in addition I hope that the selection ofmaterial marks a sufficient set-offfrom the treatments in e.g. N. Bourbaki [4], [5], R.E. Edwards [1], K. Floret-J. Wloka [1], H.G.Garnir-M.De Wilde-J.Schmets [1], AGrothendieck [13], H.Heuser [1], J. Horvath [1], J. L. Kelley-I. Namioka et al. [1], G. Kothe [7], [10], A P. Robertson- W.Robertson [1], W.Rudin [2], H.H.Schaefer [1], F.Treves [l],A Wilansky [1]. A few sentences should be said about the organization of the book. It consists of 21 chapters which are grouped into three parts. Each chapter splits into several sections. Chapters, sections, and the statements therein are enumerated in consecutive fashion.\n\nTwo-Generator Discrete Subgroups of Psl (2,R) (Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society) by Gilman, Jane published by Amer Mathematical Society Paperback\n\nALGEBRA LINEAL\n\nSTANLEY I. *GROSSMAN\n\nA Treatise on the Line Complex\n\nJessop C. M. (Charles Minsha 1861-1939Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos. (2) In books where there are images such as portraits, maps, sketches etc We have endeavoured to keep the quality of these images, so they represent accurately the original artefact. Although occasionally there may be certain imperfections with these old texts, we feel they deserve to be made available for future generations to enjoy.\n\nComplex Manifolds and Hyperbolic Geometry: II Iberoamerican Congress on Geometry, January 4-9, 2001, Cimat, Guanajuato, Mexico\n\nMexico) Iberoamerican Congress on Geometry 2001 (Guanajuato, William Harvey, Sevin Recillas-PishmishThis volume derives from the second Iberoamerican Congress on Geometry, held in 2001 in Mexico at the Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas A.C., an internationally recognized program of research in pure mathematics. The conference topics were chosen with an eye toward the presentation of new methods, recent results, and the creation of more interconnections between the different research groups working in complex manifolds and hyperbolic geometry. This volume reflects both the unity and the diversity of these subjects. Researchers around the globe have been working on problems concerning Riemann surfaces, as well as a wide scope of other issues: the theory of Teichmuller spaces, theta functions, algebraic geometry and classical function theory. Included here are discussions revolving around questions of geometry that are related in one way or another to functions of a complex variable.There are contributors on Riemann surfaces, hyperbolic geometry, Teichmuller spaces, and quasiconformal maps. Complex geometry has many applications - triangulations of surfaces, combinatorics, ordinary differential equations, complex dynamics, and the geometry of special curves and jacobians, among others. In this book, research mathematicians in complex geometry, hyperbolic geometry and Teichmuller spaces will find a selection of strong papers by international experts.\n\nSolitons, Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Inverse Scattering\n\nM. A. Ablowitz, P. A. ClarksonThis book brings together several aspects of soliton theory currently available only in research papers. Emphasis is given to the multi-dimensional problems which arise and includes inverse scattering in multi-dimensions, integrable nonlinear evolution equations in multi-dimensions and the dbar method.\n\nSolitons and the Inverse Scattering Transform\n\nMark J. Ablowitz, Harvey SegurA study of the inverse scattering transform and its application to problems of nonlinear dispersive waves that arise in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, nonlinear optics, particle physics, crystal lattice theory, nonlinear circuit theory and other areas.\n\nTopics in the Theory of Riemann Surfaces\n\nRobert D.M. AccolaThe book's main concern is automorphisms of Riemann surfaces, giving a foundational treatment from the point of view of Galois coverings, and treating the problem of the largest automorphism group for a Riemann surface of a given genus. In addition, the extent to which fixed points of automorphisms are generalized Weierstrass points is considered. The extremely useful inequality of Castelnuovo- Severi is also treated. While the methods are elementary, much of the material does not appear in the current texts on Riemann surfaces, algebraic curves. The book is accessible to a reader who has had an introductory course on the theory of Riemann surfaces or algebraic curves.\n\nModuli of Abelian Varieties\n\nAllan Adler, Sundararaman RamananThis is a book aimed at researchers and advanced graduate students in algebraic geometry, interested in learning about a promising direction of research in algebraic geometry. It begins with a generalization of parts of Mumford's theory of the equations defining abelian varieties and moduli spaces. It shows through striking examples how one can use these apparently intractable systems of equations to obtain satisfying insights into the geometry and arithmetic of these varieties. It also introduces the reader to some aspects of the research of the first author into representation theory and invariant theory and their applications to these geometrical questions.\n\nRegularity of Difference Equations on Banach Spaces\n\nRavi P. Agarwal, Claudio Cuevas, Carlos LizamaThis work introduces readers to the topic of maximal regularity for difference equations. The authors systematically present the method of maximal regularity, outlining basic linear difference equations along with relevant results. They address recent advances in the field, as well as basic semi group and cosine operator theories in the discrete setting. The authors also identify some open problems that readers may wish to take up for further research. This book is intended for graduate students and researchers in the area of difference equations, particularly those with advance knowledge of and interest in functional analysis.\n\nComplex Analysis\n\nLars AhlforsA standard source of information of functions of one complex variable, this text has retained its wide popularity in this field by being consistently rigorous without becoming needlessly concerned with advanced or overspecialized material. Difficult points have been clarified, the book has been reviewed for accuracy, and notations and terminology have been modernized. Chapter 2, Complex Functions, features a brief section on the change of length and area under conformal mapping, and much of Chapter 8, Global-Analytic Functions, has been rewritten in order to introduce readers to the terminology of germs and sheaves while still emphasizing that classical concepts are the backbone of the theory. Chapter 4, Complex Integration, now includes a new and simpler proof of the general form of Cauchy's theorem. There is a short section on the Riemann zeta function, showing the use of residues in a more exciting situation than in the computation of definite integrals.\n\nAdvances in the Theory of Riemann Surfaces.\n\nLars Valerian Ahlfors, Lipman BersIntended for researchers in Riemann surfaces, this volume summarizes a significant portion of the work done in the field during the years 1966 to 1971.\n\nStudies in Modern Algebra\n\nA. A. Albert\n\nLocal Representation Theory: Modular Representations as an Introduction to the Local Representation Theory of Finite Groups\n\nJ. L. AlperinRepresentation theory has applications to number theory, combinatorics and many areas of algebra. The aim of this text is to present some of the key results in the representation theory of finite groups. Professor Alperin concentrates on local representation theory, emphasizing module theory throughout. In this way many deep results can be obtained rather quickly. After two introductory chapters, the basic results of Green are proved, which in turn lead in due course to Brauer's First Main Theorem. A proof of the module form of Brauer's Second Main Theorem is then presented, followed by a discussion of Feit's work connecting maps and the Green correspondence. The work concludes with a treatment, new in part, of the Brauer-Dade theory. Exercises are provided at the end of most sections; the results of some are used later in the text.\n\nProducts of Groups\n\nBernhard Amberg, Silvana Franciosi, Francesco de GiovanniGroups comprising two subcomponents are of particular interest to group theorists who want to know in what way the structure of the product is related to that of its subgroups. This monograph gives the first detailed account of the most important results of group product research from the past 35 years. Although the emphasis is on infinite groups, relevant theorems about finite products of groups are also proved. This book will be of interest to research students and specialists in group theory, and will be useful in seminars or as a supplement in courses in general group theory. A special chapter on conjugacy and splitting theorems obtained by means of the cohomology of groups has never before appeared in book form.\n\nNumber Theory\n\nGeorge E. AndrewsAlthough mathematics majors are usually conversant with number theory by the time they have completed a course in abstract algebra, other undergraduates, especially those in education and the liberal arts, often need a more basic introduction to the topic.\n\nIn this book the author solves the problem of maintaining the interest of students at both levels by offering a combinatorial approach to elementary number theory. In studying number theory from such a perspective, mathematics majors are spared repetition and provided with new insights, while other students benefit from the consequent simplicity of the proofs for many theorems.\n\nAmong the topics covered in this accessible, carefully designed introduction are multiplicativity-divisibility, including the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, combinatorial and computational number theory, congruences, arithmetic functions, primitive roots and prime numbers. Later chapters offer lucid treatments of quadratic congruences, additivity (including partition theory) and geometric number theory.\n\nOf particular importance in this text is the author's emphasis on the value of numerical examples in number theory and the role of computers in obtaining such examples. Exercises provide opportunities for constructing numerical tables with or without a computer. Students can then derive conjectures from such numerical tables, after which relevant theorems will seem natural and well-motivated..\n\nComplex Kleinian Groups\n\nAngel Cano Juan Pablo Navarrete Seade Kuri JosÃ© AntonioThis monograph lays down the foundations of the theory of complex Kleinian groups, a newly born area of mathematics whose origin traces back to the work of Riemann, PoincarÃ©, Picard and many others. Kleinian groups are, classically, discrete groups of conformal automorphisms of the Riemann sphere, and these can be regarded too as being groups of holomorphic automorphisms of the complex projective line CP1. When going into higher dimensions, there is a dichotomy: Should we look at conformal automorphisms of the n-sphere?, or should we look at holomorphic automorphisms of higher dimensional complex projective spaces? These two theories are different in higher dimensions. In the first case we are talking about groups of isometries of real hyperbolic spaces, an area of mathematics with a long-standing tradition. In the second case we are talking about an area of mathematics that still is in its childhood, and this is the focus of study in this monograph. This brings together several important areas of mathematics, as for instance classical Kleinian group actions, complex hyperbolic geometry, chrystallographic groups and the uniformization problem for complex manifolds.\n\nIntroduction to Analytic Number Theory\n\nTom M. Apostol\"This book is the first volume of a two-volume textbook for undergraduates and is indeed the crystallization of a course offered by the author at the California Institute of Technology to undergraduates without any previous knowledge of number theory. For this reason, the book starts with the most elementary properties of the natural integers. Nevertheless, the text succeeds in presenting an enormous amount of material in little more than 300 pages.\"-âMATHEMATICAL REVIEWS\n\nModular Functions and Dirichlet Series in Number Theory\n\nTom M. ApostolA new edition of a classical treatment of elliptic and modular functions with some of their number-theoretic applications, this text offers an updated bibliography and an alternative treatment of the transformation formula for the Dedekind eta function. It covers many topics, such as Heckeâs theory of entire forms with multiplicative Fourier coefficients, and the last chapter recounts Bohrâs theory of equivalence of general Dirichlet series.\n\nAdvances in non-Archimedean Analysis: 11th International Conference P-adic Functional Analysis July 5-9, 2010 Universite Blaise Pascal, Clermont-ferrand, France\n\nJesus Araujo-gomez, Bertin Diarra, Alain EscassutThis volume contains papers based on lectures given at the Eleventh International Conference on $p$-adic Functional Analysis, which was held from July 5-9, 2010, in Clermont-Ferrand, France. The articles collected here feature recent developments in various areas of non-Archimedean analysis: Hilbert and Banach spaces, finite dimensional spaces, topological vector spaces and operator theory, strict topologies, spaces of continuous functions and of strictly differentiable functions, isomorphisms between Banach functions spaces, and measure and integration. Other topics discussed in this volume include $p$-adic differential and $q$-difference equations, rational and non-Archimedean analytic functions, the spectrum of some algebras of analytic functions, and maximal ideals of the ultrametric corona algebra.\n\nGeometry of Algebraic Curves: Volume I\n\nEnrico Arbarello, Maurizio Cornalba, Phillip Griffiths, Joseph Daniel HarrisIn recent years there has been enormous activity in the theory of algebraic curves. Many long-standing problems have been solved using the general techniques developed in algebraic geometry during the 1950's and 1960's. Additionally, unexpected and deep connections between algebraic curves and differential equations have been uncovered, and these in turn shed light on other classical problems in curve theory. It seems fair to say that the theory of algebraic curves looks completely different now from how it appeared 15 years ago; in particular, our current state of knowledge repreÂ­ sents a significant advance beyond the legacy left by the classical geometers such as Noether, Castelnuovo, Enriques, and Severi. These books give a presentation of one of the central areas of this recent activity; namely, the study of linear series on both a fixed curve (Volume I) and on a variable curve (Volume II). Our goal is to give a comprehensive and self-contained account of the extrinsic geometry of algebraic curves, which in our opinion constitutes the main geometric core of the recent advances in curve theory. Along the way we shall, of course, discuss appliÂ­ cations of the theory of linear series to a number of classical topics (e.g., the geometry of the Riemann theta divisor) as well as to some of the current research (e.g., the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves).\n\nBasic Topology\n\nM.A. ArmstrongIn this broad introduction to topology, the author searches for topological invariants of spaces, together with techniques for their calculating. Students with knowledge of real analysis, elementary group theory, and linear algebra will quickly become familiar with a wide variety of techniques and applications involving point-set, geometric, and algebraic topology. Over 139 illustrations and more than 350 problems of various difficulties help students gain a thorough understanding of the subject.\n\nMathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics\n\nV. I. ArnoldThis book constructs the mathematical apparatus of classical mechanics from the beginning, examining basic problems in dynamics like the theory of oscillations and the Hamiltonian formalism. The author emphasizes geometrical considerations and includes phase spaces and flows, vector fields, and Lie groups. Discussion includes qualitative methods of the theory of dynamical systems and of asymptotic methods like averaging and adiabatic invariance.\n\nGeometric Algebra\n\nE. ArtinThis classic text, written by one of the foremost mathematicians of the 20th century, is now available in a low-priced paperback edition. Exposition is centered on the foundations of affine geometry, the geometry of quadratic forms, and the structure of the general linear group. Context is broadened by the inclusion of projective and symplectic geometry and the structure of symplectic and orthogonal groups.\n\nGalois Theory: Lectures Delivered at the University of Notre Dame by Emil Artin\n\nEmil Artin, Arthur N. MilgramIn the nineteenth century, French mathematician Evariste Galois developed the Galois theory of groups-one of the most penetrating concepts in modem mathematics. The elements of the theory are clearly presented in this second, revised edition of a volume of lectures delivered by noted mathematician Emil Artin. The book has been edited by Dr. Arthur N. Milgram, who has also supplemented the work with a Section on Applications.\n\nThe first section deals with linear algebra, including fields, vector spaces, homogeneous linear equations, determinants, and other topics. A second section considers extension fields, polynomials, algebraic elements, splitting fields, group characters, normal extensions, roots of unity, Noether equations, Jummer's fields, and more.\n\nDr. Milgram's section on applications discusses solvable groups, permutation groups, solution of equations by radicals, and other concepts.\n\nA Short Course on Spectral Theory\n\nWilliam ArvesonThis book presents the basic tools of modern analysis within the context of the fundamental problem of operator theory: to calculate spectra of specific operators on infinite dimensional spaces, especially operators on Hilbert spaces. The tools are diverse, and they provide the basis for more refined methods that allow one to approach problems that go well beyond the computation of spectra: the mathematical foundations of quantum physics, noncommutative K-theory, and the classification of simple C*-algebras being three areas of current research activity which require mastery of the material presented here.\n\nProducts of Finite Groups\n\nMohamed AsaadThe study of finite groups factorised as a product of two or more subgroups has become a subject of great interest during the last years with applications not only in group theory, but also in other areas like cryptography and coding theory. It has experienced a big impulse with the introduction of some permutability conditions. The aim of this book is to gather, order, and examine part of this material, including the latest advances made, give some new approach to some topics, and present some new subjects of research in the theory of finite factorised groups.\n\nRepresentation Theory of Lie Groups\n\nM. F. Atiyah, R. Bott, S. Helgason, D. Kazhdan, B. Kostant, G. LustztigLie groups and their representations occupy an important place in mathematics with applications in such diverse fields as differential geometry, number theory, differential equations and physics. In 1977 a symposium was held in Oxford to introduce this rapidly developing and expanding subject to non-specialists. This volume contains the lectures of ten distinguished mathematicians designed to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the fundamental theory and appreciate the range of results. This volume contains much to interest mathematicians and theoretical physicists from advanced undergraduate level upwards.\n\nIntroduction To Commutative Algebra\n\nMichael AtiyahThis book grew out of a course of lectures given to third year undergraduates at Oxford University and it has the modest aim of producing a rapid introduction to the subject. It is designed to be read by students who have had a first elementary course in general algebra. On the other hand, it is not intended as a substitute for the more voluminous tracts such as Zariski-Samuel or Bourbaki. We have concentrated on certain central topics, and large areas, such as field theory, are not touched. In content we cover rather more ground than Northcott and our treatment is substantially different in that, following the modern trend, we put more emphasis on modules and localization.\n\nHolomorphic Curves in Symplectic Geometry\n\nMichele Audin, Jacques LafontaineThis book is devoted to pseudo-holomorphic curve methods in symplectic geometry. It contains an introduction to symplectic geometry and relevant techniques of Riemannian geometry, proofs of Gromov's compactness theorem, an investigation of local properties of holomorphic curves, including positivity of intersections, and applications to Lagrangian embeddings problems. The chapters are based on a series of lectures given previously by the authors M. Audin, A. Banyaga, P. Gauduchon, F. Labourie, J. Lafontaine, F. Lalonde, Gang Liu, D. McDuff, M.-P. Muller, P. Pansu, L. Polterovich, J.C. Sikorav. In an attempt to make this book accessible also to graduate students, the authors provide the necessary examples and techniques needed to understand the applications of the theory. The exposition is essentially self-contained and includes numerous exercises.\n\nTorus Actions on Symplectic Manifolds\n\nMichÃ¨le AudinThe material and references in this extended second edition of \"The Topology of Torus Actions on Symplectic Manifolds\", published as Volume 93 in this series in 1991, have been updated. Symplectic manifolds and torus actions are investigated, with numerous examples of torus actions, for instance on some moduli spaces. Although the book is still centered on convexity results, it contains much more material, in particular lots of new examples and exercises.\n\nLinear Algebra Done Right\n\nSheldon AxlerThis text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.\n\nLinear Algebra Done Right\n\nSheldon AxlerThis text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces.

Wilson\n\nIntroduction to Classical Integrable Systems\n\nOlivier Babelon, Denis Bernard, Michel TalonIntroducing the reader to classical integrable systems and their applications, this book synthesizes the different approaches to the subject, providing a set of interconnected methods for solving problems in mathematical physics. The authors introduce and explain each method, and demonstrate how it can be applied to particular examples. Rather than presenting an exhaustive list of the various integrable systems, they focus on classical objects which have well-known quantum counterparts, or are the semi-classical limits of quantum objects. They thus enable readers to understand the literature on quantum integrable systems.\n\nIntroduction to p-Adic Numbers and Valuation Theory\n\nGeorge BachmanIntroduction to p-Adic Numbers and Valuation Theory by George Bachman 1964 Academic Press 64-17793\n\nQuadratic Forms Over Semilocal Rings\n\nR. Baeza\n\nRepresentation Theory and Automorphic Forms: Instructional Conference, International Centre for Mathematical Sciences, March 1996, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nT. N. Bailey, Anthony W. KnappThis book is a course in representation theory of semisimple groups, automorphic forms and the relations between these two subjects written by some of the world's leading experts in these fields. It is based on the 1996 instructional conference of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh. The book begins with an introductory treatment of structure theory and ends with an essay by Robert Langlands on the current status of functoriality. All papers are intended to provide overviews of the topics they address, and the authors have supplied extensive bibliographies to guide the reader who wants more detail.The aim of the articles is to treat representation theory with two goals in mind: to help analysts make systematic use of Lie groups in work on harmonic analysis, differential equations, and mathematical physics and to provide number theorists with the representation-theoretic input to Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. This book features discussion of representation theory from many experts' viewpoints; treatment of the subject from the foundations through recent advances; discussion of the analogies between analysis of cusp forms and analysis on semisimple symmetric spaces, which have been at the heart of research breakthroughs for 40 years; and, extensive bibliographies.\n\nAbelian Functions: Abel's Theorem and the Allied Theory of Theta Functions\n\nH. F. BakerClassical algebraic geometry, inseparably connected with the names of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, PoincarÃ©, Clebsch, Jacobi and other outstanding mathematicians of the last century, was mainly an analytical theory. In our century the methods and ideas of topology, commutative algebra and Grothendieck's schemes enriched it and seemed to have replaced once and forever the somewhat naive language of classical algebraic geometry. This classic book, written in 1897, covers the whole of algebraic geometry and associated theories. Baker discusses the subject in terms of transcendental functions, and theta functions in particular. Many of the ideas put forward are of continuing relevance today, and some of the most exciting ideas from theoretical physics draw on work presented here.\n\nAbelian Varieties\n\nWolf P. Barth, Klaus Hulek, Herbert LangeBook by Barth, Wolf, Hulek, Klaus\n\nThe Elements of Real Analysis, Second Edition\n\nRobert G. BartlePresents the basic theory of real analysis. The algebraic and order properties of the real number system are presented in a simpler fashion than in the previous edition.\n\nTopics in Combinatorial Group Theory\n\nGilbert BaumslagCombinatorial group theory is a loosely defined subject, with close connections to topology and logic. With surprising frequency, problems in a wide variety of disciplines, including differential equations, automorphic functions and geometry, have been distilled into explicit questions about groups, typically of the following kind: Are the groups in a given class finite (e.g., the Burnside problem)? Finitely generated? Finitely presented? What are the conjugates of a given element in a given group? What are the subgroups of that group? Is there an algorithm for deciding for every pair of groups in a given class whether they are isomorphic or not? The objective of combinatorial group theory is the systematic development of algebraic techniques to settle such questions. In view of the scope of the subject and the extraordinary variety of groups involved, it is not surprising that no really general theory exists. These notes, bridging the very beginning of the theory to new results and developments, are devoted to a number of topics in combinatorial group theory and serve as an introduction to the subject on the graduate level.\n\nThe Geometry of Discrete Groups\n\nAlan F. BeardonThis text is intended to serve as an introduction to the geometry of the action of discrete groups of Mobius transformations. The subject matter has now been studied with changing points of emphasis for over a hundred years, the most recent developments being connected with the theory of 3-manifolds: see, for example, the papers of Poincare [77] and Thurston [101]. About 1940, the now well-known (but virtually unobtainable) Fenchel-Nielsen manuscript appeared. Sadly, the manuscript never appeared in print, and this more modest text attempts to display at least some of the beautiful geoÂ­ metrical ideas to be found in that manuscript, as well as some more recent material. The text has been written with the conviction that geometrical explanaÂ­ tions are essential for a full understanding of the material and that however simple a matrix proof might seem, a geometric proof is almost certainly more profitable. Further, wherever possible, results should be stated in a form that is invariant under conjugation, thus making the intrinsic nature of the result more apparent. Despite the fact that the subject matter is concerned with groups of isometries of hyperbolic geometry, many publications rely on Euclidean estimates and geometry. However, the recent developments have again emphasized the need for hyperbolic geometry, and I have included a comprehensive chapter on analytical (not axiomatic) hyperbolic geometry. It is hoped that this chapter will serve as a \"dictionary\" offormulae in plane hyperbolic geometry and as such will be of interest and use in its own right.\n\nLocal Analysis for the Odd Order Theorem\n\nHelmut Bender, George GlaubermanIn 1963 Walter Feit and John G. Thompson published a proof of a 1911 conjecture by Burnside that every finite group of odd order is solvable. This proof, which ran for 255 pages, was a tour-de-force of mathematics and inspired intense effort to classify finite simple groups. This book presents a revision and expansion of the first half of the proof of the Feit-Thompson theorem. Simpler, more detailed proofs are provided for some intermediate theorems. Recent results are used to shorten other proofs.\n\nLocal Analysis for the Odd Order Theorem\n\nHelmut Bender, George GlaubermanIn 1963 Walter Feit and John G.

This volume also contains a kaleidoscope of papers based on several of the more important talks presented at the meeting. It provides a cutting-edge connection to some of the most important recent developments in the field. Through a combination of survey papers, research articles, and extensive references to earlier work, this volume allows the reader to quickly gain an overview of current activity in the field and become acquainted with many of the recent sub-branches of its development.\n\nComplex Abelian Varieties\n\nChristina Birkenhake, Herbert LangeThis book explores the theory of abelian varieties over the field of complex numbers, explaining both classic and recent results in modern language.

BlochThis book is the long-awaited publication of the famous Irvine lectures. Delivered in 1978 at the University of California at Irvine, these lectures turned out to be an entry point to several intimately-connected new branches of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as regulators and special values of L-functions of algebraic varieties, explicit formulas for them in terms of polylogarithms, the theory of algebraic cycles, and eventually the general theory of mixed motives which unifies and underlies all of the above (and much more). In the 20 years since, the importance of Bloch's lectures has not diminished. A lucky group of people working in the above areas had the good fortune to possess a copy of old typewritten notes of these lectures. Now everyone can have their own copy of this classic work.\n\nComputational Approach to Riemann Surfaces\n\nAlexander I. Bobenko, Christian KleinThis volume offers a well-structured overview of existent computational approaches to Riemann surfaces and those currently in development. The authors of the contributions represent the groups providing publically available numerical codes in this field. Thus this volume illustrates which software tools are available and how they can be used in practice. In addition examples for solutions to partial differential equations and in surface theory are presented. The intended audience of this book is twofold. It can be used as a textbook for a graduate course in numerics of Riemann surfaces, in which case the standard undergraduate background, i.e. calculus and linear algebra, is required. In particular, no knowledge of the theory of Riemann surfaces is expected; the necessary background in this theory is contained in the Introduction chapter. At the same time, this book is also intended for specialists in geometry and mathematical physics applying the theory of Riemann surfaces in their research. It is the first book on numerics of Riemann surfaces that reflects the progress made in this field during the last decade, and it contains original results. There are a growing number of applications that involve the evaluation of concrete characteristics of models analytically described in terms of Riemann surfaces. Many problem settings and computations in this volume are motivated by such concrete applications in geometry and mathematical physics.\n\nGeometric Methods in Algebra and Number Theory\n\nFedor Bogomolov, Yuri Tschinkel* Contains a selection of articles exploring geometric approaches to problems in algebra, algebraic geometry and number theory\n\n* The collection gives a representative sample of problems and most recent results in algebraic and arithmetic geometry\n\n* Text can serve as an intense introduction for graduate students and those wishing to pursue research in algebraic and arithmetic geometry\n\nAutomorphic Forms, Representations, and L-Functions: Symposium in Pure Mathematics. Volume XXXIII Part 1\n\nArmand Borel, W. CasselmanContains sections on Reductive groups, representations, Automorphic forms and representations.\n\nAlgebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra\n\nSiegfried BoschAlgebraic geometry is a fascinating branch of mathematics that combines methods from both, algebra and geometry. It transcends the limited scope of pure algebra by means of geometric construction principles. Moreover, Grothendieckâs schemes invented in the late 1950s allowed the application of algebraic-geometric methods in fields that formerly seemed to be far away from geometry, like algebraic number theory. The new techniques paved the way to spectacular progress such as the proof of Fermatâs Last Theorem by Wiles and Taylor.\n\nThe scheme-theoretic approach to algebraic geometry is explained for non-experts. More advanced readers can use the book to broaden their view on the subject. A separate part deals with the necessary prerequisites from commutative algebra. On a whole, the book provides a very accessible and self-contained introduction to algebraic geometry, up to a quite advanced level.\n\nEvery chapter of the book is preceded by a motivating introduction with an informal discussion of the contents. Typical examples and an abundance of exercises illustrate each section. This way the book is an excellent solution for learning by yourself or for complementing knowledge that is already present. It can equally be used as a convenient source for courses and seminars or as supplemental literature.\n\nAlgÃ¨bre: Chapitre 8\n\nN.

BruggemanAutomorphic forms on the upper half plane have been studied for a long time. Most attention has gone to the holomorphic automorphic forms, with numerous applications to number theory. Maass, [34], started a systematic study of real analytic automorphic forms. He extended Heckeâs relation between automorphic forms and Dirichlet series to real analytic automorphic forms. The names Selberg and Roelcke are connected to the spectral theory of real analytic automorphic forms, see, e. g. , [50], [51]. This culminates in the trace formula of Selberg, see, e. g. , Hejhal, [21]. Automorphicformsarefunctionsontheupperhalfplanewithaspecialtra- formation behavior under a discontinuous group of non-euclidean motions in the upper half plane. One may ask how automorphic forms change if one perturbs this group of motions. This question is discussed by, e. g. , Hejhal, [22], and Phillips and Sarnak, [46]. Hejhal also discusses the e?ect of variation of the multiplier s- tem (a function on the discontinuous group that occurs in the description of the transformation behavior of automorphic forms). In [5]â[7] I considered variation of automorphic forms for the full modular group under perturbation of the m- tiplier system. A method based on ideas of Colin de Verdi` ere, [11], [12], gave the meromorphic continuation of Eisenstein and PoincarÂ´ e series as functions of the eigenvalue and the multiplier system jointly. The present study arose from a plan to extend these results to much more general groups (discrete co?nite subgroups of SL (R)).\n\nTheta Functions Bowdoin 1987\n\nMe.)

Bruzzo\n\nLie Theory and Geometry: In Honor of Bertram Kostant\n\nJean-Luc Brylinski, Ranee Brylinski, Victor Guillemin, Victor KacThis volume, dedicated to Bertram Kostant on the occasion of his 65th birthday, is a collection of 22 invited papers by leading mathematicians working in Lie theory, geometry, algebra, and mathematical physics. Kostantâs fundamental work in all these areas has provided deep new insights and connections, and has created new fields of research. The papers gathered here present original research articles as well as expository papers, broadly reflecting the range of Kostantâs work.\n\nSolitons, Geometry and Topology: On the Crossroad\n\nV. M. Buchstaber, S. P. NovikovThis collection contains articles reflecting the most recent activity in topology and mathematical physics presented at the S. Novikov Seminar held in Moscow. Papers in the volume are devoted to problems in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, including applications of topology to physical problems. Such a combination is a long-standing tradition of the seminar, which originated in 1965.\n\nTopics on Riemann Surfaces and Fuchsian Groups\n\nE. Bujalance, A. F. Costa, E. MartÃ­nezThis book presents a cross-section of different aspects of Riemann surfaces, introducing the reader to the basics as well as highlighting new developments in the field. It provides a mixture of classical material, recent results and some non-mainstream topics. The book is based on lectures from the conference Topics on Riemann Surfaces and Fuchsian Groups held in Madrid to mark the 25th anniversary of the Universidad Nacional de EducaciÃ³n a Distancia.\n\nAutomorphism Groups of Compact Bordered Klein Surfaces: A Combinatorial Approach\n\nEmilio Bujalance, Jose J. Etayo, Jose M. Gamboa, Grzegorz GromadzkiThis research monograph provides a self-contained approach to the problem of determining the conditions under which a compact bordered Klein surface S and a finite group G exist, such that G acts as a group of automorphisms in S. The cases dealt with here take G cyclic, abelian, nilpotent or supersoluble and S hyperelliptic or with connected boundary. No advanced knowledge of group theory or hyperbolic geometry is required and three introductory chapters provide as much background as necessary on non-euclidean crystallographic groups. The graduate reader thus finds here an easy access to current research in this area as well as several new results obtained by means of the same unified approach.\n\nSymmetries of Compact Riemann Surfaces\n\nEmilio Bujalance, Francisco Javier Cirre, JosÃ© Manuel Gamboa, Grzegorz GromadzkiThis monograph covers symmetries of compact Riemann surfaces. It examines the number of conjugacy classes of symmetries, the numbers of ovals of symmetries and the symmetry types of Riemann surfaces.\n\nSymmetries of Compact Riemann Surfaces\n\nEmilio Bujalance, Francisco Javier Cirre, JosÃ© Manuel Gamboa, Grzegorz GromadzkiThis monograph covers symmetries of compact Riemann surfaces. It examines the number of conjugacy classes of symmetries, the numbers of ovals of symmetries and the symmetry types of Riemann surfaces.\n\nLie Groups\n\nDaniel BumpThis book proceeds beyond the representation theory of compact Lie groups (which is the basis of many texts) and offers a carefully chosen range of material designed to give readers the bigger picture. It explores compact Lie groups through a number of proofs and culminates in a \"topics\" section that takes the Frobenius-Schur duality between the representation theory of the symmetric group and the unitary groups as unifying them.\n\nA Second Course in Mathematical Analysis\n\nJ. C. Burkill, H. BurkillThe classic analysis textbook from Burkill and Burkill is now available in the Cambridge Mathematical Library. This straightforward course, based on the idea of a limit, is for students of mathematics and physics who have acquired a working knowledge of calculus and are ready for a more systematic approach. The treatment given here also brings in other limiting processes, such as the summation of infinite series and the expansion of trigonometric functions as power series. Particular attention is given to clarity of exposition and the logical development of the subject matter.\n\nTheory of Groups of Finite Order\n\nWilliam BurnsideTheory of Groups of Finite Order is presented here in a high quality paperback edition. This publication is professionally scanned from an original edition of the book, and of the best possible quality. This popular classic work by William Burnside is in the English language. If you enjoy the works of William Burnside then we highly recommend this publication for your book collection.\n\nElementary Number Theory\n\nDavid BurtonElementary Number Theory, Seventh Edition, is written for the one-semester undergraduate number theory course taken by math majors, secondary education majors, and computer science students. This contemporary text provides a simple account of classical number theory, set against a historical background that shows the subject's evolution from antiquity to recent research. Written in David Burtonâs engaging style, Elementary Number Theory reveals the attraction that has drawn leading mathematicians and amateurs alike to number theory over the course of history.\n\nAn introduction to abstract mathematical systems\n\nDavid M. Burton\n\nGeometry and Spectra of Compact Riemann Surfaces\n\nPeter BuserThis monograph is a self-contained introduction to the geometry of Riemann Surfaces of constant curvatureÂ â1 and their length and eigenvalue spectra. It focuses on two subjects: the geometric theory of compact Riemann surfaces of genus greater than one, and the relationship of the Laplace operator with the geometry of such surfaces. Research workers and graduate students interested in compact Riemann surfaces will find here a number of useful tools and insights to apply to their investigations.\n\nFinite Reductive Groups: Related Structures and Representations: Proceedings of an International Conference held in Luminy, France\n\nMarc CabanesFinite reductive groups and their representations lie at the heart of group theory. This volume treats linear representations of finite reductive groups and their modular aspects together with Hecke algebras, complex reflection groups, quantum groups, arithmetic groups, Lie groups, symmetric groups and general finite groups.\n\nGroups St Andrews 1997 in Bath: Volume 2\n\nC. M. Campbell, E. F. Robertson, N. Ruskuc, G. C. SmithThis two-volume book contains selected papers from the international conference \"Groups St. Andrews 1997 in Bath\". The articles are arranged in roughly alphabetical order and cover a wide spectrum of modern group theory. There are articles based on lecture courses given by five main speakers together with refereed survey and research articles contributed by other conference participants. Proceedings of earlier \"Groups St. Andrews\" conferences have had a major impact on the development of group theory and these volumes should be equally important.\n\nGroups St Andrews 2009 in Bath: Volume 1\n\nC. M. Campbell, M. R. Quick, E. F. Robertson, C. M. Roney-Dougal, G. C. Smith, G. TraustasonGroups St Andrews 2009 was held in the University of Bath in August 2009 and this first volume of a two-volume book contains selected papers from the international conference. Five main lecture courses were given at the conference, and articles based on their lectures form a substantial part of the proceedings. This volume contains the contributions by Gerhard Hiss (RWTH Aachen) and Volodymyr Nekrashevych (Texas A&M). Apart from the main speakers, refereed survey and research articles were contributed by other conference participants. Arranged in alphabetical order, these articles cover a wide spectrum of modern group theory. The regular proceedings of Groups St Andrews conferences have provided snapshots of the state of research in group theory throughout the past 30 years. Earlier volumes have had a major impact on the development of group theory and it is anticipated that this volume will be equally important.\n\nModules and Group Algebras\n\nJon CarlsonThe notes in this volume were written as a part of a Nachdiplom course that I gave at the ETH in the summer semester of 1995. The aim of my lectures was the development of some of the basics of the interaction of homological algebra, or more specifically the cohomology of groups, and modular representation theory. Every time that I had given such a course in the past fifteen years, the choice of the material and the order of presentation of the results have followed more or less the same basic pattern. Such a course began with the fundamentals of group cohomology, and then investigated the structure of cohomology rings, and their maximal ideal spectra. Then the variety of a module was defined and related to actual module structure through the rank variety. Applications followed. The standard approach was used in my University of Essen Lecture Notes [e1] in 1984. Evens [E] and Benson [B2] have written it up in much clearer detail and included it as part of their books on the subject.\n\nDifferential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces\n\nManfredo P. Do CarmoThis volume covers local as well as global differential geometry of curves and surfaces.\n\nDifferential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces\n\nManfredo P.

RodriguezThis volume presents the proceedings of the I Iberoamerican Congress on Geometry: Cruz del Sur held in Olmue, Chile. The main topic was 'The Geometry of Groups: Curves, Abelian Varieties, Theoretical and Computational Aspects'. Participants came from all over the world. The volume gathers the expanded contributions from most of the participants in the Congress. Articles reflect the topic in its diversity and unity, and in particular, the work done on the subject by Iberoamerican mathematicians. Original results and surveys are included on the following areas: curves and Riemann surfaces, abelian varieties, and complex dynamics. The approaches are varied, including Kleinian groups, quasiconformal mappings and Teichmuller spaces, function theory, moduli spaces, automorphism groups, algebraic geometry, and more.\n\nComplex Geometry of Groups: January 5-11, 1998, Olmue, Chile\n\nAngel Carocca, Victor Gonzalez-Aguilera, Rubi E.

Carter, Ian G. MacDonald, Graeme B. SegalThree of the leading figures in the field have composed this excellent introduction to the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Together these lectures provide an elementary account of the theory that is unsurpassed. In the first part, Roger Carter concentrates on Lie algebras and root systems. In the second Graeme Segal discusses Lie groups. And in the final part, Ian Macdonald gives an introduction to special linear groups. Graduate students requiring an introduction to the theory of Lie groups and their applications should look no further than this book.\n\nSimple Groups of Lie Type\n\nRoger W. CarterNow available in paperbackâthe standard introduction to the theory of simple groups of Lie type. In 1955, Chevalley showed how to construct analogues of the complex simple Lie groups over arbitrary fields. The present work presents the basic results in the structure theory of Chevalley groups and their twisted analogues. Carter looks at groups of automorphisms of Lie algebras, makes good use of Weyl group (also discussing Lie groups over finite fields), and develops the theory of Chevalley and Steinberg groups in the general context of groups with a (B,N)-pair. This new edition contains a corrected proof of the simplicity of twisted groups, a completed list of sporadic simple groups in the final chapter and a few smaller amendments; otherwise, this work remains the classic piece of exposition it was when it first appeared in 1971.\n\nSingularities of Plane Curves\n\nEduardo Casas-AlveroThis comprehensive and self-contained exposition of the algebro-geometric theory of singularities of plane curves covers both the classical and modern aspects of the field. It gives a unified treatment with complete proofs and presents modern results which have only appeared in research papers. It updates and correctly proves a number of important classical results for which there was formerly no suitable reference. With new, previously unpublished results as well as applications to algebra and algebraic geometry, this book will be useful as a reference text for researchers in the field. It is also suitable as a textbook for postgraduate courses on singularities.\n\nAlgebraic Number Theory: Proceedings of an Instructional Conference Organized by the London Mathematical Society\n\nJ. W. S. Cassels, A. FrohlichThis book provides a brisk, thorough treatment of the foundations of algebraic number theory on which it builds to introduce more advanced topics. Throughout, the authors emphasize the systematic development of techniques for the explicit calculation of the basic invariants such as rings of integers, class groups, and units, combining at each stage theory with explicit computations.\n\nRational Quadratic Forms\n\nJ. W. S. Cassels, MathematicsThis exploration of quadratic forms over rational numbers and rational integers offers an excellent elementary introduction to many aspects of a classical subject, including recent developments. The author, a Professor Emeritus at Trinity College, University of Cambridge, offers a largely self-contained treatment that develops most of the prerequisites.Topics include the theory of quadratic forms over local fields, forms with integral coefficients, genera and spinor genera, reduction theory for definite forms, and Gauss' composition theory. The final chapter explains how to formulate the proofs in earlier chapters independently of Dirichlet's theorems related to the existence of primes in arithmetic progressions. Specialists will particularly value the several helpful appendixes on class numbers, Siegel's formulas, Tamagawa numbers, and other topics. Each chapter concludes with many exercises and hints, plus notes that include historical remarks and references to the literature.\n\nRational Quadratic Forms\n\nJ. W. S.

Casson, Steven A. Bleiler\n\nRepresentation Theory of the Symmetric Groups: The Okounkov-Vershik Approach, Character Formulas, and Partition Algebras\n\nTullio Ceccherini-Silberstein, Fabio Scarabotti, Filippo TolliThe representation theory of the symmetric groups is a classical topic that, since the pioneering work of Frobenius, Schur and Young, has grown into a huge body of theory, with many important connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. This self-contained book provides a detailed introduction to the subject, covering classical topics such as the Littlewood-Richardson rule and the Schur-Weyl duality. Importantly the authors also present many recent advances in the area, including Lassalle's character formulas, the theory of partition algebras, and an exhaustive exposition of the approach developed by A. M. Vershik and A. Okounkov. A wealth of examples and exercises makes this an ideal textbook for graduate students. It will also serve as a useful reference for more experienced researchers across a range of areas, including algebra, computer science, statistical mechanics and theoretical physics.\n\nDifferential Geometry and Complex Analysis: A Volume Dedicated to the Memory of Harry Ernest Rauch\n\nI. Chavel, H.M. FarkasThis volume is dedicated to the memory of Harry Ernest Rauch, who died suddenly on June 18, 1979. In organizing the volume we solicited: (i) articles summarizing Rauch's own work in differential geometry, complex analysis and theta functions (ii) articles which would give the reader an idea of the depth and breadth of Rauch's researches, interests, and influence, in the fields he investigated, and (iii) articles of high scientific quality which would be of general interest. In each of the areas to which Rauch made significant contribution - pinching theorems, teichmiiller theory, and theta functions as they apply to Riemann surfaces - there has been substantial progress. Our hope is that the volume conveys the originality of Rauch's own work, the continuing vitality of the fields he influenced, and the enduring respect for, and tribute to, him and his accomÂ­ plishments in the mathematical community. Finally, it is a pleasure to thank the Department of Mathematics, of the GradÂ­ uate School of the City University of New York, for their logistical support, James Rauch who helped us with the biography, and Springer-Verlag for all their efforts in producing this volume.

This book provides an accessible introduction to class field theory. It takes a traditional approach in that it attempts to present the material using the original techniques of proof, but in a fashion which is cleaner and more streamlined than most other books on this topic. It could be used for a graduate course on algebraic number theory, as well as for students who are interested in self-study. The book has been class-tested, and the author has included lots of challenging exercises throughout the text.\n\nA Scrapbook of Complex Curve Theory\n\nC. Herbert ClemensThis fine book by Herb Clemens quickly became a favorite of many algebraic geometers when it was first published in 1980. It has been popular with novices and experts ever since. It is written as a book of 'impressions' of a journey through the theory of complex algebraic curves. Many topics of compelling beauty occur along the way. A cursory glance at the subjects visited reveals a wonderfully eclectic selection, from conics and cubics to theta functions, Jacobians, and questions of moduli. By the end of the book, the theme of theta functions becomes clear, culminating in the Schottky problem. The author's intent was to motivate further study and to stimulate mathematical activity. The attentive reader will learn much about complex algebraic curves and the tools used to study them. The book can be especially useful to anyone preparing a course on the topic of complex curves or anyone interested in supplementing his/her reading.\n\nGeometry for the Classroom\n\nC.Herbert Clemens, Michael A. ClemensIntended for use in college courses for prospective or in-service secondary school teachers of geometry. Designed to give teachers broad preparation in the content of elementary geometry as well as closely related topics of a slightly more advanced nature. The presentation and the modular format are designed to incorporate a flexible methodology for the teaching of geometry, one that can be adapted to different classroom settings. The basic strategy is to develop the few fundamental concepts of elementary geometry, first in intuitive form, and then more rigorously. The rest of the material is then built up out of these concepts through a combination of exposition and \"guided discovery\" in the problem sections. A separate volume including the solutions to the exercises is also available.\n\nL-Functions and Arithmetic\n\nJ. Coates, M. J. TaylorThis volume is an outgrowth of the LMS Durham Symposium on L-functions, held in July 1989. The Symposium consisted of several short courses, aimed at presenting rigorous but nontechnical explanations of the latest research areas, and a number of individual lectures on specific topics.\n\nCombinatorial Group Theory: A Topological Approach\n\nDaniel E. CohenIn this book, developed from courses taught at the University of London, the author aims to show the value of using topological methods in combinatorial group theory. The topological material is given in terms of the fundamental groupoid, giving results and proofs that are both stronger and simpler than the traditional ones. Several chapters deal with covering spaces and complexes, an important method, which is then applied to yield the major Schreier and Kurosh subgroup theorems. The author presents a full account of Bass-Serre theory and discusses the word problem, in particular, its unsolvability and the Higman Embedding Theorem. Included for completeness are the relevant results of computability theory.\n\nA Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory\n\nHenri CohenA description of 148 algorithms fundamental to number-theoretic computations, in particular for computations related to algebraic number theory, elliptic curves, primality testing and factoring. The first seven chapters guide readers to the heart of current research in computational algebraic number theory, including recent algorithms for computing class groups and units, as well as elliptic curve computations, while the last three chapters survey factoring and primality testing methods, including a detailed description of the number field sieve algorithm. The whole is rounded off with a description of available computer packages and some useful tables, backed by numerous exercises. Written by an authority in the field, and one with great practical and teaching experience, this is certain to become the standard and indispensable reference on the subject.\n\nRepresentations and Characters of Finite Groups\n\nM. J. CollinsRepresentation theory and character theory have proved essential in the study of finite simple groups since their early development by Frobenius. The author begins by presenting the foundations of character theory in a style accessible to advanced undergraduates that requires only a basic knowledge of group theory and general algebra. This theme is then expanded in a self-contained account providing an introduction to the application of character theory to the classification of simple groups. The book follows both strands of the theory: the exceptional characteristics of Suzuki and Feit and the block character theory of Brauer and includes refinements of original proofs that have become available as the subject has grown.\n\nSphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\n\nJohn Conway, Neil J. A. SloaneThe third edition of this definitive and popular book continues to pursue the question: what is the most efficient way to pack a large number of equal spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space? The authors also examine such related issues as the kissing number problem, the covering problem, the quantizing problem, and the classification of lattices and quadratic forms. There is also a description of the applications of these questions to other areas of mathematics and science such as number theory, coding theory, group theory, analogue-to-digital conversion and data compression, n-dimensional crystallography, dual theory and superstring theory in physics. New and of special interest is a report on some recent developments in the field, and an updated and enlarged supplementary bibliography with over 800 items.\n\nA Course in Functional Analysis\n\nJohn B ConwayThis book is an introductory text in functional analysis. Unlike many modern treatments, it begins with the particular and works its way to the more general.\n\nFrom the reviews: \"This book is an excellent text for a first graduate course in functional analysis....Many interesting and important applications are included....It includes an abundance of exercises, and is written in the engaging and lucid style which we have come to expect from the author.\" âMATHEMATICAL REVIEWS\n\nAtlas of Finite Groups: Maximal Subgroups and Ordinary Characters for Simple Groups\n\nJohn Horton ConwayThis atlas covers groups from the families of the classification of finite simple groups. Recently updated incorporating corrections\n\nOn Quaternions and Octonions\n\nJohn Horton Conway, Derek SmithThis book investigates the geometry of quaternion and octonion algebras. Following a comprehensive historical introduction, the book illuminates the special properties of 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean spaces using quaternions, leading to enumerations of the corresponding finite groups of symmetries. The second half of the book discusses the less familiar octonion algebra, concentrating on its remarkable \"triality symmetry\" after an appropriate study of Moufang loops. The authors also describe the arithmetics of the quaternions and octonions. The book concludes with a new theory of octonion factorization. Topics covered include the geometry of complex numbers, quaternions and 3-dimensional groups, quaternions and 4-dimensional groups, Hurwitz integral quaternions, composition algebras, Moufang loops, octonions and 8-dimensional geometry, integral octonions, and the octonion projective plane.\n\nNOTAS DE GEOMETRIA DIFERENCIAL DE CURVAS Y SUPERFICIE\n\nANTONIO F. ET AL. COSTA\n\nIdeals, Varieties, and Algorithms: An Introduction to Computational Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra\n\nDavid Cox, John Little, Donal O'SheaAlgebraic Geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations in one or more variables, asking such questions as: Does the system have finitely many solutions, and if so how can one find them? And if there are infinitely many solutions, how can they be described and manipulated? The solutions of a system of polynomial equations form a geometric object called a variety; the corresponding algebraic object is an ideal. There is a close relationship between ideals and varieties which reveals the intimate link between algebra and geometry. Written at a level appropriate to undergraduates, this book covers such topics as the Hilbert Basis Theorem, the Nullstellensatz, invariant theory, projective geometry, and dimension theory. The algorithms to answer questions such as those posed above are an important part of algebraic geometry. This book bases its discussion of algorithms on a generalization of the division algorithm for polynomials in one variable that was only discovered in the 1960's. Although the algorithmic roots of algebraic geometry are old, the computational aspects were neglected earlier in this century. This has changed in recent years, and new algorithms, coupled with the power of fast computers, have let to some interesting applications, for example in robotics and in geometric theorem proving. In preparing a new edition of Ideals, Varieties and Algorithms the authors present an improved proof of the Buchberger Criterion as well as a proof of Bezout's Theorem. Appendix C contains a new section on Axiom and an update about Maple , Mathematica and REDUCE.\n\nApplications of Computational Algebraic Geometry: American Mathematical Society Short Course January 6-7, 1997 San Diego, California\n\nDavid A. Cox, Bernd Sturmfels, Dinesh N. ManochaThis book introduces readers to key ideas and applications of computational algebraic geometry. Beginning with the discovery of Grobner bases and fueled by the advent of modern computers and the rediscovery of resultants, computational algebraic geometry has grown rapidly in importance. The fact that 'crunching equations' is now as easy as 'crunching numbers' has had a profound impact in recent years. At the same time, the mathematics used in computational algebraic geometry is unusually elegant and accessible, which makes the subject easy to learn and easy to apply. This book begins with an introduction to Grobner bases and resultants, then discusses some of the more recent methods for solving systems of polynomial equations. A sampler of possible applications follows, including computer-aided geometric design, complex information systems, integer programming, and algebraic coding theory. The lectures in the book assume no previous acquaintance with the material.\n\nApplications of Computational Algebraic Geometry: American Mathematical Society Short Course January 6-7, 1997 San Diego, California\n\nDavid A.

CoxMirror symmetry began when theoretical physicists made some astonishing predictions about rational curves on quintic hypersurfaces in four-dimensional projective space. Understanding the mathematics behind these predictions has been a substantial challenge. This book is the first completely comprehensive monograph on mirror symmetry, covering the original observations by the physicists through the most recent progress made to date. Subjects discussed include toric varieties, Hodge theory, KÃ¤hler geometry, moduli of stable maps, Calabi-Yau manifolds, quantum cohomology, Gromov-Witten invariants, and the mirror theorem.\n\nIntroduction to Geometry\n\nH. S. M. CoxeterThis classic work is now available in an unabridged paperback edition. The Second Edition retains all the characterisitcs that made the first edition so popular: brilliant exposition, the flexibility permitted by relatively self-contained chapters, and broad coverage ranging from topics in the Euclidean plane, to affine geometry, projective geometry, differential geometry, and topology. The Second Edition incorporates improvements in the text and in some proofs, takes note of the solution of the 4-color map problem, and provides answers to most of the exercises.\n\nGenerators and Relations for Discrete Groups\n\nH.S.M. & MOSER, W.O.J. COXETER\n\nFoundations of Computational Mathematics: Selected Papers of a Conference Held at Rio de Janeiro, January 1997\n\nFelipe Cucker, Michael ShubThis book contains a collection of articles corresponding to some of the talks delivered at the Foundations of Computational Mathematics conference held at IMPA in Rio de Janeiro in January 1997. Some ofthe others are published in the December 1996 issue of the Journal of Complexity. Both of these publications were available and distributed at the meeting. Even in this aspect we hope to have achieved a synthesis of the mathematics and computer science cultures as well as of the disciplines. The reaction to the Park City meeting on Mathematics of Numerical AnalyÂ­ sis: Real Number Algorithms which was chaired by Steve Smale and had around 275 participants, was very enthusiastic. At the suggestion of Narendra KarmarÂ­ mar a lunch time meeting of Felipe Cucker, Arieh Iserles, Narendra Karmarkar, Jim Renegar, Mike Shub and Steve Smale decided to try to hold a periodic meeting entitled \"Foundations of Computational Mathematics\" and to form an organization with the same name whose primary purpose will be to hold the meeting. This is then the first edition of FoCM as such. It has been organized around a small collection of workshops, namely - Systems of algebraic equations and computational algebraic geometry - Homotopy methods and real machines - Information-based complexity - Numerical linear algebra - Approximation and PDEs - Optimization - Differential equations and dynamical systems - Relations to computer science - Vision and related computational tools There were also twelve plenary speakers.\n\nLipa's Legacy: Proceedings of the Bers Colloquium, October 19-20, 1995, Graduate School and University Center of Cuny\n\nBers Colloquium (1st : 1995 : Graduate School and University Center of CUNY), Jozef Dodziuk, Linda KeenThe mathematical works of Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers are fundamental and lasting. They have influenced and altered the development of twentieth century mathematics. The personalities of these two scientists helped create a mathematical family and have had a permanent positive effect on a whole generation of mathematicians. Their mathematical heritage continues to lead succeeding generations. In the fall of 1994, one year after Bers' death, some members of this family decided to inaugurate a series of conferences, The Bers Colloquium, to be held every three years. The theme was to be a topic in the Ahlfors-Bers mathematical tradition, broadly interpreted. Ahlfors died a year after the first colloquium; future colloquia in this series will be called \"\"The Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium\"\".The first colloquium was held in October 1995 at the Graduate Center, CUNY in New York. It coincided roughly with the second anniversary of Bers' death. There were six lectures and much informal mathematical discussion. This volume contains papers by the speakers and many of the participants. The broad range of papers indicates how strong and far-reaching Bers' influence has been. The topics represented in the book include Teichmuller theory, Kleinian groups, higher dimensional hyperbolic geometry, geometry of numbers, circle packings, theory of discrete groups, classical complex function theory, one dimensional dynamics, fluid dynamics, quasiconformal mappings in higher dimensions, partial differential equations, and classical algebraic geometry. This title features: twenty-seven very high-level papers on related topics, open problems, and expository articles.\n\nMethods of Representation Theory: With Applications to Finite Groups and Orders, Vol. 1\n\nCharles W. Curtis, Irving ReinerThis paperback edition of the standard algebra text reviews the development of the representation theory of finite groups and associative algebras and discusses applications and connections with other parts of mathematics. The authors incorporate a self-contained account of the three main branches of representation theory - ordinary, modular, and integral - and demonstrate the connections between them. There is a wealth of illustrative examples and auxiliary results, and almost every section contains exercises.\n\nRepresentation Theory of Finite Groups and Associative Algebras\n\nCharles W. Curtis, Irving ReinerThis book offers a self-contained and up-to-date account of the representation theory of finite groups and associative rings and algebras. It pays particular attention to the theory of induced characters and induced representations, quasi-Frobenius rings and Frobenius algebras, integral representations, and the theory of modular representations. While emphasizing general methods and building the theory on the study of modules over rings with minimal condition, the book features enough examples and problems to help the researcher who needs to compute explicit representations for particular groups. In addition, the text includes some applications of group representations to the structure theory of finite groups, and a survey of current literature dealing with these applications. Neither encyclopedic nor historical in nature, this work concentrates instead on the most important and fruitful results, yet includes as much preliminary material as necessary for their proofs.\n\nAlgebraic Geometry I: Algebraic Curves, Algebraic Manifolds and Schemes\n\nV.I. Danilov, V.V. Shokurov, I. Shafarevich\"... To sum up, this book helps to learn algebraic geometry in a short time, its concrete style is enjoyable for students and reveals the beauty of mathematics.\" âActa Scientiarum Mathematicarum\n\nTheory of Lattice-Ordered Groups\n\nMichael DarnelProvides a thorough discussion of the orderability of a group. The book details the major developments in the theory of lattice-ordered groups, delineating standard approaches to structural and permutation representations. A radically new presentation of the theory of varieties of lattice-ordered groups is offered.;This work is intended for pure and applied mathematicians and algebraists interested in topics such as group, order, number and lattice theory, universal algebra, and representation theory; and upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in these disciplines.;College or university bookstores may order five or more copies at a special student price which is available from Marcel Dekker Inc, upon request.\n\nMultiplicative Number Theory\n\nHarold Davenport, H.L. MontgomeryThe new edition of this thorough examination of the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions offers many revisions and corrections as well as a new section recounting recent works in the field. The book covers many classical results, including the Dirichlet theorem on the existence of prime numbers in arithmetical progressions and the theorem of Siegel. It also presents a simplified, improved version of the large sieve method.\n\nIntroduction to Lattices and Order\n\nB. A. Davey, H. A. PriestleyOrdered structures have been increasingly recognized in recent years due to an explosion of interest in theoretical computer science and all areas of discrete mathematics. This book covers areas such as ordered sets and lattices. A key feature of ordered sets, one which is emphasized in the text, is that they can be represented pictorially. Lattices are also considered as algebraic structures and hence a purely algebraic study is used to reinforce the ideas of homomorphisms and of ideals encountered in group theory and ring theory. Exposure to elementary abstract algebra and the rotation of set theory are the only prerequisites for this text. For the new edition, much has been rewritten or expanded and new exercises have been added.\n\nIntroduction to Lattices and Order\n\nB. A. Davey, H. A.

Beginning with complex elliptic curves, the book moves on to the higher-dimensional case, giving characterizations from different points of view of those complex tori which are abelian varieties, i.e., those that can be holomorphically embedded in a projective space. This allows, on the one hand, for illuminating the computations of nineteenth-century mathematicians, and on the other, familiarizing readers with more recent theories.Complex tori are ideal in this respect: one can perform 'hands-on' computations without the theory being totally trivial. Standard theorems about abelian varieties are proved, and moduli spaces are discussed. Recent results on the geometry and topology of some subvarieties of a complex torus are also included. The book contains numerous examples and exercises. It is a very good starting point for studying algebraic geometry, suitable for graduate students and researchers interested in algebra and algebraic geometry.\n\nTores et variÃ©tÃ©s abÃ©liennes complexes\n\nOlivier Debarre\n\nTores et variÃ©tÃ©s abÃ©liennes complexes\n\nOlivier Debarre\n\nTheory of Algebraic Integers\n\nRichard DedekindThe invention of ideals by Dedekind in the 1870s was well ahead of its time, and proved to be the genesis of what today we would call algebraic number theory. His memoir \"Sur la Theorie des Nombres Entiers Algebriques\" first appeared in installments in the Bulletin des sciences mathematiques in 1877. This book is a translation of that work by John Stillwell, who adds a detailed introduction giving historical background and who outlines the mathematical obstructions that Dedekind was striving to overcome. Dedekind's memoir offers a candid account of the development of an elegant theory and provides blow by blow comments regarding the many difficulties encountered en route. This book is a must for all number theorists.\n\nQuantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians\n\nPierre Deligne, Pavel Etingof, Daniel S. Freed, Lisa C. Jeffrey, David Kazhdan, John W. Morgan, David R. Morrison, Edward WittenIdeas from quantum field theory and string theory have had considerable impact on mathematics over the past 20 years. Advances in many different areas have been inspired by insights from physics.\n\nIn 1996-97 the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton, NJ) organized a special year-long program designed to teach mathematicians the basic physical ideas which underlie the mathematical applications. The purpose is eloquently stated in a letter written by Robert MacPherson: \"The goal is to create and convey an understanding, in terms congenial to mathematicians, of some fundamental notions of physics ... [and to] develop the sort of intuition common among physicists for those who are used to thought processes stemming from geometry and algebra.\"\n\nThese volumes are a written record of the program. They contain notes from several long and many short courses covering various aspects of quantum field theory and perturbative string theory. The courses were given by leading physicists and the notes were written either by the speakers or by mathematicians who participated in the program. The book also includes problems and solutions worked out by the editors and other leading participants. Interspersed are mathematical texts with background material and commentary on some topics covered in the lectures. These two volumes present the first truly comprehensive introduction to this field aimed at a mathematics audience. They offer a unique opportunity for mathematicians and mathematical physicists to learn about the beautiful and difficult subjects of quantum field theory and string theory.\n\nQuantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians\n\nPierre DeligneIdeas from quantum field theory and string theory have had considerable impact on mathematics over the past 20 years.

As part of its endeavour to promote research in computational mathematics, the society regularly organizes conferences and workshops which bring together leading researchers in the diverse fields impinging on all aspects of computation. This book presents thirteen papers written by plenary speakers from the 1999 conference, all of whom are the foremost figures in their respective fields. Topics covered include complexity theory, approximation theory, optimization, computational geometry, stochastic systems and the computation of partial differential equations.\n\nAlgebraic Topology and Transformation Groups: Proceedings of a Conference held in GÃ¶ttingen, FRG, August 23-29, 1987\n\nTammo tom Dieck\n\nAlgebraic Topology\n\nTammo Tom DieckThis book is written as a textbook on algebraic topology. The first part covers the material for two introductory courses about homotopy and homology. The second part presents more advanced applications and concepts (duality, characteristic classes, homotopy groups of spheres, bordism). The author recommends starting an introductory course with homotopy theory. For this purpose, classical results are presented with new elementary proofs. Alternatively, one could start more traditionally with singular and axiomatic homology. Additional chapters are devoted to the geometry of manifolds, cell complexes and fibre bundles. A special feature is the rich supply of nearly 500 exercises and problems. Several sections include topics which have not appeared before in textbooks as well as simplified proofs for some important results. Prerequisites are standard point set topology (as recalled in the first chapter), elementary algebraic notions (modules, tensor product), and some terminology from category theory. The aim of the book is to introduce advanced undergraduate and graduate (master's) students to basic tools, concepts and results of algebraic topology. Sufficient background material from geometry and algebra is included. A publication of the European Mathematical Society (EMS). Distributed within the Americas by the American Mathematical Society.\n\nCalogero-Moser-Sutherland Models\n\nJan F. van Diejen, Luc VinetIn the 1970s F. Calogero and D. Sutherland discovered that for certain potentials in one-dimensional systems, but for any number of particles, the SchrÃ¶dinger eigenvalue problem is exactly solvable. Until then, there was only one known nontrivial example of an exactly solvable quantum multi-particle problem. J. Moser subsequently showed that the classical counterparts to these models is also amenable to an exact analytical approach. The last decade has witnessed a true explosion of activities involving Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models, and these now play a role in research areas ranging from theoretical physics (such as soliton theory, quantum field theory, string theory, solvable models of statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, and quantum chaos) to pure mathematics (such as representation theory, harmonic analysis, theory of special functions, combinatorics of symmetric functions, dynamical systems, random matrix theory, and complex geometry). The aim of this volume is to provide an overview of the many branches into which research on CMS systems has diversified in recent years. The contributions are by leading researchers from various disciplines in whose work CMS systems appear, either as the topic of investigation itself or as a tool for further applications.\n\nAlgebraic Methods and Q-Special Functions\n\nJan Felipe Van Diejen, Luc VinetThere has been revived interest in recent years in the study of special functions. Many of the latest advances in the field were inspired by the works of R. A. Askey and colleagues on basic hypergeometric series and I. G. Macdonald on orthogonal polynomials related to root systems. Significant progress was made by the use of algebraic techniques involving quantum groups, Hecke algebras, and combinatorial methods. The CRM organized a workshop for key researchers in the field to present an overview of current trends. This volume consists of the contributions to that workshop. The topics include basic hypergeometric functions, algebraic and representation-theoretic methods, combinatorics of symmetric functions, root systems, and the connections with integrable systems.\n\nLa Geometrie des groupes classiques\n\nJean Dieudonne\n\nLectures on Number Theory\n\nPeter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Richard Dedekind, P. G. L. DirichletThis volume is a translation of Dirichlet's Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Zahlentheorie which includes nine supplements by Dedekind and an introduction by John Stillwell, who translated the volume.\n\nLectures on Number Theory is the first of its kind on the subject matter. It covers most of the topics that are standard in a modern first course on number theory, but also includes Dirichlet's famous results on class numbers and primes in arithmetic progressions.\n\nThe book is suitable as a textbook, yet it also offers a fascinating historical perspective that links Gauss with modern number theory. The legendary story is told how Dirichlet kept a copy of Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae with him at all times and how Dirichlet strove to clarify and simplify Gauss's results. Dedekind's footnotes document what material Dirichlet took from Gauss, allowing insight into how Dirichlet transformed the ideas into essentially modern form.\n\nAlso shown is how Gauss built on a long tradition in number theoryâgoing back to Diophantusâand how it set the agenda for Dirichlet's work. This important book combines historical perspective with transcendent mathematical insight. The material is still fresh and presented in a "
