I consider that a change of the definition of UTC will reduce the credibility of our institution (time standards community) in the eye of the public. Seriously affected will be the users who use the position of the sun. A redefinition of UTC will change the calendar date of these events and have serious social impacts once it becomes known to the public.

Leap seconds are small enough that few people are inconvenienced and frequent enough that there are tested procedures on how to deal with them. Leap minutes or leap hours would be very disruptive. To drop the relationship with Earths rotation is to not deal with the issue and to kick the can down the road for someone else to deal with at a later time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=08_July_2011\n\nNom = Enfinger\n\nPrenom = Eugene Bryan\n\nInstitut = Enfinger & Assoc., LLC\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Celestial-mechanics Geodesy\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nLEAVE THE CURRENT SYSTEM AS IS!!!!!!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=08_July_2011\n\nNom = Finch\n\nPrenom = Tony\n\nInstitut = Univ. of Cambridge Computing Service\n\nPays = England\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nIf we are to continue leap seconds, they will be much more easy to handle if they are announced several years in advance, such that leap second tables can be distributed as part of a computer system's software.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=08_July_2011\n\nNom = Smith\n\nPrenom = Eric\n\nInstitut = Total Spectrum Software\n\nPays = Canada\n\nDomaine = Computer software\n\nReponse = I have another preference\n\nComment :\n\nI am generally satisfied with the current definition of UTC which includes leap seconds. However, I think it would be useful for leap seconds to be scheduled further in advance (for example several years, rather than 6 months). This would allow makers of computer systems to more readily schedule and prepare for leap seconds. This advantage would, I think, outweigh the difficulties in keeping DUT1 within 1 second over such a long period -- particularly if the alternative is to allow DUT1 to grow without bound!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=08_July_2011\n\nNom = Hall\n\nPrenom = Shannon\n\nInstitut = JHU/APL\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Geophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=08_July_2011\n\nNom = Seaman\n\nPrenom = Rob\n\nInstitut = National Optical Astronomy Observatory\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nI would support lengthening the forecast interval immediately to whatever value permits remaining within the 0.9s DUT1 limit - note that no change would be required to TF-460 to do this. The state of the art of EOP forecasts has improved dramatically since 1972 and we should benefit from that. I might additionally consider supporting the relaxation of the 0.9s limit to later permit lengthening the forecast interval further. Care should be taken with planning for any change to UTC. Due diligence has not been met by the current ITU-R process.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=08_July_2011\n\nNom = Vince\n\nPrenom = Peter\n\nInstitut = BBC Television\n\nPays = United Kingdom\n\nDomaine = Broadcast radio and television\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nUTC currently gives an accurate indication of the Earth's orientation - something most people have no interest in, particularly to the degree of accuracy achieved. Most people assume noon (12:00) to be when the sun is at its highest, but with the analemma effect, and especially daylight savings time, that is certainly not true.\n\nModern broadcasting and communication equipment needs an accurately synchronised reference, so variable frequencies tracking the Earth's rotation is not an option. With 24-hour broadcasting of mainly pre-recorded programmes, it is essential for professional continuity that the duration of the programme is known, and changing the clock time during the transmission of a programme negates this accuracy.\n\nLeap-seconds were a good idea in 1972 when people just had a few inaccurate analogue clocks, but now so much equipment has a clock, it is a nightmare to correct it all. There is also a cost penalty to do this, for the time and effort of the staff involved, and the confusion, if not danger, of them not being corrected and synchronised.\n\nI believe daylight-saving time should also be abolished, but that is another argument. At least let us take this opportunity to simplify time-keeping for the majority. There will be a cost penalty for the astronomers, but that is nothing to the cost currently incurred by everyone else. They already have to compensate for sidereal time and polar wobble - a slightly larger DUT-1 should be a very minor change.\n\nBut please ensure DUT-1 *IS* available to everyone, including modifying the LF radio time-signal data formats.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=08_July_2011\n\nNom = Müller\n\nPrenom = Ulrich\n\nInstitut = Institut für Kernphysik, Univ.

Hours, minutes and seconds are merely subdivisions of the millennia-old concept of the day. In other words, for thousands and thousands of years the definition of \"day\" and the time of day has been given by Mother Nature, i.e., by the Sun in the sky. What the outrageous ITU proposal is effectively asking us to do is to give up our trust in Mother Nature in the matters of time of day and to vest our trust instead in the racks of strange equipment operated by a bunch of guys in lab coats.\n\nUniversal Time means mean solar time.

Furthermore, this time reference must be constant (i.e. the definition of one second must not vary), as otherwise any frequency-based calculations would be inaccurate.\n\nUnfortunately, seismologists universally use UTC and not TAI for this time source. As a software engineer dealing with acquisition, transmission and processing systems I know from my own experience and from observing other software in the field that leap seconds are an area of huge complexity, often doubling the amount of code required for any timestamp-related task. Furthermore, each leap second occurrence leads to a raft of system failures across all manufacturers.\n\nChanging the definition of UTC to be TAI with a constant offset would greatly simplify the task of writing and maintaining software and remove an area of significant concern.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=09_July_2011\n\nNom = Trueblood\n\nPrenom = Mark\n\nInstitut = National Optical Astronomy Observatory\n\nPays = United States of America\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nCan you imagine the havoc created by this proposal to make UTC an atomic time? The civil time of\n\nday MUST be tied to the Earth's rotation. This rotation is gradually slowing due to tidal friction with\n\nthe Moon. Therefore, we need to continue to introduce leap seconds into the time to keep our\n\nclocks in synch with where the Sun is in the sky. Over a period of centuries, the proposed change to\n\nan atomic time would make us rise at odd hours of the day, and make it impossible to point\n\ntelescopes accurately.

Tidal friction is a torque that causes a quadratic deceleration of Earth's orientation. The simplest model of tidal friction is a constant deceleration that will cause the angular velocity (Earth's inertial spin) to decrease linearly and its angular displacement to lag in a quadratic curve. The current definition of UT1 comes from the formula from Capitaine et al, and that formula converts Earth orientation angle into UT1. Since the formula was first published in 1986, the epoch associated with the data is circa 1980, maybe 1981. The last two leap seconds roughly fit a quadratic curve after that epoch, which remarkably fits the tidal friction curve. Christodoulidis et al (1988) obtained -5.98±.22E-22 rad/sec2 from analyzing 17 artificial satellites. From the fossil record, I obtained a value of -5.99±1.77E-22 rad/sec2 was obtained from 17 studies involving 44 fossils.\n\nIt is a straightforward statistical test to show that the last two leap seconds do not come from the same population of leap seconds between 1972 and 1998. The Dec 2005 leap second was 11.96 st. dev. off and the Dec 2008 leap second was 3.96 s.d. off. Both fail the 99.9% acceptance test.\n\nKnowing that result, the divergence between TAI and UT1 between 1958 and 1998 is nearly linear. If you review the processing of that time, (See Markowitz 1968 in Telescopes) the operational epoch was advanced every day when PZT data were taken and processed. Moving the epoch would hide tidal friction under the noise in the measurements. Now, VLBI gets Earth orientation data very precisely. The operational epoch is now frozen (embedded in Capitaine et al formula), and tidal friction is now revealed in divergence between UT1 and TAI. There is no uniform divergence anymore. In a few decades, tidal friction will invalidate the Capitaine et al formula that obtains UT1, because tidal friction was never incorporated into the derivation.\n\nI firmly believe that the timekeeping community should postpone the vote until it thoroughly reviews the effects of tidal friction, which is not incorporated into the current prediction models for the divergence between UT and TAI, and definitely not in the Capitaine et al formula that defines UT1.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=10_July_2011\n\nNom = Bertou\n\nPrenom = Xavier\n\nInstitut = Centro Atómico Bariloche\n\nPays = Argentina\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=10_July_2011\n\nNom = Goodwin\n\nPrenom = Julien\n\nInstitut = -\n\nPays = Australia\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=10_July_2011\n\nNom = Lynch-Aird\n\nPrenom = Nicolas\n\nInstitut = Independent\n\nPays = UK\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nLeap seconds should be retained as the ongoing mechanism for maintaining UTC close to UT1. Allowing UTC to drift away from UT1 will necessitate larger corrections to be made at some unspecified point in the future which will be far more disruptive than the current system of introducing leap seconds.\n\nIt would be of greater benefit to extend the time code transmission standards in such a way as to enable automated systems to be able to detect an upcoming leap second in advance of the event. Assuming that the transmission of DUT1 is retained then this only requires one extra bit of information - the sign of the leap second can be determined from the sign of the preceeding value of DUT1. It would be beneficial also to include additional flags in the transmitted data to indicate an upcoming change in the transmitted value of DUT1.\n\nFinally the time code standard should be made freely and publicly available. In this way equipment manufacturers will be more readily able to develop systems that can respond in a wholly automated manner to changes in DUT1 and the introduction of leap seconds.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=10_July_2011\n\nNom = Scott-Thoennes\n\nPrenom = Yitzchak\n\nInstitut = Shiftboard\n\nPays = US\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=10_July_2011\n\nNom = Kapounek\n\nPrenom = Petr\n\nInstitut = comerce sphere\n\nPays = Czech Republic\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=10_July_2011\n\nNom = Verhaege\n\nPrenom = Christophe\n\nInstitut = Laboratoire de Météorolige Physique\n\nPays = France\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=11_July_2011\n\nNom = Lim\n\nPrenom = Peter\n\nInstitut = Nil\n\nPays = Singapore\n\nDomaine = NIL\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nNIL.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=11_July_2011\n\nNom = Siddiqui\n\nPrenom = Hassan\n\nInstitut = ESA/ESAC\n\nPays = Spain\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nHaving a time scale that is discontinuous causes a lot of problems with writing and maintaining software for processing non-ground-based astronomical missions, and in particular the link to the spacecraft and the ground segment. It would help immensely if UTC is redefined such that it represents terrestrial time in as simple a way as possible.\n\nOf course, a counter-argument for my request is to simply use TAI right now instead of UTC - if in the future the difference would be a constant. This is in fact my preference. However, a lot of ground based activities are heavily intertwined to UTC, it is best to work on making that system simpler.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=11_July_2011\n\nNom = Herrero\n\nPrenom = Javier\n\nInstitut = HV Sistemas S.L.\n\nPays = Spain\n\nDomaine = Space-sciences\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=11_July_2011\n\nNom = Meyer\n\nPrenom = François\n\nInstitut = Observatoire de Besançon\n\nPays = France\n\nDomaine = Time-laboratory\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nIt seems that addressing the main engineering concerns\n\ngenerated by leap seconds, could be greatly simplified\n\nby enhancing the accessibility and timespan of the leap\n\nsecond table :\n\nsuch a table, would list not only past leap seconds but\n\nalso scheduled leap seconds for the next 10 years (instead\n\nof the 6 month notice that is in use today), and should be\n\nmade widely available.\n\nInvolving only minimal changes, this would be a good, conservative\n\ncompromise, both preserving the UT feature of UTC (which should not be\n\nthrown away lightly in my opinion) and smoothing its\n\nengineering drawbacks, at least for the next centuries\n\nas long as the average frequency of leap seconds remains\n\nbelow one per month.\n\n--\n\nF.

We receive notifications of leap seconds via\n\nthe IERS bulletin. Our systems can be programmed such that the leap second\n\nis introduced automatically: this involves setting hardware switches on the\n\nclocks to specify when the leap second is to be introduced and updating control\n\nsystem parameter to say when it is to be expected.\n\nSince the clock is autonomous we have also omitted programming the leap second\n\n(e.g. on 31-Dec-2011) and introduced manually it later (when it's not a holiday).\n\nSo we can cope fine with leap seconds. Omitting leap seconds will create some\n\nmore work (although with our independent clocks we could avoid this).\n\nOverall I think the argument is about whether UTC should be related to the sun.\n\nSince all of us still live on the planet (earth) it make sense to continue the\n\ncurrent regime.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=11_July_2011\n\nNom = Swaters\n\nPrenom = Robert\n\nInstitut = NOAO\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=11_July_2011\n\nNom = Murray\n\nPrenom = Stephen\n\nInstitut = Johns Hopkins University\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nI do not think a change in the current definition of UTC is good for astronomy and celestial navigation activities.

However, I have opinions about other aspects of the process.\n\nAny time scale that does not closely track UT1 would not be a form of UT, and should not have a UT-related name. Specifically, the time scale resulting from initially synchronising with present UTC and then not applying leap seconds would not be a form of UT, and so should not be called \"UTC\". The name \"International Time\" with initialism \"TI\" has been proposed for such a time scale, and I would find that entirely satisfactory. It should, of course, be clearly defined whether proleptic TI matches UTC over UTC's prior period of operation or remains a constant offset from TAI; I think the latter is more manageable.\n\nAlthough many users would prefer a leap-second-less time scale, and many more can at least accept one, it is not feasible to force such a time scale on all present users of UTC. Some would continue to desire a time scale behaving like the present form of UTC, with leap seconds. If such a scale is not readily available then it will be necessary to invent one, but local reinvention repeated by many users would cause a proliferation of badly-managed not-quite-compatible time scales. Thus it would remain useful for IERS to issue canonical leap second decisions for such users, defining a standard time scale that would continue to behave as the current UTC does. This time scale should probably be named \"UTC\".\n\nThe decision about the time scale that is used in broadcast dissemination of time should be divorced from other questions about UTC. The broadcast time scale may sensibly be UTC as presently defined, TAI plus an offset (TI as described above), or plain TAI. Whichever is chosen as the primary broadcast time scale, broadcasts should where possible carry the parameters needed to convert between UTC-with-leap-seconds and TI/TAI. Where those parameters are readily available, the exact choice of primary time scale becomes much less significant.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=11_July_2011\n\nNom = Flanders\n\nPrenom = Tony\n\nInstitut = Sky & Telescope\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nPresumably, civil time would continue to be tied to UTC.

In my opinion, it is important to have a basis for legal times (UTC) which follows solar times (UT1). If UTC is a source of problems because of its discontinuities, UTC should simply disappear et be replaced by TAI. UTC is useful precisely because of its discontinuities. A temporary solution could be to create a new timescale, continuous, in parallel to UTC, which would stay the basis of legal timescales. This new continuous timescale would be used for tests only, and could have a permanent entire offset with TAI, which could be the actual value of TAI-UTC. But my preference is to keep the actual definition of UTC, which includes leap second.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = Tang\n\nPrenom = Jingshi\n\nInstitut = Astronomy department, Nanjing University\n\nPays = China\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Celestial-mechanics Geodesy\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = Schittel\n\nPrenom = Christoph\n\nInstitut = Plusnet GmbH & Co.

Systems that handle only one time scale simply don't see anything and run seemlessly when leap seconds occur. So for ALL these systems, regardless of their implementation, leap seconds are clearly not a problem.\n\nHowever, ALL these systems are based on assumption DUT1 remains small (less than 0.9s in the current setup). A few high precision systems track this value from IERS files, almost all systems do not track it and consider it to be 0. Removing the leap second would mean ALL systems should track DUT1 as the simplifying assumption would not hold anymore. This would imply modifying data handling, importing external data in operational systems that did not import anything beforehand, modifying ALL software layers to propagate this DUT1 down to the lower layers for frames transforms, revalidating EVERY space flight dynamics in the world. So for all systems except the very few high precision and costly ones that have already done this work, removing the leap second would in fact induce a lot of difficult work.\n\nThere are plenty of fixed time scales already available (TAI, GPS, Galileo ...) and only one time scale that is a convenient compromise between purely geometric TU1 and regular physics TAI, lets keep it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = DEFRAIGNE\n\nPrenom = PASCALE\n\nInstitut = ROYAL OBSERVATORY OF BELGIUM\n\nPays = BELGIUM\n\nDomaine = Time-laboratory\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = Street\n\nPrenom = Jim\n\nInstitut = N/A\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = poggi\n\nPrenom = jerome\n\nInstitut = -\n\nPays = France\n\nDomaine = Governement\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = Saers\n\nPrenom = Paul\n\nInstitut = private\n\nPays = Sweden\n\nDomaine = Computing industry\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = Aerts\n\nPrenom = Wim\n\nInstitut = ROB\n\nPays = Belgium\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication Time-laboratory\n\nReponse = I have another preference\n\nComment :\n\nWhy not introducing leap minutes instead of leap seconds?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011\n\nNom = Helk\n\nPrenom = Frank\n\nInstitut = -\n\nPays = Germany\n\nDomaine = process computing\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nIf there's a need for another time refrence -

However, there are unknown numbers of applications in existence which, explicitly or implicitly, rely on the distributed time to be close to UT1. So the choice is between continuing to distribute an approximation to UT1 or accepting that problems will occur.\n\nWith the ubiquitous use of NTP, I believe there is now an opportunity to separate civil time from the high-precision time/frequency dissemination services. This would be done by providing UT1-based NTP servers, for dissemination of ordinary time-of-day and expressly intended for applications not requiring accuracies of better than 0.1s. We could call it GMT, which many countries still refer to in their laws. (The fact the the US law was changed not long ago to say UTC is regrettable but should not be allowed to influence the debate.)\n\nThe existing time/frequency dissemination services would by default distribute leapless UTC. As the difference between this and UT1 grows, developers of computer applications would become used to the idea that they had to make a choice - which they do now, in principle.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011 , 14h16\n\nNom = Jubier\n\nPrenom = Xavier\n\nInstitut = None\n\nPays = France\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nI have nothing against a change. However, I would point out that each definition has its merit. So why change if it doesn't really bring anything or simplify computations.\n\nAs for predictions of eclipses in future years (especially within the next 100 years) the proposal to cease inserting leap seconds (that is, keeping UTC fixed with respect to TT) has significant merit  it will allow accurate UTC predictions to be issued many years before the event. Nevertheless it doesn't change anything since the difference between UT1 and UTC would henceforth be unconstrained!\n\nAt the same time, the current prediction methodology contains two unknowns for future predictions. The conversion from TT to UTC, and the rotational position of the Earth (UT1-UTC). Of these, the effect of the uncertainty in prediction times resulting from the conversion from TT to UTC is an order of magnitude greater than the effects of the rotation of the Earth over the same time period. However if leap seconds are discontinued, the two uncertainties are reduced to just one  the rotational orientation of the Earth.

For those for whom UTC leap seconds present a problem, we already have TAI and GPS time which are uniformly increasing atomic time scales. With the advent of GNSS, anyone anywhere in the world has access to GPS time at very little cost. GLONASS, and I believe some SBAS systems, provide UTC. Additional systems coming on-line, including QZSS and Galileo, essentially also provide GPS time with extremely small offsets. Conversion algorithms between UTC and TAI or GPS border on trivial and are readily available. Those of us who perform precision calculations will continue to require time transformations, even if the leap seconds are eliminated going forward. If you want to hide leap seconds from public view, simply coordinate public clocks to TAI or GPS time!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011 , 17h28\n\nNom = Johnson\n\nPrenom = Thomas\n\nInstitut = National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Geodesy Geophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nWhile one may think that knowledge and understanding of our universe is a true goal of science, in reality, it is not. The ultimate goal of science and its pursuit of greater knowledge is for the improvement of society. While predicting and keeping UTC aligned with the earth's rotation is not an easy task, it has benefits to society and therefore, should be maintained. For example, there are many users of UTC from around the world that have built their systems on the assumption of UTC being coordinated with the earth rotation. The decoupling of these systems would result in a great deal of work and financial expense to correct, all of which is unnecessary.\n\nFurthermore, this is one indirect benefit to having leap seconds. Every time a leap second is inserted, the public media has to reach out to the scientific community to educate its consumer on the physics behind the need for this adjustment. Therefore, the general population gets a science lesson reminding them of the importance of astronomy and geophysics in their daily lives.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011 , 17h42\n\nNom = Stefan\n\nPrenom = Krista\n\nInstitut = Royal Astronomical Society of Canada\n\nPays = Canada\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011 , 17h42\n\nNom = Capitaine\n\nPrenom = Nicole\n\nInstitut = Bureau des longitudes& Paris Observatory\n\nPays = France\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Celestial-mechanics Geodesy\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\nComment :\n\n- Separating the two concepts (angle for UT1,time for UTC) would be an improvement for high-accuracy applications.\n\n- UT1 is defined by a conventional linear relation to ERA and benefits from the accuracy of that angle; for its best scientific use, that angle varying with time must be referred to an uniform time scale.\n\n- The definition of UT1 is such that it is kept approximately (but not strictly) in phase with the mean solar time; so it in fact differs from the mean solar time +12 h and the difference is increasing with time.\n\n- The definition of UTC based on leap seconds was designed to provide sufficient approximation to UT1 to celestial navigation; this is obsolete. For scientific applications, the use of the best uniform time scale is required (without leap seconds).\n\n- If leap seconds are removed, the gap between UTC and UT1 will reach 3 min in 2100, 30 min in 2700, differences that are below those between legal time and solar time (+12h) that we tolerate.\n\n- Scientific applications requiring prediction of UT1-UTC, such as precise astronomical ephemerides, can be established based on an IERS UT1-UTC prediction, leading to an accuracy at least as good as access to the UT1 derived from UTC with leap seconds.\n\n- The responsibility of the IERS will be increased with the new interesting charge of providing predictions of the difference between UT1 and UTC, or UT1(UTC), in order to provide access to UT1 in real time. These values can easily be disseminated by positioning systems, such as GPS, which would give access to UT1 in real time to a wide categories of users.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011 , 17h48\n\nNom = Mabie\n\nPrenom = Justin\n\nInstitut = NOAA\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Space-sciences\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nNo such change in the defintion of UTC should be considered. Instead, the community should propose a new timescale that is referenced off of UTC. There are several reasons for this.\n\n1) It seems there is no proposed mechanism for the transition, between conversion of data to the new timescale or to update algorithms, instruments, and models that depend on the current definitoin of UTC.\n\n2) Any change in the defintion of UTC would require a secondary timescale so that conversions can be made from the old defintion to the new definition. Any such timescale would in of itself serve the same purpose as the proposed change and is therefore unnecesarry.\n\n3) This propposal would create unnecesarry confusion that could be avoided with an alternate such as the option of creating a new timescale.\n\n4) Any errors or failure to adequately track conversions from the old to the new defintions could seriously effect research, particularly with regard to dynamics on timescales of one second or less. It should be noted that international metadata standards, although robust, do not even adequately address the needs of modern datasets, and are not used sufficiently to provide the capabilities for which they are intended. Certainly, application of a redefined timescale would add serious problems to meatadata tracking. In addition to this, historical datasets that have not yet been fully modernized, do not abide by any metadata standard and risk having their proper time stamps corrupted during the modernization process.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=12_July_2011 , 18h09\n\nNom = wilson\n\nPrenom = keith\n\nInstitut = Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Geodesy\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nI am also concerned about the change in delivery of the dEps, dPsi,EOP parameters.

In general we are quite satisfied with the current definition of UTC, leap seconds do not pose a problem for us. In any case, for detailed UT1 information we need to access specific IERS files, and this would not change if the UTC definition changes, so there is no impact. So the only benefit for us of a new UTC definition would be a constant offset between GPS Time and UTC, this means that we would have one interface less, we would not need to update GPSt-UTC when leap seconds happen (normally a text file in our system). On the other hand, having UTC tied to UT1 (current definition) is very nice for approximate calculations and simple software tools. For example, if you are using Two Line Elements (TLEs) to calculate approximate satellite orbits, it is quite useful to know that if you interpolate the model using UTC (current) instead of UT1 the resulting accuracy will be within the noise of the TLEs. There is also the issue of backward compatibility, if the UTC definition changes, there might be some side effects in our software that could make it fail, we would have to review the current code carefully. From a \"philosophical\" point of view, I feel more comfortable knowing that UTC, the time on my watch, is also linked to the Earth rotation and not only to atomic clocks, I believe the current definition is a good compromise between the \"two worlds\" and that is why it was invented.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=13_July_2011 , 15h42\n\nNom = Woodburn\n\nPrenom = James\n\nInstitut = AGI\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Celestial-mechanics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nThe proposed redefinition of UTC would cause a gradual degradation of many satellite systems which assume alignment between UT1 and civil time. While these systems could be updated, at considerable cost, I am concerned that many operators or users of these systems may not even be aware of the assumption and therefore would not recognize the need for change. As the degradation would be very gradual, system performance would slowly suffer but perhaps not come to a breaking point until the redefinition of civil time was a distant memory.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=13_July_2011 , 16h18\n\nNom = Dries\n\nPrenom = Jan\n\nInstitut = VITO\n\nPays = Belgium\n\nDomaine = Earth Observation\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=13_July_2011 , 16h35\n\nNom = Chandler\n\nPrenom = John\n\nInstitut = Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=13_July_2011 , 17h10\n\nNom = GUINOT\n\nPrenom = BERNARD\n\nInstitut = Obs. de Paris, Bureau des longitudes\n\nPays = France\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Geodesy Space-sciences Time-laboratory Former sailor (navigation officer)\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nPresent definition of UTC causes an ambiguity of date at the occurrence of a positive leap second which is potentially dangerous.\n\nIt favors the existence of several time scales differing by an integer number of seconds.\n\nThe present system was devised in 1972 in order to provide directly by radio time signals the needed accuracy of UT1 for celestial navigation (+/- 1 second).\n\nThis need (which may persist for safety reasons) can be fufilled by expressing hour angles in printed nautical ephemeredes as a function of a continuous UTC (based on a prediction which can be made at the second level over 3 years).\n\nFor a better precision, UT1 is easily available by internet in real time at the level of a few milliseconds.\n\nI recall that a continuous UTC will diverge from UT1 by one or two minutes in 2100 and will reach half an hour toward 2500-2600.

I understand the desire to eliminate leap seconds and the discontinuities that they cause. But I feel that we'd have to do extensive surveys, research and careful evaluation before we could determine the extent (likely quite a large impact) of software modifications, financial impacts and programmer/developer time required to eliminate the leap second (thereby potentially causing existing applications to 'break').\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=13_July_2011 , 19h45\n\nNom = ACTIS\n\nPrenom = Eloy\n\nInstitut = Observatorio mAstronómico Félix Aguilar\n\nPays = ARGENTINA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Geodesy Satellite Laser Ranging\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nCurrent definition of UTC works very good and I don't feel neccessity of changing it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=13_July_2011 , 19h58\n\nNom = Kouprianov\n\nPrenom = Vladimir\n\nInstitut = Pulkovo Observatory\n\nPays = Russia\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics Space-sciences\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=13_July_2011 , 21h23\n\nNom = Connors\n\nPrenom = John\n\nInstitut = Private Individual\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics GPS commercial user, Astro & Celest Nav\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nAfter thoroughly reading the provided references, the cost of changing the UTC leap second system / time standard (ref #2, V The Debate, D Costs of Changing) is not justified or technically warranted. The assumptions favoring the change are weak and favor academia and the scientific community. The commercial realm and public users are not well represented in these papers and government (tax payers), including commercial end users, are expected or assumed to absorb the cost (of redesign). Removing the leap second or making UTC more dynamically linked to the earths rotation is an expensive step backwards.

The most compelling reason for eliminating leap seconds seems to be that they will have to be introduced with increasing frequency in the future; however, that should not become an important concern for several centuries. Meanwhile, eliminating leap seconds now would leave us with four time atomic scales that differ from TAI only by a fixed offset (TAI, TT, GPS, and UTC), while providing no atomic-based time scale that maintains synchronization with UT1 (an important consideration for civil timekeeping). Dropping leap seconds from the definition of UTC now would be, at best, premature.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=14_July_2011 , 01h09\n\nNom = Shawhan\n\nPrenom = Peter\n\nInstitut = University of Maryland\n\nPays = USA\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=14_July_2011 , 04h25\n\nNom = Bizouard\n\nPrenom = Marie-Anne\n\nInstitut = Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire\n\nPays = France\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=14_July_2011 , 07h54\n\nNom = Cannon\n\nPrenom = Kipp\n\nInstitut = Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astr.\n\nPays = Canada\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nThe motivation for removing the leap seconds from UTC is a mystery.\n\nIf UTC is not the correct time scale for an application, then there are many more to choose from. UTC is just one of a dozen or more time scales that are in regular use: TAI, UT0, UT1, UT1R, UT2, UT2R, UTC, GMST, GPS time, Julian day number, Unix time, .... In particular, several of them are atomic time scales free of leap seconds. For example, TAI, the count of GPS seconds, Unix time, and so on. Anyone who wishes to use a leap-second-free atomic time scale for their application is already free to use one of these. The conversions between these time scales and UTC are simple and well-documented.\n\n-Kipp\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=14_July_2011 , 10h08\n\nNom = McIver\n\nPrenom = Jessica\n\nInstitut = University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nPays = United States\n\nDomaine = Gravitational wave physics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=14_July_2011 , 11h52\n\nNom = Skinner\n\nPrenom = Laurence\n\nInstitut = -\n\nPays = England\n\nDomaine = Host an NTP Pool time server\n\nReponse = I am not satisfied and prefer UTC redefined without leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=14_July_2011 , 13h26\n\nNom = Loh\n\nPrenom = Jürgen\n\nInstitut = Alpermann+Velte e.e.

Quitting the leap second we accept that UTC is no more fixed to the rotation of the Earth and our concept of time is not related to the variation of day and night. But we cannot quit the fact that half of the Earth is illuminated by the Sun, half is in darkness, and due to the rotation of the Earth we see the regular variation of day and night. If we accept the concept that this has no meaning in our life, we can quit the connection of the UTC to the rotation of the Earth. We can as well quit then the time zones, length of 24h day or incompatible length of the year with leap days every fourth year. All these are as well technically possible. But if we want follow day and night variation, then within decades we'll need a leap minute or within millennia a leap hour... Are these any better than the leap seconds?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=15_July_2011 , 01h15\n\nNom = Boriani\n\nPrenom = Azelio\n\nInstitut = SSBT spa\n\nPays = Italy\n\nDomaine = Digital TV broadcast equipment\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=15_July_2011 , 07h41\n\nNom = Spencer\n\nPrenom = Mark\n\nInstitut = Aligned Solutions\n\nPays = Caada\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication Information technology\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=15_July_2011 , 09h33\n\nNom = Orlati\n\nPrenom = Andrea\n\nInstitut = INAF-IRA\n\nPays = Italy\n\nDomaine = Astronomy-Astrophysics\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate=15_July_2011 , 09h51\n\nNom = Young\n\nPrenom = Iain\n\nInstitut = n/a\n\nPays = United Kingdom\n\nDomaine = Telecommunication Time-laboratory\n\nReponse = I am satisfied with the current definition of UTC with leap of second\n\nComment :\n\nTAI and GPS timescales are already avaliable should folks need or want a timescale without leap seconds.
