PDF generated at: Sun, 21 Jun 2009 15:07:03 UTC Algebraic Quantum Topology Table of contents Introduction Main article Mathematics Supporting articles History of mathematics Mathematical beauty Mathematical notation Symmetry Symmetry generally conveys two primary meanings. The first is an imprecise sense of harmonious or aesthetically pleasing proportionality and balance; such that it reflects beauty or perfection. The second meaning is a precise and well-defined concept of balance or \"patterned self-similarity\" that can be demonstrated or proved according to the rules of a formal system: by geometry, through physics or otherwise. Although the meanings are distinguishable in some contexts, both meanings of \"symmetry\" are related and discussed in parallel.' 11 [2] The \"precise\" notions of symmetry have various measures and operational definitions. For example, symmetry may be observed: • with respect to the passage of time; • as a spatial relationship; • through geometric transformations such as scaling, reflection, and rotation; • through other kinds of functional transformations ; and /& ^ I r\\ 2 x^^ Sphere symmetrical group o. Symmetry • as an aspect of abstract objects, theoretic models, language, music and even knowledge itself. This article describes these notions of symmetry from three perspectives. The first is that of mathematics, in which symmetries are defined and categorized precisely. The second perspective describes symmetry as it relates to science and technology. In this context, symmetries underlie some of the most profound results found in modern physics, including aspects of space and time. Finally, a third perspective discusses symmetry in the humanities, covering its rich and varied use in history, architecture, art, and religion. The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry. Symmetry in the field of mathematics ..,. ,,,.,» .- ;p:i': hW-J* Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man (ca. 1487) is often used as a representation of symmetry in the human body and, by extension, the natural universe. In formal terms, we say that an object is symmetric with respect to a given mathematical operation, if, when applied to the object, this operation does not change the object or its appearance. Two objects are symmetric to each other with respect to a given group of operations if one is obtained from the other by some of the operations (and vice versa). Symmetries may also be found in living organisms including humans and other animals (see symmetry in biology below). In 2D geometry the main kinds of symmetry of interest are with respect to the basic Euclidean plane isometries: translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. Mathematical model for symmetry The set of all symmetry operations considered, on all objects in a set X, can be modeled as a group action g -. G x X -> X, where the image of g in G and x in X is written as g-x. If, for some g, g-x = y then x and y are said to be symmetrical to each other. For each object x, operations g for which g-x = x form a group, the symmetry group of the object, a subgroup of G. If the symmetry group of x is the trivial group then x is said to be asymmetric, otherwise symmetric. A general example is that G is a group of bijections g-. V -> V acting on the set of functions x: V -> W by (gx)(v)=x(g (v)) (or a restricted set of such functions that is closed under the group action). Thus a group of bijections of space induces a group action on \"objects\" in it. The symmetry group of x consists of all g for which x(v)=x(g(v)) for all v. G is the symmetry group of the space itself, and of any object that is uniform throughout space. Some subgroups of G may not be the symmetry group of any object. For example, if the group contains for every v and w in V a g such that g(v)=w, then only the symmetry groups of constant functions x contain that group. However, the symmetry group of constant functions is G itself. In a modified version for vector fields, we have (gx)(v)=h(g,x(g (v))) where h rotates any vectors and pseudovectors in x, and inverts any vectors (but not pseudovectors) according Symmetry to rotation and inversion in g, see symmetry in physics. The symmetry group of x consists of all g for which x(v)=h(g,x(g(v))) for all v. In this case the symmetry group of a constant function may be a proper subgroup of G: a constant vector has only rotational symmetry with respect to rotation about an axis if that axis is in the direction of the vector, and only inversion symmetry if it is zero. For a common notion of symmetry in Euclidean space, G is the Euclidean group E(n), the group of isometries, and V is the Euclidean space. The rotation group of an object is the symmetry group if G is restricted to E + (n), the group of direct isometries. (For generalizations, see the next subsection.) Objects can be modeled as functions x, of which a value may represent a selection of properties such as color, density, chemical composition, etc. Depending on the selection we consider just symmetries of sets of points (x is just a boolean function of position v), or, at the other extreme, e.g. symmetry of right and left hand with all their structure. For a given symmetry group, the properties of part of the object, fully define the whole object. Considering points equivalent which, due to the symmetry, have the same properties, the equivalence classes are the orbits of the group action on the space itself. We need the value of x at one point in every orbit to define the full object. A set of such representatives forms a fundamental domain. The smallest fundamental domain does not have a symmetry; in this sense, one can say that symmetry relies upon asymmetry. An object with a desired symmetry can be produced by choosing for every orbit a single function value. Starting from a given object x we can e.g.: • take the values in a fundamental domain (i.e., add copies of the object) • take for each orbit some kind of average or sum of the values of x at the points of the orbit (ditto, where the copies may overlap) If it is desired to have no more symmetry than that in the symmetry group, then the object to be copied should be asymmetric. As pointed out above, some groups of isometries are not the symmetry group of any object, except in the modified model for vector fields. For example, this applies in ID for the group of all translations. The fundamental domain is only one point, so we can not make it asymmetric, so any \"pattern\" invariant under translation is also invariant under reflection (these are the uniform \"patterns\"). In the vector field version continuous translational symmetry does not imply reflectional symmetry: the function value is constant, but if it contains nonzero vectors, there is no reflectional symmetry. If there is also reflectional symmetry, the constant function value contains no nonzero vectors, but it may contain nonzero pseudovectors. A corresponding 3D example is an infinite cylinder with a current perpendicular to the axis; the magnetic field (a pseudovector) is, in the direction of the cylinder, constant, but nonzero. For vectors (in particular the current density) we have symmetry in every plane perpendicular to the cylinder, as well as cylindrical symmetry. This cylindrical symmetry without mirror planes through the axis is also only possible in the vector field version of the symmetry concept. A similar example is a cylinder rotating about its axis, where magnetic field and current density are replaced by angular momentum and velocity, respectively. A symmetry group is said to act transitively on a repeated feature of an object if, for every pair of occurrences of the feature there is a symmetry operation mapping the first to the second. For example, in ID, the symmetry group of {...,1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,...} acts Symmetry transitively on all these points, while {...,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,13,14,15,...} does not act transitively on all points. Equivalently, the first set is only one conjugacy class with respect to isometries, while the second has two classes. Non-isometric symmetry As mentioned above, G (the symmetry group of the space itself) may differ from the Euclidean group, the group of isometries. Examples: • G is the group of similarity transformations, i.e. affine transformations with a matrix A that is a scalar times an orthogonal matrix. Thus dilations are added, self-similarity is considered a symmetry • G is the group of affine transformations with a matrix A with determinant 1 or -1, i.e. the transformation which preserve area; this adds e.g. oblique reflection symmetry. • G is the group of all bijective affine transformations • In inversive geometry, G includes circle reflections, etc. Directional symmetry Reflection symmetry Reflection symmetry, mirror symmetry, mirror-image symmetry, or bilateral symmetry is symmetry with respect to reflection. In ID, there is a point of symmetry. In 2D there is an axis of symmetry, in 3D a plane of symmetry. An object or figure which is indistinguishable from its transformed image is called mirror symmetric (see mirror image). The axis of symmetry of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the axis of symmetry are identical. Another way to think about it is that if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry, for the same reason. If the letter T is reflected along a vertical axis, it appears the same. Note that this is sometimes called horizontal symmetry, and sometimes vertical symmetry! One can better use an unambiguous formulation, e.g. \"T has a vertical symmetry axis\" or \"T has left-right symmetry.\" The triangles with this symmetry are isosceles, the quadrilaterals with this symmetry are the kites and the isosceles trapezoids. For each line or plane of reflection, the symmetry group is isomorphic with Cs (see point groups in three dimensions), one of the three types of order two (involutions), hence algebraically C2. The fundamental domain is a half-plane or half-space. Bilateria (bilateral animals, including humans) are more or less symmetric with respect to the sagittal plane. In certain contexts there is rotational symmetry anyway. Then mirror-image symmetry is equivalent with inversion symmetry; in such contexts in modern physics the term Symmetry P-symmetry is used for both (P stands for parity). For more general types of reflection there are corresponding more general types of reflection symmetry. Examples: • with respect to a non-isometric affine involution (an oblique reflection in a line, plane, etc). • with respect to circle inversion Rotational symmetry Rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in m-dimensional Euclidean space. Rotations are direct isometries, i.e., isometries preserving orientation. Therefore a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of E + {m). Symmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations, and the symmetry group is the whole E + (m). This does not apply for objects because it makes space homogeneous, but it may apply for physical laws. For symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin. These rotations form the special orthogonal group SO(m), the group of mxm orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. For m=3 this is the rotation group. In another meaning of the word, the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within .B + (n), the group of direct isometries; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries. For chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group. Laws of physics are SO(3)-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space. Because of Noether's theorem, rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law. See also rotational invariance. Translational symmetry Translational symmetry leaves an object invariant under a discrete or continuous group of translations T a (p) = p + a . Glide reflection symmetry A glide reflection symmetry (in 3D: a glide plane symmetry) means that a reflection in a line or plane combined with a translation along the line / in the plane, results in the same object. It implies translational symmetry with twice the translation vector. The symmetry group is isomorphic with Z. Symmetry Rotoreflection symmetry In 3D, rotoreflection or improper rotation in the strict sense is rotation about an axis, combined with reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis. As symmetry groups with regard to a roto-reflection we can distinguish: • the angle has no common divisor with 360°, the symmetry group is not discrete • 2n-fold rotoreflection (angle of 180°/n) with symmetry group S of order 2n (not to be confused with symmetric groups, for which the same notation is used; abstract group C„ ); a special case is n = l, inversion, because it does not depend on the axis and the plane, it is characterized by just the point of inversion. • C , (angle of 360°/n); for odd n this is generated by a single symmetry, and the abstract group is C , for even n this is not a basic symmetry but a combination. See also point groups in three dimensions. Helical symmetry Helical symmetry is the kind of symmetry seen in such everyday objects as springs, Slinky toys, drill bits, and augers. It can be thought of as rotational symmetry along with translation along the axis of rotation, the screw axis). The concept of helical symmetry can be visualized as the tracing in three-dimensional space that results from rotating an object at an even angular speed while simultaneously moving at another even speed along its axis of rotation (translation). At any one point in time, these two motions combine to give a coiling angle that helps define the properties of the tracing. When the tracing object rotates quickly and translates slowly, the coiling angle will be close to 0°. Conversely, if the rotation is slow and the translation speedy, the coiling angle will approach 90°. Three main classes of helical symmetry can be distinguished based on the interplay of the angle of coiling and translation symmetries along the axis: • Infinite helical symmetry. If there are no distinguishing features along the length of a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point along the length of the object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an auger or screw bit that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger. Symmetry • n-fold helical symmetry. If the requirement that every cross section of the helical object be identical is relaxed, additional lesser helical symmetries become possible. For example, the cross section of the helical object may change, but still repeats itself in a regular fashion along the axis of the helical object. Consequently, objects of this type will exhibit a symmetry after a rotation by some fixed angle 9 and a translation by some fixed distance, but will not in general be invariant for any rotation angle. If the angle (rotation) at which the symmetry occurs divides evenly into a full circle (360°), the result is the helical equivalent of a regular polygon. This case is called n-fold helical symmetry, where n = 360°/ 9 , see e.g. double helix. This concept can be further generalized to include cases where m9 is a multiple of 360°— that is, the cycle does eventually repeat, but only after more than one full rotation of the helical object. • Non-repeating helical symmetry. This is the case in which the angle of rotation 9 required to observe the symmetry is an irrational number such as v2 radians that never repeats exactly no matter how many times the helix is rotated. Such symmetries are created by using a non-repeating point group in two dimensions. DNA is an example of this type of non-repeating helical symmetry. Scale symmetry and fractals Scale symmetry refers to the idea that if an object is expanded or reduced in size, the new object has the same properties as the original. Scale symmetry is notable for the fact that it does not exist for most physical systems, a point that was first discerned by Galileo. Simple examples of the lack of scale symmetry in the physical world include the difference in the strength and size of the legs of elephants versus mice, and the observation that if a candle made of soft wax was enlarged to the size of a tall tree, it would immediately collapse under its own weight. A more subtle form of scale symmetry is demonstrated by fractals. As conceived by Mandelbrot, fractals are a mathematical concept in which the structure of a complex form looks exactly the same no matter what degree of magnification is used to examine it. A coast is an example of a naturally occurring fractal, since it retains roughly comparable and similar-appearing complexity at every level from the view of a satellite to a microscopic examination of how the water laps up against individual grains of sand. The branching of trees, which enables children to use small twigs as stand-ins for full trees in dioramas, is another example. This similarity to naturally occurring phenomena provides fractals with an everyday familiarity not typically seen with mathematically generated functions. As a consequence, they can produce strikingly beautiful results such as the Mandelbrot set. Intriguingly, fractals have also found a place in CG, or computer-generated movie effects, where their ability to create very complex curves with fractal symmetries results in more realistic virtual worlds. Symmetry Symmetry combinations Symmetry in science Symmetry in physics Symmetry in physics has been generalized to mean invariance— that is, lack of any visible change— under any kind of transformation, for example arbitrary coordinate transformations. This concept has become one of the most powerful tools of theoretical physics, as it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. In fact, this role inspired the Nobel laureate PW Anderson to write in his widely read 1972 article More is Different that \"it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry.\" See Noether's theorem (which, in greatly simplified form, states that for every continuous mathematical symmetry, there is a corresponding conserved quantity; a conserved current, in Noether's original language); and also, Wigner's classification, which says that the symmetries of the laws of physics determine the properties of the particles found in nature. Symmetry in physical objects Classical objects Although an everyday object may appear exactly the same after a symmetry operation such as a rotation or an exchange of two identical parts has been performed on it, it is readily apparent that such a symmetry is true only as an approximation for any ordinary physical object. For example, if one rotates a precisely machined aluminum equilateral triangle 120 degrees around its center, a casual observer brought in before and after the rotation will be unable to decide whether or not such a rotation took place. However, the reality is that each corner of a triangle will always appear unique when examined with sufficient precision. An observer armed with sufficiently detailed measuring equipment such as optical or electron microscopes will not be fooled; he will immediately recognize that the object has been rotated by looking for details such as crystals or minor deformities. Such simple thought experiments show that assertions of symmetry in everyday physical objects are always a matter of approximate similarity rather than of precise mathematical sameness. The most important consequence of this approximate nature of symmetries in everyday physical objects is that such symmetries have minimal or no impacts on the physics of such objects. Consequently, only the deeper symmetries of space and time play a major role in classical physics— that is, the physics of large, everyday objects. Symmetry 1 o Quantum objects Remarkably, there exists a realm of physics for which mathematical assertions of simple symmetries in real objects cease to be approximations. That is the domain of quantum physics, which for the most part is the physics of very small, very simple objects such as electrons, protons, light, and atoms. Unlike everyday objects, objects such as electrons have very limited numbers of configurations, called states, in which they can exist. This means that when symmetry operations such as exchanging the positions of components are applied to them, the resulting new configurations often cannot be distinguished from the originals no matter how diligent an observer is. Consequently, for sufficiently small and simple objects the generic mathematical symmetry assertion F(x) = x ceases to be approximate, and instead becomes an experimentally precise and accurate description of the situation in the real world. Consequences of quantum symmetry While it makes sense that symmetries could become exact when applied to very simple objects, the immediate intuition is that such a detail should not affect the physics of such objects in any significant way. This is in part because it is very difficult to view the concept of exact similarity as physically meaningful. Our mental picture of such situations is invariably the same one we use for large objects: We picture objects or configurations that are very, very similar, but for which if we could \"look closer\" we would still be able to tell the difference. However, the assumption that exact symmetries in very small objects should not make any difference in their physics was discovered in the early 1900s to be spectacularly incorrect. The situation was succinctly summarized by Richard Feynman in the direct transcripts of his Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume III, Section 3.4, Identical particles. (Unfortunately, the quote was edited out of the printed version of the same lecture.) \"... if there is a physical situation in which it is impossible to tell which way it happened, it always interferes; it never fails.\" The word \"interferes\" in this context is a quick way of saying that such objects fall under the rules of quantum mechanics, in which they behave more like waves that interfere than like everyday large objects. In short, when an object becomes so simple that a symmetry assertion of the form F(x) = x becomes an exact statement of experimentally verifiable sameness, x ceases to follow the rules of classical physics and must instead be modeled using the more complex— and often far less intuitive— rules of quantum physics. This transition also provides an important insight into why the mathematics of symmetry are so deeply intertwined with those of quantum mechanics. When physical systems make the transition from symmetries that are approximate to ones that are exact, the mathematical expressions of those symmetries cease to be approximations and are transformed into precise definitions of the underlying nature of the objects. From that point on, the correlation of such objects to their mathematical descriptions becomes so close that it is difficult to separate the two. Symmetry 1 \\ Symmetry as a unifying principle of geometry The German geometer Felix Klein enunciated a very influential Erlangen programme in 1872, suggesting symmetry as unifying and organising principle in geometry (at a time when that was read 'geometries'). This is a broad rather than deep principle. Initially it led to interest in the groups attached to geometries, and the slogan transformation geometry (an aspect of the New Math, but hardly controversial in modern mathematical practice). By now it has been applied in numerous forms, as kind of standard attack on problems. Symmetry in mathematics An example of a mathematical expression exhibiting symmetry is a 2 c + 3ab + b 2 c. If a and b are exchanged, the expression remains unchanged due to the commutativity of addition and multiplication. Like in geometry, for the terms there are two possibilities: • It is itself symmetric • It has one or more other terms symmetric with it, in accordance with the symmetry kind See also symmetric function, duality (mathematics) Symmetry in logic A dyadic relation R is symmetric if and only if, whenever it's true that Rab, it's true that Rba. Thus, \"is the same age as\" is symmetrical, for if Paul is the same age as Mary, then Mary is the same age as Paul. Symmetric binary logical connectives are \"and\" (a, A , or &), \"or\" (v), \"biconditional\" (if and only if) (□), NAND (\"not-and\"), XOR (\"not-biconditional\"), and NOR (\"not-or\"). Generalizations of symmetry If we have a given set of objects with some structure, then it is possible for a symmetry to merely convert only one object into another, instead of acting upon all possible objects simultaneously. This requires a generalization from the concept of symmetry group to that of a groupoid. Indeed, A. Connes in his book \"Non-commutative geometry' writes that Heisenberg discovered quantum mechanics by considering the groupoid of transitions of the hydrogen spectrum. The notion of groupoid also leads to notions of multiple groupoids, namely sets with many compatible groupoid structures, a structure which trivialises to abelian groups if one restricts to groups. This leads to prospects of \"higher order symmetry' which have been a little explored, as follows. The automorphisms of a set, or a set with some structure, form a group, which models a homotopy 1-type. The automorphisms of a group G naturally form a crossed module $G \\to Aut(G)$, and crossed modules give an algebraic model of homotopy 2-types. At the next stage, automorphisms of a crossed module fit into a structure known as a crossed square, and this structure is know to give an algebraic model of homotopy 3-types. It is not known how this procedure of generalising symmetry may be continued, although crossed n-cubes have been defined and used in algebraic topology, and these structures are only slowly being brought into theoretical physics. The web site n-category cafe has much discussion of n-groups. More information is on Higher dimensional group theory' . Symmetry 12 Physicists have come up with other directions of generalization, such as supersymmetry and quantum groups, yet the different options are indistinguishable during various circumstances. Symmetry in biology See symmetry (biology) and facial symmetry. Symmetry in chemistry Symmetry is important to chemistry because it explains observations in spectroscopy, quantum chemistry and crystallography. It draws heavily on group theory. Symmetry in history, religion, and culture In any human endeavor for which an impressive visual result is part of the desired objective, symmetries play a profound role. The innate appeal of symmetry can be found in our reactions to happening across highly symmetrical natural objects, such as precisely formed crystals or beautifully spiraled seashells. Our first reaction in finding such an object often is to wonder whether we have found an object created by a fellow human, followed quickly by surprise that the symmetries that caught our attention are derived from nature itself. In both reactions we give away our inclination to view symmetries both as beautiful and, in some fashion, informative of the world around us. Symmetry in religious symbols The tendency of people to see purpose in symmetry suggests at least one reason why symmetries are often an integral part of the symbols of world religions. Just a few of many examples include the sixfold rotational symmetry of Judaism's Star of David, the twofold point symmetry of Taoism's Taijitu or Yin -Yang, the bilateral symmetry of Christianity's cross and Sikhism's Khanda, or the fourfold point symmetry of Jain's ancient (and peacefully intended) version of the swastika. With its strong prohibitions against the use of representational images, Islam, and in particular the Sunni branch of Islam, has developed intricate and visually impressive use of symmetries. G#Tf <t># Symmetry in religious symbols. Row 1. Christian, Jewish, Hindu Row 2. Islamic, Buddhist, Shinto Row 3. Sikh, Baha'i, Jain The ancient Taijitu image of Taoism is a particularly fascinating use of symmetry around a central point, combined with black-and-white inversion of color at opposite distances from that central point. The image, which is often misunderstood in the Western world as representing good (white) versus evil (black), is actually intended as a graphical representative of the complementary need for two abstract concepts of \"maleness\" (white) and \"femaleness\" (black). The symmetry of the symbol in this case is used not just to create a symbol that catches the attention of the eye, but to make a significant statement about the philosophical beliefs of the people and groups that use it. Symmetry 13 Symmetry in Social Interactions People observe the symmetrical nature, often including asymmetrical balance, of social interactions in a variety of contexts. These include assessments of reciprocity, empathy, apology, dialog, respect, justice, and revenge. Symmetrical interactions send the message \"we are all the same\" while asymmetrical interactions send the message \"I am special- better than you.\" Peer relationships are based on symmetry, power relationships are based on asymmetry. Symmetry in architecture Another human endeavor in which the visual result plays a vital part in the overall result is architecture. Both in ancient times, the ability of a large structure to impress or even intimidate its viewers has often been a major part of its purpose, and the use of symmetry is an inescapable aspect of how to accomplish such goals. Just a few examples of ancient examples of architectures that made powerful use of symmetry to impress those around them included the Egyptian Pyramids, the Greek Parthenon, the first and second Temple of Jerusalem, China's Forbidden City, Cambodia's Angkor Wat complex, and the many temples and pyramids of ancient Pre-Columbian civilizations. More recent historical examples of architectures emphasizing symmetries include Gothic architecture cathedrals, and American President Thomas Jefferson's Monticello home. India's unparalleled Taj Mahal is in a category by itself, as it may arguably be one of the most impressive and beautiful uses of symmetry in architecture that the world has ever seen. An interesting example of a broken symmetry in architecture is the Leaning Tower of Pisa, whose notoriety stems in no small part not for the intended symmetry of its design, but for the violation of that symmetry from the lean that developed while it was still under construction. Modern examples of architectures that make impressive or complex use of various symmetries include Australia's Sydney Opera House and Houston, Texas's simpler Astrodome. Symmetry finds its ways into architecture at every scale, from the overall external views, through the layout of the individual floor plans, and down to the design of individual building elements such as intricately caved doors, stained glass windows, tile mosaics, friezes, stairwells, stair rails, and balustradess. For sheer complexity and sophistication in the exploitation of symmetry as an architectural element, Islamic buildings such as the Taj Mahal often eclipse those of other cultures and ages, due in part to the general prohibition of Islam against using images of people or animals. Links related to symmetry in architecture include: • Williams: Symmetry in Architecture • Aslaksen: Mathematics in Art and Architecture [9] Symmetry 14 Symmetry in pottery and metal vessels Since the earliest uses of pottery wheels to help shape clay vessels, pottery has had a strong relationship to symmetry. As a minimum, pottery created using a wheel necessarily begins with full rotational symmetry in its cross-section, while allowing substantial freedom of shape in the vertical direction. Upon this inherently symmetrical starting point cultures from ancient times have tended to add further patterns that tend to exploit or in many cases reduce the original full rotational symmetry to a point where some specific visual objective is achieved. For example, Persian pottery dating from the fourth millennium B.C. and earlier used symmetric zigzags, squares, cross-hatchings, and repetitions of figures to produce more complex and visually striking overall designs. Persian vessel (4th millennium B.C.) Cast metal vessels lacked the inherent rotational symmetry of wheel-made pottery, but otherwise provided a similar opportunity to decorate their surfaces with patterns pleasing to those who used them. The ancient Chinese, for example, used symmetrical patterns in their bronze castings as early as the 17th century B.C. Bronze vessels exhibited both a bilateral main motif and a repetitive translated border design.

American Navajo Indians used bold diagonals and rectangular motifs. Many Oriental rugs have intricate reflected centers and borders that translate a pattern. Not surprisingly, rectangular rugs typically use quadrilateral symmetry— that is, motifs that are reflected across both the horizontal and vertical axes. Links: • Mallet: Tribal Oriental Rugs • Dilucchio: Navajo Rugs [15] Symmetry in music Symmetry is of course not restricted to the visual arts. Its role in the history of music touches many aspects of the creation and perception of music. Musical form Symmetry has been used as a formal constraint by many composers, such as the arch (swell) form (ABCBA) used by Steve Reich, Bela Bartok, and James Tenney. In classical music, Bach used the symmetry concepts of permutation and invariance; see (external link \"Fugue No. 21,\" pdf [17] or Shockwave [18] ). Pitch structures Symmetry is also an important consideration in the formation of scales and chords, traditional or tonal music being made up of non-symmetrical groups of pitches, such as the diatonic scale or the major chord. Symmetrical scales or chords, such as the whole tone scale, augmented chord, or diminished seventh chord (diminished-diminished seventh), are said to lack direction or a sense of forward motion, are ambiguous as to the key or tonal center, and have a less specific diatonic functionality. However, composers such as Alban Berg, Bela Bartok, and George Perle have used axes of symmetry and/or interval cycles in an analogous way to keys or non-tonal tonal centers. Perle (1992) explains \"C-E, D-F#, [and] Eb-G, are different instances of the same interval... the other kind of identity. ..has to do with axes of symmetry. C-E belongs to a family of symmetrically related dyads as follows:\" D D# E F F# G G# D C# C B A# A G# Thus in addition to being part of the interval-4 family, C-E is also a part of the sum-4 family (with C equal to 0). Symmetry 1 6 + 2345 6 7 8 2 1 11 10 9 8 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 Interval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven pitch segment of C5 (the cycle of fifths, which are enharmonic with the cycle of fourths) will produce the diatonic major scale. Cyclic tonal progressions in the works of Romantic composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Wagner form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the atonal music of Modernists such as Bartok, Alexander Scriabin, Edgard Varese, and the Vienna school. At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality. The first extended composition consistently based on symmetrical pitch relations was probably Alban Berg's Quartet, Op. 3 (1910). (Perle, 1990) Equivalency Tone rows or pitch class sets which are invariant under retrograde are horizontally symmetrical, under inversion vertically. See also Asymmetric rhythm. Symmetry in other arts and crafts The concept of symmetry is applied to the design of objects of all shapes and sizes. Other examples include beadwork, furniture, sand paintings, knotwork, masks, musical instruments, and many other endeavors. Symmetry in aesthetics The relationship of symmetry to aesthetics is complex. Celtic knotwork Certain simple symmetries, and in particular bilateral symmetry, seem to be deeply ingrained in the inherent perception by humans of the likely health or fitness of other living creatures, as can be seen by the simple experiment of distorting one side of the image of an attractive face and asking viewers to rate the attractiveness of the resulting image. Consequently, such symmetries that mimic biology tend to have an innate appeal that in turn drives a powerful tendency to create artifacts with similar symmetry. One only needs to imagine the difficulty in trying to market a highly asymmetrical car or truck to general automotive buyers to understand the power of biologically inspired symmetries such as bilateral symmetry. Another more subtle appeal of symmetry is that of simplicity, which in turn has an implication of safety, security, and familiarity. A highly symmetrical room, for example, is unavoidably also a room in which anything out of place or potentially threatening can be identified easily and quickly. For example, people who have grown up in houses full of exact right angles and precisely identical artifacts can find their first experience in staying in a room with no exact right angles and no exactly identical artifacts to be highly disquieting. Symmetry thus can be a source of comfort not only as an indicator of biological health, but also of a safe and well-understood living environment. Opposed to this is the tendency for excessive symmetry to be perceived as boring or uninteresting. Humans in particular have a powerful desire to exploit new opportunities or explore new possibilities, and an excessive degree of symmetry can convey a lack of such Symmetry 1 7 opportunities. Yet another possibility is that when symmetries become too complex or too challenging, the human mind has a tendency to \"tune them out\" and perceive them in yet another fashion: as noise that conveys no useful information. Finally, perceptions and appreciation of symmetries are also dependent on cultural background. The far greater use of complex geometric symmetries in many Islamic cultures, for example, makes it more likely that people from such cultures will appreciate such art forms (or, conversely, to rebel against them). As in many human endeavors, the result of the confluence of many such factors is that effective use of symmetry in art and architecture is complex, intuitive, and highly dependent on the skills of the individuals who must weave and combine such factors within their own creative work. Along with texture, color, proportion, and other factors, symmetry is a powerful ingredient in any such synthesis; one only need to examine the Taj Mahal to powerful role that symmetry plays in determining the aesthetic appeal of an object. Modernist architecture rejects symmetry, stating only a bad architect relies on symmetry, instead of symmetrical layout of blocks, masses and structures, Modernist architecture relies on wings and balance of masses. This notion of getting rid of symmetry was first encountered in International style. Some people find asymmetrical layouts of buildings and structures revolutionizing; other find them restless, boring and unnatural. A few examples of the more explicit use of symmetries in art can be found in the remarkable art of M. C. Escher, the creative design of the mathematical concept of a wallpaper group, and the many applications (both mathematical and real world) of tiling.

The role of symmetry in physics is important, for example, in simplifying solutions to many problems. Spacetime symmetries are used to simplify problems and find ample application in the study of exact solutions of Einstein's field equations of general relativity. Physical motivation Quite often, physical problems may be investigated and solved by noticing features of the problem which have some form of symmetry. For example, in the Schwarzschild solution, the role of spherical symmetry is important in deriving the Schwarzschild solution and deducing the physical consequences of this symmetry (for example, the non-existence of gravitational radiation in a spherically pulsating star). In cosmological problems, symmetry finds a role to play in the cosmological principle which restricts the type of universes that are consistent with large-scale observations (e.g. the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric). Symmetries usually require some form of preserving property, the most important of which in general relativity include the following: • preserving geodesies of the spacetime • preserving the metric tensor • preserving the curvature tensor These and other symmetries will be discussed in more detail later. This preservation feature can be used to motivate a useful definition of symmetries. Mathematical definition A rigorous definition of symmetries in general relativity has been given by Hall (2004). In this approach, the idea is to use (smooth) vector fields whose local flow diffeomorphisms preserve some property of the spacetime. This preserving property of the diffeomorphisms is made precise as follows. A smooth vector field A' on a spacetime M is said to preserve a smooth tensor Ton M{or Tis invariant under X) if, for each smooth local flow diffeomorphism ^associated with X , the tensors Tand <£t*COare equal on the domain of <Pt . This statement is equivalent to the more usable condition that the Lie derivative of the tensor under the vector field vanishes: Spacetime symmetries 21 on M . This has the consequence that, given any two points V and 9 on M , the coordinates of Tin a coordinate system around Pare equal to the coordinates of Tin a coordinate system around 9 . A symmetry on the spacetime is a smooth vector field whose local flow diffeomorphisms preserve some (usually geometrical) feature of the spacetime. The (geometrical) feature may refer to specific tensors (such as the metric, or the energy-momentum tensor) or to other aspects of the spacetime such as it's geodesic structure. The vector fields are sometimes referred to as collineations, symmetry vector fields or just symmetries. The set of all symmetry vector fields on M forms a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation as can be seen from the identity: C [x .y]T = C X (C Y T) - C Y {C X T) the term on the right usually being written, with an abuse of notation, as \\£-x-> £y]T . Various examples of symmetries are briefly described below. Killing symmetry Killing vector fields are one of the most important types of symmetries and are defined to be those smooth vector fields that preserve the metric tensor: £x9ab = This is usually written in the expanded form as: X a: {, + Ai ;a = Killing vector fields find extensive applications (including in classical mechanics) and are related to conservation laws. Homothetic symmetry A homothetic vector field is one which satisfies: £-x9ah = %CQab where c is a real constant. Homothetic vector fields find application in the study of singularities in general relativity. Affine symmetry An affine vector field is one that satisfies: {^X9ab),c = An affine vector field preserves geodesies and preserves the affine parameter. The above three vector field types are special cases of projective vector fields which preserve geodesies without necessarily preserving the affine parameter. Spacetime symmetries 22 Conformal symmetry A conformal vector field is one which satisfies: £x9ab = <f>9ab where 6 is a smooth real-valued function on M . Curvature symmetry A curvature collineation is a vector field which preserves the Riemann tensor: where R a bed are the components of the Riemann tensor. The set of all smooth curvature collineations forms a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation (if the smoothness condition is dropped, the set of all curvature collineations need not form a Lie algebra). The Lie algebra is denoted by CC(M) and may be infinite-dimensional. Every affine vector field is a curvature collineation. Matter symmetry A less well-known form of symmetry concerns vector fields that preserve the energy-momentum tensor. These are variously referred to as matter collineations or matter symmetries and are defined by: C x T ab = where T a f,are the energy-momentum tensor components. The intimate relation between geometry and physics may be highlighted here, as the vector field A is regarded as preserving certain physical quantities along the flow lines of X , this being true for any two observers. In connection with this, it may be shown that every Killing vector field is a matter collineation (by the Einstein field equations, with or without cosmological constant). Thus, given a solution of the EFE, a vector field that preserves the metric necessarily preserves the corresponding energy-momentum tensor. When the energy-momentum tensor represents a perfect fluid, every Killing vector field preserves the energy density, pressure and the fluid flow vector field. When the energy-momentum tensor represents an electromagnetic field, a Killing vector field does not necessarily preserve the electric and magnetic fields. Applications of symmetry vector fields As mentioned at the start of this article, the main application of these symmetries occur in general relativity, where solutions of Einstein's equations may be classified by imposing some certain symmetries on the spacetime. Classifications of spacetimes Classifying solutions of the EFE constitutes a large part of general relativity research. Various approaches to classifying spacetimes, including using the Segre classification of the energy-momentum tensor or the Petrov classification of the Weyl tensor have been studied extensively by many researchers, most notably Stephani et al. (2003). They also classify spacetimes using symmetry vector fields (especially Killing and homothetic symmetries). For example, Killing vector fields may be used to classify spacetimes, as there is a limit to the number of global, smooth Killing vector fields that a spacetime may possess (the maximum being 10 for 4-dimensional spacetimes). Generally speaking, the higher the Spacetime symmetries 23 dimension of the algebra of symmetry vector fields on a spacetime, the more symmetry the spacetime admits. For example, the Schwarzschild solution has a Killing algebra of dimension 4 (3 spatial rotational vector fields and a time translation), whereas the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric (excluding the Einstein static subcase) has a Killing algebra of dimension 6 (3 translations and 3 rotations). The Einstein static metric has a Killing algebra of dimension 7 (the previous 6 plus a time translation). The assumption of a spacetime admitting a certain symmetry vector field can place severe restrictions on the spacetime.

REDIRECT Symmetry in biology Symmetric relation In mathematics, a binary relation R over a set X is symmetric if it holds for all a and b in X that if a is related to b then b is related to a. In mathematical notation, this is: Va, b e X, aRb => bRa. Note: symmetry is not the exact opposite of antisymmetry (aRb and bRa implies b = a). There are relations which are both symmetric and antisymmetric (equality and its subrelations, including, vacuously, the empty relation), there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric ('preys on' in biological sciences), there are relations which are symmetric and not antisymmetric (congruence modulo n), and there are relations which are not symmetric but are antisymmetric (\"is less than or equal to\"). Properties containing the symmetric relation equivalence relation - A symmetric relation that is also transitive and reflexive. Graph-theoretic interpretation In an undirected graph, the relation over the set of vertices of the graph under which v and w are related if and only if they are adjacent forms a symmetric relation.

It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. The commutativity of simple operations, such as multiplication and addition of numbers, was for many years implicitly assumed and the property was not named until the 19th century when mathematicians began to formalize the theory of mathematics. ,1^ ,'k'-, f ,^ Example showing the commutativity of addition (3 + 2 = 2 + 3) Common uses The commutative property (or commutative law) is a property associated with binary operations and functions. Similarly, if the commutative property holds for a pair of elements under a certain binary operation then it is said that the two elements commute under that operation. In group and set theory, many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property. In higher branches of math, such as analysis and linear algebra the commutativity of well known operations (such as addition and multiplication on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs. [1] [2] [3] Mathematical definitions The term \"commutative\" is used in several related senses. 1. A binary operation Qona set S is said to be commutative if: Vsc, y £ S : x *y = y * x - An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called noncommutative. 2. One says that x commutes with y under □ if: x * y = y * x 3. A binary function i:AxA -> B is said to be commutative if: Vx 3 y£A:f{x t y)=f{y 1 x) Commutativity 27 History and etymology f ct f , sonC telles qu'elles doiment el que soit IWdre dans lequel on les. ppeleas commutatives entre elles> The first known use of the term was in a French Journal published in 1814 Records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times. The Egyptians used the commutative property of multiplication to simplify computing products. Euclid is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book Elements. Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th century when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions. Today the commutative property is a well known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics. Simple versions of the commutative property are usually taught in beginning mathematics courses. The first use of the actual term commutative was in a memoir by Frangois Servois in 1814, ] [ ] which used the word commutatives when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property. The word is a combination of the French word commuter meaning \"to substitute or switch\" and the suffix -ative meaning \"tending to\" so the word literally means \"tending to substitute or switch.\" The term then appeared in English in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1844. [ll] Related properties Associativity The associative property is closely related to the commutative property. The associative property states that the order in which operations are performed does not affect the final result as long as the order of terms is not changed. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result. Symmetry Graph showing the symmetry of the addition function Symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity. When a commutative operator is written as a binary function then the resulting function is symmetric across the line y = x. As an example, if we let a function f represent addition (a commutative operation) so that f(x,y) = x + y then f is a symmetric function which can be seen in the image on the right. Commutativity 28 Examples Commutative operations in everyday life • Putting your shoes on resembles a commutative operation since it doesn't matter if you put the left or right shoe on first, the end result (having both shoes on), is the same. • When making change we take advantage of the commutativity of addition. It doesn't matter what order we put the change in, it always adds to the same total. .[4] Commutative operations in math Two well-known examples of commutative binary operations are: 1 • The addition of real numbers, which is commutative since y + z = z + y Vy, 2 £ E For example 4 + 5 = 5 + 4, since both expressions equal 9. • The multiplication of real numbers, which is commutative since yz = zy Vy, z £ R For example, 3x5 = 5x3, since both expressions equal 15. • Further examples of commutative binary operations include addition and multiplication of complex numbers, addition of vectors, and intersection and union of sets. Noncommutative operations in everyday life • Washing and drying your clothes resembles a noncommutative operation, if you dry first and then wash, you get a significantly different result than if you wash first and then dry. • The Rubik's Cube is noncommutative. For example, twisting the front face clockwise, the top face clockwise and the front face counterclockwise (FUF 1 ) does not yield the same result as twisting the front face clockwise, then counterclockwise and finally twisting the top clockwise (FF'U). The twists do not commute. This is studied in group theory. EA+^+TTEA ()*() E/TTEA Concatenation, the act of joining character strings together, is a noncommutative operation.

Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers. They are named after Niels Henrik Abel. The concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, with many other basic objects, such as a module and a vector space, being its refinements. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research. Definition An abelian group is a set, A, together with an operation \" • \" that combines any two elements a and b to form another element denoted a • b. The symbol \"•\" is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, (A, •), must satisfy five requirements known as the abelian group axioms: Closure For all a, b in A, the result of the operation a • b is also in A. Associativity For all a, b and c in A, the equation (a • b) • c = a • (b • c) holds. Identity element There exists an element e in A, such that for all elements a in A, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. Inverse element For each a in A, there exists an element b in A such that a*b = b*a = e, where e is the identity element. Commutativity For all a, b in A, a • b = b • a. More compactly, an abelian group is a commutative group. A group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a \"non-abelian group\" or \"non-commutative group\". Facts Notation There are two main notational conventions for abelian groups — additive and multiplicative. Convention Operation Identity Powers Inverse Addition x + y nx —x Multiplication x * y or xy e or 1 x n x\" 1 Generally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for modules. The additive notation may also be used to Abelian group 32 emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered. Multiplication table To verify that a finite group is abelian, a table (matrix) - known as a Cayley table - can be constructed in a similar fashion to a multiplication table. If the group is G = {g 1 = e, g 2 , ..., g } under the operation □, the (z, j)'th entry of this table contains the product g. □ g.. The group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal (i.e. if the matrix is a symmetric matrix). This is true since if the group is abelian, then g. \\} g. = g. □ g.. This implies that the (z, j)'th entry of the table equals the (J, z')'th entry - i.e. the table is symmetric about the main diagonal. Examples • For the integers and the operation addition \" + \", denoted (Z, + ), the operation + combines any two integers to form a third integer, addition is associative, zero is the additive identity, every integer n has an additive inverse, —n, and the addition operation is commutative since m + n = n + m for any two integers m and n. • Every cyclic group G is abelian, because if x, y are in G, then xy = a m a n = a m + n = a n + m = a n a m = yx. Thus the integers, Z, form an abelian group under addition, as do the integers modulo n, Z/nZ. • Every ring is an abelian group with respect to its addition operation. In a commutative ring the invertible elements, or units, form an abelian multiplicative group. In particular, the real numbers are an abelian group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an abelian group under multiplication. • Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal, so each subgroup gives rise to a quotient group. Subgroups, quotients, and direct sums of abelian groups are again abelian. In general, matrices, even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication - one example is the group of 2x2 rotation matrices. Historical remarks Abelian groups were named for Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel by Camille Jordan who was first to observe their importance in connection with the problem of solvability by radicals, first posed by Abel. Properties If n is a natural number and x is an element of an abelian group G written additively, then nx can be defined as x + x + ... + x(n summands) and (-n)x = -(nx). In this way, G becomes a module over the ring Z of integers. In fact, the modules over Z can be identified with the abelian groups. Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. modules over the principal ideal domain Z) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A Abelian group 33 typical example is the classification of finitely generated abelian groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form Z/p Z for p prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of Z. If /, g : G -> H are two group homomorphisms between abelian groups, then their sum f + g, defined by (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if H is a non-abelian group.) The set Hom(G, H) of all group homomorphisms from G to H thus turns into an abelian group in its own right. Somewhat akin to the dimension of vector spaces, every abelian group has a rank. It is defined as the cardinality of the largest set of linearly independent elements of the group. The integers and the rational numbers have rank one, as well as every subgroup of the rationals. Finite abelian groups Cyclic groups of integers modulo n, Z/nZ, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The automorphism group of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of Georg Frobenius and Ludwig Stickelberger and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of linear algebra. Classification The fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group G can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of prime-power order. This is a special case of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups when G has zero rank. The cyclic group Z mn of order mn is isomorphic to the direct sum of Z m and Z„if and only if m and n are coprime. It follows that any finite abelian group G is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form z fa e---©z Jb- in either of the following canonical ways: • the numbers k ,...,k are powers of primes • k divides k , which divides k , and so on up to k . For example, Z/15Z = Ziscan be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: Z15 = {0,5, 10} © {0, 3,6, 9, 12} . The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are isomorphic. For another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either Sg (the integers to 7 under addition modulo 8), Z4©Z2(the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or Z2 © Z2 © Z2. See also list of small groups for finite abelian groups of order 16 or less. Abelian group 34 Automorphisms One can apply the fundamental theorem to count (and sometimes determine) the automorphisms of a given finite abelian group G. To do this, one uses the fact (which will not be proved here) that if G splits as a direct sum H © K of subgroups of coprime order, thenAut(H 9 K) = Aut(H) ©Aut(iC). Given this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of G it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the Sylow p-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of p). Fix a prime p and suppose the exponents e. of the cyclic factors of the Sylow p-subgroup are arranged in increasing order: ei < e 2 < ■ ■ ■ < e n for some n > 0. One needs to find the automorphisms of One special case is when n = 1, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow p-subgroup P. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite cyclic group can be used. Another special case is when n is arbitrary but e. = 1 for 1 < z < n. Here, one is considering P to be of the form Zp©---©Zp, so elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension n over the finite field of p elements ™p . The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so Aut(P) =GL(ji,F p ), where GL is the appropriate general linear group. This is easily shown to have order \\Aut(P)\\ = (p\"-l)...(p n -p- 1 ). In the most general case, where the e. and n are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines <4 = max{r|e r = e k } and c k =min{r|e,. = e k } then one has in particular d > k, c, < k, and -l\\n— c;+L One can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see [Hillar,Rhea]). Abelian group 35 Infinite abelian groups The theory of infinite abelian groups is far from complete. Two important special classes with diametrically opposite properties are torsion groups and torsion-free groups. Torsion groups An abelian group is called periodic or torsion if every element has finite order. Important areas of the theory of torsion groups are: • Direct sums of cyclic groups, also called pure projective modules • Bounded groups, an example of pure injective modules • Ulm invariants Torsion-free groups An abelian group is called torsion-free if every non-zero element has infinite order. Important areas of torsion-free groups are: • Rank of an abelian group • Basic subgroups • Cotorsion and algebraically compact torsion-free groups such as the p-adic integers • Slender groups Mixed groups An abelian group is called mixed if it is neither torsion nor torsion-free. Important topics in the theory of mixed groups are: • Ext functor • Pure subgroups • Divisible groups In each case, the new ideas help to approximate a mixed group as a direct sum of a torsion and a torsion-free group. Additive groups of rings The additive group of a ring is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings. Some important topics in this area of study are: • Tensor product • Corner's results on countable torsion-free groups • Shelah's work to remove cardinality restrictions Abelian group 36 Relation to other mathematical topics Many large abelian groups possess a natural topology, which turns them into topological groups. The collection of all abelian groups, together with the homomorphisms between them, forms the category Ab, the prototype of an abelian category. Nearly all well-known algebraic structures other than Boolean algebra, are undecidable. Hence it is surprising that Tarski's student Szmielew (1955) proved that the first order theory of abelian groups, unlike its nonabelian counterpart, is decidable. This decidability, plus the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups described above, highlight some of the successes in abelian group theory, but there are still many areas of current research: • Amongst torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank, only the finitely generated case and the rank 1 case are well understood; • There are many unsolved problems in the theory of infinite-rank torsion-free abelian groups; • While countable torsion abelian groups are well understood through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, the cased of countable mixed groups is much less mature. • Many mild extensions of the first order theory of abelian groups are known to be undecidable. • Finite abelian groups remain a topic of research in computational group theory. Moreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the set theory commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the Whitehead problem: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also free abelian groups? In the 1970s, Saharon Shelah proved that the Whitehead problem is: • Undecidable in ZFC, the conventional axiomatic set theory from which nearly all of present day mathematics can be derived. The Whitehead problem is also the first question in ordinary mathematics proved undecidable in ZFC; • Undecidable even if ZFC is augmented by taking the generalized continuum hypothesis as an axiom; • Decidable if ZFC is augmented with the axiom of constructibility (see statements true in L). A note on the typography Among mathematical adjectives derived from the proper name of a mathematician, the word \"abelian\" is rare in that it is spelled with a lowercase a, rather than an uppercase A, indicating how ubiquitous the concept is in modern mathematics.

Nonabelian group In mathematics, a nonabelian group, also sometimes called a non-commutative group, is a group (G, * ) such that there are at least two elements a and b of G such that a * b * b * a. The term non-abelian is used to distinguish from the idea of an abelian group, where all of the elements of the group commute. Nonabelian groups are pervasive in mathematics and physics. One of the simplest examples of a non-abelian group is the dihedral group of order 6. A common example from physics is the rotation group in three dimensions. Both discrete groups and continuous groups may be non-abelian; most of the interesting Lie groups are nonabelian. The term nonabelian is used primarily by physicists, rather than mathematicians, and is frequently taken to be a synonym for the collection of Lie groups. This usage is particularly common in gauge theory. See also • Associative algebra • Non-commutative geometry Symmetry group 38 Symmetry group The symmetry group of an object (image, signal, etc.) is the group of all isometries under which it is invariant with composition as the operation. It is a subgroup of the isometry group of the space concerned. If not stated otherwise, this article considers symmetry groups in Euclidean geometry, but the concept may also be studied in wider contexts; see below. Introduction The \"objects\" may be geometric figures, images and patterns, such as a wallpaper pattern. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern, e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. For symmetry of physical objects, one may also want to take physical composition into account. The group of isometries of space induces a group action on objects in it. A tetrahedron can be placed in 12 distinct positions by rotation alone. These are illustrated above in the cycle graph format, along with the 180° edge (blue arrows) and 120° vertex (reddish arrows) rotations that permute the tetrahedron through the positions. The 12 rotations form the rotation (symmetry) group of the figure. The symmetry group is sometimes also called full symmetry group in order to emphasize that it includes the orientation-reversing isometries (like reflections, glide reflections and improper rotations) under which the figure is invariant. The subgroup of orientation-preserving isometries (i.e. translations, rotations, and compositions of these) which leave the figure invariant is called its proper symmetry group. The proper symmetry group of an object is equal to its full symmetry group if and only if the object is chiral (and thus there are no orientation-reversing isometries under which it is invariant). Any symmetry group whose elements have a common fixed point, which is true for all finite symmetry groups and also for the symmetry groups of bounded figures, can be represented as a subgroup of orthogonal group O(n) by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(n) then, and therefore also called rotation group of the figure. Discrete symmetry groups come in three types: (1) finite point groups, which include only rotations, reflections, inversion and rotoinversion - they are in fact just the finite subgroups of O(n), (2) infinite lattice groups, which include only translations, and (3) infinite space groups which combines elements of both previous types, and may also include extra Symmetry group 39 transformations like screw axis and glide reflection. There are also continuous symmetry groups, which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances. The group of all symmetries of a sphere 0(3) is an example of this, and in general such continuous symmetry groups are studied as Lie groups. With a categorization of subgroups of the Euclidean group corresponds a categorization of symmetry groups. Two geometric figures are considered to be of the same symmetry type if their symmetry groups are conjugate subgroups of the Euclidean group E{n) (the isometry group of R n ), where two subgroups H , H of a group G are conjugate, if there exists g □ G such that -l H =g H g. For example: • two 3D figures have mirror symmetry, but with respect to different mirror planes. • two 3D figures have 3-fold rotational symmetry, but with respect to different axes. • two 2D patterns have translational symmetry, each in one direction; the two translation vectors have the same length but a different direction. When considering isometry groups, one may restrict oneself to those where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed. This excludes for example in ID the group of translations by a rational number. A \"figure\" with this symmetry group is non-drawable and up to arbitrarily fine detail homogeneous, without being really homogeneous. One dimension The isometry groups in ID where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed are: • the trivial group C. • the groups of two elements generated by a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with • the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation; they are isomorphic with Z • the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation and a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with the generalized dihedral group of Z, Dih(Z), also denoted by D (which is a semidirect product of Z and C ). • the group generated by all translations (isomorphic with R); this group cannot be the symmetry group of a \"pattern\": it would be homogeneous, hence could also be reflected. However, a uniform ID vector field has this symmetry group. • the group generated by all translations and reflections in points; they are isomorphic with the generalized dihedral group of R, Dih(R). See also symmetry groups in one dimension. Two dimensions Up to conjugacy the discrete point groups in 2 dimensional space are the following classes: • cyclic groups C., C , C , C .,... where C consists of all rotations about a fixed point by multiples of the angle 360°/n • dihedral groups D., D„, D„, D A ,... where D (of order 2n) consists of the rotations in C a ^ 1 2 3 4 n n together with reflections in n axes that pass through the fixed point. C 1 is the trivial group containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure has no symmetry at all, for example the letter F. C is the symmetry group of the letter Z, C 3 that of a triskelion, C 4 of a swastika, and C 5 , C Q etc. are the symmetry groups of similar Symmetry group 40 swastika-like figures with five, six etc. arms instead of four. D is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of bilateral symmetry, for example the letter A. D , which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle, and D , D etc. are the symmetry groups of the regular polygons. The actual symmetry groups in each of these cases have two degrees of freedom for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors. The remaining isometry groups in 2D with a fixed point, where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed are: • the special orthogonal group SO(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point; it is also called the circle group S , the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value 1 . It is the proper symmetry group of a circle and the continuous equivalent of C . There is no figure which has as full symmetry group the circle group, but for a vector field it may apply (see the 3D case below). • the orthogonal group 0(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point and reflections in any axis through that fixed point. This is the symmetry group of a circle. It is also called l l Dih(S ) as it is the generalized dihedral group of S . For non-bounded figures, the additional isometry groups can include translations; the closed ones are: • the 7 frieze groups • the 1 7 wallpaper groups • for each of the symmetry groups in ID, the combination of all symmetries in that group in one direction, and the group of all translations in the perpendicular direction • ditto with also reflections in a line in the first direction Three dimensions Up to conjugacy the set of 3D point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 separate ones. In crystallography they are restricted to be compatible with the discrete translation symmetries of a crystal lattice. This crystallographic restriction of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups (27 from the 7 infinite series, and 5 of the 7 others). See point groups in three dimensions. The continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of: • cylindrical symmetry without a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis, this applies for example often for a bottle • cylindrical symmetry with a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis • spherical symmetry For objects and scalar fields the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical planes of reflection. However, for vector fields it does not: in cylindrical coordinates with respect to some axis, A = A p p + A$<f> + A £ z has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis if and only if ^pi^iand ^have this symmetry, i.e., they do not depend on cp. Additionally there is reflectional symmetry if and only if ^o = 0. For spherical symmetry there is no such distinction, it implies planes of reflection. Symmetry group 41 The continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a screw axis, such as an infinite helix. See also subgroups of the Euclidean group. Symmetry groups in general In wider contexts, a symmetry group may be any kind of transformation group, or automorphism group. Once we know what kind of mathematical structure we are concerned with, we should be able to pinpoint what mappings preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry can define the structure, or at least clarify what we mean by an invariant, geometric language in which to discuss it; this is one way of looking at the Erlangen programme. For example, automorphism groups of certain models of finite geometries are not \"symmetry groups\" in the usual sense, although they preserve symmetry. They do this by preserving families of point-sets rather than point-sets (or \"objects\") themselves. Like above, the group of automorphisms of space induces a group action on objects in it. For a given geometric figure in a given geometric space, consider the following equivalence relation: two automorphisms of space are equivalent if and only if the two images of the figure are the same (here \"the same\" does not mean something like e.g. \"the same up to translation and rotation\", but it means \"exactly the same\"). Then the equivalence class of the identity is the symmetry group of the figure, and every equivalence class corresponds to one isomorphic version of the figure. There is a bijection between every pair of equivalence classes: the inverse of a representative of the first equivalence class, composed with a representative of the second. In the case of a finite automorphism group of the whole space, its order is the order of the symmetry group of the figure multiplied by the number of isomorphic versions of the figure. Examples: • Isometries of the Euclidean plane, the figure is a rectangle: there are infinitely many equivalence classes; each contains 4 isometries. • The space is a cube with Euclidean metric; the figures include cubes of the same size as the space, with colors or patterns on the faces; the automorphisms of the space are the 48 isometries; the figure is a cube of which one face has a different color; the figure has a symmetry group of 8 isometries, there are 6 equivalence classes of 8 isometries, for 6 isomorphic versions of the figure. Compare Lagrange's theorem (group theory) and its proof.

For isometry in differential geometry, see isometry (Riemannian geometry) . In mathematics, an isometry, isometric isomorphism or congruence mapping is a distance-preserving isomorphism between metric spaces. Geometric figures which can be related by an isometry are called congruent. Isometries are often used in constructions where one space is embedded in another space. For instance, the completion of a metric space M involves an isometry from M into M', a quotient set of the space of Cauchy sequences on M. The original space M is thus isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of a complete metric space, and it is usually identified with this subspace. Other embedding constructions show that every metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subset of some normed vector space and that every complete metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subset of some Banach space. Definitions The notion of isometry comes in two main flavors: global isometry and a weaker notion path isometry or arcwise isometry. Both are often called just isometry and one should determine from context which one is intended. Let X and Y be metric spaces with metrics d and d . A map f : X -> Y is called distance preserving if for any a,b □ X one has d Y (f(a)J(b)) = d x (a,b). A distance preserving map is automatically injective. Clearly, every isometry between metric spaces is necessarily a topological embedding. Isometry 43 A global isometry is a bijective distance preserving map. A path isometry or arcwise isometry is a map which preserves the lengths of curves (not necessarily bijective). Two metric spaces X and Y are called isometric if there is an isometry from X to Y. The set of isometries from a metric space to itself forms a group with respect to function composition, called the isometry group. Examples • Any reflection, translation and rotation is a global isometry on Euclidean spaces. See also Euclidean group. • The map R ^R defined by £ 1— > \\z\\ is a path isometry but not a global isometry. • The isometric linear maps from C n to itself are the unitary matrices. Linear isometries Given two normed vector spaces V and W, a linear isometry is a linear map f : V -> W that preserves the norms: for all v in V. Linear isometries are distance-preserving maps in the above sense. They are global isometries if and only if they are surjective. By the Mazur-Ulam theorem, any isometry of normed vector spaces over R is affine. Generalizations • Given a positive real number e, an £-isometry or almost isometry (also called a Hausdorff approximation) is a map / : X — i ^between metric spaces such that 1. for x,xD UX one has |d y (f(x),J(xD))-d x (x,xD)| < e, and 2. for any point y □ Y there exists a point x\\]X with d y (yj(x)) < s That is, an e-isometry preserves distances to within e and leaves no element of the codomain further than s away from the image of an element of the domain. Note that e-isometries are not assumed to be continuous. • Quasi-isometry is yet another useful generalization. Beckman-Quarles theorem The Beckman-Quarles theorem states that for a Euclidean space E of dimension d at least 2, any mapping f from E to itself that preserves the property of being at a unit distance apart must be an isometry.

Space group The space group of a crystal or crystallographic group is a mathematical description of the symmetry inherent in the structure. The word 'group' in the name comes from the mathematical notion of a group, which is used to build the set of space groups. Crystallography The space groups in three dimensions are made from combinations of the 32 crystallographic point groups with the 14 Bravais lattices which belong to one of 7 crystal systems. This results in a space group being some combination of the translational symmetry of a unit cell including lattice centering, and the point group symmetry operations of reflection, rotation and improper rotation (also called rotoinversion). Furthermore one must consider the screw axis and glide plane symmetry operations. These are called compound symmetry operations and are combinations of a rotation or reflection with a translation less than the unit cell size. The combination of all these symmetry operations results in a total of 230 unique space groups describing all possible crystal symmetries. Glide planes and screw axes Two of the symmetry operations involved in the space groups are not contained in the corresponding point group or Bravais lattice. These are the compound symmetry operations called the glide plane and the screw axis. A glide plane is a reflection in a plane, followed by a translation parallel with that plane. This is noted by a, b or c, depending on which axis the glide is along. There is also the n glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the d glide, which is a fourth of the way along either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The latter is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure. A screw axis is a rotation about an axis, followed by a translation along the direction of the axis. These are noted by a number, n, to describe the degree of rotation, where the number is how many operations must be applied to complete a full rotation (e.g., 3 would mean a rotation one third of the way around the axis each time). The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector. So, 2. is a twofold rotation followed by a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector. Space group 45 Notation There are a number of methods of identifying space groups. The International Union of Crystallography publishes a table (more correctly, a hefty tome of tables) of all space groups, and assigns each a unique number. Oth"
