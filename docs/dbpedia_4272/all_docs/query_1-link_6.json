AIFI - Artificial Intelligence Finance Institute\n\nRobert Phelan Langlands, ( 1936 ) is a Canadian mathematician. He is best known as the founder of the Langlands program, a vast web of conjectures and results connecting representation theory and automorphic forms to the study of Galois groups in number theory,for which he received the 2018 Abel Prize. He also got the Wolf Prize in 1995. He was an emeritus professor and occupied Albert Einstein's office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, until 2020 when he retired. Here are some key aspects of his scientific contributions: 1. Langlands Program: Langlands' most significant contribution is the formulation of the Langlands program. This set of conjectures and ideas, first proposed in a letter to André Weil in 1967, seeks to create a grand unifying theory linking areas of number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. The program suggests deep connections between Galois groups (which arise in the study of polynomial equations and their roots) and automorphic forms (complex-valued functions with certain invariance properties). 2. Reciprocity Conjectures: A cornerstone of the Langlands program is the series of reciprocity conjectures. These conjectures generalize class field theory (which describes abelian extensions of number fields) to non-abelian Galois groups, proposing a correspondence between Galois representations and automorphic representations. This was a revolutionary idea that opened up new ways of thinking about and studying these mathematical objects. 3. Functoriality and Endoscopy: Langlands introduced the concept of functoriality within his program, which deals with how automorphic representations of one group relate to those of another group. He also developed the theory of endoscopy, a set of techniques to understand the internal structure of automorphic representations, particularly in cases where functorial transfer is not straightforward. 4. Trace Formula: Langlands made significant contributions to the development of the trace formula, a powerful tool in the study of automorphic forms. The trace formula is an analytic tool that allows mathematicians to count automorphic representations with certain properties. 5. Influence on Other Fields: The Langlands program has influenced various other areas of mathematics. It has played a role in the proof of major theorems, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles, and has been instrumental in the development of the theory of Shimura varieties in algebraic geometry. 6. Collaborations and Mentoring: Beyond his own research, Langlands has been influential through collaborations and mentoring other mathematicians, contributing to the growth and development of the field. His contributions have not only opened new avenues of research but have also provided a framework that connects various seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. https://lnkd.in/d7BYmRP4 AIFI - Artificial Intelligence Finance Institute\n\nPierre René, Viscount Deligne ( 1944 ) is a Belgian mathematician.

Pythagorean triples (x,y,z) of integers satisfy x^2 + y^2 = z^2. To avoid trivialities, one stipulates none of x,y,z is zero. This is what we term as Fermat's theorem for n = 2. The n = 3 generalization asks the question: can we find three integers x,y and z satisfying x^3 + y^3 = z^3. It is taught in a university level number theory class that this n = 3 case would work only when one of x, y or z is zero. The most general version for an arbitrary positive integer n is precisely the theorem known as FLT (Fermat's last theorem) (Fact: no nontrivial solutions exist, we do need one of x,y or z to be zero). In his death bed, Fermat made a note in his diary stating this theorem and claiming \"I do have a proof of this but this margin is too narrow to jot it down\". Mathematicians spent centuries trying to prove until Wiles did so about four decades ago. People believe Fermat did not really have a proof (or if he had one, it would have been incorrect). So much higher math and new math disciplines had to be developed just to prove this theorem. When Wiles announced his proof, we (as PhD students) had to learn the idea of proof. It was too hard and too long - even the outline of proof (top level steps) requires three hours of lecturing. I did lecture on this outline in many universities across the globe (first one being at University of Malaysia), mostly for undergraduate students with sufficient exposure to Mathematics. Pleased to share this post of Dr Miquel Noguer i Alonso; hope the young students and even senior scholars from all other disciplines give this a quick read. It is informative - rich history of math spanning three centuries is hidden. Manish K. Gupta Michael (Mike) Erlihson, PhD Nella Ludlow Arun Pati Yaashaa P.
