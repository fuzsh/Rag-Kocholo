        "text": "Chaos seems to rule our world. Weather events, natural disasters, economic volatility, empire building—all these contribute to the complexities that buffet our lives. It is no wonder that ancient man attributed the chaos to the gods or to the fates, infinitely far from anything we can comprehend as cause and effect. Yet there is a balm to soothe our wounds from the slings of life—Chaos Theory—if not to solve our problems, then at least to understand them.\n\n(Sections of this Blog have been excerpted\n\nfrom the book Galileo Unbound, published by Oxford University Press)\n\nChaos Theory is the theory of complex systems governed by multiple factors that produce complicated outputs. The power of the theory is its ability recognize when the complicated outputs are not “random”, no matter how complicated they are, but are in fact determined by the inputs. Furthermore, chaos theory finds structures and patterns within the output—like the fractal structures known as “strange attractors”. These patterns not only are not random, but they tell us about the internal mechanics of the system, and they tell us where to look “on average” for the system behavior.\n\nIn other words, chaos theory tames the chaos, and we no longer need to blame gods or the fates.\n\nHenri Poincare (1889)\n\nThe first glimpse of the inner workings of chaos was made by accident when Henri Poincaré responded to a mathematics competition held in honor of the King of Sweden. The challenge was to prove whether the solar system was absolutely stable, or whether there was a danger that one day the Earth would be flung from its orbit. Poincaré had already been thinking about the stability of dynamical systems so he wrote up his solution to the challenge and sent it in, believing that he had indeed proven that the solar system was stable.\n\nHis entry to the competition was the most convincing, so he was awarded the prize and instructed to submit the manuscript for publication. The paper was already at the printers and coming off the presses when Poincaré was asked by the competition organizer to check one last part of the proof which one of the reviewer’s had questioned relating to homoclinic orbits.\n\nTo Poincaré’s horror, as he checked his results against the reviewer’s comments, he found that he had made a fundamental error, and in fact the solar system would never be stable. The problem that he had overlooked had to do with the way that orbits can cross above or below each other on successive passes, leading to a tangle of orbital trajectories that crisscrossed each other in a fine mesh. This is known as the “homoclinic tangle”: it was the first glimpse that deterministic systems could lead to unpredictable results. Most importantly, he had developed the first mathematical tools that would be needed to analyze chaotic systems—such as the Poincaré section—but nearly half a century would pass before these tools would be picked up again.\n\nPoincaré paid out of his own pocket for the first printing to be destroyed and for the corrected version of his manuscript to be printed in its place [1]. No-one but the competition organizers and reviewers ever saw his first version. Yet it was when he was correcting his mistake that he stumbled on chaos for the first time, which is what posterity remembers him for. This little episode in the history of physics went undiscovered for a century before being brought to light by Barrow-Green in her 1997 book Poincaré and the Three Body Problem [2].\n\nCartwight and Littlewood (1945)\n\nDuring World War II, self-oscillations and nonlinear dynamics became strategic topics for the war effort in England. High-power magnetrons were driving long-range radar, keeping Britain alert to Luftwaffe bombing raids, and the tricky dynamics of these oscillators could be represented as a driven van der Pol oscillator. These oscillators had been studied in the 1920’s by the Dutch physicist Balthasar van der Pol (1889–1959) when he was completing his PhD thesis at the University of Utrecht on the topic of radio transmission through ionized gases. van der Pol had built a short-wave triode oscillator to perform experiments on radio diffraction to compare with his theoretical calculations of radio transmission. Van der Pol’s triode oscillator was an engineering feat that produced the shortest wavelengths of the day, making van der Pol intimately familiar with the operation of the oscillator, and he proposed a general form of differential equation for the triode oscillator.\n\nResearch on the radar magnetron led to theoretical work on driven nonlinear oscillators, including the discovery that a driven van der Pol oscillator could break up into wild and intermittent patterns. This “bad” behavior of the oscillator circuit (bad for radar applications) was the first discovery of chaotic behavior in man-made circuits.\n\nThese irregular properties of the driven van der Pol equation were studied by Mary- Lucy Cartwright (1990–1998) (the first woman to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society) and John Littlewood (1885–1977) at Cambridge who showed that the coexistence of two periodic solutions implied that discontinuously recurrent motion—in today’s parlance, chaos— could result, which was clearly undesirable for radar applications. The work of Cartwright and Littlewood [3] later inspired the work by Levinson and Smale as they introduced the field of nonlinear dynamics.\n\nAndrey Kolmogorov (1954)\n\nThe passing of the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin provided a long-needed opening for Soviet scientists to travel again to international conferences where they could meet with their western colleagues to exchange ideas. Four Russian mathematicians were allowed to attend the 1954 International Congress of Mathematics (ICM) held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. One of those was Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903 – 1987) who was asked to give the closing plenary speech. Despite the isolation of Russia during the Soviet years before World War II and later during the Cold War, Kolmogorov was internationally renowned as one of the greatest mathematicians of his day.\n\nBy 1954, Kolmogorov’s interests had spread into topics in topology, turbulence and logic, but no one was prepared for the topic of his plenary lecture at the ICM in Amsterdam. Kolmogorov spoke on the dusty old topic of Hamiltonian mechanics. He even apologized at the start for speaking on such an old topic when everyone had expected him to speak on probability theory. Yet, in the length of only half an hour he laid out a bold and brilliant outline to a proof that the three-body problem had an infinity of stable orbits. Furthermore, these stable orbits provided impenetrable barriers to the diffusion of chaotic motion across the full phase space of the mechanical system. The crucial consequences of this short talk were lost on almost everyone who attended as they walked away after the lecture, but Kolmogorov had discovered a deep lattice structure that constrained the chaotic dynamics of the solar system.\n\nKolmogorov’s approach used a result from number theory that provides a measure of how close an irrational number is to a rational one. This is an important question for orbital dynamics, because whenever the ratio of two orbital periods is a ratio of integers, especially when the integers are small, then the two bodies will be in a state of resonance, which was the fundamental source of chaos in Poincaré’s stability analysis of the three-body problem. After Komogorov had boldly presented his results at the ICM of 1954 [4], what remained was the necessary mathematical proof of Kolmogorov’s daring conjecture. This would be provided by one of his students, V. I. Arnold, a decade later. But before the mathematicians could settle the issue, an atmospheric scientist, using one of the first electronic computers, rediscovered Poincaré’s tangle, this time in a simplified model of the atmosphere.\n\nEdward Lorenz (1963)\n\nIn 1960, with the help of a friend at MIT, the atmospheric scientist Edward Lorenz purchased a Royal McBee LGP-30 tabletop computer to make calculation of a simplified model he had derived for the weather. The McBee used 113 of the latest miniature vacuum tubes and also had 1450 of the new solid-state diodes made of semiconductors rather than tubes, which helped reduce the size further, as well as reducing heat generation. The McBee had a clock rate of 120 kHz and operated on 31-bit numbers with a 15 kB memory. Under full load it used 1500 Watts of power to run. But even with a computer in hand, the atmospheric equations needed to be simplified to make the calculations tractable. Lorenz simplified the number of atmospheric equations down to twelve, and he began programming his Royal McBee.\n\nProgress was good, and by 1961, he had completed a large initial numerical study. One day, as he was testing his results, he decided to save time by starting the computations midway by using mid-point results from a previous run as initial conditions. He typed in the three-digit numbers from a paper printout and went down the hall for a cup of coffee. When he returned, he looked at the printout of the twelve variables and was disappointed to find that they were not related to the previous full-time run. He immediately suspected a faulty vacuum tube, as often happened. But as he looked closer at the numbers, he realized that, at first, they tracked very well with the original run, but then began to diverge more and more rapidly until they lost all connection with the first-run numbers. The internal numbers of the McBee had a precision of 6 decimal points, but the printer only printed three to save time and paper. His initial conditions were correct to a part in a thousand, but this small error was magnified exponentially as the solution progressed. When he printed out the full six digits (the resolution limit for the machine), and used these as initial conditions, the original trajectory returned. There was no mistake. The McBee was working perfectly.\n\nAt this point, Lorenz recalled that he “became rather excited”. He was looking at a complete breakdown of predictability in atmospheric science. If radically different behavior arose from the smallest errors, then no measurements would ever be accurate enough to be useful for long-range forecasting. At a more fundamental level, this was a break with a long-standing tradition in science and engineering that clung to the belief that small differences produced small effects. What Lorenz had discovered, instead, was that the deterministic solution to his 12 equations was exponentially sensitive to initial conditions (known today as SIC).\n\nThe more Lorenz became familiar with the behavior of his equations, the more he felt that the 12-dimensional trajectories had a repeatable shape. He tried to visualize this shape, to get a sense of its character, but it is difficult to visualize things in twelve dimensions, and progress was slow, so he simplified his equations even further to three variables that could be represented in a three-dimensional graph [5].\n\nV. I. Arnold (1964)\n\nMeanwhile, back in Moscow, an energetic and creative young mathematics student knocked on Kolmogorov’s door looking for an advisor for his undergraduate thesis. The youth was Vladimir Igorevich Arnold (1937 – 2010), who showed promise, so Kolmogorov took him on as his advisee. They worked on the surprisingly complex properties of the mapping of a circle onto itself, which Arnold filed as his dissertation in 1959. The circle map holds close similarities with the periodic orbits of the planets, and this problem led Arnold down a path that drew tantalizingly close to Kolmogorov’s conjecture on Hamiltonian stability. Arnold continued in his PhD with Kolmogorov, solving Hilbert’s 13th problem by showing that every function of n variables can be represented by continuous functions of a single variable. Arnold was appointed as an assistant in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University.\n\nArnold’s habilitation topic was Kolmogorov’s conjecture, and his approach used the same circle map that had played an important role in solving Hilbert’s 13th problem. Kolmogorov neither encouraged nor discouraged Arnold to tackle his conjecture. Arnold was led to it independently by the similarity of the stability problem with the problem of continuous functions. In reference to his shift to this new topic for his habilitation, Arnold stated “The mysterious interrelations between different branches of mathematics with seemingly no connections are still an enigma for me.” [6]\n\nArnold began with the problem of attracting and repelling fixed points in the circle map and made a fundamental connection to the theory of invariant properties of action-angle variables . These provided a key element in the proof of Kolmogorov’s conjecture. In late 1961, Arnold submitted his results to the leading Soviet physics journal—which promptly rejected it because he used forbidden terms for the journal, such as “theorem” and “proof”, and he had used obscure terminology that would confuse their usual physicist readership, terminology such as “Lesbesgue measure”, “invariant tori” and “Diophantine conditions”. Arnold withdrew the paper.\n\nArnold later incorporated an approach pioneered by Jurgen Moser [7] and published a definitive article on the problem of small divisors in 1963 [8]. The combined work of Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser had finally established the stability of irrational orbits in the three-body problem, the most irrational and hence most stable orbit having the frequency of the golden mean. The term “KAM theory”, using the first initials of the three theorists, was coined in 1968 by B. V. Chirikov, who also introduced in 1969 what has become known as the Chirikov map (also known as the Standard map ) that reduced the abstract circle maps of Arnold and Moser to simple iterated functions that any student can program easily on a computer to explore KAM invariant tori and the onset of Hamiltonian chaos, as in Fig. 1 [9].\n\nSephen Smale (1967)\n\nStephen Smale was at the end of a post-graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation when he went to Rio to work with Mauricio Peixoto. Smale and Peixoto had met in Princeton in 1960 where Peixoto was working with Solomon Lefschetz (1884 – 1972) who had an interest in oscillators that sustained their oscillations in the absence of a periodic force. For instance, a pendulum clock driven by the steady force of a hanging weight is a self-sustained oscillator. Lefschetz was building on work by the Russian Aleksandr A. Andronov (1901 – 1952) who worked in the secret science city of Gorky in the 1930’s on nonlinear self-oscillations using Poincaré’s first return map. The map converted the continuous trajectories of dynamical systems into discrete numbers, simplifying problems of feedback and control.\n\nThe central question of mechanical control systems, even self-oscillating systems, was how to attain stability. By combining approaches of Poincaré and Lyapunov, as well as developing their own techniques, the Gorky school became world leaders in the theory and applications of nonlinear oscillations. Andronov published a seminal textbook in 1937 The Theory of Oscillations with his colleagues Vitt and Khaykin, and Lefschetz had obtained and translated the book into English in 1947, introducing it to the West. When Peixoto returned to Rio, his interest in nonlinear oscillations captured the imagination of Smale even though his main mathematical focus was on problems of topology. On the beach in Rio, Smale had an idea that topology could help prove whether systems had a finite number of periodic points. Peixoto had already proven this for two dimensions, but Smale wanted to find a more general proof for any number of dimensions.\n\nNorman Levinson (1912 – 1975) at MIT became aware of Smale’s interests and sent off a letter to Rio in which he suggested that Smale should look at Levinson’s work on the triode self-oscillator (a van der Pol oscillator), as well as the work of Cartwright and Littlewood who had discovered quasi-periodic behavior hidden within the equations. Smale was puzzled but intrigued by Levinson’s paper that had no drawings or visualization aids, so he started scribbling curves on paper that bent back upon themselves in ways suggested by the van der Pol dynamics. During a visit to Berkeley later that year, he presented his preliminary work, and a colleague suggested that the curves looked like strips that were being stretched and bent into a horseshoe.\n\nSmale latched onto this idea, realizing that the strips were being successively stretched and folded under the repeated transformation of the dynamical equations. Furthermore, because dynamics can move forward in time as well as backwards, there was a sister set of horseshoes that were crossing the original set at right angles. As the dynamics proceeded, these two sets of horseshoes were repeatedly stretched and folded across each other, creating an infinite latticework of intersections that had the properties of the Cantor set. Here was solid proof that Smale’s original conjecture was wrong—the dynamics had an infinite number of periodicities, and they were nested in self-similar patterns in a latticework of points that map out a Cantor-like set of points. In the two-dimensional case, shown in the figure, the fractal dimension of this lattice is D = ln4/ln3 = 1.26, somewhere in dimensionality between a line and a plane. Smale’s infinitely nested set of periodic points was the same tangle of points that Poincaré had noticed while he was correcting his King Otto Prize manuscript. Smale, using modern principles of topology, was finally able to put rigorous mathematical structure to Poincaré’s homoclinic tangle. Coincidentally, Poincaré had launched the modern field of topology, so in a sense he sowed the seeds to the solution to his own problem.\n\nRuelle and Takens (1971)\n\nThe onset of turbulence was an iconic problem in nonlinear physics with a long history and a long list of famous researchers studying it. As far back as the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci had made detailed studies of water cascades, sketching whorls upon whorls in charcoal in his famous notebooks. Heisenberg, oddly, wrote his PhD dissertation on the topic of turbulence even while he was inventing quantum mechanics on the side. Kolmogorov in the 1940’s applied his probabilistic theories to turbulence, and this statistical approach dominated most studies up to the time when David Ruelle and Floris Takens published a paper in 1971 that took a nonlinear dynamics approach to the problem rather than statistical, identifying strange attractors in the nonlinear dynamical Navier-Stokes equations [10]. This paper coined the phrase “strange attractor”. One of the distinct characteristics of their approach was the identification of a bifurcation cascade. A single bifurcation means a sudden splitting of an orbit when a parameter is changed slightly. In contrast, a bifurcation cascade was not just a single Hopf bifurcation, as seen in earlier nonlinear models, but was a succession of Hopf bifurcations that doubled the period each time, so that period-two attractors became period-four attractors, then period-eight and so on, coming fast and faster, until full chaos emerged. A few years later Gollub and Swinney experimentally verified the cascade route to turbulence , publishing their results in 1975 [11].\n\nFeigenbaum (1978)\n\nIn 1976, computers were not common research tools, although hand-held calculators now were. One of the most famous of this era was the Hewlett-Packard HP-65, and Feigenbaum pushed it to its limits. He was particularly interested in the bifurcation cascade of the logistic map [12]—the way that bifurcations piled on top of bifurcations in a forking structure that showed increasing detail at increasingly fine scales. Feigenbaum was, after all, a high-energy theorist and had overlapped at Cornell with Kenneth Wilson when he was completing his seminal work on the renormalization group approach to scaling phenomena. Feigenbaum recognized a strong similarity between the bifurcation cascade and the ideas of real-space renormalization where smaller and smaller boxes were used to divide up space.\n\nOne of the key steps in the renormalization procedure was the need to identify a ratio of the sizes of smaller structures to larger structures. Feigenbaum began by studying how the bifurcations depended on the increasing growth rate. He calculated the threshold values rm for each of the bifurcations, and then took the ratios of the intervals, comparing the previous interval (rm-1 – rm-2) to the next interval (rm – rm-1). This procedure is like the well-known method to calculate the golden ratio = 1.61803 from the Fibonacci series, and Feigenbaum might have expected the golden ratio to emerge from his analysis of the logistic map. After all, the golden ratio has a scary habit of showing up in physics, just like in the KAM theory. However, as the bifurcation index m increased in Feigenbaum’s study, this ratio settled down to a limiting value of 4.66920. Then he did what anyone would do with an unfamiliar number that emerges from a physical calculation—he tried to see if it was a combination of other fundamental numbers, like pi and Euler’s constant e, and even the golden ratio. But none of these worked. He had found a new number that had universal application to chaos theory [13].\n\nGleick (1987)\n\nBy the mid-1980’s, chaos theory was seeping in to a broadening range of research topics that seemed to span the full breadth of science, from biology to astrophysics, from mechanics to chemistry. A particularly active group of chaos practitioners were J. Doyn Farmer, James Crutchfield, Norman Packard and Robert Shaw who founded the Dynamical Systems Collective at the University of California, Santa Cruz. One of the important outcomes of their work was a method to reconstruct the state space of a complex system using only its representative time series [14]. Their work helped proliferate the techniques of chaos theory into the mainstream. Many who started using these techniques were only vaguely aware of its long history until the science writer James Gleick wrote a best-selling history of the subject that brought chaos theory to the forefront of popular science [15]. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Poincaré, H. and D. L. Goroff (1993). New methods of celestial mechanics. Edited and introduced by Daniel L. Goroff.

For small perturbation ε, two fixed points appear along the line J = 0 corresponding to p/q = 1: one is an elliptical point (with surrounding small orbits) and the other is a hyperbolic point where chaotic behavior is first observed. With increasing perturbation, q elliptical points and q hyperbolic points emerge for orbits with winding numbers p/q with small denominators (1/2, 1/3, 2/3 etc.). Other orbits with larger q are warped by the increasing perturbation but are not chaotic. These orbits reside on invariant tori, known as the KAM tori, that do not disintegrate into chaos at small perturbation. The set of KAM tori is a Cantor-like set with non- zero measure, ensuring that stable behavior can survive in the presence of perturbations, such as perturbation of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun by Jupiter. However, with increasing perturbation, orbits with successively larger values of q disintegrate into chaos. The last orbits to survive in the Standard Map are the golden mean orbits with p/q = φ–1 and p/q = 2–φ. The critical value of the perturbation required for the golden mean orbits to disintegrate into chaos is surprisingly large at εc = 0.97.\n\n[10] Ruelle,D. and F.Takens (1971).“OntheNatureofTurbulence.”Communications in Mathematical Physics 20(3): 167–92.\n\n[11] Gollub, J.

Forget the dimension of time—that may be the most mysterious of all—but consider the extra spatial dimensions that challenge the mind and open the door to dreams of going beyond the bounds of today’s physics.\n\nThe geometry of n dimensions studies reality; no one doubts that. Bodies in hyperspace are subject to precise definition, just like bodies in ordinary space; and while we cannot draw pictures of them, we can imagine and study them.\n\n(Poincare 1895)\n\nHere is a short history of hyperspace. It begins with advances by Möbius and Liouville and Jacobi who never truly realized what they had invented, until Cayley and Grassmann and Riemann made it explicit. They opened Pandora’s box, and multiple dimensions burst upon the world never to be put back again, giving us today the manifolds of string theory and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\n\nAugust Möbius (1827)\n\nAlthough he is most famous for the single-surface strip that bears his name, one of the early contributions of August Möbius was the idea of barycentric coordinates [1] , for instance using three coordinates to express the locations of points in a two-dimensional simplex—the triangle. Barycentric coordinates are used routinely today in metallurgy to describe the alloy composition in ternary alloys.\n\nMöbius’ work was one of the first to hint that tuples of numbers could stand in for higher dimensional space, and they were an early example of homogeneous coordinates that could be used for higher-dimensional representations. However, he was too early to use any language of multidimensional geometry.\n\nCarl Jacobi (1834)\n\nCarl Jacobi was a master at manipulating multiple variables, leading to his development of the theory of matrices. In this context, he came to study (n-1)-fold integrals over multiple continuous-valued variables. From our modern viewpoint, he was evaluating surface integrals of hyperspheres.\n\nIn 1834, Jacobi found explicit solutions to these integrals and published them in a paper with the imposing title “De binis quibuslibet functionibus homogeneis secundi ordinis per substitutiones lineares in alias binas transformandis, quae solis quadratis variabilium constant; una cum variis theorematis de transformatione et determinatione integralium multiplicium” [2]. The resulting (n-1)-fold integrals are\n\nwhen the space dimension is even or odd, respectively. These are the surface areas of the manifolds called (n-1)-spheres in n-dimensional space. For instance, the 2-sphere is the ordinary surface 4πr2 of a sphere on our 3D space.\n\nDespite the fact that we recognize these as surface areas of hyperspheres, Jacobi used no geometric language in his paper. He was still too early, and mathematicians had not yet woken up to the analogy of extending spatial dimensions beyond 3D.\n\nJoseph Liouville (1838)\n\nJoseph Liouville’s name is attached to a theorem that lies at the core of mechanical systems—Liouville’s Theorem that proves that volumes in high-dimensional phase space are incompressible. Surprisingly, Liouville had no conception of high dimensional space, to say nothing of abstract phase space. The story of the convoluted path that led Liouville’s name to be attached to his theorem is told in Chapter 6, “The Tangled Tale of Phase Space”, in Galileo Unbound (Oxford University Press, 2018).\n\nNonetheless, Liouville did publish a pure-mathematics paper in 1838 in Crelle’s Journal [3] that identified an invariant quantity that stayed constant during the differential change of multiple variables when certain criteria were satisfied. It was only later that Jacobi, as he was developing a new mechanical theory based on William R. Hamilton’s work, realized that the criteria needed for Liouville’s invariant quantity to hold were satisfied by conservative mechanical systems. Even then, neither Liouville nor Jacobi used the language of multidimensional geometry, but that was about to change in a quick succession of papers and books by three mathematicians who, unknown to each other, were all thinking along the same lines.\n\nArthur Cayley (1843)\n\nArthur Cayley was the first to take the bold step to call the emerging geometry of multiple variables to be actual space. His seminal paper “Chapters in the Analytic Theory of n-Dimensions” was published in 1843 in the Philosophical Magazine [4]. Here, for the first time, Cayley recognized that the domain of multiple variables behaved identically to multidimensional space. He used little of the language of geometry in the paper, which was mostly analysis rather than geometry, but his bold declaration for spaces of n-dimensions opened the door to a changing mindset that would soon sweep through geometric reasoning.\n\nHermann Grassmann (1844)\n\nGrassmann’s life story, although not overly tragic, was beset by lifelong setbacks and frustrations. He was a mathematician literally 30 years ahead of his time, but because he was merely a high-school teacher, no-one took his ideas seriously.\n\nSomehow, in nearly a complete vacuum, disconnected from the professional mathematicians of his day, he devised an entirely new type of algebra that allowed geometric objects to have orientation. These could be combined in numerous different ways obeying numerous different laws. The simplest elements were just numbers, but these could be extended to arbitrary complexity with arbitrary number of elements. He called his theory a theory of “Extension”, and he self-published a thick and difficult tome that contained all of his ideas [5]. He tried to enlist Möbius to help disseminate his ideas, but even Möbius could not recognize what Grassmann had achieved.\n\nIn fact, what Grassmann did achieve was vector algebra of arbitrarily high dimension. Perhaps more impressive for the time is that he actually recognized what he was dealing with. He did not know of Cayley’s work, but independently of Cayley he used geometric language for the first time describing geometric objects in high dimensional spaces. He said, “since this method of formation is theoretically applicable without restriction, I can define systems of arbitrarily high level by this method… geometry goes no further, but abstract science knows no limits.” [6]\n\nGrassman was convinced that he had discovered something astonishing and new, which he had, but no one understood him. After years trying to get mathematicians to listen, he finally gave up, left mathematics behind, and actually achieved some fame within his lifetime in the field of linguistics. There is even a law of diachronic linguistics named after him. For the story of Grassmann’s struggles, see the blog on Grassmann and his Wedge Product .\n\nJulius Plücker (1846)\n\nProjective geometry sounds like it ought to be a simple topic, like the projective property of perspective art as parallel lines draw together and touch at the vanishing point on the horizon of a painting. But it is far more complex than that, and it provided a separate gateway into the geometry of high dimensions.\n\nA hint of its power comes from homogeneous coordinates of the plane. These are used to find where a point in three dimensions intersects a plane (like the plane of an artist’s canvas). Although the point on the plane is in two dimensions, it take three homogeneous coordinates to locate it. By extension, if a point is located in three dimensions, then it has four homogeneous coordinates, as if the three dimensional point were a projection onto 3D from a 4D space.\n\nThese ideas were pursued by Julius Plücker as he extended projective geometry from the work of earlier mathematicians such as Desargues and Möbius. For instance, the barycentric coordinates of Möbius are a form of homogeneous coordinates. What Plücker discovered is that space does not need to be defined by a dense set of points, but a dense set of lines can be used just as well. The set of lines is represented as a four-dimensional manifold. Plücker reported his findings in a book in 1846 [7] and expanded on the concepts of multidimensional spaces published in 1868 [8].\n\nLudwig Schläfli (1851)\n\nAfter Plücker, ideas of multidimensional analysis became more common, and Ludwig Schläfli (1814 – 1895), a professor at the University of Berne in Switzerland, was one of the first to fully explore analytic geometry in higher dimensions. He described multidimsnional points that were located on hyperplanes, and he calculated the angles between intersecting hyperplanes [9]. He also investigated high-dimensional polytopes, from which are derived our modern “Schläfli notation“. However, Schläffli used his own terminology for these objects, emphasizing analytic properties without using the ordinary language of high-dimensional geometry.\n\nBernhard Riemann (1854)\n\nThe person most responsible for the shift in the mindset that finally accepted the geometry of high-dimensional spaces was Bernhard Riemann. In 1854 at the university in Göttingen he presented his habilitation talk “Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen” (Over the hypotheses on which geometry is founded). A habilitation in Germany was an examination that qualified an academic to be able to advise their own students (somewhat like attaining tenure in US universities).\n\nThe habilitation candidate would suggest three topics, and it was usual for the first or second to be picked. Riemann’s three topics were: trigonometric properties of functions (he was the first to rigorously prove the convergence properties of Fourier series), aspects of electromagnetic theory, and a throw-away topic that he added at the last minute on the foundations of geometry (on which he had not actually done any serious work). Gauss was his faculty advisor and picked the third topic. Riemann had to develop the topic in a very short time period, starting from scratch. The effort exhausted him mentally and emotionally, and he had to withdraw temporarily from the university to regain his strength. After returning around Easter, he worked furiously for seven weeks to develop a first draft and then asked Gauss to set the examination date. Gauss initially thought to postpone to the Fall semester, but then at the last minute scheduled the talk for the next day. (For the story of Riemann and Gauss, see Chapter 4 “Geometry on my Mind” in the book Galileo Unbound (Oxford, 2018)).\n\nRiemann gave his lecture on 10 June 1854, and it was a masterpiece. He stripped away all the old notions of space and dimensions and imbued geometry with a metric structure that was fundamentally attached to coordinate transformations. He also showed how any set of coordinates could describe space of any dimension, and he generalized ideas of space to include virtually any ordered set of measurables, whether it was of temperature or color or sound or anything else. Most importantly, his new system made explicit what those before him had alluded to: Jacobi, Grassmann, Plücker and Schläfli. Ideas of Riemannian geometry began to percolate through the mathematics world, expanding into common use after Richard Dedekind edited and published Riemann’s habilitation lecture in 1868 [10].\n\nGeorge Cantor and Dimension Theory (1878)\n\nIn discussions of multidimensional spaces, it is important to step back and ask what is dimension? This question is not as easy to answer as it may seem. In fact, in 1878, George Cantor proved that there is a one-to-one mapping of the plane to the line, making it seem that lines and planes are somehow the same. He was so astonished at his own results that he wrote in a letter to his friend Richard Dedekind “I see it, but I don’t believe it!”. A few decades later, Peano and Hilbert showed how to create area-filling curves so that a single continuous curve can approach any point in the plane arbitrarily closely, again casting shadows of doubt on the robustness of dimension. These questions of dimensionality would not be put to rest until the work by Karl Menger around 1926 when he provided a rigorous definition of topological dimension (see the Blog on the History of Fractals).\n\nHermann Minkowski and Spacetime (1908)\n\nMost of the earlier work on multidimensional spaces were mathematical and geometric rather than physical. One of the first examples of physical hyperspace is the spacetime of Hermann Minkowski. Although Einstein and Poincaré had noted how space and time were coupled by the Lorentz equations, they did not take the bold step of recognizing space and time as parts of a single manifold. This step was taken in 1908 [11] by Hermann Minkowski who claimed\n\n“Gentlemen! The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you … They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.”Herman Minkowski (1908)\n\nFor the story of Einstein and Minkowski, see the Blog on Minkowski’s Spacetime: The Theory that Einstein Overlooked.\n\nFelix Hausdorff and Fractals (1918)\n\nNo story of multiple “integer” dimensions can be complete without mentioning the existence of “fractional” dimensions, also known as fractals. The individual who is most responsible for the concepts and mathematics of fractional dimensions was Felix Hausdorff. Before being compelled to commit suicide by being jewish in Nazi Germany, he was a leading light in the intellectual life of Leipzig, Germany. By day he was a brilliant mathematician, by night he was the author Paul Mongré writing poetry and plays.\n\nIn 1918, as the war was ending, he wrote a small book “Dimension and Outer Measure” that established ways to construct sets whose measured dimensions were fractions rather than integers [12]. Benoit Mandelbrot would later popularize these sets as “fractals” in the 1980’s. For the background on a history of fractals, see the Blog A Short History of Fractals.\n\nThe Fifth Dimension of Theodore Kaluza (1921) and Oskar Klein (1926)\n\nThe first theoretical steps to develop a theory of a physical hyperspace (in contrast to merely a geometric hyperspace) were taken by Theodore Kaluza at the University of Königsberg in Prussia. He added an additional spatial dimension to Minkowski spacetime as an attempt to unify the forces of gravity with the forces of electromagnetism. Kaluza’s paper was communicated to the journal of the Prussian Academy of Science in 1921 through Einstein who saw the unification principles as a parallel of some of his own attempts [13]. However, Kaluza’s theory was fully classical and did not include the new quantum theory that was developing at that time in the hands of Heisenberg, Bohr and Born.\n\nOskar Klein was a Swedish physicist who was in the “second wave” of quantum physicists having studied under Bohr. Unaware of Kaluza’s work, Klein developed a quantum theory of a five-dimensional spacetime [14]. For the theory to be self-consistent, it was necessary to roll up the extra dimension into a tight cylinder. This is like a strand a spaghetti—looking at it from far away it looks like a one-dimensional string, but an ant crawling on the spaghetti can move in two dimensions—along the long direction, or looping around it in the short direction called a compact dimension. Klein’s theory was an early attempt at what would later be called string theory. For the historical background on Kaluza and Klein, see the Blog on Oskar Klein.\n\nJohn Campbell (1931): Hyperspace in Science Fiction\n\nArt has a long history of shadowing the sciences, and the math and science of hyperspace was no exception. One of the first mentions of hyperspace in science fiction was in the story “Islands in Space’, by John Campbell [15], published in the Amazing Stories quarterly in 1931, where it was used as an extraordinary means of space travel.\n\nIn 1951, Isaac Asimov made travel through hyperspace the transportation network that connected the galaxy in his Foundation Trilogy [16].\n\nJohn von Neumann and Hilbert Space (1932)\n\nQuantum mechanics had developed rapidly through the 1920’s, but by the early 1930’s it was in need of an overhaul, having outstripped rigorous mathematical underpinnings. These underpinnings were provided by John von Neumann in his 1932 book on quantum theory [17]. This is the book that cemented the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, with projection measurements and wave function collapse, while also establishing the formalism of Hilbert space.\n\nHilbert space is an infinite dimensional vector space of orthogonal eigenfunctions into which any quantum wave function can be decomposed. The physicists of today work and sleep in Hilbert space as their natural environment, often losing sight of its infinite dimensions that don’t seem to bother anyone. Hilbert space is more than a mere geometrical space, but less than a full physical space (like five-dimensional spacetime). Few realize that what is so often ascribed to Hilbert was actually formalized by von Neumann, among his many other accomplishments like stored-program computers and game theory.\n\nEinstein-Rosen Bridge (1935)\n\nOne of the strangest entities inhabiting the theory of spacetime is the Einstein-Rosen Bridge. It is space folded back on itself in a way that punches a short-cut through spacetime. Einstein, working with his collaborator Nathan Rosen at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, published a paper in 1935 that attempted to solve two problems [18]. The first problem was the Schwarzschild singularity at a radius r = 2M/c2 known as the Schwarzschild radius or the Event Horizon. Einstein had a distaste for such singularities in physical theory and viewed them as a problem. The second problem was how to apply the theory of general relativity (GR) to point masses like an electron. Again, the GR solution to an electron blows up at the location of the particle at r = 0.\n\nTo eliminate both problems, Einstein and Rosen (ER) began with the Schwarzschild metric in its usual form\n\nwhere it is easy to see that it “blows up” when r = 2M/c2 as well as at r = 0. ER realized that they could write a new form that bypasses the singularities using the simple coordinate substitution\n\nto yield the “wormhole” metric\n\nIt is easy to see that as the new variable u goes from -inf to +inf that this expression never blows up. The reason is simple—it removes the 1/r singularity by replacing it with 1/(r + ε). Such tricks are used routinely today in computational physics to keep computer calculations from getting too large—avoiding the divide-by-zero problem. It is also known as a form of regularization in machine learning applications. But in the hands of Einstein, this simple “bypass” is not just math, it can provide a physical solution.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that an article published in the Physical Review, especially one written about a simple variable substitution, would appear on the front page of the New York Times, even appearing “above the fold”, but such was Einstein’s fame this is exactly the response when he and Rosen published their paper. The reason for the interest was because of the interpretation of the new equation—when visualized geometrically, it was like a funnel between two separated Minkowski spaces—in other words, what was named a “wormhole” by John Wheeler in 1957. Even back in 1935, there was some sense that this new property of space might allow untold possibilities, perhaps even a form of travel through such a short cut.\n\nAs it turns out, the ER wormhole is not stable—it collapses on itself in an incredibly short time so that not even photons can get through it in time. More recent work on wormholes have shown that it can be stabilized by negative energy density, but ordinary matter cannot have negative energy density. On the other hand, the Casimir effect might have a type of negative energy density, which raises some interesting questions about quantum mechanics and the ER bridge.\n\nEdward Witten’s 10+1 Dimensions (1995)\n\nA history of hyperspace would not be complete without a mention of string theory and Edward Witten’s unification of the variously different 10-dimensional string theories into 10- or 11-dimensional M-theory. At a string theory conference at USC in 1995 he pointed out that the 5 different string theories of the day were all related through dualities. This observation launched the second superstring revolution that continues today. In this theory, 6 extra spatial dimensions are wrapped up into complex manifolds such as the Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\nProspects\n\nThere is definitely something wrong with our three-plus-one dimensions of spacetime. We claim that we have achieved the pinnacle of fundamental physics with what is called the Standard Model and the Higgs boson, but dark energy and dark matter loom as giant white elephants in the room. They are giant, gaping, embarrassing and currently unsolved. By some estimates, the fraction of the energy density of the universe comprised of ordinary matter is only 5%. The other 95% is in some form unknown to physics. How can physicists claim to know anything if 95% of everything is in some unknown form?\n\nThe answer, perhaps to be uncovered sometime in this century, may be the role of extra dimensions in physical phenomena—probably not in every-day phenomena, and maybe not even in high-energy particles—but in the grand expanse of the cosmos.\n\nBy David D.

In each case, no physical principle is violated, and each paradox is fully explained.\n\nHowever, there is at least one “true” paradox in physics that defies consistent explanation—quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement was first described by Einstein with colleagues Podolsky and Rosen in the famous EPR paper of 1935 as an argument against the completeness of quantum mechanics, and it was given its name by Schrödinger the same year in the paper where he introduced his “cat” as a burlesque consequence of entanglement.\n\nHere is a short history of quantum entanglement [1], from its beginnings in 1935 to the recent 2022 Nobel prize in Physics awarded to John Clauser, Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger.\n\nThe EPR Papers of 1935\n\nEinstein can be considered as the father of quantum mechanics, even over Planck, because of his 1905 derivation of the existence of the photon as a discrete carrier of a quantum of energy (see Einstein versus Planck). Even so, as Heisenberg and Bohr advanced quantum mechanics in the mid 1920’s, emphasizing the underlying non-deterministic outcomes of measurements, and in particular the notion of instantaneous wavefunction collapse, they pushed the theory in directions that Einstein found increasingly disturbing and unacceptable.\n\nThis feature is an excerpt from an upcoming book, Interference: The History of Optical Interferometry and the Scientists Who Tamed Light (Oxford University Press, July 2023), by David D. Nolte.\n\nAt the invitation-only Solvay Congresses of 1927 and 1930, where all the top physicists met to debate the latest advances, Einstein and Bohr began a running debate that was epic in the history of physics as the two top minds went head-to-head as the onlookers looked on in awe. Ultimately, Einstein was on the losing end. Although he was convinced that something was missing in quantum theory, he could not counter all of Bohr’s rejoinders, even as Einstein’s assaults became ever more sophisticated, and he left the field of battle beaten but not convinced. Several years later he launched his last and ultimate salvo.\n\nAt the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in the 1930’s Einstein was working with Nathan Rosen and Boris Podolsky when he envisioned a fundamental paradox in quantum theory that occurred when two widely-separated quantum particles were required to share specific physical properties because of simple conservation theorems like energy and momentum. Even Bohr and Heisenberg could not deny the principle of conservation of energy and momentum, and Einstein devised a two-particle system for which these conservation principles led to an apparent violation of Heisenberg’s own uncertainty principle. He left the details to his colleagues, with Podolsky writing up the main arguments. They published the paper in the Physical Review in March of 1935 with the title “Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete” [2]. Because of the three names on the paper (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen), it became known as the EPR paper, and the paradox they presented became known as the EPR paradox.\n\nWhen Bohr read the paper, he was initially stumped and aghast. He felt that EPR had shaken the very foundations of the quantum theory that he and his institute had fought so hard to establish. He also suspected that EPR had made a mistake in their arguments, and he halted all work at his institute in Copenhagen until they could construct a definitive answer. A few months later, Bohr published a paper in the Physical Review in July of 1935, using the identical title that EPR had used, in which he refuted the EPR paradox [3]. There is not a single equation or figure in the paper, but he used his “awful incantation terminology” to maximum effect, showing that one of the EPR assumptions on the assessment of uncertainties to position and momentum was in error, and he was right.\n\nEinstein was disgusted. He had hoped that this ultimate argument against the completeness of quantum mechanics would stand the test of time, but Bohr had shot it down within mere months. Einstein was particularly disappointed with Podolsky, because Podolsky had tried too hard to make the argument specific to position and momentum, leaving a loophole for Bohr to wiggle through, where Einstein had wanted the argument to rest on deeper and more general principles.\n\nDespite Bohr’s victory, Einstein had been correct in his initial formulation of the EPR paradox that showed quantum mechanics did not jibe with common notions of reality. He and Schrödinger exchanged letters commiserating with each other and encouraging each other in their counter beliefs against Bohr and Heisenberg. In November of 1935, Schrödinger published a broad, mostly philosophical, paper in Naturwissenschaften [4] in which he amplified the EPR paradox with the use of an absurd—what he called burlesque—consequence of wavefunction collapse that became known as Schrödinger’s Cat. He also gave the central property of the EPR paradox its name: entanglement.\n\nIronically, both Einstein’s entanglement paradox and Schrödinger’s Cat, which were formulated originally to be arguments against the validity of quantum theory, have become established quantum tools. Today, entangled particles are the core workhorses of quantum information systems, and physicists are building larger and larger versions of Schrödinger’s Cat that may eventually merge with the physics of the macroscopic world.\n\nBohm and Ahronov Tackle EPR\n\nThe physicist David Bohm was a rare political exile from the United States. He was born in the heart of Pennsylvania in the town of Wilkes-Barre, attended Penn State and then the University of California at Berkeley, where he joined Robert Oppenheimer’s research group. While there, he became deeply involved in the fight for unions and socialism, activities for which he was called before McCarthy’s Committee on Un-American Activities. He invoked his right to the fifth amendment for which he was arrested. Although he was later acquitted, Princeton University fired him from his faculty position, and fearing another arrest, he fled to Brazil where his US passport was confiscated by American authorities. He had become a physicist without a country.\n\nDespite his personal trials, Bohm remained scientifically productive. He published his influential textbook on quantum mechanics in the midst of his Senate hearings, and after a particularly stimulating discussion with Einstein shortly before he fled the US, he developed and published an alternative version of quantum theory in 1952 that was fully deterministic—removing Einstein’s “God playing dice”—by creating a hidden-variable theory [5].\n\nHidden-variable theories of quantum mechanics seek to remove the randomness of quantum measurement by assuming that some deeper element of quantum phenomena—a hidden variable—explains each outcome. But it is also assumed that these hidden variables are not directly accessible to experiment. In this sense, the quantum theory of Bohr and Heisenberg was “correct” but not “complete”, because there were things that the theory could not predict or explain.\n\nBohm’s hidden variable theory, based on a quantum potential, was able to reproduce all the known results of standard quantum theory without invoking the random experimental outcomes that Einstein abhorred. However, it still contained one crucial element that could not sweep away the EPR paradox—it was nonlocal.\n\nNonlocality lies at the heart of quantum theory. In its simplest form, the nonlocal nature of quantum phenomenon says that quantum states span spacetime with space-like separations, meaning that parts of the wavefunction are non-causally connected to other parts of the wavefunction. Because Einstein was fundamentally committed to causality, the nonlocality of quantum theory was what he found most objectionable, and Bohm’s elegant hidden-variable theory, that removed Einstein’s dreaded randomness, could not remove that last objection of non-causality.\n\nAfter working in Brazil for several years, Bohm moved to the Technion University in Israel where he began a fruitful collaboration with Yakir Ahronov. In addition to proposing the Ahronov-Bohm effect, in 1957 they reformulated Podolsky’s version of the EPR paradox that relied on continuous values of position and momentum and replaced it with a much simpler model based on the Stern-Gerlach effect on spins and further to the case of positronium decay into two photons with correlated polarizations. Bohm and Ahronov reassessed experimental results of positronium decay that had been made by Madame Wu in 1950 at Columbia University and found it in full agreement with standard quantum theory.\n\nJohn Bell’s Inequalities\n\nJohn Stuart Bell had an unusual start for a physicist. His family was too poor to give him an education appropriate to his skills, so he enrolled in vocational school where he took practical classes that included brick laying. Working later as a technician in a university lab, he caught the attention of his professors who sponsored him to attend the university. With a degree in physics, he began working at CERN as an accelerator designer when he again caught the attention of his supervisors who sponsored him to attend graduate school. He graduated with a PhD and returned to CERN as a card-carrying physicist with all the rights and privileges that entailed.\n\nDuring his university days, he had been fascinated by the EPR paradox, and he continued thinking about the fundamentals of quantum theory. On a sabbatical to the Stanford accelerator in 1960 he began putting mathematics to the EPR paradox to see whether any local hidden variable theory could be compatible with quantum mechanics. His analysis was fully general, so that it could rule out as-yet-unthought-of hidden-variable theories. The result of this work was a set of inequalities that must be obeyed by any local hidden-variable theory. Then he made a simple check using the known results of quantum measurement and showed that his inequalities are violated by quantum systems. This ruled out the possibility of any local hidden variable theory (but not Bohm’s nonlocal hidden-variable theory). Bell published his analysis in 1964 [6] in an obscure journal that almost no one read…except for a curious graduate student at Columbia University who began digging into the fundamental underpinnings of quantum theory against his supervisor’s advice.\n\nJohn Clauser’s Tenacious Pursuit\n\nAs a graduate student in astrophysics at Columbia University, John Clauser was supposed to be doing astrophysics. Instead, he spent his time musing over the fundamentals of quantum theory. In 1967 Clauser stumbled across Bell’s paper while he was in the library. The paper caught his imagination, but he also recognized that the inequalities were not experimentally testable, because they required measurements that depended directly on hidden variables, which are not accessible. He began thinking of ways to construct similar inequalities that could be put to an experimental test, and he wrote about his ideas to Bell, who responded with encouragement. Clauser wrote up his ideas in an abstract for an upcoming meeting of the American Physical Society, where one of the abstract reviewers was Abner Shimony of Boston University. Clauser was surprised weeks later when he received a telephone call from Shimony. Shimony and his graduate student Micheal Horne had been thinking along similar lines, and Shimony proposed to Clauser that they join forces. They met in Boston where they were met Richard Holt, a graudate student at Harvard who was working on experimental tests of quantum mechanics. Collectively, they devised a new type of Bell inequality that could be put to experimental test [7]. The result has become known as the CHSH Bell inequality (after Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt).\n\nWhen Clauser took a post-doc position in Berkeley, he began searching for a way to do the experiments to test the CHSH inequality, even though Holt had a head start at Harvard. Clauser enlisted the help of Charles Townes, who convinced one of the Berkeley faculty to loan Clauser his graduate student, Stuart Freedman, to help. Clauser and Freedman performed the experiments, using a two-photon optical decay of calcium ions and found a violation of the CHSH inequality by 5 standard deviations, publishing their result in 1972 [8].\n\nAlain Aspect’s Non-locality\n\nJust as Clauser’s life was changed when he stumbled on Bell’s obscure paper in 1967, the paper had the same effect on the life of French physicist Alain Aspect who stumbled on it in 1975. Like Clauser, he also sought out Bell for his opinion, meeting with him in Geneva, and Aspect similarly received Bell’s encouragement, this time with the hope to build upon Clauser’s work.\n\nIn some respects, the conceptual breakthrough achieved by Clauser had been the CHSH inequality that could be tested experimentally. The subsequent Clauser Freedman experiments were not a conclusion, but were just the beginning, opening the door to deeper tests. For instance, in the Clauser-Freedman experiments, the polarizers were static, and the detectors were not widely separated, which allowed the measurements to be time-like separated in spacetime. Therefore, the fundamental non-local nature of quantum physics had not been tested.\n\nAspect began a thorough and systematic program, that would take him nearly a decade to complete, to test the CHSH inequality under conditions of non-locality. He began with a much brighter source of photons produced using laser excitation of the calcium ions. This allowed him to perform the experiment in 100’s of seconds instead of the hundreds of hours by Clauser. With such a high data rate, Aspect was able to verify violation of the Bell inequality to 10 standard deviations, published in 1981 [9].\n\nHowever, the real goal was to change the orientations of the polarizers while the photons were in flight to widely separated detectors [10]. This experiment would allow the detection to be space-like separated in spacetime. The experiments were performed using fast-switching acoustic-optic modulators, and the Bell inequality was violated to 5 standard deviations [11]. This was the most stringent test yet performed and the first to fully demonstrate the non-local nature of quantum physics.\n\nAnton Zeilinger: Master of Entanglement\n\nIf there is one physicist today whose work encompasses the broadest range of entangled phenomena, it would be the Austrian physicist, Anton Zeilinger. He began his career in neutron interferometery, but when he was bitten by the entanglement bug in 1976, he switched to quantum photonics because of the superior control that can be exercised using optics over sources and receivers and all the optical manipulations in between.\n\nWorking with Daniel Greenberger and Micheal Horne, they took the essential next step past the Bohm two-particle entanglement to consider a 3-particle entangled state that had surprising properties. While the violation of locality by the two-particle entanglement was observed through the statistical properties of many measurements, the new 3-particle entanglement could show violations on single measurements, further strengthening the arguments for quantum non-locality. This new state is called the GHZ state (after Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger) [12].\n\nAs the Zeilinger group in Vienna was working towards experimental demonstrations of the GHZ state, Charles Bennett of IBM proposed the possibility for quantum teleportation, using entanglement as a core quantum information resource [13]. Zeilinger realized that his experimental set-up could perform an experimental demonstration of the effect, and in a rapid re-tooling of the experimental apparatus [14], the Zeilinger group was the first to demonstrate quantum teleportation that satisfied the conditions of the Bennett teleportation proposal [15]. An Italian-UK collaboration also made an early demonstration of a related form of teleportation in a paper that was submitted first, but published after Zeilinger’s, due to delays in review [16]. But teleportation was just one of a widening array of quantum applications for entanglement that was pursued by the Zeilinger group over the succeeding 30 years [17], including entanglement swapping, quantum repeaters, and entanglement-based quantum cryptography. Perhaps most striking, he has worked on projects at astronomical observatories that entangle photons coming from cosmic sources.\n\nBy David D.

Perhaps the two “weirdest” aspects of quantum physics are quantum entanglement and quantum tunneling. Entanglement allows a particle state to extend across wide expanses of space, while tunneling allows a particle to have negative kinetic energy. Neither of these effects has a classical analog.\n\nQuantum entanglement arose out of the Bohr-Einstein debates at the Solvay Conferences in the 1920’s and 30’s, and it was the subject of a recent Nobel Prize in Physics (2022). The quantum tunneling story is just as old, but it was recognized much earlier by the Nobel Prize in 1972 when it was awarded to Brian Josephson, Ivar Giaever and Leo Esaki—each of whom was a graduate student when they discovered their respective effects and two of whom got their big idea while attending a lecture class.\n\nAlways go to class, you never know what you might miss, and the payoff is sometimes BIG\n\nIvar Giaever\n\nOf the two effects, tunneling is the more common and the more useful in modern electronic devices (although entanglement is coming up fast with the advent of quantum information science). Here is a short history of quantum tunneling, told through a series of publications that advanced theory and experiments.\n\nDouble-Well Potential: Friedrich Hund (1927)\n\nThe first analysis of quantum tunneling was performed by Friedrich Hund (1896 – 1997), a German physicist who studied early in his career with Born in Göttingen and Bohr in Copenhagen. He published a series of papers in 1927 in Zeitschrift für Physik [1] that solved the newly-proposed Schrödinger equation for the case of the double well potential. He was particularly interested in the formation of symmetric and anti-symmetric states of the double well that contributed to the binding energy of atoms in molecules. He derived the first tunneling-frequency expression for a quantum superposition of the symmetric and anti-symmetric states\n\nwhere f is the coherent oscillation frequency, V is the height of the potential and hν is the quantum energy of the isolated states when the atoms are far apart. The exponential dependence on the potential height V made the tunnel effect extremely sensitive to the details of the tunnel barrier.\n\nElectron Emission: Lothar Nordheim and Ralph Fowler (1927 – 1928)\n\nThe first to consider quantum tunneling from a bound state to a continuum state was Lothar Nordheim (1899 – 1985), a German physicist who studied under David Hilbert and Max Born at Göttingen and worked with John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner and later with Hans Bethe. In 1927 he solved the problem of a particle in a well that is separated from continuum states by a thin finite barrier [2]. Using the new Schrödinger theory, he found transmission coefficients that were finite valued, caused by quantum tunneling of the particle through the barrier. Nordheim’s use of square potential wells and barriers are now, literally, textbook examples that every student of quantum mechanics solves. (For a quantum simulation of wavefunction tunneling through a square barrier see the companion Quantum Tunneling YouTube video.) Nordheim later escaped the growing nationalism and anti-semitism in Germany in the mid 1930’s to become a visiting professor of physics at Purdue University in the United States, moving to a permanent position at Duke University.\n\nOne of the giants of mathematical physics in the UK from the 1920s through the 1930’s was Ralph Fowler (1889 – 1944). Three of his doctoral students went on to win Nobel Prizes (Chandrasekhar, Dirac and Mott) and others came close (Bhabha, Hartree, Lennard-Jones). In 1928 Fowler worked with Nordheim on a more realistic version of Nordheim’s surface electron tunneling that could explain thermionic emission of electrons from metals under strong electric fields. The electric field modified Nordheim’s square potential barrier into a triangular barrier (which they treated using WKB theory) to obtain the tunneling rate [3]. This type of tunnel effect is now known as Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.\n\nNuclear Alpha Decay: George Gamow (1928)\n\nGeorge Gamov (1904 – 1968) is one of the icons of mid-twentieth-century physics. He was a substantial physicist who also had a solid sense of humor that allowed him to achieve a level of cultural popularity shared by a few of the larger-than-life physicists of his time, like Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking. His popular books included One Two Three … Infinity as well as a favorite series of books under the rubric of Mr. Tompkins (Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland and Mr. Tompkins Explores the Atom, among others). He also wrote a history of the early years of quantum theory (Thirty Years that Shook Physics).\n\nIn 1928 Gamow was in Göttingen (the Mecca of early quantum theory) with Max Born when he realized that the radioactive decay of Uranium by alpha decay might be explained by quantum tunneling. It was known that nucleons were bound together by some unknown force in what would be an effective binding potential, but that charged alpha particles would also feel a strong electrostatic repulsive potential from a nucleus. Gamow combined these two potentials to create a potential landscape that was qualitatively similar to Nordheim’s original system of 1927, but with a potential barrier that was neither square nor triangular (like the Fowler-Nordheim situation).\n\nGamow was able to make an accurate approximation that allowed him to express the decay rate in terms of an exponential term\n\nwhere Zα is the atomic charge of the alpha particle, Z is the nuclear charge of the Uranium decay product and v is the speed of the alpha particle detected in external measurements [4].\n\nThe very next day after Gamow submitted his paper, Ronald Gurney and Edward Condon of Princeton University submitted a paper [5] that solved the same problem using virtually the same approach … except missing Gamow’s surprisingly concise analytic expression for the decay rate.\n\nMolecular Tunneling: George Uhlenbeck (1932)\n\nBecause tunneling rates depend inversely on the mass of the particle tunneling through the barrier, electrons are more likely to tunnel through potential barriers than atoms. However, hydrogen is a particularly small atom and is therefore the most amenable to experiencing tunneling.\n\nThe first example of atom tunneling is associated with hydrogen in the ammonia molecule NH3. The molecule has a pyramidal structure with the Nitrogen hovering above the plane defined by the three hydrogens. However, an equivalent configuration has the Nitrogen hanging below the hydrogen plane. The energies of these two configurations are the same, but the Nitrogen must tunnel from one side of the hydrogen plane to the other through a barrier. The presence of light-weight hydrogen that can “move out of the way” for the nitrogen makes this barrier very small (infrared energies). When the ammonia is excited into its first vibrational excited state, the molecular wavefunction tunnels through the barrier, splitting the excited level by an energy associated with a wavelength of 1.2 cm which is in the microwave. This tunnel splitting was the first microwave transition observed in spectroscopy and is used in ammonia masers.\n\nOne of the earliest papers [6] written on the tunneling of nitrogen in ammonia was published by George Uhlenbeck in 1932. George Uhlenbeck (1900 – 1988) was a Dutch-American theoretical physicist. He played a critical role, with Samuel Goudsmit, in establishing the spin of the electron in 1925. Both Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit were close associates of Paul Ehrenfest at Leiden in the Netherlands. Uhlenbeck is also famous for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which is a generalization of Einstein’s theory of Brownian motion that can treat active transport such as intracellular transport in living cells.\n\nSolid-State Electron Tunneling: Leo Esaki (1957)\n\nAlthough the tunneling of electrons in molecular bonds and in the field emission from metals had been established early in the century, direct use of electron tunneling in solid state devices had remained elusive until Leo Esaki (1925 – ) observed electron tunneling in heavily doped Germanium and Silicon semiconductors. Esaki joined an early precursor of Sony electronics in 1956 and was supported to obtain a PhD from the University of Tokyo. In 1957 he was working with heavily-doped p-n junction diodes and discovered a phenomenon known as negative differential resistance where the current through an electronic device actually decreases as the voltage increases.\n\nBecause the junction thickness was only about 100 atoms, or about 10 nanometers, he suspected and then proved that the electronic current was tunneling quantum mechanically through the junction. The negative differential resistance was caused by a decrease in available states to the tunneling current as the voltage increased.\n\nEsaki tunnel diodes were the fastest semiconductor devices of the time, and the negative differential resistance of the diode in an external circuit produced high-frequency oscillations. They were used in high-frequency communication systems. They were also radiation hard and hence ideal for the early communications satellites. Esaki was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics jointly with Ivar Giaever and Brian Josephson.\n\nSuperconducting Tunneling: Ivar Giaever (1960)\n\nIvar Giaever (1929 – ) is a Norwegian-American physicist who had just joined the GE research lab in Schenectady New York in 1958 when he read about Esaki’s tunneling experiments. He was enrolled at that time as a graduate student in physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) where he was taking a course in solid state physics and learning about superconductivity. Superconductivity is carried by pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs that spontaneously bind together with a binding energy that produced an “energy gap” in the electron energies of the metal, but no one had ever found a way to directly measure it. The Esaki experiment made him immediately think of the equivalent experiment in which Cooper pairs might tunnel between two superconductors (through a thin oxide layer) and yield a measurement of the energy gap. The idea actually came to him during the class lecture.\n\nThe experiments used a junction between aluminum and lead (Al—Al2O3—Pb). At first, the temperature of the system was adjusted so that Al remained a normal metal and Pb was superconducting, and Giaever observed a tunnel current with a threshold related to the gap in Pb. Then the temperature was lowered so that both Al and Pb were superconducting, and a peak in the tunnel current appeared at the voltage associated with the difference in the energy gaps (predicted by Harrison and Bardeen).\n\nThe Josephson Effect: Brian Josephson (1962)\n\nIn Giaever’s experiments, the external circuits had been designed to pick up “ordinary” tunnel currents in which individual electrons tunneled through the oxide rather than the Cooper pairs themselves. However, in 1962, Brian Josephson (1940 – ), a physics graduate student at Cambridge, was sitting in a lecture (just like Giaever) on solid state physics given by Phil Anderson (who was on sabbatical there from Bell Labs). During lecture he had the idea to calculate whether it was possible for the Cooper pairs themselves to tunnel through the oxide barrier. Building on theoretical work by Leo Falicov who was at the University of Chicago and later at Berkeley (years later I was lucky to have Leo as my PhD thesis advisor at Berkeley), Josephson found a surprising result that even when the voltage was zero, there would be a supercurrent that tunneled through the junction (now known as the DC Josephson Effect). Furthermore, once a voltage was applied, the supercurrent would oscillate (now known as the AC Josephson Effect). These were strange and non-intuitive results, so he showed Anderson his calculations to see what he thought. By this time Anderson had already been extremely impressed by Josephson (who would often come to the board after one of Anderson’s lectures to show where he had made a mistake). Anderson checked over the theory and agreed with Josephson’s conclusions. Bolstered by this reception, Josephson submitted the theoretical prediction for publication [9].\n\nAs soon as Anderson returned to Bell Labs after his sabbatical, he connected with John Rowell who was making tunnel junction experiments, and they revised the external circuit configuration to be most sensitive to the tunneling supercurrent, which they observed in short time and submitted a paper for publication. Since then, the Josephson Effect has become a standard element of ultra-sensitive magnetometers, measurement standards for charge and voltage, far-infrared detectors, and have been used to construct rudimentary qubits and quantum computers.\n\nBy David D.

It was born in 1905 when Einstein merged Planck’s blackbody quantum hypothesis with statistical mechanics and concluded that light itself must be quantized. No one believed him! Fast forward to today, and the photon is a modern workhorse of modern quantum technology. Quantum encryption and communication are performed almost exclusively with photons, and many prototype quantum computers are optics based. Quantum optics also underpins atomic and molecular optics (AMO), which is one of the hottest and most rapidly advancing frontiers of physics today.\n\nOnly after the availability of “quantum” light sources … could photon numbers be manipulated at will, launching the modern era of quantum optics.\n\nThis blog tells the story of the early days of the photon and of quantum optics. It begins with Einstein in 1905 and ends with the demonstration of photon anti-bunching that was the first fundamentally quantum optical phenomenon observed seventy years later in 1977. Across that stretch of time, the photon went from a nascent idea in Einstein’s fertile brain to the most thoroughly investigated quantum particle in the realm of physics.\n\nThe Photon: Albert Einstein (1905)\n\nWhen Planck presented his quantum hypothesis in 1900 to the German Physical Society [1], his model of black body radiation retained all its classical properties but one—the quantized interaction of light with matter. He did not think yet in terms of quanta, only in terms of steps in a continuous interaction.\n\nThe quantum break came from Einstein when he published his 1905 paper proposing the existence of the photon—an actual quantum of light that carried with it energy and momentum [2]. His reasoning was simple and iron-clad, resting on Planck’s own blackbody relation that Einstein combined with simple reasoning from statistical mechanics. He was led inexorably to the existence of the photon. Unfortunately, almost no one believed him (see my blog on Einstein and Planck).\n\nThis was before wave-particle duality in quantum thinking, so the notion that light—so clearly a wave phenomenon—could be a particle was unthinkable. It had taken half of the 19th century to rid physics of Newton’s corpuscules and emmisionist theories of light, so to bring it back at the beginning of the 20th century seemed like a great blunder. However, Einstein persisted.\n\nIn 1909 he published a paper on the fluctuation properties of light [3] in which he proposed that the fluctuations observed in light intensity had two contributions: one from the discreteness of the photons (what we call “shot noise” today) and one from the fluctuations in the wave properties. Einstein was proposing that both particle and wave properties contributed to intensity fluctuations, exhibiting simultaneous particle-like and wave-like properties. This was one of the first expressions of wave-particle duality in modern physics.\n\nIn 1916 and 1917 Einstein took another bold step and proposed the existence of stimulated emission [4]. Once again, his arguments were based on simple physics—this time the principle of detailed balance—and he was led to the audacious conclusion that one photon can stimulated the emission of another. This would become the basis of the laser forty-five years later.\n\nWhile Einstein was confident in the reality of the photon, others sincerely doubted its existence. Robert Milliken (1868 – 1953) decided to put Einstein’s theory of photoelectron emission to the most stringent test ever performed. In 1915 he painstakingly acquired the definitive dataset with the goal to refute Einstein’s hypothesis, only to confirm it in spectacular fashion [5]. Partly based on Milliken’s confirmation of Einstein’s theory of the photon, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\n\nFrom that point onward, the physical existence of the photon was accepted and was incorporated routinely into other physical theories. Compton used the energy and the momentum of the photon in 1922 to predict and measure Compton scattering of x-rays off of electrons [6]. The photon was given its modern name by Gilbert Lewis in 1926 [7].\n\nSingle-Photon Interference: Geoffry Taylor (1909)\n\nIf a light beam is made up of a group of individual light quanta, then in the limit of very dim light, there should just be one photon passing through an optical system at a time. Therefore, to do optical experiments on single photons, one just needs to reach the ultimate dim limit. As simple and clear as this argument sounds, it has problems that only were sorted out after the Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiments in the 1950’s and the controversy they launched (see below). However, in 1909, this thinking seemed like a clear approach for looking for deviations in optical processes in the single-photon limit.\n\nIn 1909, Geoffry Ingram Taylor (1886 – 1975) was an undergraduate student at Cambridge University and performed a low-intensity Young’s double-slit experiment (encouraged by J. J. Thomson). At that time the idea of Einstein’s photon was only 4 years old, and Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom was still a year away. But Thomson believed that if photons were real, then their existence could possibly show up as deviations in experiments involving single photons. Young’s double-slit experiment is the classic demonstration of the classical wave nature of light, so performing it under conditions when (on average) only a single photon was in transit between a light source and a photographic plate seemed like the best place to look.\n\nThe experiment was performed by finding an optimum exposure of photographic plates in a double slit experiment, then reducing the flux while increasing the exposure time, until the single-photon limit was achieved while retaining the same net exposure of the photographic plate. Under the lowest intensity, when only a single photon was in transit at a time (on average), Taylor performed the exposure for three months. To his disappointment, when he developed the film, there was no significant difference between high intensity and low intensity interference fringes [8]. If photons existed, then their quantized nature was not showing up in the low-intensity interference experiment.\n\nThe reason that there is no single-photon-limit deviation in the behavior of the Young double-slit experiment is because Young’s experiment only measures first-order coherence properties. The average over many single-photon detection events is described equally well either by classical waves or by quantum mechanics. Quantized effects in the Young experiment could only appear in fluctuations in the arrivals of photons, but in Taylor’s day there was no way to detect the arrival of single photons.\n\nQuantum Theory of Radiation : Paul Dirac (1927)\n\nAfter Paul Dirac (1902 – 1984) was awarded his doctorate from Cambridge in 1926, he received a stipend that sent him to work with Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962) in Copenhagen. His attention focused on the electromagnetic field and how it interacted with the quantized states of atoms. Although the electromagnetic field was the classical field of light, it was also the quantum field of Einstein’s photon, and he wondered how the quantized harmonic oscillators of the electromagnetic field could be generated by quantum wavefunctions acting as operators. He decided that, to generate a photon, the wavefunction must operate on a state that had no photons—the ground state of the electromagnetic field known as the vacuum state.\n\nDirac put these thoughts into their appropriate mathematical form and began work on two manuscripts. The first manuscript contained the theoretical details of the non-commuting electromagnetic field operators. He called the process of generating photons out of the vacuum “second quantization”. In second quantization, the classical field of electromagnetism is converted to an operator that generates quanta of the associated quantum field out of the vacuum (and also annihilates photons back into the vacuum). The creation operators can be applied again and again to build up an N-photon state containing N photons that obey Bose-Einstein statistics, as they must, as required by their integer spin, and agreeing with Planck’s blackbody radiation.\n\nDirac then showed how an interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field with quantized energy levels involved the annihilation and creation of photons as they promoted electrons to higher atomic energy levels, or demoted them through stimulated emission. Very significantly, Dirac’s new theory explained the spontaneous emission of light from an excited electron level as a direct physical process that creates a photon carrying away the energy as the electron falls to a lower energy level. Spontaneous emission had been explained first by Einstein more than ten years earlier when he derived the famous A and B coefficients [4], but the physical mechanism for these processes was inferred rather than derived. Dirac, in late 1926, had produced the first direct theory of photon exchange with matter [9].\n\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) and Bohr (1935)\n\nThe famous dialog between Einstein and Bohr at the Solvay Conferences culminated in the now famous “EPR” paradox of 1935 when Einstein published (together with B. Podolsky and N. Rosen) a paper that contained a particularly simple and cunning thought experiment. In this paper, not only was quantum mechanics under attack, but so was the concept of reality itself, as reflected in the paper’s title “Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?” [10].\n\nEinstein considered an experiment on two quantum particles that had become “entangled” (meaning they interacted) at some time in the past, and then had flown off in opposite directions. By the time their properties are measured, the two particles are widely separated. Two observers each make measurements of certain properties of the particles. For instance, the first observer could choose to measure either the position or the momentum of one particle. The other observer likewise can choose to make either measurement on the second particle. Each measurement is made with perfect accuracy. The two observers then travel back to meet and compare their measurements. When the two experimentalists compare their data, they find perfect agreement in their values every time that they had chosen (unbeknownst to each other) to make the same measurement. This agreement occurred either when they both chose to measure position or both chose to measure momentum.\n\nIt would seem that the state of the particle prior to the second measurement was completely defined by the results of the first measurement. In other words, the state of the second particle is set into a definite state (using quantum-mechanical jargon, the state is said to “collapse”) the instant that the first measurement is made. This implies that there is instantaneous action at a distance −− violating everything that Einstein believed about reality (and violating the law that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light). He therefore had no choice but to consider this conclusion of instantaneous action to be false. Therefore quantum mechanics could not be a complete theory of physical reality −− some deeper theory, yet undiscovered, was needed to resolve the paradox.\n\nBohr, on the other hand, did not hold “reality” so sacred. In his rebuttal to the EPR paper, which he published six months later under the identical title [11], he rejected Einstein’s criterion for reality. He had no problem with the two observers making the same measurements and finding identical answers. Although one measurement may affect the conditions of the second despite their great distance, no information could be transmitted by this dual measurement process, and hence there was no violation of causality. Bohr’s mind-boggling viewpoint was that reality was nonlocal, meaning that in the quantum world the measurement at one location does influence what is measured somewhere else, even at great distance. Einstein, on the other hand, could not accept a nonlocal reality.\n\nThe Intensity Interferometer: Hanbury Brown and Twiss (1956)\n\nOptical physics was surprisingly dormant from the 1930’s through the 1940’s. Most of the research during this time was either on physical optics, like lenses and imaging systems, or on spectroscopy, which was more interested in the physical properties of the materials than in light itself. This hiatus from the photon was about to change dramatically, not driven by physicists, but driven by astronomers.\n\nThe development of radar technology during World War II enabled the new field of radio astronomy both with high-tech receivers and with a large cohort of scientists and engineers trained in radio technology. In the late 1940’s and early 1950’s radio astronomy was starting to work with long baselines to better resolve radio sources in the sky using interferometery. The first attempts used coherent references between two separated receivers to provide a common mixing signal to perform field-based detection. However, the stability of the reference was limiting, especially for longer baselines.\n\nIn 1950, a doctoral student in the radio astronomy department of the University of Manchester, R. Hanbury Brown, was given the task to design baselines that could work at longer distances to resolve smaller radio sources. After struggling with the technical difficulties of providing a coherent “local” oscillator for distant receivers, Hanbury Brown had a sudden epiphany one evening. Instead of trying to reference the field of one receiver to the field of another, what if, instead, one were to reference the intensity of one receiver to the intensity of the other, specifically correlating the noise on the intensity? To measure intensity requires no local oscillator or reference field. The size of an astronomical source would then show up in how well the intensity fluctuations correlated with each other as the dist"
