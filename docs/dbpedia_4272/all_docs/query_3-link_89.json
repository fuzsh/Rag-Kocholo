        "text": "This dissertation examines the emergence in the early nineteenth century at the Georg-August Universität of a theory describing the earth’s magnetic field. For its creator, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and his contemporaries, the theory offered an organizational model—a structure for the distribution of magnetic intensity over the earth’s surface. The dissertation argues that the structural quality of the theory was the signal feature of scientific work, or Wissenschaft, at this time. The first chapter places the Georg-August University’s founding in the context of changes in university education, and of developments in philosophical and religious discourses about truth. The second chapter treats the development of a particular institutional identity, the empirical “Göttinger Verstand.” These developments are contrasted with the negative reception of romanticism at Göttingen at the beginning of the nineteenth century. A third chapter explores the ideas of three philosophers—Immanuel Kant, Jakob Fries, and Friedrich Bouterwek—who represent a genealogy of structure as critical to scientific knowledge. Kant provided an articulation of concepts crucial to Fries’s and Bouterwek’s work, which constituted a rejection of Naturphilosophie and argued for structured knowledge as a cure for idealism. In the next chapter, I focus on Gauss’s theory of earth magnetism, compares Gauss’s theory to that produced by the romantic scientist Christopher Hansteen in 1819. Against Hansteen’s definition of magnetic poles, which relied on indeterminate measurements of total intensity, Gauss’s definition involved no such ambiguity, utilizing mathematics which allowed Gauss to avoid considerations about causes and material constitution of the earth’s magnetic field. This formalism allowed Gauss to avoid Hansten’s tabletop-based model, inspired by Naturphilosophie, of the earth’s magnetic field. A subsequent chapter places Gauss’s use of this formalism in the context other contemporary views of structure. Privileging structured knowledge implied that experimental truth was a question of processes used to elicit it. Overall this dissertation aims to show views of the nature of scientific knowledge itself intersected with anxieties over truth and certainty, and with the nature of practices involved in producing not only scientific knowledge, but also scientists themselves."
