Morgan1s translation bibliography as a dissertation j was first brought to rny attention by Dr. Hildegard Platzer ! Brownfield, formerly of the University of Southern California , | the idea immediately caught and held my interest. Shortly j 1 thereafter, Dr. Harold von Hofe advised that Dr. Morgan be ! made aware of my intentions, since that field really was the; latter's domain and therefore it was only proper to ask his I | permission. This particular advice turned out to be of j inestimable value, serving as the basis for Dr. Morgan's t full cooperation and thus preserving the validity of my \\ research. Had he been unaware of my work, the publication i of his second supplement would have superseded and thus madej I this dissertation superfluous. I | Not knowing Dr. Morgan personally, I somewhat j hesitantly wrote, rather expecting him to object to my - i \"intrusion.\" Quite to my surprise, he not only welcomed j my interest, but offered to restrict his new supplement (a work then already in the process of completion and j i intended to cover the period to 1960) to editions published j i prior to 1956, thus allowing me to prepare the ensuing five-year period through 1960. i i Somewhat later Dr. Morgan again demonstrated his thoughtfulness by offering and subsequently sending all hi previously collected post-1955 bibliographical entries. It was this kind g,ift that formed the nucleus for this dissertation and thus greatly aided in its successful completion. -Without this help the task would have been far more difficult. I regret that Dr. Morgan’s death in February of this year prevents me from conveying my gratitude to him. I would, however, like to express my appreciation to both Dr. Brownfield and Dr. von Hofe for their contributions, a well as to my advisor, Dr. John Spalek, whose guidance has been greatly appreciated.

Since : j translations are both a cause as well as a result of such j interchange, sometimes providing the only bridge available j to those who either desire or need to span the cultural and j ] linguistic gap, a bibliography of translations should be a j worthwhile contribution toward interrelating cultures and I furthering intercultural exchange.^ j The present compilation is a further extension of the j pioneering work A Critical Bibliography of German Litera­ ture in English Translation. 1481-1927. long the only work j j of its kind, at least in the field of German/ English j That this interchange has caused more than one unexpected interpretation is, I am certain, no surprise. Perhaps the best example in the literary field is that resulting from the choice of works translated in the cases j of Goethe and Schiller, causing the former to be known in j the English-speaking world as German's great dramatist j (FaustJ and the latter as its great author of poetry (Die j Glocke and numerous other poems, many of which have been ! set to music). That the works of these same two authors are regarded as purely romantic is also greatly the result of translation. The reversed equivalent of this situation is exemplified in the unique impact of Shakespeare upon the German Storm and Stress authors, including Goethe and Schiller, due to the prose translation of his works by Wieland. It might be mentioned that this original impres­ sion was later altered by the Schlegel translation in verse. 9 translation. * \" Through the recent publication cf two j \\ | additional supplements since the inception of this disserta-; ; i ition, the complete coverage of German literature for the 3 I period between 1481 and 1960 is assured. j Although challenges are a natural part of any dissertation, the obstacles met in compiling this bibliog- | raphy were, I believe, somewhat unique in both degree and I kind. I had originally assumed that the many hours of scanning would pose the greatest problem. However, a much I greater one was the resolving, or at least the correlating, of innumerable discrepancies between sources, trying to j i ■create, an intelligible method of recording such discrepancies, j ! 1 developing a research approach for each of the varied sourcej ! j formats, and especially the determining of more or less j satisfactory coverage limits, a question referred to by j / i Dr. B. Q. Morgan as \"never satisfactorily answered.\" ! However, to my surprise, by far the greatest of all these ! was the seemingly simple cask of just distin'guishing j between the bona fide translation and the apparent or . - _ ■ \"Originally compiled by Dr, B.

Since all such items either had to be included, j at least to begin with, or disproved as scanning progressed, the problem arose at every turn, often in conjunction with j that of scope. ! Among other things, these problems and some of the pertinent as well as sometimes exceedingly intriguing details j involved in facing and occasionally solving them will serve as the basis for the following pages of this introduction. j Sources and Format As research sources, three main works were originally j selected: (1) the Library of Congress Catalog, herein j I referred to as LG: (2) the UNESCO publication. Index j ' | Translationum. referred to as IT; and (3) the catalog of i the British Museum. Since the latter work was not available! i j to me for the 1956-60 period, I have drawn from another j source which is based on the holdings of the British Museum as well as several other holdings in that country, the * 5 I British National Bibliography.- This source has been ! abbreviated in the present bibliographical listing as B56 ! ■ i for the edition covering the 1956 publications, and so on toj ; I | B61; for textual reference \"BNB\" will also be used. The specific LC designations derive from the two i I five-year cumulative catalogs covering the periods 1953- i : --------------------------------------- j C i Published annually in London by the Council of the j British National Bibliography, Ltd. j 1957 and 1958-1962, with resultant entries of LC57 or LC62. j i To the IT abbreviation is added the particular number of j i the volume, ranging from 1956 (IT9) to 1962 (IT14). Each of these abbreviations has been added at the end of every entry to indicate the origin of the material. j The format of the three selected sources, each ! * i i offering desirable as well as undesirable elements, j j i suggested various possible adaptations as format for this j listing. After several forms were tried and discarded, two j alternate methods were selected. The first one, a double- j j columned format of blocks of information similar to that j | of the LC, was both appealing to the eye, due to the | i i resultant symmetry, and was easily read. Its drawback lay j in the difficulty of maintaining the block form, due to j varying amounts of linear content, without wasting space. Whenever the blocks were broken to prevent this waste, the value of the block format decreased. j | The second format used a multi-columned line spread j across the wide part of the page in linear sequence. Although it lent itself very well to scanning, it wasted even more space than the first format and was thus | discarded, since the scanning advantage did not make up for j the inefficient use of space. The final format selected represents a further adaptation of the second. The space-wasting columns have been replaced by a more condensed data sequence, which 5 ! Isti.ll clearly conveys the information yet conserves space. ! r |Since the purpose of the format is a dual one, that of j ! ! saving as much space as possible while still rendering the j : j content readable and if possible aesthetically appealing, j i { the deep indentations originally used by Dr. Morgan have been reduced to a mere two spaces. Incidentally, this is j : i more or less the format used in the most recent supplements ! by Dr. Morgan himself, and has few disadvantages if any. j Like the overall external format, the internal j i sequence of data for the individual items has also undergone various changes, the major one being the use of the English title rather than that of the German work as the basis for ! secondary alphabetizing when several works appear under the | same author. Actually, there would be a greater advantage in using the German title since it would readily effect a j natural grouping of works translated from the same German I original, thus their relationship would, be clear. Because | i such translations frequently are given dissimilar titles, | ; i especially when published in different countries, catalog­ ing by English title often prevents this advantageous grouping and tends instead to obscure relationships. j ] Nevertheless, faced with the lack of many German titles, I j i found it necessary to use those in English instead. Where j known, the German title now appears in parentheses as the j i third element and is followed by the translator or the j . 1 i 6 !designation \"Tr. Anon.\" Data pertaining to the edition, editor or illustrator, and the normal bibliographical facts of publication follow. Since pagination and size play an important part in determining whether a given edition represents a separate translation or the same one reissued, that information is also recorded, and the entry completed with the source designations. Whenever possible, i.e., when all the particulars of ;both agree, British and American editions of the same translation, although listed separately in the original sources, are combined into a single entry, since they represent only one translation. In cases where minor discrepancies in size or pagination exist, the figures derived from, the BNB are enclosed in parentheses, as are any sizes obtained from that source unless corroborated by the LC. Major divergencies, especially those from the IT, are listed as separate entries, since they represent either different translations or serious errors. In either case a separate listing is justified. In order to conserve space in the internal format, three adaptations have been incorporated: (1) for trans­ lations having several different editions, full information is given only in the initial entry, subsequent entries being introduced by the word \"same\" and beginning with the data which deviate from the foregoing entry; (2) commonly * \\ 1 iknown publisher names are shortened to the (first) surname; j j and (3) the names London, New York, and New Jersey are i rendered simply as L, NY, and NJ, for the sake of brevity, I I ! as they appear so frequently. j It should also be noted that multiple editions of a single work are presented in their order of publication, ; I when known. Unless the entry sequence is already established! i i by the source work, two or more editions published the same ! i year are arbitrarily listed by place of publication as follows: (1) a Gentian-speaking area, (2) Great Britain, j (3) United States, and (4) other. I Initial General Research i The initial pbase of research was begun by listing all! entries found under the German literature headings in the LCj f 1 title catalog, since this seemed the logical place to begin j acquiring belles-lettres material, which was my intent. | i Because I had used the Morgan bibliography only as a belles- lettres reference work, my interpretation of the term \"litera- I mre\" as used by Dr. Morgan, was overly narrow. I had also i : ! thought that most German belles-lettres authors were being j i translated and published almost as soon as the original was ! j on the market. These two misconceptions led me to expect a plethora of translations of literature (in the restricted sense of the term). When the actual yield turned out to be much smaller than had been anticipated, I first assumed it 8 was due to my inexperienced approach. Only later did it become clear that my premise was wrong and that relatively few translations of belles-lettres authors are undertaken. Because presuming to know all German authors, especially the current ones, would have been even more naive, I was at that time unable to scan the LC author list j on an item to item basis with any real hope of success. j i Even using the Morgan bibliography would have produced only a partial listing of possible authors, as many new authors j have begun publishing since that work was first compiled. j Faced with this problem, I turned to the IT, thinking j ! ! that it would provide the solution to my dilemma by present-i j ing a broader coverage of countries and therefore both the desired translation quantity and the needed modernized author list. With this in mind, I began researching the IT i I by thoroughly covering the literature section under each country heading. Even this produced a disappointing amount of applicable translation entries. However, in spite of the : restricted quantity produced, turning to the IT at this particular time was a fortuitous decision for my circum­ stances because, for the novice, this type of research is, at the outset, a tedious process even at best, and can be carried on only for short periods before fatigue sets in. Although the IT format did not completely alleviate this difficulty, it did effect a decrease by lessening the amount lof reading necessary before an appropriate item was located.: i i The IT is also far less complicated to deal with since it j contains only translations. Thus scanning was less prob­ lematic in this source than it would have been in the LC at this period in my preparation. j Because Dr. Morgan provided me with his previously j collected post-1955 bibliographical entries, I was able to j continue, equipped with a recent, valid source against which ■ to check my own research as it progressed, and a broader, more useful concept of the term \"literature\" as used by my j predecessor in his own research. Moreover, I had a concretej nucleus upon which to build. In scanning the voluminous LC,| I found this to be especially valuable since it provided me I with accurate checkpoints to insure that important materials| had not been missed. With it I could scan until a possible I I entry was located, then check in Dr. Morgan’s listing to seel if that work were recorded, or possibly any works preceding the newly found one. Thus the tedium inherent in scanning was greatly alleviated by having an attainable short-term j goal at all times. This provided a sense of progressive j accomplishment as well as relative security. A second coverage of IT9, the first volume involving 1956 publications, was now undertaken--this time covering all categories in all countries. Having been overly expec- Itant before, and thus restricting my search to an area which was too narrow, I now became overly thorough--a more pro- i 1 Iductive although time consuming shortcoming, if such it be ; ‘ I lat all. It was still possible to save some time because of | ; i : i the asterisk affixed to all items not originating from the j ! i official language(s) of the country in which the translation; i is published. When scanning entries from those countries • not directly concerned with English or German, I needed to j direct my attention only to the asterisk and then note j t whether the particular entry also was derived from German. j ■ i Thus a quick, yet thorough coverage was attained. The j ; I result was a much greater efficiency and yield than before, j After the completion of the six IT volumes, my j attention was turned to the much more involved task of i scanning the 26 volume five-year catalog of the Library of ; Congress (LC57). In this case, materials published before i i 1956 were disregarded, thus greatly reducing the quantity I of items to be covered. As was already mentioned, having i I ithe Morgan research at hand also greatly lightened the j burden since it had been drawn in large part from that j catalog. The real problem came in trying to go beyond the j ; i i 11957 date because there was as yet no five-year series, j only the paper-bound volumes that are issued periodically, j each with its own alphabetical listing. Because of this j i difficulty, I decided that a letter by letter search cover- j ing the entire period through 1961 would be best, rather | ithan completing each volume. The D's had just been fully researched when the new five-year series of fifty volumes j was received by the library. This new complication meant, i of course, that it would be necessary for me to begin the ; i 195P-1960 period anew to make certain that any new entries, j added since the earlier periodical listings were compiled, j I would also be recovered. In addition it meant choosing between complete coveragej of that five-year span during the ensuing scanning, even j though the 1961 and 1962 publications were not needed at j present, or else partial coverage to fill the needs of the moment and a second scanning of those same fifty tomes. I chose the first, although there was a certain regrettable | i amount of time loss in being thorough the first time. In myj l opinion it far outweighed the awesome task of replowing already spaded ground. The time nlost\" in the year and a j half in the LCs was more than compensated for by the tedium j i avoided. There is also a certain sense of accomplishment ini \"completing\" an area. Necessary cross-checking more than j i assures reasonably thorough coverage without a forced rerun j being planned in advance. ■ It might be added here in retrospect that the sense ! ! of accomplishment could have been much greater had the BNB ! ( been the second source rather than the third, as it turned i | out to be. Since that work lists alphabetically under each j individual category, it prevents or at least greatly ! 12 i |encumbers an alphabetical recovery. By leaving this source j until last, I prevented myself from, finishing any given j i section until all the research was completed. Not only was j this frustrating in a sense, but it also added unnecessary j ' i indecision as well as error in the choice of both format and' ! content of reference cards produced during research and the j j format of the final bibliographical listing itself. On the other hand it must be said that the BNB research was accom­ plished with few other complications as I had gained some- j . i what mors skill and flexibility as a researcher, and most i of the problems had been solved by that time, due in part j i : ! to my previous contact with the BNB through cross-checkingc j At this point some clarification ought to be added j regarding an earlier statement concerning the paucity of I translation. Having been plagued by the problem of lack of quantity at the very outset of my research, and finding the impression growing ever stronger that the same meager percentage of translation initially found in the belles- lettres area of the German materials extended not only to i other areas within German but to all other languages as well, I felt obligated to make a somewhat deeper study of the problem to gain a more accurate basis for my conclusion. For this purpose materials were arbitrarily drawn from the i i LC. After various aspects of volumes forty-three and forty-seven were researched, several individual authors S 13 from other volumes were checked. The conclusion was apparent; less than 10 per cent of all German works listed have been translated (based on the entries of translations iunder those authors). Admittedly this rather minor percentage increased greatly in certain isolated cases such as that of Rudolf Sultmann or Berthold Brecht, who have many works in translation, in some cases several editions of a single work. However, the overall percentage remained very low due to the large number of untranslated authors. In volume forty-three, for example, the first 100 German authors were selected (pp. 1-38), and it was found that ninety-seven had no translations listed while the remaining three had seven translations among them. No attempt was made in this case to check on the total number of German listings involved, but it becomes clear that only 3 per cent of the authors in that random sampling had been translated. To discover the approximate amount of works translated, volume forty-seven was thoroughly scanned, revealing some 500 German works. Since dissertations are less often translated, they were not included in the survey. Of these 500 works only fifty had translations listed--exactly 10 per cent. Arno Wuest's translated dissertation may be cited as one of the few. A further broad sampling was made by checking on ; i ■listings under \"Schmidt” in the LC. Here no distinction j ,as to linguistic affiliation was made--only the assumption I i that most of them would be German authors. In this case j i sixty columns of listings were found to contain only j thirteen German to English translations, about one full j column in all. j The next sampling pertained to individual authors, again arbitrarily selected In the course of the research. j j This produced the following calculations, in which the first! I : i figure in each case pertains to the number of German works j : j listed for that author, the second to the amount of trans- ! i lations: Edith Stein, 2/2; Ludwig Anzengruber, 7/1; Albert j Steffen, 10/1; Edssard B. Schaper, 27/2; Ernst Barlach, 16/1 ; i Bettina Arnim, 7/0; Ruth Schaumann, 14/0. Goethe, of course,j has a far greater number of translations--Faust alone has | j six--but he has consistently been one of the most popular of! i 7 ' the German authors in English translation. ; Some years ago it was generally expected that the i newly opened field of machine translation would solve the problem of translation paucity, as well as other problems | associated with translation. In November of 1966 the \\ National Research Council, headed by John R. Pierce of Bell I ^In Morgan II, p. 14, we find: \"... Goethe and Schiller head the line, and Goethe so far outstrips the rest as almost to be in a class by himself.\" 15 ; Telephone Laboratories, Inc., reported on a special two- ! | !year study concerning the 19 million dollar, ten-year investment made by the National Science Foundation and i : | others interested in \"automatic language processing,\" as j i the process is called. The gist of the report was that j little help could be expected in the near future from ; mechanical sources to alleviate the problems in translation.! To put it in their words: \"To date there has been no I i ] satisfactory machine translation of scientific texts, and j \\ p | none is expected soon.\" i Surprisingly enough, even our logical expectations forj !at least a rapid if not accurate translation are destroyed j by this report, since it notes that the machines are pres- j \\ i ently 21 per cent slower than their human counterparts, as well as 29 per cent harder to understand. Thus little help j in solving the translation lack can be expected from mechanical translation, at least at present. i l | i Individualized Research Procedures Since each of the three sources uses a different basisj i for its cataloging system, the research procedure had to be ! individually adapted, according to the particular aspect of each work, which would either reveal the appropriate trans­ lation or at least permit non-applicable materials to be i ®From a Washington (UPI) statement circulated nationally, on or about November 25, 1966. 1 6 readily recognized and disregarded. In every case precau- j tionary measures had to be taken to compensate for possible j error, either on the part of the reference work or the researcher. Each approach also had to be developed as research progressed, since the best system for the particular publication could be worked out only after sufficient acquaintance with its peculiarities had been gained. After preliminary research revealed the special disposition employed by the IT, that of cataloging on the basis of the country in which a translation has been pub­ lished, research problems with countries not directly con­ cerned with German or English were basically eliminated by j 9 using the asterisk to quickly reveal any applicable material. 5 1 It may be of interest that Israel published many translated j German works, some in English, (i.e., 5 for 1956-1960, then ! » ! 5 in 1961 alone). The listings of those countries vitally i concerned with the two languages were thoroughly checked, j namely Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Switzerland, and the United States, j To be sure the great majority of materials came from j j publishers in Great Britain and the United States, but the i i occasional contributions from other countries, sometimes j listed only under these sources, made it necessary, for the ; sake of thoroughness, to carefully research them as well. j ^Discussed on p. 9 of this introduction. 1 7 \\ j I The special feature in the IT, besides the asterisk, !was the source-language designation at or near the end of : i ;each entry, followed by the title of the work in the origina]| i language. By scanning the whole entry quickly, and paying j particular attention to this part of the entry, materials i were readily retrieved and recorded on three by five cards, j I Entries lacking both of these check-points were reread for j other possible clues such as an author with a seemingly German name. When it seemed they might be German, they were recorded, their lack of language designation being carefully noted. The normal alphabetical listing of the LC did not ipermit the use of national areas as had the IT. Because of this, the vast coverage and rather small print, the pro­ cedure for the LG had to be based more on eliminating | linguistically impossible items and carefully checking all j features of those remaining. Since there were far fewer J j translations than originals, this was very time-consuming | even at best. Nonetheless, at least some time was saved by concentrating only on works with German or English titles.. Here as before, the author name that looked German, the place of publication (when in a German-speaking area), the word \"translation\" and the appended information had to I | be checked in order to be relatively sure of not overlooking pertinent items. 18 It might be mentioned that the checking of author j 'name later came to be done more out of curiosity than real verification of anything about the translation; this was ; I due to the surprising amount of apparently, sometimes I obviously, non-German authors who nonetheless had written 10 ! German works. Although these were frequently unpublished ; dissertations which for the present at least were still ! untranslated, they still required investigation. It was i only through such persistent checking that Arno Wuest's 11 ! translated dissertation was discovered. j Whenever German titles were found listed, extra care j had to be exercised in those areas in order to pick up i possible \"hidden\" translations, i.e., those English trans- j lations not identified as such by the aforementioned clues. j The rechecking resulting from this approach uncovered a j number of works and produced the listings of rather unusual j author/language combinations appended to this introduction, pages 47-52. I Perhaps the most unusual feature of LC scanning was | I the need to alternate scanning direction--down the first j 1 column and up the next. This became necessary or at least | ; j I advantageous because of the great bulk of non-eligible items,| ----------------------------------------------------------------- i I 10 1 J - The reader is referred to the special listing of such authors at the end of this introduction. ^Previous reference to this author is made in foot­ note 6, p. 13. I the lack of any context, and the resultant monotony. i Alternating the scanning direction created the desired j t illusion of change. j , i : j As eligible items were recognized they were recorded j either on the three by five cards or on a list, depending ! i on whether they were repeat items, i.e., those previously j I carded, or new ones. INfew acquisitions were listed on sheets] by recording the page, column designation (a, b, c), author,! j and partial title, followed by place of publication and ! i year. Any other important information such as the German j title listed with another entry was appended to this. Cards were later typed from these lists, producing neat, readable references. In contrast to both of the foregoing sources, the BNB ; ] categorizes according to the content of each work and then j j alphabetizes within each resultant area, thus greatly ! hampering, if not preventing any alphabetically oriented ! j recovery of materials. Because of this system, the attempt I : ' I at cross-checking for carded translations already gleaned ] I from the other sources failed. This was partially due to j ] the unwieldiness of the mass of cards produced by this time,j ,only a part of which could be conveniently carried to the ' j library at one time. Since any few pages of items in the BNB spanned the entire alphabet, a portion of the carded materials was always insufficient. On the other hand, the 2 0 j prospect of scanning each individual entry 26 times, once j during the search for each letter, was absurd. Thus it was that only a sheet listing was made for all BNB entries although many had already been recorded on cards during I cross-referencing. From this, cards were once more typed, i j resulting in a second group of neatly prepared references, I | especially important in the case of the BNB because of j I numerous deviations from LC practices in the area of pagina-j tion and size measurement. By this is meant the apparent ! [ counting of both sides of sheets, whether bearing printing or not, and usage of the one-half centimeter. BNB editors obviously intend these as steps toward greater accuracy, j i which they well may be in the final analysis, but because j the practice causes inevitable deviations between BNB data ! and that listed in other sources, it was an additional encumberance for me, forcing a choice between the dissimilar! i figures--options for which I had no valid basis--or the | inclusion of both. The latter choice seemed to be the more judicious, although it necessitated a further adapta- | tion (that of placing the BNB data in parentheses except when it paralleled that fpund in the LC), in order to maintain clarity regarding data origins. It should be brought out here that, for the most part,; only the successful methods have been emphasized in the 'foregoing. The following are some of those that were 21 I ^discarded as either unfruitful or unnecessary: adapting j : t : t entries to a preconceived format rather than reproducing ' ; t ithem exactly; during research combining the British and the j ; i : ! American editions of a work regardless of disparities; and I attempting to be all-inclusive by listing every type of available data, such as size and publication details for the German originals, the month of publication for British editions, the initial date of issue for all reprints, and extensive locator lists for editions held by university libraries in the United States. Scope and Related Problems As mentioned earlier in this introduction, the con­ cept of scope varied greatly from that initially held, (belles-lettres only), to almost everything that could be j regarded as a proven translation from German to English. j Due to the time-consuming aspect of that \"proof\", as well as to general principles, several categories were dropped: | (1) government published tourist \"propaganda\" material such | as Facts About Germany and Facts About Austria, which are j frequently revised and which, conceivably, do not necessa­ rily represent translations; (2) reports of international meetings which have taken place in Europe (often the Germans speak in English, the Russians in German, and so on, without recourse to translation; (3) instruction pamphlets on \"how to operate...\" etc.; (4) most technical materials in 22 iscientific fields (although defining the term \"technical\" i nowadays becomes exceedingly difficult); and (5) most translations from German when a third language has been j the real origin. ! ; I This last area is by far the most problematic to work ! : i with since such translations are frequently listed simply j I as, \"translated from the German\", without indication of the j ! original language. Only when discovered can such works be I i : ! eliminated, and even then it is done more or less arbitra- i | rily, since a translation may (though it certainly shouldn't! i in most cases) have become an \"original\" by virtue of the license taken by the translator. Only a close comparison of! the two would reveal this, of course. An example of such \"creative\" work is the English translation of Harald ! Steinert's Goldsucher.... a work of 387 pages, 21 cm., j published in 1957. The so-called translated version, The Atom Rush, copyrighted in 1958, measures 183 pages and j 23 cm. Can it be possible that a two centimeter difference I i has absorbed all of those pages? Perhaps there has been, I on the other hand, an error in recording, and the original | j had only 187 pages; or the translation 383 pages. Only by comparing editions themselves would the actual facts be [ : \\ revealed that would warrant the result being regarded as an \"original\" work, This of course is only an example of {possible changes in translation that happened to be seen i and does not really represent a translation from a third I 23 | language, yet the problem itself still holds. As a more j I ■appropriate choice let us select Hugo Steinhaus1 work jMathematical Snapshots. translated from the German work ; i entitled Kaleidoskop der Mathematik. Actually the original j title is in Polish and is called Kaleidoskop matenatyczny. I But without the texts to compare, who can say to what degree the translator has translated and to what degree created? In such circumstances the real authorship of the work becomes questionable. A case in point is that of Arnim Tuulse whose work, Burgen des Abendlandes (Vienna, 1958) is listed by BNB as the original from which Castles of the Western World. ! published in 1952, was translated.^ LC states, however, i that the German version comes from the Swedish original, i Borgar i Vasterlandet. published in 1952 and translated into! j German by Gerhard Eimer. Who now is the \"German\" author, if indeed there be any? Had there been no such information j i in LC, this work would have been listed as a German work in ! i the present bibliography. Such examples make one wonder how! many more works belong to this category. A second difficulty arises when the attempt is made j to define the term \"German\". What makes a work a German j original?

Can he also be a \"Gernan\" author or must he remain with his own ethno-linguistic group? The acceptance of a C. F. Meyer, or more to the point, perhaps, a Chamisso as definitely German already sets the precedent for those who by thereafter devoting them- i selves to German, continue \"in the faith\" as it were. But what of those who are only \"visitors\", so to speak, and who use German for but one work or for merely a few? Even I beyond these questions, but closely allied to them nonethe- j less, is the group of German-language authors whose works ! have found their way into English translation indirectly. j I Such is the case with Rudolf G. Hegler's Crete and its Treasures, which is an English translation of a German original with French as the intervening step. Can this I still be listed as a translation from German? i ; I Even when an author's e7vigibility for inclusion is not' in dispute, it may happen that a seemingly obvious case of translation among his works turns out to be an English original instead. Perhaps the best example of such a circumstance is to be found in a work by Max Born and Emil Wolf, published in both London and New York, 1959, entitled j Principles of Optics. There is in existence a much earlier German work by the same writers bearing the title Optik: therefore the English edition seems to be a translation. Only the reading of the introduction by Max Born reveals that, due to the time lapse between the two editions and j } the vast changes in the field of optics, \"a translation was hardly appropriate; instead a substantially new book was prepared.\"^ A third problem still remains if and when the fore­ going are solyed: what percentage of a published work has to involve translation before the work is eligible for inclusion with full translations? Will the introduction suffice, or commentary?^ Are a few articles enough--or half? The previously mentioned Individual Psychology of j j Alfred Adler states: \"Nearly half of the selections were 18 ! translated by the editors.\" This, to be sure, proves that j it really was a translation, as was asked in problem two, j but is half enough? I certainly think so, and for this reason the work has been included in this bibliography. j A fourth problem in the interpretation of the term ! i \"technical\" confronts the researcher. Dr. Morgan mentions | j in his earliest edition that he had limited his collecting to \"essays, travel and description,, German history and j biography, history of German literature, history of Greece I _ “ - — - - — “ | ^ Principles of Optics.

Then, after having passed up a work on group theory, because it seemed too restricted for general interest, I was informed i by my ten^year old daughter that they were learning about 9 9 set theory in her grade-school class. 4 With that I realizedj t that I was simply not qualified as a judge of what the j \"average\" reader might find worthwhile, particularly with j j the amazing rate of change in our modern world. Who can | tell at this point what will be \"too restricted\" and what I \"average\" in a few years? Following this rather disillu- j sioning experience I decided to record all substantiated j translations to begin with, and to decide later what, if ^Morgan I, p. 10. ^Ojbid. 21Morgan ui, p# 7# 22The work referred to is P. Aleksandrov's An Intro­ duction to the Theory of Groups. which turned out to be from a Russian original although translated from Einftihrung I in die Gruppentheorie.__ ; ! any, should be excluded. Thus the fifth problem was brought about, since any­ thing acquired with great effort is not readily given up ;again. So it was with these hard-won gains. Only very reluctantly have I dropped items, thinking they might be tomorrow's \"group theory\", so to speak. The result has been a very large, somewhat unwieldy bibliography of quite heterogeneous character that both observes and at the same time exceeds Dr. Morgan's admonition of \"non-technical j works, in whatever field.\" At this point it occurs to me that a plausible solution to some of these problems might be found by later appending to this basic bibliography an additional one comprising third language sources for which German has served as \"mediator\". This would both provide the materialsj and yet segregate them properly. The same could be done forj technical translations. The first might form a particularly! | useful tool for the field of comparative literature. For j example, it would indicate how often German has served in this capacity. How many works have become known to the j English-speaking world only through the mediation of German?! t i Does any specific type of material dominate this area? j I l The second appended listing might serve as an \\ ! additional checklist for those source works that regularly : O Q jpublish bibliographies for technical fields. Since my only information about such sources has been gleaned from LC scanning and not direct contact, I have no idea how complete their listings are, therefore, I am not able to comment further on them at this time; and because the task | ! at hand must take precedence, both of these projects must be relegated to the future, when this dissertation is published. To return to the unanswered question of inclusion, let me give particulars by way of outline and summary. I have ! I included: (1) any work which has as its basis a German language work and has not gone through an intermediary language, this would include stories drawn from the Grimms j but not \"translated\" as such; (2) any English translation which has resulted directly from a German-language source | by an author of any ethnic background or linguistic group, (by the same token I have excluded those works written in English, by either former German nationals or by German j ! I citizens still living in Gerntan language areas, when it can j be demonstrated--usually by remarks in the preface— that no J Two might here be mentioned: (1) the United States Department of Commerce publication Technical Translations, superceding Translation Monthly published in Chicago by the John Crerar Library for the Special Libraries Association; ;(2) a work of scientific, technical and engineering trans­ lations, published by Morris D. Friedman, Inc., West Newton, Massachusetts. 30 i r t # I translation as such occurred;) (3) a work with any j ;amount of translation, save spot quotes, if demonstrably j ! i from a German original, since its possible worth to others j j is difficult for me to evaluate. j j As to the dates of inclusion, it might here be mentioned that works not dated but that have not previously ! s been carried in the LC have been recorded here since they | may not have been known to Dr. Morgan. Also, works with inconsistent dating have been listed if one of the datings fell in my period. For example, Wilhelm Andersen's j ! I Towards a Theology of Mission is listed in BNB as having j been published in October 1 9 55, which would cause its j exclusion. LC, however, lists that same London publication ; as 1956, so the work has been added. This discrepancy occurs because of a number of things, no doubt, one of them j being the reporting of a publication before it actually 25 appears on the market. i Major Problems j ! ! The minor physical problems of fatigue,brought on, at ! least in part, by the lack of context to entice the mind, i have already been sufficiently mentioned. The aggravation ! j caused by incessant need for correlation of discrepancies j now requires somewhat more detailed treatment here. Under 2^A number of works by Paul Tillich fall in this category i ^Morgan III, p. 13._________________ 31 |this category might be listed as the first element the BNB j ; j usage of one-half centimeter designations which naturally ; always vary from the LC size, sometimes by one and one-half j centimeters, The solution here was to include both since j I had no way of knowing who was right. Of more consequence ; was the IT practice of sometimes adding the Roman and the | Arabic numerals together, thus producing a page total which j O f L is at variance with all other sources. Since this is neither their standard (nor even standardized) practice as j far as 1 know, it creates a real problem for the biblio- ! graphical researcher who wants to know whether a given entry! represents a new translation or just a reprint. A further i difficulty would be encountered by any researcher attempt- j i ing to determine relative size variance between original | and translation. Should such a task be undertaken, the IT would frequently mislead rather than aid, and result in inaccurate conclusions. This would be especially true in j I the case of translations, since the introduction (recorded . j in Roman numerals) is often not a part of the original work | ! at all and therefore has no direct relationship to the size | of the text (in Arabic numerals). ! 1 A somewhat more serious practice of that same work is j I that of correcting previous errors of pagination, language ! source, title, etc., by entering the data in its corrected j ; i i ^6Cf. the Heinrich Wolfflin entry in LC62 (xvi, 237p.)i and that of IT9 (253p.). __________’ i ^ j ! ' 32 | form without any indication that the information is the ! i corrected version of a former error. When this is not { I i iknown, and to some extent afterward as well, severe researchj problems may be brought about, to say nothing of the sub- j sequent constant need to verify all ensuing IT data which ! greets the now-jaundiced eye of the researcher. As a case j in point, let us refer to a work by Tor Andrae, apparently j one of three German works he wrote, Mohammed. sein Leben j ! und sein Glaube. published in 1932. The translation, ! : | Mohammed, the Man and His Faith, was recovered from IT11 which gave the German title as Die Person Muhammeds in Lehre ? 7 und Glauben seiner Gemeinde. 1917.“ \" Further research 1 revealed the same translation title listed in IT13 as having! 28 i been translated from Mohammed, sein Leben und sein Glaube. No date was given. Because I was unaware of the correction j practice of the IT, it was necessary for me to do rather extensive research to uncover the truth, since a quick check of the Deutsches Bucherverzeichnis produced no works by Tor Andrae between 1910 and 1930. ! By checking the International Who’s Who of 1937, I ; found a listing of three works by Tor Andrae, the earliest 2^Item No. 7499. The LC published in 1958 lists this j work as the author’s inaugural dissertation at Uppsala. ! I j 28Item No. 9180. ! of which was Die Person M-- . . . . 1913. My conclusion j was that the second entry must be incorrect, though the i date still bothered me. The 1938 edition of that same i reference work listed four titles for Andrae, the first a 7 I i 1918 edition of Die Person M-- . . .. noted as having been published originally in 1913, and the last, Mohamed B i d His Life and Faith. 1935. Now I wasn't even sure the XT I I listing was a translation from German at all. This was j ! seemingly confirmed during LC scanning because all other J German works by Andrae were listed as translations from Swedish. This appeared far more reasonable because of the author's name. In checking the LC covering the 1917 period to see if such a German work might be listed there, I found a Spanish translation which had in turn been derived from the German, an indication in just the opposite direction. j j In addition, a 1936 edition of the English version was also j | listed, but the final piece of the puzzle was supplied by j locating the 1936 copy of the English translation in which { I f was written: \"This volume is a translation from the German j ] of Professor Tor Andrae*s Mohammed, sein Leben und sein | q A 1 Glaube . . . Gottingen, 1932.\" This, together with supporting proof gleaned by checking the 1931-1935 Deutsches l — 1 \" ■ i 29 This may be an error since the dissertation was accepted in 1917 as noted earlier. ^Mohammed. the Man and His Faith. (New York: Scribner's Sons , 1936), p. 5. _ _______________ i 34 1 M Bucherverzeichnis. finally solved the problem as to correct ! German title. Had the IT noted that their second entry was J ; i ia correction of the first, this added time expenditure could) i ihave been avoided. To be sure it is difficult to both j i Ireeord and correct all errors encountered in research; yet j j for an annual publication, clarified correction within its j own pages should pose no overwhelming problem. For example,; the editors could include the item number and volume of the i I i earlier incorrect listing in parentheses following the j regular item number. This would serve the dual purpose of j warning the researcher that a correction has been made as well as providing him with the reference number for easy comparison of the two entries. j In this dissertation the sources from which each item ! is derived are listed with every entry. Comparing sources j ! will reveal any divergencies, most of which involve spelling! 31 ! errors. When the author’s name has been misspelled, both ) spellings are listed; however, the erroneous form carries I a \"see\" reference rather than the full entry. I j An additional point should perhaps be brought out here; regarding the obvious importance of the editions themselves,! where available. In many cases, as in that just presented, | only the textual source can produce final clarification, to Heinz Schroter's Stalingrad is such an example. j )LC62 lists \"bis zur letzten Patrone\" as the continuation of j jthe title of the New York edition, but spells it j \". . . letzen. . .11 for the London publication.____ I say nothing of other information. Dr. Morgan mentions his j : I use of the translation collection being made at Pennsylvania ! State University by Professor Philip Allison Shelley. Although I have not yet had the opportunity to draw on that ! source, I do have great admiration and appreciation for such i provisions being made, having faced the Andrae problem. It 1 i might also be mentioned here that if Dr. Morgan's most j i recent supplement covering this period had been published at the time, the research involved in this case would have beeri unnecessary since he lists the 1936 translation. j A third problem, one which I suppose is almost j ^ t inescapable, is the incorrect listing of some author names, j due possibly to typesetting errors. I say almost inescapable ! because each of the three works suffered from this to some extent. LC lists, for example, both Benno Zieser and Bruno ! Zeiser as the author of Road to Stalingrad. (The first j seems to be the correct one.) ITlO presents the author of j I ! The Willing Flesh as Heinrich Willi, (actually Willi Hein- j j rich as the IT itself lists in four other entries in that ! j Q O same volume). Perhaps the epitome of error in author ! i I names is exemplified in the BNB entry which interchanges twoj ; ! entire names: the one is Wilhelm Andersen, The Bridges of j i i God: the other, Donald Anderson McGavran, Towards a ! Theology of Mission, translated from the German. Actually, 32IT10, item No. 18874. 36 j ] the two should be reversed. Even this type of error is i exceeded by IT12, this time with a translator name listed | 34 I :as Kathrine Schramm. Actually, the name derives from j i combining that of the translator, Kathrine Potts, with that of the illustrator, Ulrik Schramm. In this same vein we ! 3 5 i find names occasionally translated in the IT. In other j ! I leases the name is respelled by the French compiler or ! typist. Finally, the title itself is not always safe from error, as demonstrated by the IT listing which changed j 37 ! Aichinger's The Bound Man to . . . Round . . .. j Before going into detail on the last, and by far the ! ! greatest problem, that of recognizing many works that are ) bona fide translations, let me mention the most grueling j though trifling task, that of trying to be consistent while i drawing from three diverse sources. If, for example, original entries were made on the cards according to the presumed final format, they had to be rechecked later to | make sure they still matched the actual final sequence of j information. If they were typed according to the actual i entry they represented, material had to be deleted and ! ! ! rearranged for the final entry. Even after that the minor j I 34IT12, item 19477. j 3 5 ' IT13, item 12533 makes Maurice out of Moriz. 3 6 ITll, item 7830 respells Bauer as Baueur. 37IT9, item 5719. ! 37 I i \\ 1 s details of sequence of European, British, and American | ‘ entries, uniform usage of comma or period after \"same\" : ! gentries, etc., created an endless aggravation, in no small j ; r part due to the constant proofreading necessary to insure j : I 'correctness. The use of IBM computer cards has helped j i considerably through both ease of correction and rapid ! ■ | delivery of proof copy on short notice. To be sure, it is dismaying to find blank spaces replaced by asterisks on a print because of a sudden quirk in an old machine, but these are only occasional things. j Methods for Determining a Bona Fide j Translation from German j Let us turn now to the final and most elusive task of all, that of recognizing a work which is a translation | from German to English. What is the key revealing point j about such a work? Can't we just look for authors who have j i German names and use that as our clue? Yes, but it remains j i just that, since, as shall be demonstrated shortly, many ! t i authors with German names do not write German works, though j there may be German translations listed for those works. I } On the other hand, to a far greater degree than one would j suppose, authors having non-German names write German j I originals, and many of them cannot be regarded as German by ! any criterion except their choice of language. Dr. Morgan j oversimplifies, I am sure, his actual method of checking when he tells us his approach \"was to go through each list | 38 ! from beginning to end, stopping at each name that looked iGerman, and examining the titles under it to see if any qp ! were translations. , , ' JO This is just the beginning and the j 5 first key to a possible German to English translation, as j I'm sure he would admit. An expert often shows how he ! i accomplished a deft maneuver better than he describes that [ same maneuver to others. The key is probably closer akin ! i j to what Germans call Fingerspitzengefuhl. a feeling in the | Itips of the fingers, based on years of experience, a vast memory bank of what combinations are likely to produce results and which are not, etc. As a second clue, Dr. Morgan states that \"if a given I writer has a German title in print, that proves he had a j ; i German upbringing, a German education, and a German back- 39 ground and could be classed as permanently German.\" Based on this he then concludes: \"Therefore, anything he wrote came out of a German mind and might fairly be called German,This view can readily be ascribed to if we alter] j it slightly to read \"a German upbringing, and/or a German j j education, and or a German background.\" This presumes j i I that the German title mentioned is not an unannounced trans-l i lation, as has been the case here and there. To the rest I can heartily subscribe. 38Morgan 1, p. 9. 40Ibid.. p. 9. ^Morgan III, p. 8. 39 | Doubtlessly it is one’s knowledge of such a \"German } title in print\" (i.e., recognition and therefore acceptance i [ of an author as German) that makes it possible to recognize i an English work by such authors as Goethe and Schiller as j a translation from German, whether marked as such or not. j I That same knowledge may also mislead, however, even in the j i case of the well-known author, unless great pains are taken j to research any doubtful or seemingly erroneous bit of data.j Such a situation is exemplified in Heine's Religion and | I Philosophy in Germany, a Fragment. listed in B60 as a translation from German, but accompanied by the original title De l'Allemagne. My \"knowledge\" interpreted the latterj ! I information as fallacious, since German works normally bear j German rather than French titles, and it is well known that Mme. de Stael wrote De l'Allemagne. In addition, LC62 had | already supplied the \"correct\" German title, Zur Geschichte ] der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland. Although very j i i certain that the French title was spurious, I nevertheless j I took the time to locate both the 1959 edition of the trans- j lation, and the original one of 1882. In the latter publication was found the following: \\ I In the French version of Heine's works, the book j now translated appears as the first part of the two volumes entitled \"De l'Allemagne.\" These volumes were carefully revised by Heine during the latter years of his life, but the later German editions had not the benefit of such revision. The French version, as finally revised by the author, must therefore be regarded as the definitive form in which he desired the work to appear. ; | | Confronted not only by this support of the French title, j : I but also proof of a French version prior to that in German, j i II began to doubt that the translation information in the j i BNB had been correct. The next page of the introduction j revealed that \"the actual translation, however, has been j ;made rather from the German than from the French,\" which j corroborated the complete BNB entry, as well as that in j A9 j LC62. “ The French title was the original one (according | I !to publication sequence), while the German title was drawn j j from the actual work translated; thus I had both a French j ‘ and a German title for Heine's work (each of which was | ! correct on its own terms), some new knowledge about an i author I thought I had known well, and reenforced proof of the importance of relying on research, not knowledge, when data appears to be dubious. In the case of authors who are not known to the researcher and who do not appear to be German, clues other than those mentioned thus far must be used. In the case of Jacques Bloch and his work Frozen Shoulder, it was the combination of place of publication (Basle) and the name of the co-author (Fritz Fischer) that piqued my curiosity. I had almost passed over the work as not being a translation, ; ^(London, Trubner and Co., 1882), p. viii. i 42 j Ibid._, p. ix. ___________________________ ; 41 t 2 1 | jsince there was no indication that it was, that is, it had flo statement mentioning translation, no footnote indicating j a German source, and no other German title listed for the ! : | same author. As a last resort, I attempted an educated ! : 1 I guess which I could test by research. Because of the names j ; ! I guessed it was a translation, and the Deutsches Bucher- verzeichnis listed it as such. Of course, many such works have turned out to be original English works and not trans­ lations at all, but the pleasure of having located at least a few works that might otherwise have remained hidden is well worth the necessary persistence and effort. I i An additional clue may be that of subject matter, as j j was the case with a work by Netty (Railing) Radnanyi referred j i to as novelettes, (from the German Novellen). Actually, the; clue of subject matter may be just as misleading as helpful,; as it was in the case of a work entitled The Life of Ludwig van Beethoven, by a very non-German sounding author named Alexander Wheelock Thayer. Neither LC nor BNB give any j | indication of this being a translation, though IT13 lists itj 43 ■ as such. Location of the work itself produced the facts, I i but still only in part because the work available to me was not the Illinois University Press edition of 1960, referred ! to in the IT, but a 1934 edition published in New York by the Beethoven Association. It explains in reference to the ^Item No. 9353. 42 i author that \"he gave the first volume to the world--and then; iin a foreign tongue. This would seem, then to indicate j a German original translated into English, but on the ; following page we find that it is; j ...not a translation of the German work but a presenta­ tion of the original manuscript, so far as the discoveries made after the writing did not mar its integrity, supplemented by the knowledge acquired since the publication of the first German edition, and j placed at the service of the present editor by the : German revisors of the second edition. j Thus a work originally written in English was published first j ^ I in German, a rather unique situation. Although the work | was now ineligible for inclusion on normal terms, it proved { ito have some English translations of letters written by Beethoven. 1 therefore chose to include it in the bibliog­ raphy. Note here that because of the German edition being j published first, the date cannot be used as a valid proof of translation, as might otherwise be the case. J j From the foregoing it would seem that a translation | is easily recognized if, and only if, the author is known j to have never written any works in English or the transla- 1 | tion is correctly marked as such with full information. The! latter instance doesn't occur as frequently as one would wish, and the former presumes extensive knowledge of both j the author's life and of all his works. ^Thayer, p. vii. I All translations not recognized on the above mentioned jterms must be carefully scrutinized and checked for possible German author or translator names (which may or may not ;help), an English or a German title (especially if other works by the same author have German or English titles), a title covering a German-related topic, or a publisher in a German-language area. All such works must be recorded or disproven since one reference work may later reveal trans­ lation facts not given in previously researched sources and thus cause a second or third search for previous listings. Conclusions It would seem that several pertinent conclusions can be drawn at this point, the first one being in regard to the sequence for successful use of reference works. At least for compiling a bibliographical work of any scope, it is generally overly encumbering to leave a work which is arranged in any fashion other than strictly alphabetically until last, since that is the time when the greatest bulk of materials must be cross-checked. Had I researched the BNB as the second source rather than the last, it would not have been necessary to wait until the research in all sources was finished before any given section could be completed, which was both frustrating and unnecessary. It might also be mentioned that such a change would have ■permitted an earlier decision on the problem of format, ^because the difficulties occurring in a single section do hot differ greatly from those encountered in the whole j f « I I bibliography. Of course, no sequence would obviate the ; jrather frequent cross-checking necessary; nor should it do so, since this is the one accurate way of insuring relative i completeness and thoroughness. ] The second conclusion pertains to the amount of works ! translated from German to English during the period 1956- I 1960. This seems to be at most some 10 per cent, based on ! I \\ rather extensive but arbitrarily selected surveys in LC62. That little help toward increasing that percentage can be I expected at present, if at all, from the field of machine i : i f translation is also apparent. I ! I A related aspect of the preceding is the fact that not only is there a small percentage of translation, at least according to the LC, but that this too is restricted to an even smaller group of authors. This is borne out by the fact that many authors have no translations recorded at all. i i A third conclusion must be drawn as to ethno-linguistic I areas represented in German works in the present LC i i holdings; namely, that authors from nearly every such area | are to be found among those who write German works of one kind or another. In part this seems due to the inter- i national scope of students at German universities, ’ demonstrated by the breadth of nationalities and cultures represented in those who write dissertations there. j : j : I The fourth and final conclusion concerns the now j ' i obvious difficulty encountered in attempting to recognize j | the bona fide German/English translation; the great variety j of national origins represented among the names of \"German\" i authors is partly responsible. Additional contributing factors are the increased shift of population in our modern western world and the greater opportunity for lecturing in i j j English-speaking areas. One last factor should also be ; t mentioned, namely the still-continuing but unfortunate j : j practice of publishers neglecting to give credit to trans- | lators for their efforts and contributions. This naturally | ! i results in many translations not being marked as such. The j translator ought to be given both credit and, where | necessary, responsibility for his contribution toward j | intercultural exchange. j I The question may reasonably be asked as to the real ! i ; i value of this bibliography now that it has been compiled. | ! Even in the manuscript stage it has been of service to a I professor of English inquiring about recent Faust transla­ tions, as well as to a graduate student of drama. The latter needed to know if Kaiser's Burger von Calais had been previously translated. Since I knew it had not been translated prior to 1961, and no subsequent translation had 46 ibeen made, the student is now translating that work as a I Master's thesis, with the possibility of future publication. It is hoped that many others will also be able to profit ‘ from the bibliographical information contained herein. 47 Unusually-named Authors of German Works I Abdelasim, A.
