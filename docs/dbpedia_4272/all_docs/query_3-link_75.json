Mathematical physics refers to developing mathematical methods to solve problems in physics. It has several branches that developed historically, including classical mechanics, partial differential equations, quantum theory, relativity, and statistical mechanics. Mathematical physics rigorously formulates physical theories using advanced mathematics. It has influenced both physics and mathematics. Prominent figures include Galileo, Descartes, Huygens, Newton, Lagrange, Hamilton, Maxwell, Einstein, Schr√∂dinger, and others who developed new mathematical tools and physical theories.",
