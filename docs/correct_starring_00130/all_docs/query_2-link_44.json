        "text": "I haven't met Seth Rogen. You probably haven't met Seth Rogen, either. Yet there's something about the 38-year-old comedy star's presence that always feels comforting and familiarâ€”at this point, 21 years into his film career, seeing him in a new movie feels like catching up with an old friend.\n\nRogen's movies reached an apex in the mid-2000s, when the likes of Knocked Up, Superbad, and Pineapple Express hit theaters, and he hasn't left the zeitgeist since. His movies continued the success into the 2010s with Neighbors and This Is The End, and last year's Long Shot was one of the most enjoyable delightful comedies of the year. Rogen's humor is always somewhere between raunchy and self-deprecating, but he's also shown that he can handle the occasional serious role as well.\n\nThis week, Rogen is back with a new release, the HBO Max exclusive An American Pickle. In An American Pickle, Rogen plays a dual leading role, something he hasn't done before (though he did play multiple supporting characters in 2008's Fanboys). The story follows Herschel Greenbaum, a 1920s factory worker and Ashkenazi Jew who gets trapped in a crate of pickle brine and somehow preserved for 100 years; he's eventually thawed out, still alive, and meets Ben Greenbaum, his great-grandson and a modern-day app developer living in Brooklyn. Rogen plays both men in a story that feels small and self-contained, a perfect watch for a year when we're all forced to feel pretty self-contained ourselves.\n\nThe movie also does a good job of portraying the performer that Rogen has become over the years. He's not limited to just comedy, and the film puts that on full display, dealing with larger themes of family, grief, and religion in between laughs, jokes, and social satire.\n\nRogen has felt like a friend for the majority of his 21-year career, so it figures to be a good time to look at his body of work overall and see what lands where. The metrics for this are important to understand. We tried our best to limit this to something that we could reasonably consider a \"Seth Rogen Movie.\"\n\nThat means excluding supporting voice work roles like Monsters vs. Aliens and the Kung Fu Panda series, and small roles like Donnie Darko, Anchorman, and 22 Jump Street. It also means leaving out early-career roles in TV shows Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared, both of which connected Rogen with Judd Apatow, who played a big part in shaping Rogen into the superstar actor and creator he is today.\n\nSo without further ado, the complete ranking of Seth Rogen movies:"
