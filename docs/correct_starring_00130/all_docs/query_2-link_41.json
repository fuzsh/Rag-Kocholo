        "text": "Family Gay\n\nTo help pay off his incredible debt, Peter participates in medical experiments to make some extra cash. First, he is injected with the âSeth Rogenâ gene (guest voice Rogen) that âgives you the appearance of being funny even though you havenât actually done anything funny.â Then he is injected with a gene that leads him to a new mate, leaving a broken-hearted Lois behind. Although the family is crushed, they quickly realize the most important thing is that Peter is happy.\n\nValerie Is Brought to Her Knees\n\nValerie is excited to meet her co-star during the first day on set for \"Seeing Red\"; Valerie puts on a brave face while filming a fantasy sequence in the show."
