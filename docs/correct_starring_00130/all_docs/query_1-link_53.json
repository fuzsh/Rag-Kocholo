        "text": "The endearingly dorky actor has acquired a taste for less likeable roles. Next, he's tripping across Chile – literally – for his new film Crystal Fairy\n\nSuperbad's Evan Goldberg has turned bromance into comedy gold. He tells Hadley Freeman about writing for Ali G, the secret to comedy and why his new apocalypse movie is touching\n\nHe is the actor behind some generation-defining nerds, including McLovin from Superbad. Steve Rose meets the man happy to be called geek\n\nFor all its predictability, this tale of growing up and getting out, set in a Reading that's a million miles from the Slough of The Office, is heartfelt and affecting, says Catherine Shoard\n\nFrom Marlon Brando in The Wild One to Superbad, Killian Fox charts the development of the teen genre\n\nFrom Superbad to this in little over a year, the one-time crown prince of comedy looks to have fallen far and fast\n\nSuperbad star returns to the Texas festival where Knocked Up debuted with new film Observe and Report\n\nIs this comedy about a broken-hearted puppeteer as good as Superbad and Knocked Up? Or is it time for the Judd Apatow backlash?"
