        "text": "We rate Seth Rogen's best and worst movies in alphabetical order:\n\nKnocked Up (2007)\n\nIn Rogen's first leading role, he plays Ben, a slacker who smokes pot and watches pornos with his friends until he meets Alison (Katherine Heigl), a career woman he has little in common. But they have sex after meeting in a bar and she gets pregnant. In one scene, Ben and Alison's brother-in-law Pete (Paul Rudd) go to Las Vegas and take mushrooms. However, attempting to be suddenly responsible, Ben ultimately ditches his friends and breaks his bong. Written and directed by Judd Apatow. B-\n\nLong Shot (2019)\n\nSimilar to Knocked-Up, Rogen's character gets involved with a woman who's way above his pay grade, in this case Secretary of State (and his former babysitter) Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron). She hires Fred to writes speeches and they develop an attraction. In one scene they take Ecstasy. Directed by Jonathan Levine. A\n\nNeighbors (2014)\n\nSeven years after Knocked Up, Rogen teamed up with Rose Byrne as a harried newly married couple who move in next door to a frat house. It's an homage to Animal House with Mac and Kelly intent on curbing the crazy kids next door. In one scene, Mac joins them and does mushrooms. Directed by Nicholas Stoller. B\n\nNeighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016)\n\nIn this unusual example of a sequel surpassing the original, Mac and Kelly are back and this time a sorority has rented the house next door. It's fun to watch female stoners get high and host parties, just like the frat. The best scene involves Mac stealing a trash bag filled with weed and him being chased until the bag opens and the weed spills everywhere, creating a stony free-for-all. Directed by Stoller and co-written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg. B+\n\nObserve and Report (2009)\n\nPerhaps Rogen's most regrettable role, he plays mall cop/vigilante Ronnie Barnhardt. Going against type just does't work for the generally likeable actor. Directed by Jody Hill. F\n\nRELATED: 12 Seth Rogen Weed Quotes\n\nPaul (2011)\n\nRogen voices the stoner alien Paul in Greg Mottola's offbeat comedy with Kristen Wiig. B\n\nPineapple Express (2008)\n\nAn early peak in Rogen's film career, he co-stars with James Franco as pothead Dale; Franco's Saul is his dealer. When Dale stops by for a bag, Saul makes him smoke the famous cross joint. But the third act is unneccesarily violent and mars this stoner movie classic. Directed by David Gordon Green and written by Rogen and Goldberg. B-\n\nSausage Party (2016)\n\nThis rare Rogen animated feature, co-written by him and Goldberg and directed by Gene Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, is set in a supermarket where all the products come to life. Rogen's Frank gets stoned with Grits (Greg Robinson) and Firewater (Bill Hader), B\n\nSuperbad (2007)\n\nCo-written by Rogen and Goldberg and directed by Mottola, this film introduced Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as best buds and Rogen as Officer Michaels, who counsels the traumatized teens. B\n\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)\n\nRogen's got his start in films with the supporting role of Andy, who works at Smart Tech with Cal (Steve Carell), the virgin in the title. In one scene, Cal's pals at work get him stoned. Directed by Apatow. A\n\nRELATED: Rogen's Lifelong Love of Weed\n\nThe Night Before (2015)\n\nThis disappointing Christmas flick features three old friends trying to rekindle good times. But each guy has his own problems that get in the way of the fun, an unexpected bummer for a Rogen movie. In one scene, his Isaac character eats mushrooms. Directed by Levine. D\n\nThis Is the End (2013)\n\nRogen's disaster flick features all of his Stoner Pack friends - Franco, Hill, Robinson, Danny McBride and Jay Baruchel. When an earthquake hits Los Angeles, they're all stuck at Franco's house. Each guy deals with the situation differently, which of course includes getting high. The \"Pineapple Express 2\" preview with Hill mimicking Woody Harrelson is a highlght. Written and directed by Rogen and Goldberg. B\n\n50/50 (2011)\n\nThis medical-marijuana movie stars friends Kyle (Rogen) and Adam (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt), who has cancer. Kyle provides the pot and jokes as Adam deals with this life-changing event. Directed by Levine. B+"
