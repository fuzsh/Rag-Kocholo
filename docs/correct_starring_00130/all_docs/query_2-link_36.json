        "text": "Brought to you by:\n\nThis month, many of you will celebrate 420. What better way to enjoy the festivities than kicking back and enjoying a few films from Hollywood’s king of pot, Seth Rogen?\n\nIt’s no secret Rogen fancies himself a pothead, going so far as to post that he’s happy he doesn’t have kids so he can freely smoke without worry or responsibility. The guy loves weed, and his films reveal as much, dating back to 2005’s The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Of course, Rogen has starred in quite a few movies since then, and while we’d love to recommend his entire filmography for 420, we understand there are only 24 hours in the day. So, here are the five best Seth Rogen movies to watch on April 20.\n\nKnocked Up (2007)\n\nRogen went from an obscure character actor to a household name overnight in Judd Apatow’s blockbuster comedy Knocked Up. Here, he plays Ben Stone, a loser who gets involved with a successful journalist (Katherine Heigl) after a night of partying leaves her pregnant. Surprisingly, Knocked Up follows Ben’s maturation from a weed-smoking, porn-watching man-child to a slightly more mature version of himself, one willing to toss aside his extracurricular activities for (ironically) his family.\n\nWhile the picture doesn’t revolve around weed in general and lasts 20 minutes longer than any comedy should, Knocked Up is a good way to kick off 420—plus, it has Paul Rudd to boot. Then, if you want more outrageous comedy, pop in 2007’s other foul-mouthed Rogen comedy, Superbad. You’re welcome.\n\nPineapple Express (2008)\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of the drug-fueled Seth Rogen comedy, Pineapple Express, follows two pot-smoking pals as they evade corrupt cops and other drug dealers. Equal parts bromance, wacky road-trip comedy, and violent drama, Pineapple features a sublime comedic performance from James Franco, who all but steals the show as Saul Silver, the laid-back, seemingly always high drug dealer whose loyalties to his friend run deep.\n\nShop Legal THCa Now\n\nAs customary with every Rogen flick, Pineapple goes on a little too long and flies off the rails in a surprisingly dark last act, but David Gordon Green’s 2008 picture is also one of the best buddy comedies you’ll ever see.\n\nPaul (2011)\n\nSimon Pegg and Nick Frost star in this road-trip comedy about two sci-fi nerds who inadvertently pick up a friendly alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) and decide to deliver him to his spaceship. Poking fun at everything from E.T. to Star Wars, Paul is decidedly tamer than most of Rogen’s picks but still finds time to throw in a few pot-fueled antics, notably a sequence in which our crew, along with Kristen Wiig, smoke some really strong s— around a fire.\n\nPaul isn’t the greatest comedy in the galaxy, but there are far worse ways to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon, which is why it makes the list of our best Seth Rogen movies.\n\n50/50 (2011)\n\nLike all comedians eventually do, Rogen stepped away from outrageous comedy and tried his hand at drama, resulting in Jonathan Levine’s cancer-themed 50/50, co-starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Of course, I use the term “drama” loosely in this regard. 50/50 may not feature wall-to-wall gags about sex or drugs, but it is funny and certainly the type of picture that makes you appreciate life’s simple pleasures, including weed, which they smoke—a lot.\n\nStill, of all the films in Rogen’s oeuvre, this might be the most successful at balancing his robust humor with a hefty dose of meaningful material. It helps to have a supporting cast consisting of Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Houston, and Philip Baker Hall.\n\nThis Is the End (2013)\n\nFinally, wrap up your day’s viewing with 2013’s delightfully raunchy apocalyptic comedy, This Is the End. Directed by Rogen and frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg, the film follows a group of celebrities navigating the end of the world. Rogen stars alongside James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, all playing exaggerated versions of themselves — vain, petty celebrities with no idea how to deal with the extraordinary situation.\n\nNaturally, they enlist the aid of drugs and Emma Watson to ward off the peculiar natural disasters and various demons en route to a trip to Heaven featuring the Backstreet Boys. This Is the End represents the last genuinely outrageous, no-holds-barred comedy, which is why it is a fitting end to our list of the best Seth Rogen movies.\n\nWith over 25,000+ 5 star reviews and operating in 34 states – Mood makes the unwind for your next movie night completely legal and delivered to your doorstep.
