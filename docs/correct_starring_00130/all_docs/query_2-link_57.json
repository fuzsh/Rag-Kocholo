        "text": "This is the first time we'll highlight a Rogen collaboration with producer buddy Evan Goldberg. They co-directed this film. This 2014 political satire is also brought together Rogen and co-star James Franco, as they were formerly frequent collaborators. Rogen's Rapoport is a television producer who, along with talk show host Dave Skylark (Franco), manages to land an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il (played by Randall Park). Then, they are brought in by the CIA to kill the autocrat. Rapoport is the straight man to the goofy, misguided Skylark. Of course, Aaron's everyman status gets thrown for a loop and provides some decent laughs to warrant the time spent watching\n\nWe're talking about the 2019 computer-animated version directed by Jon Favreau. Rogen provides the comic relief, along with buddy Timon, as the excitable, dim-witted warthog who takes in a young, confused Simba when he runs away from home. Rogen is charming in the role. This project offers another example of his versatility as an entertainer, and his professional maturity as he grew beyond the raunchier characters off which he initially made his name.\n\nThis character is also known as Master Mantis. Sticking with the animated theme, Rogen found himself part of the successful Kung Fu Panda franchise, which is still going strong. Part of the \"Furious Five,\" Mantis was destined to be a warrior. He can boast an attitude at times, but when it comes to his loyalty, Mantis is rather dependable. So are the laughs he's generated through the history of the franchise, even if the films have lagged in quality as time's ticked forward.\n\nBrothers James and Dave Franco star in this biopic, which the former directed, based on the memoir of The Room actor Greg Sestero. In a supporting role, Rogen steals many scenes as the script director of the aforementioned film. He plays a much bigger behind-the-scenes role on the project, too. Schklair's sarcasm is one of the highlights of this comedy-drama. But more so, it shows that Rogen can have a seriously positive impact on a film when he's not the star.\n\nBy 2014, when Neighbors came out, Rogen was a legit leading man when it came to big-screen comedies. In this case, he's also a family man, with wife Kelly (Rose Byrne) and an infant child. Life is relatively good, until a college fraternity relocates next to their house. Noisy, wild nights cause trouble for Mac, who is somewhat torn because he and Kelly also miss their care-free days before the responsibilities of marriage. Rogen as the good boy, longing to be bad again, is still entertaining.\n\nIn one of the more underrated Christmas comedies out there, The Night Before (2015) is a tale about three friends (Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Anthony Mackie) who still get together on Christmas Eve as adults.It's a tradition they started as children. Isaac appears to be the most grounded of the trio, married with a child on the way. However, in true fashion of a Rogen comedy character, he's still a mischievous kid at heart — longing for a good time. Yes, it's a garden-variety role for Rogen, but it still stands out on his resume.\n\nWhile Rogen had been writing for TV, Superbad was the first film he did for the big screen. Teamed with childhood friend and frequent professional collaborator Evan Goldberg, this raunchy 2007 coming-of-age comedy follows a day in the life of soon-to-be high school graduates Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill). It was loosely based on Rogen and Goldberg as high schoolers in Vancouver. Rogen plays a cop who, along with partner Officer Slater (Bill Hader), inadvertently hit Seth with their police car. They also befriend goofy brainiac Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), proving authority figures can relate to the younger generation.\n\nRogen has become so versatile in his acting abilities that we can actually take him seriously when it comes to starring as a romantic-comedy leading man. OK, he's not Tom Hanks, but Rogen's performance in 2019's Long Shot opposite Charlize Theron is perhaps the one bright spot of an average movie. Fred Flarsky is an unemployed journalist who ends up becoming the speechwriter for Theron's Presidential candidate Charlotte Field. She also happens to be Fred's old babysitter and childhood crush. While the plot is predictable, Flarsky provides enough quality comedic and believably endearing moments.\n\nAs we'll come to see, Rogen and prominent writer, producer, director Judd Apatow have enjoyed quite the professional relationship. While Apatow's former roommate Adam Sandler, as George Simmons — a retired comedian-turned-actor facing a serious health crisis — is the star here, Rogen's Wright is arguably the main reason to watch this rather mediocre comedy-drama from 2009. Wright is a young stand-up comic on the rise. He becomes one of the only friends — and indirectly a protege — to the disillusioned Simmons. Apatow has stated the movie takes elements of his own life coming up as an entertainer.\n\nWhen it comes to peeling back on the onion on Rogen's acting career, look no further than Take This Waltz, a 2011 rom-com that earned critical acclaim. He stars opposite Academy Award-nominated actress Michelle Williams, who plays his wife. She ultimately leaves his character, though, for a mysteriously handsome neighbor. Lou is a doting husband. He's witty and understanding but lacks passion. It just might be the most vulnerable character Rogen has ever portrayed.\n\nOur first mention of the work Rogen has done on television during his career. Created by his long-time working buddy Judd Apatow, the severely underrated Undeclared lasted just 17 episodes over one season from 2001-02. In Rogen's case, there is a lot of himself in Ron Garner. He's a jokester from Canada who shares a college dorm suite with Steven (Jay Baruchel), the show's protagonist. Though Ron is known for his dry sense of humor, he's actually quite intelligent.\n\nRogen's recurring character on the fantasy-football fueled television series that ran from 2009-15 on FX and FXX was just another reason to love the underrated comedy. Randy is a friend of Rafi (Jason Mantzoukas) after they met in a mental asylum. We eventually find out that Randy is indirectly responsible for the death of Rafi's family.\n\nThis is where it really began for Rogen. He joined the likes of James Franco, Jason Segel, Busy Philipps, and Martin Starr, names he would team up regularly with on film, in this Paul Feig creation that Judd Apatow produced. The television series lasted only one season on NBC, but it received much critical praise and has grown into a cult classic. Fans of Rogen, and these other young actors of the time, continue to revisit it. Ken Miller is casual stoner. He likes to crack wise and seems intimidating, thanks to his size and mutton chops. Yet, he's actually one of the more knowledgeable \"freaks,\" who doesn't like that some people think The Who's \"Baba O'Riley\" is called \"Teenage Wasteland.\"\n\nMore fun from Rogen and James Franco, and co-writer Evan Goldberg. While Franco earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance in this stoner comedy, which Judd Apatow also had a hand in, Rogen's Dale Denton is pretty impressive as a middling process server. Enough so, it puts his life in danger -- but in a hilarious type of way. As fans of his work are well aware, pot is another dependable co-star for Rogen, who just seems at home when the aroma of weed is in the air — on screen and off.\n\nNot only does Rogen star with a host of his buddies (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Michael Cera, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson), he makes his directorial debut in this 2013 end-of-the-world comedy. The movie is unique in that the characters play themselves, but in more far-fetched terms than their actual real lives. We're giving Rogen bonus points for directing this rather original take on the apocalypse while also portraying a character who remains humanly flawed until the very end.\n\nRogen's third full-length feature film was this stellar 2005 Steve Carell-fueled comedy. The 40-Year-Old Virgin is the one that truly got him going down the road for a successful movie career. Cal is a co-worker of Carell's Andy. He tells some nasty stories and is responsible for many of the film's inappropriately funniest moments, along with fellow co-star Paul Rudd. Cal has no trouble pushing Andy to leave his comfort zone, especially when it comes to his love life. He's not exactly a positive role model, but he's someone most guys would like to hang out with.\n\nRogen's most notable biopic role came in Steve Jobs from 2015, and it's one he pulled off quite well. Even in this rather serious role as the late Apple co-founder, Rogen feels comfortable and poised while playing such a high-profile, important character. At times, Rogen is so realistic in the role that audiences in the know might forget that he's a funny man at heart. That's once we get accustomed to the fact Rogen is actually playing such a part.\n\nIt's rather interesting that some of Rogen's semi-serious roles are among his most lauded. Rogen again worked alongside the uber-talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose character Adam is diagnosed with cancer. (Adam was loosely based on a real-life experience of director and Rogen friend Will Reiser.) Rogen's Kyle is Adam's good friend, and in his own warped way, he tries to help his buddy deal with this crisis. It's easy to write Kyle off at times, but we come to learn he cares deeply for Adam. He's just trying to make his rocky journey a little smoother. It's arguably Rogen's most heartwarming role.\n\nHere we go. If The 40-Year-Old Virgin really put Rogen on the Hollywood map, then Judd Apatow's Knocked Up (2007) proved he was ready for leading-man stardom. This was just the sixth film Rogen was part of, but he shined like a seasoned veteran as a slacker stoner forced to grow up after learning he's going to be father following a presumed one-night stand. In fact, Rogen's Ben Stone is actually more likable and endearing than co-star Katherine Heigl's Alison."
