        "text": "Point Grey Pictures, the powerhouse production company run by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and James Weaver, has signed a first-look deal with Universal Pictures.\n\nDetails of the deal are being kept in a purple haze but it is being described as a traditional film pact in which Point Grey will produce movies across various genres.\n\nThe company previously had a content deal with Lionsgate, a pact signed in 2019, and prior to that, with production company Good Universe. Sources say Point Grey’s television deal will remain with Lionsgate.\n\nPoint Grey and Universal have worked together before. The banner produced comedy hits Neighbors, and its sequel, both in which Rogen starred, as well as the very well-regarded comedy Good Boys and the profitable Blockers.\n\n“Seth, Evan and James have developed a filmmaking brand entirely their own,” said NBCUniversal Studio Group chairman and CCO Donna Langley in a statement. “Whether we’re watching their stories of teenage turtles, anthropomorphic groceries, or foul mouthed sixth graders making epically bad decisions, they always manage to blend Point Grey’s signature edgy humor with humanity and heart.”\n\nThe Point Grey trio pontificated on the deal’s announcement with their customary style.\n\n“Becoming newly anointed knights in the kingdom of Dame Donna Langley is an honour and privilege we do not take lightly,” said Rogen, Goldberg and Weaver in a statement. “We pledge to win grand box office battles alongside (Universal executives) Peter Cramer, Erik Baiers and the rest of our partners at Universal, and shall duly make the Universal coffers overfloweth.”\n\nPoint Grey is coming off the successful reinvigoration of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, after spearheading this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem for Paramount. The animated movie proved to be a hit with critics and audiences alike, grossing over $181 million worldwide. The company is also behind this summer’s The Boys: Gen V, a spinoff from their award-winning hit comic book adaptation The Boys from Prime Video.\n\nWith the Point Grey deal, Universal seems to be placing a fair amount of chips on comedies of all stripes. The studio already has first-look deals with Lord Miller, the banner run by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, and Judd Apatow’s Apatow Productions."
