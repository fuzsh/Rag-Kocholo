Welcome to WatchMojo.com, and today we’re taking a look at the comedy origins of Jonah Hill.\n\nJonah Hill Feldstein was born December 20th, 1983 in Los Angeles, California. Both his parents had careers in show business: his mother designed costumes and worked as a stylist, while his father was a tour accountant for Guns N’ Roses. This, along with his sense of humor and love of such witty shows like “The Simpsons” and “The Larry Sanders Show,” helped prompt Hill’s interest in the industry, and in comedy writing specifically.\n\nTo pursue his career, Hill moved to New York to study both writing and drama at The New School. During this time, he practiced his craft by writing and performing his own work at a local bar, and this earned him a small group of fans. Included in this group were Dustin Hoffman’s son and daughter, who were so impressed with Hill’s work they introduced him to their father.\n\nHill wowed Hoffman with his talent and comedic sensibilities, and so the veteran actor helped him secure an audition for a bit part in his 2004 film “I Heart Huckabees.” It was with that project that he officially took on the stage name Jonah Hill.\n\nWith a film role under his belt, Hill’s interest shifted from writing to performance. Hill hired a manager, who introduced him to Judd Apatow. The pair immediately got along, and Apatow cast Hill in a small and uncomfortable role in his hit comedy “The 40-Year-Old Virgin.”\n\nHis scene-stealing performance won him a part in the first season of the TV comedy series “Campus Ladies.” He followed that by playing a teenaged version of Adam Sandler in the sci-fi comedy “Click.” Hill even found himself playing Justin Long’s neurotic pal in 2006’s “Accepted.”\n\nThe next year, Hill found himself extremely busy with several projects. One of his most notable roles from that year was his part as Set Rogen’s loudest friend in Apatow’s “Knocked Up.” It was also in 2007 that Hill landed his first starring role, and achieved instant fame as Michael Cera’s crude and agitated pal in “Superbad.”\n\nFollowing this, Hill appeared in numerous other comedies, including “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” and “Strange Wilderness.” He also made a cameo in the Ben Stiller sequel “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,” and took a supporting role in the Sandler/Apatow dramedy “Funny People.”\n\nNext up, he played Ricky Gervais’ suicidal neighbor in “The Invention of Lying,” then lent his voice to a cameo role on “The Simpsons,” to a Viking youth in “How to Train Your Dragon” and to a cameraman-turned-supervillain in “Megamind,” opposite Will Ferrell.\n\nHill’s next comedy triumph came in 2010 when he starred alongside fellow comedian Russell Brand in the outrageous comedy “Get Him to the Greek.” That same year, he took on his most substantial acting role to that point in the comedy-drama “Cyrus.”\n\nIn 2011, Hill played the part of Brad Pitt’s assistant general manager in the film “Moneyball,” and helped create, write and produce the animated Fox series “Allen Gregory.” He followed that by heading back to school as an undercover cop in the film remake of the popular ‘80s TV series “21 Jump Street.” In preparation for that role, Hill lost a dramatic amount of weight.\n\nKnown for his distinctive voice and look, Jonah Hill took Hollywood by storm with his hilariously awkward performances and his panicked delivery. His natural skill helped him forge long-lasting friendships and collaborative partnerships with the likes of Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen. Not just a funny on-screen character, Hill successfully established himself as a screenwriter and continues to grow as a Hollywood heavyweight."
