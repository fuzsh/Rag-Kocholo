        "text": "Pineapple Express & Superbad. Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nFor nearly the last two decades, Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg have made themselves known as a household dynamic duo in comedy filmmaking. Since meeting as kids in Canada, they've gone on to make some of the biggest comedy movies of the late 2000s and beyond including Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, This Is The End & Neighbors to name a few.\n\nThe two have even gone on to work in other sectors of comedy including animation & stand-up throughout their impressive careers. In animation, they teamed together for the 2016 grocery store flick Sausage Party & the newest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, Mutant Mayhem. While in the stand-up comedy space, they produced comedian & frequent collaborator Kurt Braunohler's latest comedy special alongside 800 Pound Gorilla, Perfectly Stupid, via their production company Point Grey Pictures.\n\nIn an ongoing trend of filmmakers taking the opportunity to cash in on sequels now more than ever, Rogen & Goldberg made it abundantly clear in a new interview with Complex while promoting their upcoming Sausage Party: Foodtopia series at Prime Video that they will \"not be revisiting\" two of their biggest films, Superbad & Pineapple Express, when asked about potential sequels.\n\nWhen asked about revisiting their past films in any form, Goldberg said \"we're not opposed to revisiting some things, like Sausage Party. Superbad and Pineapple Express, we will not be revisiting. We will keep those safe and sound. There are a few things that are best left untouched...[adding] I don't want people to be like, 'But the sequel was a little shitty.'\"\n\nRogen chimed in saying, \"It's nice that high school kids still seem to like Superbad. I get a lot of 18-year-old kids coming up to me talking about it, which is not what I would have expected.\"\n\nHe continues after Goldberg's comment over a \"shitty\" sequel. \"Let's fucking leave it as is. Because it’s very personal to us and based on our high school experience, it’s nice that so many people found it funny and resonated with it. It’s unexpected.\"\n\nSo rest assured, the two comedy filmmakers will continue to churn out original projects together & push the comedy boundary (while not specifically relying on original IP) to make themselves & comedy fans laugh in the same way they continue to do today.\n\nTheir latest collaboration, Sausage Party: Foodtopia, is set to premiere on Prime Video July 11th."
