        "text": "Family Gay\n\nTo help pay off his incredible debt, Peter participates in medical experiments to make some extra cash. First, he is injected with the \"Seth Rogen\" gene (guest voice Rogen) that \"gives you the appearance of being funny even though you haven't actually done anything funny.\" Then he is injected with a gene that leads him to a new mate, leaving a broken-hearted Lois behind. Although the family is crushed, they quickly realize the most important thing is that Peter is happy.\n\nCamp Refoogee\n\nStan's determined to send a reluctant Steve to summer camp. The only one he finds is in Africa, and it's a refugee camp. Back in Langley Falls, Francine and Roger pretend to be a married couple at events around town, but they can't agree on their backstory."
