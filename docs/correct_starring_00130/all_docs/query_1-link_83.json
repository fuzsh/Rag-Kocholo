        "text": "It's hard to believe it's been 10 years since we met McLovin and the rest of the \"Superbad\" crew! The hilarious teen comedy was released on Aug. 17, 2007, and in honor of the flick's big anniversary, we're taking a look at how the lives of its stars have changed over the last decade. Keep reading to catch up with Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and the rest of the gang!\n\nRELATED: \"Knocked Up\" cast: How their lives have changed\n\nJonah Hill played Seth in 2007's \"Superbad.\" Seth isn't exactly in with the popular crowd, but once he gets invited to a party by his crush, Jules (played by Emma Stone), he launches a plan to obtain alcohol to bring to the bash so he can finally feel like a cool kid for once. Though it wasn't one of his first roles — he'd appeared in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" and \"Knocked Up\" — Seth was Jonah's first leading role.\n\nRELATED: \"Baywatch\" cast: Where are they now?\n\nNow a Hollywood vet, Jonah Hill has built himself a successful career in the industry over the last decade. After \"Superbad,\" he went on to star in both serious and hilarious flicks alike, with hit films like \"21 Jump Street,\" \"This Is The End\" and \"War Dogs\" under his belt. The biggest moments of his career thus far? When he secured best supporting actor Oscar nominations for his work in 2011's \"Moneyball\" and 2013's \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" Next up for the recently slimmed-down star is \"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot\" alongside Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nRELATED: \"Men in Black\" stars: How their lives have changed\n\nThough he had made a name for himself on \"Arrested Development,\" Michael Cera really became a household name after landing the role of Evan in \"Superbad.\"\n\nAfter \"Superbad,\" Michael Cera lined up a few more teen cult classics. That same year, he starred in \"Juno,\" which he followed up with \"Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist\" in 2008. He also took on the role of Scott Pilgrim in \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" in 2010 and teamed back up with his \"Superbad\" bud Jonah Hill in \"This Is the End.\" But Michael didn't just limit himself to the big screen — he also pursued his passion for music with the release of his debut album in 2014 and made his Broadway debut that same year, appearing in the play \"This Is Our Youth.\" He can next be seen in \"Molly's Game\" with Idris Elba and Jessica Chastain.\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse made his professional acting debut in \"Superbad.\"He didn't even have headshots when he landed the role of McLovin at age 17!\n\nOnce \"Superbad\" made him a breakout star, Christopher Mintz-Plasse continued to snag fun roles in Hollywood productions. He appeared in \"Role Models\" the following year and voiced a character in \"How To Train Your Dragon\" in 2009. He appeared in the \"Kick-Ass\" franchise too and will next be seen in the eagerly anticipated James Franco flick \"Disaster Artist.\"\n\nEmma Stone made her feature film debut after nabbing the role of Seth's crush, Jules, in \"Superbad.\" The natural blonde dyed her hair red to play the high schooler.\n\nIt's safe to say that Emma Stone's career has only skyrocketed since her big screen debut as Jules. In the last decade, she's starred in commercial successes like \"The Amazing Spider-Man,\" \"Easy A\" and \"Crazy Stupid Love\" as well as critically acclaimed films like \"The Help,\" \"Birdman\" and \"La La Land\" and earned three Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award along the way. When it comes to her personal life, Emma was linked to her \"Spider-Man\" co-star Andrew Garfield on and off from 2010 until 2015. Next up, Emma reunites with old co-star Steve Carell for 2017's \"Battle of the Sexes.\"\n\nBill Hader appeared in \"Superbad\" as one of the hilarious cops, Officer Slater.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" alum Bill Hader was already known as a supporting comedy actor and after \"Superbad,\" he continued to pick up roles in funny flicks. He enjoyed small roles in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" and \"Tropic Thunder\" in 2008 and memorably lent his vocal talents to animated films like \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,\" \"Inside Out\" and \"The Angry Birds Movie.\" In 2015, he landed a lead romantic role opposite Amy Schumer in the hit comedy \"Trainwreck,\" in which he showed off a very different side, departing from his typically goofy acting roles. In his personal life, Bill married Maggie Carrey, a writer-director, with whom he shares three daughters, Hannah, Harper and Hayley. He can next be seen on the television show \"Barry\" opposite Henry Winkler.\n\nPlaying the other hilarious cop in \"Superbad\"? Seth Rogen! Audiences were already familiar with the funnyman after he co-starred in 2005's \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" and 2007's \"Knocked Up,\" which came out the month before \"Superbad\" — which, by the way, Seth co-wrote.\n\nSeth Rogen has continued to be a major force in Hollywood post-\"Superbad,\" whether it be through his writing (\"Pineapple Express,\" \"This Is the End\") or directing (\"This Is the End,\" \"The Interview\"). He tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend Lauren Miller in 2011, to whom he's still happily married. Next up, he'll appear in \"Disaster Artist,\" the James Franco flick that will also feature his \"Superbad\" co-star Christopher Mintz-Plasse."
