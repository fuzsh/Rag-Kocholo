        "text": "Background\n\nRogen grew up in a liberal Jewish family. At 13, he started doing stand-up among comedians more than twice his age on the local comedy club circuit. Danya, his elder sister, is his only sibling. Rogen dropped out of high school after being cast in filmmaker Judd Apatow’s new prime-time comedy-drama “Freaks and Geeks.” In an ensemble of young actors just starting their careers, he portrayed Ken Miller, a burnout with a deadpan sense of humor. “Freaks and Geeks” quickly established a cult following, despite being canceled after just one season due to poor ratings. Rogen subsequently joined Apatow’s next television effort, “Undeclared,” as an actor and writer; the series got canceled after less than a year.\n\nMeanwhile, Rogen’s relationship with Apatow continued to be productive; Rogen featured in two of Apatow’s early films, “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” stealing sequences from protagonist Steve Carell in the latter. Rogen reprised his supporting role in “You, Me, and Dupree” and established himself as a household figure. Rogen later played an oafish pot-smoking slacker in “Knocked Up,” which Apatow wrote and directed. His one-night affair with a beautiful businesswoman — Katherine Heigl — culminates in pregnancy accidentally. The crass yet endearing film made over $200 million worldwide, and Rogen’s endearing performance cemented his A-list status.\n\nRogen’s wish to direct his films came true with “Superbad,” a bawdy comedy about youthful escapades that he and Evan Goldberg co-wrote as teens. Rogen acted as executive producer and made an appearance as a clumsy police officer. The following year, the creative tandem returned with “Pineapple Express,” a marijuana-themed action-comedy starring Rogen alongside James Franco from “Freaks and Geeks.” Simultaneously, Rogen maintained a hectic schedule with a part in “Zack and Miri Make a Porno” and a couple of animated films that used his unique voice."
