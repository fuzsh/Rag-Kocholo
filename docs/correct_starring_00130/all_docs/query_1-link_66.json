        "text": "The Hawaiian organ donor with no first name is turning 40.\n\nComedy lovers were introduced to McLovin in the 2007 coming-of-age movie \"Superbad,\" and years later, fans and celebrities are celebrating what would be McLovin's 40th birthday.\n\nThe movie, written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg follows friends Seth (Michael Cera) and Evan (Jonah Hill) and their nerdy sidekick Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as they try to get cool points during the last week of high school by bringing alcohol to a party.\n\nThe underaged trio decides to solicit Fogell to secure a fake ID to buy the party booze. Fogell comes back with a fake ID from Hawaii with a June 3, 1981, birthday and one name: McLovin.\n\n\"McLovin? What kind of a stupid name is that, Fogell? Are you trying to be an Irish R&B singer?\" Cera's character Seth said in the scene.\n\nFogell's ID gave him the alias of a 25-year-old in the movie, and both stars and eagle-eyed fans took to social media to commemorate McLovin turning 40 this year.\n\nRogen, who also starred in \"Superbad\" as Officer Michaels, kicked off the birthday wishes on Twitter, posting a photo of the infamous fake ID.\n\n\"Happy 40th birthday McLovin. (We wrote this joke when we were 14 years old),\" the 39-year-old actor wrote.\n\nSeth Rogen talks Kanye West relationship, shrooms trip, oddball fame in new book 'Yearbook'\n\nJordan Gordan-Levitt, who starred alongside Rogen in \"The Night Before,\" also gave the fictional McLovin some birthday love writing: \"Happy 40th birthday, McLOVIN.\"\n\n'Superbad': Where are the stars 10 years later?\n\nOther fans chimed in recalling their own memories of McLovin's \"legacy.\"\n\nOne user tweeted: \"there is a liquor store in my neighborhood that has a 'NO MCLOVINS' sign under a display of fake ids they seized over the years.\"\n\n\"and then no one called me by my actual name for the rest middle school,\" said Twitter user @_mclaiin."
