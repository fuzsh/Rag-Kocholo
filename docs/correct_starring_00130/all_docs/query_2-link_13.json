Have an account? .\n\nSeth Rogen has been one of the biggest comedy stars for decades.\n\nHe's had memorable roles in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"Superbad,\" and \"Pineapple Express.\"\n\nHe recently played Bebop in \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Donkey Kong in \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" (2023)\n\nThanks to Rogen's distinct voice, he's a perfect fit for the legendary video-game character.\n\nHe brings a fun playfulness to Kong. Being in the hit children's movie also cleverly introduces him to a whole new generation of moviegoers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. Seth Rogen in \"This Is the End\" (2013)\n\nDirected by Rogen and his writing and producing partner, Evan Goldberg, this dark comedy brought all of the stars from the Judd Apatow comedy tree together for what may be the last time.\n\nRogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, James Franco, Jay Baruchel, Martin Starr, Michael Cera, and Craig Robinson play Hollywood versions of themselves who deal with the end of the world.\n\nRogen is hilarious as a guy who has to be selfless to make it to heaven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Zack in \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\" (2008)\n\nBefore Rogen played the lead in Hollywood bust \"The Green Hornet,\" he starred in this Kevin Smith comedy in which he plays a broke guy who decides to make a porno with his friend (played by Elizabeth Banks) to earn a quick buck.\n\nThe combination of Smith and Rogen's style of comedy makes for an interesting watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. Ira Wright in \"Funny People\" (2009)\n\nJudd Apatow takes Adam Sandler and throws in some stand-up comedy to create a touching look at the unique world of comedians trying to make a living at their craft.\n\nRogen plays a novice comic who is taken under the wing of a legendary comedian, played by Sandler, who has a fatal disease (and is kind of a jerk).\n\nBoth actors get the chance to show off their dramatic chops here, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. Sandy in \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017)\n\nIn James Franco's behind-the-scenes look at the making of \"The Room,\" which is regarded as one of the worst movies ever made, Rogen is cast perfectly as a crew member who has no idea how this awful movie is actually being made.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Isaac in \"The Night Before\" (2015)\n\nThis criminally underrated comedy stars Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Anthony Mackie as three friends who always go out on Christmas Eve to search for the best party in New York City.\n\nRogen delivers his usual pitch-perfect comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Steve Wozniak in \"Steve Jobs\" (2015)\n\nRogen changes things up in this biopic on the Apple founder, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Rogen holds his own as the Apple cofounder \"Woz\" opposite Michael Fassbender's version of Jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Officer Michaels in \"Superbad\" (2007)\n\nIn this classic high-school comedy written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Rogen and Bill Hader star as cops who don't mind partying a little.\n\nRogen does not disappoint in the occasional screen time he gets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Lou in \"Take This Waltz\" (2011)\n\nUnder the eye of actor-turned-writer-director Sarah Polley, and working alongside Michelle Williams, Rogen tried his hand (and succeeded) at serious acting for the first time in his career in \"Take This Waltz.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Aaron Rapaport in \"The Interview\" (2014)\n\nIn Rogen's most recent directorial team-up with Evan Goldberg, Rogen and Franco play journalists who land an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and are then subsequently enlisted by the CIA to assassinate him.\n\nThe movie had real-life ramifications as North Korea threatened action against the US if the movie was released. The movie's studio, Sony, was also hacked following the threat.\n\nDespite all the drama, the movie still has one of the Rogen's best performances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Cal in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" (2005)\n\nAfter getting his big break starring in Apatow's TV series \"Undeclared,\" Rogen found attention on the big screen when the writer-director gave him a meaty supporting role in this hit comedy.\n\nAs one of the guys who tries to get Steve Carell's character to have sex for the first time ever, Rogen's screen presence proved he was on the verge of stardom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Ronnie in \"Observe and Report\" (2009)\n\nDespite all the different kinds of movies Rogen has been involved in over his career, this is still one of the most unique to date.\n\nTeaming with \"Eastbound & Down\" and \"The Righteous Gemstones\" creator Jody Hill, Rogen plays a troubled mall cop who goes on a \"Taxi Driver\"-like vigilante streak when he gets off his meds.\n\nThe movie's dark comedy was too twisted for most audiences, but Rogen's all-in performance deserves a second look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Fred Flarsky in \"Long Shot\" (2019)\n\nIn this outlandish romantic comedy, Rogen plays an unemployed journalist who goes to work for his old babysitter (Charlize Theron), who happens to now be the Secretary of State. The she's-out-of-your-league vibe is played to perfection.\n\n4. Dale Denton in \"Pineapple Express\" (2008)\n\nThis stoner comedy is the best of Rogen and Franco's collaborations. The pair are hilarious as guys form an unlikely friendship while taking down a drug kingpin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Max Radner in \"Neighbors\" and \"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising\" (2014 and 2016)\n\nRogen stars alongside Rose Byrne as a couple with a newborn who suddenly find themselves living next door to a fraternity. (It's a sorority in the sequel.)\n\nThough the Rogen and Bryne scenes are great, the comedic back-and-forth between Rogen and Zac Efron is what makes both movies work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nMovies\n\nAdvertisement"
