        "text": "40-Year-Old Virgin, The\n\nThe 40 Year Old Virgin is proof that motion picture comedies can still be funny. Sadly, the kind of consistent humor delivered by this film happens too rarely. This is the movie Wedding Crashers should have been: rude, raunchy, uproarious, yet wi...\n\n50/50\n\nMovies about characters suffering from cancer are nothing new. Tales of dying individuals have won Oscars, built reputations, and sold millions of boxes of tissues. Finding a unique niche in this crowded field is a challenge, but director Jonatha...\n\nAmerican Pickle, An\n\nOver the years, the “Rip Van Winkle” concept (inspired by the central conceit of the Washington Irving 1819 short story) has been used by a number of films. The idea – a person hibernating for a number of years and waking up to a vastly ...\n\nDisaster Artist, The\n\nWhen it comes to the pantheon of the Worst Movies Ever Made, there are only a few challengers to the title claimed by Plan Nine from Outer Space. One of those is Tommy Wiseau’s universally derided 2003 debut feature, The Room. Instead of fad...\n\nDumb Money\n\nDumb Money is many things but one thing it isn’t is “dumb.” An engagingly lighthearted rags-to-riches romp with a David vs. Goliath element, the movie uses its real-life basis to formulate a modern day fairy tale.

After several years of minimal screen presence, superheroes are coming back to multiplexes in 2011 with a vengeance. First out of the starting gate is Michael Gondry's re-imagination of The Green Hornet, a proper...\n\nGuilt Trip\n\nAnne Fletcher's Guilt Trip is essentially a mismatched buddy road comedy.

Neither of those descriptions applies to this theatrical version of Horton Hears a Who!, which has...\n\nKnocked Up\n\nFor Knocked Up, writer/director Judd Apatow's sophomore feature, the filmmaker has elected to follow pretty much the same formula that made his debut, The 40 Year Old Virgin, such a success.
