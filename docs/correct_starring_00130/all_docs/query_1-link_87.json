        "text": "In Sarah Polley’s insightful romance, Rogen plays Lou, the sweet husband to Michelle Williams’ Margot. The third person in this triangle is Daniel, played by Luke Kirby with magnetic charisma years before his Emmy-winning turn as Lenny Bruce on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” In most films of this ilk, there would be a solid reason for the wife wanting to leave, but the beauty of Polley’s script is it recognizes that things are rarely that simple.\n\n(Available on Tubi)\n\nJudd Apatow’s third film collaboration with Rogen aims high and while it doesn’t always hit the mark, there’s enough solid laughs and a trio of fine performances from Rogen, Adam Sandler and Leslie Mann. Sandler plays a famous comedian who re-examines his life when diagnosed with cancer; Rogen plays the struggling standup he hires as a personal assistant and joke writer. Rogen more than holds his own with one of the most accomplished comedy stars in the world, and it’s a blast to see the two greats playing off each other.\n\n(Available on Hulu)\n\nRogen was still a teen himself when he collaborated with Apatow on the short-lived but critically beloved Fox series about a group of college freshman. In the role of Ron Garner, Rogen has already perfected the fun, beer-drinking guy with hidden depths. The entire series is worth a watch or even a rewatch, as Rogen is joined by such future stars as Charlie Hunnam and Jay Baruchel.\n\n(Available for purchase/rental on Amazon)\n\nThere’s a real delight in flipping the script and seeing Rogen cast as the “serious” one, with Zac Efron playing the immature frat boy neighbor. Just a few years earlier, Rogen’s family man Mac probably was Efron’s hard-partying Teddy. Now he’s got an infant daughter and likes a reasonable bedtime. Even though the pair go after each other, their chemistry is so fun it makes sense they teamed up again for the 2016 sequel.\n\n(Available for rental on all platforms)\n\nPenned by Rogen and his longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg, the script for “Superbad” was reportedly conceived when the pair was only 13. Rogen was in his mid-20s when “Superbad” was made, which made casting him as the character “Seth” untenable, so he passed the role on to his younger avatar Jonah Hill. But in addition to Hill and Michael Cera as the teens looking to score alcohol for a big party, there’s another great duo in the police officers played by Rogen and Bill Hader. Their scene trying to get to the bottom of a robbery is an exercise in hilarious frustration; topped off by Rogen showing off his drawing skills.\n\n(Available on Netflix)\n\nWhile this holiday comedy did okay in its release with audiences and critics, it deserves to be up there with Rogen’s biggest hits. Isaac (Rogen), Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) are three friends who have spent every Christmas Eve together since Ethan’s parents died years earlier in a car accident but with time and maturity, their tradition is coming to an end. The movie is laugh-out-loud funny (Michael Shannon as their longtime drug dealer is a highlight) but there’s also a surprising sweetness in how it captures male friendships. Rogen even manages to bring a fresh spin to the scene where Isaac, on drugs, freaks out and confesses he’s terrified to become a parent.\n\n(Available for rental on all platforms)\n\nAfter playing a supporting role in Apatow’s feature film debut “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” Rogen graduated to leading man and kicked off a string of blockbuster films that relied on his easygoing charm playing a lovable slacker. After a one-night stand, Rogen’s Ben Stone finds himself suddenly navigating a relationship with Katherine Heigl’s Allison Scott and fatherhood all in one. We see Ben mature over the film, but not before plenty of outrageous moments – including when Ben takes mushrooms and goes to a Cirque de Soleil show. A sample line: “I’m freaking out right now, man! The mushrooms are turning on me!”\n\n(Available for rental on all platforms)\n\nRogen steps right into a drama by Danny Boyle with an Aaron Sorkin script starring the likes of Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet and doesn’t miss a beat. Rogen has admitted to not knowing much about Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak prior to the film, but that’s somehow perfect for the role – on the surface, Wozniak seemed happy to let Jobs bask in the spotlight. But in one of the film’s finest scenes, Wozniak confronts Jobs, pointing out that he’s done so much of the work and yet no one knows his name. In one of the film’s best scenes, he finally asks his partner with incredulity and honesty: “What do you do?”\n\n(Available on Netflix)\n\nWhile a lot of the marketing played on the idea of “How did that schlubby guy get that girl?,” by the end of this smart, funny, prescient film, no one will wonder. As Fred Flarsky, Rogen charms his one-time babysitter Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), the U.S. Secretary of State and hopeful presidential candidate with kindness, honesty and humor. After losing his job as a journalist because he’s too idealistic, Flarksy becomes Field’s speechwriter, humanizing her to voters and even helping her remember who she is. But some of the film’s greatest moments are what goes unsaid; when Field talks about having to compromise to get what she wants, Flarksy first says, “Oh, why, because you’re a woman?” To which Field simply responds, “Yeah, motherfucker.” Flarksy’s response? “Yeah, that makes sense.”\n\n(Available on HBO Max)\n\nRogen deserved an Oscar nomination for his role as Kyle, the supportive best friend to Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s Adam, who is diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on his spine and given 50/50 odds to survive. Kyle is the comic relief, always trying to keep his friend’s spirits high. This includes watching Adam shave his head and then suggesting he use his condition to pick up girls. But there’s more than meets the eye and Adam and the audience soon comes to realize just how much Kyle cares. In one scene, Adam stays at Kyle’s home and while the latter is asleep, Adam finds a copy of the book “Facing Cancer Together.” As Rogen once joked, it’s his character’s most appealing moment – and he didn’t even have to be on screen.\n\n(Available on Amazon Prime, Hulu, Showtime and Sling TV)"
