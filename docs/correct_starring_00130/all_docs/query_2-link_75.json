        "text": "(born 1982). Canadian comic actor Seth Rogen won over audiences as a charismatic buffoon in a number of box-office hits, including Knocked Up (2007). He also wrote, directed, and produced various motion pictures.\n\nRogen was born on April 15, 1982, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. At age 13 he began doing stand-up on the local comedy-club circuit, and three years later he won a role on the American high-school television dramedy Freaks and Geeks. The series proved to be short-lived, but producer Judd Apatow was impressed by Rogen and in 2001 hired him as both an actor and a writer on a new college-themed TV sitcom called Undeclared. When that show was canceled, Rogen, along with childhood friend Evan Goldberg, landed jobs writing for British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen’s show Da Ali G Show. Rogen also had a cameo appearance on the teen-centered television drama Dawson’s Creek.\n\nMeanwhile, Rogen received bit parts in two of Apatow’s early film productions, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) and The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). Rogen put in another supporting performance in You, Me, and Dupree (2006), but it was his next film that made him a household name. In Knocked Up, which Apatow wrote and directed, Rogen starred as a pot-smoking slacker whose one-night stand with an attractive career woman inadvertently results in her pregnancy. The crude yet heartwarming movie grossed millions, and Rogen’s appealing performance made him popular in Hollywood.\n\nRogen had long desired to make his own movies, however, and finally got the chance with Superbad (2007). The film is a comedy of teenage misadventures that he and Goldberg had originally scripted when they were teenagers. Rogen served as executive producer and appeared briefly as a bumbling police officer. The writing duo returned the following year with Pineapple Express (2008), a marijuana-themed action farce starring Rogen and James Franco. At the same time, Rogen had a lead role in Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) and a handful of animated features that showcased his distinctive voice.\n\nIn 2009 Rogen portrayed a mall cop in the dark comedy Observe and Report. That same year he starred with Adam Sandler in Funny People, another collaboration with Apatow. Rogen was also busy in 2011. He appeared as the title character in the superhero film The Green Hornet, which he and Goldberg adapted from the radio, TV, and comic book franchise of the same name. Rogen also provided the voice of a wisecracking extraterrestrial in the science-fiction spoof Paul. In the seriocomic 50/50 he played the supportive best friend of a young man afflicted with spinal cancer. Also in 2011 he appeared in the dramedy Take This Waltz, in which his character was caught up in a love triangle.\n\nRogen subsequently starred as an inventor traveling with his mother (played by Barbra Streisand) in the road comedy The Guilt Trip (2012). With Goldberg he cowrote and codirected This Is the End (2013), a zany take on the apocalypse in which Rogen and a group of other young actors appeared as exaggerated versions of themselves. In 2014 Rogen played a young father who must contend with the difficulties of living next door to a fraternity house in the film Neighbors. He reprised the role in a 2016 sequel, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.\n\nAbout the same time Rogen cowrote and codirected The Interview, a farce about an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. He and Franco costarred. The film was slated for release in December 2014. However, its distributor, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., pulled the movie after hackers disrupted the company’s computer system. The hackers, thought to be acting on behalf of North Korea, also made terrorist threats. The film was ultimately released in December 2014 at a small number of independent theaters as well as on cable television and online streaming video platforms."
