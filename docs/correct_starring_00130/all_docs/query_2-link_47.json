        "text": "Even the best entertainers have some real garbage selections in their portfolio. Unfortunately, You, Me, and Dupree is in Rogen’s. Without much of a plot, the film about a friend (Owen Wilson) who can't seem to grow up and nearly ruins a relationship doesn't have much weight. Granted, he has a much smaller role in the movie than his counterparts Kate Hudson and Wilson, but nevertheless, Rogen is in there. One of his films had to take the bottom spot.\n\nIn retrospect, The Interview feels like it existed solely for reactionary purposes. The notion of two journalists going to North Korea and launching a surprise assassination attempt on Kim Jong-un was already enough on its own, but when you fold in the future when a reality star president would go and visit the dictator, it just makes the movie even less appealing.\n\nThe Guilt Trip felt like a sweet idea, if not a bit stereotypical, but ultimately Barbra Streisand and Rogen’s film venture about a mother-son road trip never quite made it to the highway. While the concept of a deeply Jewish mother and her son going on a road trip seems perfectly cast here, it just didn't have the magic to resonate.\n\nOf all the projects that Rogen has worked on with Evan Goldberg, this is not the best representation. Perhaps it's because The Green Hornet's wealthy newspaper magnate-turned-superhero isn't quite a superhero, but more likely, it's just because the movie felt half-baked.The Green Hornet seemed like it had a lot of potential, but in the full line up of Seth’s films, it just doesn’t hold up in the same way as the rest. Rogen deserves another shot at superhero glory.\n\nAt the end of the day, Neighbors 2 didn’t really need to happen, but with the first one being such a success, it was worth a shot. The fraternity vs. sorority dynamic loses some of its charm with so many players involved. With Rogen and Zac Efron getting less screen time, the Radners' attempt to foil a sorority doesn't land as well as the original premise, but it’s a plenty fine comedy.\n\nObserve and Report is one of Rogen’s films that splits a lot of people. Playing an unstable mall cop turned vigilante, the movie bounces back and forth between playing off mental illness with offensive jokes and discussing it through comedic, yet thoughtful commentary. Through the jokes, it all depends on how much you want to reward Rogen for the big swings—we say it was worth it.\n\nRogen has a background role in Like Father, written and directed by Rogen’s wife Lauren Miller. While Kelsey Grammar and Kristen Bell do the heavy lifting as a father-daughter duo estranged for most of their life, Rogen plays Kristen Bell’s thoughtful straight-laced romantic love interest in the Netflix film. While it’s not his best-known film, it’s a solid watch on a Sunday.\n\nOutside of the top 10, Rogen’s Christmas-themed film is fine, but at times it just doesn’t live up to the same kind of hilarity that comes with some of his best offerings. Playing one of three friends who reunite on Christmas Eve, the movie is mostly a reminder that the childish humor on display is better utilized in some of his other movies.\n\nTo be clear, Zack and Miri Make a Porno would probably be lower on this list if it weren’t for how great Rogen and co-star Elizabeth Banks were in it. Also, if you didn’t catch it from the title, the premise follows Banks and Rogen as their characters attempt to... you guessed it... make a porno. It’s almost too bawdy for an R-rating.\n\nIt’s not his biggest role, but Rogen’s voice role as Master Mantis in Kung Fu Panda is almost worthy of a top-ten spot. We’ll save the better animated film for the top half of the list, but Kung Fu Panda shouldn’t be left out.\n\nSuperior to its sequel, Neighbors is the real beginning of Rogen’s best films. Starring as the next door neighbor to an unwanted fraternity house, Rogen and Zac Efron lead a hilarious back and forth turf war. Also, bonus points for including the comedic genius that is Rose Byrne.\n\nFirst off, Sausage Party is gross. Second off, Sausage Party is hilarious. But most surprisingly, it’s a pretty solid story—especially for such a bawdy film that falls squarely in the stoner film category. Does a movie about groceries having an existential crisis about what it means to be alive sound insane? Sure. But it's a concept that lands throughout most of the film.\n\nA movie about Steve Jobs's life is pretty easy to get lost in if you're not playing the titular character, and yet, Rogen shines. Rogen’s not particularly known for his serious roles, but that makes them all the more impressive. His turn as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is one of his best roles to date.\n\nThis Is the End is what we’d like to believe the apocalypse might look like from Seth Rogen’s perspective: filled with drugs and bright lights and Rihanna. The ensemble comedy is hilariously chaotic while somehow also being poignant. Come for the comedy, stay for the Backstreet Boys cameo.\n\nSuperbad lands this high not so much for Rogen’s performance but for his writing. While Rogen plays a good cop helping high schoolers get to a big party, it’s the movie itself that really shines as one of the best coming-of-age films in the past few years.\n\nRogen has barely made a name for himself when The 40-Year-Old Virgin came out. He co-starred as Cal, Steve Carell's advice-giving co-worker, and while it wasn't his biggest role, it's an iconic one. To date, it’s hard to find a film that Rogen has worked on as funny as this one.\n\nWhen you’re telling the story of Tommy Wiseau and the creation of The Room, you need someone willing to dive in and be as weird as the man himself. There’s no surprise that The Disaster Artist landed in the Academy Award conversation that year considering that it was Rogen and the Franco brothers who were behind one of the strangest comedies of 2017.\n\n50/50 is likely Rogen’s best work when it comes to combining drama and comedy. Playing the best friend of a man with a very serious cancer diagnosis, Rogen offers up a performance full of as many jokes as it has tearjerker moments.\n\nKnocked Up feels like the film that took Rogen from comedic actor to full-blown movie star. One-half of a duo surprised when their one-night-stand ended with a pregnancy, Rogen plays a stoner who steps up to the plate when adulthood hits him harder than expected.\n\nPineapple Express is quintessential Rogen. It’s not his highest-grossing film, nor is it the most critically acclaimed, but it’s hard to think of a film that is encapsulates Rogen’s career more perfectly. A stoner film through and through, Pineapple Express follows a guy and his dealer escaping from a hitman, and it's bananas the whole way through. When Seth Rogen comes to mind, Pineapple Express is likely not far behind."
