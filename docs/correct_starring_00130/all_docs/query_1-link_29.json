        "text": "2007\n\nCity Locations\n\nLos Angeles (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nSchools/Colleges, House, Retail\n\nLocation Styles\n\nParking Lot, Cape Cod, Craftsman\n\nAbout Superbad\n\nThe movie Superbad, released in 2007, is a comedy film directed by Greg Mottola and features actors Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Emma Stone. It follows the story of Evan and Seth, two high school seniors trying to find alcohol to impress their peers before college orientation. The film was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, produced by Judd Apatow, and directed by Greg Mottola, who has previously directed episodes of Undeclared and Arrested Development.\n\nThe film follows the misadventures of Evan (Cera) and Seth (Hill) on their quest for booze. Along the way, they run into Fogell (Mintz-Plasse), who has acquired a fake ID. Two irresponsible cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen) become drawn to Fogell's amusing character. The movie presents an honest look at teenage relationships and friendships as our protagonists try to figure out what kind of people they want to be once they leave home for college.\n\nUpon its release, Superbad received positive reviews from critics, with an 87% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 207 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The movie is praised for its ability to balance vulgarity and sincerity while portraying its characters in extreme situations. Superbad is considered an authentic representation of high school awkwardness and the importance of friendship. In 2008, the movie was nominated for a Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Performer (Michael Cera) and was nominated for three MTV Movie Awards.\n\nSuperbad Locations\n\nSuperbad was filmed in various locations around the greater Los Angeles area, moving from El Segundo to Culver City and then Glendale for multiple scenes. The backdrop for Superbad captures the essence of Southern California culture with its laid-back atmosphere and prominent landmarks.\n\nMost of the movie was shot in El Segundo High School and Overland Mini Mart in Culver City. Both locations feature prominently throughout the film, as Seth and Evan attempt to get their hands on alcohol so they can attend a party at Jules's (Emma Stone). The convenience store exterior showcases iconic 1980s signage that still stands today, while El Segundo High School provides an unmistakable glimpse into the quintessential high school experience in suburban Los Angeles.\n\nFor fans who want to truly immerse themselves in Superbadâs universe, a trip to these filming locations would provide an unforgettable experience. Visiting these sites allows viewers to participate in classic moments from this beloved indie comedy. From standing where Evan gets hit by Fogellâs car to the suburban streets, it's difficult not to feel like you've stepped into Superbad 2007 when wandering around these locations.\n\nThe opening scene is an iconic introduction to Seth and Evan's high school journey, setting the tone for their teenage adventure. We see Seth arriving at Evan's house to pick him up for school and catch a glimpse of their suburban neighborhood. In the movie, the boys seem excited about graduating but uncertain about their future. This scene is well-known among fans and contains several memorable moments.\n\nThe scene was filmed at 17200 Rayen Street in Sherwood Forest, CA. The residence is privately owned, so unfortunately, you won't be able to get inside for a full tour, but anyone visiting can see the exterior and get an idea of what it looked like during filming.\n\nRayen Street is located off Valley Circle Boulevard, accessed from Los Angeles via I-5 N. Itâs around a 30-mile drive from downtown LA.\n\nJules invites Seth and Evan to her graduation party during their home economics class. Their nerdy friend, Fogell, informs them that he will get a fake ID. Seth takes it upon himself to get alcohol for the party, hoping it will increase his chances of having sex with Becca (Martha MacIsaac), who will also attend the party. The scene is iconic for representing teenage life in America; it captures the anxieties and excitement of high schoolers on their way to an important event. The humor in this scene comes from Seth's overconfidence in his ability to get alcohol for Jules's party, despite his limited resources.\n\nThe location where this scene was filmed was El Segundo High School in El Segundo, California. It is located south of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) at 640 Main Street. This school has been around since 1927 and features five main buildings built with a brick facade.\n\nTo reach El Segundo High School, youâll need to drive about 20 miles southwest from downtown LA.\n\nThe scene set in the parking lot at California State University, Northridge, is an iconic moment in the film. Seth and Evan are trying to devise a plan to get alcohol for their upcoming party. Fogell arrives with his fake ID, adopting the name 'McLovin,' which leaves Seth and Evan dumbstruck. To avoid getting into trouble, Seth suggests shoplifting from a nearby supermarket but chickens out when he notices security guards inside. Instead, they instruct Fogell to buy alcohol from a nearby liquor store using his fake ID.\n\nCalifornia State University, Northridge, was selected as the filming location for this scene because of its close proximity to Los Angeles and its modern architecture. The university was first established in 1958 as San Fernando Valley State College and has since grown and developed into one of the top universities in California. The modern structure of the buildings adds a unique flavor to the campus grounds, making it perfect for feature films such as Superbad.\n\nTo get to this location, you'll need to take a 30-mile drive northwest from downtown LA.\n\nSeth and Evan ask Fogell to buy liquor with his fake ID. Fogell succeeds but is knocked out by a robber before he can leave the store. Evan and Seth do not witness the robbery because they are looking at a woman. When they see a police car arrive, they assume Fogell is being arrested and become upset that they do not have the alcohol or the money Jules gave them. Due to anxiety, Seth gets hit by a car driven by Francis (Joe Lo Truglio). Francis also gets anxious and begs Seth not to involve the police. In the end, Francis promises to supply alcohol to Seth.\n\nThe fictional liquor shop was actually filmed at Jons Market located at 1717 West Glenoaks Boulevard, Glendale, which remains open today for fans of the movie who want to visit the location.\n\nTo get to this location from downtown Los Angeles, head north on I-5 towards Glendale.\n\nAs Seth and Evan arrive at Jules's house, they are instantly met with a lively atmosphereâmusic blaring, people dancing, and drinking. The place is packed with guests celebrating Jules's birthday bash. Becca is noticeably intoxicated at the party. Later, she brings Evan to Jules's bedroom and tries initiating physical contact. However, Evan declines as he wishes their relationship has a deeper emotional connection than physical intimacy. Seth struggles to make an impression on Jules. In an attempt to impress her, he gets heavily intoxicated and passes out upon attempting to kiss her, giving her a black eye.\n\nThis party scene is quite memorable for many viewers because of its comedic tone and timing. It was filmed in a wealthy neighborhood, Brentwood, west Los Angeles.\n\nSuppose you're looking to visit North Cliffwood Avenue yourself. In that case, it can be easily accessed from Santa Monica or Venice Beach via car or public transportation such as buses or metro lines. Once you arrive at your destination, you will find views of Brentwood's lush gardens, sprawling greenery, and a quiet residential atmosphereâthe perfect spot for a classic Superbad-style party!\n\nThe following day, Evan and Seth head to the shopping mall with a specific purpose. Evan wants to buy a new comforter to bring to Dartmouth, while Seth needs some new pants. While there, they run into Becca and Jules. Evan receives a heartfelt thanks from Becca for not taking advantage of her while she was drunk, while Seth apologizes to Jules for his past behavior that made her feel uncomfortable. Evan and Becca go together to look for comforters, while Seth decides to help Jules buy the makeup she needs to cover her black eye. Their friendship has become strong enough that they are comfortable being apart.\n\nThe mall serves as a backdrop to Evan and Seth's last day together before heading to college. We also have the idea of âthe last hurrahâ as they spend time together before college, along with a reminder that theyâll âbe okayâ despite their growing pains. The scene was shot at Westfield Culver City Mall, 6000 Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, alongside the 405 San Diego Freeway. It opened in 1975, with notable elements such as a glass-and-steel \"theme\" staircase in its center, connecting five levels of shops.\n\nThe mall is easily accessible from various locations around Los Angeles County via car or public transportation. By car, it can be reached by driving about 15 miles southwest from the heart of LA.\n\nSuperbad is an entertaining, hilarious, and highly memorable film. It stands out among other raunchy comedies because of its honest portrayal of adolescent sexual yearning and its clever dialogue. The performances by the cast are top-notch, as they manage to capture both the joys and frustrations of teenage life with great accuracy. Jonah Hill especially shines in his role as Seth, playing a loud yet sensitive character that many viewers can relate to. The script for Superbad is also exceptionally well-written and full of wit and sharp insight into human nature.\n\nThe movie has a lasting impression on the viewer due to its relevance and relatability. Teens can identify with Sethâs struggles, while adults will recall their teenage years watching the film. Superbad is both heartfelt and humorous, making it easy to watch despite its sometimes crude content. Superbad was a groundbreaking movie, paving the way for subsequent raunchy comedies such as Bridesmaids (2011) and Blockers (2018). It has achieved cult status over time, becoming an iconic classic in today's society. The success of this movie also helped launch Jonah Hill's career as one of Hollywood's most sought-after comedic actors.\n\nSo if you want to check out some of the Superbad filming locations listed here, what are you waiting for?"
