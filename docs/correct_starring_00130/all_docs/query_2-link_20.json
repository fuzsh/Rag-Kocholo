        "text": "Seth Aaron Rogen (born April 15, 1982) is a Canadian-American actor, comedian, producer and filmmaker. Originally a stand-up comedian in Vancouver, he moved to Los Angeles for a part in Judd Apatow's series Freaks and Geeks, and then got a part on the sitcom Undeclared, which also hired him as a writer. After landing his job as a staff writer on the final season of Da Ali G Show, Apatow guided Rogen toward a film career. As a staff writer, he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series.\n\nHis first movie appearance was a minor role in Donnie Darko (2001). Rogen was cast in a supporting role and credited as a co-producer in Apatow's directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Universal Pictures subsequently cast him as the lead in Apatow's films Knocked Up and Funny People. Rogen co-starred as Steve Wozniak in Universal's Steve Jobs biopic in 2015. In 2016, he developed the AMC television series Preacher with his writing partner Evan Goldberg and Sam Catlin. He also serves as a writer, executive producer, and director, with Goldberg.\n\nRogen and Goldberg co-wrote the films Superbad, Pineapple Express, The Green Hornet, This Is the End, and directed both This Is the End and The Interview, all of which Rogen starred in. He has also done voice work for the films Shrek the Third, Horton Hears a Who!, the Kung Fu Panda trilogy, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Monsters vs. Aliens, Paul, Sausage Party, the 2019 version of The Lion King, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie."
