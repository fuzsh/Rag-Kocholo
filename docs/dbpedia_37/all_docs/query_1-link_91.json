        "text": "Heartbreaker is a silly little film, that's true- far away from the high-browed oeuvres of \"intellectual\" French films you very often see (or you are very often asked about, as we are in Oxford!). So it is true, it is not that kind of film, at all. It is somehow American in its comedy style, reminding you slightly of good old black and white comedies with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, for example (though this comedy is less profound in its subject than the black and white American comedies of the golden age)\n\nThe subject, again..., is love... are you truthful, are you happy? The Heartbreaker company is happy to make you break up if you are not (happy) and Alex (Romain Duris) is puzzled and refuses at first to try to seduce this beautiful and very happy and in love woman about to get married (Vanessa Paradis).\n\nI believe I could be like the critic in a 'bande dessinée' (cartoon) I saw years ago (was it by Claire Bretécher?) of this film critic, laughing for one hour and a half or at least smiling and enjoying his time, and then writing a review or saying it was a bad film... well if you enjoy yourself watching a film it is certainly not a bad film and I did enjoy myself a lot!\n\nIt reminded me of this less well done film (but still an enjoyable watch) called Hors de Prix (Priceless), a light comedy set in the south of France or Monaco too perhaps. (I have to say the first five minutes of Priceless are to be watched as they are so funny!!) I also could not help thinking about Vanessa Paradis in the masterpiece La fille sur le pont by Patrice Leconte when she leaves the beauty salon completely transformed, beautiful, as she's about to do a dangerous circus show in the evening.\n\nAnd speaking of beautiful and talented, there is of course Romain Duris: funny, charming, and dancing... Dirty dancing, though I believe purists will be able to criticise; as I said, it is a comedy, so really nothing should be taken too seriously. The rest of the acting is excellent, notably the rest of the \"Heartbreaking\" team, the couple played by Julie Ferrier and François Damien.\n\nWhat I took seriously, though, was the great care taken in hearing languages other than French and English... the \"purists\" like me will enjoy hearing real dialogues in Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Italian and I am sure I am forgetting quite a few other languages. For this reason, and quite simply the fact I enjoyed the whole experience, I would say: yes! A good film to go to and enjoy for the summer. Not such a silly little film after all...\n\nLucile Deslignères 29 Jul 2010"
