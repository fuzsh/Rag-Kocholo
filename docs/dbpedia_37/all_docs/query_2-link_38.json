        "text": "It’s all happened fast for the brand which Laurent Ferrier, a 37-year veteran of Patek Philippe, launched in 2008. In the spring of 2010, the eponymous brand was unveiling Galet, its first timepiece. Come autumn it was picking up the Men’s Watch award at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève. This debut creation, with its smooth curves and tourbillon with double balance spring, immediately struck a chord with aficionados. Three more timepieces quickly followed, one driven by the same calibre with the addition of a “secret” mechanism, and two others with a new micro-rotor movement in a basic version or with dual-time display. All four perfectly illustrate the brand’s exponential growth.\n\nThis meteoric rise is precisely why majority shareholder François Servanin took the decision to part company forthwith from Chief Executive Olivier Müller. He was replaced by Sylvère Demonsais, at the commands since August this year. Prior to this, Mr Demonsais was with Baume & Mercier before moving to a management position with the Richemont Group, then to Greubel Forsey and later de Grisogono. A specialist in finance and strategy, Sylvère Demonsais is a minority shareholder in the brand, alongside Laurent Ferrier, his son Christian, Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini."
