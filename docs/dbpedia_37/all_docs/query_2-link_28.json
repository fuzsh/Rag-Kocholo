        "text": "On a recent trip to Singapore I was fortunate enough to meet with serious watch collectors and high-class retailers. The common ground was that we all had a huge admiration for Swiss independent watchmakers. For example Executive Director of The Hour Glass has been responsible for introducing a lot of small brands to this region. When I speak to MB & F, Urwerk and De Bethune they always acknowledge Michael’s generous support. In The Hour Glass’s new Paragon boutique they also represent ateliers like Vianney Halter, Kari Voutilainen and Laurent Ferrier.\n\nGenerally as a rule I try and feature as broad a range of watchmakers as possible on Total Watch Reviews. As I always wanted this portal to celebrate the positive achievements in the world of horology I only ever write about watches I personally like. Clearly this is subjective and similar to the approach a lot of other blogs adopt. It doesn’t necessarily mean that I would actually wear all these timepieces but still appreciate an aspect of the design. Laurent Ferrier’s stylish Galet Traveller perfectly illustrates this point.\n\nEven though Laurent Ferrier has 37 years experience within the watch industry he only established his own label in 2010. That is why the amount of respect he has gained over the last four years is very impressive The Galet Traveller isn’t a particularly large watch by modern standards and only measures 41mm x 10mm. These classical proportions should appeal a wide variety of discerning male buyers and potentially the unisex market. Generally I found the watch comfortable and lightweight to wear. Essentially this is down to the elegant case design and choice of luxurious 18-karat white gold in production.\n\nVisually the Galet Traveller has a really sophisticated and understated appearance. Basically this is the type of watch that would look really cool with a dinner suit. Within the range there are numerous colour combinations including the sublime white gold and silver model I tested. What makes this timepiece so attractive is minimalistic silver dial with raised 18-karat white gold “Teardrop” style markers and “assegai-shape” hour/minute hands. Other refined features include a distinctive small second counter (at 6 o’clock), date window (3 o’clock) and dual time indication (9 o’clock). Overall the composition is beautifully presented and skillfully executed.\n\nPowering the watch is a high-accomplished self-winding movement with an impressive power reserve of 80-hours. The Calibre LF 230.01 comprises 44-jewels and oscillates at a frequency of 21,600 vibrations per hour (3Hz). Each component (including the micro-rotor, bridges, balance spring) has been masterfully created, assembled and decorated by Laurent Ferrier at his workshops in Geneva. This exquisite mechanism can also be viewed through the sapphire crystal exhibition case back. Functionally the Galet Traveller features hours, minutes, small seconds, date facility and dual time indication.\n\nThe Galet Traveller (as tested) has a hand-stitched light brown alligator strap with matching 18-karat white gold folding clasp. Priced at: 58,000 CHF (approximately $62,820).\n\nFor more information about Laurent Ferrier visit his website: http://www.laurentferrier.ch"
