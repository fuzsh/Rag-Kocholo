        "text": "Inspired by the 1930’s, these two new pieces are an ode to the time-honored traditions of Fine Watchmaking. Unique and nostalgic yet unmistakably modern, these two minimal interpretations incorporate a real part of history.\n\nLAURENT FERRIER has always drawn its inspiration from the time-honored traditions of Fine Watchmaking. These vintage influences, combined with the eponymous designer’s animist beliefs, make it possible to create watches that are much more than mere tools for telling the time but real multisensory experiences. Through two exclusive pieces, LAURENT FERRIER offers its contemporary vision of a legendary theme from the late 1930s. Unique and nostalgic, these new Square Micro-Rotor Retro incorporate a real part of history.\n\nTWO RETRO DIALS\n\nThese original interpretations of the Square Micro-Rotor embody a return to Art Deco codes with their 1930s aesthetic characteristic. Unmistakably modern, this artistic style is based on a certain geometric rigors, minimalism and graphic stylization.\n\nAfter taming Roman numerals and drop-shaped indexes, LAURENT FERRIER is exploring Arabic numerals for this new design. Also known as pilot numerals, they give the whole piece a casual feel while offering exceptional readability. Finely decaled here with an Art Deco touch, the Arabic numerals are combined with a modern, architectural hour circle.\n\nThis new Square Micro-Rotor Retro’s 1930s influence can also be seen in the use of metallic colors, expressed in two different smart casual adaptations:\n\nA first version displays a steel case paired with a delicate silvery-white dial, whose opaline center contrasts with a subtle circular satin-brushed exterior. A decaled charcoal grey hour circle that match the numbers and small second markers beautifully enhances the whole timepiece.\n\nThe second variant offers a charcoal grey opaline dial with the same refined finishes, nestled in an 18K red gold case. The decals, on the other hand, are made in matte white to ensure optimum legibility.\n\nA TIMELESS CASE\n\nThe brand’s iconic Square case stands the test of time. Through its contours, symmetry, aerodynamic curves and complex lines, the Square’s case demonstrates its Art Deco character, while showcasing the House’s streamlined aesthetic.\n\nWith its 41 x 41 mm dimensions, it makes a bolder statement than the brand’s Classic case. It features a ball-shaped winding crown for easy handling. The detailed design down to the hooked case back allows you to admire the movement, visible at the back, free from all distraction. The watchmaker can access the movement via the olivette. Its water resistance is guaranteed to a depth of 30 meters.\n\nAN INGENIOUS MOVEMENT\n\nLike the Mad Decade, when apparent simplicity and minimalism hid a great cultural and intellectual effervescence, these two new dials conceal an exceptional complication, emblematic of the LAURENT FERRIER collection. Laurent’s love for exceptional classic pieces teamed with innovative and complex engines led him to kit out these two new additions with his famous FBN 229.01 calibre.\n\nA self-winding movement, it is equipped with a natural escapement Micro-Rotor. This escapement stands out with a unidirectional pawl-fitted micro-rotor and a three-day power reserve. A movement exclusive to LAURENT FERRIER, it is designed, assembled and adjusted in the LAURENT FERRIER workshops. It is fitted with a silicon escapement featuring a double direct impulse on the balance.\n\nThis innovation developed by LAURENT FERRIER in collaboration with the Fabrique du Temps, enables the balance to be impelled twice per oscillation, which requires two escape wheels and an appropriately shaped lever. This modern construction, combined with the use of cutting-edge materials, maximizes energy efficiency. This escapement’s excellent performance thus guarantees the balance’s high amplitude. The mechanical force required to wind the barrel spring is reduced, thereby optimizing the winding of the movement\n\nOnce again, LAURENT FERRIER is demonstrating with integrity its ability to create timeless exceptional timepieces devoid of any superfluous detail, with a pure aesthetic."
