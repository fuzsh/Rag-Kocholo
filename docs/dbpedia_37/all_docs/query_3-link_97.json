        "text": "With the Bridge One, Laurent Ferrier not only introduces a new shape watch in their collection but also a brand new caliber, especially for this design.\n\nInspired by the Passerelle de l’Ile, a very famous bridge in Geneva, Laurent Ferrier let us know that as a child, he was looking out at this famous landmark in the city from his room. The shape of Laurent Ferrier’s Bridge One is not only beautiful, but it should also enhance the wearer’s experience and comfort.\n\nLaurent Ferrier Bridge One\n\nEntirely made of stainless steel, the Laurent Ferrier Bridge One will be available with two different dials. Or, as Laurent Ferrier puts it in his press release, two ‘SIHH special dials’, which makes us believe that there will be more coming at future exhibitions (or other events).\n\nTwo Versions\n\nAnyway, the dials for this Laurent Ferrier Bridge One model are a slated grey dial and an enamel Grand Feu white dial. The latter comes with slate grey enamelled Roman numerals and the slate grey dial version comes with an applied XII marker at 12 o’clock and grey stick markers, which appears to be printed (thick though). Both versions of the watches have “assegai-shaped” hour and minute hands, the slate grey dial version also has a subdial for the running seconds.\n\nWith the white dial version, you will get the honey coloured alligator leather strap, and the slate grey dial version of the Laurent Ferrier Bridge One comes with a beautiful Honey Timberland leather. Available with double folding clasp or a pin buckle.\n\nCaliber LF107.01\n\nAs indicated above, the novelty of the Laurent Ferrier Bridge One is not limited to the case shape only, also the movement is completely new. Laurent Ferrier needed a new movement that would fit into this rectangular shaped case. So, they came up with caliber LF107.01 for the Bridge One. A manual wound movement, with a Swiss lever escapement. It has a power reserve of 80 hours. All the bridges of this movement are completely finished according to their high standards and are in line with all of their other movements. A sapphire crystal on the back side of the watch offers the owner of the Bridge One a perfect view on the caliber LF107.01 movement. Côtes de Genève, circular-graining, manual chamfered sides and interior angles and polished screw heads.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, there was no information at hand regarding the price or availability of the Laurent Ferrier Bridge One. As soon as we get more information, we will update you accordingly."
