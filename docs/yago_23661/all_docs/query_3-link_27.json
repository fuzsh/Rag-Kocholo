        "text": "Tasks\n\nFocus:\n\nFollowing on from the Jubilee Assembly video, pupils look at the role of two other female monarchs; Mary I and Queen Anne.\n\nHere pupils explore documents from each Queen’s reign, to find out what they reveal about the responsibilities of Queens in the past. What similarities and differences can be drawn between their roles and Elizabeth II’s?\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAs we know, 2022 is the year of Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee. This means that she has reigned for 70 years and is the longest reigning monarch so far! This is a time of great celebration as we look back at the Queen’s service and dedication to her role. It has been a time of significant change, both in Britain and across the world.\n\nHowever, we mustn’t forget that Elizabeth is not the first female monarch to rule England, or indeed Great Britain. In fact, there have been many other female rulers in the past. Let’s take a look at two very different queens; each of whom faced their own unique responsibilities and challenges, and who ruled during times of great change.\n\nQueen Mary I\n\nQueen Mary I ruled England from 1553-1558 and was the first female monarch to rule the country. She was the daughter of Henry VIII and his first wife Catherine of Aragon. Although the oldest child in the family, she only became Queen after the death of her younger brother Edward VI; the rules of succession meant that the first-born son inherited the crown. As Edward died without having any children (heirs) to pass the throne onto, Mary was next in-line.\n\nHistorians have quite different opinions about Mary I and how well she ruled! Some describe her reign as a difficult time for England, as she tried to make the country follow the Catholic religion. She was known as ‘Bloody Mary’ for her harsh treatment of people who were Protestant; her re-introduction of the Medieval Heresy Laws, meant that those who did not worship as Catholics, could be burnt at the stake. These laws affected many ordinary Protestant people, as well as professional scholars (men who studied and wrote about the Protestant religion) and Protestant bishops.\n\nThe other factor that made Mary’s rule difficult, was her decision to marry the Spanish Prince Phillip. Mary knew that it was her duty to have children and to provide a male heir to inherit the throne when she died. Prince Phillip was Catholic, which meant that Mary saw him as an ideal match for marriage! However, many people in England viewed him with suspicion and were worried that it was an attempt by Spain to control England. There was much unrest and pockets of rebellion when the marriage was announced.\n\nYet, it shouldn’t be forgotten that when Mary first became Queen, she was very popular! She had stopped another rival for the throne – Lady Jane Grey – from becoming Queen. Thousands of people had supported her as the daughter of the Tudor King Henry VIII and saw her as the rightful Queen of England.\n\nMary I also did much to improve things in England; she built-up the navy, began to reform England’s finances and laid the foundations for some of the successes that came during later reigns. When Mary died, her younger sister Elizabeth became the next Queen of England and could learn from the lessons of her sister’s reign.\n\nFor more on Mary I’s reign visit:\n\nhttps://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/Mary-I/476292\n\nQueen Anne\n\nQueen Anne was the last Stuart Queen and the first to rule Great Britain! During her reign the Act of Union was passed, uniting England and Scotland into one kingdom with one parliament, brought together under one monarch.\n\nAnne became Queen in 1702 after the death of her sister Mary and the death of Mary’s husband William. William and Mary had no children, so Anne was next in-line to the throne. Anne was ill for much of her life; she suffered from Gout (a type of arthritis that gave her pain in her legs) and she had to be carried to her coronation.\n\nAnne famously had seventeen pregnancies, but when she died in 1714, none of her children had survived her. Sadly, many of her children had died when she was pregnant with them, or when they were young children. Anne’s longest living child, a son, died when he was only eleven years old.\n\nFor more on Queen Anne’s reign visit:\n\nhttps://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/Anne/476549\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/anne.shtml\n\nTasks\n\nBack to top"
