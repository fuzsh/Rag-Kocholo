        "text": "Prince George of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland (2 April 1653 – 28 October 1708), was the husband of Anne, Queen of Great Britain.\n\nGeorge was born in Copenhagen Castle. His father was Frederick III, King of Denmark and Norway. His mother was Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nIn 1674, George was a candidate to be elected King of Poland. King Louis XIV of France wanted him to be elected.[2] George was a Lutheran, but Poland was Roman Catholic,[3] so John Sobieski was chosen instead.[4]\n\nBecause George was Protestant, people thought he would be a good husband for Anne, Queen of Great Britain. She was just Lady Anne at the time. George and Anne were married on 28 July 1683. The wedding was in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, London. The guests included King Charles II, Queen Catherine, and the Duke and Duchess of York.[5]\n\nWhen King William III died in 1702, Anne became queen.\n\nGeorge died on 28 October 1708. Anne lived until 1714.\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\n[change | change source]\n\n2 April 1653 – 10 April 1689: His Royal Highness Prince George of Denmark and Norway\n\n10 April 1689 – 28 October 1708: His Royal Highness Prince George of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland[6]\n\nR af E: Knight of the Elephant, from birth[7]\n\nKG: Knight of the Garter, 1 January 1684[8]\n\nThe royal coat of arms of Denmark with a label of three points Argent, each with three Ermine points.
