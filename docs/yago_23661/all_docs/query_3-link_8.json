        "text": "Anne of Great Britain (6 February 1665 â€“ 1 August 1714) was the Queen of England (which included Wales), Scotland and Ireland. During her reign, the kingdoms of England and Scotland came together to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain (the first form of the United Kingdom).[1] For this reason, she is the first monarch to rule over the UK.\n\nAnne was born during the reign of her uncle, King Charles II. After Charles' death, Anne's father James II became King of England. James was unpopular because he was Catholic. James was replaced by Anne's older sister, Mary II and her husband William III. Mary and William had no children. Anne became Queen of of England, Scotland, and Ireland on 8 March 1702 after the death of William.\n\nIn her first speech to the Parliament of England, Anne said it was important to unite England and Scotland. In 1707, they both formed to create the Kingdom of Great Britain.[1]\n\nAnne was married to Prince George of Denmark, who died in 1708. Anne was pregnant 17 times but none of her children survived to adulthood. In her 30s, she became very ill and obese."
