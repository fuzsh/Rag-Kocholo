She was the fourth child and second daughter of James Stuart, the Duke of York and Albany (Later King James VII and II), and his wife Anne Hyde, the Duchess of York and Albany. She was styled Her Highness the Lady Anne from birth. Like her sister and ill-fated brother, Anne had a host of staff to care from her since birth. Her governess was Lady Frances Villiers as was a woman named Beata Danvers [2], she also had a wet nurse, a dresser, three rockers, a seamstress, a page, and a neccessary woman. [3]\n\nChronic Illness and Life in France\n\nAnne suffered from many chronic illnesses, first of which manifested in an eye disorder that caused defluxion, meaning her eyes nearly constantly watered. She was sent to France for treatment, and lived at the Château de Colombes with her grandmother Queen Henrietta Maria. When her grandmother died in 1669[4], she moved to live with her aunt Henrietta Anne, the Duchess d'Orléans at Chateaux de Saint Cloud. After the surprise death of her aunt,[5] (less than one year after the death of her grandmother), Anne moved back to England. Upon returning in 1670 her eyes had been reportedly much better, but she still had great struggle reading.[3]\n\nReturn to England and Education\n\nAs a young girl of five years old, Anne (and her sister Mary) were returned to the care of Lady Frances and her husband Colonel Edward Villiers.[3] In her care, Anne spend a large portion of her childhood at Richmond Palace.[3]The girls were not educated in classics or advanced academic subjects, as their father feared it would corrupt them. They were, however taught French (the private language at court and of the family) by their tutor Peter de Laine, basic arithmetic, music by Mrs. Henrietta Bannister, guitar by Henry Delauney, dance by Mr. Gory, as well as drawing, needlework, and painting by Richard Gibson.[3] Anne grew up in the company of the six Villiers sisters, and their brother the future Earl of Jersey. [6] Anne made a friend out of Cecily Cornwallis, who in turn introduced her to Anne's near lifelong friend, Sarah Jennings. They had a close friendship that greatly defined the rest of Anne's life. Sarah was an dominating figure and ambitious for both herself and her future husband John Churchill.\n\nWith Lady Frances as her governess, Henry Compton, Bishop of London, was appointed as the girls' preceptor (a tutor upholding the quality of her Anglican education). The girls mother, Anne , died in 1671, and soon their father's conversion to Catholicism became public. The girls continued receiving Anglican education, and in 1673 their father remarried to to Mary, Princess of Modena. Anne, with a yearning for knowledge, found life at Richmond somewhat boring. She spent her younger years with card games, dancing, and other things. [7]\n\nThe death of her mother was partiularly hard on Anne growing up. She later remarked to Sarah Churchill, regarding a bust of her mother at Kensington Palace, that she could hardly remember the features of her mother.\n\nAnne had much love and care for her elder sister, Mary, who she greatly admired. They stayed together much of their early lives and on the 31st of January 1675 were confirmed together.[8] Though their chaplain, Dr. Edward Lake DD, wrote that Anne had first taken communion on Easter Sunday (March 31st) in 1678. It was the week of the 4th of November 1677 that was eventful for the family. On the 4th, Lady Mary had married William, Prince of Orange, and on the 9th the Archbishop of Canterbury died. On that same day Anne began showing symptons of smallpox. Their stepmother, Mary, had given birth to a child that week who would contract smallpox and only live about one month. Anne was considered lucky as to have a mild form of it, and for it to leave her face unmarked. Her governess was not so lucky. Lady Frances contracted smallpox and died. Her aunt, Lady Clarendon was appointed her new governess.[9]\n\nMarriage and Adulthood\n\nBy age 15 rumors of Anne's future marriage began stirring. Several marriages were proposed to her uncle including the Dauphin of France, the Duke of Florence, and to the Elector of Hanover (the future George I). George had travelled to England to meet Anne, but he did not like her, and she \"to her dying day had an aversion to him\".[10] Little did either of them know, she was to be Queen and he was to succeed her. Frustrated with George's presence, she joined her father and step mother for the summer in Scotland, taking up riding. [11] It was nearly a year later when returning from Scotland in July of 1681 that her father was involved in the Wreck of the Gloucester. Her father, John Churchill, and many courtiers were aboard. Up to 250 people lost their lives, and James took a large hit to his popularity. Soon after Anne, her step mother, and James returned to london by way of the Royal Yacht Mary, the wreck of the Gloucester leaving Anne with an uneasiness towards sailing for the rest of her life.[12]\n\nOne of the first of many suitors was John Sheffield, 3rd Earl of Mulgrave. Rumors claimed John actively pursued Anne, going as far as bribing her governess. [13] Upon hearing this, James (then still Duke of York) dismissed him from his household. Anne, charmed by John's attempts, was upset by his dismissal to Tangier. She again grew bored with court life, not one to gamble she wrote to her long-time friend Frances Aspley \"...this place affords no news of anything but of races and cockmatches...\". [14]\n\nIt was Robert, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, that contrived the marriage of Anne and George of Denmark. In April of 1683 he proposed this idea to Charles II. He approved and in the following month the engagement was announced publicly. There were a lot of mixed feelings around the marriage. Some heartily approved of another protestant prince marrying into the royal family, and some thought that Louis XIV of France had too much influence over the young princess. Never-the-less, Anne quite liked George.[15]\n\nAnne's courtship, engagement, and marriage was quickly overshadowed by the Rye House Plot.\n\nOn the 28th of June in 1683 they were married at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace by Henry Compton, Bishop of London.[16]\n\nShe was showered in gifts of pearls and diamonds and nearly £15,000 a year from the Prince of Denmark. Her father and uncle increased that to nearly £40,000 a year, and her uncle, Charles II, gifted them part of Whitehall Palace called the Cockpit (as it was near the court theatre that was formerly where cock fights were held). Their apartments were near where 10 Downing Street is today. Her coat of arms also was updated, impaling her arms and the arms of her husband. When her father assumed the throne in 1685, he had no male heirs. They informally lived at Winchester Palace, but kept official residence at the Cockpit at St James's[17]\n\nBy 1701, all of Anne's children had died. Having 18 prengancies in all, and no child had lived past 11 years old, it became very apparent that the next monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland would not have a clear heir. Jacobites pushed heavily for her half-brother James Stuart to be placed on the throne as James VIII and III (Fearing this prospect, the Whig Parliament in 1701 enacted the Act of Settlement which provided that the succession would pass through the protestant Electress Sophia of Hanover, grandaughter of Anne's great-grandfather, James I and VI.) Anne supported this means of a protestant succession.\n\nIssue\n\nThere is speculation on what exactly caused the high mortality rate of Anne's children, as well as her chronic health issues. While in her lifetime it was described as gout and obesity, moden medicine suggests she was a sufferer of Lupus (a chroic auto-immune disease).\n\nA Stillborn Daughter, born on the 12th of May 1684. She was buried the following day at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe Lady Mary, born the 2nd of June 1685 at the Palace of Whitehall and died the 8th of February 1686 of Smallpox. She was buried on the 10th of February at Westminster Abbey. [18]\n\nThe Lady Anne Sophia, born the 12th of May 1686 and died the 2nd of February 1687 at Windsor Castle. She died of the same group of smallpox cases as her sister. [19]\n\nA Stillborn Son, born on the 22nd of October 1687 at Whitehall. He was buried the same day at Westminster Abbey. [20]\n\nPrince William, the Duke of Gloucester, born the 24th of July 1689 at Hampton Court Palace, and died on the 30th of July 1700 at Windsor Castle of unknown causes.[21]\n\nThe Lady Mary, born and died on the 14th of October 1690 at St James's Palace. She was buried the same day at Westminster Abbey. [22]\n\nThe Lord George, born and died on the 17th of April 1692 at Syon House, he was buried the next day at Westminster Abbey. [23]\n\nA Stillborn Daughter, born the 23rd fo March 1693 at Berkeley House (also known as Devonshire House), was buried the next day at Westminster Abbey. [24]\n\nA Stillborn Son born on the 15th of September 1698 at Windsor Castle, and was buried the same day at St George's Chapel. (Burial not recorded in parish register)\n\nA Stillborn Son born the 24th of January 1700 at St James's, and was buried the same day at Westminster Abbey. (Burial not recorded in parish register)\n\nAnne also had several miscarriages throughout her life.[25]Little had been said of Anne's health between her return to England from France and her first miscarriage.[26]\n\nWilliam died at the age of 11 of unknown causes. Anne, distraut by the loss of her son, held a day of morning every year on the anniversary of his passing (June 30th) for the rest of her life.\n\nThe Reigns of William and Mary\n\nAnne had a strained relationship with her brother-in-law (possibly started by her father, who once said \"you will find the Prince of Orange a worse man than Cromwell\").[27] She disliked William, who she regarded as a man who overthrew her father. Never-the-less, she attended the coronation and supported her sister as much as possible. Tensions began when Anne requested better lodgings, first the former residence of the Duchess of Portsmouth. She was denied. She then requested rights to Richmond Palace and, again, she was denied. [28]\n\nGeorge was naturalized and created Duke of Cumberland. Anne was thus re-styled \"Her Highness Princess Anne of Denmark, Duchess of Cumberland\". Their son, Prince William, was sickly from birth. George and Anne decided to move out of the city (owing to the polution), and to Camden House. [29]\n\nAnimosity and resentment grew between William and Anne, especially after William forbade Prince George to serve actively in the Navy. Sarah's husband, now the Earl of Marlborough, was suspected of conspiring against William and Mary in support of the Jacobites. In support of her friends, Anne grew closer with Sarah. She brought her to public events and parties, and refused her sister's demands. The earl was dismissed, and Sarah was stripped of all her roles by Queen Mary. Out of anger Anne left court and moved to Syon House, the residence of the Duke of Somerset. [30]\n\nAs retaliation for her protest, Anne was stripped of nearly all her benefits and honours. Her guard was taken away, courtiers were not to visit her and were threatened with dismissal if they did, and even civil authorities were told to ignore her.[31]\n\nAt Syon House Anne gave birth, and the child died within minutes. Mary visited, and berated her over her friendship with Sarah. They never saw eachother again. Mary's unexpected death in 1694 lead to Anne's favor restored at court as heir apparent. Her home at the time, Berkeley House, became a social center in London.[32]\n\nAscent, Coronation, and Early Reign\n\nWhen Anne ascended on the 19th of March 1702 she was immediately popular. The English people (being displeased with the reign of William) were pleased to be lead by an Englishwoman and comparisons were immediately made between Anne and Elizabeth I.[33] Anne was generous to her people, though more generous to her friends. When Anne ascended, she and George were staying at Windsor. They returned to London where George was to be William III's chief mourner, and on the 14th of April they moved to Kensington. Anne had the Palace updated and gardens cleaned, thinking the air at Kensington to be cleaner and better for George's asthma.[34]\n\nAmong her first actions as Queen, Anne made creations and appointments that William refused. She made her husband Lord High Admiral and Generalissimo, and also made John Churchill a knight of the Garter and elevatd him to a Duke. [35]\n\nAnne's Coronation was a sumptuous affair, but trying on her body and health. By the time she was crowned Anne was plagued with severe pains, and could hardly walk. She was carried in an open chair up the aisle and back to Westminster Palace.\n\nThe peace would not last forever, though. That may, less than two weeks after Anne was crowned, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession. At home, Anne was determined to not let her health prevent her from exercising her duties. She faithfully attended every cabinet meeting, held audience, and touched for the Evil as much as she was able. [36] She balanced cut-throat party politics with appointments and honours given to both Tories and Whigs. Anne quickly grew tired of battle and war, instead preferring to showcase the glory of England through the arts and sciences. She often commissioned the likes of Georg Handel, Sir Isaac Newton, and John Crocker. [37]\n\nTension was to define her reign; political and personal. After the 1701 Act of Settlement leaving Scotland out of the requirement of a protestant successor, Anne feared her half-brother being able to return and continue the war after her death. Thus she deemed it greatly neccesary to unite Scotland with England, even mentioning it in her first speech to parliament. [38] Because of this, Anne's popularity began to sink in Scotland, its parliament retaliating with the Act of Security in 1704 (which allowed the Scottish Estates to select their own monarch after Anne's death), to which she wanted to withhold her ascent but eventually relinquished. [39] England retaliated to Scotland with Alien Act of 1705, threatening severe economic sanctions on Scotland.\n\nThe stressors of her reign placed considerable strain on Anne's health and friendships. She much preferred spending time with her husband, and gardening at Kensington. [40] Tensions were eased with the Act of Union, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain, but the damage had been done to Anne. She was seen at a Service of Thanksgiving at St Pauls Cathedral looking extremely relieved.[41]\n\nIt's around this time that Anne and Sarah's relationship started to deteriorate. Political and social tensions lead Anne to develop a deeper friendhip with Abigail Hill, Baroness Masham (a woman of the bedchamber). Anne granted Abigail residence in Kensington Palace, which angered Sarah as she thought that the apartments belonged to her.[42] Sarah reacted by going to court with a poem written by a whig propaganist accusing Anne and Abigail of having a homosexual relationship, an accusation she doubled down on in her memoirs. This started a pervasive rumor that lasted well past Anne's lifetime. [43]\n\nLate Reign, Widowhood, and Death\n\nThe Queen and the Duchess's friendship came to an end abruptly. After months of tension, they met at a service of thanksgiving for the Lord Marlborough's victory at Oudenarde. Anne tried to speak to Sarah while endering the Church of St Paul, and Sarah told her to be quiet. Anne, offended by such a brazen act of disrespect in front of her subjects, decided to oblige Sarah and only ever responded very formally and coldy. [44]\n\nPrince George had fallen severely ill about this time. Anne took him to Kensington Palace, believeing the air farther away from the Thames would be better for his asthma and general health. He died at 1:30 on the 28th of October 1708 at Kensington Palace after a battle with an unidentified lung disease. [45] He was buried on the 13th of November at Westminster Abbey. [46]Anne, as George lay dying, never left his side.[47] Sarah showed to Kensington uninvited, hand delivering a letter to Anne. She knelt at Anne's feet while George was dying, trying to comfort her old friend. After the Prince died she tried to convince Anne to return to St James's, believing it bad for Anne to stay so long with the body. The Queen responded to this by handing Sarah her pocketwatch and telling her not to return until a certain time. [48] Sarah believed it unhealthy to look upon items owned by, or images of, a departed loved one soon after their death. She order a portrait of George removed from the Queen's bedchamber, which caused Anne great upset. [49] She eventually locked herself away in grief, spending her time in small rooms at St. James's. She mourned severely, and made several orders to court. Her laidies in waiting were to only wear black, she had many brass fixtures oxidized black, stairs and windows were dressed in black flannel, and courtiers were ordered to oxidize and tarnish the nails in their coaches and chairs. [50] George was buried in a ceremony at night on the 14th of November 1708.\n\nMembers of the Whigs tried to leverage the Queen's personal life to force her into making changes in the cabinet. Instead of appointing a Whig as Lord Admiral, she took the role on herself. After a week and a half Anne relented and appointed the Earl of Pembroke. [51]\n\nIn January of 1714, Anne became seriously ill. She was rendered feverish and often unconcious, and had completely lost her ablity to walk. She recovered, but had fallen ill again by March. Her doctors could not agree on a cause for her disress. In July she had dismissed her Lord Treasurer, and some doctors said that the stress of cabinet business was a contributing factor to her illness. She suffered a stroke on the 30th of July, taking her ability to speak. Bedridden and ill, she died the morning of the 1st of August 1714 at Kensington Palace at 7:30 AM. Her death was slow and painful; her doctor (John Arbuthnot later writing to a colleague \"I believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her.\"[52]\n\nShe was interred following her funeral on the 24th of August 1714[53] in the Henry VII Chapel of Westminster Abbey[54][55], next to her husband[56] and nearby to her parents and children who are in their own vault.\n\n\"... as long as I live it shall be my endeavour to make my country and my friends easy and though those that come after me may be more cabable of so great a trust, as it has pleased God to put into my poor hands, I am sure they can never discharge it more faithfully than her that is sincerely your humble servant.\"\n\nTitles, Style, and Arms\n\nTitles\n\nQueen of England, Queen of Scotland, Queen of Ireland, Queen of France (Claimant)\n\nDuke of Lancaster (Customary), Duke of Normandy (Customary)\n\nAs George's wife, she was Duchess of Cumberland, Countess of Kendall, and Baroness Ockingham.\n\nStyle\n\nFrom birth to her marriage she was styled Her Highness the Lady Anne[8]\n\nFrom her marriage to her ascent she was styled Her Royal Highness the Princess Anne of Denmark [57]\n\nFrom ascent to the her death she was styled Her Majesty The Queen\n\nHer full style was Anne, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc. after the acts of union it was amended to \"...

Margaret Beaufort was the last Lady until Queen Alexandra was created a Lady of the Garter. This lead to the interesting scenario where female sovereigns Mary I, Elizabeth I, Mary II, Anne, and Victoria were not members of the garter until becoming Sovereign of that order.\n\nArms\n\nQueen Anne had four sets of arms throughout her life. The first were, as an unmarried woman the arms of her father.\n\nArms of Queen Anne as Princess of Denmark\n\nUpon her marriage she impaled the arms of her father on the arms of her husband.\n\nArms of Queen Anne as Queen of England, Scotland, France and Irleand (Before Union)\n\nAfter ascending the throne she used her own arms, without those of her husband. In a slight break of tradition, instead of using her father's motto, she used the motto of Elizabeth I \"Semper Eadem\" meaning \"Always the Same\" [58]\n\nArms of Queen Anne as Queen of Great Britain, France, and Ireland (Post Union)\n\nThe arms were amended upon the acts of union, impaling England and Scotland. She also adopted the below as a royal badge, representing England and Scotland flowering from the same stem.[58]\n\nRoyal Badge of Queen Anne (Post Union)\n\nResearch and Profile Notes\n\nThis profile is a labor of love, but raises an interesting question surrounding royalty and wikitree standard. The majority of vital records pertaining to historical royals are not public, or don't exist. The Chapel Royal at St James's where Anne was baptised does not hold any records. Anne was married there, or possibly in her bedroom according to some sources, so there is also a lacking vital record there. Of the three vital primary sources we use on wikitree only one exists; her burial. For people of such importance we have little reason to doubt details like the date of their baptism or marriage when so many secondary sources exist, but are biopgraphies written three hundred years after a person was born a truly reliable source?
