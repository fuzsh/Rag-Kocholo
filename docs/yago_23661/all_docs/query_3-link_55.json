        "text": "Anne of Cleves is the ex-wife of Henry VIII, the princess of Cleves and the former queen of England.\n\nInitially, Henry is very reluctant to marry Anne, claiming that she looks like a horse, which is very odd, given the fact that Anne is quite beautiful, but he eventually weds her and even sleep with her.\n\nAnne and Henry's marriage takes place three years after Jane Seymour's death, as Henry is still recovering from the death of his favourite wife. Catherine Howard catches Henry's eye; when he is still; with his fourth wife, Anne and eventually divorcing her, Henry marries Catherine Howard; but he and Anne of Cleves later become good friends.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nThree years after Jane Seymour's death, Henry is looking to wed again in episode 3.06. Thomas Cromwell, in a bid to steer the King towards the Protestant Reformation, advises him to marry princess Anne, who is sister of the wealthy Duke Wilhelm (William) of Cleves, ruler of a small German state near Holland. Since Catholic France and the Holy Roman Empire appear to be mustering for war against England, an alliance with the wealthy Protestant League which Cleves belongs to would be beneficial both for defense and the finalization of England's separatism from the Catholic Church. Henry is now (somewhat) over being widowed from Jane Seymour, and has some interest in remarriage. Although Jane had given him the coveted baby boy to become his Crown Prince, Henry figures siring more sons can do no harm, ergo \"the Heir and the Spare\" attitude of kings towards multiple sons.\n\nMore interested in a bride who will renew his youth and sexual vigor than in an alliance, Henry sends his courtiers to negotiate with the Duke and meet his sisters, and asks for portraits of them; Cromwell, determined to have the alliance with Cleves, orders the court painter Hans Holbein to make sure the portrait will draw Henry's interest. The match is finally agreed on and Duke Charles Brandon is sent to fetch her; she asks him to teach her about English mannerisms and how to please the King. Despite not supporting the match (due to his hatred for Cromwell) Charles makes friends with Anne and teaches her how to play cards, feeling sorry for her because of Henry's history with wives.\n\nViewing the portrait, Henry believes Anne is beautiful but upon finally seeing her in person in Episode 3.07, finds her not to his taste, more so for her meek personality. After arriving without announcement and catching her off-guard, he abruptly becomes put off from her for unexplained reasons; he has one of his characteristic temper tantrums later, screaming, \"She looks like a horse!\". Famously declaring \"I like her not!\", Henry orders Cromwell to call off the marriage, but Cromwell warns him that Spain and France are still gearing up for an invasion of England, and angering Duke Wilhelm could alienate a potential ally at the least, anger him into joining forces with Emperor Charles and King Francis at the worst. Reluctantly, Henry buckles under the pressure and goes through with the marriage; however, it remains unconsummated (due to a combination of Anne's revulsion at Henry's infected leg and Henry's unexplained repulsion at her figure, which fails to arouse him like Jane and Anne Boleyn's figure did). Anne, for her part, is mindful of Henry's reputation with previous wives, and desperately tries to please her new husband, to no avail; despite being urged on by Cromwell and Lady Margaret Bryan, she tells them that Henry is failing to consummate the marriage just as much as she is.\n\nBy the time it is clear that England is safe from invasion (Spain and France being at war with each other once again) Katherine Howard catches Henry's eye when Sir Francis Bryan brings her to court in the Season finale, and he quickly dispatches Anne of Cleves and marries Katherine just six months after the wedding, with Edward Seymour delivering the news of the annulment to her. Although she seems somewhat relieved, Anne is visibly hurt by the rejection, and many, including her fellow Lutheran Lady Jane Rochford, sympathize with her. Due to her willingness to agree to a divorce, Henry does not threaten Anne with beheading, and grants her a generous settlement (which includes lands, the title of the \"king's beloved sister\" and Hever Castle) it is Cromwell who really suffers from the annulment, however, the nobility band together and accuse him of setting the failed match up for his own political machinations, accusing him of treason and eventually sentencing him to death, without a trial.\n\nAnne has a pleasant and dignified personality that the English people in general approve, although she retains a strong German accent and does not always understand English customs, though she tries hard to learn them, she occasionally lapses back into German if she becomes very emotional. She is not very well-educated; but understands the world of royal politics and is eager to please her new countrymen and husband. Although she does not have as close a relationship with her step-daughter, Mary Tudor as Jane Seymour did, mainly because she is from a Lutheran family and Mary is a fundamentalist Catholic, they develop a growing respect for one another; especially; when she introduces Mary to her cousin, the handsome and charming Duke Philip of Bavaria. She also has a very pleasant relationship with Mary's younger half-sister, Elizabeth, viewing her as a daughter-like figure. Her reign as Queen Consort only lasts six months; by far the shortest of Henry's six wives.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nDespite being a dowager princess, Anne of Cleves is provided for generously since she does not protest the annulment; she continues to live a comfortable and dignified life in England. She spends most of her time living quietly at Hever- interestingly, the ancestral residence of one of her predecessors, Anne Boleyn. She often invites Mary and Elizabeth to visit her. Henry is pleased that she continues to maintain a strong friendship with both his daughters and shows her gratitude for her estates.\n\nAnne and Henry become very good friends and he even invites her to the palace for Christmas, although he only loves her platonically this time. But in the third episode of season 4, he sleeps with her, although he does not take her back as his wife. In the final episode, Henry's last flashback; includes a pleasant memory of him and Anne playing cards.\n\nAnne presents herself to Catherine Howard pleasantly enough. But Catherine is (initially) jealous of her - not because of looks; but; because of her previous marriage to Henry and; because Henry's children respect Anne far more than her. But once she and Anne spend sometime together, they become good friends.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n(to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk) \"Your Grace, I remember zat you vonce taught me to play cards. I am very grateful; as a result of your tuition, I have von a fortune!\"\n\n\"Lady Elizabeth is like a daughter to me... to have had her as a daughter, I tink, vould have been a greater honor zan ever having been Queen.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty should be very proud of your daughters, both of zem. Zey do you a great credit. The Lady Mary is... very serious and religious, but she is very clever. Like some vomen, she likes to hide her intelligence... but the Lady Elizabeth, she cannot hide her intelligence! She vill be a great lady, I tink... if God so vills it.\"\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
