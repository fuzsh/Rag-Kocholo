        "text": "1934 British royal wedding\n\nWedding of Prince George and Princess MarinaDate29 November 1934; 89 years ago ( )VenueWestminster Abbey\n\nBuckingham PalaceLocationLondon, EnglandParticipantsPrince George, Duke of Kent\n\nPrincess Marina of Greece and Denmark\n\nThe wedding of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark took place on Thursday, 29 November 1934, at Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Kent was the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary (née Princess Victoria Mary of Teck), while Princess Marina was the youngest daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia.[1][2] The couple were second cousins through mutual descent from King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nAs Princess Marina's cousin, Prince Philip, renounced his Greek and Danish titles prior to marrying Prince George's niece, then Princess Elizabeth, this is the most recent example of a marriage between a British prince or princess and a titled member of a foreign dynasty.\n\nEngagement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe engagement between the Duke of Kent and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark was announced on 28 August 1934.[3][4] The news came as a surprise to the British public. The couple began courting after reconnecting at the home of Princess Marina's brother-in-law, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, on Lake Bohinj in present-day Slovenia.[3] The Duke presented Princess Marina with a platinum ring with a 7-carat square Kashmir sapphire with two baguette diamonds on either side.[5] A first for a royal couple, they spoke to Movietone News shortly after announcing their engagement.[3][6]\n\nPrincess Marina and her parents arrived in Dover on board the ferry TSS Canterbury on 22 November.[7] The Princess and her parents, accompanied by her fiancé, travelled to London where they were met at Victoria Station by the King and Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of York.\n\nOn the eve of the wedding, the couple and their parents attended a performance of the play Theatre Royal by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber at the Lyric Theatre.[8]\n\nWedding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Duke of Kent and Princess Marina were married first in an Anglican service according to the Book of Common Prayer conducted by Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by William Foxley Norris, Dean of Westminster. A second Greek Orthodox service was performed by Germanos Strenopoulos, Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain, in the Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace.[9]\n\nAttendants\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Duke of Kent was supported by his two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. Princess Marina was attended by eight bridesmaids:[10][11]\n\nPrincess Irene of Greece and Denmark (30), daughter of King Constantine I and Queen Sophia of the Hellenes, thus a paternal cousin of the bride\n\nPrincess Katherine of Greece and Denmark (21), daughter of King Constantine I and Queen Sophia of the Hellenes, thus a paternal cousin of the bride\n\nPrincess Eugénie of Greece and Denmark (24), daughter of Prince and Princess George of Greece and Denmark, thus a paternal cousin of the bride\n\nGrand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia (25), daughter of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna of Russia, thus a maternal cousin of the bride\n\nPrincess Juliana of the Netherlands (25), daughter of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrick of the Netherlands\n\nLady Iris Mountbatten (14), daughter of the Marquess and Marchioness of Carisbrooke, thus a paternal cousin, once removed, of the groom\n\nPrincess Elizabeth of York (8), daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, thus a niece of the groom\n\nLady Mary Cambridge (10), daughter of the Marquess and Marchioness of Cambridge, thus a maternal cousin, once removed, of the groom\n\nAttire\n\n[edit]\n\nMarina's wedding dress was designed by Edward Molyneux, who had worked with her previously.[12] The dress was made from white silk and silver lamé brocade, with a raised English rose design.[13] The dress's simplicity was praised in Vogue: \"the sum of that simple perfection which distinguishes her whole Molyneux trousseau, and which only a fine personal taste could have achieved.\"[14]\n\nThe Duke of Kent wore ceremonial day dress of the Royal Navy with the insignia of the Order of the Garter, Order of St Michael and St George and the Royal Victorian Order.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to the service, works by Bach, Handel and Elgar were played on the organ. During the arrival of the groom, Trumpet Tune and Airs by Henry Purcell was played. The bride walked down the aisle to Sir Hubert Parry's bridal march from The Birds.[15] Hymns sung during the service include \"Praise, my soul, the King of heaven.\" Ernest Bullock composed a new anthem specially for the wedding.[16] The ceremony finished with Felix Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\"\n\nGuests\n\n[edit]\n\nRelatives of the groom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe King and Queen, the groom's parents\n\nThe Prince of Wales, the groom's brother\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of York, the groom's brother and sister-in-law\n\nPrincess Elizabeth of York, the groom's niece\n\nPrincess Margaret Rose of York, the groom's niece\n\nThe Princess Royal and the Earl of Harewood, the groom's sister and brother-in-law\n\nThe Duke of Gloucester, the groom's brother\n\nPrincess Victoria, the groom's paternal aunt\n\nThe Queen and King of Norway, the groom's paternal aunt and uncle\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed\n\nThe Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the groom's paternal great-uncle\n\nPrince and Princess Arthur of Connaught, the groom's paternal first cousin once removed and paternal first cousin\n\nThe Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, the groom's maternal uncle and aunt (also paternal first cousin once removed)\n\nPrincess Beatrice, the groom's paternal great-aunt\n\nThe Marquess of Carisbrooke's family:\n\nLady Iris Mountbatten, the groom's paternal second cousin\n\nLady Mary Cambridge, the groom's maternal first cousin once removed\n\nRelatives of the bride\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince and Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, the bride's parents\n\nPrincess and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the bride's sister and brother-in-law\n\nPrince Nicholas of Yugoslavia, the bride’s nephew\n\nThe Countess and Count of Törring-Jettenbach, the bride's sister and brother-in-law\n\nKing George II of the Hellenes, the bride's paternal first cousin\n\nPrincess Irene of Greece and Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin\n\nPrincess Katherine of Greece and Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin\n\nPrince and Princess George of Greece and Denmark, the bride's paternal uncle and aunt\n\nPrince Peter of Greece and Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin\n\nPrincess Eugénie of Greece and Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin\n\nThe Hereditary Grand Duchess and Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, the bride’s paternal first cousin and her husband, the groom’s paternal second cousin\n\nPrince Philip of Greece and Denmark,[17] the bride's paternal first cousin\n\nPrince Christopher of Greece and Denmark, the bride's paternal uncle\n\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna of Russia, the bride's maternal uncle and aunt (also the groom's paternal first cousin once removed)\n\nGrand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia, the bride's maternal first cousin\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, the bride’s maternal first cousin\n\nPrincess Catherine Alexandrovna Yurievskaya,[18] the bride's maternal half-grandaunt\n\nForeign royal guests\n\n[edit]\n\nThe King and Queen of Denmark and Iceland, the bride and groom's mutual first cousin once removed, and his wife, the bride's maternal first cousin once removed\n\nPrince Valdemar of Denmark, the bride and groom's mutual granduncle\n\nThe Count of Flanders, the groom's paternal third cousin once removed\n\nPrincess Juliana of the Netherlands, the bride's maternal half-first cousin once removed\n\nThe Duke of Östergötland, the bride and groom’s mutual paternal second cousin\n\nInfante Juan of Spain, the groom’s paternal second cousin\n\nOther notable guests\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Rt Hon.
