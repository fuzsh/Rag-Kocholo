        "text": "William H. Gates III, a lawyer and philanthropist who grew up and began his career in Bremerton and was best known as the father of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, has died at 94.\n\nGates, a 1943 graduate of Bremerton High School, died peacefully Monday at his beach home on Hood Canal from Alzheimer's disease, the family announced Tuesday.\n\nIn an obituary the family credited the patriarch with a \"deep commitment to social and economic equity,\" noting that he was responsible for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's first efforts to improve global health as well as his advocacy for progressive taxation, especially unsuccessful efforts to pass a state income tax on the wealthy in Washington.\n\n\"My dad's wisdom, generosity, empathy, and humility had a huge influence on people around the world,\" Bill Gates wrote in a tribute.\n\nGates was born in Bremerton in 1925. His father and grandfather, the first two to bear the name William Henry Gates, had opened and run a furniture store, long located at the corner of Sixth Street and Pacific Avenue. Displaying a precocious ingenuity, Gates at 13 established with a friend a newspaper called \"The Weekly Receiver\" complete with ads and a 10-cent-a-month subscription fee, his sister, Merridy Williams recounted in Fredi Perry's \"Bremerton and PSNY.\"\n\nAfter graduation from Bremerton High School, Gates attended the University of Washington for a year before attending officer candidate school at the Army's Fort Benning in Georgia. Following World War II, Gates finished his education, passed the bar and became a law partner of Merrill Wallace in Bremerton.\n\nGates married Mary Maxwell, a classmate at the UW and a Seattlite, in 1951. According to Perry's book, the couple had three children, Kristianne, Elizabeth and William Henry Gates IV, who would go on to found Microsoft. After Mary's death, Gates married Mimi Gardner, who at the time was director of the Seattle Art Museum.\n\nGates was instrumental in the creation and strategic direction of what's now called the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, among the largest philanthropies in the world.\n\nGates often attended a longtime class reunion for Bremerton High School, sitting with his friend, longtime journalist Frank Wetzel. Wetzel died earlier this year.\n\nHis son revealed Gates had Alzheimer's while on the \"Today\" show in 2018. His last visit with his classmates of Bremerton High School was in August 2018.\n\nReporter Josh Farley contributed to this story."
