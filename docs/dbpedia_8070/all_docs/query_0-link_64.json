Purpose This year, the Committee on Science and Technology will celebrate its 50th Anniversary. On Wednesday, March 12, 2008, the House Committee on Science and Technology will hold a hearing to highlight this occasion and receive testimony from Bill Gates, the Chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, to discuss our country's technological advances over the past 50 years, the current state of our country's competitiveness, and a look ahead to the challenges we face. 2. Witness Mr. William H. Gates, Chairman, Microsoft Corporation 3. Brief Overview Following World War II and throughout much of the 20th century, the United States became a world leader in science and innovation, and economic indicators demonstrated that the United States offered a high standard of living to its citizens. In fact, the U.S. economy grew substantially, and economists estimate that about half of U.S. economic growth was the result of technological innovation. In the 1990's however, during a period in which the United States was known as the world's lone ``superpower,'' a number of indicators suggested that U.S. prosperity was diminishing. In 1990, the United States had a trade surplus in high-technology products of $54 billion. That surplus turned into a trade deficit of $50 billion by 2004. A number of iconic American companies moved assets, jobs, and ownership overseas. And American students performed poorly in several international assessments of math and science achievement. On October 12, 2005, The National Academies released a report on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century entitled Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future. The Gathering Storm report quickly became influential in promoting a national agenda on innovation and competitiveness. Ultimately, recommendations included in the Gathering Storm report, as well as some of the suggestions included in the President's American Competitiveness Initiative, became the basis for legislation signed into law last August--the America COMPETES Act. This legislation, authored by this committee, makes a significant commitment to our country's future by investing in math and science education and federal research. In what is likely to be his final congressional testimony before devoting the majority of his time to his philanthropic work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates will appear before the Science and Technology Committee to share his thoughts on efforts needed to further strengthen our country's competitiveness in the global marketplace, discuss what policies are needed to encourage innovation, and address the role of technology in our country's economic growth. The Committee looks forward to hearing the unique perspective of Mr. Gates, both as Chairman of Microsoft and as Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, on strengthening our country's competitiveness in the global marketplace. More specifically, the Committee expects Mr. Gates to address issues crucial to our country's competitiveness including a commitment to math and science education, federal investments in research and development, policies that encourage innovation, and the role of technology in our economic growth. Chairman Gordon. This hearing will come to order. Welcome all. Welcome to today's hearing entitled Competitiveness and Innovation on the Committee's 50th Anniversary With Bill Gates, Chairman of Microsoft. In November of 1957, as a young boy, as a very young boy, I remember looking out into the sky and seeing the blinking red dot passing overhead that struck fear into countless Americans. The launch of Sputnik and the beginning of the space race began a period of unprecedented investment and research in math and science education in this country resulting in the development of new technologies and the advancement of innovation. During the next 50 years, the United States became a world leader in science and technology, education, research, and most importantly innovation and entrepreneurship. These efforts fueled our economy and allowed each generation of Americans to inherit a better standard of living than their parents, and as the father of a seven-year-old, I fear that our children could be the first generation of Americans that do not inherit a living standard better than their parents, a reverse of the American dream. And let me explain why. Sputnik showed us that we were not the world's technological leader. Today, with rapid economic and technological advances in other countries, I fear we are now on the cusp of another Sputnik moment. I fear that our country has coasted on the investment made for the last 50 years, or as my father would say, we have been eating our seed corn. Now is the time to act, and I believe this committee has an important role to play in helping bring our country back as a technological leader in the world. Soon after the launch of Sputnik in March of 1958, this committee was established to face the challenges presented by the space age. Although the threat is different, the challenges today remain the same to secure our country's international prominence in the areas of innovation and technological development. The witness before us today needs little introduction. Bill Gates embodies both the American spirit of innovation and the theological virtue of charity. He has built arguably the most successful technological company in the world and then has turned his financial success into a gift for our society. On this occasion, the 50th anniversary of this committee, as we reflect back on the technological advances of the past and look ahead to the challenges facing our country's competitiveness in the world, I can think of no other witness better suited and well-positioned to help share his insights with this committee. As I have said before, I am very pleased of the work done by this committee over the past year to develop and shepherd through Congress the America COMPETES Act. This legislation was a necessary and important first step in making the commitments needed to bring our country back to technological prominence, and though the passing of the COMPETES Act authorization was a great success, now we have to follow up and be sure that it is fully funded. I look forward to hearing Mr. Gates on other efforts needed to rebuild our strength and again lead the world for another 50 years. It is my hope that we will continue to look for ways to embrace the global marketplace and not shy away from the challenges we face. Before I conclude, I want to quickly acknowledge the presence of two Members of the House and past Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Bob Walker on the end over there and Sherry Boehlert, welcome back. And we have another Chairman, Mr. Sensenbrenner, with his canine. There is Mr. Sensenbrenner up on the wall there. Jim Sensenbrenner is still a Member of our committee. I am pleased that you are able to join us today and help us to commemorate this 50th Anniversary of the Committee. With that, I would like to now recognize Mr. Hall for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:] Prepared Statement of Chairman Bart Gordon In November of 1957, as a young boy, I remember looking into the sky and seeing the blinking red dot pass overhead that struck fear into countless Americans.

Soon after the launch of Sputnik, in March of 1958, this committee was established to face the challenges presented by the Space Age. Though the threat is different, the challenges today remain the same-- to secure our country's international dominance in the areas of innovation and technology development. The witness before us today needs little introduction. Bill Gates embodies both the American spirit of innovation and the theological virtue of charity. He has built arguably the most successful technology company in the world and then has turned his financial success into his gift to our society.

As I have said before, I am proud of the work done by this committee over the past year to develop and shepherd through Congress the America COMPETES Act. This legislation was a necessary and important first step in making the commitments needed to bring our country back to technological prominence. And though COMPETES was a great success, our work is far from done. I look forward to hearing from Mr. Gates on other efforts needed to rebuild our strength and again lead the world for another 50 years. It is my hope that we will continue to look for ways to embrace the global marketplace and not shy away from the challenges we face. Before I conclude, I wanted to quickly acknowledge the presence of two former Members of the House and past Chairmen of this committee-- Bob Walker and Sherry Boehlert. I am pleased that you were both able to join us today and help us commemorate the 50th anniversary of our committee. Mr. Hall. Mr. Chairman, I thank you, and of course I thank you, Mr. Gates, for joining us this morning to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Science and Technology Committee, this committee, and I want to also take the time to say hello to my good friends and former colleagues, Bob Walker and Sherry Boehlert and of course our very able Committee Chairman, Mr. Sensenbrenner. You know, men and women of America have always stepped forward when the challenges were great. Henry Ford introduced his assembly line innovation with the first Model T's, and men like Henry Kaiser picked up on it and perfected production techniques during World War II that allowed us to out-produce the enemy, producing one cargo ship every 30 days, and one ship in a record four days. And when polio stalked our nation and iron lungs claimed our children, Jonas Salk appeared. We are honored today, Mr. Chairman, with one who graces our committee room who beat down the doors that shut out imagination and brought about a revolution in communication which changed the world. His foundation is now revolutionizing an assault on malaria, hunger, ignorance, and illiteracy around the world, and let me tell you, we are really honored by your presence. I think it is important for us to take this time and reflect on the Committee's accomplishments over the last half- a-century as well as explore why scientific enterprise and the work of the Committee are just as important to the United States today as they were in the Cold War when the Committee was created. The Soviet launch of Sputnik on October 4, 1957, was a wakeup call to Americans, and I remember the feeling of going out to the backyard at night and watching the blinking lights slowly cross the Texas sky. Every night that blinking light taunted us that America was no longer the most technologically advanced country in the world. The message was loud and clear that for the first time, the United States had to play catch up and catch up we did. In 1958, under the leadership of Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn, whose Texas 4th District I now gladly represent, the Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration was created. Shortly thereafter, the Committee created NASA and chartered a permanent House Committee on Science and Astronautics, our forerunner. About a decade later, the United States landed on the Moon, proving without a doubt that America was once again the world's technological leader. The Science and Technology Committee has come a long way in 50 years, taking on some of America's biggest challenges, but we continue to be challenged. Experts have been churning out report after report citing the United States as falling behind other countries in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education as well as long-term basic research funding. For these reasons, the President and a Republican-led Congress made its priority to make the United States more economically competitive by promoting American innovation and STEM education. We have continued that trend in this Congress, and I am proud to be a supporter of the America COMPETES Act, which the President signed into law last year and which calls for a doubling of basic research funding for several agencies within our jurisdiction within a decade. America COMPETES has been the Committee's top priority, but we played a part in many other important sectors. Research into advanced technologies can help prepare first responders, secure our borders, and develop safe nanotechnology-based products, all the while as Mr. Gates exemplified, improving the economy and creating skilled jobs. Science then forms good policy, and I am proud to have been a part of the Science and Technology Committee for 27 years doing just that. From this seat I have seen first-hand America's innovative capabilities, and I know we can always do better. America's preeminence in the global community depends on what all of us do today, each of us, all levels of government. Academia, parents, students, and industry have an important role to keep and also to play in keeping America competitive and ahead of the innovation curve. I look forward to hearing your testimony, Mr. Gates. I understand that both Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are doing wonderful things, particularly with regards to STEM education. I am especially eager to hear more about the 35 secondary STEM schools and regional resource centers you have established across Texas in partnership with the Michael and Susan Bell Foundation, the Communities Foundation of Texas, the Governor, and the Texas Education Agency. I hope you plan to extend some of these terrific efforts to reach children in K to 8 grades as well. I would suggest that perhaps you might want to take a look at what the Martha and Josh Morris Math and Engineering Elementary School in my district is accomplishing in this regard to capture the attention and imagination of our youth. This committee will be holding a field hearing there in May to show how this local effort and how well as a partnership such as the ones you describe can work and serve as models for the rest of the country. Our Chairman will lead that visit. Again, welcome. I look forward to hearing from you. I yield back my time. Chairman Gordon. Thank you, Mr. Hall. I look forward to going down and joining you in Texas. If there are additional Members that would like to make statements, you can--written statements, opening statements can be made a part of the record at this point. [The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Jerry F. Costello Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for overseeing this budget hearing and thank Mr. Gates for coming to testify before the Committee today. Your philanthropic work with the Gates Foundation has certainly been admirable and I thank you for your dedication to and commitment to the global community. With the COMPETES bill, the Committee took an important step to advance the goal of increasing our nation's competitiveness and investing in our children's math and science education. The Committee recognizes in order to truly remain competitive for the next fifty years as we have over the past half century, we must make a serious commitment to invest in research and development. This commitment will necessitate a partnership between the State and Federal Government and the private sector. Your work at Microsoft and the Gates Foundation is an example of exactly that. I am concerned, Mr. Chairman, about remaining competitive in a global market and securing technology jobs for Americans who have invested the time in professional training and degree programs. Too often, I hear from constituents in my district who have found themselves out of work due to out-sourcing, closing factories, and a failing economy. I am interested in hearing your thoughts on these issues, Mr. Gates, as your experience guiding a company on the cutting edge of technology production for thirty years and your more recent position of co-chair of your foundation make you an excellent witness for our hearing today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for my time. [The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today's hearing is important to help us better understand how we, as a nation, can secure our position as a leader in science and technology for the next 50 years and beyond. As we celebrate the Science and Technology Committee's 50th Anniversary, I am pleased to have Mr. Bill Gates to testify as a world renowned innovator in technology and philanthropist in health, education, and poverty. As other countries challenge the United States to stay at the forefront in technology and innovation, I know that it is imperative to educate the next generation in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Mr. Gates has been able to fund the education of many low-income students that would not have had the opportunity to attend college otherwise. The $38.7 billion Gates Foundation endowment is, and will continue to, help young people in need. Children will have a fair chance to grow up less burdened by disease. Students living in poverty will have better access to books, stimulating teachers, Internet connections, and other tools to help them compete in the global marketplace. Many of these students who are minorities and women will go on to study in STEM fields. This mission has been a passion of mine over the years. The Gates Foundation is doing all of these activities, and more. The size and scale of it is comparable to federal investments in non-defense research and development. As a strong supporter of the America COMPETES Act, that serves the purpose of strengthening science education and research and improving our technology enterprise, I can say that the Microsoft Corporation has certainly done its part to keep America competitive in the global market. With pioneers like Mr. Gates, this nation will continue to make technological advances for the next 50 years and longer. While we make such advances, it is my desire to see more programs like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill Gates is a shining example of innovation and humanitarianism at its best. Again, welcome, Mr. Gates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman Gordon. And now, on this occasion, the Committee's 50th anniversary, I believe it is particularly relevant to receive the thoughts and ideas of one of the country's truly innovative thinkers. After founding Microsoft in 1975, Mr. Gates has built the company into one of the world's leading software and technological companies. His company's innovations have changed the way we work, the way we process information, and the way we learn. His vision and his accomplishments are truly what can make America an even better country. Each of us would be hard pressed to have a day pass that we did not use a Microsoft application in the course of our daily routine, but more importantly, Bill Gates is uniquely positioned to share with the Committee the challenges of building a strong, well-educated workforce and the benefits that technology can provide. Moreover, Mr. Gates has taken to heart the adage from those who much is given, much is expected. With the great financial success Mr. Gates has realized, he and his wife, Melinda, have undertaken the daunting challenge of making our world a better place by using the same entrepreneurial spirit and his to conscientiously give away the majority of his fortune while encouraging others to similarly endow to do the same. Again, we are very pleased to have you and look forward to your testimony. At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Baird, for some brief additional introductory remarks. Mr. Baird. Mr. Gates, I just wanted to, as a proud Washingtonian, let you know how much we admire what you have done for our State and our world and your leadership on science and a committee that is so proud of what you have done and what you are doing for the future in the areas just mentioned. Welcome to the Science Committee, and thank you for helping us to commemorate our 50th anniversary. Chairman Gordon. Mr. Gates, I told you we are a bipartisan Committee following Sherry Boehlert's good example, and we are fortunate to also have a Democrat and Republican from Washington State, and Mr. Reichert is recognized for any comments. Mr. Reichert. There are actually three Republicans in Washington State. I have backup. Chairman Gordon. On this committee. Mr. Reichert. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Gates, thank you so much for being here today. We are excited to hear your testimony, and I just want to take a moment to say how proud I am to have you here personally as a constituent testifying before our committee, and also, I am proud to have Microsoft in Washington State and am especially proud to have Microsoft in the 8th District which I am privileged to represent. Through your leadership, Microsoft has remained not only a leading innovator but also a beacon for thousands of small businesses across the country. That American dream is alive and well, and that vision of determination, great success, can come from modest beginnings. Microsoft is truly an engine of our nation's economic growth, and your company and your philanthropy continue to make tremendous contributions to Washington State, to our country, and to the global community. These are challenging times, and I look forward to hearing your perspectives on immigration, math and science, foreign aid, and other critical areas we need to improve so that America can remain a leader in this increasingly kind of competitive global economy. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Chairman Gordon. Thank you, Mr. Reichert. Let me mention to our Members, and I know we don't have a full delegation here because they knew we were having votes on the Floor. Unfortunately, our bipartisan spirit does not move over or flow over to the Floor, so I think we are going to have a little bit of a contentious morning. We don't want that to stand in the way of this good testimony. With Ralph Hall's concurrence, we have some ground rules here. One, Mr. Gates has got to leave right at 12:00, and so we are going to have to cut off at 12:00. The second thing is what I would like for us to do during these votes is to sort of alternate. I want to keep the hearing going, and so some of you might go down and vote and come back and ask questions, some can stay here, but we want to keep the proceedings going. Mr. Baird? Mr. Baird. Mr. Chairman, in the interest of most of us can hear Mr. Gates, is it possible that we pair in a sense? I know that we, basically, that we keep even numbers on this side so that we don't affect the Floor tally in any way. There are eight of us I think on our side of the aisle. You know, basically match it up in some way. Chairman Gordon. I think folks will want to go vote, but what we will try to do is we will ask the staff maybe on each side to send half down and ask the other half to stay and then reverse. We will do it the best we can, and I am sure that it will work out. Mr. Hall. Kind of an assembly line. Chairman Gordon. Right. We will now begin the questions, and the Chairman recognizes himself. Oh, I guess if we have a rock star, we should let him rock. So, Mr. Gates, you are now recognized. STATEMENT OF MR. WILLIAM H. GATES, CHAIRMAN, MICROSOFT CORPORATION; CO-CHAIR, BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION Mr. Gates. Thank you. It is a privilege to be here. Chairman Gordon, Ranking Member Hall, Members of the Committee. I am Bill Gates and I am the Chairman of Microsoft. With my wife, Melinda, I am also the founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and it is an honor to be here to commemorate your 50th anniversary. During these 50 years, incredible advances in science and technology have revolutionized the way people around the world communicate, run businesses, find information, and much more. I am optimistic that over the decades ahead, information technology will continue to transform business productivity and have a profound positive impact on our day-to-day lives. It will also help us address important global challenges related to education, health care, energy, and other issues. Many of the key advances of these 50 years were pioneered by researchers working in U.S. universities and for U.S. companies. United States' preeminence in science and technology and this nation's unmatched ability to turn innovation into thriving business have long been the engine of job creation and the source of our global economic leadership. I know we all want the United States to continue to be the world's center for innovation, but our position is at risk. There are many reasons for this, but two stand out. First, U.S. companies face a severe shortfall of scientists and engineers with expertise to develop the next generation of breakthroughs. Second, we don't invest enough as a nation in the basic research needed to derive long-term innovation. If we don't reverse these trends, our competitive advantage will erode. Our ability to create new high-paying jobs will suffer. Addressing these issues will take commitment, leadership, and partnership on the part of government, private, and non- profit sectors. Let me start by saying that business has a critical role to play. The private sector must contribute to building a workforce that has the skills to innovate and compete. That is why Microsoft is committed to improving educational quality and encouraging young people to study math and science through programs like Partners in Learning which has reached more than 80,000 teachers and three million students. Non-profit organizations also have an important role to play. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for its part has invested almost $2 billion to help establish or improve nearly 2,000 U.S. high schools and provided over $1.7 billion for college scholarship programs. But organizations like these cannot address the issues alone. Only government has the resources to effect change on a broad scale. If this nation is to continue to be the global center of innovation, Congress, the current Administration, and the next president must act decisively. It starts with education. Today, graduation rates for our high school students and their level of achievement in math and science rank at the bottom among industrialized nations. Thirty percent of ninth- graders and nearly half of African-American and Hispanic ninth- graders do not graduate on time. Fewer than 40 percent of high school students graduate ready to attend college. As a nation, we must have a fundamental goal that every child in the United States should graduate from high school prepared for college, career, and life. To achieve this, we need metrics that reflect what students learn and the progress they make. Touch metrics may be difficult to develop, but they provide the essential foundation for deciding which programs best improve outcomes in our public schools. Better data will also help us identify the most effective teachers and adopt better policies for recruiting, training, and retaining these teachers for our public schools. If the problem of high schools is one of quality, the issue at our universities is quantity. Our higher education system doesn't produce enough top scientists and engineers to meet the need of the U.S. economy. According to the bureau of labor statistics, we are adding over 100,000 computer-related jobs each year, but only 15,000 students earned Bachelor's degrees in computer science and engineering in 2006 and that number continues to drop. One of the most important steps Congress can take to address this problem is to fully fund the America COMPETES Act. Introduced by this committee, this Act would significantly increase funding for the National Science Foundation's Graduate Fellowship and Teacher Training Scholarship Programs. As bad as the disparity between supply and demand looks, these numbers understate the severity of the problem. Today our university computer science and engineering programs include large numbers of foreign students. In fact, the Science and Engineering Indicators Report showed that 59 percent of doctoral degrees and 43 percent of all higher ed degrees in engineering and computer science are awarded to temporary residents. But our current immigration policies make it increasingly difficult for these students to remain in the United States. At a time when talent is the key to economic success, it makes no sense to educate people in our universities, often subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, and then insist that they return home. United States' innovation has always been based in part on the contribution of foreign-born scientists and researchers. For example, a recent survey conducted by several universities showed that between 1995 and 2005 firms with at least one foreign-born founder created 450,000 new U.S. jobs. Moreover, as a recent study shows, for every H-1B holder that technology companies hire, five additional jobs are created around that person. But as you know, our immigration system makes it very difficult for U.S. firms to hire highly skilled foreign workers. Last year at Microsoft, we were unable to obtain H-1B visas for over a third of our foreign-born candidates. An example is the story of Arpit Guglani, a talented young man who graduated from the University of Toronto. He graduated in 2006, and we offered him a job but he has not been able to obtain an H-1B visa for two straight years and we were forced to rescind his job offer. He is exactly the type of science and engineering graduate that we need to continue to add jobs and drive innovation. There are a number of steps that Congress and the White House should take to address this problem, including extending the period that foreign students can work here after graduation. Increasing the current cap on H-1B visas, clearing a path to permanent residency for high-skilled, foreign-born employees, eliminating per-country green card limits, and significantly increasing the annual number of green cards. I want to emphasize that to address the shortage of scientists and engineers we must do both, reform our education system and our immigration policies. If we don't, American companies simply will not have the talent they need to innovate and compete. Finally, we must increase our investment in basic scientific research. In the past, federally funded research helped spark industries that today provide hundreds of thousands of jobs. Even though we know that basic research drives economic progress, real federal spending on research has fallen since 2005. I urge Congress to increase funding for basic research by 10 percent annually for the next seven years. I fully support Congress' efforts to fund basic research through the America COMPETES Act. I believe the country is at a crossroads. For decades, innovation has been our engine of prosperity. Now, economic progress depends more than ever on innovation. Without leadership from Congress and the President to implement policies like those I have outlined today and the commitment of the private sector to do its part, the center of progress can shift to other nations that are more committed to the pursuit of innovation. I want to conclude by again congratulating the Committee on its 50th anniversary and to thank you for this opportunity to share my perspective. I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have on these topics. [The prepared statement of Mr. Gates follows:] Prepared Statement of William H. Gates Chairman Gordon, Ranking Member Hall, Members of the Committee, my name is Bill Gates and I am Chairman of Microsoft Corporation. I am also a Co-Chair, with my wife Melinda and my father Bill, Sr., of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is an honor for me to speak here today on the occasion of the Committee's 50th anniversary. Today I am here to highlight the gathering threat to U.S. preeminence in science and technology innovation, and to propose a four-part plan that I believe will help us maintain our position as the world's innovation leader. During the last 50 years, the world has witnessed truly revolutionary advances in science and technology. We as a nation can take pride in knowing that American scientists, researchers, and entrepreneurs have been at the forefront of many of these advances. Our unmatched ability to turn new ideas in science and technology into thriving businesses has been the engine of growth and job creation that has made our economy among the most dynamic and competitive in the world. This committee can also take pride in knowing that it is responsible for many of the key federal policies that provided the foundation for U.S. technology leadership. Through its efforts, the Committee has shaped our national approach and guided our investments in areas such as space travel, aviation, computing and networking, biotechnology, energy, education, and many other fields. I share this committee's deep faith in the power and importance of technology. Having spent the last 30 years with one of the world's leading software companies, I am amazed every day at the potential for technology to create new opportunities and improve people's lives. This view is shared by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on finding innovative solutions that can help improve health care and education, and reduce poverty. As rapidly as science and technology have advanced over the past 50 years, I believe these advances will pale in comparison to the innovations of the next 50 years, or even the next 10 years. In many ways, the incredible advances of the past few decades have really just laid the foundation for much more profound change in the years ahead. There are about a billion PCs in use around the world today. The number of people who use cell phones is close to three billion. About 300 million people are connected to broadband Internet. Software permeates every sector of the economy and almost every aspect of our day-to-day lives. The implications of these developments are profound. Computing and software are increasingly available everywhere: in the office and the home; in our cars; in stores, restaurants, and public spaces. In the future, we will be able to tap into computing capabilities on an increasingly broad range of devices. We will have instant access to all of our personal information--and all of the content, information, and computing power we want or need--at any time and from any location. These changes will have a dramatic impact on business. Not only will productivity and efficiency continue to improve, but we are moving closer and closer to the time when information systems will have the flexibility, intelligence, and self-awareness to adapt automatically as business conditions change. These systems will deliver precisely the information, services, and applications that employees and customers need, when and where they need them. These changes will also have a profound impact on the way people live--the way we share experiences and communicate with the people we care about; the way we preserve memories of past events; the way we access entertainment; the way we learn; and how we interact with our communities and our governments. These advances also have the potential to help us address some of the most pressing global challenges that we face today. In education, information technology can help us eliminate some of the barriers that prevent us from providing a high-quality education to everyone; barriers such as lack of access to great educational content and relevant curricula, a shortage of effective teachers, and a paucity of data that would help us improve student performance. My involvement in education initiatives at both Microsoft and at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has shown me the great things that information technology can do to improve education. One of the Foundation's earliest initiatives, which it undertook in partnership with Microsoft, was its U.S. Libraries Program. The goal of this program was simple: to ensure that every person in the United States who could reach a public library would have access to the Internet. Today, 99 percent of U.S. public libraries offer free computer and Internet services, and some 14 million people regularly use these services. In my view, the U.S. Libraries Program is a great example of how the public and private sectors can work together to use the power of information technology to address important social needs. In health care, information technology can reduce the cost of health care and help ensure that patients receive the most effective care possible. New technologies, such as Microsoft's HealthVault, are giving people simple, secure ways to manage their family's health information and providing the ability to control who can access that information. These technologies put patients at the center of the health care system by giving them the tools to create a complete picture of their health and allowing them, for the first time, to make fully informed treatment decisions. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, for its part, has committed more than $6 billion to organizations worldwide to promote innovation in access to health care, including research to develop new tools to fight diseases that cause the greatest amount of illness and death in developing countries. For example, the Foundation has provided over $250 million to support collaborative research between a not-for-profit and the pharmaceutical industry aimed at developing a preventative malaria vaccine. Late last year, the Foundation issued a challenge grant to Rotary International: if Rotary raises $100 million in the fight to eradicate polio, the Foundation will match it, dollar for dollar. The Foundation also recently provided funding to support the International Medical Corps' mobile clinics and other public health efforts in Kenya, and has committed more than $650 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. With initiatives like the Product Red campaign, the Global Fund is paving the way for business to join with government on these issues. These efforts, together with those of countless other companies and institutions, hold tremendous promise for alleviating existing inequities in global health care. Computing and software will also play an increasingly central role in scientific research. We are rapidly moving into an era of data- centric computational science in which researchers across a wide range of disciplines routinely use software and computers as essential tools for investigation and collaboration. The ability to use computers to model complex systems is transforming the way we learn about everything from genomics and biosciences to physics and astronomy. In the future, scientific computing will play a profoundly important role in advances that will help us treat diseases, address climate change, and confront many other critical issues. * * * * * As I hope these remarks reflect, I am optimistic about the potential for technology to help us find new ways to improve people's lives and tackle important challenges. I am less optimistic, however, that the United States will continue to remain a global leader in technology innovation. While America's innovation heritage is unparalleled, the evidence is mounting that we are failing to make the investments in our young people, our workers, our scientific research infrastructure, and our economy that will enable us to retain our global innovation leadership. In particular, I believe that there are two urgent reasons why we should all be deeply concerned that our advantages in science and technology innovation are in danger of slipping away. First, we face a critical shortfall of skilled scientists and engineers who can develop new breakthrough technologies. Second, the public and private sectors are no longer investing in basic research and development (R&D) at the levels needed to drive long-term innovation. If the United States truly wants to secure its global leadership in technology innovation, we must, as a nation, commit to a strategy for innovation excellence--a set of initiatives and policies that will provide the foundation for American competitive strength in the years ahead. Such a strategy cannot succeed without a serious commitment from--and partnership between--both the public and private sectors. It will also need to be flexible and dynamic enough to respond to rapid changes in the global economy. I believe this strategy must place top priority on achieving four fundamental goals: 1. Strengthening educational opportunities, so that America's students and workers have the skills they need to succeed in the technology- and information-driven economy of today and tomorrow; 2. Revamping immigration rules for highly skilled workers, so that U.S. companies can attract and retain the world's best scientific talent; 3. Increasing federal funding for basic scientific research, to train the next generation of innovators and provide the raw material for further innovation and development by industry; and 4. Providing incentives for private-sector R&D, so that American businesses remain at the forefront in developing new technologies and turning them into new products and services. I. Strengthening Educational Opportunities Like many others, I have deep misgivings about the state of education in the United States. Too many of our students fail to graduate from high school with the basic skills they will need to succeed in the 21st century economy, much less prepared for the rigors of college and career. Although our top universities continue to rank among the best in the world, too few American students are pursuing degrees in science and technology. Compounding this problem is our failure to provide sufficient training for those already in the workforce. This committee, of course, has been a leading advocate for expanding educational opportunities for American students and workers in the vital areas of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The America COMPETES Act, which was drafted by this committee and passed by Congress last year, includes provisions to train thousands of new STEM teachers and to provide current teachers with STEM-related resources through the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and Math and Science Partnerships Program. America COMPETES authorized expansion of the Noyce Program, an important step toward recruiting 10,000 new STEM teachers annually, a goal that I have advocated previously. It also authorized competitive grants to increase the number of teachers serving high-needs schools and to expand access to advanced placement and International Baccalaureate programs in these schools. These initiatives--and many others this committee has spearheaded-- represent critical strides in the much-needed effort to reform our faltering educational system, and I commend you for your vision and efforts. At both Microsoft and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we are investing in innovative approaches to broaden and deepen educational opportunities, which I will discuss more in a moment. But in order to ensure the continued success of our young people now and in the future, the public and private sectors must do more. A. Secondary Education The United States today has one of the lowest high school graduation rates in the industrialized world. Three out of every 10 ninth-graders--and nearly half of all African American and Hispanic ninth-graders--do not graduate on time.\\1\\ Of those who do graduate and continue on to college, over a quarter must take remedial courses on material they should have learned in high school.\\2\\ In all, fewer than 40 percent of our high school students graduate ready to attend college.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See Diplomas Count: The Graduation Project, Education Week (2007). \\2\\ See National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education, Remedial Education at Degree-Granting Post-secondary Institutions in Fall 2000 (2003). \\3\\ Greene, Jay and Forster, Greg, Public High School Graduation and College Readiness Rates in the United States, Education Working Paper No 3, Center for Civic Innovation, Manhattan Institute (2003). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our record on high school math and science education is particularly troubling. International tests indicate that U.S. fourth graders rank among the top students in the world in science and above average in math. By eighth grade, they have moved closer to the middle of the pack. By 12th grade, U.S. students score near the bottom of all industrialized nations.\\4\\ As a result, too many U.S. students enter college without even the basic skills needed to pursue a degree in science and engineering. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education, Highlights from TIMSS (1999). Note that eighth graders did better in the 2003 version of TIMSS, but that version did not test high school students. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To better understand and address these problems, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has invested over $1.9 billion to help establish 1,124 new high schools and improve 761 existing high schools. All of these schools operate under a common mission: that all students should have the opportunity to graduate from high school ready for college, career, and life. These schools approach this mission in different ways--some are large, many are small, some are organized around academic themes, others offer a standard college-preparatory curriculum--but all have common elements: High Expectations: They set high expectations for all students and engage students with challenging, relevant course work. High Levels of Support: They provide personal attention and support in a safe, respectful environment so that students can achieve at the highest levels. Through these efforts, we have learned a great deal about what works to improve student outcomes, and what doesn't. We also have concluded that creating a successful system requires better information and greater clarity about the following three sets of questions: Do we know how we are doing? Do we have transparent, common student performance data as the foundation for measuring impact and making decisions? No enterprise can be effective if it does not have clear goals and a way to measure its progress toward achieving its goals. At both Microsoft and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, this approach is our lifeblood; it is how we identify our weaknesses and how we improve. Education is no different. We must strengthen our ability to measure what students are learning, the progress they are making over time, and their readiness for college and work. I recognize that developing better information in these areas may be difficult, but it is central to identifying the most effective means of improving educational outcomes in our public schools. In recent years, school systems have taken important first steps toward greater transparency and accountability in how they assess student achievement. Congress and the Administration have supported increased funding for state data systems and the development of a new State Education Data Center. Now we need to develop data systems that can measure student progress over time and expand the scale of these systems so they are truly national in scope. We also need better student- and teacher-level data so that we can better assess which methods--and which teachers--are most effective at improving student learning. Getting this right is the most critical first step to improving U.S. high schools and K-12 education more broadly. We need to use these data as the basis for action, adjusting practices based on what we actually know about the performance of students--rather than on what we may perceive or assume. Do we know where we're going? Are we clear about our destination--ensuring that every student graduates from high school ready to succeed in college, career, and life? All 50 states have now adopted standards that define what young people should know and be able to do, and all states now measure their students' proficiency in core subjects. It is not clear, however, whether these standards are aligned with the demands of college and work or whether existing assessments accurately measure student proficiency. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has supported the American Diploma Project Network, in which more than 30 states agreed to align their standards to the benchmarks developed by Achieve, Inc., a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that helps states raise academic standards, improve assessments, and strengthen accountability. Working with the Education Trust, the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, and leaders from higher education and business, Achieve and its partners developed benchmarks to reflect what college professors and employers believe new students and employees need to know in order to be successful. In addition to adopting high school standards that better reflect what is takes to be successful in college and work, we need to develop better methods for measuring whether students are meeting these standards; a better understanding of the systemic changes that are required to ensure that all students gain the knowledge and skills that are essential for success; and better methods to assess how our own standards compare to those of educational systems elsewhere in the world. Ultimately, we need to identify a smaller set of clear, high, and common state standards that reflect what young people truly need to know to be successful in the 21st century, along with a common set of measurements to help us understand how well our schools are performing in key areas. At the same time, we must allow for the creativity and uniqueness that teachers and school communities bring to their work. Do we have what we need to get there? Are we providing the support, working conditions and incentives necessary for teachers to be truly effective? We all know that no one is more committed to helping our young people succeed than our teachers. Many of us can identify a teacher who had a profound impact on our lives. Research tells us that no other single factor in the educational system has greater impact on student performance. By helping teachers succeed, we can have a dramatic positive effect on student achievement. We need to ensure that our policies, processes, and systems will develop enough talented, dedicated teachers to ensure that every student has an effective teacher every year. This will be a massive undertaking. Before we take major steps, we need to be very clear about how these policies will affect student performance. Here is what we know: Some teachers consistently generate much larger gains in student achievement than others, even when they are assigned students with similar baseline performance levels. That fact alone is not particularly surprising, but the magnitude of the difference is. In elementary and middle school, for example, being assigned a teacher in the top quartile of effectiveness rather than a teacher in the bottom quartile will result in the math test scores of the average student in the class moving up 6-10 percentage points in a single year compared to similar students.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ See Robert Gordon, Thomas Kane & Douglas Staiger, Identifying Effective Teachers Using Performance On The Job, Brookings Institution (2006). Similar estimates of teacher effects have been reported in other papers. See, e.g., Eric Hanushek, Steve Rivkin & John Kain, Teachers, Schools and Academic Achievement, 73 Econometrica 2 (2005), at 417-458; Daniel Aaronson, Lisa Barrow & William Sander, Teachers and Student Achievement in the Chicago Public High Schools, 24 J. Labor Econ. 1 (2007), at 95-135. Our most needy students are disproportionately taught by less experienced and less effective teachers. Data from Los Angeles suggest that, compared to students in the wealthiest schools, students in the poorest schools were significantly more likely to have a teacher in the bottom quartile of all teachers as measured by teacher impact on student performance.\\6\\ In addition, the highest-need students are much more likely to be assigned a novice teacher who will gain experience and then move on to a more affluent school. In essence, our highest-need students too often help provide on- the-job training for novice teachers while students with fewer needs reap the benefits--thus exacerbating the achievement gap between high- and low-needs students. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ See Gordon et al., supra n. 5. We have to find better ways to reward and retain the most effective teachers and assign more of them to classes where they are needed the most. It should be a given that every child has an effective teacher every year of their school career. While governments will take the lead in reforming America's public education system, the private sector can and must support these efforts. At Microsoft, we have a number of education-focused initiatives. Through our Partners in Learning program, Microsoft works closely with governments and non-governmental organizations throughout the world to offer a wide variety of educational resources to teachers and schools, including teacher-training programs, software tools, and best practices. In the United States, Partners in Learning has reached more than 80 thousand teachers and over three million students, and actively supports states as they strive to prepare their students for careers in the 21st century. In Michigan, for instance, we created Career Forward, an online course that in its first year has already attracted over 17,000 participating students. In 2006, Microsoft, in partnership with the Philadelphia school district, opened a School of the Future. This neighborhood public high school--built on a standard budget and meeting all state and district requirements--offers a technology-based education model that can be replicated in other communities. In my view, the School of the Future offers an exciting example of what public-private partnerships can achieve, even when working within existing financial and regulatory constraints. This school has provided strategies that are being adopted throughout the district. And in a district where approximately 20 percent of students are absent from high school every day, the School of the Future has achieved over a 90 percent attendance rate. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also pursues a partnership model to advance educational reform. Let me highlight three examples in particular: Texas: Beginning in 2005, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation partnered with the Communities Foundation of Texas, the Governor of Texas, the Texas Education Agency, and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation to support the creation of 35 STEM schools and six regional resource centers across the state. Already, these efforts have helped attract technology businesses to the Austin area. Ohio: The Ohio STEM Learning Network has launched efforts to create a state-wide network of five STEM hubs and schools. Designed from a systems engineering approach, this network will scale to a state-wide system of innovative STEM schools with a $12 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and with support from a public-private partnership that includes the Battelle Memorial Institute, the Ohio Business Roundtable, the Ohio Department of Education, the Ohio Business Alliance for Higher Education and the Economy, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and many other local partners. This project has already attracted over $210 million in public funding and represents unprecedented multi-sector partnerships. North Carolina: Governor Easley, the Department of Public Instruction and the New Schools Project launched the Learn and Earn program, designed to improve high schools, better prepare students for college and career, create a seamless curriculum between high school and college, and provide work-based learning experiences for students. The schools, located on two- and four-year college campuses, seek to have all students graduate with two years of college credit or an associate's degree. The goal is to have 75 of these schools in operation statewide by 2008. Forty-two schools have already opened and 30 are scheduled to open in the fall. Each of these partnerships incorporates new methods to improve STEM education in public high schools. And each is designed to be clear about its goals, rigorous and transparent about measuring effectiveness, and deliberate in how it develops and retains skilled teachers. We hope that these partnerships will point the way to policies and approaches that not only better align our public high schools with the demands of the 21st century economy, but also provide better opportunities for all of our children. B. Higher Education In contrast to our public high schools, America's colleges and universities rank among the best in the world. Unfortunately, we are not graduating enough students with degrees in the STEM disciplines to meet the growing demand from U.S. companies for workers in these areas. Without people who have the skills necessary to drive the next wave of technology innovation, it will be impossible for the United States to retain its global innovation leadership. Consider these facts. The U.S. Department of Labor has projected that by 2014, there will be more than two million job openings in the United States in STEM fields.\\7\\ Yet the number of American students graduating with degrees in these fields is actually declining. Indeed, the number of undergraduate engineering degrees awarded in the United States fell by about 15 percent between 1985 and 2005.\\8\\ This decline is particularly alarming when we look at educational trends in other countries, many of which award a higher percentage of college degrees in engineering than does the United States.\\9\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ National Science Foundation, National Science Board, Science & Engineering Indicators 2008, at Apx. Table 3-7 (2008), available at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsb0803/nsb0803.pdf. According to another recent study, major U.S. technology companies today average more than 470 U.S.-based job openings each for skilled workers, while defense companies have more than 1,265 job openings each for skilled workers. See National Foundation for American Policy, Talent Search: Job Openings and the Need for Skilled Labor in the U.S. Economy, at 1 (2008), available at http://www.nfap.net/pdf/080311talentsrc.pdf \\8\\ Science and Engineering Indicators 2008, supra note 7, at 2-19 & Apx. Table 2-28. \\9\\ Id. at Apx. Table 2-28. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is not a new problem. For years, however, the decline in the percentage of graduate STEM degrees awarded to American students was offset by an increase in the percentage of foreign students obtaining these degrees from American universities.\\10\\ But various factors-- including our immigration policies (which I will address in a moment)-- are making it increasingly difficult for U.S. companies to hire foreign-born graduates of our universities. Indeed, according to a 2007 study, 40 percent of all recent foreign-born doctoral degree recipients in the United States intended to leave.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ For example, one recent study concluded that, in 2005, roughly 43 percent of U.S. higher educational institutions' engineering and computer science degree recipients were temporary residents, and that temporary residents received 59 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in those fields that year. See Science and Engineering Indicators 2008, supra note 7, at Apx. Tables 2-30 & 2-32. \\11\\ See Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, The Accelerating Decline in America's High-Skilled Workforce: Implications for Immigration Policy (2007), at 23 (citing Aurora (2007) ). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tackling the shortage of U.S.-born scientists and engineers will require determination by government and support by industry. The goal should be to ``[d]ouble the number of science, technology, and mathematics graduates by 2015.'' \\12\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ The Business Roundtable, Tapping America's Potential: The Education for Innovation Initiative (2005), available at http:// www.businessroundtable.org/pdf/20050727002TAPStatement.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, for its part, has invested $1.7 billion in college scholarship programs--including the Gates Millennium Scholars, The Washington State Achievers Program, and the D.C. Achievers Program--which together will help more than 17,000 young people attend college. Most of the scholarship recipients are from low- income families. One of the most important steps that Congress can take to address this issue is to fully fund the America COMPETES Act. Among other things, that Act authorized increases in the NSF's Graduate Fellowship Program and the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program that would provide funding for about 1,000 more STEM graduate students than were funded in Fiscal Year 2007. With these increases, the NSF will support more than 35,000 STEM graduate students during Fiscal Year 2008 and approximately 41,000 during 2009. If we want U.S. leadership in science and technology over the next 50 years to match that of the last 50 years, America's young people must come to see that science and technology degrees open the door to a wide range of interesting and lucrative career opportunities. If we fail to inspire our young people in this way, we simply will be unable to compete with technology innovators abroad. C. Lifelong Learning Governments at all levels are rightly focused on promoting job growth and skills training, encouraging the development of local industry, and enhancing their global competitiveness. But meeting these objectives is a long-term effort that cannot be accomplished by government alone. The private sector shares responsibility for providing continuing education to enhance skills and improve employment prospects for our citizens. Information technology workers now account for a significant percentage of the U.S. labor force. The U.S. Department of Labor projects that, by 2014, nearly one-third of new jobs will be in the fields of computer systems design and services, and that one-sixth will be in the information sector.\\13\\ The success of many business enterprises will depend on the degree to which the available pool of workers possesses the right combination of science, technology, and engineering skills. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ Daniel Hecker, Occupational Employment Projections to 2014, Monthly Labor Review (2005), at 72, available at http://www.bls.gov/ opub/mlr/2005/11/art5full.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the last decade, Microsoft has launched a wide range of commercial and philanthropic programs aimed at providing IT skills training to U.S. workers. Our commercial offerings include IT skills training and certification in cooperation with hundreds of commercial partners, and the Microsoft IT Academy, which provides online IT training programs and other resources to accredited educational institutions across the United States. Through our flagship digital inclusion programs--Partners in Learning and Microsoft's Unlimited Potential Community Technology Skills Program--we provide technology access and training to all types of learners, no matter where they happen to be on the continuum of IT skills and knowledge. We offer skills training for school children, for teachers who need to learn how to incorporate technology as part of their classroom instruction, and for community learners. In 2006, Microsoft joined with the U.S. Department of Labor to provide $3.5 million in cash and software to 20 of the Department's One-Stop Career Centers, which are located throughout the country. We also donated our innovative Digital Literacy curriculum to those Centers. We have similar partnerships with the Boys and Girls Clubs and the National Urban League. Although IT skills are in high demand, it can often be difficult for qualified job seekers with limited experience to connect with potential employers. To address this challenge, Microsoft recently launched the Students to Business (S2B) program, which is designed to help companies connect with and hire talented university or post- graduate students for jobs or internships in the technology industry. Through the S2B program, Microsoft collaborates with universities and businesses to provide students with specialized IT training and internship opportunities and helps match qualified job candidates with open positions at thousands of Microsoft partner companies so that students are able to find the right job for their IT capabilities. Microsoft S2B also helps match students to internships. Because IT professionals who have had one or more internships as students tend to secure better jobs when they enter the workforce, the S2B program provides IT students with a range of opportunities to build their experience and strengthen their resumes. All of these steps are important, but to achieve the kind of wide- ranging changes that are necessary, government and business must work together. As a nation, our goal should be to ensure that ultimately every job seeker, every displaced worker, and every individual in the U.S. workforce has access to the education and training they need to succeed in the knowledge economy. This means embracing the concept of ``lifelong learning'' as part of the normal career path of American workers, so everyone in the workforce can use new technologies and meet new challenges. II. Revamping Immigration Rules for Highly Skilled Workers The second set of policies that we must consider if we are going to address the shortage of scientists and engineers centers on our immigration rules for highly-skilled workers. Today, knowledge and expertise are the essential raw materials that companies and countries need in order to be competitive. We live in an economy that depends on the ability of innovative companies to attract and retain the very best talent, regardless of nationality or citizenship. Unfortunately, the U.S. immigration system makes attracting and retaining high-skilled immigrants exceptionally challenging for U.S. firms. Congress's failure to pass high-skilled immigration reform has exacerbated an already grave situation. For example, the current base cap of 65,000 H-1B visas is arbitrarily set and bears no relation to the U.S. economy's demand for skilled professionals.

Because an H-1B petition generally can be filed only for a person who holds a degree, when May/ June 2007 graduates received their degrees, the visa cap for fiscal year 2008 had already been reached. Accordingly, U.S. firms will be unable to hire those graduates on an H-1B visa until the beginning of fiscal year 2009, or October 2008. As a result, many U.S. firms, including Microsoft, have been forced to locate staff in countries that welcome skilled foreign workers to do work that could otherwise have been done in the United States, if it were not for our counterproductive immigration policies. Last year, for example, Microsoft was unable to obtain H-1B visas for one-third of the highly qualified foreign-born job candidates that we wanted to hire. If we increase the number of H-1B visas that are available to U.S. companies, employment of U.S. nationals would likely grow as well. For instance, Microsoft has found that for every H-1B hire we make, we add on average four additional employees to support them in various capacities. Our experience is not unique. A recent study of technology companies in the S&P 500 found that, for every H-1B visa requested, these leading U.S. technology companies increased their overall employment by five workers.\\17\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ National Foundation for American Policy, H-1B Visas and Job Creation (2008), available at http://www.nfap.com/pdf/080311h1b.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moreover, the simple fact is that highly skilled foreign-born workers make enormous contributions to our economy. A recent survey by Duke University and the University of California-Berkeley found that one quarter of all start-up U.S. engineering and technology firms established between 1995 and 2005 had at least one foreign-born founder.\\18\\ By 2005, these companies produced $52 billion in sales and employed 450,000 workers.\\19\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ Vivek Wadhwa et al., America's New Immigrant Entrepreneurs (2007), available at http://memp.pratt.duke.edu/downloads/ americas-new-immigrant-entrepreneurs.pd f \\19\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The United States will find it far more difficult to maintain its competitive edge over the next 50 years if it excludes those who are able and willing to help us compete. Other nations are benefiting from our misguided policies. They are revising their immigration policies to attract highly talented students and professionals who would otherwise study, live, and work in the United States for at least part of their careers. To address this problem, I urge Congress to take the following steps. First, we need to encourage the best students from abroad to enroll in our colleges and universities and, if they wish, to remain in the United States when their studies are completed. One interim step that could be taken would be to extend so-called Optional Practical Training (OPT), the period of employment that foreign students are permitted in connection with their degree program. Students are currently allowed a maximum of 12 months in OPT before they must change their immigration status to continue working in the United States. Extending OPT from 12 to 29 months would help to alleviate the crisis employers are facing due to the current H-1B visa shortage. This only requires action by the Executive Branch, and Congress and this committee should strongly urge the Department of Homeland Security to take such action immediately. Second, Congress should create a streamlined path to permanent resident status for highly-skilled workers. Rather than allowing highly-skilled, well-trained innovators to remain for only a very limited period, we should encourage a greater number to become permanent U.S. residents so that they can help drive innovation and economic growth alongside America's native-born talent. While some foreign students will undoubtedly choose to return home after graduation, it is extremely counterproductive to prevent them from remaining here to contribute their talents and expertise to our economic success if that is what they would like to do. Third, Congress should increase the cap on visas. The current cap is so low that it virtually assures that highly skilled foreign graduates will leave the United States and work elsewhere after graduation. By increasing the number of visas granted each year, Congress can help U.S. industry meet its near-term need for qualified workers even as we build up our long-term capability to supply these workers domestically through education reform. Ultimately, however, if we are to align our immigration policy with global realities and ensure our place as the world's leading innovator, Congress must make additional changes to our employment-based immigration system. The current system caps employment-based visas--or ``green cards''--at 140,000 per fiscal year. Because that number includes spouses and children of applicants, the actual number of visas available for workers is far fewer than 140,000. Moreover, the number of green cards issued to nationals of any one country cannot exceed seven percent of the total number of visas issued in a given fiscal year. These two factors have caused multi-year backlogs for thousands of highly skilled individuals and are having a chilling effect on America's ability to attract and retain great talent. I urge Congress to pass legislation that does away with per-country limits and significantly increases the number of green cards available in any fiscal year. Failure to do so will add to the already years-long wait for green cards and only encourage talented foreign nationals who are already contributing to innovation in U.S. companies to leave and take their talents elsewhere. Innovation is the engine of job growth; if we discourage innovation here at home, economic growth will decline, resulting in fewer jobs for American workers. I want to emphasize that the shortage of scientists and engineers is so acute that we must do both: reform our education system and reform our immigration policies. This is not an either/or proposition. If we do not do both, U.S. companies simply will not have the talent they need to innovate and compete. III. Increasing Federal Funding for Basic Scientific Research Another fundamental goal of a strategy for innovation excellence should be to increase federal funding for basic scientific research. Federally funded research supports the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers, those who will largely determine whether the United States remains innovative and globally competitive. Federally funded research also provides the raw material that U.S. companies transform into commercially successful products. Thanks to the Bayh-Dole Act and related legislation, universities and other recipients of federal research funds have strong incentives to ensure that the results of their research do not just end up sitting on a shelf, but instead are licensed to industry under terms that promote the development of useful new products. Countless products and technologies that we take for granted today had their origins in research conducted with federal funds. Government support was critical, for instance, to the development of public-key encryption technology, which became the foundation for most e-mail applications, digital certificates, and virtual private network software, as well as non-Internet technologies such as ATMs and credit card machines. Research initially conducted by NASA has been applied to improve the safety and effectiveness of angioplasties and breast cancer detection. Funding from the NSF led to the development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging. And of course, the Internet itself has its genesis in ARPANET, a project of the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. There are many other examples. The leaders of U.S. scientific institutions recognize the importance of federal funding for basic scientific research. As NSF Director Arden Bement has noted, ``[m]ore than a dozen major studies have now concluded that a substantial increase in federal funding for basic scientific research is critical to ensure the preeminence of America's scientific and technological enterprise.'' \\20\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ National Science Foundation Press Release, National Science Foundation Requests $6.85 Billion for Fiscal Year 2009, (Feb. 4, 2008), available at http://www.nsf.gov/news/ news-summ.jsp?cntn-id=111084&govDel=USNSF- 51 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, federal research spending has been stagnant or shrinking over the past several decades. According to the Task Force on the Future of American Innovation, ``[a]s a share of GDP, the U.S. federal investment in both physical sciences and engineering research has dropped by half since 1970. In inflation-adjusted dollars, federal funding for physical sciences research has been flat for two decades. . ..'' \\21\\ This stagnation in spending comes at a time when other governments, such as in China and the EU, are increasing their public investments in R&D. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ Task Force on the Future of American Innovation, Measuring the Moment: Innovation, National Security, and Economic Competitiveness, at 9 (2006), available at http://futureofinnovation.org/PDF/BII-FINAL- HighRes-11-14-06-nocover.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Passage of the America COMPETES Act potentially represents a welcome reversal of this trend, and again I support this committee's call to Congress to fully fund America COMPETES. Many important programs are at risk if this Act is not fully funded. For example, the Act extends funding for two important NIST initiatives--the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Technology Innovation Program, both of which have proven track records of producing return on investment and creating jobs. I also urge Congress to establish a mechanism to measure and report on the Administration's progress on implementing the initiatives established or funded by America COMPETES. As a nation, our goal should be to increase funding for basic scientific research by 10 percent annually over the next seven years. We also need to ensure that the private sector has greater visibility into the status and progress of federally funded research projects so that companies can collaborate more effectively with universities and other publicly funded researchers. IV. Providing Incentives for Private-Sector R&D The fourth critical element of a strategy for innovation excellence should be to strengthen incentives for private-sector R&D. Private companies are often in the best position to engage in the kinds of applied research and development that yield useful new products. Yet the inevitable pressure on companies to generate profits and maximize shareholder value may deter them from investing heavily in R&D, particularly since these investments are often viewed as riskier than other investments. While understandable, the reluctance of U.S. companies to invest more heavily in R&D is deeply troubling. If one looks at the personal computer industry, for instance, much of the foundational work for the industry was done in the private sector, at venerable institutions such as Bell Labs and Xerox PARC. Companies today, however, often seem less willing to invest heavily in R&D--or at least seem to focus most of their spending on development and relatively little on true research. If the United States is to remain a leading innovation economy, U.S. industry must invest more in R&D. To spur this needed investment, Congress should reinstitute the R&D tax credit, which expired last year, and make that tax credit permanent. Doing so would help convince American businesses that longer-term R&D investments--especially those that might take years before they generate any profits--are worthwhile. I appreciate the importance of such R&D incentives through my work at Microsoft. Last year, Microsoft invested over $7 billion in R&D. The R&D tax credit provides an important incentive to encourage Microsoft-- like thousands of other U.S. companies--to increase our R&D investment in the United States. The credit is a positive stimulus to U.S. investment, innovation, wage growth, consumption, and exports--all contributing to a stronger economy and a higher standard of living. As other countries recognize the long-term value of private-sector R&D and offer permanent and generous incentives to attract R&D projects, it is vital that the United States renews its commitment to U.S.-based R&D by enacting a seamless, permanent R&D tax credit. Conclusion I believe this country stands at a crossroads. For decades, innovation has been the engine of prosperity in this country. Now, economic progress depends more than ever on innovation. And the potential for technology innovation to improve lives has never been greater. If we do not implement policies like those I have outlined today, the center of progress will shift to other nations that are more committed to the pursuit of technical excellence. If we make the right choices, the United States can remain the global innovation leader that it is today. These four policy prescriptions--strengthening educational opportunities, revamping immigration rules for highly skilled workers, increasing federal funding for basic scientific research, and providing incentives for private-sector R&D--should in my view be top priorities as Congress and the Administration consider how to maintain the Nation's leadership in science, technology, and innovation. I want to conclude by again congratulating this committee on its 50th anniversary and commending the Committee for its tremendous efforts to advance the state of science and technology innovation in America. I am convinced that the U.S. IT industry--like many other innovative American industries--would not be the global leader it is today without the initiatives this committee helped design and implement. Thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective on these issues with you this morning. I'd be happy to respond to any questions you may have on these topics. Biography of William H. Gates William (Bill) H. Gates is Chairman of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential. Microsoft had revenues of $51.12 billion for the fiscal year ending June 2007, and employs more than 78,000 people in 105 countries and regions. On June 15, 2006, Microsoft announced that effective July 2008 Gates will transition out of a day-to-day role in the company to spend more time on his global health and education work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. After July 2008, Gates will continue to serve as Microsoft's Chairman and an advisor on key development projects. The two-year transition process is to ensure that there is a smooth and orderly transfer of Gates' daily responsibilities. Effective June 2006, Ray Ozzie has assumed Gates' previous title as Chief Software Architect and is working side by side with Gates on all technical architecture and product oversight responsibilities at Microsoft. Craig Mundie has assumed the new title of Chief Research and Strategy Officer at Microsoft and is working closely with Gates to assume his responsibility for the company's research and incubation efforts. Born on October 28, 1955, Gates grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. Their father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. Their late mother, Mary Gates, was a school teacher, University of Washington regent, and Chairwoman of United Way International. Gates attended public elementary school and the private Lakeside School. There, he discovered his interest in software and began programming computers at age 13. In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University as a freshman, where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer, now Microsoft's Chief Executive Officer. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer--the MITS Altair. In his junior year, Gates left Harvard to devote his energies to Microsoft, a company he had begun in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Guided by a belief that the computer would be a valuable tool on every office desktop and in every home, they began developing software for personal computers. Gates' foresight and his vision for personal computing have been central to the success of Microsoft and the software industry. Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft's mission has been to continually advance and improve software technology, and to make it easier, more cost-effective and more enjoyable for people to use computers. The company is committed to a long-term view, reflected in its investment of approximately $7.1 billion on research and development in the 2007 fiscal year. In 1999, Gates wrote Business @ the Speed of Thought, a book that shows how computer technology can solve business problems in fundamentally new ways. The book was published in 25 languages and is available in more than 60 countries. Business @ the Speed of Thought has received wide critical acclaim, and was listed on the best-seller lists of the New York Times, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon.com. Gates' previous book, The Road Ahead, published in 1995, held the No. 1 spot on the New York Times' bestseller list for seven weeks. Gates has donated the proceeds of both books to non-profit organizations that support the use of technology in education and skills development. In addition to his love of computers and software, Gates founded Corbis, which is developing one of the world's largest resources of visual information--a comprehensive digital archive of art and photography from public and private collections around the globe. He is also a member of the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invests in companies engaged in diverse business activities. Philanthropy is also important to Gates. He and his wife, Melinda, have endowed a foundation with more than $28.8 billion (as of January 2005) to support philanthropic initiatives in the areas of global health and learning, with the hope that in the 21st century, advances in these critical areas will be available for all people. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed more than $3.6 billion to organizations working in global health; more than $2 billion to improve learning opportunities, including the Gates Library Initiative to bring computers, Internet access and training to public libraries in low- income communities in the United States and Canada; more than $477 million to community projects in the Pacific Northwest; and more than $488 million to special projects and annual giving campaigns. Gates was married on Jan. 1, 1994, to Melinda French Gates. They have three children. Gates is an avid reader, and enjoys playing golf and bridge. Discussion Chairman Gordon. Thank you, Mr. Gates, and I now yield myself five minutes. I went the other day to a roll-out with OECD on a report called the PISA report on education 15-year- olds and mainly the EU countries and the United States. As usual, we do very poorly there. And I was trying to find some common denominators. Really, it was Finland that almost overhauled their whole education system a few years ago which has also overhauled their whole standard of living and improved it on a national basis. And I was trying to get common denominators, you know, what are the things they do; and they really emphasized that they want to have national standards but they want to have a contract in essence with the students, the parents, and the student to work in whatever is the best way to get there. So it wasn't just one common road. Let me say to those folks, I know there were a lot of people who couldn't get in today, and Mr. Gates shortened his testimony, but his full testimony is going to be on our website, www.science.house.gov, which is an award-winning website. You can find links to a lot of other things. But I think that it really will be beneficial if you want to read his full scholarly work. You will learn a lot more than what was just said here. Now, in your statement, when you talked about secondary education, you talked about transparency, you talked about having student performance data as formation of measures for impact and making decisions and also developing that national scope. I want to see if you can help me get through this is that our teachers now are concerned that they have these national tests, that they are having to teach to the test and other things are falling off the table. From what you have seen and studied and around the world, how do we best combine those standards so you can measure teachers, students, and their success versus the problem of just teaching to the test? Mr. Gates. The tests largely are about fundamental skills, math skills and reading skills, and these are exactly the qualifications that employers are interested in people having. And if you look at the other nations that do well on PISA, they are very serious about viewing tests as the metric and then looking at individual teachers, at schools, at systems based on how those test results are coming about. The United States in PISA were among the best at the fourth-grade level, and were in the middle at the eighth-grade. It is only by senior year that we drop to the bottom of those results. And so clearly in the high school period, there is some level of rigor that exists in these other nations' systems that isn't as strong in our systems, the background of the teachers, and comparing techniques. And so we would say that data that looks at these results and learning from that data is of great importance. In fact, there is funding for these data systems that are part of the America COMPETES. You know, we are gathering more data as a country. That is a great thing. Now, there is a tendency when that data doesn't come out well to say, okay, whose problem is it and even a temptation to say, if the data are so bad, let us stop testing because it is really depressing to keep looking at these numbers. In fact, the amount of investment required to fix those numbers is very high, and it is a tough problem. Where do you get at the local, State, and federal level the resources to do those things? But you know, I don't think that reducing the availability of the data and understanding that data really is the right way to go. Chairman Gordon. When you mentioned depressing, I think what is most depressing about that is our students in the elementary level come out pretty well. Then at the middle school, not quite as well, and then it starts to fall off the table in high school. I think what we are talking about is not trying to produce a lot of elite Ph.D.s but rather those folks, whether high school graduate or junior college or college graduate that can work at that higher technological level, and as we looked into it, what we found was that on the middle school level, 63 percent of the math teachers have neither a certification to teach math or do they have a degree in it. Ninety-three percent of the physical science teachers have neither certification nor degree. So it is hard to be able to teach something that you don't have that core background, as good a teacher as you might be. And that is one of the things we want to try to do in COMPETES. I am from Tennessee, the home of country music, and we say that the song all starts with the words, and I think school all starts with teachers and we are going to try to get better educated teachers. As I looked over your resume, I got a little bit of a head start but we are somewhat contemporaries in terms of age, and you think of Bill Gates as sort of a measuring stick not too many people measure up too well. So I was trying to look at common measures here. I noticed that you are a billionaire, and I am not. I noticed that I am a college graduate, and you are not. But I also noticed that we both have seven-year-old daughters, and I suspect you are a little bit obsessed as I am in making sure that she gets the best education so that she can be able to compete in, as we were growing up sort of a national world but very much an international world now. This is a little personal question that I suspect other folks would like to know. Outside of good schools, good parenting, in terms of hardware and software, what are those items now that you would recommend for us that want to help our seven-year-olds and older children to be able to adapt to this new technology in this new world? Mr. Gat"
