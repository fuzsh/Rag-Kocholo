Earnings-per-share dipped -12%, from $9.65 to $8.53, but exceeded the analysts’ consensus by $0.61.\n\nManagement characterized current business conditions as tough. Indeed, the last three quarters have marked a sharp deceleration over the previous quarters.\n\nDue to this deceleration and its expectation for volume sales to revert to mid-cycle levels, Deere lowered its already lackluster guidance for its earnings in this fiscal year from $7.50-$7.75 billion to about $7.0 billion.\n\nClick here to download our most recent Sure Analysis report on Deere (preview of page 1 of 3 shown below):\n\n#7—Ecolab (ECL)\n\nDividend Yield: 1.0%\n\nPercentage of Bill Gates’ Portfolio: 2.5%\n\nEcolab was created in 1923 when its founder, Merritt J.

(WMT)\n\nDividend Yield: 1.4%\n\nPercentage of Bill Gates’ Portfolio: 1.1%\n\nWalmart is another great example of a company with durable competitive advantages. It is the largest retailer in the U.S., with annual revenue above $600 billion. The company came to dominate the retail industry by keeping a laser-like focus on reducing costs everywhere, particularly in the supply chain and distribution.\n\nConsumers tend to scale down to discount retail when times are tight, which is why Walmart continued to grow, even during the Great Recession. As a result, Walmart is arguably the most recession-resistant stock in the Gates Foundation’s portfolio.\n\nThis allows Walmart to raise its dividend each year like clockwork, even during recessions. Walmart has raised its dividend for over 40 years in a row.\n\nWalmart posted fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on February 20th, 2024, and results were quite strong, as well as good guidance that sent shares rising to a new high. Adjusted earnings-per-share came to $1.80, which was 15 cents ahead of expectations.\n\nRevenue was up 5.7% to $173.4 billion, beating estimates by more than $4 billion.

Quarterly revenues fell 1.9% to $21.7 billion against the prior-year period. In FedEx Express, operating results improved due to lower structural costs resulting from DRIVE initiatives, partially offset by lower revenue. In FedEx Ground, operating results increased due to the benefits of DRIVE, higher base yield, and reduced self-insurance costs.\n\nFinally, in FedEx Freight, operating results fell due to a decline in fuel surcharges, reduced weight per shipment, and lower shipments, partially offset by higher base yield. Also, note that last year’s third-quarter operating income included a $30 million gain on the sale of a facility. Accordingly, total operating income improved by 19% to $1.24 billion.\n\nClick here to download our most recent Sure Analysis report on FedEx (preview of page 1 of 3 shown below):\n\n#11—Waste Connections (WCN)\n\nDividend Yield: 0.7%\n\nPercentage of Bill Gates’ Portfolio: 0.8%\n\nWaste Connections is a waste collection, transfer, disposal, and resource recovery business in the U.S. and Canada.
