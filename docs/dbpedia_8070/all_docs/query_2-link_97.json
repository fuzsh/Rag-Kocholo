        "text": "With $89 (£67bn) billion in the bank, Microsoft founder Bill Gates has been the world's richest man since May 2013.\n\nAfter founding and developing one of the most powerful and profitable technology companies in history, since 2008 he has dedicated his life to charity work via The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, so far giving away $31.1bn.\n\nEarly years\n\nWilliam 'Bill' Henry Gates was born on 28 October 1955, and grew up in a comfortably-off family with his two sisters in Seattle, Washington. His father, also called William, is a Seattle attorney and his late mother Mary was a schoolteacher.\n\nA deep-thinking child, Gates was educated at the private Lakeside School in Seattle where he excelled at many subjects. It was here in 1967 that he had his first encounter with a computer and so began the many hours he would spend in the school computer room where, he wrote his first computer program aged 13.\n\nGates and his friend Paul Allen became so fascinated by computers that they built a programme based on an Intel 8008 chip and used it to analyse traffic data for the Washington state highway department.\n\nGates later won a place at Harvard University but dropped out in 1975 to start Microsoft with Allen.\n\nInspired by a magazine article about the world's first microcomputer, the pair started by developing a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer – the MITS Altair 8800.\n\nThey approached MITS with their creation, and the company agreed to distribute it as 'Altair BASIC'. Allen was hired into MITS, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him in Albuquerque, New Mexico in November 1975.\n\nThey officially established a small 30-man operation called \"Micro-Soft\" on 4 April 1975, with Gates as the CEO. Gates never returned to Harvard.\n\nMicrosoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, but continued to develop programming language software for various systems. The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington, on 1 January 1979.\n\nDuring Microsoft's early years, Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.\n\nIBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 to provide the operating system for its upcoming personal computer. For this deal, Microsoft bought a system called 86-DOS from a company called Seattle Computer Products and, after adapting it for the PC, delivered it to IBM as 'PC DOS' in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.\n\nMicrosoft launched the first version of its Windows 1.0 operating system in 1985, but critics dubbed it slow and cumbersome. Further problems came when growing rival Apple saw Windows as a rip-off of its much-easier-to-use Macintosh operating system and sued - although the courts finally ruled in Microsoft's favour in the mid-1990s.\n\nMicrosoft moved its headquarters to Redmond in February 1986, and on March 13 the company went public with huge success, turning Gates into one of the wealthiest people in the U.S. In 1987 Gates, aged 31, had become the world's youngest billionnaire.\n\nAs the years rolled on, Gates worked hard to improve Windows and also introduced the top-selling Office suite, which bundled applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. Gates also managed to persuade key computer makers to preload Microsoft's software on every computer it sold. By 1993, Windows was estimated to be running on almost 85 per cent of the world's computers.\n\nMicrosoft, though, was slow to see the potential of building its own search engine and relied on search partners such as Inktomi for several years. By the time it did launch its own dedicated search platform, it had lost significant ground to Google, not just in the search and advertising space, but also the desktop space. Google offered a host of free online programs, such as Google Docs, that competed directly with the paid-for Office suite.\n\n“Google kicked our butts,” said Gates in a 2005 interview, when he also branded Microsoft’s decision not to pursue a dedicated search engine from the outset as “stupid as hell”. Microsoft, arguably, is still on the back foot.\n\nHome computer revolution\n\nIt wasn't all bad news though. 1995 was the year that Microsoft launched its groundbreaking Windows 1995 operating system. As well as being a technological breakthrough it was an unprecedented cultural phenomenon, and its launch became a massive celebrity-backed global event.\n\nHandover of power\n\nGates handed over the CEO position of Microsoft in 2000 to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend and employee of the company since 1980. Allen resigned after a long-term illness, while Gates became 'chief software architect' and chairman of the board.\n\nMicrosoft went on to release Windows XP in 2001, followed by Windows Vista in 2007, Windows 7 in 2009 and Windows 8 in 2011.\n\nIt entered the game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo, launching the first Xbox in 2001, and began to take on Apple in the smartphone market with the launch of Windows Phone in 2011, and the purchase of Nokia in 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, Gates announced in June 2006 that he would begin transitioning out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He finally retired as chief software architect in June 2008, and stepped down as chairman in 2014.\n\nWhat does the charitable foundation do?\n\nOfficially established in 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest philanthropic organisation in the world and has been the Gates' main focus since he cut back his role at Microsoft in 2008.\n\nAs well as funding global health programmes dedicated to disease prevention, immunisation and vaccination, it also aims to reduce extreme poverty, expand educational opportunities and improve access to information technology. In recent years Gates has also turned his attention to the environment.\n\nIn 2006, Warren Buffet donated $31 billion, most of his fortune, to the foundation.\n\nIn 2013, as part of Gates' $5.5 billion effort to eradicate polio by 2018, India was certified polio-free by the World Health Organisation, leaving only three countries that have never been free of the disease.\n\nGates and his wife plan to eventually donate 95 per cent of their wealth to charity.\n\nBill Gates: He eats Big Macs for lunch and schedules every minute of his day - meet the man worth $80 billion"
