        "text": "Did Apple copy Microsoft, or was it the other way around?\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates during an Reddit Ask Me Anything chat Monday tried to put an end to the long-running debate by saying that the companies didn't copy each other, but rather leaned on Xerox Corp.\n\n\"The main 'copying' that went on relative to Steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that Xerox Parc did in creating graphical interface â€” it wasn't just them but they did the best work,\" Gates said. \"We didn't violate any IP rights Xerox had, but their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows.\"\n\nGates added that Jobs went on to hire Xerox engineer Bob Belleville. Microsoft ended up turning to Charles Simonyi, a computer programmer for Xerox. Both had worked at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in California.\n\nJobs also talked openly prior to his death about getting a firsthand look inside Xerox's research facilities, leaning on what he learned to develop Apple. Xerox had developed a machine during the 1960s-70s widely considered to be a forerunner of the personal computer. Xerox, however, never fully capitalized on the discovery.\n\nIt's a topic of the 1999 book Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nWhile addressing a brand-range of questions Gates explained during the chat that such companies as Microsoft and Google are positioning themselves to use technology to solve a greater number of issues.\n\n\"The big milestone is when computers can read and understand information like humans do,\" Gates said. \"Right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test.\n\n\"Another whole area is vaccines. We need a vaccine for HIV, Malaria and TB (Tuberculosis) and I hope we have them in the next 10-15 years.\"\n\nTCLAUSEN@Gannett.com"
