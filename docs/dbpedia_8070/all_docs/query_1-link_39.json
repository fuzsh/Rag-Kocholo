        "text": "The Nassar family is growing!\n\nIn June 2024, Olympic equestrian Nayel Nassar and Jennifer Gates — the eldest daughter of billionaire Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates — announced their second pregnancy. The couple welcomed their first child, daughter Leila, in 2023.\n\nNassar and Gates started dating in January 2017 and got engaged three years later. They eventually wed at their farm in Westchester County, New York, in October 2021.\n\nSo, who is Jennifer Gates' husband? Here's everything to know about Nayel Nassar and his relationship with Bill Gates' daughter.\n\nHe was born in the United States to millionaire parents but grew up in Kuwait\n\nThough he was born in Chicago, according to his Global Champions League biography, Nassar was raised in Kuwait.\n\nHe was reported to have had a \"wealthy upbringing\" by his parents, who run an architecture and design firm in the country, and relocated to the U.S. in 2009, according to Al Arabiya English and Emirates Woman.\n\nIn December 2017, Nassar and Gates returned to the country in western Asia for a visit ahead of the holidays — and according to Nassar, the trip was incredibly meaningful.\n\n\"Memorable times in Kuwait last week with family and old friends. Got to bring Jenn home and give her a glimpse of my childhood,\" he wrote on Instagram beside photos of their vacation. \"It meant the world to me. Needless to say, she was loved by all..including Jerry.\"\n\nHe's an accomplished Egyptian equestrian who competed in the Tokyo Olympics\n\nBecause Nassar's parents are from Egypt, he has been able to ride in equestrian competitions for the country, according to Global Champions League biography.\n\nThe athlete began the sport at age 5 and was jumping by age 10, per his biography. Since then, he has gone on to qualify for the FEI World Cup Finals in 2013, 2014 and 2017, plus the FEI World Equestrian Games in 2014.\n\nHe has also taken first place in several competitions, including Longines FEI Jumping World Cup Las Vegas, Las Vegas National Horse Show Winning Round CSI 3, Longines FEI Jumping World Cup Del Mar, New York Masters CSI5 Grand Prix and Rabat CSIO4* Designated Olympic Qualifier, according to his bio.\n\nNassar, who competes in show jumping, helped Egypt qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. The accomplishment marked the first time in 61 years that Egypt's equestrian team had qualified for the Olympics.\n\nAlthough Nassar didn't win a medal, he received a pair of sweet shout-outs from his future in-laws on Instagram.\n\n\"I always love watching the Olympics. The #TokyoOlympics are particularly special because I get to cheer on my future son-in-law, @nayelnassar! We are so proud of you, Nayel (and Igor)!\" Melinda wrote, making sure to share the love with the equestrian's horse.\n\n\"I'm rooting for lots of the athletes in Tokyo right now—but none more than my soon-to-be son-in-law, @nayelnassar,\" Bill added in a separate message. \"Good luck, Nayel!\"\n\nThe International Federation for Equestrian Sports currently ranks Nassar as No. 44 in the world, with 48 jumping competition wins under his belt since 2010.\n\nHe's a graduate of Stanford University\n\nLike his now-wife, Nassar attended the Northern California university. He graduated from Stanford in 2013 with a degree in economics, according to his Global Champions League biography.\n\nHis biography also states that Nassar is also fluent in Arabic, French and English. According to her LinkedIn, in June 2018, he returned to the university to support Gates when she earned her degree in human biology.\n\n\"Lucky me, she's beautiful and has a Stanford degree! ?? Congratulations love, on all you've achieved these last 4 years. Can't wait to continue this wonderful journey with you ☺️ #stanfordgrad2018 #beenthere #classof2013 #imgettingold,\" he captioned a shot of the couple at her graduation.\n\nHis romantic relationship with Gates began in January 2017\n\nNassar's first Instagram photo with Gates came in February 2017 and featured the pair enjoying Valentine's Day dinner in Miami Beach, Florida.\n\nHowever, according to both of their Instagram accounts, the couple officially started dating the month before.\n\nOn their first anniversary in January 2018, Jennifer shared a photo of her kissing her man on the cheek and jokingly wrote beside it, \"Nobody rly knows whether our official ~dating anniversary~ is today or yesterday but that's ok… happy to be yours every day.\"\n\nNassar also shared a similar shot of him kissing Gates on the head and captioned it, \"Happy first year my love! Here's to many more.. ❤️❤️.\"\n\nSince then, the couple have often celebrated each other on social media. On Jan. 21, 2023, Gates marked her husband's 32nd birthday by posting a romantic black-and-white photo of the two walking and smiling together. In the caption, she wrote: \"happy happy birthday, @nayelnassar ❤️ no words to fully express the greatest privilege it is to do life with you. ♾️\"\n\nHe and Gates bonded over horses\n\nGates, who is also an accomplished equestrian and owner of Evergate Stables, previously said their love for the sport was part of what brought them together.\n\n\"Horses are just one part of our life, but we love the sport,\" she told CNN's EQ equestrian show in 2019. \"He's a professional, and I do this as an amateur. So, to be able to share our love and passion for horses with each other is just incredible.\"\n\nHe proposed during a ski trip\n\nWhen Gates announced their engagement in an Instagram post, she called Nassar \"one of a kind\" and raved about his romantic proposal.\n\n\"Absolutely swept me off my feet this past weekend, surprising me in the most meaningful location over one of our many shared passions,\" she captioned the sweet shot. \"I can't wait to spend the rest of our lives learning, growing, laughing and loving together. Yes a million times over.\"\n\nNassar also posted photos of the proposal on his own Instagram account, writing, \"SHE SAID YES!!\"\n\n\"I'm feeling like the luckiest (and happiest) man in the world right about now,\" he captioned his pictures. \"Jenn, you are everything I could have possibly imagined..and so much more. I can't wait to keep growing together through this journey called life, and I simply can't imagine mine without you anymore. Love you more than you can possibly imagine, and thank you for making every single day feel like a dream to me. Here's to forever!\"\n\nThe couple received many congratulatory wishes from their friends and family, including Jennifer's proud parents.\n\n\"So thrilled for you and @nayelnassar! ❤,\" wrote mom Melinda, 57, who also shared the sweet proposal photo on her Instagram Story.\n\n\"I am completely thrilled! Congratulations, @jenniferkgates and @nayelnassar!\" added her father Bill, 65, in the comment section.\n\nHe is the co-creator of an equestrian app JUMPR\n\nWhen his equestrian competitions were put on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nassar took the opportunity to work on a project he had been thinking about for several years — an app for equestrians, JUMPR, which he co-created with Minhee Lee, an app developer at Amazon.\n\nNassar was inspired to create the app when he realized that, unlike other sports, there was no app available for tracking show-jumping statistics.\n\n\"With basketball, it's so seamless to be able to figure out who the good players are that really thrive in a certain category,\" Nassar told Horse Network in 2022. \"You have all these splits for player performance data, depending on whether they're at home or on the road, which teams they're playing against, which position they're being guarded by. There was just so much detailed information that you can get on these players. We wanted to create the same thing for equestrian sport.\"\n\nHe and Gates share one child and are expecting baby No. 2\n\nIn March 2023, Gates and Nassar announced the arrival of their daughter, Leila. \"Sending love from our healthy little family,\" they wrote on Instagram alongside an image of the newborn's feet.\n\nThe couple are currently expecting their second child. Gates shared the happy news on Instagram by posting a photo of Leila touching her growing baby belly.\n\n\"Leila, being promoted to big sister,\" the soon-to-be mom of two captioned the image."
