        "text": "After just three semesters, Bill Gates had dropped out of Harvard University to start Microsoft in the year 1975. But now, the Microsoft co-founder, who himself couldn't finish his graduation, has come forward to share five things he wished he was told at the graduation that he never had.\n\n\"Five Things I Wish I Was Told At Graduation\"\n\nWhile addressing students at Northern Arizona University (US) a couple of days ago on Saturday, Bill Gates said, \"What does a college dropout know about graduation? Not much, personally, to be honest.\"\n\n“As I prepared for today, I spent a lot of time thinking about how you, as new graduates, can have the biggest impact on the world with the education you received here,” Gates said. “That led me to thinking about ... the advice I was never given on a day just like this one.”\n\nIf Bill Gates had finished college, these are “the five things I wish I was told at the graduation I never had,” he said.\n\n1. ‘Your life isn’t a one-act play’\n\n“You’re probably facing a lot of pressure right now to make the right decisions about your career,” Gates said. “It might feel like those decisions are permanent. They’re not.”\n\nGates recalled battling this same pressure when he was a student. When he co-founded Microsoft in 1975, he thought that “I would work there for the rest of my life,” he said. He’s “so glad” that he was wrong about that, he added, as per a CNBC report.\n\n“Today, I still work on software, but philanthropy is my full-time job,” he said, referencing his work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which he co-founded with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates.\n\n2. ‘You are never too smart to be confused’\n\nWhen Gates dropped out of college, he said, he thought he knew everything. Eventually, he realised that “the first step to learning something new is leaning into what you don’t know, instead of focusing on what you do know,” he said.\n\nBill Gates advised students to do the same. “At some point in your career, you will find yourself facing a problem you cannot solve on your own,” he said. “When that happens, don’t panic. Take a breath. Force yourself to think things through. And then find smart people to learn from.”\n\nYou can find these smart people in the workplace, on professional networking sites or among your peers, he added. His advice for getting that help: Don’t be afraid to ask for it.\n\n3. ‘Gravitate towards work that solves a problem’\n\nBill Gates also encouraged students to take opportunities to help others. “You are graduating at a time of immense opportunity to help people,” he said. “New industries and companies are emerging every day that will allow you to make a living by making a difference. And advances in science and technology have made it easier than ever to make a big impact.”\n\nThe opportunities are endless, Gates said. “When you spend your days doing something that solves a big problem, it energizes you to do your best work,” he said. “It forces you to be more creative, and it gives your life a stronger sense of purpose.”\n\n4. ‘Don’t underestimate the power of friendship’\n\nOne of Gates’ biggest college regrets, he had told Harvard students in 2018, was not being sociable enough. He spent most of his time in class or studying, leaving little room for building friendships.\n\nOn Saturday, Bill Gates advised recent graduates to keep valuing the connections they made throughout college. “The people you’ve [socialized] with and sat next to in lectures are not just your classmates. They are your network,” he said. “Your future co-founders and colleagues. Your best sources of support, information, and advice. The only thing more valuable than what you walk offstage with today is who you walk onstage with.”\n\nSome of Gates’ oldest friends have played crucial parts in his life. His high school friend Paul Allen became his Microsoft co-founder. One of his few college friends, Steve Ballmer, became his successor as Microsoft CEO.\n\nBill Gates also shared the best advice he received from his friend Warren Buffett.

I didn’t believe the people I worked with should either,” he said. He even tracked his Microsoft employees, noting who stayed in the office late and who left early.\n\nIt took becoming a dad for him to realise that “there’s more to life than work,” he said, as per the report.\n\n“Don’t wait as long as I did to learn this lesson,” he said. “Take time to nurture your relationships. To celebrate your successes. And to recover from your losses. Take a break when you need to. Take it easy on the people around you when they need it, too.”\n\nAlso Read: Bill Gates Vows To Donate All Wealth & Drop Off From Rich List"
