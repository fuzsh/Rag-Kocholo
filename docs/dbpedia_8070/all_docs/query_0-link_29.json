        "text": "Bill Gates\n\nIf you are a part of this world, there are zero chances that you have not come across the name 'Bill Gates.' He usually breaks the internet with his financial success. Here is a little something you must know about this prosperous business magnate.\n\nEarly Days\n\nWho would have thought that William Henry Gates would be this eminent when he was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Bill Gates's family background is quite worth mentioning. At an early age, Bill Gates comprehended his parents' wish to pursue a career in law. Like every other kid, this famous personality was picked on and bullied at school. His family was supportive and encouraging during his childhood days. His family never missed an opportunity to pat his back when he succeeded and never failed to frown upon when things went south. Computers have forever fascinated Bill Gates.\n\nA Family Packed with Popularity\n\nIt is a lesser-known fact that he was born into a well-to-do family.Even before he led the Global tech giant Microsoft, his family must have risen to prominence. His father, William Henry Gates. Sr was a popular lawyer of his time. Gates' mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was a woman of power as she was a member of the board of directors for the United Way of America and became the first women director of First Interstate Bank. Further, Bill Gates's grandfather was the president of the National Bank.\n\nWas Bill Gates' Education an Act of Aberrance?\n\nEveryone familiar with Bill Gates might know his love for computers. When he was at school, Bill Gates used to skip math classes to pursue his interest in computers. Probably Lakeside School he attended was the birthplace of all these impressive ideas. He was good at studies, and Bill Gates was a merit student at Lakeside School. He wanted to fulfill his parents' wish to choose a pre-law major. But he decided to study mathematics and computer. He kept a full stop to his education at Harvard University as he found Microsoft after dropping out.\n\nEven though Bill Gates is a college dropout, Harvard University must be proud to have had him there. If only every college dropout were as successful as him. Gates and his friend Allen started working on BASIC, a computer program used on large computers, and when the project was a fortunate one Bill Gates decided to stay away from Harvard for good. It may be clich√©, but perseverance and interest can take a person a long way. That is because every famous personality, billionaire, and businessperson has flaws. So do us. Despite the fact, they have come out with flying colors. Succeeding has nothing to do with minor flaws. And Bill Gates is a great epitome of that.\n\nBesides being a true inspiration, he makes us want to inspire people as he does. He dropped out of one of the world's prestigious institutions and made everybody turn their heads. That is the long-winded definition of triumph.\n\nMassively Macro Innings at Microsoft\n\nSuccessful people start doing important things at a very early age. And Bill Gates is not an exception. Bill Gates had his first coding experience at the tender age of 13. There are high chances you might have heard about tic-tac-toe if you had an idyllic childhood. When other 13-year-olds were occupied playing tic-tac-toe, Bill Gates went the extra mile making a version of the game on an electric computer. Microsoft and Bill Gates sync together very well that one cannot go without the other. Let us now see about this 33-year long love affair with one of the global tech giants. No wonder Microsoft is the world's largest software firm.\n\nMicrosoft initially was a hyphenated word 'Micro-soft.' Bill Gates, along with his friend Paul Allen started the initial sparks of Microsoft in 1975. Bill Gates' influence on the industry was more than ever when he licensed MS-DOS to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). IBM was one of the leading companies, setting the industry's pace back then. Since then, he has enhanced the company with his multiple roles. He has been Microsoft's Chief Executive Officer, chairman, president, and chief software architect.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Bill Gates was the ultimate charm of the whole tech industry that everyone chanted and was enchanted. He has also held a major portion of the firm's share until 2014. Owning most of the shares of the famous Microsoft firm made him one of the most affluent businesspeople in the world.\n\nManagement Style\n\nGates was a prominent software developer in Microsoft's early years, especially in the company's programming language products, but throughout most of the company's existence, he served as an executive and manager. Since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, he has not formally been a development team member; yet, as late as 1989, he contributed code to the company's products. Bill Gates loves the program, not because it will earn him a lot of money, but because it's a clever hack, Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates launched Microsoft Excel.\n\nGates left his position at Microsoft on June 15, 2006, to spend more time philanthropically. When he assigned Craig Mundie to oversee long-term product planning and Ray Ozzie to handle operations, he progressively split his duties between two successors. After a two-year process, his duties were entirely transferred to Ozzie and Mundie on June 27, 2008.\n\nBill Gates Net Worth\n\nTrue to his name, Bill Gates is one of the wealthiest businessmen in the world. He is right now the fourth richest person globally with a whopping net worth of 133 billion dollars. Besides owning Microsoft, Bill Henry Gates has other assets like Cascade Investment LLC and 56.5 billion American dollars in cash.\n\nThis colossal net worth has continuously won him a mention in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people since 1987.\n\nPhilanthropy Work\n\nGates' career at Microsoft was not the only thing that made him well-known. In 1994, he and his then-wife Melinda founded the William H. Gates Foundation (renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999) to support initiatives in the Pacific Northwest and programs for global health. The pair also provided money for minority study fellowships through the Gates Millennium Scholars program and donated to North American libraries through the Gates Library Foundation (renamed the Gates Learning Foundation in 1999).\n\nWarren Buffett made an ongoing contribution to the foundation in June 2006, which would enable it to amass assets of about $60 billion over the following 20 years. The foundation continues prioritizing community and educational initiatives in the United States and worldwide health and development issues at the start of the twenty-first century. To dedicate additional resources to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates gave from daily management of Microsoft in June 2008 after a brief transition period, but he remained chairman of the board. He left his position as chairman in February 2014; however, he remained a board member until 2020. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in this period in 2016. 2019 saw the release of the documentary Inside Bill's Brain: Decoding Bill Gates. Gates and his wife filed for divorce two years later.\n\nMarriage and Divorce\n\nOn January 1, 1994, Gates wed Melinda French on the Hawaiian island of Lanai. After Melinda started working at Microsoft in 1987, they became friends. Melinda allowed Gates to spend a limited amount of time with his ex-girlfriend, entrepreneur Ann Winblad, before marriage. Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe are the three kids that Bill and Melinda had. In Medina, Washington, the family lives in a home built into the side of a hill with a view of Lake Washington. On a total assessed value of US$147.5 million, the mansion's property taxes 2009 were stated to be US$1.063 million.\n\nThe 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m2) estate has a 1,000-square-foot (93 m2) dining room, a 2,500-square-foot (230 m2) gym, and a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system. Gate announced their divorce on May 3, 2021, after 27 years of marriage and 34 years together. They pledged to continue collaborating on philanthropic projects. According to the Wall Street Journal, Melinda has spoken with divorce lawyers since 2019.\n\nReligious Views\n\nIn a conversation with Rolling Stone, Gates discussed his religious beliefs and remarked, \"I think the moral systems of religion are incredibly essential. Our children have been nurtured in a religious environment and attended Melinda's and my Catholic church, respectively. I owe it to myself to strive to lessen the inequality in the world since I've been very fortunate. And in a way, that is a religious conviction. It is, after all, a moral conviction. In the same 2014 interview, he also stated that he agreed with Richard Dawkins that humans needed creation stories.\n\nWe looked for erroneous explanations for illness, the weather, and other phenomena before we started to grasp them. Now, science has partially?but not entirely?filled the space that religion formerly occupied. But there is no scientific explanation for the world's enduring mystery and beauty, which is truly astounding. It seems uncharitable to argue that random numbers created it. Though I believe in God, I'm not sure exactly what decisions you make in your life will change as a result.\n\nControversies\n\nAntitrust Litigation\n\nGates supported several choices that resulted in legal action against Microsoft for antitrust violations. Gates provided deposition testimony that numerous journalists characterized as evasive in the 1998 United States v. Microsoft lawsuit. The contextual meaning of phrases like \"compete,\" \"concerned,\" and \"we\" was a point of contention between him and the examiner David Boies. The judge was shown chuckling and shaking his head when the filmed deposition was played back in court later that year. According to BusinessWeek, throughout the first few rounds of his deposition, he repeatedly said, \"I don't recall,\" and offered evasive explanations, making the presiding judge giggle. Even worse, prosecutors used fragments of emails that Gates sent and received to explicitly disprove several of the technology chief's denials and claims of ignorance.\n\nLater, Gates claimed that he had only opposed Boies's attempts to misrepresent his words and deeds. \"Have I sparred with Boies? I own guilt of first-degree disrespect towards Boies. Gates denied it, but the judge determined that Microsoft had broken the Sherman Antitrust Act by monopolizing, tying, and obstructing competition.\n\nRelationship with Jeffrey Epstein\n\nEpstein and Gates reportedly \"discussed the Gates Foundation and philanthropy.\" However, in a 2019 interview, Gates categorically denied that Epstein had any association with the Gates Foundation or his generosity in general. Although nothing came of the concept, Gates said in August 2021 that he met with Epstein because he believed Epstein could provide money for charitable endeavors. Gates said, \"It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.\"\n\nEpstein and Gates reportedly spoke with Nobel Committee head Thorbjrn Jagland about the Nobel Prize in March 2013 at his home in Strasbourg, France. Members of the International Peace Institute, which has benefited from many donations from the Gates Foundation, including a $2.5 million award for \"community engagement\" in October 2013, were also there. According to reports, Epstein threatened to make public an alleged relationship that Gates had with a Russian bridge player in 2023.\n\nTreatment of Colleagues and Employees\n\nFrom Microsoft's establishment in 1975 until 2006, Gates was in charge of the company's product strategy. A business executive complained 1981 that Gates was \"reputable for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\" He developed a reputation for being aloof.\n\nConclusion\n\nPeople who taste success are the ones who were toiling hard when everybody else was asleep. Bill Gates has to have been a diligent person from the start to have reached the heights of success. He not only makes huge money but also donates a lot of it. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, founded by Bill Gates, is one of the noteworthy charitable foundations with an endowment of around 50 billion dollars as of December 2020. With his incredible career, life, and achievements, Bill Gates is such a role model to millions of students worldwide to earn and to endeavor to make great things."
