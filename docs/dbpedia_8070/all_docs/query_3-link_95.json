        "text": "The World Needs Breakthroughs\n\nThe only way to avoid the worst impacts of climate change is to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from 51 billion tons a year, where they are now, to net-zero—and we need to do it by 2050. That means we need unprecedented technological transformations in almost every sector of modern life.\n\nAt Breakthrough Energy, we’re accelerating this transformation by supporting cutting-edge research and development, investing in companies that turn green ideas into clean products, and advocating for policies that speed innovation from lab to market. Through investment vehicles, philanthropic programs, policy and advocacy efforts, and other initiatives, Breakthrough Energy works with a global network of partners to accelerate the technologies we need to build a carbon-free economy.\n\nGet Updates\n\nJoin our mailing list for the latest updates from across the BE network about our programs, partners, and progress toward net-zero emissions.\n\nSubscribe to Cipher\n\nGet the latest news and analysis at the intersection of climate and technology with Cipher—a weekly publication led by veteran climate and energy reporter Amy Harder."
