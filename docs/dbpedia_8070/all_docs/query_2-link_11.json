        "text": "From a small garage and dorm room startup to becoming the largest company in the world, Microsoft's journey highlights the power of vision and determination. Founded in 1975 by then-19-year-old Bill Gates and 22-year-old Paul Allen, who first famously met at Lakeside School in Seattle, the company arguably invented the software domain. This article explores key moments and strategic decisions that propelled Microsoft to its status as the world's most valuable company. Through partnerships, groundbreaking products, and strategic acquisitions, Microsoft has fundamentally changed how we interact with the digital world. Join us as we explore the remarkable story of Microsoft.\n\nFounding story: Founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the company initially capitalized on the emerging personal computing era by providing software for the Altair 8800, which led to the development of MS-DOS.\n\nPartnerships and innovation: A pivotal moment in Microsoft's history was its partnership with IBM in 1980. This collaboration not only catapulted Microsoft to the forefront of software development but also established MS-DOS as a standard in the booming PC industry.\n\nThe rise of Windows: The launch of Windows 1.0 in 1985 marked a significant shift toward a graphical user interface, setting the stage for future versions of Windows to dominate the market. The release of Windows 95 was a major hit and turning point in particular.\n\nExpansion into new domains: Over the decades, Microsoft has continuously adapted to technological changes and expanded its business into new domains such as cloud computing, AI, and gaming.\n\nThe story of Microsoft's founding and its initial years is a fascinating story of innovation, determination, and passion, later becoming the world's largest company by market cap. Established in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, Microsoft arguably invented the software domain and significantly influenced the evolution of personal computing as we know it today.\n\nBill Gates and Paul Allen, childhood friends from Lakeside School in Seattle, shared an early enthusiasm for computers. Their partnership began with a venture called Traf-O-Data, aimed at processing and analyzing traffic tapes. Although it was not a commercial success, it provided them with valuable experience in running a business and in the intricacies of software development.\n\nBill Gates' father, William Henry Gates II, reportedly played a substantial role in shaping his son's interests and values, particularly in business. Gates II was a prominent lawyer and a co-founder of the Seattle law firm Preston Gates & Ellis, which today is one of the largest law firms in the U.S. Thus, from a young age, Bill was exposed to discussions about business and law, as his father often shared stories and lessons from his own professional experiences. This early exposure to the legal and business worlds helped Bill develop a strategic approach to problem-solving and negotiations, which would later be pivotal in his career at Microsoft.\n\nThe true catalyst for Microsoft's founding was the development of the Altair 8800 by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), considered the first commercially successful personal computer. Allen saw a demonstration of the Altair 8800 on the cover of a January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which inspired him to propose that they develop software for it. Realizing the potential, Gates and Allen contacted MITS to offer their at the time rare programming skills.\n\nTo demonstrate their capabilities, Gates and Allen developed an interpreter for the programming language BASIC, tailored for the Altair. Without an actual Altair at their disposal, they used a simulator that Allen wrote on a minicomputer, and then later, when they finally tested their software on a real Altair, their code worked successfully on the first try. This successful demonstration led to them founding \"Micro-Soft\" on April 4, 1975, a blend of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\". The company's name, initially hyphenated as \"Micro-Soft,\" was suggested by Allen. On November 26, 1976, the company was officially registered as Microsoft Corporation.\n\nOne of the most significant events in the history of personal computing was the partnership between Microsoft and IBM in 1980. This collaboration not only catapulted Microsoft into the forefront of software development but also set the stage for the widespread adoption of personal computers across businesses and homes globally. Bill Gates played a pivotal role in securing and nurturing this partnership.\n\nBefore the partnership, IBM was primarily known for its dominance in the large-scale computer market, selling hardware to major corporations and governments. In 1980, IBM was in the process of developing its first personal computer, the IBM PC, and needed an operating system that would appeal to a broad market. IBM initially approached Digital Research, the creators of the popular CP/M operating system, but negotiations faltered over issues related to signing a non-disclosure agreement and other business terms.\n\nSeeing an opportunity, Bill Gates stepped in. Despite Microsoft not having an operating system at the time, Gates made a bold promise to deliver what IBM needed. This move was characterized by Gates' vision and his understanding of the strategic stakes involved.\n\nTo fulfill the promise made to IBM, Microsoft purchased an existing operating system called 86-DOS (originally QDOS, for Quick and Dirty Operating System) from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000. Microsoft then adapted this system into MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System), which was to be compatible with the IBM PC hardware.\n\nGates' decision not to sell the operating system outright to IBM but instead to license it per copy was groundbreaking. This licensing model allowed Microsoft to retain control over the software and later sell it to other PC manufacturers as well, establishing MS-DOS as a standard in the exploding PC industry.\n\nThe IBM PC was launched in 1981 with MS-DOS as its primary operating system, and the PC's success exceeded expectations. Microsoft’s partnership and association with IBM gave it immense credibility and a dominant position in the software market from the start.\n\nBill Gates' role in securing and managing the partnership with IBM was crucial. His strategic decision-making and risk-taking, evident in the acquisition of 86-DOS and the structuring of the licensing deal, were instrumental in setting Microsoft on a path to industry dominance already from the inception of the software domain. That's right. Gates remarkably anticipated the significance of software licensing in an era when software was a completely new domain. Also, the non-exclusive nature of the deal allowed Microsoft to instantly become a leader in software, as it could also sell to those who copied IBM's hardware. This insight from the then very young Bill Gates is arguably one of the most crucial business decisions in the history of Microsoft.\n\nFour intriguing facts:\n\nIn 1981, IBM sparked the personal computing revolution with the release of its blockbuster IBM PC.\n\nMicrosoft was assigned to develop the operating system under a non-exclusive deal, instantly catapulting the company into a market-leading position in software.\n\nIn 1986, Microsoft went public with a market cap equaling 1% of IBM's, which at the time was the largest company in the world.\n\nIBM's market cap now equals roughly 5% of Microsoft's, which now is the largest company in the world with a market cap exceeding $3 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft launched the first version of Windows, Windows 1.0, in November 1985. This graphical interface was built on top of MS-DOS, a text-based operating system. Windows 1.0 was not a standalone operating system but rather an operating environment that offered a graphical way to manage files and applications, one of the first of its kind. Despite its modest start and mixed reviews, it laid the groundwork for a GUI-based interaction model on PC platforms.\n\nBill Gates played a crucial role in the development and promotion of Windows from the very start. His vision was to create a system that would be accessible to the general public, enhancing the user experience through a graphical user interface (GUI) that differed markedly from the command-line interfaces of the time. He also reportedly saw this as an immense opportunity to create a competitive advantage for Microsoft; if people began working within their user interface and adhering to their standards, they would likely be reluctant to switch in the future. One could argue that this insight marked the first conscious creation of switching costs as a competitive advantage.\n\nAugust 1995 saw the release of Windows 95, a major leap in Windows history. It revolutionized user interfaces with the introduction of the Start menu, taskbar, and minimize/maximize/close buttons on each window. Windows 95 was a significant overhaul that offered a more intuitive way for users to navigate their computers, and it was the first version marketed as a standalone operating system. This was arguably the turning point for when the operating system was intuitive and good enough to gain massive adoption among the public.\n\nBill Gates was instrumental in driving the development and aggressive marketing of Windows 95. The launch was a cultural phenomenon, marked by a massive media campaign and unprecedented hype, which famously included the licensing of the Rolling Stones' song \"Start Me Up\" to highlight the new Start button.\n\nAs aforementioned, the release of Windows 95 marked a major leap in Microsoft's financial and market dominance. This operating system became incredibly popular, driving PC sales and associated software, which ballooned Microsoft's revenue. By the late 1990s, Microsoft had firmly established itself as a major player in the tech industry, with revenues soaring from about $2.9 billion in 1990 to over $23 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nEntering the new millennium, Microsoft continued to expand its product lineup beyond Windows and Office with entries into gaming (Xbox), enterprise services and cloud (Microsoft Azure), and hardware (Surface devices). In 2019, Microsoft reached a significant milestone by briefly topping $1 trillion in market capitalization, becoming the third U.S. public company to do so, after Apple and Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft reported a revenue of over $198 billion in FY 2023, with a notable growth in cloud computing and business productivity sectors. Microsoft Azure has emerged as a key competitor to Amazon Web Services, capturing a significant share of the enormous and continuously growing cloud market.\n\nMicrosoft's ability to adapt to market needs and innovate in areas like artificial intelligence and cloud computing has helped sustain its growth over time. This adaptability is reflected in its financial results, with net income consistently rising over decades. Microsoft's EPS growth since its 1986 IPO visualized:\n\nMicrosoft has been a dominant force in software since its inception, but what we haven't yet covered is its impressive acquisition history. From LinkedIn and Skype to GitHub and Activision Blizzard, these acquisitions have contributed significantly to Microsoft's growth and its position in several markets.\n\nMicrosoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard on January 18, 2022, for $68.7 billion. This deal aimed at bolstering Microsoft's Xbox gaming division with a vast library of games and game development capabilities. However, the acquisition faced regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU. The deal was finalized roughly one and a half years later, in October 2023.\n\nThe acquisition of Activision Blizzard is Microsoft's largest ever and one of the largest in business history. For those who may not be aware, Activision Blizzard is one of the largest game developers and publishers, known for blockbuster franchises such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch.\n\nAcquired in 2011 for $8.5 billion. Microsoft used this acquisition to bolster its communication tools, integrating Skype's capabilities into its products such as Microsoft Teams and Outlook.\n\nAcquired in 2014 for $7.2 billion. This move was intended to boost Microsoft's mobile hardware capabilities, although it was later divested after struggles to gain market share.\n\nAcquired in 2014 for $2.5 billion. The acquisition of Mojang, the studio behind the hugely popular game Minecraft, was a strategic move to strengthen Microsoft's gaming offering.\n\nAcquired in 2016 for approximately $26.2 billion. This acquisition was aimed at integrating the professional network with Microsoft's productivity tools and cloud services.\n\nAcquired in 2018 for $7.5 billion. This acquisition aimed to strengthen Microsoft's ties with the developer community and enhance its overall ecosystem around software development and cloud computing.\n\nInitiated in 2019, Microsoft has invested over $1 billion in OpenAI. This strategic partnership aims to accelerate breakthroughs in AI and develop advanced AI technologies that can be integrated across Microsoft’s products.\n\nAnnounced in 2022 for $68.7 billion, finalized in October 2023. This is Microsoft's largest acquisition, significantly expanding its gaming library.\n\nFrom a small garage and dorm rooms to global dominance, Microsoft's evolution captures the power of vision and determination combined with innovation. Founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen at the ages of 19 and 22, respectively, the company seized an unprecedented opportunity with the Altair 8800, setting the stage for personal computing. Through several strategic crucial moves, such as the licensing deal with IBM in 1981, Microsoft not only led the software revolution but also pioneered significant technological shifts that reshaped the tech landscape.\n\nThe introduction of Windows 95 marked a cultural and technological leap, heralding a new era of user-friendly computing interfaces that solidified Microsoft's market supremacy. As the digital landscape evolved, so did Microsoft, expanding into cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and gaming, continually adapting to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world.\n\nToday, Microsoft stands as a testament to the enduring relevance of its founding philosophy – empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. With ongoing innovations and strategic acquisitions, Microsoft is as relevant as ever and its journey is clearly far from over. As it steers into future territories like AI together with OpenAI, it remains a central figure in global technology, continuing to influence lives and businesses worldwide. This story of growth and adaptation not only charts the rise of a corporate titan but also mirrors the ascent of the digital age itself."
