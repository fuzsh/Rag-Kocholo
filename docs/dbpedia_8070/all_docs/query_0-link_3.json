        "text": "Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. He grew up in Seattle, Washington, with a supportive family who encouraged his interest in computers at an early age. He dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Today, Bill chairs the Gates Foundation where he works to give his wealth back to society.\n\nBill grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. His late father, William H. Gates Sr., was a Seattle attorney and one of the co-chairs of the Gates Foundation. His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of the national United Way. Bill has three children.\n\nWhen Bill and Paul Allen started Microsoft, their vision of “a computer on every desktop and in every home” seemed farfetched to most people. Today, thanks to Microsoft and many other companies, that vision is a reality in many parts of the world, and personal technology is an integral part of society.\n\nBill is passionate about Microsoft’s work and will always be involved with the company, including his present role as a technology advisor.\n\nThese days Bill focuses most of his time on the work he is doing through his foundation. People are often surprised to hear him say that this work has a lot in common with his work at Microsoft. In both cases, he gets to bring together smart people and collaborate with them to solve big, tough problems.\n\nBill is gratified to know that the foundation and its many partners are helping people all over the world live healthier, more productive lives.\n\nIn addition to the foundation’s work, Bill has separately taken on some projects to address issues that interest him personally, such as delivering clean energy to everyone who needs it.\n\nIn all his work—with the foundation and otherwise—he’s focused on what he calls catalytic philanthropy: investments in innovations that will improve life for the poorest. They’re solutions to problems where markets and governments underinvest."
