        "text": "He was born on May 23, 1999, in Seattle and grew up in a massive mansion dubbed Xanadu 2.0 with his two sisters, Jennifer, three years older than him, and Phoebe, three years younger.\n\nLet’s learn a bit more about the man who might one day lead Microsoft.\n\nHis early years\n\nGrowing up, Bill and Melinda Gates gave their kids a 66,000-sq-ft dream house. Nicknamed Xanadu 2.0, the ultra-luxurious US$150 million lakefront mansion in Medina, Washington had just about every amenity you could imagine, including a trampoline room, a pool and its own artificial beach with sand flown in from the Caribbean islands.\n\n“We often set a time after which there is no screen time, and in their case, that helps them get to sleep at a reasonable hour,” Bill Gates told The Mirror in 2017. “You’re always looking at how it can be used in a great way – homework and staying in touch with friends – and also where it has gotten to excess.”\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Bill revealed that his family regularly attends church. “We’ve raised our kids in a religious way. They’ve gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in,” he said.\n\nHis education\n\nRory attended the elite private/independent school Lakeside School in Seattle, Washington, like his dad, and then pursued a bachelor’s degree in computer software engineering and economics at Duke University, like his mother. His educational journey then took him to Fuqua School of Business, where he got his MBA degree, following exactly in his mother’s educational footsteps.\n\nMelinda describes her time at Duke University as “some of the best years of my life” and even gave the university a US$20 million in 1998 for a “pioneering academic programme expanding teaching and research across traditional disciplinary boundaries”. Bill and Melinda also donated US$10 million in 2008 to “support scholarships for undergraduates and business school student”, it says on the Gates Foundation website.\n\nIn a personal essay for Time, Melinda spoke about raising Rory as a feminist, saying he doesn’t shy away from discussing gender equality.\n\n“My son told me he thinks that standing up to unfair norms is nothing more than exactly what men everywhere should be doing. Yes, he recognises that the more entrenched the norms, the more courage it takes to confront them. But he also believes that it’s a universal responsibility and one that he’s already striving to uphold in his own life,” wrote Melinda in the essay.\n\nHis life in Chicago?\n\nRory is believed to be currently enrolled in law school at the University of Chicago. According to The Chicago Tribune, Bill and Melinda bought a US$1.25 million five-bedroom house in Chicago’s South Side Hyde Park neighbourhood in 2018. At 3,000 square feet, the property is several square feet shy of Rory’s childhood home. It features a brick facade, two terraces and a detached three-and-a-half-car garage. Though the reason for the purchase is unspecified, the newspaper noted that “its proximity to the University of Chicago” and that Rory is “college-age” might “offer a clue”.\n\nOnly time will tell if Rory gets millions or billions."
