        "text": "Bill Gates (1955-)\n\nOccupation: Software executive\n\nSource of wealth: Microsoft stock\n\nAssets: $75 billion\n\nClaim to fame: Richest-ever college dropout\n\nHe is both the most admired and despised executive of his era. A geeky kid, Gates worked as a programmer from age 13 and co-founded Microsoft Corp. at age 20 with boyhood pal Paul Allen after dropping out of Harvard. Microsoft took off when International Business Machines Corp. chose the fledgling company's operating system, MS-DOS, to run its PCs. Ruthlessly competitive, Gates since has moved Microsoft into every PC software nook, squeezing out smaller rivals and drawing the ire of antitrust regulators. Gates has spent lavishly building a mansion and snapping up electronic rights to art masterpieces, but also recently donated $100 million for immunization programs for children in developing countries."
