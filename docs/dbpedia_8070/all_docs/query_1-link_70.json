        "text": "#society There were 337 women listed on the world's billionaires list as of 4 April 2023. One year later, we can guesstimate this number to be at least 350, which is at least half a trillion dollars in net worth, worldwide. Melinda French Gates, Julia Koch, Alice Walton, and MacKenzie Scott are the better known names with a fortune exceeding $100 billion between them. Melinda Gates, after their divorce, according to this post from Bill Gates has now also resigned from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation effective June 7th to focus on girls and women worldwide. Some of the men and women who are billionaires, logically, should have children some of whom are daughters. Bill Gates has two. These men and women must benefit their female children to make them leaders in any occupation they choose. Eventually, like rabbits, we will arrive at a Fibonacci sequence for girls and women worldwide, if their monies are well spent, meaning efficiently and effectively to achieve outcomes instead of throwing money at the problems, and if the wealth, income, and education gaps are significantly narrowed to a Gini index of 0.3 among women, globally.

THANK YOU.\n\nSo now comes the part where a staff of experts in everything from international women's rights to grant-making and program development will spend large amounts of money and time to create complex parameters for how Ms. French Gates' billions of dollars will be distributed. But consider this: there are over 11 million Afghan women between the ages of 15 and 64. Afghan women are not permitted to attend school after the sixth grade, and the literacy rate for women is only 24%. The barriers for those women to get a secondary or higher education are endless -- money, politics, money, governments, money, English language testing, money, geography, money, family, and did I mention money? So instead of using vast resources to create complex, top-down systems that so often give funding to organizations that can get it elsewhere, why not give directly to the women who are desperate for it? Give cell phone data to online women students in Afghanistan; better yet, give them devices so they don't have to do schoolwork on phones; give scholarships for young Afghan women to attend accredited online high schools; give fees for online career skills-building courses; give full funding for young Afghan women to apply for, travel to, and attend universities outside of their country. It's so simple to give to the things that will directly support these women. And when you do, you are a catalyst for generational change. For every Afghan woman who obtains an education, a visa out of the country, an online job, or English fluency, you have provided a better way of life for her current and future children as well. You have also helped disassemble a misogynistic regime and advance an educated society. It's a simple, effective, and efficient way to make a real difference in a life, a family, a country, and our world. #afghanwomen #womenseducation #article26foundation #VictoryAfghanistan #philanthropy #donations #gifts\n\nTHANK YOU FOR TOP FAN.!

Sometimes… Most times, when well positioned women step down, they often cite two things… Their maternal instinct to invest in their family or other women, their family and children or… They are sick. It might be all those years of writing SOAP notes in the clinic but… Objectives noted: 1) Said person will often mindfully turn 5 talons given by the stockholders into 20 talons for all stakeholders. 2) Said person moves their energy from influence to impact mode and suddenly who ever is attached to them wins. 3) Billionare women move different than billionare men. They seem consistently focused on the stakeholders, rather than the stockholders and somehow their wisdom will always bring more holistic resources to their invested area or region and not rob them. 4) I have seen this use of personal power most often expressed through the model of someone with curves, curls in our hair and usually a beautiful bold color dress on. Now I am not saying to go out shopping or head to the salon but, if you could ask said person for advice and follow their pages or 3 hour podcasts for leadership, relationship and enterprise ideas, it might make what ever end stage capitalism is turning into much better for everyone.\n\nI'm a big fan of women with wealth putting their money towards social good, especially to #womensrights and #genderequality. MacKenzie Scott gave away 2 billion last year, with $640 million to non profits this year. Personally I think that should be applauded. So, when I heard Melinda French Gates was parting ways with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, an expected move, I have been thinking of what she could do with her over 10 billion, for women's rights and gender equality. Here's what I hope she is doing/considering: 1. Invest in women's rights and feminist movements. Grassroots women's movements everywhere are the cornerstone of social change, yet work on a shoestring, receiving less than 1% of ODA (official development assistance). Whether it's in conflict and disasters responding to crisis, peacebuilding, or working on development - and often, all of it, women are at the forefront. Fund Women's Peace & Humanitarian Fund (WPHF) Urgent Action Fund for Feminist Activism, Global Fund for Women and more. Go direct, fund grassroots organisations led and run by women. There's alot of talk about doing this, but noone seems to have cracked it! 2. Fund prevention of violence against women. 1 in 3 women experience some form of physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. Deeply rooted in patriarchy, unequal power relations, men's violence against women is so pervasive, resulting in femicide, long lasting impacts, trauma, stigma, loss of economic opportunities, and homelessness. Fund prevention programs that challenge attitudes that condone violence against women, that foster consent, and healthy and equal relationships. Fund women's organisations and partners of Spotlight Initiative Sexual Violence Research Initiative (SVRI) WhatWorks2PreventVAWG UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women 3. Support women's leadership in all spaces at all levels. Identify and fund women leaders and aspiring politicians to run in local and national elections in countries where they are needed (eg. everywhere!). 4. Use her voice to stand for women's rights including advocacy on women's access to sexual and reproductive health rights. 5. Champion feminist leadership. It is not a given that women in leadership positions promote gender equality or women's rights. In fact, sometimes it is the opposite, due to the patriarchal nature of the environments that we all operate within. 6. Fund microfinance and women's economic empowerment. Women want economic opportunities, that reinforce independence and agency. 7. Make it her mission to only fund, partner and support organisations that have genderequality as key objective. And lastly (for now), lend her voice to challenge all systems of oppression.
