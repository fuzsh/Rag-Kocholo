        "text": "Jennifer Gates Nassar\n\nJennifer Gates Nassar, who goes by Jenn, is the oldest of the Gates children at 28 years old.\n\nA decorated equestrian, Gates Nassar started riding horses when she was six. Her father has shelled out millions of dollars to support her passion, including buying a California horse farm for $18 million and acquiring several parcels of land in Wellington, Florida, to build an equestrian facility.\n\nIn 2018, Gates Nassar received her undergraduate degree in human biology from Stanford University, where a computer science building was named for her father after he donated $6 million to the project in 1996.\n\nShe then attended the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, from which she graduated in May. She will continue at Mt. Sinai for her residency in pediatric research. During medical school, she also completed a Master's in Public Health at Columbia University — perhaps a natural interest given her parents' extensive philanthropic activity in the space.\n\n\"Can't believe we've reached this moment, a little girl's childhood aspiration come true,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"It's been a whirlwind of learning, exams, late nights, tears, discipline, and many moments of self-doubt, but the highs certainly outweighed the lows these past 5 years.\"\n\nIn October 2021, she married Egyptian equestrian Nayel Nassar. In February 2023, reports surfaced that they bought a $51 million New York City penthouse with six bedrooms and a plunge pool. The next month, they welcomed their first child, Leila.\n\nIn June, she announced she was pregnant with her second child.\n\n\"Leila, being promoted to big sister,\" she captioned an Instagram photo of herself and her daughter.\n\nIn a 2020 interview with the equestrian lifestyle publication Sidelines, Gates Nassar discussed growing up wealthy.\n\n\"I was born into a huge situation of privilege,\" she said. \"I think it's about using those opportunities and learning from them to find things that I'm passionate about and hopefully make the world a little bit of a better place.\"\n\nShe recently posted about visiting Kenya, where she learned about childhood health and development in the country.\n\nRory John Gates\n\nRory John Gates, who is in his mid-20s, is Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates' only son and the most private of their children. He maintains private social media accounts, and his sisters and parents rarely post photos of him.\n\nHis mother did, however, write an essay about him in 2017. Titled \"How I Raised a Feminist Son,\" she describes as a \"great son and a great brother\" who \"inherited his parents' obsessive love of puzzles.\"\n\nIn 2022, he graduated from the University of Chicago, where, based on a photo posted on Facebook, he appears to have been active in moot court. At the time of his graduation, Jennifer Gates Nassar wrote that he had achieved a double major and master's degree.\n\nLittle is publicly known about what the middle Gates child has been up to since he graduated, but a Puck report from last year gave some clues, saying that he is seen as a \"rich target for Democratic social-climbers, influence-peddlers, and all variety of money chasers.\" According to OpenSecrets, his most recent public giving was to Nikki Haley last year.\n\nThe same report says he works as a congressional analyst while also completing a doctorate.\n\nPhoebe Gates\n\nPhoebe Gates, 21, is the youngest of the Gates children.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 2021, she followed her sister to Stanford. She graduated in June after three years with a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology. Her mom, Melinda French-Gates, delivered the university's commencement address.\n\nIn a story that Gates wrote for Nylon about her graduation day, she documented her graduation day, including a party she cohosted that featured speeches from her famous parents and a piggyback ride from her boyfriend Arthur Donald — the grandson of Sir Paul McCartney.\n\nShe has long shown an interest in fashion, interning at British Vogue and posting on social media from fashion weeks in Copenhagen, New York, and Paris. Sustainability is often a theme of her content, which highlights vintage and secondhand stores and celebrates designers who don't use real leather and fur.\n\nThat has culminated in her cofounding Phia, a sustainable fashion tech platform that is set to launch later this year, with her former college roommate.\n\nGates shares her parents' passion for public health. She's attended the UN General Assembly with her mother and spent time in Rwanda with Partners in Health, a nonprofit that has received funding from the Gates Foundation.\n\nLike her mother, Gates often publicly discusses issues of gender equality, including in essays for Vogue and Teen Vogue, at philanthropic gatherings, and on social media, where she frequently posts about reproductive rights.\n\nShe's given thousands to Democrats and Democratic causes, including to Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and the Democratic Party of Montana, per data from OpenSecrets. According to Puck, she receives a \"giving allowance\" that makes it possible for her to cut the checks.\n\nPerhaps the most public of the Gates children — she's got nearly 400,000 Instagram followers and a partnership with Tiffany & Co. — she's given glimpses into their upbringing, including strict rules around technology. The siblings were not allowed to use their phones before bed, she told Bustle, and to get around the rule, she created a cardboard decoy.\n\n\"I thought I could dupe my dad, and it worked, actually, for a couple nights,\" she told the outlet earlier this year. \"And then my mom came home and was like, 'This is literally a piece of cardboard you're plugging in. You're using your phone in your room.' Oh, my gosh, I remember getting in trouble for that.\""
