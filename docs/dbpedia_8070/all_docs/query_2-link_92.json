        "text": "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates says the development of artificial intelligence (AI) is the most important technological advance in decades.\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, he called it as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone.\n\n\"It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other,\" he said.\n\nHe was writing about the technology used by tools such as chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nDeveloped by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an AI chatbot which is programmed to answer questions online using natural, human-like language.\n\nThe team behind it in January 2023 received a multibillion dollar investment from Microsoft - where Mr Gates still serves as an advisor.\n\nBut it is not the only AI-powered chatbot available, with Google recently introducing rival Bard.\n\nI was one of the first people to get access to Bard and my colleagues and I are trying to put it through its paces.\n\nSo far it's given me a philosophical answer to the meaning of life.\n\nIt gave a competent potted history of Russia-China relations to a colleague covering the meeting between President Putin and Xi Jinping - unlike ChatGPT, Bard can access current affairs.\n\nA programme editor asked it for a good running order for her news show. Start with the biggest story of the day, Bard suggested, and end with a musician or comedian. It also did a decent if generic job of a poem about trees and blossom.\n\nI haven't yet started trying to get it to be rude to me, or about others. I'll report back on thatâ€¦\n\nYou can read more about it here.\n\nMr Gates said he had been meeting with OpenAI - the team behind the artificial intelligence that powers chatbot ChatGPT - since 2016.\n\nIn his blog, Mr Gates said he challenged the OpenAI team in 2022 to train an AI that can pass an Advanced Placement (AP) Biology exam - roughly equivalent to an A-level exam - with the strict rule that the AI could not be specifically trained to answer Biology questions.\n\nA few months later they revealed the results - a near perfect score, he said, missing only one mark out of 50.\n\nAfter the exam, Mr Gates said he asked the AI to write a response to a father with a sick child.\n\n\"It wrote a thoughtful answer that was probably better than most of us in the room would have given,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew I had just seen the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface (GUI).\"\n\nA GUI is a visual display - allowing a person to interact with images and icons, rather than a display that shows only text and requires typed commands.\n\nIts development led to the Windows and Mac OS operating systems in the 1980s, and remains a key part of computing.\n\nAnd Mr Gates says he believes AI tech will lead to similar advancements.\n\nThe Future of AI\n\nMr Gates, who co-chairs the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, called on governments to work with industry to \"limit the risks\" of AI, but said the technology could be used to save lives.\n\n\"AI-driven improvements will be especially important for poor countries, where the vast majority of under-5 deaths happen,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Many people in those countries never get to see a doctor, and AIs will help the health workers they do see be more productive.\"\n\nSome examples of this he gave include completing repetitive tasks such as insurance claims, paperwork, and note-taking."
