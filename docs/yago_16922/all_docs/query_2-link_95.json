Kirk Cameron is here to offer his advice.\n\nIn an interview with the Christian Post, the former Growing Pains star said, “Wives are to honour and respect and follow their husband’s lead, not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband. When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage.”\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nNoted Christian Kirk Cameron says wives must 'honour and respect and follow their husband's lead' Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

He is currently on a Bible event tour called “Love Worth Fighting For,” which is meant to teach others how to “strengthen and encourage” their marriage.\n\nIn the interview, he added that “a lot of people don’t know that marriage comes with instructions,” and “we find them right there in God’s word.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Cameron has shared his thoughts and been met with heavy backlash. He recently told Piers Morgan that homosexuality is “destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.”\n\n“How did you like the Grammy’s all out assault on the traditional family last night?” he wrote after Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’ performance of “Same Love,” in which 33 couples, both gay and straight, were married.\n\nCameron’s younger sister, Candace Cameron Bure, who plays D.J. Fuller, formerly Tanner, on Netflix’s Fuller House, shares similar views to her brother. She recently made headlines when she said of her marriage to former NHLer Valeri Bure that submissiveness is key in a wife.\n\n“I love that my man is a leader,” she told HuffPo Live in 2014. “I want him to lead and be the head of the family and those decisions, major decisions, do fall on him. It doesn’t mean I don’t voice my opinion. It doesn’t mean I don’t have an opinion. I absolutely do. … “But it is very difficult to have two heads of authority.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nhttps://twitter.com/theunchurchva/status/726090826955157504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
