        "text": "MANSFIELD - Kirk Cameron, an alumnus of the television show \"Growing Pains,\" might be best known for his acting.\n\nBut as an evangelical Christian, Cameron is also a firm believer in the sanctity of marriage.\n\nThat's why he's hit the road this year with \"Living Room Reset,\" a marriage workshop that Cameron describes as an interactive date night. It stops here Wednesday night at Crossroads Church, 1188 Park Avenue West.\n\nCameron, who recently spoke to the News Journal just before milking cows in Iowa, said ever since appearing in 2008's \"Fireproof,\" he's seen a \"feverish hunger for help in making marriages flourish and thrive.\"\n\n\"Being able to give couples a date night to disconnect from distractions and be together in a place of worship where they can download truth that can set them free and their family and help them thrive, is terribly exciting for people,\" Cameron said.\n\n\"They'll sing together, laugh together, pray together and learn together.\"\n\nCameron will be joined by Matt Hammitt, formerly of Sanctus Real, and remotely by his wife Chelsea Noble, with whom he shares six kids.\n\n\"I like to say that Chelsea and I have been married for 28 years, which is something like 280 in Hollywood years,\" Cameron said.\n\nSome couples who attend his seminar are engaged while others come with their marriage \"hanging by a thread,\" Cameron said.\n\n\"A couple of times, I've had people come saying, 'We are divorced, we are not married, but we have never found anybody else, so we though we'd come together as friends, just to see what God might do in our relationship if we put him at the center,'\" Cameron said.\n\nWhile Cameron obviously didn't abscond with his family's actual living room furniture, he said he does bring personal belongings from his home onto the stage with him, like a Native American flute, or a squirrel pelt that his son made for him.\n\nIn addition to sharing personal stories about himself and his family, Cameron plans to talk about everything from \"Fireproof\" to his days on the set of \"Growing Pains.\"\n\nCameron, who played Mike Seaver, became an evangelical Christian when he was 17 at the height of the sitcom's popularity more than three decades ago.\n\nHe described a cute girl inviting him to visit her family on a Sunday, and they all went to a service.\n\n\"I think it was kind of a set up, now that I look back on it,\" Cameron said. \"I was an atheist at the time, and I heard this message.\"\n\n\"The preacher talked about the character of God and the message of the Gospel, and I left with a lot of questions that I eventually got answered. I found myself in my sports car, parked on the side of the road, at 17 years old, asking God to show me who he is, and to make me who he created me to be.\"\n\n\"That began my journey of going to Church, reading the Bible, and wanting to be a follower of Christ.\"\n\nCameron said finding God while being involved with the television show was difficult at times.\n\n\"The challenge in 'Growing Pains' was a different set of values, different sensibilities, dealing with people who may have thought that because I didn't want to sleep with my girlfriend on the show, they may have viewed that as a power move or celebrity muscle being flexed,\" Cameron said. \"Whereas, I was like, 'No, I just think it's not the right thing to do when we have little kids looking up to my character as a role model.'\"\n\nDave Vance, lead pastor at Crossroads Church, likens Cameron's program to an espresso shot for couples. He plans to attend with his wife.\n\n\"As marriage goes, the community goes,\" Vance said. \"As marriage goes, the culture goes. There is a growing trend of a lack of commitment in our culture.\"\n\n\"For us, we think as a community, we're going to be so much better to have Kirk Cameron come with his story, his experience, and his wisdom. He has a lot of credibility because he's lived a life that many people model in the sense of, we look to Hollywood for some of these pictures, and he's been able to live it differently with his wife.\"\n\nFor tickets, visit Crossroads Church website, at crossroadswired.com.\n\nmtrombly@gannett.com\n\n419-521-7205\n\nTwitter: @monroetrombly"
