        "text": "Kirk Cameron is once again sparking conversations with his conservative views on marriage.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Christian Post, the former Growing Pains star said, “Wives are to honor and respect and follow their husband’s lead, not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband. When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage.”\n\nCameron – an outspoken evangelical Christian who has been married to actress Chelsea Noble, 51, since 1991 – is currently on a tour called “Love Worth Fighting For,” a Bible-based event intended to teach others how to “strengthen and encourage your marriage.”\n\nIn the interview, he added that “a lot of people don’t know that marriage comes with instructions,” and “we find them right there in God’s word.”\n\nThe 45-year-old father of six isn’t the only one in his family with these strong beliefs. His younger sister, Candace Cameron Bure, made headlines after she discussed being submissive in her marriage to former NHL pro Valeri Bure, 41.\n\n“I love that my man is a leader,” she told HuffPo Live in 2014. “I want him to lead and be the head of the family and those decisions, major decisions, do fall on him. It doesn’t mean I don’t voice my opinion. It doesn’t mean I don’t have an opinion. I absolutely do.”\n\nAdded Cameron Bure, 40: “But it is very difficult to have two heads of authority.”"
