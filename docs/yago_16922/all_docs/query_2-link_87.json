And, we find them right there in God’s word [in the Bible].”\n\nCameron, a devout Evangelical Christian, has expressed controversial views on marriage in the past. In 2012 he described his disapproval of gay relationships, calling them “unnatural” and “ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilisation”.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
