        "text": "Ex-TV star Kirk Cameron is coming to Indy. Why?\n\nWhy is former “Growing Pains” TV star Kirk Cameron coming to Indy?\n\nAnd why is he doling out marriage advice?\n\nCameron, who’s now 42, laughed when asked whether he was a marriage expert. “I’m a work in progress,” he admitted Wednesday, during a telephone interview from his home near Los Angeles.\n\n“The best advice I can give isn’t with my mouth; it’s with my life. Loving God and loving my family,” said Cameron, a husband, father of six, and a Christian who now shares personal stories and marriage advice through his films and marriage conferences at churches around the nation.\n\nBut why should we listen to the former teenage heart throb — a guy who grew up on television in the 1980s and who was a self-confirmed atheist, who “mocked the very existence of God.”\n\nCameron married Chelsea Noble, the actress who played the teen Mike Seaver’s girlfriend on the sitcom, and they have been married 23 years. Their children are ages 10-16. “Marriage is really a school where you learn how to lay down your preferences and serve someone else,” he said.\n\nCameron, who doesn’t consider himself an evangelist, said he aims to point people in a positive direction, at the Feed Your Faith nonprofit ministry’s “Love Worth Fighting For” marriage conference.\n\nTwo events — at 7 p.m. Aug. 16 at Indian Creek Christian Church in Indianapolis and at 6 p.m. Saturday at the First Church of the Nazarene in Kokomo — kick off the second leg of Cameron’s 30-city tour that ends in South Carolina in November. Tickets, including a VIP question-and-answer and autograph session at each venue, are still available.\n\nCameron talked about his own “growing pains,” what brings him to Indianapolis, and the non-advice he gives his own teenagers.\n\nQuestion: What was it like to be a teenage heartthrob in the 1980s?\n\nAnswer: That was just my normal. I didn’t have a different teenage life to compare it to. You worked at Warner Brothers Studios, and then when I went home, people would stop me on the streets and ask for my autograph. It was fun.\n\nQ: What good came out of “Growing Pains?”\n\nA: Ultimately, I met my wife, Chelsea, and through “Growing Pains, all of my other career opportunities have come. The good was better than good; it was great.\n\nQ: Was there anything not so great about being on TV?\n\nA: It’s a difficult life to have growing up, when you’re living in a fish bowl with millions of people watching your every move, feeling like they have the right to comment on every decision that you make and every word that you say. Ultimately, I would look to my parents and to my faith in God to thank for helping me not go down that road.\n\nQ: As a teenager, you called yourself an atheist “who mocked God.” What caused you to change your views?\n\nA: It may sound funny when you hear me say this: But I would still be an atheist today, if it wasn’t for God. I think that God opened my eyes and turned me around during a time when I was honestly looking for answers to important questions, like “Why are we here?” “How did we get here in the first place?” and “Are we just a lucky planet?”\n\nQ: At 17, you started thinking about God?\n\nA: Those questions, combined with an actor from “Growing Pains” who invited me to church one Sunday, really sent me on a journey to answer those questions. I started reading the Bible, and I was just captivated by that book. That was the beginning of my becoming a Christian and going to church, and pointing my life in a new direction.\n\nQ: What is the “Love Worth Fighting For” conference about?\n\nA: It’s a three-hour event designed to learn what marriage is about, how to make it work, how to make it last, how to find forgiveness, and how to get rid of bitterness. It’s an evening of music and humor and personal stories.\n\nQ: You have a new movie coming out this fall?\n\nA: It’s called “Unstoppable.” My world was rocked when a friend of mine died. In the movie, I tackle the question, “Why does God let bad things happen to good people?” It’s one night only, Sept. 24, a live broadcast into 700 theaters across the country, an all-ages event, a kind of visual diary that takes a very interesting and fresh approach. I play myself, the guide, and your host.\n\nQ: Now, with teenagers of your own, what kind of advice do you give your own kids.\n\nA: A lot of parents don’t realize that all of the teaching in the world, all of the best advice that you can give your kids, is nothing compared to the life that you live in front of your kids. The only way your kids are going to learn, is by example.\n\n— Call Star reporter Betsy Reason at (317) 444-6049 or follow her on Twitter @BetsyReason"
