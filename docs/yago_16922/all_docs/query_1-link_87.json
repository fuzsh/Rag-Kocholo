        "text": "It has been reported that the children’s book written by actor Kirk Cameron, titled “As You Grow,” has been denied the request to be featured at the story hour of over 50 public libraries.\n\nThe “Growing Pains” star, who is the older brother of Candace Cameron Bure, has been married to former “Growing Pains” actress Chelsea Noble since 1991. The couple has six children, four of whom were adopted.\n\nAfter his rise to fame playing the character Mike Seaver, Cameron has gone on to star in a number of Christian films, including, “Fireproof,” “Left Behind,” and “Lifemark.”\n\nIn December 2020, Cameron drew criticism for organizing a Christmas carol event in California that attracted a large crowd, despite COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on public gatherings.\n\nRELATED: ‘Public Enemy No. 1’—Kirk Cameron’s New Documentary Takes on Public Education\n\n“If you love God, if you love Christmas, and you love liberty, you’re not going to want to miss this,” Cameron beckoned in a promotional video at the time.\n\nRegarding the event, Cameron told Fox News, “I’m looking around and I’m seeing the devastation and the suffering of people whose businesses have been bankrupted, people dealing with anxiety, depression, suicide is spiking, the abused being quarantined with their abusers, and I can’t just ignore that. I love my neighbors and so I want to give them hope.”\n\nNow, Cameron is calling attention to the nation’s public libraries, which are funded by tax-payer money, for rejecting his Christian children’s book.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Cameron’s book publisher, Brave Books, has reached out to over 50 public libraries in the hopes of having the actor read his book during story hour.\n\nRELATED: Christmas Display Featuring ‘Gender Queer’ Alongside Bible Removed by VA Library After Outcry\n\nCameron describes “As You Grow” as a book that “teaches biblical wisdom and the value of producing the fruit of the spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control.”\n\n“All of the libraries that we have contacted have hosted LGBTQ+ story times with drag queens in the past,” Brave Books said. To date, the publisher shared that they haven’t been approved for a single reading of Cameron’s new children’s book."
