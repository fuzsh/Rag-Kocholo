        "text": "Former \"Growing Pains\" TV sitcom star Kirk Cameron long ago traded in his teen idol fame and has transformed himself into a high-profile Christian evangelist.\n\nHe's continued to act in Christian-themed productions such as \"Fireproof,\" which turned into the most successful independent movie released in 2008 with gross ticket sales of more than $33 million.\n\nStill one of the most recognizable faces in TV sitcom history, Cameron will be one of the featured speakers at a fundraiser for King's Home in Chelsea, called \"Kampfire for the King,\" Sunday from 2 to 8 p.m.\n\n\"It's gonna be a fun time, with a campfire and music,\" Cameron said. Proceeds benefit King's Home, the new name for King's Ranch and Hannah Homes, which house about 160 abused women, children and youth. King's Ranch and Hannah Homes had merged their services in 1998 but kept their names. The King's Ranch youth program has served about 50 boys and girls ages 10 to 21 in nine residential homes on two campuses. The Hannah Homes ministry for women and children escaping domestic violence has nine residential group homes in three counties.\n\nSunday's event is a chance to bring hope and Christmas spirit to women and children who have experienced difficult circumstances, Cameron said.\n\nCameron, who married his former \"Growing Pains\" co-star Chelsea Noble, has a big family of his own. They have six children, two biological and four adopted.\n\nCameron said he looks forward to Christmas celebrations at his California home.\n\n\"We usually have a big dinner at our house,\" he said. Extended family also attend. \"It's a crazy fun day, a big sitdown dinner at our place.\"\n\nChristmas day in California may also include the beach. \"We go out for a hike in the hills, or on the beach on Christmas morning,\" Cameron said.\n\nChristmas has a deeper meaning for him now than when he was a child, he said.\n\n\"When I was a kid, I was an atheist, so Christmas meant nothing more than Santa and presents,\" Cameron said.\n\nAs a born-again Christian, he now tries to focus the season on Jesus.\n\n\"Sometimes we have family devotions at nighttime at the dinner table, we get out an Advent calendar, talk about what we see, open our Bibles, read, the kids will pray and ask for God's blessing on the food,\" Cameron said. \"We'll sit around the table and talk about what Christmas means and who Jesus is. Christmas is a great time for me to step up to the plate as a dad.\"\n\nCameron said he sometimes takes friends to a shopping mall in December to sing Christmas carols. \"That gives an opportunity to talk to the crowd about the birth of Christ,\" he said.\n\nCameron continues to co-host the evangelistic TV show \"The Way of the Master,\" which airs on Trinity Broadcasting Network.\n\n\"We're working on a fourth season,\" Cameron said. \"We have conferences around the country, books, CDs, DVDs.\"\n\nHe had an unexpected movie hit with \"Fireproof,\" in which he portrayed a Georgia firefighter struggling in his marriage.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised,\" Cameron said. \"When I read the script, I knew immediately it would strike a chord with people.\"\n\nAlthough he was a famous actor nominated for Golden Globes for his work on \"Growing Pains\" from 1985 to '92, Cameron had to audition for the church production, which didn't offer a salary.\n\nIt was done by Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Ga., where media pastor Alex Kendrick and his brother, Stephen, had gotten the church into movie producing with \"Flywheel,\" which they made for $20,000 and turned into DVD sales of more than 36,000. All their movies have Christian messages. \"Facing the Giants\" grossed more than $10 million at the box office in 2006 and sold more than 1 million DVDs.\n\n\"Fireproof\" was made with a budget of about $500,000.\n\n\"I had to audition for the part just like the amateurs at their church,\" Cameron said. \"Everyone went into this with the understanding that nobody's getting paid. I wanted to help the church that made the movie 'Facing the Giants' and help them hit it out of the park.\"\n\nCameron, 40, has now been active in Christian ministry for more than two decades. He and his wife started Camp Firefly while they were still on \"Growing Pains\" because they wanted to help the children who came to meet them through the Make a Wish Foundation. It's a summer camp for terminally ill children.\n\n\"It was a chance to forget about cancer, make friends, inspire their faith in God,\" Cameron said. \"It's in its 20th year.\"\n\nCameron said he is trying his hand at producing a documentary, \"Monumental,\" that will be released next year.\n\n\"It's about how we save America,\" he said. \"It's about the Christian heritage of America.\"\n\nOther speakers at Kampfire for the King will include Matt Pitt, founder of The Basement, and evangelist David Nasser. Tickets are $15 at the gate, or $10 in advance, available at the website, www.kampfirefortheking.org. For more information on King's Home, see the website, www.kingshome.com."
