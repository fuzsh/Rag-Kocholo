        "text": "'Growing Pains' star says marriage worth fighting for\n\nWhy is former 1980s teen TV star Kirk Cameron, star of the sitcom Growing Pains, doling out marriage advice â€” especially after he's stirred controversy in recent years with his outspoken opposition to homosexual marriage?\n\nCameron, who has progressed from atheism to conservative Christianity, raised the ire of members of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered community and others with comments made in a March 2012 interview with TV talk-show host Piers Morgan and statements since.\n\nIn the Morgan interview, he called gay marriage \"destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization\" and called homosexuality \"unnatural.\" He has defended himself by saying he was a victim of attacks from the liberal media.\n\nCameron, 42, who's in Indianapolis this week for the Feed Your Faith nonprofit ministry's \"Love Worth Fighting For\" marriage conferences, laughed this week when asked if he was a marriage expert.\n\n\"I'm a work in progress,\" he said Wednesday, during a telephone interview from his home near Los Angeles.\n\nWhy should we listen to the former teen star, a guy who says he once was a self-confirmed atheist who \"mocked the very existence of God.\"\n\n\"The best advice I can give isn't with my mouth; it's with my life. Loving God and loving my family,\" Cameron said.\n\nHe's a husband, father of six, and a Christian who likes to share his personal stories and marriage advice through his films and marriage conferences nationwide.\n\nCameron wed Chelsea Noble, the actress who played the girlfriend of teen Mike Seaver, his character on the Growing Pains sitcom, and they have been married 23 years. Their children are ages 10-16.\n\nCameron said marriage is not a \"you-make-me-happy contract,\" but rather an opportunity to put aside your personal preferences and serve someone else.\n\n\"Marriage is a school that can produce that in you or your spouse if you stay in school, and you graduate the class and you follow the course instructions,\" Cameron said. \"You find them in the Bible, the best advice in the world on being a husband or a wife. We pull those out, sing about them, talk about them, tell stories based on those principles.\"\n\nCameron's appearances in the Indianapolis area this weekend are the start of the second leg of his 30-city tour, which ends in South Carolina in November.\n\nQ: As a teenager, you called yourself an atheist \"who mocked God.\" What caused you to change your views?\n\nA: It may sound funny when you hear me say this, but I would still be an atheist today, if it wasn't for God. I think that God opened my eyes and turned me around during a time when I was honestly looking for answers to important questions, like \"Why are we here?\" \"How did we get here in the first place?\" and \"Are we just a lucky planet?\"\n\nQ: It must have been fun to have been a teen heartthrob in the 1980s. Was there anything not so great about growing up on TV?\n\nA: It's a difficult life to have growing up, when you're living in a fish bowl with millions of people watching your every move, feeling like they have the right to comment on every decision that you make and every word that you say. Ultimately, I would look to my parents and to my faith in God to thank for helping me not go down that road.\n\nQ: At 17, you started thinking about God?\n\nA: Those questions, combined with an actor from Growing Pains who invited me to church one Sunday, really sent him me on a journey to answer those questions. I started reading the Bible, and I was just captivated by that book. That was the beginning of my becoming a Christian and going to church, and pointing my life in a new direction. It was a direction that I believed was the right direction to live my life in a way to say 'thank you' to the one who made me.\n\nQ: What is the \"Love Worth Fighting For\" conference about?\n\nA: It's a three-hour event designed to learn what marriage is about, how to make it work, how to make it last, how to find forgiveness, and how to get rid of bitterness. It's an evening of music and humor and personal stories.\n\nQ: Now, with teenagers of your own, what kind of advice do you give your own kids?"
