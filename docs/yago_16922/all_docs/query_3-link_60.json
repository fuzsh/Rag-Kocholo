        "text": "He's in town to bring a Bible-based message of hope to couples.\n\nPicture actor Kirk Cameron in the passenger seat of his manager's black BMW 530i as it cuts its way through the streets of Hollywood.\n\nIt's Tuesday morning there but already afternoon in Jacksonville, where a Times-Union reporter is quizzing Cameron, whom millions remember as the adorable and witty Mike Seaver on \"Growing Pains,\" about a marriage seminar he will be leading on Sunday at First Baptist Church in Orange Park.\n\nCameron, 40, is on his way to a meeting about a film he's working on called \"Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure.\"\n\nThe conversation changes to that project, then to Cameron, who's become known as much for his evangelization efforts as his acting in the past 20 years. Since the show \"Growing Pains\" ended in 1992, he has become one of the leading male actors in Christian films, starring in movies like the \"Left Behind\" series and 2008's \"Fireproof.\"\n\nHere's some of what Cameron had to say about acting, marriage, ministry and film.\n\nChristian entertainment, especially Christian film, has been rapped for low budget and low quality. Do you feel that's improving?\n\nThere's been a lot of cheesy stuff that's comes out that focuses on Christianity and the gospel. I think that has been improving as technology has become more affordable for people. ... There's been a real market for really quality movies that focus on Christianity and the gospel.\n\nWith faith-based films, is it better to go with a direct message and maybe reach a smaller audience, or with a softer sell that possibly reaches more people?\n\nThis is a great question and I'd love to sit down with you for an hour over coffee and talk about it. But it's about how you view the gospel. ... I think you need to be full throttle with the gospel all the time. ... But God never puts a cross in the sky; he puts a rainbow or a sunset. All those things point to the gospel and can be starting points for a conversation about the cross. So I'm saying both.\n\nWhat's this 'Monumental' film project you're working on these days?\n\nWhen you look at the debt and morally where we're headed as a nation, spiritually I think there's something sick in the soul of our country. ... So [in the film] I follow the escape route of the pilgrims, from ... the underground meeting places, all the way to the Mayflower and Plymouth Rock. They left us with clues that will help us deal with the challenges that we are dealing with today. We just need to decode those clues. What I found was jaw-dropping - it's monumental.\n\nWhat was the before-after moment that led you to your current career and ministry path?\n\nI was an atheist until I was 17 or 18 years old and right in the middle of \"Growing Pains.\" Things were going great on the outside, but internally I was asking a lot of questions: What happens when you die and how did we get here in the first place? Someone took me to church and I heard the gospel presented for the first time ... and that launched me on to this journey.\n\nWhat kind of church do you belong to now?\n\nIt's a small church, probably 75 people, a community Bible teaching church in Los Angeles.\n\nWhat will those attending \"Love Worth Fighting For\" experience?\n\nYou are going to see me and [musician] Warren [Barfield] and 2,000 people who believe their marriage is worth fighting for. If your marriage is strong, great, and we give principles to keep it strong. If it's struggling ... you come to this event to learn how to get on the right track and understand how God is the centerpiece of your marriage. We are going to use \"Fireproof\" as the backdrop.\n\nSo is it you basically giving a sermon about marriage?\n\nThere's a concert right in the middle of it ... and I'll be giving a teaching straight out of God's word on marriage. I've been married 20 years and have six kids, so I'll bring my wisdom and some personal stories and advice on how to make marriage strong and healthy.\n\nLast question: Can you give 'Growing Pains' fans a behind-the-scenes anecdote from the show?\n\nAt the \"Love Worth Fighting For\" event there will be a moment that's a throwback to the '80s. I'll be morphing into Mike Seaver at one point that's pretty funny.\n\njeff.brumley@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4310"
