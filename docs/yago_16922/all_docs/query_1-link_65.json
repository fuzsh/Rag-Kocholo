        "text": "In 1988, Noble appeared on Full House while she was dating series star, John Stamos.[2][3] She also appeared on several episodes of Days of Our Lives. She co-starred on Growing Pains and Kirk with Kirk Cameron.\n\nNoble appeared in a 1997 episode of Seinfeld titled \"The English Patient\". She co-starred as Hattie Durham in the Left Behind trilogy with her husband Kirk. Prior to the Left Behind movies, Chelsea and Kirk co-starred in A Little Piece of Heaven with Cloris Leachman.[4][5]\n\nNoble has had several uncredited cameos in films starring Cameron as a \"kissing double\". Kirk Cameron refused to kiss any woman who was not his wife, so for romantic scenes, the actress playing his love interest would be replaced by Noble in an appropriate costume and filmed from a distance or behind.[6] This can be seen in the fire station scene of Fireproof."
