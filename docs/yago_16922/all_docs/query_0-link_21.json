        "text": "This article is out of universe from Left Behind. This subject has been distinguished as part of the real world and should not be taken as part of the fictional universe of the Left Behind franchise.\n\nChelsea Noble (born December 4, 1964) is an American actress. She played Hattie Durham in all three Left Behind films of the original trilogy.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBorn as Nancy Mueller, alias Chelsea Noble, in Buffalo, New York. She has one brother named David. She and her brother are both adopted. They were raised by parents Irene and Fred Mueller. After graduating from Maryvale High School, Noble attended SUNY Geneseo in Geneseo, New York from 1983 to 1987. During her college years at SUNY Geneseo, Noble was a member of the Alpha Clionian (Phi Kappa Pi) sorority and played womenâ€™s rugby\n\nChelsea is known mostly for her role in the American television series Growing Pains. She played \"Kate\", the romantic interest of the character Mike, portrayed by Kirk Cameron. Noble and Cameron would later marry in real life on July 20, 1991, and have six children: four adopted and two biological.\n\nShe also had several uncredited cameos in films starring Cameron as a \"kissing double.\" Kirk Cameron refused to kiss any woman who was not his wife, so for romantic scenes the actress playing his love interest would be replaced by Noble in an appropriate costume and filmed from a distance or behind. This can be seen in the fire station scene of Fireproof.\n\nIn 2014, she co-starred with her husband in the independent movie Mercy Rule, playing a married couple with two children. Although not the first movie in which they have played husband and wife (having done so in two Growing Pains TV movies), this is the first time she has been credited as Chelsea Cameron.\n\nNoble shares her husband's conservative Christian faith. She and Cameron founded The Firefly Foundation, which sponsors camping trips for terminally ill children and their families."
