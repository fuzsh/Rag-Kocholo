        "text": "Former Growing Pains heartthrob Kirk Cameron may not look very attractive to women right about now.\n\nCameron, a devout born-again Christian (he began that journey when he was 17), expressed his views on successful marriage to the Christian Post, saying that women should “follow” their husbands, no matter what.\n\n“Wives are to honour and respect and follow their husband’s lead, not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband,” he said. “When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage.”\n\nREAD MORE: Kirk Cameron wins Worst Actor at the 2015 Razzies\n\nThe ’80s sitcom star added, “A lot of people don’t know that marriage comes with instructions. And we find them right there in God’s word.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCameron’s words are not without context, at least in terms of the Bible: in Colossians 3:18-19 the book states: “Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.”\n\nCameron has six children with his wife and fellow actress, Chelsea Noble, who he married in 1991.\n\nHis sister, well-known Full House actress Candace Cameron Bure, seems to agree with her brother when it comes to “submissive” wives, though according to Bure, it’s not “submissive” by modern society’s definition.\n\n“The definition I’m using with the word ‘submissive’ is the biblical definition of that,” wrote Bure in her 2014 book, Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose. “So, it is meekness, it is not weakness. It is strength under control, it is bridled strength. And that’s what I choose to have in my marriage.”\n\nREAD MORE: Candace Cameron Bure calls Full House TV movie “a joke”\n\nWhile Cameron says that wives should be submissive to their husbands, he also has some words for the men: don’t start arguments or get in heated disagreements with your wives.\n\n“Thinking that you are going to win an argument, you end up losing. It’s a no-win situation,” Cameron said to the Christian Post. “In order for you to win, your husband or wife has to lose. When they lose, you have not built up your marriage. You have really cut them down. When couples start arguing and fighting in front of the kids, dad cuts mom and mom cuts dad and the kids bleed. They see that and it damages them. When the kids get to marriage, they will follow patterns that they see.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nNeedless to say, the Twitter audience was less than impressed with Cameron’s point-of-view.\n\nTrending Now\n\nSuper blue moon will be ‘biggest and brightest’ of the year.
