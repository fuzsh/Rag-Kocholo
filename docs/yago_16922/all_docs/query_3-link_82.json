        "text": "Kirk Cameron is getting controversial … again. The Growing Pains alum and evangelical Christian offered up marriage advice — which might be unsettling for some, to say the least — in a new interview with the Christian Post.\n\n“Wives are to honor and respect and follow their husband’s lead, not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband. When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage,” Cameron, 45, said earlier this month. “A lot of people don’t know that marriage comes with instructions. And, we find them right there in God’s word [in the Bible].”\n\nThe former child star also had rules for husbands. He noted that men should love their wives, but shouldn’t tell them “to submit to them.”\n\nCameron has given his two cents about how women should behave before. “Let your children, your family, see your joy in the way that you decorate your home this Christmas, in the food that you cook, the songs you sing, the stories you tell, and the traditions that you keep,” he said in a holiday-themed Facebook video in November 2014. “Invite your whole neighborhood into your Christmas, and invite the world into our story of our king and his kingdom.”\n\nCameron’s conservative views on the LGBT community also haven’t gone over well. Back in 2012, he called homosexuality “unnatural” during an interview with CNN. Then-GLAAD Senior Director of Programs Herndon Graddick released a statement following the broadcast.\n\n“Cameron is out of step with a growing majority of Americans, particularly people of faith who believe that their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters should be loved and accepted based on their character and not condemned because of their sexual orientation,” Graddick told Us Weekly in a statement at the time.\n\nKirk, who is the older brother of Fuller House’s Candace Cameron Bure, has been married to actress Chelsea Noble since 1991. The couple are parents to six children — Jack, 20, Isabella, 18, Anna, 17, Luke, 16, Olivia, 14, and James, 13."
