        "text": "He’ll always be Mr. Seaver. Kirk Cameron paid tribute to his Growing Pains costar Alan Thicke via Instagram on Wednesday, December 14.\n\nAs previously reported, Thicke died of a heart attack at age 69 on Tuesday. According to TMZ, he was playing hockey with his 19-year-old son, Carter, when he had to be rushed to Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California.\n\n“I spent Monday through Friday for seven important years with Alan Thicke as my ‘TV dad,'” Cameron, 46, captioned a throwback pic of himself and Thicke on the set of the beloved family series. “I’m shocked and truly heartbroken today at the news of his death. Alan was a generous, kind and loving man. I am so blessed to have grown up with him.”\n\nThe former child star played Mike Seaver, son of Thicke’s Dr. Jason Seaver, from 1985 to 1992. Cameron actually met his wife, Chelsea Noble, when she played his love interest on the show from 1989 to 1992. They married in 1991 and are parents of six children.\n\n“Chelsea and I send our love and prayers to his family tonight,” Cameron added on Wednesday. “We will cherish the memories… ‘sharing the laughter and love.'”\n\nCameron’s younger sister, actress Candace Cameron Bure, also sent her condolences. Cameron Bure, 40, who guest-starred on Growing Pains, recently worked with Thicke when he appeared in an episode on the second season of Fuller House.\n\n“I’m sad beyond words that Alan Thicke has passed away. I’ve known you since I was 8 years old and so glad I had the pleasure of working with you again so recently on Fuller House,” she captioned a pic of the two from the Netflix series. “You were a part of my family and hockey family. You will be greatly missed. My heart hurts.”"
