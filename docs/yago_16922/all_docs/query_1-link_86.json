        "text": "Background\n\nKirk Thomas Cameron was born on October 12, 1970, in Los Angeles, California. His parents are Barbara and Robert Cameron, a retired school teacher, and he has three sisters named Bridgette, Melissa, and Candace. Candace Cameron Bure is also an actress and is known for her role as D.J. Tanner on the sitcom “Full House.” Cameron didn’t go to ‘normal’ school with other children. Instead, he attended school on the set of “Growing Pains.” He did attend some classes during production breaks and graduated from Chatsworth High School in 1988 with honors.\n\nCameron began acting when he was nine years old and his first role was in a cereal commercial. His first big break came when he was 13 after landing a role in the T.V. series, “The Two Marriages.” After that, he was cast in the role of Mike Seaver in the popular ABC T.V. series, “Growing Pains.” This would later become a staple of U.S. television and Cameron acted in this role from 1985 to 1992 and was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. Due to his role on the show, Cameron became a teen heartthrob and appeared on the covers of various teen magazines of the time. Since the 2000s, Cameron has mostly left film and T.V. and has starred in two reunions of “Growing Pains,” including “The Growing Pains Movie,” and “Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers.” In the 2010s, Cameron starred in, produced, and narrated several films, including “Monumental: In Search of America’s National Treasure” in 2012, “Unstoppable” in 2013, “Mercy Rule” and “Saving Christmas” in 2014, and “Extraordinary” in 2017.\n\nAside from acting, Cameron is also a devoted Evangelical Christian and runs the ministry ‘The Way of the Master’ together with his partner, Ray Comfort. Cameron also founded The Firefly Foundation with his wife, Chelsea Noble."
