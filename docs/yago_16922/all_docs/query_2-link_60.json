        "text": "Chelsea Noble was just beginning her acting career when she appeared on the ABC sitcom \"Growing Pains.\" The pretty blonde actress soon fell in love with the show's young star, Kirk Cameron. The pair married in 1991 and, with the exception of a single \"Seinfeld\" episode, Noble has since only worked with Cameron on various acting projects. Cameron famously converted to Christianity during \"Growing Pains\"' seven season run, and since then, he has only lent his talent to works that project his Christian faith. They appeared together for two seasons on the WB sitcom \"Kirk,\" where she played a neighbor slowly warming to Kirk's charm. She has also appeared with Kirk in three films of the \"Left Behind\" series, which takes place after the Christian prophecy of The Rapture has whisked all faithful off the planet during its final days. There have also been \"Growing Pains\" reunion specials in which Noble has taken part, but her acting career has taken a backseat to her charity work, which includes the Firefly Foundation, which runs a summer camp for terminally ill children."
