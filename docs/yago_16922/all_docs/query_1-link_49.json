        "text": "Once a teen heartthrob known as television’s sharp-witted Mike Seaver on ABC’s long-running sitcom \"Growing Pains,\" actor Kirk Cameron is now touring the country with his faith-based marriage seminar Love Worth Fighting For.\n\nCameron brings the program back to Ocala on Sunday, where he will help couples strengthen and restore their marriages and relationships.\n\nIn 2008, Cameron starred in \"Fireproof,\" a film about a firefighter who was fighting desperately to save his struggling marriage. This film would later serve as the inspiration for the Love Worth Fighting For tour, which includes clips from \"Fireproof,\" as well as “fun personal stories from ‘Growing Pains,’\" he said.\n\n\"Love Worth Fighting For is a ... date night for you and your husband or wife,” he said last week during a phone interview.\n\nHe encourages people to “come to learn how to strengthen and fireproof the most important relationship you have. Whether you have been married for 20 years or 20 days, you can expect that you are going to laugh together, shed a few tears together, pray together, sing together and learn together.”\n\nThe event will feature special musical guest, Warren Barfield, a noted Christian artist who wrote \"Love is Not a Fight,\" the theme song to \"Fireproof.\" For the past seven years, Cameron and Barfield have reached hundreds of thousands of people across the country in an effort to help couples “understand why marriage is so important, and how to make a marriage great and last a lifetime,” Cameron said.\n\nDivorce and separation are common in the United States, affecting up to 50 percent of all married couples, according to the American Psychological Association.\n\n“Nobody goes to the alter thinking that it is all going to blow up in their face. We want it to work, but many of us have just never been taught,” Cameron said. “Marriage is perfect, but people are not. I think that marriage is perfect because God made marriage. What is not perfect are the people that enter into marriage.\"\n\nCameron and his wife, Chelsea Noble, an actress who starred as his on-screen girlfriend on \"Growing Pains,\" have been married for 25 years and have six children together.\n\nWhen asked why he has chosen to pursue this mission in particular, he said “marriage is the foundation upon which my family is built. If I want to go somewhere as a family, but I am arguing and bickering with my wife, the family isn’t going to be very effective.”\n\nHe and his wife believe that by strengthening the foundation of their marriage, their family will have “an opportunity for blessing, fruitfulness and strength and lasting power for the next 50 years.”\n\nCameron emphasized the importance of forgiveness in a marriage.\n\n“If you do nothing else, learn how to forgive. If you have two people who are skilled forgivers, you can get through a lot,” he said.\n\n“Laughing and having fun, that’s the easy part. It’s the selfishness that comes in that begins to poison your marriage and you get hurt, and you feel disrespected or unappreciated. Then all of a sudden, bitterness creeps in and if there isn’t an ability to forgive and move forward, and not hold past hurts over somebody’s head, then it doesn’t matter how funny you are, or how much fun you used to have, you are going to be shackled to the past.”\n\nHis message reached many people when he appeared at First Baptist Church in Ocala in 2011, said Jennifer Gaddis, the wife of Darren Gaddis, the church's senior pastor. She said Sunday’s event is expected to have an even larger turnout, with church groups traveling to Ocala from Tampa and Orlando to attend. The Rev. Don DePew, Jr., FBC's pastor for worship, said they are looking forward to Cameron’s return, adding “so many marriages were saved and rescued as a result of this event.”\n\nAmong those in the audience in 2011 were Amanda Phillips and Nick Warren of Belleview.\n\n\"'Love Worth Fighting For gave us a whole new perspective on relationships and marriage,\" Phillips said. \"Even though we aren't married yet, we both walked away with a new respect for the role that each partner plays. We have since put our newfound knowledge to use in our own relationship, we can't wait to go back again this year.\"\n\nPhillips and Warren will be married later this year."
