        "text": "American actress\n\nChelsea Cameron (née Noble; born December 4, 1964[1]) is an American actress. She is known for her role as Kate McDonnell on the ABC television sitcom Growing Pains (1989–1992). She is married to her former Growing Pains and Kirk co-star, Kirk Cameron. She is the sister-in-law of former Full House star Candace Cameron Bure.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1988, Noble appeared on Full House while she was dating series star, John Stamos.[2][3] She also appeared on several episodes of Days of Our Lives. She co-starred on Growing Pains and Kirk with Kirk Cameron.\n\nNoble appeared in a 1997 episode of Seinfeld titled \"The English Patient\". She co-starred as Hattie Durham in the Left Behind trilogy with her husband Kirk. Prior to the Left Behind movies, Chelsea and Kirk co-starred in A Little Piece of Heaven with Cloris Leachman.[4][5]\n\nNoble has had several uncredited cameos in films starring Cameron as a \"kissing double\". Kirk Cameron refused to kiss any woman who was not his wife, so for romantic scenes, the actress playing his love interest would be replaced by Noble in an appropriate costume and filmed from a distance or behind.[6] This can be seen in the fire station scene of Fireproof.\n\nIn 2014, she co-starred with her husband in the independent movie Mercy Rule, playing a married couple with two children. Although not the first movie in which they have played husband and wife (having done so in two Growing Pains TV movies), this is the first time she has been credited as Chelsea Cameron.[7]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nNoble met Kirk Cameron when he was visiting his sister Candace on the set of Full House. They later co-starred on Growing Pains together.[8] The couple got married on July 21, 1991, in Cheektowaga, New York,[9] and have six children — four adopted, two biological.[10] Chelsea and Kirk are both Christians. They founded The Firefly Foundation, which runs Camp Firefly.[6][11]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1988 Full House Samantha Episodes: \"The Seven-Month Itch\" (Parts 1 & 2) Days of Our Lives Kristina Andropolous — 1988–1989 Who's the Boss?
