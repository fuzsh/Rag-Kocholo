        "text": "LaReeca Rucker\n\nThe Clarion-Ledger\n\nFormer teen heartthrob turned Christian actor/evangelist Kirk Cameron opened his presentation at Crossgates Baptist Church Saturday by leading the audience in the \"Growing Pains\" theme song, fitting lyrics for Cameron's \"Love Worth Fighting For\" marriage event.\n\n\"If you are a woman 30 to 40 years old, you may have had a crush on Mike Seaver,\" he said referencing his sitcom character and getting the fact that he was once a teen idol out of the way. \"You loved mullet hair styles, parachute pants and probably listened to a little Duran Duran. There's a name for that. It's called 'Seaver Fever' ... Guys, she should have YOUR poster on her bedroom wall now.\"\n\nMore than 450 people contracted 'Seaver Fever' for the noon presentation, added after the Saturday night presentation sold out with 1,147 tickets.\n\nThey entered the doors two by two. Couple after couple filtered past the tables of merchandise in the lobby and T-shirts that read \"I love my husband\" and \"My wife rocks.\"\n\nSoon Cameron got to the point.\n\n\"I cannot afford to fail at family,\" said the star of the popular Christian film \"Fireproof\" and the \"Left Behind\" movie series. Cameron has been married to actress and fellow \"Growing Pains\" star Chelsea Noble for the past 21 years. They have six children, four of whom were adopted.\n\n\"When I'm old and sick and getting ready to die, I want those people around me,\" he said. \"I don't want to fail those people ... I want to give you some principles that will help fireproof your marriage.\"\n\nWhen Cameron asked, audience members shouted out some of their marriage challenges that included money, intimacy, spending time together, communication and the death of a child.\n\n\"All these things can make a marriage challenging and difficult,\" Cameron said. \"Do you know what the mother of all challenges is in marriage and life? Selfishness and sin...\n\n\"If you are into porn, gossip about your spouse behind his or her back - you are showing very good evidence that you may not be saved.\"\n\nCameron said couples should also remember that \"there's only one person on the planet you can change, and it's not your spouse.\"\n\nJackson residents Nicole and Antonio Slaughter attended the event.\n\n\"We thought it might help strengthen our marriage and see what direction God wants us to go in,\" Nicole said.\n\nFlorence residents Hillary and Matt Homan also attended.\n\n\"Yesterday was our anniversary, and I heard they were having a marriage convention, so I thought it would be a good idea,\" Hillary said. \"We've been married six years.\"\n\nPaul Hand, marriage and family pastor at Crossgates Baptist Church, said Cameron's reputation as an actor may have drawn audiences, but they also came for the message.\n\n\"Half the ladies in the room had posters of him on their walls growing up,\" Hand said \"Lately, I think it's been his message through movies like 'Fireproof.'\"\n\nHand said he hopes the event touched those who attended.\n\n\"Right now, the divorce rate in our country is over 50 percent,\" he said \"That is no different inside and outside the church. The rates are the same.\n\n\"Our culture says the grass is always greener. Our culture says there's always something better out there. But it's God's will for marriage to last for a lifetime.\""
