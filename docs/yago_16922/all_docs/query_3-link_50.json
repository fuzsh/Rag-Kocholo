        "text": "Kirk Cameron is known by millions as “Mike Seaver” from the 1980’s hit sit-com, Growing Pains. Since then, he’s invested his time and energy into faith and family-focused films, television shows, and live events. These projects include Fireproof -the marriage-centered film that became the #1 inspirational movie of the year.\n\nKirk’s new talk show, Takeaways, airs weekly on Monday nights on TBN. Recently, he’s been featured in the national media for his American Campfire Revival: 100 day plan where he urges the family of faith to return to the principles that will bring blessing and protection to America. Kirk’s newest feature film with the Kendrick Brothers, called Lifemark, is about the value of life in the womb and the beauty of adoption.\n\nHe and his wife, Chelsea, met on the set of Growing Pains and have been married for 31 years and have raised wonderful children.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\n3:41 On not wanting to be an actor and finding God\n\nKirk talks about how he actually did not want to be an actor but his mom had a crazy idea about seeing an agent, but thanks to both of his parents focused more on family and health than money and fame.\n\n5:10 What faith provided\n\nKirk talks about the moral compass that it was to find faith.\n\n06:37 How I went from being an atheist to a man of faith\n\n07:19 About his Faith\n\nGrounding good and evil through the views of God. Even as a man who loves science, purpose, meaning, that all goes out the window without believing in God.\n\n09:35 The world’s starving for good hearted, faith-based men\n\nLarry and Kirk talk about how the world is starving for men that have high morals, values, that pray, that love their families, that are courageous and they both agree that there is one inside of all of us.\n\n10:31 Defeat your demons\n\nKirk Cameron talks about what it is like and gives examples of what dragons you have to slay on a personal level to become higher with yourself.\n\n14:11 Trust in god’s work and don’t lose your hope/faith\n\n16:08 What a day in the life of Kirk Cameron looks like\n\nKirk Cameron says that when he’s not traveling and has time to slow down, what he likes to do first thing in the morning is read the Bible, have some time with God and let Him be foremost in his mind. Through his faith he cares for his family as he prays for them. He fervently believes in being healthy in body, mind and spirit. As his children are grown and even married, for him the word of God is another way to communicate with them and share bible passages that inspire his family.\n\n18:31 The most important thing\n\nThe most important thing is that I need to be the kind of man that I want my sons to become.\n\nI need to try to be the kind of husband that my, my that, that my daughters can look at and see as a model for the kind of men they want to. and Mary, and leading by example I think is the most important thing that I can do. Um, staying in relationship with my kids and, uh, and then pointing them to their hope.\n\n20:29 On keeping a marriage strong\n\nKirk Cameron mentions that the key to have a strong and lasting marriage is moral integrity. Most women can’t stand to be in a marriage where they no longer love their husbands because they have lost their moral integrity, where they left behind loyalty, purity and faithfulness. Moral integrity is an investment for your marriage to last more than 30 years with your wife still in love with you.\n\n22:51 On stepping up for your marriage\n\nKirk talks about what stepping up means to lead yourself and your family with the help of God.\n\n23:13 On teaching repentance by owning your mistakes\n\nKirk Cameron shares his view on being open and honest and teaching your kids about repentance through example, not just telling them that they need to do it if they have done something wrong. It all starts with YOU.\n\n25:20 On his new movie “Lifemark”\n\n27:40 What is American Campfire Revival\n\n30:53 5 priorities of the Cameron family today\n\nLove God\n\nFamily First\n\nBe Kind\n\nTell the Truth\n\nWork Hard\n\nKirk Cameron’s Links"
