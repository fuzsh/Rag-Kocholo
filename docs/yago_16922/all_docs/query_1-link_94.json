        "text": "Biography\n\n1970 -\n\nActor\n\nKirk Thomas Cameron (born October 12, 1970), better known only as Kirk Cameron, is an American actor who was popular during the late 1980s and early 1990s for his role on the sitcom Growing Pains as Mike Seaver. He was born in Panorama City, California, and is the brother of Full House actress Candace Cameron. He is said to have been named after the character Captain James Kirk of the famed television series Star Trek.\n\nKirk Cameron became a teen idol around 1987, when he shared the cover of such magazines as Tiger Beat, Teen Beat, 16 and others, with such other famous teenagers as Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, as well as older teen idols such as Duran Duran, Bon Jovi and Ralph Macchio.\n\nCameron went on to make a number of films, including 1987's Like Father, Like Son, with Dudley Moore. In the movie, Moore plays a medical doctor and Cameron plays his rather irresponsible, MTV watching son. They interchange bodies to feel what it's like being one another.\n\nCameron met his wife, actress Chelsea Noble on the set of Growing Pains, where she played his girlfriend. They married in 1991 and have a family of six children (three daughters and three sons), four of whom are adopted.\n\nAlthough his fame dwindled somewhat after Growing Pains ended, Cameron has nevertheless kept on working on various productions through the years. His conversion to Christianity in the 1990s sent his career in a new direction. He has starred in the popular Christian end-times movies Left Behind: The Movie, Left Behind II: Tribulation Force, and Left Behind III: World War III, as well as a few other Christian themed movies (see film credits). His presence as a well-known Hollywood actor, albeit as a fading teen idol, brought much secular attention to the films as well.\n\nCurrently, he partners with evangelist Ray Comfort in spreading the Gospel of Jesus to people in America. They have a ministry together called The Way of the Master; a video series where they walk the street sharing the Gospel of Christ with ordinary civilians. They do this as an instructional tape to show Christians how to effectively share their faith, \"The way Jesus did.\" Hence the title of their program, \"The Way of the Master.\"\n\nReferences\n\nThis article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.
