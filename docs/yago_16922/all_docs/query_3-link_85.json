        "text": "Christian Today reports that Cameron is touring churches sharing marriage advice as part of the “Love Worth Fighting For” national marriage tour.\n\nCameron recently shared with The Christian Post some of the advice he shares while on the tour.\n\n\"A lot of people don't know that marriage comes with instructions,\" Cameron said. \"And, we find them right there in God's Word.\"\n\nHusbands are supposed “to love their wives and not to tell their wives that they need to submit to them,” he continued. However, “Wives are to honour and respect and follow their husbands' lead, not to tell their husband how he ought to be a better husband.\"\n\nCameron added that “When each person gets their part right, regardless of how their spouse is treating them, there is hope for real change in their marriage.”\n\nCameron has already visited over 200 churches during his time with the tour, which he has been a part of for seven years.\n\nCameron is married to fellow actress Chelsea Noble. The couple has six children, who Cameron says are growing up so fast.\n\n\"My two little girls are now beautiful young women and I could hardly believe it,\" he said on his Facebook video page.\n\nHe says he knows it won’t be long before he is giving his daughters away to begin their own marriages.\n\nPhoto courtesy: flickr.com\n\nPublication date: April 13, 2016"
