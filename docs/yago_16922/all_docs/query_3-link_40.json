        "text": "But as soon as the show was cancelled, Cameron’s career took a turn and his public image has shifted immeasurably in the nearly 30 years since the end of Growing Pains. Here’s where he is now.\n\nKirk Cameron the born-again Christian.\n\nWhen Cameron was first catapulted into mainstream fame, he was a “staunch atheist” who thought he “was just too smart to believe in a fairy tale like that,” he later wrote in ‘How Do You Know He's Real’.\n\nDuring the height of his career while on Growing Pains, he became a born-again Christian.\n\n\"I had everything that I wanted. I had as much money as I wanted to spend. I was travelling around the world meeting famous people. I was a famous person… But I met a man, who was the father of a girl that I liked, and I got to talking to this man, and he said, 'There’s still something that you don’t have, though, Kirk. You have a lot, but you don’t have the Lord'.\"\n\nThat one conversation ultimately sparked his curiosity and led to his conversion to Christianity, he explains. His religious path saw him isolate himself from his co-stars before the show was cancelled in 1992. Cameron did not keep in contact with his former colleagues.\n\n“I definitely kind of made an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life,” Cameron told Los Angeles Times in 2000. “I shifted my focus from 100 per cent on the show, to 100 per cent on [my new life], and left 0 per cent on the show - and even the friendships that were a part of that show. If I could go back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast - like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding.”\n\nKirk Cameron's wife.\n\nAfter converting to Christianity at the age of 17, Cameron fell in love with his Growing Pains co-star and on-screen girlfriend, Chelsea Noble.\n\nCountless controversies.\n\nOver the years, Cameron has been at the centre of a slew of controversies surrounding his staunchly conservative viewpoints.\n\nFrom his innocuous belief that the ‘perfect’ design of a banana - yes, the fruit - is proof of God’s existence, to his dangerous standpoint that homosexuality is “destructive”, the actor has publicly peddled his controversial perspectives for decades, despite the great level of backlash he receives every time.\n\nInfamously, Cameron sparked controversy for his homophobic views in 2012, when he expressed them during an interview on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight.\n\n\"Marriage is almost as old as dirt, and it was defined in the garden between Adam and Eve,” Cameron said. “One man, one woman for life till death do you part. So I would never attempt to try to redefine marriage. And I don't think anyone else should either,\" explains Cameron. \"So do I support the idea of gay marriage? No, I don't.”\n\nThe actor continued, calling homosexuality “unnatural... detrimental, and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilisation.”\n\nIn 2008, he played Caleb Holt in the drama film Fireproof, which is about a firefighter who saves his marriage by turning to God. As the New York Times said in their review of the film, “it hardly sounds like a recipe for box office success, let alone a best-selling book. But that’s what the film ‘Fireproof’ has spawned”.\n\nAlas, his next film was not as successful.\n\nIn 2014, Cameron starred in Saving Christmas, which is a film about a man named Christian who is concerned that Christmas has become too materialistic and too far removed from the Bible. So he tries to save it, by putting the “‘Christ’ back in ‘Christmas’”.\n\nThe film received a zero per cent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was voted the \"worst movie ever\" by IMDb users. In the Razzies - a sarcastic annual award show honouring the worst of film - Saving Christmas received four wins in the categories of worst picture, screenplay, actor and screen combo, which went to Cameron \"and his ego,\" according to CNN.\n\nIndeed, the once-Hollywood heartthrob has managed to transform his early career success into one that is now synonymous with controversies and critically-slammed films.\n\nFeature image: Getty.\n\nSign up for the \"Mamamia Daily\" newsletter.
