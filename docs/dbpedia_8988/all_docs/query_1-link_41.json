        "text": "Hometown: Midwest City, Oklahoma\n\nWhy CU Boulder? The opportunity to develop innovative research in ultrasound. Ultrasound is one of the most underused imaging modalities and I hope my research helps to make the modality more clinically viable.\n\nWhy serve on the GSAB? There were lots of mistakes I made during my first year that I wish I knew how to avoid; how do I conduct research, which classes to take, and lots more. I made avoidable mistakes and I joined the GSAB for the opportunity to help other graduate students who share that same feeling."
