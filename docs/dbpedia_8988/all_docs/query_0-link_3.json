        "text": "Ambergris Today has learned of the passing away of Mr. George Parham, the last of four Parham brothers who spent their final years in San Pedro. George is a born Sanpedrano who emigrated to the United States for many years but spent his last 30 years in his natal hometown. He is a member of the Parham Family who was related to the Blake Family through intermarriage.\n\nThe Parham family owned several coconut plantations and provided employment to many Sanpedranos in the coconut industry which was vibrant from 1900 to 1940. George and his wife owned large parcels of land along the north coast of Ambergris Caye and sold many parcels of land that today form part of our vibrant tourism and hotel accommodation industry of the Island.\n\nGeorge built the Sands Hotel right in the Center of the town where he and his wife Marie spent the latter part of his life as active members of this community. Mr. Parham was always proud of his ancestry and history of the Island and entertained many visitors showing them the remnants of a generator which was the very first to provide electrical power in the village.\n\nGeorge, a kind hearted person and gentleman will be sadly missed in San Pedro and by all of those whose lives he touched. Ambergris Today extends sincere condolences to the Parham family. May his soul Rest In Peace."
