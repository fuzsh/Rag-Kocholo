He serves as the director of player personnel and defensive linemen coach.\n\nParham spent 12 seasons at Morgan State as the assistant head coach and run-defensive coordinator. During his time, he put together an attacking run-defense that became recognized as one of the most formidable in the league. In 2011, the Bears recorded 26 sacks totaling a loss of 200 yards. In addition, MSU ranked sixth in the MEAC as one of the stiffest teams to score against in the Red Zone.\n\nIn 2010, the Bears ranked among the league leaders in interceptions (14; No. 3 in the MEAC), opponent 3rd down conversions (No. 2; 30.4%); turnover margin (27; T-No. 4) and accumulated 19 sacks for the season.\n\nThe Bears defense finished the 2009 season ranked in the top 5 in scoring defense (21.2/g), pass efficiency defense (115.3) and sacks (21). MSU was also the second-best red-zone defense in the league. Parhams’ defense produced four All-Conference players, led by MEAC Defensive Player of the Year George Howard (LB). Howard and Justin Lawrence (DL) were also SBN Black College All-American selections.\n\nAs defensive line coach in 2008, MSU’s D-line combined for 41 tackles for loss and recorded 12.5 of the team’s 32 sacks. The Bears led the nation in total defense, giving up an average of just 212 yards per game, and no team gained more than 350 yards of offense against the Bears in the last two seasons. Morgan State concluded the season ranked 2nd in the nation in pass defense and 13th in rush defense.\n\nIn 2007, MSU’s defensive line combined for 43.5 tackles for loss and recorded 22.5 of the team’s league-best 36 sacks. The Bears finished as the league’s No. 1 total defense (267.0/g; ranked No. 2 in the FCS) and also completed the season ranked No. 1 in the MEAC against the run (130.9). Defensive end Justin “J.R.” Lawrence earned All-MEAC First Team honors after collecting 47 tackles and a league-best 17 tackles for loss to help the Bears become the Football Championship Series’ No. 1 ranked total defense.\n\nIn addition the success of the defensive line unit, defensive end/linebacker Bryan Wilson earned first-team All-MEAC honors and was selected as a free agent by the Washington Redskins.\n\nUnder Parham’s watch in 2006, MSU’s D-line ranked 3rd in the MEAC with 30 sacks, while the defense led the conference in rushing defense by surrendering just 117 yards per contest. The Bears defense also recorded its first shutout victory against North Carolina A&T since 1974.\n\nPrior to joining the Bears, Parham helped build Hampton’s football program where he spent 10 years as the defensive line coach for the Pirates. Parham is a native of Dinwiddie, VA. He was an All-Conference CIAA defensive lineman and obtained his B.A. in Sociology and Criminal Justice at Virginia Union University. Following his graduation, Parham proceeded to coach the defensive line for his alma mater.\n\nA year later, Parham relocated to Hampton University, where he earned his master’s degree in Agency Counseling, in addition to coaching the Pirate’s defensive line. Throughout his coaching career Parham’s defensive line unit had an all-conference player for ten (10) seasons at Hampton and eight of the past nine years at Morgan State. His players have also gone to “the next level”. He has coached three (3) NFL draft picks and eleven (11) free agents.\n\nProfessionally, Herbert is a 22-year member of the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) and annually attends the AFCA Professional Series. He has also spoken at countless football clinics as well as organizing and directing the annual “Joe Taylor Football Camp” and “Don Hill Football Camp”.\n\nHerbert and his wife MiVida, have a son, Herbert II, and they reside in Abingdon, Md."
