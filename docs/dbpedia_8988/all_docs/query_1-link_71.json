        "text": "Hello, friends! üëã Today, I'm thrilled to share my experience working with an exceptional leader, Alex Primachenko. üåü If your company is in search of a Director of Testing or a Testing Team Leader, I highly recommend Alex for several key reasons. üöÄ Having worked closely with Alex in a previous company, I offer a unique HR perspective on his leadership qualities. üë• One standout trait of Alex is his extraordinary ability to balance deep professional expertise in testing with a keen understanding of the broader organizational goals, tasks, and missions. üéØ Alex has always adeptly navigated these areas, providing coaching and support to his team while demonstrating strong hands-on expertise. üíº Furthermore, Alex is a seasoned manager, well-versed in all aspects of organizational processes and actively engaged in them. üìà From an HR standpoint, Alex‚Äôs approach to recruitment is notably strategic. He's demanding, but this has consistently resulted in a testing team composed of top-tier professionals, regardless of the varying experience levels of its members. üí™ Impressively, Alex can bring on a specialist with just a year's experience and develop them into a more productive and effective professional than those with three to five years of experience elsewhere. üìö Another noteworthy aspect of Alex's contributions is his active participation in internal hackathons, where he brought forward new and innovative ideas, further showcasing his ability to drive creativity and forward-thinking within the team. üß†üí° I also want to highlight Alex's positive impact on team morale. üåà According to satisfaction surveys, his teams are among the most content within the organization. He has a talent for addressing internal team issues in a way that not only resolves them but also ensures ongoing loyalty to the company. üëè At Viber Alex spearheaded initiatives like knowledge exchange within the testing team, demonstrating his proactive and innovative leadership style. I can confidently say that Alex is an initiative-driven, proactive, and highly experienced manager. Your company would be incredibly fortunate to have him on board. üöÄ #Leadership #Management #QADirector #QALead #TestingExpertise #ProactiveLeadership #InspiringLeadership #SuccessStories\n\nI am happy to recommend Thembani Ndzewu CA(SA) for Audit leadership positions and Financial Reporting and Finance Leadership Positions, including roles like CFO, Audit Manager, Head of Procurement, Finance Manager, Finance Director, among others. I had the privilege of working alongside Thembani and his intelligence, adaptability, and humility truly set him apart. One remarkable aspect of about him is that he didn't feel the need to proclaim his status as a Chartered Accountant in our first conversation. In many instances, Chartered Accountants make it a point to lead with their professional credentials, but with Mr Thembani Ndzewu CA(SA) I noticed by his work ethic and knowledge that he probably completed his SAICA articles (signed off) but didn‚Äôt ask if he has passed his board exams because overtime I have learned not to ask that question. Its emotional to some. He let his work ethic and intelligence to do the talking. It took me some time to discover that he is a Chartered Accountant, a fact that he didn't consider necessary to mention right away. In an industry where introductions often include professional titles, Thembani Ndzewu CA(SA) stands out for prioritizing substance over formality. He lets his accomplishments speak for themselves and takes pride in his work, demonstrating that true excellence goes beyond certifications. This approach reflects not only his humility but also a genuine passion for making meaningful contributions. I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Thembani Ndzewu CA(SA) for any team or organization seeking a leader who not only possesses the technical expertise required for roles in Audit and Finance but also embodies humility, adaptability, and a dedication to letting results speak louder than words. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further insights into his outstanding capabilities. #Recommendation #FinanceLeader #AuditExcellence"
