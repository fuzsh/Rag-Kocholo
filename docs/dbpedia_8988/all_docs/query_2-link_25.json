But it's the family feel that makes this a truly special place.\n\nOur hospital earned a 5-star rating for bariatric, or weight loss, surgery from Healthgrades'. We support patients who are struggling with obesity despite attempts to lose weight, first by offering education about the differences between our surgical procedures. Patients also receive an evaluation of their health and, if they undergo surgery, follow-up sessions to encourage healthy lifestyle changes to keep the weight off.\n\nEmotional wellness is an essential part of your overall health, so we offer extensive programs in our Center for Emotional Growth. Using evidence-based behavioral practices to engage patients in treatment and to foster health and recovery from conditions like depression and substance abuse. To make mental healthcare more accessible, we provide multiple options, including inpatient and partial hospitalization programs.\n\nIf you've suffered a brain injury or a neurological illness, you will likely need extra help to regain independence and mobility. Our specialists work with patients who have had stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurological illness, with the goal of reteaching daily life activities including those needed to communicate with others, eat and swallow safely and control bodily functions."
