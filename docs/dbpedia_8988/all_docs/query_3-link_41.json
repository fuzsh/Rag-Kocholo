He is a twelve-year-old, blue male cat that goes to Elmore Junior High, with his adopted brother Darwin and his four-year-old sister Anais. Gumball is in Miss Simian's class. As of \"The Shell,\" Gumball is dating Penny.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWho is Gumball Watterson?\n\nGumball Watterson (formerly Zach Tristopher Watterson) is the twelve-year-old, light blue male cat protagonist of The Amazing World of Gumball. He is part of a family of anthropomorphic animals consisting of two rabbits, two cats, and a goldfish. He is known for causing mischief across the town due to not staying inside of the box.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is the age of Gumball Watterson?\n\nGumball Watterson is 12 years old.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat kind of cat is Gumball?\n\nIt is unknown what breed of cat Gumball is. His appearance is that of a light blue male cat with six whiskers on his oversized head, though only five are visible due to him being 2-D. He wears a tan sweater with brown cuffs.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nWhat is Gumball's full name?\n\nGumball's full name is Gumball Tristopher Watterson. In \"The Name\", his name was revealed to be Zachary Tristopher Watterson, but he legally changed it to Gumball at the end of the episode.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nAppearance\n\nEarly concept\n\nOriginally, Gumball was meant to be a blue dog. Not much thought was put into this choice as it was more of a placeholder than a final design. As the creators developed the character further, they decided to make him a black cat, as it fit the personality they had in mind for him: unlucky, but optimistic (black cats symbolize bad luck in European culture). The creators found this trait to be too restricting in terms of possible plots and stories. In addition, a silhouette cat would be \"hard to read\" on the backgrounds planned for the show.\n\nThe decision was finally reached to have him blue, a decision that the show creator Ben Bocquelet liked, because he thought blue was not a color usually found on cats, and it had a \"70's-80's Japanese mascot\" sort of feel.\n\nFinal design\n\nIn the actual show, Gumball is a light blue cat. On his oversized head, he has six whiskers, but only five are visible most of the time. He usually wears grey trousers, coupled with a tan sweater, which has brown cuffs and a brown collar. Like his mother, father, and sister, Gumball lacks shoes, and he is the only member of the Wattersons without visible eyelashes, although, in some episodes, he is seen with visible eyelashes, like in \"The Refund\" and \"The Boss.\" One of his sharp canine teeth can also be seen hanging out of the corner of his mouth. The inside of his mouth is pink, his tongue is light pink, and his nose is orange.\n\nIn season 2, his design changes slightly. His head and his whiskers are bigger, while his eyes are rounder. His canine teeth are rounder and no longer present when his mouth is closed. The corner of his snout can sometimes be seen bending down at a sharp angle.\n\nIn season 3, Gumball's eyes are permanently round along with the rest of the Wattersons'.\n\nPersonality\n\nGumball is a very imaginative person. Despite his mediocre academic performance, he can be surprisingly brilliant when it comes to formulating all sorts of mischievous schemes. This side of him can be seen in episodes such as \"The Plan,\" in which he quickly formulates a basic outline to he and his siblings plan to \"save\" their mother, and in \"The Scam,\" in which he forms a crafty scheme that will allow him to cleanly heist the town's candy effortlessly. Such a side may also suggest Gumball is smarter than he lets on, as hinted by his expansive vocabulary, cooking skills, and ukulele skills as well.\n\nGumball is also pretty optimistic. Despite his cynicism towards society itself, as seen in episodes such as \"The Bumpkin\" and \"The Money,\" he is still fairly positive in what to expect out of people (though there are exceptions). When his family is financially suffering in \"The Money,\" he reminds them of the joys of family and pushes them to be more optimistic. In \"The Others,\" he is quick to reject Clare's notion of \"no happy ending,\" only wanting to see her have a happy ending (no matter how forced it was). He is also happy to help others, as seen in \"The Void,\" \"The Upgrade,\" and \"The Slide,\" in which in all three he went great lengths to assist Molly, Bobert, and Rocky, respectively.\n\nIn general, Gumball is very protective of his loved ones. On multiple occasions, he is quick to go into a sort of \"over-protective\" mode whenever anybody tries to hurt his siblings, Darwin and Anais, as seen in \"The Parasite,\" in which he tried to nearly poison Jodie when he thought she was hurting Anais, or in \"The Rerun,\" in which he aimlessly tried to attack Rob out of rage when Darwin died.\n\nGumball has a very sarcastic nature. He is quick to diffuse all sorts of quips towards others, ranging from fairly harmless to sometimes blunt and rude. As demonstrated in episodes such as \"The Stories\" and \"The Test,\" these snarky comments are impulsive.\n\nGumball also has a fairly massive ego, which seems to be a fault of his. When not tamed properly, his ego can drive him to do some pretty jerky things. Darwin tapping into his musical talents in \"The Triangle\" causes Gumball to have short-lived jealousy towards him before he realizes he is wrong. His ego also explains his relationship with Alan; the fact that Alan is so effortlessly loved drives Gumball to expose him for being scummier than he lets on (which later turns out to be accurate). This ego also makes him very sensitive, as seen in \"The Meddler,\" in which he becomes an emotional wreck when he is told his cheerleading performance was terrible.\n\nRelationships\n\nMain article: Gumball Watterson/Relationships\n\nGallery\n\nClick here to view the gallery.\n\nVoice actors\n\nLogan Grove (US/UK/AU/CAN) (season 1–2, most of \"The Kids\")\n\nJacob Hopkins (US/UK/AU/CAN) (the end of \"The Kids,\" the rest of season 3–\"The Copycats\")\n\nNicolas Cantu (US/UK/AU/CAN) (\"The Copycats\"–\"The Inquisition\")\n\nDuke Cutler (\"Gumball Chronicles: The Curse of Elmore\"–present)\n\nNicky Jones (the early reel only)\n\nJunko Takeuchi (Japan)\n\nArthur Dubois (France, seasons 1–4)\n\nSophie Pyronnet (France, season 5–present)\n\nFederico Bebi (voice, seasons 1-2, most of season 3) and Leonardo Caneva (sing) (Italy)\n\nAlessio Puccio (Italy, season 3-present)\n\nPaolo Filio (season 1, only five episodes) / Isabel Martiñón (present) (Latin America)\n\nMario García (season 1) (Spain)\n\nPilar Martín (season 2) (Spain)\n\nRebekka Weissfeld (Denmark)\n\nOmar Hakeem (Middle East, seasons 1 and 2 until \"The Lesson\")\n\nHadi Baydhoun (Middle East, season 2, \"The Game\"–\"The Finale\")\n\nHassan Mahdi (Middle East, seasons 1–2, most of \"The Kids\")\n\nFares Smerat (Middle East, the end of \"The Kids\" and the rest of season 3–present)\n\nEduardo Drummond (Brazil, season 1 and 2)\n\nJoão Victor Granja (Brazil, season 3)\n\nChristian Nieuwenhuizen (Netherlands)\n\nMiłosz Konkel (Poland, season 1)\n\nJakub Zdrójkowski (Poland, seasons 2 and 3)\n\nHubert Szczurek (Poland, seasons 4 and 5)\n\nFilip Rogowski (Poland, seasons 5 - present)\n\nElif Erdal (Turkey)\n\nValgeir Hrafn Skagfjörð (Iceland)\n\nLev Akselrod (Ukraine)\n\nЛев Аксельрод (Russia)\n\nQuotes\n\nMain article: Gumball Watterson/Quotes\n\nTrivia\n\nHe can play the ukulele and sing well, as seen in \"The Knights.\" Despite this, he is shown to be failing music class in \"The Apology.\"\n\nHe apparently had his appendix removed and also kissed Sussie, as said by Darwin in \"The Skull.\"\n\nGumball was voiced by Nicky Jones (best known for voicing the title character of Chowder) in the early reel, but Logan Grove started voicing Gumball for seasons 1 and 2. He voiced Gumball for the final time in season 3's \"The Kids.\" Jacob Hopkins then took his place for the rest of season 3, 4, and part of 5. Nicolas Cantu then replaced Hopkins in the season 5 episode \"The Copycats.\"\n\nIn Project Exonaut, Gumball is available as an exosuit for 1,000 coins.\n\nIn FusionFall, Gumball is available as a Nano.\n\nGumball's sweater was revealed to have been found by his dad in a sewage outlet in \"The Date.\"\n\nGumball is terrible at catching things, as shown in \"The Quest.\"\n\nGumball has been shown to be a horrible liar on numerous occasions.\n\nAlthough Gumball has six whiskers, only five of them are visible because of the angle of his head. In \"The Poltergeist,\" when Gumball impersonates a pea on a fork in the attic, one can see that he has six whiskers.\n\nIn \"The Pressure,\" when Gumball squishes between Masami and Darwin at the girls' lunch table, his six whiskers can be seen.\n\nIn \"The Bros,\" when Penny says she needs space, Gumball is so shocked that all his whiskers pop out, similar to Richard's whiskers.\n\nHe has very wide hips, which is unusual because this feature is more commonly seen on female characters in animation.\n\nIn season 1, he has a slightly wobbly outline in certain scenes.\n\nIn \"The Club,\" Nicole reveals that she and Richard agreed to give Gumball the middle name \"Christopher,\" but Richard confused it for \"Tristopher\" on Gumball's birth certificate. His middle name was also confirmed as \"Tristopher\" on James Lamont's Formspring.\n\nGumball has arachnophobia, which is a strong fear of spiders, as shown in \"The Date.\"\n\nGumball may have a fear of drowning, or perhaps, claustrophobia, as reflected in a dream where he hyperventilates and panics in a sinking car in \"The Dream.\"\n\nGumball's face is shown to be extremely malleable, as in \"The Photo\"; Darwin was able to mold it into various poses, and it has been shown to go very floppy on occasions.\n\nIn \"The Treasure,\" it is revealed that Gumball was a really ugly baby, though this may have been contradicted in \"The Choices.\"\n\nGumball is shown to be good at whistling, demonstrating his skill in \"The Colossus\" and \"The Fridge.\"\n\nThe first time Jacob Hopkins could be heard voicing Gumball was in the \"Welcome to Elmore\" promo.\n\nIn \"The Promise,\" it is revealed that the name \"Gumball\" is just a nickname.\n\nIn \"The Name,\" his real name is revealed to be \"Zach.\" At the end of the episode, he legally changes his name to Gumball.\n\nGumball has been heavily implied on various occasions throughout the series, as well as confirmed by Ben Bocquelet on Twitter, to be bisexual or pansexual.[1] This has yet to be explicitly confirmed in the series itself however.\n\nGumball has appeared in every episode except for \"The Singing,\" \"The Sucker,\" and \"The Spinoffs.\"\n\nReferences\n\nv • e Characters Italicized characters are considered extremely minor Watterson family Gumball • Darwin • Anais • Nicole • Richard • Granny Jojo • Louie • Evil Turtle (family pet) • Frankie Robinson family Gaylord • Margaret • Rocky Fitzgerald family Penny • Patrick • Judith • Polly • Mr. Cuddles (family pet) Wilson family Tobias • Jackie • Harold • Rachel Banana family Banana Joe • Banana Barbara • Banana Bob Rex family Tina • Mr. Rex Keane family Alan • Dexter • Jessica Jötunheim family Hector • Mrs. Jötunheim Parham family Felicity • Billy Yoshida family Masami • Mr. Yoshida • Yuki School faculty Nigel Brown • Lucy Simian • Steve Small • Coach Russo • Joan Markham • Librarian • Moonchild Corneille • Tree librarian Student body Carrie • Bobert • Sarah • Leslie • Teri • Colin and Felix • Carmen • Molly • Jamie • Idaho • Anton • Ocho • Juke • Sussie • Clayton • William • Rob • Hot Dog Guy • Julius • Green bear • Mushroom • Fuzzball • Razor • 8-bit dog • Reaper • Mowdown • Rotten cupcake • Scythe • Clare • Jared • Wilson • Jodie • Rainbow octopus • Bulldog • Gregory • Mole • Josh • Peter Senior citizens Marvin • Gary • Alison • Blue elephant • Betty • Donald Other Elmore residents Larry • Donut Cop • Sal Left Thumb • Martha • Kenneth • Karen • Pantsbully • Tony • Hexagon lady • Santa Claus • Paperball • Lenny • Construction men • Hobo • Shooting star • Rosie • Clipboard men • Egg man • Cube dogs • Cyclops dog • Rats • Sun • Earth • Moon • Purple squirrel • Pink squirrel • Creatures • Orange guards • Bandage doctor • Melted cheese guy • Hamburger Cop • Cowboy • Jeff • Susan • Siciliana • Quattro • Hayden • Internet • Exercise bacon • Shape people • Teal tow truck driver • Saturn • Sausage dog • Tan dog • Carlton • Troy • Green security guard • Bandage paramedics • Ghosts • Coffee cop • Mr. Verde • Idaho's family • French fries • Anton's parents • Richwood High students • Gumball's brain • Dr. Butt • Sussie's parents • Ripley 2000 manager • \"Porky\" Cassidy • Office Goblin • Goblin • Dolphin man • Spray-paint bottle • Butterknife • Mr. Chanax • Manly warrior • Pest controller • Soulless office worker • Oval family • Timmy • Charlie • Drum kit guy • Hot Dog Guy lookalike • Cupcake man • Mike • Ken • Kip Schlezinger • Clown • Hand security officer • Sally the Snake • Earl • Sphere citizens • Leonard Daniels • Van shopkeeper • Human • Milk guy • Old doctor • Gargaroth • Brydie • Mayor of Elmore • Flight attendant • Daniel • Mary • Maria • Joao • Phil • Kayvon • Charlie-Ann • Book doctor • Teapot • Debbie Single appearance Jealousy • Blitzer • Virus • Frank Kreese • Daniel Lennard • Ant-One • Ant-Two • Anton clones • Zach • Scary old man • Scary old lady • Chicken Bucket • Chris Morris • Vlad • Sluzzle Dude • Butterfly • Chimera • New Bobert • Abraham Lincoln goat • Evil Turtle's babies • Chi Chi • Ribbit • Chi Chi's parents • Troll • Game Child • Howdy • Frank • Grady • Russian agents • Ethel and Bernie • Mr. Gruber • Azrael • Rainbow Factory shareholders • Fuzzy Objects Daisy the Donkey • Elmore dollar • Solar System"
