        "text": "Sometimes when it comes to our Unsung Heroes, I have to take a second to remind you of who they are and where you've seen them.\n\nBut with this month's nominee... I really don't think it's necessary, because Robin Balke is this month's nominee. I mean, Robin is one of the busiest women in Pettis County, you guys. You go to a community event, or a fundraiser, or a trivia night, BAM. There's Robin, either supporting the event by attending, helping out with volunteering, or she helped organize the whole dang thing.\n\nSeriously, let's just take a second. She serves on the boards for DeFeet.org, Sedalia Community Helping Hands, the Sedalia Police Department Personnel Board, Human Resource Management Association of West Central Missouri, Sedalia Business Women, Business Women of Missouri. She's on the Chamber of Commerce, in the Mental Health Coalition, The Pillars of Pettis County, the Pettis County NAACP, the Bothwell Wear Red Committee.... it might be quicker to tell you what Robin DOESN'T do. In fact, if you're planning a fundraiser or a charity event or something, it's probably in your best interest to try to have Robin either involved, or attending. It's almost like a good luck charm at this point.\n\nHer nominator is another guy you've probably heard of, Larry Parham. Here's what he had to say when he nominated Robin:\n\nRobin Balke is an Unsung Hero in the community due to her tireless efforts and active involvement. She balances her professional responsibility with an impressive array of community service. She also contributes to various events and initiatives, including those by Boys and Girls Clubs of West Central Missouri, United Way of Pettis County, and the Pettis County Community Partnership. Her commitment to mental health advocacy and willingness to lend a helping hand make her an invaluable asset to the community. Balke's dedication exemplifies the spirit of an Unsung Hero, quietly making a difference without seeking recognition.\n\nHe said it better than I could, definitely. Let's just get into it and hear from Robin herself. Here's an interview she did recently with Randy Kirby!\n\nYou can nominate your next Unsung Hero here.\n\nVoluntarily Yours,\n\nBehka"
