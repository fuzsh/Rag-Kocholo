In 2018, Louis served as the first deputy commissioner for the Westchester County Department of Correction (DOC) where he led the Westchester County DOC successfully out of Department of Justice Federal oversight. Louis was credited with implementing significant reforms to the Westchester County jail and successfully obtained compliance with U.S. Department of Justice federal oversight agreement, leading to the successful conclusion by remedying constitutional violations at the county jail. Since his return to his hometown of New York City, Louis has served as Commissioner of New York City Department of Correction and as Assistant Deputy Mayor for Public Safety; he is currently serving as the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services.\n\nHe began his career in law enforcement as a police officer in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and after his service in the NYPD, Louis successfully went on to modernizing law enforcement systems through robust programming and community engagement, building staff capacity, and making strategic investments that improved conditions for staff, the community, and vulnerable and justice-involved persons. He has also built strong partnerships with faith-based and community leaders, and nonprofit organizations working with justice-involved individuals.\n\nLouis thoroughly believes that in order to improve the criminal justice system, enhance the impact of social services and overall government operations, these systems need strategic disruption in how they are managed in order to address today’s challenges.\n\nLouis Molina is a decorated veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from Chaminade University, a Master of Public Administration from Marist College School of Management, a Master of Arts degree in Human Rights Studies from Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and studied abroad at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

He is an active member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, American Society of Evidence Based Policing, New York State Sheriffs’ Association, and American Correctional Association.\n\nJustin Insalaco’s career spans over two decades, marked by a profound commitment to transforming local and state government operations, focusing on community engagement strategies and evidence-based policing.\n\nBeginning his journey as a Police Officer in New Jersey at the young age of 19 in 2009, Justin quickly developed a passion for fostering community relations. His dedication and innovative approach led him to spearhead major community policing initiatives, notably achieving the #1 ranking nationally for the National Night Out event.\n\nRecognizing a significant technological shortfall in his agency just a year into his career, Justin embarked on a mission to bridge this gap. His efforts culminated in the creation of Guidant Systems on his own time. This venture revolutionized police work by introducing a mobile software suite, enabling officers to access and share critical information from any location seamlessly.\n\nBeyond his police work, Justin has contributed significantly to various organizations. He served on the Board of WomenVotes, Inc., playing a pivotal role in developing a ride-sharing application for the 2016 election to facilitate voter turnout.

John’s preventive approach to promoting this culture of wellness led to his development of the Cordico Law Enforcement Wellness App (Lexipol) that was highlighted at the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) national town-hall summit, and is now recognized as the industry leader in wellness worldwide.\n\nUnder Carli’s leadership, the Vacaville Police Department (California) was recognized as the 2020 top agency in the nation by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Foundation, receiving the “Destination Zero” Officer Safety and Wellness award.\n\nChief Carli continues to serve as an Executive Fellow with the National Policing Institute in Washington D.C., focusing on the continuous improvement within the policing profession.
