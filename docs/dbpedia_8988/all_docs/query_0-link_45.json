        "text": "Autumn Greetings from Senator Bradford\n\nAssemblymember Autumn Burke, Senator Holly Mitchell, President pro Tem Tony Atkins, Congresswoman Maxine Waters,\n\nCSUDH President Thomas Parham, and Congresswoman Karen Bass\n\nDear Friends,\n\nAs the trees begin to change color and their leaves fall, I hope you are entering autumn on a positive note and preparing for the end of another great year. With the conclusion of the 2017-18 legislative session, I have been throughout the district participating on panels, attending conferences, speaking with constituents, and sharing the work we have accomplished in my first two years in the State Senate. I love being able to spend more time throughout the week in our community, but it will be short-lived as the holidays will be here before we know it, and the next legislative session convenes. For the time being, I hope to hear more about the issues that matter most to you. In this newsletter I will provide you with a summary of recent events I attended and provide you with a recap of the bills I authored which will go into effect January 2019.\n\nAs always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my District or Capitol offices if you need assistance, have ideas about potential legislation, or want information on community or capitol events.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nSteven Bradford\n\nSenator, District 35\n\n2nd Annual Men's Empowerment Summit\n\nOn Saturday, September 8th, I co-hosted the 2nd Annual Men's Empowerment Summit with 102.3 KJLH at the home of my alma mater, CSU Dominguez Hills. There we provided a platform for men to engage in honest discussions to combat the most pressing challenges facing us today. This year's event began with an inspirational opening speech from American civil rights attorney, Benjamin Crump. Mr. Crump is best known for his strategic defense of African Americans, such as Trayvon Martin in Florida and Michael Brown in Missouri. Throughout the rest of the day there were a variety of seminars and panel discussions focusing on public safety, mental health, father's rights, entrepreneurship, and civic engagement. Those who attended had access to free health screenings and young attendees were given opportunities to meet with valuable mentors. All in all, the event was another roaring success.\n\n16th Annual Gardena Jazz Festival\n\nFor nearly two decades the Gardena Jazz Festival has been an iconic event in Los Angeles County. The festival brings world-class talent, community members and leaders to my hometown of Gardena each year for an amazing day filled with unity, entertainment, celebration and fellowship. As the festival's founder, I am proud to see that tradition continue. There were over 10,000 attendees and tickets were sold out three weeks before the event date! Set at gorgeous Rowley Park, this year's lineup included performances from Maze, featuring Frankie Beverly, Euge Groove, Naturally Seven, Alex Bugnon, Donald Hayes and the Fernando Pullum Youth Jazz Orchestra on the main stage, and DW3, J Boykins among others on the second stage. Even with the temperatures in the mid ninety's, the music was too good to remain seated.\n\nDrew Child Development Corporation Fair\n\nIn August, I attended and provided opening remarks at the Drew Child Development Corporation's annual \"Back 2 School Health and Resource Fair.\" This was Drew CDC's second year hosting the event, which serves more than 300 families from the Watts-Willowbrook, Compton and South Los Angeles area. I had the honor of handing out brand-new backpacks and meeting some of our region's most promising youth.\n\nHawthorne High School Campus Modernization\n\nOn September 11th, I presented Hawthorne High School with a certificate celebrating their investment and contribution to education for the groundbreaking of their future Wood Technology Lab. Hawthorne High School is entering the second phase of its campus modernization where 100 new classrooms will be built, including the Wood Technology Lab, which will improve students' access to hands-on learning and career building experience. We all know that the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields are critically important for our students' success in the 21st century workforce, but the problem is most schools are not updated and equipped to properly prepare them. Congratulations to Hawthorne High School for investing in our youth. I cannot wait to see the students learning in the brand new facilities.\n\n39th Annual Labor Solidarity Parade and Picnic Rally\n\nLA Council Members Monica Rodriguez and Joe Buscaino, LA County Supervisor Hilda Solis\n\nOn Monday, September 3rd, I celebrated Labor Day by participating in the LA/Long Beach Harbor Labor Coalition's 39th Annual Labor Solidarity Parade and Picnic Rally. I served hot dog lunches to all the families that gathered at Banning Park in Wilmington to celebrate the American labor movement. This year's theme was \"Rise Up and Resist.\" The fight to maintain and improve workers' rights is never finished and we will not only continue that important work, we will do it smiling.\n\nCalifornia Alliance for Retired Americans\n\nI had the privilege of speaking in front of the California Alliance for Retired Americans on Monday, September 17th. Aging affects all of us and we should be so lucky to live a long and active life. It is especially important to be politically involved right now and particularly, the senior vote is of paramount importance for the upcoming midterm election. No one deserves to be treated like a second class citizen and voting gives everyone the power to create a brighter future.\n\nUnited Cannabis Business Association Policy Summit\n\nAssemblymember Tom Lackey\n\nOn Thursday, September 20th, I was a panelist at the United Cannabis Business Association (UCBA) Policy Summit in Los Angeles. Much of our discussion was centered on my Senate Bill 1294, legislation I authored this year, which was signed by Governor Brown at the end of September. This bill, also known as the California Cannabis Equity Act of 2018, authorizes local jurisdictions who have established their own cannabis equity program to apply to the Bureau of Cannabis Control for funding. This funding will assist individuals who have been disproportionately impacted by cannabis prohibition to obtain their local and state cannabis permits and licenses.\n\nOver and over, I heard frustration and confusion from many Californians who have had a difficult time obtaining a local and state permit or license. These challenges and barriers are only exacerbated for individuals with a criminal record or who lack of access to capital. I introduced this bill not only to further the work of Prop 64 - which California voters overwhelmingly approved - but more importantly, to help those most harmed by the war on drugs enter this legal and regulated marketplace.\n\nEquity programs are geared towards creating an inclusive and diverse cannabis industry and specifically support individuals and communities who are linked to populations negatively impacted by cannabis criminalization. $10 million in our state budget will be allocated to assist local cannabis equity applicants and licensees.\n\nHealth Net Community Connections Forum\n\nOn Friday, September 21st, I provided welcoming remarks to Health Net's Community Connections Forum. The forum was held in partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Los Angeles, Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, Charles R. Drew University, Black Women for Wellness, and Watts Health. An expert panel discussion was held to share best practices in order to prevent and address adverse childhood experiences.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, are stressful or traumatic events, including abuse and neglect that happen during childhood. Research has proven that ACEs are a primary contributor to an individual's future well-being and life outcomes. Specifically, ACEs negatively influence behavior, mental health, and academic success and can lead to depressive episodes, attempted suicide, or the development of substance abuse disorders. Improving children's lives is a no brainer that can end up saving them as adults. Openly discussing the devastating effects of personal hardships is the first step to preventing future occurrences of them.\n\nDalmatian Club of America\n\nFormer LA Councilman and Dalmatian Club President Rudy Svorinich,LA County Assessor Jeff Prang, County Supervisor Janice Hahn\n\nFriday, September 28th I attended the bi-monthly fish lunch hosted by the Dalmatian Club of America, San Pedro Chapter. This marks 57 years of fish lunches for people to gather and celebrate the Croatian community of San Pedro. San Pedro is home to many famous and influential Croatians. Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, for instance, was born in Compton and moved to San Pedro with his Croatian family where he remained for most of his childhood. In 1941, politician Vincent Thomas was elected as a California Assemblyman to represent the 68th District. He immigrated to San Pedro with his family at the age of ten. The Vincent Thomas Bridge was named in his honor in 1963.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nSenator Bradford presents: BANKING SUMMIT AND RESOURCE FAIR\n\nCompton College, Little Theatre\n\nSaturday, November 17, 2018 @8:30AM-12:30PM\n\nPlease join me as I host a Banking Summit and Resource fair with Compton Community College, Operation Hope, and leading industry experts for a discussion on financing tools for homebuyers and financing & certification tools for small businesses.\n\nMore information available soon!\n\nOPERATION GOBBLE: Turkey Giveaway with Senator Bradford and Assemblywoman Burke\n\nRowley Memorial Park\n\nMonday, November 19, 2018 @10:30AM-12:30PM\n\nCome by beautiful Rowley Memorial Park to receive a delicious turkey for Thanksgiving dinner from Senator Bradford and Assemblywoman Autumn Burke!\n\nMore details to follow!\n\nAward Announcements\n\nThe State of California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, Homeless Coordinating and Financing council recently announced that the City of Los Angeles has been awarded $85,013,607 and the City of Long Beach has been awarded $2,869,833 through the Homeless Emergency Aid Program (HEAP), which provides direct and immediate assistance for cities combatting our state's homeless crisis.\n\nCompton College, El Camino College, and Los Angeles Southwest College have all been awarded the prestigious Gold Strong Workforce Star for their outstanding workforce development programs. Compton College and Los Angeles Southwest's registered nursing programs were recognized, as well as El Camino College's radiologic technology program. Strong Workforce Stars is an annual commendation for California community college career education programs that began in 2017. The system's Chancellor's Office awards a Strong Workforce Star to California community college programs that achieve a rate of at least 90 percent of graduates working in jobs close to their fields of study, have 70 percent or more of the graduates earning a regional living wage, and/or more than half of graduates increase their earnings. Gold Star programs meet all three of these criteria. Meeting these goals are critical to reducing the workforce skills gap and ensuring access to economic opportunity for all Californians.\n\nFunding Opportunities\n\nInterested in getting a degree in a STEM field?\n\nThe window for high school students to apply for a college scholarship from the Edison Scholars Program opened October 1st and runs through December 12th. This program provides positive opportunities for students interested in pursuing a degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM). To apply and get additional eligibility information, visit: edisonscholars.com.\n\nScholarship recipients will be announced next spring. Others may also be eligible for summer internships at SCE after completing their second year of college. Since 2006, Edison International has awarded more than $8.7 million in scholarships to 610 students' higher education through the Edison Scholars Program.\n\nNew Star Family Justice Center\n\nSenator Bradford worked hard to successfully secure funding through the state's general fund, which will go directly back into communities in District 35. One particular budget request he advocated with his colleagues in the Assembly and Senate, was the allocation of $10 million in funding for Family Justice Centers across California. The application period for these grant funds are now available through the California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and are vital to keeping these centers open so they can provide the critical services necessary for those in need. The New Star Family Justice Center in Hawthorne is eligible to receive up to $742, 272.\n\nFamily Justice Centers (FJC) are comprehensive multi-agency centers that provide a \"one-stop shop\" of support services to victims of interpersonal violence, including sexual assault, intimate partner violence child abuse, elderly abuse, and human trafficking. Created in 2002, FJCs are a pivotal part of an important movement that is shifting toward more effective, collaborative models of service delivery for victims. These services help them obtain safety from their perpetrators, reduce trauma, and attain better outcomes in life.\n\nUPDATE: 2018 Legislation Recap\n\nThe deadline for Governor Brown to sign or veto all bills that were approved by the Legislature in 2018 was Sunday, September 30th. The governor's desk is clear and the session is officially over. In my summer newsletter I predicted our district's strong finish.
