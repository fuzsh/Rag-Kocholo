(WGXA) -- A Macon native is getting recognized for his military service.\n\nAirman Joseph Parham is serving theU.S. Navy at Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) in Pensacola.\n\n“The Navy is important to national defense because we are the largest maritime defense and the largest Navy in the world,” said Parham. “The Navy helps protect U.S. soil from war and helps protect our allied nations and economies.”\n\nParham joined the Navy a year ago and is serving alongside sailors and Marines at NATTC, training to become a naval aircrewman operator.\n\n“I was inspired to join the Navy because I wanted to give myself a promising career,” said Parham. “It is also a family tradition. I am a third-generation Navy sailor.”\n\nParham credits his hometown with teaching him values that are helping him succeed in the Navy.\n\n“Growing up, my father and my JROTC instructors told me, “if you’re going to do anything, do it right and to your fullest, maximum capacity,”’ said Parham. “These lessons learned have helped me succeed in my Navy career.”\n\nTheNaval Air Technical Training Center trains aviation operators who become part of the Navy fleet supporting combat.\n\n“One of the accomplishments I am proud of is completing Aircrew Candidate School and moving on my education pipeline,” said Parham."
