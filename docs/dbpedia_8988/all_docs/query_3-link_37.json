        "text": "BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) -Advocates with the Kentucky Reproductive Freedom Fund are on a tour across Kentucky, campaigning for abortion access rights to be reinstated and fueling their message with the insight of medical professionals and religious leaders.\n\nThe campaign’s mobile billboard stating, “Kentucky’s abortion ban is driving away doctors,” made a stop outside of the Warren County courthouse where the group’s panel delivered several speeches on the current state of abortion access in the state. As it stands, abortions are almost fully banned in the Commonwealth, with the only exceptions being in the case of saving the mother’s life.\n\nKYRFF founder Ona Marshall stressed that there are no exceptions to the abortion ban in the case of rape or incest. She also shared that despite abortion being allowed to save the mother’s life, that action is rarely taken, as Kentucky currently has the second-highest maternal mortality rate in the country.\n\nDr. Janet Wygal boasts a 43-year career as an OB-GYN in Kentucky. She remembers firsthand the reactions of her colleagues and patients when the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was made.\n\n“Devastation. Disbelief that something that had been present for 50 years could be overturned was just horrifying, and the implications and the fallout is just never-ending,” Dr. Wygal recalled.\n\nFuture medical professionals and lifelong Kentucky residents shared that the decision has made them consider practicing medicine elsewhere, where they can perform the full spectrum of healthcare needs for patients.\n\n“We really have to think about not just our four years of residency, but our whole career,” said Lilly Deljoo, a medical student at the University of Louisville. “Whatever the landscape of, you know, Kentucky, looks like ten years down the road, that I can offer my patients the care that I’m allowed to offer. And the truth is, we don’t know what abortion laws will look like at that time, so, for me, I feel like the way to protect myself and to protect all my future patients, I need to make sure that I’m getting the proper training, and I feel threatened that I can’t get that here.”\n\nRev. Diane Snowa, a retired pastor with the United Church of Christ, believes that any religious argument for abortion bans is unfounded.\n\n“Religion fails when it burdens persons with shame, denies them control of their bodies, or undermines their consciences. Using scripture, especially using Jesus to limit and ban abortion is a travesty. The ministry of Jesus attempted to free women from whatever oppression they were suffering,” Rev. Snowa shared.\n\nThe advocacy group will continue its work across Kentucky, targeting rural communities for education outreach and installing billboards where possible. They hope to pressure lawmakers to reinstate abortion access across the state."
