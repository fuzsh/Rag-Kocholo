        "text": "Chase Parham The 23-year old from Amory is not only majoring in journalism at Ole Miss - he will graduate in August, he has been an important part of the sports coverage with the student newspaper, The Daily Mississippian, the past two years.\n\nIn 2006-2007, Chase was the sports editor of The DM.\n\n\"My dream has always been to cover college athletics,\" said Parham, who will continue along that path as the newest member of The Ole Miss Spirit family. \"To work at The Spirit, which was established before I was born, is an excellent opportunity for me.\"\n\nParham managed the sports section for the DM, which has a 14,000 circulation at Ole Miss and in Oxford. Besides writing columns, features and game stories on Ole Miss sports, he directed and developed writers, edited material and laid out the pages for the sports section.\n\n\"We are very excited to have someone with Chase's experience in journalism, understanding of Ole Miss and youthful perspective join us,\" said Spirit Publisher Chuck Rounsaville. \"Chase is a talented writer.\n\n\"While considering expansion of our staff, it was important to us to find someone with the same passion for sports as we have. We wanted someone who understands Ole Miss, knows the potential and traditions of Ole Miss and lives and breaths Rebel sports just like the rest of us on the Spirit staff do. Chase fit that order and we are very happy to have him on board.\"\n\nParham will be a jack-of-all-trades with The Spirit until his role is defined more clearly. He will write game stories, do some photography work, write feature stories and be a contributing writer to The Ole Miss Spirit magazine. As his role evolves, he will also contribute commentary and opinion pieces.\n\n\"Chase will be a great asset in our pledge to give Rebel fans who subscribe to The Ole Miss Spirit more information,\" Rounsaville added.\n\nWelcome aboard, Chase."
