        "text": "The following is my personal view and does not represent the view of the Bahá’í community.\n\nEarly Childhood\n\nBorn in 1988 in the heart of Isfahan, Iran, my life commenced nearly a decade after the seismic shifts of the Islamic revolution. This revolution, leaving an indelible mark on history, had abruptly concluded over 2,500 years of monarchical rule in the land more widely recognized as Persia. My father, a dedicated accountant and financial director at a distributer of products from several US companies including Johnson and Johnson and Revlon, was swept up in the tumultuous tide of change that surged in the wake of the revolution. His adherence to the Baháʼí Faith–the largest religious minority in Iran–cost him his livelihood, as the new regime systematically persecuted its followers in a wave of intolerance that began at its inception. My father took up multiple jobs, such as plumbing, to provide for us. My mother handled home duties and raised me and my siblings. My teenage brother and sister helped both with my upbringing and in supporting the family.\n\nLife continued in this manner until I was about ten. My father had become an accountant for a private blanket manufacturer. Despite our modest means, we found happiness and contentment in what we had. Then, one day, the phone rang. A terrible car accident had left my father alive but in need of immediate surgery. We later discovered that he’d been at a construction-filled intersection when a car, filled with nine people and speeding down an unopened road, careened towards him. He waited, but the car lost control and struck him, causing his vehicle to flip multiple times.\n\nHe awoke in the back of a truck, en route to the hospital with the other driver, who seemed lifeless. The other driver didn’t survive, and my father was severely injured, needing several years for recovery. Despite the circumstances, the authorities blamed him for the accident–again probably because of our faith. The other family, feeling emboldened, harassed us for years. I still remember picking up the phone one day to receive a call filled with unending profanity directed at my father and family.\n\nFor years, my father’s injuries prevented him from working. We fell into poverty, subsisting on help from a few family friends, relatives, and my brother. Our meals became basic; rice, lentils, and potatoes were luxuries. Meat was a distant memory. I recall a time when, consumed by hunger, all my mother could offer was a bowl of sugar water with bread crumbs. However, things improved gradually when my father recovered enough to work again, providing the much-needed support for our family.\n\nEarly Education\n\nMy elementary years marked the onset of a lifelong learning journey, a period of intensive training steered by my mother. Her role was pivotal in nurturing my love for learning during those formative years of elementary and middle school. With her firm yet caring approach, she instilled in me traits of determination, resilience, and a ceaseless hunger for knowledge. Every day, we would spend hours reviewing my textbooks, her probing questions covering all conceivable aspects of the content. Our daily ritual of an hour-long dictation session not only bolstered my language skills but also enriched my vocabulary and refined my articulation.\n\nMath was another area where she showed remarkable dedication. She filled any available blank space in my notebooks with math problems for me to solve and even enrolled in math classes herself to supplement my school curriculum. The focus was balanced between language and math, which became a part of our daily routine.\n\nI distinctly remember nights when she would wake me up to revise concepts before an exam, ensuring I had every detail committed to memory. Interestingly, I never found these efforts burdensome; on the contrary, I cherished them. When she announced that I was on my own upon my transition to high school, I was initially disheartened. However, I realized that after eight consistent years of her tutelage, she had faith in my ability to thrive independently.\n\nThroughout my early education, despite being a diligent and dedicated student, I often faced hostility from the school administration and even some teachers due to my Baháʼí faith. In middle school, I vividly recall being forced to pair up other students’ smelly shoes during noon congregational prayer, or enduring severe beatings for choosing not to participate in the same prayer, despite having initially received permission from the principal to remain in the class. I remember one school administrator would sometimes even encourage troublemakers to chase me after school, leading to physical altercations that I would try to evade by running as fast as possible once the bell rang.\n\nIn high school, certain math and morality teachers dedicated class time to spreading falsehoods and baseless accusations against Baháʼís and their faith, neglecting their role as educators. Baháʼís were unfairly labeled as unclean according to Islamic clergy in Iran, resulting in the belief that physical contact required ritual purification. On the last day of high school, a classmate shared with me that he felt compelled to undergo purification (Ghusl) every day after returning home due to shaking hands with me and my two other Baháʼí friends. This is what it was like to be between two lines. Being subjected to such mistreatment and prejudice within the educational environment was deeply disturbing. However, I remained resilient, determined to rise above these circumstances and pursue my education with unwavering dedication.\n\nMy academic journey flourished throughout high school, propelling me towards a course in civil engineering at the Baháʼí Institute for Higher Education (BIHE) — an underground, covert university in Tehran established by the Baháʼí community of Iran for their own children. As an ardent lover of physics and a Baháʼí, my opportunities for higher education in Iran were limited, making the civil engineering program at BIHE my top choice. Despite the fierce competition — with only 15 slots available annually for hundreds of applicants nationwide — I remained undeterred.\n\nCollege Life in Iran\n\nIn a startling turn of events in 2006, Baháʼí students, myself included, were granted the right to attend public universities for the first time since the revolution. Embracing this newfound possibility, I earned admission to study atomic physics at Bu-Ali Sina University. Barely eighteen, I packed my belongings, bid farewell to my hometown, Isfahan, and relocated to Hamedan. There, I found solace in the company of my sister and her husband, staying in their spare room. An orientation day marked the beginning of this new chapter, where we formalized our enrollment by completing a series of forms. One form inquired about religion. As I recall, Baháʼís are prohibited from openly declaring their faith on government paperwork, as it’s construed as proselytizing. Rather, we are instructed to inscribe two straight parallel horizontal lines in the space provided. Without hesitation, I did just that, accepting my fate between two lines.\n\nDespite knowing my academic pursuit could be abruptly terminated at any time, I excelled in my coursework. Each day, a list of names was posted on a board in the main hall, summoning select students to various offices, including Herāsat (the office supervising morality and religious and political beliefs). My daily ritual upon arriving at the university was to check this board for my name. On the one-month mark of my university tenure, I approached the board, and there it was — my name, called to report to Herāsat.\n\nUpon arrival at Herāsat, I was led into a room for a rigorous two-hour interrogation. The session concluded surprisingly with the interviewer asking about my living situation with my sister and offering assistance, if needed. This unexpected turn left me somewhat puzzled, yet with an uneasy feeling about my future at the university. Maintaining my daily ritual, I continued to check the board for my name each day. Approximately a month and a half later, my name surfaced again, indicating another call to Herāsat. This time, I was confronted by the head of Herāsat and the head of the Science Department. The verbal expulsion from the university was declared without a written notice, presumably to avoid any trace of repression. The expulsion, however, was contingent upon my refusal to renounce my faith. They sought to confiscate my student ID card, a demand I initially resisted as I needed more time to process the unsettling development.\n\nI found myself at a loss, unsure of the next steps. Upon sharing this distressing news with a few friends and classmates, their indignation was immediate. The news rapidly circulated throughout the university, inciting protests in the science hall that very evening, while I was in my calculus professor’s office. As a Baháʼí, I adhere to principles of peaceful resolution and abstain from protest. Consequently, I departed the scene to avert potential conflicts and to protect my friends from any unintended repercussions. Subsequently, a friend of mine, a journalist and activist, sought to clarify the reasons for my expulsion with the head of Herāsat. He managed to record the official stating that my Baháʼí faith was the sole cause of my expulsion. Unfortunately, this act of defiance led to my friend’s suspension for two semesters.\n\nIn the wake of my expulsion, I continued residing with my sister and brother-in-law in Hamedan. I soon embarked on my studies in civil engineering at BIHE, all the while exploring lawful avenues to regain my university seat. Each potential route I pursued, however, was met with insurmountable obstructions from the authorities. Upon returning from a trip to Tehran for BIHE classes, I was confronted with the unsettling news of a raid on my sister’s home by officials. They had confiscated numerous books and computers, and my brother-in-law had been summoned for questioning. Following a thoughtful consultation with my family and trusted friends, I made the decision to return to Isfahan, my hometown. I aimed to avoid becoming the subject of unwanted interrogations and to spare my sister — then pregnant with my niece — from further distress following the incursion into her home.\n\nHaving started at a public university with abundant resources, transitioning to BIHE was a profound shock. My first semester at BIHE in the spring of 2007 was marked by classes held in an old high school building in Tehran. Unfortunately, the location was raided and shut down before the semester’s end. In light of safety concerns, the instruction period was shortened from four weeks to two within a 20-week semester, with classes being conducted in people’s homes and basements in Tehran once again.\n\nAt BIHE, much of the responsibility for learning fell upon the students themselves. We were required to study independently, upload assignments online, and sit for midterm and final exams in the homes of fellow Baháʼís residing in our respective hometowns. Day after day, for over 12 hours, I immersed myself in my textbooks, teaching myself subjects like calculus, physics, statics, dynamics, differential equations, structural analysis, steel, and concrete design and many more and completing my homework assignments.\n\nThe expectations at BIHE remained as rigorous as those found in the most esteemed public universities, if not higher. The example set by BIHE and its students truly epitomizes the essence of constructive resilience. The experience itself was extraordinarily challenging and difficult to convey adequately to the reader. However, the skills, capabilities, and qualities that it instilled within its students became invaluable treasures that will resonate throughout their lives.\n\nMigration to the US\n\nTowards the conclusion of my tenure at BIHE, I had the opportunity to teach a few classes while completing my own final semesters. During this time, I learned about certain universities in the United States, such as the University of Texas at Arlington, that acknowledged and accepted undergraduate degrees from BIHE. However, to the best of my knowledge, no previous BIHE student had ventured to directly pursue international student migration to the US on an F-1 visa. Intrigued by this possibility, I was driven to take on the challenge. Motivated by my aspirations, I decided to apply to UT Arlington and was elated to receive acceptance into their graduate program for structural engineering. However, as with any journey, there were several serious barriers that needed to be overcome. While many who were unfamiliar with me doubted the feasibility of the path I was forging, a select few who truly knew me believed in my capabilities and offered unwavering support.\n\nInitially, a major obstacle I faced was the lack of sufficient funds within my family to support my journey to the United States and sustain me financially throughout my graduate studies. Despite this challenge, my BIHE advisor, who played a crucial role as my mentor and role model, was genuinely excited about my prospects. He took it upon himself to assist me in exploring various funding options, even considering the possibility of personally sponsoring my education. Together, we embarked on the process of obtaining a bank statement to serve as evidence of financial support, an essential requirement for obtaining a visa.\n\nOne day, we visited his bank branch to request the required bank statement. Our plan was to return together to collect the statement and finalize the signing of sponsorship documents sent by UT Arlington. However, fate took an unexpected turn. A friend informed me that authorities had conducted a large-scale raid early that morning, targeting the homes of several instructors and administrators at BIHE, including my advisor. Distressingly, all those apprehended were subsequently sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Their alleged crime? Establishing an underground university that aimed to provide higher education opportunities to Baháʼí youth who were unjustly denied this fundamental human right within their own country.\n\nFollowing the raid in Tehran, I departed for my hometown of Isfahan. Once there, shortly after my arrival, I received a call on my cell phone. Curiously, the caller ID displayed “unknown”. As I had anticipated, it was a representative from the Information Ministry, also known as Ettelā’āt, summoning me urgently to their headquarters. Accompanied by my concerned brother and father, we ventured to Ettelā’āt. However, upon entering the building, my family was asked to depart. Soon thereafter, I was led into a room where two men commenced an interrogation that went on for approximately three hours. Initially, their tone was relatively respectful, but gradually, it transformed into something more menacing. Towards the conclusion of the interrogation, they resorted to issuing threats. One particularly distressing threat involved their purported knowledge of my aspirations and efforts to migrate to the United States. They claimed they would deploy all means at their disposal to dismantle my dreams, even going so far as to suggest they could intercept me before boarding an airplane. Ultimately, they released me. The encounter left me apprehensive about the potential ramifications of my pursuit. Nonetheless, despite the intimidation tactics employed, my determination remained resolute, refusing to waver in the face of adversity.\n\nAfter the distressing incident, I made a conscious decision to keep my plans a closely guarded secret. Aware that my cell phone was under surveillance, I refrained from using it for an extended period. The paramount challenge ahead was finding a sponsor, coupled with the fact that I did not possess a passport due to the mandatory two-year military service requirement. Without delving into intricate details, I devoted months of tireless effort and underwent an immensely stressful process to obtain an exemption from military service, eventually enabling me to apply for a passport.\n\nWith the assistance of one of my father’s affluent acquaintances, my father and brother managed to provide the necessary bank statement. Equipped with the essential documents, I embarked on a journey to Lebanon to attend my visa interview at the U.S. Embassy. I was promptly granted a two-year F-1 student visa following the interview.\n\nTaking a calculated risk, I chose to return to Iran briefly to pack my belongings and bid farewell to my loved ones. Only my brother, sister, father, and mother were privy to the magnitude of my endeavor; the rest of my family remained unaware. I made a bittersweet visit to my aunt and grandmother, unable to disclose my imminent departure. I embraced them tightly, their significance etched in my heart, fully aware that it might be the last time I would see them in this lifetime. The mix of emotions was overwhelming, yet I maintained my resolve, knowing that this sacrifice was necessary for the pursuit of my aspirations.\n\nThe long-awaited day had finally arrived. My departure date remained undisclosed to my sister, who still resided in Hamedan, as it was impossible to communicate such sensitive information over the phone. With just a few hours left before my flight, I made a call from a random public telephone station, attempting to convey the gravity of the situation in vague terms. She immediately understood what I meant, and said that she would be there.\n\nThe time came for us to gather at the airport. Emotions overwhelmed my heart, weighing it down with a profound heaviness. Tears streamed down my face as I bid farewell, kissing my father, mother, brother, sister, niece, and brother-in-law one last time. Each goodbye carried with it the weight of uncertainty, not knowing when our paths would cross again. I was only 23 years old, and the magnitude of the separation was undeniably challenging. As I made my way through security towards the departure gate, I stole a final glimpse of my beloved family. The image of their faces etched in my memory, I yearned for the day when we would reunite. The reality of leaving everything behind, embarking on a journey into the unknown, was extremely difficult. The weight of the moment was a testament to the depth of the sacrifice my family and I were making. Today, after nearly 12 years of separation, the means of reuniting with my family have not yet been made possible, but we remain hopeful."
