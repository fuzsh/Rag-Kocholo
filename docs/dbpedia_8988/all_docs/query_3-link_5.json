        "text": "Just because the shaggy-haired bluesman on the cover of his new full-length album bears little resemblance to the nattily bearded singer-songwriter on the front of his 2014 EP doesn't mean Levi Parham doesn't know who he is and what kind of music he wants to make.\n\n“Somebody was asking me the other day, ‘Well, can you figure out who you are?' And I was like, ‘I know exactly who I am.' I've got all these layers, but I've really enjoyed the transition over the last couple of years, just going from not really knowing what I was doing, trying to figure it all out, trying to get on the road and trying to book gigs, and now, looking back two years later, I've come a long way,” he said by phone this week from his hometown of McAlester.\n\n“As far as the look goes, it's just due to being on the road. I'm probably wearing myself a little thin; I think I've aged a little bit over the last two years,” he added with a laugh. “I haven't had a haircut in a while.”\n\nAfter traveling around the country with his soulful songs, the self-proclaimed “McAlester boy” is sticking close to home but staying busy this summer, with gigs scheduled around Oklahoma, including three release shows for his new LP, “These American Blues,” due out June 24.\n\nThe follow-up to his acclaimed EP “Avalon Drive,” the 13-track collection marks Parham's debut on Austin, Texas-based Music Road Records, the label Oklahoma-Texas singer-songwriter Jimmy LaFave co-founded in 2008 with Dallas businessman Kelcy Warren.\n\n“I wanted it to be good. I wanted to step up,” Parham said. “ ‘Avalon Drive' was only like 22 minutes long or something like this, so I was really happy to give more on this one. I wanted to give as much as I could. … It felt like a really full album, and it didn't feel like there was much filler there. Each song was very meticulously picked to be on this album. I'm a prolific writer. I write a lot, and so there were all kinds of tunes that poor Jimmy had to listen to, and it was very specific what we put on there.”\n\nWorking with a pioneer\n\nKnown as a pioneer of Oklahoma's red dirt music scene, LaFave told me last year he signed the McAlester songsmith to his label because he's “one of the best young new talents I've heard in Oklahoma in a long time.”\n\nParham, 32, said having a musician of LaFave's caliber see potential in him was a big boost.\n\n“It was a real sense of validation,” Parham said. “And I was really very grateful to get that from someone like Jimmy, who I've looked up to for a long time — and everybody else does, too. I mean, you don't do much in Oklahoma and Texas and elsewhere — really in the Americana world — without knowing who Jimmy LaFave is. So, that was a real sense of pride to get that pat on the back from him.”\n\nThe seasoned singer-songwriter's laid-back style as a producer also helped alleviate the half-sick nervousness Parham said he felt going into the studio for his new LP. LaFave encouraged him to trust his instincts.\n\n“From the get-go, he really trusted me, he trusted my songs, he knew we would come up with something great, and we didn't overthink it. He just let me be who I wanted to be, and where I needed guidance, he gave me guidance,” Parham said.\n\nWhile making “Avalon Drive,” the scribe said he was cruising on a mix of classic and modern pop/rock including Tom Petty and Boy & Bear. But he grew up listening to blues and soul legends such as Muddy Waters, Van Morrison and Sam Cooke with his dad, and those influences came through clearly on his new album.\n\n“With ‘These American Blues,' I had the songs a little more well-rehearsed. I'd been out playing these songs for two years out on the road, so I had that in my pocket. But I didn't quite know how the production was gonna go,” he said. “Really, it was a work of a lot of people just being on top of their game. John Ross Silva, the engineer, is just phenomenal to work with. He's a great dude; he's really easygoing. He kind of puts the pressure on when you need it, and then as far as the musicians involved, they were all just top-notch.”\n\nWorking in Cedar Creek Recording Studio in Austin, LaFave surrounded Parham with experienced musicians like drummer Michael Byars, bassist David Leach, pianist Radoslav Lorkovic and guitarists Tim Easton, Phil Hurley and Seth Lee Jones.\n\n“These guys that I had in the studio with me were just so great that it was just very easy, and everything came out very organically. If I started a song, we would literally run through it maybe one or two times and then we'd press record, and that's really what we got. There really are no other bells and whistles involved,” Parham said. “So, what came out of it is, I think, very much me. And I think that's why it became so bluesy … or has that kind of soul music feel, a lot of the gospel type of stuff with the background singers.\n\n“They had to calm me down on the background singers,” he added with a laugh. “I wanted them on everything.”\n\nStaying an Oklahoma artist\n\nThe singer penned all but one song on “These American Blues,” which includes a goose bump-inducing rendition of New Tulsa Sound musician Wink Burcham's “Chemical Train.” He learned the haunting tune filling in at Tulsa's Mercury Lounge while Burcham was on tour in Europe, and including a cover from a fellow Oklahoman is the kind of tradition a red dirt guy like LaFave could wholeheartedly support.\n\n“I love Oklahoma artists. I'm very, very proud of being an Oklahoma artist, and I'm proud of all my dudes out there doing their thing, girls out there doing their thing. You know, we're just representing, and it's a real sense of pride,” Parham said. “It's a community, and if one of us wins, we all win. … A lot of the Tulsa guys, they'll write songs with each other in mind. I've been trying to write a country tune for (Jacob) Tovar; I've not been very successful at it, but I've been trying.”\n\nParham has recruited several fellow Okies to play with him at his album release shows. Annie Oakley, John Calvin Abney and Andy Adams will join him at his acoustic concert Thursday at the Blue Door, while Desi and Cody, Abney and a slew of Tulsans will contribute to the party atmosphere June 24 at Tulsa's Fassler Hall. He also will play a full-band hometown show June 25 at The Okie (formerly Peckerheads) in McAlester.\n\n“I will probably forever be a McAlester boy,” he said. “I love it out here. My family's here, and I've got a little place out in the country. It's nice, being on the road all the time, coming home and kind of being in a place that feels familiar.”"
