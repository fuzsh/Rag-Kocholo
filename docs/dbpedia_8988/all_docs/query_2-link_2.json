        "text": "Town in Antigua, Antigua and Barbuda\n\nParham, officially known as the Town of Parham, is the capital of Saint Peter, the largest city in Saint Peter, and the fourteenth largest city in Antigua and Barbuda. Parham's population was 1,307 in 2011,[1] distributed over 1.99 square kilometres.[2] Parham is similar in population to Potters Village, the thirteenth most significant city in Antigua and Barbuda, and Bendals, the fifteenth largest city. Parham is situated on the shore of Parham Harbour,[3] one of the most important harbors in the country, enclosed by the Parham Peninsula and Long Island.\n\nParham comprises four main neighbourhoods: Lovers Lane, Parham Market, Byam Wharf, and the School neighborhood.[2] If the Saint Peter portion of All Saints, home to 1,954 people extending across three parishes, is considered a separate city, Parham would be regarded as the second largest city of Saint Peter.[4] The major division of Parham, the town's metropolitan area, stretching over the eastern portion of the parish, had a 2011 population of 3,499 people.[5]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town was given its name in 1675 when a British naval officer by the name of Lord Willoughby de Parham arrived from England with a patent from King Charles II, allowing him to designate Parham as one of the six trading towns in colonial Antigua while also establishing it as the capital of the colony.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nParham served as a significant trading port for the importing of slaves from West Africa and the sale of rum and sugar to England during the colonial era. The agricultural products of the St. Peter, St. Phillip, and St. George parishes were sold at Parham Harbour.[3] Around 1750, the Parham sugar mill was divided into two separate enterprises, each with its own windmill and boiling house.[6] As a result of the St. Peter's Anglican Parish Church's construction in 1840,[7] Parham would not have seen its heyday and peak population until the middle of the nineteenth century, during the height of the Industrial Revolution and the early days of freedom.\n\nThe Parham Anglican Primary School and the Parham Anglican Rectory were also built at that time. The Antigua Almanac, a newspaper from the 19th century, claimed that the people these initiatives drew would have turned the town of Parham into the island's capital once more.[3]\n\nWhen sugar prices collapsed in the early to mid-20th century, the most sugar planters departed the island, and the descendants of freed slaves from the nearby sugar plantations are likely to have moved into Parham. They maintained the town's existence as a flourishing commercial hub by engaging in trades, including fishing, farming, carpentry, and masonry.[3] Massive emigration caused by the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1960s and 1970s led to a population loss in Parham that has not been replaced or recovered from to this day. Agriculture and fishing continue to be the mainstays of the neighborhood economy.[3]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nParham is on the shore of Parham Harbour, a well-protected anchorage.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nParham is subdivided into six enumeration districts, Lovers Lane, Parham Market, Byams Wharf, Parham School #1, Parham School #2, and Parham School #3.[2] The centre of Parham is located in the Parham Market neighborhood, and is home to four of Parham's 39 business owners.[8][9]\n\n50700 Parham-LoversLane\n\n50800 Parham-Market\n\n50900 Parham-ByamsWharf\n\n51001 Parham-School_1\n\n51002 Parham-School_2\n\nCensus data (2011)[10]\n\n[edit]\n\nQ48 Ethnic Counts % African descendent 998 92.06% Caucasian/White 5 0.47% East Indian/India 3 0.28% Mixed (Black/White) 17 1.61% Mixed (Other) 44 4.06% Hispanic 6 0.57% Other 8 0.76% Don't know/Not stated 2 0.19% Total 1,084 100.00%\n\nQ49 Religion Counts % Adventist 192 18.17% Anglican 251 23.81% Baptist 32 3.01% Church of God 26 2.43% Evangelical 5 0.49% Jehovah Witness 4 0.39% Methodist 110 10.40% Moravian 19 1.85% Nazarene 13 1.26% None/no religion 76 7.19% Pentecostal 87 8.26% Rastafarian 16 1.55% Roman Catholic 38 3.60% Weslyan Holiness 153 14.48% Other 30 2.82% Don't know/Not stated 3 0.29% Total 1,055 100.00% NotApp : 30\n\nQ58.
