        "text": "A liberal minister\n\nHis was an active member of the Comité Libéral. He was considered as an extreme left-wing theologian and the religious community of which he was in charge almost grew into an independent church. His numerous writings on spirituality are those of an independent mystic, typical of liberal Protestantism. The illness and death of his son inspired his L’Âme des choses.\n\n(The soul of things) and L’Ami. La vie simple ( The Friend. The simple life), published in 1895 was a big success. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt invited him for a triumphant tour of the United States, and to the White House.\n\nWith the funds collected in France and the United States, Charles Wagner founded the parish of Le Foyer de l’Ame , rue Duval ( rue du Pasteur Wagner from 1924) in Paris. The church seats 1200, proof of his reputation as a preacher."
