        "text": "Welcome to the Hofstra Interfaith Center\n\nThe Hofstra University Interfaith Center offers support and inspiration to every student and member of the Pride family. The Center invites you to discover your spiritual center and connection with faith or secular meditation though the many activities and religious services on campus.\n\nThe chaplains at the Interfaith Center are available for religious guidance and informal counseling. As confidential parties on campus, they are an available resource to the Hofstra community. For more information about the Interfaith Center, visit the chaplains located in Room 213 of the Student Center or email deanofstudents@hofstra.edu.\n\nWhat is the Interfaith Center?\n\nThe Interfaith Center at Hofstra University consists of Jewish, Muslim, Protestant, and Roman Catholic chaplains and their ministries. They are professional religious leaders accountable to the University, to respective sponsoring religious organizations, and to the values of each faith tradition.\n\nThe chaplains serve students, faculty, staff, and administration of the University, and the Long Island community through special programs. Though each chaplaincy has a primary responsibility to the members of its own faith tradition, they also acknowledge a concern and responsibility for the whole University community."
