        "text": "Vienna 1900 - The Pernerstorfer Circle | Close Window |\n\nInfluences\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche | Arthur Schopenhauer | Richard Wagner\n\nRichard Wagner\n\nThe Pernerstorfer Circle provides a reminder of just how influential Richard Wagner was in his place and time, not just as a musician, but as a purveyor of ideas. As Wagner moved in the mid-1870s into an increasingly mystical-religious point of view, the Circle evidenced strong inclinations to regard him as a prophet of art, spiritualism, and Schopenhauer-inspired philosophy.\n\nVictor Adler and Siegfried Lipiner were among the Circle members who made pilgrimages to Beyreuth. Lipiner himself became a point of interest for Wagner via recommendation from Nietzsche, and Wagner apparently interviewed him as a possible writer to translate Wagner's ideas into popular form.\n\nAmong the Wagnerian ideas that influenced the circle were:\n\nThe need for a deeply spiritual root -- a \"true religion\" -- to undergird social regeneration.\n\nA call to recognize the unity of all that lives and to deny the will-to-live in itself.\n\nVegetarianism: the killing and eating of animals was self-destructive (because they share the same world-soul).\n\nSelf-consciousness was key to people acknowledging and acting in accordance with unity. Art could contribute powerfully to the development of this consciousness. The Poet-Priest would lead humanity to salvation.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche | Arthur Schopenhauer | Richard Wagner"
