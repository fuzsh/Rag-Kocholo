        "text": "As a Chaplain in the Army Reserve or Army National Guard, you’ll serve part time in support of your community, state, and country. You’ll be able to pursue a civilian ministry while you serve and train near home.\n\nAs an Army Chaplain, you won’t participate in the Basic Training that enlisted Soldiers complete. Instead, you’ll attend the Chaplain Basic Officer Leader Course (CHBOLC), a required training course that focuses on your professional, physical, academic, and spiritual growth as a military Chaplain.\n\nNo. Army Chaplains are not issued weapons and are not allowed to engage in combat. During times of combat, they are protected by Religious Affairs Specialists.\n\nThe Army Chaplaincy is a multi-faith program—ministers, priests, imams, rabbis, and more, make up the Chaplaincy. While each Army Chaplain is a clergy person in their specific denomination or faith group and won’t be asked to perform services or duties outside of their denomination, their role is to promote spirituality and faith as a whole, and serve all Soldiers, regardless of background and religion."
