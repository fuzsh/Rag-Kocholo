        "text": "University President\n\nFr. Malachi Van Tassell T.O.R., Ph.D\n\nAssumed the office of President at Saint Francis University on May 12, 2014, with his official inauguration taking place on October 4, 2014.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, the university undertook a major institutional restructuring. The ultimate goal of the re-structuring was to keep a Saint Francis University education affordable and accessible. Building on the solid foundation of Catholic and Franciscan identity, the university affirmed its vital academic programs in health sciences and business. In addition, the university made significant investments in STEAM programs, including engineering and the arts, and affirmed its commitment to intercollegiate athletics competition at the NCAA Division One level.\n\nIn 2019, the university launched Francis Worldwide School of Continuing Studies, a school dedicated to offering career-focused, flexible programs for students looking to continue their education. In his tenure, Saint Francis University has created several new academic programs. The School of Continuing Studies recently launched its first research-based doctorate program delivered in a hybrid format for working professionals across various disciplines. A commitment to a relevant, market-driven academic portfolio is a hallmark of Father’s leadership.\n\nSuccessful capital projects include the Shields School of Business, School of Health Sciences and Education experiential learning commons, and several athletics-related projects. In the summer of 2022, construction will commence for the Connors Family Fine Arts Center, future home of the Resinski Black Box Theater and a newly renovated building for the Occupational Therapy program. In addition, significant progress continues on the capital campaign for the School of Health Sciences and Education at Sullivan Hall and the Immaculate Conception Chapel.\n\nFather is a member of the NCAA Division One Presidential Forum, member and past Chair of the Northeast Conference Council of Presidents, and a member and past Chair of the Association of Franciscan Colleges and Universities. Previously, Father Malachi served as Minister Provincial of the Sacred Heart Province and Chairman of the Board of Franciscan University, where he led a successful presidential search.\n\nPrior to the Presidency, he spent twelve years at the university as an assistant professor of accounting (full-time and adjunct). He previously served as the treasurer and vicar provincial of the Franciscan Friars, Sacred Heart Province.\n\nFr. Malachi professed vows as a Franciscan in 1999 and was ordained to the priesthood in 2004. He has a Ph.D. in higher education leadership from Capella University, a master’s degree in taxation from Arizona State University, and an undergraduate degree in accounting and Spanish from Franciscan University. A certified public accountant, he worked for Coopers & Lybrand in Phoenix, Arizona, and Arthur Andersen in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as a tax accountant before becoming a Franciscan.\n\nEducation"
