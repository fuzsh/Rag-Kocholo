        "text": "All allegations of child sexual abuse are reported to law enforcement regardless of credibility, and victims are offered financial support for counseling assistance with a counselor of their own choosing. Allegations of child sexual abuse involving church personnel are also reported to the Archdiocese’s Independent Review Board. None of the individuals listed here is in Catholic ministry in the Archdiocese of Baltimore; many have died and some have been returned to the lay state by the Holy See. All are permanently barred from employment or volunteer ministry with the Archdiocese of Baltimore.\n\nIn September 2002, the Archdiocese of Baltimore published a list of priests and religious brothers[1] who had served in the Archdiocese of Baltimore and who had been accused, in their lifetime, of child sexual abuse. (At the time of its publication, the 2002 list did not include priests and brothers who were accused after their deaths because the Archdiocese could not question those who were accused and after death, they were not a danger to children.) The 57 men in that original publication are listed below and denoted by a *.\n\nSince 2002, additional priests and brothers have been added to this list because of a subsequently received allegation of child sexual abuse or because they were identified publicly in connection with an allegation, if the priest had an assignment in public ministry in the Archdiocese of Baltimore or the abuse occurred in Baltimore.\n\nBeginning in 2019, the Archdiocese updated its policy on naming priests and brothers accused after death. The Archdiocese added the names of priests and brothers accused after their deaths if the Archdiocese received an allegation of child sexual abuse from more than one victim, if a single allegation of child sexual abuse could be corroborated through external information, or if the name of the priest or brother was already published elsewhere in connection with an allegation of child sexual abuse.\n\nIn some cases, the information below derives from the 2018 Grand Jury Report of the Pennsylvania Attorney General or publications made by religious orders or other sources, and the individuals named would not otherwise meet the Archdiocese’s criteria for inclusion on this List. In many such cases, where the individual named is a priest from a religious order or other diocese, the Archdiocese’s information is limited.\n\nUpon recommendation of the Archdiocese’s Independent Review Board, the Archdiocese is not including in this list the names of additional priests where the allegation of child sexual abuse could not be substantiated or was ruled out, or where the allegation was from a third-party and the Archdiocese could not speak with the alleged victim. The Archdiocese continues to update this list with relevant information and entries as they are learned.\n\n***\n\nThe entries below list known, formal assignments within the geographic borders of the Archdiocese of Baltimore.[2] Many of the priests and brothers listed also served at additional locations on an informal basis, and at times outside of the Archdiocese of Baltimore. The priests and brothers may have also served at locations before or after their formal assignment dates. Priests who are listed with no parentheses after their names are priests of the Archdiocese of Baltimore; priests from religious orders or other dioceses have their order or diocese noted in parentheses after their name.\n\nThe following symbols before an individual’s name indicate:\n\n(+) indicates the individual is deceased\n\n(*) indicates the individual was listed in the Archdiocese’s initial publication made in 2002 (the remainder were added since that time)\n\nThe Archdiocese of Baltimore is committed to protecting children and helping to heal victims of abuse. We urge anyone who has any knowledge of any child sexual abuse to come forward, and report it immediately to law enforcement. If clergy or other church personnel is suspected of committing the abuse, we ask that you also call the Archdiocesan Victim’s Assistance Line at 1-866-417-7469 or the Archdiocesan Office of Child and Youth Protection at 410-547-5348.\n\n[1] Religious brothers are not ordained and so are considered lay people, and unlike some priests they do not receive faculties to perform ministry from the Archdiocese.\n\n[2] Many schools, hospitals, universities, seminaries, and other Catholic entities noted here or located within the geographic borders of the Archdiocese of Baltimore are not owned, operated, or controlled by the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Naming an entity in this listing does not necessarily indicate that it had a connection with the Archdiocese. Likewise, naming an individual does not necessarily indicate that the person had a connection with the Archdiocese or acted as an agent of the Archdiocese at any time, including at the time of the alleged abuse.\n\n+Affrica, Louis – In 2005, the Archdiocese received a report that Father Louis Affrica abused a minor in the mid-1970s. In 2007, a second individual reported abuse by Affrica in the late 1970s.
