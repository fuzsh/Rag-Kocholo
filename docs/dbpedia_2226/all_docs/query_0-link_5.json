        "text": "The visitor to the ‘Hanover’ area of Brighton who eventually finds this little church, clinging to one of our steepest hillsides, usually first remarks on its hiddenness – what a surprise to find a parish church in the heart of these tightly packed streets! This is just as the founder intended. The Church of The Annunciation of Our Lady in Washington Street, Brighton, was founded by the Revd. Arthur Douglas Wagner on 15 August 1864 as a Mission from St Paul’s, West Street in Brighton.\n\nFather Wagner\n\nThe Reverend Arthur Douglas Wagner, founder and benefactor, saw the workers’ cottages springing up amid the market gardens on the hill in the 1850’s and determined to build here a little church for the poor.\n\nThe wealthy visitors to Brighton from Regency days were well served by the Established Church, but Father Wagner’s intention was to bring the light of faith and education to the poor.\n\nThe fashionable Brighton churches drew crowds and charged pew rents but on this hillside was to be a place that was free and devoted only to its immediate neighbours, the labouring families of farm and railway workers and fishermen.\n\nHis convinced belief in the truth of the Incarnation (a favourite phrase of his was ‘Our Divine Incarnate Lord’) from which naturally flowed an unwavering devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and a firm grasp on the importance of the sacraments; can be seen clearly in his foundation of The Annunciation.\n\nFrom the first, the richness of worship in this place would be a solace for the local poor and despite the dark days of persecution for ‘ritualism’, the church remained hidden enough to develop quietly and steadily along the lines intended by its first devoted Priests. Always beginning a new project on a feast of Our Lady, Father Wagner preached at the opening of The Annunciation on 15th August 1864, (The Feast of The Assumption):\n\nWith that planting came the building of schools – at first provision was made for a School for Girls and Infants below the church (open to the air on 3 sides!) and in 1865 plans were lodged for the building of a Boys’ School in Southover Street (now the Hanover Community Centre). Even after the introduction of the Education Act providing state run education, several hundred children were still catered for in the Sunday School and associated Clubs and associations.\n\nHad plans for a separate School for girls been realised the intention was to assume the normal East – West axis of the church by removing the floor thus creating a high ceiling church and placing the the altar at the Washington Street end. When the parish was consulted, they apparently preferred the present simple lines and so the liturgical south aisle and Holy Name Chapel were added in 1881 by way of enlargement, and retaining the present axis.\n\nFather Chapman\n\nHere follow some excerpts from Father Chapman’s biography and the 1914 Jubilee Booklet to give the flavour of The Annunciation’s beginnings.\n\nA visitor in September 1864 remarked that Coleman Street was only a chalk path and Washington Street only half built and impassable: ‘I can remember being warned to walk in the middle of the road in Washington Street as smallpox was raging there’.\n\nThe early priests at The Annunciation were noted for their care: ‘The Clergy were liable to be called in all directions, especially for infectious diseases, which were then very prevalent. A lady who had a child ill with scarlet fever was in despair at being unable to get a priest to visit her. “Send to The Annunciation”, she was told, “you will not be refused there”; and so she found.’\n\nDescribing the parish in 1877 an observer wrote: ‘50 years ago there were only a few houses scattered here and there, among the market gardens. … now there are 16 streets of small modern houses; two streets are occupied by small shopkeepers of various trades. At 1pm the streets are thronged with men returning from the station works for their dinners; this shows the occupation of very many of the inhabitants. Others are employed in various houses of business, or do shop work at home. There are also a great number of small laundries. With the exception of the bottom row of houses the whole parish is essentially poor. Many of the houses contain two or more families.’\n\nFr Chapman, the first Vicar, died in 1891 of TB aged 44; Fr Fison the second Vicar, of Typhoid in 1895 aged 42.\n\nRitual Controversy\n\nThe Annunciation is one of the churches in the rich history of the Oxford Movement which has had its share of controversy concerning Ritualism within the Church of England.\n\nOne cannot really understand the controversies at the Annunciation without considering two related issues to divided not only Catholics and Protestants but also ritualistic and centrist Anglicans.\n\nThe reservation of the sacrament concerned the further use of sacraments after they have been blessed and distributed in the mass. Except for the sick and the dying reservation was largely prohibited in the Church of England after the Reformation.\n\nThe first church to revive the practice of reservation with St James so that’s in Liverpool this was George Chapman‘s former church. Transubstantiation is the Roman catholic belief shared by Anglo-Catholics during the Mass that bread and wine are miraculously transformed by the priest into the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ. This is known as The Real Presence.\n\nThe Annunciation has always revered the real presence in the mass and has a tradition of practising benediction, a service of blessing made with the Eucharistic bread. Evidence suggests that both reservation and exposition were introduced by George Chapman quite early in his tenure of the Annunciation, almost certainly the oldest surviving Anglican church in which the sacrament was reserved and benediction practised.\n\nFurther controversy arose in 1898 when the Archbishop of Canterbury declared the use of incense and portable lights within the service illegal but the Annunciation was one of the only churches to refuse to comply with the ban. A London bookseller by the name of John Kensit, a leading opposition figure, arranged for a friend George David to take up residence in the nearby Lincoln cottages so that he might join the electoral roll.\n\nIn 1899 David took successful legal action against the church on the churchwardens in the Ecclesiastical court. Still there was no compliance. Ministry at the Annunciation soon became the focus of renewed attack from Protestant organisations. In August 1902 a faculty was finally issued by the Bishop Ernest Wilberforce, to remove the offending ritualistic items.\n\nThe Annunciation stood firm and it was not until a year later the George David and his associates enter the church and carefully removed the idolatrous items. David was also accompanied by a solicitor and a press reporter who placed the offending items in a van and took them to his accommodation in Lincoln cottages where they were photographed a postcard of this photo was then swiftly printed and distributed to offer proof to the public of Father Hinde’s flouting of the law.\n\nAlthough Davey had the right to remove the items he had no right to keep them. A further court ruling was given in favour of the church, and the items were returned within a week although not put on display again for some years.\n\nThe contentious statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary which still stands at the front of the nave today had been raised as a memorial to Father Fison. It was the largest object to be removed from the church by its Protestant opponents. In recent years a statue with a Blessed Virgin Mary somewhat lighter than the expropriated one has been proudly paraded through the streets by the congregation without opposition. Birthday cards are still offered to the Blessed Virgin every year on the feast of her Nativity – the 8th September.\n\nThe Present Day\n\nVarious other additions have been given to the church over the years,. However, one gets the impression from the early accounts that what has been treasured most about this hidden gem has been the faithfulness and devotion of its people, its Religious Sisters and its priests. Their steadfastness and dedication have built up a place of palpable holiness and prayer that in the early days was clearly also the centre for education, welfare and social entertainment.\n\nSince 1994 the Church has also supported considerable artistic and musical talent with various exhibitions and concerts throughout the year. By the grace of God, amidst apparently ever accelerating changes in Church and society during the last century, The Annunciation maintains the daily round of prayer and catholic liturgy and its unusual position, opening directly onto the street like most of our houses, means that it cannot but be part of the community it was built to serve.\n\nPrevious Incumbents\n\nFirst priests:\n\nRevd.
