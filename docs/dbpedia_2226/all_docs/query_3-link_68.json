Past winners have included Jessye Norman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Midori. For 2021, WPA has presented the Ambassador of the Arts Award to bass and advocate for social justice Soloman Howard, one of our American Wagner Project singers!\n\n​\n\nFrom his formative years in the 1990s, singing in our Children of the Gospel Choir, to his current status as a celebrated performer on the world’s most esteemed operatic stages, Soloman Howard has been a voice not only for artistic excellence but for inclusivity, working to share the arts with ever larger and more widespread audiences.\n\n​\n\nUpon receiving the award, Howard remarked, “What an honor it is to be named Washington Performing Arts’ 2021 Ambassador of the Arts. Washington Performing Arts is special to me for several reasons: it’s the organization that gave me the platform that I needed to thrive; I learned and grew from my experiences there; it kept me in an environment that was safe for me to express my diversity as an artist; and it put me on big stages for major moments in history across the world. Those reasons make Washington Performing Arts a part of my heart and legacy—forever.”\n\nLearn more about Soloman and this award here.\n\nA review of Paul Heise's The Wound That Will Never Heal.\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nOur own Bill Pastor has provided us with a thorough and thought-provoking review of Paul Heise's scholarly work, The Wound That Would Never Heal: An Allegorical Interpretation of the Richard Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelung.

Buller\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nAs we all know, Wagner is a topic of endless fascination! Wagner scholar Jeffrey Buller is well known to society members for his entertaining and insightful lectures. Please take note of three of his latest publications - there is something for everyone!\n\n​\n\nThe second edition of Classically Romantic:Classical Forms and Meaning in Wagner's Ring. What did Richard Wagner know about ancient Greece? More importantly, what did he think he knew? How did Wagner’s attitudes about classical tragedy shape the Ring cycle? This is the book that discusses how leitmotivs don’t exist in Wagner’s music alone but also in certain patterns of alliteration, colors, and types of characters that function in ways very similar to in ways similar to musical leitmotivs. Classically Romantic is available as a paperback for $15.00 on Amazon and Barnes & Noble, and as an ebook for $6.00 from Apple Books.\n\n​\n\nDie, Meistersinger! is a light-hearted, “cozy” mystery with an operatic theme. When a tenor is murdered only days before the annual opera festival begins in the tiny European duchy of Allemonde, it’s up to Chief Inspector D. T. Giovanni to find the culprit. Unfortunately for Giovanni, everyone seems to have a motive and no one thinks he’s up to the challenge in this adventure that’s full of so many twists and turns it becomes a mystery on an operatic scale. The book is available as a paperback for $14.50 from Amazon and Barnes & Noble, or an ebook for $5.99 from Apple Books.\n\n​\n\nEternal Dreamer: The Imagery of Richard Wagner is based on the series of lectures Jeffrey Buller gave at Bayreuth. As one of the rare opera composers who wrote their own libretti, Wagner controlled what an audience heard, not only in his music, but also in the sound of his text. As a complete man of the theater, Wagner controlled (at least whenever he could) the lighting, set design, and costumes that an audience saw on the stage. The result was that a number of images—including sleep, dreams, storms, the potion, the significant glance, and the journey—reappear throughout Wagner’s mature works and are crucial to an appreciation of his artistry. Each of the ten music dramas included in Wagner’s “Bayreuth corpus” is discussed in detail, along with plenty of fresh insights for even the most seasoned admirer of the composer’s work. It is available as a paperback for $18.50 from Amazon and Barnes & Noble.\n\nIssachah Savage triumphs as Tannhaüser, onstage and livestream\n\nOctober 25, 2021\n\nUpdated 11/19/2021: We hope you were able to take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy one of Issachah's triumphant performances as Tannhaüser in October at the Los Angeles Opera.\n\nAmerican Wagner Project alumnus Issachah Savage has garnered high praise for his debut as Tannhaüser in Los Angeles on Saturday night. One reviewer wrote that he \"commanded the stage with his rare and beautiful voice\" and another called the performance a \"feast for the ears.\" You can read a detailed review of his performance at the end of this article from parterre.com.\n\nIssachah's success as Tannhaüser follows a string of outstanding performances in recent years. He swept the boards at Seattle's International Competition in 2014, taking the First Prize, Audience Prize, and Orchestra Favorite awards. His portrayals of Rienzi, Siegmund, and Lohengrin, among others, have deeply impressed both critics and audiences.\n\n--The Washington Post's Anne Midgette wrote that Issachah \". . .has that rarest of instruments: a large voice of melting beauty.\" In the role of Rienzi, \"he wielded it with ease and grace through a long night of singing, marshaling his energy wisely so that he had plenty to give where it counted, especially the Act V prayer, the evening's showpiece.\"\n\n--Neil Crory of Musical Toronto, reviewing his performance as Siegmund, described Issachah's voice as \"a lyric, unforced dramatic tenor, lighter in colour and yet powerful. . . The roaring ovation that greeted him when he walked out on stage for his curtain call was of a quality and pitch usually reserved for only the greatest of singers.\"\n\n--The San Francisco Examiner's Janos Gereben said Issachah \"brought the house down\" with his performance as Lohengrin. According to Gereben, \" 'Mein Lieber Schwan' was heldentenor par excellence -- trumpetlike, clear, open-throated, powerful.\"\n\nThree Pillars of Modern Western Culture by William H. Pastor - click here to purchase!\n\nApril 29, 2021\n\nWe are delighted to announce the publication of a new book by one of our long-time members, Bill Pastor. Three Pillars of Modern Western Culture focuses on Wagner’s influence on two literary masterpieces of the early twentieth century: James Joyce’s Ulysses and Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time. In particular, this work illustrates how the techniques and principles of leitmotifs, endless melody, and Gesamtkunstwerk are incorporated throughout Ulysses and In Search of Lost Time. Mr. Pastor's hope is to stimulate interest among music-loving Wagnerians to read the novels Ulysses and In Search of Lost Time and to stimulate interest among literary-loving Joyce and Proust enthusiasts to listen to the music of Wagner. For those in both camps, he hopes to enrich the appreciation of the historic and artistic connection between these three pillars of Western aesthetics and culture. For those not in any of these groups, this is an opportunity for a trifecta!\n\nJuly 21, 2020\n\nFather Owen Lee -- He was revered by hundreds as a Catholic Basilian priest, esteemed by thousands as a Professor of Classics, and treasured by millions around the world for his three decades of brilliant radio broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nTo mark the first anniversary of Father Lee's death (Saturday, July 25), Wagner scholar Iain Scott -- a close friend and associate of Father Lee -- has launched a new memorial website to honor his legacy.\n\nThe site contains seven video interviews, four audio playlists of his Metropolitan Opera broadcasts, some brief descriptions of his 21 books, and a selection of documents, both by and about him.\n\nI hope you will find that it appropriately celebrates a great man.\n\nRequiescas in pace, good Father.\n\nAbout\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe Wagner Society of Washington, DC is one of the city's most vibrant cultural institutions. We are proud to serve the Washington community in many ways - through monthly lectures, semi-annual concerts, and special events through a network of collaborating institutions such as the German Embassy, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the Smithsonian Institution. Now in our 20th year, the Wagner Society is dedicated to two principal goals:\n\n​\n\n1. To enrich the cultural life of the Washington metropolitan area by regularly providing the general public with lectures, concerts, opera performances, trips, and special events;\n\n​\n\n2. To assist the development of American singers who have demonstrated the potential for successful careers in opera.\n\n​\n\nIn May of 1998 a small group of Wagner enthusiasts met to create a Wagner Society for Washington, DC. Aurelius Fernandez, who became our first president, and Barbara Karn, Janice Rosen and R.G. Head asked Jim Holman to join the steering committee as Chairman; in short order they recruited John Edward Niles, Phil Raines, Tom Arthur, and then Betty Byrne and John Pohanka, among others. The first meeting was held in the back room of Middle C music store. Professor Don Crosby, a Wagner Award recipient, presented \"The Literary Sources of Tristan und Isolde.\" Fewer than 20 were in attendance.\n\n​\n\nIt was our good fortune that Wolfgang Wagner, Artistic Director of the Bayreuth Festival and Richard Wagner's grandson, and his wife Gudrun were in Washington in February 1999 to attend the Washington National Opera's Tristan und Isolde. Wolfgang gave an address to WNO, and afterwards Jim invited the Wagners to lunch with Aury, Barb, and RG. The conversation turned to Bayreuth and in a stunning act of bravado our group asked the Wagners for an allotment of tickets; without blinking an eye, Gudrun said yes. In a few months, sets of tickets for the Rings plus other Bayreuth productions arrived in the mail. In our twenty-plus over 400 members and friends have made the Bayreuth pilgrimage in a relationship now carried forward through the Richard Wagner Verband International Association.\n\n​\n\nThe Emerging Singers Program was founded a year later when John Edward Niles proposed a partnership between the Society and the famous Wagnerian baritone Thomas Stewart and his wife, soprano Evelyn Lear, who had recently moved to Washington. With Jim Holman they created a program to nurture Americans with the potential to sing the Wagner canon.\n\n​\n\nAlumni of the ESP, and its successor the American Wagner Project, include Jay Hunter Morris (2001), Siegfried in the recent San Francisco Opera and Metropolitan Opera Rings; Jennifer Wilson (2001, 2004) Brunnhilde in the Valencia and Florence Rings; Daniel Brenna (2005), Siegfried in the 2016 WNO Ring and Alea in the recent Metropolitan Opera Lulu; Rebecca Teem (2005, 2007) Brunnhilde in the Lubeck, Germany Ring and Berlin's Deutsch Oper; Issachah Savage (2012, 2013), who won first prize at the 2014 Seattle International Wagner Fesitval; and Solomon Howard (2015), Fafner in the 2016 WNO Ring.\n\n​\n\nWagner in der Wildnis formed in 2001 when members Barb Karn suggested a scholarly retreat to explore a single Wagner opera. Her idea was championed by Aurelius Fernandez and Betty Byrne. Barb and Betty secured the Cacapon, WV site. Today, coordinated by Lynne Lambert and Sabrina Cassagnol, Wildnis draws 70 enthusiasts to Cacapon Resort State Park in Berkeley Springs, WV, to hear presentations by Simon Williams, Professor of Dramatic Arts at UC-Santa Barbara, and Jeffrey Swann, concert pianist and esteemed Wagnerian. Wildnis is in its 22nd year.\n\n​\n\nWe have presented The Wagner Award to 15 scholars and artists who have made extraordinary contributions to the enjoyment and understanding of Wagner's art. The honorees include Prof. Donald Crosby, John Pohanka, Jay Hunter Morris, Jennifer Wilson, Francesca Zambello, Jeffrey Swann, Saul Lilienstein, baritone James Morris, Thomas Stewart and Evelyn Lear, and Maestro Philippe Auguin.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n​\n\nJames K. Holman, Chairman\n\nJoshua Baumgardner\n\nBonnie Becker\n\nSabrina Cassagnol\n\nDeborah Diamond\n\nMark Golden\n\nFrederic Harwood\n\nLynne Lambert\n\nJohn Edward Niles\n\n​"
