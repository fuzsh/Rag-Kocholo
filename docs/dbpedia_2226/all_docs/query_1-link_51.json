Just like all the students on campus, each person's prayer is unique to them. There are numerous types of prayers, along with communal and individual prayers. There are many opportunities on campus for prayer.\n\nSome of many prayer opportunities include...\n\nLiturgy of the Hours- This is the daily prayer of the Church. There are five hours that are observed, Office of Readings, Morning, Midday, Evening, and Night Prayer. Students gather together at 10 p.m. daily to pray Night Prayer in the Saint Francis Chapel (Oldenburg Hall). Liturgy of the Hours will be prayed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 6 p.m. in the Saint Francis Chapel.\n\nA great resource for Liturgy of the Hours is IBreviary, which is an app that can be downloaded to your device.\n\nThere is an opportunity to pray the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Our Lady of Perpetual Help Chapel every day.\n\nRosary- The rosary is a repetitious and contemplative prayer attributed to the Blessed Mother. It combines prayers of the Apostles' Creed, the Our Father, Hail Mary, and scriptures. Students can participate at 5:30 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in the Our Lady of Perpetual Help Chapel, and 6:30 p.m. on Tuesdays in the Bishop Chartrand Memorial Chapel.\n\nSpontaneous Praise and Worship- Our four chapels can be used for some spontaneous praise and worship. If you and your friends are musically inclined, the chapels are a great place to sit and worship the Lord through your musical talents.\n\nDivine Mercy Chaplet - The Divine Mercy Chaplet is much like the rosary, as it is a meditative and repetitive prayer style using the beads of the rosary. Different prayers are used instead of the traditional Our Father and Hail Mary. This prayer can also be sung if you feel so inclined.\n\nSaint Francis Prayer - As a Franciscan University the Saint Francis prayer is another great resource for prayer.\n\nJesus Prayer- This is a simple prayer of \"Lord Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\"\n\nLitanies- Litanies are a series of petitions and intercessory prayers. These are often call and repeat prayers but can be prayed alone as well. There are many litanies for many different petitions.\n\nNovenas- Novenas are devotional prayers that span nine days. There are hundreds of novenas in all different categories. Often times they are prayed for nine days up to a feast but also can be prayed for certain intentions.\n\nPrayers to the Saints- There are devotional prayers to many of the saints that can be prayed for their intercessions in our daily lives. Just Google the saint of your choosing and you can find many prayers.\n\nLectio Divina- This prayer is a meditative style of prayer based on the Scriptures. This four-step prayer helps you dive deep into a Scripture passage.\n\nDon't be afraid to try some less structured prayer styles as well...\n\nContemplative Prayer- Contemplative prayer is sitting quietly alone with the Father and the Son.\n\nHeart Prayer- This type of prayer is talking to God as a friend. Just open up your heart to God.\n\nJournaling- Write and/or draw in your notebook or journal to praise the Lord.\n\nListening to/Playing Christian Music- Use music to praise.\n\nMeditation- Sit on all of the beauty and blessings along with the struggles of life with God.\n\nPrayer Walking- Take a walk in the beauty of nature that God has given us.\n\nReading the Bible- Opening the Bible and reading the Word of the Lord is prayer. A Bible study will be conducted on Thursdays at 7 p.m. in Evans Center 150.\n\nSpiritual Readings- Reflect on readings from any spiritual book.\n\nSpontaneous Prayer- Just pray. Speak what your heart is telling you to let go to God. A group of students will be practicing this on Tuesdays at 3 p.m. in the Saint Francis Chapel (Oldenburg).\n\nThank God for the beauty of nature. When you see the sunrise or sunset just say \"thank you Lord\""
