Bea’s childhood dream was to become a nurse and she fulfilled that dream, serving as a nurse in the U.S. Navy, taking care of soldiers during World War II. She joined the Navy because she wanted to do something to help the servicemen. She said, “As a Jew, I learned how our people were being slaughtered and I wanted to anything that I could to help overthrow those who were persecuting my people.” After completing her tour, she worked as a private duty nurse in numerous hospitals and several private practices.\n\nBea joined the JCC when she moved to Staten Island. Bea’s involvement at the “J” spans from being a Cub Scout leader to later helping develop their SeniorNet, a computer instruction class for adults. Bea was also instrumental in helping open one of the first group homes on the Island for individuals with developmental disabilities Bea has been recognized for her community involvement with a “Woman of Achievement” award from the Staten Island Advance and the senior Olympics that she brought to the Island is now affectionately known as “Beatrice Victor Senior Olympics” in her honor.\n\nRuth Kupperberg ’20, Next Generation Award\n\nRuth Kupperberg just completed her junior year at Wagner College. She is a Theatre Performance Major and a Holocaust and Human Rights Minor. Ruth will be the first student at Wagner to hold the honor of graduating with this minor. She is currently is the President of the Wagner College Hillel. Since becoming president in 2018, she has worked with other students on campus to expand the club’s membership, programming and overall outreach. As a Hillel Peer Engagement Intern, her goal has been to build relationships on campus to strengthen Wagner’s vibrant and meaningful Jewish community.\n\nRuth also has been a vital member and intern for the Wagner College Holocaust Center. In 2018, she starred in the Holocaust Center’s play, “In The Light of One Another,” which shed light on actual testimonies of Staten Island Holocaust survivors. Her participation in Holocaust education at Wagner inspired Ruth to visit a concentration camp last summer while studying vocal performance in Dresden, Germany. This experience rounded out her knowledge and sentiments towards the subject.\n\nRabbi Avraham Hakohen “Romi” Cohn, zt”l\n\nCourage Award (posthumously)\n\nAvraham Romi Cohn was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia on March 10, 1929. When he was only 10 years old, his hometown was invaded by Nazi Germany. Anti-Semitism against the Jews escalated. By 1942, when mass deportations of Jews from Slovakia began, Romi crossed the border into Hungary illegally to study at a yeshiva. At age 15, he returned to Bratislava with forged Christian identity papers and joined the underground. He was able to help find housing and support over 50 Jewish families in hiding. He worked with a janitor in Gestapo headquarters to authenticate documents. Exposed for carrying false documents, Romi was arrested. After a daring escape, he joined the partisans. He used his connections to forge a German military travel order, identifying him as a Nazi officer and allowing him to ride in a train of SS officers to the border. As one of the few Jews in his unit of Slovakian partisans, he had to hide his identity. His brigade drove the Germans back and captured, interrogated and executed SS officers. When Hungary was liberated, Romi returned home and was reunited with his father and two sisters, Sara and Hanna. Tragically, his mother, Emilia; two sisters, Deborah and Hindi and two brothers, David and Yaakov, were killed.\n\nAfter moving to Brooklyn, Romi married Malvine Geldzahler, a survivor from Antwerp-Belgium in 1949. He became a rabbi and also worked as a real estate developer. Notably, he built 3,500 homes on Staten Island. Romi found another avocation as a mohel, performing over 30,000 circumcisions on newborns and adults, free of charge and trained over 100 mohels.\n\nConcerned about rising Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism, Romi co-authored a book with Prof. Leonard Ciaccio in 2001 based on his tragic life experiences, titled The Youngest Partisan: A Young Boy Who Fought the Nazis. He recently wrote a second book on his mentor, The Ribnitzer Rebbe.\n\nHe had been a good friend and supporter of the Wagner College Chai Society. Rabbi Cohn’s gift of his Gestapo “travel order” (false I.D. card) was the first donation to the Wagner College Holocaust Center. In 2015, he spoke at and frequently lit candles at our Kristallnacht and Yom ha’Shoah events. He was very proud of how Wagner students memorized his testimony and captured his experiences in the play Young Holocaust Heroes, which has been seen by over 2,000 students in New York and New Jersey.\n\nRabbi Cohn received an honorary doctorate from Wagner College in 2016. Rabbi Cohn’s message to the next generation was to have courage to stand up to anti-Semitism on the street or in the community. “…this could happen in a civilized country, overnight…Within 6 months, propaganda turned the population completely.”\n\nOn January 29, 2020, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, Congressman Max Rose asked Rabbi Cohn to deliver the opening prayer before the United States House of Representatives.\n\nLast year, the Wagner College Chai Society selected Romi to be the recipient of the Courage Award at the 2020 Chai Society Community Mitzvah Awards. Romi had graciously agreed to accept the award and said that he was honored to have been selected. Sadly, Romi passed away on March 24, 2020 at the age of 91, from complications from COVID-19. The Wagner College Chai Society was grateful to call Romi a friend; may his memory be a blessing.\n\nCharles DeStefano – Monroe J. Klein ‘66 Humanitarian Award\n\nCharles DeStefano is a trial attorney who has maintained a private practice in Sunnyside representing injured persons for 31 years. He was born in Brooklyn and moved to Staten Island in 1973. He is a graduate of Monsignor Farrell High School, Fordham University (BA) and Pace School of Law (Juris Doctor).\n\nHe currently serves as Law Chair of the Democratic Party of Richmond County, Chair of the Mayor’s Committee on City Marshals and President-Elect of the Staten Island Trial Lawyers Association.\n\nCharles has happily committed himself to Staten Island Community Affairs, including as a member of the Board of Directors of the Richmond County Bar, La Colmena (immigrant support organization), Integrated Community Facilities (assisting the disabled with permanent living management), the Jacques Marchais Tibetan Museum of Art, the Staten Island Interfaith Community Days, the Latino Attorneys Association and the NYC Comptroller’s “Red Tape Commission” (improving conditions for small businesses.) He is the founder of the Staten Island Trial Lawyers Association Student Internship Program which mentors high school and college students interested in careers in law.\n\nCharles is most proud of his wife, Ana, and their two sons, Joseph and Matteo. His family has served as “elves” to his “Santa” each Christmas to provide toys and clothing to the children of Mount Carmel Church. This past year was Charles’ 23rd year doing so.\n\nCharles most recently accepted the honor of serving as a member of the Wagner College Holocaust Center Advisory Committee. His son, Joseph, age 13, has been active in Holocaust studies and he purchased and donated five artifacts, including three letters from prisoners of Dachau and Mauthausen. Joseph also created a “Google Class” to educate his eighth grade classmates about the Holocaust.\n\nCharles is deeply honored to be a recipient of the Monroe J. Klein ‘66 Humanitarian Award. He noted that Rabbi Romi Cohn, who is being honored posthumously, was an inspiration to him and personal hero.\n\nMarc D. Lebovitz ‘91 – Allan Weissglass Civic Leadership Award\n\nMarc D.

After graduating, Emma plans to pursue a career in the Theatre industry whether it be as a performer, educator, casting director, or wherever her passions may lead her.\n\nArthur Spielman\n\nCourage Award\n\nThe Courage Award celebrates an inspirational individual who personifies strength and resilience in overcoming adversity and prejudice and is a role model to others.\n\nArthur Spielman was born in December 1928, in Krakow, Poland. He grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family with his father, Simon, mother, Czarna, and two sisters, Helen and Barbara. Arthur’s neighborhood in Kazimierz, Krakow was primarily Jewish. In 1939, the Nazi flag was raised at the Wawel castle marking a German victory, the invasion of Poland, and the beginning of World War II. The Germans declared Krakow as the designated capital of the General government. Hans Frank was appointed Governor-General and established his headquarters in the Wawel Castle, former home to Poland’s royalty. The Nazi officials wished to remove Jews from the rest of the Polish society. After December 1939, Jews living in ghettos were required to wear identifying badges or armbands and a decree was issued requiring them to perform forced labor for the German Reich. Arthur, a young boy at the time, remembers being afraid to walk in the streets in fear of deportation.\n\nAlthough his family was not required to move into the Krakow ghetto due to his father’s status as an international diplomat, the Spielman family chose to move to live closer to their extended family. Within the Krakow ghetto, Arthur lived in a single apartment with his parents, sisters, and grandparents. In 1942, the Gestapo entered the ghetto and took Spielman’s grandparents. Arthur never saw them again. Many of Arthur’s relatives were brutally murdered in the ghetto. Due to the escalating violence, Spielman’s father moved the family to a secluded house outside of the ghetto. Soon after, the Spielman family was given a tip that life was going to get much worse in Krakow, so they left.\n\nArthur’s father paid a man to take him and his sister Helen out of the ghetto into Slovakia and then Hungary, where they were placed in different orphanages. Later, his parents and youngest sister, Barbara, also fled to Hungary, where they reunited while visiting him in the orphanage. Arthur’s father received word that the Nazis would be liquidating the orphanages, so he sent a Polish officer to release Arthur and his sister Helen. The officer approached Arthur and told him, “Follow me. Don’t talk, don’t say anything, just follow me.” His parents had papers as Christians, so he went to a Polish ministerial and said he was Roman Catholic to get his papers using the name of Nieczkowski in order to receive them. From Budapest, they went to Miskolc, another city in Hungary, and lived there as Gentiles for about a year.\n\nIn April 1944, the Nazis marched into Hungary. Arthur recalled, “Everything was happening very fast. We had some Jewish friends. We warned them to do something, go into hiding or run away. A lot of them did not believe the stories we were telling them about what happened in Poland, they didn’t think what happened to the Polish Jews would happen to them. We saw people walking carrying their belongings. We ourselves went into hiding. We were afraid, so we didn’t go out of the house. For a couple of weeks, every morning at like 10 o’clock in the morning sirens blew and there were planes over the city bombing the factory.”\n\nHe recalled hiding out, only leaving when his mother sent him to the marketplace. Arthur said, “We lived across from a marketplace which was huge. They mistook the town market for an army camp and dropped the bombs on the town market and a lot of people were killed.”\n\n“Towards the end of the war before the Russians came in, we were hiding in the wine cellars, most people were hiding in wine cellars in Miskolc. There were bombs going back and forth. We didn’t have much food then. I was standing in line at a bakery…a bomb hit and a few people got killed next to me. I slid into a basement, I don’t know how I wound up there and I was saved by just a scratch. We stayed in the wine cellar for about six weeks, from October until we were liberated. We slept between barrels, big barrels with thousands of liters of wine. A lot of times we had no water to drink [so] we drank fresh wine. My mother cooked on a little furnace, gas stove, whatever she could make, soup blette, vegetables, fruit, meat, fish occasionally. We were very lucky in the city of Miskolc. We were hearing news from other people and propaganda papers. While we were in the wine cellar we heard cannons, shooting, then it quieted down…a few hours later first patrol, then half an hour later Russian soldiers on horses, then trucks and boogies filled with soldiers. They were coming by the thousands and then we realized we were liberated.” Arthur and his family left the cellar and returned to their apartment a few days later. He recalled his Hungarian neighbors were shocked when they found out Arthur’s family was Jewish. “A little later me and my father went to Krakow to Poland, by train. We walked part of the way over the mountains, went to see if there were any survivors.” Tragically only two out of 300 family members survived. Arthur and his family lived for three years in Displaced Persons camps outside of Munich and immigrated to the United States in May 1949.\n\nArthur continues to share his story in hopes of preserving the significance of the Holocaust, encouraging meaningful conversations, and teaching respect and appreciation to younger generations. He has spoken at Susan E. Wagner High School, Port Richmond High School, Lavelle Prep Charter School, P.S. 19, Jewish Foundation School of Staten Island, Ben Porat Yosef in New Jersey, and at a 3GNY Descendants of Holocaust Survivors event. His message for the younger generation is simple – “never forget.”\n\nJoel Cohen\n\nMonroe J. Klein ’66 Humanitarian Award\n\nThe Monroe J. Klein ’66 Humanitarian Award is given in memory of the Wagner alumnus, businessman and veteran, and recognizes an individual who exemplifies the same spirit of “loving kindness,” Gemilut Chassadim and generosity.\n\nBorn in old Staten Island Hospital on May 25, 1929, Joel Cohen is a lifelong Staten Islander. The only child of Shirley and Irving Cohen, he (along with Ron Avis, among others) attended a two-room public schoolhouse through grade 3-B, then P.S. 16, Curtis High School and Wagner College. He then earned a master’s degree from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, before serving for three years in the U.S. Army.\n\nUpon discharge, he worked successively as a reporter for a trade newspaper, speechwriter for the Secretary of State of New York State, and publicist for the news division of ABC-TV. Joel then became a full-time freelance writer, publishing some 35 books, most for young readers, with or about prominent sports figures, as well as biographies of Norman Rockwell, Bill Cosby and a Holocaust survivor. He fulfilled a variety of assignments, including three years writing a weekly family-humor column for the Staten Island Advance and articles or essays in Parents magazine, TV Guide, the New York Times, the Baltimore Sun. Chicago Tribune, Miami Herald and magazines of Brown University and Smith College.\n\nFor three year recently, he wrote a weekly column for the online San Diego Jewish World. Some columns were on serious subjects, such as learning he and Anne Frank were born less than three weeks apart, and the implication thereof…but most were spoofs of former President Trump.

She is a Philosophy major and English minor pursuing law. Bethany is currently the president of Hillel and the founder of Shir Levav (Sing from the Heart).\n\nThree years ago, she met Auschwitz survivor Hannah Steiner as an incoming freshman at Wagner College. Hannah is brave, smart, personable, and beautiful. Even in Auschwitz, Hannah kept her spirits up by sharing recipes with those around her. In a course that paired Holocaust Studies and Acting, Bethany had the privilege to pick a monologue from Hannah to perform for her classmates, with guidance from Professors Theresa McCarthy and Lori Weintrob. She was ecstatic when she found out that she would be reading her monologues in an original play, Rise Up: Young Holocaust Heroes. It was an honor for Bethany to recall Hannah’s hope and tragedies in her own words.\n\nBethany will never forget the day she met her and got to talk with Hannah Steiner. She found out about Hannah’s love story with her husband, Abraham, how proud Hannah was of her children and grandchildren, how much she loved elephants, she got to see all of her family pictures. Bethany and Hannah talked to each other for hours and Hannah looked so happy.\n\nAfter her experience interacting with Hannah, Bethany wanted to continue to see her, because she truly cared for her. This is when Bethany started to think about the other survivors she studied or met. Bethany then formulated the idea of an organization where students of Wagner College could use the arts to make Holocaust Survivors and others of that generation smile. Shir Levav means Sing from the Heart in Hebrew. With support from the Wagner College Holocaust Center and Chai Society, Bethany and Dr. Weintrob took action. Shir Levav sang and connected with survivors starting in 2019 and in 2020-2021, even virtually during quarantine. Bethany believes that the arts give people the opportunity to connect with others in a universal way. It is amazing to see that Holocaust survivors have the same favorite songs as members of Shir Levav or love the same meals. Through Shir Levav students learn about their heroes in a way which truly connects them – through music.\n\nIn addition to Shir Levav and Hillel, Bethany was Professor Mickey Tennenbaum’s assistant director for the second production of “Rise Up: Holocaust Heroes”, which premiered at the St. George Theatre in 2019 for hundreds of young students. She has also been a Holocaust Center Intern since her freshman year at Wagner College.\n\nBethany is the president of the Pre-Law Society and a member of Omicron Delta Kappa.

During the war, she moved to nearby Munkacs to train to be a seamstress like her mother. In April 1944, Shirley’s entire family was forced to move to the ghetto. Worse, they were then packed into a cattle car for three days to Auschwitz. Just 17 years old, Shirley was assigned to Kanada, an area near crematoria IV where clothing was sorted that belonged to those Jews who were killed. When she found her mother’s shoe among the belongings of those Jews sent to the gas chambers, she knew the Nazis had murdered her. She sometimes found extra bread or sardines. Shirley was an eyewitness to the October 1944 uprising in Auschwitz. Shirley married and came to the U.S. in 1949. Lester born in 1952. Lori born in 1957.

October 10, 1920) was denied the honor to be the valedictorian of her grade school in Rülzheim, Germany under the Nazi Regime. Despite laws that barred Jews from the movie theaters, one neighbor allowed Margot to sneak in to see films starring her favorite actress Shirley Temple. Margot became an eyewitness to Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, barely fleeing the local synagogue in time. Fearing for her safety, Margot’s mother sent her at age 18 to England. She spent a year there before coming to the United States as a refugee. Margot’s brother Paul built a new life in Sweden, but her parents were killed. As a refugee, she began a new life and married Eric Capell, a World War II U.S. veteran whose family had fled Germany too. In October 2021, Margot turned 101 years old.\n\nCourage Award\n\nHannah (born 11/29/1925) grew up in the city of Oradea, Romania, where she helped her mother Helen with sewing and played the violin. In 1941, after the Hungarian police took away Helen’s license, they moved to Budapest, Hungary. There, Hannah fell in love at 15-years old with Abraham Steiner, whom she met at a dance. Abraham was taken to a labor camp when the Germans invaded Hungary in 1944. Hannah credits her mother’s love for her survival after their deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau. To distract from acute hunger, “we were cooking…verbally. We cooked! We said: my mother did this and you did this.” Tragically, they were transferred to Bergen-Belsen, where Helen died of typhus in Hannah’s arms after liberation. Weighing 62 pounds, Hannah was taken to Sweden to recuperate. She was reunited in Israel with Abraham after seven years of separation. They got married August 22, 1950 and remained together for 60 years. Her first son Michael was born in Israel in 1951. Four years later, Jake was born 1955. After living in Israel (Holon), they sought better employment opportunities. They moved to San Paulo to be with her brother Julius Abraham, who was also an Auschwitz survivor and had moved to Brazil. After a few years, they moved to Brooklyn where their daughter Helene was born in 1963. Hannah continued to work as a seamstress and Abraham worked as a jeweler. They were among the early members of Young Israel of Canarsie. In 2000, they moved to Staten Island where she participated in Cafe Europa at the Alan and Joan Bernikow Staten Island Jewish Community Center. Initially hesitant to share her story, Hannah took tremendous pride in speaking with the Wagner College Holocaust Center to students in public schools. She later spoke at several yeshivas as well. She developed meaningful relationships with Wagner College students who heard her tragic story. She received many meaningful notes from students of all ages. Her life was reenacted on the stage in the production of Rise Up: Young Holocaust Heroes (St. George Theater, 2019) and featured in the NY-Emmy winning series Where Life Leads You.
