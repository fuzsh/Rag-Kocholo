        "text": "The interpretation of Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal has been one of the most philosophically and theologically controversial. Over the years various interpretations have been given, among them Buddhist, Schopenhauer-ian, anti-Semite, and Christian. In this paper, I argue that this music drama is fundamentally a Christian work. I begin by discussing some methodological and background historical issues. I consider difficulties concerning bias in interpretation and the complicated intellectual life of Wagner, and propose to overcome these difficulties by testing various interpretations by their consistency with various parts of the music drama, and to interpret the statements of this music drama within that context. I then argue that Parsifal reflects the soteriological concepts of sola gratia, sola fide and sola Christus that are unique to Christianity but inconsistent with other interpretations. Finally, I address various objections to my Christian interpretation.\n\nThe article discusses Richard Wagner’s last music-drama, which today is the traditional Good Friday “opera” in New York, Vienna, and other venues around the globe. I argue that Parsifal utilizes traditional Christian symbols and thereby transforms them, in order to help transform the world of the audience. The first part of the article summarizes the dramatic conflict and analyzes how the work appropriates the Christian symbolism of the Lord’s Supper. I also look at Wagner’s essay “Religion and Art,” which was written during the composition of Parsifal and presents an ethical critique of Christianity in the name of “true religion.” The second part of the article presents two assessments of Parsifal, both of which acknowledge its inherent religious symbolism but come to different conclusions regarding its significance (Christian versus atheistic). The third part of the article offers an alternative interpretation and implies trajectories for further research.\n\nIn May 1849 Wagner fled Dresden after the failure of the uprising of which he was a leader. His last creative work in Dresden was prose sketches for an opera Jesus of Nazareth, the result of his study of the Graeco-Roman world and the New Testament together with some knowledge of biblical criticism. Although he portrays Jesus as a social revolutionary in that he attacks the Pharisees, oppression and injustice, he is by no means a political messiah; indeed Wagner emphases his sacrificial death which results in the giving of the Holy Spirit. Key theological themes of the work which I explore include Jesus’ messiahship, law and freedom, and the significance of his death.\n\nWagner’s final opera Parsifal, which he termed a Bühnenweihfestspiel (‘stage-festival consecration play’), was first performed in 1878. It is a strange, serious, and beautiful work, alternately hailed as a profoundly Christian statement and a hyperbolic pseudo-religious spectacle, with occult or even Buddhist (derived from Schopenhauer) pretensions. The plot is based on medieval sources (chiefly Wolfram von Eschenbach’s epic poem Parzival), and shows Wagner’s continued fascination with the Grail legends that informed, at least partly, his earlier works Tannhäuser (1845) and Lohengrin (1848). Both those operas retained a view of human love as redemptive and integrated both negative and positive exemplars of womanhood (Venus and Elisabeth, Ortrud and Elsa, though it is worth noting that the virtuous women die in the final moments of both operas). The wretched and outcast seductress, Kundry, the sole female in Parsifal, is an extraordinary artistic creation, yet Wagner’s unambiguous rejection of her cements the view that the ideal male brotherhood, represented by the Grail Knights’ devotion to their wounded leader Amfortas, is offered to modern audiences as a template for society. Wagner’s plot in Parsifal picks up on two further motifs from Wolfram’s poem; that the Grail can bring wholeness to the wounded and diseased, and that true innocence – such as is embodied in Parsifal, the Holy Fool – is godly and good, and escapes the corruption of the world. These themes make Parsifal particularly difficult, in that the sexually profligate Wagner embraces celibacy, the composer who celebrates beauty forensically details a diseased community (that is still deemed both authentic and desirable) and its painfully wounded leader, and the one-time revolutionary embraces the abrogation of individual freedom that accompanies duty and devotion to a God-ordained hereditary leader. For these reasons, Parsifal is a unique combination of the medieval and the modern, so much so that it is difficult not to conclude that the nineteenth-century Wagner heralded the medieval as the cure for the ills of modernity.\n\nRichard Wagner (1813-1883) is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever composers, yet debate continues over the possible presence of anti-Semitism in his works. Nothing directly links characters, or the libretti of his operas with Judaism. However, plenty of Wagner’s own writings - from publicly published articles to letters and diary entries - prove, beyond doubt, his feelings towards Jewish people. Furthermore, a question mark also hangs over when and why Wagner developed such views. What follows is an attempt to trace the extent of anti-Semitism in Wagner’s operas through examining works from the beginning, middle and end of his prolific career. Wagner was a founder of ‘ontological anti-Semitism’; ‘hostility toward the Jews that concentrates on their being rather than their religion or economic practices, or any one particular attribute.’ (Sokel, 1991, p154.) From a musicological direction of entry, we can thus begin our analysis by dismissing the possibility any implicit anti-Semitism was unintentional due to ignorance. Wagner’s intentions and implied meanings are based on his views, the culture in Germany at the time, and any other people or events which may have affected these operas. A ‘cultural anti-Semitism’ was present in 19th century Germany and ‘for Wagner, Jewishness was a necessary evil’ in order ‘to define Germanness.’ (Millington, 2013, p186.) I shall thus attempt to trace the presence of anti-Semitism throughout Wagner’s career by looking at his two most popular operas; Rienzi and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, and his final opera, Parsifal."
