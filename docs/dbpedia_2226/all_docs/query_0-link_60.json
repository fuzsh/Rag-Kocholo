        "text": "Mark J. Wagner\n\nAssociate Professor and Director, Center for Archaeological Investigations\n\nMy interests include the prehistory and early history of both Native Americans and Europeans in Illinois and the lower Ohio River Valley. I am particularly interested in culture contact issues between Native Americans and Euro-Americans and the variable outcomes contact had for members of both groups. Current projects include the investigation of an 1801-1802 U.S. Army post (Cantonment Wilkinson) that represented a reserve base for an invasion of the then Spanish-held Mississippi River Valley that never took place as well as the documentation of nineteenth century shipwrecks in the lower Ohio River. I also have a strong interest in Native American rock art sites focused around my belief that these sites represent largely untapped sources of information regarding prehistoric Native American spirituality and religious beliefs.\n\nPublications\n\n2006 Going to See the Varmint: Piracy in Myth and Reality on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, 1785-1830 (first author with Mary R.
