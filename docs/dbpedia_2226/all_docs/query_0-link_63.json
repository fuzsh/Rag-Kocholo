        "text": "Wagner and Religious Ideas\n\nWagner's Strange Mind\n\nRichard Wagner was a very strange man. He grew up in a theatrical family, living in the Jewish quarter of Leipzig. His father died while Richard was still quite young and his mother remarried, to an actor called Geyer, whom Wagner seems to have regarded as his real father. His uncle Adolph introduced young Richard to books and he became an obsessive reader. It is hard to believe, in fact, that Richard found time to write music or anything else, when he was reading books for many hours a day.\n\nContrary to what most people believe, Richard had few original ideas of his own, although he made new connections between ideas that he found in books and articles. Both in conversation and in his writings, Wagner had a persistent habit of presenting the ideas he had picked up from other people, as if they were his own, and without attribution. This has led to attacks on Wagner for his opinions, especially those he expressed in his late essays, when those opinions often were not his own but something said or written by someone else. It might be said that if Wagner wrote something he must have agreed with it, even if it was not his own opinion; but that is not always the case. Sometimes, especially when he read something that he did not understand, he was inspired to new and often strange ideas; but his thinking was dominated by an obsessive need to connect. He would read several books or articles on unrelated topics, and make connections between their content. For example, in his essay The Wibelungen he makes a fantastic concoction involving the Holy Grail, the Nibelung Hoard and Italian history (Nibelungs=Wibelungs=Ghibellines) that might make your head spin. In the same essay, he identifies Siegfried, as the supposed ancestor of the German people, with Christ (PW 7:287,289). Wagner, in this early essay and later elsewhere, is not just taking myths that already exist and developing them but he is also creating new myths, often using traditional elements. Ulrike Kienzle, in her essay Parsifal and Religion, notes that the philosopher Hans Blumenberg coined the phrase \"work on myth\" [Arbeit om Mythos] to describe this process. In Wagner's mind, it seems, nothing was compartmentalised. He was able to connect ideas and concepts across what normally would be the boundaries of philosophy, aesthetics, science, history and religion. His thinking did not proceed along lines of reason or logic but by association. This makes his writings sometimes difficult to follow and therefore easily misunderstood.\n\nThe young Wagner wanted to write operas (and music in other genres) and he decided to write his own libretti. He wanted to have full control over these works in which music, words and dramatic action would be integrated. His earliest attempts were conventional and, as he later admitted, musically in imitation of established composers, before he had developed his own style and approach. So he wrote a fairy opera with a conventional \"boy meets strange girl\" plot, then a comedy based on a story by Shakespeare, and then attempted to compose a Grand Opera with which he hoped for success in Paris. Then he took a new approach but in the tradition of German Romantic Opera established by Weber and Lortzing, with his opera about The Flying Dutchman. At the centre of the work is a character who is under a curse (which is a common idea in 19th century opera) but also in an existential predicament. The effect of this curse is that the Dutchman cannot die until he finds a woman who will give him her unconditional love. The Dutchman is the first of several characters in Wagner's operas who has brought about a situation that they cannot resolve. The Dutchman made a blasphemous oath and so he was cursed to wander the seas of the world with his ship and ghostly crew. Kundry, in Wagner's final opera, laughed at Jesus (or at least this is implied in the text) and so she was cursed to wander the earth until she meets a man who can resist her seduction.\n\nAnother character who cannot find rest is Wotan, in the Ring, who rises to the tragic heights of willing his own destruction. These figures are unusual even for the operatic stage and their problems are quite different from conventional operas where the action revolves around good guys versus bad guys, and whether the hero will get the girl. Wagner's libretti depart from convention with their duets and monologues about death and salvation. His characters are sometimes in existential situations from which they seek redemption. And so the language becomes increasing \"religious\". Sometimes we can see that the character needs to find a way out of his or her predicament, for example that the Dutchman has to find a girl who will sacrifice herself to save him, or that Kundry has to find a redeemer so that she can escape from her cycle of rebirths. In other cases it is far from obvious what kind of salvation is needed: for example, when BrÃ¼nnhilde says to Siegfried, Ewig war ich ... doch ewig zu deinem Heil!. In Parsifal it becomes even more complicated, with both Kundry and Amfortas in existential distress, and an entire community also in distress. Kundry brings a balsam from far away: Hilft der Balsam nicht, Arabien birgt dann nichts mehr zu seinem Heil. Is she only talking about healing his wound, or is she concerned for his salvation?\n\nAnyone who starts to think about the words of these operas will find that there are some difficult questions. For example: does Wagner have some deeper meaning, or agenda, about politics or religion, that underlies his text? Or is he only trying to push our buttons, perhaps to make us think about our own salvation? Is Wagner being deliberately ambiguous and obscure, in the hope of provoking his audience to think about and discuss his text? In the early 1850's he said that he did not want to be obvious, which does not mean (as some of the more hostile of his critics have claimed) that there is a sinister hidden subtext. It is more a case of not wanting to be superficial. Wagner was not writing kitchen-sink drama or soap opera, although you might think it from some modern productions. He was aiming for epic drama in the spirit of Greek tragedy, as staged in Athens in the context of religious festivals. Indeed, he called the Ring and Parsifal \"festival plays\", not intended for the theatre repertory but rather to be staged in a festival of music and drama. Although Wagner's operas became progressively more ambiguous and difficult to understand, it is clear that he wanted to be understood, and so he tried to explain himself, for example in A Communication to My Friends. As usual with Wagner, here is a contradiction: an artist who has decided to be obscure and ambiguous also wanted his work to be understood.\n\nAlthough Richard Wagner was not a philosopher, he was very interested in philosophy, and in the 1840's he was engaging with the works of Hegel and Feuerbach. Despite what some people believe, neither was Wagner a theologian, and he never seriously engaged with theology, except with Feuerbach's writings on this subject (or to be more correct, on the anthropology of religion). He read the New Testament, which interested him, and at least parts of the Old Testament before declaring it \"rubbish\". In his thinking about religion Wagner was influenced by what he had read about philosophy, and especially that of Feuerbach, who was the formative influence concerning the philosophy of religion. Although later he would read and re-read Schopenhauer, whose ideas came to dominate Wagner's understanding in the areas of metaphysics and of ethics, his religious ideas as derived from Feuerbach were little modified by his reading of Schopenhauer.\n\nNot only do his operas, starting in the late 1840's, use religious language and religious symbols but they are increasingly concerned with spiritual problems. TannhÃ¤user cannot choose between profane love or spiritual love: part of him wants to be reading the scriptures with Elisabeth, while part of him wants to be in bed with Venus. Lohengrin is a kind of divinity who descends to earth from the most intellectual heights in answer to the distress of Elsa: if he intends to bring salvation then he fails. The Ring presents a kind of religious evolution from a world ruled by anthropomorphic gods to, in the end, a world without gods. The gods of the Ring refer to themselves as \"eternal\" but the Earth Goddess, Erda, rises up out of the ground to correct them: all that is, ends she says. Including a race of gods. The paradoxical exception is Die Meistersinger: although its first act takes place in a church, and the cast are singing about St. John baptising in the Jordan. But in spite of all of the hymns and rituals, this opera is not about religion at all: the child that is baptised is Walther's song, which is the focus of the opera: the subject is the creation and reception of a work of art.\n\nWagner and Christianity\n\nWagner did not believe in a Creator God. At least, not in the sense that some higher being had created this world and all beings in it. If some higher being or impersonal force was creating anything, then it was through an ongoing process of continual change, which for Wagner usually involved revolution. He said to Cosima that he did not believe in God but in divinity (or godliness), as revealed in a Jesus without sin. His personal version of Christianity was not so much about God as about Jesus, whose divinity was not in doubt. For Wagner, the important aspect of Jesus was that of his free-willed suffering. In some mystical way, the blood of Jesus was divine compassion. Wagner's ideas about the world and its creation were formed by his reading of Schopenhauer and Darwin. The world came into existence and evolved, and continues to evolve, through the action of the Will, as described by the philosopher. The Will might be thought of as an impersonal force, although it is probably more accurate to think of it as an organising principle. It is something that drives the universe, organising inorganic matter to form galaxies, stars and planets, then organic life forms through mechanisms that had been described by Darwin, and eventually achieving consiousness. All of this was achieved not by the hands of a Creator God but through processes driven by the Will; which is not something to be worshipped because it has created a world in which there is suffering. The Will, or Nature, is not malevolent but, as an impersonal agent, it does not care about individual beings, who are perhaps only means to an end that we cannot understand.\n\nWhen the time came, young Wagner was confirmed in a church. It was his first religious experience and apparently he was overwhelmed by it. It did not, however, turn him into a churchgoer: he was more spiritual than religious in any conventional sense. Neither did he start writing church music. The nearest he came to it was in his cantata The Love Feast of the Apostles. It is not one of his most successful works and it has the appearance of something that he wrote in a hurry. There was to be a gathering of German choral societies in Dresden, and Wagner had the opportunity to write something for massed choirs. Unfortunately he did not have the time to write fancy counterpoint, and perhaps at that time lacked the skill, so the piece is plain and simple. Another work on a religious theme but one that Wagner never completed was his Jesus of Nazareth. It is not clear whether this was intended as an opera or perhaps as a play with incidental music: there is one surviving sketch for a melody. But this piece could not be called a \"religious drama\": the text, which survives as Prose Draft, portrays Jesus as a reformer with socialist tendencies. Something closer to Jesus Christ Superstar than to a Bach Passion. Princess Metternich read the draft and advised Wagner to leave it alone.\n\nLudwig Feuerbach: Love and Death\n\nWe must learn to die, and to die in the fullest sense of the word. The fear of the end is the source of all lovelessness. — Richard Wagner to August RÃ¶ckel, 25-26 January 1854.\n\nThis quotation reveals how Wagner, newly settled in Zurich, had embraced the ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. According to his autobiography, Wagner had first heard of Feuerbach from a revolutionary with a big hat, called Metzdorf. But Ulrike Kienzle suggests that it was Wagner's Jewish friend Samuel Lehrs who showed him a book entitled Todesgedanken (Thoughts on Death), then published anonymously but which was later republished in the name of Feuerbach, and entitled Thoughts on Death and Immortality. Regardless of how Wagner came to know of Feuerbach, it is clear that soon after his arrival in Zurich, Wagner made a serious study of Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity, a work that made a deep and lasting impression upon him.\n\nAround 1840, the left wing of Hegel's students, and others influenced by Hegel, had become hostile to the dominant religion and the existing state in France and the German-speaking countries. They became known as the Young Hegelians and among them was Ludwig Feuerbach (1804-1872), who moved from a position of Hegel's idealism to materialism (a move that would be followed by some of his admirers, including Marx and Engels). Feuerbach criticized the idealism of Hegel and redefined religion in general, and Christianity in particular, from a humanistic perspective. Rejecting the supernatural, Feuerbach held that nothing existed except Man and Nature. We are products of Nature, he says, and the higher beings that our religious fantasies have constructed are nothing but reflections of our own individual existence. Rather than thinking in terms of communion with higher beings, Feuerbach argued that it was relations between humans that were important: reason, co-operation and mutual understanding would demonstrate that the relationship between self and other, I-and-thou, is fundamental.\n\nEngels wrote, concerning The Essence of Christianity: We were all, for the time being, Feuerbachians. ... The very faults of Feuerbach's book contributed to its immediate success. Its literary, imposing, even bombastic style secured for it a very large public, and was a constant relief after the long years of abstract and abstruse Hegelianism. The same thing was true of its extravagant glorification of love, which when compared with the insufferable sovereignty of pure reason was easy to excuse if not to justify. Soon after his wife Minna had joined him in Zurich, Wagner says that he was relatively at peace, able to surrender completely to the inner excitement nourished in me by my acquaintance with the principal work of Ludwig Feuerbach ... So when he completed his next book, Wagner gave it the title, The Work of Art of the Future, one that echoed Feuerbach's The Principles and Philosophy of the Future, indicating that Wagner was addressing the role of art in a Feuerbachian context. At least in his earlier writings, Feuerbach made no distinction between God and Nature: so when Wagner said to Cosima that, for him, God was Nature, perhaps he was recalling something Feuerbach had written. For Feuerbach, God existed, in a kind of pantheistic sense: in the real world and in history but definitely not \"up there\" or \"out there\".\n\nWagner absorbed Feuerbach's doctrine that, rather than mankind being created by gods, mankind had created its gods. Religion is for Feuerbach entirely an invention of the human mind, and it has been invented because religion meets basic human needs. If we analyse religion properly, that analysis will not reveal anything about God or about gods, but it will reveal fundamental truths about ourselves. For example, that we do not feel in control of our own lives, or of the world around us, so we need to seek help from superhuman beings who have the power to control the world, or aspects of it. In archaic religion and in classical times, prayers and sacrifices were offered to anthropomorphic gods, who resembled human beings with all their traits, good and bad. Gods of this kind feature in the earlier parts of Wagner's Ring Cycle. As the cycle progresses, human beings gradually escape from their dependence on the gods, and one of the gods becomes human for the purpose, apparently, of redeeming the world (as we are told by Waltraute). Incidentally, the fact that Wagner made extensive use of Old Icelandic Eddas and Sagas as a source of stories does not mean that he is working in a framework of one specific culture and its religion. It has been observed that his characters Wotan and Fricka are more like Zeus and Hera, in terms of their relationship, than they resemble Odinn and Frigg. Probably we should regard these and other characters only as generic examples of anthropomorphic gods. The key point in relation to the Ring Cycle is that it begins with the gods (more or less) in control of events, and that it ends with no gods at all. In the so-called \"Feuerbach ending\", the cycle ends with BrÃ¼nnhilde declaring that there are no more gods, no more rulers, and all that remains is love.\n\nAnd so, at least until he discovered Schopenhauer in 1854, Wagner was a Feuerbachian. Even after he had become a disciple of Schopenhauer, he remained Feuerbachian with regard to the philosophy of religion, because this was not a subject of primary interest to Schopenhauer. For Schopenhauer, religion (and especially the western religions that had begun life in the Middle East) was a muddle, that only occasionally stumbled upon the truth. Schopenhauer had more time for eastern religions such as Buddhism and the Vedic/Vedantic teachings of the Brahmins; indeed, he seems independently to have discovered the Four Noble Truths that were taught by the Buddha. Wagner would, sooner or later, investigate everything that had been recommended by Schopenhauer, from novels to books and articles about religion, mainly concerning religions of the Far East.\n\nJesus von Nazareth\n\nIn 1887 an early work by Richard Wagner, his Jesus of Nazareth, was published by his son Siegfried. In addition to the \"prose sketch\" (Dichterischer Entwurf) there was a set of notes in which we might follow the ideas that Wagner intended to develop in his treatment of this subject, together with passages copied from the New Testament. William Ashton Ellis, who made an English translation of this entire material, thought that it was not intended for a musical setting. His view might have changed had he known that there was a musical sketch apparently intended for the scene in which Jesus preaches from a boat (see WWV page 339). Wagner did not describe Jesus of Nazareth as an opera and it is possible that he had intended it as a play with incidental music.\n\nThe prose sketch follows relevant parts of the Gospels with the addition of scenes such as that in which Jesus explains his mission to his mother and to Mary Magdalen. Jesus will bring salvation to all mankind. He is not the \"king of the Jews\" that Barabbas and Judas are looking for, so not a leader who will make Judea great again. The people are hailing Jesus as a royal descendant of David but he calls himself a Son of God and a descendant of Adam: so are all men his brothers. Richard H. Bell, who has examined closely Wagner's copy of the New Testament, in his essay on Siegfried Act III scene i notes that one of the passages cited in Jesus of Nazareth is Romans 5:18, which Wagner has doubly marked in his NT. This verse concerns Christ as a second Adam, who has undone the effects of the Fall. Christ's message, according to Wagner, is that we shall love each other, also that God is within us, rather than \"out there\". This is consistent with Wagner's belief that men are enlightened by a light from within, not from outside this world. In his later private statements on religion, Wagner held that Jesus was divine, both Son of God and Son of Man, although these statements might be interpreted in different ways. H.S. Chamberlain (in his biography of Wagner) characterised Jesus of Nazareth as, eine Verherrlichung der gÃ¶ttlichen Person des ErlÃ¶sers. If not already in 1848-9, Wagner would later accept that the divinity of Jesus (in the sense that he was the perfect human being) was the firmest possible foundation for Christianity.\n\nIf not already made clear in the prose sketch, the accompanying notes (AusfÃ¼hrungen) show that Wagner's thinking about religion had been influenced primarily by Ludwig Feuerbach's Thoughts on Death and Immortality. It is possible but not necessary to assume that Wagner had also read other works by Feuerbach, at the time of writing his sketch for Jesus of Nazareth. The Jesus portrayed by Wagner sometimes uses the language of the Gospels but at other times sounds more like a true Feuerbachian, speaking of the importance of love rather than about the need for faith. In the notes there are other left-Hegelian ideas, perhaps influenced by Proudhon: Wagner condemns both the institution of marriage, and loveless marriage in particular, and the right of property. It seems that this Jesus not only teaches that love is above the Jewish Law but also against laws in general. William Ashton Ellis suggested that this second section was written after Art and Revolution but before The Art-Work of the Future. At this time, of course, Wagner was under the influence of Mikhail Bakunin, anarchist and revolutionary. Despite this, Wagner's Jesus is not the revolutionary leader that the zealots were looking for, and he does not preach revolution. The third part of the publication consists of citations (Citate). These are short extracts from the New Testament, selected by Wagner as material from which to construct his drama, assigned variously to its five acts. Wagner used the 1545 revision of Luther's German New Testament.\n\nMary Magdalen plays a prominent role in the prose sketch. Wagner follows Catholic tradition in conflating her both with the woman accused of adultery and with Mary of Bethany. This might be only so as to avoid introducing new characters into the drama. Mary Magdalen is involved in some scenes, such as the feeding of the multitude and the Last Supper, where she had not been mentioned in the biblical sources.\n\nOn 19 November 1849, Wagner wrote to Ferdinand Heine that he intended to elaborate his sketch for Jesus of Nazareth, and hoped to persuade the librettist Gustave VaÃ«z to collaborate in the project. This was presumably in the hope of shaping an opera for Paris, which might explain the five act structure of the sketch. Almost one year later, he wrote to Theodor Uhlig that he wanted nothing more to do with Paris and hoped that the next revolution would burn the city to the ground. In his article A Communication to my Friends of 1851, Wagner does not describe his Jesus of Nazareth in Feurbachian terms but only as a protest against materialism and lovelessness. As with other reflections Wagner made in this article on his past output, what he says about this drama in A Communication should be taken with a good pinch of salt. He seems to be trying to avoid admitting that he had lost interest in this drama.\n\nShakyamuni\n\nWe have seen that Wagner sketched a drama about a significant religious figure, Jesus of Nazareth. Later he would turn to another religious teacher, the Buddha Shakyamuni1, or Siddharta Gautama. Although there are many traditions about the Buddha, even his date of birth is much disputed. By tradition he lived and taught during the 6th century BCE. Schopenhauer became interested in the teachings attributed to the Buddha and found there much that agreed with his own philosophy. In his World as Will and Representation, Schopenhauer sometimes discusses the teachings of Buddhism and contrasts it with the doctrines of the Brahmins. He gets confused, however, because his main source was the Oupnek'hat, a version of the Upanishads that Anquetil Duperron had translated (initially into Latin) from Persian. Unfortunately this text does not clearly distinguish between the Upanishads themselves and a Buddhist gloss on them, so it presents Vedic ideas through a Buddhist layer of commentary. This was almost certainly the cause of the philosopher's difficulty in separating Hindu (Brahmin) from Buddhist doctrines.\n\nEarly in the 19th century there were not many texts available, whether in Latin or in modern European languages, about eastern religions. Schopenhauer was able to obtain and study what was available, at first mostly in French and published by the St. Petersburg Academy. The first substantial account of Buddhism, although mostly about Mahayana, was EugÃ¨ne Burnouf's Introduction Ã l'histoire du Buddhisme of 1844 (EugÃ¨ne and not his brother Emile: they are sometimes confused with each other). In this book he discussed, with translations of some passages, Sanskrit texts that had been collected by Hodgson in Nepal. Burnouf had intended, in a second volume, to discuss Pali texts from Ceylon but he only managed to complete this first volume. Wagner owned copies of two other works by EugÃ¨ne Burnouf: his translations of the Bhagavad-GÃ®tÃ¢ and of one of books received from Nepal (the only one that Burnouf completely translated) Le lotus de la bonne loi (The Lotus of the Good Law). A decade later, Schopenhauer was able to read about the southern traditions, such as the account of Buddhism in Ceylon by Spence Hardy, Manual of Buddhism of 1853, and then in Carl Friedrich KÃ¶ppen's Die Religion des Buddha of 1857. In his book Ãber den Willen in der Natur (On the Will in Nature), Schopenhauer provided a reading list of available books about Buddhism, including those mentioned above (\"Sinologie\", pp.461-2). Wagner found some of these books and articles in Zurich and later elsewhere. He almost certainly read those that were in French or German but perhaps not so much of those in English.\n\nAlthough Wagner, like Schopenhauer, was able to read about Buddhism in India, Nepal, Ceylon, Tibet, Japan and elsewhere in the Far East, he probably did not have access to a detailed account of the life of Shakyamuni. The English translation of Buddha-karita by E.B Cowell, from Sanskrit, would not be published until 1894; the English translation of the Lalitaravistara-Sutra by Rajendralal Mitra in 1881 and its French translation by Ãdouard Foucaux in 1892. Yet Wagner was able to read some accounts of the Buddha, from which he gained a general idea of his life and teachings. This led Wagner to conceive an opera in which Shakyamuni would be the central figure. The prose sketch or outline survives, dated 16 May 1856. Normally this would have been developed further into a Prose Draft, as Wagner did with Tristan, but there is no evidence that he did so. The story was taken from Burnouf and, in its original form, of which only part was included in his book, was told for the purpose of showing the Buddha preaching against the caste system. But Wagner was interested in it because it dealt with reincarnation.\n\nIn this story the Buddha is close to completing his progress towards full and unsurpassed enlightment. As he is well advanced on the Path, the Buddha is able to see the past lives of people, and in this case he sees an earlier life of the Chandala (outcast) maiden. In which she, as the daughter of a Brahmin, had rejected with mocking laughter the love offered by a Chandala. For this she herself has been reborn as an outcast. (It is not her father, as some authors have claimed, missing the entire point, but the girl who rejects the suitor). Shakyamuni's cousin Ananda has falled in love with the girl and she with him. After questioning the girl, Shakyamuni agrees to admit her into his community, as the first Buddhist nun. Perhaps as a result of his great compassion for the girl, the last load is lifted from the head of Shakyamuni, who leaves for the place of his enlightenment. This scene is interesting for its similarity with Parsifal and Kundry in the last act of Wagner's final opera.\n\nFor many years, Die Sieger (The Victors) remained on Wagner's list of planned projects. On 6 January 1865 he wrote to King Ludwig with a programme of productions intended for Munich, some to be staged in the Court Theatre and later some in the proposed Wagner Theatre. Die Sieger is listed as a work to be staged there in August 1870 and repeated in later seasons. So as things stood early in 1865, Wagner expected to have the new opera finished and ready for rehearsals in 1870. Although there was perhaps still no Prose Draft, Wagner had developed his ideas about the portrayal of Shakyamuni, and there is at least one sketch of a musical motive that Cosima said had been intended for the Buddha (CT 20.07.1878). Wagner had decided to use this theme in his Siegfried at Sangst du nicht, dein Wissen, replacing the one he had originally written in the sketches. This is the motive that Wolzogen would label as Welterbschaft.\n\nAfter Mathilde Wesendonck had heard Parsifal, she told Wagner that she would have preferred nirvana, that is, his Buddhist opera. She went on to write her own verse legend about Shakyamuni and his cousin Devadatta, entitled Unter schatt'gen Mango-Baumen. One of the excuses that Wagner made to Cosima for not composing Die Sieger was that he did not know enough about lotus blossoms and mango trees. In other words, he was more comfortable with familiar locations. This confirms that his interest in the subject had not been driven by the possibility of exotic settings.\n\nJonathan Harvey's opera for a small cast of singers and 22 musicians with electronics, Wagner Dream, shows Wagner in 1883 still thinking about Die Sieger. It presents short scenes, as imagined by Harvey, from the opera that Wagner never wrote.\n\nWagner and Historicism\n\nOne of the ideas that Wagner picked up while reading (and struggling to understand) Hegel was that history was cyclical. According to Hegel, history proceeded in cycles, each of them raising mankind to a new level. Each cycle was initiated by a world-historical hero, such as Julius Caesar. Wagner almost certainly recalled this idea when he was reading about the history of religions. In particular, there is a pattern in monasticism, in which communities turn inward and close themselves, only to be renewed by reformers who open them again. In general, Wagner was interested in myth and not in history, which was for him only the instantiation of myths. When he writes about history, Wagner muddles the details because he does not care about them, only about the mythic patterns. History repeats itself, following the same patterns over and over again, but with new sages, saints and heroes. Although Wagner wrote several operas on historical subjects, and drafted scenarios for many others, his \"historical operas\" are not really historical. In TannhÃ¤user he was working with material about two legendary heroes, Heinrich and TannhÃ¤user, whose originally separate legends he blended into one. In Lohengrin at least some of the characters are historical but the events are legendary: Wagner is concerned not with the history of Brabant but with a mythic conflict between Christianity and remnants of pagan religion. In Die Meistersinger, although the poet Hans Sachs is a historical figure of some importance to German history, the action takes place in a Nuremberg that never existed: although the opera does contain many details of the Master Singers Guild that are accurate and authentic.\n\nParsifal the Redeemer\n\nWagner's last opera presents us with a troubled religious community and a sheltered youth, who seems foolish in his ignorance of everything from weapons to religion. This religious community is a band of knights whom the pious Titurel has gathered around him to protect certain religious relics. If not actually pagan, these knights are heretics of some kind, perhaps intended to represent Cathars or Gnostics. Their Temple is hidden in a forest on a mountain (Monsalvat) somewhere on the border of the Christian world, near to pagans or heathens living on the other side of the mountain range. The community live together in a kind of ashram, similar to the forest ashram described in the Ramayana (Sanskrit: à¤°à¤¾à¤®à¤¾à¤¯à¤£à¤®à¥), where creatures are sacred and protected. Their doctrines too are liminal: already in the first scene, Gurnemanz reveals that he believes in reincarnation, saying that perhaps Kundry is doing penance for sins she committed in earlier lives. All of this seems to be closer to the Indian religious world than to anything like mainstream Christianity. This religious community is in a crisis of leadership, after their priest-king stopped believing in himself. Like historical monastic communities, it has turned inward, hiding away from the world in the pathless forest. Amfortas has forbidden the knights to venture outside for fear of the evil sorcerer over the mountains. There are other issues too: now that the knights cannot leave, they must remain celibate. Wagner creates a symmetrical situation: on one side of the mountains, unnaturally chaste men; on the other side of the mountain, naturally unchaste maidens in Klingsor's magic garden.\n\nIn the Good Friday meadow, Parsifal asks whether flowers can find redemption: this might be seen as a reference to Gnostic Christianity or even to Zen Buddhism. Wagner most likely did not know much about Zen, although he might have read something about its origins in China or its roots in Indian Mahayana: what we know that he read about Buddhism was mostly concerning its early development in India and Nepal. Although there are many references to the Redeemer, and in both the second and third acts to the Crucifixion, what it is that the community believe about redemption or salvation is never explained. When Parsifal returns to the community, after many years of wandering, he finds that Gurnemanz has become \"a foolish old man\", who drifts off into pious gibberish during the Good Friday music. In Wagner's version of Christianity, there was no resurrection or ascension of Jesus, the sinless sufferer, but the Saviour left as his continuing presence in our world these relics. It is implied that Jesus (who is not mentioned by name) is present in the Holy Grail and that it is his redeeming blood that drips from the Spear. To give even more offence to Christian believers in the audience, there is a kind of communion ceremony presented on stage, with the Grail King as celebrant, in which blood is turned into wine and bread. But for Wagner these details were not very important: he was recycling religious myths and symbols for their figurative value. The important thing about the \"Grail scene\" of the first act is that the sheltered youth, who has stumbled upon this religious cult hidden deep in a pathless forest, is that the boy does not understand what he sees in the Temple. He does not understand the strange religious ceremony, neither does he know what is wrong with the Grail King, although the boy experiences a feeling of compassion for his suffering. It is hardly surprising that Gurnemanz kicks the boy out of the door, telling him to go chase geese.\n\nRebirth and Reincarnation\n\nWagner wrote that only music could describe the mysteries of reincarnation. He intended to explore this in his \"Buddhist\" opera Die Sieger (The Victors), which unfortunately he never completed. He had understood that the doctrines of eastern religions are subtle: they are sometimes difficult to convey in words, even where there is a common language, and much is lost in translation where there is not. Buddhism in particular makes use of analogies. The life of the apparent individual is like a flame, they say, that burns on one candle but, as that candle is burned away, may be transferred to another candle, and so on. Eventually the flame is extinguished. The Sanskrit word for extinction is nirvana (Pali: nibbana). Wagner obtained his ideas about Buddhism and other eastern religions from Schopenhauer, who had not understood these concepts. Buddhist ideas are often subtle and one lifetime is not enough to comprehend them. Like many of the western interpreters of Buddhism (see Welbon for details), Schopenhauer (and so too Wagner) thought of extinction as the end, and of nirvana as \"the land of non-being\". But in Buddhist doctrine nirvana is a state of being, not a state of non-being. The something that can be transferred from one candle to another remains even after the flame has gone out, and that something is able to enter into a state of existence called nirvana. Of course, the Buddhists do not believe in anything like a \"soul\" and the Buddha explicitly preached against the existence of an atman (self), in which the Brahmins believed. In Brahmanism the atman can be reborn; in Buddhism there is no self, so it is hard for a westerner to understand what can be reincarnated in the Buddhist sense. What is clear is that something is reincarnated, for example because a saint following the Bodhisattva Path must follow it through many lives (in the most common doctrine) before she achieves all of the perfections. At which point the saint is ready to enter into nirvana but does not do so, because they have made a vow not to enter nirvana before all sentient beings have been enlightened. These are, indeed, subtle doctrines and next to impossible for a westerner, familiar only with the doctrines of the western religions, to comprehend. Schopenhauer seems to have believed in reincarnation, although he was not exactly sure what kind of reincarnation he should believe in; Wagner followed Schopenhauer in having only a vague idea of what was meant by reincarnation in Buddhist doctrine. Schopenhauer at least initially thought of it in relation to Greek (Pythagorean) ideas but suspected that Buddhist doctrine was subtly different.\n\nGfrÃ¶rer and Renan\n\nIn the 1870's Wagner's extensive reading material included works by August Friedrich GfrÃ¶rer and Ernest Renan. Through GfrÃ¶rer's study of early Christianity, Geschichte des Urchristentums, which he read in 1874-5, Wagner became acquainted with Jewish mysticism and the Kabbala. GfrÃ¶rer also helped Wagner to refine his ideas about the divinity of Christ, which he now thought of as \"the will to redemption\". For Wagner, Christ becomes the embodiment of free-willed suffering and the source of divine compassion poured on all of mankind. Wagner also read Ernest Renan's The Life of Jesus, one of the first books in which the author tried to portray the historical Jesus, as distinct from the Jesus of Church tradition. As Wagner wrote to Hans von BÃ¼low in 1880, he sought a Jesus who had been cleansed2 and redeemed of the distortion that has been caused by Alexandrine, Judaic and Roman despotism. To say nothing of the Gospels, which Wagner held to be misleading, since the disciples had not understood what they had been taught by Jesus (PW8:p.393). Wagner thought that he knew what Jesus had been saying, although he had not been there to hear it.\n\nTrue Christianity\n\nIn his later writings (and in Opera and Drama where he discusses music and the Church), Wagner sometimes refers to Christianity. These references need to be treated with some care, since they are often ambiguous or misleading. Wagner did not like mainstream Christianity: he was extremely anti-clerical, scorning priests and parsons, and hostile to Jesuits. Christianity, he declared, had been a necessary error (PW8:p.350). Wagner thought that we can know almost nothing of the teachings of religious reformers from ancient times because those teachings had been badly recorded, often long after the teacher had departed this world. Wagner wrote that there was a kernel of religious truth that the saints and sages (including the Buddha, Pythagoras, Socrates, Jesus and Meister Eckhart) had taught in common 3. That kernel of religious truth contained everything that was really important: he called it True Christianity. So when Wagner wrote to his patron King Ludwig that his new opera would be \"Christian\", he could do so in good conscience, knowing that it would be \"Christian\" in the sense of \"True Christianity\", while not Christian in the sense that Ludwig would have expected it. This was disingenuous, if not downright dishonest, because the kernel of religious truth was only a concept: neither Wagner nor anyone else could say what was common in the teachings of the saints and sages. Yes, in some way, Wagner's Parsifal would embody True Christianity, a religion of compassion.\n\nSelected References and Further Reading\n\nWagner literature is vast and diverse. This list has been limited to those works that are of most relevance to the present topic, with an emphasis on the religious and philosophical aspects of Wagner's life and works; together with texts concerning religion and spirituality studied either by Wagner or Schopenhauer.\n\n1.

He is regarded by modern Buddhists as one of many Buddhas who have preached in various worlds and in different ages. Some Buddhist texts speak of him as the seventh in a succession of Buddhas who have preached in this world. There is no evidence, however, that any Buddhist texts or traditions were in existence before the time of Shakyamuni.\n\nFootnote 2: Here Wagner echoes Schopenhauer's attempt to separate \"authentic\" Christianity from what he called relics of the Old Testament and the accretion of misguided dogma.\n\nFootnote 3: Here Wagner is expanding on Schopenhauer's statement that Meister Eckhart and the Buddha had taught the same things. His statement does not stand up to close examination, since for the big questions (the existence of a creator God, the nature of the soul), the teachings of these sages are very different. Whilst it might be said that the teachings of these and other \"saints and sages\" sometimes appear similar, usually the similarities are less important than the differences."
