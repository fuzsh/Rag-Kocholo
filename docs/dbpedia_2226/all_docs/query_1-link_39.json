        "text": "Leadership\n\nWeek One*\n\nIntroduction to Transitional Ministry\n\n*Offered in person at Montreat and online during the program\n\nWeek 1 is for pastors or congregational leaders serving or considering serving congregations in the midst of transitions in leadership, culture, context, and ministry. You will be introduced to best practices in transitional ministry:\n\nEntering the congregation and community\n\nGetting to know the church and community.\n\nIdentifying the congregation’s strength and growing edges\n\nAssuming responsibility for assisting the congregation in moving toward a vibrant future\n\nLeaving the congregation in a healthy and appropriate way\n\nNote: if you have a spouse, consider inviting them to join you for this week and to participate in the spouse track. Click on the “spouse track” tab for more information.\n\nWe know that a number of participants attend this event as part of the discernment process to help know if God is calling them to this ministry. We also know that a number of participants attend this program because it’s just good continuing education, and you learn a lot of things that will help you wherever your ministry takes you.\n\nWeek Two\n\nThe Practice of Transitional Ministry\n\nNote: Week Two will only be offered to on-site participants\n\nWeek 2 is tailored for those wanting to learn more and focus on improving their own leadership skills, especially in the context of transition.\n\nFor pastors and leaders serving in congregations and faith communities in the midst of transitions in leadership, culture, context, and ministry. Participants will use their current ministry context to reflect on the leader’s role and tasks in times of transition. Attending this week will provide an opportunity for going deeper into the work introduced in week I and beginning to understand our role as leaders in contexts of change and transition. Registration is limited and there are several homework assignments to prepare for Week II, so early registration is advised.\n\nREQUIRED: Completion of Week 1, ordinarily between six months and six years prior (or by prior approval of the faculty team leader) and the completion of assignments provided upon registration.\n\n.\n\nSpouse Track\n\nNote: The Spouse Track will only be offered to on-site participants\n\nThis course is designed for individuals whose spouse may be considering or engaged in transitional ministry. Spouses learn in a retreat-like atmosphere with opportunities to understand the basics of transitional ministry while also providing ample free time to hike, read, and relax. Led by Annette DeBeer.\n\nA special note from Annette DeBeer, leader of the 2022 and 2023 spouse track at Montreat:\n\nFriend, if your Spouse is considering entering into Transitional Ministry/ is already in a Congregation going through Transitions, this message is for YOU!\n\nI attended the Spouse Track in 2014, before my husband entered into Transitional Ministry, and I will be forever grateful that I did. Transitional Ministry is specialized and intentional, it is not to keep a seat warm! And for this reason, it is important to know how and where you as Spouse can help/ support your Pastor Spouse in the Congregation. The Spouse Track covers a broad spectrum of topics. And there are also opportunities to attend sessions with your Spouse, especially topics that are not covered/partly covered in the Spouse Track. It is wonderful to meet in a beautiful setting to learn, share, and enjoy fellowship. You will, of course, have free time too! You are not alone - this is your chance to be part of a great Ministry.\n\nRegistration and Accommodations\n\nRegistration Procedure\n\nEach seminar has limited enrollment. Please register early.
