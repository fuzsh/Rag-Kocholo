        "text": "‘Jack’ Whicher was one of eight members of the newly formed London Metropolitan Police, Detective Branch in 1842, and the inspiration for Dickens’ Inspector Bucket. Whicher was later to be the subject of a book in 2008 and a TV Series.\n\nIt was Today in 1860 that the Wiltshire, England, Magistrates succumbed to public pressure and wrote to the Home Secretary asking that a detective officer be sent to investigate a murder in Road [Rode]. They sent 45 years old Detective Inspector Whicher.(1)\n\nIt was a 19th century cause-celebre, when the well-to-do 16 years old Constance Kent, was charged with the murder of her half-brother, Francis Saville Kent, whose body was found in the outside privy. It also raised the question as to the Priest-Confessor status in the Law of England.\n\nHowever the case remained unsolved by the great detective, and at the July 1865 trial, Constance pleaded guilty. It appears she had confessed to the Anglo-Catholic Priest Rev. Arthur Wagner of St Paul’s Brighton, who refused to reveal the secrets of the confessional in the Magistrates Court, but though later charged with Contempt of Court this was never carried out. (2)\n\nLater Lord Chancellor Richard Bethel, 1st Baron Westbury, declared that no priest, Anglican or Roman has the right to remain silent in justice. In effect explaining that Canon 113 of 1603 simply meant that clergy must not ex mero motu (on impulse) reveal confidences voluntarily and without legal obligation.\n\nThe case had received much publicity and outcry, through the newspapers, as much to do with the Anglo-Catholic use of the ‘confessional’ as anything else. It resulted in Wagner being vilified and he and his curates were attacked physically by the ‘roughs’ in the streets of Brighton for not revealing the name of his confessor.\n\nConstance it appears had also donated money to Wagner’s churches, which caused another rumpus and ‘scurrilious’ scribbling on walls.(3)\n\nOne bishop who opposed the judgement was the outspoken Bishop Phillpots of Exeter who supporting Wagner, said it went against Canon Law as expressed in the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) ‘Visitation of the Sick’, and sanctified in the 1662 Act of Uniformity where confession of the very sick is received by the priest.\n\nIn any event Kent, charged with murder, escaped the noose owing to her age, served a sentence at Millbank Prison, and emigrated to Australia where she died at 100 in 1944.\n\n(1) Jonathan ‘Jack’Whicher 1.10.1814-29.6.1881, was subject of the Kate Summerscales’ The Suspicions of Mr Whicher.\n\nThe Chief Constable at the time was Capt. Samuel Meredith RN, who was not consulted about the decision to bring in Scotland Yard.\n\n(2) Wagner (1824-1902), built four or five churches in the poor areas of Brighton and being an Anglo-Catholic would have used the sacrament of confession and other sacraments, much frowned on at the time in fact many of his fellow clergy were imprisoned under the Church Worship Act of 1874?\n\nOf the churches which Wagner had built St Bartholemew’s was described by Pevsner as :One of the most tremendous 19thc churches in the world’.(1). Ian Nairn a previous editor described it as ‘the most moving’ of Sussex churches. The architect was the local Edmund Scott, not one of the famous Scott clan.\n\n(3) They scribbled on Wagner’s walls: Who stole the gal’s money?’\n\nRef: In the noise and glitter of cheerful Brighton, this great church is a tall sanctuary of peace, Betjeman(1) Pevsner s Buildings of England series Sussex:East.\n\nRef: wikipedia.org/constancekent\n\nRef: Constance Kent and the Rode Hill Murder.
