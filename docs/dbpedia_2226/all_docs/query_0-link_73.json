        "text": "A TIME TO BE BORN:\n\nOn February 6, 1942, Bailey Wagner was born to the late Henry and Katie Wagner in Bon Wier, Texas.\n\nA TIME TO LEARN:\n\nHe grew up in the Biloxi Community of Bon Wier, Texas and attended Biloxi Public School.\n\nA TIME TO SERVE:\n\nHe accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior and attended Live Oak Church of God in Christ under the leadership of Pastor Terry L. Walter. Bailey truly had the heart of God and lived under the motto of “love thy neighbor as thyself.” He lived his life serving others. He loved his family and would give them, and anyone he saw in need, all that he had.\n\nHe began working in the logging industry at an early age. He was a hard-working man and continued to work until his health failed. His work ethic was unmatched, and his workday typically consisted of early mornings and late nights.\n\nA TIME TO LOVE:\n\nHe married Della Kellum and became the father to 6 children, 16 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. He was a genuine, caring, and kind-hearted man. He gave no respect to race, gender, ethnicity, or social status. He was loved and known by many as PaPa, Uncle Bailey, Cowboy, or simply Bailey.\n\nHe greeted everyone with a smile, and always said something that would make you laugh. Whenever he started a sentence with “Look,” you knew you were in for a history lesson that only he could tell. He could recall stories from his childhood as if it were yesterday; probably because he kept a file of obituaries on everyone he knew.\n\nA TIME OF HOMEGOING:\n\nIn his infamous words “We didn’t come here to stay,” he answered God’s call to come home on July 12, 2020. And just as he would answer the phone with “Yeah,” we’re sure he answered God’s call the same way with a definite “YEAH.”\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife of 14 years, Della Kellum Wagner; his parents, Henry and Katie Wagner; 4 brothers: UB Wagner, Henry Wagner, Jr., Charles Wagner, and Arthur Wagner; 6 sisters: Exie V Wagner, Ora Davis, Flora Mae Smith, Lucille Tyler, Florida Cheatham, and Teria Wagner.\n\nA TIME TO REFLECT:\n\nHe leaves four daughters: Stephanie Canady (Rob), Lisa Lynn (Curtis), Bonita Gosey (Ronald), Shelia Smith; two sons: Dennis Kellum, Mike Kellum (Jackie); 16 grandchildren; 18 great-grandchildren; 2 brothers, J.P. Wagner (Helen), George Wagner (Rhonda); 1 sister: Elnora Coulter; a special Godchild: Kelsey Newman; and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.\n\nVisitation will be held on Friday, July 17, 2020 from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM at Live Oak Church of God in Christ in Bon Wier, TX. Due to the unprecedented COVID pandemic, a private graveside service will be held. Pastor Stephanie Canady will officiate the service. Pallbearers will be Michael Byerly, Willie Farr, Craig Johnson, Steve Smith, Mike Thibodeaux, Jerry Wagner. Honorary Pallbearers will be Franklin Alfred, Jr., RJ Canady, Byron Gosey, Dennis Kellum, Mike Kellum, Phillip Samuel, George Wagner, JP Wagner."
