Arthur Calkins, who passed into eternity on February 3, 2024, the first Saturday of the month. His remarkable contributions to the teachings of John Paul II on the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary are deeply cherished. Msgr. Calkins graced us with his presence and unwavering support at the 2023 Sacred Liturgy Conference. It was meant to be his second consecutive year as a conference speaker, and while we are deeply saddened by his loss, we are also profoundly grateful for the wisdom and enthusiastic encouragement he shared with us. Reflecting on the profound impact of his insightful talks from the previous year, we invite you to revisit and appreciate his invaluable contributions:\n\n• Talk 1: Mary’s Presence in the Eucharist according to Pope St John Paul: Mary’s Mediating Presence in The Mystery of Christ\n\n• Talk 2: Mary’s Involvement in the Offering of The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass\n\n• Msgr. Calkins publications.\n\nMay the angels lead you into paradise; may the martyrs receive you at your arrival and lead you to the holy city Jerusalem.
