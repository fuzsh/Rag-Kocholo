        "text": "Devilish 'Horns' skewers the small-town mind-set\n\nIf you ever wanted to see Daniel Radcliffe looking like he was starring in a Guillermo Del Toro movie, then Horns may be just the film for you. (* * Â½ out of four; rated R; opening in select cities.)\n\nThrough most of the movie, the former star of the Harry Potter movies sports an impressive set of curling ram-style protuberances that bring to mind a character in Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nBut the films' resemblance ends there.\n\nThis paranormal thriller set in the Pacific Northwest, and based on the novel by Joe Hill, has some bizarrely clever moments (occasionally bringing to mind Twin Peaks). It lacks a clear focus, however, and doesn't seem to know when to end.\n\nRadcliffe gives it his all and makes the film worth seeing. But the supernatural story feels scattered.\n\nIg (Radcliffe) has been in love with Merrin (Juno Temple) since they were kids. But after she is brutally murdered, he's the prime suspect. Nearly everyone in their small logging town turns against Ig and believes he's the culprit. Shortly after her death, Ig awakens one morning having sprouted a pair of Satanic-looking horns. This comes just after he was talking about fallen angels, and had a drunken night of debauchery.\n\nBesides making him look devilish, Ig's curlicue horns have peculiar powers, functioning like an evil truth serum for all who encounter him.\n\nOnce he's a horned being, characters confess their darkest desires and blurt out their innermost nasty thoughts. A woman in a doctor's waiting room tells him how much she wants to kick her bratty daughter. Later, Ig's mother (Kathleen Quinlan) tells him how she wishes he would go away. Then, \"I don't want you to be my son anymore.\" His father (James Remar) is no kinder. Convinced that Ig killed Merrin, he tells him: \"She was my favorite thing about you.\"\n\nWith parents like these, who needs enemies?\n\nAnd speaking of parents, Ig locks horns, so to speak, with Merrin's grieving dad (David Morse). Their scenes together are some of the film's best and most honest.\n\nTo his credit, if rather shockingly, Ig is only mildly perturbed by all the enmity. What he is most determined to do is find out who killed his beloved Merrin.\n\nThe horn-induced truth-telling is a funny concept, yet director Alexandre Aja(Piranha 3D) seems hellbent on turning this offbeat thriller about base human instincts into a monster movie. Plot curves are less twisty than Ig's horns. The climactic finale, foreshadowed earlier, is more silly and belabored than scary.\n\nHorns is at its best as a farcical satire of small-town life. Genres are mashed up in an entertaining mix: romantic comedy, murder mystery, dark satire and fantasy all collide. Religion is mixed in with sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. One of the funnier moments is a brawl among competing scoop-hungry reporters that recalls Anchorman.\n\nWhile Ig initially tries to remove the horns, even surgically, he eventually comes to grudgingly take them in stride. (An invisibility cloak might have helped hide those pesky growths.)\n\nThose seeking a consistent tone may not know what to make of this oddball premise, but the unusual blend of genres makes for an entertaining, if uneven, ride. It's certainly Radcliffe's weirdest post-wizardly role. He wields a pitchfork like a magic wand and wears a garland of snakes that would have put Lord Voldemort to shame."
