        "text": "For those of you who look at a lot of Hollywood scores, can you tell me how they usually split the horns? The convention for a standard classical score is two staves with 1 & 3 and 2 & 4. (Though you can see it done differently.) If I wanted six horns on three staves, how do you usually see this split? 1 & 4, 2 & 5, and 3 & 6?\n\nI am just looking for the conductor's score layout--not information about individual parts.\n\nThank you.\n\nFor those of you who look at a lot of Hollywood scores, can you tell me how they usually split the horns?

That's why you sometimes see these groupings of 1 & 3, 2 & 4 because if you have a four note chord it will most often be scored top note to bottom note as horn 1, horn 3, horn 2, and horn 4. The equivalent approach with 6 horns would be 1&3,5&2,4&6, and this is sometimes done.\n\nThe odd numbered horns are the high-note specialists and the even numbered horns are the low-note specialists.

Yes, I am well aware of this. I assumed this same convention might apply to 5 and 6.\n\nYes it does, so in classical scores with 6 horns you will more often see 1&3, 5&2, 4&6 as the staff labels. A bit less common in film scores only because the differentiation between high and low note specialists is less pronounced, with the proficiency of session musicians being higher than your average performer in an average professional orchestra.\n\nThere are good arguments against doing this 1&3, 2&4 split even in contemporary classical scores. 1&2 and 3&4 are still \"pairs\" in terms of working closely together in partnership, and so often this pairing is more important and can override the \"normal order\" of scoring the harmony top to bottom with the odd horns first and the even horns second. Also the conductor may look in the wrong spot for a specific horn in the score if they aren't in the usual order of 1&2, 3&4, 5&6, etc.\n\nYes it does, so in classical scores with 6 horns you will more often see 1&3, 5&2, 4&6 as the staff labels.

Also the conductor may look in the wrong spot for a specific horn in the score if they aren't in the usual order of 1&2, 3&4, 5&6, etc.\n\nI think I like that division, and that's what I am going to use. I usually create parts so that the players can see everything and divide it differently if they so choose.\n\nWind and brass performers generally only want to see their own part and not other performers parts. Each horn should have their own part that doesn't show the other horns, apart from cues etc where appropriate.\n\nThat sounds like the advice of someone who has never been in a recording studio, where time is money. Anne-Kathrin Dern would beg to differ with you, and from my experience in a recording session, where I adjust parts on the fly, I would never do this. In the concert hall, after you know that everything works exactly as you have planned, sure go for it. But when you do this, you have eliminated all flexibility.\n\nI've been in a recording studio, but was never personally involved in the preparation of a score and parts for something done in a recording studio aside from my own score/parts. Several times I have been in score/part preparation for concert orchestral works. So, it could be that there is some practice in film music recording that I am unfamiliar with. But I've seen images of parts in film scoring sessions before and never saw a horn part that had all 6 horns on it just in case changes were needed on the fly. That strikes me as something that would make the part way too big and introduce way too many page turns - in the old days they would have players write in last minute changes to the score with pencil, but that might not work as well in the modern day with nice professional printed parts.\n\nThat sounds like the advice of someone who has never been in a recording studio, where time is money.

In the concert hall, after you know that everything works exactly as you have planned, sure go for it. But when you do this, you have eliminated all flexibility.\n\nI've been in lots of recording studios and I can say without a doubt that it is better to give each player their own part. It's not like having other parts isn't a money saver because it is, but on the high end budget allowing it is way better to give people individual parts. If your parts are at all involved, having other players parts on your part is a distraction.\n\nStudio players in major cities though are so good that they will adapt to any situation and pull it off admirably, but they really shouldn't have to.\n\nAs far as correcting parts that's really easy to do no matter what from the podium so I can't really understand why this would be a problem.\n\nI've been in a recording studio, but was never personally involved in the preparation of a score and parts for something done in a recording studio aside from my own score/parts.

I've never written for six horns before, hence this thread. I have, however, put four horns on a part, and it paid off because in a couple of places, the conductor turned to me up in the booth and said, \"I think that you need more horns on this part.\" I also tend to do this with woodwinds, especially flutes, because they sometimes want to dovetail things differently than I imagined.\n\nIn the end, it is just CYA.\n\nIn cases where you might want more of something but aren't sure, one practice there (which goes back a LONG time) is to write it in with some kind of \"play if cued\" indication, and I've seen this in quite a few film scores. That way the performers already have the notes in their part and they won't play them unless requested, and that allows for rapid changes on the scoring stage, while still allowing for a part for each woodwind/brass player.\n\nThere are many ways to skin this particular cat, and it all depends on the client.\n\nFor me, I usually have three staves for 6 horns; 1&2, 3&4, 5&6\n\nI only ever put both parts on the same part if there is no time to split them up, and I am using Sibelius. These days, as I'm mostly in Dorico, I never put anything other than one part on each players' score. However, if there is the possibility that some parts might need everyone to play the same line, I cue it in, and tell them to play it, if requested.\n\nHistorically the odd players were the high horns, and the even players were the low horns. Whilst I play lip service to this convention, all 6 horn players need to be prepared to play both the high notes, and the low notes, particularly when they are all in unison.\n\nMore parts on a part creates higher risk for misreading, so \"time is money\" is at a disadvantage there and the most sensible thing is to cue as much as possible for recording sessions.\n\nSplitting out parts takes a bit of time but accidentals and articulations are much harder to sight read. Parts for recording are generally laid out so a lot can be written in by the player.\n\nI also don't follow \" In the concert hall, after you know that everything works exactly as you have planned, sure go for it.\" For concert performances there is very little rehearsal time allotted to performing new or even film music. Nothing is 'rewritten' on the rehearsal stage as I understand this sentence.\n\nAlso for score layout: The 'new' way is to split it 1&3 2&4 etc. The traditional way is to think in pairs and not 'from high to low'.\n\nI am glad I pursued this. Facilitating this with cues hadn't really occurred to me. Last time I recorded in Europe--the year before they killed Jesus--cues were a nightmare in Finale. Those seem to be standard fare these days, however. Thanks, guys!\n\nI also don't follow \" In the concert hall, after you know that everything works exactly as you have planned, sure go for it.\" For concert performances there is very little rehearsal time allotted to performing new or even film music. Nothing is 'rewritten' on the rehearsal stage as I understand this sentence.\n\nThe piece you are missing is that these days, you usually wind up going to the recording session with virgin music. Once you know that everything works 100% and are sending tried and true parts to an orchestra, you aren't expecting them to make any changes."
