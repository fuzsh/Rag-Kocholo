If you can then this is the best horror film released this year. Horns blends that horror with fantasy, mystery and even comedy. In fact I think I found myself laughing more during this film than I have during a lot of other true comedies this year.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is legit. He was good in What If, a romantic comedy that didn't exactly require fantastic acting chops. Horns has a little more for him to bite into and he does wonderful work. He's surrounded by some well acted characters played by likes of Juno Temple, Heather Graham, David Morse and Max Minghella. Make…\n\nHoop-Tober, Film 31 of 31:\n\nThis film is hilarious. It's not meant to be taken seriously but it is tonally confused in the sense that it doesn't attack comedy and drama simultaneously; it alternates between sections of pure comedy and sections of (attempted) pure drama that don't work as well as the comedic ones. But the comedic ones do work - at least for me, they did - and they're the saving grace of the film. The performances are fine, the cinematography is fine (although it does have that ridiculous artificial glow I hate that more and more films are starting to have these days) and the direction is fine - I like Alexandre Aja. Quite a bit, actually. The…\n\n'Horns' is a melodramatic fable of young love lost, murder, the resentments that linger within our relationships and within ourselves, and being given infernal gifts to solve a problem when nothing else will work. When 'Horns' is operating in 'To Die For'-style modalities of 'what evil lurks in the heart of' and the suppressed truths we don't want to admit to ourselves it is arguably at its best. When it adds layers of 'what-next?' absurdist humor it is even better. When these things collide with a weird Puritanical streak and efforts at broad multiplex dramatics, it almost works, but then doesn't quite and produces as sense of self-cancelling inert frustration. I love Alexander Aja's movies and this one had plenty…\n\nughhhh this sucked. everything about this screams fake deep and was probably created bc the writer needed an ego boost and projected onto ig thinking he was so badass and such a hero. went on for way too long and by the end i hated every character and definitely didn't care about ig at all and just had to laugh at the conclusion.\n\nnot to mention all the men in this movie suck ass, and merrin's character was just reduced to a plot device with zero personality other than being so pure and beautiful that all the dudes were in love with her and all eventually played a hand in her death. they are all guilty as far as im concerned!\n\nand the way like everyone's ~darkest secrets and desires~ were sexual was boring and unoriginal as hell..."
