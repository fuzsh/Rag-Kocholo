        "text": "No, not going to do a cinema sins style review.\n\nHorns is a story about evil and the only way to defeat evil is becoming a greater evil yourself. Which philosophy I disagree with, but it makes an interesting plot when you turn in a devil so that you could take revenge. Storyline itself is no different from other revenge based story – the hero needs to dig deeper into his evil side to have no remorse kicking bad guys ass until he gets his revenge – but this story takes a more symbolic journey.\n\nSymbolism of Christianity is all over this movie, no, not just the horns, all seven deadly sins, Judas, redemption and at the end sacrifice.\n\nSeven Deadly Sins (well, it’s not a perfect theory)\n\n1) Vanity – the waitress who told lies so she could be popular\n\n2) Gluttony – Terry Perrish glutton for drugs\n\n3) Lust – Glenna the bartender\n\n4) Greed – The reporters who wants a special with Ig\n\n5) Sloth –\n\n6) Wrath – Ig Perrish\n\n7) Envy – Lee Tourneau\n\nWhile Ig and Lee displays several different sins throughout the movie which “strengthens” their powers, where the more vain and self-absorbed Ig became, the more stronger his powers are, while for Lee, when his envy turns to greed then into lust was the starting point into killing Merrin, then the vanity of thinking he could get away with murder gave him strength that even defeats Ig’s devil until Ig forgoes redemption and turns into the devil himself to defeat Lee and sacrifices his life.\n\nEventhough the ending shows a sort of happy ending, where Ig and Merrin meets in the afterlife, or if it is just Ig’s last moments of thought, but it also shows how revenge and vengeance can be all consuming and there’s a line where you can’t come back from it.\n\nMy “overthinking” theory\n\nEvil exists in the world, in opposite of goodness. God and the devil are not active players nor representation of good or bad, there are just there. When the evil that occurs to Merrin, Ig’s powers from the devil are the devil’s intervention to help Ig fight evil back, you need a greater evil to defeat evil. In the middle, god’s intervention occurs, where god still allows redemption if Ig forgives himself and stops the act of revenge, which turns him back to human. But the evil was too strong for human Ig that he forgo himself of redemption and promise of goodness, and turns into the fallen angel himself. This is where Ig crosses the line and the revenge consumes his whole self into flames. But there is an element of sacrifice, Ig sacrifices his life to get justice for Merrin, thus the happy ending at the end may have been possible if god accepts his sacrifice.\n\nThe story is about the goodness and evilness is all man, and how good and evil is not about god and the devil, but whether you chose to become the devil, or walk the path of god – but when there’s an evil too strong for goodness to defeat, one must become the devil himself to defeat it."
