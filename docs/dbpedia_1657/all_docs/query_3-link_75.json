        "text": "Zelenka’s five Capriccios contain some of the most original and entertaining music of the baroque era. Movements such as Il Furibondo, Il Contento, and the various Paysons in Capriccios 1 and 4 have few parallels in the works of other composers. The writing requires great virtuosity from all of the players, but the stratospheric horn parts are simply insane. They really ought not to be played on period instruments at all–there comes a point where speculative authenticity must yield to the practical need to get the notes out artistically and musically.\n\nThe hornists of The Bach Sinfonia make a valiant effort. Conductor Daniel Abraham paces the works well, and everyone else does a fine job generally. But those horns are the bulls in this particular china shop. Capriccio No. 4, especially, with its wicked solos in the first movement and in the concluding Payson, introduces some pretty desperate sounds despite the fact that the players hit all of the notes, more or less. Still, despite some uncontrolled braying and lunging, these are enjoyable performances if only because the music has so much character.\n\nIf you want the best, stick with the Camerata Bern on whichever label you can find them, and hear for yourself that it can be done, and done with finesse. You do get an extra Blu-ray disc with this excellently engineered set, and if that’s a deciding factor for you then I doubt you’ll find any cause to complain."
