        "text": "In biblical and derived uses a horn is taken as an emblem of power and might, a means of defence or resistance.\n\nIn Christian iconography (except as in the horns of Moses), the representation of horns on the head of a person or supernatural being are a sign of evil. Horns were also fancifully said to be worn by a cuckold.\n\nRecorded from Old English and of Germanic origin, the word comes from an Indo-European root shared by Latin cornu and Greek keras.\n\nhorn of plenty another name for a cornucopia."
