        "text": "Horns\n\nNot as subtle as a scar on his forehead.\n\nIf Daniel Radcliffe really wants to move away from his Harry Potter character, he should stop acting like him.\n\nRadcliffe plays a guy named Ig Perrish in \"Horns,\" just an average Tom, Dick or Harry who grows a set of ram-shaped horns on his forehead that allow him to help find out who raped and murdered his girlfriend Merrin. The horns act as a kind of truth detector and compel anyone in Ig's presence to blurt out what they're really thinking and answer Ig's questions. Everyone thinks he did the bloody crime except his childhood buddy Lee Tourneau, who grew up as the third wheel with Ig and Merrin in a misty Washington town where they all spent time in a secret treehouse.\n\nSo let's see ... Radcliffe plays someone with magical powers and has a red-headed girlfriend and a loyal best friend who's in love with her. He's trying to solve a mystery and is constantly accused of being something he's not. He acts frustrated and lashes out at his friends. He uses owls to deliver messages.\n\nJust kidding about that last one, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see Hedwig land on one of Radcliffe's horns. \"Horns\" plays like \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Meth,\" a lurid backwoods fantasy with a trashy waitress hungry for reality TV fame (Heather Graham, forever typecast), a coked-up jazz musician prone to blackouts, a potty-mouthed sad sack who pines for Ig, and two local cops who'd rather explore their repressed feelings for each other than solve the case.\n\nIt's as if Hermione Granger had been raped and murdered and Harry Potter is trying to prove he didn't do it. Only Ron Weasley believes him.\n\n\"Horns\" is based on a novel by Joe Hill, one of Stephen King's sons, and uses one of King's favorite plot devices: a supernatural element appears out of nowhere and reveals evil lurking at the heart of a small town. It's a proven winner, but the one-two punch of a ham-fisted, too-obvious script by Keith Bunin and clumsy, uneven direction by director Alexandre Aja undercuts any suspense. Scenes where Ig goes to a doctor's office and a bar and people act out because of his truth-revealing horns are played as slapstick, and the epiphany that occurs when Ig puts the horns to use with the help of some friendly snakes looks like an outtake from \"Carrie\" (the new, lousy remake).\n\nIt doesn't help that the killer's identity is obvious after the first flashback. I never try to figure out who did what -- it's more fun to let the story unfold -- but this is blatant.\n\nRadcliffe throws himself into his performance, and his early scenes have an intensity that isn't sustained. Some of the flashbacks to childhood, particularly when Ig takes a dare and ends up trapped under a log boom, are effective at revealing character. An effective, low-budget horror movie is lurking at the edges of \"Horns\" but never gets a chance to reveal itself.\n\n\"HORNS\"\n\nGrade: C\n\nRating: R\n\nRunning time: 123 minutes\n\nPlaying at: Opens Oct. 31 at Living Room Theaters.\n\nCast and crew: Daniel Radcliffe, Max Minghella, Juno Temple, Heather Graham, Kelli Garner, David Morse; written by Keith Bunin; directed by Alexandre Aja.\n\nThe lowdown: Avada Kedavra! (That's one of the killing curses in the Harry Potter books, and is meant to send this movie to an instant, painless death.)\n\nRelated links:\n\nKatherine Dunn's review of Joe Hill's novel \"Horns.\"\n\n-- Jeff Baker"
