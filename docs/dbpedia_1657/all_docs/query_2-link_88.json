        "text": "When I first read Joe Hill’s second novel Horns shortly after its release in 2010, I found it to be a perfectly enjoyable, if low key, supernatural tale of revenge, love, and rock’n’roll. It didn’t make as much of an impact on me as Hill’s debut novel Heart-Shaped Box or his most recent effort, NOS4A2, but when the Alexandre Aja-directed film adaptation (premiered in 2013 on the festival circuit, with a U.S. release last fall) hit Netflix recently, I found myself reevaluating the novel in comparison to its movie counterpart. Five years later, the book holds up surprisingly well, both on its own and in comparison with the movie.\n\nThe plot remains fairly unchanged between the two. Our hero, 26-year-old Ignatius Parrish (as great a name as I’ve ever heard) wakes up after spending “the night drunk and doing terrible things” to find a pair of devil horns erupting from his head, and with them comes the terrible power to compel others to confess their deepest, most shameful misdeeds and then tempt them to commit even more.\n\nThis would be a pretty terrible affliction, but Ig’s longtime girlfriend Merrin was murdered not too long ago, and everyone from the police and the media right down to his friends and family believe Ig killed her. Ironically, now that he’s literally the devil everyone thinks he is, Ig can find Merrin’s true killer.\n\nBoth versions follow the same basic story beats in both the present day action as well as the flashback segments that set up Ig’s relationship with Merrin and the fateful night she broke up with him and turned up dead. The movie contains the usual superficial differences film adaptations typically possess when compared with their literary origins. Tertiary characters are deleted or combined, scenes are given new settings, and timelines are condensed.\n\nWhat’s interesting about these changes is how they shift the nature of the story being told. The movie excises some of the slower, character-focused bits, sharpening the story’s pace and focusing more on the whodunnit plot that barely gets started before it’s solved in the book. The difference between the movie’s story and the book’s is this: the former is a story of revenge, and the latter, one of rebellion.\n\nI’m going to start getting into plot specifics here, so if anyone reading this hasn’t read and/or watched the source material(s) and wants to do so unspoiled, now would be the time to check out.\n\nA Dish Best Served Hot\n\nIn the book, there’s not much of a mystery surrounding Merrin’s death. It opens with a two paragraph chapter in which Ig wakes up and discovers his new horns. He spends the next fifty pages or so stumbling around town, accidentally influencing others with his horns, which no one finds odd or can remember once Ig’s out of sight. After establishing their power and thoroughly freaking out Ig, he winds up at his family home hoping for some peace and comfort. However, his parents immediately confess that they believe Ig to be guilty and how much they wish he would disappear from their lives, and when he runs into his older brother Terry, he’s relieved to hear that his brother still fully supports him and believes Ig to be innocent…because Terry knows who really killed Merrin and has been covering it up for the past year.\n\nIn contrast, the movie holds the killer’s identity back for most of its runtime. Even when Ig confronts Terry halfway through the film, he only learns that Terry withheld information from the police that would have acquitted Ig (but would have made Terry look guilty). Once Ig comes to terms with his newfound powers, he spends most of the movie using them to conduct his own investigation. It’s easy to be an expert interrogator when your subjects are all too willing to bare their often dark and stained souls to you.\n\nAnd while the book opens with the prospect of a murder trial for Ig long dead for lack of direct evidence, in the movie he is still on the hook, so his investigation is given all the more urgency. This fits the tighter pace of the flim when compared with the book. The novel is divided into five sections, the second and fourth of which comprise lengthy flashbacks that the movie distributes more evenly throughout the narrative. The book’s slower pace allows it to dwell more on its characters (the aforementioned fourth section provides ten chapters’ worth of backstory and motivation for the antagonist), but the film’s focus on Ig’s drive to clear his name requires a faster-paced narrative.\n\nIn the movie, once Ig gets those who have wronged him to admit their failings (the waitress’s lies, his brother’s cowardice), he moves onto what the devil is most well known for–punishing the guilty for their sins. In a voice-over narration (one of the film’s biggest flaws, as the narration often feels inert and redundant), Ig talks about using his power to not only solve Merrin’s murder but to “set things right,” and then starts punishing those who have wronged him. The vain waitress has her good looks ruined by a snake attack (control of serpents being another useful power the horns confer) while Terry atones for his drug-induced cowardice via the least happy drug trip of his life, and ultimately Ig goes full-devil at the climax to avenge Merrin at the cost of his own life.\n\nAs Ig puts it in his last VO, “In the end, I embraced the horns…but revenge is all consuming.” After killing his “friend” Lee Tourneau (oh yeah, spoilers I guess) Ig’s fiery, molten demon form turns to cold rock and ash. That should be it, right? The story being told here is a simple one, an old tale of revenge and its “all consuming” nature. Something terrible happens, and Ig pretty much sells his soul to balance the scales.\n\nWell…\n\nBookends\n\nWhile the novel opens in medias res with the memorable scene of Ig discovering the horns, the film opens with a prosaic scene of Ig and Merrin, lounging on a blanket in an Eden-esque paradise, sweetly yet ominously talking of love and death, before segueing into the day before Ig grows his horns. As striking as the book’s opening is, the film’s unique opening is probably necessary. It establishes Ig and Merrin’s relationship and Ig’s status as a pariah following her death, aspects the book is able to weave through the narration as it progresses.\n\nIt’s the film’s ending, which also diverges from the book’s in significant ways, where things start to fall apart. After Ig finally figures out who killed Merrin, the final twenty minutes rush through some pretty rote story beats right up to its conclusion (it doesn’t help that the film jettisons all of Lee’s more interesting aspects and motivation, so as a villain he comes off as a pouty frat boy.) After learning Merrin’s true reason for breaking up with him (terminal cancer, quickly glossed over) and putting on her old necklace, which suppresses the horns and leaves him as a normal human (for reasons also glossed over), Ig confronts Lee, stressing he wants to do this the right way and get Lee to confess to the police. Things escalate, Ig pops off the necklace, and things end with Terry cradling Ig’s cooling corpse. These events come across on screen as flat and by-the-numbers, as if the filmmakers realized they were bumping against the two-hour ceiling and needed to wrap everything up.\n\nThen everything goes full circle, and that very first scene of Ig and Merrin becomes the very last scene. Ig’s VO declares it’s time “to return to you, so we can be together again…If this isn’t paradise, what is?” It’s a nice moment that parallels book-Ig’s fate to a certain degree, but it’s a moment that doesn’t feel earned in the film. Even leaving aside the muddled theological implications (Ig just went through a literal fallen angel transformation, so did his and Merrin’s love redeem him or something?), Ig gets to have his (devil) cake and eat it, too. He has had his revenge, passing a damning point of no return, then spends eternity together with her. For a story focused so much on determining guilt and meting out punishment, it feels too easy and pat.\n\nHowever, while a similar ending occurs in the original book, it winds up feeling much more logical and satisfying. The book’s slower pace allows it to round out its supporting cast–particularly its antagonist–and build a richer foundation around its story. While Ig is still motivated primarily by revenge (especially as he learns of Lee’s guilt early on), his struggle fits into an overarching theme concerning rebellion against control.\n\nHistory Repeats\n\nThe largest aspect of Horns lost in adaptation is Lee Tourneau. In the movie he’s a cipher of a character who flips from bland and vaguely helpful to sniveling and selfish on a dime when the plot calls for it. The book makes the depths of his evil clear, and it is a very interesting brand of evil that boils down to an incessant desire for absolute control and an unending rage for anything that slips from his grasp.\n\nThis is how the book frames his murder (and in the book, rape) of Merrin. During the book’s fourth section, the narrative is taken over by Lee’s POV as he recounts not only Merrin’s murder and the events leading up to it, but also the very beginning of Lee’s darkness. We learn that as a child, he attempted to tame a stray cat that had made clear its desire to remain untamed. Little Lee couldn’t accept this, interpreting the cat’s every action as an invitation. When the cat finally lashes out at him, Lee falls headfirst into a pitchfork (of course) and falls into a vivid delusion of God-like power, during which he towers over his neighborhood, believing he could end it with a simple flick of his wrist. He sees himself crushing the cat under a thumb, though the description after he returns to what passes for Lee as “normal” makes it clear that Lee probably just wrung the poor thing’s neck in retaliation.\n\nLee never fully lets go of his delusion of power. He enters politics not as a politician but as an aide to one, the power behind the throne, pulling the strings of his boss and riding higher and higher on his coattails. He encourages his boss’s run against a female opponent by planning an incredibly sexist strategy (painting the opponent as un-womanly for not giving up her career to exclusively care for her ill husband). He looks down on everyone around him as if he still stood a thousand feet high, and again women get the worst of his judgment. Any hint of impropriety or a lack of interest in him personally is taken as an excuse to dismiss them utterly, though of course he can think of them in the crudest terms possible and even act on these urges without tarnishing himself. He even slowly kills his bedridden mother as an exercise in control over an unruly and uppity element in his life.\n\nMerrin’s death is just the most recent event in a long pattern of Lee’s actions. He desires control over her, particularly an exclusive sexual relationship, and much like the stray cat, when she rejects his overture (which Lee believes to be entirely reasonable, even desired on her part), he destroys her. His delusion of ownership over her stems from his and Ig’s childhood when Lee repaired Merrin’s necklace after she left it behind for Ig to find. Lee figured that as he repaired, he should be the one to return it to her and thus be rewarded with Merrin herself and secretly seethes when Ig, after trading a cherry bomb for the necklace, is the one to enter into a relationship with her after returning the necklace.\n\nThe movie glides past almost all of this backstory and its resulting subtext. The bit about the necklace is all that makes the transition, reducing Lee’s story to that of a jealous romantic rival lashing out at rejection rather than the dark desires and anger hidden within those who seek impose “moral” restrictions on society purely to satiate those desires and angers.\n\nMerrin puts up with none of this. When Ig admits feeling guilty about Lee being the one to fix the necklace, she sets him straight: she is not some prize to be won, and she chose Ig, not the other way around. And in the book when she realizes she has terminal cancer (specifically breast cancer, an ailment tied to her femininity), her choice to break off with Ig is not only to spare him the pain of suffering with her, as it is in the movie, but an exercise of her free will against the societal expectation that she would marry him anyway and maybe have the time to pop out a kid before wasting away. Merrin, with her fire-red hair and take-charge attitude, is just as much a “devil” as the one Ig transforms into in the book, one less concerned with the fire-and-brimstone punishment model the movie offers and more with telling The Man where to stick it.\n\nRebel With a Cause\n\nThere’s a pun hidden in plain sight in the title Horns. The primary, surface meaning is obvious: the horns sprouting from Ig’s head. They’re the source of his power, hypnotizing people into spilling their secret sins and tempting them to follow through on their most selfish wants. But there’s another meaning to the word “horns,” one the book highlights: horns of the musical variety.\n\nMusic plays a large role in Ig’s life, particularly rock’n’roll and its musical cousins like jazz and the blues, all of which can be grouped under the moral-panic label of “the devil’s music.” It’s the kind of music that inspires otherwise responsible (read: boring) adults and kids alike to let their hair down and do something fun for themselves and those they care about. Ig’s horns are just a supernatural version of this.\n\nWhile in the movie as Ig grows more and more comfortable with his horns’ powers he uses them to punish and seek the truth of Merrin’s murder, in the book he starts using them like a telepathic rock band to influence those around to let go of their various hang-ups and seek personal happiness. Early on he encourages a sexually-repressed nun who has been treated horribly by her students and her own church to clean out the church’s bank accounts and go on the lam. Later he influences a shopkeeper to put his wife, who has lost herself to Alzheimer’s, in a home so he can run off to Florida with a lover.\n\nThese may not be particularly nice things, and they’re certainly very selfish, but as Ig thinks after Sister Bennett runs off, he “saw these things and understood and did not care.” He possesses a stunning lack of judgment for a devil-figure, who in the movie is all about punishing those judged sinful. Ig discourages actually harmful impulses, such as suicide or murder, in favor of those that offer freedom from misery and drudgery. It’s a form of rebellion against the strictures of society laid out by men like Lee, who notably hates music, finding songs “a mess of aggravating sounds” and can’t understand why anyone could enjoy them.\n\nIt’s interesting that the closest the movie comes to this interpretation occurs when Ig uses his power to convince his sometimes-girlfriend Glenna to leave behind her hometown and all the negativity it has provided her. It’s no coincidence this scene occurs in a nightclub with a jazz ensemble jamming away in the background.\n\nThe connection the book draws between these two different kinds of horns also explains the curious properties of Merrin’s necklace, which in the movie suppresses Ig’s powers as a function, apparently, of Merrin’s purity, warding away the evil devil stuff. In the book, however, it’s linked with a mute, the rubber kind you stick into the horn of, say, a trumpet to dampen its sound. The necklace acts the same way with his horns, dampening their influence so he can hold a normal conversation should he so choose. While the movie makes a big deal of Ig removing it as some big point of no return moment of damnation (immediately undone by the very last scene), in the book it’s more of a tactical choice, much like how a Ig’s brother might use his own mute.\n\nBetter to Party in Hell\n\nBoth the book and the movie feature a treehouse in the middle of the woods as an important part of Ig and Merrin’s lives. In the movie it’s a regular ol’ treehouse they frolic in and later both die beneath. In the book it’s a place dubbed “The Treehouse of the Mind” because it seemingly vanishes after their one and only visit. It’s not until the book’s climax as a wounded Ig struggles to reignite himself that he recalls one other time he found the Treehouse: the night he started growing his horns.\n\nThere are many hints to the otherworldly aspects of the Treehouse. Time is curiously compressed, as adult Ig enters at the same time his younger self exits.\n\nIg also comes across several odd figurines, including angels, a devil, a Virgin Mary, and an alien, as well as the motto of the Treehouse, “Take What You Want While You’re Here/Get What You Need When You Leave” (The Gospel According to Mick and Keith, as the title for this fifth and final section notes). Of course, what Ig wants is Merrin, but he can’t have her (he got what he wanted already, when he was there as a youth), so in anger he sets everything on fire. In the process he destroys an angel described as “aloof, superior” and resembling Lee, replacing its broken head with the devil figurine’s. He leaves the burning Treehouse with the beginnings of a headache, unknowingly getting what he needs, not only the means to avenge Merrin but a way to understand her actions in their break-up and a way to reunite with her.\n\nIg and Merrin’s post-death reunion is one of the weakest parts of the movie, yet it’s one of the book’s strongest scenes. After taking care of his business with Lee and saving a snake-bitten Terry, Ig retrieves his brother’s trumpet (another horn!) and finds the Treehouse one last time, and in the flames he finds a wedding party, with himself the groom and Merrin the bride. Unlike the movie’s ending this feels earned, both by the characters who have demonstrated their embrace of their inner devils as well as the story’s own sympathetic interpretation of devilishness. It’s a happy ending with enough of a dark twist to not feel saccharine.\n\nThe book also gives itself some room to tie up a few loose ends ignored by the movie, specifically Terry, who is left in the film with a bloody leg wound, clutching his brother’s body and having a lot to explain to the cops. The final chapter of the book explores Terry’s future after Ig’s “death.” He has a different memory of the climactic events courtesy of Ig and his new story clears him of any suspicion. He runs into Glenna, convincing her to meet up with him in New York City, where he’s also moving to gig in local bars. All the while he catches faint sounds of a distant trumpet, Ig using the power of his horn(s) to motivate the two (living) people he cares about the most to throw away the proper things the world and society expects them to do and instead embrace happiness together, one last little rebellion.\n\nJudgment Day\n\nEven though they feature the same characters following the same basic story beats, the Horns the novel and Horns the film adaptation offer two different stories contained within two different experiences that play to the different strengths of each medium. Faced with the time constraints of its format, the film tightens the pace, fashioning the narrative around the propulsive concept of revenge. With the deeper character development left by the wayside, the film wisely plays up dark comedy aspects of Ig’s curious affliction, and while the book makes a big deal over music, the movie can actually play music during its runtime, and packs its soundtrack with hits from the likes of David Bowie and the Pixies, among others. A standout scene from the film sees Ig tempt a gaggle of bloodthirsty reporters into beating the crap out of each other, and later emerge from a burning bar, to the strains of Marilyn Manson’s “Personal Jesus.”\n\nOn the other hand, the book provides a richer tapestry for the same plot, giving it room to breathe, and where it lacks the propulsive narrative punch of the film it makes up for it in its wealth of ideas and character development. All the interesting stuff peculating beneath the surface gives the narrative a greater deal of weight and provides a more satisfying conclusion. It also provides much more food for thought, as evidenced by the thousands of words above (and that’s not even touching the complicated question of where the God of Horns fits into everything, a topic that could merit its own 3,000-plus word essay). Looking at each through their individual merits as separate stories, the novel does the most right by its characters and story, but the movie is a fun time on its own, and if Horns has taught us anything, its that there’s nothing wrong with a fun time."
