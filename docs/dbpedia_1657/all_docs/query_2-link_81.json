        "text": "Rad Acting\n\nDaniel Radcliffe’s portrayal of the protagonist, Ig Perrish, solely turns this film into a truly unique film. If there was a completely different lead in this film, Horns would have morphed into your standard horror film and gone in a different direction than the path it ultimately took.\n\nRadcliffe’s deliverance of his character’s struggle ultimately lets the audience relate to the character. Sure the run time might seem slightly long at 120 minutes. But Horns packs a couple unexpected plot twists along with some decent acting. Take a look at the scene below and tell me Daniel and Juno Temple don’t kill it.\n\nQuality Production\n\nSome of the CGI for this film may seem over the top, but it actually is properly done. The special effects feels more natural, in turn leading to the film feeling less cheesy. Even though Daniel Radcliffe is walking around set with literal horns on his head, they seem real.\n\nFor a more indie film, there are some crafty film shots. My favorite is the opening scene where the camera seemingly moves through the ground to flip a 180. The timing is perfect and great storytelling as it disorients the user.\n\nThe run time feels long, with a decent chuck of it devoted to flashbacks. The characters in this film do have a complicated relationship so to keep the viewer updated, flashbacks are needed.\n\nDespite the heavy theme of the film, the movie does sporadically have its lighter moments.\n\nSweet Vengeance\n\nIn conclusion, the acting and decent production quality sets Horns apart from the standard horror movie into it’s own category. Despite the run time, the ending is exactly what the viewer wants to see with a film that has a character turning into the devil.\n\nWRITTEN BY: GREENMTMAN\n\nSOURCES\n\nFEATURED IMAGE: https://thebrotherhoodofevilgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/horns.jpg\n\nTRAILER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8s_1UcdoNI\n\nGreat acting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPk67T6G_2M\n\nHorns: https://fathersonholygore.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/horns-2013-hdrip-ac3-juggsetrg15932917-49-46.jpg\n\nReporter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq7q8u2YAAE"
