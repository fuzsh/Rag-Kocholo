        "text": "‘Are you horny?” Merrin (Juno Temple) asks her boyfriend Iggy (Daniel Radcliffe) at the start of this tonally jumbled thriller. Soon after, Iggy will wake with a literal pair of horns growing from his forehead — and an angry mob outside, demanding he confess to Merrin’s gruesome murder. Even his family thinks he did it; only childhood friend Lee (Max Minghella), now Ig’s lawyer, is on his side. And his Bacchic appearance isn’t helping.\n\nAs the stubbled, be-hoodied Ig sets out to track down the real killer, he finds his mysterious new appendages induce people to speak and act their darkest truths. “I want to get really fat,” his friend and one-night stand, Glenna (Kelli Garner), tells him, shoving doughnuts into her mouth. “I’m worthless anyway.” He wakes from anesthesia to find the doctor who was supposed to be removing his horns having sex with a nurse beside his bed. He can’t even flee to his parents’ house: “I don’t want you to be my son anymore,” his mother (Kathleen Quinlan) tells him. “Are you going to go away?”\n\nDirector Alexandre Aja (“High Tension”) plays with a mishmash of tones, as did author Joe Hill in the novel. The story’s small-town Pacific Northwest setting and dark absurdist humor occasionally evoke “Twin Peaks.” Heather Graham is well-cast as a diner waitress who excitedly details the salacious lies she’s told the police about Iggy in a bid to get on TV. And Radcliffe makes an appealing antihero whose rage over being the town pariah gradually turns into glee at being able to exact twisted revenge on his antagonists. (If you’re a Harry Potter fan, you’ll appreciate his character’s affinity with snakes.)\n\nBut the underlying crime at the heart of “Horns,” a violent rape and murder, is too grotesque — and graphic — to work with even the bleakest comedy. And when the true killer is found, the character is disappointingly obvious, and the climactic showdown is both too long in coming and too silly in execution.\n\nAs for the magical-realist horns, they make a nice bad-boy look for Radcliffe and a handy plot device, but are never really explained in a satisfactory way. They have the side effect of making anyone who sees them immediately forget them — which I suspect may be the case with this movie as well."
