        "text": "★★★☆☆\n\nThis book has been one of my more unusual reads in recent months, so for that let’s say 3.5 stars.\n\nHorns is an extremely dark comedy. Set in a generic small town in America, we follow Ig (Ignatius) Perrish, as he navigates the unhappy anniversary of his girlfriend’s unsolved rape and murder. Innocent, in the eyes of his community he is nonetheless a condemned man – the only suspect, bailed out of trouble by his rich parents.\n\nAlthough on face value the plot seems gripped by supernatural themes – the opening scene features our (anti)hero waking up with two horns sprouting from his forehead – this is a human story. A sad human story about how a single act of violence can destroy many lives beyond that of the immediate victim. Together with the horns, Ig gains a mysterious ability to draw the deepest, darkest (and most ludicrous) secrets out of everyone he meets. Rather than trying to clear his name, our dude-turning-into-the-devil sets out to avenge his beloved, Merrin.\n\nIf he was at the point of seeing things, then it was probably too late to save him.\n\nThe idea that he might be going to die brought with it a surge of relief, like coming up for air after being underwater for too long.\n\nThe general writing is not the most spectacular, as there are some odd similes and sentence constructions which pull the reader out of the reading. However, the themes this book tackles are difficult to write about, and Hill succeeds in navigating treacherous ground, letting comedy and sexual violence brush hands without creating a narrative that is inherently distasteful. This is a funny book, but it is also serious where it needs to be.\n\nOverall, I think Horns is far too white, straight and male to fulfill even a quarter of its potential for subversion, but Hill turns the traditional Gothic femme fatale and virgin pure stereotypes deftly on their heads, and the text is provocative towards Christianity’s binary definitions of good and evil without being disrespectful.\n\nThe characterisation of a sociopath is convincing, albeit generic, and there are some good characters in the supporting cast who prop up Ig’s somewhat benign presence. I found Glenna the most fascinating, but Ig is good enough to root for, and Merrin’s strong characterisation gives her proper space in the novel. She is not just Ig’s tragic backstory.\n\nI enjoyed this as a casual read, and it had some good twists, but there were some aspects of the narrative which remain unclear to me. Ig’s physical metamorphosis forms a significant portion of the story, but I struggled to understand its particulars. The concept of the Treehouse of the Mind, which is wrapped up in the transformation, was just too muddy for me, although it is clearly a linchpin. There is a fine line between ambiguity and fogginess in fiction, and for me this was on the wrong side of the border.\n\nIt is worth noting that Joe Hill is the author’s pen name – his real name is Joseph King, and his father is Stephen King. You can see the parental influence in Horns, and apparently there are easter eggs for avid Stephen King readers. To me, this seems an odd writing choice, and I think for diehard Stephen King fans it might actually be quite distracting.\n\nI will not be jumping to watch the Daniel Radcliffe movie anytime soon, but this book was a solid 7/10. Its concept is simply too unique not to be engaging."
