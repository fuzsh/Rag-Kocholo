        "text": "The iconic sound of cinema\n\nFrom the wistful main theme of Braveheart to the thunderous horn section used in The Batman original theme, as well as countless other themes spanning the entire history of cinema, the horn has proven itself to be the irreplaceable heart of orchestral scoring. Horns play myriad roles, from chorale accompaniment to strings, through to punchy main themes that transcend anything the rest of the orchestra has to offer.\n\nThe first of our Film Scoring Selections to feature two legatos, this library provides an agile section of eight horns, capable of going from speedy playing with fast run articulations across dynamics to slower, stately and more lyrical performances all with the sound of cinema - Abbey Road Studio One and London’s A-list players - right out of the box.\n\nDo I need to own Abbey Road One: Orchestral Foundations to buy this library?\n\nNo, this library will act as a stand alone library, opening up inside the Abbey Road One plug-in. But if you were to own Abbey Road One Orchestral Foundations, it will work seamlessly together.\n\nHow does your dedicated plug-in work?\n\nOur dedicated plug-in libraries work as standalone instruments in your DAW, meaning that no serial number is provided and the authorisation process happens during your download. We provide an AU, VST2, VST3 and an AAX, so as long as your chosen DAW supports one of those plug-in formats, you’re good to go.\n\nI own Orchestral Foundations, how do I install a Selection?\n\nFrom our Spitfire Audio App, you install the selections into your pre existing Spitfire Audio - Abbey Road ONE folder. For those that do not own orchestral foundations, a selection is installed to your samples drive like any other product. Should you then install Orchestral Foundations or another selection later, these get installed to your now pre existing Spitfire Audio - Abbey Road ONE folder.\n\nRead more FAQs for this product"
