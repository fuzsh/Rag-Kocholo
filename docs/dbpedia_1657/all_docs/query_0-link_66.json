        "text": "Holy moongoats, Batman! This is some seriously twisted music! Woods of Infinity played backwards in a dark room isn't as queer as this. Raping Corpse to Sacrifice the Moon is a Chinese black metal quintet from Tianjin, a city famous for talkative and friendly people. This band must be their best kept secret, and for good reason!\n\nThese guys are incredible. They all look like miniature Chinese Galders with identical corpsepaint. The song titles are either absurdly cliched (In the Sign of the Horns, Fullmoon), random (Marduk), or unbelievably fucked up (Sacrificed Moon + Fucked Carcass). I realize that they are from a country with an extremely minimal metal scene of any sort, of which the black metal circle is probably the smallest. That excuse can only get one so far though.\n\nThis is by far some of the weirdest noodley black metal I have ever heard. Two guitars are credited, but obviously only one performed on this release. It winds its way through verses in bizarre arabesque scales and shifts dramatically into tremolo and power chord passages reminiscent of mid era Darkthrone. It's so weird! I actually laughed out loud at how absurd it sounded the first listen through. You have to hear it to believe it! Ha ha ha, just imagining the wankish, meandering, chicken noodle soup solos makes me giggle like a little boy pissing on his playground rival's snowman. It is so bad that it is good. Incredibly, each song contains similar Middle Eastern melodies, all played in the same uncaring and eccentric manner. They sound right out of Arabian-themed Loony Toons cartoons! These spaghettified solos blow my mind. There are frequent technical mistakes throughout as well. Notes are missed, muddled, and fumbled. They don't sound evil nor grim. It's as if someone asked marketing guys to create the most annoying melodies ever, sure to be engraved in the listener's skull for days to come.\n\nInfluence-wise, these Lunar fetishists draw pretty hard from the Scandinavian scene. In the Sign of the Horns sounds like a warped carnival version of something out of Horna's Haudankylmyyden Mailla days with 100% less bass and rhythm guitar. Parts of Fullmoon could have been Satanic Warmaster playing at 45 rpm. Darkthrone power chords also seem to be a big inspiration for Raping Corpse. The bass guitar gets an honorable mention for being inaudible nearly throughout, only noticeable when the guitar enters one of his wormhole solos. I suppose a band could be inspired by much worse music circles, but c'mon guys! They nearly have palatable, enjoyable black metal sections. It's painful how close it gets before reverting to the ridiculous Sinbad the Sailor melodies. It's so hard to do Darkthrone wrong... Yet wrong it somehow is.\n\nVocally, Nattramn of Silencer has nothing on Mr. Zhaiyu. There are no bounds to the insanity he unleashes. I'm not sure why the screaming is so high pitched, but it sure makes writing this review a lot more entertaining. The vocals shift between horribly annotated Chinese screaming (I'm guessing Mandarin or related sub-dialect) and wailing occasionally to a god-like, reverb drenched, voice from Hell.The screaming portions sound like Daffy Duck on speed. It's utterly insane. It's even more shocking than bands like LuST. In the middle of Sacrificed Moon + Fucked Carcass, Mr. Zhaiyu is practically rapping. There's no other way to describe it. If there is but one redeeming factor in any of this, I'll eat my ushanka!\n\nI guess I should take that hat eating comment back. The drums are actually pretty solid. It's amazing that a band of this ilk managed to secure a living breathing drummer rather than download some blast beat loops. It's quite good, if a bit typical. More blasting passages would have done some good to bring more variety to the songs though. I don't blame Mr. Wuqiang for some of the lackluster beats though. It'd be hard for any drummer of considerable talent to conjure up anything that would sound appropriate in the face of Mr. He Ji's outr√© guitar performance. Mr. Wuqiang is by far the most talented member of this circus sideshow.\n\nWith four disastrous tracks, this band manages to bring Chinese black metal crashing down onto its feeble knees. Why Alibaba themes instead of traditional Chinese melodies that bands like Sky Lake incorporate? We may never know. On an interesting note, this band sounds rather decent live. Why was their studio work so poor in comparison to camcorder bootlegs of their performances? I haven't a clue.\n\nAll in all, this band is like a two-headed kitten; you have to witness it to believe it. Unfortunately I cannot give this demo a 100% score so I'll be giving it a 10% instead. How little talent does it take to bang some instruments and call it black metal? I think a fellow Chinese countryman put it best in a youtube comment on a RCtStM video when he said \"i think i can play such \"music\" with left leg!\""
