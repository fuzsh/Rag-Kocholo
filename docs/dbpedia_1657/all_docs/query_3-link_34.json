        "text": "The conservatory offers 11 imaginative undergraduate and graduate degree programs as well as music minors. Our courses provide a strong foundation in musicianship; supportive one-to-one instruction in instrumental, jazz, piano and vocal areas; and a broad range of performing ensembles. In class and in our communities, we demonstrate how music is central to economies, cultures and stories.\n\nOur undergraduates gain experiences typically reserved for graduate students elsewhere. Whether as an operatic or musical theater lead, a member of a jazz combo or a partner in the student-run Pac Ave recording label, our students grow individually as leaders and together as collaborators. If you are interested in a music major, minor or double major, either within the conservatory or in another area of study, we will help you create your path.\n\nOur faculty includes performers, composers and scholars deeply committed to helping students grow as individuals, citizens and musicians. They are actively involved with the American Bach Soloists, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, the San Diego Symphony, and NPR’s Marketplace. Our students often choose Pacific precisely to study with a specific professor.\n\nThe goal of the Conservatory's DEI program is to help guide our faculty, staff and students on diversity, equity and inclusion in the arts and in arts education. That includes modifying curricula to reflect the experiences of historically marginalized groups and recommend changes to governance structures, policies and procedures that may create or sustain forms of systemic oppression. Fei-Lin Hsiao is assistant dean for DEI at the conservatory.\n\nThe mission of the Conservatory of Music is to provide superior educational opportunities in music so students can prepare for successful professional careers and to become artistic leaders of the future, to be a significant musical resource for the University and the community by presenting high quality and diverse forms of the musical arts, and to have a significant impact on the future of music by doing research, creating new music, and being of service to the music profession.\n\nThe Conservatory of Music strives to be the finest student-centered music school possible, one that provides students with an increasingly diverse range of cultural perspectives. Through scholarship, education, performance, and in a range of therapeutic and music industry settings, Pacific’s Conservatory creates new music, considers and reconsiders significant histories, and presents works of and about music through live events and emerging media."
