        "text": "I have an incredible book for you today which I can’t wait to talk about!\n\nHorns by Joe Hill is a dark fantasy novel that deals with themes of grief, loss, obsession, love, and the supernatural.\n\nA year after his girlfriend’s murder, Ignatius ‘Ig’ Perrish wakes up to find he has grown a pair of horns. These are no ordinary horns though, as they compel people to tell Ig about their darkest secrets and sins. When he touches them, he can see all the evil they have committed… what better way to find out who murdered his girlfriend, Merrin.\n\n“You think you know someone. But mostly you just know what you want to know.”\n\nHill’s narrative is written in the 3rd person, but the reader is getting more than just a bird’s eye view of the story… it’s more like the devil on Ig’s shoulder- or the one growing out of his skull. Even though the characters speak through Hill, the reader is still cautious about who to trust- Ig is growing into the devil after all.\n\n“I want you to remember what was good in me, not what was most awful. The people you love should be allowed to keep their worst to themselves.”\n\nIg is a likable character who has had more than just a rough time. Everyone thinks he’s the one who killed Merrin, even though he innocent. He isn’t a perfect character- he has a lot of faults. Sometimes he’s too impulsive, other times he’s suffocating. He’s a bit of a pain but an overall decent guy who has had his life turned upside-down. However, his mix of faults just make him more relatable, more human. I connected with his character from the first chapter and was intrigued by his story. Even though likable form the start, I felt like Ig’s character developed through the story, just like his horns. Hill carefully reveals specific events during Ig’s life at poignant points in the story, so we never really get the full picture until the climactic and intense ending. Phenomenal tension throughout this story makes you want to race to the end.\n\n“There’s only room for one hero in this story-and everyone knows the devil doesn’t get to be the good guy.”\n\nIg and Merrin’s love story is beautiful. Hill’s language is whimsical and elegant but also brutal and edgy. This mix of style provides the basis for the characters who each have their own heavenly virtues, and deadly sins. I thought they were the perfect couple with a nostalgia of a pure and passionate love affair. I enjoy literary couples that are portrayed in different ways. For example, a blossoming and forceful romance as the basis for a dark fantasy bordering horror novel is a real treat to find. Having these interlinking themes always makes me respect the author and the writing for what it is.\n\nThe other minor characters also provide a thrilling and gripping experience. As Ig can see the worst things people have done, and listen to the sins they have to confess, we learn an awful amount of terrible things in a short space of time. From his family, friends, and townsfolk, Ig’s power is definitely a curse as he has to come to terms with the darkest thoughts and terrible secrets the people who are closest to him admit. But- it is a sacrifice he is willing to make in order to track down Merrin’s killer.\n\nI was gutted when this book ended- not because I was disappointed, oh no, quite the opposite- I adored this story and wanted desperately to read on. I knew this couldn’t be though, as the ending was perfect. This book deals with one of my favoured topics -the extent of human nature. I am always curious as to how far humans will go to get what they want; whether its survival, power, love, friendship, family, fame, protection etc, it surprises me just how far people will go. This book is heavily based on the nature and psychology of the mind which created a fantastical complex throughout the novel.\n\n“Maybe all the schemes of the devil were nothing compared to what man could think up.”\n\nI’d say this is a novel that would ease you into the horror genre. It is classed as a dark fantasy but there are definitive horror elements which may prove interesting to new horror fans. Equally, those who are fans of dark fantasy, Stephen King, Clive Barker, Peter Straub, Ray Garton (amongst others!) will enjoy Hill’s novel. I have already started stocking up on Hill’s other works (including NOS4R2) as I thoroughly enjoyed Horns– it’s now on my ‘best books’ shelf comfortably next to my other favourite reads!\n\nThank you for reading my review, I was enamoured with this novel and hope you enjoy it too. Let me know what you think!\n\nInstagram: @gothicbookworm\n\nFacebook: @gothicbookworm\n\nTwitter: @gothicbookworm\n\nStay spooky!\n\nI am planning on watching the film staring Daniel Radcliffe but I have super high expectations and am sceptical of watching it so soon after reading this masterpiece- it better live up to it!\n\nPhotos: me\n\nPop vinyl: Black Phillip from The VVitch"
