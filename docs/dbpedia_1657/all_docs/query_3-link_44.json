        "text": "Rutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir\n\nRutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir, with approximately 50 members, is the most advanced choir at Mason Gross. Its mission: to educate professional musicians through performance. The choir performs a significant repertory of major choral orchestral masterworks, Baroque music accompanied by period instruments, and important works of the 20th and 21st centuries. Rutgers Kirkpatrick Choir was approached by the Milken Archive of American Jewish Music to record several CDs of important 20th-century works, including Miriam Gideon’s Sacred Service, which was released as part of the Milken Archive’s comprehensive multiyear recording series on Naxos American Classics series. They also have a Naxos release of Samuel Adler’s Five Sephardic Songs. The release of their Naxos distributed CD, The Fire Within on the Affetto label, presented Lou Harrison’s setting of the Buddhist Heart Sutro, “La Koro Sutro,” allowing home audiences to hear the major work presented in the concert listed by The New York Times as one of the “Top Ten Classical Music Performances of 2017.”\n\nRutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir capped the 2019-20 school year with an award-winning performance in Germany at the Marktoberdorf Festival, following their work as the ensemble-in-residence at the University of Saarland in Saarbrücken, Germany. In April 2019 the choir performed the Brahms Requiem at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall in New York City.\n\nRutgers University Voorhees Choir\n\nThe Rutgers University Voorhees Choir is an auditioned soprano-alto ensemble that champions music and text composed by women and historically excluded composers and poets. The choir presents two major concerts each year and continues a long tradition of representing Rutgers University—from its beginnings as the choir for the New Jersey College for Women in 1924 to its years as the official choir for Douglass Residential College. In juried processes, the Rutgers Voorhees Choir was selected to give two first-ever high-profile performances—one at Carnegie Hall in April 2019 and the other at the Eastern Region American Choral Directors Association’s conference in March 2020.\n\nRutgers University Glee Club\n\nThe Rutgers University Glee Club traces its roots back to 1872 and has been among the nation’s premier collegiate choirs. Significant honors, recent concerts, and recordings under director Brandon Williams reflect the ensemble’s current high level of recognition for the superior quality of its choral sound and its imaginative programming of new music by significant composers. The performance of major choral/orchestral works for men’s ensemble has been a significant part of the Rutgers Glee Club’s recent activities. In 2000, the Glee Club joined with the Philadelphia Singers to perform Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Sir Simon Rattle. The Rutgers Glee Club complements such major undertakings with presentations of a repertory ranging from traditional college songs through 19th-century masterworks for men’s chorus.\n\nIn February 2020, the Rutgers University Glee Club performed at the American Choral Directors Association’s (ACDA) Eastern Division conference in Rochester, New York—their fourth performance at the division level, complementing their two performances at ACDA national conferences. Their performance in 2017 of the Brahms Alto Rhapsody with Metropolitan Opera mezzo-soprano Margaret Lattimore at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall was presented to a standing-room-only audience.\n\nRutgers University Choir\n\nRutgers University Choir is a large mixed ensemble that performs standard choral repertory in two concerts a year. Several years ago, the University Choir joined Rutgers Kirkpatrick Choir, Rutgers University Glee Club, Voorhees Choir, and Rutgers University Orchestra to present excerpts from Carmina Burana at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center as part of the Rutgers University campaign kickoff gala.\n\nRutgers Jazz Ensemble\n\nThe Rutgers Jazz Ensemble, directed by Conrad Herwig, is the top student jazz ensemble at Mason Gross School of the Arts. The group has played in commercials with Ray Charles, performed at the fifth-anniversary celebration of Harmony Hall in Fukui, Japan, and has had several gigs at the legendary Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City.\n\nThe ensemble honored the legacy of the late professor Vic Juris on March 6, 2020, with a memorial concert featuring guitarist David Stryker, and custom ensemble arrangements by composer Bob Mintzer and faculty member Marc Stasio.\n\nJazz Lab Big Band\n\nThe Rutgers University Jazz Lab Big Band helps students learn about and train on the core library of standard Bop and Post-Bop repertoire essential to all jazz performers. Students acquire a critical appreciation of the history and evolution of the covered genres and the technical skills necessary to accurately perform the music and improvise in an authentic manner.\n\nAlternate Large Jazz Ensembles\n\nThe Alternate Large Jazz Ensembles are extensions of our large ensemble offerings, representing iconic jazz formats that typically feature an array of horns drawn from Charles Mingus, Super Sax, and Jazz Fusion traditions.\n\nRutgers Mingus Dynasty Ensemble\n\nScarlet Knight Jazz Trombone Ensemble\n\nAfro World Jazz Ensemble\n\nSuper Sax Ensemble\n\nJazz Guitar Ensemble\n\nJazz Avant Garde Ensemble\n\nWeather Report and More Ensemble\n\nThe Rhythm and Blues Ensemble\n\nChamber Jazz Ensembles\n\nThe Rutgers Chamber Jazz Ensembles contrast large ensemble courses, helping students master technique, improvisation, and repertoire in a chamber group setting. They are typically four to seven pieces, emphasizing smaller ensemble dynamics essential to professional music careers.\n\nRutgers Symphony Orchestra\n\nOne of the nation’s leading conservatory orchestras, the Rutgers Symphony Orchestra (RSO) is the flagship ensemble of the Mason Gross instrumental program. Presenting an annual concert series of symphonic programs and a main-stage opera, RSO aims to prepare students for professional careers as orchestral musicians by tackling the major symphonic repertoire, which in recent seasons has included Mahler, Strauss, Beethoven, and Brahms Symphonic cycles.\n\nEach season, RSO hosts student composition readings/recordings and an annual concerto competition, which awards winners with a solo performance the following season. RSO has performed at Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall, Symphony Space, and New Jersey Performing Arts Center with many of the world’s leading conductors including maestros James Judd, Andrea Quinn, and Rossen Milanov; soloists Lara St. John, Philippe Quint, Barbara Dever, Thomas Studebaker, Nancy Gustafson, Susan Starr, Ruth Laredo, Alexander Ivashkin, and Paquito D’Rivera, and pop artists Ray Charles and Jay-Z. In addition, it has recorded for Naxos with all concerts broadcast nationally on 89.1 WWFM.\n\nRutgers Sinfonia\n\nRutgers Sinfonia, founded in 1995 as Rutgers Philharmonia, draws its membership from Mason Gross undergraduate students as well as the most talented players from the broader university community. Sinfonia performs once each semester, concentrating on the central works of the orchestral repertory. Programs in past seasons have included the Fifth and Eighth Symphonies of Beethoven, the Unfinished Symphony of Schubert, and such popular works as Barber’s Adagio and Rimsky-Korsakov’s Capriccio Espagnol.\n\nRutgers Sinfonia also sponsors a concerto competition for Sinfonia performers each fall. The winner of the competition performs the concerto with the Sinfonia during the spring concert.\n\nRutgers University String Ensemble\n\nRutgers University String Ensemble models itself on the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, rehearsing and performing chamber orchestra repertoire without a conductor. The Orpheus model brings the benefits of a chamber music approach to smaller orchestral repertoire. The ensemble is led by students in as many aspects as possible, including repertoire choice, concert and rehearsal scheduling, rehearsal techniques, and interpretative decisions. Effective collaboration is essential to the success of this ensemble. The ensemble is coached by Jonathan Spitz, a long-time member of Orpheus, and the head of strings at Mason Gross.\n\nWind Ensemble\n\nRutgers Wind Ensemble, founded during the early 1960s, performs masterworks of the wind repertoire and new works, including pieces composed expressly for the group. The ensemble has received critical acclaim from renowned composers and performed with a variety of guest conductors, including H. Robert Reynolds, James Keene, Jerry Junkin, Mallory Thompson, Eugene Migliaro Corporon, Dennis Fisher, Frank Battisti, Thomas Leslie, Harry Begian, Kenneth G. Bloomquist, James Croft, James Curnow, David Holsinger, and Stephen Pratt, and at professional conferences including the College Band Directors National Association Conference in 2005 and its Eastern Division Conference in 2016 and 2022. Numerous recordings of the ensemble are available on the Mark Custom label with several recordings having earned Grammy® entry listings. Their recording of “Dance Rhythms” received three Grammy® entry listings.\n\nSymphonic Winds\n\nRutgers Symphonic Winds performs both standard and contemporary literature from the wind-band repertoire. The ensemble includes both music and non-music majors and has performed with guest artists such as the Boston Brass, the Imani Winds, and Joe Alessi, and has been conducted by H. Robert Reynolds, James Keene, Jerry Junkin, Mallory Thompson, Dennis Fisher, Ed Lisk, and Frank Battisti.\n\nRutgers Symphonic Winds has provided highly artistic and engaging performances in collaboration with numerous internationally acclaimed soloists and composers including Kaoru Hinata, Lish Lyndsey, Kenneth DeCarlo, J. Scott McKenzie, and William Bolcom. Symphonic Winds champions new commissioning representing a wide diversity of composers and presents numerous reading sessions and public performances of new student compositions annually. Symphonic Winds presented a reading session at the Eastern Division College Band Directors National Association Conference in (2010) and perform​ed at the New Jersey Music Educators Convention from (2011 to 2019).\n\nSymphony Band\n\nRutgers Symphony Band performs both standard and contemporary literature from the wind-band repertoire, while placing emphasis on the development of technical and musical skills. The group is comprised of both music and non-music majors and presents at least two concerts each semester. It has performed with guest artists such as the Boston Brass, the Imani Winds, and Joe Alessi, and has been conducted by H. Robert Reynolds, James Keene, Jerry Junkin, Mallory Thompson, Dennis Fisher, Ed Lisk, and Frank Battisti.\n\nRutgers Symphony Band, comprised largely of students for whose primary discipline is outside music, perform works by a broad spectrum of composers from diverse backgrounds, engaging musical styles that ranged from soul to impressionism.\n\nMarching Band\n\nRutgers University Marching Band, “The Pride of New Jersey,” is unity of music and motion. Founded in 1915 as a military drill band, the unit has grown to become a source of pride for the university and the State of New Jersey. The Marching Scarlet Knights take the field for all home football games. The Rutgers Band regularly welcomes new, enthusiastic members, who currently represent over 40 different academic disciplines. The MSK has been invited to perform for numerous national television engagements in New York City, at halftime for the NFL’s Monday Night Football, was a featured collegiate marching Band at the 2022 Music For All Grand Nationals and performed for President Joe Biden. Most recently the MSK has received invitations to perform at prestigious national and international events both in 2023 and 2024.\n\nConcert Band\n\nRutgers Concert Band is open to non-music majors, rehearses once a week in the spring semester only, and presents at least one concert during the semester. The concert band performs both standard and contemporary literature from the wind-band repertoire. Rutgers Concert Band has been conducted by several distinguished directors, including Jerry Junkin, Mallory Thompson, and Dennis Fisher. The group is conducted by wind band conducting associates.\n\nPep Band\n\nThe Rutgers Pep Band is the Big Ten band of the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights basketball and volleyball teams. Students who sign up to be a member of the Pep Band are split into two units that share the responsibility for playing at all home men’s and women’s basketball and select volleyball games, usually nine or 10 men’s and women’s games each during the regular season at Rutgers Jersey Mike’s Arena. These bands are open to all students. Rutgers students are eligible to register for the one-credit class in the spring semester (07:701:338)."
