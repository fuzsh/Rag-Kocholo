Finale: Andante; Allegro (9:06)\n\nReviews\n\n“Shafer played the difficult piano part (of the Strauss Violin Sonata) with notable aplomb and dexterity. The Debussy…was…elegantly recreated. It was an intelligent and well-played performance. The Stravinsky, in an alert, often humorous reading, showed both players well in command of their instruments and to have, furthermore, a goodly command of the stylistic vocabulary of this confection. The rhythms were bracing, the balances adroitly gauged, and there was more than a modicum of the grit and acerbity that this tongue-in-cheek material calls for. I look forward to more music-making from these serious… instrumentalists.” – Harris Goldsmith, New York Concert Review\n\n“Their ensemble and balance were excellent. The Strauss had sweep and ardor and sounded beautiful.” – Edith Eisler, Strings Magazine\n\nBooking\n\nIf you would like to have Duo Concertant play for you, please contact:\n\nEncore Artist Managment\n\n1557 Lemoyne Street, Suite 101\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90026\n\nPhone (213) 413-4215"
