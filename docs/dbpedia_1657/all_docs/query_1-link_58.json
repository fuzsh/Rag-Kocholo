        "text": "1 Chapter 1: The Music of Africa\n\nAfrican Music\n\nThe musical traditions of Africa are numerous and varied. They include a vast range of musical genres, instruments, and styles that represent the various languages, cultures, and faiths found on the continent. The lyrical melodies of the mbira from Southern Africa, the West African rhythms of the djembe and the kora, and the traditional music of the Tuareg people of the Sahara are just a few of the most well-known African musical traditions. In addition to using traditional instruments like drums, xylophones, and stringed instruments, African music is renowned for its use of polyrhythms and call-and-response patterns.\n\nWatch this video to introduce yourself to African Music:\n\nPitch in African Music\n\nMELODY\n\nMelody in African music can vary greatly depending on the specific cultural and musical tradition. In some traditional African music styles, melody is not as prominent as rhythm and is often subordinate to other musical elements. However, in other African music styles, melody is more prominent and is used as the focus of the music.\n\nAfrican melodies can be characterized by their use of pentatonic scales, which have five notes per octave, instead of the seven notes used in Western music. This can give African melodies a distinctive sound, with a limited range of notes that can create a sense of tension and release. African melodies often use a lot of ornamentation, such as slides, trills, and vibrato, and can feature elaborate vocal techniques like yodeling, falsetto and glissando.\n\nIn some traditional African music, melody is created using call-and-response patterns, where a lead vocalist sings a phrase and is then echoed by a chorus. This creates a sense of community and participation in the music, and allows for improvisation and spontaneity within the melody.\n\nIn summary, African melody can be complex, ornate, and often is intertwined with rhythm and vocalization.\n\nHARMONY\n\nHarmony in African music is often characterized by its use of complex polyphony (multiple melodies played at the same time). In some traditional African music, harmony is created through the use of call-and-response patterns, where a lead vocalist sings a phrase and is then echoed by a chorus. Additionally, African harmony often incorporates the use of microtones, or pitches that fall between the standard Western notes of a scale. These microtones can give African music a unique and distinctive sound.\n\nMODES\n\nThe use of scales and modes in African music is diverse and varies between different cultures and traditions. However, some common features and practices can be identified.\n\nAfrican traditional music often features modal structures, as opposed to Western tonal structures. This means that the music does not rely on a central “tonic” note or chord, and instead features a series of repeating patterns or modes that can be used to create different melodies and harmonies. This allows for a greater degree of improvisation and flexibility in the music.\n\nOne of the most common scales in African music is the pentatonic scale, which is a five-note scale that is found in many traditional music cultures around the world. Many African traditional music also uses heptatonic scales, which are seven-note scales.\n\nA good example of the use of modes in African music is the West African Griot music, where musicians use a variety of modes, such as the Dorian mode and Mixolydian mode, in their melodies and harmonies.\n\nMICROTONES\n\nIn addition, a lot of African traditional music is based on a system of microtones, which uses notes that fall between the traditional Western semitones. This allows for a wider range of pitch variation and can create intricate and nuanced melodies.\n\nOverall, the use of modes and scales in African music is a complex and diverse subject, influenced by a range of cultural and historical factors, and continues to evolve and change over time.\n\nBeat in African Music\n\nRHYTHM AND POLYRYTHMS\n\nRhythm is a central element in African music and plays a vital role in many traditional African music styles. African rhythms are often complex, with multiple layers of beats and rhythms played simultaneously. The use of drums is prevalent in African music, and they are often used to create a steady pulse or beat that serves as the foundation for the music. In addition to drums, other percussion instruments such as xylophones, marimbas, and bells are also commonly used to create intricate rhythms. African rhythms often have a strong sense of syncopation and polyrhythms, where multiple rhythms are played at the same time, creating a layered and dynamic sound. African rhythms can also be intertwined with dance and movement and are often used in ceremonial and ritual contexts.\n\nPolyrhythms are a defining characteristic of African music, and refer to the use of multiple, interlocking rhythms in a single musical performance. This creates a complex and layered musical texture that is unique to African music.\n\nPolyrhythms are created by layering different rhythms on top of each other, with each rhythm being played at a different tempo or meter. This creates a sense of tension and release, as the different rhythms interact and clash against each other.\n\nIn traditional African music, polyrhythms are often created using drums and other percussion instruments, but they can also be found in other types of instruments such as the xylophone, and in singing, and dancing.\n\nThe use of polyrhythms is widespread in Africa and can be found in music from many different regions and cultures. Some of the most well-known polyrhythmic traditions include the drumming of the Yoruba people of Nigeria, the music of the Akan people of Ghana, and the mbira music of the Shona people of Zimbabwe.\n\nIt is important to note that polyrhythms are not only present in traditional music but also in contemporary music genres developed in Africa and in the diaspora such as Soukous, Highlife, Afrobeats and many more.\n\nIt is considered that the use of polyrhythms is a way to reflect the complexity and diversity of the African societies, and also is a way to express the oral tradition, where the music is used as a tool for transmitting knowledge and history.\n\nWatch this video to review what you learned about polyrhyms:\n\nTimbre and Instruments in African Music\n\nTimbre, also known as tone color or tone quality, refers to the unique sound characteristics of a particular instrument or voice. In African music, a wide variety of instruments are used, each with their own distinct timbre. These include drums, xylophones, marimbas, percussion instruments such as shakers and bells, and stringed instruments such as the kora and the ngoni. The human voice is also an important element in African music, with a wide range of vocal styles used to convey different emotions and messages. The use of timbre in African music is often used to create a rich and complex soundscape, with different instruments and voices blending to create a unique and dynamic musical experience.\n\nAfrican music encompasses a wide variety of instruments, each with its own unique sound and history. Some of the most used instruments in African music include:\n\nDrums: drums are one of the most important instruments in African music and are used in a wide variety of styles and rhythms. Some of the most well-known African drum traditions include the djembe from West Africa, the dhol from South Asia, and the talking drum from West Africa.\n\nXylophones: xylophones are a type of percussion instrument that consists of a series of wooden bars that are struck with mallets to produce sound. They are commonly used in traditional African music, particularly in Southern Africa.\n\nStringed instruments: African music also includes a variety of stringed instruments, such as the kora from West Africa, which is a type of harp, the oud from North Africa, which is a type of lute, and the lyre from East Africa.\n\nWind instruments: flutes, horns, and trumpets are also used in African music. The flute is a common instrument in traditional music of many ethnic groups in West Africa.\n\nPercussion instruments: other percussion instruments include bells, shakers, and rattles.\n\nElectronic instruments: electronic instruments are becoming more popular in African music, such as synthesizers and drum machines.\n\nThese are some examples but there are many more depending on the regions and ethnic groups in Africa.\n\nIn African music, vocables are non-lexical syllables or sounds that are used to provide a rhythmic or melodic foundation for a song or performance. These sounds can include clicks, grunts, hums, and other vocalizations that are not specific words or phrases. They are often used in conjunction with lyrics and other instrumentation to create a complex and layered musical experience. African music is incredibly diverse and rich with many different cultures, so vocables may vary from place to place and from culture to culture.\n\nTexture in African Music\n\nAfrican music is known for its rich and complex textures, which are created by a variety of instruments, vocal styles, and rhythms. Many African music traditions utilize polyrhythms, in which multiple rhythms are played simultaneously, creating a layered and dynamic sound. Additionally, African music often incorporates call-and-response patterns, in which a lead vocalist sings a phrase and is then echoed by a chorus or group of musicians. This creates a sense of interaction and participation among the performers and listeners. The use of traditional instruments such as drums, xylophones, and stringed instruments also add to the unique textures found in African music\n\nHeterophony is a musical technique in which multiple performers play the same melody but with slight variations, creating a rich and complex texture. It is commonly used in traditional music of many cultures, including Africa. In African music, heterophony can be found in a variety of forms, including vocal and instrumental music, and is often used to create a sense of unity and continuity within the music. Additionally, heterophony is also used to create a sense of spontaneity and improvisation in the performance.\n\nForm in African Music\n\nCALL-AND-RESPONSE\n\nCall-and-response is a common element in African music, where a leader sings or plays a phrase and the rest of the group responds with a similar phrase. This creates a back-and-forth dialogue between the leader and the group, and can be used to create a sense of unity and participation among the performers and audience.\n\nThis call-and-response pattern can be found in a variety of African musical traditions, including gospel, blues, jazz, and traditional music. In traditional African music, call-and-response is often used in songs, dances, and other ceremonies, and can involve singing, drumming, or playing an instrument.\n\nIt is a way for the performer to engage the audience, to make them feel part of the performance. Also, it can be used to communicate, to tell stories, or to transmit messages.\n\nIn addition to its musical function, call-and-response also has cultural, social and spiritual significance. In some cultures, call-and-response is seen as a way to communicate with the spiritual realm and to connect with ancestors.\n\nWatch this video to review what you learned about call-and-response:\n\nOSTINATO\n\nAn ostinato is a repeating musical phrase or pattern. In African music, ostinatos are commonly found in rhythms and melodies. They are often used in traditional music as a way to create a sense of continuity and structure and can be played on a variety of instruments including drums, percussion, and stringed instruments. Ostinato patterns can be quite complex and intricate and are often a defining feature of the music of a particular culture or tradition.\n\nGenres in African Music\n\nGRIOTS\n\nGriot music typically features a combination of singing, accompanied by instruments such as the kora, balafon , and percussion. The music often tells stories of the community’s history and heroes, as well as addressing current issues and events. Griots also play an important role in ceremonies and celebrations, such as weddings and funerals.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the griot tradition is not limited to West Africa, similar tradition can be found in other parts of Africa such as the jali in West Africa, the praise singer tradition in East Africa, and the praise poet tradition in Southern Africa.\n\nWatch this video to review what you learned about griots:\n\nPOPULAR MUSIC\n\nPop music in Africa is a diverse and constantly evolving genre, with influences from both traditional African music and Western pop music. It has been known to be characterized by the use of African rhythms and melodies, as well as the incorporation of modern instruments and production techniques. In the 1960s and 1970s, African pop music began to incorporate elements of funk, rock, and soul, creating a new sound that came to be known as “Afro-rock.” This genre was popularized by artists such as Osibisa and Manu Dibango. In the 1980s and 1990s, a new wave of African pop music emerged, known as “Afrobeats.” This genre was heavily influenced by American R&B and funk, and was characterized by the use of electronic instruments and drum machines. It was popularized by artists such as Fela Kuti and King Sunny Ade. Today, African pop music continues to evolve, with new styles and sub-genres emerging all the time. Some examples of contemporary African pop music include Naija pop, a Nigerian genre characterized by the fusion of traditional Nigerian music and Western pop; Amapiano, a South African genre characterized by its use of piano riffs and deep bass; and Coupé-Décalé, an Ivorian genre characterized by its use of electronic instruments and its fast-paced rhythms. Overall, African pop music is a genre that is constantly evolving and blending different influences and styles, and is a reflection of the continent’s rich cultural heritage and its ongoing engagement with the world.\n\nRAP and HIP HOP\n\nRap and hip hop are popular music genres in Africa, with a diverse and growing community of artists and fans. The origins of African hip hop can be traced back to the 1980s, when the genre began to spread from the United States to the continent. Rap and hip hop in Africa have grown to become a reflection of the social and political issues that are affecting the continent, as well as a way for artists to express their own personal experiences and perspectives. Many African rappers and hip hop artists incorporate elements of traditional African music, such as rhythms and melodies, into their music, creating a unique sound that is different from the American hip-hop. In countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya, and Tanzania, hip hop has become a major cultural force and a way of life for many young people. With the increased access to the internet, African hip-hop has been able to reach a global audience. The popularity of hip hop in Africa has also been driven by the many Hip-Hop festivals, concert and competitions that have been established in different countries, providing a platform for local artists to showcase their talents and gain recognition.\n\nOverall, rap and hip hop in Africa are an important part of the continent’s cultural landscape and continue to evolve and grow in popularity.\n\nOTHER POPULAR GENRES AND STYLES\n\nThere are many different genres of popular music in Africa, each with its own unique history and characteristics. Some of the most popular genres include:\n\nHighlife: Originated in Ghana and Nigeria in the early 20th century, it is a fusion of African rhythms and Western brass band music.\n\nSoukous: Originated in the Congo, it is a style of dance music that features a strong bassline and a mix of African and Western influences.\n\nMbalax: Originated in Senegal, it is a style of music that combines African rhythms with elements of jazz and funk.\n\nAfrobeats: Originated in Nigeria, it is a style of music that combines elements of hip-hop, R&B, and traditional African rhythms.\n\nAmapiano: Originated in South Africa, it is a style of music that combines elements of house music and traditional African rhythms.\n\nTaarab: Originated in East Africa, it is a style of music that combines elements of Arabic and Indian music with African rhythms.\n\nGazal: Originated in the Sudan, it is a style of music that combines elements of traditional Sudanese music with Western influences.\n\nJuju: Originated in Nigeria, it is a style of music that combines elements of traditional Nigerian rhythms with Western influences.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many popular music genres found in Africa.

There are several ways in which African music can be preserved, including:\n\nRecording and archiving: Recording and archiving African music is an important step in preserving it for future generations. This can include both audio and video recordings, as well as written documentation of the music and its cultural context.\n\nEducation and performance: One of the best ways to preserve African music is through education and performance. By teaching and performing the music, it helps to keep it alive and ensures that it will continue to be passed on.\n\nCollaboration with local communities: Collaborating with local communities is important in preserving African music, as they are the ones who are most closely connected to the music and its cultural context. This can include working with traditional musicians and dancers, and supporting local music festivals and events.\n\nDigital preservation: As technology advances, digital preservation is becoming an increasingly important tool in preserving African music. Digitizing old recordings, creating digital archives and making them accessible online can help ensure that the music is preserved for future generations.\n\nProtecting and promoting cultural heritage: African music is an important part of the continent’s cultural heritage. Protecting and promoting this heritage can help to preserve the music and its cultural context for future generations.\n\nOverall, preserving African music is an ongoing process that requires a multi-faceted approach, including collaboration with local communities, education and performance, and the use of technology to ensure that the music is accessible to future generations.\n\nGEOGRAHY\n\nNorth African music and Sub-Saharan African music are both diverse and rich with tradition but have some distinct differences.\n\nNorth African music is heavily influenced by Arabic and Berber cultures and is characterized by the use of complex rhythms and the incorporation of instruments such as the oud, qanun, and bendir. The Gnawa music of Morocco, which combines traditional Berber and sub-Saharan rhythms, is a good example of the blend of cultural influences in North Africa. We’ll consider this music in the next chapter.\n\nSub-Saharan African music is diverse, with traditional music varying greatly between different countries and ethnic groups. It often features polyrhythmic patterns and the use of drums and percussion instruments. The use of the human voice is also prominent, with traditional singing and call-and-response singing common. The use of the kora and the xylophone are also notable in sub-Saharan African traditional music.\n\nSome examples of Sub-Saharan African traditional music include the Griot music of West Africa, the traditional music of the Ashanti people of Ghana, and the traditional music of the Zulu people of South Africa. A griot is a West African musician, storyteller, and oral historian. The griot tradition is an important part of the cultural heritage of many West African societies, particularly in countries like Mali, Senegal, and Guinea. Griots are known for their ability to preserve and pass down the history and oral traditions of their communities through their music and storytelling.\n\nCOLONIALISM\n\nColonialism has had a significant impact on music in Africa. During the colonial period, European powers imposed their culture and values on the colonized people, including their music. This often resulted in the suppression of traditional African music, as well as the forced adoption of European music and instruments. In some cases, traditional music was banned and punished. However, African musicians also drew inspiration from European and American music, incorporating new styles and instruments into their own music to create a unique sound. After the decolonization, some African musicians started to reclaim and revitalize traditional music, while others continue to incorporate new influences.\n\nCENSORSHIP AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH\n\nCensorship and freedom of speech of music in Africa has been an issue in many countries on the continent, with governments and other authorities using various means to control the content of music and limit freedom of expression. The reasons for censorship can vary, but often include political, social, or religious considerations. In some countries, governments have used censorship to control the spread of political or social messages that they view as a threat to their power or ideology. This has been the case in countries like Zimbabwe, where the government has targeted musicians who criticize the government or its policies. In other countries, censorship has been driven by religious or moral considerations, with authorities seeking to control the spread of music that they view as promoting immorality or inappropriate behavior. This has been the case in countries like Sudan, where the government has targeted musicians who promote Western-style music and dress. In some cases, censorship has been driven by economic considerations, with governments or other parties seeking to control the distribution and sale of music to protect their own financial interests. Despite these challenges, many African musicians have continued to produce and perform music despite censorship, often using underground networks and social media to bypass government restrictions and reach their audiences. Overall, the censorship of music in Africa is a complex issue that varies by country and is influenced by a range of political, social, and economic factors.\n\nGENDER AND SEXUALITY\n\nGender roles and sexuality have played a significant role in African music throughout history. In many traditional African cultures, music is closely tied to religious and spiritual beliefs, and as such, it often reflects societal norms and values.\n\nIn many African societies, men are traditionally seen as the primary musicians and performers. Men often play instruments like drums, xylophones, and guitars, and are also responsible for composing and arranging the music. However, women also play an important role in traditional African music, often singing and dancing in ceremonies and celebrations.\n\nIn terms of sexuality, African music often expresses and reinforces societal norms and values around gender and sexuality. For example, in some traditional African societies, music and dance play a significant role in rituals related to coming of age and initiation, including initiation into adulthood, marriage, and even fertility. In these rituals, the music and dance often serve to reinforce societal norms and expectations around gender roles and sexuality.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing movement to challenge and subvert traditional gender roles and stereotypes in African music. Many contemporary African musicians and performers are pushing the boundaries and challenging societal norms around gender and sexuality through their music and performances.\n\nOverall, gender roles and sexuality have played a significant role in African music throughout history and continue to shape the way it is performed and understood today.\n\nINFLUENCE ON USA’S MUSIC\n\nAfrican music has had a significant influence on American music, particularly in genres such as blues, jazz, and rock and roll. The transatlantic slave trade brought millions of enslaved Africans to the Americas, who brought with them their musical traditions and instruments. The African rhythms and melodies present in their music helped to shape the development of blues and jazz, which later influenced the development of rock and roll. Additionally, the African American community has continued to draw inspiration from African music and incorporate it into their own music throughout the 20th century.\n\nIn more recent times, many African musicians have also been influenced by American music, particularly hip-hop and R&B, which have gained popularity across the continent. Many African artists have adopted elements of these genres into their own music, creating unique African versions of these styles.\n\nOverall, the influence of African music on American music and vice versa is a two-way street, both cultures have continuously influenced each other throughout history.\n\nSome Web Resources for this Chapter"
