        "text": "Photo by Jennifer Brothers\n\nNext week, seminal hardcore (or mathcore, depending on your age) quartet Coalesce are releasing OX, their first album in a decade. Things like this aren't supposed to work, but it ranks with their classic 0:12 Revolution in Just Listening. In fact I prefer it. Certain nuances come with age. Then again, it's important to forgo nuance for a punch in the stomach-- as they do on the blistering \"The Comedian in Question\", which you'll find below. Part of what sealed Coalesce's status was their live show, so it's also good news they're back on the road. I hit up vocalist Sean Ingram (aka the comedian in question) and guitarist Jes Steineger via email.\n\nMP3: Coalesce: \"The Comedian in Question\"\n\nHear more OX (6/15, Relapse) at MySpace. Grab lyrics here if you want to sing along.\n\nPitchfork: Your breakups/lineup changes are well documented. Why'd you reunite/switch personnel so many times? And, what drove you to get together a couple of years ago and eventually record OX?\n\nSean Ingram: Oh, each situation had its reason or reasons. Some silly, some not. The decision to continue without James Dewees was based on him not having the time to devote to the project. In 2005 we got together at a birthday party for Nathan [Ellis]' daughter. We had the opportunity to play this Hellfest show that had a lot of other reunion acts playing. It seemed like a fun idea. We liked playing together again, and new songs naturally happened.\n\nWe tried to play a last show, which we honestly thought was our last show, and then continue making music under a different moniker than Coalesce, but it didn't work out. We felt we still had some songs in us that we wanted to see materialize. The new name idea eventually seemed stupid, so we decided to keep the Coalesce banner and just go for it despite any flack that we might catch for continuing on after our so-called conclusion. We did a couple weeks on the east coast in 2007 for the Salt and Passage 7\", which kind of fueled the fire to do another full-length.\n\nPitchfork: How does Coalesce fit into your life now versus then? You're fathers at this point, have other pursuits (Ph.D.'s to finish, distros to run). I've seen you speak about Coalesce as a part-time job... I don't want to go for a \"Glory Days\" thing, but I am curious about your thoughts on the hardcore/post-hardcore scene then vs. now. I'm thinking of the Internet, among other things.\n\nJes Steineger: During these past few years I've been careful to call Coalesce \"part-time,\" but not a \"part-time job.\" It seems like a trivial point, but we're really conscious about the freedom that Coalesce provides us with regard to our regular jobs and lives. It's an issue of doing something we love and not making money; the money issue only concerns what we need to replenish what we lose by taking off work. I feel like I'm always pushing issues about the market in band discussions about lyrical content, but it's only because I feel like it's such an important thing to reflect on; the market's that thing that's always around even when we don't want it to be. This is related to the way you framed the question actually. There never were any \"Glory Days\" for Coalesce in the sense that the market always found a way to drive a wedge in what we wanted to do (as I assume is the case for any band that plays music which is less than listener-friendly).\n\nThis is not to say that the market is always the culprit against us. I feel like we have always had a hard time fitting into any scene. Not because our music is super original or anything, but just because there's always a bit of an oddity with us on a bill. If we play a metal fest with a band like High on Fire or Mastodon, we're too punk (by which I mean, \"loose\"); if we play a punk fest with the Lawrence Arms and Dillinger Four, we're too metal (by which I mean too low end and chromatic). And if I consider us to be part of the hardcore tradition, the traditional moniker for bands between punk and metal, then I would definitely want to identify with the pre-Earth Crisis hardcore scene when the scene seemed to me less infiltrated by mainstream market concerns.\n\nSI: It's definitely fair to call Coalesce a part-time love. It has to be with our current situation. The Internet has surely changed things, of course. We used to book our tours over the phone. I specifically remember phone bills being something we factored into recouping from a tour. They could get as high as $500 sometimes. Remember those AT&T dialer boxes, the kind that Steve Jobs sold to get through college? Those were a necessity back then to keep in touch with family. Communication is instant and free these days, more or less, and that's a real boon for traveling bands.\n\nIt's kind of a bummer that the Internet killed the fanzine in a lot of respects, but everything has it's time I guess. They were just reborn as blogs. As far as how it affected the hardcore scene, I think it grew it. I sometimes think that Hot Topic came about as a response to the growth of the punk hardcore scene on the Internet, which is cool, but it was unheard of to see punk and hardcore records in a mall. I remember the first time that I walked through one of those stores, I ended up laughing the whole time; it was surreal. While it was laughable, it was sad, too; it somehow felt like it cheapened what we were involved with. Today many bands consider themselves successful if they sell lost of merchandise in that one store.\n\nIn general, while it was harder for a band to get its name out before the Internet, I think it might actually be harder now. You used to have to find a way to fund and distribute a real concrete demo as well as tour enough to remind people that you existed. Now all you need is a MySpace page and some mp3s you made on GarageBand. Moreover, there is a saturation of bands because of all that and thus harder to stand out in a lot of ways. I don't know; there are some amazing things, and some really confusing and lame things. The instant download of a record can be amazing when it's a sign of a fan being super anxious, but it can be a drag when people are basically inconsiderate of what you are trying to do. But in general, I think the whole relationship between music and the Internet is progressing, and we have to keep up so as to find innovative ways to deal with the pitfalls.\n\nPitchfork: Sean, on your blog you have links to photos of your kids. Have any of them seen you perform? I'm curious if they know their seemingly mellow dad has such an intense singing voice.\n\nSI: In 2005, my kids actually came to the show in Lawrence [Kan.] and hung out side stage. They even went onstage and saw the crowd. It was a really touching experience for them. Coalesce isn't a very big part of our lives at home, other than them maybe having a misprinted Coalesce shirt from my work, or getting to go out to eat pizza when a Second Nature Records royalty check shows up. It's just this thing their dad does sometimes. My three-year-old son, on the other hand, thinks it's the coolest thing ever. He always wants to hear our song \"You Can't Kill Us All\" when we get in the family van. He calls it \"Daddy-Rar.\" I always have to tell him \"no dude, daddy is sick of himself already\" and then try to get him into the Dismemberment Plan or something. So far Coalesce and Ozzy Osbourne are the only things he will tolerate.\n\nWith regard to this topic though, I did find a way to include my 11-year-old daughter, Reagan, on [the] OXEP project. One night my son was acting up, and Reagan decided the best way to calm him down was to scream in his face as loud as she could. I didn't get it; it was eleven year old logic. After I told her to cut it out, I realized how impressive it sounded. So when the time came for the EP, she got to come into the studio with her pop and lay down a scream track with me. It means a lot to me personally, since it brought the band and having children around full circle for me. And it made the cut onto the final version.\n\nPitchfork: OX is vintage Coalesce in many ways, but there are more between-song dynamics, clean singing, high-pitched yowls and chant-style singing (\"In My Wake...\"), a Western vibe. When you started writing for it, where did you begin? Did the modifications just happen or was it conscious?\n\nJS: Well, the song-writing process has not really ever changed in Coalesce. We have a certain way of doing things that just works for us. We wrote this record the exact same way we did all of the others. The modifications that you speak of came very naturally I think, because even at the earliest stages Ellis and I were interested in using more pentatonic structures in this record so as to increase its memorability factor. Once we traded a lot of chromatic structures in for the pentatonic stuff, we immediately started incorporating ideas from music and films that we were immersed in at the time. Ellis and I are both fans of Gillian Welch, Nickel Creek, and Johnny Cash; and we are all super fans of \"Deadwood\" and spaghetti westerns. The most oft-quoted movie in the past four years of Coalesce is surely the Coen Brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a movie with probably my favorite soundtrack of all time. It had some serious play time in my household during those years when I wasn't playing music and starting a family.\n\nIt was also during this time that I fell in love with what I would call traditional American music: Bill Monroe, the Stanley Brothers, Allison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and especially Stevie Ray Vaughan. What I loved so much about this music is that the vast majority of it was so structurally simple, and I couldn't get enough of it. Despite its simplicity, it was very deep for me. While I wouldn't say that all of this music was the model for the new Coalesce, I can definitely say that when I listen to OX and the OXEP I hear a new simplicity in our song-writing structure that's surely due to those years when I was immersed in the aforementioned musicians. And in fact, it would be wrong to conceive of Coalesce as ever really doing anything intentionally; we simply get together and see what comes out when we share riffs and ideas. This is an important point for me since I'm still in school and my life completely revolves around giving discursive appraisals of others' arguments and justification for my own. If there were too much discursive anything going on with my involvement in Coalesce, then I would totally have to bow out.\n\nPitchfork: Maybe because of the country western and just straight-up western feel (\"Wild Ox Moan\", \"We Have Lost Our Will\"), it comes off as a really American album. I don't mean this in a jingoist way. More Johnny Cash. A distinctively American sound.\n\nSI: We refer to it as Americana, yeah totally. There is just something about that period in our heritage, turn-of-the-century America, which begs to be reflected on by our generation. Such a raw time. A lot of sacrifice.\n\nJS: Actually, this one question will surely be the most memorable for us. Despite my previous claim about my antipathy for discourse and intentionality in the song writing process, there was definitely a specific conversation I had with Ellis one night about how I wanted to try and make Coalesce a distinguishable part of the American music tradition. Granted, we live after the first punk and metal generations, and we carry that mark very visibly in our sound. But I wanted to meld that sound to a heritage that, for me at least, began around the turn of the century when my ancestors immigrated to this country. We wanted to take a field holler like \"Wild Ox Moan\", a song whose origin no one can trace, and include it in our music; give it our own specific twist musically and lyrically. The fact that one person (i.e., yourself haha) sees this sort of distinct American presence in our record means a lot to us.\n\nTo be a little more specific, we don't just see it as an American record, but as a distinctly Midwestern American record, if for nothing else than the fact that that's what we are individually: Midwestern Americans, born and raised. And this sort of recognition was a big point for me. My re-involvement with Coalesce since 2005 has coincided with my abandoning a fascination with the East and accepting where I come from; an identification of myself as a physical being, this blood, these bones, these emotions, rather than some abstract and passionless soul. My family members are farmers; it's the earliest world I remember. And the agrarian world is the earth, the dirt itself in all its concreticity and weight. That's the Midwest I love: the dusty and rural Midwest of depth and simplicity, in contrast to the urban cesspool of shallowness and complexity that I live in at the moment. All this romanticization I'm giving (which shouldn't be mistaken as a jingoist romanticization, mind you) is ultimately inseparable from my impression of the music of OX.\n\nPitchfork: In a Decibel piece, Sean says for OX he wanted to write lyrics that Sufjan Stevens could sing. You also spoke about desperation vs anger. Can you explain in a bit more detail? I know [as a practicing Christian] you get too many religion questions, but does the Sufjan connection have anything to do with his intelligent/non-preachy approach to faith?\n\nSI: Well, I haven't yet read how that comment came across in print, but I remember the basic thought. I was trying to convey that our music, say with Salt and Passage and OX in particular, is not rooted in anger, but rather in a sort of desperation. I did several rewrites and did some serious soul searching in the process of completing OX. The problem I found is that in the past, almost always, I would find something that pissed me off, and I'd let whoever was responsible have it. Not every time, I guess, but enough of the time that it was what I was naturally drawn to write about when I began writing for OX.\n\nWith this record, I wanted to share something personal of myself in an attempt to reflect on what I guess you could call the human experience. I wanted to share something as honestly as I feel Sufjan Stevens does. I am a great admirer of his, and as a lyricist, he's a muse to me in many ways. The quickest way for me to check a line and test whether or not it's ill-conceived is to imagine it performed in a genre distinct from Coalesce; something without distortion but still moving. Sufjan fits this bill for me. For example, say you have a song with tons of distortion, screaming, and a fast beat; you can rattle off a line like, \"I'm gonna do this or that, and fuck you,\" and it'll sound just fine. Now, try to read a line like that out loud in a normal speaking voice and its comedic value is exposed instantly.\n\nI didn't want to fall into the anger trap and put together something one-dimensional and negative. It's easy to rattle off lines about the things that you hate and that piss you off. To defend the things that you love, and detail your relationship with them, is much more difficult. At least it is for me. You make yourself really vulnerable when you don't take a sarcastic approach. You can't hide in your words and laugh it off when someone criticizes you harshly. It felt right to approach OX this way, so I worked for months to achieve the sort of vulnerability expressed on OX. I think my connection to Sufjan has more to do with his honesty than his spirituality. In fact, I didn't even know about Sufjan's faith until after I had already been leveled by his \"John Wayne Gacy\" song.\n\nPitchfork: How'd you come up with the title \"Where Satires Sour\" for that short ambient piece? And \"We Have Lost Our Will\"?\n\nSI: Those were a little different. I really just tried to let the mood of the piece talk to me, and then I would write it down. The titles needed to move with the rest of the lyrical content even though there were no lyrics. Since I wasn't involved in the making of those instrumentals (actually, Ellis was the only one involved since they're his songs, written and performed), it felt a little intrusive to name them. In general, though, anything we do is always capable of being chucked if we don't all agree on it. There is a lot of compromise and democratic decision making on the whole. It's surely not the quickest practice, but it serves us really well. The band liked the titles I eventually came up with, so they went with them. We ran into the same issue on the OXEP with the intro and outro tracks. I named those several times, and each time they were chucked. JR had something else in his head when he was writing them, and what I came up with ultimately didn't reflect that. So we finally reached some titles that fit what he had in mind and worked for everyone else as well.\n\n///\n\nPhoto by Johnny DeLacy\n\nA lot's changed since I interviewed Wolves in the Throne Room a couple of Septembers ago. Through an endless touring schedule, increasingly tight live show, and steady output of quality records, the Olympia's band's become one of the biggest names in American black metal. As with any genre that deals with its share of web-board purists, this means they also get called more names than your average grim and stagnating Second Wave-obsessed bedroom project. Speaking of touring: Keep watch of WITTR's itinerary at MySpace. (As of today, it culminates with a set at the Phil Elverum-organized What the Heck Fest, but you have to imagine they'll keep going.) And check out a chunk of the excellent (sorry, Grayson) Black Cascade's 10-minute opening track \"Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog\". The album's out via Southern Lord.\n\nPitchfork: American black metal has crossed over since we last spoke. How has its higher profile affected Wolves in the Throne Room?\n\nAaron Weaver: It's mostly a positive thing, I think. I'm not sure if it's affected our band one way or the other. On one hand, we've always attracted a wider audience than a more traditional BM group, so people who are interested in certain metaphysical perspectives but who wouldn't usually investigate \"metal\" are able to more easily access the music. I talk to a lot of people who say that Black Metal doesn't really interest them, but that they are drawn to the spirit and the intensity WITTR. This is a heartening thing for us. On the other hand, I'm sure there are a lot of kult Black Metalers who see WITTR as too high-profile. I don't care about the opinions of these people. For the time being our shows seem bigger, we are offered more opportunities to play in new places, which is all well and good.\n\nPitchfork: It's interesting to see American black metal moving further from its European forebears via presentation, sound, aesthetic...\n\nAW: It seems like Xasthur and Leviathan and their ilk have spent themselves artistically. So I don't know what to say about some idea of a USBM scene. Absu and Averse Sefira are very good at what they do, but those kind of bands don't interest me at all. I think that WITTR, which has never hewed close to any orthodox idea of Black Metal, is sort of floating out in the ether. There are a lot of \"metal inspired\" groups who are doing worthwhile things. We are currently on the road with Krallice, who are really good and interesting, but I don't think that they should be called Black Metal.\n\nI empathize, in a strange way, with those people who have been involved in black metal since the 1990s. There is no doubt that this music, which was once created only by intense and extreme people on the radical fringe, is now \"watered down.\" It is clear to me that the Scandinavian scene was a place of great artistic dynamism. There is nothing more meaningful and intense than the local experience of spontaneous creation-- an ephemeral and delicate place in space and time. This new globalized Black Metal-- devoid of any sense of elitism or commitment-- is a dilution. But the new interpretations and artistic forms which are arising can be just as valid-- they just shouldn't be called black metal. I think it's rather pathetic to hold desperately onto any aesthetic movement-- whether is punk or black metal or whatever. These things should be allowed to come and go.\n\nPitchfork: You guys have been touring a lot. And the new press photos are less shadowy-- in fact, they're crystal clear closeups. What's it been like for you image-wise as you get bigger? Are you embracing the fact that people know what you look like at this point and all that goes with it? You become individuals and not a shadowy black metal band.\n\nAW: There is no way around it and it doesn't bother me. We've never consciously attempted to conjure a veil of mystery around us as individuals. The energy of the music will remain mysterious and difficult to penetrate. But as individuals, it would feel dishonest to try to conceal ourselves since we go on tours and interact with thousands of people.\n\nPitchfork: I'm curious about how the economic downturn's affected your way of life. One of your wives was working on a farm that used only horses to harvest hay/drive the plow. How's that turning out, for instance? Is that your house in the press photo over at MySpace? I know when your somewhat off the grid, the economy has a way of passing you by, too.\n\nAW: We are very unconnected to the mainstream economy, so this current bubble-bursting is nothing that could affect us. I have noticed that nails and manure are a little cheaper than they were a couple of years ago. I hear about it more when I'm on tour, interacting with city-folk who have jobs and apartments. The farm, which is called Calliope, is going strong. I actually commissioned Christpohe Spadial, the well-known designer of metal logos, to create a Calliope Farm logo. Megan, who is my wife, indeed has done some work with draft horses and we plan on using them in the future. But for the time being we have a Ford 1500 tractor, which is going strong. The farming she does is as primitive as possible, mostly all done by hand, but the tractor is nice for some jobs.\n\nPitchfork: What's Wolves in the Throne Room's worldview? There was some hubbub and misinterpretation re: an imagined affiliation with NSBM a ways back.\n\nAW: I said in an interview with a German magazine that I was annoyed that certain ideas I am connected to, such as radical environmentalism and heathen spirituality, have become associated with the culture of the hard-right, especially in Europe. Obviously, WITTR is a group with no political affiliation whatsoever, but some people in the German antifa movement made a big issue out of it, even though I have consistently and forcefully expressed my disdain for the canon of rightwing ideologies ad nauseam.\n\nI understand why black metal is threatening to the simplistic mentality of anarcho-squatters and constipated college boys. These \"punks\" and \"intellectuals\" have no space in their worldview for anything beyond the left-wing politics of a 12 year old. It should be noted that WITTR is also vilified by the far right. My feeling is that if you are hated by political people of all persuasions then you are doing something right.\n\nWhat is our worldview? It is non-political, in that I think that the world is best viewed through the lens of metaphysics. I am concerned with local things and connecting in a deep way to place. I think that human culture needs to evolve past a materialistic and mechanistic worldview. I think that reconnection with wildness and ancientness is a worthwhile path (for me). Is this fascist blood and soil ideology or communistic hippie navel-gazing? I suppose that depends on your perspective. Personally, I think that the old left-right binary is increasingly useless and outmoded. It is better to discuss specific ideas.\n\nThat these ideas seem extreme to some people is very curious to me. Sometimes I will peruse reviews of our records. A common thread is that \"I like the music, but this anti-modern, mystical stuff is naive and unrealistic-- they just don't understand how the world works.\"\n\nThis seems quite pathetic and represents a lack of understanding of the role of art in culture. What would you have us do? Have jobs in a bank and create music in our spare time that advocates for a practical and realistic political reform? All of the good ideas that boring people now hold to be self-evident were created by extreme people living on the fringes of society. We, as human beings, radically transform our consciousness, our bodies and the physical world around us with the development of new technologies and new cultural and social forms. The very horizon of imagined possibility is ever-shifting. Art, such as Black Metal, explores the potential futures we could manifest. Certainly I don't think that the primitivist visions of WITTR form a complete worldview appropriate for every person in every situation. It's simply a perspective and a possibility that is meaningful to us.\n\nPitchfork: In our last interview you talked about listening to Filosofem while working the fields. No black metal musicians have really spoken up much about Varg's release from prison. What are your thoughts?\n\nAW: My feeling is that people are interested in an idealized image of Burzum, which is only tenuously connected to the man. Burzum's post-Filosofem recorded output reveals a man of limited musical ability, and his mystical-Nazi writing seem paranoid and off-base. It seems like he is just another wingnut spouting off about Jewish conspiracies. People who create powerful and revolutionary art in their teens and early twenties rarely sustain any relevance.\n\nPitchfork: Also, when we last spoke, you said: \"We are compiling material for a new album which will be a darker and heavier record than Two Hunters or Diadem. My interest is in creating music that helps create trace-states and inward gazing, but I'm not sure what form our future endeavors will take.\" Do you think you succeeded?\n\nAW: Black Cascade turned out precisely as we had envisioned. We endeavored to create the best \"metal\" album that we are capable of. Black Cascade and Two Hunters should be seen as companion pieces and mirror images. The albums are defined by their differing sound and energy. Two Hunters explores an oceanic and ambiguous space-- the terrifying and awesome space of transformation, torch-lit and filled with smoke. This is the place in to which the initiate is led to confront the non-human world. This is the dangerous and chaotic psychological space explored by the shaman.\n\nBlack Cascade is harsh, crystalline, and imperial. It is a masculine and focused record that draws upon the energy of worldly order and cosmic law. We consciously wanted to create a counterpart to the mysterious sound of Two Hunters. It is the sound of order being violently wrested from chaos.\n\nPitchfork: What's the meaning behind Black Cascade? Do the songs tie together thematically?\n\nAW: Of course, the title refers, on one level, to the Cascade Mountains-- the dominant geographical feature that distinguishes our corner of the world. The album puts a name to a nascent Cascadian pantheon. Black Cascade explores the possibility of a spontaneous local manifestation of divine archetypes that might spring organically from humankind's experience with a certain place at a certain time. How is religion constructed? As our ancestors spread over the globe, adapting to the diverse bioregions on this planet, they developed religion that reflected their experience. Why should modern people not have access to this ancient process? The album is about that possibility. Each of the four songs represents a divine archetype-- the fool, the devil, the emperor, the world. We were thinking about how we see these occult forces manifest in our lives and our experiences as people who are trying to connect in a deep way to a place.\n\nPitchfork: Your releases are all varied, but stick to a similar aesthetic template. Where do you imagine going next?\n\nAW: I am becoming more and more inspired to create a new record. Black Cascade closes the book on our experimentation with stripped-down metal. I yearn to push farther into psychedelic, ambient territory, while still maintaining extreme intensity and good songcraft.\n\n///\n\nLiturgy started as the solo project of Hunter Hunt-Hendrix, but has since expanded to a full-on four-piece band, one who blew folks away when opening for Krieg at a Show No Mercy live event a few months back. Marking this shift, Liturgy recently left behind the 4-track and went into the studio for the first time to record Renihilation, which is floating around as an MP3 collection now, but will see official release via 20 Buck Spin in August (vinyl release date TBD). As a full disclosure, but also as a further introduction, Hunter's participating in an installation I'm working on with Kai Althoff at Dispatch Gallery in China Town, NYC. We asked him to provide live music because his work possesses the buzzing instrumental and vocal intensity we needed to make the piece work. We'd initially considered Wrath of the Weak, another worthwhile East Coast USBM yowler.) To see what I mean about Liturgy, check out Renihilation's \"Ecstatic Rite\".\n\nPitchfork: When did you start recording Liturgy material? I heard about it years ago, but only heard more than a MySpace track or two when you contacted me a year or so ago. Did you start it as some kind of harsher outlet outside Birthday Boyz? How did you get into black metal?\n\nHunter Hunt-Hendrix: I began recording black metal in my bedroom as a teenager. The earliest stuff was all on 4-track, very harsh and dark; a lot like Ildjarn. I began calling the project Liturgy in 2004, and I made a cassette called The Paranoiac Miracle. After that was a long gestation period during which I was focusing mainly on other projects, but at some point something clicked and a very specific idea developed about what Liturgy should be. The Immortal Life EP was an initial foray into that.\n\nPitchfork: Liturgy's visual/graphic aesthetic is interesting to me. Instead of night skies, Immortal Life has a sunny cloudscape. Inquisition take photos in the sunlight, too, but you go further: With both your band name and the aforementioned Immortal Life, you evoke Catholic rites. Can you explain this some?\n\nHHH: The album art is supposed to represent transcendence, which for us means an ecstatic encounter with the present; a violent, apocalyptic, cosmic joy. And a shattering of ego. But then there's also a certain impossibility of that encounter, like a withdrawing horizon.\n\nPitchfork: Like other NYC black metal bands (Malkuth, Krallice), you guys don't don the corpse paint. If you did, what would Liturgy-style corpse paint look like? All white?\n\nHHH: Heh, it's hard to say.\n\nPitchfork: What exactly is \"Pure Transcendental Black Metal\"?\n\nHHH: That name isn't meant to specifically designate anything, but I hope that among other things it carries the connotation of something between a Romantic experience of the Sublime and the ecstatic experience of Oneness.\n\nPitchfork: Renihilation opens with a kind of chanted/droned beginning. You have these series of tracks simply titled \"-\". What's their place in the collection? Why didn't you opt to call them \"Untitled\" or something? It's somehow visually striking. Sonically, they're like weird prayers or exercises or something.\n\nHHH: \"Untitled\" could have worked; I just thought the dashes looked pretty good. Basically, before the full band was formed I used to perform solo using voice, guitar, and loop pedals-- totally different from the solo recorded material. Once we pulled the band together I still wanted to make use of the live solo stuff somehow, and some of the pieces ended up fitting on the record perfectly, in a truncated form, as interludes.\n\nPitchfork: When we were talking about the Mirror Me exhibition you showed me your \"Prophetic Vision style poem.\" I read it. It's fascinating stuff. Can you explain how it relates to the music? I think of Current 93 or Seldon Hunt's texts for Sunn O))) in some sense.\n\nHHH: The poem isn't so different from the lyrics, just longer and more unified. I usually write lyrics after the music is all written and arranged, but this one just sort of stands on its own. The style is influenced by Nietzsche, William Blake's prophecies, and some of Aleister Crowley's writings. I think the comparison to Current 93 is pretty on point; David Tibet rules.\n\nPitchfork: On Renihilation it's hard for me to pin down what particular songs are about: \"Arctica\", \"Beyond the Magic Forest\", \"Behind the Void\". Is there a red thread through it all? Can you explain the lyrics some? I remember you saying they were different from what shows up in the poem.\n\nHHH: They're all about different things, but a red thread might be the theme of tension between hope and critique, or between apocalypse and apostasy. I think something like this is at the heart of all black metal, which participates in nostalgia and nihilism simultaneously in an unresolved way. Or at least that's always been an attraction for me. I think in our day and age we are starved for meaning and also hostile towards meaning, and this interests me.\n\nPitchfork: What does Renihilation, the word and concept, mean to you?\n\nHHH: I like the idea of a second nihilism or a double nihilism, a sort of annihilation of an annihiliation amounting to something altogether different from a return to what was originally destroyed. That's what renihiliation is.\n\nPitchfork: You went from a one-man bedroom project to a four-piece band who can play live, etc. How did that change the feel or dynamic of the band? For certain one-man black metal bands, a sort of solitary \"loneliness\" seems essential. For instance, I can't imagine Leviathan fronting a group. But you clearly incorporated it all on Renihilation. Can you discuss how you formed the full band and where you recorded, etc.? How was this different from past recordings?\n\nHHH: Liturgy originally had a lot to do with loneliness and alienation, but once it started being about cosmic unity, it just naturally turned into a group project. I made a demo of Renihilation on my own, and knew I wanted to pull together a band at least for live performances. Tyler, Greg, and Bernard used to play in a few different bands together, and I've known Greg for a long time. It all fell into place easily. The live sound and the group dynamic really exceeded my expectations, and it was obvious soon that we should record as a group, too. (At this point I'd even say the live show is the \"real thing\"; there's an energy to it that can't be captured on a record.) Everything before Renihilation I recorded myself using either a 4-track or an MBox, but I knew it wouldn't do us justice to record the full band that way. We made Renihilation at the Thousand Caves of Menegroth with Colin Marston, who has recorded a lot of our friends' bands, and who is in a bunch of awesome bands himself. He did an amazing job, I think.\n\nPitchfork: What's with the White Metal tag?\n\nHHH: I don't know where the \"white metal\" tag came from, but I hope it doesn't stick. To me it connotes either NSBM or something like \"grey metal\". Not really going for either of those things.\n\n///\n\nBlack Anvil's an amazing live band. It's how I first encountered the New York trio. Afterward, as in immediately afterward, I got myself a copy of their debut, Time Insults the Mind, and was happy to discover that their songwriting's as strong as their stage presence. The collection was originally issued in October 2008 via Monumentum, but as you'll read below, it'll soon be reissued by the band's new label, Relapse. We go into the group's history, current activities, and my thought on their sound, so without further ado, take a listen to album track \"Ten Talons Deep\", then dig into my conversation with vocalist/bassist, PD.\n\nPitchfork: You all played in Kill Your Idols. And you're still doing stuff with None More Black. In your mind, what's the connection between hardcore and black metal? What different purposes do the styles serve for you musically? Emotionally? How did you decide to make a black metal band?\n\nPD: The connection to me is they're all aggressive... in their own ways. In both of those bands we did what we wanted and really didn't give a fuck if it was cool or not. Obviously, lyrically and musically they are on completely different wavelengths, but mentally not really so much. KYI for the three of us was pretty much our lives for over a decade. Those lyrics at that time were how we were living. Same with NMB. Jason is the mastermind of that band, and I am part of the team of animals to bring life to his visions. It's easy to write great shit and not have it pulled off live, but his songs have this edge to them that you need animals in your band to execute properly. Way different sound musically than Black Anvil, different lyrical theme, but there's an energy there that is unexplainable and it moves me or I wouldn't be able to be a part if it. He writes, to me, perfect songs. Timeless even... we all have our roles in that band, mine is to hold it down... for lack of a better way to put it. We work rather well together, I think. We're opposite enough that there's a great chemistry. Black Anvil came at a time when we were all taking it easy with shit. We've always talked about doing a metal project. Gary started Deathcycle and later I joined-- it was way heavier than KYI and I just had it in my head to fuck around with an idea I've been exploring for a long time, and time finally permitted. After our first \"jam\" I played drums... We got a song down and called \"Raeph\"... next day the band was formed.\n\nPitchfork: A number of the more \"progressive\" black metal bands have dropped the Second Wave shtick. You guys are clearly serious players, but you also have a sense of humor, or at least a jovial approachability. You haven't gone out of your ways to hide your other projects: Folks can find photos of you smiling and laughing on the web, though you do wear corpse paint in some press photos. How'd you make that decision?\n\nPD: We actually wanted to start from scratch with a new thing, without the \"featuring Ex-Members of...\" fantasy, if it was this band or a hardcore or a punk band. I hate that shit. To an extent, it definitely helps, but in this case, it doesn't really. It makes people form a general opinion, which we've dealt with enough in the past year... a clueless one at that. To me, having a \"mystery\" to the band is important because I keep to myself in all situations. We're not doing this to put ourselves out there for people to relate to this time around. Aside from a picture of me and my girlfriend smiling on the Internet on someone's MySpace page, we're not like, smiling all over the Internet, ya know? I like to lay low. I always have. I'm myself and I have nothing to hide. Most details about myself the world doesn't need to know: I work, I play music, I do my thing. I have lots of friends in these scenes, so... I'm not going to fake shit and act different because I'm doing something somewhat new. I'll do it, and expect my friends have my back and respect what I do. If not, there's the door. We do this for us and no one else. I have a sense of humor... We all do. I can hang out with you and break peoples balls and laugh, but when it comes to our band, it's 100% serious. We have worn corpse paint in photos... Why not? We do what we want to do. It's not making us any less or more of who we are.\n\nPitchfork: The last question on this general topic: Do you find any KYI fans getting into BA, and vice versa? I was just reading this Decibel feature on S.O.D. that focused on how they brought these metal and hardcore worlds together at a time when it wasn't common, etc. Certain sub-genres of metal are a natural fit with the hardcore realm... Like, I think, black metal. But I'm curious how the fans react.\n\nPD: Not really that much. If it were 15 years ago or whatever... those scenes mingled closely with bands like Leeway, Crumbsuckers, AF... lots crossed over. Nowadays, there's too much shit out there and no one cares. Our friends come see us, but not many \"fans\" if you know what i mean. I wish it were like that, and a band can come along and do that again. I doubt we'll be that band. To me it makes sense: I've liked black metal as long as hardcore. As long as it's good shit and has importance.\n\nPitchfork: Looking more closely at Time Insults the Mind, can you explain \"L.T.H.L.T.K.\"? \"777\"? I'm curious about the lyrics.\n\nPD: They're both sorta personal, so id rather not go into too much of it... but \"L.T.H.L.T.K.\" is really obvious. It stands for \"Longer the Hate Longer the Knife.\" \"777\" is about us breaking new ground, and there's a lot more to it. Not to be artsy and mysterious about it, but we like to keep all that shit inside because its too much to get into. \"777\" is definitely a hateful song... as well as \"L.T.H.\". \"L.T.H.\" is more directed towards one person/place or thing... \"777\"'s general.\n\nPitchfork: How'd you decide to cover \"Dethroned Emperor\"?\n\nPD: We've sound checked with that since as early as I can remember in KYI. If it was just the three of us on stage, or practice if Raeph was smoking I'd get behind the drums or Gary. It's easy enough for us to fuck around with and have fun-- great song-- so we decided to cover it for real. Celtic Frost's return was a big inspiration on this band, on us as people. They really came out and re-defined everything about themselves. Could've easily just done a reunion, but they reinvented their sound without just some obvious new approach. Really blew me away.\n\nPitchfork: In what ways does time insult the mind?\n\nPD: It keeps going.\n\nPitchfork: Has anyone ever mistaken you guys for Anvil?\n\nPD: Not yet. Only one person i know said \"Did you get that from Anvil?\" and coming from him it was rather funny. But we've been good.\n\nPitchfork: How does NYC influence your sound?\n\nPD: We're from New York, and not to sound tough, but its a tough city to grow up in, especially when we were growing up. Brooklyn wasn't what it is now. There's an attitude to this band, and there's that same attitude in a lot of older underground bands that come out of NY. On top of that, there's a darker side to our writing and it adds to it.\n\nPitchfork: Congrats on the Relapse signing.\n\nPD: It's an interesting choice for us, I think. It's not what you'd expact a band like us to sign to, or not what we'd actually expect to sign to... looking at the roster, we may slightly stick out. However, they're one of the biggest underground labels in the US, and they approached us sincerely 'cause they liked us and liked what we were doing. So, I take it as that. I respect them and think we can and will work well together. We, like I've said before, are ourselves, whatever label is on the CD and whoever is putting the vinyl on the shelves. The fact that there is interest in a label of their caliber in a band like us works for me.\n\n///\n\nCrusty, psychedelic Finnish black'n'garage mystery men Aanal Beehemoth put out the extremely entertaining Forest Paranoid last year. I became aware of the group via Metal Maniacs (RIP), whose Nathan T. Birk endlessly championed the band and fittingly had their Forest tied for his number one album of 2008 with Darkthrone's super Dark Thrones and Black Flags. If you dig the latter, you should really check out the former. Which is easy to do: Download Forest Paranoid in its entirety here. If you aren't sold, you'll get a good sense of the band's approach to sloppy black metal weirdness via Crazy Bömber & Deathly Fightär's responses below, as well as the post-Forest track \"Slutty Boy\", a different mix of which will appear on Nekro Punk.\n\nPitchfork: Why did you decide to give Forest Paranoid away for free? It connects with your mention of 1982 hardcore and punk as influences. Was it a DIY move or an easy and cheap way of spreading the word of Satan? 2008 was a weird year for music in this sense: Folks like Nine Inch Nails, etc., giving their music away for free.\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Jau!!! We're total crusties from Finland and we're nodding all the time... 'cos of the medication. We came up with the idea because it was the easiest and cheapest way and that's the way we like it. Old donkeys like NIN have to do something like that because they haven't done anything interesting for years and probably cannot get any thrills even if they suck cake from a pussy. But anyway... This is not charity work. We're only promoting the sounds of true Nekro-- we're showing bits of the Form of Satan that is awaiting you. Basically we're nekro punks and this is how it is.\n\nPitchfork: It's a fun album: Late-period Darkthrone on the MC5... It's blackened psychedelic garage rock. How'd you develop your sound?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: We just play fast and record everything at once and then see what it was. We just had to do something so we took our pills and guitars and started to play... it's more like we were forced to do it. But we knew it was good shit all along while doing it. True nekro is what it's all about. Evil... 666 km per hour, traveling without moving, you know. Full moon freak out, shrooms and shit like that. Vodka is my only friend. Now we're fighting against the brain damages we got from all of this ghost business. And that's real heavy, too, so it's like aftermath or in fact part two now and it's still going on strong. We made our guitars and effect boxes and amps and so on. Total chaos noise overdose total maximum poltergeist retardation!\n\nPitchfork: You mention a number of older influences (\"Hellhammer, KaAos, the Shaggs, Gism, Black Flag & Elvis\"). What contemporary bands do you dig?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Lately Deathly Fightär has been digging Jay Reatard, Gallhammer, Revolting Berbers, Jex Thoth and says that Chestburster and Death With a Dagger are tough shit. Crazy Bömber thinks Dystopia was fucking great and these days he's spinning nothing.\n\nPitchfork: I find it odd that you guys were rejected by Metal Archives/Encyclopedia Metallum for not being metal enough. It's in one of the threads at their site. What gives?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: A bunch of dickhead sissyboys. This sound is too metal for them, that's why. It is overcharging their monkeybrains. Aanal Beehemoth is 100% mind warp metal so suck on a messy shit you assholez. A bunch of sluttybois.\n\nPitchfork: Can you explain the spelling of the band's moniker?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: It's so evil it's attacking the ecosystem like an Afghanistan Airlines Boeing. Straight to Hell!!!! The band's name Aanal Beehemoth is meaning of all things so fucking evil so fucking dark and mysterious and hairy and heavy memory distorting medication. It is so moisty that you might better not try to understand it.\n\nPitchfork: Aanal Beehemoth strikes me as fairly tongue in cheek. But then, it can be hard to know for sure. On the cover art, you note it's in \"In Nekro Satanic Stereo\". So, how playful are you guys being with something like that? Or with songs like \"Suck Satan's Cock\" and \"From Aanal With Love\"?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Whoa! We are actually totally serious cold face players. Gonna take a shit in the street and not tell you about it because it's not that big deal for us. Forest Paranoid was recorded and mixed in nekro satanic stereo paranoia sound so it's just trying to tell people about the maximum quality of the effort. We are 100% serious about this shit!!\n\nPitchfork: What would happen if someone took you at your word and actually literally \"Suck(ed) Satan's Cock\"?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Most likely pure pleasure and sizzling hot cum all over your chest. Most evil facial!! Gonna turn you into a mongoloid and send you back to the ice age. We believe that many in the music business have done it with great success.\n\nPitchfork: Is there an overall lyrical/conceptual idea behind Forest Paranoid? I saw a joking response you gave to Metal Maniacs...\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Yeah, that Metal Maniacs guy got it totally wrong. But he liked the album so that's great. It is about having a cockroach farm and surviving the ages. We are gonna build a deep freezing freezer that will freeze our heads and then we'll be traveling time like Rambo. We'd like to say thanks Satan for everything we got and praise him for operating us and washing our backs at sauna. It's about total nekro hell and having miserable afterlife as a ghoul and masturbating behind your curtain at night.\n\nPitchfork: When you recorded the album you were primarily a duo? Now you're a quartet in the studio and a quintet live? Are you planning any sort of tour?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Yep, but we're very busy at the time. When Fightär sobers up a bit we'll be heading to the road.\n\nPitchfork: You've mentioned that you recorded Forest Paranoid straight to 4-track in just a few hours, that much of it was improvised. True? Did you use the same approach for the new material you recorded? When can we expect that stuff and what'll it be like?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: That's all true about the first album. It was almost totally improvised and we used genuine equipment like no other. We recorded new tunes last summer and the second album is gonna be total rock'n'roll paradise when it's mixed and done. Straight descendant from Elvis. This time around we used bigtime computer technology. It's much more fuzzy garage crust sounding shit than Forest Paranoid. More fuzz on everything... But the message is the same. Sniff glue and whip yourself. The new tape is called Nekro Punk and it goes online as soon as it's ready so watch out!!\n\nPitchfork: You make your own equipment? Do you have photos of any of the stuff you used to record the album? Why'd you decide to take this approach? Did you make the 4-track, too?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: No photo. We can't make a camera. We made our instruments because we needed a special sound for Aanal and that's what we got. Someone called Fostex made the recorder.\n\nPitchfork: Your engineer's name is Ass Lipstick?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: A big fat boi who looked like an ass and used lipstick. Can't remember what he did, cannot forget his ugly face.\n\nPitchfork: Where do you live in Finland? Can you describe the city/town some?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Actually we are both hobos and mules travellin' across Finland, Sweden, and Estonia only to drop in at an internet cafe or a public library to give email interviews. THE UNHOLY TRINITY!!!\n\nPitchfork: Do you ever cross paths with Horna?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: We saw them at a leather shop buying some pants and at the hardware store shopping for a hammer. We don't know 'em. We usually don't hang around at right wing parties. All our friends are hellraising punkers and gays and black metal weirdos and food brain stonerhippies and junkiescum and homos.\n\nPitchfork: You have the slogan \"rock n roll is making death and Aanal is digging the grave.\" So you're burying rock'n'roll?\n\nAanal Beehemoth: Yes. We're doing our best.\n\n///\n\nHeavy Rotation: Coalesce: Ox [Relapse]; Minsk: With Echoes in the Movement of Stone [Relapse]; Mt Eerie: Wind's Poem [unreleased]; Gwynbleidd: Nostalgia [BlackCurrant]; Razor Of Occam: Homage to Martyrs [Metal Blade]; 1349*:* Revelations of the Black Flame [Candlelight]; Bergraven: Till Makabert Väsen [Hydra Head]; Aluk Todolo: Finsternis [Utech]; Amber Asylum: Bitter River [Profound Lore]; Slough Feg: Ape Uprising!
