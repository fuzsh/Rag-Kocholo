        "text": "This concerto is remarkable for its unusual form and instrumentation. Bach composed it for three violins, three violas, three cellos and basso continuo. In other words, 3x3, which is a rational choice you would expect from a modernist like Pierre Boulez, rather than a Baroque composer like Bach. There is no distinction between solo and ensemble instruments: all the strings play both solo and tutti.\n\nThe question is whether Bach originally planned the instrumentation like this. In the final movement, the cellos have no individual role and correspond harmoniously with the continuo. In the first movement, too, they form the least divided group. This may indicate that the concerto was based on a version with just one cello part.\n\nThe striking thing about the form is the lack of a fully-developed slow middle movement. The two fast movements are separated by an adagio of a single measure consisting merely of two sustained chords: a harmonic cadence that seems to have been composed more as a bridge and short pause for breath. In this performance, Shunske Sato decided to make the middle movement into a real pause for breath and play a brief cadenza.\n\nBoth the fast movements are characterised by a strong rhythmic drive. The first movement is dominated by a galloping rhythm and the latter by fast notes streaming through the instrument groups like a perpetuum mobile. When Bach reused the first movement as the opening sinfonia of the Whitsun cantata Ich liebe den Höchsten von ganzem Gemüte, BWV 174, he added two oboes, an alto oboe (‘taille’) and horns to the strings, and a bassoon to the continuo."
