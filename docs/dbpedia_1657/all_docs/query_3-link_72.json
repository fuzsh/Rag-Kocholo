        "text": "Recently I got to play an extremely fun big band show where every chart we performed was composed by someone in the band. We performed a couple of my own compositions as well as many by some of the best big band writers in my area. All in all, it was a very rewarding musical experience, but there were some issues with a lot of the parts we played that took away valuable rehearsal time and at times during the performance the music suffered.\n\nCoincidentally, a friend recently posted on social media about struggling to get his charts to sound the way he envisioned. The ensuing discussion seemed to focus largely on the notation software that was being used, but in my opinion that’s putting the cart before the horse. I feel that most composers and arrangers who are finding their music isn’t being performed well is due to the music not being notated well. Even experienced composers and arrangers often underestimate the time and effort they need to take to make sure that the musicians are getting all the information they need to play the music correctly without cluttering up their sheet music.\n\nWhile it’s best to teach students by describing what to do, rather than what not to do, I pulled some real-world examples of music that have notation problems so that I could demonstrate how I would prefer to to notate the same thing. Some of this music is drawn from my own music, but some are from other composers. I’ve made all the same errors I’m going to complain about here and will make some of them again. This list is by no means definitive, but are common mistakes that deserve an arranger’s attention prior to the first rehearsal.\n\nNot Notating the Style\n\nAll the musicians need to know from the beginning what the style (and tempo) of the composition is. There’s a big difference between swing and straight 8th note feel. If your musicians are going to get a look at the music in advance and rehearse in advance they need to know what style to play in and how fast to practice it.\n\nAt the show I mentioned above we took time out of our rehearsal so one composer could inform the rhythm section about sections that were straight 8th note and swing 8th note feels. That should have been marked in the parts already. And all the musicians should have that indicated, not just the rhythm section.\n\nHere’s an example of how I like to notate drum parts. The groove is clearly notated so the drummer knows whether to play in 2 or 4. The second measure shows a hit the band makes while the fourth measure indicates that the drummer should play that exact rhythm. I gave the drummer a cue of who is playing at letter E to make the part easier to follow.\n\nAll the musicians should know when the style changes, not just the rhythm section.\n\nNot Notating Articulations Correctly\n\nI’ve found this to be a more serious issue with rhythm section players who are writing for horns, but even horn players often don’t notate the articulations correctly. Here are some examples.\n\nThe above image is from a chart where the current feel is swing 8th notes. The trouble the musicians will run into here is whether to play the quarter notes long or short. In a swing context, quarter notes are usually played short, butwe ended up settling on playing them long in this passage. I always notate an articulation on quarter notes in a jazz chart because there is that question of long or short quarter notes. For short notes you can mark them staccato (short, not particularly accented) or use the “roof-top” accent (short and accented). For long quarter notes I would use a tenuto (dash) marking, but I also will often also put a slur or phrase marking over the passage.\n\nIn this example there are two things I would correct. First, I would eliminate the tie across the bar line and put an 8th rest on the downbeat of the second measure. It is marked to be played short, but there is a visual discrepancy that players will get in this situation. Tied notes like this tend to be misinterpreted as long.\n\nThe tie across the middle of the second measure is perfect, since it’s indicated to be played full value. The only thing I would change about this passage is to pull the tenuto marking up above the staff. Depending on the software you’re using, that may be as simple as checking a box somewhere. When articulations are written inside the staff it can be easy to miss it as part of the tie.\n\nHere’s another example of quarter notes that need articulations. The one accent we get is inconsistent and I get the impression that the lack of articulations here were the arranger’s oversight.\n\nSuccessive quarter notes on the offbeat like this can be problematic for the musicians to play if the articulations aren’t indicated. It seems to be almost as common for this sort of rhythm (in a swing context) to be played with long quarter notes as with short quarter notes. Arrangers need to help their musicians understand what is wanted.\n\nDepending on the answer to the question, long or short, I might also prefer to notate them as 8th note offbeats instead. Or make the middle off beat two 8ths tied together so that the middle of the measure is visually indicated.\n\nFrom the same chart, the above excerpt has the quarter note articulated with accents. This implies they should be played long, but I would prefer a double articulation here instead, a tenuto marking with an accent above it. It makes the length of those quarter note unambiguous.\n\nI would also change the accidentals at the end of the above excerpt, for what it’s worth. The musician is going to be thinking in flats the measure before, best to stick with an implied flat key there for the individual musician, even if the underlying chord or key center implies sharps.\n\nThe main problem with the above excerpt is that the first measure is missing an 8th note. It turns out there should be an 8th note rest at the beginning of this measure, but when I first read through this chart I assumed there was a dotted quarter note on the 3rd beat. It’s really easy for arrangers to miss stuff like this in their parts, you have to take the time to go through each part carefully and even then things slip by.\n\nLegato or staccato? The fact that the offbeats are written as ties across the barline suggest long, but with limited rehearsal times (or sight reading on the gig) the arranger should let the musicians know.\n\nThe above image is an excerpt from a ballad. I wanted to show this as one example of how we can be clearer with how the passage should be articulated. There are tenuto marks above the quarter nots as well as a slur to indicate the passage should be played legato.\n\nThis is an example of what I’m guessing is the arranger notating the parts for the computer playback, not for a real musician. I know from playing this chart many times that the articulations for the first two measures are “short, long, short.” It would read much better to write the first beat as a quarter note with a roof-top or a staccato, the second beat with a tenuto, and the 3rd beat again with the roof-top or staccato marking. If you want a staccato quarter note use an articulation, don’t notate as an 8th note followed by an 8th rest.\n\nHere’s how I would like to see that passage.\n\nHere’s another example with the same issue. I’m sure that when the computer plays back this passage it sounds fine, but the last note in the excerpt below should have been written as a quarter note with a roof-top or staccato marking above.\n\nHere’s how I would notate the above.\n\nAbove is another example of the accents on quarter note without any indication of full value or staccato length to the quarter notes. My reasoning at the time was that if I put in roof-top accents they would get played shorter than I wanted in this particular passage. I wanted these quarter notes played a bit longer, but not full value. In retrospect I probably should have written them as roof-top accents and then indicated with text above that these notes should be played “fat.”\n\nAgain, I believe that arrangers should ALWAYS mark quarter note articulations for jazz-style charts. There’s too much room for different interpretations otherwise and it will make your music sound sloppy if everyone doesn’t play it the same way.\n\nNot Writing Horns Idiomatically\n\nThe above excerpt from a trombone part isn’t unplayable high, but it is unnecessarily so. In this particular passage there were trumpets also playing the exact same notes. In the context of this passage I believe that this particular line sounds much better on trumpet and this trombone part should have either been dropped down an octave, revoiced so that the part was covering different notes in the chord in a range more comfortable on trombone, or left out. This composer did suggest to brass to play some of the lines down an octave if we wanted, so I think he had been informed that his writing for brass is a bit too high for comfort.\n\nA lot of the notation software today will give you warnings if you exceed the range of the instrument. Finale has a setting so that you can check ranges for beginning, intermediate, and advanced players. If you don’t happen to play that instrument or know its capabilities well enough this can help you avoid writing passages like above.\n\nOne of the best things a composer and arranger can do is to ask a friend or colleague to play a passage for you so that you can hear what it sounds like. Often times less experienced arrangers will write something for an instrument that is technically possible to play, but because of the range, dynamic, tempo, etc. it will sound rough or not appropriate for the desired musical effect.\n\nTaking “methods” classes in college (Woodwind Methods, Strings Methods, etc.) for music education majors is a great way for composers and arrangers to learn how to write more idiomatically for the various instruments. Perhaps even more so than the orchestration classes I’ve taken.\n\nWhen I was a grad student we had Bill Prince visit and play as a guest artist for a jazz festival. The charts he sent for us to play were all written by him. Because he plays all the instruments very well he understands each of those instruments and what they can play. None of his parts were difficult to play, but his charts all sounded great.\n\nStudy the capabilities of the instruments you’re writing for and write your parts accordingly.\n\nNot Proofing Parts Carefully\n\nIt’s very easy to miss little stuff in your parts. I don’t always do so, but sometimes after I have the parts printed I’ll actually play through every part myself. I almost always find something I missed this way.\n\nHere is another example of the arranger missing some stuff that needed better proofing before the parts were printed. In the first ending there is that last 16th note. I know from playing this chart and from other sections in this part that this was a copy and paste mistake. The lick just before the first ending is played in other parts of the chart and then the 16th note is followed by a note on the downbeat. The arranger copied and pasted the lick, but forgot to take out the 16th note in this particular context. When you copy and paste using notation software be aware of things like this.\n\nThe notation above isn’t too bad, but you need to make sure all elements on the page are not overlapping each other. The tempo and style change above got placed overlapping with the rehearsal letter. This will happen commonly with chord symbols, which can make it difficult or impossible for the musician to tell what chord to play.\n\nBe sure to space your parts out so that you don’t end up with accidentals overlapping noteheads like above. Is the downbeat of count three a sharp or a natural? What if the light isn’t too good or the musician’s eyesight isn’t so clear?\n\nThink carefully about how you notate accidentals. It’s typically best to notate all flats or all sharps (or naturals, when needed), rather than mixing them. A general rule of thumb is if the line ascends you will want to use charts and if the line descends use flats. But sometimes it’s better to notate an ascending line with flats, if it follows a particular scale using flats, for example.\n\nIt’s absolutely not necessary for the notated pitch in a horn part to match what is considered correct for the chord. Avoid this:\n\nThe trombone part above is an Eb and then a measure later a D#. Best to keep the notated pitch consistent. Here’s another example of what to avoid.\n\nThe A# above should be notated as a Bb. Doing so keeps the whole phrase with flats, making it much easier to read.\n\nThis trombone part needs a courtesy accidental on the F# on count 4. The trombonists who have played this chart before remember, but almost every time a new player sight reads this chart that accidental gets missed.\n\nI should have marked a rehearsal marking at the double bar above. I meant to, I just forgot and it got left out. This particular excerpt is a solo section that can be opened for more soloists and indications for backgrounds at different times. A rehearsal letter there allows the music director to be clearer on when players should cover background figures in the rehearsal or just by calling an audible on the show.\n\nConfusing Rhythmic Notation\n\nConsider the above excerpt again and notice the off beat quarter notes are written so that the middle of the measure is obscured. In 4/4 meter it is best to notate the rhythms to break up the middle of the measure clearly.\n\nThis example shows how I prefer to both rhythmically notate off beat figures as well as the articulations I like to use. It is unambiguous that the quarter notes should be played short and accented, with the roof-top accents. The second measure of the example clearly divides the measure into half and clearly shows the upbeats. Compare the following three measure, ALL would be played the same, but the last measure is easier to sight read.\n\nThe first measure is harder to read because all the short quarter notes fall on the offbeats and it is harder to tell where the middle of the measure is. You could notate it like this:\n\nBut that also is harder to sight read than the 3rd measure above. The tie across the middle of the measure does break up the middle of the measure rhythmically, which is better than notating as a quarter note. But ties like that will tend to get played too long on a quick read, even if the articulation marking is correct. If you want full value quarter notes it would be find, but I would still mark tentuto articulations above all the quarter notes because it will otherwise not be clear.\n\nThe second measure and third measure are both the same, excepting the beaming. I rarely see beams across rests as it shows in the second measure above (especially in jazz notation) and feel that beaming across rests like this is harder to read than if you notate it like the third measure.\n\nThe above excerpt is confusing because what we see above isn’t 3 and 1/2 beats of rest followed by the two 16th notes. Those 16th notes before A are pickups. Most of the band in this chart have a measure of rest before A. When the pickups aren’t written correctly it can lead to much confusion from the band and make for a sloppy start to your chart. Arrangers need to correctly notate pickup beats so that the rests are eliminated from the parts. Parts that don’t cover the pickup beats should have the specific pickup notated as a rest, but not the additional rests. See the following example.\n\nPoorly Notated Rhythm Section Parts\n\nHorn players should take some time to study rhythm section parts and be sure to give those musicians all the information they need to be able to sight read the chart well. Very often these parts are just a sea of slash notation without much information. Rhythm section players need to have dynamics, cues, rhythmic hits, articulations, style changes, etc. written clearly into their parts.\n\nThe above image is a longer excerpt from a drum part that shows some examples of decent notation, but there are also some things that need to be fixed. One thing I tried to do is make it obvious how the phrases line up, each system of music is 8 measure long and is easy to follow. Letter J and K above I could have put the numbers of measures played above to make it even more obvious that it is an 8 measure phrase.\n\nThe spacing of the above excerpt needs cleaning up. The rehearsal letters and measure numbers overlap for K and L, making it harder to tell what they say. Also notice that the dynamic marking for the measure before L should be pushed up a bit off the hits on the system below. The spacing with some of the measures is odd so that the slash notation ended up being spaced strangely.\n\nSomething I’ve seen other arrangers do for drum parts is to have something that looks a bit like a multi-measure rest with indication to play time for that number of measure. It’s a bit awkward to put that together in Finale, the software I use, but I have done that in the past and really should do so more often. It goes a long way to making a drum part easier to read and fewer pages.\n\nAgain, the hits the drummer needs to know about are notated up on the top of the staff, but I also notated some hits on the bottom of the staff. The hits on the bottom happen in the low end of the horns, so I notated them that way to make it clearer to the drummer that the hits in those spots happens between different ranges. Here’s another example from a different chart.\n\nWhen I write specific notes and rhythms on a piano (or guitar) part I will usually also provide chord symbols for them. The musician might not play the exact voicing I want, but with the chord symbols provided they can more easily play the top note of the voicing and then play the rhythm you want. Another way of writing this, if you want your musician to come up with their own voicings, is to simply write the top note of the voicing and chord symbols with the text “T.N.O.V.” above.\n\nBut in the above example I wanted the pianist to play exactly what was written because it matches what the trombone section is playing later (and also at the same time in different parts of the chart).\n\nThree problems with this excerpt. There is a dynamic marking missing at J and while it may seem obvious when you consider what happens before it and what the rest of the band is doing, but it is supposed to be soft. In retrospect I would notate the 3rd measure so that the quarter not is instead an 8th note followed by a rest. In this particular section the rhythm section drops out and the horns play without them, which in retrospect I might have notated with “rhythm out” written above the first measure.\n\nLearn Accepted Notation Practice\n\nEntire books have been written on notation and music engraving, but you don’t need to purchase an expensive book to improve your abilities at notating your music. Studying published scores and parts is helpful here. There are also many excellent internet resources to help less experienced composers and arrangers learn how to properly notate your music.\n\nLaying out your scores and individual parts is probably one of the more tedious parts of being a composer and arranger, but it’s a skill that is more than worth the effort it takes. Be aware that it will take longer than you anticipate, so you really can’t just print out your parts when the composing and arranging work is done and expect that the musicians are going to do your music justice. Poorly written sheet music will sound worse with musicians sight reading. It takes valuable rehearsal time to make corrections to parts or for musicians to ask questions because their parts aren’t clear.\n\nNo matter how wonderful and creative your original music is, it won’t sound good if the musicians don’t fully understand how it is supposed to be played on their first read through. This is even more important if the musicians need to sight read the music on the gig or if they have limited rehearsal time to learn it.\n\nI recently got an email from a trumpet player, Lee, who reminded me about a topic I’ve been meaning to blog about for a while. In his email about a different topic Lee mentioned that the range requirements for trumpet player are more demanding than that of trombone. While on the surface this could be correct, I’m not so certain that this is really true. There certainly is a lot more nuance that goes beyond how high each of those instruments are expected to play. There’s also the range where these instruments spend the most time playing as well as the length of time in a given performance. Of course that’s going to depend also on the style of the music and what the individual piece is. It’s really hard to quantify this and often it gets framed as which brass instrument is harder to play, which is not really a useful argument.\n\nRegardless, as someone who has spent a lot of time studying scores of great composers and arrangers I’ve noticed that the playing demands placed on different brass instruments are not always comparable. A phrase played on a Bb trumpet in a particular range is going to have a completely different quality if played an octave lower on a trombone. A trombonist pasting out an F above high Bb can sound exciting, but it doesn’t have quite the same punch as the equivalent G above high C on trumpet. Then we also need to consider how much a particular brass part plays on a given piece of music. If I were asked to play a NOLA brass band style sousaphone part in the equivalent range on tenor trombone or euphonium I think I would be gassed by the end of one set, maybe sooner. Good arrangers come to an understanding of what good brass players are capable of and write parts accordingly.\n\nAre there some ways to objectively look at the playing demands placed on different brass instruments? Maybe, but all the ways I can think of have their limitations. Still, I find this an interesting thought experiment and did some “back of the envelope” analysis to see if I could come up with anything that might tease out an understanding.\n\nWhile I’m not really a brass doubler, I do find it useful to practice trumpet from time to time and while I was a student, particularly in high school, I played all the brass instruments in different ensembles. I also taught all the brass instruments for a while back when I was teaching at Adams State College and ended up working on my chops on all the brass to try to be able to keep up with my students. But honestly, I found it more effective to simply transpose and play along on trombone with my students on other brass instruments because it provided a better model. I’m providing this background simply to point out that I’m not completely inexperienced on every brass instrument, but also to acknowledge that I’m only expert on trombone (and some might argue not even on that). My background as a composer and arranger writing for brass might be more relevant, since I’ve had a chance to discover through trial and error what works well for different brass.\n\nSuggested Ranges – Orchestral\n\nThe easiest way to look at the demands on brass range I could think of was to look at orchestration and arranging sources to see what is recommended by experts. Are trumpet players generally required to play a greater range than tubists? Which brass instrument seems to require the widest range or the highest range? For my purposes in this post I’m going to focus on trumpet and trombone in particular, but also discuss tuba and French horn when I have some info to share.\n\nOne of the first books I was assigned as an undergrad for scoring music was The Study of Orchestration, by Samuel Adler. I have the 2nd edition, so your copy might be different. If you’re not familiar with this text, it is largely concerned with orchestral arranging, so these ranges might seem a little smaller if you compare this to big band playing.\n\nBb Trumpet\n\nThis text suggests a range of 2 octaves and a minor 6th for trumpet. The highest recommended note is the 9th partial. The Adler text also helpfully describes the characteristics of the registers for each instruments. For trumpet it describes the lowest written F# to the B above as “rather dull,” the middle C to A above the staff as “clear bright and most articulate,” and B above the staff to the D above the staff as “brilliant but strident.”\n\nFrench Horn\n\nHorn is a different animal than the other brass instruments. The fundamental pitch of the instrument is actually lower than a trombone, but they tend to be scored on higher sounding pitches. The range demands on a horn are larger than on the other brass, Adler recommends a playable range of just under 4 octaves. We are cautioned, however, that the lower register are difficult and to be avoided in fast passages. Written C below middle C up to G below middle C is described as “dark and may be a bit unfocused.” Above that to written middle C is “deep and solid.” From there to G on top of the treble clef staff is “bright and heroic” and above that is “brilliant and loud.” The highest suggested note is way up in the partials and I’m too lazy to count and figure it out. If you’re a horn player help me out in the comments.\n\nTenor Trombone\n\nThe suggested range for a tenor trombone is 2 octaves and a diminished 5th, a whole step smaller than trumpet, but then Adler provides some additional upper register notes in the parenthesis. Adler writes, “Theoretically, the quarter notes . . . are possible, and many professional players can play them, but they are difficult and risky.” If we included the highest note in the above suggested range the tenor trombone has a range of 3 octaves and a minor 2nd. The lowest pitch up to the G on the bottom of the bass clef staff is described as “dark and rather nondescript.” From there to the F above the bass clef staff is labeled as “very strong.” G above the bass clef to the Bb whole note in the tenor clef above is “very intense.” The highest suggested whole note is the 8th partial.\n\nTuba\n\nAdler’s suggested range for writing for tuba is 3 octaves and a major 2nd, but it is covered in the text that tubists will often play instruments pitched in different keys. The lowest suggested pitch above, F, to the Bb two ledger lines below the staff is described as sounding “deep and heavy.” From the C below the staff to E in the staff is indicated as sounding “very strong” and above that is “getting weaker but quite intense.” The highest recommended pitch for tuba is the 13th partial, I think.\n\n“Winner of the Range Contest”\n\nIt’s not a contest, but the horn wins with almost 4 octaves. Tuba comes in second with 3 octaves and a major 2nd. Trumpet and trombone are about the same, roughly 2 and 1/2 octaves, depending on which pitch you go with for the highest recommended note on trombone.\n\nSuggested Range – Big Band\n\nFor suggested ranges for big band writing I grabbed Nelson Riddle’s text, Arranged by Nelson Riddle. I’ve got several good books on arranging for big band, this just happened to be the first one that I grabbed off my shelf.\n\nTrumpet\n\nThis suggested range is very close to Adler’s suggestions. For some reason the lowest note is a half step higher, so 2 octaves and a Perfect 4th. If you know Nelson Riddle’s arranging you know that he would often write his lead trumpet parts higher than suggested.\n\nTrombone\n\nRiddle describes the recommended range of the trombone differently from the trumpet, like Adler. The two notes at the beginning of the above example are almost the same as the equivalent trumpet range, 2 octaves and a diminished 5th. But Riddle also adds some pedal tones (personally, I wouldn’t recommend too many pedals on tenor trombone and the lowest I can think of in classical repertoire is the pedal G in the David Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra.) He clarifies his upper register suggestions as “The upper notes. . . are all practical and easily available to experienced professionals, but younger and weaker lips usually have ‘A’ or ‘Bb’ as a ceiling, and the high ‘D’ in particular seems to be the starting note of a kind of ‘stratosphere’ which is closed to all but the very finest players.”\n\nFrench Horn\n\nRiddles range suggestions for horn are difficult to follow. The above image is a recreation of what is in the book, but there’s not much description on what all that means. He covers the French horn in his chapter on woodwinds and then later in the chapter on brass. I may be missing a complete discussion on what ranges he recommends for horn, since I’m skimming.\n\nTuba\n\nRiddle’s suggested range for tuba is a bit smaller than Adler’s, 3 octaves total.\n\n“Winner of the Range Contest”\n\nAgain, not a contest, but at least according to Riddle the tuba “wins” at 3 octaves. I won’t attempt a guess as to what he feels is the playable range for the horn. The trombone might be considered to eke out the trumpet a hair. That said, I tend to think of the playable ranges of trumpet and trombone as being equivalent to each other (for professional players), but with some caveats that I mentioned earlier and that I’ll get into now.\n\nPlaying Demand Comparisons – Big Band Lead Trumpet and Lead Trombone\n\nSomething important for composers and arrangers to consider when writing for brass is how much time the players spend actually playing and how much rest they get in a given piece. Nelson Riddle notes, “The brass section should be used for punctuation and support, and should not be given the sustained passages you would assign to string players, who can saw away for hours without rippling a muscle or generating one drop of perspiration.”\n\nSince most of my own writing and much of my playing is for big band, I’m most familiar with that repertoire. One thing I’ve noticed with most of the great arrangers is that the trumpets generally are used more sparingly than the trombone section. I think there are two main practical reasons why. First, the lead trumpet part in the upper register is often saved for the exciting shout chorus and it’s helpful to give the trumpet section a chance to rest a bit before they are required to play up there. Secondly, the range of the trombone section alone is a bit more rich and solid sounding than a the trumpet section up an octave by themselves. While there are certainly times when the trumpet section can carry a passage on their own, it’s more common for that section to be blended with the saxophone or trombone section. You don’t have to go very high before 4 trumpets alone start to sound “tinny” whereas the trombone section voiced an octave below is in a range that sounds rich and clear.\n\nBut I wanted to come up with a more objective way to measure my impressions here. I grabbed a chart out of my own library, A Little Minor Booze by Willie Maiden, written for the Stan Kenton Orchestra. I figured something out of the Kenton library might make for a representative sample of what is expected in modern big band playing. I looked at the lead trumpet and lead trombone parts and worked out a couple of different things that would give us a glimpse into the different playing demands. I worked out the required range for both parts, but also looked at what the average note and median note was for both parts. I also looked at how much of the chart each player would have the metal on the mouth. It’s not really an accurate comparison, a quarter note playing a 6th partial concert F isn’t as demanding as playing that same pitch for a whole note. Controlling for that sort of variable is too much work for a blog post (and just guess at how much effort it took to write this post already), but I think it could be done if someone was interested enough.\n\nHere are the results using some charts to compare.\n\nFollowing this chart takes some explaining. In order to easily calculate these numbers I assigned the number 1 to the concert E below the staff for both trumpet and trombone (the lowest recommended non-pedal tone note for both). The F above that was assigned the number 2 and so on, all the way up to the written “double C” on trumpet at number 43. Here’s another way to look at this data.\n\nLowest Pitch Played\n\nLead Trumpet (written)\n\nLead Trombone\n\nThe lead trombone part was required to play the equivalent of an octave lower than the lead trumpet part.\n\nHighest Pitch Played\n\nLead Trumpet (written)\n\nLead Trombone\n\nOn the second to last measure the lead trumpet has to play a “double C.” This is a major 6th higher than the equivalent highest note on the lead trombone part. The lead trumpet part has an entire range of two octaves, the C in the middle of the staff to the C two octaves above. The lead trombone part has an entire range of 2 octaves plus a minor 3rd.\n\nAverage Pitch\n\nLead Trumpet (written)\n\nLead Trombone\n\nThe average pitch for the lead trumpet part came out to a diminished 5th higher than the lead trombone part.\n\nMedian Pitch\n\nLead Trumpet (written)\n\nLead Trombone\n\nThe median pitch, that is the middle between the highest and lowest notes played in both parts, has the lead trumpet part a major 3rd above the lead trombone part.\n\nMode Pitch\n\nLead Trumpet (written)\n\nLead Trombone\n\nThe mode pitch refers to the pitch that occurred most often in the part. The lead trumpet mode note was the equivalent of a Perfect 4th higher than the mode note in the lead trombone part.\n\nMeasures Spent with the Metal on the Mouth\n\nLead Trumpet\n\nLead Trombone\n\nThe entire chart of A Little Minor Booze is 108 measures long (not counting the quarter note pickup). The lead trumpet part has at least one note in 33 measures, compared to the lead trombone part having 53 measures with something to be played.\n\nSummary Impressions\n\nFirst of all, let me make it clear that all the above really doesn’t tell us which brass instrument is the most demanding to play, but it might give the composer/arranger some ideas on what brass are capable of and how to write more idiomatically for those instruments. For big band writing in general, my best guess is that the lead trumpet will typically be required to play higher, but the lead trombone part will be required to play a wider range in general. The trombone section will typically need to play for longer periods of time with less rest, whereas the trumpets, who probably need to play more in the upper side of their range, will get more rest. If you want your trombone parts to be higher than typical you might want to write them with more rests than normal. Likewise, if you want your trumpets to play more throughout your arrangement you should write their range lower than you might otherwise. If you want to look at which instrument is required to play the widest range in general, you can probably assume French horn can cover the most range, followed by tuba, trombone, then trumpet.\n\nMy general thoughts on range capabilities for similarly experienced brass musicians is to pretty much think of them as the same. Take the roughly 2 and 1/2 octaves for trumpet and transpose that down an octave for the range of trombone and euphonium. Drop that down an octave for tuba standard range. Those aren’t perfect, but they will give you a decent idea to work with so that instead of having to memorize ranges for 3 different brass instruments you memorize 1 range and transpose by octaves. French horn, of course, is different and you’ll need to learn their range if you’re going to write for that instrument effectively."
