HORNA remain one of the most productive bands in Finland for over 25 years!

Timely transformations between the typical fast, aggressive black metal and the more depressing, melancholic tones, paired with the cult icon guitarist Shatraug and the band’s never-ending creative potential, have always kept HORNA amongst the country’s key leaders in the extreme metal scene.

This is one of the rare occasions when both the cult demo recordings and the latter full-length albums match the true label like never before. The Finnish quintet’s music has always been accompanied by shadows of negativity and evil, intensity, filth and a chaotic sound.
