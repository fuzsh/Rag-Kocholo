The 'APHOTIC VISIONS'-Tour invites you to explore your true self, to take a look behind the facades of human nature and to find light within sheer endless darkness. Enter the realms of unspeakable gloom and blazing passion!

Finnish Black Metal legends Horna Official, one of the most genuine live acts within the international extreme metal scene, will return to Central Europe with the material of even two remarkably strong new releases and a lot of old classics within their headlining set. The Finnish quintet will be accompanied by a polish collective that had to experience the deepest tracts of hell before rising again stronger than ever. The stirring story behind Blaze of Perdition and the impressive ability to perform highly intense and authentic music made the band one of the most outstanding representatives of nowadays Black Metal underground.

Our seldom seen special guests are coming a long way down from the far north of Norway with the soundtrack of never-ending arctic nights and relentless bleakness: Iskald will exclusively present their eagerly anticipated fifth studio record “Innhøstinga” which will be released at the end of August via Indie Recordings.

Hailing from the opposite end of Europe ALTARAGE will tear down the stage with their energetic and dissonant interpretation of supreme blackened Death Metal. Very little is known about the individuals behind this mysterious Basque association but their music speaks for itself.
