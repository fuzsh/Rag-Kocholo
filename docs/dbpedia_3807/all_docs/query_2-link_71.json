        "text": "First Presbyterian Church\n\nThe church was organized as Villa Rica Presbyterian Church in 1855. A white frame building was constructed on Candler St in 1885 for worship. The building was moved to its current location in 1930 onto property donated by the family of Mr. W. B. Candler who had served as Clerk of Session from 1888 to 1921.\n\nThe structure was bricked and a basement was added for Sunday School rooms. The mahogany pews, pulpit, and the stained glass windows were purchased from Old Wesley Memorial Church in Atlanta when it was torn down. The windows were made from a color formula that has been lost over time, making them irreplaceable antiques. The Candler home, which was situated behind the church building served the church in many capacities before it was torn down in 1998 and replaced with a new fellowship building.\n\nCommercial Historic District\n\nThe North Villa Rica Commercial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 2002. This district includes several blocks of buildings, some dating back to 1875, which were built in the early commercial style.\n\nThe area houses the City of Villa Rica Police Department along with several antique stores, restaurants, and other commercial businesses. The boundary is basically North Avenue, East Gordon St, West Church St, and the Southern Railroad line.\n\nWicks Tavern\n\nThe city was incorporated as Villa Rica in 1881. The name Villa Rica is derived from Spanish for \"rich village\" and the city’s name change was done to help promote the gold in the area.\n\nHixtown and Cheevestown combined to become the new City of Villa Rica. Many of the original structures from Hixtown and Chevestown were physically moved to the new site by rolling them on logs pulled by horses.\n\nWicks Tavern—c. 1830 is the oldest commercial structure in Carroll County. The tavern was built in Hixtown by New York immigrant John B. Wick. Wick's Tavern was a local gathering place for gold miners working area mines in the early 19th century. The building is a classic example of the “Dutch”-style timber framing method. When the Georgia-Pacific Railroad came through town in 1882 and the homes and businesses were moved, the tavern was considered too large to be moved.\n\nIn 1998, the “Friends of Wick’s Tavern” raised the funds necessary and rescued this historic building from being demolished. 100 years later The Wicks Tavern finally got to make its journey to Downtown Villa Rica where it is now a History Museum and the home to the Forrest Escort Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Friends of Wicks Tavern.\n\nTommy Dorsey Landmark\n\nThomas Andrew Dorsey Born July 1, 1899 in Villa Rica was known as \"the father of black gospel music\" and was at one time so closely associated with the field that songs written in the new style were sometimes known as \"dorseys.\" Earlier in his life he was a leading pianist known as Georgia Tom.\n\nHis best known composition, \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\", was performed by Mahalia Jackson and was a favorite of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.. Another composition, \"Peace in the Valley\", was a hit for Red Foley in 1951 and has been performed by dozens of other artists, including Queen of Gospel Albertina Walker, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. Dorsey died in Chicago, aged 93.\n\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress honored his album Precious Lord: New Recordings of the Great Songs of Thomas A. Dorsey (1973), by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry.\n\nFullerville Jail\n\nThe building, which county records say dates to 1828, features one window with iron bars and a single opening that is missing a door. The jail originally was constructed of wood, but it burned down when an inmate set it on fire. It is told that he was saved, and the jail was replaced with the concrete structure to stop any other inmate from burning it again. The concrete jail still stands today.\n\nFullerville—1916-1956—small community northwest of Villa Rica which had several textile mills (notably hosiery). Fullerville was granted a charter in 1916 but returned it to the state in 1956 at the same time allowed the city to be annexed into Villa Rica.\n\nDorough Round Barn and Farm\n\nThe Dorough Round Barn and Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 20, 1980. Located about three miles southwest of Villa Rica on Hickory Level Rd, the farm consists of a 19th-century farmhouse, several other outbuildings and the famous round barn. Built in 1917, the Round Barn is quite significant architecturally due to its circular shape.\n\nThe barn was designed by Floyd Lovell. It had two levels, the upper one smaller than the lower. At the time the barn was added, it was still generally structurally intact. Today, the upper level is now completely gone and the lower level is falling apart as well. The barn is privately owned."
