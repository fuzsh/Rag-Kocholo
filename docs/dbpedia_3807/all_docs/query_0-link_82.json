        "text": "Throughout the past twelve years as The City Menus our team– including me–have enjoyed getting to know people throughout our region. We’ve built professional relationships with many local city leaders, business owners, and educational institutions. Someone whom we frequently called and emailed inquiring about specific community development plans was Janet Hyde. She was such a huge asset to The City Menus and our community. As I learned about her passing, I couldn’t help but sift through countless emails we’ve exchanged over the years from just a simple asking how you are, to asking about construction plans for a retail development or restaurant. She was always there and willing to help. We’ve lost many like her over the years. Those who have made an impact especially on The City Menus will never be forgotten. Thank you, Janet, for your love for helping others.\n\nBelow is a message from Carroll County Government that will share more about Janet in greater detail:\n\n“We were saddened to learn of former County Planner Janet Hyde’s passing. Janet began serving as the County Planner for Community Development in 2017 and was appointed to the Board of Directors for the Georgia Association of Zoning Administrators in 2021. She was assigned to keep track of the Listserve database where members can reach out and request assistance with ordinances and policies and receive input from other jurisdictions.\n\nJanet was a graduate of Carrollton High School and the University of West Georgia with a Bachelor’s Degree in Philosophy (Pre-Law) and a Master’s of Science in Rural and Small Town Planning. Prior to working for the Carroll County Board of Commissioners she served the City of Villa Rica as the Community Development Director. Janet also served on the Board of Directors of Keep Carroll Beautiful and was on the MPA Advisory Board at the University of West Georgia for several years. She was also a past Board member for the Georgia Planning Association.\n\nJanet’s infectious smile and infinite wisdom will be sorely missed throughout Carroll County and although she had been out of the workplace for a while due to her health, our staff never stopped checking on her and doing things to brighten her days and provide support to her family, as she would have done for any of us. Please join us in prayer for Janet’s family and friends as they face tough days ahead.”"
