While there is no one sentence to explain what Georgia Collaborative does, the tag line says it all, “Helping People Help Others”.\n\nIn 1990, Georgians embraced Governor Zell Miller’s challenge to invest in public-private partnerships and collaboration after the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s inaugural KIDS COUNT Data Book ranked Georgia 48th in the nation in child well-being.\n\nGeorgia is the only state in the nation that has consistently made that kind of investment for over 30 years."
