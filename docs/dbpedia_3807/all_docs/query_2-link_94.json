        "text": "Self-management is a comprehensive job to take on as a volunteer. It can become a full-time job and can take away from the enjoyment of simply living in your community. A manager relieves some of those duties by managing the day-to-day affairs.\n\nFor individual members to provide mandated services free of charge, it places unequal burdens on themselves and other homeowners. No one wants to have to tell their neighbor that they need to mow their yard!\n\nAdditionally, dealing with items such as insurance, contractors, maintenance, enforcement and legal issues will cost an inexperienced volunteer an extensive amount of time and labor. Our job is to provide these services and we are professionally trained on how to handle them.\n\nOf course, professionally managed communities retain their growth in attractiveness to potential buyers, which results in higher property values. Who doesn’t want that?\n\nAssociation management is hard work! It involves many facets such as financial management, physical property management, and administrative management, among other tasks. Professional community managers have processes in place to make management more efficient and reliable.\n\nBoard members can change from year to year and having a manager will ensure that the new board starts off where the old board left off. It will also ensure that the new board is trained to handle their responsibilities. We work with the Board to put together Policies and Procedures for each of our neighborhoods to make sure that things remain consistent when Board Members change.\n\nAs you can see, the benefits of using a community manager to help with association management are endless. These are only some of the reasons why community management is more efficient over self-management. We would like to meet with you to discuss managing your community and what we can offer your association!\n\nTolley Community Management offers full service community management including but not limited to financial management, property management and administrative management.\n\nWe utilize the latest accounting software designed exclusively for associations. We prepare and maintain the books and records necessary to produce financial statements.\n\nWe work with the board of directors to assist in the development and preparation of the annual association operating budget.\n\nWe receive, review and approve vendor invoices and all other association bills and prepare checks for payment.\n\nWe collect all assessments as they become due and deposit all cash receipts into the association bank account maintained at a FDIC insured banking institution.\n\nWe offer payment coupons for associations whose dues are monthly and we have a direct debit option eliminating the need to write a check each month and pay for postage.\n\nWe will maintain a record of homeowner accounts and will discuss monthly delinquencies with the board members and send out monthly late notices.\n\nWe will assist with legal counsel as necessary to initiate required legal action consistent with the association’s by-laws.\n\nWe will work with contractors in a competitive bidding process for non-emergency services and will offer our input when selecting a contractor while remaining “vendor neutral” which enables competitive rates. We ensure that all of our contractors have relevant certificates of insurance.\n\nWe will perform regular site inspections in order to maintain a satisfactory knowledge of the condition of the association and the performance of the contractors. We will look for violations of the covenants, obvious repair issues, maintenance needs and overall condition.\n\nWe will respond quickly to any emergency situation 24 hours a day 7 days a week. We promptly respond to non-emergency related issues during normal business hours Monday – Friday between 9-5pm.\n\nWe will receive and investigate significant complaints regarding rule violations.\n\nWe assist and advise the board in correspondence between residents, owners, contractors, etc. We keep a record of all client correspondence received or issued.\n\nThese are just some of the services that Tolley Community Management management can offer your association. Please watch our community management video and do not hesitate to contact us for more information."
