        "text": "The GA city government in Carroll & Douglas Counties selects GovPilot as provider of cloud-based government management software to streamline operations and constituent services.\n\nVilla Rica; July 15, 2023 - Villa Rica, GA has opted to implement digital citizen concern reporting to enhance constituent and government communications regarding community issues. In collaboration with GovPilot, a government management software provider based in New Jersey, the municipality of Caroll and Douglas County established a partnership enabling community members to report non-emergency issues to the local government through the villarica.org website and GovPilot’s user-friendly report-a-concern mobile app.\n\nVilla Rica's government officials are teaming up with GovPilot to establish a direct line of communication between citizens and the municipality. This collaboration aims to enable citizens to provide valuable input on community improvement and address various issues effectively.\n\nThe municipality’s 17,830 residents can now officially use citizen concern reporting software to submit complaints online on the township’s website or via the GovAlert mobile app which is available on the App Store and Google Play. The municipal government officially deployed the feature to its government website with the support of the GovPilot onboarding team to improve constituent lives and community safety.\n\nThe most frequently reported complaints include code violations and infrastructure issues such as fallen trees, potholes, etc. Whenever a concern is submitted through the app or a government official, it gets forwarded to the appropriate department's officials for documentation and resolution.\n\nMichael Bonner, GovPilot CEO, was quoted saying, “it has been an honor working with Villa Rica as they make their government digital transformation. By opting into digital concern reporting, the city government is giving citizens the means to ensure their voices are being heard while simultaneously making it easier for city officials to address non-emergency issues.”\n\nAdditional GovPilot government software solutions deployed by the municipality in recent months is our construction software module for digital permit licensing, streamlined inspections and access to GIS mapping/data. Deploying digital citizen issue reporting is an additional key step in strengthening the relationship between Villa Rica residents and their municipal government.\n\nAre you a local government official or employee?
