        "text": "Welcome to Our Web Site\n\nOur Mission is to promote genealogical research among members of our society and the Carroll County Georgia community.\n\nThe genealogy research room at Neva Lomason Library houses a collection of books, family histories, microfilm and microfilm readers, and an extensive collection of genealogy periodicals. Volunteers are available to assist you in Special Collection on Wednesdays.\n\nThe Genealogical Society meets January, April, July and October on the fourth Thursday. We offer programs and a discussion time following each program where genealogists can meet and talk with other researchers. We offer workshops on the 4th Saturdays in March and September. In addition to the serious work, we enjoy a family picnic in June and a Christmas party in December.\n\nOur Library Committee maintains the wonderful Special Collections Room at the Neva Lomason Library in Carrollton. Society Volunteers are on hand there every Wednesday to assist patrons searching family records.\n\nWe are in the midst of a huge project downloading and digitizing obituaries from Carroll County paper from the late 1800â€™s to the present. An index of these will be stored on our wonderful website and available to the public. This project offers a great way for our members to be productive and a major part of the program of the Society.\n\nWe invite you to learn more about us by joining our society, or visit one of our meetings."
