I'm curious because the Tallapoosa River and Little Tallapoosa River originate there (or at least run through it), and I've been mucking around the Tallapoosa on the 'bama side of the state line looking for stippled studfish, Fundulus bifax. Three of us are going there tomorrow, along the Cleburne and Randolph county lines, to check out some tribs to the Little Tallapoosa for stippleds. I'm curious as to any observations; Google Earth images show the 'bama side of the line to be full of commercial poultry houses, usually the kiss of death to local streams due to nutrient enrichment.\n\nHow depressing. Makes me ashamed to be human.\n\nEdited by birdpond, 06 August 2008 - 01:36 AM.\n\nWow.. that looks awful.\n\nManage to catch any carp? I'm sure the locals would be impressed.\n\nNah, no carp this time, but then we didn't try.\n\nBruce,\n\nFWIW, I've sampled several sites in Carroll Co., in 2000, 2001, and 2003 -- mostly looking for sculpins and darters via backpack electrofisher. These included sites on Buck Creek; Dog River (sites at and downstream of Liberty Rd had heavy sediment deposits); Snake Creek; Unnamed trib to Little Tallapoosa River ca. 1 mi E of Victory; Mountain Creek; and Turkey Creek. I did not collect any studfish, but as I was likely focused on getting sufficient sculpins, I may not have been working appropriate habitat (though I usually make an effort to sample everything at a site...). All downstream sections were degraded, but the higher up you go the better many of these systems get. That doesn't bode well for studfish, though...\n\nDave\n\nThanks Dave, that's what I figured was the likely condition. Stippled studfish are more habitat specific than most fishes, which is of course why they've apparently disappeared from about half of their range. Brett Albanese and others didn't find them in historic sites in GA several years ago, so the best interpretation is that they're extirpated in GA."
