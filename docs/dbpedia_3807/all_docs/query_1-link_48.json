Code enforcement said this is lady that complains about everything and everyone. This lady has also taken the fresh eggs from my parents chickens in the past when she needed them. How rude is this this for her NOW to complain about mine and she is across the street. With several dogs may I add!\n\nbargain\n\nLove God, Hubby &amp; farm\n\nApr 13, 2008\n\n8,372\n\n426\n\n326\n\nBowdon, GA\n\nare you in city limits??? of carrollton or another city... If yes, they may have ordinances. Check there first...\n\nlovin'my12chicks\n\nIn the Brooder\n\nApr 25, 2011\n\n19\n\n0\n\n22\n\nWe live outside city limits in Sand Hill. I'll find out Wednesday what I will have to do, if anything. I also would like to come and see what all you sell. If possible, we would like to get a few more maybe in the spring. Thanks for the advice.\n\nAnnaafranqueza\n\nSongster\n\nJun 30, 2019\n\n138\n\n176\n\n121\n\nAny news on what happened? I just moved to carroll county (outside city limits) and got 4 chickens. All my neighbors know and donâ€™t mind but just curious! I live in a subdivision (no HOA)"
