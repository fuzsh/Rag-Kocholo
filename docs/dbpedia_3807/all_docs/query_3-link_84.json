If Mother Nature located convenient to I-20 doesn't win you over, then sample Fairfield Plantation's numerous amenities. Enjoy a round of golf followed by lunch at the Golf and Country Club. Spend the day boating on the lake and relaxing on the beach followed by drinks at Dockside Marina Restaurant and Bar. Endulge in weekend meandering along the walking and nature trails. Entertain the kids at the recreation center and playground.\n\nLive Life to the Fullest - Relax, Play, Visit, Reside."
