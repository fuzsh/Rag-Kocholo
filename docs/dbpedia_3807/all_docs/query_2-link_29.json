With a population of 18,452 people and seven associated neighborhoods, Villa Rica is the 64th largest community in Georgia. Villa Rica has seen a significant amount of newer housing growth in recent years. Quite often, new home construction is the result of new residents moving in who are middle class or wealthier, attracted by jobs, a healthy local economy, or other amenities as they leave nearby or far away areas for greener pastures. This seems to be the case in Villa Rica, where the median household income is $82,373.00.\n\nOne downside of living in Villa Rica is that it can take a long time to commute to work.
