It serves the communities of Bowdon, two thirds of unincorporated Bremen, Mount Zion, Roopville, Temple, Villa Rica, and Whitesburg.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nDrug testing\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015 the district announced that it will begin randomly drug test students at its high schools; students may be drug tested if they participate in extracurricular programs, including athletic and non-athletic ones, and persons who drive automobiles to school.[3]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nSuperintendent hiring practices controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2022, the school board voted to renew the contract of superintendent Scott Cowart, however, this vote was divided with three of the seven board members voting against, citing a lack of diversity and equity in hiring practices by Cowart and his failure to give due notice to the board of his intention to renew his contract. Cowart has served as superintendent since 2010.[4]\n\nUnreserved fund balance\n\n[edit]\n\nA candidate for the school board accused the district of maintaining an unreserved fund balance in excess beyond standards set by state law. Candidate Bill Kecskes claimed from personal research that the board maintained a $46,107,371 UFB: 31.28% of the 2022 fiscal year operating budget of $147,405,087. Kecskes also referred to OCGA 20-2-167(a)5 which sets target unreserved fund balances for school boards at \"not less than 12-14% of annual operating expenditures for the subsequent fiscal year budget, not to exceed 15% of the total budget of the subsequent school year\". The superintendent denied the claims made by Kecskes and stated the numbers were only targets as opposed to legal mandates.[5]\n\nSchools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Carroll County School District has twelve elementary schools, six middle schools, and five high schools.[6]\n\nElementary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nBowdon Elementary School\n\nCentral Elementary School\n\nGlanton-Hindsman Elementary School\n\nIthica Elementary School\n\nMount Zion Elementary School\n\nProvidence Elementary School\n\nRoopville Elementary School\n\nSand Hill Elementary School\n\nSharp Creek Elementary School\n\nTemple Elementary School\n\nVilla Rica Elementary School\n\nWhitesburg Elementary School\n\nMiddle schools\n\n[edit]\n\nBay Springs Middle School\n\nBowdon Middle School\n\nCentral Middle School\n\nMount Zion Middle School\n\nTemple Middle School\n\nVilla Rica Middle School\n\nHigh schools\n\n[edit]\n\nBowdon High School\n\nCentral High School\n\nMount Zion High School\n\nTemple High School\n\nVilla Rica High School\n\nPerforming Arts Center\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Carroll County Schools Performing Arts Center was opened in 2017 to accommodate various needs of the school district. Designed as a music hall, the school system claims the venue as \"the most acoustically calibrated facility in the western portion of Georgia\". The auditorium can seat up to 1,100 people and hosts multiple side rooms for district staff meetings and exhibitions.[7]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCarrollton City School District\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
