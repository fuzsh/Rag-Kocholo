        "text": "I first moved to Villa Rica in 2020 and I was a bit curious to see if this new place will be good. I was a high school junior, and I was unsure if I wanted to go to college. As I kept going to school and other stores in Villa Rica, I realized that this was truly a good opportunity to get to know people, hear their experiences, and be part of a community regardless of race. This a very knitted community dedicated to helping one another and passersby. One thing I would love to change about Villa Rica is the gardens on the roadside. Planting fresh flowers to enhance the beauty of Villa Rica, the home of the rich.\n\nI've only been a resident of Villa Rica for a few months now. It's a good area to live because there isn't much traffic. Only when the roadway is backed up or when there is a wreck is there substantial traffic. I believe it is an excellent area to raise a family, and the educational system appears to be adequate.\n\nSmall town near Atlanta, friendly, great cost of living. I have lived here all my life and have enjoyed the simple life style with access to all the amenities Atlanta offers. With Atlanta just a sort drive living Villa Rica gives one the best of both worlds."
