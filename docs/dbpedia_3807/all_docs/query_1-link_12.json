        "text": "I've been living in Carrollton for 8 years and over time, I can tell you things have changed . From the safety in our community to the outrageous cost of living . This is a college town occupied by University of West Georgia graduates and their children. This town is not receptive to progressive ideas and its an major issue in my consideration. Not to mention the upgrades we can use with in; the justice system , incorporating more places for children, establishing small businesses and hosting events to come together as an community to help build this place for many more generations to come. Is just the icing to the cake. Yes Carrollton is a nice place to live in life but within the cracks of Carrollton I honestly wouldn't recommend this place to any one who wants to make something out in life."
