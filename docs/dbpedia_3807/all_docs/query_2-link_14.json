It's in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, so you'll find rolling hills around. The area has a mild climate, but get ready for hot summers and mild winters. Sometimes, there are thunderstorms in summer.\n\nThe economy in Atlanta is strong. It's home to many big companies in different industries like finance, technology, healthcare, and more.
