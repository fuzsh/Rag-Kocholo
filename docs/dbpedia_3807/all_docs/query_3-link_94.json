From that first garden, we have committed to not only its nurturing, but the nurturing of boys and girls, moms and dads in the surrounding area. You will see and experience garden images that remind us of the first Garden, the Garden of Eden, as well as the Garden that Jesus prayed for God's will, the Garden of Gethsemane.\n\nIt is our prayer that as we are rooted in God's word we will be fed and cultivated by the Holy Spirit into the lives that God has planned for us. We hope you will be planted with us.\n\nIf you visit VRFUMC for corporate celebration services or a cluster group, you can expect a hospitable environment prepared for you. Youâll probably find someone just like you. You will see people wearing jeans or suits. You will see young and old. You will see people of different skin tones. You will find singles and families. You will see people who have loved God their whole lives and those who question the Christian faith."
