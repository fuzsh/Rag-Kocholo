        "text": "But the gamble paid off. \"Maverick\" made $1.495 billion at the box office, beating every superhero movie, \"Jurassic World: Dominion\" and \"Minions: The Rise of Gru\" to become the second-highest-grossing movie of 2022.\n\n\"Maverick\" also won an Oscar, became a culture icon, and boosted the fame of rising stars Glen Powell and Miles Teller.\n\nSince 2022, there have been talks of another \"Top Gun\" movie, including reports of a spinoff focusing on Teller's Rooster character.\n\nDuring a live taping of the \"Happy Sad Confused\" podcast, published on Monday, Powell said he had \"a date\" for the sequel.\n\nPowell didn't specify whether this was a release date for the film or a date to start production, and he refused to give any other details.\n\nHowever, this is the closest fans have got to a confirmation that \"Top Gun 3\" is coming.\n\nRepresentatives for Powell, Cruise, and Paramount Pictures did not immediately respond to a comment request from Business Insider.\n\nConsidering the success of \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" another sequel could be a big win for Paramount, Cruise, and all the stars involved. Here's what has been reported so far.\n\n\"Top Gun 3\" could focus on Teller's character Rooster.\n\nAround the time \"Maverick\" was released, Teller was very vocal about another Top Gun sequel.\n\nTeller joined the franchise in \"Maverick\" as naval pilot Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, the son of Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), who died in the first \"Top Gun\" movie.\n\nCruise's character, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, blames himself for the death of Goose, meaning there is tension between Maverick and Rooster in the sequel. But the pair make up by the end of the film.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn May 2022, Teller told ScreenRant that he was pitching a spinoff based on Rooster, though it's unclear if that will happen.\n\n\"Obviously, everybody was begging Tom to do a sequel right after the first one came out,\" Teller said. \"I think this movie puts a nice bow on it; it really kind of wraps it up, but we'll see. I'm available.\"\n\nTeller also told Entertainment Tonight in July that he has talked to Cruise about making another sequel but didn't say if Cruise supported the idea.\n\nCruise, Powell, and Teller would likely return for another 'Top Gun' sequel\n\nPuck, Deadline, and Variety reported in January that \"Top Gun 3\" was in the works.\n\nThe three publications, citing unnamed sources, said Paramount has enlisted \"Maverick\" co-writer Ehren Kruger to start work on the next sequel. Variety reported that Kruger had begun writing the script last year, and Cruise and Paramount needed to sign off on the final draft.\n\nCruise, Powell, and Teller were also reportedly expected to reprise their roles in the movie.\n\nDeadline and Puck also reported that \"Maverick\" producers Jerry Bruckheimer and David Ellison will return for the sequel. \"Maverick\" Director Joseph Kosinski will either direct or produce the new film.\n\nJudging by Powell's recent comments, he will likely return for the sequel. The only question left is whether Cruise and Teller will join him."
