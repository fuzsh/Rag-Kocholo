        "text": "Last Thursday was the UK Premiere of Top Gun Maverick (a Royal one no less) and while the cast and royalty gathered in Central London for their screening, around the UK, at the same time, screenings took place in IMAX cinemas. I’ve been excited for this film since production was announced and I wasn’t going to miss the chance to see it a week early! Although I wasn’t old enough to see the original when it opened in 1986, I loved watching it as a kid (I even had the NES Top Gun game, which I was terrible at!), so this has been one of my most anticipated films in years. I had high expectations, which were raised once the first responses to the film started to come out and yet Top Gun Maverick still managed to exceed them. It’s honestly just that impressive and crucially, it isn’t just because of the aerial sequences. It is a strong film on so many levels and that’s why, for me anyway, it also surpasses the original film.\n\nA strong story that has very real stakes that is superbly directed\n\nThis film could easily have just been all about the spectacle, but Tom Cruise, alongside the screenwriters (who include his MI collaborator Christopher MQuarrie) have clearly spent a lot of time crafting a multi-layered story that grounds the aerial spectacle in a world you become invested in. This isn’t a story pretending that Tom Cruise is still young and instead embraces the fact that Pete “Maverick” Mitchell is older, a little adrift, has clearly still not got over the pain of the loss of his friend Goose in the original movie and who is now also confronted with his superiors telling him he is a relic from the past, surplus to requirements in their modern, technologically advanced age. And yet, he’s soon ordered back to Top Gun to train the new best of the best for a dangerous, covert mission, which many think is impossible (hang on, isn’t that another franchise!). Crucially, the script ensures we understand what is being asked of them, what it will require of them and just how high the stakes are as a result of that. It ensures you feel invested in the story and its outcome from very early on. Not only do we get a thrill ride of an action film, but there are also nerve-shredding sequences that feel part heist film, blended with a quite moving exploration of grief, guilt, family and love and how all of those things hit differently as you get older. It would’ve been unrealistic for Maverick to be the same personality he was 36 years ago and the progression of him feels very realistic and is fascinating to explore.\n\nJoseph Kosinski has done a superb job with his directing choices for this film. Yes, the shots achieved from the IMAX quality cameras in the jets are incredible and the aerial photography as a whole is just insanely creative, but on top of that, every frame is beautifully shot and also lit by cinematographer Claudio Miranda.\n\nCharacters that are developed to ensure we care about them and their success\n\nThe film has assembled a strong cast of both younger and more established actors and with regards to this new Top Gun class (with some fun echoes to the original Top Gun class of 1986), we really get to see who they all are, what their personalities are like and how, for better or worse, the bounce off one another, creating some fun dynamics as they learn to become a team. Building in that element, the story ensures we are invested in the outcome of their mission and more importantly their safety, which is clearly not guaranteed.\n\nAfter Cruise, Miles Teller has the biggest role as Rooster, whose complicated relationship with Maverick is a big part of the story and of the motivations of each of their characters and Teller does a great job conveying the complexities of that relationship, one that Rooster himself clearly struggles to handle. Monica Barbaro is great as Phoenix, who as the only female fighter pilot in the class easily holds her own alongside the boys, bringing the film in to the 21st century. Glen Powell is also a highlight as Hangman, the one in the group who reminds you of Iceman. Yet the story has time to give characters like his time to develop in a satisfying way across the film. In fact I found all of the pilots in the class, each contribute something to the story and I really liked them as a group.\n\nAlongside the younger pilots there are also great supporting performances from Ed Harris and Jon Hamm as Maverick’s superiors, who seem both constantly frustrated by him, while begrudgingly respecting his clear talent. I also loved Bashir Salahuddin’s Hondo, whose friendship with Maverick adds a nice dynamic and also some humorous moments. Then of course there is Val Kilmer’s Iceman, who continues to be a presence in his friend Maverick’s life and who still has a role to play. For those fans concerned Kilmer’s role in this film would be limited to just references and a photo on a wall, no spoilers as to the content, but rest assured he is in the film and his presence is handled beautifully. Indeed one of my favourite scenes in this film is between Kilmer and Cruise.\n\nA romance that feels very authentic\n\nAnother element of the story that I really enjoyed and felt was handled really well, was the relationship between Maverick and Penny Benjamin (Top Gun fans will probably recognise her name!), played by Jennifer Connelly. These are two people of similar age (no love interest half Cruise’s age here), who have lived their own lives, but who also have a shared history and seem to keep being drawn back together. It’s a very authentic and mature romance, in which they are equals and where Maverick finds someone he is able to truly talk to and yet both don’t seem to put expectations on the other. Also Cruise and Connelly have great chemistry and you really can believe that this two characters have known each other over decades. The romance of the original always feels a bit too cheesy for me, but I thought this was a lovely element to the film that also helped us see another side of Maverick.\n\nA deeper insight in to the psyche of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell\n\nAlongside many others who have seen the film, I also completely agree that this is Cruise’s best performance in years, as we get to delve further in to the psyche of Peter “Maverick” Mitchell than we did before, as we see how the events from the first film, particularly the death of his friend (and surrogate brother) Goose, have continued to affect him and his choices in his life, both professionally and personally. As a Captain, he’s hasn’t risen much in rank over the years, but promotion doesn’t seem important to him. Yet, what he loves to do is now under threat and that’s his ability to keep flying (likely one reason he hasn’t sought higher ranks) and it’s clear that he still lives up to his call-sign when he feels it necessary. It is also evident very early on that he still carries a lot of guilt over what happened to Goose and this is able to be explored here in some emotional and moving ways, as Maverick tries to make peace with the past and the further through the film we get, the more you come to care about him and what happens to him. It’s obvious that this character means a great deal to Cruise and he gives a superb performance, shifting with seeming ease from the humorous, playful moments, to the more emotional scenes, through to the exhilarating action sequences, giving everything he has in every take. I found myself truly drawn in to his performance and he deserves all the praise he is getting for it.\n\nAerial sequences that are simply breathtaking\n\nI expected the aerial sequences in this film to be impressive. Everyone has seen in recent years that Tom Cruise takes his films seriously and will go that extra mile to make something stand out as being something special and that is no different here. By the filmmakers committing to practical effects over visual effects, the result is the most breathtaking aerial scenes ever seen on screen. By having the IMAX quality cameras inside the jets with the actors, you feel every turn, roll and dip the pilots take throughout the film, especially when coupled with the film’s sound design. It sometimes feels dizzying and was unlike any cinema experience I’ve ever had. There are moments where the stakes of the story are so high, that combined with the visuals and sound it feels almost unbearably tense and I (and a lot of people around me in my screening) were gripping the seats and holding our breath (well I was!) at the stress of what we were seeing . It’s a cinema experience I’ll remember for decades and I’m so pleased they waited to make this film for when the technology could really try and capture what it must be like for those pilots in similar scenarios.\n\nA perfect blend of 80s nostalgia and modern filmmaking\n\nThere was always the risk that this sequel could just be a cheesy trip down nostalgia lane to 1986, but thankfully that isn’t the film that’s been made here. Instead the nostalgia for the original film is perfectly balanced with a fresh, more modern story and group of characters, which allows for the interesting exploration of Maverick, as well as what it must be like to be a fighter pilot today. As well as that, it means fans of the original will love the moments and choices that honour that film, whether the near identical frame for frame opening montage (complete with that iconic Top Gun theme and Danger Zone), Maverick’s bike and jacket, the beach scene, the references to characters from the original and how they influence the choices made in this film, or certain lines of dialogue first heard 36 years ago that evoke quite an emotional response in some key moments when heard again. None of these feel too much and they blend with the story being told all these years later, making the film feel nostalgic and new all at once. That’s no small feat!\n\nAnother fantastic Top Gun soundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack to the first Top Gun film became iconic, with both fantastic songs and a strong score that has become instantly recognisable. In terms of songs, this sequel has embraced the 80s/90s tradition of a film song and music video with strong songs from OneRepublic (the very very catchy, upbeat “I Ain’t Worried”) alongside Lady Gaga’s powerhouse “Hold My Hand”. These accompany a fantastic score, for which the original film’s composer Harold Faltermeyer has worked alongside Gaga and film composer royalty Hans Zimmer (he’s on quite a roll at the moment!). I’d be listening to this album on repeat right now if I could (it’s released on 27th May).\n\n………….\n\nI’ll be publishing a spoiler review after the film has released, as there are so many moments and story choices that I want to talk more about, but for now, I’ll simply say, buy your ticket and buy it for the biggest screen you can. If you loved the original, I doubt you’ll be disappointed and if you either haven’t seen, or weren’t bothered about, the original, I still think there’s a strong chance you’ll enjoy Top Gun Maverick, as it’s a fantastic film in its own right (and for me a better film than the first). It has interesting characters, a multi-layered story, aerial sequences that are astonishing and will make you want to laugh, cry and cheer in your seat. I booked to see it again on the day of release the moment I left the cinema. It really is just that good!\n\nMy Rating – ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
