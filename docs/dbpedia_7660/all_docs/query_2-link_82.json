        "text": "By Vince Jackson Special To Independent Mail\n\nA Pendleton native son's name is the origin of a word used to describe someone who refuses to conform to standards and practices.\n\nThe American Standard College Dictionary says the word \"maverick\" refers \"to unbranded cattle or a dissenter; named for Samuel Augustus Maverick Jr.\"\n\nNewspaper clippings and other information from the the Central Heritage Society provide a glimpse into Maverick's life.\n\nBorn in 1803, he was the son of Pendleton landowner Samuel Maverick Sr., who at one time was said to be the richest man in South Carolina. Maverick Jr., known as \"Gus, \"attended Yale law school and traveled to Texas after becoming a lawyer. He was elected a representative for the new territory of Texas and participated in the war with Mexico, but left the Alamo just before Santa Anna overran the mission in 1836.\n\nHis friend, Pendleton resident James Butler Bonhan ? for whom Bonham, Texas, is named ? died at the Alamo.\n\nThe younger Maverick's ambitions lay in the West, and to his father's regret he took his new wife and headed to Texas for good in 1837. Historical accounts document the family's wealth and enormous land holdings. As they traveled from South Carolina to Texas the Mavericks camped only on land they owned, according to legend.\n\nMaverick Jr. once accepted 400 head of cattle as partial payment for a business deal. Not being a cattleman, he allowed the cattle to roam free. As the herd multiplied, yearlings that were found unbranded became known as \"mavericks,\" and that is said to be the origin of the word.\n\nThe elder Maverick built a plantation house, Montpelier, in Pendleton, which still stands along S.C. 88. He married Elizabeth Anderson, widow of Robert Anderson, for whom the city of Anderson and Anderson County are named.\n\nMaverick Sr. is remembered by Pendleton resident Sarah Broyles Williams in a written account from 1926: \"As I saw and knew Mr. Maverick in my childhood there is not a recollection in childhood more vivid and positive. My father's land joined that of Samuel Maverick, who lived a mile farther on in another big white house with piazzas and arches between the tall columns.\"\n\nWilliams wrote that Maverick always wore a pale-colored coat and broad-brimmed white hat. He drove a buggy pulled by a gray horse and passed her house every day. He was very methodical, according to Williams.\n\n\"He passed at seven and now it is 12, because Mr. Maverick is passing to dinner,\" she wrote.\n\nAbout 1846 Maverick suffered a stroke and never spoke or walked again.\n\n\"He used his hands and made signs that were understood,\" Williams wrote.\n\nThe original Montpelier burned several years later and was rebuilt across the road, according to Pendleton historian Tim Drake.\n\n\"During the Civil War one of the large iron balconies was removed and sent off to be made into cannon balls or cannon,\" Drake said.\n\nThe elder Maverick died in 1852 and is buried about a mile from his former home on a ridge overlooking S.C. 88 and Eighteen Mile Road between Central and Pendleton. A large monument marks the location.\n\nAt the time of his death, the elder Maverick owned 4,400 acres at Montpelier, 4,300 acres in Anderson County, 33,000 acres in Pickens County and properties in 11 adjoining counties. Additionally, he owned a large amount of property in Charleston at King and Meeting streets, according to historical records.\n\nThe Mavericks knew notable South Carolina politician John C. Calhoun. Calhoun resigned the office of vice president of the United States, and his Fort Hill plantation is now the home of Clemson University. The Mavericks did not subscribe to Calhoun's state's rights thinking. While they opposed the unequal tariffs imposed on the South, the Mavericks favored keeping the Union together. The younger Maverick on occasion spoke against Calhoun in written accounts in the newspaper The Pendleton Messenger."
