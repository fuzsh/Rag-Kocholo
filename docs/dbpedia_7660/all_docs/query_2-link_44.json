        "text": "Maverick Recording Company, is an American record label and the record company division of entertainment company, Maverick. It is owned and operated by Warner Music Group, and distributed through Warner Bros. Records.\n\nCompany history[]\n\nMaverick Records was founded by Madonna, Frederick DeMann, Ronnie Dashev and Time Warner in April 1992 as part of the entertainment company, Maverick. It is bi-coastal, having offices in both New York City and Los Angeles. The record company division of Maverick consists of the label, Maverick Musica (a Miami, Florida-based satellite label focusing on Latin-American music) and Maverick Music (publishing).\n\nDeMann was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 1998, after which Guy Oseary increased his stake in the company and took control as Chairman and CEO. Maverick has had noted triumphs with acts such as Alanis Morissette, Michelle Branch, The Prodigy, Candlebox, and the band Deftones. The label also had success with soundtracks for The Wedding Singer, Jackie Brown and The Matrix. In addition, Quentin Tarantino’s A Band Apart imprint is distributed by Maverick.\n\nIn March 2004, Maverick filed suit against Warner Music Group and its former parent company, Time Warner Inc., claiming that mismanagement of resources and poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, WMG filed a countersuit, alleging that Maverick had lost tens of millions of dollars on its own. On June 14, 2004, the dispute was resolved when Maverick shares owned by Madonna and Dashev were purchased — which effectively exiled the two of them from the company as it was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music Group. Oseary, meanwhile, remained CEO. In August 2006 the band Lillix, which at the time was signed to the label, claimed that the label no longer exists and that all the artists were now handled by Warner Bros. directly.\n\nBelow is a complete listing of all artists and products released by Maverick Recording Company during founder Madonna's tenure as Chief Executive Officer, 1992–2004:\n\nMaverick Recording Artists[]\n\nAlisha's Attic\n\nAmanda (1999-2001)\n\nBad Brains (1995)\n\nBattlecat (1995)\n\nBaxter (1998)\n\nBinocular (2001)\n\nBottomline\n\nMichelle Branch (2000-present)\n\nCandlebox (1991-2000)\n\nCity Sleeps\n\nClear Static\n\nCleopatra (1998-2001)\n\nDakona (2003)\n\nDana Dane (1995)\n\nDeftones (1995-2008)\n\nDalvin DeGrate (2000)\n\nDeuce Project (2003)\n\nErasure (1997)\n\nEvaline\n\nThe Finalist\n\nEbba Forsberg (1998)\n\nTyler Hilton (2004-present)\n\nHome Town Hero (2002)\n\nInsolence (2001)\n\nBen Jelen (2004)\n\nJack's Mannequin (2005)\n\nJohn-Mark (2006)\n\nJude (1998-2001)\n\nJustincase (2002)\n\nDiana King (2001-2002)\n\nLillix (2001-2006)\n\nLove Spit Love (1996-1997)\n\nLucy Nation (1999)\n\nMadonna (1992-2003)\n\nJorge Moreno (2001)\n\nMest (2000-2005)\n\nMirwais (2000)\n\nMonterey (2004)\n\nAlanis Morissette (1995-present)\n\nMozella\n\nMuse - Showbiz (1999)\n\nMe'shell Ndegeocello - Plantation Lullabies (1993) Peace Beyond Passion (1996) Bitter (1999) Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape (2002) Comfort Woman (2003)\n\nNeurotic Outsiders - Neurotic Outsiders (1996)\n\nNicole\n\nNo Authority - No Authority (2000) Keep On (2000)\n\nN-Phase - N-Phase (1994)\n\nPaul Oakenfold - Bunkka (2002)\n\nOlive - Trickle (2000)\n\nOn the Record\n\nOneSideZero - Is This Room Getting Smaller (2001)\n\nProper Grounds - Downtown Circus Gang (1993)\n\nThe Rentals - Return Of The Rentals (1995) Seven More Minutes (1999)\n\nRule 62 - Rule 62 (1997)\n\nShifty - Happy Love Sick (2004)\n\nShore - Shore (2004)\n\nShowoff - Showoff (1999)\n\nKeaton Simons - Exes And Whys (2004) Currently (2004)\n\nSolar Twins - Solar Twins (1999)\n\nSoul Hooligan - Music Like Dirt (2002)\n\nStage - Stage (2002)\n\nJohn Stevens\n\nStill Naive - Shelf Life (2004)\n\nStory of the Year - Page Avenue (2003) and In the Wake of Determination (2005)\n\nStutterfly - And We Are Bled of Color (2005)\n\nSummercamp - Pure Juice (1997)\n\nSwimmer - Surreal (1999)\n\nTantric - Tantric (2001) After We Go (2004)\n\nTeam Sleep\n\nThe Prodigy - Fat Of The Land (1997) Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned (2004)\n\nThe Rising - Future Unknown (2003)\n\nThe Wreckers\n\nUniversal Nubian Voices - Somethin' Goin' On (1993) UNV (1995)\n\nUnloco - Healing (2001) Becoming I (2003)\n\nWank - Get A Grip On Yourself (1998)\n\nWilliam Orbit - Pieces in a Modern Style (2000)\n\nWil Seabrook Band - Wil Seabrook Band (2003)\n\nMaverick Compilations & Soundtracks[]\n\nWith Honors - Music From The Motion Picture (1994)\n\nJackie Brown - Music From The Miramax Motion Picture (1997)\n\nWedding Singer - Music From The Motion Picture (1998)\n\nWedding Singer, Volume 2 - More Music From The Motion Picture (1998)\n\nLock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels - Music From The Motion Picture (1999)\n\nMatrix - Music From The Motion Picture (1999)\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - Music From The Motion Picture (1999)\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Volume 2 - More Music From The Motion Picture (1999)\n\nDogman - Music From The Motion Picture (1999)\n\nThe Rugrats Movie - Music From The Motion Picture (1999/2000)\n\nThe Next Best Thing - Music From The Motion Picture (2000)\n\nDigimon: The Movie - Music From The Motion Picture (2000)\n\nLittle Nicky - Music From The Motion Picture (2000)\n\nRugrats In Paris - Music From The Motion Picture (2000)\n\nNot Another Teen Movie - Music From The Motion Picture (2001)\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 - Music From And Inspired By (2001)\n\nMTV: 20 Years Of Pop Music (2001)\n\nPlatinum Rhythm (2001)\n\nAustin Powers in Goldmember - Music From The Motion Picture (2002)\n\nMatrix: Reloaded - The Album (2003)\n\nMatrix: Revolutions - Music From The Motion Picture (2003)\n\nKill Bill: Volume 1 - Original Soundtrack (2003)\n\n50 First Dates - Love Songs From The Original Motion Picture (2004)\n\nKill Bill: Volume 2 - Original Soundtrack (2004)\n\nSee also[]\n\nWikipedia:Maverick (entertainment company)"
