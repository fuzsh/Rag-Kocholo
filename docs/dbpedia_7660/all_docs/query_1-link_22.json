        "text": "After Top Gun: Maverick became the highest grossing film of Tom Cruise’s career, a third Top Gun movie is under way.\n\nPuck reports that Top Gun: Maverick co-writer Ehren Kruger is “officially at work” on a script for the project, which intends to reunite Cruise with fellow Maverick stars Miles Teller and Glen Powell. No director has yet been confirmed, but Puck suggest that Maverick’s Joseph Kosinski is in the frame, and will likely act as a producer on the project also.\n\nFeaturing Cruise as navy pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, now mentor for a new generation of fighter pilots including Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Teller) and Jake “Hangman” Seresin (Powell), Top Gun: Maverick was a belated sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun, and amassed more than $1.49bn in box office revenue worldwide to become Cruise’s best performing film. Mission: Impossible – Fallout, released in 2018, had previously been the actor’s most successful with $791.1m."
