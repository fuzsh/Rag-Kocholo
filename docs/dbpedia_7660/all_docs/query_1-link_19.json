        "text": "Maverick and Rooster are ready to get back in the cockpit. On the heels of 2022's box-office success, Top Gun: Maverick's Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and Glen Powell are all gunning to turn the franchise into a trilogy. The third unnamed film, according to The Town's Matthew Belloni, is currently in development despite Tom Cruise's new partnership with Warner Bros. The deal will allow Cruise to finish Top Gun 3, his Mission: Impossible franchise, and even a planned Doug Liman movie in space. That's a lot of projects lined up for Cruise, but thankfully, the star is showing no signs of aging.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski will also return for a third entry, after helming a project that grossed nearly $1.5 billion at the box office. Top Gun: Maverick screenwriter Ehren Kruger will also return. \"Is there another story that is compelling enough that we need to go back?\" Kosinski mused to Deadline back in December 2022. \"It seems to me at the end of this film that Maverick has some gas left in the tank. Heâ€™s not settling down.\"\n\nOur bet is that if the stunts are dangerous enough, Hollywood's favorite adrenaline junkie would sign on for basically anything. The man is still doing all of his own tricks at age 61, and for Top Gun: Maverick, Cruise insisted on having his castmates go through a three-month bootcamp to make sure they were all able to mitigate the potential side effects of being in an F-18. Assuming that was fun for everyone, we see no hiccups here."
