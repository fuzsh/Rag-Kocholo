        "text": "If you've seen the new Top Gun movie, you may feel a sense of excitement watching the Top Gun planes majestically flying through the sky. However, how much of the movie is actually grounded in reality?\n\nIf you want to get to the bottom of Top Gun fact vs. fiction, read on as we share some interesting insights about the movie and its real-life counterpart.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe you'll learn something new about aviation along the way, and decide to try your hand at flying a Top Gun plane yourself!\n\nHow much of Top Gun is real?\n\nTop Gun and its sequel Top Gun: Maverick do incorporate elements of reality, but they are not entirely based on true events. The movies pull inspiration from real-life military aviation programs, such as the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as TOPGUN. However, the storyline and characters, including Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise, are fictional.\n\nEnjoy the thrill of flying a Top Gun plane with Sky Combat Ace!\n\nAre the planes in Top Gun real?\n\nThe authenticity of Top Gun: Maverick is significantly enhanced by its use of real fighter planes, including F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-35s. The production team secured these state-of-the-art aircraft for filming despite the considerable expense involved. Renting these fighter planes from the U.S. Navy reportedly costs up to $11,374 per hour.\n\nHowever, the actors, including Tom Cruise, were not permitted to operate these military assets due to U.S. Department of Defense regulations. They were passengers in these planes, seated behind the pilots who had full control of the aircraft. Before filming, the actors underwent essential training on emergency ejection procedures and sea survival techniques.\n\nThe film predominantly features F-18 Super Hornets over F-35s for a practical reason: the need for two-seater planes. The narrative required both the actors and the Navy pilots to be in the aircraft during filming, which is not possible with the single-seat F-35s.\n\nSo, while the stunts and aircraft used in Top Gun: Maverick are indeed real, the actors did not pilot the planes themselves.\n\nEnjoy the thrill of flying a Top Gun plane with Sky Combat Ace!\n\nAre the Top Gun stunts real?\n\nThe stunts in Top Gun: Maverick are definitely real, with the film minimizing the use of CGI for a more authentic experience.\n\nThe cast members, including Tom Cruise and Miles Teller, were not mere passengers but actively involved in the filming process, although they did not pilot the jets themselves. Trained Navy pilots were responsible for the aerial sequences.\n\nThe cast underwent an intensive three-month training program developed by Tom Cruise to prepare for their roles. This program included rigorous physical training and various tests to equip them for the actual experience of being inside a real F/A 18 Super Hornet.\n\nMoreover, the cast had to take on additional responsibilities while shooting the aerial sequences. As they were often isolated for hours at a time, they essentially became their own crew and cinematographer.\n\nThey were equipped with new camera rigs installed inside the cockpit, enabling them to frame and light the shots themselves. Their only support during these sequences was the pilots, who were primarily focused on flying the aircraft.\n\nThis approach to filming was undoubtedly challenging, but it was chosen over using green screens or fake cockpits to enhance authenticity.\n\nThe practical Top Gun stunts performed in the film not only contribute to the film's incredible visuals but also allow audiences to truly comprehend what the actors underwent to deliver these captivating action scenes.\n\nSoar like the pilots in Top Gun!\n\nSince 1969, Top Gun in Miramar, CA, has inspired aviators to experience the thrill of flying like a fighter pilot.
