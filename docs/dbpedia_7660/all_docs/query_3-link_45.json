        "text": "Top Gun is a classic action film directed by Tony Scott and was released in 1986—the second movie to this sequel was released in 2022. The movie is set against the backdrop of the elite United States Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as Top Gun, where the best fighter pilots are trained. The film’s introduction showcases the intense and competitive world of naval aviation.\n\nThe story follows Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise, and his Radar Intercept Officer Nick “Goose” Bradshaw, played by Anthony Edwards, as they attend Top Gun and compete with other talented pilots. Maverick is a skilled but reckless pilot, and the movie explores his journey to become a top-notch aviator while dealing with personal challenges and relationships.\n\nTom Cruise will return as “Maverick” in Top Gun 3. The reason for Top Gun 3 is supposedly that Top Gun 2 made 1.493 million USD from the box office. They are hoping to make the same, perhaps even more from the 3rd of these thrilling flicks\n\nThis announcement comes soon after Cruise signed a non-exclusive deal with Warner Bros. to develop original movies and franchises for the studio.\n\n“That pact still allows Cruise to work for other companies like Paramount and Universal, where he’s working on a pricey film that will shoot at the International Space Station. It also gives Cruise’s company offices on Warner’s Burbank lot,” Variety reported."
