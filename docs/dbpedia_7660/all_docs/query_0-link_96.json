        "text": "Top Gun: Maverick has soared past $639 million at the U.S. box office, surpassing Titanic’s first-run release as the highest-grossing domestic film in Paramount’s history, and its worldwide gross is a whopping $1.292 billion and climbing. And though it’s easy to point to the movie’s greatness as the reason it took expectations to new heights, that’s not the full story.\n\nIn fact, the film wasn’t always cleared for takeoff.\n\nWhen Tom Cruise first hit the stage at San Diego Comic-Con to reveal the trailer for Top Gun: Maverick, a sequel to 1986’s Top Gun, the audience ate it up: There was thunderous applause, overwhelmingly positive feedback and anticipation couldn’t be higher.\n\nWORK SMARTER - LEARN, GROW AND BE INSPIRED.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nTo Read the Full Story Become an Adweek+ Subscriber\n\nView Subscription Options\n\nAlready a member?
