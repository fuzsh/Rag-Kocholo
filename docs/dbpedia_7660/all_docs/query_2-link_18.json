        "text": "Madonna, the former material girl, is letting go of one of her biggest possessions after agreeing to sell her stake in the music label Maverick to Warner Music Group.\n\nThe sale ends a legal dispute between the singer and Warner, during which she accused the firm of cheating her out of millions of dollars.\n\nMadonna and one of her partners in Maverick, Ronnie Dashev, will receive a total of $10m (Â£6m) for their combined stake of 35%, according to reports. Details of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nThe row erupted during talks earlier this year to dissolve the joint venture. Warner anticipated a suit and asked a Delaware court to rule that it had not breached its contract. It claimed that Maverick had lost $60m in the past five years.\n\nA day later, as expected, Maverick filed a suit seeking to recover $200m. It alleged that Warner had failed to properly promote its artists and had been creative with its accounting to make Maverick appear less profitable than it was. Madonna's lawyers said Warner's conduct amounted to \"treason\".\n\nMadonna launched Maverick at the height of her fame in 1992 as a 50-50 joint venture with Warner. It scored an early hit by signing the then unknown Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, whose debut album, Jagged Little Pill, sold 28m copies. She is still with the label and her latest release is on the Billboard top 30.\n\nOther artists on the label include Michelle Branch, Prodigy and the Deftones.\n\nMadonna, currently on the American leg of a world tour, is signed to the Warner Bros Records label and the settlement does not affect that contract.\n\nThe other partner in the venture, Guy Oseary, who is the creative head of the label, will keep a 25% stake and remain at the firm. Warner will increase its stake in Maverick to 75%.\n\nBert Fields, a lawyer for Maverick, said: \"It was an effective way of settling the lawsuit. It's clean and it's equitable.\""
