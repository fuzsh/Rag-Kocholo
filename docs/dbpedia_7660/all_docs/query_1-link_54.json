        "text": "Tom Cruise may be headed back to the danger zone.\n\nParamount has tapped “Top Gun: Maverick” co-writer Ehren Kruger to work on a script for a sequel to the action blockbuster, according to a knowledgeable insider. The studio is also hoping that “Top Gun: Maverick” director Joseph Kosinski will get back into the cockpit for another installment in the series, which would potentially see Cruise’s younger co-stars Miles Teller and Glen Powell return for more high-altitude excitement. Discussions about the new script began late last year. There’s still a few hurdles to cross, with Cruise and company needing to sign off on a final version. A spokesperson for Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe news, which was first reported by Puck, comes days after Cruise announced that he had signed a non-exclusive deal to develop franchises and original movies for Warner Bros., the studio where he made “Interview With the Vampire,” “Eyes Wide Shut,” “Magnolia” and “Edge of Tomorrow.” That pact still allows Cruise to work for other companies like Paramount and Universal, where he’s working on a pricey film that will shoot at the International Space Station. It also gives Cruise’s company offices on Warner’s Burbank lot.\n\nParamount Global, the studio’s parent company, has also been making headlines of late and appears to be on the block. Skydance Media, which produced “Top Gun: Maverick,” is reportedly considering buying National Amusements, the holding company that controls Paramount Global.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” was a huge hit for Paramount, which tried for decades to find a way to get Cruise back in aviators. The film was nominated for the Oscar for best picture and grossed nearly $1.5 billion, making it the most popular film of Cruise’s career. Cruise also guides the “Mission: Impossible” franchise at Paramount. He’s currently working on the eighth installment in the spy series.\n\nUpdated: 8:33 am ET"
