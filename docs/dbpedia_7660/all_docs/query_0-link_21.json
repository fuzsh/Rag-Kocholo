        "text": "Stephen Colbert interviews Jennifer Connolly, the co-star with Tom Cruise in the new TOP GUN: MAVERICK movie sequel opening in theaters worldwide this coming Friday, May 27th.\n\nMaverick's (Tom) \"love interest\" is \"Penny\" (Jennifer). She's a sailboat owner that Tom offers to help with her \"engine problem\" (the J/125 offshore speedster).\n\nOn his CBS Late Show, Colbert discusses Jennifer's \"training\" to do her own \"stunts\"... in this case, Jennifer learns how to sail, then skippers a J/125 sailing on San Francisco Bay with Tom Cruise.\n\nTom's famous quote: \"I don't sail boats, Penny, I land on them!\" LOL!\n\nWatch the Colbert/ Connolly TOP GUN: MAVERICK interview here on YouTube\n\nInterestingly, Colbert knows a fair amount about sailing, having first learned how to sail growing up in Charleston, SC. His first offshore experience was sailing the 2005 Charleston to Bermuda Race on a 42-foot cat ketch. Funny as hell description of sailing offshore after both heads (toilets) malfunctioned 2 days into the race! Read about it here on SailingWorld.com\n\nOn his CBS Late Night with David Letterman show in September 2005, Letterman had a hilarious interview with Stephen Colbert after his 2005 Charleston to Bermuda Race experience... it's worth a few laughs from any experienced sailor. Watch the Letterman/ Colbert sailing interview here on YouTube."
