It was followed by the 2022 sequel film Top Gun: Maverick, which takes place 36 years after the events of the first film and depicts Maverick's reluctant return to the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program, where he must confront his past as he trains a group of younger aviators, among them the son of his deceased best friend. Top Gun: Maverick was met with greater critical and commercial success than the original, with praise for its story, performances, emotional weight, and flying sequences.\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director Screenwriters Story by Producers Top Gun May 16, 1986 ( ) Tony Scott Jim Cash & Jack Epps Jr. Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer Top Gun: Maverick May 27, 2022 ( ) Joseph Kosinski Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer & Christopher McQuarrie Peter Craig & Justin Marks Tom Cruise, David Ellison, Jerry Bruckheimer and Christopher McQuarrie\n\nTop Gun (1986)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Top Gun\n\nTop Gun: Maverick (2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Top Gun: Maverick\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2022, Miles Teller stated that he had been pitching a follow-up film centered around his character to the studio.

It was the best selling soundtrack of 1986 and is still one of the best selling soundtrack albums of all time.[18][19] The soundtrack spawned two top 10 singles on the US charts, with the song \"Danger Zone\" by Kenny Loggins peaking at number two and the song \"Take My Breath Away\" by Berlin reaching number one, the latter of which would also go on to win both the Academy Award for Best Original Song[20] and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[21] According to Allmusic, the album \"remains a quintessential artifact of the mid-'80s\", and the album's hits \"still define the bombastic, melodramatic sound that dominated the pop charts of the era.\"[19]\n\nThe soundtrack to the sequel featured the singles \"Hold My Hand\" by Lady Gaga and \"I Ain't Worried\" by OneRepublic, with the latter becoming a top 10 hit. The score of the film harkened back to the original film's sound and was noted by Zanobard Reviews as a \"thoroughly entertaining and incredibly nostalgic musical experience from beginning to end\".[22]\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\nTop Gun also spawned a number of video games for various platforms. The original game was released in 1986 under the same title as the film. It was released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled Top Gun, was released in 1987 for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Nintendo VS. System arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, Top Gun: The Second Mission, was released for the NES three years later.\n\nAnother game, Top Gun: Fire at Will, was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the Sony PlayStation platform. Top Gun: Hornet's Nest was released in 1998. Top Gun: Combat Zones was released for PlayStation 2 in 2001 and was subsequently released for the GameCube and Microsoft Windows. Combat Zones features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled Top Gun was released for the Nintendo DS. A 2010 game, also titled Top Gun, retells the film's story. At E3 2011, a new game was announced, Top Gun: Hard Lock, which was released in March 2012 for Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3."
