        "text": "©2022 Paramount Pictures Corporation. All rights reserved. / ©亀井重郎\n\nDirector: Joseph KOSINSKI\n\nCast: Tom CRUISE, Miles TELLER, Jennifer CONNELLY, Jon HAMM, Glen POWELL, Lewis PULLMAN, Ed HARRIS, Val KILMER\n\nDistributor: Towa Pictures\n\n2022 / USA / 130min.\n\nA sequel to Top Gun, the 1986 international hit that launched Tom Cruise into stardom. Legendary pilot Maverick returns as an instructor at the US Navy’s Top Gun training program for elite pilots. He knows better than anyone how unforgiving and beautiful the sky can be and teaches the trainees the difficulty and ferocity of air defense and combat, but they rebel against his perplexingly unconventional instruction. Among the students is Rooster, the son of Maverick’s former wingman Goose, who died during a training flight with Maverick. Rooster resents him—and confronts him. Cruise reprises his role as the protagonist, Maverick, with Miles Teller and Jennifer Connelly co-starring, and Val Kilmer returning as Maverick’s rival Iceman. The film was directed by Joseph Kosinski, and Christopher McQuarrie contributed to the screenplay. The film was nominated for six accolades at the 95th Academy Awards, winning for Best Sound.\n\n【Special talk event 'How to enjoy film subtitling'】\n\nAfter the screening of Top Gun: Maverick, Natsuko Toda, a film subtitle translator, will be invited to talk about subtitle translation and how to enjoy the film more.\n\n【Special Guests】Natsuko Toda\n\n【Profile】\n\nBorn in Tokyo. A graduate of Tsuda University’s Department of English, Toda has been captivated by cinema since her childhood, when the ban on foreign cinema was lifted after the war. She aspired to work as a subtitle translator for films since she was in college. Although she learned the craft from the late Shunji Shimizu, a pioneer and leading figure in the field, and took on part-time work translating promotional material and interpreting for visiting filmmakers for film companies, the path was a difficult one, and Toda toiled for two decades before achieving her goal. She worked on small movie projects beginning in 1970, such as the French film Églantine (72), but her big break came with Francis Ford Coppola’s acclaimed Apocalypse Now (79). This launched a career that continues to this day, in which she translates approximately one film per week, or between 50 and 60 films a year."
