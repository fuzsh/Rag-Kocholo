        "text": "”Just do it. Make something. Put it out there and if it is good, it will be noticed.”\n\n—Director Joseph Kosinski\n\nDirector Joseph Kosinski is going to remember June 2022 very fondly. He directed Top Gun: Maverick which has only been in theaters for a week and it’s already made over $300 million. And in a couple of weeks, his Spiderhead comes out on Netflix. How did go from growing up in Marshalltown, Iowa to directing a Tom Cruise blockbuster movie? I’m glad you ask.\n\nAccording to this Time-Republican article, he moved to Mashalltown at age 5 and graduated from Marshalltown in 1992. He did his undergraduate work at Stanford (mechanical engineering) and master’s work at Columbia (architecture). Smart cookie for sure, but where did film come into the picture?\n\nHis skills in computer graphics opened the door to working on commercials and short films. And he started writing a short story called Oblivion —that grew into the 2013 film Oblivion starring Tom Cruise.\n\n“I have come to appreciate the freedom I had while growing up in Marshalltown, being able to ride my bicycle around and going to movies at the Orpheum. Having lived in Manhattan for 10 years and now the Los Angeles area, the freedom was special.”\n\n—Joseph Kosinski\n\nHollywood director comes home by Mike Donahey\n\nRelated posts:\n\nMarshalltown #56 (Marshalltown) Photo of Orpheum where Kosinski saw Raiders of the Lost Ark as a kid in 1981.\n\nOnce Upon a Time… in Iowa (Jean Seberg)\n\nTron: Legacy (Part 1)\n\nScott W. Smith is the author of Screenwriting with Brass Knuckles"
