        "text": "In 1990, Tom Cruise told Playboy he wouldn’t make Top Gun 2, for fear it might glorify or gamify war. What changed?\n\nIt’s a film about competition and friendship and sacrifice. It was never a film about war. We wanted to give people insight into a world and to experience what it’s like to ride in one of these machines. But the desire was to tell an emotive story about a guy in his 50s. The push was: what’s the audience feeling about that? We were pretty ruthless in making sure that we were always pushing that story, even in an action scene.\n\nDoes it feel strange to still be discussing something you shot in 2018?\n\nIt is a little weird. The pandemic is a strange, two-year gap we all have. I’m just relieved the movie worked out and was released in the way we wanted. There was a lot of pressure on Tom [Cruise] and Jerry [Bruckheimer, the producer] to put it out on streaming. I’m glad we waited because we made it for the big screen and I think it was the movie that a lot of people came back to cinemas to see.\n\nMaverick is a mortal person, if quite an unusual and resilient one. Do you think there’s waning interest in superheroes?\n\nI do feel like the movie probably hits differently post-Covid. We are all in a different headspace. Every sequence in this movie was flown by real navy pilots: real people doing extraordinary things. People tell me that they’re gripping on to the edge of their seat in the third act. That’s exactly what we hoped for.\n\nIt’s also quite an earnest film.\n\nThere’s not a lot of sarcasm. It wears its heart on its sleeve. It’s OK to show some genuine emotion. Men crying in the movie is a good thing. We approached it in a very honest, straightforward way. What Tom does dramatically in a film that also requires such incredible action skills – you just can’t take that for granted. I can’t think of anyone else who would be able to do both things and produce the film.\n\nYou’ve spoken about how Cruise mentored the younger stars on the film. Yet his charisma is so singular it’s hard to see how they could ape him.\n\nOf all the characters he’s played, I think Maverick might be kind of the closest to his real personality. He’s always pushing the envelope. The young actors were so curious to just pick his brain. Here’s a guy who has the career that they all dream about and he’s willing to talk about how he got there.\n\nGlen [Powell] read for the part of Rooster and didn’t get it; Miles Teller did. He didn’t want the part of Hangman; he wanted the lead. Then Tom explained to him that as a young actor, you have to choose great movies, not great roles. It totally changed Glen’s approach.\n\nWhat do people fail to appreciate about Cruise?\n\nEveryone knows he gives 110% every day. But the amount of work it takes to make movies like this requires a level of commitment that’s pretty astonishing. He just never gives up.\n\nWhat do you think he sees in you? What’s the kinship?\n\nHe knows I’ll work as hard as I can on every frame. I’m always willing to have the conversation and be open to the best idea. We like fast cars, fast planes, you know, all that kind of kinetic movement. Two of the five films I’ve made have been with him.\n\nIs there still snobbery around mainstream action hits?\n\nNo, the critics embraced it, the audience embraced it, the industry embraced it. I got emails from the heads of every studio congratulating us on the film. Everyone’s rooting for us. And it played overseas bigger than it played domestically. The themes are very universal. We’re not pointing at a specific enemy. We’re not making a political statement. We’re just trying to tell this very honest story about a guy struggling with some things in his life set against the backdrop of this incredibly demanding, exciting job.\n\nHow delicate a dance was that depoliticisation?\n\nI actually enjoyed the creative challenge of saying: how can I make this enemy so unidentifiable that no matter how hard someone tries, they’ll never be able to pick them out?\n\nDid the Pentagon involvement ever feel compromising?\n\nI know on the first film Jerry had to work hard to persuade them to participate. This time that wasn’t the case, because so many of the decision-makers joined the navy because of the first film. We lived on an aircraft carrier for a couple of weeks. That’s tough: 5,000 people on a ship operating 24/7. You get in your bunk exhausted at the end of a 15-hour day and there’s aircraft taking off 5ft above your head all night long. A constant din of activity: very loud and very busy. It’s intense.\n\nIs flying safe with sleep deprivation?\n\nI hear that if you live on the ship for a while, you have trouble sleeping when you come back home and there’s no sound.\n\nWill it be hard to top this success?\n\nYes. But this is Top Gun. It’s like such a special thing: 35 years of love and pent-up excitement. I don’t know if there are many other films out there so beloved and untouched. For me, box-office success is not how I gauge the films I work on. Your films are like your kids: you love them each the same.\n\nIs culture today more nostalgic than 10 years ago?\n\nThere’s this sense of pining for the way things were. The 80s seem like a simpler time. A nice naivety to life pre-internet. We weren’t bombarded with as much information. The film intentionally has a throwback sensibility. There’s very little in it that ties it to 2022. Maverick has a BlackBerry, but that’s about the only real piece of modern technology in the film. All the real emotional drama occurs in face-to-face conversations. It is a little bit of a fantasy world. Maverick can ride around without a helmet and the sun’s always setting."
