Maverick Recording Company, is an American record label and the record company division of entertainment company, Maverick. It is owned and operated by Warner Music Group, and distributed through Warner Bros. Records.

Company history[]

Maverick Records was founded by Madonna, Frederick DeMann, Ronnie Dashev and Time Warner in April 1992 as part of the entertainment company, Maverick. It is bi-coastal, having offices in both New York City and Los Angeles. The record company division of Maverick consists of the label, Maverick Musica (a Miami, Florida-based satellite label focusing on Latin-American music) and Maverick Music (publishing).

DeMann was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 1998, after which Guy Oseary increased his stake in the company and took control as Chairman and CEO. Maverick has had noted triumphs with acts such as Alanis Morissette, Michelle Branch, The Prodigy, Candlebox, and the band Deftones. The label also had success with soundtracks for The Wedding Singer, Jackie Brown and The Matrix. In addition, Quentin Tarantino’s A Band Apart imprint is distributed by Maverick.

In March 2004, Maverick filed suit against Warner Music Group and its former parent company, Time Warner Inc., claiming that mismanagement of resources and poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, WMG filed a countersuit, alleging that Maverick had lost tens of millions of dollars on its own. On June 14, 2004, the dispute was resolved when Maverick shares owned by Madonna and Dashev were purchased — which effectively exiled the two of them from the company as it was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music Group. Oseary, meanwhile, remained CEO. In August 2006 the band Lillix, which at the time was signed to the label, claimed that the label no longer exists and that all the artists were now handled by Warner Bros. directly.

Below is a complete listing of all artists and products released by Maverick Recording Company during founder Madonna's tenure as Chief Executive Officer, 1992–2004:
