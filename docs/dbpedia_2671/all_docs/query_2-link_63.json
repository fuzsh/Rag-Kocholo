        "text": "This week I attended the Jisc Final Programme Meeting at the Jisc offices in London. The attendees were mainly from the Strand B Mass digitisation projects, but there were also representatives from the other strands there.\n\nDiscovery was a big topic of conversation, and we discussed the results of the Jisc discovery survey. We talked about the methods we each employed for data discovery, the strengths and weaknesses of those methods and also the mechanisms we used to measure the success of those methods.\n\nIt was nice to discover that when you searched for ‘historic UK sea levels’ our Jisc and BODC project pages were all the top hits, so we need to build on this.\n\nThere were presentations from some of the projects about what the future holds, and a couple of them mentioned crowd sourcing and citizen science. One in particular discussed the creation of generic crowd sourcing tool kits, which could be of use to us, so we will be contacting the speakers to see if they can offer advice.\n\nAnd finally, when I was in London, I had time to pop into the Science Museum and see Lord Kelvin’s first tide-predicting machine. It is a lovely bit of engineering and I would recommend popping in to have a look at it!\n\nToday I attended a meeting of the Sea Level and Ocean Climate group at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, where Professor Philip Woodworth gave a short talk about tide prediction machines.\n\nProf Woodworth started with a brief history of tide predicting machines. The concept was demonstrated by Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) but Prof Woodworth argued that Edward Roberts should also be considered for the title of ‘Father of tide predicting machines’. Roberts was a mechanical engineer who built many of the machines put into use. Only around 25 machines were ever built and 20 of them were made in Britain. The very first machine is now in the Science Museum in London.\n\nOne of the very interesting aspects of the talk was a bit of detective work that Prof Woodworth and his colleagues had been involved in. I blogged recently about a film of a tide predicting machine that we’d had digitised; this machine was initially thought to be the Roberts-type machine currently in storage in Liverpool. However, upon closer inspection (including carefully counting the gears) it transpired to be a mystery machine. The Roberts machine in Liverpool could analyse 42 tidal constituents but the machine in the video only had 30 wheels. After a lot of questions and emails Prof Woodworth discovered that the machine in the video was actually a Roberts-type machine that had been built for the Soviet Union, which ended up in Moscow.\n\nOther tidal prediction machines are preserved in museums around the world. These include the biggest machine ever built, in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.\n\nProf Woodworth is now investigating where the other missing machines are and if they are still in working order. He has started to contact the various agencies around the world who were known to operate them. We hope to get the Roberts or Doodson-Légé machine back out on display in the future.\n\nThe photo is of a functioning model of a tide predicting machine built by engineers at NOCL to illustrate the principles of a machine. The model was running at the talk."
