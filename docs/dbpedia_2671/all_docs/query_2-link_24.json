Satellite observations provide data for the surface layer of the ocean. To penetrate beyond the surface, scientists rely on in situ physical measurements from a range of platforms, including research ships, ocean observatories, moorings, and autonomous underwater and surface vehicles.\n\nMore about Facilities"
