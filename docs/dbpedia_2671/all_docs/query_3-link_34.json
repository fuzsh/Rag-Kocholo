        "text": "13.1. Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin fÃ¼r Materialien und Energie (HZB)Â¶\n\nHZB minted four DOIs with DataCite for HZB instruments: two beamlines at the neutron source BER II;, one beamline at the synchrotron light source BESSY II; and one experimental station at BESSY II. The DOIs resolve to the respective instrument page from the HZB instrument database that did already exist before and was thus not created for this purpose. One particularity with these instruments is that they are custom built by HZB. Thus, in the metadata HZB appears as Creator as well as Contributor with property contributorType value HostingInstitution. It is noteworthy that one of the DOIs uses the additional property fundingReference from the DataCite schema to acknowledge external funding that HZB received for upgrading the instrument. This property was not considered in the PIDINST schema, or in the DataCite mapping. HZB plans to continue the adoption and to mint DOIs for all its beamlines and experimental stations that are in user operation in the near future.\n\n13.4. SENSOR.awi.de and PANGAEAÂ¶\n\nThe Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) has been continuously committed to develop and sustain an eResearch infrastructure for coherent discovery, view, dissemination, and archival of scientific data and related information in polar and marine regions. In order to address the increasing heterogeneity of research platforms and respective devices and sensors along with varying project-driven requirements, a generic and modular framework has been built intended to support the flow of sensor observations to archives (O2A). In this context, SENSOR.awi.de, available since 2015, is an O2A component dedicated to the registry of research platforms, devices and sensors and in the meantime in use by several international partners (e.g. MOSAiC project). SENSOR.awi.de has been built using OGC SensorML standard and all individual records, to date over 4000, are assigned a persistent identifier using UUIDs in the handle syntax along with automated generation of a record citation. Terminologies (e.g., controlled vocabularies) are used to define sensor categories (NERC L05) as well as sensor types and models (NERC L22). The data model of SENSOR.awi.de is compliant with the PIDINST schema and the additional implementation of Datacite DOIS for sensors is to date under evaluation. The ultimate goal of SENSOR.awi.de is to enhance the quality of published and archived data in PANGAEA by providing complete metadata and persistent identifiers on instruments and sensors used in the data acquisition process (Figure 12.2). Given that platforms and sensors evolve in time (sensors are being calibrated, instrument payload changes, etc), SENSOR.awi.de also supports record versioning by maintaining an audit trail of changes in the XML record.\n\nPANGAEA is a digital repository for environmental research data and the dedicated long term archive within the O2A framework jointly operated by the AWI and MARUM (University Bremen). Each dataset is made available with its descriptive metadata, including the relations with research resources (e.g., articles, funder, instrument and specimen, if applicable). As a data provider, PANGAEA only curates limited information of a device such as device name, identifier and type. As an effort to standardize device type and name, currently the repository applies external terminologies, in particular the NERC L05 device category vocabulary and the L22 device catalogue. The repository has developed tailor-made client applications to import these terminologies in a periodic, incremental manner. For both the persistent identification as well as for the detailed description of instruments, PANGAEA thus relies on institutional instrument registries such as SENSOR.awi.de and uses their issued PIDs to uniquely identify instruments which have been used to acquire data archived at PANGAEA. Since AWI and PANGAEA use the same vocabularies/terminologies as well as PIDs to represent devices, they facilitate easy integration of datasets in particular during transfer of near real time data from O2A raw data staging areas via data quality control services etc to their final destination, the PANGAEA data archive."
