        "text": "The gold standard teaching qualification\n\nCELTA from Cambridge is a qualification for teaching English as a foreign language. It is the most widely recognised English teaching qualification in the world and the most often requested by employers; three out of four English language teaching jobs require a CELTA qualification*.\n\nIt focuses on developing practical techniques, and includes face-to-face or online teaching practice with groups of learners, which will give you the confidence you need to begin teaching in as little as four weeks.\n\nWhether you’re looking for your first teaching job, or you want to prove to employers that you have the required teaching skills with a recognised certificate, CELTA from Cambridge is the qualification you need.\n\nWays to take CELTA\n\nChoose the CELTA course that suits you best: face-to-face, online or a combination of both. You can also choose to take it full time, usually 4–5 weeks, or part time over the course of a few months to a year.\n\nWhichever way you take it, you’ll experience the same standard of training from CELTA-certified teachers. You’ll receive the same qualification and benefit from the same international recognition and opportunities with employers.\n\nFace-to-face\n\nYour teaching practice will be in a classroom with groups of learners and observed by your trainer. Your training sessions will be face-to-face or a combination with online study.\n\nIt’s especially suitable if you prefer studying face-to-face, if you only want to teach face-to-face classes, or if you want to travel to take your CELTA in a particular place.\n\nOnline\n\nYour training and teaching practice will be in an online learning environment with groups of learners and observed by your trainer.\n\nIt’s particularly useful if you want the flexibility of online study, if you want to limit travel costs, or if you plan to teach English online as you’ll learn more about the digital tools needed.\n\nCombination\n\nYour training may be online, face-to-face or a blend of online and face-to-face.\n\nYour teaching practice will include face-to-face lessons in a classroom and lessons in an online learning environment. Your teaching practice will be with groups of learners and observed by your trainer.\n\nIt’s particularly good if you want to get experience of both online and face-to-face teaching.\n\nFind out more about taking CELTA"
