        "text": "British Oceanographic Data Centre\n\nThe British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) is a national facility based at the Liverpool site of the National Oceanography Centre. BODC is responsible for the storage and distribution of data collected from the marine environment across a range of disciplines. BODC works closely with National Marine Facilities to gather and curate data that are made available for scientists to use long term. Stored data available from BODC include biological, chemical, physical and geophysical data for nearly 22,000 variables.\n\nVisit the British Oceanographic Data Centre website\n\nBritish Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility\n\nThe British Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility (BOSCORF) is based at the Southampton site of the National Oceanography Centre and is Britain’s national deep-sea core repository. BOSCORF contains state-of-the-art core logging facilities and is home to marine sediment cores, collected by the Natural Environmental Research Council’s ships and researchers. The storage and curation of cores stored at BOSCORF enables scientific communities to gain access to the cores.\n\nVisit the BOSCORF website\n\nPermanent Service for Mean Sea Level\n\nThe Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) is hosted at the Liverpool site of the National Oceanography Centre. The facility, which was established in 1933, uses data from a global network of tidal gauges for analysis and interpretation of sea level. Sea level data, collected and published by PSMSL, are available for use by the scientific community and industry.\n\nVisit the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level website\n\nNational Tidal and Sea Level Facility\n\nThe National Tidal and Sea Level Facility (NTSLF), based at the Liverpool site of the National Oceanography Centre, is the UK centre of excellence for sea level monitoring, coastal flood forecasting and the analysis of sea level extremes. It is the focus for sea level research in the UK and for its interpretation, which can be used to advise policy makers, planners and coastal engineers.\n\nThe NTSLF comprises the UK National Tide Gauge Network, geodetic networks for monitoring vertical land movements, and gauges in the British Dependent Territories of the South Atlantic and Gibraltar.\n\nVisit the National Tidal and Sea Level Facility website\n\nDiscovery Collections\n\nThe Discovery Collections comprise benthic and pelagic samples from many areas of the world’s oceans. ​\n\nIt is the only collection consisting solely of deep-sea and open-ocean invertebrates in the UK and provides vital insight into the species that live at extreme ocean depths.\n\nThe Discovery Collections facility maintains a key time-series of deep-sea organisms dating back to 1925 when the RRS Discovery collected the first samples in the Southern Ocean.\n\nMore about the Discovery Collections"
