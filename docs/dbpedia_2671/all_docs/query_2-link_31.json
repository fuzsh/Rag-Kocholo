        "text": "To make atmospheric and physical oceanographic data traceable and citable, Advances in Atmospheric Sciences (AAS) accepts submissions of Data Description articles, which describe datasets in atmospheric and physical oceanographic fields.\n\nLike other articles submitted to AAS, Data Description articles are subject to peer review before being published both online and in print. The accepted article is indexed by the SCI database, with a DOI and page numbers.\n\nFor authors:\n\n1. A Data Description article should include a title, list of authors, abstract, main text and references. Please refer to the Author Guide for more detailed style instructions.\n\n● Title (110 characters maximum, including whitespaces)\n\n● Author information\n\n● Abstract (170 words maximum, no references)\n\n● Background & Summary (700 words maximum)\n\n● Methods (unlimited length)\n\n● Data Records (Dataset location and format，unlimited length)\n\n● Technical Validation (unlimited length)\n\n● Usage Notes (unlimited length)\n\n● Figures (generally no more than ten per manuscript)\n\n● Tables (generally no more than ten per manuscript)\n\n● Acknowledgements\n\n2. The main text should describe the data source and provide information on the approved repository or data center in which the data are housed (preferably having also been assigned a DOI), as well as the data collection and processing procedures (software, file formats), verification, and how to use the dataset.\n\n3. All datasets must be formally archived in an AAS approved repository. An approved repository is one that is commonly used by the scientific community it supports, has a formal data management policy in place, and can mint a DOI or provide a stable URL for the dataset. A list of recommended institutions can be found below:\n\n● Springer Nature Research Data Support\n\n● 3TU.Datacentrum\n\n● British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC)\n\n● British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC)\n\n● CISL Research Data Archive\n\n● CSIRO Data Access Portal\n\n● Deep Carbon Observatory\n\n● eartH2Observe\n\n● Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC)\n\n● Figshare\n\n● IEDA:EarthChem\n\n● IEDA:MGDS\n\n● National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA\n\n● Earth Observing Lab (EOL), observational and supporting data from atmospheric science field experiments and arctic research\n\n● Research Data Archive (RDA), reference datasets for weather and climate research\n\n● National Geoscience Data Centre (NGDC)\n\n● NERC Earth Observation Data Centre (NEODC)\n\n● NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)\n\n● NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC)\n\n● NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)\n\n● PANGAEA\n\n● Polar Data Centre (PDC)\n\n● Zenodo\n\n● National Centers for Environmental Information\n\n● China Science Data Bank\n\n4. The length of the article should be no more than 5000 words.\n\n5. The article should be published Open Access.\n\nPlease click here for further information (including article processing charges).\n\nNote:\n\nBefore a dataset can be submitted for publication the dataset must be deposited in a repository, along with the associated metadata for the dataset.\n\nFor reviewers:\n\n1. Does the article contain sufficient information on the dataset (e.g., DOI, data center, URL etc.)?\n\n2. Is the data collection method of a high scientific standard?\n\n3. Has the dataset been regularly updated, homogenized, and quality-controlled?\n\n4. Are there missing data that might undermine its usefulness?\n\n5. Is the spatial or temporal coverage good enough to make the data useable?\n\n6. Can the data be reused or the experiment be repeated?\n\n7. Do they use standard or community formats?\n\n8. Is the dataset easy to download?\n\n9. Does the article provide a comprehensive description of all the data?\n\n10. Does the dataset make an important and unique contribution to atmospheric and oceanic sciences?\n\n11. What range of applications does it have? Does it have a sustained use or interest to the science community?"
