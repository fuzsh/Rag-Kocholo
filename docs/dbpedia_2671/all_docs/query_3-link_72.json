        "text": "Storm Names for 2023 - 2024\n\nThroughout the year these pages will provide the latest updates and information as we name storms which we forecast will have an impact upon the UK.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen do we announce new storm names?\n\nSince Name our Storms first launched in 2015 we have issued a new list of names each September. The list runs from early September to late August the following year, to coincide with the start of autumn and the end of summer, when we see the likelihood of low-pressure systems and the potential for named storms increase.\n\nWhy are we naming storms?\n\nThe naming of storms using a single authoritative system provides a consistent message and aids the communication of approaching severe weather through media partners and other government agencies. In this way the public will be better placed to keep themselves, their property and businesses safe.\n\nCan I suggest a storm name?\n\nA new list of names will be compiled jointly between Met Éireann, the Met Office and KNMI (The Dutch national weather forecasting service).\n\nEveryone is welcome to suggest names for future consideration via email to [email protected] or through our online form. Any future names for the Met Office component of the list may be compiled from these suggestions.\n\nWhen is a storm named?\n\nIn the UK a storm will be named when it has the potential to cause disruption or damage which could result in an amber or red warning. This is based on our National Severe Weather Warnings service, which is a combination of both the impact the weather may have, and the likelihood of those impacts occurring.\n\nStorms will usually be named on the basis of the impacts from strong winds, but the impacts of other weather types will also be considered. For example rain, if its impact could lead to flooding as advised by the Environment Agency, SEPA and Natural Resources Wales flood warnings, or snow. Therefore 'storm systems' could be named on the basis of impacts from the wind but also include the impacts of rain and snow.\n\nHow is a storm named?\n\nWhen the criteria for naming a storm are met, either the Met Office, Met Éireann or KNMI can name a storm, taking the name from the latest list in alphabetical order.\n\nWe then let the public, our partners in government, the responder community and the media know through various routes including publishing details on our website and social media channels.\n\nYou can also follow the Met Office on Facebook or Twitter for the latest updates.\n\nUK and US Storm names?\n\nTo avoid any confusion over naming, if a storm is the remnants of a tropical storm or hurricane that has moved across the Atlantic, the name would not be changed and would follow the established method of being referred to as 'ex-hurricane Ophelia' for example.\n\nWe will only use names that have been officially designated by the National Weather Service in the US.\n\nDo other countries around the world use a similar system?\n\nIn Europe, the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands work together as the western storm naming group. Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Luxembourg together make up the south-western storm naming group and Norway, Sweden and Denmark are the northern group.\n\nWithin the North Atlantic Ocean, tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the National Hurricane Centre when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65 km/h, (40 mph). The World Meteorological Organisation maintains six alphabetical lists of names which alternate between masculine and feminine and are used on a six-year cycle. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) meeting.\n\nWhy are there no storms for Q, U, X, Y and Z?\n\nTo ensure we are in line with the US National Hurricane Centre naming conventions, we are not going to include names which begin with the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z. This will maintain consistency for official storm naming in the North Atlantic.\n\nHow are storm names chosen?\n\nWe receive thousands of suggestions throughout the year from the public and this years list has been compiled from these public suggestions, plus suggestions from Met Éireann and KNMI, choosing some of the more popular names and names that reflect the diversity of the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands.\n\nWhat does climate change mean for storms?"
