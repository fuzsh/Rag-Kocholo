        "text": "On August 6, 2024, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published the Secure by Demand Guide: How Software Customers Can Drive a Secure Technology Ecosystem. In particular, the guide highlights cybersecurity software acquisition considerations for organizations buying software.\n\nThe guide outlines how organizations can integrate product security considerations before, during, and following procurement.\n\nThe guide details software manufacturer questions that should be addressed, including:\n\nwhether the product supports secure authentication;\n\nhow the software manufacturer addresses software defects across its products, and what classes of vulnerability have been addressed;\n\nevidence of intrusions and the availability of security logs to customers;\n\ninformation on software supply chain security, including provenance data of third party dependencies and processes for governing the use of, contributions to, and open source software components; and\n\nwhether the software manufacturer demonstrates transparency and timeliness in vulnerability reports for on-premises and cloud products."
