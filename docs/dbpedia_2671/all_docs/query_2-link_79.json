        "text": "I mentioned at the end of last week’s post that I’d like to try time lapse photography. This week, I’ve been doing a bit more research. We’ve got a couple of Canon DSLRs at work so I had a look on the Canon website for more information on time lapse photography. There are four tutorial videos by award-wining photographer and “Canon Explorer of Light” Vincent Laforet.\n\nFrom the website:\n\n“Vincent Laforet introduces basic time lapse concepts including what to look for when searching for the ideal time lapse subjects, how to ensure smooth movement during playback, and other useful tips to get started.”\n\nI found the videos really informative and now think I could probably have a go at shooting a time lapse movie. Here’s a photo that might give a bit of a clue as to what I’d like to film…\n\nThe only slight issue is that I don’t think we have any of the lenses that Vincent recommends in his tutorial videos. I had a quick look online and they all seem to cost about £1500! I’ll have to see if I can do it with a cheaper wide-angle lens instead…\n\nThis week, a few of us attended an introductory course on filming and editing at Futureworks in Manchester. We spent four days learning how to plan, shoot and edit a short film.\n\nDay one was spent learning how our video camera works, how to shoot video using DSLR cameras and the basic principles of lighting. On the morning of day two we learned how to plan and storyboard a shoot; in the afternoon we went to Manchester Art Gallery (on location, as I believe it’s called!) to film a short piece about a couple of the current exhibitions there.\n\nDay three was spent in the editing suite where we learned how to import our clips, rearrange them, edit them and create a timeline. Day four was all about adding the finishing touches, audio, effects, titles, etc.\n\nHaving just completed the course, I feel we can now produce a short film by ourselves on our project for JISC. We’re all bursting with ideas about exciting content. I’m hoping we can get an intervalometer so we can do some time-lapse filming…"
