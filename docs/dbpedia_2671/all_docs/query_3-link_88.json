        "text": "On August 6, 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) requested public comments on the draft NIST Special Publication (SP) 1800-35 Implementing a Zero Trust Architecture.\n\nIn particular, the guide highlights that zero trust architecture (ZTA) enables secure authorized access enterprise resources that are distributed across on-premises and multiple cloud environments, while enabling a hybrid workforce and partners to access resources from anywhere. The guide stipulates that it aims to help organizations implement a ZTA that:\n\nsupports user access to resources regardless of user location or device (managed or unmanaged);\n\nprotects sensitive information and other business assets and processes regardless of their location (on-premises or cloud-based);\n\nlimits breaches by making it harder for attackers to move through an environment and by addressing the insider threat (insiders are not automatically trusted); and\n\nperforms continuous, real-time monitoring, logging, and risk-based assessment and enforcement of corporate policy.\n\nNotably, the guide clarifies that ZTAs for industrial control systems, operational technology, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are outside its scope.\n\nThe guide outlines challenges to implementing ZTA, including organization buy-in and support, missing foundational pieces, and technical challenges.\n\nIn deploying ZTA, the guide provides capabilities that are considered fundamental in determining whether access to a resource should be granted, and once granted, whether access should persist, detailing:\n\nauthentication and period authentication requesting user's identity;\n\nauthentication and period authentication of the requesting endpoint;\n\nauthentication and period authentication of the endpoint that is hosting the resource being accessed;\n\nverification and periodic reverification requesting endpoint's health; and\n\nverification and periodic reverification of the endpoint hosting the resource being accessed.\n\nPublic comments may be submitted here until September 30, 2024."
