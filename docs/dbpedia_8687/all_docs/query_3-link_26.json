        "text": "A few days back we shared an image of Eileen Dietz (The Exorcist) with a pug. The image from Of the Devil really was largely out of context but at the time that’s the only image that was being circulated. Well today we have the first trailer and it looks wild.\n\nThe upcoming film Of the Devil stars Eileen Dietz. If the name sounds familiar it is because the actress played the iconic face of Pazuzu in The Exorcist. You remember the face, it was the one that would flash on screen and send your spine through the roof. In addition Dietz played possessed Regan when effects were too intense for the young actress Linda Blair. So, it is great to see Dietz returning to the possession genre.\n\nThe description for Of the Devil goes like this:\n\n‘a family desperate to find a cure for their young son’s brain cancer. When unconventional treatments lead to the child being possessed by an ancient evil, the parents must fight not only for the child’s life but also his soul.‘\n\nJudging from the trailer Of the Devil is going to really push the envelope. You can tell that it doesn’t want to be another generic possession film. It is attempting to step outside the box. I’m hoping it is successful in doing that because there is nothing worse these days than a generic possession film.\n\nOf the Devil is set to possess on digital beginning August 9.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nIn the history of awesome ideas, an Alien vs. Predator (AVP) reboot seems like a great one. So it’s exciting to hear that Alien: Romulus director Fede Álvarez is entertaining the possibility.\n\nAccording to JoBlo, quoting Deadline, Álvarez would love to partner with director Dan Trachtenberg on the project. Trachtenberg directed Prey, a Predator prequel, back in 2022.\n\n“Maybe it’s something I have to co-direct with my buddy Dan,” Álvarez said. “Maybe we should do like Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez did with From Dusk Till Dawn. I’ll direct half, and he’ll direct the other half. It depends on how well this [Romulus] does, if people want to see that.”\n\nThe AVP films (there are two) are fun, but they don’t seem to be taken seriously enough by fans as canon. In fact, proper prequels Prometheus and Covenant dismiss the ideas presented in Alien vs. Predator as part of the official storyline in that universe.\n\nStill, they are fun in a comic book sort of way—the medium from which they were adapted.\n\nStudios have toyed with the versus battle concept using IPs from their catalogs before. Take, for instance, Freddy vs. Jason, in which the two iconic slashers cross into each other’s realms to fight for victims.\n\nThe fun with this kind of setup is guessing “who would win?” But often, the answer isn’t concrete, since filmmakers don’t want to anger fans on either side. Often, they leave it as a draw.\n\nIf Álvarez plans to make this work, he would have to disrupt Ridley Scott’s timeline a bit or create his own spin-off universe in which these two monsters meet. Or perhaps he could build off the existing AVP storyline, ignoring Scott’s universe entirely.\n\nEither way, it sounds like a fun time at the movies, and with these two directors behind the project, its potential is endless.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nPrometheus continues its reign as the highest-grossing opening day Alien film to date; Fede Alvarez’s Alien: Romulus came close but couldn’t quite break the record. With a solid $41 million in domestic ticket sales and an impressive $66.7 million from international markets, Romulus has secured a strong global debut of $108 million.\n\nDespite a mix of reviews, with some suggesting that Alien: Romulus rehashes elements from previous films, the overall reception has been positive. The film currently holds a “Fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an 82% approval from critics and an impressive 86% from fans. While there were concerns on social media about the bold narrative choices in the third act, Romulus has still managed to capture the attention of audiences worldwide, particularly in international markets where it outperformed expectations.\n\nIn second place, Deadpool & Wolverine continued to draw crowds, earning $29 million, though it saw a 46% drop in attendance.\n\nThe much-discussed It Ends With Us held the third spot with $24 million, while Twisters remained a fan favorite, experiencing only a 34% drop and bringing in $9.8 million.\n\nA surprise entry into the top five was Fathom Event’s re-release of 2009’s Coraline, which resonated with audiences, earning $8.3 million and landing just above the unstoppable Despicable Me 4 at $6 million.\n\nShyamalan’s Trap faced a steep decline, slipping to number seven with $3.4 million after a 48% drop in viewership.\n\nDisney’s Inside Out 2 continues to perform steadily, adding $3.2 million to its total and gearing up for its digital release on August 20.\n\nIndian horror film Stree 2 debuted in 666 U.S. theaters, earning a respectable $2.5 million, placing it just ahead of Borderlands, which struggled to find its footing. Despite a strong cast and a popular video game franchise, Borderlandsbrought in a modest $2.5 million and saw an alarming 72% drop in attendance, indicating it may soon head to digital rental platforms.\n\nComing Up:\n\nThis week, Lionsgate takes a chance with The Crow as it makes its theatrical debut. Though some fans may be skeptical about the reboot, the film stars Bill Skarsgård, whose popularity across generations could give it a significant boost.\n\nMeanwhile, Miramax’s underdog Strange Darling opens on Friday, generating considerable buzz with a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. While this type of excitement has sometimes led to mixed fan reactions in the past—such as with Neon’s Longlegs and Cuckoo—Strange Darling might just be the surprise hit of the week.\n\nLet us know what you’re planning to watch this week, whether at home or in theaters.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals"
