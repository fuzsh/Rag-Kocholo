        "text": "Nowt as queer as folk\n\nBut, had they lived very, very long lives, they could not have expected nor would they have wished to see as much of the mad and macabre as they were to see that day. For them an idyllic summer afternoon drive became a nightmare. The events of that day were to lead to the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\n\nJohn Larroquette, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\n\nDirector: Tobe Hooper\n\nWriter: Kim Henkel, Tobe Hooper\n\nProducer: Tobe Hooper\n\nStarring: Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, Gunnar Hansen\n\nReleased: 11th October 1974\n\nTrailer\n\nFor a film that spawned eight sequels, three video games, numerous comics and a novel, there is nothing like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The film is raw and feral, and any attempt to imitate what it achieves fall short. It’s legacy is such that it simultaneously has a reputation that doesn’t hold up when the film is actually seen (there is little to no gore, and the chainsaw only is used to kill someone once) and at the same time absolutely does (it is terrifying). In my black little heart, it remains one of the scariest films I have ever seen, a reputation even more worthy considering it holds up after rewatching and fifty years since its release.\n\nI first encountered the film nearly twenty years ago. I had decided in my youth that I wanted to watch what I thought of as the second generation of horror cinematic icons (after the Universal icons of the 30s and 40s). This included Jason Voorhees of Friday 13th, Michael Myers of Halloween, Freddy Kreuger of A Nightmare on Elm Street and of course Leatherface. At the time I did this was probably around the time of the remakes that came around in the early/mid-00s, but I was fully aware of the characters and their reputation. In any case, my very understanding parents indulged this and for that Christmas I got a DVD of each of those character’s first film in their franchise. Looking back, I can’t actually believe they did that.\n\nI watched each of those films, with varying responses to each, but The Texas Chain Saw Massacre remains one of the most unique responses I’ve ever had to a film before or since. I probably watched it under the right conditions too – in summer, with the curtains drawn but the heat still pounding through and alone in my bedroom. By the end of the film, with Leatherface’s now iconic frustrated swinging of the chainsaw, I felt like poor Sally desperate to get out of there. I felt like inches away from madness myself, and a feeling of dread and anxiety very few films have inspired since, and almost none have done so upon a rewatch. Only Texas Chain Saw still has that effect on me.\n\nLater films lose what made the original so potent. Ironically, what drew me to the film in the first place is probably not what makes it so effective. Don’t get me wrong, Leatherface is absolutely iconic and deserves his iconic status – but in retrospect, he was not necessarily a character to build a film franchise around, as repeatedly bad sequels and remakes have shown. Unlike the other modern icons mentioned above, he’s not really a slasher villain like Freddy or Jason or Michael. Leatherface isn’t about that. Instead, what makes the original film so potent is the unexpected genre work beneath the surface that the less successful versions that came after don’t get. It seems strange to put an American film with such a violent reputation in the same breath as more subtle films as The Wicker Man, Blood on Satan’s Claw or the modern work of Ben Wheatley, but The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is an example of a Folk Horror film.\n\nThe film’s iconic opening depicts some bizarre grotesque art displayed in a graveyard, before crashing into the opening credits with its discordant noises and cymbals that would make Tom Waits pause and wonder if he had gone too far. It perfectly sets up the tone of the film. This is strange and inhuman, which is then soundtracked with news on the radio of similarly horrific events around them, including reports from Vietnam and combined with a discussion about horoscopes amongst the vulnerable hippies. Every image and word presented to the audience is there to show that this is a deranged world that doesn’t make sense, with only ritual giving some semblance of meaning.\n\nPart of what fits this into the folk horror tradition is the feeling of ritual that permeates in the film. The above described opening sequence depicts the creating of an altar. The altar is a paean to death, though in doing so it is also a desecration. It thematically links with the implicit cannibalism later of the film, but it permeates throughout. As well as the graveyard, there is the slaughterhouse, the old house and the house of the family. Everywhere is dead or dying. Even the setting, briefly mentioned, is Muerto County – muerto being the Spanish for death. In some sense, it is trying to give death a meaning and utility. But these places hold within them great power as the family worship death and its many permutations.\n\nThe film is about death, and attempts to repurpose that death into something else, none of it nice. The most prominent is the cannibalism, which if anyone watching doesn’t at least consider vegetarianism the film has failed! There is the early discussion of what happens at the slaughterhouse, which has become industrialised animal murder that lacks the human touch. It is echoed in Grandpa’s ‘attempts’ at murdering Sally, who’s very human interaction in his slaughtering is what makes it even more inhuman. The victims are heavily hinted at being turned into the gas station BBQ (one wonders what the sausage was Franklin has hanging from his mouth). Each member of the family even has their own role to play in the process: the Hitchhiker brands them, Leatherface slaughters them, and the Old Man just cooks them. It is death at its most practical, the rending and tearing of flesh, human instead of cow, that gives those deaths their hideous purpose. It is clear that the old ways are meant to be the best ways.\n\nBut that’s not all. There are the sculptures and offerings left at the abandoned house, the one hanging from the doorway prefiguring the stick versions from The Blair Witch Project. In the main house, there are the skins pinned to the wall, the preserved body of grandma, seeing the furniture interlaced with bones repurposed for furniture and into further tools of death worship. Leatherface has a face for every occasion – literally. Even on the relatively homely American looking exterior, the house seems to leak teeth. Combined with the practicality of eating what you kill, there is a utility to death. It has a use. No part of their murdering is wasted. It pervades their lives entirely, the everyday rituals becoming tinged with death for the folk who live in that house.\n\nThough there is nothing in the film that is outwardly magic or supernatural, the film hints at some wider worship. Again, the altar of corpses at the film’s opening is a worship of death, but the blood smear on the side of the truck also feels like it should have cult significance. The feasting on flesh as a ritual, as well as the symbolism of the day and moon at play, all hint at some grander purpose. Though thankfully it never goes the route of the worst Halloween sequels Cult of Thorn nonsense, and there is no Carcosa a la True Detective series 1, it again unsettles the viewer in thinking that this madness of the family has some motive rooted in ritual and tradition we are not privy to. It is all in service of death, and there is no real logic here, only madness – but the fear is that there is method to it too, if only you would care to understand.\n\nIn a way, it forms a sick commentary on America at the time. There is a gas shortage, people are losing their jobs not only due to recession but increased industrialisation. The family of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre are doing what they need to do to survive in a modern America, adapting their old ways into new. It explains the chainsaw at least. It is set in Texas, a place that has numerous power cuts thanks to extreme weather and still won’t (or can’t) update the power grid that supplies them. It is stuck in the past, proudly so. The family still live under the patriarchal discretion of the feeble Grandfather, clinging to their old ways in the face of death and even embracing and inflicting it upon the others. For them, death is a gift they want to share. It is a sick parody of American suburban life, right up to the family dinner. It’s almost as if they cannot accept what is wrong about their way of life, clinging and creating their own form of ritual as a substitute. It sticks to that folk horror form, where these rituals take on meaning and importance that appear arcane and strange to the outside influencers.\n\nThe teens, scant characterisation there there is, represent a more modern movement. They have some interest in the old ways – their discussion of their horoscopes, Franklin’s recollection of the childhood home and slaughterhouse – but they are frivolous. They seem to not be really aware of the depth of death that goes on around them, meaning all of the deaths catch them by surprise in their ferocity. They don’t really understand what is going on, and seem to choose to ignore it. They ignore the radio news that seem to be describing just as horrible crimes in the area, they ignore the warnings from the Old Man, they ignore that off-putting atmosphere of the family’s homestead, which has rotted away incredibly quickly considering their childhood memories. Modernity only gives a veneer of respectability to a world that still contains monsters. It’s a world around them is awful, and until they are directly confronted by it they can try their best to happily carry on in ignorance. Not since Sgt. Howie of The Wicker Man, released the previous year, has someone ignored more obvious signs to get the hell out.\n\nThe film acts as metaphor for the horrors of Vietnam, a war that would not end for another year. It is not about Vietnam explicitly, but the madness and horror that is scarred the American psyche with. The madness infects the very celluloid of the film (Edwin Neal (the Hitchhiker) famously said the filming was worse than his actual Vietnam experience), and the teen’s indifference to the horror until it is too late recalls America’s reaction to Vietnam. The treatment of its veterans suggest that it is a twenty year failure they would rather not think about, similar to how the teens ignore all the warnings around them only to suffer the consequences regardless. The new ways promise civility, but they are dulled in the face of the old way ferocity.\n\nThen there is the repeated use of the moon. Considering how much happens within the film itself, it is remarkably what a short span it is set during. Literally, the vast majority of it takes place over one day, with some of its most memorably horrific scenes taking place during daylight: the first appearance of Leatherface, the Hitchhiker, the final escape are all visceral experiences where the light leaves no place to hide. But the moon reappears not as the classical feminine symbol (the family seem to lack any living female members, reproducing by abiogenesis apparently) but as symbol of the lunatic. Like Renfield in Dracula, our lunatics are at their most active when the moon is at its height. The Old Man seems almost normal when we first see him, but the moon’s presence unleashes unfettered rage. He loses the taste for murder as the sun rises, and the oncoming morning seems to diminish the powers of everyone else too: Grandpa who danced with joy when sucking Sally’s blood is lethargic and cannot actually kill her, the Hitchhiker is killed and Leatherface can’t catch up. Though not explicit in the film, the symbol ties us back to the folk horror at play, and Leatherface’s final frustrated dance in the morning light a frustration at their loss.\n\nIt is a horrible film, deliciously so. Though Tobe Hooper would go on to have a very fine career with films and moments that are as iconic as what is shown here (the vampires of ‘Salem’s Lot, the clown in Poltergeist), nothing he did after had the raw visceral power of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It remains a giant of the genre, still unique in its capacity to scare. There have been many imitators – heck, there have been reboots and sequels aplenty too – but none have come close to touching that little house out in Muerto County, Texas.\n\nNotes\n\nBearing in mind the film’s folk horror roots, I think later films lose that and focus more on the slasher aspect. A spiritual sequel that follows Texas Chain Saw‘s roots much better would be the episode of The X-Files from season 4 called Home. Fans are advised that this is only got repeated once, and carried with it a viewer discretion warning at the beginning. It’s that good.\n\nThe family is often referred to as the Sawyers or Hewitt’s, but the original film gives them no such name. The name Sawyer comes from the first sequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, and Hewitt from the remake series. The most recent film, which gives the series a third continuity to contend with, gives him the surname Slaughter, which is exactly as subtle as the rest of that film.\n\nTrouble at Mill\n\n“Nobody’s gonna get hurt, Big Jim,” Randolph said, hoping he was right. “This is Chester’s Mill. If it was New York City, things might be different.”\n\nStephen King, Under the Dome\n\nIn my Lisey’s Story essay, I noted that I only had two DNF from prior to starting this project. Under the Dome was the second. Now, I want to make it clear, this is not an issue of quality. For the longest time, The Stand was also a DNF until I got an audiobook version to get me through (though for this project, I did read a physical copy). The reason I did not finish Under the Dome was due to the sheer enormity of it. I mean, look at it! It’s King’s third longest book, another door-stopper of a book. When I bought my copy over ten years ago (amusingly, I got it for £7.99 new, which would certainly not be true today!), I started it, and then just never carried on. Part of the joy of this project is to go back and slay this particular giant.\n\nIn reading it now, I’m not sure why I didn’t read it back then (I mean, I do know – I was at university and had a prescribed reading list that didn’t leave room for a nearly 900 hundred page novel). The books rips through its story at a fair old pace that even at its not inconsiderable page count makes it a relatively quick read. I might go so far as to say – lean in close, I don’t want anyone else to hear this – it’s quite a bit better than The Stand.\n\nSacrilege, I know! And in that book’s defence, I don’t think we would have got Under the Dome without the experience of some of those other weighty tomes. In fact, I feel like Under the Dome fits into a rough pattern than King seems to do once a decade. Following in the footsteps of The Stand, It, and Needful Things, it seems like every so often King takes stock of the America around him and thinks about how best to talk about it. Each of those books goes deeper into the dark heart of America, exposing the ‘aw shucks’ attitude some typify King with as a thin patina under which there is roiling rage just waiting to freed under the right conditions.\n\nBecause of the focus of the book is on the tiniest of tiny towns, the specificity with which King describes the different forces at work here have wider resonances than maybe even King intended. Taking into account the year it was published, King is clearly talking about a post-9/11, post-Bush, post-Afghanistan America, with a liberal dollop of Jim Jones thrown into the mix. It even starts with a plane crash. Reading it now fifteen years later, the political divide described in the book seems only more stark, and Big Jim Rennie is more Trumpian than Greg Stillson back in The Dead Zone.\n\nI am aware that Trump existed prior to 2016. The Apprentice began airing in 2004, and so America was very used to the user-car salesman writ large, even excluding that time he lied about now having the tallest tower in New York on actual 9/11, or called for the death penalty to be used on the Central Park Five case when they turned out to be innocent. In such an instance, it easy to put him on the same pedestal as Jim Jones, a cult leader who preyed on the vulnerable and whose actions led to the death of nearly a thousand people in a single afternoon. Both are speakers who were able to prey upon others’ fear to feed their own narcissism. Big Jim is a similar character to both (and Jones is even name dropped in the book), though I imagine King also had in mind Dick Cheney, the man who arguably led America into the War on Terror.\n\nBig Jim is one of King’s vilest characters, a man who you loathe on every page. I haven’t felt such visceral hatred for a character, let alone a King character, in a long while. King’s politics are clear from anyone who has followed him on Twitter or heard him speak. I don’t think King could have written a character like this earlier in the decade, and only now that the dust had settled somewhat since 9/11 that America was realising what had happened in the years since. Jim’s dismissiveness to his own son and hatred of Obama (there are hints the story is set in the very near future) echoes that of Trump’s; the ruling by fear, the othering and advancing grand conspiracy theories very much from Cheney and Jones, the fact he’s a weirdo. That he is a used car salesman only emphasises King’s feelings on the politics of the time. There is also the increased militarisation of the police, turning them from plain old small town police into the SS. Again, that has become crushingly more relevant as time has passed.\n\nThere is also King’s endless fascination with Religion, particularly the organised kind. The best person of faith is in fact the one who lost it, Piper Libby, who by her actions is arguably the most Christian of them all. She tries to do right consistently. Lester Coggins, the other minister of Chester’s Mill, is driven to insanity by his faith but at least his moral compass is righted in the end. It is Jim Rennie who pays lip service to faith that twists the religion, so that the politics and religion become twisted up. America has it in their constitution that State and Religion should be separated, and yet this is never true in practice. Big Jim demonstrates a horrific endpoint for their muddling of ideas, where the faith in religion elevates politicians to become a godhead who can do whatever they like with those around them.\n\nThe politics are an obviously huge part of the book, but so is the green aspect of the story, arguably a more important aspect than the politics. As the people of Chester’s Mill pass each day burning their propane and BBQs, the surface of the dome grows increasingly murky with pollen and pollution. The final scenes of the explosion accelerate matters, but the dome itself becomes a metaphor for climate change. It’s another one of those metaphors that has only become increasingly uncomfortable in the years following. While the people play their political games, they ignore the growing problem in the air around them. The people are essentially powerless to effect change, but those in power are only focused on shoring of their power with greater and greater steps, until it becomes too late and the world burns. Those final scenes, when the guilty and innocent alike are choking on the fumes, are perhaps the scariest of the entire novel.\n\nBut in writing a novel so sprawling and focused at the same time, King has created something that becomes an endless metaphor vehicle, so that all manner of other readings are available should one want to put in the work. Our lead character of Dale ‘Barbie’ Barbara could easily be taken to be queer with a name like that, and he and his group of political misfits representing the queer fear and persecution they face from the religious right. Bear in mind, America had only begun to legalise gay marriage in 2004 in Massachusetts, and progressively more states until 2015. Or the group could be seen as anarchists in the political sense, or any other political state defined in part by opposition to conservatism. Heck, you could see this as about the treatment of animals by higher species if you wanted to go vegan about it! In writing such a highly specific book, King has managed to write something that speaks to the time in which it was written as well as those who may discover it since. Reading the book post-pandemic, there is even an argument to be made this book represents the feelings of lockdown and isolation better than The Stand did. There’s so much in the book, it’s hard to cover it all. It merits a read, if only to discover what it all means to you.\n\nThe book chugs along at such a pace that it’s hard to believe that the story essentially takes place only over the course of seven days: it took God seven days to create the universe and the leatherheads a week to show how quickly we can burn it down. There is some criticism towards the ending, which some feel is rushed and abrupt. I can see that criticism, similar to the similar issues people have with The Stand, It, and Needful Things‘ endings. Having spent hundreds of pages with these characters, it can be rough saying goodbye to them. But I think it depends on how you look at the book as a whole. In its most simplistic, Big Jim Rennie is a bully playing school ground politics, and the leatherheads are just the next bully up with their peer pressure antics.\n\nOr maybe it’s just King giving us a chink of hope, a warning in the end. These horrible things happen under the dome if we let them, but we are all together in the end. We are all a victim of regressive politics, overreaching religion, a warming planet, and unless we do anything we too can be left choking on what little air is left.\n\nObservations and Connections\n\nRight off the bat, we know we’re in King country. The map included at the beginning of the book shows Chester’s Mill is down the road from Castle Rock (various, from The Dead Zone to Needful Things), the TR-90 unincorporated township and Harlow (Bag of Bones). Shawshank Penitentiary (Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption) and Derry (It, amongst others) are also mentioned throughout. Chester’s Mill is also close to Tarker’s Mill, referencing perhaps King’s shortest book, Cycle of the Werewolf. There is something enormously pleasing about one of King’s longest novels referencing his shortest.\n\nJulia Shumway and Chester’s Mill itself were first mentioned in N., a story from Just After Sunset. Myra Evans may be the same as Myra, the big Elvis fan, from Needful Things, though it isn’t a clear connection, and she isn’t around long enough to confirm either way.\n\nInterestingly, when Rusty goes to the orchard to investigate he finds a strange symbol carved there. That symbol is the same as the one found on the door to Pennywise’s lair from It. There was also an inscription on the Tommyknockers’ craft, though this one was not illustrated. Why it returns or how they are linked is anyone’s guess, as they all appear to be quite distinct alien species.\n\nA relatively minor character called Joe McClatchey seems to have a blog called Scarecrow Joe’s Rants and Raves. I’m unsure if it is canon to the book, as I can’t find any official word on it, though there are various links to other websites related to the book in-universe. It references a lot of King books as books, so I’m inclined to say no. However, it is an interesting read.\n\nThere is speculation online within the fiction of the book that Cthulhu is behind all this. In the same scene, the film version of The Mist is mentioned. Considering that would be an Apocalypse book, it seems fair that on this level of the Tower the events of The Mist are a movie. There is also a cameo from a military policeman called Jack Reacher, which almost certainly is a reference to Lee Child’s creation. And when Junior returns to the scene of the crime near the book’s start, there is a brief mention of King’s old friend George Romero and the classic Night of the Living Dead. There is also a reference to Brian K. Vaughn, a very good comic writer who would be best known at the time for Y: The Last Man. It’s interesting, as I wonder how much King would be aware of a comic like that at the time. I suspect it may have been Joe’s influence there.\n\nThere’s a moment where one minor character muses on becoming a writer, but dismisses it, saying ‘what if you spent all that time, wrote a thousand-pager, and it sucked?‘ At the point you read that in the book, you’ll have made your own mind up whether King had succeeded in that endeavour yourself.\n\nFinally, though Under the Dome came out after The Simpsons Movie, King has the receipts to back up that he had the idea long before America’s favourite yellow family got there, beginning as The Cannibals in 1972. Even so, a year later, Mr Burns tries to do it again, now directly inspired by King, in The Fool Monty. The Under the Dome series did the same for The Simpsons. It’s weird.\n\nUP NEXT: Just after Sunset, we can expect it to be Full Dark, No Stars.\n\nLights! Camera! Blood!\n\nWord fiction and movie fiction differ in one fundamental way: the former is almost always the creation of a solitary mind, the latter a collaborative effort forged by many, from director to costume designer to set decorator.\n\nStephen King, Stephen King Goes to the Movies\n\nFor reasons I am not entirely clear, 2009 saw the release of rather pointless book, Stephen King Goes to the Movies. I remember picking this book up in my early days of reading King and quickly putting it back on the shelf after I realised it was a compilation of short stories published in other books. For this series entry, I’m not rereading any of the stories specific to this collection. Rather, I am going to use the book as an excuse to discuss Stephen King and the importance of movies to his continuing popularity as an author. Before I do, it is probably worth mentioning the stories that are collected here for completeness. They are, in order:\n\n1408, which first appeared as a work in progress in On Writing, and collected in completed form in Everything’s Eventual.\n\nThe Mangler, which was collected in Night Shift\n\nLow Men in Yellow Coats, which was collected in Hearts in Atlantis\n\nRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, which was collected in Different Seasons\n\nChildren of the Corn, which was collected in Night Shift\n\nFor almost as long as there have been Stephen King books, there have been Stephen King movies. In fact, part of the reason that Richard Bachman existed was so King could see if his success was off his own talent or as a result of the first adaptation of his work, Brian de Palma’s Carrie, two years after the publication of the novel. King never really got an answer to his doubts, as the Bachman identity was exposed after the publication of Thinner, but I’m not sure it really matters either way.\n\nThough I remain I great fan of the novel Carrie, the film does a lot of great work in adapting the book. In the mind of the general public, Sissy Spacek’s wide-eyed performance is far more iconic than the overweight Carrie of the book, to the point that any modern adaptation sticks to the willowy look of the original film. de Palma cranks up the horror, streamlines the ending and disposes of epistolary element. The film is a classic, but to put all the credit to de Palma would be a disservice to King’s original, primal story that contains within such strength. The film is surprisingly faithful to the original, and watching the film you can hear sections of dialogue lifted straight from the book. As much as I would love to see a version closer to the book, especially considering the art here showing what it could like, I think this shows a recognition of the power of King’s book that it appears almost as is without changes on the screen. Many other writers have suffered through changes in adaptation that make you wonder why they even bothered.\n\nThough King has utterly sustained his writing career based on his talent and audience he has built up over time, I think it’s hard to argue against the idea that his early popularity was absolutely bolstered by the first adaptations of his book. After Carrie came Tobe Hooper’s TV adaptation of ‘Salem’s Lot and Kubrick’s The Shining. All three have images burned into public consciousness to this day, and though the text is the source, it is undeniable that the directors are important in crafting those images. This is perhaps even more true for The Shining, where the most iconic moments of the film aren’t even present at all in the book except as throwaway lines at most.\n\nIt is rare (if not impossible) for a book, any book, to ever reach more numbers than a film of TV audience can. Those early films did a lot to cement the idea that King was a horror maestro. Yet in reading all the books, I think there is a far wider variety to King’s writing that he is generally given credit for, even in the early years. While he certainly skews towards horror, he has science fiction and thrillers quite early on with The Dead Zone, The Stand and Firestarter and he isn’t characterised by those so much. He could even be accused of literature thanks to Different Seasons in those first few years! But those first three, books and films, did so much to create the image of Stephen King we still have today.\n\nIn those early days, King was blessed by the directors who took on his work. de Palma, Kubrick and Hooper (on a good day, Mangler notwithstanding) have already been mentioned, but King also had the likes of George Romero at his peak (Creepshow), David Cronenberg (The Dead Zone) and John Carpenter (Christine) among those directing those early adaptations. Any author should be so lucky to have some of the finer directors, including arguably the greatest director of the 20th century, adapting your books for film. Even if King would end up bitching about The Shining, it’s hard to deny Kubrick’s pedigree. And it’s not like King did it better when he had a go.\n\nI think the 80s films do a lot to make that decade look his Golden Period in general, regardless of his substance abuse problems. There is an almost impossibly high quality to those films, sometimes elevating the original text and at worst complimenting it. Even the less successful films from that decade are entertaining (Maximum Overdrive, Children of the Corn). It’s not until we get to the 90s when it seems we take King for granted that the adaptations slip in quality, especially considering the notorious Lawnmower Man. Yes, the highs are incredibly high (any Darabont or Reiner film) but the lows are very low or worse, outright forgettable. I didn’t even know some of the books I’ve read had films made until I started researching them for essays (The Dark Half and Desperation, for example). But even those TV adaptations (The Stand, It), his place on video rental walls as well as King’s original pieces for the screen (from Sleepwalkers to Rose Red) made sure the audience is reminded of him every so often, keeping him fresh and refreshed for new audiences.\n\nBut the thing about a decent King adaptation is that it has helped ensure a legacy. King would write no matter what happened, and I think he would always be successful, but a good movie adaptation reminds people that he’s still around and writing good stories. No matter how King feels about it, more people have probably seen Kubrick’s The Shining than have read it. Heck, probably more people have seen that episode of Friends where Joey read the book (even though all the references are to the unique film iconography and gets the book entirely wrong). We’re also at the point where those who grew up reading and watching King are now the ones adapting and celebrating his work. Creators like Mike Flanagan (Gerald’s Game, The Life of Chuck and The Dark Tower), Bryan Fuller (remake of Carrie and the cancelled Christine) or Sam Lake (King-inspired works like Alan Wake and Control) credit King as deep influences on their own work, and the unexpected, worldwide success of It: Chapter 1 seemed to make King movies a hot commodity once again. Even the kids who I teach, who have never even heard of Stephen King (except because of me, obvs), know who Pennywise the Dancing Clown is.\n\nCompare this to some of his contemporaries. This is no judgement as to the quality of the work, whether it be book of film, but Michael Crichton, Clive Barker or Dean Koontz have seen brief success with some adaptations, and then generally very quiet in terms of their books. Genre fans know and revere them still, but there isn’t the same continued mainstream success that King has enjoyed for over forty years. There’s not a kid alive who has heard of Odd Thomas. Yet King just keeps going.\n\nSo in the end, though I have to believe that while King owes some of his success and continued popularity to the adaptations of his books, the fact they are still making them and they are still successful is down to the mind who originated them. It was all there on the page in the first place.\n\nObservations and Connections\n\nThough there are no new connections not found in the original stories, there is annoying amount of new writing in this collection for a completionist with King’s brief introductions to each story, wherein he talks about the adaptations themselves. He seems to enjoy all of them, to greater or lesser degrees, and amusingly pitches a crossover between the Children of the Corn and the Leprechaun series (“I wanted to hear that little leprechaun guy shouting, “Give me back me corn!” in his cute little Irish accent,” King says).\n\nThe only other addition is a list of his top ten favourite adaptations of his work, in alphabetical order. They are: Apt Pupil, Cujo, Dolores Claiborne, 1408, The Green Mile, Misery, The Mist, The Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me (adapted from The Body) and Storm of the Century. I’d quibble with that last one, as that was an original script he wrote, not an adaptation. In the years since, we have seen a number of great adaptations, so I wonder what King would list now.\n\nNot that anyone asked, but my personal selection would be: Carrie, Doctor Sleep, 1408, Gerald’s Game, It: Chapter 1 (not 2), The Shining, Misery, The Mist, Secret Window (which I really liked!), and Stand by Me. I haven’t seen the prison ones yet, don’t shout at me.\n\nOne final reflection. Though they have briefly flirted with each other with Rose Red, The Talisman and that bit in Ready Player One, I still can’t believe that King and Spielberg haven’t properly done something together. One still lives in hope.\n\nUP NEXT: Before The Simpsons Movie, there was Under the Dome.\n\nIf you go down to the woods today…\n\nIt’s not the same on film is it? I mean, you know it’s real, but it’s like looking through the lens gives you some sort of protection from what’s on the other side.\n\nJoshua Leonard as Josh, The Blair Witch Project\n\nDirector: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez\n\nWriter: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez\n\nProducer: Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie\n\nStarring: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard\n\nReleased: 16th July 1999 (wide release)\n\nTrailer\n\nIt has been twenty-five years since the release the The Blair Witch Project, and its reputation remains as divisive as it was when it was first released. Any film that is inflicted with the label of ‘scariest film of all time,’ is always going to have those who see the film and come out scoffing. Really? That was what scared you? But by that same token, there are absolutely people who are invested in this film, and it still inspires more stories with sequel films and video games to this day. Regardless of which side you fall on, it is undeniable that The Blair Witch Project had a huge impact on culture.\n\nOne of the biggest was the popularisation of the Found Footage genre. It did not invent the genre. Films of this nature had been going for years, with notable antecedents including Ghostwatch, Cannibal Holocaust and arguably the film that was the first to do it, The Legend of Boggy Creek. You could even point to Welles’s infamous radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds, and literature had been doing epistolary novels for literally centuries (when introducing Dracula to kids, I often describe it as a ‘found footage book’). The idea was not new, but the presentation of it had perhaps never been as effective.\n\nIt is undeniable that without Blair Witch, there would not be the glut of found footage horror that still is made and popular today. I admit, I have a particular soft spot for found footage. Despite everything, I still have fondness for the Paranormal Activity films, have watched all the Hell House LLC. films, and endured endless dross to find those gems. Go onto Amazon Prime (or Shudder if you have it) and the number of found footage films still getting made has exploded since Blair Witch. Like zombie films before them, they are cheap to make and easier than ever to distribute: Host was made under lockdown conditions and Marble Hornets is a massively influential YouTube found footage horror, to name just two. Something about them almost circumvents many of the critical faculties in my brain and still gives this jaded horror fan a visceral thrill I struggle to find from much other newly consumed horror.\n\nMore than anything, I think the divisive reputation of the Blair Witch goes hand in hand with the form it takes, and speaks I think to a wider point about film in general. Film is fundamentally quite silly when you think about it, horror films doubly so. We watch people on big screens perform for own amusement, and they can make us laugh and cry… And sometimes, they scare us. Our hearts race, our palms sweat, the hairs on the back of neck stand up. Romance or comedy at least make a degree of sense for enjoyment, but horror is meant to scare us. Except it’s silly – why would anyone want that? I’m not asking why people enjoy horror, as enough have pontificated about that question to greater or lesser degrees. But more interesting is why it does it succeed in scaring us? We know in reality there are no ghosts or witches, werewolves or monsters; serial killers are rare anomalies, and they certainly don’t act like Jason or Hannibal Lector. None of these things are real, and they are all faintly ridiculous when you think about it.\n\nWhich leads me to a little theory that takes us back to the effectiveness of The Blair Witch Project. All stories, in whatever form, ask of their audience to ‘buy in.’ The hook or premise of the story, from where all things must flow, asks their audience not necessarily to believe in what they are about to be presented with, but to go along with it. Most genres invite us to be empathetic observers. Comedy wants us to laugh at the antics of the characters, drama and romance to empathise; the best kind of horror wants us to do the same, and a little more too. Horror wants us to experience.\n\nI think for lots of people, horror asking for its audience to join in and experience it is why many don’t enjoy it. I enjoy horror comedy, but that’s certainly an easier ask than going along with pure horror. It’s why I have a particular dislike for what I think of as Hypocritical Horror, which criticises its audience for watching the nasty things it’s presenting to us. It’s as if those films can’t quite believe they exist in the first place and have to question their audience as to their point of existence. Why am I watching it? I dunno man, I just the bought the DVD, you’re the one who made this.\n\nBut the best kind of horror takes us by the hand and leads us down to the woods for an experience. Not all horror wants to do this, but for my money the best does. It should be visceral and horrific, it should unnerve us and haunt us long after we watch the film. The very best of horror continues to do that even when we’ve grown familiar with the scares we’ve seen so many times. Your mileage may vary: I adore The Evil Dead, but it will never invoke the same reaction in me that the first viewing did. But that experience of watching it is what makes horror such an attractive proposition for so many.\n\nFound Footage Horror, I would argue, takes it a step further. It’s not simply asking us to observe or to experience: it is asking its audience to believe.\n\nThis is the greatest ask The Blair Witch Project makes of its audience. Film as already mentioned, is sort of ridiculous, but we go along with it because it’s aim is to entertain us. How much the film asks of us is unique, film by film, genre by genre. It’s why you get older men who only watch war films or documentaries. Horror might ask the most of its audience, and Found Footage asks more than other subgenere within in.\n\nThis is where the divisive nature of The Blair Witch Project comes from. How much can you ‘buy in?’ It asks for us to observe, to experience and to believe, which for audiences is a big, big ask. For many it is too much. If you don’t or can’t do it, then the following eighty minutes can be ridiculous trek in the woods with three idiot film students where nothing happens. That’s fine if you can’t. Not everything is for everyone.\n\nPrior to the film’s release, the marketing built up a quasi-legend about the film’s verisimilitude enhanced greatly by the mockumentary Curse of the Blair Witch and website (which you can still read) that to less internet savvy audiences muddied the waters. Myrick and Sánchez made the buy in easier. Even the film itself doesn’t ask us too much to begin with. Much like its antecedents such as Ghostwatch, the film spends a good portion of its early runtime establishing lore and normality, with interviews, slices of candid behind the scenes, and black and white clips from the documentary in progress.\n\nOver a short runtime, the film quickly turns up the tension by establishing the friction between our three lead characters. It’s almost expertly done in how character, motivation, relationships and tension is built. Considering the film is largely improvised (in terms of dialogue, not scenes or story shape), it makes it even more remarkable for how well the film actually manages this. Watching it again, there is hardly an ounce of fat on this thing. For a debut, from inexperienced filmmakers and actors, it is surprisingly elegant in its inelegance.\n\nIt plays on primordial fears: being lost, the woods, sounds at night, isolation; even fairy tale fears like witches and stranger danger. That these are common fears wrapped up in the foundations of the film, and the actors reactions sound genuine. Heather’s famous monologue is perhaps the most viscerally scary scene because for those who have bought into the events of the film, we now truly believe that this woman is scared for her life and that she believes she will die. If we’ve bought into the film, then these facets of the film are served in a way that plays as realistically as it possibly can. It builds to a buy in of events for an audience that means the film can succeed. By the the time of the stick figure discovery and literally putting the audience into pitch darkness, the audience will have been whipped up into a frenzy of fear.\n\nMuch has been made of how the film was made. The low budget, the failure to film the intended witch, losing one of your actors after a couple days of filming because they had to go back to work are all features of the film yes. But knowing this I think can harm the buy in. What is presented to you the audience is enough to believe, should you care to, and behind the scenes knowledge is trivia. Even the form the film takes, as found footage, can distance an audience. For some, it adds an extra layer too much to ask of us. The distance forced upon an audience that would normally expect the camera not to be a character but an observer can stretch the believability too far. It breaks. Instead of inviting us in, it pushes them away.\n\nIn writing this, I am clearly on the side of this film is great. The final shot, with Heather’s haunting screams cut short and the reveal of Mike staring into the corner still gives me literal gooseflesh. It may not be the scariest film of all time, but I do think The Blair Witch Project exemplifies what the best of horror can do. It can create a world that plays on our primordial fears, heightens our tensions, and asks us to believe in it, changing cinema forever as a result. Taking the form of found footage means that we as an audience can be pulled in the film and believe what we see as we watch three poor young people descend deeper into the woods to their deaths.\n\nSo long as you buy in, of course.\n\nNotes\n\nAs noted above, The Blair Witch Project spawned two sequels. The first is almost a sequel in name only called Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, and a much better sequel Blair Witch that expanded the lore in interesting ways but didn’t do the business. There is apparently another film in development.\n\nThere are also a couple games and, weirdly, a series of YA novels about Heather’s cousin who investigates the Witch.\n\nHowever, the best thing to come from it is clearly The Scooby Doo Project, which simultaneously is a perfect parody and also still quite scary.\n\nObservations and Connections\n\nPresented here, story by story, is a quick review of each, any connections to the wider Stephen King mythos and more general observations. A basic understanding of the stories is assumed, and spoilers freely discussed.\n\nWilla\n\nThis was the story that got King back to writing short stories, the one that led to almost this whole collection. King admits that it may not be the strongest story to open the collection. It’s not an uncommon type of story for King to have written previously – The Reach from Skeleton Crew is a similar story – but King usually saves them for later in a collection. To open a collection with it is a brave choice, as the first story can define the overall feeling of the collection, But I think it pays off. It’s a sweet, melancholy ghost story that isn’t what you typically think of if you heard the words ‘Stephen King’ and ‘ghost story,’ in the same sentence.\n\nInitially, it reads like a typical King story where a couple end up in a terrible place in the middle of nowhere (examples including Children of the Corn, You Know They’ve Got a Hell of a Band or Rainy Season), but casually subverts those expectations. Our main characters may be dead, but they are together at least. It speaks to the power of love, and how the rest of the world sort of doesn’t matter when you’re with the one you love. I could almost imagine this is King’s ideal afterlife – with Tabitha by his side, at a venue that gets some good bands, plus you get to spook the locals.\n\nThe Gingerbread Girl\n\nThe contemplative mood of the previous story lingers somewhat through to the beginning of this one, though doesn’t stick around for too long. It’s a shorter version of King’s stories similar ‘Women in Trouble’ trilogy, though understandably at a sprint. Around half the story is detailing Emily’s escape from Pickering, but it works neatly as a metaphor for Emily’s emotional arc. Emily’s obsession with running could be interpreted as her not facing or processing the loss of her child. When she is unable to escape from Pickering, it is only when she confronts him that she is able to overcome him. Similarly, the story ends with her beginning to heal from the loss of her child. It’s not a big clever metaphor for grief, but it’s enough for a short story, especially one as thrilling as this.\n\nI have seen some speculation that the Pickering of this story may be a relation to another character with the same surname in Insomnia. I’ve connected characters previously for the same reasons, or even less, but there’s no evidence either way. If you want there to be one, there is. At one point in Gerald’s Game, Jessie Burlingame refers to herself as ‘the amazing Gingerbread Girl,’ which has obvious resonances here.\n\nHarvey’s Dream\n\nA proper creepy one this. Harvey announcing how he woke up screaming from his dream screaming is an absolutely killer line, and begins to peel back several domestic nightmares: a marriage without love, ageing, Alzheimers, children leaving home, gradually building in paranoia until it we can only conclude the worst has indeed happened.\n\nIt’s a slight tale, but in a scant few pages King is able to combine those domestic fears with the same kind of horror he invoked in 1408, where the horror comes down the end of a phone line. But it does show that King is a master at building dread in such a confined space.\n\nRest Stop\n\nAn even slighter story than the previous one that reads as a fantasy where Stephen King gets to play the role of Richard Bachman, appropriate considering the main character’s profession. It asks the difficult question about what we would do in a situation as described in the book, and luckily John Dykstra comes out on top. Not badly written by any means, but probably the weakest of the collection.\n\nThere is a mention of Richard Stark, the actual author. King borrowed the name for his villain back in The Dark Half.\n\nStationary Bike\n\nAn interesting story, partly when seen as part of the long-running continuum of other overweight characters King has written about previously. I discussed this in my Thinner essay, but King had a history of depicting overweight characters as disgusting, lazy slobs. This was most prominent during the 80s, when King saw himself as overweight, so I think this was something of self-loathing thing for King, in much the same way that alcoholics and addicts get short shrift in his books when he was one. But during the 90s and beyond, it proved to be an exception. This story subverted my expectations, especially considering how it starts, as I thought it was King slipping back into bad habits of his depiction of weight. But I was pleasantly surprised to see how the story developed into a warning about excess the other way as well. Exercise becomes just as much an addiction for Richard Sifkitz as junk food was. Instead, this is about finding that happy medium, looking after your health but allowing yourself the occasional indulgence too.\n\nThe crew that works within Sifkitz’s mind is an odd bunch, but also includes Michael Whelan. Michael Whelan is well-known to King fans as the illustrator for many King stories, including The Dark Tower.\n\nThe Things They Left Behind\n\nIn his notes to this story, King briefly discusses the effect 9/11 had on him, as well as the rest of America. As a writer, writing stories is what helps him process what comes after, which helps explain the number of car accidents in his stories after his accident. Yet 9/11 has been curiously absent from his stories, save for a few fleeting references. The most prominent one is from The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah where Black Thirteen is left in a locker in one of the towers, and its inevitable destruction is almost treated as an in-joke.\n\nThis story is wildly different, taking on the survivor’s guilt of those people who happened not to be in the building that day. In the time after 9/11, America went a little mad. You only need to look at the culture that came about in the immediate aftermath to see quite a bit chest-thumping patriotism and dick-swinging to reassure Americans that America was still unassailable. This story ignores the politics of the situation, and King wisely focuses on the individual instead. It shares some similarities in tone with Willa from earlier in the collection. The closest previous effort in terms of subject matter was Hearts in Atlantis, where King wrote about the Vietnam war by writing around it, and in the future there is 11/22/63. I get the feeling that King sees the tragedy inherent to the day, and besides this thoughtful piece has nothing else to add to it.\n\nGraduation Afternoon\n\nLess a story and more a scene from the opening of a movie like Threads or The Day After. It forms a neat counterpoint to The Things Left Behind, being much more visceral in its description of an attack on New York. There’s an element of class King is playing with here too, comparing in particular the music tastes of the characters. It seems if you like country, you’re all right by King. But there’s not much meat to the bone, except in its nightmarish quality. King explains in his notes that story came from going cold turkey from Doxepin and suffered from incredibly vivid dreams as a result. In that sense, it is also the twin to Harvey’s Dream from earlier in the collection. A creepy thrill, a good one, but nothing much beyond that.\n\nN.\n\nOccasionally, King will indulge his horror fanboy whims and write a deliberate homage to classic horror stories. There are many Lovecraft references to be found (Crouch End from Nightmares & Dreamscapes being the most notable, but there are many others), as well as his homage to Stoker in ‘Salem’s Lot and its prequel Jerusalem’s Lot. The telling of the tale as a nested epistolary gets across the feeling of a mind virus, and the general narrative of horrors breaking through into our universe makes this the most outwardly horror (and also scariest) story of the collection so far. The use of a therapist to record the story also recalls The Boogeyman from Night Shift.\n\nThis could have easily been a pastiche story, but King instead uses it as a framework to explore mental health, in this case OCD. OCD can be a crippling illness, where the rituals of the everyday are enough to hold back the end of the world. Even those with OCD know that isn’t true, but that doesn’t stop the rituals. King imagines a horrifying scenario where those rituals are indeed helping save the world, (though the epistolary report throws a little doubt over the proceedings). In addition to scares, it touches upon the importance of mental health and keeping in touch with the world around you. No man is an island and all that.\n\nObviously, numbers have an important role to play in this story, and inevitably 19 makes an appearance. 19 drew importance from the Dark Tower series, though has many appearances throughout King’s work both textual and meta. Stone rings have played important roles in the Tower series too, usually as places of ritual. Maybe the stones present in Ackerman’s Field are keeping a Todash thing in check? This taking place in Maine is located close Harlow (mentioned first in Bag of Bones) and Castle Rock.\n\nThe story is a deliberate riff on Arthur Machen’s The Great God Pan, which is even shouted out within the text. Cthun is more of a general Lovecraft reference however (and probably not a World of Warcraft reference), though also probably related to the word chthonic. Ackerman is probably a reference to Forest J Ackerman, who died a month after publication but was receiving hospice care from around October. King told a story about Ackerman in On Writing, where Ackerman had brought along a story for King to sign. King had submitted the story to Ackerman when he was 11.\n\nTo promote the book, a motion comic was created, adapting this specific story. Special editions of the book were sold with a DVD of all the different episodes, but you can watch it online easily enough these days.\n\nThe Cat From Hell\n\nThe odd story out, in the sense that it is the oldest one here. Nightmares & Dreamscapes had existed as a collection to clear the decks as it were, but this was included here, possibly to bring the collection to a total of thirteen stories. Originally published back in 1977, and had been reprinted numerous times since, including as a bonus story in Duma Key; it had even been adapted for the Tales from the Darkside movie. But King had just forgotten to include it prior. Still – thirteen stories is quite a neat trick.\n\nIt’s a fun, gory tale, told across two different chairs in the most domestic way. Something about the cat forcing its way down Halston’s throats provoke sickened chuckles in me, though the image is equally horrifying too. It reads like an EC Comic, and it would not have been out of place in Creepshow. Finding a home in Tales from the Darkside is quite apropos. There’s little else to it aside from it being a quick little thrill, though more puerile (and more fun) than some of the other thin, more modern stories collected here.\n\nA couple stray observations: Drogan’s sister and her ‘lifelong friend’ Carolyn Broadmoor, though only very minor characters, are almost certainly gay. Though the name Dick Gage is an inherently funny name, that we have a character called Gage who is killed by a cat, forms a rough and ready link with Pet Sematary.\n\nThe New York Times at Special Bargain Rates\n\nAnother on the secret language of marriage and love, similar in some ways to Lisey’s Story with the dead communicating their love from beyond. Though not mentioned, it brings to mind the terrified final calls of those on 9/11 before the planes crashed, which frankly I never actually want to hear. Knowing they exist is depressing enough. The story carries with it that same punch, and has an ending that though I wouldn’t describe as mean, I lack the vocabulary to properly describe.\n\nThe imagery of the the afterlife being like Grand Central Station recalls similar imagery from The Exorcist III.\n\nMute\n\nAlmost a monologue that intercuts between two locations, this is a story that feels like a real throwback to the kind of story that appeared in Night Shift. The religious aspect of playing with guilt adds an interesting dimension to the story. It’s almost a ‘be careful what you wish for,’ except Monette doesn’t express guilt; it’s relief. A good deed is repaid, albeit in a way Monette could never have predicted.\n\nMonette is driving to Derry, the location of many King stories starting with It.\n\nAyana\n\nKing will often have a story, and even often at the or near the end of a collection, that is less horror and more about touching meditations of life and death, especially with family members. It was a tradition started in The Woman in the Room back in Night Shift, and though not bettered this is a similarly touching story about passing on the good to those you can. It forms a neat counterpoint to the previous story, where the ostensibly good character comes out ahead from an evil act compared to here, where good begets good. It tugs at the heartstrings, and reminds us to value the time we have with those we love.\n\nThe character of Ayana, who is able to cure people with a kiss, passes her gift onto the narrator of this story. The power feels reminiscent of John Coffey’s power in The Green Mile, and maybe this is the legacy of his gift, passing on miracles to those who need it. Entirely speculation from me, but why not?\n\nThis story was published in The Paris Review, and can be found online here.\n\nA Very Tight Place\n\nAn odd story to end the collection on, but a darkly hilarious one too. Much like Survivor Type, I can imagine King cackling (with a shit-eating grin too I bet) as he wrote this particular story. It makes for an odd end to the collection, and perhaps would have been better had it swapped with Ayana. By no means a bad story – just odd placement.\n\nAnd that’s it! For a more general overview of the whole collection, click here.\n\nUP NEXT: You must be joking? No, it’s Joe Hill and the short story Throttle!\n\nSun, sand, sea, scares.\n\nWhat I was doing didn’t work just because it played on the nerve endings; it worked because people knew – on some level they really did know – that what they were looking at had come from a place beyond talent. The feeling those Duma pictures conveyed was horror, barely held in check. Horror waiting to happen.\n\nStephen King, Duma Key\n\nOne of the clichés of King’s writing is his Maine setting. Write what you know is true of King, who must have a vast collection of blue chambray shirts, so the occasional story set away from Maine can unsettle a Constant Reader, just from being unable to hear a customary ‘ayuh.’ Even the books set away from Maine, like The Shining, Black House or From a Buick 8 have very Maine climates. Yet, though Maine will always be King’s home, early in the 21st century he had started to make a winter home in Florida. After his accident, he would be even more inclined to the warm winter weather, so in 2001 bought a rather snazzy looking home. Regardless of whether he still owns that property (man’s entitled to some privacy), Florida became a regular fixture in King’s life. Knowing that, Duma Key appears less anomalous.\n\nPrior to starting this project, Duma Key was a story of which I had no knowledge. In the public conversations about King, this is not a story that is ever brought up, possibly because the somewhat radical change in location distances this from what people traditionally would consider to be a King novel. Yet Duma Key tends to be very well regarded by fans. Like a couple of other books I could name, this is one of the underrated gems from King’s bibliography worth seeking out.\n\nFor starters, King feels on familiar ground. Though this is about an artist, with similar abilities as demonstrated by Patrick Danville from The Dark Tower VII, one of the book’s major themes is the power of the creative act. King has touched upon this repeatedly throughout his career, with Bag of Bones and Misery perhaps being the most relevant here (though there are many, many other examples). In the beginning of the book, Edgar is using his new home and artistic hobby as a way to process his very awful accident, and one gets the feeling that King is doing so too. Every book since 1999 has, in some way, been about king processing the trauma of his accident to a greater or lesser degree. This time, he imagines himself as an artist. King admits in an interview he can’t draw a cat, so this is an act of wish fulfilment on his part! Regardless, though the creative endeavour here is not writing, it is still about how art and creation allows us to work through pain.\n\nSimilar to Rose Madder and Insomnia, there is also the return of the mythological references. The villain, known as Perse, is in actuality Persephone in reference to the Goddess of the Underworld and married to Hades. She also has a knack for vegetation, which would go some way to explain the south side of Duma Key’s lush and vicious growth. Gods (or godlike beings) in King’s stories tend to be cruel, and Perse is no different here. She is representative of how the darkness and hate can grow, corrupting those who give into it. This matches with some how she is represented in some myth and literature, where she is called ‘dread Persephone.’ Though there are many sympathetic interpretations of Persephone, it is interesting that King tends towards the darker version – she is, after all, still a God, and God of the Dead to boot. Her power in the book remains so long as you hold onto it.\n\nEdgar isn’t Stephen King, but much of his experiences ring true considering what had happened to King. The early parts of the book were painful to read in a personal sense, as my father-in-law had an accident that left him with similar issues as Edgar experienced. My wife has told me stories of what he was like in the early years after his accident, and it may as well have been the same as King is telling here. The fits of hair-trigger anger, the love for his children, the sheer fucking frustration of being not at what you once were. All the characters in the book, from Elizabeth’s Alzheimers to Wireman’s failed suicide, have been suffering at the hands of time, and in that Edgar is able to find some solace at least. He is not alone.\n\nTake Wireman for example. His winnings at the loteria compelled him to commit suicide, and his failed attempt as the bullet slowly drives its way deeper into his skull haunts him. But to an extent, he has come to terms with it too. In a plot sense, it is clear why Edgar has to remove the bullet, but it works on a thematic level too; Wireman has found a new life on Duma Key, caring for Elizabeth. The pain isn’t gone, but he has learned to live with it as best he can. His grief is there, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be alive and live. The bullet comes for us all, it’s just that Wireman’s is already there, and he has chosen to accept it.\n\nEdgar’s final confrontation with Ilse, his daughter, carries with it similar connotations to Wireman’s story, giving him the chance to being the process of grieving. There is the moment of worry for our lead that he may engage in some Faustian monkey paw shenanigans – that he may indeed submit to the temptations of oblivion offered by Perse. In the beginning of the book, in his darkest moments, that kind of offer may have worked on Edgar. But as Edgar points out, once he had built around himself a community, know that he is loved (much as he saves Tom partway through the book), he finds the will to survive. In some ways, it mirrors the Persephone myth, where once they were caught in an Underworld are released, for a time, into the land of the living. It’s not permanent, but there is hope. There is pain and death too, but that is the price of life.\n\nThis is also represented by those who cannot move on. Like Bag of Bones before, and to a lesser extent The Shining, this is a book filled with regretful ghosts. Though the servant Emery’s attempt to save the twins is laudable under the circumstances, we all know that they are dead. Emery is drowned in the grief and guilt, and threatens to drag others with him too, a sharp contrast to Edgar and Elizabeth who stay afloat in their grief. Elizabeth lived with her grief all her life, and in her final years constantly trying to show others how to cope with her requests to throw the chinas into the pond. The ghosts are rotting remnants (and revenants) of the past, unable to leave for fear they may move on. Yet that is ultimately their only hope of peace with themselves, their guilt and their grief keeping them around. It’s hard to let go, sure, but it’s not living otherwise.\n\nKing has joked in the past that people need a therapist to work out over the course of hours of therapy what he gets to work out on the page and make money doing so. Confronting his own mortality, before he could see his kid’s own successes, must have put him in a mind of his mother. What he laughingly refers to as his Bonus Round is all the truer in reality, because he did indeed nearly die. Edgar confronts that fact every day, has the literal reminder in being an arm shorter than most people around. He’s getting old, relationships are ending, his kids are growing up and finding their own partners in life, and the life he had built for himself dies. But that doesn’t mean it’s the end for Edgar, and Edgar gets a second chance. Stephen King did too. He’s working on it, but with his writing he’s at least finding out what that means for him. In doing so, he has crafted a tense, absorbing, scary and thoughtful book in Duma Key.\n\nObservations and Connections\n\nThe main character is called Edgar Freemantle, sharing a last name with Mother Abigail from The Stand. I’ve speculated elsewhere about the nature of Apocalypse Worlds amongst the King universes, so maybe this is a level of the Tower where there was no Captain Trips. It’s not unlikely they would be related – she outlived three husbands, had six children, thirty-two grandchildren, ninety-one great-grandchildren and a couple of great-great-grandchildren too. We never explicitly learn if Edgar shares a skin colour, but with numbers like that it’s not much of a stretch to put them in the same family tree. Considering Abigail’s shining ability, it may somewhat explain Edgar’s abilities too.\n\nSpeaking of Edgar, he has frequent visions of roses, one of his pieces is called Roses Grow From Shells, and his ex-wife gets a tattoo of a rose on her chest. Roses were a frequent recurring image of the Dark Tower series. Another aspect is the frequency of the number 19 if you aren’t afraid to do some maths, including the flight 559, the number of letters in Ilse Marie Freemantle, a big storm in 1927, room number 847, and Edgar’s email of EFree19. Finally, at one point Edgar refers to himself as a gunslinger, and thinks of life as a circle, a bit like ka. All those connections to the Tower, amongst other allusions, makes one wonder about Big Pink, the house, and Maerlyn’s grapefruit for similarities.\n\nThe villain, Perse, wears a red robe similar to the Crimson King. Edgar’s ability to draw pictures in reality recalls Patrick Danville’s ability from the final Dark Tower book, though both the King and Patrick first appeared in Insomnia. She also shares some similarities with Rose of Rose Madder, another red monster. Perse being able to take over the heron as a sort of scout or emissary recalls the abilities of Tak from Desperation. All of that considered, I wonder if there is a Royal Red family in King’s universe with these three forming a family.\n\nAn odd reference that I only caught from looking at the copyright page at the beginning of the book, but the song Dig by Shark Puppy is credited to songwriters R. Tozier and W. Denborough. Those are the names of two of the Losers from It. The record label is also called Bad Nineteen Music. A similar song reference credit can be found on the copyright page to The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. Both of these suggest a fascinating continuing world after It, especially considering the sporadic Pennywise references in other books alongside similar creatures.\n\nWireman’s powers are minor, but mirror those of Johnny Smith’s from The Dead Zone. Both are induced by serious brain trauma, though Wireman at least gets better.\n\nIn Blaze before this, there was included a short story that King expanded into Duma Key. It’s called Memory, and is more of a character monologue that is essentially the first few chapters of the novel. Not essential, but interesting in how little it hints at what Duma Key would eventually be about.\n\nUP NEXT: We’ll meet Just After Sunset.\n\nMissing Pieces\n\nThe message is simple: you can learn, you can get better, and you can get published.\n\nStephen King, introduction to The Glass Floor\n\nIn Bag of Bones, the main character Mike Noonan is an author who buys himself a little time to deal with his writer’s block by publishing a couple extra books he had locked away in his trunk. Due to King’s prolific output, there are many fans who hope that King similarly has a novel or three stashed away for similar circumstances, or even to come out after his death.\n\nI’m not so sure. I think if King writes it, it goes out, and there’s very little left in the trunk worth publishing. His collection, Nightmares & Dreamscapes was intended as a way for him to clear the decks of older uncollected stories, and besides the occasional gem dug up from his past King has generally kept his novels and collections purely new material.\n\nThere’s a long and interesting Wikipedia article that catalogues many of his unpublished stories. Some stories won’t be published, as they were folded into other books or expanded into novels (e.g. Memory became Duma Key, The Revelations of Becka Paulson was folded into The Tommyknockers as a subplot). Others King eventually revisited and actually published (Blaze was a trunk novel, and Under the Dome started off as a comedy called The Cannibals). The longest unpublished piece looks to be something called Sword in Darkness: King thinks it is unpublishable and won’t release to the public. Much of his papers containing these unpublished works are stored in the University of Maine, but there are some obscure pieces of work that can be found online, if you were to search for the right archive.\n\nBut should you? If you’re a King completionist, then the answer is obvious, but the stories I have read were uncollected generally for good reason: unfinished, juvenilia, or just not very good – sometimes all three at once. Only really The Glass Floor, Squad D, and Before the Play really should see a wider audience, and Before the Play mostly as an entertaining extra. Maybe The Reploids at a stretch (though I admittedly did enjoy the very short stories from his youth).\n\nDo not think the following as a complete list. There may come a time when other stories are released or discovered, so this has a chance to grow in the future. But for the time being, here are the stories I’ve managed to track down.\n\nJhonathan and the Witchs (1956/7)\n\nA summary can be found here. Perhaps King’s earliest story we have record of, just one page of manuscript that tells the story of Jhonathan being granted three wishes which he uses to kill three witches. It is very King in terms of the story and humour, but fairly obviously the work of a child: he would have only been around nine when it was written! From a teacher perspective, it’s a nifty little tale with a sense of humour, but lacks description to really bring it to life.\n\nWas published in First Words: Earliest Writings from Favorite Contemporary Authors, edited by Paul Mandelbaum, but not in any King collection.\n\nPeople, Places and Things (1960)\n\nActually King’s first collection, with one-page stories from him and a friend called Chris Chelsey. He sold them to his friends for $0.10 to $0.25 each. They are absolutely juvenilia, and you can see King’s influences from Bradbury and EC Comics, but for flash fiction these are quite fun. The stories contained were:\n\nA foreword from King (lost).\n\nThe Hotel at the End of the Road – two bad guys find refuge in a hotel, only to become drugged and living exhibits in the hotel. Twist very reminiscent of Roald Dahl’s The Landlady. Summary here.\n\nGenius, Top Forty News, Weather and Sports, and Bloody Child by Chris Chelsey.\n\nI’ve Got to Get Away! – a very Bradbury type story where someone goes mad on an assembly line, only for it be revealed they were a robot the whole time. Good twist though. Summary here.\n\nThe Dimension Warp – listed in the credits, but now lost.\n\nThe Thing at the Bottom of the Well – A horrid child who tortures animals is preyed upon by something in the well. In it brief span, delivers a fun twist in its own nasty way.\n\nReward by Chris Chelsey\n\nThe Stranger – A man did a bad thing, and the devil claims him in a whiff of brimstone. To call it slight suggests the others are more weighty, but by comparison it is very slight.\n\nA Most Unusual Thing, Gone, They’ve Come by Chris Chelsey\n\nI’m Falling – listed, but now lost.\n\nThe Cursed Expedition – Astronauts land on Venus, only for it to devour them one at a time. Big idea, executed as well as could be done so for his age.\n\nThe Other Side of the Fog – A young kid gets lost in the fog that deposits him in different times. Lacks an ending really, but would be an effective camp fire story.\n\nScared and Curiosity Kills the Cat by Chris Chelsey\n\nNever Look Behind You by Chris Chelsey and Stephen King. King’s first collaboration, which has a a nasty man die in a nasty way for no readily apparent reason.\n\nThere is something to be said for these as mildly fun snack-size stories. I’d rather see these published than some of the other stories below.\n\nIn a Half-World of Terror (1965)\n\nA summary can be found here. King’s first published story at the age of 17, albeit unpaid, originally titled I was a Teenage Grave Robber. Though the other stories so far have shown a grim flair, they were absolutely imitations of what King was reading at the time. This is the first story where there are flashes of the writer King would become. Not often, but you get a sense of King’s burgeoning style. It is however, deathly dull.\n\nThe Glass Floor (1967)\n\nA summary can be found here. King’s first published story for which he was paid the handsome sum of $35. It was published in Startling Mystery Stories, but was published in a couple places afterwards, with minor alterations, in 1990’s Weird Tales (the version I read), Cemetery Dance in 2012 and Best of Cemetery Dance 2 in 2020.\n\nIt’s a bit raw, but this is the first story that feels like a King story in terms of style. The story is a bit derivative, but not badly told either and the ending has the power to be genuinely chilling.\n\nSlade (1970)\n\nA summary can be found here. An interesting example of King’s early writing in that the titular Slade seems like an early prototype of Roland’s gunslinger. Yet despite this, it almost reads as a parody of Western stories, with everyone’s speech dropping letters like there was a sale at the apostrophe store. Somehow, this feels more juvenile than The Glass Floor before it, and the comedy of the piece doesn’t really land. Stick with Roland.\n\nThe Blue Air Compressor (1971, revised 1981)\n\nA summary can be found here. Another silly story from King, this time indulging in the fat shaming that appeared fairly often in the early third of his writing. In fact, this goes further than even something like Thinner in its description of an overweight character, though in typical EC Comics style the main character is hardly likeable either.\n\nSquad D (late 1970s)\n\nA summary can be found here. A very interesting one, and impossible to date. It was published in an anthology by Cemetery Dance in 2019, but was originally intended for Harlan Ellison’s legendary anthology The Last Dangerous Visions. It is legendary, in that work began on the anthology in 1973 and Harlan never completed work upon it. It is apparently set to be published later this year.\n\nThere’s a melancholy air to the story, and early attempt from King to deal with the legacy of Vietnam, which he does more fully in Hearts in Atlantis. Ellison reportedly thought the story wasn’t quite ready, but I think it’s more a case of it doesn’t feel in tune with what you may expect from King, more similar in tone to something like The Last Rung on the Ladder or The Woman in the Room, though with a slight touch of the supernatural about it.\n\nBefore the Play and After the Play (1977)\n\nThis is a prologue to The Shining, giving snapshot views into the history of the Overlook. Though published a couple of times, including in a special edition of The Shining from Cemetery Dance, this has never been formally collected nor easy to track down. It is entertaining to read, but was wisely deleted I think from the novel proper. It just gives away too much too early about the Overlook. However, it’s a fun addition in the same way Jerusalem’s Lot and One for the Road are companions to ‘Salem’s Lot, and worth tracking down should you want more after the fun of The Shining.\n\nThe epilogue takes on the same form as Carrie, in that it is almost a collage of different news stories subsequent to the Overlook burning down. I hadn’t been able to track it down for a long while, until this Reddit post came out of the blue. Reading it fills a couple gaps for characters, especially in light of Doctor Sleep, but is superfluous when compared to the ending/epilogue the book currently has.\n\nThe King Family & The Wicked Witch (1977)\n\nWritten to entertain the King family children (then just Naomi and Joe, though Owen was on the way), it tells the story of how Witch Hazel turns Stephen’s nose into a banana, Tabitha’s hands in milk bottles, and Naomi and Joe to cry endlessly. They are cured by a Prince, and then they send the witch farting to the moon. A bit of harmless fluff, only really meant as a bit of fun for the family.\n\nThe Night of the Tiger (1978)\n\nA summary can be found here. Originally written in the 1960s, but revised publication for publication in 1978. The story itself betrays its earlier written origins, and it feels very Ray Bradbury with a King polish.\n\nMan with a Belly (1978)\n\nA summary can be found here. Published in Cavalier, and you can tell. Feels like a Bachman story, in that it’s rather nasty, lurid and frankly gross. It’s a bunch of nonsense, and I don’t blame King for leaving this one out of any party.\n\nThe Crate (1979)\n\nA summary can be found here. This story was adapted for Creepshow, and remains fairly unchanged in its transition to the screen. This may explain why it hasn’t been collected. However, this feels like King proper, and if you hadn’t seen Creepshow but somehow tracked this down instead, this would do more than fill in that gap. The first one, besides the childish early stories, that I genuinely enjoyed.\n\nSkybar (1982)\n\nA summary can be found here. A contest to promote the book called Do It Yourself Bookseller, where various authors provided a beginning and an end with someone adding a middle. Brian Hertz, aged 18, won the contest. Because it is essentially half a story, I can see why it has never been published properly, but the elements in play have some real horror to them. I’d almost like to see King’s version of the complete story for comparison.\n\nThe Leprechaun (1983)\n\nKing wrote this in the same way he wrote Eyes of the Dragon for Naomi, only this never got finished (and, obviously, remains unpublished). He wrote 30 pages, but it was lost off the back of a motorcycle and though King said he could reconstruct the lost work, all that remains are these few pages. It tells the story of a young Owen playing in the garden, and finding his cat playing with a tiny man. The pages that exist are fun, and it’s a shame there’s nothing more of it. Unlike The Plant, which is also unfinished, it does not end in a way that in itself is satisfying. Very much a curio.\n\nKeyholes (1984)\n\nNothing more than a fragment to a story, that within the brief amount of words we have make no sense as to its possible next steps. In it, a concerned father talks to a psychiatrist about his son. Could be a fun writing game: here is the beginning of a King story – go finish it!\n\nFor the Birds (1986)\n\nA summary can be found here. It would be generous to call this flash fiction, more of a good joke.\n\nThe Reploids (1988)\n\nA summary can be found here. Weirdly, a story directly referenced by a main King book, namely The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla, but remains otherwise uncollected. It’s not bad, but like the last couple entries feels unfinished, as if there were greater plans for the titular reploids. As it is, it feels unsatisfactory, and only really for the hardcore Tower completionist.\n\nAn Evening at God’s\n\nA one minute play wherein a drunken God prematurely destroys the Earth for getting in the way of the TV, only to realise Alan Alda came from there. I could imagine this as a fun extra in a collection, but absolutely not essential.\n\nAnd that’s all the ones I could find! If you know the location of another missing story, don’t be a stranger and let me know!\n\nI am the Gerard baby! Wah, wah, goo-goo!\n\nJoe slept by the stove. His hand had fallen out of his mouth, but the fingers still bore the marks of his frantic chewing. It was a painful world, too. Not just dirty but painful. Teething was only the first and least of it.\n\nStephen King (writing as Richard Bachman), Blaze\n\nThough King draws links between Blaze and Of Mice and Men, the provenance is similar to books like And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks or Go Set A Watchman. The former, a book co-written way Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, was published long after both authors were dead; the latter was published just within the author’s lifetime, though possibly under duress. Both were books that for the longest time were not intended to be published, and beyond literary or fan interest probably weren’t worth that much bother. Blaze was written way back, pre-Carrie, and King kept in a trunk until after The Colorado Kid. He dusted it off, thinking it might fit the Hard Case Crime imprint, but decided after a modern revision it didn’t really fit and instead released it under his old pseudonym, Richard Bachman.\n\nOne gets the feeling that King is somewhat vaguely embarrassed by the novel though. He is quick to point in his introduction that maybe the reader should consider the book a piece juvenilia, and though there is undoubtedly the hand of a master writer pruning and shaping the book, the weaknesses of the book are still evident. Carrie still remains a blisteringly powerful first novel when compared to the two-hander novel presented here. This is quieter, more melancholy, more inevitable, and the obvious allusions to Of Mice and Men (there’s a big, dumb guy and a smart guy called George looking out for each other – even with George dead, it’s a mere step to recognise the allusions) make the book what it is.\n\nThough the character relationships are directly inspired by Steinbeck, the story seems to be King’s version of the famous Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, even down to the ladder detail. The actual story of the Lindbergh baby is fascinating story, and worth your time reading about. It doesn’t have a big dumb guy to poke at your feelings, but it has some amazing police work involving the ladder.\n\nBut it is obviously Steinbeck to which the book is most indebted to. Blaze is essentially Lenny from Of Mice and Men, only this time there’s a modicum more hope, despite what happens in the end. Without going on too much on Of Mice and Men, that book’s ending fits with the general ennui of the period in which it is set. Steinbeck as a writer wrote about the world around him, and the Great Depression creates a backdrop of hardship for the characters to impossibly rail against. What villain there is is circumstantial, in that circumstances of the world are stacked against the characters. King is not so interested in that (for that, look to something like Roadwork instead), and though there is a similar set of circumstances that stand against Blaze, King is interested in exploring the character of Blaze than the circumstances.\n\nAs such, where Of Mice and Men is interested the failure of redemption in the face of insurmountable odds for everyone, Blaze is interested in the possibility of redemption in the face of everything against them. Blaze is the product of a world that hits out, is indifferent to heart and soul, and though Blaze enjoys a life of crime, he is not made cruel by it. Blaze has a firm sense of right and wrong created from his big heart, but the world ultimately doesn’t care that Blaze does. He makes wrong decisions, because that’s all he knows to do. But because of his capacity to love, there is maybe a chance…?\n\nBut no. Blaze has never been given a chance in life. He is a victim of circumstances beyond his control and every assumption based on his size and appearances instead of who he is. He was never going to succeed, and his desperate plans to raise Joe Gerard as his own were just an elaborate fantasy and only ever the imaginings of a doomed man. Blaze’s emotional core makes it a bit unlike other Bachman books, but the world is still cold, indifferent and cynical like the other books.\n\nThe relationship with George is interesting, as that is the element that really brings in the Bachman feel. George, being dead, gives voice to Blaze’s inner insecurities. There is a question to how exactly George manifests to Blaze (there are some ideas mentioned below), but it’s never really explored in detail. There is at one point an indication that Blaze is voicing George, and George only ever really appears when Blaze is alone. But that’s not the interesting part. George brings along with him the edge of harsh cynicism that usually characterises a Bachman book. The power of book lies within Blaze’s ability to resist it for so long. But as we are in a Bachman book, it cannot resist the inexorable pull of oblivion.\n\nIt could be seen as a more emotional set of stakes when compared to Steinbeck, but King doesn’t pull off the same level of loss that is felt in Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck’s prose and character work all continually serve his themes of interest, and build to their inevitable climax. Everyone from George and Lenny to Curley’s Wife are downtrodden and beaten simply for being alive in hard times. Blaze futzes about a bit more in terms of developing a character background for Blaze, working that much harder to convince of its emotional core. But we only ever get a vague sense of Blaze – even George only exists to serve our understanding of Blaze, rather than stand as his own character. The simplicity of Steinbeck’s novel gives it the edge, and Blaze will remain a lucky trunk novel. It’s not bad, but it set itself some pretty impossible competition.\n\nThe Bachman books are an interesting side project from King, allowing for a different voice to speak. They tend to a more cynical or pessimistic edge, but even in the trunk novels there is a general inclination towards hope. Blaze in particular is interesting, especially at this point in the Stephen King Reading List, to see how far King has come but also to see what has always been there. There is the heart, the depth of character, there is love, and there is hope. But even in the last Bachman book, though there is at least an indication that hope can exist, it is snuffed out in the end.\n\nObservations and Connections\n\nDespite being a Bachman book and a trunk novel, there are number of references, possible or explicit, made here all of which were undoubtedly added by King in his revisions. There is a scattering of references to Shawshank prison, introduced in Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. We’re also in Castle County, the area being introduced back in The Dead Zone. This time round, a new sheriff – John D. Kellahar, maybe the sheriff before Bannerman took over. Gerald Clutterbuck owns Blaze’s old school, who may be a relation to Andy Clutterbuck. Martin Coslaw, the headmaster, may be related to Marty Coslaw from Cycle of the Werewolf. There’s even another Merrill to add to the family tree, an Arlene, alongside Ace from The Body and Needful Things and Pop from The Sun Dog.\n\nThere is room for speculation on how George exactly manifests to Blaze. Is he a ghost? An echo? Communicating beyond the grave to a guy with some special ability? Dissociative Identity Disorder? Guardian angel? Who knows? There’s a moment when Blaze’s narration, about to use a payphone but worried about lacking in change, says ‘bool,’ which was used extensively in Lisey’s Story – could that be a hint at something larger?\n\nPrior to Blaze’s childhood trip to Boston (aged 14), he sees a vampire film called The Second Coming featuring a villain called Count Igor Yorga. Though King tried to keep the date this book is set vague, Count Yorga, Vampire and The Return of Count Yorga were released in 1970 and 71 respectively, which can help approximate a date setting. However, neither film had a secondary title of The Second Coming, and I can’t find another vampire film of that title. I wonder if instead this is a fun reference to ‘Salem’s Lot, which was called The Second Coming until cooler heads prevailed, similar to how Stephen King is a writer referenced in a few other Bachman books.\n\nIn his introduction, King mentions two other novels that are ‘lost.’ These are Under the Dome (lost around after 50 pages were completed) and The Cannibals (lost after 200 completed pages). Maybe the publication of Blaze started an itch in his brain, as King would revisit and rewrite both as Under the Dome in 2009. However, there are others. There is a long and fascinating article on Wikipedia of unpublished or uncollected works by King, though admittedly not many sound interesting enough to warrant publishing except as curios. Considering King thought of Nightmares & Dreamscapes as his clearing-the-decks collection of short stories, it seems unlikely the few, pre-1994 uncollected stories will see publication during his lifetime, with probable exception of The Shining pro- and epilogue in a special edition.\n\nUP NEXT: Time for a summer break to Duma Key.\n\nI shall go to the bool!\n\nHow lucky for your love to outrace your time?\n\nStephen King, Lisey’s Story\n\nIn my last essay, I recalled how Cell was the first current King book I read, in that I had read some of his older books but that Cell was my first book read as it came out. Lisey’s Story has the ignoble reputation for ending my first big foray into reading King for a long time. I read around 50 pages, didn’t get it, and dropped it. Though the reputation of The Tommyknockers or Dreamcatcher were bad, this book was perhaps the one I feared the most on this journey through the backlog, it having previously muted my interest in King for a number of years.\n\nLooking back, I was both right and wrong. I think reading this book over seventeen years ago, with me as a teenager, was the wrong time to even attempt it. Where Cell was full of piss and vinegar, this is a far more mature book that wouldn’t appeal to a teenager. Coming back to it now, I have a much greater appreciation for what King is trying to do though I will admit that it is absolutely not a book for everyone. If you are here for monsters and violence, you can find it here, buried amongst the character development and rumination on relationships.\n\nThe story follows Lisey as she comes to term with her long grief over the death of her husband two years prior. The inspiration for the story is well-known; King came back from a stay in hospital after contracting double pneumonia to find Tabitha was in the midst of redesigning his studio. Seeing his belongings packed in boxes, he suddenly had a vision of his home after his death, much like Lisey is at the beginning of the book. Much of Lisey’s character found inspiration not only in Tabitha, but in her sisters too.\n\nBut do not let this allow one to believe this is based on King’s life explicitly. Though the source comes from his experience (and there are some parallels between Scott and Stephen, noted below), I think it is more likely that King was careful to be inspired by but not take from his own life in this regard. Sometimes, reading a King book gives a very clear picture as to his own life at the time: The Shining, Pet Sematary, or Misery for example. But those I think are cases where books fell out of King’s subconscious, whereas I think King here is much more interested in taking his life as a jumping off point to talk through some themes in his most intense and interesting character study since Dolores Claiborne.\n\nThat being said, it can be hard to divorce that separation of book and author here, as one of the book’s major strengths is how intimate it feels. King has never been one to shy away from personal details, and reading this book you get a real sense of how deeply and truly he loves Tabitha. But I don’t think Scott and Lisey’s relationship is Stephen and Tabby’s – rather, King is writing from a place of experience, the private language of a married couple who have been together for decades and still love each other madly. That’s not something teenage me would necessarily get – but married me is far more on board with.\n\nI understand for some readers, this may be a turn off. Smucking, bool, SOWISA are the main culprits, but the book is littered with words or turns of phrase from their private language. For others, it instead invites the reader in to a very personal story about grief and moving on, madness, trauma, love and what happens when those we love go away. The characters in the book work through a lot of their trauma on the page, and I wonder how much of this book is King coming to terms with his own eventual death and legacy. These are themes he’s been musing on for years – it is very easy to draw links between this and previous books: Misery, Bag of Bones, Rose Madder, Dolores Claiborne, Roadwork are ones that spring to mind immediately. In many ways, the book feels like summation of those ideas, and it feels churlish to go through the themes of the book because of the finality it has about it. Of course, King has written roughly twenty-five books since this one, but I can see why he expresses and retains such a fondness for it.\n\nI’ve expressed a couple times throughout my reading that King’s ultimate belief, the one he is almost always writing about in his novels, is about the power of love. Lisey is the focus of that love for Scott (much as Tabitha is for King), and she has a deep well of love for those around her, especially Amanda. It’s her love that saves Amanda and Scott, but also constrains her for two years in grief, similar to how Scott’s love for his father and brother imprisons him. Jim Dooley and Professor Woodbody have a obsession with Scott Landon the Author, neglecting to take into account the real man who existed too. They don’t get the invite to what’s really going on.\n\nThe other aspect I think merits some discussion is the importance of language. Every review or discussion of the book discusses the private language of marriage that exists in the book, and King is always fascinated by the craft of language. After all, it’s what gave him the impetus to write On Writing. But here, as well as love, there is the power of words. The pool Lisey, Scott and Amanda go to give them language, language to continue their stories. Telling stories is what saves Scott in many ways so he can cope, process and function with his trauma. It’s his final gift to Lisey. And King would be acutely aware of how language brought him back from the brink after his accident.\n\nI understand why some readers have difficulty or problems with the book – I was one of them until I finished it – but at the same time this isn’t my favourite King book. I am glad to have read it, crossing another adolescent DNF off the list, but there’s an element to which maybe this was a private book for King and Tabitha to have together.\n\nIt must have been a relief to know she liked it, though apparently, not ‘real crazy‘ about it either.\n\nObservations and Connections\n\nThis book is set in Castle County, and as such we get a lot of references to the localities we’ve come to know over King’s bibliography, both obscure to well-known. On the one side, we have Castle Rock and Derry, which need no real introduction; on the other side, we have Cleave’s Mill (The Dead Zone, amongst others) and Dark Score Lake (Gerald’s Game and Bag of Bones). There is also mention of Shooter’s Knob, hometown of Jim Dooley; the location gave the name Shooter to the antagonist of Secret Window, Secret Garden.\n\nIn terms of characters, Darla has a Mike Noonan book on tape, Noonan being the author of choice from Bag of Bones. Norris Ridgewick, former deputy and now sheriff of Castle County, also makes an appearance alongside Andy Clutterbuck, who appeared in the early 90s Castle Rock books The Dark Half and Needful Things, amongst a couple others. Ridgewick has gotten married too!\n\nLisey has the term Deep Space Cowboy, which sounds a bit like the Space Cowboy from Gerald’s Game which was itself a reference to a song. It matches, in that it refers to that deep kind of crazy.\n\nThere’s some Dark Tower references too. At one point, Lisey refers to her flashbacks to Scott ‘as if on some level of time’s great tower, everything was still happening.’ This suggests Scott may have been King’s twinner, which I’ll get to below. Scott and Lisey were married on the 19th September 1979. When Lisey is overcome with grief and describes how Scott really is dead, she describes him as lit out for the Territories, which were introduced in The Talisman. Lisey’s car is also a BMW - a beamer, if you will, which Roland himself drew attention to in one of the books.\n\nThe Boo’ya Moon is probably unique to this book alone, and only appears here, but the moon has been an important symbol in other books, notably Gerald’s Game and Dolores Claiborne‘s eclipse, and Rose Madder‘s All-World painting. The moon is a symbol of femininity, and though the aforementioned books are often described as a loose trilogy, Lisey’s Story makes a fine addition to make a tetralogy if so inclined.\n"
