        "text": "Vol. XXIX No. 6 September, 2012\n\nHomage To Padmabhushan Avtar Krishna Hangal\n\nPadmabhushan Avtar Krishna Hangal, born in Sialkot (now in Pakistan) on 1-2-1917 in a Pandit family (but father working as a tailor), started acting on stage since his childhood, became a freedom-fighter, underwent prison for 3 years in Karachi, shifted to Bombay in 1949 and joined the IPTA. He entered the world of Cinema as a character-actor in Teesri Kasam (1966 by Basu Bhattacharya), and became a favourite of the film fans by portraying varied roles in about 225 films until 2008, whereafter he developed poor health and even confined to wheel-chairs (he paraded on a ramp in a wheel-chair in a Fashion show in February 2011) till he expired in a Mumbai hospital in the early morning of 26th August 2012, aged 95. He is best remembered for his memorable roles in Teesri Kasam (1966), Saat Hindustani (1969), Sara Akash (1969), Anubhav (1971), Guddi (1971), Bawarchi (1972), Parichay (1972), Abhiman (1973), Garam Hawa (1973), Aandhi (1975), Deewar (1975), Sholay (1975), Balika Badhu (1976), Chitchor (1976), Shaukeen (1982) and Lagaan (2001). He was known for perfection in portrayal of characters, also in the three negative roles he played in Bombai Raat Ki Bahon Mein (1967), Manzil (1979) and Shaukeen (1982). He had also visited Patna in 1994 and 2006 as a theatre activist. We have prayed for his soul, and propose to screen some of his films (of different types) in the near future as a tribute to the veteran artist.\n\nSCREENING OF TOP AWARD WINNERS FROM WORLD CINEMA\n\n(Venue : Premises of Dr Dilip Sen, Buddha Marg, Patna)\n\nCoordinator: U P Singh (9334160050)\n\n17 September (Monday) at 6:30 p m\n\nThe Artist (2011, French with EST, black & white, 100 minutes) written & directed by Michel Hazanavieius, *Jean Dujardin (as Peppy Miller), BereniceBejo (as George Valantine) & others.

Active as a theatre artist in his school days, he joined the All India Talents Contest in 1966, and merited a selection for lead roles in feature films, debuting in Raaz (1967) followed by Aakhri Khat (released earlier in 1966, a much acclaimed film by Chetan Anand, then considered for an entry for the Academy Awards). Ultimately he acted in 163 features, 17 short films and a few TV serials till 2010 (in Do Dilon Ke Khel Mein, in a supporting role, his last film before his death on 18th July). He had also produced a few films, and participated in politics during a few years (was an MP in the Lok Sabha during 1991 to 1996). He received five Filmfare awards, including a special award in 1991 for having acted in lead roles in 101 films, and also a Life-time Achievement Award in 2005. He reigned the world of Hindi cinema during 1969 to 1973, when each of his 15 films became block-busters, super-hit or hit, and was declared as the first Super-Star of Indian Cinema. He was also so honoured by The BBC by making and releasing a documentary film on him in 1974. Although he is remembered more for his romantic films (Aradhana, 69; Safar,70; Kati Patang,71; Amar Prem,72; Roti,74; Mehbooba,76; Souten,83), critics and connoisseurs of cinema applaud him for his many off-beat roles (Anand, 1971, his best; Avishkar, 73, first of the triology of Basu Bhattacharya; Ittefaq, 69, perhaps his only suspense film). We propose to screen three of his films (of different types) this month as a tribute to Kaka.\n\nRETROSPECTIVE OF SELECTED FILMS OF RAJESH KHANNA\n\n(Venue : premises of Dr Dilip Sen, in Buddha Marg, Patna)\n\n12 August (Sunday)at 6.00 PM : Anand (1970, by Hrishikesh Mukherjee) *Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Sumitra Sanyal, Ramesh Deo, Seema, Lalita Pawar, Johny Walker, Dara Singh, Asit Sen and others; Music by Salil Choudhury.\n\n13 August (Monday) at 6.30 PM : Bawarchi (1972, by Hrishikesh Mukherjee) *Rajesh Khanna, Jaya Bhaduri, Durga Khote, Usha Kiran, Manisha, Harendranath Chattopadhyaya, A K Hangal, Asrani, Paintal, Suraj, Kali Banerjee and others; Music by Madan Mohan.\n\n14 August (Tuesday) at 6.30 PM : Ittefaq (1969, by Yash Chopra) *Rajesh Khanna, Nanda, Sujit Kumar, Bindu, Jagirdar, Madan Puri, Iftekhar, Shammi, Jagdish Raj, Alka and others; Music by Salil Choudhury.\n\nAGHAAZ MINI FILM FESTIVAL\n\nThe second Aghaaz Mini Film Festival was organized at Patna on 7th and 8th July by Aman Trust, New Delhi in collaboration with Samar and Lok Panch Patna, thanks to the efforts of Mr Istiaq Ahmed and his few colleagues.

Yet Bhojpuri Cinema had its origin elsewhere, although the first Bhojpuri feature was made in Bihar. The first feature film made in Bihar and Jharkhand (Punarmilan,1931,Directed by then top Director Dhiren Ganguli,produced by Maharaja Bhupendra Narayan Singh of Deo) was not a Bhojpuri Film. It was the Filmistan studio at Goregaon, Mumbai that introduced a Bhojpuri song in one of its films in 1946.Bhojpuri dialogues and songs were inserted off and on in Hindi films, such as Nadiya ke Paar (1948,Kishore Sahu),Ganga Jamuna (1961,Nitin Bose), Teesri Kasam (1966, Basu Bhattacharya), Nadiya ke Paar (1982, Govind Moonis, Rajasree Productions) etc. Shakti Samanta also produced and directed a Bhojpuri film (Ayeel Basant Bahar,1966).\n\nThe first ever Bhojpuri film, Ganga Maiya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo (produced by Vishwanath Prasad Shahabadi of Bihar, directed by Kundan Kumar of Varanasi, with lyrics by Shailendra, music by Chitragupta, starring Asim Kumar, Kumkum, Nasir Hussain, Padma Khanna, Ramayan Tiwari etc, premiered in Prakash Talkies in Varanasi in 1962) was a great family drama with its spectacular panorama of the Chhat festival (the most important family festival of the region) on the banks of river Ganges, caused an euphoria amongst the film lovers of Bihar and Eastern UP, and prompted announcements for production of about 70 Bhojpuri films immediately, most of which did not materialise. Only two to seven films were released annually, totalling only 17 during the next 8 years ie, till 1970.The next decade was the worst : only 9 produced during 1971-80.From 1981 onwards the productions increased gradually, and a total of 135 films had been produced from 1962 till 1993,which included many good, popular and hit films adhering to the Bhojpuri culture (Bidesia, 1963,by S N Tripathi, re-creating the art of Bhikhari Thakur); Lage Nahin Chute Ram (1964), Loha Singh (1966, the legendary folk comedian created by Prof. Rameswar Singh Kashyap) and Bhouji (1965,all by Kundan Kumar); Hamar Sansar (1965,by Naseem); Dangal (1977,by Rati Kumar, produced by Ashok Jain); Balam Paradesiya (1979 )and Rus Gailo Saiyan Hamar (both by Nasir Hussain); Dharti Maiya (1981,by Kumar Naqvi), Ganga Kinare Mere Gaon (1983,by Dilip Bose); Hamar Bhouji (1984, by Kalpataru); Bihari Babu (1985, by Dilip Bose, produced by Satrughan Sinha); Dagabaaz Balma (1988,by Arati Bhattacharya, so far the only female Bhojpuri Director, herself a Bengali actress, married to a top Bhojpuri Actor Kunal). Till then Bhojpuri cinema had been continuing with the Bhojpuri traditions, and with its melodramatic family dramas depicting day to day happenings in the countryside, was a favourite of rural and semi-urban housewives, and of the daily wage earners. Since 1990s,Bhojpuri cinema entered its golden age, producing more and more films, investing crores as against lakhs with primary aim to mint money, departing from the Bhojpuri traditions and culture, aping Bollywood and its ever-increasing permissiveness, with daring body exposures, provocative lyrics and dances, double meaning dialogues, but neglecting the basic qualities of good cinema, eg, storyline, script, screenplay, structure, presentation, and above all, technical excellence, using ribaldry as the trump card for box office success. Even Udit Narayan produced a film(Kab Hoega Gawna Hamar, 2005) with dances in Punjabi style during a marriage function, contrary to the Bhojpuri tradition. Sasura Bada Paisawala (2004,by Ajay Sinha) became a super hit only for its four ribald items, which, if removed, would make the film a super-flop, leaving only a hackneyed storyline, of boy meeting girl, falling in love, deciding to marry against oppositions, fightings and reconciliation. But the formula did not last long. Ego Chhumma De De Rajaji, with both the current top stars, Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishan, flopped in the box office in spite of its saucy title and contents. Jade Mein Balma Pyara Lage (2008, produced,written and directed by Mukesh Kumar) had a lukewarm release in spite of its all seven ribald song items, and an expensive and impressive 12 page brochure indicating a better than Bollywood style. According to a reputed trade Magazine, during the last 5 years,2004 to 2008,as many as 20,65,115,72 and 42 were released respectively, out of which only 10,10,12,7 and 5 succeeded; the success rate nose-dived from 50%(average) to 20%(border-line between disasters and flops).\n\nCharacterised by low budget, devoid of top star-casts, poor in technical quality, lacking diversification of themes, with hackneyed storylines concentrating mostly on rural family dramas, unable to compete with their Hindi mainstream counterparts, running in sub-standard cinema theatres in rural and semi-urban localities, catering to not-so-affluent patrons discouraged by poor law and order, and women viewers shying out from the embarrassing contents of the films, with low priced tickets delivering meagre returns for the distributors and the producers as against disproportionately exorbitant rates being charged by its lead actors, it has not been able to attract either laurels in the National level, nor the big-budget producers nor the innovative and sensitive film makers who have sky-rocketed the standards of Indian cinema.\n\nBhojpuri film makers, mostly small time producers, giving up after a single flop, unaware of the niceties of good cinema and having no knowledge of marketing strategies and realities, many of them tempted to be a part of the glamorous world of filmdom, feel elated on hearing rumours that Sasura earned 15 crores with a meagre investment of only 30 lakhs, and dare to spend 3 to 4 crores, when the maximum potential of the Bhojpuri film market is hardly of one to one-and-a-half crore, spread over the non-remunerative Bhojpuri belt described above. These producers lap up informations that giant production houses of Bollywood such as Rajasree have entered the fray, that Columbia-Tristar of Hollywood is considering to dub its films in Bhojpuri to catch the Bhojpuri belt, Namak Halal is being dubbed in Bhojpuri, Mumbai single screens and even multiplexes are being flooded with Bhojpuri films, and that Bhojpuri Film-songs are ruling the streets.They get excited that Bollywood stars such as Amitabh Bachhan, Hema Malini, Mithun Chakravorty, Ajay Devgan, Jackie Shroff, Raj Babbar, Arun Govil, Rati Agnihotri, Hrishita Bhatt etc have started acting in Bhojpuri films, celebrities such as Subhas Ghai, Nitin Manmohan, Tinu Varma, Saroj Khan have associated themselves, and even a foreign model has acted as a Bhojpuri star (Tanya, from Ukraine, in Firangee Dulhaniya, 2005, by Ranjan Kumar Singh), and another has agreed to do so (Jessica, a British actress).They are often persuaded by touts to ignore the facts that no big name from Bihar has chosen to promote Bhojpuri Cinema(except the lone instance of Bihari Babu),and involvement of Bollywood biggies with Bhojpuri films have been negligible, or only in the contemplation stage. The Bollywood giants are too shrewd to jump into the non-viable Bhojpuri arena with its poor track record. Most of the Bhojpuri producers might not be aware that by end of 2008,as many as 144 completed Bhojpuri films were languishing in their cans, waiting to be released, with no takers, and 80% of the released films are unable to recover their investments.\n\nIt is quite natural to blame Bihar, a state with no industry, hence with no big money and no big producer, without basic infrastructure, with no facility for film making, old cinema theatres closing down, no new cinema hall coming up,poor purchasing power of film goers pushing down cost of tickets to the minimal, and cinematic talents migrating to Bollywood. It is easy to blame the Government, without appreciating that why should the Government spend big money in an entertainment industry when it is unable to mobilise funds for basic facilities for its people, specially when there is no dearth of alternate cinema available everywhere ?\n\nBhojpuri cinema, no doubt, has produced many memorable films in the past,and is also producing such films at present, although much fewer. Both the topmost scholars in Bihar on cinema, Prof. Dr N N Pandey (himself a sensitive actor in Bhojpuri films, having impressive credentials with a Doctorate degree on cinema) and Shri Vinod Anupam (Ace critic and journalist on cinema, a National Award winner on writings on cinema) fondly recall the memorable films mentioned above for which Bhojpuri cinema have been proud of. Both agree that there has been no film so far that can be considered better than Ganga Maiya, But they also commend a few recent films such as Bidai (2008, by Aslam Shaikh, a poignant film on the dowry system).While Pandey also commends Mitwa (1969,Govind Moonis), Vinod also recommends recent films such as Kab Aibu Anganwa Hamar (2007, by Sanjay Tripathi, a film infusing hope amongst the desperate youth) and Hum Bahubali (2008, by Anil Ajitabh, produced by Mahindra and Mahindra, a rare film with technical excellence, although with not-so-good contents).\n\nFortunately Bhojpuri cinema has no dearth of talents, but such talents need to be explored and utilised by expert and sensitive Directors, only if the producers so wish. Nasir Hussain, Kanhaiya Lal, Sujit Kumar, Kunal Singh, Kumkum, Padma Khanna, Prema Narayan, Rajni Sharma, Gauri Khurana, Seema Vaz, Bandini Mishra etc have been legends. The present day actors, Manoj Tiwari Mridul, Ravi Kishen, Rakesh Pandey, Dinesh Yadav, Sweta Tiwari, Rani Chatterjee (Sabiha Sheikh re-named), Pakshi Hegde, Rinku Ghosh, Urmila Rao, Mona Lisa, Nagma etc have no less potential. Producers and Directors such as Ashok Jain, Mohanjee Prasad, Kundan Kumar ,S N Tripathi, Govind Moonees, Aslam Shaikh, Dilip Bose etc are no less competent. But they need a change of orientation, backed by elite financiers and distributers committed to better cinema rather than the box-office.\n\nThe success story of a few recent releases is certainly encouraging. A satellite channel dedicated to Bhojpuri language, long awaited, has since emerged (Mahua) and is gaining popularity, ushering good days for Bhojpuri cinema. We are eagerly waiting for the day when some enlightened producer will come forward to invest in a new kind of Bhojpuri cinema, with lust for excellence instead of box-office returns, select a new-breed Director, matching Art Director, Cameraman, Script writer etc, and produce films that will earn laurels for Bhojpuri cinema, and adorn the Film Archives and libraries in India and elsewhere in future as immortal classics worth viewing again and again. Long live Bhojpuri cinema !\n\n————————————————————————————————–\n\nThe writer is a retired officer,presently a social and cultural activist,occasionally teaching and writing about cinema, he is also one of the torch bearers of Cine society Patna.\n\nBy Ratnakar Sadasyula\n\nAmong the Anand brothers, Chetan Anand had his own distinct identity. Not a flamboyant superstar like Dev nor a very popular director like Vijay , Chetan neverthless managed to carve out his own distinctive identity. His very first debut as a director was with an offbeat movie called Neecha Nagar( 1946) scripted by K.A.Abbas. In 1954 he directed brother Dev in a noirish crime flick Taxi Driver, which also had some great songs, following it up with Funtoosh in 1956 kind of a black comedy. He also came up with one of the best Indian war movies, in Haqeeqat(1964) featuring an ensemble cast of Balraj Sahni, Dharmendra, Sanjay Khan, Jayant, Vijay Anand and Priya Rajvansh. Heer Ranjha in 1970 was a landmark movie, in the sense that the entire movie was shot in verse form, with dialogues written by Kaifi Azmi, and a fabuluous musical score by Madan Mohan. Hanste Zakhm in 1973, had a decidedly bold theme for its time, and Saheb Bahadur in 1976 was a Bollywood adaptation of Gogol’s play The Inspector General, starring brother Dev and Chetan’s love Priya Rajvansh, who would appear in almost every movie of his from Haqeeqat onwards.\n\nChetan Anand also directed the debut movie of Rajesh Khanna, Aakhri Khat, and in 1981 both of them teamed up together for Kudrat. The movie also starred Chetan’s muse Priya Rajvansh, Vinod Khanna, Hema Malini and Raaj Kumar. Set in Shimla, the movie begins with the arrival of the heroine Chandramukhi( Hema Malini) there for a vacation. In Shimla she meets Dr. Naresh Gupta( Vinod Khanna), a pyshciatrist and the son of her mother’s friend. Both Chandra and Naresh, fall in love with each other, and every thing seems fine. Until Chandra starts to have a series of nightmares where she finds herself chasing a man. Also she roams around Shimla with Naresh, she finds something familiar in all the sights and sounds. Naresh tries his best to get her back to normal stage, even hypnotizing and trying to make her recall her childhood days, and past life, but to no avail. At the same time, Mohan Kapoor( Rajesh Khanna) , arrives to take charge as Public Prosecutor, and also meets his benefactor Chaudhury Janak Singh( Raaj Kumar), a wealthy and highly respected person in Shimla. Chaudhury had financed Mohan’s education, and also raised him, for which he is eternally grateful to him. He is also set to marry his fiance Karuna Singh( Priya Rajvansh), Choudhury’s daughter and an advocate herself.\n\nInterestingly Priya Rajvansh, who played the romantic lead opposite Raj Kumar in Chetan Anand’s Heer Ranjha, now plays his daughter. Generally in Bollywood, it is the other way around, where heroines find themselves playing mama to the same hero, opposite whom they played the romantic lead( Rakhee in Shakti playing Amitabh’s mother). The only other such example i can recall is Saira Banu who made her debut as a heroine opposite Shammi Kapoor in Jungle, and then later played his daughter in Zameer.\n\nAnyway comming back to the movie, one fine day, Chandra happens to see Mohan, at the Mall in Shimla, and that immediately sends her into a flashback. In a well shot scene, where Chetan Anand, skilfuly depicts the transition between present and past, we see Mohan and Chandra in a totally different avatar. In their past life Mohan was Madho, and Chandra was Paro, both of them working as servants on the sprawling estate of Chaudhury who is then an officer in the British Army. There seems to be a Devdas reference here,considering Hema’s names in the movie Chandramukhi/Paro. In the flashback, we see that Madho and Paro are deeply in love with each other, giving rise to two lovely songs, “Tune O Rangeele Kaise Jaadu Kiya” by Lata and of course that unforgettable Kishore da classic “Humein Tumse Pyaar Kitna”. End of flashback and Mohan is surprised to see Chandramukhi holding on to him.\n\nThe movie takes on a turn here, with Chandra clearly remembering every detail of her past life, and recognizing Mohan aka Madho as her lover from pichle janam. Naresh meets Mohan and explains to him about Chandra’s condition. Initially dismissive about it, however succesive meetings with Chandra begins to convince Mohan, that what she is telling is the truth. Mohan is now slowly falling in love with Chandra, which does not go down well with Chaudhury, who accuses him of getting influenced by a paagal ladki. Karuna however decides to step aside, and invites Chandra to her home, on the very day, Chaudhury is supposed to announce her engagement with Mohan. At the party, Chandra lets out a terrified scream on seeing Choudhury, and flees from the party, shocking every one.\n\nIs Chaudhury the same person responsible for the rape and murder of a local girl called Paro some 20 years back? Would Mohan go against his own benefactor and prosecute him? What is the truth behind the nightmare Chandra is having? Well would not want to give away too many details of the plot, but do watch the movie to know more.\n\nKudrat was clearly one of the better movies released in the 80′s. There are many scenes that do grip your attention in the movie.\n\nThe scene where Vinod Khanna tries to make Hema Malini reveal her past life.\n\nHema listening to Aruna Irani, singing “Humein Tumse Pyaar Kitna” in a concert, and running out scared. Rajesh Khanna confronting Raj Kumar and accusing him of being the culprit. The final courtroom scene where Priya and Rajesh Khanna face off in court.\n\nHema taking Rajesh Khanna around and trying to make him remember their past life.\n\nAlso the screenplay is tight, and does not meander too much. Chetan Anand mingles a reincarnation drama with a thriller format, and does a really good job of it. We are kept wondering till the end, what would be happening next.\n\nThe movie also has a great background score by R.D.Burman, a kind of haunting score, especially every time when Hema sees something connected to her past life.\n\nKudrat i think is the only movie of Chetan Anand for which Pancham scored, and he comes up with an album that is really first rate. Great lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri too.\n\n1) The title song by Mohd Rafi is a background song, which is played at the beginning of the movie, and at certain stages in the movie.\n\n2) Chodo Sanam by Kishore is a peppy club song, which is picturized on Vinod Khanna, when he tries to cheer up Hema.\n\n3) Saawan Nahin Bhaado Nahi is a Himachali folk song kind, again picturized on Vinod Khanna and Hema Malini.\n\n4) Humein Tumse Pyaar Kitna- Clearly the best song of the movie. And one of the best songs from Pancham-Kishore. The opening musical interludes, wonderfully recreate the folk ambience, and also the way Pancham builds up the tension with the tabla beats in the musical interludes. And the lyrics by Majrooh are a delight for any romantic\n\n“sunaa gam judaee kaa, uthhaate hain log\n\njaane jindagee kaise, bitaate hain log\n\ndin bhee yahaa to lage,\n\nbaras ke samaan ”\n\nAnd Kishore da’s singing is of highest quality here. The 80′s was the period when Kishore Da was at the peak of his singing abilities, and if you can forgive and overlook his Jeetu special numbers, some of his best songs came during this period.\n\nIt is no wonder that Jhankaar Beats paid a tribute to this song, which would always go down as one of RD’s best.\n\nThere is also a female version of this song, by Parveen Sultana, which is a total classical number.\n\n5) Tune o Rangeele Kaisa Jaadu Kiya- Sweet romantic number by Lata here. Loved the way Pancham, makes use of the instruments here to create a wonderful rythm. Lovely lyrics too here\n\n“O mere saajan, kaisi ye dhadkan\n\nShor machaane lagi man mein\n\nJaise leheraaye nadiya ka paani\n\nLaher uthe re mere tan mein\n\nMujh mein samaake ye kya kiya, o re piya ho ho”\n\nKudrat also has some great performances from the main actors.\n\nRaj Kumar as the arrogant Colonel and later on as the benevolent rich respected person, gives a fine performance, especially in the scene when Rajesh Khanna accuses him.\n\nRajesh Khanna does well as the young advocate, who is forced to turn against his mentor, while Chetan’s favorite Priya Rajvansh, is really effective, as the woman who fights to save her father’s name. Hema Malini however with her accented Hindi and hammy expresssions, is a disappointment, while Vinod Khanna gives good support as the doctor.\n\nKudrat also has some effective supporting performances, notably from A.K.Hangal as one of the key witnesses to the murder, a change from the usual hapless father roles he plays, and Aruna Irani as Hema’s friend Satto in her past life.\n\nKudrat had everything going for it, an interesting storyline, good performances from the lead actors, a lovely soundtrack and a good screenplay. But somehow the movie did not work at the box office, even though the theme of reincarnation was quite popular at that time. All the same i would still recommend you to watch this movie, which though a mainstream movie, is still much better than the standard Bollywood fare.\n\n—————————————————————————————————\n\nPost Courtesy http://www.bihardays.com"
