        "text": "Bollywood has had a long history of lawyers, both good and bad. Some actors have made repeat portrayals of men / women in black and white – like Amrish Puri was the corrupt lawyer in both Sunny Deol’s Damini and Anil Kapoor’s Meri Jung. But we’re really not into the misleading advocates. Amitabh Bachchan’s edgy portrayal in the upcoming Pink has inspired us to dig deep into the archives and bring you the best lawyers in Hindi films. These men and women up hold the justice, for most parts, and save the day both legally and heroically.\n\nArshad Warsi in Jolly LLB\n\nArshad Warsi as the lawyer from Meerut in Jolly LLB was nothing short of a gangster, at least in his disposition. He goes from an ambitious advocate trying to gain advantage from the PIL system (Public Interest Litigation) to a justice seeking vigilante lawyer. The thing that sets him apart from the crowd is that he’s not a stickler for rules. In his pursuit for justice he doesn’t mind taking a few short cuts and employing backhand tactics, to throw the system into place. A wily but honest lawyer, Arshad Warsi’s Jolly LLB is definitely a memorable Hindi movie lawyer.\n\nRani Mukerji in Veer-Zaara\n\nRani Mukerji had recently stated that had she not been an actor, she’d probably been a lawyer. Perhaps that’s why she made such a convincing upholder of the law and seeker of justice in Yash Chopra’s Veer-Zaara. In her quest for justice she crosses the border and takes the investigation to India. In her attempt to save Veer (Shah Rukh Khan) she reaches Zaara (Preity Zinta) in India. Not just that, she starts off as a feminist and a law abiding professional who is hell-bent on getting ladies in Pakistan their rightful justice. That’s the right kind of attitude for a hero lawyer.\n\nKareena Kapoor in Aitraaz\n\nKareena Kapoor has played many diverse roles in her career but none as effectively as the wife doubling as a lawyer in Aitraaz. Even though the court room drama on offer here was slightly formulaic, it was Kareena’s character’s situation that made her role so appealing. Her husband (Akshay Kumar) is in court fighting a case of sexual harassment, the defence lawyer is injured in a hit and run, the evidence is stacked against her husband, she doubts her husband’s motives too, but above all that conjecture, she chooses to pursue the truth. That is what makes her a great lawyer.\n\nSunny Deol in Damini\n\nSunny Deol’s portrayal of a down on luck, angry and alcoholic lawyer in Damini is the stuff court room legends are made of. Dialogue from the movie – Tarik pe tarik, tarik pe tarik and Yeh dhai kilo ka haath hai have made Sunny Deol a certified Bollywood legend. The fact that he gave no heed to subtlety and went about seeking justice like a juggernaut made his portrayal of Govind an absolute winner. Amrish Puri’s senior but conniving lawyer role seemed like a damp squib in front of the aggressive intensity of Sunny Deol’s Govind.\n\nAmjad Khan in Chameli Ki Shaadi\n\nNot every lawyer needs to be the centre of attraction in a court room to be a winner. Amjad Khan’s advocate act in Chameli Ki Shaadi was more of a hitch than a lawyer, but it was the uniqueness of this role that made it so memorable. Anil Kapoor and Amrita Singh played the quintessential young lovers facing family opposition and they find their messiah in the quick thinking and happy-go-lucky lawyer Harish (Amjad Khan).\n\nAnil Kapoor in Meri Jung\n\nJustice at all costs. That was what made Anil Kapoor’s young lawyer act such a big hit in Meri Jung. He goes from a vengeance seeking young lawyer named Arun to an unlikely saviour finding his own catharsis while he defends an honest doctor in court. All this against the reputable but corrupt advocate Thakral (Amrish Puri) who’s destroyed Arun’s home and his parent’s goodwill. Next to Sunny Deol in Damini and Anil Kapoor’s frustrated, resilient and honest lawyer act is one of Bollywood’s most defining memories ever.\n\nSmita Patil in Aaj Ki Awaaz\n\nIn the peak of her career, Smita Patil owned the role of an honest and gritty lawyer in Ravi Chopra’s Aaj Ki Awaaz. At first she loses the case where she’s prosecutor as Raj Babbar is fighting against Dalip Tahil for alleged rape. When the accused Tahil walks free, he kills and rapes Babbar’s sister. That puts Smita Patil in charge of a resultant case where Babbar is being tried for killing everyone who raped his sister. Smita’s performance is that of an honest professional seeking justice against the pressures of corruption and politicians. It was just the kind of role that made Anil Kapoor and Sunny Deol legends, and Smita bought oodles of grace and subtlety to her performance.\n\nNaseeruddin Shah in Aakrosh and Mohan Joshi Haazir Ho\n\nThe more memorable role of Naseeruddin Shah as a lawyer is in Govind Nihalani’s Aakrosh. But a few years after that film on simmering rage and injustice came the underrated Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho. Here, Nasseruddin Shah plays a manipulative and conniving lawyer who fleeces his clients and drags cases in court for long hauls just so he can earn money. It’s the exact opposite of his portrayal of the honest and frustrated lawyer in Aakrosh. While his performance in Aakrosh is the straight-laced hero, his corrupt character in the satire Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho is so bad he turns out to be good, at least when you consider the sarcastic nature of this satire.\n\nRekha in Mujhe Insaaf Chahiye\n\nBe-spectacled, black robes and a little older than her age, Rekha’s Shakuntala in Mujhe Insaaf Chahiye wasn’t her usual glamorous self on-screen. While she wasn’t her usual beautiful self she was in a contemporary role fighting for women’s rights. That’s why she takes up the civil court matter of Rati Agnihotri and Mithun Chakraborty. Rati’s pregnant with Mithun’s child who refuses to marry her. Rekha ends up winning the case thanks to her flawless investigations and in-court statements. She eventually dies in the film but she never falls from grace, despite being a single mother.\n\nSunil Dutt in Mera Saaya and Waqt\n\nSunil Dutt played two memorable roles as a lawyer. Both times he was a truth seeking professional, but the roles differed in their emotions. He was a mourning husband perplexed by his dead wife’s look-alike in Mera Saaya while he was a son desperate to get his older brother freed from corrupt charges in Court. The jury is divided on which role merits the hero tag better. So when it comes to Sunil Dutt’s efforts in a court room we recommend both movies.\n\nDev Anand in Baat Ek Raat Ki\n\nDev Anand played a corny lawyer in Paying Guest alongside Nutan, but that comedy was more about love than Anand’s prowess as a court room specialist. So it was Baat Ek Raat Ki with Waheeda Rehman where the debonair actor made his mark as a lawyer. Defending Waheeda in a murder case, he plays an advocate with a strong hunch and perseverance for truth. He also employs an interesting plan that exposes the real villain of the story. It’s his wily and street smart disposition coupled with his charisma that makes Dev Anand’s Rajesh from Baat Ek Raat Ki stand out.\n\nNargis in Awaara\n\nIn the year 1951, Nargis played an urban girl preparing to become a lawyer. It was a progressive role made all the more special by the fact that, she ends up defending her lover at court for murder. The court room drama only takes place in the latter parts of Awaara, most of the film Nargis plays the city girl. But once she does don the black and white Court dress she becomes an emotional but high on reasoning advocate. She’s pragmatic and convincing in her arguments which eventually leads to the benefit of Raju (Raj Kapoor) he childhood friend and lover."
