        "text": "As we finally leave the shitshow that was 2020 behind and head with (probably misplaced) optimism into 2021, the Journal brings to you a list of films which are all about the vibes. Light on plot and focusing more on interesting, imperfect people stumbling through life, here are our picks:\n\nTotini recommends: Tu Hai Mera Sunday (2016)\n\nWatching this film is like watching a lazy Sunday mood being spun into a 100-odd minutes on celluloid. A bunch of people amble around living their lives – going to their dull jobs, falling in love, mending relationships with family and playing (several) friendly rounds of football. And yet, there’s a sweetness that lingers in every frame, so much so that you’ll probably smile through the entire thing.\n\nTo put it simply, the next time you’re feeling the need for some good vibes, this is where it’s at. (Available on Netflix)\n\nUtkarsh recommends: Everybody Wants Some!! (2016)\n\nLinklater is no stranger to plotless, vibe-based movies. In the 90s, he gave the world the cult classic Dazed and Confused, which just followed 70s high school kids loafing around. Everybody Wants Some is like a spiritual sequel, following college students in the 80s through their vague, fakedeep conversations and leisurely strolls. Nothing happens, or if something does, it’s inconsequential enough that I’ve forgotten all about it. (Rent on Amazon)\n\nAditi recommends: Chungking Express (1994)\n\nWong Kar-wai movies are all about the vibes. Famous for quite literally making up the plot as he shot his films, he often let the “plot” take a backseat while the camera follows his characters wander through the dreamlike, neon-soaked cityscape of Hong Kong. Chungking Express is about as Wong Kar-wai as it gets, with the story following two lonely cops dealing with recent heartbreaks. They each meet and fall for a mysterious alluring drug dealer and a free-spirited snack bar employee respectively. The first five minutes of the film that throw you straight into the crowded streets of Hong Kong is a whole vibe in itself, and captures perfectly that feeling of being lost in the big city.\n\nGayatri recommends: The Before Trilogy – Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004), Before Midnight (2013)\n\nAnother set of Linklater films, the Before series sets its intimate tone with the focus on intense dialogue. The free-flowing deep conversation between the two love interests is engaging enough to the point that it almost allows the audience to become a part of it. Their journey throughout the three films as they navigate life makes up the bulk of these movies, and the audience gets to experience this journey with them, watching the two grow as people. (Available on Netflix)\n\nKhushi recommends: Lost in Translation (2003)\n\nThe film (which netted director Sofia Coppola an Oscar for best screenplay) follows an American actor Bob, as he lands in Tokyo for an ad film and ends up meeting Charlotte, who’s left behind by her photographer husband. The two end up forming a connection, in that way strangers do when they’re alone in a foreign city. The film is buoyed by the intense, controlled performances of its two leads as they grapple with their respective emotional crises, and the culture shock of being in Tokyo, and leaves you with that perfect feeling of romantic melancholy with an aftertaste of bittersweet-ness.\n\nVidit recommends: Arvind Desai ki Ajeeb Dastan (1978)"
