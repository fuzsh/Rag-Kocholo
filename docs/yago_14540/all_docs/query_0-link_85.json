        "text": "Vivek Agnihotri-directed The Kashmir Files has been embroiled in controversy for the longest time. Recently, the film based on the genocide of Kashmiri Pandits made headlines after Israeli filmmaker Nadav Lapid called it 'vulgar' and a 'propaganda' film during the closing ceremony of IFFI 2022. Now, in a recent interview with a leading daily, director Saeed Akhtar Mirza criticised the film and said it is 'garbage'. He was quick to add that while The Kashmir Files is 'garbage', the Kashmiri Pandit issue is real.\n\nIn the interview, the Nukkad director shared his opinion and said, \"For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. Is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests, and paid guys from across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.\"\n\nRecommended Read: SS Rajamouli's RRR, Vivek Agnihotri's The Kashmir Files to R Madhavan's Rocketry: The Nambi Effect & Rishab Shetty's Kantara, take a look at IMDb's top 10 movies of 2022\n\nDuring the closing ceremony of IFFI 2022 in Goa, Lapid said in his statement, \"I would like to thank the head of the festival and the director of the programming for the cinematic richness of the programme, for its diversity, for its complexity. It was intense. We saw seven films in the debutant competition, and 15 films in the international competition, the front window of the festival. 14 out of them had cinematic qualities, defaults and evoked vivid discussions. All of us were disturbed and shocked by the 15th film, The Kashmir Files. That felt like a propaganda, vulgar movie, inappropriate for an artistic competitive section of such a prestigious film festival. I feel totally comfortable openly sharing these feelings here with you at this stage. In the spirit of this festival, we can surely also accept a critical discussion, which is essential for art and life.\"\n\nThis led to a major outrage on social media. Vivek along with the entire starcast of The Kashmir Files slammed Lapid for his comment. Furthermore, Israeli envoy to India Naor Gilon criticised the filmmaker and said he should be ashamed of his remark. Post the backlash, Lapid clarified, \"On propaganda: no one can determine what propaganda is, I accept this fact, it’s a brilliant movie. What I have done it’s my duty to say what I see. It’s a very subjective way.\"\n\nFor the unversed, Saeed Akhtar Mirza has written films like Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho (1984), Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyoon Aata Hai (1980), Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro (1989) and Naseem (1995). He has worked on television shows like Nukkad (1986) and Intezaar (1988)."
