(Summons for Mohan Joshi ) is a 1984 Hindi art film, made by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, based on his own story, during the Parallel Cinema period of Indian cinema.[1]\n\nThe film is a comic satire on a judicial system, where cases drag on for decades, where plaintives either die or lose hope and money, while the corrupt run scot free, thanks to their nexus with corrupt lawyers.\n\nThe film won the 1984 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.\n\nContents\n\n1 Synopsis\n\n2 Cast\n\n3 Trivia\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nSynopsis\n\nAn old couple, Mohan Joshi (Bhisham Sahni) and his wife (Dina Pathak) decides to sue their landlord (Amjad Khan) for not maintaining their 'collapsing' apartment building. For this, they hire two cunning lawyers (Naseeruddin Shah and Satish Shah), while Rohini Hattangadi is the opposition lawyer.\n\nThe court case drags on for years and the lawyers milk the old couple dry, while they become rich. Back home in the society, the old couple is ridiculed for fighting the landlord, but they fight on nevertheless.\n\nIn the end when the judge comes to check the condition of the chawl, Kapadia's men prop up the place thus convincing the judge that all is well with the chawl. Finally, Joshi gathers all his strength and pulls down the temporary supports put up by the men causing the building to collapse on himself.[2]\n\nThe film provides deep insight into the struggles of Indian 'middle class', which rarely gets space on the film screen.\n\nCast\n\nNaseeruddin Shah as Advocate Malkani\n\nBhisham Sahni as Mohan Joshi\n\nDina Pathak as Joshi's wife\n\nDeepti Naval\n\nMohan Gokhale\n\nRohini Hattangadi as Advocate\n\nPankaj Kapur\n\nAmjad Khan as Kundan Kapadia, landlord\n\nSatish Shah as Advocate\n\nSalim Ghouse as Advocate\n\nTrivia\n\nThe film was shot at Kamithapura, Bapty Road, & Duncan Road ( Two Tanks / Do Tanki) at Mumbai's middle class Hindu Muslim Locality.\n\nReferences"
