        "text": "Naseeruddin Shah is in a completely new Bhoomika - his directorial debut Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota has hit the theatres.\n\nIt has indeed been Such A Long Journey, starting from Nishant in 1975 to Omkara in 2006. So here’s the versatile actor, Hero Hiralal, talking about his Junoon — movies, movies and just movies.\n\nMohan Joshi (aka Naseer) Hazir Ho: “I wanted to direct a movie since my NSD days but I wasn’t sure of the audience and the producer for my kind of movie. In Yun Hota To Kya Hota, I have tried communicate a tale that I would like to hear or see.” But Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai?\n\nJoining The League: Yun Hota... has materialised just the way I had visualised, sans any exotic locales, flashy costumes or dance numbers. I owe the movie to my actors, who gave their hundred percent.”\n\nAnd to say the least, the Katha from the Shah stable has just begun as after his wife, Ratna, daughter Heeba, now his son Imaad is ready to make a mark in Bollywood.\n\nKarma calling, you see! “This industry has a fetish for slotting films in genres and categories. I despise the idea. Neither am I eyeing any award, because to get an award, especially a National Award, one has to be loud, cry a lot, shout or be demented, nor my film boasts of any such characters.”\n\nToo much Mirch Masala: “I have done about 150 films and have dabbled in other forms too - theatre and TV. While theatre is like my life, cinema is my passion. Both have taught me a lot. I owe a lot to Shyam Benegal and Gulzaar saab, who are responsible for the Naseer that I am today, and also to my family that I could sustain my sanity.”"
