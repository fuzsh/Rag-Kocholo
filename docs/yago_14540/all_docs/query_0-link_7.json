In 1984, Syed Akhtar Mirza joined hands with the ace author Bhisham Sahni and released the film which was said a true art or parallel film of its time. Bhisham Sahni acted in this movie which was his first in a few films as an actor.\n\nAn old couple, Mohan Joshi (Bhisham Sahni) and his wife (Dina Pathak), sues their landlord (Amjad Khan) for not maintaining their 'collapsing' poor chawl. For this, they hire two cunning lawyers (Naseeruddin Shah and Satish Shah), while Rohini Hattangadi is the opposition lawyer. The court case drags on for years and the lawyers milk the old couple dry, while they become rich. Back home in the society, the old couple is ridiculed for fighting the landlord, but they fight on nevertheless. At the end, when the judge comes to check the condition of the chawl, the landlord's men prop up the place, thus convincing the judge that all is well. Finally, Joshi gathers all his strength and pulls down the temporary supports put up by the men causing the building to collapse on himself.\n\nThe film was written by Akhtar Mirza and Yusuf Mehta while the dialogues were written by Sudhir Mishra. The film was a satire on India's crumbling judicial system, the way it crumbled like Joshi's home. Bhisham Sahni proved himself as a natural actor for the film."
