        "text": "Having earlier strayed into the Delhi theatre scene purely by chance, and subsequently working with theatre group Ruchika, Pavan Malhotra was convinced that he didn’t want to join his father’s machine tools business. His father was worried about how his son would survive in Mumbai, but the Pavan was determined. He came to Mumbai with his theatre friend Sudhir Mishra, who convinced him to stay on.\n\nWhile waiting for his acting career to take off, Pavan worked as a production assistant for Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, Mohan Joshi Haazir Ho, Khamosh and Ab Ayega Mazaa. He was also assistant director for Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron. While working on these projects, he would occasionally be asked to face the camera for tiny roles, till Nukkad (1986) happened.\n\nA role that he is still remembered by, he got it only because things fell through at the last minute with the actor who had been earlier finalised. A firm believer in destiny, Pavan says that any role that has come to him has been because it was destined, not because he sought it out.\n\nPavan says that the 80s were the worst period to begin a journey as an actor. There was so much trash being churned out that it almost killed Amitabh Bachchan as an actor. Small cinema was dying, and yet 1989 turned out to be the most important year of his life — Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro and Bagh Bahadur happened — films with two respected directors, Saeed Akhtar Mirza and Buddhadev Dasgupta.\n\nPavan remembers how he used to accompany director Saeed Mirza for recces to Dongri and Chor Bazaar, never dreaming that he would eventually be Salim Langda.\n\nBeing Ghunuram in Bagh Bahadur was hard work as he was painted everyday before the shoot. After the day’s shoot was over, it would take a half hour kerosene massage to remove the paint.\n\nIn retrospect, it was worth the pain as the National Award winning film brought him international recognition and another film Brothers in Trouble (1995). Getting two memorable roles in the same year should have been a dream start but his filmography shows that the important roles in his career have been spaced out.\n\nAfter Salim Langde… and Bagh Bahadur, when all other magazines wrote about him, the top five ‘glossies’ never did. Commercial cinema welcomed him much later, in character roles.\n\nAs Pavan puts it, “When you walk into a producer’s office, you should look like a star, and I never quite fitted that bill. If I am an actor, I should be able to do all kinds of roles.” He points out that Balraj Sahni was never as big a star as Rajendra Kumar, and even good actors like Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan were trapped in a stereotypical image for a while.\n\nHappily, every few years, some important film came by, notably Brothers in Trouble (1995), 1947 Earth (1998), Black Friday (2004), Don (2006), Jab We Met (2007), Delhi 6 (2009), Road to Sangam (2009) and Badmash Company (2010). “If you want to do a certain kind of work, you should be willing to wait”, he remarks.\n\nA method actor, who convincingly essayed the role of underworld Don Memon in Black Friday, and changed his voice totally to be a Maulvi in Road to Sangam, it is sometimes difficult when he lands in a commercial set-up, where a bound script is made only for the censors (after the film is ready), not for the actors! The kind of cinema he is in is not important, the role and his ability to reach out to the audience is. He says that he is as proud of Jab We Met as he is of Black Friday.\n\nPavan talks about the time when Road to Sangam released alongside two big films — Rann and Ishqiya. “Even my friends told me that they would watch Ishqiya first. Publicity is the crucial factor in determining a film’s box office fate today,” he says. Quoting Shahrukh Khan, he points out that a film release has to be an event these days. If the five screens of a multiplex offer varied fare, the one drawing the biggest crowds is the most publicised one and the one with stars.\n\nLife has not been too easy for Pavan, but even while assisting Saeed, he chose a second class rail pass over the first class one offered, wanting the pushing crowds to motivate him to succeed. He hopes life never makes him travel in Mumbai locals again, and he would like to make crores and fly first class always. “We all make compromises, but I wouldn’t like to make too many”, he concludes. Yes, there is some regret that he never got a National Award for Salim Langde… or Bagh Bahadur, but he’s proud of the Special Jury mention that he got for Gautam Ghose’s short film Fakir.\n\n“I never thought I would become an actor. At the time I started doing theatre, I was just having fun”, says Pavan. He wants to be an actor in his next life, but do better so that the ‘glossies’ too write about him. “It’s not that you have to be at the right queue at the right time, but that destiny brings you to the right queue at the right time,” he adds.\n\nAs for his worried father, Pavan remembers the time when he went to his dad’s office after Nukkad. He remembers the huge crowd outside, waving at them from a window and the surprise and pride on his father’s face. He is glad Pawan became an actor, but contentment should never come in the way of aspiring for more."
