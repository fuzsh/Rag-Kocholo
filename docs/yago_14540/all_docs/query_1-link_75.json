        "text": "From the day when I first saw the trailers of ‘Finding Fanny’, I am highly excited to watch these actors into a typically different film. There are two most attractive elements of the film, the actors Pankaj Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shah. These “SAADU” bhais are coming together after a very very long time. Now when I go back in times, the films of these two actors are always the masterpieces. Beyond fabulous films like Mandi (1983), Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! (1984), Maqbool (2004) and others, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron (1983) is quiet very similar to Finding Fanny. Let me tell you how!\n\nThe most important point, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron was a game changer, trend changer and tradition changer of that time. When I was reading Jai Arjun Singh’s book on this epic film, I found that actually Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron created an impact on viewers as well as other filmmakers of bollywood to make a different kind of film. In 1983, when people were obsessed with Amitabh Bachhan action and Rishi Kapoor romance, two things hampered bollywood with a big change in film making. One was Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi which was released in that year and the other was Kundan Shah’s Jaane bhi do Yaaron. Gandhi, because Richard made it with so much perfection and clarity that life of Gandhi came out in the best manner. Jaane bhi Do yaaron as no one had ever watched a black comedy with much naughtiness in a film.\n\nOn this, Finding Fanny is a fresh piece of humor with emotions attached in it. This film has the potential to change the trends of Indian film making especially for the comedy films. In the floods of films subjected for 100 crore club, this could be an exception of making a film as if you are painting a masterpiece. The film to genuinely entertain people in this time. Well, let’s see how Finding Fanny reaches to people who love Salman bhai in Kick.\n\nSecondly, in Jaane bhi do Yaaron, Naseeruddin Shah was the protagonist in the film who is a loser in everything he do. All other characters in the film had significantly important role to play and to contribute in the story. But the plot was revolving around Naseeruddin Shah and his friend only. Same is happening in the Homi Ajadania’s film where all the characters are finding Fanny but the actual protagonist is Naseeruddin Shah only. The character of Ferdie is finding his 46 years old love Fanny and all other characters are helping him out.\n\n‘Tarneja’, the negative character in that epic played by Pankaj Kapoor who kill D’mello (Satish Shah) for some purpose. No body saw a tharki villian before where you can easily fool him by putting a girl (Neena Gupta) in. Lolz for all villians of a comedy film.We have seen the little tharkiness of Pankaj Kapoor in his latest, Matru ki bijlee ka Mandola, where he was addicted to a peculiar brand of liquor and flirts with Shabana Azmi.\n\nBut that Tarneja has really explored the tharkiness and using it with full explosion in Finding Fanny. Pankaj Kapoor here playing an artist and flirts with Dimple to complete a painting. Also, the character Don Pedro played by him, became a little negative in the end. That relates it with JBDY too.\n\nA friendship tale altogether! Deepika Padukone, the really sensuous part of the film, Finding Fanny actually convince everybody for a road trip to find a girl named FANNY for his dear friend Ferdie. Angie aka Deepika makes all her efforts to find Fanny for his dear friend. Exactly like, Jaane bhi do Yaaro, where Ravi Baswani supported his friend Naseeruddin Shah in all his crimes and charities in the film. We had fun watching a friendship story of both of them and same will happen in this 2014 film.\n\nYes, the only different thing is Dimple Kapadia. Oh! She was also a central part of many moments in the film. She is proving herself with her skills and still reminds us the freshness of the films like Bobby and Janbaaz. Arjun Kapoor also acted on the similar grounds to these all actors and that will really help to his career.\n\nOut and out, I am in strong support of films like Finding Fanny as they take you in another world of humor, satire and emotions of the characters linked in it. I also have faith in the films which have good story, well written script and exceptional actors. And of all these points, the epic Jaane bhi do yaaron and Finding Fanny has thumbs up.\n\n-Tanmay Chandniwala"
