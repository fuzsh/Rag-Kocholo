When we talk of Hindi art-house cinema, two names overwhelmingly emerge as the most popular faces – Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah. The two giants of the parallel cinema may overshadow the third one in terms of popular appeal but not in terms of sheer talent. The third man is Pankaj Kapur. He is hugely gifted, rarely seen (he picks his projects carefully) and is widely respected for his commitment to good cinema. He’s the actor’s actor, Bollywood’s Brando who can dazzle you with his understated menace (Maqbool), dead-face humour (Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro and Office Office, the TV show) or drunken buffoonery (Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola). He made his film debut with Shyam Benegal's film Arohan (1982). Following that he played the role of Mahatma Gandhi's second secretary Pyarelal, in the Richard Attenbrough film Gandhi in 1982. Thereafter, he appeared in a string of powerful art films that came under the Parallel Cinema category, with leading art film directors, starting with Shyam Benegal's Mandi (1983) and Kundan Shah's comedy classic Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro again in 1983; this was followed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza's satirical Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho! (1984), Mrinal Sen's hauntingly poignant Khandhar (1984), and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's suspense thriller Khamosh in 1985. In 1986, he switched to television, with his memorable role of 'Karamchand Jasoos' in the detective-comedy, Karamchand, also starring Shushmita Mukherjee. The serial got him instant nation-wide popularity. Over the years, he has been seen in numerous TV serials, including, 'Kab Tak Pukaroon' (Doordarshan) 'Zabaan Sambhaal' Ke, a remake of English TV series, Mind Your Language; 'Lifeline' with Vijaya Mehta, 'Neem ka Ped' which displayed his finest acting prowess on television, and finally comic interludes in 'Philips Top 10' which made him once again, a favourite of the masses. He is a master of understated elegance and nowhere is it more at display than in the Tapan Sinha classic 'Ek Doctor Ki Maut'. Released in 1990, it went on to wow critics and award juries. The veteran actor turns 69 today."
