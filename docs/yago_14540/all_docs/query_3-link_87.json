        "text": "May 21, 2013\n\nBetween the pages of history\n\nSoumyabrata Gupta\n\nAcclaimed filmmaker Saeed Akhtar Mirza’s second novel (the first being Ammi: Letters to a democratic mother) is not a very easy book to describe or criticize. Four students from an American University in Berkeley embark upon a quest of identity and truth behind reality, which if analysed properly can shake the very pillars of western civilization and its claims to superiority. A sense of futility, fuelled by a sense of distrust towards an ethnic group in America (An American politician saying that Obama is not an Arab, but, a decent American citizen)prompts the four protagonists, namely Omar (an Arabic by descent), Sandeep (Indian), Steven (African) and Linda question the very basis of western supremacy.\n\nThe narration in the novel vacillates between three time frames. The present with its four protagonists and their quest for answers along with Rehana, an Iranian from the eleventh century and her life, love and pursuit of learning and education as well as a third, that of Moses Ben Jalloun and his experiences of translating four texts along with a Monk and a Moor. Meandering between two timeframes, the book is a complex read, spanning centuries of depiction and literature. The basis of the novel lies in Omar and his band of friends, who call themselves the House of Wisdom, trying to decipher whether the West’s claim to fame in terms of literature, poetry and a host of other subjects is in fact based in reality or is indeed shrouded in dubious mystery. Debating with a professor about the basis of western literature, referring to Dante’s Inferno, as being a “plagiarized concept” taken from Prophet Mohammad’s The Book of Ascent or Kitab al-Miraj, Omar goes on to say within the pages of the book that, “My charges go much beyond literature and poetry, sir. I believe that the entire edifice of Western science, mathematics, philosophy, medicine, architecture and even music needs to be reviewed, because they all are suspect.” Elucidating further, Omar adds in a defiant note, “I believe there has been a deliberate cover-up of history, sir! ...A cover –up of history, sir, which I believe smacks of racism.” Mirza thus sets the tone of the fiery tale of The Monk, the Moor and Moses Ben Jalloun.\n\nDebating upon such a scorching accusation is indeed tricky. But what Mirza has done is opened up a new vista of understanding and looking at things from a different perspective. It is well known that the Eastern civilizations had already reached their pinnacle of civilizations while the west was still grappling in darkness. Thus when new inroads into technology and various arts were taking place in renaissance Europe, was it not possible that many of the ‘new’ discoveries made by European scholars were actually ‘borrowed’ from the east and somehow the credits were ‘lost’ in translation? The possibilities are many.\n\nOmar, shown to be the descendant of one Moses Ben Jalloun, who it seems, was one of the best translators of his time during the mid thirteenth century in Toledo, comes across Moses’s diary, which apparently had survived the test of time. Thus armed with facts from an age gone by and forgotten in the pages of history he starts digging around to validate his point to a greater extent. The diary which becomes one of the major points of reference in the story, in its turn, slowly reveals the thought processes of one Monk, one Moor and Moses as they sit and translate four texts. Running in parallel to the present story of Omar and the House of Wisdom, the ancient thirteenth century story is akin in its accusation and counter accusations, as a fierce debate rages between the Cistercian Monk and the Moor as they argue about the influence of the Arabic ethos over Western civilization. The parallel running arguments however reach a similar conclusion of many western ideas having been borrowed by the West and subsequently passed on as its own. The particular narrative of the Monk, Moor and Moses finds completion when the Cistercian Monk loses some of his earlier Puritan rigidity and orthodoxy regarding the omnipotence of their own western cultural and theological thought processes and embraces Arabic and eastern ideas to a more prevalent extent.\n\nWhat makes the novel all the more interesting in its complexity is the author’s incorporation of the third narrative of Abu Rehan al-Biruni. By doing so he takes us further back to a period during the eleventh century, when this real life historical figure practiced science and philosophy, much of what was later imbibed by the west as its own. The third narrative follows the journey of Rehana, who is shown to be the daughter of Rehan’s friend and his namesake. It follows her journey through her questions and queries as she moves from childhood to her youth and from one civilization to another as, according to real history as well, Abu Rehan, along with many other scholars, was taken away by the emperor Mahmud Ghazni to to Ghazna, the capital of the Ghazniad dynasty. Al-Biruni’s acquaintance with India and Sanskrit has also been noted by the author in his book through the narratives of Rehan and Rehana (who too followed the scholar to Ghazna, owing to her marriage to Dilawar Khan, a Pashtun commander in Mahmud Ghazni’s army).\n\nThe novel, thus, traces three narratives from three vastly different time frames and all of them driving towards similar conclusions. How much does the west owe to the east in its progression? The author has dexterously incorporated the lives of historical figures Jabir Ibn Hayyan (the world’s first alchemist), Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi (the world’s first surgeon), among others to Nicholas Copernicus and his book on the universe, which often considered to be one of the greatest discoveries in western science, according to Mirza was derived from the works of two Arab astronomers. He painstakingly tries to validate the view, through rigorous examples, that what the West considers to be the pillars of their supremacy over the world was in fact discovered by the East. The book however, cannot be claimed to be a one sided view of matters. The author does intend to present a more than glorious picture of the Islamic world in his portrayal, in comparison to the European civilizations. However, Linda’s haunting query of whether even if everything glorious about the west was taken from the world of Islam, then what did Islam do to withhold their glorious past, is a raging question in itself.\n\nThe author has cleverly crafted a piece of literature, slyly inserting facts in the garb of fiction, often disturbing in its accusatory tones yet oddly wonderful in its read. Granted it has its flaws, with the author presenting an overtly glorious picture of the Middle East and Omar’s oblique answer towards Linda’s question, “What happened to Islam since those times?” But what he drives at in the very concluding page of the novel, “As George Bush extolled the virtues of ‘democracy’ and freedom’” at the aftermath of the war in Iraq, “…the journalist removed his shoe and flung it with all his might at the president” reverberates strongly in ones mind as the journalist shouts out in the novel, “This is for all the widows and orphans you have created, you dog,” the issue of supremacy in a ‘globalised’ world based on equality, finds voice. A rare collectors item, this book is highly recommended for all lovers of literature.\n\n(as appearing in The Bengal Post newspaper in July 2012)"
