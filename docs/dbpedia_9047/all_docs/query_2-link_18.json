        "text": "David Murray, a young tenor‐saxophonist who has emerged as one of the more fluent and promising players on this instrument since he arrived in New York more than a year ago, went long way toward fulfilling his promise Wednesday at New York University's Eisner and Lubin Auditorium.\n\nUnlike many younger saxophonists, who feel called upon to express themselves in lengthy, multinoted solos, Mr. Murray is a team player, and on Wednesdays he shared his performing time with the rugged individualists in his quintet. But he did not shortchange his own powers of expression in the process.\n\nMr. Murray's music ranges widely in style and mood, but on Wednesday the impact of the late Albert Ayler on his work was unusually strong.\n\nMr. Murray's co‐workers contributed significantly to the direction of the music. Olu Dara, the trumpeter, is another strikingly original soloist, and Hamiet Bleuitt contributed an expansive bottom and rough, growling improvisations on baritone saxophone."
