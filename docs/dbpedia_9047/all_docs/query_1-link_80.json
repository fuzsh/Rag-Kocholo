        "text": "David Murray\n\nPianist\n\nDavid Murray was born and raised in New Hamburg, Ontario where his family was in the retail grocery and clothing business. His mother taught piano and was the church organist, while his father enjoyed playing trumpet in the town band.\n\nDavid started taking piano lessons at age 7 and continued until he entered university to study music 10 years later. After two years of study, he realized that he didn’t want a career in music. While working in the restaurant business, he met his future wife, Annamarie, the daughter of dairy farmers near Mitchell, Ontario, who introduced him to the dairy business. Soon after getting married they travelled to Switzerland where they worked and toured in Europe for two years. Upon their return, David enrolled at the University of Guelph where he received his Associate Diploma in Agriculture. In 1986, they joined Annamarie’s parents on the farm and then took over the business in 1996. Recently retired from farming, David volunteered with the Stratford Symphony Orchestra as the Office Manager before being appointed in July 2018 as the SSO’s Administrative Director. He serves on the Board of a local Long Term Care facility and really enjoys working as a collaborative pianist and an accompanist with the Perth County Players."
