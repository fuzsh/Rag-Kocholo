        "text": "A concert by two world class musicians – violinist Bradley Creswick, accompanied by pianist David Murray – is to take place at the Old Low Light Heritage Centre on North Shields Fish Quay in December.\n\nTickets for the concert on Friday 16 December at 7.30pm, at £15pp, can be booked online.\n\nHighlights of the concert will include Beethoven’s Sonata in G major Op.30, and Vaughan Williams’ The Lark Ascending. There will also be a fun piece, a Christmas medley, by David Murray.\n\nBradley Creswick is an internationally acclaimed violinist. He was appointed leader and first violinist of the Royal Northern Sinfonia Orchestra (RNSO) in 1984 and three years later moved to London to lead the Philharmonia Orchestra, still retaining a relationship with the RNSO. He later became leader of the orchestra at the Royal Opera House before returning to the North East and the RNSO in 1994, where over the years he played to packed concert halls and where his rendition of Vaughan Williams’ The Lark Ascending was a highlight for music lovers. He retired from the RNSO in 2019 at the end of the orchestra’s 60th anniversary season and was bestowed the title of Leader Emeritus in honour of his remarkable career with them. He continues to perform across the world although also enjoys performing in the community, including at his local church.\n\nBradley, who lives in Whitley Bay is known for his unique and energetic style and diverse repertoire. He was destined to entertain from an early age having accompanied his father, a circus and fairground performer, who also played the drums and his mother, a jazz singer around venues, including Butlins at Bognor Regis. He started playing the piano aged seven and the clarinet at 12, only later becoming interested in the violin. At the Royal College of Music, he studied both the violin and piano.\n\nDavid Murray, who lives in Monkseaton, has been recognised as one of the North East’s most acclaimed pianists, and is in constant demand as a soloist, accompanist and chamber music partner. He has accompanied top musicians, including Bradley Creswick, in recitals all over the world.\n\nHe is also well known as a choral trainer and conductor and is permanent conductor of Bishopwearmouth Choral Society and Hexham Abbey Festival Chorus.\n\nRecently David has been instrumental in establishing a new chamber music series in Whitley Bay which has proved highly successful, attracting artists of international standing.\n\nThe concert at the Old Low Light marks the return of chamber music events to the centre, which were previously organised by David and his wife Jennifer, former head of woodwind at Newcastle University and an accomplished clarinettist. They are now working on a programme of concerts to take place at the Old Low Light in 2023.\n\nCentre director Guy Moody said: “It is an absolute honour to welcome such world class musicians to the Old Low Light and to re-start chamber music events which during 2020 had to be halted because of the pandemic.\n\n“It is particularly pleasing that these musicians, who have played in concert halls across the world, are very keen to make their music accessible to local people by performing in small community venues like our own.”"
