In 1443 he acquired Fendoch, half of Ardoch and half of Kintoches. In 1445 he founded the Collegiate Church of Tullibardine. In 1446 he obtained Lethendy and Cultrannoch. He held the office of Auditor of the Exchequer in 1448. He held the office of Auditor of the Exchequer in 1450. He held the office of Baillie of the Earldom of Strathearn. He held the office of Keeper of Methven Castle. He lived at Tullibardine, Perthshire, Scotland.\n\nHe married, in or before 1430, Margaret Colquhoun,[2] but in spite of what some authors say, she could not have been the Margaret who was daughter of Sir John Colquhoun of Luss and unknown Boyd.[3] They had at least ten sons and several daughters, including:\n\nSir William, of Tullibardine d. c 1459[2]\n\nAndrew[2]\n\nJohn, of Trewin[2]\n\nRobert[4]\n\nPatrick, of Dollerie and 1st of Ochtertyre d. 1476[4]\n\nJames, of Kelach[4]\n\nWalter[5]\n\nAlexander[5]\n\nThomas[5]\n\nMarion, m. Sir Malcolm Drummond of Cargill[5]\n\nIsabel, m. Maurice Drummond of Concraig[5]\n\nChristian, m. Sir Murdac Menteith of Rusky[5]\n\nHe died between 21 Jul 1451 and 15 Jun 1452. He was buried at Tullibardine Church, Tullibardine, Perthshire, Scotland.[2]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nThere appears to be some confusion regarding the succession and families of Tullibardine. It is clear that Sir Walter Murray was 5th of Tullibardine and his wife was Margaret le Barde, that their Marriage Contract was dated 10th November 1358 and that they had a son referred to as Sir David Murray.\n\nThis David Murray appears to have married Isobel Stewart, daughter of Sir John Stewart of Innermeath and Lorn who survived him. HOWEVER some writers suggest he does not appear to have succeeded his father.\n\nBalfour Paul states that it was Sir David Murray who became 6th of Tullibardine having been served heir to his grandmother Margaret, Lady Tullibardine on 19th May 1432 and she had been dead around 20 years at this time. This Sir David Murray married Margaret Colquhoun around 1430 and they had a large family of at least 10 sons and several daughters. To slightly add to the Confusion, Sir Robert Douglas upon whom Balfour-Paul based his work at pages 52-53 clearly misses Sir David who was married to a Margaret (who may have been a Colquhoun) and then refers to their son Sir William as 7th Baron of Tullibardine and being married to Margaret Colquhoun. As Margaret was the daughter of Sir John Colquhoun of Luss, if her mother-in-law was also a Margaret Colquhoun, she must have been from an earlier generation. See Balfour-Paul Volume 1 pages 454-458\n\nIn addition within the Colquhoun family it is stated that Margaret, daughter of Sir John and his first wife, a Boyd, married William Murray 7th Baron of Tullibardine. See The Chiefs of Colquhoun and their Country Volume 1 page 52.\n\nFraser makes it clear that Margaret married the 7th of Tullibardine but names him 'William' rather than 'David.'[6] Scots Peerage argues against this idea in footnote 9.[2]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Paul, James Balfour. \"The Scots Peerage : founded on Wood's ed. of Sir Robert Douglas's Peerage of Scotland; containing an historical and genealogical account of the nobility of that kingdom\", Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1904, Vol. I, Archive.org, p. 455\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Paul, James Balfour. \"The Scots Peerage : founded on Wood's ed. of Sir Robert Douglas's Peerage of Scotland; containing an historical and genealogical account of the nobility of that kingdom\", Edinburgh: David Douglas, 1904, Vol. I, Archive.org, p. 456\n\n↑ Fraser, Sir William.
