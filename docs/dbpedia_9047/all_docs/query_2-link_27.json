        "text": "THE tenor saxophone has long been a special instrument -an instrument of authority -in black American music. All the members of the saxophone family combine the flexibility of reed instruments and the power and brilliance of brass, but the baritone can be clumsy, the alto creamy and light. The sound of the tenor has weight, body and edge. It can be gruff, blustering or seductively romantic, but it is always richly masculine.\n\nOrnette Coleman noted some 20 years ago that ''The best statements Negroes have made, of what their soul is, have been on tenor saxophones. The tenor's got that thing, that honk, you can get to people with it.'' He could have been thinking of Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Lester Young, Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Albert Ayler or some of the nameless players who made the tenor the principal solo voice in rhythm-and-blues and early rock-and-roll. In the slang of a previous generation, these were ''boss'' tenors; the term is as much a tribute to the tenor's authority as to the primacy of its players.\n\nDavid Murray, who is at Sweet Basil through Saturday, is regarded by many in the music world as the new boss of the tenor. Although he is only 27 years old, his sound is ripely mature. Unlike most younger tenor saxophonists, who seem to have affected the forced, trebly tone associated with the late John Coltrane, Mr. Murray plays with the big-sound swagger of the mainline tenor tradition, which began with Coleman Hawkins and extended through Ben Webster to Sonny Rollins to the rhythm-and-blues honkers to Archie Schepp and Albert Ayler.\n\nWhen Mr. Murray first arrived in New York from his native California, in 1975, at the ripe old age of 20, he sounded something like an Ayler throwback. But he has grown considerably since then. While he still goes in for the overblown whistling and shrieking effects Mr. Ayler perfected, he has rethought these and other avantgarde devices within a more traditional rhythmic context. He swings, and with his huge, burly tone and forceful flow of ideas, he can come on like an improbably agile steamroller.\n\nThe tenor saxophonist who actually seems to have been Mr. Murray's principal inspiration is Paul Gonsalves, whose name has rarely, if ever, been linked with the avant-garde. Mr. Gonslaves was a maverick sylist who usually recorded with either swing-era musicians or beboppers and who churned out bustling, marathon blues solos full of the oddest note choices and most unexpected harmonic departures. He was a featured soloist with the Duke Ellington orchestra for a number of years and rarely recorded under his own name, which may explain his relative obscurity. David Murray often sounds a great deal like him, but Mr. Murray is too ambitious to settle for being anyone's featured soloist. He has been restlessly searching for an ideal group format to frame his own playing since he arrived in New York, and he believes he has found one in the octet he is now leading.\n\nThe David Murray Octet has made two albums for Italy's Black Saint label, which is now distributed in the this country by Polygram. The first, ''Ming,'' was an arresting record when it first appeared, in 1980. But it seems to have been a dress rehearsal for the new album,, ''Home,'' which was released this week to coincide with Mr. Murray's appearance at Sweet Basil.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
