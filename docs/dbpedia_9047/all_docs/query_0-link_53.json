        "text": "By Dee Dee McNeil\n\nAugust 10, 2024\n\nOMER LESHEM – “PLAY SPACE” – Ubuntu Music\n\nOmer Lesham, tenor saxophone; Moshe Elmakias, piano; Nadav Remez, guitar; Elam Friedlander, bass; Ben Silashi, drums.\n\nOn piano, Moshe Elmakias opens Omer Leshem’s album with a musical line that sets the tone and tempo for this production. It’s called “Twilight Hymn” and feels a little Latin at first until Omer Leshem enters on his tenor saxophone. Now the music is definitely Middle Eastern.\n\nWhen I peruse his press info, I discover that he is originally from Herzliya, Israel. That explains the cultural influences I heard on track #1. Leshem brings European harmonies, his classical training, Mediterranean grooves, and lyricism to this project. He also combines shared ethnic roots with his bandmembers. They are all handpicked from the New York area, and they are gifted jazz musicians and Israeli. All nine songs are composed by Omer Leshem.\n\nThis album didn’t happen overnight. After these musicians performed regularly together for several years, Leshem finally decided to record. In summer of 2023, these musicians entered a remote church nestled in a forest outside of Woodstock, New York. That’s where Dreamland Studios is situated. What a wonderful environment to be creative!\n\nAn up-tempo tune called “Take an Advil” inspires the band to step into Straight-ahead jazz and takes off flying. This immediately becomes one of my favorite tunes with solos by his pianist, (Elmakias) exchanging bars with Lesham’s energized saxophone improvisation. They both lay-back and give the stage to Ben Silashi to stun us with his incredible drum talents. Friedlander is walking, or should I say running his bass line beneath this impressive, exciting composition.\n\n“David’s Devastating Journey” is a song that’s somber and beautiful. Elam Friedlander is given several bars to express himself on double bass, in an emotional and tender way.\n\nOn “Cape Town Swag” they incorporate South African music into their presentation. This is another favorite of mine. It moves with purpose, like a posse of wild horses racing across desert sands towards water. Silashi’s drums dominate and inspire. Elmakias uses the 88 keys of his piano to thunder into my listening room with purpose and drive. Then comes Nadav Remez, with his blues guitar. The band cuts time to embrace his awesome solo. When this music ends, this listener feels completely satisfied and inspired.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nELIAS HASLANGER & MIKE SAILORS – “ELIAS HASLANGER MEETS MIKE SAILORS “- Bandstand Presents\n\nElias Haslanger, tenor saxophone/composer/producer; Mike Sailors, trumpet/arranger/producer; Andy Langham & Ross Margitza, piano; Ryan Hagler, bass; Daniel Dufour, drums; Eddy Hobizal, mastering/mixing/piano; Jerry Sailors, co-producer; Charlie Kramsky, studio engineer.\n\nThis is Straight-ahead, powerhouse jazz played just the way I like it. Elias Haslanger and trumpeter Mike Sailors burst onto the scene performing track #1 titled, “One Hand Clap.” That unusual title was inspired by a Herbie Hancock tune titled “One Finger Snap.” This is bebop to the bone, played at an energetic, up-tempo pace.\n\nHaslanger and Sailors are old and close friends who have shared Austin, Texas stages for the past decade. But they’ve been friends for nearly twice as long. The two musicians clearly appreciate the jazz tradition as they interact soulfully with each other. You can feel their camaraderie and hear their smooth connections. These men seem to know each other’s hearts.\n\n“We definitely have something going on. People tell us that all the time. It’s more than the music. The two of us have a similar outlook on life,” Haslanger explains in his press package.\n\nThis recording sounds more like an East Village, live, jazz, jam session in NYC, than a planned recording session. However, it took place far from the East coast. They were comfortable at Estuary Recording Studio in Austin, Texas. Haslanger was born and raised in Austin, while Sailors is a native of Charleston, South Carolina. The trumpeter is a master arranger, not only in the jazz genre but also in the pop music realm. He has worked with Lady Gaga and in the next breath, performed with Jazz at Lincoln Center orchestra.\n\nKenny Dorham and the late, great Clifford Brown have greatly influenced Mike Sailors as an artist. Also, he admires New Orleans legend, Leroy Jones. You can hear that influence when Sailors plays on Haslanger’s tune, “That One Time,” that’s a swinging shuffle blues.\n\nHaslanger too is rooted in the blues and feels a spiritual connection to John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. He was once lead tenor sax man in the Maynard Ferguson Big Band, back when he was a youthful musician in New York. He and Sailors have composed all the music on this album except for the Clifford Jordon tune they covered called “Down Through the Years.”\n\nAn original composition by Haslanger called “History Book” is a swinging, melodic tune. This is followed by Mike Sailor’s original song, “El Marinero.” It’s Latin jazz that dances off my cd player with a burst of joy. The quintet settles down to a smokin’ sultry groove when Haslanger enters on his tenor saxophone. Next comes Andy Langham who takes an extraordinary piano solo.\n\nSailors has also contributed a lovely ballad called, “For Nicole.” Every tune on this album is amazing, both in its presentation and as a well-written composition featuring the talents of Haslanger and Sailors.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nPAUL KENDALL – “MY SHINING HOUR” – Zoho Records\n\nPaul Kendall, baritone saxophone; George Grund, piano; Roy Cumming, bass; Rudy Petschauer, drums.\n\nPaul Kendall and his trio step into the spotlight opening with “You Stepped Out of a Dream” played at an up-tempo swing pace. The first thing I noticed is how Kendall seamlessly ventures into the upper register of his beautiful baritone saxophone while improvising. “Everything Happens to Me” is one of my favorite ballads. Kendall plays it with so much feeling, I can hear the lyrics in my head as he sings his baritone song.\n\nOn the title tune, “My Shining Hour” Rudy Petschauer is featured in a dynamic way on drums. This is bebop at its best. They jump into Clifford Brown’s famed “Joy Spring” feet first, swinging hard. These are old standards, familiar songs, mostly written between 1940 and 1960. That was the bop or bebop era. Those recordings encouraged dance styles that grew from that big-band era, like the Fox Trot, the Cha Cha and of course Swing dancing. Kendall explains on his album cover that these compositions are some of his favorites.\n\nOn this production, Kendall returns to his roots, including his desire to feature his talents on baritone saxophone, instead of his tenor sax. They play “Invitation” in a 6/8 jazz groove that is wonderful. The baritone sax sounds great on this arrangement, except for that one note at the end of the last phrase. It made me wonder, was that an intentional choice?\n\nThe baritone saxophone was Paul Kendall’s first woodwind instrument in High School and continued to be his saxophone of choice as he entered college. However, Kendall soon realized that he could find more work if he added flute, alto and tenor saxophone to his accomplishments.\n\nNot since Pepper Adams made his mark spotlighting the baritone saxophone as a serious frontline instrument in jazz, have I enjoyed an album of someone doing the same in the 21st century. Paul Kendall doesn’t exhibit the speed of Pepper Adams on his instrument, but he puts great emotion and beauty into every song he plays.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nJASON ROBINSON – “ANCESTRAL NUMBERS 1” – Playscape Recordings\n\nJason Robinson, tenor & soprano saxophones/alto flute/composer/arranger; Joshua White, piano; Drew Gress, bass; Ches Smith, drums/glockenspiel; Michael Dessen, trombone.\n\nWoodwind player, Jason Robinson asked the question, “What does ancestry sound like?” The answer to his self-imposed question became this album. The project he calls “Ancestral Numbers 1” is a sound meditation based on his family history and genealogy. His plan is to release two volumes of music reflecting his ancestry in 2024. This is the first volume.\n\n“I’m fascinated by the way that we sonify stories in the jazz tradition. To paraphrase Charlie Parker, if you don’t live an experience, it won’t come out of your horn. So, it felt like a natural turn to take all of the storytelling approaches that I’ve been working on over the years and think about ancestry through that lens,” Jason Robinson explained.\n\nRobinson is a critically acclaimed composer and scholar who has dabbled in popular music, experimental music, electronic music, and jazz. On the very first tune of his latest album release, titled, “Second House” you can hear the various mediums and genres mixed like a musical soup. Robinson lays a funk foundation, like a roux, spicing it up with horn harmonies and Joshua White’s piano echoing a repetitive melodic line. His fingers scurry across the keys with broken arpeggios. Experimental music rises like steam from the pot. Chez Smith is the giant wooden spoon that stirs the pot with his drums.\n\nTrack #2 is titled “Malachi” and tip toes onto the scene, mimicked by the pluck of bass strings. The horns enter, impersonating car alarms outside an open window. Drew Gress uses his bow to coach tones from his double bass and sing his own unique song. The trombone and saxophone have a spirited conversation, while the other instruments lay-out. Robinson takes an extensive solo on his tenor saxophone, exploring the entire range of the instrument. Then, just Robinson and Smith on drums stand alone in the spotlight. Each one spurs the other forward. Robinson’s technique of what I call dribbling the tone is unique. He blows into his horn, tempering the sound with a technique that sounds like a baby blowing spit bubbles from innocent lips.\n\nOn “Potentiality” Robinson steps into Straight-ahead mode. His solo is dynamic and exploratory. I’m not crazy about the repetition he uses in every song, sometimes getting stuck on a cadenza or phrase and repeating the same over and over again. However, on his composition “Potentiality,” he displays more imagination, along with a certain jazzy excitement, climbing chromatically up the scale at the end and coming to an abrupt halt.\n\nJason Robinson offers us life viewed from his musical perspective and meant to represent the persons and personalities in his family tree, those who have genealogically influenced the man and musician he has come to be. This is mostly Avant-garde, experimental music.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nKEN PEPLOWSKI – “LIVE AT MEZZROW” – Cellar Music\n\nKen Peplowski, clarinet/tenor saxophone; Ted Rosenthal, piano; Martin Wind, bass; Willie Jones III, drums.\n\nNearly half a century into his star-studded career, the talented woodwind player, Ken Peplowski has released over seventy recordings as a soloist. Here is another winning album! It was recorded ‘live’ in the small basement NYC jazz establishment called Mezzrow.\n\nThe Mezzrow jazz club is a story unto itself. For years, there was a framed poster-size caricature of Mr. Mezzrow that hung above the club’s Steinway piano, along with a copy of the jazzman’s autobiography. Milton Mezzrow was a woodwind musician from the 1930s until the 1950s, who came from a Jewish family in Chicago, often playing with great musicians like Sidney Bechet. ‘Mezz’ (as he was fondly called) died in 1972. Long before smoking marijuana was acceptable, Mezzrow took a stand on it and was rumored to have sold it at a time when it was unacceptable behavior. He also loved people of color, black culture, music and black art. He married an African American woman (Johnnie Mae) and they had one son. The jazz owner’s true story on all of this is documented in Mezzrow’s extraordinary book called “Really The Blues.” So, that was the setting for this awesome recording by Peplowski.\n\nKen Peplowski’s tone and delivery is captivating. He’s so emotional and satin smooth on his tenor saxophone. For example, his interpretation of “The Shadow of your Smile” performed at a slow tempo, pulls all the beauty out of the tune carefully, like extracting honey from a beehive.\n\nPeplowski takes me back to a time when lyrical jazz was popular and players like Prez and Charlie Parker were all the rage. He is joined by Ted Rosenthal on piano and Martin Wind on bass. Holding the quartet together like a super adhesive is the dynamic Willie Jones III on drums. Willie is featured grandly on their slow shuffle arrangement of “Cabin in the Sky,” as is Martin Wind on his double bass. Ted Rosenthal also takes a noteworthy solo during this arrangement. Peplowski puts down his saxophone and plays his clarinet.\n\n“This is my favorite way to record. I like to work on song material for a year or two, find some interesting tunes that are not so often played, revive some tunes that I haven’t played in years and just go in with friends and record. …play through the music, warts and all, and that’s exactly what we did,” Ken Peplowski explains in his press package.\n\nPeplowski keeps the clarinet on the scene when he interprets Thelonious Monk’s tune “Bright Mississippi.” The quartet swings this one with the players offering magnificent solos. This song sounds a lot like ‘Sweet Georgia Brown’ at a boisterous speed, where Jones can stretch out.\n\nKen Peplowski sooths my soul and inspires my creativity and imagination with his mellow sound and honest, forthright delivery. Every song on this album is magnificently played and beautiful to hear.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nALEX LORE – “MOTIVITY” – Weirdear Records\n\nAlex LoRe, alto & C Melody saxophones/composer; Thomas Morgan, bass; Johnathan Blake, drums.\n\nOn his new album release, Alex LoRe proudly draws a direct line from his chord less trio to his mentor, the late, great Lee Konitz. As the scientist Isaac Newton once quoted, “An object in motion stays in motion” and this, LoRe’s fifth album titled “Motivity” is a clear example of that premise.\n\nOpening with the soft warm sound of LoRe’s saxophone, this trio gives us their arrangement of “I Remember You” with the swinging drums of Johnathan Blake pumping in the background and Thomas Morgan walking his bass briskly beneath the Alex LoRe satin smooth solo. This trio engages me right away. Even though they have taken a path less traveled, their sound is hypnotic and compelling. LoRe unwinds the melody like a colorful ball of yarn. As it rolls across my listening room, I find myself intrigued by this bass, drums and saxophone format.\n\nThey are expanding on a music page borrowed from Lee Konitz and his famous 1961 “Motion” album. As he mentions in his press package, this was a music adventure that greatly influenced Alex LoRe.\n\nAn obvious tribute to Konitz is LoRe’s original composition “Like-Lee” with its challenging melody floating over the rhythm of Blake’s drums, that sometimes pop like sporadic gunfire. He is supported by the always solid basslines of Thomas Morgan. LoRe’s saxophone reminds me of a wild and beautiful bird soaring, dipping and diving above a restless city scene. Blake takes a notable solo during this arrangement, showing off all his technical percussive prowess.\n\nI enjoy the shuffle feel they use to unfold the familiar “Weaver of Dreams” tune, and the tone of LoRe’s saxophone brings an element of comfort and appreciation to my artistic nature. When LoRe and Morgan (on his double bass) have a lengthy conversation, using their instruments as melodic voices, it’s quite creative and counterpoint. Blake uses his drumsticks to glue the entire project together, holding the various moods and rhythms in perfect place, while adding his own unique percussive touches. The interlude that LoRe plays a ‘Cappella called “Intro to Thingin’” is a solo work of art. It introduces us to the Lee Konitz tune, “Thingin’.” Another favorite of mine was their sweet interpretation of ‘Tis Autumn. They close with a speedy rendition of “Overly Sentimental” where LoRe effectively over-dubs his saxophone parts.\n\nThis is a project that had me on the edge of my easy chair, awaiting the next song with bated breath. The honesty, originality and technical brilliance of these three musicians has created a project of beauty and wonder. This music continues their own legacy, with a respectful nod to Lee Konitz.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nLIVIO ALMEIDA – “BRASILIA SESSIONS” – Zoho Records\n\nLivio Almeida, tenor saxophone/composer/arranger; Misael Silvestre, keyboards; Daniel Castro, bass; Pedro Almeida, drums.\n\nThis album starts out like a party. You hear the noise of the crowd, happy voices, with the music fading in like a Hollywood scripted scene. I am swept up in the tenor saxophone energy of Livio Almeida and his wonderful group of musicians as they play “Sambasus.” Daniel Castro offers an impressive bass solo during this samba arrangement.\n\nAlmeida, a Brazilian tenor player, arrived on New York’s jazz scene and quickly put the jazz community on notice with his infectious tone and tenacious attitude on his horn. Soon after, he was hired by the great Arturo O’Farrill and began touring with O’Farrill’s various groups. In fact, Almeida’s 2016 album titled, “Action and Reaction” was produced by O’Farrill and received rave reviews.\n\nThe second tune on this scintillating album is titled “Partido Cerrado” and it has an infectious melody. It’s another Almeida composition that swings hard, this time giving Misael Silvestre, on keyboards, an opportunity to showcase his exceptional talent. But it’s always Livio Almeida who carries the power and excitement of this group. It blows from the bell of his horn relentlessly, like a Brazilian hurricane.\n\n“Brasilia Afro Samba” is named for the city where Almeida was born and raised. Brasilia is the Federal Capital of Brazil. This original composition builds on a strong bass groove and an Afro-Samba beat that pushes the music forward. The group actually recorded this project in Almeida’s hometown of Brasilia. All the first three songs show the strength and beauty of Almeida’s composer skills.\n\n“I wanted the melodic intricacies to emulate Brasilia’s architecture,” Livo Almeida explained the inspiration for writing this samba.\n\n“Folhas Secas” (dry leaves) is a beautiful ballad that spotlights the exquisite sound of Almeida’s tenor saxophone. He plays with grand emotion. I’ve heard Elis Regina sing this popular song, but Almeida’s instrumental rendition is wonderful too. It brings new appreciation to this Nelson Cavaquinho composition.\n\nEvery song on this album is a sparkling gem. These musicians pull all the colors from their instruments, from ruby reds to emerald greens, citrine yellow to turquoise blue. This is a rainbow of musical brilliance that showcases Livio Almeida’s colorful compositions, his brilliance on tenor saxophone, and his virtuosity in arranging.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nJEFF COFFIN – “ONLY THE HORIZON” – Ear Up Records\n\nJeff Coffin, soprano, tenor and baritone saxophones/electro sax/bass flute/C flute/bass clarinet/melodica/tambourine/chant vocals; Daru Jones, Nate Smith & Carter Beauford, drums; Stefan Lessard, electric bass; Victor Wooten, Jay White & Tony Hall, bass; Leo Genovese, Fender Rhodes; Béla Fleck, banjo; Nir Felder, guitar; Keb Mo, resonator guitar; Buddy Strong, fender bass; Victor Krauss, upright bass; Ryoko Suzuki, harmonium; Mars Williams, tenor saxophone; Bill Evans, soprano saxophone; Ray Mason, trombone; Rashawn Ross, Emmanuel Echem & Rod McGaha, trumpet; Ibrahima “Ibro” Dloubate, kinkini, dundun, samban & djembe; R.A.P. Ferreira, spoken word vocals/lyrics; CHANT VOCALS: Jeff Coffin, Roy Wooten, Buddy Strong; YELL ENSEMBLE: Ibrahima ‘ibro Dioubate, Mohammed ‘Fassa’ Dioubate, Sory Diabate, Agathe Moubembe, Mohammed ‘Dho’ Cisse. Shay Rollerson, Corinthian Doctor, & Chelsea Nona Green, vocals/handclaps; Gracie Gadsen, Rosa Murray, Joseph Murray, vocals; Quentin E. Baxter, vocals/big drum/tambourine/ washboard/handclaps.\n\nMulti-talented Jeff Coffin, former Dave Matthew Band member and woodwind player, composer, and educator, offers this collection of original compositions that redefine genre categories. Starting with a funky tune he calls “Here We Go,” you can hear how Coffin blends contemporary jazz grooves with African Rhythms and R&B. The players are allowed their freedom to improvise widely and that puts the jazz into these arrangements. I found this particular arrangement overplayed the catchy, happy melody line, repeating it for nearly eight minutes, while featuring the power drums of Daru Jones and the pumping bass of Victor Wooten. Leo Genovese adds piano licks to the arrangement, while the horns punch in all the right places, repetitiously churning out the melody. There is a hint of Stevie Wonder influence in this arrangement.\n\nOn the next tune, “Yesterday’s Dream,” I realize that this repetitious groove-thing is Coffin’s style. He makes sure to drill the melody into our subconscious. Long after I stop listening to this album, I still hear his melodies bouncing around in my brain. That’s the sign of a very strong songwriter. In the background of Track #2 a voice asks periodically, “Are you there?” It’s catchy and typical of the era of cell phone usage, where I often find myself asking that very question.\n\n“Pharoah Rise” features spoken word lyricist, R.A.P. Ferreira, with the horns repeating a melody my mind clings to like life itself. A flute improvises wildly in the background, and a soprano saxophone, then a bass flute, all played by Jeff Coffin. Occasionally, Ezra Kessler adds an African Bell, that blends with the percussion and carries us away to another continent, another time, another place. Add to this production, vocal chants, and the effect is culturally affective. On a composition Coffin calls “A Hat for My Beard” Bela Fleck gets all my attention when he plays his banjo. On this arrangement you will enjoy Jeff Coffin exploring his baritone saxophone, his tenor sax, flute and bass flute. The man is a woodwind master. A song called “Picking Pockets” features African percussion and Carter Beauford on drums. This is followed by Coffin’s composition, “Yeli Geechee” with guest guitarist, Grammy Winner, Keb Mo performing on resonator guitar. A chorus of voices join in, whisk me off to a Louisiana plantation, lush with tropical plants, thick with history and blood at the roots. A group of Gullah Geechee musicians join Coffin’s musical journey and take us into the depths of black music. Coffin’s saxophone cries soulfully, from the belly of the blues.\n\nThere is nothing boring about this album of music. It is full of musical surprises and excitement. It’s danceable, artistic, Hip-Hop influenced, funky and jazzy in the same breath and quite unpredictable. One thing for sure, you will be thoroughly entertained!\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nGEOF BRADFIELD – “COLOSSAL ABUNDANCE” – Calligram Records\n\nGeof Bradfield, tenor saxophone/bass clarinet/mbira/composer/arranger; Greg Ward, alto saxophone; Anna Webber, tenor saxophone/flute/bass flute; Ben Goldberg, clarinet/contra alto clarinet; Derrick Gardner & Russ Johnson, trumpets; Norman Palm, trombone; Momo Hasselbring Seko, French horn; Scott Hesse, guitar; Clark Sommers, bass; Dana Hall, drums/cymbals/ percussion; Gregory Beyer, berimbau/mbira/marimba/percussion.\n\nThis is the tenth album release from record label founder and woodwind player, Geof Bradfield. This time, he leads a 12-piece ensemble. They interpret his original compositions, as well as music by John Coltrane, Wayne Shorter, Henry Threadgill and Jaki Byard.\n\n“Twelve is a magic number. Mathematically it’s the smallest colossally abundant number, meaning it has an unusually large number of divisors. Musically, that translates here into combinations of the 12 pulses of African rhythmic cycles, the 12 pitches of the Western chromatic scale, and my 12 musicians,” Geof Bradfield shares his numerical inspiration for this project.\n\nDuring a visit to Zimbabwe in 2008, Bradfield was introduced to the mystical Shona Mbira music, a music that’s over a thousand years old. It was developed by the Shona people in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Mbira is both a music and an instrument. It holds great cultural significance in African societies. They believe Mbira is a link between human beings and the spiritual world. It’s a music used in African rituals and ceremonies. Circular in form, like the earth itself, Mbira has the goal of drawing musicians and listeners into a state of meditation. Some believe this music contains healing properties for mind, body and spirit. On a 2015 release, Geof Bradfield’s Quintet recorded “Mbira Song.” So. this is a music he has been studying and perfecting for a number of years.\n\nWith that historic context in mind, it’s easy to imagine why a musician and woodwind master would want to learn to play the Mbira instrument. Consequently, Bradfield studied the Mbira instrument, and with Mbira masters in the United States, as well as in rural Mhondoro, Zimbabwe. His goal was incorporating this African music and instrument into his projects.\n\nBradfield opens his current album (Colossal Abundance) playing Mbira with percussionist, Gregory Beyer playing berimbau on a traditional Shona Mbira song called “Mahororo.” This opening song morphs smoothly into the John Coltrane tune, “Lonnie’s Lament.” On the Coltrane standard, Bradfield picks up his tenor saxophone and plays with heart and soul. He has handpicked his fellow musicians. One that remains consistent in his recording sessions and groups is drummer Dana Hall. They have often played together as a duo, as well as in large ensembles like this one.\n\nAlways incorporating African music into his own arrangements, and very often playing the Mbira himself, Bradfield’s tune called “Tuku” clearly embraces the unique sound of the Mbira. This song was written for Zimbabwean legend, Oliver Mtukudzi, who Bradfield performed with on his first trip to Zimbabwe. The rhythms in this “Tuku” tune recall African jazz legend Abdullah Ibrahim and Bradfield’s mentor, Randy Weston. The trumpet solo on this tune is powerful and Dana Hall is grandly featured on drums, with the horn section punching harmonically throughout. One thing about Bradfield’s arranging, he changes moods like bowties. His compositions remind me of musical suites, rather than singular songs.\n\n“Kaleidoscope” becomes another pulsating, original composition by Bradfield with the Mbira reminding me of a kalimba instrument. After the energy-driven introduction, the arrangement settles down to a very bluesy tune, but soon displays shifting time signatures. Multi-instrumentalist, Geof Bradfield is fluid and brilliant on bass clarinet. Anna Webber is awesome on the flute, with stunning technique and imaginative skills. The background horns mirror the Mbira melody, moving like a whirlpool in the distance. Another favorite is “Requiem’ with its beautiful chord changes and impressive solos.\n\nThis is an album culturally rich and full of uniqueness, imagination and spirituality. Geof Bradfield’s dream of incorporating African Mbira music into his productions has become a reality.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMICHAEL DEASE – “GROVE’S GROOVE” – Le Coq Records\n\nMichael Dease, baritone saxophone/composer/arranger; Bill Cunliffe, piano; Rodney Whitaker, bass; Ulysses Owens Jr., drums; Jocelyn Gould, guitar/vocals/arranger; Alex Acuna, percussion; Terell Stafford, trumpet; Steve Davis, trombone/composer/arranger.\n\nThe title tune, “Grove’s Groove” opens this album with bluster and bravado. The soulful way that Michael Dease plays his baritone saxophone is intoxicating. This tune is rooted in the blues and the horn harmonies introduce us to the melody over a tight groove that the rhythm section lays down. With Bill Cunliffe on piano, Rodney Whitaker on bass, and locking chops with Ulysses Owens Jr., on drums, you have a magnificent rhythm section at work. Dease rumbles his way into the spotlight, playing his baritone sax like his life depends on it. The iconic Terell Stafford takes a trumpet solo that continues the magic and sooths the spirit. Rodney Whitaker lets the listener know that he’s on the scene, fingers dancing across the strings of his double bass with innovation. Steve Davis has both composed and arranged this title tune. This composition originally came out on Criss Cross Jazz label with another all-star band. The difference in this presentation, for the tune and for Michael Dease, is that he’s playing baritone sax and not the trombone.\n\nJocelyn Gould arranged the familiar “Tea for Two” tune, singing the lead vocal, playing the guitar and adding the opening verse for good measure. The band shuffles along, once again featuring the smooth, sexy sound of the Dease baritone saxophone. Gould takes a guitar solo followed by the trombone solo of Steve Davis. This is a tune everybody wants a piece of, so in jumps Terell Stafford, using the plunger on his trumpet. Bill Cunliffe has a playful light-heartedness to his piano solo. Whitaker is always solid and creative on his bass improvisations and then Jocelyn Gould is back with her lovely vocals. She swings us right out of the tune.\n\nGreat percussionist, Alex Acuna joins the group on “Seiko Time” composed and arranged by Michael Dease. This is a wonderful, melodic, Straight-ahead arrangement that features the awesome baritone sax of Dease as the main character on stage. There is nothing I love more than a well-played baritone saxophone and Michael Dease is a master on his instrument. Steve Davis is also an exciting addition to the mix during his innovative trombone solo.\n\nThis is an all-star project with a cast of characters who are individually awesome on their instruments. However, it’s multi-instrumentalist Michael Dease who is the star of this show.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nBy Dee Dee McNeil\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nHYESEON HONG JAZZ ORCHESTRA – “THINGS WILL PASS” – Pacific Coast Jazz\n\nHyeseon Hong, composer/conductor/arranger/percussion; RHYTHM: Broc Hempel, piano; Matt Panayides, guitar/percussion; Evan Gregor, bass; Jeff Davis, drums; Aubrey Johnson & Lauren Lee, vocals; WOODWINDS: Ben Kono, soprano & alto saxophone/flute/wooden flute; Alejandro Aviles, alto saxophone/flute; Rich Perry, tenor saxophone; Quinsin Nachoff, tenor sax/clarinet; Andrew Hadro, baritone sax/bass clarinet. TRUMPET/FLUGELHORN: John Lake, David Smith, Colin Brigstocke, & Jonathan Saraga. TROMBONES: Mike Fahle, Daiel Linden, Nick Grinder & Becca Patterson.\n\nHyeseon Hong was one of the first Korean jazz composers to transplant herself from Seoul, Korea to the New York City jazz scene. She made quite a splash, swimming through the challenges that musicians face in the crowded jazz community of NYC. Not only was she a composer, bandleader, and arranger, she was a female who formed and was leading her own orchestra. At the turn of the century, Hyeseon Hong’s Jazz Orchestra was performing at several now defunct clubs popular in the East Village at that time. In spite of being female, she was making a big name for herself. Ms. Hong presented an unusual approach to merging Korean culture with American jazz, using her large ensemble to perform her original compositions. Audiences were mesmerized by Hong’s talents. Her prior album released before this one was titled, “EE-YA-GI” and was highly praised.\n\nOn her latest album, “Things Will Pass” they open with “Road to Hana.” A strong bassline carries us into the groove, with a backbeat that grabs at the ear and won’t let go. David Smith is featured on trumpet, making a brilliant statement during his solo. “Memoirs of Ladies” comes next and is stuffed with Asian culture from the first strains of the Jeff Davis mallets hitting the drums and the horns harmonizing their way down the scale to introduce a sweet flute solo. I am transported to Korea musically. When Rich Perry steps stage center on tenor saxophone, his solo incorporates a strong jazz presence.\n\n“Raindrops Journey” is beauty and drama rolled into a tight orchestral ball. Pianist Broc Hempel is featured, and John McMahon adds a human whistle at the top of the tune that sets the scene. I have the feeling of being outside, walking briskly towards my destination before the rain starts. Hong adds background voices to the mix, and they add mystery and intrigue to the melodic piece.\n\n“Run Away” features Aubrey Johnson on vocals. She sings in a vocalese way, interpreting Hong’s challenging and beautiful melody with ease. The funky drive of the horns and rhythm section make the piece quite contemporary. The guitar of Matt Panayides steals the attention with his captivating solo.\n\nHer compositions continue. “Waltzing With Dad” is warm and wonderful, with a melody that is full of comfort and begs to have lyrics. David Smith takes a solo on flugelhorn that is hypnotic. The strings in the background add both beauty and substance to the arrangement.\n\n“Treasure Hunt” uses staccato horn lines to increase the tension in Hong’s arrangement. The trombone sings a song both melodic and interesting. The staccato horn lines continue to buoy the piece upward, as Ben Kono’s soprano saxophone soars, and the piano of Broc Hempel uses chords that punch the excitement higher. I find the compositions of Hyeseon Hong to be exquisitely arranged. They pull the best out of her musicians, while telling their stories of love, life and intrigue.\n\nHong is quite imaginative. For example, her compositions titled “Night Climbing” and another called “Dance with Dracula” have titles that provoke attention. “Night Climbing” did not disappoint with its haunting melody and modulating chord changes. The solo piano is quite stark and effective at the end.\n\nThis is the best album I’ve heard by the Hyeseon Hong Jazz Orchestra. From the very first tune to the last one called, “We Will Meet Again” you will be thoroughly entertained.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nEYAL VILNER BIG BAND – “SWINGIN’ UPTOWN” – Independent label\n\nEyal Vilner, alto saxophone/clarinet/flute/conductor/arranger/composer; Jon Thomas & Jordan Piper, piano; Ian Hutchison, bass; Eran Fink, drums; Imani Rousselle, vocals; WOODWINDS: Bill Tod & Jordan Pettay, alto saxophone; Julieta Eugenio, Michael Hashim & Evan Arntzen, tenor saxophone; Josh Lee & Eden Bareket, baritone saxophone. TRUMPETS: John Lake, Brandon Lee, Bryan Davis, Michael Sailors & James Zollar. TROMBONES: Robert Edwards, Mariel Bildsten & Ron Wilkins, (bass trombone).\n\nEyal Vilner is obsessed with big bands that were prominent and popular during the years when jitterbug dance halls thrived. On this project, he reaches back to those 1920 to 1940-days when big band music was all the rage.\n\n“I see the Lindy hop and Vernacular Jazz Dance as an important part of the roots of jazz. When I started exploring and learning these dances, it felt like it completed the picture for me and gave me a deeper understanding of the music, its tradition and history, and of the community from which it came,” Vilner explains his great appreciation of big band dance music.\n\nThe title tune, “Swingin’ Uptown” races across my listening room with speed and energy. This is the Vilner Big Band’s seventh album. His band has performed all over the world for the past fifteen years. This band is smokin’ hot and comfortable as a group that knows the leader and its members more like a family than a job.\n\nThe addition of Imani Rousselle’s soulful lead vocals on “Tell Me Pretty Baby” adds a taste of the blues to the project. I can just picture a dancehall full of dancers squeezed up against each other like paper and glue.\n\n“Jazz music and jazz dance are inseparable. They grew together, influenced and inspired each other. Appreciating and immersing myself in this part of Black American culture has given me a deeper understanding of the music I fell in love with as a teenager,” Vilner writes in his press package.\n\nVilner has added six original compositions, penned especially for this album. They blend in perfectly with tunes that Billy Eckstein made popular, or standards like “Blue Skies” that Irving Berlin contributed to the great American songbook and Louie Jordan’s “Is You Is or Is you Ain’t My Baby.” Vilner’s tunes like “Bumpy Tour Bus” and the title tune sound just like music from the era he loves. His tunes add a fresh, contemporary perspective to a historic and beautiful time when jazz big bands were thriving.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nKIKI VALERA – “VACILÓN SANTIAGUERO” – Circle 9 Music\n\nKiki Valera, cuatro Cubano/guitar/bass/clave/maracas/coros; Pedro Vargas, congas/bongos/coros; Steve Guasch, coros; Carlos Cascante, Joshuah de Jesus, Raquel Zozaya & Francisco ‘Coco’ Freeman, lead vocals. SPECIAL GUESTS: Alexis Baro, Michael Rodriguez, Jonathan Powell¸ Pete Nater, Dennis Hernandez, Brian Lynch, Thomas Marriott, Leon Q Allen & Steve Mostovoy, trumpets.\n\nKiki Valera has a small band with a big, joyful sound. They open his recent release with a tune called “Este Vacilón.” This is boisterous, jubilant music. As seen on the accompanying videos, people are inspired to dance. Carlos Cascante has a strong, confident voice that matches the energy and excitement of the Valera band. “El Aji de Cocina” reflects the same intensity as their opening tune. This time, Francisco ‘Coco” Freeman performs the emotional lead vocals with gusto. Once again, the music inspires hips to swivel and feet to move.\n\nKiki Valera is steeped in musical history, strong as Cuban coffee and just as delicious. He has spent many distinguished years as director of La Familia Valera Miranda in Santiago de Cuba. This is a century-old group and one of the most important purveyors of the Son Cubano. This album is his second US solo release.\n\nOn track #3, “Sobre una Tumba una Rumba” they slow the tempo, but the rhythms still encourage fingers to snap and feet to tap. Track #7 is a surprising tribute to “Mari-Juana.” Much the way R&B icon, Rick James sang about Mary Jane.\n\nThis is an album full of spice and the celebration of life. You don’t have to understand the Spanish lyrics to enjoy the spirit wrapped up in the music of Kiki Valera. I’m glad to hear him share his infectious music, crossing borders with high energy and elation. Kiki Valera and his band offer music that elevates the spirit and puts a smile on your face.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nROB PARTON’S ENSEMBLE 9+ – RELENTLESS – Calligram Records\n\nRob Parton, lead trumpet/composer; Fred Sanders & August Knobbs, piano; Lynn Seaton & Guillermo Lopez, bass; Quincy Davis, Steve Barnes, & Jordan Proffer, drums; Jose Aponte, percussion; Rosana Eckert, vocals; Tony Baker, trombone; D.J. Rice, trombone/composer; Rodney Booth & Chris Van Leeuwen, trumpets; Mike Smith, alto, tenor & baritone saxophones; Rylan Villareal, baritone saxophone; Shelley Carrol, tenor saxophone; Brad Leali, alto saxophone.\n\nThe nine-piece big band that Rob Parton leads, sounds a lot larger. The horn parts blow the roof off my listening space when they barrel from my CD player. They play with grit and gusto. Rob Parton has been a staple of the Chicago, Illinois music scene for generations. He’s equally at home playing in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra or backing up famed artists like Natalie Cole and Tony Bennett. Not only is he the bandleader of this exciting nine-piece ensemble, he also heads his own JAZZTECH Big Band. They have recorded eleven albums since 1984. In 2019, Parton left the Midwest and relocated to North Texas on staff as part of the University. That University is renowned for turning out a host of excellence from their music department.\n\nRob Parton is currently mentoring the next generation of trumpet players. He directs the UNT Two O-Clock Lab Band. It wasn’t long before he had tapped into a talent pool consisting of his colleagues and some top-players in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. That’s how this “Relentless” project came to be the latest album release by Rob Parton and his Ensemble 9+.\n\nTheir first tune is titled “Open for Business” and the drummer, Quincy Davis, rolls the tune out making a red-carpet entrance. The energy never stops from that moment on. One of the four brilliant saxophonists takes the solo lead. Rob Parton enters on lead trumpet and pulls the energy forward. This is a great tune by D.J. Rice to begin their awesome album. Fred Sanders makes an impressive musical statement on piano during an energized solo. The Ensemble 9+ puts a Latin spin on “Straight Life,” a Freddie Hubbard tune arranged by Richard DeRosa.\n\nLynn Seaton opens Billy Strayhorn’s tune “Intimacy of the Blues” on the double bass. It’s a very effective way to grab the listener’s attention. When Sanders steps through the musical curtains to solo on piano, he puts a capital B in the blues. The horns massage their way into the tune, first singing unison with a happy-go-lucky melodic line. Then bursting into harmony in a crescendo of energy just before the saxophone solos start. The saxophone solo knocked me out!\n\nThey have chosen a repertoire that includes compositions by Dizzy Gillespie and Wayne Shorter, but Rob Parton has included two of his own songs. One is “Thank You Colby” that features Guillermo Lopez on acoustic bass and Jordan Proffer on drums. Mike Smith is featured saxophonist on this selection and Rob Parton plays all the trumpet harmonics during this arrangement, as well as lead trumpet. The other original Rob Parton tune is titled, “No Response” and it’s a swinger. The band takes this Straight-ahead arrangement on at high speed. They close the album out with the same energy that they opened it with; the burners are all on high!\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nDAVID LIEBMAN & THE CNY JAZZ ORCHESTRA – “IF A WHITE HORSE FROM JERUSALEM …” – CNY Jazz Central\n\nBret Zvacek, Musical Director/composer/arranger; Rick Montalbano, piano; Spencer Phillips, bass; Larry Luttinger, drums. WOODWINDS: Charles Pillow, alto & soprano saxophone/clarinet; Mike Dubaniewicz & John Jeanneret, tenor saxophone/clarinet; Frank Grosso, baritone saxophone/bass clarinet. TRUMPETS/FLUGELHORNS: Eddie Severn, Scott Harrell, Rob Robson, & Paul Merrill. TROMBONES: Bill Palange, Greg McCrea, Angelo Candela, & Mark Anderson. SPECIAL GUEST: David Liebman, soprano saxophone\n\nThis project has been in the works for several years. The suite, “If A White Horse from Jerusalem” featuring David Liebman and composed by Bret Zvacek world-premiered on April 16, 2011. It celebrated the orchestra’s fifteenth Anniversary season. After that concert, Mr. Liebman suggested they record the piece. All these years later, that suggestion has come to fruition with the help of various funding sources. Additional compositions are included, composed and arranged by members of the CNYJO, a composers’ orchestra. You will enjoy this commissioned, multi-movement, long-form piece composed for a woodwind soloist and jazz orchestra. The compositions embrace both Jewish and Arabic traditions and culture. The arrangements draw from historic and modern music.\n\nThis work is written in four movements and gave soloist and NEA master, David Liebman, free rein to improvise. The title comes from Ada Aharoni, an Israeli poet, playwright and lecturer born in Cairo, Egypt. “If a White Horse from Jerusalem” is a unique project that draws on modern big band traditions to explore the various cultures of the Middle East.\n\nFor example, the First Movement identifies closely with the Klezmer music tradition. They open with minor scales dominating on a tune called, “Ahava Raba” The horns blare and announce this piece with boisterous enthusiasm, as if announcing the King’s Court. Then David Liebman appears on his soprano saxophone to sing us the melody. His horn invites us inside this well-written piece of music. A clarinet brings a little bit of dissonance to the party, later smoothing out and serving as the Jewish sound identity of this work. Every now and then there is the punch of horns. On the whole, this is big band horn beauty at its best.\n\nThe bass of Spencer Phillips walks with gusto, locking the rhythm in place with Larry Luttinger’s dynamo drums. This arrangement draws the listener into this beautifully produced piece of music like a rip tide. Movement II is titled “Allahu Allahu/Magam Awj Ara” and uses Arabic scales, commonly known as Maqams to solidify this movement. The band uses altered intervals and different tonal levels to express parts of this suite. Movement II is meant to recall the companion of the Prophet Muhammad, whose name was Razi Allahu Anhu, and the impact both Prophet Muhammad and Razi Allahu Anhu had during that part of history.\n\nSo now, after listening to both types of music, that reflects two different cultures, the final movement mirrors living and growing in the same part of the world, together. This music endeavors to unify the two cultures. I have to say, Movement III sounds a little conflicted and made my spirit nervous. Perhaps because it was musically based on music written in opposing tonalities. In other words, it made alternate musical statements at the same time. That resulted in dissonance, with loudly played horn lines that sometimes seemed to be fighting each other.\n\nThey end this movement with the clarinet stating the Jewish view and the tenor saxophonist representing the Arab opinion. The composer and arranger hope these two soloists show common ground and understanding between the two during this arrangement.\n\nAdditional songs added are familiar to the ear, like the Bernstein/Sondheim composition, “Somewhere” and the “Rogers & Hart tune “Where or When.” They also add Lou Marini’s composition “Starmaker” and John Jeanneret’s “Hip Hop Scuffle.”\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nPLANET D NONET – “ECHOES OF HARLEM” – Eastlawn Records\n\nRJ Spangler, co-producer/congas/small percussion/bandleader; Sean Perlmutter, drums/cowbell; Trevor Lamb, string bass; Michael Zaporski, piano; Goode Wyche III, baritone & alto saxophones; Christopher Tabaczynski, tenor saxophone/clarinet; Alex Colista, alto saxophone/clarinet; John ‘Tbone’ Paxton, trombone/vocals; Charlie Miller, trumpet/flugelhorn; James O’Donnell, trumpet/flugelhorn/vocals/maracas/co-bandleader. SPECIAL GUESTS: Camille Price, vocals; Kurt Krahnke, string bass.\n\nThis is a follow-up album to Planet D Nonet’s very successful release last year of Blues to Be There: A Salute to Duke Ellington. They continue their tribute to Duke with this “Echoes of Harlem” a Volume 2 release. They open with the Ellington composition, “Happy Anatomy” arranged as a spunky, joyful swing number featuring Charlie Miller on trumpet and Christopher Tabaczynski on tenor saxophone.\n\nPlanet D Nonet is a group of Detroit’s top players, unified under the umbrella of their love for Duke Ellington and the music of his popular era. They bring back African American music from the 1920’s through the 1940s when big bands were all the rage. Co-founder and bandleader, RJ Spangler founded the nine-piece ensemble with longtime musical comrade, James O’Donnell, in 2007. Their idea was to use a smaller version of the traditional big bands to inspire interest in music from that era.\n\nTrack #2, “Flirtibird” slows the pace down and the blues enters the picture. This time Alex Colista solos on his alto saxophone, but Michael Zaporski’s piano parts are important to the groove and add an 88-key touch of the blues to their arrangement. On the familiar “Rocks in My Bed” tune, special guest, Camille Price is featured on vocals. The band plays the original Ellington arrangement procured from the Smithsonian thanks to Andrew Homzy.\n\nTheir spirited rendition of “Caravan” is filmed on someone’s front porch, where the band sounds great, but the vocals are better on the recording than ‘live.’ John ‘T-Bone’ Paxton sounds quite good vocally on the recorded version of this popular Ellington tune.\n\nOn “Juniflip” I loved the background horn harmonies, sweet as strings and very supportive of the soloists including a swinging fluegelhorn performance by Charlie Miller and a smooth, Straight-ahead alto sax solo from Alex Colista. Then Goode Wyche III, enters on baritone saxophone to show us how a ‘Bari’ can swing. All the while Zaporski is pumping the rhythm section up on the piano and also takes an energetic solo, with Trevor Lamb walking his bass diligently underneath the groove. When Lamb steps into the spotlight, I am impressed by his spontaneity and improvised solo. The bassist has also arranged “La Belle Plus Africaine” for the ensemble, inviting Colista’s clarinet to take center stage, with Lamb using his bow to pull beauty from the strings of his double bass. The drums of Sean Pearlmutter punch this tune ahead with dynamics, driving the Afro-Cuban beat underneath the harmonics. I enjoyed the expression of Goode Wyche III on his baritone saxophone.\n\nBandleader RJ Spangler and Planet D Nonet bring back Old School music from the big band era with their energy-driven, Detroit-based band. I found this new album’s arrangements to be a lot more modern than the former releases and quite enjoyable. Every cut brought back the historic significance of music well-written by Ellington, and well-performed by Planet D Nonet in their own unique way.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nBRUNO RABERG TENTET – “EVOLVER” – Orbis Music Records\n\nBruno Raberg, acoustic bass/composer; Gen Yoshimura, drums; Anastassiya Petrova, piano/B3 organ; Nate Radley, guitar; Charlotte Lang, bass clarinet; Randy Pingrey, trombone; Peter Kenagy, trumpet/flugelhorn; Stephen Byth, tenor saxophone/clarinet; Allan Chase, soprano, alto & baritone saxophones; Fernando Brandao, flute/alto & bass flutes. SPECIAL GUESTS: Kris Davis, piano; Walter Smith III, tenor saxophone.\n\nThe first tune, “Peripeteia” means a sudden reversal of fortune or change of circumstances. It’s very much smooth jazz with a laid-back arrangement full of many horn ensemble harmonics. Track #2 engages me right away with the bass line of Raberg gaining my full attention. This composition by Raberg is titled, “Mode Natakapriya” and highlights Peter Kenagy’s muted trumpet in a beautiful way.\n\n“My studies of traditional Indian music have influenced my writing in many ways, some more obvious than others. Natakapriya is the tenth mode in the Carnatic Melakarta system, that has 72-basic-mother-scales. The melodic and harmonic material in this piece is based on these pitches, C-D flat-E flat-F – G – A – B flat – Cm,” Raberg explains how he composed this tune.\n\nRaberg shows off his world-traveler attributes with some of the titles of these tunes. “Peripeteia” comes from Greek mythology. “Mode Natakapriya” is very East Indian based. “Stiltje” means stillness in Swedish and “Erebus” from Greek mythology that means ‘descending into darkness.’\n\nI enjoy Anastassiya Petrova’s piano introduction on the tune “Sunday.” It’s very beautiful and engaging. Stephen Byth enters to solo on his tenor saxophone, followed by a very pretty flute solo by Fernando Brandao. Enter guitarist Nate Radley to offer his creativity to the mix and he demands all my attention in a beautiful way. The arrangements on this album are very orchestrated and lush. They remind me of a much larger ensemble of musicians and lean towards European classical music. This is easy-listening jazz, with warm, moderate tempos and intimate compositions that are interpreted by enthusiastic musicians. But there is nothing explosive here.\n\n“When I’m writing, I often see the instruments as characters in a play or a movie, talking to each other and interacting in different ways. It helps me to get my imagination going and find a frame for the compositions,” Bruno Raberg explains his composing skills.\n\nBruno Raberg is an internationally renowned bassist and composer. He arrived in America from his native Sweden in 1981 and has released 14 recordings as a bandleader. He currently presents concerts featuring solo bass and leads a trio with Bruce Barth on piano and drummer Matt Wilson. He currently teaches in the prestigious Berklee Global Jazz Institute.\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\nTOBIAS HOFFMANN JAZZ ORCHESTRA –“INNUENDO” – Mons Records\n\nTobias Hoffmann, conductor/composer/producer; RHYTHM SECTION: Vikka Wahl, guitar; Viola Hammer, piano/synthesizer; Ivar Roban Krizic, bass; Reinhold Schmölzer, drums/electronics. SAXOPHONES: Florian Trübsbach & Patrick Dunst, alto & soprano saxophone/flute/clarinet; Robert Unterköfler, tenor & soprano saxophone/flute/clarinet; Martin Harms, tenor saxophone/bass clarinet/flute/clarinet; Jonas Brinckmann, baritone saxophone/bass clarinet. TRUMPETS/FLUGELHORNS: Maximilian Seibert, Sebastian Burneci, Florian Menzel, Gerhard Ornig & Jakob Helling. TROMBONES: Simon Harrer, Daniel Holzleitner, Robert Bachner (trombone & valve trombone) & Johannes Oppel (bass trombone/tuba).\n\nA few years ago, I reviewed an album that featured the Tobias Hoffmann Jazz Orchestra called “Conspiracy.” I was quite impressed with this orchestra’s arrangements and the compositions of Hoffmann. The title track won 3rd prize at the “Bill Conti Big Band Arranging & Composition Competition” of the American Society of Music Arrangers and Composers in Los Angeles, California. I recall loving this orchestra and the black and white video they created with dancers Maureen Bator and Borna Babic.\n\nWhen Tobias Hoffmann reached out to me a few weeks ago, from Austria, to say he had another project being released and asking if I would listen, of course I said yes. Once the package arrived by post, I found the same excitement and creativity in his music, and in the arrangements. Hoffmann has composed all eight songs.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, the orchestra spent a week in Graz, Austria rehearsing Hoffmann’s music. The participants are made up of students, professionals, and music educators. As I listened to the title tune, I was swept away in the mystery and mood changes that infused this piece of music with drama.\n\nIn liner notes, Hoffmann explains that this is a tribute to the rock group “Queen.” Florian Trübsbach is featured on alto saxophone, playing a solo that’s a thing of beauty. This tune earned “Best Composition” honors in the large ensemble category at the 47th Downbeat Student Music Awards. Tobias Hoffmann is still a student himself, studying for his master’s degree in jazz composition and Arrangement with mentor Ed Partyka.\n\nTrack #2 called “Summer Solstice features a trombone solo by Simon Harrer. “No Way Back” is introduced by Viola Hammer with a special repetitive line on piano. The horns echo the line, and time signatures are jumbled around, challenging my finger snaps.\n\n“I find writing music in odd and often unfamiliar meters both exciting and challenging,” says Hoffman.\n\nOn this mixed meter composition, Gerhard Ornig is out-front on trumpet and Viola Hammer executes a pensive, emotional piano solo, slowing the tempo and changing the complexion of the arrangement. They close with “Perseverance” that Hoffman says is the longest composition he has ever written for an orchestra. It spotlights a very jazzy tenor saxophone solo by Robert Unterköfler. On this classically flavored musical excursion, you will uncover the composition talents of conductor, Tobias Hoffman. and the excellence of his talented jazz orchestra members.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nBy Dee Dee McNeil\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nDAVID MURRAY QUARTET – “FRANCESCA” – Intakt Records\n\nDavid Murray, tenor saxophones/bass clarinet/composer/arranger; Marta Sanchez, piano; Luke Stewart, acoustic bass; Russell Carter, drums.\n\nThis David Murray Quartet album was recorded at Hard-studios in Winterhur, Switzerland, following a triumphant European tour. They open with the title tune, “Francesca” that is one of seven original compositions David Murray has penned. Murray’s music shines like a solid gold full moon. It lights the universe. His improvised solo tests the boundaries of his saxophone range. It races around the melodic chord structure boldly. Luke Stewart steps into the spotlight with an appealing acoustic bass solo, followed by Marta Sanchez on piano. Sanchez is a transplant from Madrid, Spain. She spends time in the upper register, pulling a Tinkerbell sounding improvisation from the 88 keys. I can clearly hear the name Francesca echoed in the first two lines of the song’s verse. Murray is as creative and innovative as ever, playing a ‘Capella at the fade of the song with great inventiveness and emotion. This tune celebrates Murray’s love for his wife.\n\nTrack #2 is just as melodic as the first song, propelled by the Russell Carter drums. Titled “Ninno,” Murray gives his quartet players an opportunity to stretch out and explore their own musical horizons. Sanchez chooses the piano’s mid-range this time to improvise with flying fingers. Carter is offered an opportunity to show off his technical trap drum skills and his more creative side. During a blustering solo, he is dynamic and creative. This album displays Murray’s attentiveness to mentoring a new generation of jazz players.\n\nAlthough Murray has lived in New York City for many years, he was born in Oakland, California and attended Pomona College for two years in the class of 1977. He was greatly influenced by Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman, and Archie Shepp. Over time, and paying performance-dues, Murray developed his own specific sound. He’s been going strong for half a century. In 1980, David Murray was named the Village Voice Musician of the Decade. He was gifted with an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Music by Pomona College in 2012.\n\nI fall in love with his composition called “Shenzhen.” I recognize this title as the name of a small city in the province of Guangdong, China. On this tune, Murray plays a bass clarinet. I truly appreciate the deep, rich, tone of his horn and the mallets that Carter uses to stroke the groove from his trap drums. That’s the thing about David Murray. His music is always full of surprises. On a tune called “Come and Go,” Marta Sanchez hits her stride, showing me her improvised style and the freedom that comes from jumping off the cliff without a parashoot. The band plays this song in what sounds like 5/4 cut-time. “Richard’s Tune” is the one ‘cover’ song the quartet plays. It’s a Don Pullen composition and once again, David Murray interprets it on his bass clarinet.\n\n“Am Gone Get Some” is stoked with funk from the first line to the finality of the ending. Luke Stewart’s bass is predominant, even if it’s just walking in the background, it is like a screw peg tightly present to hold the rhythm section in place. He walks steady when Sanchez plays her solo. This is a Straight-ahead swing tune that snatches my attention and won’t let it go.\n\nHere is an album that’s bliss from start to finish. Murray’s compositions are formidable and unforgettable. His quartet is tight, talented and they offer a blend of history, along with a prophetic look into the jazz future.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMATTHEW WHITAKER – “ON THEIR SHOULDERS: AN ORGAN TRIBUTE” – Mocat Records\n\nMatthew Whitaker, organ/aux Keyboards/piano/cymbals/arranger/composer; Marcos Robinson, guitar; Daniel Winshall, electric bass; Johnny Steele, drums; Ivan Llanes Montejo, percussion; David Sneider & Summer Cammargo, trumpet; Ian Munoz, alto saxophone; Griffin Ross & Sergio Tabanico, tenor saxophone; Adam Stein, baritone saxophone; Ilai Mac Aggi, trombone; Antonina Styczen, flute; Kenny Vaughn, vocals. SPECIAL GUEST: New Hope Baptist Church.\n\nThis album brought back many happy memories for me. Matthew Whitaker and his crew make my heart sing. Many a night I sat in Jimmy & Lola Smith’s supper club and enjoyed hearing Jimmy play their opening tune, “The Organ Grinder’s Swing.” Whitaker and his group of excellent musicians start their album swinging hard on this familiar tune!\n\nWhitaker has stunned the music world with his virtuosity on piano, keyboards, organ and even drums. The respected pianist, Jon Batiste, has called him a ‘genius.’ Whitaker’s talent caused him to be added to the lineup of talent on television shows like “60 Minutes” and “The Today Show.” He has been hired to work with iconic names in the music business like Roy Ayers, NEA Jazz Master Regina Carter, and reed giant, James Carter. The surprising thing is that the pianist, composer and arranger is only twenty-three-years-old. As a youth prodigy, he has already been celebrated on television and well-known stages since childhood.\n\nEarly in his career, this Hackensack, New Jersey musician was labeled a gifted prodigy, like Stevie Wonder or Billy Preston. His talents both shocked and entertained people at a very young age. On this soulful seven-track album, Whitaker shows off his skills on Hammond B-3 organ, celebrating a host of organ players he admires. Many have inspired him, like Lonnie Smith, Charles Earland, and Joey DeFrancesco. He plays songs these artists made popular and some that he wrote himself.\n\nMatthew Whitaker penned “Yessaah.” It opens with a strong percussion introduction by Ivan Llanes Montejo. Whitaker has a clear sense of who he is. His rich, full sound is infectious on the organ and in his arrangements. “Pilgrimage” is rooted in gospel and was composed by Lonnie Smith. Whitaker takes us to church on this melodic tune, adding the sweet guitar of Marco Robinson to the mix. He develops the melody with a healthy concentration of blues poured into the arrangement. When Whitaker enters to solo, he brings not only technique, but drama to the piece.\n\nEvery song is a fresh and innovative experience. Track #5 is a Joey DeFrancesco tune called “In the Key of the Universe.” The addition of horns to Whitaker’s arrangements adds fullness to the already rich arrangements. Griffin Ross makes a tenacious statement on tenor saxophone during his solo. On the final tune, Whitaker’s special guest, vocalist Kenny Vaughn joins the production. They close with another original song by Whitaker titled “Don’t Count Me Out.” This music by Matthew Whitaker is bound to make you smile and lift your spirits.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMILES OKAZAKI – “MINIATURE AMERICA” – Cygnus Records\n\nMiles Okazaki, guitars/composer; Patricia Brennan, vibraphone; Matt Mitchell, piano; Caroline Davis, alto saxophone; Anna Webber, tenor saxophone/flute; Jon Irabagon, mezzo soprano/ sopranino/slide saxophone; Jacob Garchik, trombone/bass trombone; Fay Victor, Jen Shyu & Ganavya, voice.\n\nMost of us ‘city dwellers’ live in a world of constant noise. When the first track of this project begins to play, I am reminded of the daily cacophony city life brings to bear. While the Miles Okazaki music is playing, voices murmur underneath like a crowded city street. I stop my CD player and listen. Are those voices coming from outside my listening room? Is that street noise? No – it’s a part of this music. Like when we get up and turn on the Television. It becomes a background of voices we often aren’t even listening to. Instead, the television voices become soft, blabbering companions that make us feel we aren’t alone. I push play and listen to a tune called “The Cocktail Party.” Of course, this would be the way a party sounded with chatter mixed into the music.\n\nThe tracks that follow are brief, like this first one that is only one minute and fifty-seconds in duration. These are snippets of melodies and sound themes. This music feels like a jigsaw puzzle with fragments of puzzle pieces that the listener has to put into place.\n\n“… I realized I could write some instruction pieces to create the raw materials (slabs, as I called them) and then excavate them, sanding and polishing to find hidden musical artifacts,” Okazaki explained in his press package.\n\nThese uncovered treasures have me straining and listening, like an eavesdropper, trying to understand the hidden meaning in each clip of imagination and string of musical conversation.\n\n“…We made dozens of different little episodes. Dense blocks of sound. I took them home and carved away at them until just the minimum remained, learned that, and then played along,” Mile Okazaki described his creative process.\n\nOn Track #6, “And the Deep River” adds vocals to Okazaki’s guitar expressions. Track 10 called “Promise Me” I found quite beautiful and melodic. Okazaki offers us 27 brief pieces of musical ideas, short clips of creativity that seem stolen from a piece of music and stuck, like post-it papers, on the refrigerator door to remind us of a song we never fully heard or explored. This is a different concept. Okazaki has released several other albums with a more structured melodic base like “Thisness” where his guitar takes more time to develop arrangements.\n\nAnother album he calls “Figurations” explores the experimental, but not in the way this new release does.\n\nHere is modern jazz and experimental music. It both challenges and expands my appreciation and my sense of art. Although there were some brilliant musical moments, like the saxophone solo on Track #8, “Open Road,” or the trumpet solo on Track #11 (The Cavern). Track #12 throws me back into a cage of wild animals and frustrated human beings, each adding their voices to a senseless conversation. For the most part, I came away from this project frustrated, like the person who can’t complete the puzzle because they’ve lost a few of the important pieces.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nODED TZUR – “MY PROPHET” – ECM Records\n\nOded Tzur, tenor saxophone/composer; Nitai Hershkovits, piano; Petros Klampanis, double bass; Cyrano Almeida, drums.\n\nA song called “Child You” is the second track and Oded Tzur’s tenor saxophone flies like a busy bumble bee from my stereo system. After his exploratory session of improvisation, Nitai Hershkovits enters to take an exploration of the piano’s 88 keys. Petros Klampanis has a double bass conversation with the piano, as the pianist’s fingers fly and the melody flutters. Cyrano Almeida gets into the act on his trap drums, slapping improvised licks into the mix to let us know he is here. This drummer is a newcomer to Tzur’s ensemble. He grew up in the African-Brazilian Candomblé religion and was exposed to a very musical culture early on. There is a feeling of Middle Eastern culture wrapped like bright paper around this gift of a composition\n\nBorn in Israel in January 5,1984, Tzur has studied jazz and classical music in his high school for the arts and during his time at the Jerusalem Academy. Early on, he was infatuated with East Indian classical music and studied as a disciple of Hariprasad Chaurasia at the Rotterdam World Music Academy. Tzur has mastered what he calls ‘the Middle Path’ on the saxophone. That’s a technique enabling the sax to slide between notes and highlight specific microtones. This is quite different from the traditional way the saxophone is played. It has helped Tzur develop a style and tone clearly his own.\n\nThe young reedman moved to New York in 2011 and established his quartet. Some people have referred to Tzur’s group as the Coltrane Quartet of the 21st Century, because of his spiritual and innovative music. He also displays an innovative approach to playing his saxophone. Although I enjoy and appreciate Tzur’s talents and creativity on his instrument, I cannot yet compare his gifts to that of John Coltrane.\n\nOn a composition called “Through A Land Unknown” Petros Klampanis basks in the spotlight on his double bass during the introduction and his solo. Hershkovitz, the group pianist, showcases his own exploratory solo further into the song. The bass sometimes sounds like a descant underneath Hershkovits’ solo. It’s beautiful.\n\nOn “Renata” Oded Tzur improvises wildly, seeming to reach for some meditative echelon. This listener is swept away during his quiet introduction to a melodic manifesto that grows and blossoms. His tenor saxophone sometimes sounds flute-like. The tension builds, with Hershkovits’ arpeggio piano parts act as a trampoline for the sax to dance upon. The title tune follows, a meditative tune that reflects a pensive, calm, spirituality dripping from Tzur’s tenor saxophone and tinkling from the upper register of the Hershkovitz piano. I can almost see the ballerina twirling on the top of some wooden music box. As he travels his ever-growing wide and wonderful musical path, they close with “Last Bike Ride in Paris.” It’s fused with energy, like those participating in the Paris-Roubaix, a brutal one-day French bicycle race that dates back to 1896. This “My Prophet” project, by Oded Tzur, continues his legacy of exploration and development of his own sound and unique style.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMICHAEL PAGÁN – “PAGANOVA” – Capri Records\n\nMichael Pagán, piano/keyboard/composer/arranger; Louie Pagán, electric & upright bass; Ray Demarchi, drums; Michael Herrera & David Chael, tenor, alto & soprano saxophones.\n\nThe opening tune races off my disc with fire and is appropriately called “Burn it Forward.” It gives the listener a taste of what’s to come, spotlighting the various players in Pagán’s quintet with several solo bars. This arrangement introduces us to their mad creativity during these spurts of improvisation. The two saxophones establish the melody. Then they are joined by the rhythm section where Michael Pagán takes a hot and enthusiastic solo on piano. Each of the saxophone players steps forward, one at a time, to share their own improv skills. I am swept along in their energy and excitement. The bass of Louie Pagán takes a sturdy and solid walk underneath the excitement, acting as the basement for their musical house. When Louie steps stage-center on his electric bass, he is dynamic during his solo excursion. They trade fours with Ray Demarchi on drums and Demarchi does not disappoint. Now we have met the players, each one is obviously a master of their instrument.\n\nA tune called “Guess Who’s Blues” is surprisingly, a very well-written waltz. Michael Pagán has penned five of the eight songs this ensemble offers. Pianist, Pagán has been a respected fixture on the Kansas City jazz scene for the past two decades. He has performed worldwide with a number of notable jazz musicians, as well as at jazz venues playing solo piano, with his own trio, and as bandleader of the Michael Pagán Big Band. This release is with his quintet called ‘Paganova.’ As a composer and arranger, Michael Pagán has written and produced nearly two-hundred works.\n\nOn this project, it’s somewhat of a family affair. Dynamic bassist, Louie Pagán is an independently established composer and producer. He is also Michael’s son and an assistant engineer on this project. Angie Pagán heads their design department.\n\nThe beautiful addition of Kenny Wheeler’s smoky ballad, “Where Do We Go From Here” is interpreted by the two saxophone players. David Chael’s rich tenor solo demands my full attention. When Michael Pagán soaks up the spotlight during his solo, Louie is right there on bass, walking briskly beside him like one of the President’s bodyguards.\n\nThe mood and music changes direction on “Gaviota” (a Clare Fisher tune) as the group embraces a warm, Latin groove. Once again, the unification of spirits during the father and son trading fours on keyboard and bass makes for an exciting arrangement. The title of this song is Spanish for Seagull. The horns fly freely, diving and gliding their way across my listening room with precision in their musicality. Towards the end, Demarchi takes a much-appreciated drum solo. They swing us into a happy-go-lucky, bebop arrangement of Pagán’s tune “Just the Other Day.”\n\nThis is an album of charm, creativity and comfort that invites the listener in, like the arms of a loving grandmother, I feel warm and safe in this musical hug.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nJOHN KAMEEL FARAH & NICK FRASER – “FARAHSER” – Elastic Recordings\n\nJohn Kameel Farah, piano/synthesizer/electronics/composer; Nick Fraser, drums.\n\nAll the music on this release was composed by John Kameel Farah, but it was drummer and Juno Award Winner, Nick Fraser who instigated this duo album project.\n\n“I thought that this might create an interesting tension between the musical worlds at play,” quotes Nick Fraser.\n\nIn a way, the two musician’s careers have paralleled. John Kameel Farah immerses himself in improvisational freedom, deep, idiosyncratic, sound algorithms, mixed with renaissance and Baroque music. One could say, he leans towards the late, romantic era of music with sound designs and electronic harmonies that paint abstract compositions with vibrant color. This Toronto and Berlin-based composer and pianist prides himself in mastering electronic music. He performs regularly across Europe, as well as touring North America. Farah has also appeared in concert on the stages of South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Israel and Palestine. He is just as comfortable playing solo as he is with other musicians.\n\n“I first met Nick in my early twenties, as I was just beginning to improvise publicly on the experimental and free jazz scene in Toronto,” muses John.\n\nFarah was fascinated by Nick Fraser’s ability to go in any percussive direction, no matter how strange. Nick was always surrounded by players who respected that freedom. They were very similar in musical tastes and exploration. Together, these two gifted musicians and free spirits blend their sounds, creativity and dual approach to improvise in exaggerated and exciting ways.\n\nThey begin with the first tune on this album called “Flatland.” The underlying chords are chromatic, but lush with harmony. Farah’s right hand tickles the piano’s upper register sensually. Nick Fraser finds space to enhance the slowly played tune with sensitive brushes and drumsticks, while Farah squeezes the melody to the surface, showing both technical skills and tenacious composer talents. I am drawn into this tune, like someone watching the hypnotist’s swinging pendulum.\n\nWhen the second composition “Twigs” arrives, it is quite different, playing with counterpoint on piano, while Fraser solidly gives the song a heartbeat on his drum kit. There are electronic sounds that pull the piece together in a bundle of unique harmonies. Fraser rumbles his drums like thunder and changes the direction in organic ways. He creates tension and release with his creativity and drumsticks. This music is fascinating and delightful. It’s both experimental and modern, but it’s also entertaining, melodic, and peppered with unexpected musical phrases. While listening, I’m so captivated by what is coming next, I can hardly catch my breath.\n\n“Waltz” is this album’s shortest track. It’s built on a recurring piano figure that fragments and dissolves into lovely phrases of melody that are very classically inspired. Nick Fraser rumbles beneath on drums, as does the added electronics of Farah. Fraser pops and snaps cymbals and when Farah gives attention to a bass line, Nick Fraser solos through the process, stitching his percussion through the piece with his sticks acting like tailor needles. The unexpected breaks in the “Dirge” song add drama and mystery to their arrangement. This duo is explosive and unpredictable, but always with an underlining sense of beauty.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nSARAH HANAHAN – “AMONG GIANTS” – Blue Engine Records\n\nSarah Hanahan, alto saxophone/composer; Marc Cary, piano; Nat Reeves, bass; Jeff “Tain” Watts, drums; Bobby Allende, percussion.\n\nThe John Coltrane composition, “Welcome” based on America’s familiar Happy Birthday tune, is Sarah Hanahan’s opening tune. Her sound is intriguing and brings bebop to the table. Bebop is my most delicious and appreciated dish at any jazz dinner. I’m immediately excited to hear this young lady and her hot band deliver a taste of history with their current, modern music.\n\nSarah says in her press sheet, “… I want to pay my respect to my mentors and to the greats who have come before me, but I also want to show who I am and the voice I have to contribute to this lineage.”\n\nHanahan’s second song is an original composition called “Resonance” that continues her tribute to Coltrane’s legacy. There is just something about her style and improvised technique that recalls the greatness and inspiration of John Coltrane. Sarah Hanahan plays with affirmation and assertiveness. She is obviously gifted. I am swept into the bell of her horn like stardust. Speaking of which, Sarah includes the popular Hoagy Carmichael song “Stardust” in her repertoire. But first, she brings a really swinging rendition of Bacharach’s “A House is not A Home” to the forefront. Hanahan has a beautiful tone, and a youthful excitement is present in her playing. I love her fresh rendition of this pop tune that Dionne Warwick made a hit record and introduced to the world.\n\nSarah Hanahan is a graduate of the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz at the University of Hartford’s Hartt School of Music. When you hear Sarah play, you can tell she worships the music of Coltrane, of Jackie McLean and masters of the bebop era that changed the face of jazz.\n\n“Abraham Burton, Nat Reeves, Steve Davis, and Rene McLean not only taught me how to play and the dedication it takes to be a real musician, but they taught me what music really is about. They taught me what music means and the heaviness every note carries. They stressed the importance of culture, spirituality, and knowing the tradition,” she explains, giving props to the historic past and her sparkling future.\n\nSupported by the power-driven drums of Jeff “Tain” Watts, Hanahan’s original compositions shine. “Nato” is one of them that gives Watts free rein to show off his awesome skills. His solo is mind-bending. Another original that Sarah has penned is a song that whisks me to the shores of some tropical island called “Honey.” Nat Reeves is solid and steady with his walking bass line during Hanahan’s Straight-ahead presentation of “On the Trail.” They close with another Hanahan original called “We Bop!” that features Bobby Allende on percussion. He adds fury and energy to this melodic tune.\n\nSarah Hanahan is a star on the horizon, already hailed by NPRs “Youngbloods” series as having her own voice and place in the spotlight. Just ask the Grammy Award-winning Mingus Big Band (who she has played with) or Dee Dee Bridgewater who she has appeared with. They too will sing her praises. Sarah Hanahan makes me hopeful, happy, and excited about the direction jazz music is traveling, under the assertive, guiding talents of our ever-evolving youth.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nNATION BEAT – “ARCHAIC HUMANS” – Ropeadope Records\n\nScott Kettner, drums/percussion/composer; Paul Carlon, tenor saxophone/arranger/composer; Mark Collins, trumpet; Tom McHugh, trombone; Heather Ewer, sousaphone. SPECIAL GUESTS: Melanie Scholtz, vocals/composer; Christylez Bacon, beatbox/rhymes/spoken word; Luca Texeira, percussion; Michael Spiro, congas/percussion.\n\nScott Kettner is the master percussionist, composer and educator who is the guiding force behind the Nation Beat group. For some time, he has been researching the similarities between the Northeastern culture of Brazil and the American South. Kettner has a background in hybrid drumming, particularly the music of jazz. This project brings all those possibilities to reality.\n\nIn 2018, he and Paul Carlon began composing and collaborating. Carlon is a respected saxophonist. Blending Kettner’s drum skills and Carlon’s mastery of the tenor saxophone, they use no string instruments at all. The two have created a unique group sound that they call Nation Beat. There is no guitar, piano or bass to drive this music forward. There are only drums and a hand full of horns. Surprisingly, I am completely satisfied with their sound. I don’t even miss the normal, expected rhythm section. This quintet strikes a groove on each original composition and their music is full of fun, as happy as a child at the circus.\n\nThey open with “Try Try Try” an original composition by Paul Carlon. It begins like a processional hymn and the melody quickly engages me. However, it only lasts for just under a moment, like an interlude. Then the drums kick-in and establish an upbeat groove for Track #2 called “Science Tribes.” I find myself tapping my toe and humming along with the comfortable and repeatable melodic structure. Luca Texeira adds percussion to the arrangement. Mark Collins takes a tasty solo on trumpet. Tom McHugh uses his trombone to sometimes act like a bass line, but it’s Heather Ewer, on sousaphone, who really plays that bass part. Paul Carlon soars during his tenor saxophone solo on this tune. He has also arranged the horns for this project. I hear a taste of New Orleans jazz blended in, perfect and tasty, like salt in the stew.\n\nOn the title tune, I clearly hear their Brazilian influence. This is a tune that Kettner and Carlon wrote together. Their ensemble adds several vocal outbursts to raise the exuberance and tension during the tune, along with the wonderful drumming of Kettner, who is the driving force behind this unique musical package.\n\nOn “Always Spring with You” they feature Melanie Scholtz on vocals. She helped compose this song. Melanie layers her voice, adding harmonies. The other female on this project plays the large and cumbersome sousaphone instrument. It’s bent in the middle to wrap around the body of a musician, and it sounds a lot like a tuba. It definitely adds the bass to this music. You can really enjoy the sousaphone instrument on a tune they call, “Forro Le Fonque.” (Perhaps translating to “For the Funk”?).\n\nYou get a little of everything on this album, including a bit of the Hip Hop culture when special guest, Christylez Bacon, adds his rhymes to the mix on “Give A Little.” Michael Spiro slaps his congas, lifting the arrangement on a tune called “Mo Forró.”\n\nYou will find yourself captivated by the varying arrangements and the natural way these expert musicians blend with each other. I found it totally unnecessary to have a traditional rhythm section. This is cultural crossbreeding at its best. In some respects, this is experimental jazz. In other respects, it’s fusion, but always entertaining, unique, and well played.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nIZE TRIO – “THE GLOBAL SUITES” – Independent Label\n\nChase Morrin, piano/composer; George Lernis, percussion; Naseem Alatrash, cello. SPECIAL GUESTS: John Patitucci, bass; Farayi Malek & Heiraza, voice.\n\nThe core of the Ize Trio (a Boston-based collective), is to combine jazz and Middle Eastern music. Chase Morrin, a San Diego native, brings his classical and very lyrical style to the piano. Add to that the provocative cello talents of Naseem Alatrash, who has Palestinian roots, along with the tasty percussion licks of Cyprus-born George Lernis and you have an inspired, unique trio. This is their debut album.\n\nMorrin, Lernis and Alatrash met in Boston as students at Berklee Global Jazz Institute, working on master’s degrees. This Global jazz Institute encouraged them to explore musical multiculturalism and social activism. Their concept for The Global Suites began during the COVID pandemic shutdown. The three musicians had already established a friendship. When finding themselves locked in their dormitory rooms (for safety’s sake), they continued their trio venture remotely. This album features four expansive suites of music. Each suite represents a social issue.\n\nThey open with the first movement, “Break G4S” that focuses on Capitalism. The cellist, Alatrash, opens the piece in a low cello register, a double bass-like sound. He is joined by the Lernis percussions and later, by Morrin on piano. This part of the suite represents the global military-industrial complex, starting with “The Machine” as movement one. They use dissonance to represent chaos and employ different keys and polyphony to show the churn of a sometimes-chaotic system of government. In Part 2, “Echoes on the Wall” begins with a haunting cello solo. The trio says it is meant to symbolize those silenced by the pressures that grow from an inequitable system. The CD liner notes explain that counter melodies and piano synergy enter to represent the questions in the minds of society. The entire first movement is meant to reflect the present, ongoing, political and social unrest within the state of our environment.\n\nMovement #2 is titled “Resurrecting the Amber Sky” and is a very beautiful piece of music that incorporates the gorgeous voice of guest artist, Farayi Malek, often singing in unison with the cello and creating a very warm and emotional arrangement. This music made me feel peaceful, like relaxing in my favorite lounge chair. Chase Morrin is magnificent on piano. He has written all these compositions. The first tune of this movement, “Present” is one of my favorites of their project. John Patitucci adds his awesome bass talent to this arrangement.\n\nThe sound textures, multi-cultures, and revolutionary spirit of this project makes each movement a new adventure. Chase Morrin is an awesome composer and brilliant pianist. George Lernis brings rhythm and creativity to each piece. Alatrash weaves his traditional Arabic music into jazz and contemporary classical music from the strings of his cello. He has played with the Turtle Island Quartet and collaborated with Terence Blanchard. Both have been nominated for Grammy Awards.\n\nThe final Movement, “Elemeno,” is exciting. On #1 of this suite “Be A Kid” I am whisked away to Africa with a vocal chant, and the wild and wonderful percussion of George Lernis. This closing suite quickly became another favorite of mine.\n\nThe thought of finding such beauty and innovation using a trio of piano, percussion and cello, is quite unique and surprising. Every movement is a breath of fresh air, blowing through the windows of my mind. The Ize Trio opens my psyche to promise and possibility.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nRAUL MIDÓN – “LOST & FOUND” – ReKondite Rekords\n\nRaul Midón, vocals/guitar/percussion/bass/drums/banjo /programming; Federico Peña, keyboards/piano; Richard Hammond, bass; Andrés Forero, drums/percussion; Lionel Cordew, drums; Mike Errico & Matt Beck, guitar; Andrew Sherman, string arrangement; STRINGS: Maxim Moston, violin; Hiroko Taguchi, viola; Jessie Reagen Mann, cello; Wayna, vocals; Kathleen Midón, background vocals.\n\nAs soon as I heard the first strains of the title song, “Lost & Found,” I could tell that this artist is one of many who are influenced and inspired by the music of Stevie Wonder. This was before I read in his bio that he also, like Stevie, is a blind musician. Raul Midón is a composer, singer, guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, and multi-Grammy nominee. Prior to becoming a first call session singer, Midón worked with legendary entertainers like Arif Mardin, Pat Metheny, Bill Withers, Marcus Miller, Lizz Wright, Herbie Hancock, Dianne Reeves and Alex Cuba, to list only a few. On songs like the title tune and another original called “Next Time” you hear the Stevie Wonder style creep into the arrangements and chordal structures.\n\nBut Raul Midón has a style all his own. He is his own creative man and was invited to perform on the famed NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert some six years ago. They mention how he is respected by both George Benson and Stevie Wonder. Midon has a way of genre blending when he composes and arranges music. Consequently, he incorporates a bit of jazz into his folk, pop and soft rock music unapologetically.\n\nThis recent album release features Raul’s original compositions, mostly pop music with a taste of folk or soft rock tinging some of the songs, like “Ocean of Doubt,” with its protest lyrics that list his beliefs: meditation, education and love. On a well-written composition called “Anything at All” Midón shows off his amazing guitar skills during a solo performance, while lyrically encouraging his listeners that they can do anything, anything at all. Midón also plays percussion on this arrangement and shines. Another well written tune that has a folksy feel, like back in the 1960s, when Pater, Paul & Mary-music was popular, is “When We Remember.”\n\nRaul Midón is an excellent composer, singer/songwriter and his lyrics are as wonderful as his melodic talents. “The Ganja Song” is extremely melodic with a lyrical explanation of experiencing and enjoying ‘Mary Jane.’ He closes with “Wall of Indifference,” a song whose lyrics explain that he hopes for a better time, but in the meanwhile, he has to cope with the world as it is, imperfect. He leaves the listeners with questions about our own walls of indifference, but still engaged and captivated by Midón’s voice, his compositions, and incredible musical talent.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nBy Dee Dee McNeil\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nBRUNA BLACK & JOHN FINBURY – “VA REVELACCO” – Green Flash Music\n\nBruna Black, vocals; Vitor Goncalves, piano/accordion; Chico Pinheiro, acoustic & electric guitars; John Patitucci, bass; Duduka Da Fonseca, drums; Rogerio Boccato, percussion.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=h4MYTKg0n6M\n\nInstantaneously, I am enchanted by Bruna Black’s crystal-clear vocals. Her tone and style are compelling. In Brazil, they are raving about Bruna Black. Surprisingly, she is a former semi-pro basketball player who grew up listening to her cousins singing in church and admiring them. She enjoyed singing, but Bruna hadn’t thought it would be her career path. On a whim, she auditioned for the Brazilian “Voice” television contest in 2020, just before her twenty-first birthday.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=lftTn8dhboo\n\nBruna had always loved sports and music. She studied drums, percussion and worked with a classical vocal coach. In 2021, she became part of a duo called “Avua” with Jota.pê and they became an overnight success with millions of YouTube video views. She was offered a European tour.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=xKSl4EvdqRY\n\nWhen John Finbury, an American composer with a love of Brazilian-influenced music, heard about Bruna Black he was intrigued. Finbury’s music gained recognition in 2016 with a Latin Grammy nomination for Song of the Year (A Chama Verde) and an American Grammy nomination in Best Latin jazz Album in 2020 (Sortel). Composed just North of Boston, who could have guessed that Finbury was not living somewhere near Rio De Janiero? While working with Latin Grammy winning producer, Emilio D. Miller, he was introduced to Bruna Black’s voice. Emilio thought she would be the perfect vehicle to introduce Finbury’s music to the world. That’s how “Va Revelacco” came to be. They cut this album in New York with the famed John Patitucci on bass, the heralded drummer, Duduka Da Fonseca holding down the percussion along with Rogerio Boccato. This is an album of Brazilian jazz that is fresh, provoking, and hugely creative. The merging of Bruna Black’s voice with composer/producer John Finbury’s talents seems to be the start of something big!\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=CLLWkquFYp4\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nLISA RICH – “LONG AS YOU’RE LIVING” – Tritone Records\n\nLisa Rich, vocals; Marc Copland, piano; Drew Gress, bass; Dave Ballou, trumpet.\n\nLisa Rich is a ‘seller of songs’ sharing an emotional and honest delivery with her audience. She snatches my attention with the very first title tune called “Long as You’re Living.” I immediately connected to her genuine, heartfelt vocals. Rich had a thriving career in the 1980s, until she was sidelined with a debilitating illness.\n\nHer dear friend, the late Jay Clayton, (Judith Theresa Colantone, Oct 28, 1841 – Dec 31, 2023) encouraged Lisa to return to her passion and to the stage.\n\n“I loved Jay. She was so brilliant and so spiritual. She loved music and teaching, and it was her love and guidance that gave me the confidence to record a new album,” Lisa Rich says in her press package.\n\nPerforming with a seasoned trio, the accompaniment of Marc Copland on piano adds exquisite colors to this production. His sensitive chord placement and creativity offers a warm, wonderful addition to these arrangements. He supports the Lisa Rich vocals with tenacity and ingenuity. They sound so amazing together. Both sparkle on her presentation of the challenging composition “A Timeless Place (The Peacocks).” I find the Rich vocals captivating on this song and also on the popular “Jitterbug Waltz.” To my delight, Dave Ballou splashes his trumpet notes all over this arrangement, before Copland enthralls us with his piano brilliance. Drew Gress is dynamic during his double bass solo. Rich also sings Abbey Lincoln’s tune, “Throw It Away” with fervor and commitment, letting the grandmother-wise words drip melodically across my listening room.\n\nLisa Rich is no newcomer to the jazz scene. She recorded with the brilliant Clare Fischer in 1983, an album titled “Listen Here” and again in 1985 when they recorded “Touch of the Rare.” In 1987, Ms. Rich recorded a third album that was a tribute to the iconic Chick Corea titled, “Highwire” and featuring a host of Corea’s original compositions including some he hand-picked for Lisa to sing. Songs that had never been recorded before. Her voice sounds as bright, original and lovely today as it did then.\n\nShe also recorded an album on the Discovery label in 1985 called, “Morning.” Journalist and historian, Leonard Feather, wrote in the Los Angeles Times:\n\n“The complaint has often been lodged that no young jazz singers are coming up to take over from the Fitzgeralds and Vaughans. Every once in a while, a singer such as Lisa Rich will come along and give life to this theory.”\n\nLisa Rich is the recipient of three grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, Rich performed at The Kennedy Center, and was an artist in residence at the Smithsonian Institution. She was featured numerous times on NPR (National Public Radio) and also on Voice of America. Her career was in high gear when a serious health issue stopped everything.\n\nWhat a gift this recent release is. Her current album is like discovering an exquisite and rare flower with a scent so unique you immediately want to grow it in your garden. Here is an album I will enjoy listening to time and again. Lisa Rich is a rare find on today’s jazz scene.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nALYSSA ALLGOOD – “FROM HERE” – Next Records\n\nAlyssa Allgood, vocals/lyricist/composer; Geoffrey Keezer, piano; John Patitucci, bass; Kendrick Scott, drums; Greg Ward, saxophone.\n\nOn this, her fourth album release, Alyssa Allgood is exposing her composing skills. Opening with “Burn (For Betty)” she has included a small booklet that shares her lyrics, neatly printed out for the listener’s consumption. Geoffrey Keezer takes a steamy hot piano solo, while Allgood does her fair share of scat singing during their arrangement. The second song is called “Your Wings” and has a beautiful melody with Kendrick Scott’s drums creating a jazz waltz. Allgood’s band is excellent and develops each arrangement to its potential. I like the way Allgood and Patitucci on bass sing a unison scat together. Her rendition of the Joni Mitchell song “Both Sides Now” should get lots of airplay. Her voice and range is perfect for interpreting this standard pop/jazz song. The harmonization of Allgood’s vocals with the Greg Ward saxophone is a nice blend. This song is one of my favorites on her album. I think jazz singers and songwriters can learn so much listening to the lyrics and melodic rhythms of Joni Mitchell and Abbey Lincoln.\n\nThe lyrics and melody of Allgood’s original composition called “Brave Little Flower” is an example of a well-written composition. This album features ten of Allgood’s original songs.\n\n“These songs are reflections of my journey. …to understand and love myself more deeply, and to fully embrace my artistic vision as a bandleader, composer, and arranger,” Alyssa Allgood explains in her press package.\n\nOn her tune “No Good” she swings, scats, and shows off her vocal range. John Patitucci is boldly featured on bass, walking briskly beneath Allgood’s improvised scatting. Kendrick Scott sets the groove and tempo on drums for her composition called “Other Side.” I find Alyssa Allgood’s melodies to be very jazzy and the chord changes lend themselves to creative improvisation by her band members. Keezer’s piano solos always expand her songs, creating new inroads and improvising freely. Allyssa shows off her jazz singer roots on the standard “On A Clear Day” playing with the melody and taking time to scat her way around the ‘changes.’\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke72z6dL_4Q\n\nThere is real potential in Allgood’s songwriting. I admire her sense of melody and the rhythm she creates with her lyrics. A sense of self-examination and realization colors each of her original lyrics. In her songs, you get to know Alyssa Allgood, the woman, and not just the singer.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nKAREN MACK – “CATCH & KEEP” – KmackMusic\n\nKaren Mack, vocals; Peter Eldridge, piano/organ; Jesse Lewis, guitars; Matt Aronoff, upright bass; Jared Schonig, drums/percussion; Ben Wittman, percussion. SPECIAL GUESTS: Darmon Meader, saxophones; Nadje Noordhuis, trumpet flugelhorn; Elliot Roth, piano/vocals.\n\nKaren Mack conceived this album with her mother-in-law in mind. She wanted to record a bunch of jazz standards as a gift to her husband’s mom for her birthday. She was thinking of producing an EP, maybe five or six songs. So, Mack and her good friend, pianist/producer, Peter Eldridge, began work on the project. It soon became apparent they had enough songs picked for a full album. That’s how “Catch & Keep” came to fruition.\n\nThere is something comfortable about Karen Mack’s voice, when she sings “Imagination,” on top of a very original arrangement that carries me back to the 1960s Rock/Pop era. It reminds me of the Mamas and Papas who were headlined by the pretty voice of Mama Cass. There is something nostalgic and pop about this arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, Mack’s opening tune clearly establishes that this vocalist can swing. “Nothing Like You” is a great opener for her album. Mack has a bright, crystal-clear vocal style and a relaxed delivery that sells her songs. I believe her when she sings the opening verse to the Harry Warren/Mack Gordon standard, “This is Always.” She has a little girl, Blossom Dearie kind of voice. Karen Mack could easily crossover to the pop world. I hear her lean into folk/pop music on her original song that she co-wrote with Peter Eldridge and Elliot Roth called “November Day.”\n\nShe’s back to jazz on her other original song called “Hurry Up and Wait.” Karen Mack swings free and easy on this tune with catchy lyrics and an impressive saxophone solo by Darmon Meader. Matt Aronoff walks briskly on his upright bass, locking the groove in with Jared Schonig’s dynamic drums. Together they pump this tune up beneath Mack’s jazzy delivery. This is a very well-written song and quickly becomes another favorite from Karen Mack’s sophomore album. Peter Eldrige is the co-writer. He also plays piano and organ on this project. Eldrige is a founding member of the internationally acclaimed vocal group, New York Voices.\n\nMack currently has a residency at Pangea in New York City’s East Village with pianist and vocalist Elliot Roth, who sings a duet with her on the bonus track of this album.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see they had covered a song by Southern California’s own singer/songwriter and living legend, Betty Bryant. I love Betty’s writing. She generally has a tongue-in-cheek humor peeking through her catchy lyrics. Mack’s vocals match the very well-written Bryant composition called, “It’s Hard to Say Goodbye.”\n\nKaren Mack won a Bistro Award for her versatility in 2024. Mack’s ability to sing everything from the Great American Songbook to contemporary jazz and pop/rock shines on this project. Her voice and repertoire are both appealing and entertaining.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nLAKECIA BENJAMIN – “PHOENIX REIMAGINED (LIVE)” – Ropeadope Records\n\nLakecia Benjamin, alto saxophone/vocals/composer/arranger; Zaccai Curtis & Ray Angry, piano; Elias Bailey & Ri"
