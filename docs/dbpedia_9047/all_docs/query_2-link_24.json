        "text": "Last summer I heard David Murray playing at a big jazz festival. A year later I get to hear him live stream from the Village Vanguard playing new music with pianist Lafayette Gilchrist.\n\nDavid Murray, tenor saxophone and bass clarinet; Lafayette Gilchrist, piano; live stream from the Village Vanguard, Friday 28 August 2020\n\nSaxophonists and pianists like to play in duos. Stan Getz and Kenny Barron, Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock, Archie Shepp and Mal Waldron, Charles Lloyd and Jason Moran, Branford Marsalis and Joey Calderazzo, Joshua Redman and Brad Mehldau; they all have recorded albums together and the list could go on.\n\nSaxophonist David Murray has recorded duo albums with pianists Randy Weston, John Hicks, Dave Burrell, and Aki Takase. Now he plays as a duo at the Village Vanguard with pianist Lafayette Gilchrist who has played in his quartet a long time. They play a set of both new and familiar pieces of mostly original music by Murray and Gilchrist.\n\nThe European connection\n\nDavid Murray started to record in the mid-1970s as a twenty-year-old. He was influenced by the popular saxophonists at the time like Rahsaan Kirk and Archie Shepp. Murray uses the circular breathing technique which also Kirk had down, which enables him to play long phrases.\n\nLike Kirk and Shepp, Murray has also the admiration for and knowledge of older styles of saxophone playing and jazz. Here it is displayed as he plays a version of Billy Strayhorn’s “Chelsea bridge” which was recorded by the Duke Ellington Orchestra with tenor saxophonist Ben Webster in 1941. Murray has some of Ben Webster’s big sound in his own playing. With his big eyes and moustache Murray even bears some physical resemblance to Webster. Like him Murray is also an expatriate living in Europe. He has made Portugal his home as Webster made Denmark his. Murray even seems to have adopted a taste for European sports as he has a club badge of the very popular Italian soccer team Juventus attached to his tie at the concert.\n\nMurray also plays the bass clarinet where he has found a melodic approach on the very dark sounding instrument which has been mostly associated with Eric Dolphy in jazz. He has a rich repertoire of songs to chose from like “Morning song” and “When the Monarchs Come to Town” which he has recorded previously with other artists.\n\nUpcoming album\n\nPianist Lafayette Gilchrist brings some new material to the concert. He plays with a stride technique to cover the loss of a bassist and drummer, but also with a joyous rhythm and melody.\n\nMurray announces that they have a new album coming out soon. He has recorded some great albums the last couple of years, like Perfection (2016) with Geri Allen and David Murray., and Blues for Nemo (2018) with poet Saul Williams. Hopefully, his new album will live up to them.\n\nA year ago, I heard Murray play live with Saul Williams at the Middelheim Jazz Festival in Antwerp. A year later the world looks a whole lot different. To hear him live stream is better than no live music at all, but it is note quite like attending a great concert.\n\nDavid Murray and Lafayette Gilchrist will also live stream Saturday night followed by a limited period of streaming on demand."
