        "text": "The David Murray Guide\n\nby Tom Hull\n\nThis was published in The Village Voice on May 20, 2006. For an update and altnerative slice, see my David Murray Guide (2020).\n\nBorn 1955 in California, David Murray is far and away the greatest tenor saxophonist of his generation. He fed on church, funk, and the great sax men of the '60s -- Albert Ayler and Paul Gonsalves early on, and soon he had mastered everyone without ever sounding like anyone else. By 1975, avant-jazz had gone underground, and Murray dug deep, recording prolifically for tiny labels -- 90 as a leader, 90 more as a sideman including 20 with the World Saxophone Quartet, and some count even more. His records are hard to find, little known, and in many cases out of print.\n\nDAVID MURRAY\n\nLow Class Conspiracy\n\n(1976, Adelphi)\n\nAt 21, Murray moved to New York from California and bulled his way into the lofts that had become an avant-grade refuge. His first studio album showcases a trio that cedes a lot of space to bassist Fred Hopkins, including a solo dedicated to Jimmy Garrison. But Murray is already a virtuoso, his trademark the stratospheric runs he punctuates with abrupt honks. Stanley Crouch's liner notes lionize Murray in terms he would soon apply to lesser talents: Murray \"swings.\" I'd say he rocks.\n\nDAVID MURRAY TRIO\n\nSweet Lovely\n\n(1979 [1980], Black Saint)\n\nMurray finally found a steady outlet in Italy on Giovanni Bonandrini's label. His second album there was this bare-bones trio, with Fred Hopkins and Steve McCall setting up obstacle courses for Murray's fierce saxophone runs. The title song didn't make the cut -- fittingly, on such a raw-sounding outing.\n\nDAVID MURRAY OCTET\n\nMing\n\n(1980, Black Saint)\n\nThis octet record was startling when it appeared, recalling Mingus both in its complex layering and its sheer energy, but pushing further as it unleashed some of the most distinctive musicians of the '80s -- most notably Henry Threadgill, George Lewis, and Murray himself. Cornetist Butch Morris went on to make a cottage industry out of conducted improvisations -- conductions, he called them. This is where he learned his craft.\n\nDAVID MURRAY QUARTET\n\nMorning Song (1983 [1984], Black Saint)\n\nHe's recorded the title track many times, but never again so joyously as leading off this ebullient album. Other delights include a meditation on \"Body and Soul,\" a bass clarinet romp through \"Jitterbug Waltz,\" and a brief but intense \"Duet\" with drummer Ed Blackwell. Neither avant nor diluted -- one of his most accessible albums.\n\nJOHN HICKS/DAVID MURRAY\n\nSketches of Tokyo\n\n(1985 [1986], DIW)\n\nBilled as by \"John Hicks/David Murray,\" this stands out because Hicks keeps pushing his ideas even when Murray is flying. Piano duo albums became a Murray staple, with his quartet pianists -- Dave Burrell as well as Hicks -- less daunted than such brave outsiders as Jon Jang and Randy Weston.\n\nDAVID MURRAY TRIO\n\nThe Hill\n\n(1986, Black Saint)\n\nRichard Davis and Joe Chambers are more orthodox than Murray's usual trio-mates -- they complement rather than compete, which lets Murray relax and expand. He reveals new subtleties in his tricky title cut, works out a Butch Morris puzzle, takes Ellington Coltrane, and ends at his leisure on Strayhorn's \"Chelsea Bridge.\" But this isn't standard fare. Davis plays quite a bit of bass fiddle, especially on the bass clarinet feature, and Chambers closes on vibes.\n\nDAVID MURRAY\n\nDeep River\n\n(1988 [1989], DIW)\n\nFamously prolific, Murray was never more so than during his January 1988 quartet sessions (Burrell, Hopkins, Ralph Peterson Jr.) in New York for Japan's DIW. The label split up the surplus into self-evident album titles: Ballads, Spirituals, Lovers, Tenors. The first released has a bit of each and two Africa-themed originals that head elsewhere. All this music is so consistent it should be wrapped up into a magnificent box set.\n\nGEORGE ARVANITAS/DAVID MURRAY\n\nTea for Two\n\n(1990 [1991], Fresh Sound)\n\nWith George Arvanitas, this is the most conventional of Murray's piano duos: songbook fare, all ballads, ably supported, exquisite.\n\nDAVID MURRAY\n\nShakill's Warrior\n\n(1991, DIW)\n\nSoul-jazz formula takes organ and drums, then adds sax and/or guitar -- here both. But Murray doesn't settle for the funk that guitarist Stanley Franks delivers on Andrew Cyrille's piece. That's because Don Pullen's organ goes places only his piano has gone before -- compare \"At the Cafe Central\" with his original.\n\nDAVID MURRAY\n\nBallads for Bass Clarinet\n\n(1991 [1993], DIW)\n\nMurray adopted the bass clarinet as a second horn in 1979 with the World Saxophone Quartet, used it on Ming, and brought it to the fore in 1981's Clarinet Summit. Since then he's used it for a song or two on most of his albums, and recorded this single showcase. He gets much more out of the instrument than its characteristic hollow tone, including a clean high register he can soar in and honk against.\n\nDAVID MURRAY/MILFORD GRAVES\n\nReal Deal\n\n(1991 [1992], DIW)\n\nA duet album with Milford Graves, an innovative drummer with roots in the '60s avant-garde who sets the pace. Murray freewheels, at times so caught up in the rhythm that he just clicks and pops.\n\nDAVID MURRAY BIG BAND\n\nSouth of the Border\n\n(1992 [1995], DIW)\n\nMurray's previous big-band efforts, starting in 1984 with Live at Sweet Basil, diluted him. But looking south for beat and vibe, conductor Butch Morris weaves the extra horns in seamlessly. Not that they look very far: the table setter is a Sonny Rollins calypso.\n\nDAVID MURRAY\n\nThe Long Goodbye: A Tribute to Don Pullen\n\n(1996, DIW)\n\nFour songs by the late, great pianist; two by his prot�g� D.D. Jackson, who occupies the hot seat; the title cut a Butch Morris dirge. Despite some rousing passages, this is becalming and elegiac, a fitting companion to Pullen's own Ode to Life.\n\nDAVID MURRAY\n\nCreole\n\n(1997, Justin Time)\n\nMoving to France, Murray stepped further out into the world. Fo Deuk Revue introduced him to Senegal's griots and rappers. Here he goes to Guadeloupe, encountering the ka drums, flutes, and vocals at the other end of the Middle Passage. Two remarkable reunions followed -- Yonn-D� (2002) and the Pharoah Sanders-fortified Gwotet (2004) -- but this is one jazz-world fusion of Murray's that comes together whole.\n\nDAVID MURRAY POWER QUARTET\n\nLike a Kiss That Never Ends\n\n(2000 [2001], Justin Time\n\n\"David Murray Power Quartet,\" the billing says, but it's more like Classic Quartet, with longtime mates Hicks, Cyrille, and Ray Drummond on board. Classic album too -- powerful, yes, but unlike his youthful work, never rough.\n\nDAVID MURRAY LATIN BIG BAND\n\nNow Is Another Time\n\n(2001-02 [2003], Justin Time)\n\nThe \"David Murray Latin Big Band\" goes south of the border for real. A huge band with muy Latinos and no Butch Morris. Still, Murray stands out -- as with Dizzy Gillespie, no band is big enough to contain him.\n\nPostscript and Disclaimer\n\nThese are my notes, from 2006.\n\nI've read reports that Murray's recorded 200-300 records. The figures above (90 + 90) are all I've been able to verify, but those numbers are most likely somewhat short. The division between leader and sideman is somewhat arbitrary. His records are hard to find. I've gone out of my way to follow him, and still I've only heard heard 60 + 40 of them. No doubt I've missed some real good ones. I haven't heard 3D Family (1978, Hat Art), which he's kept as the name of his company. I've missed a bunch of the DIWs -- Remembrances* (1991) has an especially strong reputation.\n\nA lot of Murray records didn't miss the above list by much. Here's a quick rundown, plus a few comments:\n\nFlowers for Albert: The Complete Concert* (1976, India Navigation) is the only early live album I've heard. Several others have made it to CD: Flowers for Albert (1977, West Wind); Live at the Lower Manhattan Ocean Club (1977, Indian Navigation); The London Concert (1978, Cadillac).\n\nHome* (1981, Black Saint) and Murray's Steps (1982, Black Saint): further adventures with the Octet, a group that returns for Octet Plays Trane (1999, Justin Time).\n\nI Want to Talk About You (1986, Black Saint): A live trio that ties this period together.\n\nSpecial Quartet (1990, DIW): With McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones, not to mention Fred Hopkins.\n\nBody and Soul (1993, Black Saint): Another twist on the Hawkins classic.\n\nThe Tip and Jug-a-Lug (1994, DIW): Two upbeat sets with organ and electric guitars, one with \"Sex Machine.\"\n\nOther notable DIWs: Fast Life (1991), For Aunt Louise (1993), With Ray Anderson and Anthony Davis (1994).\n\nOther piano duos: Dave Burrell's In Concert (1991, Victo) and Windward Passages (1993, Black Saint) are strongest, followed closely by Aki Takase's Blue Monk (1991, Enja).\n\nMurray has also recorded drum duos with Kahil El'Zabar, but Love Outside of Dreams (1997, Delmark) has something extra -- one of Fred Hopkins's last performances.\n\nI don't like the strings on Waltz Again (2002, Justin Time), but the saxophone is magnificent.\n\nWith 20 albums to date, Murray's longest-running side-project is the World Saxophone Quartet, formed in 1977 with Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, and Hamiett Bluiett. Hemphill was the main arranger until illness sidelined him in 1990. His records, with four saxes and nothing else, follow a purism I've never enjoyed and often found tedious. The later records are more eclectic, often with extra musicians as well as whoever they could find for Hemphill's slot. One of the best is the African drums-enhanced Selim Sivad: A Tribute to Miles Davis (1998, Justin Time).\n\nOne of the best sideman albums is Kip Hanrahan's Conjure, Music for the Texts of Ishmael Reed (1983, American Clav�), eventually followed by Bad Mouth (2005, American Clav�).\n\nAlso: D.D. Jackson, Peace-Song (1994, Justin Time).\n\nMurray has never had a box set, a best-of, a compilation of any sort. He did get a role in Robert Altman's Kansas City, as Ben Webster. Also played on the Roots, Illadelph Halflife (1996, DGC).\n\nDiscography\n\n#1976.05.23 Wildflowers: The New York Loft Jazz Sessions Complete (1976, Knitting Factory, 3CD) [U] collects five LPs, originally Douglas 7045-7049; Murray appears on three tracks #1976.06.26 David Murray: Flowers for Albert: The Complete Concert (1976 [1997], India Navigation, 2CD) [U] DM (ts), Olu Dara (t, fh), Fred Hopkins (b), Phillip Wilson (d) reissue includes three additional tracks (+45:47) Murray was 21 (born 1955-02-19), from Berkeley CA, freshly moved to NYC where he moved right in to the loft scene. nb: Penguin Guide lists *Flowers for Albert* as India Navigation 1004 [2CD], recorded 9/77, with Lawrence Butch Morris, Don Pullen, Fred Hopkins, Stanley Crouch. this isn't listed in Murray sessionography, but is similar to West Wind 2039, David Murray and the Low Class Conspiracy: Flowers for Albert, recorded 1977-08-18, originally 2lp, later 1cd omitting one song. can't find anything more on IN 2004. #1976.06.29 David Murray: Low Class Conspiracy (1976, Adelphi) [B+] DM (ts), Fred Hopkins (b), Phillip Wilson (d) have LP. Murray very impressive on \"Dewey's Circle,\" at least until Hopkins takes over. \"B/T\" is also impressive. Hopkins goes solo on \"Dedication to Jimmy Garrison\". Stanley Crouch wrote liner notes: \"Each of the players, firstly, is a swinger, and swing, regardless of style, is the marrow of African-American Art Music, or Jazz.\" #1977.06.xx World Saxophone Quartet: Point of No Return (1977, Moers 1034) [B] DM (ts), Julius Hemphill (as), Oliver Lake (as), Hamiet Bluiett (bs) #1979.12.05 David Murray Trio: Sweet Lovely (1979 [1980], Black Saint) [A-] DM (ts), Fred Hopkins (b), Steve McCall (d) #1980.01.17 James Blood Ulmer: Are You Glad to Be in America?

Plays bcl on the Waller piece; Air was doing similar things around this time, but this is even more joyous. \"Off Season\" sounds like bcl too, less obviously. \"Duet\" is definitely sax, just drums for accompaniment, just 2:14 long, really terrific. #1983.10.xx Conjure: Music for the Texts of Ishmael Reed (1983 [1985], American Clav�) [A-] group led by Kip Hanrahan #1983.xx.xx Jamaaldeen Tacuma: Renaissance Man (1983, Gramavision) [B] #1984.08.26 David Murray Big Band: Live at Sweet Basil, Vol. 1 (1984, Black Saint) [B] #1984.08.26 David Murray Big Band: Live at Sweet Basil, Vol. 2 (1984 [1985], Black Saint) [B] #1984.xx.xx Kip Hanrahan: Vertical's Currency (1984, American Clav�) [B] #1985.04.11 John Hicks/David Murray: Sketches of Tokyo (1985 [1986], DIW) [A-] DM (ts, bcl), JH (p) covers: Epistrophy (Monk), Naima (Coltrane), God Bless the Child;
