        "text": "Spotlight on bassist David Murray\n\n“Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.” So said John Paul Friedrich Richter over two hundred years ago.\n\nIt’s indisputable that music touches us in a manner inaccessible by other forms of sound. The low tones of a bass guitar hit our bodies with sound waves that mimic our heartbeat and vibrate our skin, at times able to reach the cavity of our chest. If ever we needed the healing power of music, whether it lifts our spirits, calms our souls, or rattles our bones … it’s now.\n\nTHANKS, DAVE, FOR ALLOWING ME TO INTERVIEW YOU. MAYBE I’LL START WITH THIS QUESTION:\n\nWAS MUSIC ALWAYS A PART OF YOUR LIFE? WAS A LOVE OF MUSIC SOMETHING YOU HAD AS A CHILD?\n\nYes. I loved music growing up. i remember having my eyes glued to the TV watching The Ed Sullivan Show on Sunday nights at 8:00 p.m. And all the other variety shows too - Dean Martin, The Smothers Brothers, Dick Clark, etc. I loved the idea of getting in front of people and performing.\n\nWHO DID YOU IDOLIZE AS A KID?\n\nI idolized many, but loved Jack Bruce from Cream, and John Paul Jones who was known from Led Zeppelin.\n\nWHO TAUGHT YOU TO PLAY?\n\nIt was a combination of friends, lessons, and listening to records. I studied with a local jazz musician for two years. He had studied with Dave Holland who played with Miles Davis.\n\n“Don’t play what’s there; play what isn’t there.” - quote by Miles Davis\n\nHOW MANY BANDS HAVE YOU PLAYED IN?\n\nOver my lifetime, I’ve maybe played with approximately twenty bands. Right now I’m working in two bands, one Top 40 Rock, and the other is a Blues Rock band.\n\nDO YOU SOMETIMES FEEL A LITTLE TOO OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT AS THE BASS PLAYER? DO YOU EVER FEEL THAT THE GLORY GOES TO THE SINGER AND LEAD GUITARIST?\n\nMostly, yes.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAS BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR MUSIC CAREER SO FAR?\n\nWhen I was in my early twenties I had the opportunity of meeting and jamming with the blues legend, Hubert Sumlin three times.\n\n“When I’m reaching an audience, I feel it.” - quote by Hubert Sumlin\n\nHOW MANY GUITARS DO YOU CURRENTLY OWN?\n\nI currently own five bass guitars and one acoustic guitar which i hardly play.\n\nHAVE YOU EVER BLANKED DURING A PERFORMANCE AND FORGOT HOW TO PLAY A PARTICULAR SONG?\n\nMaybe in the early days, but now i have a good memory for the songs. Sometimes I slip up and forget a part.\n\nAND DO YOU EVER GET NERVOUS BEFORE A PERFORMANCE?\n\nI used to get nervous when I started out. But now I rarely get the jitters.\n\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST RIFT AMONG YOU AND YOUR BAND MATES AT ANY TIME?\n\nWriting an original song and and arguing over which part who came up with.\n\nIF YOU COULD OPEN A SHOW FOR ANY ARTIST, WHO WOULD IT BE?\n\nEric Clapton or The Allman Brothers. I would love to work with Eric Clapton.\n\n“I’d love to knock an audience cold with one note.\n\nBut what do you do for the rest of the evening?”\n\n- quote by Eric Clapton\n\nWHICH RECORDS WERE YOU MOST INFLUENCED BY?\n\nToo many to mention, but I loved Cream, and all the Motown Music.\n\nAND DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE ALBUM? WHY?\n\nGenesis Foxtrot. I love it! The music relaxes me.\n\nHOW DO YOU ARRANGE YOUR RECORDS SO YOU CAN LOCATE THE ONES YOU WANT EASILY?\n\nI arrange the LPs the same way that radio stations do. Name of the band (Beatles - B); (Frank Sinatra - S).\n\nThank you so much, Dave, for this peek into your life as a bassist! All the best to you and your music career (post covid, of course)."
