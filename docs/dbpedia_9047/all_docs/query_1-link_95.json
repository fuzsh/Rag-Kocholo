        "text": "Hampton - David W. Murray, 86, of Hampton, formerly of Newburyport, MA.\n\nIt is with immense sorrow that we share the passing of our Dad, Grampie, brother, uncle, cousin and loyal friend who left us unexpectedly but peacefully in his sleep July 8, 2024.\n\nBorn in Newburyport, MA to the late Joseph and Dorothea Murray, he attended Immaculate Conception School, graduated from Newburyport High School and went on to serve six years in the United States Air Force.\n\nHe was active in Newburyport life and politics. He was a member of the city council and served as its President (1970). He dedicated 11 years to the city as Housing Authority Commissioner (1975-1986), and held the position of Civil Defense Director (80's).\n\nIn 1972, he chaired Newburyport's annual Yankee Homecoming celebration. David and his wife, Faith, loved the tradition of this annual celebration, and enjoyed volunteering for many of its events. Often, award-winning floats were built in their front yard as part of the closing parade.\n\nDavid's career included working at Coca-Cola and W. E. Atkinson in Newburyport. He retired at 80 years young from Aqua Laboratories in Amesbury, MA after 24 years as Director of Plant Operations.\n\nDavid was married to his beloved wife, Faith, for 61 years, until her passing in 2023. He was also predeceased by his sister, Kathryn. He will be incredibly missed by those he left behind including his four children Lisa Murray-Nagle (Keith), Andrea Heavey (Dennis), Leslie Daigle (Todd), and Daniel Murray (Melissa) along with his sister Anne Mary Ronan, his seven grandchildren, Joanna, Jackie, Brent, Kyle, Anna, Melissa and Arianna, and several dear nieces and nephews.\n\nHis children and grandchildren were his pride and joy and if you ever had the good fortune of speaking with him, you certainly heard all about them. He loved vacationing with his family including annual beach trips where some of his family's warmest memories were made. He was even looking forward to a beach week later this month, and a family trip to Scotland in November.\n\nDavid always ran into someone he knew wherever he went, even overseas; a testament to the man he was. While we will miss his presence every day, we will honor him by carrying on as he would - cold drink in hand, laughing together, and making friends wherever we go. We ask you to do the same.\n\nDavid's family would also like to thank the Hampton Police Department for their response, assistance and kindness.\n\nVisiting hours to honor and remember David will be held on Thursday July 18, 2024 from 5 to 8 p.m. at Remick & Gendron Funeral Home-Crematory, 811 Lafayette Road, Hampton, NH 03842. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 10 a.m. on Friday, July 19, 2024 at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church, 289 Lafayette Road in Hampton. Burial with U.S. Air Force Honors will take place at St. Joseph's Cemetery in Amesbury, MA immediately following.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in his memory can be made to Tunnels to Towers, 2361 Hylan Boulevard, Staten Island, NY 10306 or online at ."
