David Murray

The career of Oakland-born tenor saxophonist David Murray (1955) went through at least three well-defined phases after he moved to New York in 1975: a confrontational free-jazz phase in which he developed a wildly dissonant style of playing, an erudite phase in which he focused on composition rather than performance, and a phase in which his performance and composition came together into an elegant (as opposed to furious) display of idiosyncratic languages at the instrument that also mirrored a rediscovery of jazz tradition.
