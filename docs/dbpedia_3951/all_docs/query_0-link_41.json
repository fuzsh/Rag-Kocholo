        "text": "My name is Humira karim, I belong to village Damas, Dist Ghizer. I am a Ph.D. student at H. E. J Research Institute of Chemistry, University of Karachi.\n\nMy success story will not be completed without mentioning the contributions of my visionary father. Despite of having limited resources, my father always supported and motivated me to get higher education. He taught me the importance of hard work and perseverance and, under his guidance, I always have strived for excellence.\n\nAfter passing 7th grade from Diamond Jubilee School Damas. I was lucky to get admission in Aga Khan Higher Secondary School Sherqilla. The 3 years’ journey at that institute has great impact in my life. I was living in hostel there and, I learned and experienced so many things which helped me to groom my personality. I successfully finished my matriculation from there and, then I went to Aga khan Higher Secondary School Hunza for my intermediate studies. In the year 2014, I completed my intermediate degree with good grades.\n\nIn 2015, I decided to take admission in Karakoram International University (KIU) at the department of chemistry. During that time many of my relatives and friends were shocked by my decision. They all tried to convince me to not take admission in KIU. Because they have a bad image and reputation of KIU in their mind. As I always had a good academic record so, they were saying that KIU is not good for you, you should apply for some other universities etc. But I stood tall against all these adversities with strong determination, consistent hard work and confidence. In reality, I also did not have a good perception about KIU and, I only took admission because I have had believe in my own abilities. After joining and actually knowing about KIU especially my department “Department of Chemistry” I became satisfied. The teachers were very sincere, competent and supportive. It was totally opposite of what I had heard of and a very famous phrase fits it well which says “ghar ki murgi daal baraber”. KIU made me able to fulfill my dreams and achieve my goals, by providing the platforms to improve my profile.\n\nTo sum up, I had a wonderful undergraduate journey at Karakoram International University (KIU). I completed bachelors of science (B. Sc) in organic chemistry with a good CGPA and I am a silver medalist of KIU. During my undergraduate studies, I was selected as a principal candidate for (global UGRAD student exchange program) which is a non-degree fully funded program sponsored by US states department. I was placed in Saginaw Valley State University(SVSU) in Michigan state. It was a phenomenal experience in a true sense and it is once in a lifetime opportunity. I studied courses and completed 48 h of community service in USA.\n\nGlobal Undergraduate Exchange Program in Pakistan – Global UGRAD-Pakistan – Spring 2018 Semester\n\nSoon after graduation, I secured admission at H. E. J Research Institute of Chemistry (HEJRIC) in M. Phil on merit base, after competing with students from across Pakistan. I consider HEJRIC due to the high quality of research, world class facilities and reserved stipend. I did research in the field of peptide chemistry and completed my M. Phil degree with highest CGPA in my class. In the year 2022, I took admission in Ph. D., in the same institute. I have availed HEC Indigenous Scholarship on open merit for my M. Phil and Ph. D studies.\n\nI have won poster prizes in international and national level poster competitions. I won the 2nd prize at Commonwealth Chemistry Posters event, where 180 posters from 31 countries were presented. I also won a poster prize at 15th International Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry at the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences(ICCBS), University of Karachi.\n\nReceiving the Commonwealth Chemistry Poster certificate from the Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary, Director of the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), and COMSTECH Coordinator General, while my honorable research supervisor Prof. Dr. Farzana Shaheen was also present on the occasion.\n\nReceiving certificate of poster from Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary, Director of the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), and COMSTECH Coordinator General, at 15th International Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry at the International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences(ICCBS), University of Karachi.\n\nCurrently, I am in the 2nd year of my Ph. D studies and I am doing research on the synthesis and applications of peptides and peptide-functionalized nanoparticles. Alhamdulillah I am pursuing my degree smoothly. At the end, I would like to thank my family and teachers who have been a constant source of support and encouragement.\n\nThank you.\n\nSyed Sibt-e-Hassan’s remarkable odyssey commences in the distant enclave of Minapin in Gilgit Baltistan.
