This new government values their contribution ‚Äì to our universities, to our communities, to our country,‚Äù said UK Secretary of State for Education Bridget Phillipson in a speech today at the ‚ÄòEmbassy Network Conference. ‚ÄúFor too long international students have been treated as political footballs, not valued guests‚Ä¶ Their fees welcomed, but their presence resented. Exploited for cheap headlines, not cherished for all they bring to our communities. ‚ÄúThis government will take a different approach and we will speak clearly.‚Äù This is a wonderful and welcome shift in rhetoric from the new The Labour Party government in the UK. AND there‚Äôs a clear statement on visa-study work visas: ‚ÄúWe will do everything we can to help [international students] succeed, she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we offer the opportunity to remain in the UK on a graduate visa for two years after their studies end ‚Äì or threefor PhDs ‚Äì to work, to live, and to contribute.‚Äù Read the full speech here: https://lnkd.in/eXwDwVHC #studyabroad #intled #studyUK #weareinternational Universities UK International"
