        "text": "Prices in the UK rose 2.2% in the 12 months to July, up from 2% for June.\n\nThe Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%.\n\nInflation is the increase in the price of something over time.\n\nFor example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%.\n\nThe prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThis virtual \"basket of goods\" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with vinyl records and air fryers added in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed.\n\nThe ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation.\n\nThe main inflation measure is called the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), external.\n\nThe latest figures show that CPI rose by 2.2% in the year to July, largely due to prices of gas and electricity falling by less than they did a year before.\n\nInflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.\n\nInflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nIt then remained above the Bank of England's 2% target partly because of high food prices.\n\nAlthough these have now dropped back, some parts of the economy, like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers - are still seeing more significant price rises.\n\nWorker shortages have also made it more expensive to find and keep staff., external\n\nThe Bank of England uses interest rates to try and keep inflation at 2%.\n\nWhen inflation was well above that target, it increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.\n\nThe idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.\n\nIn turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.\n\nBut it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.\n\nFor example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.\n\nBusinesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.\n\nIn August, the Bank of England cut rates to 5%.\n\nHowever, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned: \"We need to make sure inflation stays low and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much.\"\n\nAlthough the headline CPI figure is close to the 2% target, the Bank also considers other measures of inflation, external, such as \"core inflation\", when deciding how to change rates.\n\nCore inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, but it was 3.3% in July - down from 3.5% in June, which suggests price rises are still an issue.\n\nIn its latest forecast for the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that persistent inflation in countries including the UK and US might mean interest rates have to stay \"higher for even longer\".\n\nMany other countries have also seen inflation and higher interest rates.\n\nAt 2.2%, UK inflation is below the rate for countries using the euro, which was 2.5% in June, down from 2.6% in May.\n\nDespite the slight rise in inflation, in June the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%, the first drop in five years.\n\nIn the 12 months to June, US inflation dropped to 3%, down from 3.3% in the year to May.\n\nBut at its June meeting the US central bank kept its key interest rates at between 5.25% and 5.5% - unchanged since July 2023."
