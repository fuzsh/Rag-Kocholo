Within this context, the OPMC provides its millions of visitors with event programming and commercial services that may affect the noise environment.\n\nWith a view to pursuing its mission while taking into consideration the tourist and residential vocation of the historic Old Port neighbourhood, the OPMC had adopted a Noise Management Policy that defines standards and criteria for events and merchants, and other enterprises that affect the noise environment at the Old Port and its surroundings.\n\nThis policy applies to the following :\n\n- Sound created by unique events, whether on stage or not, including outdoor music concerts, whether amplified or not, and;\n\n- Sound emanating from merchants and their outdoor terraces, including amplified and non-amplified music.\n\n- No music, whether amplified or not, coming from unique outdoor events and/or from establishments and/or commercial terraces shall be heard from rue de la Commune in an area bound by the Mills Bridge to the West, rue de la Commune to the North, the Clock Tower Beach to the East, and the Saint Lawrence River to the South, unless prior authorization to the contrary is obtained from the OPMC.\n\n- As required, the OPMC will measure sound using devices made for that purpose, for the purpose of controlling and verifying adherence to established standards. A representative of the OPMC is authorized to take these measurements, and has the power to intervene with the Producers or Merchants at any time if the standards are not respected.\n\n- Producers of unique events and Merchants must adhere to this policy, and must submit themselves to any decision made by representatives of the OPMC while events are being held or during normal proceedings.\n\n- Any breach of this policy or failure to adhere to the directives issued by OPMC personnel shall be considered a failing, and may be subject to the sanctions outlined in the agreement signed with the OPMC."
