It is the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland's principal seaport and is also the centre of the country's fourth-largest metropolitan area. \\n\\nThe city lies on the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay (of the Baltic Sea), in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia, spa town of Sopot, and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (\\\"Trójmiasto\\\"), with a population approaching 1.4 million. Gdańsk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the Pomerania region of Northern Poland. \\n\\nGdańsk is the capital of Gdańsk Pomerania and the largest city of Kashubia. With its origins as a Polish stronghold erected in the 980s by Mieszko I of Poland, the city's history is complex, with periods of Polish rule, periods of Prussian or German rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a \\\"free city\\\". Between the world wars, the Free City of Danzig was in a customs union with Poland and was located between German East Prussia and the so-called Polish Corridor. \\n\\nGdańsk lies at the mouth of the Motława River, connected to the Leniwka, a branch in the delta of the nearby Vistula River, which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gdańsk with the Polish capital, Warsaw. Together with the nearby port of Gdynia, Gdańsk is also an important industrial center. In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town, and in the 14th and 15th centuries a member of the Hanseatic League. 1. Which bay is Gdansk on?\\n2.

Scroll down for video. Accolade: Three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day Lewis is to receive a knighthood. Day-Lewis, the son of former poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis and actress Jill Balcon, has been nominated five times for the best actor Oscar and has a reputation for taking his method acting very seriously. He is said to have lived in a tent on a deserted Texan oil field during the making of There Will Be Blood. To play Guildford Four member Gerry Conlon in the film In The Name Of The Father, he spent two days in a prison cell without food and water. While shooting The Ballad Of Jack And Rose, he chose to live apart from his wife Rebecca Miller and their two children - because she was the director and he was playing a conflicted family man. And he chose to stay in character as fearsome Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting even when the cameras stopped rolling on the Martin Scorsese epic Gangs Of New York.

PUBLISHED:. 14:38 EST, 13 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 15:36 EST, 13 November 2013. Famed Raiders tight end turned television sports broadcaster Todd Christensen died at 57 in a Utah hospital on Wednesday after suffering complications during a liver transplant. The two-time Super Bowl champ's death was announced this morning by Christensen's alma mater, the school that would launch his impressive football career, Brigham Young University. Liver disease was among a number of illnesses Christensen reportedly battled prior to his death. RIP: Famed Raiders tight end Todd Christensen died Wednesday at the age of 57 after suffering complications during surgery. Christensen's son, Toby Christensen, said his father died Wednesday morning at Intermountain Medical Center near his home in Alpine, Utah. 'I've been receiving hundreds of texts, Facebook postings and emails — from everybody with a story about my dad,' Toby Christensen said. Christensen was a devout Mormon who didn't drink, and his family believes his liver problems started 25 years ago after a \\\"botched\\\" gall bladder operation, his son told The Associated Press. Chosen in the second round of the 1978 NFL draft, Christensen was first a Dallas Cowboy. He began the 1979 season with the New York Giants but midway through the season he'd join the team that made him a star. The Oregon raised Pennsylvania native helped lead the Raiders to Super Bowl victory twice, once in 1981 and again in 1984. Christensen, at 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, never fit the Raiders' untamed mold. He was a thoughtful son of a professor, and even read his own poetry at a Super Bowl press conference. He later self-published three books of poetry. In 1983, he set a tight end single season record when he caught 92 receptions. Three years later, he broke his own record by catching 95. Legend: The 57-year-old (seen at left in 2002 and at right in 1987) was a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Raiders and appeared in the Pro Bowl on five occasions during his 11 year NFL career. Gladiator: In addition to his football career and stints in sports broadcasting, Christensen (center at left) was even briefly a host of the over-the-top American Gladiators television show. 'Our condolences, thoughts, and prayers go out to the family of Todd Christensen. Great player, great guy,' tweeted BYU Football. As a college baller, Christensen led the BYU Cougars in receiving three times between 1974 and 1977, ending his career at the school with 152 receptions. 'He had great skill,' BYU football Hall of Fame coach LaVell Edwards told the Daily Herald of Provo, Utah. 'He ran the ball well and he caught the ball extremely well. He had excellent ability in all areas and those are the things that stand out.' In addition to his Super Bowl rings, Christensen played in the Pro Bowl for five of his 11 NFL seasons. After his departure from pro football in 1988, Christensen's resume took some unexpected turns. He had a brief flirtation with Major League Baseball when he hit a home run during a workout with the Oakland A's in 1990. He even briefly appeared as a host of the over-the-top American Gladiators television series. Christensen appeared in other television projects like Married with Children and acted as a sports analyst for both ESPN and NBC. Record setting: Seen here mid-game in 1985, Christensen's career saw him break the single season reception record twice. He caught 92 receptions in 1983. Three years later, he caught 95.\\nWhat are the important parts of this article?\\nImportant parts:\" }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The former Raiders star tight end died from complications during a surgical procedure, according to his alma mater Brigham Young University.

In addition to the extra charge for meat, she insisted we could not have pico AND sauce in our burritos without incurring another extra charge. I didn't even ask about adding corn or onions to my order because I'm not a millionaire, folks! Price aside, the burrito girl should really have worn a hairnet because I found a hair in one of my last bites. I wonder if there was an extra charge for it?

The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior d\\\\u00e9cor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad. Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed. I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since. As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional \\\"daily soup\\\" is appreciated. The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear. The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own. Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it. Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared. Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.\\n\\n\\ninput: Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\noutput: I've only been to this Starbucks location four or five times, but the times that I have gone haven't been that great.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\\"legitimate target\\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. \\n\\nDoes the response \\\"Francis drake was on it\\\" correctly answer the question \\\"Why was the Algarve considered a legitimate target when it was attacked by Francis Drake?\\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput: no\\n\\n\\nInput: \\\"Femme\\\" is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\\"Lust of the White Serpant\\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\\"disturbed and agitated\\\" by her \\\"ethereal beauty\\\". In \\\"Eternal Prisoner,\\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\\". \\n\\nDoes the response \\\"A sexually attractive prisoner\\\" correctly answer the question \\\"How is Madame White Snack characterized?\\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput: no\\n\\n\\nInput: California lags far behind comparable states in funding legal services for the poor, a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal needs of the state's poor and lowerincome residents are being addressed. That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \\\"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\\\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \\\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children. Half the nation's increase in poverty in the 1990s, when the number of poor jumped 30 percent, occurred in California, and nearly 25 percent of the nation's poverty increase occurred in Los Angeles County alone. Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages. The commission's report, \\\"The Path to Equal Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\\" examined how the legal needs of the state's poor have changed in the last five years as well as both the shortcomings of the justice system and the improvements during that period. Despite increases in state funding to meet the legal needs of the poor, low interest rates (which have reduced the IOLTA fund), high unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains. \\n\\nDoes the response \\\"New York State\\\" correctly answer the question \\\"High unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains in which state?\\\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput:\" }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"no\" } ]\n\nflan_v2\n\nflan_v2_22\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Concepts: coffee, dessert, plate\\nA: 2 plates with different desserts with a cup of coffee. \\nQ: Keywords: time, train, tree\\nWhat is a sentence that includes all these keywords?\\n\\nA: a small juniper has been trained over time to appear like a gnarled tree in the wild .\\nProduce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: day, fishing, spend\\n\\nfishing from the large pier is a favorite way to spend your day .\\n[Q]: Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: carve, relief, wall\\n[A]: mythological being carved in relief on the walls\\nCONCEPTS: sunrise, surfer, water\\n\\nGEN: a surfer enters the water just after sunrise under cloudy skies .\\nQ: Keywords: fill, pharmacist, prescription\\nWhat is a sentence that includes all these keywords?\\n\\nA:\" }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"A pharmacist fills out prescriptions\" } ]\n\nflan_v2\n\nflan_v2_23\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"QUESTION: answer this: when did the chinese first use gunpowder as a weapon??\\n\\nANS: 904\\n\\ninput: What is the answer to this question? who is the original artist of proud mary?\\n\\noutput: John Fogerty\\n\\nIn: when did the supreme court rule that bus segregation was unconstitutional??\\n\\nOut: December 1956\\n\\nPlease answer this: who is going to be in the world cup final?\\n\\nFrance\\n\\nQ: Answer this question:\\n\\nwhere did the ancient civilization of sumer develop??\\n\\nA: modern-day southern Iraq\\n\\nQuestion: when did the first episode of malcolm in the middle air?\\n\\nAnswer:\" }, { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"January 9, 2000\" } ]\n\nflan_v2\n\nflan_v2_24\n\n[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Write an article based on this \\\"Blanch and peel the tomatoes.

While the water is heating up, fill a large bowl with equal quantities of cold water and ice. When the water boils, place the tomatoes into the pot and boil them for about a minute, long enough to loosen and wrinkle the skins. Remove the tomatoes with a slotted spoon and plunge them into the ice water. Leave the tomatoes in the cold water for 30 seconds to a minute. This will stop the cooking process immediately and cool the tomatoes. Blanching makes it easier to peel fruits and vegetables. Peel the skin off the tomatoes with your fingers. If you want, you can also squeeze the seeds out if you don’t want them in the sauce. Transfer eight of the tomatoes to a blender and puree them until smooth. With the remaining two tomatoes, chop them roughly into small chunks. Melt the oil and butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the onion, pepper, carrot, and garlic. Sauté for five to 10 minutes, until the onions turn translucent and begin to turn golden brown. You can substitute any or all of the green pepper for red, yellow, or orange pepper. You can also add five to 10 chopped mushrooms to the sauce, a chopped zucchini, or a small head of broccoli, chopped. Pour in the tomato puree, the chopped tomatoes, all the herbs, the wine, and the two whole celery stalks. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat. The celery stalks don’t need to be chopped because you will remove them from the sauce before serving. When the sauce comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. Simmer the sauce for about two hours, then add the tomato paste. Stir in the tomato paste and continue simmering the sauce for another two hours. You don’t have to simmer the sauce for the full four hours, but cooking it for the full length of time will yield a thick, rich, and flavorful sauce. Cooking the sauce for one to two hours will result in a sauce that’s slightly runnier and not quite as rich. When the sauce has simmered for four hours or the desired amount of time, remove the celery stalks with a pair of tongs, and use a slotted spoon to remove the bay leaf. Serve the sauce hot with pasta, rice, or vegetables.\\n\\nWrite an article based on this \\\"Use an Apple TV. Set up AirPlay on the TV. Connect your iPod to the same wireless network.

Lawyers seek evidence to prove every factual statement, and assume nothing is true without proof. You may have had experience with a young child who asked “why?” after everything you said. Although that can get annoying, it’s also part of thinking like a lawyer. Lawyers refer to why a law was made as its ‘‘policy.’’ The policy behind a law can be used to argue that new facts or circumstances should also fall under the law. For example, suppose that in 1935, the city council enacted a law prohibiting vehicles in the public park. The law was enacted primarily for safety concerns, after a small child was hit by a car. In 2014, the city council was asked to consider whether the 1935 statute prohibited drones. Are drones vehicles? Would prohibiting drones advance the law’s policy? Why? If you’re asking those questions (and recognizing arguments that can be made on both sides), you’re thinking like a lawyer. Thinking like a lawyer also means not taking anything for granted. Understanding why something happened, or why a certain law was enacted, enables you to apply the same rationale to other fact patterns and reach a logical conclusion. Legal issues are seldom black and white. Life is too complex for legislators to account for every possibility when they write a law. Ambiguities allow for flexibility, so laws don’t have to be rewritten every time a new scenario comes along. For example, the Constitution has been interpreted to relate to electronic surveillance, a technological advance the Framers couldn’t have imagined. Much of thinking like a lawyer involves being comfortable with nuances and gray areas.

The first time we went, we became instant fans and took our friends out to breakfast here when arrived into Vegas a few days later. We were so excited to bring them there but to our dismay, the line was so long and we saw several large parties of 8 get seated before our party of 4 even though they arrived after us. When we finally were seated, we were very honest and told our waiter that we only had 45 minutes left to order and get our food because we had a show to see at the MGM. We took a chance that he respond with an attitude given ours when we were finally seated but he remained so calm and understanding the whole time. It totally made up for the long wait.

Both my mother and sister chose the Madison's burger for their main - the burgers were grey - way overcooked and very salty. They also had a house salad with some kind of a ginger dressing - it was ok. I ordered the Oriental Chicken Salad - which was swimming in dressing and the chicken was also very salty. I couldn't bring myself to eat the greens. I know this is a chain but come on - not good enough. One positive note was our waiter who was very charming and attentive. He even brought over a brownie with sparklers for my Mom, which was very sweet. All in all meh.

Her younger brother, Randy Moffitt, became a Major League Baseball pitcher, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.\\nContext: In 1982, King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at Wimbledon. In her third round match with Tanya Harford of South Africa, King was down 7-5, 5-4 (40-0) before saving three match points to win the second set 7-6(2) and then the third set 6-3. King said in her post-match press conference, \\\"I can't recall the previous time I have been so close to defeat and won. When I was down 4-5 and love-40, I told myself, 'You have been here 21 years, so use that experience and hang on.'\\\" In the fourth round, King upset sixth-seeded Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets. King then upset third-seeded Tracy Austin in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to become the oldest female semifinalist at Wimbledon since Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers in 1920. This was King's first career victory over Austin after five defeats and reversed the result of their 1979 Wimbledon quarterfinal. King said in her post-match press conference, \\\"Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2-0 in the third set and the '2' seemed to be getting bigger and bigger.

King was down a set and 2-1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match. King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15-40 in the second and fourth games. She reached the semifinals in her final appearance at Wimbledon, losing to Andrea Jaeger 6-1, 6-1 after beating Kathy Jordan in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round. Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger's, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, \\\"I'm not going to sweat in this match.\\\" King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days after a straight-sets victory in the final against Alycia Moulton.

The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian.\\nContext: On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them. On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\\"Memogate\\\" and \\\"Rathergate.\\\" Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather's retirement was hastened by this incident. On September 20, 2007, Rather was interviewed on Larry King Live commenting \\\"Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent, much less a forgery. ...

He died in hospital later that night. \\n\\nBystanders said Bishop's face was \\\"screwed up in rage\\\" as he lashed out with the two knives, the Press Association reported. \\n\\nDays before the attack, the actor had finished filming on \\\"Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince,\\\" due for international release in July, in which he played the role of Marcus Belby. He was set to reprise the part in future \\\"Harry Potter\\\" films. \\n\\nKnox's father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been \\\"living the dream,\\\" PA said. \\n\\nProsecutor Brian Altman told the court that the young actor's promising life was ended by a \\\"habitual knife carrier\\\" who believed stabbing people was an \\\"occupational hazard\\\" and had previous convictions for knife crime. \\n\\nBishop is due to be sentenced on Thursday. 1.

Bob Crossley, a human-resources expert notices this in the job applications that come across his desk every day. \\\"It's amazing how many candidates _ themselves,\\\" he says. \\n\\n\\\"Resumes arrive with faults. Some candidates don't bother to spell the company's name correctly. Once I see a mistake, I cross out the candidates,\\\" Crossley concludes. \\\"If they cannot take care of these details, why should we trust them with a job?\\\" \\n\\nCan we pay too much attention to details? Perfectionists struggle over little things at the cost of something larger they work toward. \\\"To keep from losing the forest for the trees,\\\" says Charles Garfield, the professor at the University of California, San Francisco, \\\"We must constantly ask ourselves how the details we're working on fit into the larger picture. If they don't, we should drop them and move to something else.\\\" \\n\\nGarfield compares this process to his work as a computer scientist at NASA. \\\"The Apollo II moon launch was slightly off course 90 percent of the time,\\\" says Garfield. \\\"But a successful landing was still likely because we knew the exact position of our goal. This allowed us to make adjustments as necessary.\\\" Knowing where to go helps us judge the importance of every task we undertake. \\n\\nToo often we believe what accounts for others' success is some special secret or a lucky break. But rarely is success so mysterious. Again and again, we see that by doing little things within our grasp well, large rewards follow. 1. Who is Bob Crosskey?\\n2. what does he sazy?\\n3.
