        "text": "For students interested in hands-on activities and learning something new while “on the job,” the Fairview High School engineering classes are for you. The latest example of these attributes is a project Mr. Ray Breninger recently introduced to his Engineering 3 students.\n\n“My Engineering 3 students recently designed and 3D-printed some caps for a table in the concession stand at the football stadium,” explained Breininger. “Daniel Vogelsong and Payton Kimpel used their tinker cad to design and create the necessary 3D STL files to be printed in the maker space.”\n\nTo better understand 3D STL files, this term is defined by Adobe as “a file format commonly used for 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD). The name STL is an acronym that stands for stereolithography — a popular 3D printing technology.”\n\n“Mrs. Beverly Singer made this request right before school started this year,” continued Breininger. “I used this project request as an opportunity to review the engineering design process for these guys. They used the review of the engineering design process as they are currently preparing to choose a year-long project to complete for the course. They will develop a community project from start to finish to either build something or pitch an idea using the engineering design process and all they have learned over the last two engineering courses.”\n\nBoth Kimpel and Vogelsong agreed that maybe they had initially underestimated the complexity of this project but learned a great deal from it.\n\n“What surprised me while completing my task was how much extra time was needed,” admitted Vogelsong. “I have learned from this unit how prototyping is essential to the engineering design process. When designing something, you have to have direct and exact measurements, (which) can be really helpful and consume less time.”\n\n“What surprised me is the number of failed prototypes we had,” stated Kimpel, echoing much of Vogelsong’s sentiments. “We had to remeasure three times and had to make six different prints to make it right and able to prevent people from getting cut by the edges of the table. I learned how to use customer needs to create a product (using) trial and error.”\n\nAnother big objective of engineering class and something that Breininger preaches often is that successful projects frequently require second and third go-arounds. Again, both students concurred with their teacher’s prospective.\n\nNoted Vogelsong: “If I had an opportunity to change a procedure during the development of the device, I would make sure my model was scaled correctly with precise measurements. Something else that I would have done differently would be further testing the capabilities and limits of the caps.”\n\n“I would use the correct measurements and to scale the 3D print in a way of using the tolerances of the 3D printer,” claimed Kimpel about another shot at this project.\n\nWhen asked about his experience in the engineering pathway, Vogelsong sang its praises.\n\n“The engineering courses in Fairview Jr. High and High School provide and ensure physical and digital creative freedom and development for learning minds. If anybody is looking forward to an inventive pathway in the future, the engineering courses should be worth a try.”\n\nIn the picture below, Kimpel and Vogelsong pose with their finished product.\n\nA handful of motivated students with a vision. Sometimes, that’s all it takes to bring about major positive changes. Such is the case at Fairview HS where a student-led initiative from the recent TRIBE Challenge resulted in a sparkling facelift for the varsity girls’ locker room during the summer of 2023. The TRIBE Challenge, a product of the school’s PBIS program, is a list of opportunities for students to make a difference in their school and community.\n\nAmong the leaders of this project was junior Kayla Mavis, who did most of the initial communicating with school officials and played a major role in seeing this project through.\n\n“As student-athletes, we are in the locker room daily, and when we saw it was an option for the TRIBE Challenge, we took the opportunity to make it more comfortable and cleaner for ourselves and all female athletes,” explained Mavis about what motivated her to take on this project.\n\nThe list of projects was basically three-fold: Tear out the small, unusual lockers, apply a fresh coat of paint on the walls and lockers to be saved, and replace the old lockers with large cubbies able to hold today’s oversized gym bags. The group, which largely consisted of Mavis, Jayci Schooley, Kortney Grinnell, Natalie Timbrook, Summer Hiler, and Cheyenne Zeedyk, made it happen over the course of three-four months.\n\nHowever, before they touched one locker or applied one coat of paint, the students took it upon themselves to fund as much of the project as possible with a successful car wash held in early June at the elementary school. With a hard-earned $1,400 in hand, they set out on their mission.\n\nRemoving the lockers was the first step, and with the help of teachers Mrs. Lauren Hurtig and Mrs. Kristi List and community members Mrs. Jenny Mavis and Mr. John List, the girls got busy. After removing a large number of screws and wriggling the lockers out of place, they sent them off to be recycled.\n\nThen it came time for the big project: painting the walls and lockers. After conferring with experienced painters, they put together their list of supplies, spent several days covering areas not to be painted, then applied one coat of primer and two coats of paint on all of the walls and lockers that were kept. This part of the job turned out to be very cumbersome, but they kept their promise to both themselves and school officials that they would see it through.\n\nWhen asked if she ever thought they had bitten off more than they could chew, Schooley stated with a smile: “Yes kind of. I think going into it we were pretty confident, but when we really started and realized what we were doing, I definitely questioned if it was a smart idea or not.”\n\nShe’s definitely glad she kept going and gave credit to the main group of workers.\n\n“This would not have happened if it weren't for Kayla Mavis, Kortney Grinnell, Natalie Timbrook, Summer Hiler, Cheyenne Zeedyk and me to step up and take the initiative. We also would have never been able to do this without Mrs. Hurtig.”\n\nThe final project was to install new cubbies, and the group solicited the help of a local furniture company. Not having quite enough money to complete the project as needed, Mavis and her mother Jenny reached out to Mr. Arnold, who noted that the board of education would cover the balance. Thus, the project was finished on September 23.\n\nConcluded Mavis with a big grin on her face: “We really appreciate the help from several adults in the community, especially Mrs. Hurtig. We couldn't have done any of it without her support throughout the project.”\n\nShown in the picture below (left to right) are Kortney Grinnell, Jayci Schooley, Kayla Mavis, Summer Hiler, and Natalie Timbrook in front of a set of spruced up lockers and beautifully painted walls.\n\nAlthough earthquakes are not a regular occurrence in Northwest Ohio, many local residents do spend time traveling to other parts of the world where earthquakes happen more frequently. With that understanding, Mrs. Rayna Moore incorporated earthquake preparedness into a recent physical science unit dealing with energy and forces.\n\n“With recent severe weather conditions and natural disasters around the world, it seems you can never be too prepared,” calmly stated Moore.\n\nAs part of her lessons, Moore detailed the story of her own personal earthquake experience in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The year was 2013, and she was traveling with the company Feld Entertainment as an assistant electrician on the show “Three Classic Fairytales,” which consisted of abbreviated versions of Snow White, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast. During the very last show of the tour, when the seven dwarves were singing “Hi Ho, Hi Ho,” a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck. The 13,000-pound set began swinging back and forth, and panicked audience members fled the theater. Moore and her soon-to-be fiancé were staged in the lighting booth, where they were running the lighting and audio aspects of the show, when they suddenly realized there was nowhere to go. However, they managed to stay calm and patiently await instructions from the production director. Fortunately, after taking quick action, all members of the cast or crew were unharmed. The show was able to resume in a timely manner, and all the princesses found their “happily ever-after.”\n\nAfter sharing these harrowing details, Moore turned to her students and asked this simple question: “What should you do in the event of an earthquake?” Answer: “Drop, cover, and hold on!” she exclaimed. She continued with more specifics and outlined the following plan:\n\n1. Drop to your knees, so the tremor cannot knock you off your feet.\n\n2. Cover, especially your head and neck, by ducking under the closest, sturdiest piece of furniture.\n\n3. Hold on to your cover to prevent you from shaking away from it.\n\nMoore’s classes then practiced an earthquake drill using those techniques, knowing that anyone in this dire situation can never be too prepared.\n\nFreshmen Jonathon Huffman and Kaden Kennedy were two of the students who studied and practiced the drills. When asked what he learned, Huffman stated that everyone should “stay in a safe place no matter what until the shaking is over (and) that you need to put your hand over your head.” He also mentioned getting objects that are non-harmful to surround the outside of the table openings.\n\nKennedy echoed many of Huffman’s sentiments.\n\n“I learned that I had to cover my head and to stay safe undercover,” he explained. When asked what he might do differently the next time, he smiled and said, ”I might act like I’m yelling louder.”\n\nPictured below are Kennedy (left) and Huffman (right) seen in action.\n\nWinter may officially be coming to an end in less than a week, but the hallways outside the Fairview Elementary School art room remain full of amazing color and beautiful artistry created by the fifth-grade students as part of the annual “Winter Animals in Chalk” unit. Inspired by the work of fellow Ohioan Charley Harper, best known for his highly stylized wildlife prints, posters, and book illustrations, Mrs. Denise Pannell’s students did what many of them didn’t think they could do – draw and color amazing lifelike wildlife pictures.\n\n“The requirements for this project were to realistically create an animal in a winter scene,” explained Pannell about the primary objective for this unit. “They were given the choice of many animal photos from which to use as a reference while creating their art.”\n\nTo kick off the unit, Pannell introduced her students to the work of Harper, who created stylized drawings of animals. His techniques allow students of all ability levels to perform at higher levels than which they believed they could.\n\n“He reduced the animals to their basic shapes while keeping the integrity of each characteristic,” noted Pannell about the strategies used by the former Cincinnati resident. “The students were shown how to look at a photograph of an animal and use the basic shapes that they saw to form the basis for their animal drawings.\n\n“From there, they used a pencil eraser to draw out these shapes – which wipes right off – on their black papers,” continued Pannell. “Once they had the basic shapes outlined in the correct proportion, they were asked use a pencil to add details, such as markings on the animals, eyes, and items found in the background.”\n\nThe next step was to use a black oil pastel to outline their animal and a white oil pastel to outline any snow.\n\n“These lines acted as a barrier to keep the chalk pastel from mixing together too much,” explained Pannell. “The students were eager to add color to their animals using colored chalk, and we discussed making their animals as realistic as possible, especially in the texture of the fur and feathers. Finally, the students filled the skies using two colors of chalk, which were blended together and added snowflakes using oil pastel.”\n\nThis unit, which generally occupies most of February, is one Pannell highly anticipates each school year.\n\n“This has become one of my favorite projects to do with fifth graders, not only because the results are spectacular, but I love seeing the look of accomplishment and pride in each student’s face as they finish their art!” exclaimed Pannell with pride beaming from her face. In addition, students often exceed their own expectations.\n\n“I always get a few students who look at the examples and swear that they absolutely CANNOT draw an animal in this style, but once I show them all my tricks and tips, it usually seems to click with them. I remind them that everything can be broken down in to lines and shapes when trying to draw. After all, how did we learn to write our names? It’s all lines and shapes.”\n\nProudly displaying the top art work (left to right in the picture below) are fifth graders Kadilyhne England, Emmy Anderson, Liberty Becker, and Chevy Orr. These students’ artwork, as well as other Apache Kid Artists, will have their work on display at Just Be Original Fine Arts Academy in the Defiance Northtowne Mall for the month of April.\n\nNorwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen once said, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” and for nearly two hundred years these famous words have rung true time and time again. Of course, without the use of cameras, these words would have far less meaning. But who really knows how cameras actually work? This was part of the inspiration behind Mr. Ray Breininger’s recent Engineering 1 lesson.\n\n“My Engineering 1 students recently completed the Pinhole Camera Unit,” stated Breininger, now in his sixth year introducing students to the world of engineering.\n\nAnother objective from this unit was to combine various measurements to accommodate individuals with fewer skills.\n\nExplained Breininger: “Students created a pinhole camera from used shoe boxes. They discovered the engineering design process as they created their pinhole cameras to meet both quantitative design specifications and qualitative requirements for usability by people with limited dexterity in their hands and wrists.”\n\nOn the last day of the unit, students posed for a picture using the camera designed by freshmen Gabe Cline, James Smith, and Kalvin Woodring. Smith expressed a lot of satisfaction about what he learned as well as the end result.\n\n“We learned how to calculate the camera's distance to the object as well as the importance of a light-tight box,” noted Cline about one of the objectives. “It was a fun lesson that I think had a good turnout.”\n\nStudents also learned new vocabulary words, most notably parts of camera that they had never really considered prior to this unit. As an example, Woodring drew attention to the aperture, which is defined as “a space through which light passes in an optical or photographic instrument, especially the variable opening by which light enters a camera.”\n\n“This lesson taught me very much about how cameras work,” explained Woodring. “I found the way film paper works by burning with sunlight very interesting.”\n\nWith most projects or lessons, both trial & error and timelines become factors in the equations. Such was the case here as well. When asked what they might do differently if given the opportunity to complete this lesson again, Woodring detailed a well-thought-out response.\n\n“The way we light-sealed the camera was very inefficient and led to redesigns later on. So, if we did the project over again, I would have spent more time on sealing at the beginning,” deemed Woodring.\n\nFor Smith, it was about the pinhole itself. “I would have designed a smaller pinhole for a career picture,” also noting that the smaller the pinhole, the clearer the image becomes.\n\nBreininger was pleased by his students’ efforts and enthusiasm for this lesson.\n\n“Our last day, students asked to take a class picture,” noted Breininger, as evidence as to how excited his students were about the success of their projects.\n\nShown in the pictures below are Cline, Smith, and Woodring (left picture), who developed the camera (center picture) that took the picture of the Engineering 1 students (right).\n\nWhen it comes to essay writing competitions, the word \"dynasty\" doesn’t come up often. However, one could make the case that for the VFW Post 3360 Patriot’s Pen essay contest, Fairview MS has a dynasty going. For the ninth time in the past thirteen years, Fairview took home the gold, silver, and bronze medals in this competition, held annually and open to all middle school students in Defiance County.\n\nThe theme for this year’s competition was \"My Pledge to Our Veterans.\"\n\n“Each year, the VFW reaches out to the language arts teachers in the Defiance County Schools about the Patriot's Pen Contest,” explained Mrs. Tracy Robinson, who coordinates the event for her eighth-grade students. “The prompt given each year is on a patriotic topic, and the students are asked to interpret it and write a 300-400 word essay on the topic. My classes have been involved with this contest for the last 13 years, since 2009.”\n\nFor Sammy Mavis, it’s a family affair, whose older sisters all competed in this event as middle school students. Now she’s followed in her older sister’s footsteps by claiming the top place.\n\n“My sisters did Patriot’s Pen when they were in school, and I remember my oldest sister, Cassie, winning,” stated Mavis. “All my sisters who wrote the essay in previous years got picked by Mrs. Robinson so, of course, I wanted to do the same.”\n\nBoth Robinson and her students take this writing assignment very seriously.\n\n“Once I receive the information about the Patriot's Pen Contest, I spend a class period reviewing the rules of the contest, and then I assign all my classes to write on the topic given that year,” stated Robinson. “We begin with a brainstorm activity of all the ideas they can come up with associated with the topic. I then work with them to write an outline of how they want to organize their information in the essay and then give them class time to type it.\n\n“After reading all the essays from my students, I am allowed to enter five-ten essays each year to the VFW for consideration for the contest, along with all the other entries from other Defiance County Schools. Once all essays are entered, it is then up to the VFW readers to decide who places in the contest.”\n\nThird-place finisher Amaya Perez was motivated to do well for a couple of reasons.\n\n“My motivation to participate in this event was to voice my opinion and to truly recognize and thank all of the veterans,” noted Perez. “The theme of my essay was about all of the freedoms we are given that we use in negative ways every day, and how I pledge to always do good with the rights I am given.\n\n“Thank you to all of the veterans that have fought for our country,” stated Perez with pride in her voice.\n\n“I appreciate all the hard work my students have put forth all these years in the VFW Patriot's Pen Contest,” concluded Robinson.\n\nThe picture below depicts Fairview eighth grade students (left to right) Sammy Mavis (1st place), Morgan Mavis (2nd place), and Amaya Perez (3rd place) flanked by VFW representatives Jim Seymour (far left) and Chris Taylor (far right).\n\nWhether the competition involves academics, athletics, or co-curricular events, Fairview High School students continue to shine in local competitions. This fact was again exemplified as senior Mykenzi Hartz recently finished as the Defiance County runner-up in the annual VFW Post 3360 Voice of Democracy contest held this fall. Started in 1947, this year’s theme was “Why is the Veteran Important?” For Hartz, her reasons for competing were two-fold.\n\n“I was motivated to participate in this event because I found it not only as a great way to thank our veterans for their service but also contribute towards my college expenses,” explained Hartz, gleaming with pride. Her runner-up finish accomplished both goals, as she made a great impression on the judging committee and earned a $1,000 scholarship for her efforts.\n\n“The theme of my presentation was ‘Why the Veteran is Important’,” continued Hartz. “In my essay, I was able to present how veterans are not only the heart and soul of our country, but also a representation of the freedom our country has fought to obtain.”\n\nIn order to participate, students must write a patriotic essay on the theme that is announced each fall. Applicants must then submit both their written essay and an audio recording of the essay. Students in grades 9-12 are eligible to submit entries for this scholarship competition.\n\nSchool counselor, Mrs. Lori Polter, is the school’s point of contact. She plays a critical role in the students’ success by advertising the event, getting English teachers involved, and assuring that students are following specified guidelines.\n\n“Over the years, we have had great success with students placing in the top four and winning scholarship money at the Post (local) level,” stated Polter, who confirmed that Fairview has been participating since at least 2004-2005. “I help students by making sure their entries are complete and submitted in the proper format.”\n\nHartz now has the opportunity to move to the next round where the stakes are even higher.\n\n“Winners at the local level advance for judging at the district, state, and national level,” continued Polter. “Students compete for over $2 million in scholarships given by the VFW organizations across the US.”\n\nEach year nearly 80,000 students compete in various VFW Post level competitions, with the VFW Post 3360 sponsoring two other upcoming events: A Defiance County scholarship for seniors (due in December) and the Patriotic Arts Contest (due in March). Interested students should reach out to Polter for more information.\n\nShown in the picture below is Hartz (center) accepting her award from VFW Post 3360 treasurer Chris Taylor (left) and Post Commander Jim Seymour (right).\n\nEvery year as students enter high school, many of them inquire in one class or another, “Why do we have to learn this?”\n\nPhysical Science teacher Mrs. Rayna Moore has been answering this question by offering creative analogies for her students, comparing points of her lessons to what she knows her students are truly interested in: Food. Moore remembers one of her first examples while doing her student teaching in a biology class.\n\n“If you never tried chocolate ice cream, how would you know you liked it?” enquired Moore to a group of disgruntled students, challenging the necessity of a particular lesson. “High school is like a buffet. Some dishes you will like, while others you won’t, and it is important to know both.”\n\nThis topic again came up in a recent lesson Moore introduced to her physical science students, when some students wondered why it was really necessary to learn “how elements combine to form compounds and the fact that the ration of elements in these compounds is always consistent.” And what better way to make her point with teenagers than to turn to an example of misinformation found on TikTok. A current TikTok trend says that water can be “big” or “small,” and only “small” water is good for you because it keeps you from bloating and doesn’t dilute your system.\n\n“Wrong!” exclaimed Moore.\n\nShe and her students then discussed how every water molecule is made of exactly two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Water can never be “larger” or “smaller.”\n\n“We talked about how out in the world people make claims all the time, and it is up to our students to gather background knowledge and techniques for researching reliable sources to make their best decisions about these claims.\n\n“In this case, it was decided that these misinformed TikTok-era (messages) are spreading fake news to sell a product, but my students in physical Science class won’t be falling for it.”\n\nOne such student is freshman David Bennett.\n\n“I learned that people are willing to go against science to sell people a product,” explained Bennett about his new-found knowledge. “Even if science is proving them wrong, they will still fight for you to buy a product even if they know they are wrong.\n\n“I find (it) especially interesting that even if science can and does disprove things they say, they will still try to get you to buy their product. I believe that this is a good lesson that can teach people that you shouldn't always listen to what people say to you and that you should do your own research.”\n\nThe morals of this story are simple: 1.) You never know until you try; and 2.) Don’t fall for every sales pitch you hear. You many find yourself on the wrong end of a bad deal.\n\nThe picture below depicts the Tik Tok lesson Moore used to make her point, resulting in she and her students disproving the false theory than there is such a thing as “big” and “small” water.\n\nAnyone who is a fan of the 1960’s television series The Andy Griffith Show knows that Barney Fife would frequently get upset about something and abruptly quit his job. After one such event, Fife says to Sheriff Taylor, “There’s a great big world out there, and I’m going to take my place in it.” Although this classic show was often full of silly scenes like this one, Don Knott’s iconic character was definitely correct about “the great big world” and all it has to offer to the many organisms it helps to survive. Through the leadership of Mrs. Rayna Moore, her biology students spent several days studying this topic.\n\n“The world is full of resources and during a recent ecology unit, my biology class learned how these resources interact and the systems that drive them,” explained Moore. “What better way to study how systems in nature interact then to go and explore it.”\n\nThanks to the beautiful weather that was plentiful through much of the fall, along with the wooded area on the school grounds, students were able to get in some hands-on learning.\n\n“It is important for students to understand that ecology is not made up of far-off concepts. It is everything around them,” explained Moore.\n\nAfter an introduction to the unit and various key terms, students were divided into groups to apply their new found vocabulary to their backyard world. They were challenged with finding examples of ten key terms, taking pictures of them, and arranging them in a Google Slide presentation showing their understanding. Students also researched the area’s ecological past and discussed what changes have been made and why.\n\nAnother outdoor activity that students enjoyed was creating a food web and learning about the flow of energy through the web. In this activity, students were each assigned an organism native to Defiance County. They were tasked with arranging themselves into a food web and labeling each organism as an autotroph or heterotroph, as well as determining whether they make their own food or get energy by consuming other organisms.\n\nAmong the students who benefited from this lesson was sophomore Kayla Mavis.\n\n“This was a good, interactive lesson to teach us about the different levels of a food pyramid,” noted Mavis. “It was interesting to learn the specific classifications within each trophic layer and their characteristics.”\n\nStudents also had to work together to classify each organism as a detritivore, carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, decomposer, scavenger, or producer.\n\n“Students were able to use real-world, local examples to fortify their learning,” concluded Moore.\n\nThe left picture below represents atmosphere, which is defined as the layers of gases surrounding a planet or other celestial body.\n\nThe center picture below represents biotic factor, which is any living part of the environment with which an organism would react.\n\nThe right picture below represents community, which is an assemblage of different populations that live together in a defined area.\n\nStatistics show that today’s youth are under more stress than their parents and grandparents were at the same age. To help young people cope with this fact, the teachers and staff at Fairview Middle School have introduced an evidenced-based suicide prevention program called Sources of Strength. Introduced to the district during the 2020-2021 school year by Laura Kamp, NWOESC School Climate Facilitator, this program was well received by Principal Suzanne Geis and School Counselor Adam Brickner. However, it was the buy-in from the teachers and staff who comprised the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) team that has transformed the program into the successful program that it is today.\n\n“The PBIS team was a vital part of the decision to implement the program,” explained Brickner. “Once we had our teachers on board, we knew it was going to be a success.”\n\nThe program promotes the following strengths:\n\n· Family support;\n\n· Positive friends;\n\n· Mentors;\n\n· Healthy activities;\n\n· Generosity;\n\n· Spirituality;\n\n· Physical health; and\n\n· Mental health.\n\nRelationship is a main focal point of the Sources of Strength. The program brings together positive student allies called Adult Advisors with a varied group of Peer Leaders from as many school peer groups as possible. The Adult Advisors and Peer Leaders are trained by national trainers and meet to plan and implement programming regularly. SourcesofStrengh.org explains it this way:\n\nThis team of youth and adults work to build a community of Strength, not only by practicing Strength in their own lives, but by sharing that Strength with others through Strength-based/public health style messaging campaigns. Spreading stories of Strength across a school or community, Peer Leaders invite students, staff, and their community to interact, engage, and apply Strength to their own lives.\n\nAmong the students active in this year’s program is seventh grader Chloe Northrup, who is doing what she can to make middle school a great experience.\n\n“There are many ways we as a student body can support each other,” stated Northrup. “For example, even though we're not all close, we're always there for each other and other students in the group. And the staff members who are a part of this group are supportive of new ideas and thoughts each person has.\n\n“We never get judged for anything we throw out there in meetings. Instead we simply get deeper into detail.”\n\nWhile the main goal of Sources of Strength is prevention, the program has had success in the areas of intervention and crisis situations as well. SourcesofStrengh.org continues by saying:\n\nA Peer Leader who has been trained in Sources of Strength is four times more likely to refer a friend they are worried about to a trusted adult. A Sources of Strength team works to create a culture of help-seeking and connection, where it is okay to not feel okay and where reaching out for help is a sign of Strength, not weakness. We also realize that tragedy and hardship still occur in life, despite our best efforts: Loved ones can get sick, a school could lose a beloved teacher, etc. However, a Sources of Strength team can have great impact on acommunity after such loss. Peer Leaders can act as the eyes and ears of the school, helping adults be more aware of the areas of the school that may be struggling and in need of support. Sources is also about helping people heal and recover after tragedy. In this way, Sources can have a more universal and comprehensive impact in prevention, intervention, and postvention.\n\nContinued Brickner: “Peer Leaders, with the help of Adult Advisors, promote change through positive messages of hope, help, and strength. The students are not young mental health counselors but are fellow peers trying to encourage others to improve their behavior and make healthy life-choices.”\n\nPaying for the program included grants provided by Ohio School Wellness Initiative (O.S.W. I) and Prevention First of Ohio. Kamp continues to seek out grants to make sure the Sources of Strength is fully funded at Fairview Middle School.\n\n“It is so much fun to be able to feel comfortable with a giant group of people even though we are not all in the same grade level,” noted Northrup. “With them, I always feel welcome, sometimes even more welcome than kids in my own grade. Trust is very important to have and if I'm being honest our whole program is built on it. I've learned to trust and be more supportive because of the program.\"\n\nShe also has much praise for everyone involved.\n\n“I don't think anyone realizes how many great adult advisors and student advisors (we have) that work hard in this program. It's not the easiest thing to do. It is a real commitment, but we all enjoy it. We have such an amazing group of staff and students who all put lots of effort into encouraging and spreading positivity throughout the school just for everyone to grow stronger in their strengths.\n\n“So I would love to give them a special thanks for everything everyone in the group has done to promote our program! Thank you everyone in the group for choosing to continue in the program this year. Again, thank you staff for putting lots of planning and training into our program!”\n\nShown in the picture below is Sources of Strength Wheel. Each Wednesday, students have opportunities to win small prizes for correctly answering questions about one of the strengths.\n\nMrs. Rayne Moore loves science, and she clearly wants her students to love the benefits of science as well. This admiration for her field of work was recently on display, as for the second year in a row, Moore organized a field trip to Wittenberg University for her physics students.\n\n“To make advances within our society, scientists must collaborate often sharing methodologies, research findings, and even equipment,” stated Moore with a noted tone of excitement. “With that in mind we embarked on a mission to share STEM opportunities with local seniors.”\n\nStudents had the good fortune to explore the Wittenberg campus and see labs being used to research dusty plasma and antimatter, visit the campus’s observatory, and see a particle accelerator without traveling to The European Organization for Nuclear Research, better known as CERN.\n\nOne such senior, Michael Mansel-Pleydell, spoke fondly of his experience at the Springfield, Ohio university.\n\n“On our visit, I was able to gain a general understanding of anti-matter, particle accelerators, and dusty plasma,” explained Mansel-Pleydell. “I also learned about the various career pathways available for a physics major in particular. Something I found especially interesting in this lesson was the diversity of applications available for a physics major in the modern world.”\n\nThis year’s trip was the second for Fairview students. However, Moore took it a step further and invited students from three area high school to join her Fairview students.\n\n“My first year at Fairview (2021-2022), I contacted one of my physics professors at Wittenberg (about a prospective field trip),” explained Moore about how the trip’s origin. “I always said I chose Wittenberg (to attend college) because of the particle accelerator that students can access, and I wanted to show my students how many opportunities were available in the discipline.\n\n“With the support of my principal and superintendent, this year I set out to extend this opportunity to experience STEM research to a broader audience,” she continued. “I used the connections that I had made to work with Antwerp, Wayne Trace, and Crestview Local Schools to invite students and educators to come with us and see what research is being done firsthand.\n\n“I am so excited that we were able to share the importance of collaboration with a much fuller bus this year.”\n\nAs much as knowledge as educators have to offer, knowing the right people and getting their students in front of the right people, opens up additional doors. No one knows this better than Moore.\n\n“As you make your way into the educational system, you make many connections: mentors, professors, student teachers, etc.” stated Moore, who didn’t take the typical route to teaching and has learned the importance of networking.\n\nIn the pictures below (left to right), students observe the particle accelerator, check out the retractable roof on the observatory, and visit a beautiful campus building.\n\nAnyone who follows politics has likely heard the expression, “Make your voices heard at the ballot box.” In other words, those who wish to have laws enacted that represent their way of thinking need to cast their votes for political candidates whose views align with theirs. However, before citizens can cast such a vote, other citizens need to step up and run for office, also known in Lehman's terms as “getting their name on the ballot.” But how does one go about doing so?\n\nRecently, students in Mr. Andy Singer's Political Pathways class had the opportunity to ask that question and more to Miss Erica Krouse, who represents the Toledo-area office for longtime Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown. Among many topics, she discussed her role in his office and how to get involved in government/elected office.\n\n“My students have been studying the process of becoming a politician and the decision-making process that goes along with it,” explained Singer. “To help, we invited Miss Krouse and other local and state politicians to come in to be guest speakers to get a first-hand account of politics in action.”\n\nAccording to Krouse, most politicians get their start by working in some form of government work to see how the process works. Most are often already fairly prominent members of the community who wish to share their experience and values with the people they represent. Most politicians, she believes, have the best interest of their constituents in mind and really do care about making life better for people.\n\nWhen asked how she became involved in politics, she explained that she did what most people do when looking for job.\n\n“I saw where Senator Brown was looking for someone to help in his Toledo office, and I thought I would apply,” state Krouse. “I don’t want to be a politician, but working for one has been rewarding.”\n\nTo become a candidate in the state of Ohio, the first step is to be a registered voter. From there it's a matter of filing paperwork with the elections board, getting the necessary number of signatures from other registered voters, and getting all paperwork turned in on time. Most people who wish to become candidates are able to successfully complete the process on time. From there, it's just a matter of campaigning and getting the message out that you are the best option for the job, she explained.\n\nThe picture below depicts Krouse answering one of the many questions asked by Fairview students.\n\nData shows that students often learn the best through active, hands-on activities. To help solidify this point, the Fairview sixth-grade students recently attended the Defiance County Soil and Water Conservation District where the students were able to participate in a variety of conservation-based presentations in the areas of water treatment, pollinators, geology, petroleum products, soils, and archery.\n\nOrganized by the sixth grader teachers, and facilitated by local conservation experts, reviews from students were largely positive.\n\n“Going hands-on is something I enjoy,\" stated Gage Miller with a smile on his face. “It was a great learning experience for all of us.”\n\n“I think this field trip was an amazing experience to learn about all types of things and give students the chance to take part in some of the activities,” excitedly stated Carson Main. “I was really surprised when we did the water treatment activity because I did not think the color would change.”\n\nClassmate Riley Maulsby shared in the excitement, but his favorite activity involved geology.\n\n“My favorite thing at the field trip was the rock center,” Maulsby exclaimed. “I liked the story the guy (local geology expert) told us about two brothers and a sister. One brother liked to make destruction, (while) the other was peaceful.\n\n“Another thing I liked about the rock center was the rocks. They had insane colors on them, and I liked how they had different shapes and sizes.”\n\nMiller wasn’t expected to be surprised, but even he was. Stated Miller: “The one thing that surprised me was the petroleum products station. This opened my eyes to a new career I didn't see myself entering.\n\n“Considering that my dad works for Defiance County Soil and Water, it was a surprise to me that I learned something there.”\n\nWhen asked whether he would do anything differently should he have a chance to participate in this event again, Main noted that he would “change the type of water I picked for the water treatment activity and see what effects that has on the color of that water.”\n\nMaulsby admitted that he had a big change of heart concerning the soils activities.\n\n“When I went, I wasn't really interested in the soil center,” said Maulsby. “But if I could go back, I would pay more attention because now I find soil interesting.”\n\nThere’s no question that Miller had a great time. “There was absolutely nothing on that field trip that I would change. It was perfect!”\n\n“Our students had a great day of hands-on learning and represented Fairview well!” exclaimed Mrs. Anne Frank, sixth grade math and science teacher.\n\nTo top it off, lunch was provided to the students and adults by the Conservation District, with Maulsby giving high praise to his meal.\n\n“One last thing I want to say about the field trip is I loved the lunch,” a smiling Maulsby noted. “It was good, especially the hamburgers and chips.”\n\nThe center picture below shows the sixth graders taking a break from the day’s events, while the pictures of the left and right show students in action.\n\nFairview Middle School students are once again showing just how much they care about one another's education and well being, this time by introducing a program appropriately named the \"Kindness Cupboard\" Spearheaded by seventh grader Chole Northrup and her mother, Andrea, this cabinet offers school supplies to any MS student who may have a particular need for a new pencil, pen, or several other items on any given day.\n\n\"My mom originally saw a Facebook post, and that gave me the idea to email Mr. Bricker (MS counselor) about it,\" explained Northrup with a very humble look on her face. \"Then we set up a meeting with Mrs. Geis (MS principal), and she approved the idea.\"\n\nLocated just outside the middle school office, students have opportunities between classes, during lunch, or other appropriate times to grab a variety of needed school supplies. Hygiene products, such as deodorant, shampoo, and tooth paste are also available.\n\nAccording to seventh grader Anthony Singer, the cupboard is serving a great purpose.\n\n\"Kids are ready for class when they use the cupboard and are not slowing class down to have to ask for a pencil,\" stated Singer. They now have access to folders so they will have their papers ready for class.\"\n\nAnother program already in place, known as Sources of Strength (SOS), has also been very pivotal in the success of the cupboard.\n\n\"The whole operation came from the group SOS,\" noted seventh grader RayShawn Maulsby. \"Led by Mr. Brickner, he called us all down and we got to work.\"\n\nSeventh grader Dasen Wermer has noticed the value of the cupboard.\n\n\"I think that was a really good idea to do the Kindness Cupboard,\" said Wermer, \"and I also really like helping do the cupboard. The first goal is that everyone uses it correctly, and everyone knows that they can use it for stuff they need.\"\n\nOne concern noted was that students may not want to be seen using the cupboard and/or taking advantage of the program. So far, that hasn't been the case as outlined by seventh grader Olivia Schindler.\n\n\"I have seen a student take a folder from the cupboard,\" noted Schindler. \"Hopefully, that means kids are getting more comfortable using it.\n\n\"I have the hope that kids won't take advantage of the cupboard and just use it (even) when they don't need it,\" continued Schindler. \"A goal of mine would be for kids to not be scared or embarrassed and to just use the cupboard when they need it.\"\n\nNorthrup, Singer, and Schindler noted their appreciation for the support the program has received from the adults at Fairview MS.\n\n\"Mrs. Schlachter was the teacher to get the cupboard and help with decorating it, so we should thank her,\" stated a smiling Schindler.\n\nSinger chimed in: \"Having help from Mrs. Schlachter and Mrs. Cooper played a big role in the success of the Kindness Cupboard.\"\n\n\"I want to give the adult advisors and Mr. Geis a thanks for making my idea come to life!\" exclaimed Northrup. \"It's been really helpful to people and that was our goal. So thank you!!\"\n\nThe middle picture below shows that five students that brought this idea to life. They include (counter-clockwise from upper left) RayShawn Maulsby, Olivia Schindler, Chloe Northrup, Dasen Wermer, and Anthony Singer. The pictures on the left and right show its outside and inside.\n\nImagine being able to control a wheelchair just by using head motions. That was the objective of the Engineering 2 class’s final lesson for the 2022-2023 school year, and it was one the students will certainly remember for some time as the lesson was very much student driven almost right out of the gate.\n\n“This unit was led by the students as much as productively possible,” explained veteran teacher Mr. Ray Breininger. “I led the initial lesson where the design challenge is laid out, and the students did the rest.”\n\nThe goal is to “build” a wheelchair that will be manipulated simply by the passenger’s head motion. Students had some initial directions and a clear starting point, then they were challenged to test their skills.\n\n“The students used the requirements and constraints provided by the Email to Engineers, an explanation of the hardware, plus multiple handouts,” continued Breininger. “After that, the students were then set free to complete the unit using the skills that they have learned in all of the previous units and engineering.”\n\nAmong the students who learned many valuable lessons from this unit is Charlotte Vogelsong.\n\n“One thing I learned from this unit is how important it is to communicate with your partners,” stated Vogelsong. “This unit wasn't the kind where our group could split up, do our tasks, and come back together to form a final project. We had to discuss how individual tasks would affect or play a role in the outcome and work from there.\n\n“For example, Andy Mosier was in charge of coding the wheelchair device, the switches that operate it, and the camera/monitor. Together, we discussed how the camera, monitor, and switches were supposed to work, how many he planned on using, and how we could attach or fix them to a wheelchair. Then, Allison Rhodes and I designed models to fulfill the needs and constantly checked back in with Andy to ensure we were on the right path. Without communication, it would've been like trying to combine two different puzzles: our designs wouldn't fit together.”\n\nMadisyn Clark also had praises for the knowledge and experience she garnered.\n\n“A few lessons I learned from this unit were how to accurately use the engineering design process, how to program through a MotorHat, and how to delegate different tasks to team members,” explained Clark. “We have been using the engineering design process since Engineering 1, but we kind of drifted from using it in every aspect of the project due to COVID. This was also the class's first time programming through a MotorHat.\"\n\nContinued Vogelsong: “I also learned how important it is to test our designs. Allison and I had to try to ‘break’ our designs for the switches. The purpose of trying to break a design is to test its limits, functionality, and safety. For example, we thought we had come to a final design that could hold our switches, but when tested, a piece that was crucial to the functionality broke off, leading us to redesign and make the piece thicker.”\n\nBoth students also agreed there were some surprises along the way.\n\n“Personally, one thing that surprised me about this lesson is that I was the one to solder everything even though I had never soldered in a serious manner before,” said Clark with a chuckle. “With all of the soldering I did, I became way more efficient than when I first started. When soldering my first MotorHat it took me about three hours and on my last MotorHat it took maybe ten to fifteen minutes.”\n\n“I was surprised by how time-consuming it would be,” noted Vogelsong. “We started this unit in April, and despite splitting up the work, we worked for the rest of the school year finishing the project. However, knowing that we have put our best efforts into this project, it is rewarding to see it all come together.\n\n“This unit has been challenging and time-consuming, but we have had a great support system: intelligent, creative classmates and Mr. Breininger, who we can rely on for feedback and assistance, concluded Vogelsong”\n\nShown in the pictures below are (left) Madisyn Clark, Andy Mosier & Cory Mavis (center), and Charlotte Vogelsong (right) busily competing various tasks.\n\nMake room for more hardware, as the Fairview archery teams brought home a boatload of it from this year’s state archery tournament held recently in Columbus, OH. Out of the several schools that competed, the high school team and the elementary team each finished second overall in their respective categories, while the middle school team was right behind in third place in its category.\n\nNot only did our archers shine as teams, but an amazing six individuals finished first overall in their grade level. This group of sharpshooters includes the following student/athletes:\n\n· Stephanie Moore: 12th grade girls division\n\n· Clayton VanArsdalen: 11th grade boys division\n\n· Edreanne Peck: 7th grade girls division\n\n· Liahm Kimpel: 6th grade boys division\n\n· Rachel Ward: 4th grade girls division\n\n· Will Mavis: 4th grade boys division\n\nAlthough doing well as a team and individual is important to the archers, many were quick to note that this sport does way more than just name winners. It adds a great deal to the overall school experience.\n\n“The archery program has added to my experience during school by teaching me perseverance, leadership, and how to be mentally tough,” stated senior Marissa Sims, who finished a respectable 6th place in the 12th grade girls division.\n\nHer teammate, Moore, expressed similar feelings: “The archery program has added to my experience during school by helping me meet new people and get closer to others from my school. It has also helped me get recognized more at my school when being mentioned on the announcements.”\n\nVan Arsdalen points out the mental aspects of what archery has done for him. “Being in archery has taught me to be patient. Archery is very much a mental game, and you have to learn to be calm and patient and not let stuff get to you.”\n\nFor Kimpel, it was his family that sparked his interest in the sport.\n\n“My sister joined archery when she was in fourth grade, and my dad also hunted with his bow. So seeing the shoot made me want to,” explained the sixth grader. He certainly puts in the time, which is reflective of his performance. “I try to shoot at least four nights a week and sometimes more. I'm going to nationals, and to get ready I will just try to shoot a little bit more and focus more on my shot not as much on my grouping.”\n\nBrett Zeedyk, who finished third for Fairview middle school and 8th overall in his division, believes the archery program has elevated school sprit.\n\n“The Fairview archery teams continue to be a source of pride for the school and community as evidenced by their success again this season, especially at the recent state tournament,” noted the well-spoken eighth grader. “All three teams finished in the top three of the team scores with the high school and elementary teams each finishing as runners up.”\n\nWith the national competition on the horizon, most of the student/athletes who have qualified are practicing hard in hopes of impressive finishes at such a prestigious event. Among those is fifth grader Olivia Zeedyk, who is making plans and gearing up for the competition. Said Zeedyk: “I’m planning to go to nationals, and I’ve been practicing really hard. I usually spend one hour a week with my bow.”\n\nThe top two seniors, Moore and Sims, are especially excited knowing this will be their last go-round as a Fairview Apache.\n\n“I am looking forward to our final competition at the NASP National Tournament, where we will compete with teams from around the country,” stated Sims in her usual steady way. “I have always enjoyed being a part of the archery program, and I am grateful to everyone who helped with the program throughout my time as an archer at Fairview.”\n\n“Archery has affected my life in many positive ways,” declared Moore. “I loved the overall experience, and I had fun getting to go to different states for national and world tournaments. Archery was always a fun little competition for me, and I always strive to try to beat my personal best. I can't wait to see how my teammates and I will perform.”\n\nSome students are looking at competing after high school. Among those is VanArsdalen, whose impressive performance garnered the attention of an Ohio college.\n\n“I can see myself continuing (with archery) out of school,” he said. “At the state competition, I received a scholarship for Muskingum University.”\n\nAs our teams continue to practice for the big event, to be held in Louisville, KY on May 12-14, we salute our student/athletes, coaches, support staff, parents, and everyone who has played a role in the success of Fairview archery.\n\nZeedyk speaks for the community when she stated, “Go Apaches.”\n\nThe pictures below reflect the top three state competition finishers from each respective building. High school students (left picture) include Clayton VanArsdalen, Marissa Sims, and Stephanie Moore; middle school students (center picture) include Liahm Kimpel, Edreanne Peck, and Brett Zeedyk; and elementary school students in the right picture include Will Mavis, Olivia Zeedyk, and Rachel Ward.\n\nAlthough winning games and championships is certainly a top priority for any varsity team, the Fairview baseball program showed its true colors by hosting several students from Good Sam School in Defiance for a day of baseball practice one day over spring break. And no one is more proud than head coach Mr. Andy Singer.\n\n“They (Fairview baseball players) took a rainy, dreary day for playing baseball and turned it into a memory that will last a lifetime,” stated Singer with a glowing beam on his face. “These young men took a day out of their spring break and came in for ‘practice’ with our new Fairview baseball friends from Good Sam.”\n\nThe day started with lunch (Pizza Hut pizza, chips, and drinks… what more could anyone ask for?), and Singer was quick to point out the extra efforts of custodian Mr. Steve Rohrs for helping to set up tables in the cafeteria. Following the nice meal and fellowship, the players and coaches headed to the gymnasium to play some baseball. But no baseball event ever starts without the playing of the Star Spangled Banner.\n\n“We started by teaching them the proper procedure for standing for the National Anthem when it is being played,” continued Singer. “Each of the students from Good Sam took our make-shift field in their favorite spot with our baseball players. Dakota, one of the students, wanted the Canadian National Anthem also, so we obliged and played that as well. Many of our players had never heard it and cheered loudly for Dakota after he sang the lyrics as it was being played.”\n\nWith the singing of the two anthems complete, it was time to play some ball.\n\n“We then started working on our baseball fundamentals,” explained Singer. “We worked on fielding, throwing, hitting, and then running the bases. Our players worked so well with everyone; it was such a sight to see.”\n\nAlong with the great interaction among players and guests, no one left empty handed.\n\n“We got each of the students from Good Sam a Fairview baseball shirt and an autographed page of the players that they can take home and keep for souvenirs,” noted Singer.\n\nNot only was there was much learning and enjoyment that occurred, but Singer couldn’t have said it better than this: “As much as they enjoyed the day, our Fairview baseball players and coaches enjoyed it even more. Our players learned so much from this, and it is hard not to get a little choked up because as much as I love the game of baseball, it is just a small part of the game of life. We all have so much to be thankful for, and days like today help us in taking a step back to realize the most important things in life.\n\n“I left our players today with this thought: Just remember when we think we are having one of the worst days in our lives, this day could be a miracle day in someone else's.”\n\nSinger summed it up so well: “Again, I can't explain enough how proud I am of the way our baseball players helped, encouraged, cheered for, gave high fives, and yelled \"Yeah Buddy\" today. From being called ‘Boss’ to ‘Coach’ to letting the students from Good Sam be the umpires, there wasn't a time in the couple hours we were there for practice that everyone didn't have a smile on their face.”\n\nSinger would like to make a special \"Tip the Cap\" to Mr. TJ Hammer (interim superintendent of Good Sam), Amanda Westrick, Helen Bowden, and Alex Hartman for making this event happen. And for Dakota, David, Carrie, Ashley, Jarred, Tori, and Zane: “You are truly the All-Stars! ‘Yeah Buddy’!”\n\nThe left and right pictures below show students ready for action, while everyone poses for a group picture in the center.\n\nThe Fairview High School physics students continue to apply concepts learned in class to real-world applications. The latest example of this concept is the construction of “Mouse Trap Cars.”\n\nTo bring real meaning to this lesson, the students were all \"hired\" as engineers at the fictional MRM Engineering Solutions and tasked with developing the most efficient and reliable cars while combining the content standards of the lesson.\n\n“We are working through three tasks while practicing following the scientific method and engineering process using what we have learned about motion, friction, and forces,” stated physics teacher Mrs. Rayna Moore about the lesson. In addition, students are learning another great lesson, and that is “learning to revise and improve designs.”\n\nEach task began with a \"client” calling on MRM Engineering Solutions with a specific problem and a set of guidelines. In this case the clients were the fictional Philo T. Farnsworth, Walter Elias, and Joseph Strauss.\n\n“Students used their creativity to find the best solution for our clients,” continued Moore about the lesson. “So far, students have created an apparatus for hands-free viewing of mobile devices, and a vehicle that could travel the farthest possible distance powered only by a mousetrap.” The third challenge will be trying to create the most efficient bridge made of only toothpicks, glue, and string.\n\nSenior Marissa Sims was very intrigued by what she learned.\n\n“The part of the lesson that I found most interesting was learning how to harness the energy of the mousetrap to power a car,” explained Sims. Concerning the lesson on improving designs, Sims stated that if she had the opportunity to do the project again, “I would design a car made out of higher quality materials that could travel farther.”\n\nAs Moore stated, one of the objectives to her lessons is to find ways for improvement. Senior Nathaniel Adkins took that part of the lesson to heart.\n\n“I learned how to modify and make better adjustments to my car as needed,” noted Adkins. “(Also) how to use tools and everyday items to make a mousetrap car.”\n\nContinued Sims: “Through this lesson, I learned about the engineering process and how to assess problems with a design to find solutions.”\n\nFor senior Alyson Saul, propulsion is what stood out to her. Wester defines propulsion as “the action of driving or pushing forward.”\n\n“The most interesting part of this lesson was being able to understand how propulsion can be the sole force able to make something move,” explained Saul. “The cars built were able to move as mousetraps provided enough force to the wheels to make them spin.”\n\nShe too would prepare slightly differently the next time around.\n\n“If I had the opportunity to change something about how I carried out the project, I would have done more extensive research on the mechanics of how the propulsion process works.”\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to see these cars in motion soon.\n\nShown in the picture below are physics students (left to right) Easton Kime, Nathaniel Adkins, Marissa Sims, Brooke Phillips, Andrea Macsay, and Alyson Saul proudly displaying their models.\n\nAlthough 2-22-22 happens every one hundred years, this date actually falling on a Tuesday occurs approximately every four hundred years. To help celebrate such an unusual event, the first-grade team of Mrs. Allison Ciolek, Mrs. Linday Imm, Mrs. Jenny Johnson, and Mrs. Molly Nusbaum celebrated “Twosday,” 2-22-22 by assisting their students with developing time capsules which are to be opened on 3-3-33, which coincidentally will be this group of students’ senior year in high school.\n\n“Several students wondered how many years they had to wait to open the time capsule, so we did a math problem and found they will have to wait eleven years!” exclaimed Ciolek.\n\nThe teachers and students got very creative when it came to what items to place in the capsule. Items included the following:\n\n· Family pictures and a note from their parents\n\n· A piece of string showing how tall each student was on this day\n\n· A handprint to show the size of their hand as a first grader so they can compare that with the size of their hand as a senior\n\n· A note with their current weight & shoe size and how many teeth they have lost so far\n\n· Their favorites items in a variety of categories\n\n· Pictures they drew depicting three of their current friends\n\n· Masks to remind the students of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n· Current gasoline prices and prices of various grocery items\n\n· And finally, two more pictures of each student, one posing alone and one posing with their teacher\n\nIn addition to the awesome time capsule activity, students were encouraged to dress up wearing a combination of items including tutus, tie dye shirts, tube socks, tennis shoes, and ties. The celebration ended with students enjoying a cupcake slathered in frosting with a cookie shaped like the number on the top.\n\nWhen asked about the day, the teachers and students agreed that it was, “A fun day was had by all.”\n\nEnjoying the day's events include Mrs. Nusbaum's students (left picture), Mrs. Johnson's students (right picture) and a happy first grader (center) holding a balloon of the celebrated number.\n\nIn what may be a first-ever project at Fairview HS, life science teacher Mrs. Amy Woodring and family & consumer science teacher Mrs. Jill Speiser recently combined resources to conduct a “bone gelatin” project for students in their anatomy & physiology and human growth and development classes, respectively.\n\n“Recently, the A&P (anatomy & physiolocy) II students thought it would be interesting to attempt to make gelatin from scratch,” explained Woodring. “(We) decided to collaborate with Mrs. Speiser’s human growth & development class on this endeavor.”\n\nWoodring’s anatomy students conducted research, found a recipe, and provided raw beef bones, which were provided by community member Mr. Darren Bok’s family. Speiser’s students assisted with the cooking, the straining, and preparing the flavored gelatin. This entire process took several days.\n\n“Preparing for the final product was long,” stated senior Grace Bok, daughter of Darren Bok. “There was some trial-and-error involved. After putting the juice and fruit into the contents with the gelatin, we cooled it overnight. When we pulled the Jell-O out of the fridge, we realized that the juice made the Jell-O too runny.\n\n“We decided to heat the Jell-O and add more gelatin along with sugar, as it was tart and boney. Once the Jell-O was mixed, we put it back in the fridge overnight.”\n\nThis example of trial-and-error proved to be successful. Continued Bok: “The next day, we tested it again, and it tasted better.”\n\n“The students made orange, apple, and grape/blueberry flavors, then had the chance to try each,” continued Woodring. “Most students and staff members who sampled the flavors did not enjoy the taste, but there were a few who didn’t mind it.”\n\n“We had many teachers try all three flavors without telling them what it came from,” Bok said a little sheepishly. “In doing this, we found many teachers liked the Jell-O until we told them it came from bones.”\n\nWhen asked what thoughts she was having right before tasting the product, senior Kylie Gates had a great response: “I was nervous to try it because if anything came from the boiling down of animal bones, it couldn't taste good.\n\n“I had only tasted my group's flavor,” stated Gates when asked about which flavor tasted the best. “We made orange, (and) it did not taste like beef broth as you would think. The orange flavor didn't turn out the best, but it did surprise me that it set up like normal Jell-O.”\n\nBeing a big believer in recycling and not one to waste anything that may be reusable, Woodring suggested her students find something useful to do with the extra tallow (fat). After a little discussion and additional research, the students developed body butter using essential oils to help with the smell.\n\n“The students and staff thought the peppermint turned out the best and was great for skin hydration,” concluded Woodring with a smile.\n\nThe teachers and students wish to throw out a special thank-you to the Bok family for providing the bones.\n\nThe pictures below (left and right) show students preparing the bone gelatin, while students in the center picture sample the final product.\n\nIn a different twist to “Who’s Telling Your Story,” we have reached out to senior Brendan Degryse to discuss his historic acceptance into the United States Military Academy West Point. Enjoy.\n\n“Who’s Telling Your Story” (“WTYS”): Tell us about the process you went through in order to be accepted into West Point.\n\nDegryse: The process to get into a service academy is very long. I started the application at the end of my junior year in March. I filled out the Candidate Questionnaire and applied for the West Point Summer Leaders Experience (SLE). The SLE is normally a week at West Point, but this year it was virtual. At the SLE, I learned a lot about West Point and other service academies. I was also able to do my interview at that time, which is another step in the process. Starting in June, the rest of my application for West Point opened up. I had to take a fitness test, medical exam, write 3 essays, obtain letters of recommendation, send in transcripts and ACT scores, and answer some other questions that West Point had. I also had interviews with the offices of both of Ohio's Senators and Fifth District Representative Robert Latta. At the time, my first choice was the Air Force Academy. Senator Portman nominated me to the Air Force Academy and Representative Latta nominated me to the Air Force Academy and West Point. After a lot of waiting, I received a call from Representative Latta on January 4th and was told I was offered admission to West Point. I am still waiting to hear back from the Air Force Academy, but I am hopeful as it is still very early in the process of hearing back from the Academies. At this time I am leaning towards West Point but I haven't completely decided yet.\n\n“WTYS”: What was your biggest obstacle to overcome in order to get accepted?\n\nDegryse: People have different issues when applying to a service academy. Some people have an issue with the fitness test, others need a medical waiver, but for me, it was the waiting. I finished everything as quickly as I could, which meant I had to wait longer for results. I was very lucky in this regard, as I feel that it is much better to have to wait than worry about whether or not you will be cut out of the admissions process early.\n\n“WTYS”: What is your timeline once you graduate from Fairview HS?\n\nDegryse: If I go to West Point, I will have to be there for Reception day on June 27th. That is the start of 6 weeks of basic training. After those six weeks, the academic school year starts.\n\n“WTYS”: What people have been most influential in your life to help you become successful?\n\nDegryse: The people that have been most helpful to me are all the people who helped me through this process. I talked to many graduates and cadets at service academies who helped me understand more about the process. I am also appreciative of all the people who wrote letters of recommendation for me. My friends and family have given me lots of encouragement as well.\n\n“WTYS”: How do you picture your life one year from now? Five years from now?\n\nOne year from now, I will likely be halfway done with my plebe year at West Point. Plebes have a lot of rules that they have to follow, like not being able to speak or look around when walking down hallways. They also have to do chores and call minutes. I will mostly be focusing on classes. In 5 years, I will likely be a Cadet First Class, which is the equivalent of a senior at a normal college. By this point, I will hopefully know my job in the military. Right now I am looking at aviation, cyber operations, and military intelligence. I will also be close to finishing my degree in Computer Science.\n\n“WTYS”: Anything else you would like to add that might be interesting for our readers?\n\nDegryse: Getting into a service academy is a long process that can have a lot of hangups. I have heard of a lot of people that want to go to a service academy but never start or finish their application. If someone wants to go to a service academy, then they should apply. It costs nothing but time and effort. Service Academies like to see good grades, extracurricular activities, and sports. But what they are really searching for are people who are going to be good leaders and good officers. If someone wants to serve and lead, then service academies are a great place for them. But if they don't get into a service academy, then ROTC and OCS are just as good of options for people who want to become officers. Everyone commissions as a Second Lieutenant.\n\n\"Who's Telling Your Story?\" congratulates Brendan (shown below) for all he has accomplished so far in his young life and wishes him the best during his next several journeys.\n\nToday’s employers continue to reach out to school officials stating that today’s graduates lack the life skills and soft skills needed to be reliable employees. Soft skills include getting to work on time, showing up for work every day, getting along with fellow employees, being able to make decisions without always being told what to do, following simple directions, and looking others in the eye when speaking and listening, among many others. To help with this matter, the Fairview fourth grade students had a hopping, eventful month of activities throughout December that focused on such skills.\n\nWith the Amazing Shake event just around the corner, students spent several minutes on December 9-10 preparing for this event by dressing up and practicing their soft skills with attendees of the annual “5th Grade Grandparents’ Day.” The students met visitors at the elementary school doors, greeted them with a warm smile & handshake, offered them a program for the concert, and directed them to their seats, all while making good eye contact and speaking in a clear, audible voice.\n\n“Students, staff, and grandparents were all impressed with how well the students did at welcoming them to our school and striking up conversation,” stated Mrs. Brooke Snyder about the students’ efforts at the grandparent event.\n\nThe following Friday, the students designed and built hanger Christmas trees as gifts for their loved ones. Among the many skills needed to be successful were cooperation, leadership, compromise, and teamwork.\n\n“The boys and girls had to work together to complete this task and follow multi-step directions for this task to be successful,” noted Snyder, while highlighting the various skills being taught from this lesson.\n\nOn December 19, the fourth graders had a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) Day in which they completed activities such as Elf Glyph, Tallest Christmas Tree, Parachute for Santa, and Build a Shelf for an Elf. During these activities they practiced group work, following directions, and used creative thinking skills in order to complete the tasks.\n\nTo round out the holiday season, the students participated in a fun-filled “Grinch Day!” The students wore green, drank Grinch punch, made Santa hat kabobs, played pin the heart on the Grinch, and completed a digital pixel art activity where they had to solve math problems in order to create the Grinch.\n\n“We ended the festive day watching The Grinch!” exclaimed Snyder while beaming with pride.\n\nThe three pictures below (left to right) show the students all dressed up to greet grandparents; students competing in the tallest tree contest; and a student displaying her parachute.\n\nAs the saying goes, “If you feed them, they will come.” Well, Fairview Elementary’s three fifth grade reading teachers, Mrs. Annie Kauffman, Mr. Kurt Nusbaum, and Mrs. Annie Zipfel, introduced a unique twist to this philosophy by developing a lesson based on the saying, “If you feed them, they will read” using a concept appropriately titled “Book Tasting.”\n\n“During this book tasting, the students sampled different books from different genres,” explained Zipfel about the fledgling lesson.\n\nThe three teachers set up their rooms like restaurants. Each table was decorated with a white table cloth, decorations, and a variety of books. Snacks were served between each round of books, which included Salt Sticks (pretzels), Rainbow Beans (Skittles), Golden Mackerel (Goldfish snacks), Wild Beast (deer summer sausage), Crème de la Chocolate (Oreos), and Crimson Chews (licorice).\n\n“Students were seated like at a restaurant,” continued Zipfel. “Their teacher then played up the part of being the waiter and then chef.”\n\nStudents were given ten minutes at each table and had a menu to fill out the books they liked, which coincides with the “40 Book Challenge” that Zipfel is doing in her class this year.\n\n“During the challenge, students are encouraged to read as many chapter books as possible with the goal of completing forty books by the end of the year,” noted Zipfel. “Students work daily on reaching their goal, and I also conference with students individually on a weekly basis to see how they are doing and what books they are reading.”\n\n“The 40 Book Challenge” is based on the book The Book Whisper by Donalyn Miller, which encourages reading through finding books students love. “Many students did end up reading books they sampled during the book tasting!” exclaimed Zipfel.\n\nThe teachers are singing the praises of the program, and the results prove it’s making a measurable difference in the amount of time the students are spending with books in their hands.\n\n“I have noticed a big difference in students reading more,” noted Zipfel. “I don't know how many parents I talked with at (parent-teacher) conferences that said their kids are reading more than ever. I really think the ‘40 Book Challenge’ has gotten them interested in reading.”\n\nStudents are even passing along rave reviews to one another.\n\n“I hear students sharing book recommendations with each other!” stated Zipfel with much enthusiasm.\n\nWhile doing the individual conferencing with teachers, the students are given fifteen minutes in class each day to read their books and, “They don’t want to stop. I also want to note there is no prize or party for getting the forty-book goal. All their motivation is coming internally from actually reading books they enjoy,” concluded Zipfel.\n\nThe pictures below (left to right) depict students silently reading at an adorned table; snacks neatly displayed; and Mrs. Zipfel having individual conferences with her students.\n\nMost people have probably seen or used a telescope. And while just about everyone benefits from the services provided by the Space Station, most of these same people likely have a limited understanding what it is that research physicists do. To help get answers to these and many other questions, Mrs. Rayna Moore’s physics class students recently traveled to Wittenberg University to witness the unique job of a research physicist and what may occur in an ordinary day for this anything-but-ordinary profession.\n\n“The students were able to see some state-of-the-art equipment, like the university’s particle accelerator and refracting telescope and learn how physicists have to design and create many of their own tools” explained Moore.\n\nSenior Jace Chapman was intrigued by the particle accelerator.\n\n“Wittenberg had a functional particle accelerator that students built and used for projects,” stated Chapman about what he found most interesting about the field trip.\n\nThese same sentiments about the accelerator were echoed by fellow senior Marissa Sims.\n\n“I found the particle accelerator very interesting,” noted Sims. “I liked learning about how the pieces of old and new technology in the accelerator work together to conduct research, and it's very impressive that many parts of the accelerator were designed by former students.”\n\nLocated in Springfield, Ohio (about an hour west of Columbus), Wittenberg University is a private liberal arts college offering an array of programs in many fields of science, including physics and physics research.\n\n“I learned the basics of how the particle accelerator works,” explained Sims about what information she brought back to Fairview. “I also learned about antimatter and the current research taking place at Wittenberg on positrons and their characteristics.”\n\nChapman was very precise in his description about what else he learned, stating, “On Earth, positrons only last mere nanoseconds before being annihilated by an electron.\" Pretty fascinating perception indeed.\n\n“The students were introduced to several fields currently being researched, such as plasma physics and antimatter,” concluded Moore. “They even learned about collaborations the university is doing with other schools, Homeland Security, and the Space Station.”\n\nThe pictures below (left to right) depict students learning from a current Wittenberg student about her summer field experience; the telescope found in the observatory ; and students observing parts of the particle accelerator in the target room.\n\nIn an effort to introduce students to the many cultures throughout the world, HS/MS librarian Mrs. Sally Miller set a goal earlier this year to adopt fiction books with characters other than White or from the United States. As a result of her efforts, she recently announced that the library has received several additional books that meet these criteria.\n\n“One of the projects that I have been working on this year is to increase our multicultural selection of fiction books,” stated Miller with pride in her voice. “I’m working in collaboration with Mrs. Jacqueline Davis and the World Languages Club.”\n\nThe library, named after longtime school superintendent Mr. Darrell E. Jones, started this school year with a collection of a shade over 5,100 fiction books. Of this number, only 139 of these books have been identified as multicultural, meaning only a little over 2% of the inventory contains a character of a race other than White, a setting in a different country, a cultural issue between races, or an author that is a race other than White.\n\n“As we try to encourage empathy and understanding of races and cultures other than our own, we were lacking stories that model that,” continued Miller. “As educators, we know that reading and stories are a foundation for learning. Therefore, I began reaching out to authors and publishers in an attempt to get some donations for our library.”\n\nWell, her hard work has paid dividends: “I'm pleased to share with you that I have received a donation!” she exclaimed. “(Library agent) Suzie Townsend from Publishers Marketplace recently delivered a box of eighteen books, with a retail value of $306.78, that can be categorized as multicultural and will help expand our collection. This collection contains both middle grade books and young adult, or high school books.”\n\nMiller is very appreciative of the continued value of the Darrell E. Jones library.\n\n“Our ability to provide students with physical books is greatly appreciated by the staff and students,” continued Miller. “Students admit that they truly prefer having the physical book in their hands. They've expressed that they can concentrate better, read longer, and comprehend better when it's not on the screen.”\n\nHowever, she is quick to point out that online options do exist. “For books that we don't have in our library, I suggest online options such as eBooks,” concluded Miller.\n\nShown below is the collection of books donated by Townsend and Publishers Marketplace.\n\nAs studies how, people both young and old learn in different ways. Likewise, people have learned to solve problems in more than one way too. This phenomena is especially true when it comes to solving math problems. In order to demonstrate to her students that they can solve division problems in a variety of ways, Miss Maggie Schneider introduced her students to a lesson on division where students were challenged to come up with as many ways to solve division problems as they could.\n\n“After spending a few weeks learning and reviewing division, one of my classes used number talks to discover new ways to divide mentally,” explained Schneider about the objective of her lesson. “Students were given a problem and tasked with solving it in their heads.”\n\nThat was only the beginning of the lesson though.\n\n“Once they solved it, they were challenged with trying to find more ways to solve it,” continued Schneider. “In the photos you will see students holding up their fingers to show me how many ways they have come up with to solve the problem.”\n\nSo that students could glean information from one another, they took turns going to the front of the room and solving the problems on the Whiteboard.\n\n“Students shared their thinking and demonstrated what they did in their heads on the board,” stated Schneider. “Students talked about what they may had done similarly or different. We also did this during our multiplication unit and will continue to do it throughout the year.”\n\nAs stated above, the objective was to not only demonstrate, but to encourage students that it’s perfectly okay to solve problems in more than just one way.\n\n“(This lesson) shows students there are many ways to think about the problem and many times the standard way of solving it may not be the easiest. When students have to think outside the box, they come up with truly creative ways to solve the problems,” concluded Schneider.\n\nThe pictures below show the students deep in thought with their various ways of solving problems on the Whiteboard.\n\nMrs. Vicky Moore is excited to introduce a new strategy for teaching all students to read with fluency and comprehension. Known as “Reading is Me, Reading is Thinking, Reading is Power,” this innovative program focuses on teaching impactful reading strategies to boost comprehension in third grade.\n\n“I took a summer workshop on-line,” stated Moore about her initiative. In the training, Moore and her colleagues learned that “reading strategies involve the reader, (while) reading skills involve the text only.” She now is implementing these new strategies with her students. “My goal is to teach students how to think about their own thinking,” she explained.\n\nThe program strategies involve the following skills:\n\n1.) Schema is similar to background or prior knowledge. Students should be able to access their schema before, during, and after reading. They should be able to answer this question: “How will what I already know impact my understanding?” If not, they should slow down or re-read the passage. Without connecting new learning to old learning, the information will not stick.\n\n2.) Visualization is the ability to make “movies in our mind.” It takes the information from the paper to our ears to our brain. Albert Einstein once said, “If I can’t picture it, I can’t understand it.” Our brains hold on to memories by storing photographic images. Students should use their own memories to connect to themselves, to the text, and to their world.\n\n3.) Making connections to themselves, to the text, and to the world should strengthen their level of understanding of a topic. Our schema (background/prior knowledge) affects our ability to make connections to a topic or to a text. When little or no connections can be made while reading, the level of comprehension and understanding will likely decrease.\n\n4.) Students should be able to ask themselves questions before, during, and after reading or within, beyond, and about the text (to expand their vocabulary level). Asking questions when we are curious, clarifying, predicting, and identifying the author’s intent while reading will enhance our level of comprehension and understanding.\n\n5.) Metacognition simply means “thinking about your thinking.” To be aware of your voice when reading promotes critical thinking. It also helps the reader to monitor their level of comprehension or when they stop comprehending. A good reader must learn to realize when they have stopped understanding.\n\n6.) Determining Importance is the most difficult to teach if students have a lack of schema. Concrete and real-life situations will help students determine and summarize important ideas. Using non-fiction books is a good way to distinguish between important and unimportant ideas. Students will begin to use their metacognition - “thinking about your thinking.”\n\n7.) Synthesizing is the process where readers bring together schema and the reading text to formalize their own original thoughts. Good readers will be able to explain how each part of reading is involved in synthesizing. They also determine when their thinking changed and what caused the change. Lastly, they justify why they are thinking that way. Many times it will be through text evidence.\n\nThese research-based strategies are sure to bring even greater reading skills to many students at Fairview Elementary School. In the picture below, three of Mrs. Moore’s students proudly reference their reading program.\n\nFriday, October 29 was truly a special day at Fairview Elementary School. Not only did it represent the final day of the first grading period, but it was also an opportunity for students to dress up in their Halloween costumes and have a good time celebrating forty-five uninterrupted days of learning so far this school year. Among the teachers who made the day extra special was the first grade team of Mrs. Allison Ciolek, Mrs. Lindsay Imm, Mrs. Jenny Johnson, and Mrs. Molly Nusbaum, who introduced their students to an array of STEM activities throughout the morning.\n\n“Students enjoyed engaging with their peers in various competitive and STEM activities,” explained Ciolek.\n\nSTEM is an acronym which stands for science, technology, engineering, and math. Many of the activities also involved using motor skills in some fashion. Motor skills are those skills that require a person “to manage the process of movement. To execute motor skills, a person’s brain, muscles, and nervous system must all work together.”\n\nExamples of motor skill activities included the following events:\n\n· Toss backwards and catch Starbursts;\n\n· Wrap a Mummy;\n\n· Is it easy to move your face and eat a cookie?;\n\n· Relay Candy Corn;\n\n· Can a donut be eaten from a string without falling onto the floor?;\n\n· Flip the cup over a pop can; and\n\n· Flip the Twix into a cup.\n\nOther activities required students to use either advanced brain power and/or guessing skills. Examples of these activities included the following events:\n\n· Toss and count to ten pumpkins;\n\n· How many M & M’s could be sucked up with a straw and transferred to another plate in one minute?;\n\n· Can a Sweet Tart sour ball bounce and stick to the middle of an Oreo cookie?;\n\n· How far can a Twix be pushed?; and\n\n· Draw anything in a circle contest.\n\nCiolek concluded that it was an enjoyable experience for the first graders: “My first graders had a fun Friday morning doing fall activities.”\n\nCentral Local School officials wish to thank the first grade team for all of their planning and efforts in making the last Friday of the first grading period both a fun and educational experience for their students. Job well done.\n\nShown below, are students participating in three of various activities.\n\n“What an awesome lesson in Mrs. Snyder's fourth grade class today!” exclaimed Mrs. Sherrie Brown after observing Mrs. Brooke Snyder’s fourth grade students engage in a hands-on math lesson appropriately titled M-A-T-H.\n\nThe letters spell out the four different activities involved in the lesson:\n\nM -- Meet with your teacher: The students joined their teacher to practice the box method for two-digit-by-two-digit multiplication. This is a strategy used to help make large number multiplication easier, and it gives the students a better understanding of multiplication and place value.\n\nA -- At your seat: The students completed a two-digit-by-two-digit activity at their seats to reinforce the box method.\n\nT -- Technology: The students completed two-digit-by-two-digit math pixels on their Chromebooks. They had to work out the problem, type in the answers, and the mystery pixel was revealed.\n\nH -- Hands on: The students played multiplication war with a deck of playing cards and a partner. This was used to give the boys and girls extra practice with their basic multiplication facts.\n\nAs the students were meeting in small group with their teacher, they worked on the box method. The box method is a strategy used to multiply large numbers and is a great way to give students a better overall understanding of multiplication, while improving number sense and the knowledge of how to break down numbers.\n\n“When transitioning to the next group, Mrs. Snyder would say ‘FES,’ and the students would say ‘is awesome!’ What a great way to build school spirit!” stated Brown with much excitement in her voice.\n\nOnce all the students had a chance to rotate through each group, they had the opportunity to play Blooket, an online math fact game. “It was tons of fun, and they even let Mrs. Brown join in and win,” explained Snyder.\n\nIn an effort to combine math with geography, the fourth graders had the opportunity to complete a mystery Zoom with a classroom from another state within the United States. The lesson focused on map skills and geography with students from both classes asking questions, one at a time, to try to determine the other classroom's state/location through clues using time zones and bordering states.\n\nWhen all clues had been revealed, Snyder’s fourth grade students won the competition by determining that the competing classroom was located in Maryland.\n\n“This is the second win for our fourth graders after Zooming with students in both Maryland and Alaska,” concluded Brown. “Way to go FES fourth grade!”\n\nIn the pictures bellow, students are shown participating in the lesson.\n\nIn just her first semester teaching science at Fairview HS, Mrs. Rayna Moore has introduced some pretty creative lessons for her physical science students. Her latest gem is a lesson appropriately named “It’s ‘Element’ary!” where students completed a set of activities getting to know atoms, elements, and the periodic table. The lesson combined both individual work and group work, providing students with not only the opportunity to shine as an individual, but also to work as a team.\n\n“First, each student was assigned an element and created one square for the class periodic table,” explained Moore. “Next, each student created their own color coded periodic table to help them understand the trends in characteristics of the elements. Finally, students worked together to use clues to determine the identity of six mystery elements.”\n\nStudents learned skills such as how to model atoms, to determine how many types of each particle are part of an atom, and how to convert moles to grams. The end result for each class was to produce a periodic table such as the one shown in the center picture below.\n\nAmong the students who stood out in this lesson were freshmen Jocelyn Smith and Eli Meyer.\n\nStated Smith about what she learned from this lesson: “I learned atomic numbers and the atomic masses of many elements. I figured out how to separate the metals, non-metals, and metalloids.”\n\nMeyer, too, learned a great deal from this lesson. “Atoms make up all matter,” he explained. “Different elements are unique with atomic mass, protons, neutrons, and electrons. Our Period Table has 118 elements and eighteen groups. (It) includes oxygen, carbon, gases, and metals.”\n\nBoth students agree that hands-on lessons are their preferred manner for learning.\n\n“I prefer hands-on (lessons) because science is not easy for me, and reading out of a book will make me forget things,” said Smith. “If I do hands-on lessons, I remember how to do stuff better.”\n\nMeyer agreed. “I prefer to learn by hands-on lessons because I love having a visual and being taught audibly by a teacher. It’s also fun when you get into a lesson while being taught and having the teachers teach the criteria well.”\n\nMoore is certain the majority of her students not only learned the material, but all had a good time.\n\n“I even heard students saying, ‘this is actually kind of fun,’” concluded Moore.\n\nShowing off her Period Table is freshman Heather Romero (left picture), while freshmen Boden VanderMade, Kasen Schooley, and Zane Timbrook work on the group project as a team (right picture).\n\nAs most parents can attest, one of the most frequent questions they hear from children – young and old – is, “Why do I have to do that?” This question can be especially true when it comes to reading books, lessons, and directions. However, through a creative lesson adapted by Mrs. Amy Eitniear, her fourth grade students learned first-hand just how powerful reading is when it comes to being successful, whether through short-term projects or exploring other parts of the world.\n\n“I wanted to explain why reading is important,” noted Eitnear. The essential questions she wished to have answered were: 1.) What power do people who read have over people who do not read? 2.) How does reading give us power? 3.) What can we use our reading power for?\n\nTo demonstrate one power of reading, Eitnear gave her students the necessary materials to build a catapult. After dividing the students into groups, the students attempted to build a catapult with nothing but the materials. No written instructions and very little explanation as to what a catapult even is.\n\nAfter allowing them five minutes to build a catapult, Eitnear paused the activity to get her students’ feedback at that point.\n\n“I wanted to know what was frustrating for them? What could have made it easier? And why did one group do better than the others.”\n\nAfter listening to various responses, she gave them written instructions, which outlined what a catapult is and how to go about properly constructing one with the materials on hand. Students were encouraged to read the instructions and to refer to them as often as they needed to do so. Again, students were given a few minutes to complete the tasks. Without exception, the second time around was much more successful.\n\n“Students ended the lesson with a sound understanding that reading gives us power and knowledge that we can’t get anywhere else,” explained Eitnear. And it’s far more than just reading instructions for building a project.\n\nShe continued: “When we read, we learn, expand our minds, are taken to unique places around the world, and get to experience things we may never get to in real life. Reading is the ultimate travel guide. It’s the ultimate teacher. Reading is life.”\n\nEitnear concluded the lesson by directing her students to the book Calvin Can’t Fly. In this book, Calvin is a young bird who instead of learning how to fly, decides to learn how to read. His friends make fun of him until a day comes when his reading knowledge saves the day!\n\nIn the pictures below, three different groups of students try out their finished products.\n\nThe Fairview HS World Languages Club (WLC) continues to be a very active student-led organization as evidenced by the array of activities students partook in during the annual WLC Week. With the standard goal of celebrating and promoting world languages & cultures, club members interacted with various staff and community members to bring a great experience for all.\n\nThrough the mentoring of Mrs. Jacqueline Davis and the leadership of senior Jalee Elson and junior Jenna Collins, members participated in a multitude of interdisciplinary activities. For example, students collaborated with Mrs. Sally Miller in the library to highlight and purchase new multicultural literature, which promoted the annual WLC Reading Challenge; and students collaborated with Ms. Chris Bok in the cafeteria to serve Brazilian BBQ pork, Japanese teriyaki chicken, Irish potato soup, and French toast, which introduced them to tasty dishes many had never tried before.\n\nExplained Collins: “Each year, World Languages Club has a whole week dedicated to different countries and cultures. Each day, we had a new activity to go along with the country we were celebrating.”\n\nOther promotions included a “Snack Crate,” colorful flags in the hall, and trivia in the mornings with prizes. Additionally, each day had a dress-up theme that included St. Patrick’s Day and clothing featuring international locations, languages, themes. The week concluded with a free movie night for Fairview students and their families at Defiance Cinema 9, where senior WLC member Merrick Breckler is employed. A good turnout of students and family members were entertained by the film Raya and the Last Dragon, which is inspired by a number of Southeast Asian cultures.\n\n“Ms. Bok was kind and served a food item from the country we were celebrating that day,” continued Collins. “In addition, the new Disney movie Raya and the Last Dragon has come out in theaters and to conclude the week, we held a movie at the theater for free to anyone who wanted to attend.”\n\nTo help add some sizzle to the trivia questions, students had an incentive to compete and be the first student to correctly answer the questions.\n\n“Each day, we had a question over the announcements and the first person to come down with the correct answer got a food item from that country,” explained Collins. “Along with that, on St. Patrick’s Day we gave away a Kalahari Day Pass to one lucky winner wearing green. The winner was Jace Chapman!”\n\nMrs. Davis was extremely complimentary of the work done by Elson: “This was her last year leading this, and she has done an excellent job leading and planning.”\n\nShe also sent out her appreciation to Mrs. Terri Cooper and her daughter Kayla Cooper for donating boxes from “Snack Crate.” Students were able to try candies and snacks"
