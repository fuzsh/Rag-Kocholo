        "text": "Gladstone: A Biography by Sir Philip Magnus\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone was one of the most extraordinary statesmen of the 19th century. He began his political career as a Conservative, sitting for a rotten borough; under the influence of Peel and following his experience as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1850s, he attached himself to the Whigs and became the spokesman for middle-class liberalism by the mid-1860s. He served as Liberal Prime Minister four times and presided over many important reforms in both domestic and foreign policy. His charitable but controversial work among prostitutes has failed to detract from the reputation of this great politican.\n\n* 'All who care for serious biography will find it absorbing' - THE TIMES * 'What an excellent book' - Sir Harold Nicolson * 'He writes with lucid grace; his judgement strikes me as almost impeccable' - THE SUNDAY TIMES * 'He was one of the giants of the age. Sir Philip Magnus has done full justice to his commanding personality' - DAILY MAIL"
