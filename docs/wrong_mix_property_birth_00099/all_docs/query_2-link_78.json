        "text": "We look forward to the time when the Power of Love will replace the Love of Power. Then will our world know the blessings of peace.\n\n~William Ewart Gladstone\n\nLast week, I felt the power of love. Twitter followers from all over the world came out in a big way to nominate me for the Shorty Awards. Today, I am in the finals in third place!\n\nVoting for the winners in each category begins today at noon EST and lasts until Friday, February 5 at noon. I would sure appreciate your vote in the #art category if you are on Twitter!\n\nI also ask that you vote for my good friend @FrugalDougal, who is nominated in the #nonprofit category. @FrugalDougal is the mastermind behind the monthly Pawpawty that raises money for animal charities around the world.\n\nThanks to all for showing your love. I love YOU so much!!!\n\nLife is an Adventure!\n\nBZTAT\n\nWow!\n\nYesterday, I began asking Twitter followers to support me by nominating me for a Shorty Award in #art. I was in 31st place at the time.\n\nAt this writing, I have risen in the ranks, and I am now in 16th place! Thank you so much to those who have nominated me!\n\nI am especially grateful to the “anipals”, or animals who tweet, a very special group of tweeters who have shown lots of love. The anipals support animal causes on and off of Twitter, and it is for them that I would like to win the award. They have supported my pet portraits on Twitter with great enthusiasm, and I want to win this for them.\n\nIt is within reach, but still a long ways off, however. I need to get into the top 5 by Friday.\n\nPlease help out by nominating here and by encouraging other tweeters to do the same.\n\nAnd while you are at it, please nominate a very special anipal, @FrugalDougal, in the #nonprofit category as well. Dougal is the “Chief Dog Officer” of the Paw Pawty, a monthly Twitter event to raise money for animal charities.\n\nThank you so much for your support!\n\nLife is an Adventure!\n\nBZTAT"
