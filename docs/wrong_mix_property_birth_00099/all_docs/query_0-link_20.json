        "text": "by Gladstones Library | Tuesday, 25th September 2018\n\nAlthough not Welsh himself, in 1894 William Ewart Gladstone decided to found his library across the Welsh border for good reason. The beautiful, remote countryside of Hawarden village, as well as nearby historic areas such as Ruthin and Mold, are steeped in culture and Welsh heritage. With an abundance of hills, forests and, of course, castles, as well as the mountain range of Snowdonia, Gladstone envisaged that rather than the congested streets of London, Liverpool or Manchester, North Wales would serve as the perfectly serene backdrop for his incredible legacy as well as provide the necessary air of tranquillity for study and contemplation.\n\nby Gladstones Library | Thursday, 13th September 2018\n\nYou may have been on one of our Glimpses (our short tours of the library) before but, I promise you, you havenâ€™t been told about these books yet!\n\nby Gladstones Library | Wednesday, 12th September 2018\n\nWe are delighted to announce the names of the six winners of our Writers in Residence award and the two winners of our Politics in Residence prize 2019."
