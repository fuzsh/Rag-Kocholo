Each school also has its own leader.\n\nOur History\n\nThe College was founded in 1840 to serve the needs of the growing city of Liverpool. William Ewart Gladstone spoke at the foundation and was one of the founders of the College. Liverpool College was a Founder Members of HMC. In 1929, the College moved to its current site in the leafy suburbs of Mossley Hill. In 1993, the College became fully coeducational by its amalgamation with the independent girls school, Huyton College. In 1999, the College established its coeducational preparatory school for pupils aged between three and eleven, by merging its preparatory and pre-preparatory bases.\n\nIn more recent years, the College underwent an ambitious development programme which included a major College-wide refurbishment and restructuring programme, an innovative partnership with the University of Liverpool and the introduction of Sixth Form international boarding. All this was rounded off with an excellent inspection report from ISI in February 2012.\n\nIn June 2012, Liverpool College announced that the Secretary of State for Education had accepted their submission to transition the College to Academy status in September 2013 (an academy is an independent school funded directly by central government). This followed a comprehensive and strategic review of the future options for the development of Liverpool College. The government felt that the College's submission, which included an educational plan and vision, would enhance and develop the educational opportunities offered by the College for current and future pupils.\n\nIn September 2013, Liverpool College became an all-through academy for pupils aged 4 to 19 years old. It serves the local and wider community, and welcomes applications from parents both within and outside the Liverpool area.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nFinancial Statements 2016-17\n\nFinancial Statements 2015-16\n\nFinancial Statements 2014-15\n\nAnnual Accounts 2013-14\n\nValue for Money Statement 2013-14\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\nPlease click here to access our Privacy Notice"
