        "text": "Originally a boys school and constructed massively of local sandstone, Hawarden Masonic Hall was built in 1877. Its origins owe their development to the Education Act of 1875, enacted by the Liberal Government, of which William Ewart Gladstone of Hawarden Castle was Prime Minister, which stated that all children above 5 years of age should receive an education.\n\nThe premises functioned as a boys school until 1912 when it was replaced by a new school, denominated Canon Drew School, now demolished.\n\nThe old boys school was used as a Masonic Hall by St. Deiniol's Lodge no.3272, and in 1912 the lodge purchased the building from the Church Authorities.\n\nThe former school house was built by Rector Glynne 1834, and perhaps designed by Thomas Jones\n\n(compare Mold, Old County Hall). It was converted as the Masonic Hall in 1913.\n\nArchitectural details: a 6-bay rectangular hall in Jacobethan style, of sandstone ashlar on a continuous plinth. Medium pitched slate roof with plain eaves. Coped gables to north and south with crocketted finials, diagonally set, and corbelled out. Large, centrally-placed lateral chimneys, stepped and with single octagonal shafts. That to the east has inserted moulded plaque bearing inscription Masonic Hall 1913 in raised lettering. Shield with Masonic badge above. Symmetrical east facade with two 2-light mullioned and one single-light window to either side of stack. Recessed and chamfered surrounds.
