        "text": "William Hamo Thornycroft [also known as Hamo Thornycroft; and as Sir William Hamo Thornycroft] was born at 39 Stanhope Street, Regent's Park, London, England on 9 March 1850 and was the son of Thomas Thornycroft (1815â1885) and Mary Thornycroft (nÃ©e Francis, 1809â1895) who were both sculptors. He initially trained as a sculptor in his parentsâ studio and then studied at the Royal Academy Schools in London from 1869 to 1875. In 1871-72 he travelled to Italy via France and in 1875 was awarded the Royal Academy gold medal for his sculpture 'A Warrior Bearing a Wounded Youth from the Field of Battle'. Thotnycroft then embarked on a highly successful career as a sculptor. While still a student at the RA Schools, he exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1872 and continued to do so virtually every year until 1926, the year after his death."
