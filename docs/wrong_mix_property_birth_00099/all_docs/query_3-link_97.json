Four times Liberal Prime Minister between 1868 and 1894, Gladstone had left an enormous archive of letters, papers and diaries, which Morley (1838-1923), himself a noted Liberal politician and writer, spent five years distilling into three volumes. Although many other biographies and editions have since been published, Morley's work is still valuable for his use of primary sources, especially for the earlier part of Gladstone's career. Morley avoids overt party bias, but is understandably discreet in his treatment of more recent political events. He also ignores more private aspects of his subject's life and, as an agnostic, did not empathise with Gladstone's strong religious convictions. Volume 1 covers Gladstone's education, his election as a Tory, his first period as Chancellor of the Exchequer and his move towards the Liberals in 1859.",
