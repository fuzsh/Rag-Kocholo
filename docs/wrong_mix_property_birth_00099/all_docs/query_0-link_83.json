        "text": "The deadline for this call has now passed.\n\nApply now to join The Sociological Review’s annual residential writing retreat for early career scholars, which this year will be held over three days in November at a beautiful rural location in Wales. Fourteen places will be awarded on a competitive basis to PhD students and postdocs, and the retreat is free of charge to attend.\n\nAbout The Sociological Review’s 2022 ECR Writing Retreat\n\nSince 2016, the Sociological Review Foundation’s annual writing retreat has offered early career scholars the chance to focus on writing a journal article or chapter of a PhD thesis within a supportive and focused environment.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that in 2022, our ECR writing retreat will be facilitated by Sociological Review editorial board members Professor Steven Brown and Dr Cath Lambert. The retreat, which will take place at Gladstone’s Library in the village of Hawarden in Wales, will offer participants a wonderful opportunity to spend three days writing in a tranquil environment under the guidance of qualified writing retreat facilitators, as well as the opportunity to rest, socialise and enjoy the beautiful surroundings of Hawarden village.\n\nStrictly Come Writing 2022 will be free to attend for the 14 participants selected in open competition, with all writing sessions, meals and on-site accommodation provided.\n\nDate and location\n\nStrictly Come Writing 2022 will be held at Gladstone’s Library. It will begin at 13.00 on Wednesday 2 November and conclude at 17.00 on Friday 4 November.\n\nGladstone’s Library is located in Church Lane, Hawarden, Flintshire, CH5 3DF, Wales. The village of Hawarden is 7 miles from Chester and 30 miles from Liverpool Airport.\n\nFounded by William Ewart Gladstone and overseen by a registered charity, this unique institution centres on a residential library that contains over 200,000 volumes of theology and history as well as material on philosophy, classics, art and literature.\n\nAims and activities\n\nThe aim of Strictly Come Writing 2022 is to give participants the opportunity to advance their writing on a journal article or chapter of a PhD thesis within a supportive environment free of surveillance and distractions.\n\nWork during the retreat will be based on the principles developed by Grant & Knowles (2000), McGrail et al. (2006), Murray and Newton (2009) and Murray (2012).\n\nParticipants will receive information about the preparation they will be expected to undertake prior to the retreat. Retreat days will comprise timed writing sessions, with all delegates writing in one room at the same time, with facilitators telling participants when to start and when to stop. Facilitators will also provide one-on-one support during breaks, and will moderate peer discussion to review progress during the retreat.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nStrictly Come Writing 2022 is a writing retreat for early career scholars: postdocs who are within three years of the award of their doctorate (excluding career breaks for paternity, maternity or health reasons), and postgraduate research students within the final or write-up year of their PhD studies.\n\nThere are 14 places available on this year’s retreat, to be awarded on a competitive basis. All applications will be peer reviewed by members of The Sociological Review editorial board.\n\nDue to the significant cost to The Sociological Review Foundation to run these annual retreats, successful applicants will be required to make a refundable deposit of £50 to secure their place.\n\nBursaries\n\nStrictly Come Writing 2022 is free of charge to those awarded a place, including all writing sessions, meals, single-occupancy accommodation for the nights of Wednesday 2 and Thursday 3 November 2022, and transportation between Chester train station and Gladstone’s Library.\n\nFor early career researchers who meet the relevant criteria, we offer travel bursaries of £100 for UK-based applicants and £200 for non-UK based applicants, and childcare bursaries of £70 per day. Further details about bursaries are provided in the application form for Strictly Come Writing 2022.\n\nPlease note that we will consider applications for bursaries only from unfunded students who are not in receipt of scholarships, or funding from research councils or their home institutions to support their studies. Those who are receipt of a full-time wage are not eligible for the above bursaries, with the exception of ECR teaching fellows on a contract of 12 months or less, with no institutional conference/event attendance funding.\n\nWe will seek verification of the employment and funding status of those selected for bursaries.\n\nHow to apply\n\nApply to join Strictly Come Writing 2022 via this form.\n\nIf you have any questions about this application process, please email events@thesociologicalreview.com\n\nDeadline\n\nThe deadline to apply to join Strictly Come Writing 2022, The Sociological Review’s annual ECR writing retreat, is Monday 12 September, 17.00 BST/UTC+1."
