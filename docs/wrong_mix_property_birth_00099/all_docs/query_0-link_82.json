        "text": "Liverpool was at its trading peak during the late Georgian and early Victorian periods and its affluent merchants were seeking grand houses outside of the town centre.\n\nIt was during this period that Hope Street and Rodney Street were laid out and the building of fine houses began.\n\nTake a journey back in time and learn about the famous residents and rich history of this era.\n\nRodney Street is one of the few streets that would still be recognisable by Liverpoolâs 19th Century residents. It has been used as the backdrop for many big film productions as well as a whole load of TV series â Peaky Blinders being one. The street has been associated with Edinburghâs resurrectionists (grave robbers). It has been home to a prime minister, famous merchants, industrialists and it even has its very own pyramid tomb.\n\nHope Street has developed as a bohemian area with trendy bars, restaurants and a theatre but retains a fascinating history associated with its buildings and sculptures.\n\nHope Street is named after William Hope, a merchant whose house stood on the site now occupied by the Philharmonic Hall. Hope Street was voted as the best street in the UK and Ireland by The Academy of Urbanism, who awarded it The Great Street 2013.\n\nThe award of the 2014 Stirling Architectural Prize for the renovation of the Everyman Theatre again turned the spotlight on Hope Street, one of the best-known streets in Liverpool. Famously linking the two cathedrals, it contains many cultural, social and public buildings. In addition to the Everyman, thereâs the Philharmonic Hall, the Philharmonic Pub, a Masonic Lodge and a Womanâs Centre. However, in its 200-year history, Hope Streetâs 600-yard length has also seen a hospital and homeopathic dispensary, a number of churches, an art school and a high school for girls.\n\nBy 1800, the built-up area of Liverpool covered what is now the core of the City Centre, the area west of Lime Street Station. Parts of Rodney Street, to east, had been developed, whilst Hope Street had been laid out, but contained no buildings.\n\nJohn Foster (a famous Liverpool architect responsible for many buildings during this period and buried in St Jamesâs Cemetery) made plans for housing development in this outer area and construction soon followed.\n\nRodney Street is named in honour of Admiral Lord Rodney, triumphant defender of British interests in the West Indies from 1779 to 1782. Rodney Street was laid out by William Roscoe and others 1783-4, the beginning of a Georgian residential development built to house the affluent away from the old town centre.\n\nRodney Street in Liverpool, England is noted for the number of doctors who practise there and its Georgian architecture. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Harley Street of the North\". Together with Hope Street and Gambier Terrace it forms the Rodney Street conservation area. There are over 60 Grade II listed buildings on the street and one Grade II* former church.\n\nSome of the street's famous residents are as follows:\n\n~ Henry Booth merchant, entrepreneur, and engineer\n\n~ Arthur Hugh Clough and Anne Clough were born in the street\n\n~ William Henry Duncan, appointed as Liverpool's first Medical Officer of Health in 1847\n\n~ William Ewart Gladstone was born at number 62\n\n~ E. ChambrÃ© Hardman, photographer, studio at no 59\n\n~ Nicholas Monsarrat, novelist, was born on the street.\n\n~ William Roscoe, developer and historian\n\n~ James Maury, the first United States consul from 1790 to 1829, lived at 4 Rodney Street\n\n~ Brian Epstein, manager of The Beatles, was born at no 4 Rodney Street in 1934\n\nJoin this tour to learn about the history of Liverpool during the late Georgian and early Victorian periods and discover how some of the more famous residents changed and influenced world developments â many of which we take for granted today.\n\nAt the end of the tour it is possible to visit the Victoria Museum housed in the original University of Liverpool building and displays a whole host of fascinating (and sometimes gruesome) medical artefacts from Victorian times.\n\nFurther Information (For day of tour)\n\nThis is a walking tour where you will be outdoors for most of the time. In the case of wet weather please bring suitable clothing. You should also have comfortable footwear as there is a fair amount of walking. This tour is accessible for wheelchair users."
