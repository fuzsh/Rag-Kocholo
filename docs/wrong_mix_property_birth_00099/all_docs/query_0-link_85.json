        "text": "Where did your ancestors live?\n\nIt is impossible to trace the history of oneâ€™s family without considering where they lived. Local history societies and one-place study groups have researched and published content that will allow you to place the lives of your ancestors in the context of their local communities, villages, towns and cities as well as some of the key socio-economic factors that lay behind their development. They often use the same sources as family historians, and can help provide an alternative interpretation of a document or suggest new resources to help your research.\n\nNick Barratt, Historian and Author\n\nWin Stokes\n\nI came to BALH via CORAL (the Conference of Regional and Local Historians) when the two organisations merged. CORAL was largely the brainchild of the late John D. Marshall and dedicated to offering a perspective on local history wider that the then frequently parochial one offered by some of the smaller societies. 'My' region was and is the North East of England and particularly County Durham where I was born and schooled. After over twenty years of living in East London and lecturing on a diversity of courses at North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) I have now spent almost an equal amount of time researching early nineteenth century North East business history and based on Tyneside..\n\nI still see myself at BALH as I did on the committee of CORAL as a voice for the region stretching from the Tweed to the Tees. As chair of the County Durham History and Heritage Forum which is an umbrella organisation I have regular opportunities for networking with and lecturing to local history societies across the region, make regular contributions to the Journal of the Durham County Local History Society and Cleveland History and have published material on railway companies in the Conference papers of the Early Railways group. Currently I am preparing for publication the history of the iron and coking industries of the North East initiated by my late father who worked in these industries all his life. My own study of joint stock enterprise in the region is on hold although excerpts have appeared as conference papers and articles. Because of this background I have opted to sit on the BALH Publications committee to which I hope I can be a useful contributor.\n\nWin Stokes, Publishing Committee"
