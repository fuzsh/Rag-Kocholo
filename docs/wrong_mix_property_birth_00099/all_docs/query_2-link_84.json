However, it should interpreted less as a landmark on his journey from reactionary to liberal, but rather more as raising a basic issue in British-Canadian relations which, arguably, he never fully resolved. Overall, the study emphasises elements of continuity in his attitude to British North America throughout a long and active political career. His appeals to the Canadian example in support of Irish Home Rule should be seen as an inconsistent tailpiece, a minor rhetorical theme and definitely not a determining issue in the evolution of his policy towards Ireland.\n\nContents\n\nA: INTRODUCTION\n\nB: GLADSTONE AND CANADA, 1835-1885\n\nC: GLADSTONE, IRELAND AND THE ANALOGIES WITH CANADA\n\n[Continued in \"Gladstone Through the Looking Glass\"]\n\nD: GLADSTONE: AN ATTEMPT AT INTERPRETATION\n\nE: THE EXUBERANCE OF HIS OWN VERBOSITY: A TAILPIECE ON METHOD\n\nF: CONCLUSION\n\nA: INTRODUCTION\n\nThis essay began as an attempt to set in broader context Gladstone’s attempt in 1849 to prevent the Canadian parliament from passing legislation which he believed paid compensation to inhabitants of Lower Canada (mostly Francophones) who had participated in the rebellions of 1837-8. An accompanying study, which concentrates upon the events and issues of 1849, is itself based upon an article published in 1977.[1] This concentrated on the implications of responsible government, the system recently conceded to the united province of Canada, but with its limits carefully undefined: in 1977, control over Canada’s constitution, the British North America Act, was still formally vested in the Westminster parliament, and it seemed worth examining the origins of this increasingly irrelevant ambiguity. Yet even then, I was struck by the centrality in the Rebellion Losses debate of Gladstone himself, especially the combination his portentously precise identification of the boundary between Imperial and colonial spheres of responsibility and his apparently naïve expectation that MPs would accept both his motivation and his tactics at his own valuation. In British political history, the episode remains an important if under-emphasised illustration of the internal strains of the centrist Peelite group. In Canadian history, as I argue in the accompanying essay, the Rebellion Losses controversy merits re-evaluation as part of the process of rebuilding a political community in the aftermath of the divisive rebellions of 1837-8. Hence 1849 stands alone as a specific and separate study, although the main themes of Gladstone’s colonial theorising on that occasion are considered here as they arise. During his final years, he engaged in a heart-searching process in which he identified major errors in his political career, although it is possible that the exercise was intended either to deceive himself or to direct the attention of future historians into relatively safe channels.[2] In this exercise, he did not return to 1849, despite the evident trauma of his failure in the Commons that year. It is important to stress that Gladstone never formally disavowed his campaign against the Rebellion Losses bill, although he certainly shifted to approaches that enabled him to sidestep his uncompromising stance.\n\nThe essay is also designed to serve a wider purpose, outlining aspects of Gladstone's involvement with Canadian issues throughout six decades in public life. To accept this as a worthwhile exercise, it is first necessary to grasp that, from the eighteen-thirties until at least the Second World War, Canada formed part of the mental world of leading British politicians. Senior politicians, especially cabinet ministers, were generally aware of major Canadian issues, and often had contact with their Canadian counterparts to a much greater extent than is the case today. The relationship was not always entirely harmonious, but it did exist, although it usually played a relative secondary role, one that is easily filtered out of biographies and textbooks.[3] Any historian attempting an overview of Gladstone’s long and massively complex career must necessarily be selective, and by the late twentieth century, relations with Canada had become a low priority. (If Canadians were offended by such myopia, they might take comfort in the fact that another formidable presence in Gladstone’s universe, Almighty God, to use his favourite term, has also tended to be quietly eclipsed in a cumulative biographical approach that was not only metropolitan but also secular.) Indeed, it might be fairly conceded that downplaying the role of Canada in his career risked at worst some minor distortion in his world picture. But though Canada might be discounted from Gladstone’s career, Ireland could not be omitted: in 1886, when he attempted to introduce Home Rule, it was to the Canadian example of self-government that he appealed (although, as will be seen, neither very often nor with any great profundity). Thus Gladstone's various involvements with British North America do constitute part of the full record, and call for assessment. Indeed, a case may be made for the centrality of Canada, if not in the day-to-day priorities of his political career, but at least in the determination of its overall trajectory. Unfortunately, this would require acceptance of a traditional, almost mythic, interpretation of Gladstone's career, one set in stone by Morley in 1903, as a pilgrimage from reaction to liberalism.\n\nGladstone himself believed that his engagement with Canadian problems played a part in his move towards liberalism. \"Colonial subjects … made a first breach in my Toryism\", he claimed in 1892.[4] Thus it would seem that Canada was not simply one of the many subjects upon which Gladstone steadily moved from his original world-view of authoritarian conservatism towards enlightenment, but arguably provided an important trigger in the process of his conversion. As will become apparent, there were important elements of continuity in the positions that he adopted on British North American issues: if liberalism is assumed to embrace generosity of spirit, it has be conceded that he was consistently unsympathetic towards Canadian aspirations. He never fully abandoned his position of 1849 that the colony (or, later province, and then Dominion) owed obligations to Britain, nor that Britain for its part would determine the extent of its reciprocal responsibilities – and how best, indeed how far, to discharge them. The enthusiasm which he later demonstrated towards oppressed peoples on the fringes of Europe was never aroused for kindred communities across the Atlantic.[5]\n\nTwo fundamental elements characterised Gladstone's involvement with Canadian issues. One is that they intersected with his political trajectory at intervals for fifty years from the earliest years of his political career, although their intensity slackened during its final decade. While they were generally (but, as in 1849, not always) of secondary importance to him overall, they extended over a longer period than most of his intensive concerns: for instance, Ireland only became a pressing question for him after 1867,[6] South Africa and Egypt intruded upon him for relatively brief periods in the early eighteen-eighties.[7] As a result, if the unifying theme in the Gladstone story was his gradual movement from Tory darkness to Liberal enlightenment – Canada, in its persistent if low-key reappearances, may reveal more than more intense but short-lived episodes such as his enthusiasm for the Bulgarians in the late eighteen-seventies, or the Armenians in his twilight years two decades later. It is also worth noting that, for all his encyclopedic hyperactivity, there were subjects that never seriously concerned him. In Europe, he interested himself in France, Germany and Italy, but hardly at all in Spain and Portugal. His family origins were in the North Sea port of Leith, and his Scottish connections were all along the east coast, but it was 1885 before he discovered Norway. His father owned plantations in British Guiana, the Empire's only South American colony, yet – despite his admiration for Canning – he took almost no interest in Latin America. Perhaps most noteworthy of all was the relatively small role played by India in his career, although he appointed viceroys, grumbled about the finances of the Raj and – briefly in the Midlothian era – proclaimed his outraged sympathy for the Afghans.[8] (This myopia was despite the fact that Gladstone's father traded to Calcutta [Kolkata] and his own son Henry spent fourteen years in business there.)[9] Japan began its adventure with modernity with the Meiji restoration in 1868, the year Gladstone formed his first government, yet he took almost no interest in its affairs.[10] Similarly, in domestic affairs he made little or no contribution to what were called sanitary questions: godliness excited him much more than cleanliness.\n\nThe second key element in the picture is that his handling of Canadian questions generally subordinated them to some larger concern of his own. His various stances were successively filtered through principles distilled from questions as varied as imperial supremacy, free trade, the Church, retrenchment in public expenditure, defence, relations with the United States and – finally, if obliquely – Ireland. Canada’s comet-like reappearance upon his political agenda at intervals of a few years each time meant that, in effect, he was responding to a different Canada on each occasion, and it is likely that he did not always appreciate that he was dealing with a moving target. The unstable frontier colonies of the eighteen-thirties had merged by 1849 into a united province – in outline structure at least – and would evolve, thanks to railways and a developing bureaucratic structure, into the Confederation established in 1867 that included much of eastern British North America. By the eighteen-eighties, the transcontinental Dominion was virtually an associated state which preserved its links with Britain partly for convenience but essentially for survival alongside a larger and potentially voracious United States.[11] Unfortunately, it is doubtful how far Gladstone appreciated that he was dealing with a society engaged in continuous evolution. Notwithstanding his proclaimed shift towards liberalism on colonial issues, he continued to expect a sometimes burdensome degree of Canadian deference to British interests. Given his intermittent engagement with the colony-cum-Dominion, it might be concluded that Gladstone's attitude to Canada was predominantly negative for much of his career, until the moment sometime in 1885-6 when he drew upon the example of the Dominion to justify the extension of local self-government to Ireland. In fact the Gladstone of 1886 never repudiated the Gladstone of 1849, leaving unresolved a central problem of metropolitan-periphery relations in both the colonial relationship and Irish Home Rule.\n\nGladstone’s engagement with Canada may be divided into three phases. For much of his first two decades in public life, a broad knowledge of colonial affairs constituted one of the political strengths that gave him some claim upon the ear of the House of Commons, and hence helped keep him at the forefront of politics during years spent in apparently directionless opposition. Yet he acquired this status accidentally. Gladstone became Under-Secretary for the Colonies, at the age of 25, because Peel believed that the appointment of the son of a slave-owner would reassure the West Indian planters that their interests would be protected during the process of Emancipation. Hence he became involved in Canadian issues – a major headache for the Colonial Office in the eighteen-thirties – incidentally, peripherally and without much sign of enthusiastic engagement. Regarded as a parliamentary authority on Canadian affairs, he was primarily concerned with the nature and limits of colonial self-government, although he also involved himself in other questions, for instance working to secure the future of the Anglican Church overseas, and to oppose the territorial rights of the Hudson’s Bay Company. It would be his concern for the Church of England in the colonies that provided him with a secondary route towards a more relaxed attitude to Canadian self-government.\n\nDuring the eighteen-fifties, Gladstone moved into a second phase of his political career, successfully rebranding himself as a champion of financial rectitude. His \"economical venom\"[12] not only brought him into conflict with the more relaxed fiscal attitudes of Canada's development-minded politicians, but led him to look towards the gradual dissolution of the link between Britain and the emerging Dominion altogether. Yet the two apparently inverse approaches that characterise these two phases of Gladstone’s career mask underlying continuities: indeed, formal separation was an eventuality that he had discussed as early as 1838. Until 1849 (at least) he viewed Canada as a dependency, in which Britain retained the right to intervene against dishonourable and disloyal activities. Certainly from 1865, and probably earlier, he treated Canada as a type of associated state (\"morally in the attitude of an independent Power” as he put it that year), but one that was under obligation to respect the interests of its protector. (Britain, by contrast, retained its freedom to determine the nature and the extent of the defensive shield that it might confer.) In 1871, those two perceptions, one involving British suzerainty, the other Canadian deference, were brutally fused together during the negotiations for the Treaty of Washington, in which the Dominion paid a large share of the price of buying off American intimidation.\n\nSuddenly, in 1886, Gladstone's predominantly negative attitudes gave way to unprecedented enthusiasm: Canada was “loyal and friendly” to Britain, thanks to the concession of self-government – and the panacea would work equally effectively if Home Rule was granted to Ireland. Of course, it might be concluded that, in the mid-eighteen eighties, Gladstone was startled into recognising the unexpected fact that the Dominion was still part of the British Empire, and determined to apply the magic remedy of local self-government to Ireland. If so, the revelation was certainly a convenient coincidence. Unfortunately, it is also hard to believe, not least because the Gladstone of 1886 never repudiated the Gladstone of 1849, leaving unresolved a central problem in both the colonial relationship and Irish Home Rule. The benign myth has endured partly because the Canadian dimension to Gladstone’s political career has been excised from the standard biographical record, thereby obscuring the blunt truth that his own attitude to British’s transatlantic territories had fallen markedly short of amicability. In fact, as Section C explores, there were two Canadian analogies floating around in the Home Rule debates, one likening potential relations between Westminster and Dublin to those between Britain and the Dominion, the other seeing them in terms of the balance between Ottawa and the provinces. Neither would prove particularly helpful, informative or durable. In particular, Gladstone's apparent lack of awareness (which he shared with most British politicians) of the changing balance of internal relations between the Dominion government in Ottawa and the country's largest province, Ontario, entirely undermined his assumption that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council could act as the effective arbiter between the parliaments of Westminster and College Green. Indeed, it was the decisions of the Judicial Committee that were unstitching the centralised structure designed in 1867.\n\nA study of Gladstone and Canada must obviously seek any device or process that might establish a connection between Gladstone's 1849 insistence upon a distinct sphere of imperial supremacy that carried the right to intervene in the internal affairs of Canada, and his confident assertion in and (occasionally) after 1886 that Britain and Ireland could effectively co-exist under Home Rule, an argument buttressed by appeals to the Canadian parallel. In fact, as late as the early eighteen-eighties, he remained reluctant to regard the Dominion as a possible model for Irish devolution. His conversion to Home Rule in 1885-6 was accompanied by characteristic oratorical sleight of hand, by which he projected himself as an elder statesman who had helped steer Canada to nationality and freedom without in fact explicitly renouncing his earlier views on the limits of colonial autonomy. To put it mildly, there is some danger of simplification in attempting to construct links between his attitude of 1849, that Canada was disloyal and untrustworthy, and his 1886 celebration of a Canada that had become loyal and friendly.\n\nIndeed, it would surely be at least unbalanced and probably unhelpful if this study were to convey a great deal of information about Canada, much of it arcane, at the cost of endorsing and thereby reinforcing mythic stereotypes of the man himself. Baldly summarised, Gladstone has habitually been portrayed – and depicted himself – as someone who moved from the depressing darkness of toryism towards the enlightened sunshine of liberalism. It was an all-embracing, all-explaining matrix that he himself encouraged. \"I was brought up to distrust and dislike liberty\", he remarked in 1891, \"I learned to believe in it. That is the key to all my changes.\"[13] The Canada-related aspects of his career point rather to complex intellectual positions that are not easily captured in the blanket categorisations of reactionary conservatism or progressive liberalism. Accordingly, this essay proceeds from the specific to the speculative, seeking to explore the nature of the political positions that Gladstone adopted, and the processes by which they changed. In seeking to understand his decision-making processes, I have drawn upon two contemporary children's stories, the tale of Goldilocks and the fable of Alice Through the Looking Glass. These are discussed in Section D, but I outline them here in order to signpost references to them at various points in the discussion.\n\nThe first refers to Gladstone's predilection for adopting highly precise solutions to problems, prescriptions that often avoided extremes in some awkward fusion of opposites that only he could discern, and only he could steer into law. This I liken to the formula identified by Goldilocks for the ideal temperature of porridge, unspecified but subjectively pronounced to be \"just right\". I call Gladstone's version of this process \"abitrary calibration\", the advocacy of some exact position that was not simply \"just right\" but, more particularly, just and right. The concept of arbitrary calibration invites readers to imagine that, on divisive political issues, opinions may be registered on a scale from 0 to 100, from total opposition to reform through to fervent support for change. Gladstone himself frequently adopted all-or-nothing positions on major questions, but he was also prone to adopting highly precise positions, which might register at 28 or 57 or 83 on the calibrated scale. His opposition to the Rebellion Losses bill was a classic example, indeed one where it is difficult to measure his score at all, since he apparently accepted the principle of colonial self-government but insisted that it should be cut off at an exact point that was evidently not obvious to other British politicians. But while some of Gladstone's policy positions were bafflingly complex, his tempestuous oratory managed to project the notion that others were more sweeping than their small-print, terms-and-conditions actually conveyed. The classic example of this was his success in 1864 in making support for a relatively modest extension of the right to vote sound like an endorsement of manhood suffrage, thereby capturing the loyalty of a large and unquestioning section of public opinion.\n\nOnce Gladstone had determined to his satisfaction that the answer to a particular problem was scored at 38, he became tenacious to the point of obstinacy in resisting the slightest alteration to the package that had emerged from his own wisdom. Compromise was not a term that appeared in the Gladstonian lexicon, as shown by his refusal to budge on even small details of parliamentary reform in 1866 and 1884. Yet these arbitrary calibrations were sometimes accompanied by an inverse phenomenon. The great political issue – such as definition of the right to vote – might go into abeyance, fading into the margins of public concern for months or years, before reappearing in perhaps some slightly changed guise. Remarkably, as the stage lights came up again in the theatre of politics, Gladstone's calibration at 38 would somehow have transmuted into a score of 83, maybe trumpeted by its evangelist as if it were a full 100. \"Long and intricate intellectual processes preceded apparently sudden changes of mind\".[14] Precisely because it is virtually impossible to provide mechanical, step-by-step explanations of these mental transmutations, I have borrowed the theme of Alice Through the Looking Glass, a fable crafted by Lewis Carroll (in real life Charles Dodgson, and, like Gladstone, a Christ Church, Oxford mathematician) in 1871. In Carroll's story, Alice simply stepped through a mirror in some manner that was not explained. On finding herself in the Looking Glass room, she found that the reflected features from her real-life home, although reversed, were strangely familiar, just as Gladstone was driven by what Morley called \"intellectual self-respect\" to insist that his diametrically changed points of view \"do not really clash, but are in fact identical\".[15] Since Canadian issues encroached upon British politics intermittently and tended to arise in random fashion, it was possible for Gladstone to modify his responses, especially towards settler communities that were fast evolving from dependent to associated status. Yet his fundamental attitudes to Canada remained remarkably similar from 1837-8, through 1849 and 1861-5 and into the early eighteen-seventies. Goldilocks and Alice are occasionally flagged the narrative but are discussed in more detail in the Section D of this essay.\n\n++ The structure of the essay Section B outlines Gladstone's involvement with Canada over the half century from 1835. Since it attempts both to highlight continuing themes in his attitude to Canadian problems and to indicate the breadth of his responses to assorted British North American issues, the analysis is likely to be tidier than the narrative. I have used the term 'Canada' with some historical and geographical looseness, in effect to include all the territory that has formed part of the country since Newfoundland became the tenth province in 1949, half a century after his death. When Gladstone first engaged with the affairs of British North America, Canada (or \"the Canadas\") referred to the colonies that later became the core of the provinces of Ontario (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada). In the aftermath of the rebellions of 1837-8, they were united by the British parliament in 1840 but redivided in 1867, when New Brunswick and Nova Scotia joined them to form the new Dominion of Canada. The Dominion rapidly, and maybe too rapidly, absorbed the Hudson's Bay Company territories as far west as the Rocky Mountains in 1870, the Pacific province of British Columbia in 1871 and the tiny Gulf of St Lawrence colony of Prince Edward Island in 1873.[16] Prior to 1867, Gladstone probably thought of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island in the general context of Canada, the dominant province in eastern British North America. When he took an interest in the settlement of Vancouver Island in 1848, he was unlikely to have foreseen the transcontinental union that emerged two decades later. However, by 1858, he was cautiously supportive of the idea that Canada might undertake the development of the Hudson's Bay Company territories. For much of his career, Newfoundland also probably fell into a distinct mental category: its fishing economy gave the island an unstable population, and control over its natural resources was complicated by treaty relations with France. However, by 1892, he hoped that the island colony would join Canada, although he could see no way in which British influence might bring this about.\n\nCanadian analogies with Ireland form the focus of Section C, which covers his final years, from 1885 to 1898. Gladstone was to some extent responsible for unleashing Canadian parallels into parliamentary debates on Home Rule – they already had a toehold in newspaper controversy – but it is argued that his \"loyal and friendly\" argument was not only shallow but hardly consistent with the generally negative attitude he had displayed towards the Dominion during his second term as Prime Minister. As already noted, although hitherto seemingly overlooked by historians, he failed to comprehend the internal tensions and changing balance between the Dominion government and the provinces. Gladstone's appeal to Canada represented little more than a brazen debating point. When the Dominion constitution was identified as the basis for peace talks designed to reunite the divided Liberal factions the following year, it quickly proved incapable of supporting the hopes and assumptions of the negotiators.\n\nIn Part II, \"Gladstone Through the Lookin Glass\", Section D offers possible interpretations of Gladstone, beginning with an exploration of a neglected aspect of his identity, his association with Scotland. Biographers, most of them English, seem generally to have noted Gladstone's Scottish background in a spirit of just-fancy-that, regarding it as a box to be ticked from his early life before situating his career entirely within England and Englishness. I argue that Gladstone's attempts to reach an accommodation with his parents' homeland, to which John Gladstone and his wife returned in 1833, constitute a neglected key to possible biographical understanding. His attempt to define for himself a fluid identity spanning both sides of the Border hinged very firmly on his support for the Episcopal Church, a minority sect that was neither mainstream Scots nor a transfer of England. It may be that his active involvement with the self-governing Episcopal Church provided the route through which he came to demand autonomous Anglican provinces overseas, a campaign that eased his partial acceptance of colonial self-government. There may, too, have been a psychological element in his inner dialogue with his heritage. In the lottery of the Scottish Diaspora, Gladstone's father had struck it very rich indeed as a Liverpool merchant. Contact with less successful – definitely less gentlemanly and usually less scrupulous – transatlantic exiles may have reminded Gladstone that some small twist in family fortune might have condemned him to a struggling life as a Montreal businessman or a Toronto journalist, with all the pressures to cut ethical corners that financial insecurity necessarily engendered. Section D also elaborates the Goldilocks theme of arbitrary calibration and explores the implications of associating his mental processes with Alice's excursion Through the Looking Glass. These have already been flagged in Section A: readers who may suspect these are whimsical devices are asked to suspend judgement.\n\nSection E is a tailpiece on method, which touches upon a fundamental challenge in the writing of history: how far can we trust and how deeply can we interrogate the sayings and the statements of contemporaries? The problem is particularly intractable with somebody so durable and so voluble as Gladstone, the more so as he sometimes used words as a snare and usually failed to confront his considerable capacity for self-delusion. Section F reviews and summarises the arguments.\n\nTwo non-apologies should be offered at this point. Gladstone praised the historian Macaulay for \"rigorously abstaining from the inclusion of matter in footnotes\".[17] I do not aspire to the status of Macaulay, and can only plead that my asides are intended to supplement and support the main argument and, of course, they may be ignored. In a nephew's devoted invocation of Lord Dufferin, the Dominion's most flamboyant Governor-General, Harold Nicolson protested that he had \"no desire, in this portrait of a personality, to weary the reader with forgotten Canadian controversies\".[18] One of Gladstone's peculiarities was his ability to immerse himself with tenacious and forensic intensity in the abstruse details of such issues, in which Gladstone scholars have generally shown little interest and less comprehension. This essay argues that their rediscovery may throw some light, if not upon the mysterious personality of William Ewart Gladstone, at least upon the labyrinthine thought processes that he brought to bear upon the problems of British North America.\n\nB: GLADSTONE AND CANADA, 1835-1885\n\n++ Gladstone and Canada, 1837-1840 At various phases during Gladstone's career, Canada and Canadian issues impinged upon the British public, or at least imposed themselves upon the attention of those who took an interest in politics. By contrast, the years of his teens and early twenties were largely devoid of those oases of interaction. However, having spent his early years in Liverpool, he was more likely than most of his contemporaries and compatriots to be aware of the colony's existence. Early in his childhood, the family relocated to Seaforth House, a country estate four miles north of his birthplace. The mansion looked out across the Irish Sea, and when easterly winds blocked access to the Mersey estuary, sailing ships from all over the world tossed on the waters of Liverpool Bay waiting to dock. Local roads were poor: when the young Gladstone wanted to go into town, he simply rode along the beach, \"the most delightful method of finding access to Liverpool\".[19] For a major river, the Mersey was remarkably narrow – barely a mile wide at some points: it would have been difficult to live on Merseyside and not be aware of the port's connection with Canada. Liverpool was not only the commercial metropolis for British North America, it was also a major port for emigration. By the eighteen-thirties, over 20,000 emigrants passed through the port each year.[20] In 1835, in one of his first ministerial utterances, Gladstone identified them as the poorest members of the community. Arguably, he never abandoned an attitude to the colony – as there can be no doubt that he always thought of Canada as a colony, and hence as a dependency[21] – that stemmed from a sense of class superiority: in 1837, 1849, 1865 and 1871, he felt not a scintilla of self-doubt at regarding himself as better qualified to make judgements about the needs and interests of Canada than the people who actually lived there. Similarly, while he came to support, if intermittently, small communities struggling to control their own destinies, his sympathies did not embrace New Brunswick and Nova Scotian reluctance to the inclusion of their colonies in Confederation, a project that he endorsed on wider imperial grounds.\n\nAlthough his father, John Gladstone, was one of Liverpool's most successful magnates, he involved himself neither in shipping emigrants nor in trade with British North America. Indeed, he showed no sympathy towards Canada: in 1825, he criticised protective tariffs that encouraged settlers to clear forests and turn them into farmland. Since shipbuilders wanted cheap access to higher quality Baltic timber, they had no interest in protective tariffs designed to stimulate British North Americans into felling their forests, while imports of colonial wheat would undermine the British farmer. Fundamentally, John Gladstone doubted whether the British connection with Canada would survive, and hence saw no point in making concessions that would only damage domestic interests. His son inherited both this distrust of Canadian economic interests and his pessimism about the durability of the imperial relationship.[22]\n\nIn May 1828, while waiting to enter Oxford University, Gladstone read a newspaper account of a House of Commons debate on Canada, and was sufficiently impressed to note it in his staccato diary.[23] He was perhaps drawn to the report because the discussion was initiated by the Colonial Secretary, William Huskisson, heir to his family's political hero, George Canning, who had died the previous year.[24] At Eton, Gladstone had become an enthusiastic debater, and he may have been attracted less by the subject matter than by the cut-and-thrust of parliamentary oratory. The 1828 Canada debate showed the unreformed House of Commons at its best. There was almost no adversarial element, since all sides endorsed Huskisson's proposal to establish a select committee, an enquiry by MPs to review the principles laid down almost forty years earlier in Pitt's 1791 Constitution Act, but members set out different visions of the way in which British-Canadian relations might evolve. One historian has called it \"almost unique in the clarity with which both sides of the Canadian controversy were stated\". Huskisson attributed the problems of Lower Canada to its ancien-régime French culture. This view was rejected by Sir James Mackintosh, one of the forerunners of modern liberalism, who argued that the colony's malaise was not the fault of the elected and Francophone-majority Assembly, but was caused by the obstructionist appointed upper house, the Legislative Council, which was dominated by English-speaking merchants and officials.[25] Although Gladstone undoubtedly possessed a retentive memory, and one capable of mastering masses of detail, it would be straining credulity to claim that his subsequent attitudes to Canada were programmed by a single newspaper report. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that his first informed acquaintance with the challenges and options facing Canada occurred during what would come to be thought of the Dark Ages of colonial policy, but through a parliamentary exposition of impressive breadth and maturity.\n\nAlthough John Gladstone later branched out into the East India trade, even founding a branch of his own firm in Calcutta, he made his money in the Caribbean, eventually becoming a plantation owner in Demerara, with some additional interests in Jamaica. It was for this reason that his son was appointed, a month after his twenty-fifth birthday, as Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office. In appointing him, Peel specifically described his \"connection with the West Indies as likely to give satisfaction to persons dependent on those colonies\".[26] Even so, the appointment was fortuitous: Gladstone was the third choice for the job, the first having failed to win election to the House of Commons, while the second refused.[27] Thus, by an accidental combination of circumstances, the young Gladstone was propelled into a job that lasted just three months before the ministry resigned, but which would cast him in the role of a parliamentary authority on British North American affairs for two decades ahead.[28]\n\nAlmost immediately, Gladstone plunged into intensive reading of briefing papers on Canada, a subject with which he was evidently unfamiliar.[29] During the ministry's brief term of office, Peel seemed keen to shield his inexperienced junior colleague. Although the Prime Minister doubled as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he also took the lead in rebutting the criticisms of J.A. Roebuck, the Radical MP who acted as spokesman for the discontented Lower Canada Assembly.[30] Gladstone made only two brief statements in relation to Canadian affairs, both of them procedural in nature and one of them a single-sentence interjection.[31] He introduced just one piece of legislation, an amendment to the Passenger Acts, but did not carry it through any further parliamentary stages. Noting that in 1831, 51,000 people had emigrated to the Canadas, he appealed to the \"humanity and good feeling\" of the House of Commons towards people who \"were of the poorest condition in the community\". \"Gladstone disappointed\", was the verdict of Oliver MacDonagh, the historian of the Passenger Acts: his assertion that, even allowing for inexperience, he displayed \"ineptitude\" is surely unfair. Perhaps, too, we should remember that a large proportion of those emigrants sailed from Gladstone's home city of Liverpool, where they were exposed to ruthless exploitation and fraud.[32] The son of a shipowner was not the obvious person to reform these endemic abuses.\n\nIt was hardly a flying start to a ministerial career. However, as a result of that brief appointment, Gladstone would emerge two years later as an authority on colonial issues, a role that he intermittently reprised for about fifteen years, before successfully rebranding himself after 1852 as the ferociously parsimonious finance minister in the Aberdeen coalition. The middle years of the eighteen-thirties were an unhappy time in his personal life, and it has been suggested that this explains why he spoke relatively rarely in parliament.[33] In March 1837, Peel mobilised him to provide the Conservative party with well-informed debating firepower. The confrontation between the British government and the Lower Canadian Assembly – in effect, between the Empire and French Canada – had reached an impasse. To break the deadlock, Lord John Russell, the dominant House of Commons minister in Lord Melbourne's Whig ministry, introduced the Ten Resolutions, which empowered the Governor-General to spend public funds, notwithstanding the refusal of supply by the elected representatives.[34] The official opposition needed to steer a careful course, simultaneously supporting ministers against their own Radical allies, while criticising their perceived failures. This required speakers who were measured in their use of language and capable of handling detailed evidence culled from official papers: neither skill was abundant in Conservative ranks. Moreover, as an ex-minister, however fleeting and junior, Gladstone could claim the ear of the Commons to speak on a subject that he could imply that he had handled when in office. Peel discussed Conservative party tactics with Aberdeen and Gladstone: aged just 27, Canada was bringing him for the first time into the heart of politics. Russell's resolutions included a feeble olive branch: the promise that moderates would be appointed to the nominated colonial upper house, the Legislative Council, in the hope of avoiding clashes with the elected chamber. The three of them agreed that it was \"quite impossible\" to support this concession \"without at least a protest\". Gladstone was particularly struck by one gloomy remark from his leader: \"You have got another Ireland growing up in every colony you possess\".[35] With six years' turbulent experience as Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1812 to 1818, and his more recent memories of the Catholic Emancipation crisis of 1828-9, Peel was solemnly qualified to make the connection. However, this seems to have been Gladstone's first experience of an attempt to draw an explicit link between Canadian and Irish issues. It is striking that so few similar parallels were voiced by him in the half century that followed.\n\nHence it was on the Canada issue that, on 8 March 1837, Gladstone delivered one of his first major parliamentary orations. He felt that he had \"insuff[icien]t possession of the subject\",[36] but his speech of about three-quarters of an hour reads as impressively well-informed. In religious controversy or classical scholarship, Gladstone revelled in obscurity and wallowed in verbosity. Yet his speeches on Canada during his years in opposition from 1837 to 1840 tend to display the air of pro forma recitations of an opaque party line. Nonetheless, some themes would recur in the years to come. Colonies, he insisted, \"were to be regarded as the children of the parent country\". This did not mean that \"we ought to maintain the institutions of Canada for ever in the subordinate situation in which they now existed\", but it did mean that it was ridiculous for the Lower Canadian Assembly to claim \"a position which was analogous to that of the Legislature in this country, so long as they were in the situation of a colony\". It was perhaps striking that he \"did not think the separation of the colonies from the mother country was at all times and under all circumstances to be regarded with apprehension\" – a consistent element in his thinking that would surface again thirty years later – but he insisted that Lower Canada would be the loser by breaking the connection under current circumstances. Nor did he believe that the French Canadians \"wished to throw themselves into the arms of the United States\", since annexation would be followed by the destruction of their cultural identity. Essentially, he could not understand why Canadians thought they had grievances at all: \"Was personal security invaded? Was property inadequately protected by the laws? Was religion oppressed? Was taxation heavy?\" Even the Radical complaint that the Francophone majority lacked adequate representation in the upper house drew a patronising response: \"it must be remembered that the French population did not comprise so great a proportion of the upper class – of persons fit to be appointed to so important a situation as that of a member of the Legislative Council – as the British\". Politicians who tell people they have nothing to complain about are generally unpersuasive, and usually reveal their own failure to understand the issues.[37] Gladstone was factually well informed, but his understanding was essentially obtuse.\n\nEven as news of the 1837 rebellions reached Britain, he could describe Canada as \"a country where no practical oppression was proved to exist\". As with his attempt the previous March, he was not happy with his performance on 22 December: \"Spoke (in a way) on Canadian matters.\" Perhaps the most interesting part of his speech lay in the repetition of his dismissive comments on the colonial relationship: \"he was not terrified at the prospect of separation. He did not think that the prosperity of England was dependent on its connexion with Canada.\" Both sides gained from their relationship, but \"in point of commercial advantage, England gave more than she received\". He did not believe \"that this island should have distant portions of the globe for ever dependent upon it; but the time when a separation on the part of Canada might be beneficial had not certainly arrived\". Canadian independence would not be a good idea \"when her population was divided into two parties of different origin, and inflamed by their passions into continual collisions with each other\".[38] These sentiments might be discounted as homage to the dogmatic opinions of his father, but they would reappear in later episodes.\n\nThe debate of 22 December specifically resurfaced in his memory over forty years later, as he began to toy with a mythology that, in truth, he had always been a Liberal even when he was officially a Conservative. In dealing with \"the large and significant question of Canada\" at the time of the rebellions, he admitted in 1893 that he had \"not yet attained to a full conception of the true colonial policy\", but added that he \"must have moved in the right direction\", for Lord John Russell \"passed an eulogium on my speeches with regard to that particular question\". Writing to Sir Francis Doyle in 1880, he had been even more explicit: \"I took to Colonial subjects principally, and in 1837 was commended for treating them liberally by Lord Russell.\" The reality was less impressive. In a polite aside, Russell had referred to the member for Newark who \"spoke with so much ability\", and agreed with Gladstone that the American Revolution in 1775-6 and the Canadian rebellions of 1837 were \"dissimilar in their origin, as he trusted they would be in their result\".[39] This was a parliamentary courtesy which also represented sound tactics, since the weak Whig ministry was under fire from its Radical supporters and, so far as possible, sought to avoid confrontation with the opposition. In fact, there was nothing very liberal in Gladstone's insistence that Canadian grievances were imaginary, although his ambivalence towards the Imperial connection would have been heresy in the Conservative party in the era of Disraelian jingoism.\n\nFar from offering him a Trojan horse on which to ride into the Liberal sunset, it was the Canada issue that ushered Gladstone \"into the confidential consultations of the leaders of his party\". In January 1838, to prepare for the new session of parliament, Peel summoned four meetings of trusted colleagues – nowadays we should call it a shadow cabinet – with Gladstone invited to three of them. He was by far the youngest participant and also – a clue to his inclusion – one of the few from the House of Commons. He was clearly awed to find himself in the presence of so many grandees, particularly the Duke of Wellington, who \"sat with his hand to his ear, turning from one towards another round the circle as they took up the conversation in succession\", saying nothing himself until pressed for his opinion. Yet, for all the ritual of consultation, Peel essentially laid down the party policy. The Whigs planned to suspend the constitution of Lower Canada and send out Lord Durham with dictatorial powers. Peel \"thought that this rebellion had given a most convenient opportunity for settling the question of the Canadian constitution, which had long been a thorny one\", adding, with tough cynicism, \"that once you went into a measure of a despotic character, it was as well to err, if at all, on the side of sufficiency\". In this, he was strongly seconded by Lord Ripon, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in 1827, and later as a Whig Colonial Secretary before crossing to the Conservatives in defence of the Irish Church. Gladstone was included in the gatherings not so much to help make policy as to be briefed on the line he should take in the Commons. Peel summed up the Conservative attitude to Lord Melbourne's embattled ministry: \"don't do anything that is wrong for the sake of putting them out; don't avoid anything that is right for the sake of keeping them in\".[40]\n\nGladstone addressed the House for seventy minutes on 23 January, but – yet again – he felt that his speech represented \"a most defective execution of my idea\". Once again, he mocked the notion that the colony had anything to complain about. Its population had increased tenfold since the Conquest; by contrast, the United States had grown only six times in numbers since independence, confounding \"the advocates of the insurgents, who attempted to persuade the world that Canada had made no progress and had derived no benefits from its connexion with this country\". If, indeed, there remained \"anything deserving to be called a grievance in Canada.… he would proceed immediately to redress it\". He lashed out at the Radicals, but evidently felt less comfortable attempting to deliver a partisan attack on the Whig ministry as part of an oration that was loftily dedicated to upholding the public interest in a moment of crisis. He alleged that had ministers acted decisively at an early stage, Parliament \"might have been spared the painful task of delivering the people of Canada into the hands of arbitrary Government\" sounded trite. There was something artificial about his claim that \"it would have been easy to put a stop to the beginnings of that which subsequent eruptions rendered it much more difficult to smother; that much violence might have been spared; that effusion of blood might have been spared\". He accepted that every sensible observer realised that the situation in Canada had become both complex and unstable, \"[b]ut he did think that some share of the blame (he did not attempt to state the amount of it), but he did say, that some part of the blame of the present unfortunate situation of affairs rested on those who administered the Government of this country\". It was hardly a ringing denunciation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Thomas Spring Rice, who followed, commented that it was \"impossible to complain\" about his criticisms \"without bearing testimony, at the same time, to the ability which was displayed in other parts of that speech\", and Gladstone himself seemed relieved to note in his diary that his contribution was \"kindly rec[eive]d\".[41]\n\nPerhaps he had not yet acquired the oratorical firepower necessary to fuel scorching denunciation, or it may be that the affairs of Canada simply did not excite Gladstone's sense of outrage. He delivered a more explicitly partisan speech on 7 March, apparently reluctant to take part in a censure motion directed against an individual minister, the Colonial Secretary, Lord Glenelg: \"forced myself to the Canadian subject against a strange depression\", he noted in his diary. Once again, he was followed by Spring Rice, who professed that he always felt \"a great satisfaction in rising after the hon. Gentleman (Mr. Gladstone), for however widely he might differ in opinion from the Government, not one word escaped from his lips calculated to give pain, or to infuse into the debate any needless asperity\".[42] No doubt this was all very civilised, but sometimes parliamentary confrontation needs to be seasoned with a little asperity.\n\nAlthough it would be two years before he next spoke on Canada, Gladstone kept himself informed on its challenges by reading official papers as well as controversial books and pamphlets, although usually from anti-reformist authors.[43] He also conducted fact-finding interviews, but again with 'establishment' figures: the former Governor-General, Sir James Kempt, in February 1838, and with Lord Seaton – who, as Sir John Colborne, had commanded the troops in Canada in 1837 – with whom he \"he enjoyed 3 hours conversation … on Canadian matters\" in late May 1840, a discussion pleasantly renewed at Peel's dinner-table two weeks later. Seaton warned against the Whig government's policy of uniting Upper and Lower Canada into a single province: Gladstone was evidently sympathetic to his view that \"it will bring an unmanageable assembly, & accelerate the separation\".[44] The proposal to unite the two colonies was a divisive issue for the Conservative opposition: Peel was not prepared to oppose the ministry outright; Wellington was equally firm in refusing to take upon himself the responsibility of endorsing a measure that he believed would lead to the loss of Canada.[45]\n\nOn 29 May, Gladstone spoke in the House, recording in his diary that he was trying to assist the passage of the government's Union bill. Although it was one of his shorter speeches – he estimated he was on his feet for 35 minutes – he packed in a wide range of comment. He frankly accepted that if MPs \"were considering in private what measure would be most expedient for the settlement of the government of the Canadas, it might be susceptible of doubt whether the union of the two provinces was in the abstract the best measure that could be adopted\". That, however, was not the issue before them, since the government had secured support for its proposal from various interest groups in Canada, although he hinted that he was sceptical about the methods used to secure their support. But Gladstone doubted whether the united legislature that Parliament was now creating would result in \"any long period of harmonious action\", and he roundly blamed the Durham Report for the mischief that would ensue. Before Durham's mission to Canada, 'responsible government' had been the slogan of \"the party in the Canadas hostile to British institutions … and the British Government had always treated it as such\". Durham's argument that responsible government was \"not only compatible with British connexion, but that it was the best means of perpetuating it\" had handed \"the disaffected inhabitants of Canada\" a strategy that would enable them to pretend that they were \"seeking the best means of perpetuating British connexion\" while using it to effect \"their schemes for severing that connexion altogether\". Durham had provided a \"war-cry, in which the French Canadians, and the British Republicans in the upper province would cordially unite\". The assumption – indeed, the slur – that all Anglophone reformers were \"Republicans\" was characteristic of the blinkered sources upon which Gladstone based his research.\n\n\"Responsible government meant nothing more than an independent legislature.\" This bold statement led him into a striking comparison with Ireland. He recalled a prominent Whig statesman opposing a motion for the repeal of the Union between Britain and Ireland by saying that \"to talk of a permanent union between two countries each possessing an independent Legislature, was one of the most visionary ideas that ever entered the mind of man\". He scorned the notion that \"this self-same visionary idea\" was the best means of perpetuating the link between Britain and Canada. Gladstone would be fortunate that Unionists failed to disinter that particular sally in 1886.\n\nThus far, Gladstone's comments followed Peel's strategy of grudging acceptance of the proposed union of the provinces, but towards the end of his speech, he launched into more general reflections which indicated his fundamental lack of confidence in the durability of any political relationship with Canada. Noting that \"the problem of the relations between the North American provinces and this country was altogether one of the most difficult and delicate ever submitted to any Legislature\", he cut through the myriad frictions that were likely to arise to define the question in its most fundamental terms: \"in what manner, and how long, shall we maintain a connexion between societies which, though still politically one, yet are not socially one, but of which the original elements differ in many most important particulars?\" The colonies were egalitarian communities, opposed to primogeniture, hostile to an established Church: \"there are great differences, original and inherent, in the elements out of which society is composed, which must render exceedingly difficult the regulation and the maintenance of the union between a country essentially aristocratic in its feelings and principles, as he believed England to be, and countries in which some of the elements of society certainly seem to tend towards democracy as their final consummation and development.\" For Britain, \"the maintenance of our connexion with the colonies was to be regarded rather as a matter of duty than one of advantage\", for instance involving \"a strict obligation to provide for those who left our shores at least what semblance we could of British institutions, and a home as nearly as might be like that which emigrants had left\". However, \"nothing could be more ridiculous, nothing could be more mistaken, than to suppose, that Great Britain had anything to gain by maintaining that union in opposition to the deliberate and permanent conviction of the people of the colonies themselves\". Hence, not only should it \"be a cardinal principle of our policy to regard the union between Great Britain and Canada, and her other American colonies, as dependent on the free will of both parties\", but that it was necessarily \"of great importance, that it should become thoroughly known and understood by the loyal people of those colonies, that we look to them as our fellow-labourers in the work of maintaining the present connexion\". This formula allowed him to reconcile a longer-term acceptance of separation with an immediate need to impose a structure of government. Referring to the way the people of Upper Canada had \"so gloriously\" rallied to suppress the recent attempts at rebellion, he argued that \"Parliament ought to grudge no efforts and no sacrifices for the purpose of maintaining the present relations\". Particularly striking was his prediction that \"[i]t would also be a great problem of statesmanship at a future period, when those growing societies should have attained to such a degree of maturity as to be truly fit for self-government, to fix upon the period when the connexion with the parent state should be severed.\" Parliament \"would not consent to interpret the clamour of a minority into the expression of the permanent conviction of the well-affected part of the population\", but certainty here depended upon \"the loyal and well-affected people\" asserting themselves on behalf of the Empire. In 1846 and again in 1869, Gladstone attempted to sound out Canadian opinion on attitudes to potential separation, an initiative undertaken by no other nineteenth-century Colonial Secretary or Prime Minister. However, for the time being, Parliament had a responsibility to uphold \"with a firm hand, the supremacy of the British Legislature, and its right to assert that supremacy, as well as to determine the cases in which it should be asserted\". This was the principle that led him in 1849 to challenge the Rebellion Losses bill.[46]\n\nA few weeks after his Commons speech, in June 1840, Gladstone had a discussion which helped crystallise his views on the mismatch between North American colonial society and British pretensions to overlordship. John Inglis, the Anglican bishop of Nova Scotia, was in Britain on a long visit. Born in New York in colonial days, he was the son of an earlier bishop, Charles Inglis, who had established the diocese in 1787. Although he had received his education in the colony, John Inglis was known as \"the most polished gentleman of his time\", and was sometimes likened to the hardly edifying George IV. The younger Inglis used his seat in the colony's appointed Legislative Council to uphold the privileges of the Anglican Church and to resist reform generally.[47] Indeed, even the young high Tory Gladstone found the bishop's views on colonial government extreme. \"He advocates the maintaining with a high hand the perpetuity of British connection, the general ascendancy of the party attached to it, & most of all, of a British will in the government of the Colonies; to form & controul the Colonial will.\" Gladstone demurred. The 1832 Reform Act had introduced \"immense changes … into the principles & practice of home government\" – in other words, the resolve needed to enforce deference upon distant colonies no longer existed. Then there was \"the composition of society in the Colonies\", which dictated the unfortunate preference for all forms of democracy among colonials. Next Gladstone specified \"the want of concurrence with us among the loyal party in the most essential of all our principles: namely that of State religion\", which he regarded as removing a vital foundation, \"a basis wherein to build\". This would have been a cruel hit at Inglis, who had done his best to force Anglican supremacy down Nova Scotian throats. He concluded that \"we cannot mould colonial destinies against colonial will\" and \"we cannot save loyal Houses of Assembly from the consequences of their own erroneous desires\", by which he presumably alluded to colonial acceptance of religious pluralism. It might still be possible \"to hold up our heads above water at home against the enemies of true British principles\", but there was no prospect of offering anything more than vague goodwill to the \"friends of British connection\" overseas, if they were \"greatly exceeded in numbers or weight or activity\" by their enemies. All in all, it seemed best to make clear to foes of colonial reality like Inglis that \"the issue of the contest must mainly and ultimately depend much more upon yourselves than upon us\".[48] If it was a defeatist attitude, at least it had the merit of bleak realism. The discussion was an example of the way in which Gladstone's commitment to the Church of England shaped his opinions in secular politics. If the colonies could not conform to his quasi-theocratic model of Church-State relations, then – in the last resort – the connection with them would have to be lopped off. A dozen years later, he had retreated to a position where the need to equip Church of England offshoots overseas with the power to run their own affairs would provide him with the formula for accepting colonial autonomy.\n\nThe union of the provinces was not the only Canadian issue that made the Conservatives uneasy in 1840. In 1791, parliament had reserved one-seventh of the unoccupied land in the two provinces for \"the Maintenance and Support of a Protestant Clergy\". Even by the lax standards of the eighteenth century, this was sloppy draftsmanship. The gentlemen of Westminster certainly assumed that they were endowing the Church of England, but it took decades of campaigning to secure some recognition of the fact that Scotland's Kirk also had a plausible claim since it was an established Church and arguably a good deal more uncompromisingly Protestant. The clergy reserves caused both practical problems and sectarian dissension in Upper Canada, where most of the land was located. In 1839, the Whig ministry appointed one of its cabinet ministers, Charles Poulett Thomson (later Lord Sydenham), as Governor-General, with a mandate to secure what passed for consent to the proposed Union. Thomson also managed to persuade the Upper Canadian legislature to divide the revenues from the reserves, half the income going to the two established churches and the remainder subject to allocation within the colony.\n\nThis was an ingenious solution, but it was thrown into doubt when the Law Officers advised that it was ultra vires: a colonial legislature lacked power to settle the matter along the lines agreed. This meant that its provisions could only take effect if endorsed by legislation at Westminster. Peel \"expressed great disapproval & apprehension\" at agreeing to this. In 1834, three prominent Whigs, Graham, Stanley and Ripon, had resigned from Lord Grey's cabinet over plans to reform the embattled Protestant Church of Ireland. They had moved closer to Peel during the Canadian crisis, and all three would accept senior cabinet posts when he formed his Conservative government in 1841. Gladstone thought that Peel distrusted the Whigs' Canadian clergy reserves compromise because he \"seemed to have in his eye its ready application to Ireland\".[49] In fact, Peel had little reason to worry. Thirty bishops sat in the upper house,[50] and the Archbishop of Canterbury made it clear that the Lords Spiritual intended to help themselves to a larger share of the available colonial resources. The Colonial Secretary, Lord John Russell, consulted widely among self-professed friends of the Church – Gladstone among them[51] – to hammer out a bipartisan compromise settlement, which naturally increased the share awarded to the Church of England.\n\nFor some time past, Gladstone had been trying to organise \"old and tumbled thoughts\" on the partnership between Church and State. Late in 1838, this process had culminated in the publication of The State in its Relations with the Church, which had inflicted considerable damage upon his reputation for common sense.[52] The entrenched position that he had adopted on Church-State relations meant that the Canadian clergy reserves caused him some intellectual difficulty. On the one hand, they represented a commitment by the British State to the support of the Anglican Church but, on the other, in 1837 the Upper Canadian legislature had attempted to divide the endowment to include Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, even Roman Catholics.[53] In his book, he had carefully reviewed the provision made by the State to the support of religious practice across the whole of the Empire. He found it a sorry picture: \"the universal characteristic of these extremely varied cases is the insufficiency in the assistance afforded to religion by the State\". The obvious intellectual way out was to accept \"that although the colonies are more spotted than the United Kingdom with the recognition of religious disunion in the ecclesiastical policy of the state; yet … we have not the same degree of responsibility to them which we have towards the people at home …. The power of the state to retain them in political connection with this country is much less, nay, the right is much more indeterminate, than those which it possesses over all persons residing within the natural limits of these realms.\" Colonies and colonials, then, were not to be regarded as permanent members of the body politic. Nonetheless, he did not find it pleasant to accept colonial reality. \"If the democratic characteristics and tendencies of these colonies, taken together with the religious differences of the inhabitants, prevent their enjoying the benefit of the nationality of the church, these circumstances may be resistless\", but \"instead of hugging ourselves with a false theory, contrived to flatter our self-love, let us honestly recognise in the causes an evil, in the result a misfortune.\"[54]\n\nWhen he saw the terms of Russell's compromise surrender to the Archbishop, Gladstone decided to omit the lamentations and endorse the proposed terms, which asserted the right of the Imperial authority to intervene and assign part of the endowment of the two established Churches, while consigning the rest to the eccentricities of Canadian spiritual anarchy. It seemed to embody a principle that had \"dwelt in my mind for many years past with a growing belief that it is the right guide for our colonial policy in the matter of religion\". In slightly convoluted terms, he described this as restricting \"the action, the influence, the example of the Home Government … to those principles which are acted upon in the mother country, and with reference to any thing which is beyond them, to make it purely permissive\".[55] Yet when he spoke in the House that same evening, 15 June 1840, his remarks seemed to reflect some conflict between political pragmatism and a lingering attachment to Anglican supremacy. It was clearly a case in which he found it difficult to calibrate a position that spanned two conflicting principles. Understandably, Russell had employed the tactical argument in favour of closing the issue, rather than sending it back across the Atlantic to become (yet again) \"a subject of angry discussion\", a \"general principle\" in which Gladstone concurred. Unfortunately, that was not the only general principle that was buzzing in his brain. It would be worse, he insisted, to pass \"a bill which involved a breach of faith, which, even if it did meet with the present sense of the colony, could not, in the end, conduce to its permanent good\". If the Canadians were \"determined to have such a bill, he agreed that we were not to force British notions upon such a colony; but he protested against being called upon in Parliament, where British principles were acted upon, to abandon those principles, and if the colony would not adopt our principles, to be required to adopt theirs\". He voted for the legislation, with what must have seemed very bad grace.[56] Perhaps the most striking feature of the episode was the unquestioned assumption among British politicians that they could still impose their own settlement upon Canada. It was \"a compact – not as between this country and the colony, but as between all the parties that influenced, and swayed, and governed the deliberations of the Parliament\",[57] Gladstone admitted in 1853, when, in changed times, the British government decided to cede control over the reserves to the Canadian legislature. The 1840 settlement contained a further potential complication, an implied British financial guarantee of the imposed settlement. In 1853, when secularisation seemed the eventual fate of the reserves, the question of possible costs to the United Kingdom taxpayer would arise, challenging Gladstone in his revised political persona as an economical finance minister.\n\nGladstone's characteristic convolutions, and his sudden concern about breach of faith, almost certainly reflect the rearguard campaign of another transatlantic visitor, John Strachan, who had recently arrived in England to be consecrated as the first Bishop of Toronto. Strachan was one of Scotland's more impressive but least likeable exports. A classic lad o' pairts from a poor background, he had financed his university studies by working as a schoolteacher and tutor to wealthy families. In 1799, he decided to seek his fortune in Canada. His enemies, who were numerous, claimed he had discovered that Anglicanism embodied the true faith after his failure to secure the Call to a prominent Presbyterian church in Montreal, although it is more likely that his background in Aberdeenshire – where the Episcopal Church was strong – was more important. (His father, like Gladstone's mother, was an Episcopalian.) Ordained in 1804, he rose to the rank of Archdeacon – effectively heading the Church in Upper Canada – and his campaign to make the colony a separate diocese (with himself as its bishop) finally succeeded in 1838. Gladstone later described him as \"the good and manful Bishop of Toronto\", but \"manful\" was a polite synonym for \"unnecessarily combative\". Indeed, Strachan gave the impression of being more concerned with power and wealth than with doctrine, and stoutly resisted claims by the Kirk and other sects to a share in the clergy reserves. Despite marriage to a young widow who had \"a great share of beauty\" and an income of £300 a year, he struggled with money problems. In 1827, he had secured a charter and funding for the University of King's College, an Anglican institution to be based in Toronto. It was not entirely Strachan's fault that the institution had failed to admit a single student – it would later be relaunched as the secular University of Toronto – but some wondered why he collected a salary of £250 as President of what was effectively a non-existent institution. Poulett Thomson, who regarded him as \"a regular swindler\", forwarded details of the new Bishop's financial activities to London, and these were included among the published official papers.[58]\n\nOn 20 July 1840, as Russell's Clergy Reserves bill made its way through the committee stage of the House of Commons, Strachan's financial affairs were challenged by the Radical MP and Nonconformist spokesman, Benjamin Hawes. In addition to collecting a salary \"for doing nothing\", the new bishop had also borrowed £5,500 from the University's endowment funds in a series of apparently casual transactions. Strachan's explanation that the loans were an investment designed to generate income for the endowment was an unwise defence, given that he was overdue in meeting interest payments. Equally embarrassing was the complication that nobody could produce any authorisation to explain how so large a sum of money came to be resting in Strachan's account. The Governor-General described \"the employment of the funds of a public trust, by one of the trustees, for his own advantage\" as \"highly objectionable\", and Hawes denounced it as \"something very closely approaching peculation\". The friends of the Church in the House of Commons were thrown on to the defensive by both the content and the ferocity of the attack. One praised Strachan for his \"stubborn integrity\", although there was rather more evidence for the adjective than the noun; another admitted that he had read the allegations \"with the greatest surprise\". Gladstone felt moved to intervene, and decided that counter-attack was the best strategy he could employ. He reproved Hawes for engaging in \"taunts and sarcasms\", and condemned as \"most reprehensible and unjust\" the failure of Poulett Thomson to give Strachan a chance to defend himself. This was a questionable allegation, since the bishop's own account of the transactions formed part of the basis for the charges against him. Notably, even Gladstone let slip that he \"would not go so far as to call on the House for a sentence of acquittal\". Hawes closed a series of testy exchanges by saying that since \"no one single item of the statement he had made had been impugned\", he could ignore Gladstone's \"uncalled-for display of displeasure\". (Nine years later, the two would confront one another again over the Rebellion Losses bill, this time with Gladstone wielding the rhetoric of outrage, facing Hawes as Under-Secretary for the Colonies.) The day after the Hawes allegations, Gladstone wrote to praise Strachan for his \"zeal\" and to assure him that the changes made to the clergy reserves settlement were \"favourable to the Church\".[59] In reality, it was a victory that left the issue unresolved, and would lead, in 1853-4, to the concession of control over the remaining reserves to the province of Canada, followed by their secularisation.\n\nAlthough he was in opposition between 1837 and 1840, Gladstone was close to the heart of the old colonial system that he would later mock as \"Downing Street rule\". However, there are elements in his speeches which indicate that this subsequent pejorative portrayal was a caricature. The hostile phrase was a coded term for the Colonial Office, which was located at 14 Downing Street, in a building which one of its own inmates described as \"less like a centre of State affairs than a decent lodging house\".[60] The real issue in colonial relations was not the imposition of minute administrative control, but the larger question of asserting what Gladstone called \"the supremacy of the British Legislature\". In practice, this meant the right of Parliament to decide when it should intervene, as Westminster did on the clergy reserves in 1840, and he himself called upon it to block the Rebellion Losses bill in 1849. Far from wishing to run Canada from Downing Street, Gladstone asserted in January 1838 that if there were \"any hardships in the working of the administration, they were manifestly such as the provincial assembly itself ought to remove\". At a time when parliament was about to suspend the representative institutions of Lower Canada, this was no doubt an insensitive comment, but it reflected an assumption that colonial legislatures were something more than argumentative talking shops. He gave an even more explicit insight into the way he believed the Empire was run in a debate on a petition from J.A. Roebuck. The Radical politician who had acted as agent for the Lower Canada Assembly had lost his seat at the 1837 general election but, still claiming to speak on behalf of the colony, he asked to be allowed to deliver an address from the bar of the House. Gladstone sensibly pointed out if permission was granted, it would encourage \"the lower House in any colony to appoint an agent\", a privilege that \"could not be refused to the Legislative Council, and then every dispute … would be settled at the Colonial-office here\", forcing the Colonial Secretary to hear the arguments of both sides. \"He did not say whether this was a good system of government or a bad one, but it was essentially different from that by which our colonies were regulated now.\"[61]\n\nWhile Canada produced the major problems in British North America, between 1838 and 1841 Gladstone was also involved with the turbulent politics of the fishing colony of Newfoundland. Representative institutions had been introduced as recently as 1832, backed by a broad franchise.[62] The island's population, almost 74,000 in 1836, was drawn almost equally from the English West Country and the southern counties of Ireland. A riotous election in 1837 produced a Liberal majority in the 15-seat Assembly, composed mainly of Irish Catholics. Local politics degenerated into undignified squabbles between the elected lower house and the nominated upper chamber, the Legislative Council.[63] In 1838, the Assembly persuaded the Whig government to sack the island's Chief Justice, H.J. Boulton, who previously been dismissed from the post of Attorney-General of Upper Canada, an unenviable record. Boulton was an able lawyer, but his notable ability to make enemies masked the deeper problem that, in a community with few educated administrators, the senior judge was required to take an active part in running the colony.[64] The island's Protestant merchants now declared that the people of Newfoundland were not suited for any form of representative government, and demanded the outright abolition of the Assembly.[65]\n\nGladstone's interest in Newfoundland problems began early in 1838, probably as a by-product of his involvement in the Canadian crisis.[66] The following year, the St John's Chamber of Commerce petitioned for the Intervention of parliament in the island's affairs. In April 1839, Gladstone was involved in planning the Conservative response with Sir Robert Peel, another instance of his involvement in tactical planning. Lord Aberdeen presented the petition in the House of Lords, where it could not be challenged by the Radicals or the Irish; in the Commons, Gladstone moved for the publication of papers about the dispute between the two chambers of the colonial legislature.[67] The government played for time by offering to commission a detailed report on the island's affairs from the governor, Sir Henry Prescott. It is perhaps surprising that the Conservatives apparently accepted this ploy, since it might have been pointed out that Prescott's job was to report home all the time. Certainly, in June 1839 – as he was planning his wedding – Gladstone seems to have been preparing for some parliamentary effort on Newfoundland, studying the published papers and holding several meetings with two members of the merchant community who had retired to Britain.[68] However, Newfoundland was kept off the Westminster agenda. The Whig ministers had been pushed to the point of resignation the previous year when their attempt to suspend the Assembly of Jamaica had failed. The turbulent Newfoundland Irish might have seemed a more attractive target than the Caribbean planters, but not in the eyes of Daniel O'Connell, a champion of the island's constitutional experiment, whose support was now vital to the government's survival. The failure of the opposition to press them for action is perhaps to be explained by the dominant need to settle the structures of the province of Canada, a subject already complicated enough without opening a second British North American front.\n\nIt was not until March 1841 that Gladstone found himself once again planning Conservative party strategy towards Newfoundland, this time with Peel and Stanley. He understood that Sir Henry Prescott's report had been both frank and even-handed, which in turn meant that the government would resist its publication. However, Gladstone had reservations about using Newfoundland grievances as a weapon against the ministry: given what he called \"the delicacy of the subject\", it was \"most desirable\" to avoid arousing \"the religious question\". This was high-minded but hardly practical: sectarianism was endemic in Newfoundland affairs whether or not they were discussed at Westminster. The outcome was an opposition decision to press for a committee of enquiry. With any luck, this would allow Newfoundland witnesses to reveal the extent of the island's constitutional failure, and hence dig their own political grave. The government agreed, and Gladstone was nominated as one of its twelve members. Between April and June, he attended a number of meetings, and read widely in preparation. However, the 1841 general election intervened, and the committee never reported. Lord Stanley, who became Colonial Secretary in Peel's incoming ministry, decided to press ahead with his own preferred solution, the imposition of an 'amalgamated' legislature, fifteen members to be elected on a newly restricted franchise, sitting alongside, and (so it was hoped) moderated by, ten nominees.[69]\n\nNewfoundland was a subject in which Gladstone invested time and intellectual study between 1838 and 1841, but which produced little for historians, no parliamentary speech or minutes of questioning in committee. This would be true of at least one other excursion into British North American affairs, the problems of Prince Edward Island in which he immersed himself in 1857. His engagement with the future of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1848 and 1857 left little more trace in the records, although it gave him a solid foundation for decision-making about the prairies in 1869-70. It is perhaps hardly surprising that Gladstone's research into Newfoundland matters was entirely partisan in character and content: no doubt he read the published documents submitted by the Assembly, but his interviews – apparently in-depth discussions – were conducted exclusively with officials and merchants who deplored the concession of representative government. The imposition of an amalgamated legislature seems to have been Stanley's personal decision. Gladstone was not a member of the cabinet in 1842 and so would not have been party to whatever ministerial discussion it might have aroused. He did vote in favour of Stanley's legislation in the one contested division, but it was hardly necessary for a whipped junior minister to know precisely what he was supporting. The amalgamated legislature did not last long. Newfoundland's bicameral constitution was restored in 1848, and responsible government was conceded in 1855.[70] Following serious sectarian conflict in 1861, the community settled into a more consensual form of politics, which managed to contain an adversarial, Liberal versus Conservative, two-party system within a consociational format.[71] Gladstone's governments were sometimes obliged to consider disputes with France over fishing rights off the Newfoundland coast, but he seems to have had no further involvement with the island's internal affairs, and did not cite the colony as a model during the parliamentary debates on Home Rule in 1886. Perhaps he did not wish to draw attention to the island's occasionally turbulent political history: he could hardly have forgotten that it existed, since its disputed fisheries remained a problem in Britain's relations with France. Nonetheless, it remains a paradox that the prime minister so closely identified with the crusade to create a parliament for Ireland should have been involved in a campaign to curtail, and probably suppress, the activities of a Catholic Irish-dominated legislature across the Atlantic.[72]\n\nGladstone and Canada in the eighteen-forties When the Conservatives came into office in September 1841, Peel appointed Gladstone Vice-President of the Board of Trade, a junior but important office. In 1843, he was promoted to President, with a seat in the cabinet. This he abandoned early in 1845 for reasons that contemporaries found difficult to comprehend: Peel's proposal to increase the annual State grant to the Catholic seminary of Maynooth in Ireland clashed with Church-and-State principles which he had declared in 1838 – but no longer upheld. In December 1845, through a further series of political accidents, he returned to the Colonial Office, this time as Secretary of State, with the aim of supporting Peel's bid to repeal the Corn Laws.\n\nGladstone's three-and-a-quarter years in office at the Board of Trade, between 1841 and 1845, helped set the foundations for the shift to free trade in the second half of the decade, although neither the direction of travel nor the implications for Britain's relations with its colonies were entirely clear at the time. Although he held a commercial portfolio, Gladstone seems to have had little direct contact with British North American issues. In 1842, he was involved in preliminary discussions for what became the Canada Corn Act of 1843. A promise had been made to foster Canadian trade and agriculture by admitting the colony's grain and flour to the domestic market at a nominal duty. The obvious complication was the intertwining of the Canadian and American economies: what defence could be offered to the British farmer against the import of floods of produce from the United States sent through Canadian ports? Gladstone floated the idea that \"provisions coming into Canada from the United States should be subject to a duty imposed by the authority of the Imperial Parliament\". Even in 1842 (and, arguably, any time since 1773) this was wholly impracticable to suggest that Westminster might levy such an impost in a colony, and he quickly disavowed the suggestion. Rather, he tried to focus the attention of the House of Commons on the potential of purely Canadian resources: \"Canada sent to this country considerable quantities of grain and flour, and he was happy to say, Canada showed indications of sending over still greater quantities, so soon as her natural capabilities were developed by the fostering influence of peace and of wise local legislation\".[73] The hardly logical implication was that there was little risk of American wheat being passed off as colonial produce. Confusingly, he also claimed to be sympathetic to the dream of \"making the St. Lawrence the great outlet of the north-western States of the American Union …. but he feared the time was hardly come when they could enter upon the discussion of that subject\", which would only become feasible when the Canadian canal system was completed.[74] Gladstone also proposed to concede authority to colonial legislatures to levy import duties on British-manufactured goods, which he described as a gesture \"of rendering to our colonial fellow-subjects another of those acts of goodwill to which alone he believed they were to look for cementing the connexion between the colonies and the mother country\".[75] Although the proposal initially allowed tariffs of no more than five percent ad valorem, Gladstone's concession would open the way to the protectionist policies which complicated relations between Britain and Canada from the late eighteen-fifties – and would particularly arouse his ire against colonial fiscal heresy.\n\nIn the event, the 1843 Canada Corn bill was mainly steered through parliament by the Colonial Secretary, Lord Stanley. Given that Peel's government had revised the Corn Laws the previous year, it was tactically preferable to present the change as a priority dictated by colonial policy, and Stanley's rousing oratory certainly suggested that he believed in the measure. The Canadian legislature had imposed a duty of three shillings a quarter upon the import of American wheat, in expectation that parliament would agree to admit wheat exported from, or through, Canada at purely nominal duty of one shilling a quarter. Few historians have noticed that this made a major hole in the existing Corn Laws, which were based on a sliding scale that was intended to combine protection for British farmers while giving domestic consumers some mitigation in the cost of living.[76] Gladstone's prediction of 1840, that in a united legislature, the \"British Republicans\" would join forces with the French had come true, and the Governor-General, Sir Charles Bagot, had been forced to admit Reformers to the Executive Council. In the circumstances, it would be unwise to rebuff such a co-operative gesture: Canadians might not be loyal and friendly, but at least they recognised the advantage of shared economic interests. In his sole contribution to the Canada Corn bill debates, Gladstone stressed that the Canadian Assembly had passed the measure \"with the utmost cordiality, and indeed, unanimity, which considering the agitated state of party spirit in that country, was a most remarkable circumstance. The fact was still more significant and gratifying when they recollected that on a great many subjects the Canadian Legislature was divided into contending parties.\"[77]\n\nAlthough he had still not been admitted to the cabinet (that came a few weeks later), Gladstone was included in a ministerial meeting at Peel's house on 27 April 1843. It was agreed to confine the admission of colonial corn at a low fixed-rate tariff to Canada, since Canadians was the only colonists to have requested the boon. However, Gladstone pointed to the \"probability\" that other parts of the Empire would seek similar privileges, arguing that \"the inconvenience of having to introduce new colonial Corn Bills in future sessions for particular colonies would it is likely be greater than that of grappling with the whole question at once\". Consequently, he suggested passing framework legislation \"which would include all cases as they may arise\". Peel accepted the logic of Gladstone's argument, but feared \"that there might be an union of parties against the Canadian Corn Bill\" that could generate \"a Ministerial crisis\". In the circumstances, an open-ended provision had the potential to unsettle his already restive followers among the country gentlemen. Hence the concession had to be limited to Canada.[78] It was no surprise that it should have been the Prime Minister who was the arbiter of the government's tactics, but it was an indication of Gladstone's increasing confidence and stature that he made a much more forceful input than he had contributed to the Canada confabulations in opposition.\n\nWinding up the debate on the Canada Corn bill in an hour-long speech on 19 May 1843, Gladstone replied to a wide range of objections. He contested the claim that the legislation opened a back-door route for American grain to enter the British market. \"It was a measure of free trade in respect to the relations between Canada and England, and it was not a measure of free trade as regarded England and America.\" He offered a well-informed rebuttal of allegations that American wheat would be smuggled into Canada, either through the riverside town of Prescott – on a stretch of the St Lawrence which formed the international boundary – or at the ocean port of Montreal, with its well-established customs administration. As a bulk commodity, wheat was hard to disguise (tea, on the other hand, was freely smuggled into the province) and, in any case, the grain-growing areas of the United States lay much further to the west, in Ohio and Indiana. In a rare positive allusion to the people of Canada, he insisted that \"a population favourable to the law and friendly to the duty … was the best security for any revenue law\". To an MP who had asked \"why should they reduce the duty on colonial corn without making sure that a reciprocal reduction would be made in the colony of the duty on our manufactures?\", he replied that British good entering Canada faced only a five-percent tariff. Optimistically, he predicted that \"whatever surplus was created in the colonial treasury by this measure would be applied in the reduction of duties on British manufactures\". He did not foresee that when Canada discovered the allure, and the massive expense, of railways, it would need all the customs revenue it could raise. In his diary, Gladstone confessed the fear that that he spoke \"without any effect\". This was partly because the House of Commons was bored by the subject, but he felt that \"though the material was not particularly bad of course the workmanship was\". This seems to have been typical of his speeches on Canadian matters during his early years in politics: the colony simply did not arouse his interest. Stanley spoke of Britain's link with Canada with real enthusiasm, but Gladstone could only close his remarks with the tepid assertion that the legislation \"could not but prove a bond of additional mutual attachment between that colony and the mother country\".[79] The Canada Corn Act triggered a boom in Canada: between 1843 and 1846, wheat exported via the St Lawrence tripled in volume, and there was considerable investment in facilities for milling.[80] All of this was shattered by Britain's shift to free trade, an about-turn (and, arguably, a betrayal) which helps explain the violent anger of the Montreal merchant community in 1849: Gladstone had helped create the instability that he would seek to exploit in challenging the Rebellion Losses bill.\n\nThe Canada Corn Act was a gesture during a fraught phase in colonial relations. One of the first cabinet meetings that Gladstone attended, on 1 July 1843, was devoted entirely to Canadian issues. British politicians found it difficult to evaluate Sir Charles Bagot's decision to admit Reformers to his Executive Council the previous September. The arithmetic of the Assembly certainly seemed to justify the move: in a united province designed to subordinate them, the French Canadians, operating as a defensive bloc, were able to secure a majority by allying themselves with the Upper Canadian Reformers. Unfortunately, Bagot was in poor health at the time of the concession, and it soon became clear that he was suffering from a fatal illness. From the remote vantage point of London, it was tempting to assume that a stronger Governor-General might have outfaced, or out-manoeuvred, this hostile alliance. Bagot had been replaced by Sir Charles Metcalfe, a front-rank administrator who brought the masterful experience of India and Jamaica to his new Canadian assignment. In July 1843, when Peel summoned the special cabinet meeting, Metcalfe was engaged in watchful neutrality towards his ministers, whom he eventually evicted in November. Essentially, ministers determined that \"Sir C. Metcalfe is the best judge of the means of carrying on the Government and must be trusted very largely\". As Peel put it: \"Who can manage it if this Governor cannot? He had boldness and honesty though the turn of his mind is to concession – he has the confidence of the [British] Government and Parliament and the prestige of past success.\"\n\nNonetheless, the special cabinet meeting specifically considered two Canadian questions that required solution by the British government. The capital of the united province had been established in the Loyalist city of Kingston, on the shores of Lake Ontario. French Canadian politicians regarded Kingston as inconvenient and uncongenial, and pressed for the removal of the seat of government (as it was locally styled) to the Lower Canadian metropolis of Montreal. Gladstone's memorandum records that ministers decided to approve the switch, although other sources indicate that the final decision was not taken at that time. The Duke of Wellington preferred Montreal on defence grounds: \"we cannot expect to hold a permanent superiority on the lake\". Also on the agenda was the question of an amnesty for those who had taken part in the rebellions of 1837-8. The Lord Chancellor, Lyndhurst, saw no difficulty: \"what harm can it do?\" But the Home Secretary, Sir James Graham, objected. \"It is easy as a colonial question: yet the precedent and inference for England and Ireland is [sic] most formidable.\" Although not spelt out by Gladstone, Chartists had attempted an insurrection in the Welsh town of Newport in 1839, and there was a threat of violence behind Daniel O'Connell's mass campaign for the Repeal of the Union in Ireland. Implying that rebellion against the Crown was a forgivable sin in Canada might risk encouraging similar outbreaks nearer home. Ministers discussed various formulae that might deal with the difficulty, but ultimately, \"though with great reluctance\", decided that, once again, the Canada amnesty question would have to be determined by Metcalfe on the spot.\n\nPeel put it bluntly to his colleagues that the British government was \"losing ground\" in Canada, contemplating concessions that would permanently weaken its influence. Although there was no alternative, the implications of retreat needed to be faced: \"we must keep the colony in peace, until we part from it – but the fact is that it is rapidly becoming ungovernable – and we are fast drifting down to the final issue of separation\". By abandoning Canada, \"we must lose all British North America, including the naval station of Halifax, yet if demand after demand is to be made upon us, each weakening the authority of the mother country, we must soon consider seriously of the propriety of acquainting the Province that we can no longer undertake to provide for its defence\".[81] Six years later, Peel's refusal to support his challenge to the Rebellion Losses bill would be a major blow to Gladstone.\n\n++ Colonial Secretary 1845-6 Stanley resigned in December 1845 in protest at Peel's decision to repeal the Corn Laws. Gladstone chose now to regard his exile from the cabinet over Maynooth as a form of discharged political penance. The vacancy at the Colonial Office seemed ideally matched to his previous ministerial experience, and he accepted Peel's invitation to take the office. Once again, the appointment was short-lived, just six months before Peel's ministry fell, but long enough to reaffirm Gladstone's ill-matched association with colonial issues. It was an unhappy time. As a newly appointed cabinet minister, he was required to contest a by-election, but did not feel entitled to return to his constituency at Newark because his patron there, the Duke of Newcastle, remained a Protectionist. \"A Peelite … had little chance of an opening at a bye-election,\" he recalled in 1897; \"and I remained without a seat until the dissolution in June 1847.\" To be \"a Minister of the Crown without a seat in Parliament …. was a state of things not agreeable to the spirit of parliamentary government\" or – in plain English – a humiliation.[82] He had accepted office to help his hero Peel fight for the repeal of the Corn Laws; deprived of a seat in the Commons, he could only watch the key debates from the gallery.[83] In any case, there was no prospect of re-setting relations with the colonies until the outcome of the struggle against protection was known – and, even then, it was unlikely that a Conservative ministry would be at the helm to set the policy. The atmosphere within the Colonial Office was also cold. The Permanent Under-Secretary, James Stephen, never the sunniest of men, was burned-out and yearning to retire. An Evangelical and abolitionist who had drafted the legislation that ended slavery, he was unlikely to feel sympathy for the Puseyite son of a plantation owner. Within a month of Gladstone's appointment, he had written off his new master as \"vastly & absurdly over valued\".[84] (In 1869, ten years after Stephen's death, Gladstone took distasteful revenge in a speech that lampooned the haunting of the Colonial Office by the spirit of \"Mr Mother-Country\", the derisive nickname applied to the alleged bureaucratic evil genius of Downing Street.[85])\n\nSo far as Canada was concerned, Gladstone's brief period in office coincided with the threat of war with the United States over the Oregon territory, which effectively put most internal provincial issues on hold. Technically, his post was that of Secretary of S"
