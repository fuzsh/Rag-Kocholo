        "text": "W. H. Gladstone was the eldest of W. E. Gladstone's eight children. See his father's entry in the Oxford DNB, along with those of his brothers Henry Neville Gladstone and Herbert John Gladstone. 3pp, 12mo. On bifolium of grey paper. In fair condition, lightly aged and worn, with spike hole through one corner of each leaf. Folded once for postage. Signed 'W H Gladstone' and addressed to 'W. Farish Esq / Chester'. He apologizes for having to decline Farish's request, and is returning the card Farish has sent him. 'I must return to London at the end of next week - and I regret also that my Brother is at present on the sea on his way to Gibraltar' (it is unclear which of his other three brothers he is referring to). He continues: 'I do trust we shall eventually reap a rich harvest of advantage from the Local Option principle; but the movement will become (I think) doubly important when a good scheme of County Government shall have been passed & established.' The 'Local Option' was a move to give local town and city councils powers to prohibit the sale and purchase of alcohol. It was a devisive measure: there had been a riot over the issue in Cambridge in 1880.\n\nCondition: Very good. - Over 30 words penned on both sides of 7 inch high by 4-1/2 inch wide creamy white paper. The first page of the letter is framed by black mourning borders. William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley writes to apologize as he \"cannot leave my court\". Signed \"W.P. Wood\". Folded for mailing, the letter was once mounted into an album with paper remnants still adhering to the bottom edge of the verso. A previous owner has identified the author as \"Vice Chancellor Wood, now Lord Chancellor (Hatherley)\". Good. Together with William Wood's autograph signed \"Hatherley\" on 1-1/8 inch high by 2-1/8 inch wide creamy white paper with his monograph printed in green at the top. The autograph is mounted with glue from the verso onto 2 inch high by 5-1/2 inch wide paper clipped from an album upon which a previous owner has penned the following note identifying the autograph \"Lord Hatherley, Lord Chancellor 1870\". The British lawyer and statesman William Page Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley (1801-1881) was called to the Bar in 1824 and became a Queen's Counsel in 1845. Elected to parliament for the city of Oxford, he was subsequently appointed Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster and then Solicitor General for England and Wales. Made Lord Justice of Appeal in 1868, William Gladstone selected him to be Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain in that same year.\n\nLyttelton was Gladstone's private secretary during three of his terms as prime minister. The recipient Arthur George Liddon Rogers (1864-1944, son of the editor of the economist Thorold Rogers) is not named, but the item is from his papers, and was written while he was Secretary of the Liberal Publication Department, a position to which he was appointed in November 1891. 2pp, 12mo. Signed 'Spencer Lyttleton.' In good condition, lightly aged and folded for postage. Begins: 'Dear Sir / I am afraid I cannot ask Mr Gladstone again to sit for his photograph according to your suggestion in the letter to Mr H. Gladstone [the prime minister's son Herbert]. It is a process he particularly dislikes, & the moment is specially unfavourable as it was only yesterday that he was taken by Messrs. Valentine.' As 'most admirable portaits' of Gladstone 'exist & can very easily be procured', Lyttelton does not see the necessity of another. He concludes: 'Your photographer is quite at liberty to take what views he wishes of the Castle & grounds.'.\n\nPaperback. Condition: Near Fine condition. NOT a library discard (illustrator). Intuition Media (Waterside Productions, Inc), 2016. Signed by Marisa Moris on the front inside cover.

Condition: Good. First Edition. An Original Handwritten Letter Signed by William Ewart Gladstone to Levi Leone. Dated 1867. A letter that reads: \"My dear Sir, I have not yet had time to examine the work which you have been so good as to send mentor can I say confidently when I may be able to do it but I am very anxious to make myself acquainted in detail with the results of your labours in this interest subject. I should very gladly answer to the best of my power any question you might wish to put to me, but I fear I would not with advantage enter in conversation on the wide inquiry however (confidential) information on such subjects should be obtained. I remain my dear sir/your faithful and obedient servant. WE Gladstone\". William Ewart Gladstone 1809-1898 was a British statesman and Liberal politician. In a career lasting over 60 years, he served for 12 years as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, spread over four terms beginning in 1868 and ending in 1894. He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer four times, serving over 12 years. Levi Leone, 1821-1888. English jurist and statistician. His chief work, History of British Commerce and of the Economic Progress of the British Nation, 1763-1870, is considered to be a partisan account of British economic development. Size is 180mm x 115mm. Condition is good. Light folding creases. Light marking to back of blank rear of letter. More images can be taken upon request. Ref17153. Signed by Author(s).\n\nThis powerhouse British statesman and politician served four terms as Prime Minister (between 1868 and 1894) and four terms as Chancellor of the Exchequer, among many other important posts. ANS (third person), 2pp (single leaf), 4½\" X 7½\", Whitehall, U.K., 14 October 1861. Very good. Inoffensive glue stains to lower half (blank) of verso. Boldly penned in brown ink: \"The Chancellor of the Exchequer presents his compliments to Messrs. Macmillan and returns his best thanks for their kindness in presenting him with so interesting a work as the translation of the memoirs of M. De Tocqueville.\" In 1861 the London publisher Macmillan published the first translation into English of French diplomat, historian and \"Democracy in America\" author Alexis De Tocqueville's posthumous two-volume \"Memoirs, Letters, and Remains of Alexis De Tocqueville.\" Gladstone famously described the U.S. Constitution as \"the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man\" -- a sentiment similar to De Tocqueville's description of the Constitution as \"the most perfect federal constitution that ever existed.\" It would be interesting to know Gladstone's opinion of De Tocqueville's memoir!.\n\nAutograph note (3 1/2'\" x 4 1/2\" ) to bookseller James Westell (who because of his intimate friendship with the four-time Prime Minister was known as 'The Gladstonian Bookseller\") together with an original photograph (3 1/2\" x 4 7/8\") of Gladstone by Marion & Co., both displayed within a somewhat worn 10\" x 17\" contemporary frame (rustic wooden back strengthened with silicone; faint foxing to photograph). Gladstone writes 'Dear Sir, I wrote to you last week about Alastor, In Memoriam, and certain first editions of Carlyle. I should much like to hear by Sat, or Sunday at least as to the last named, whether they carry any and what special market value. Yours faithfully, W Gladstone' I hope you have taken the books for binding. Hawarden Sept 4 '79 I expect to be in town on the 11th' The 'Grand Old Man' assembled a 32,000-volume library during his lifetime which he donated to form the core of St. Deiniol's Library (Britain's only Prime Ministerial Library and now known as Gladstone's Library) in his residence at Hawarden, Wales. Gladstone's son acknowledged the closeness of Gladstone and Westell's 40-year friendship by personally inviting Westell to the funeral of the GOM.\n\nFirst edition, presentation copy, inscribed \"From the Author Nov. 1 1866 Hastings Russell\" on the initial blank. Hastings Russell was the nephew of John Russell (1792-1878), prime minister in 1866 and Gladstone's main ally in pushing for a bill on parliamentary reorganization. Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford (1819-1891), known as Hastings, was the Liberal MP for Bedfordshire 1847-72. His uncle was prime minister for the Liberals from 1865-66, Gladstone serving as his chancellor. Gladstone and (John) Russell worked closely to propose a new reform bill which would enfranchise certain artisans in urban areas. The bill was defeated after a rebellion by 35 Liberal MPs on 18 June, and Russell's government resigned eight days later. A year later, Disraeli's Conservatives were able to pass the Second Reform Act: the voters rewarded them by re-electing the Liberals, now led by Gladstone, with a majority in excess of 100 seats. These nine speeches capture Gladstone's campaigning from March to July 1866. Octavo. Original dark blue cloth, spine lettered and ruled in gilt, covers with triple-ruled panel and blocked central ornament in blind, brown coated endpapers. With 16 leaves of publisher's advertisements at rear. Light bumping and rubbing, minor browning and foxing to contents: a very good copy."
