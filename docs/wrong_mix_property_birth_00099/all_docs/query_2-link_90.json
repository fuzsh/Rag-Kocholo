        "text": "William Ewart Gladstone may have the answere by attaching morality to politics as a norm. He quotes:\n\nJustice delayed is justice denied.\n\nWe look forward to the time when the Power of Love will replace the Love of Power. Then will our world know the blessings of peace.\n\nSelfishness is the greatest curse of the human race.\n\nAll the world over, I will back the masses against the classes.\n\nHere is my first principle of foreign policy: good government at home.\n\nIt is the duty of government to make it difficult for people to do wrong, easy to do right.\n\nGood laws make it easier to do right and harder to do wrong.\n\nNo man ever became great or good except through many and great mistakes.\n\nBe happy with what you have and are, be generous with both, and you won’t have to hunt for happiness.\n\nIf you are cold, tea will warm you; if you are too heated, it will cool you; If you are depressed, it will cheer you; If you are excited, it will calm you."
