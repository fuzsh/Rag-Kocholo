        "text": "Portraits of former prime ministers including William Gladstone, Robert Peel and Lord Liverpool could soon be accompanied by plaques detailing their links to slavery after Parliament launched a review of its artwork yesterday prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nMore than 230 works of art in the Parliamentary art collection have been found to have links to the transatlantic slave trade, while 189 of the pieces listed in the study by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art depict 24 people who had ties to the slave trade. Forty pieces depict 14 people who were abolitionists.\n\nAmong those listed as having 'financial or family interests in the slave trade' are prime ministers Robert Peel, who served two terms between 1834-35 and 1841-1846, Lord Liverpool, who served from 1812-1827, and William Gladstone, who served as prime minister for 12 years over four terms between 1868 and 1894.\n\nThe inclusion of all three is likely to stir debate, though, as Peel, the son of a cotton trader, campaigned for the abolition of slavery, while both Lord Liverpool and Gladstone's views evolved over time.\n\nThe art linked to slavery makes up 2.4 per cent of the Parliamentary collection which features more than 9,500 works in total. It comes as a package of measures is being introduced by the committee in Westminster, supported by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, to look at issues around slavery and representation.\n\nThe portraits listed include figures who were 'directly involved in, and profited from, the forced Labour of enslaved peoples', according to a document produced by Parliament seen by The Daily Telegraph.\n\nIt states: 'Today this is recognised as abhorrent. The intention of the Parliamentary Art Collection is not to venerate people who have supported and committed acts of atrocity, but to truthfully reflect the history of Parliament, our democracy and the people who played a part in it.'\n\nPlaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams, who is chairman of the committee, said: 'We will look for ways to explain the lives of the people depicted in our artworks - including controversial aspects - honestly and more fully.\n\n'The interpretation of our artworks is reviewed constantly but this is the first time we are systematically reviewing the entire collection looking at issues around slavery and representation.'\n\nThe committee said its list relates to the transatlantic slave trade, including works depicting both people who had financial or family interests in the transatlantic slave trade and slavery, as well as artwork featuring abolitionists.\n\nA spokesman said: 'The list has been developed through crosschecking pieces in the collection with rigorous academic research which has identified people known to have been involved in the transatlantic slave trade.\n\n'The list is not comprehensive and the documents will be updated as research continues. Data and resources on the representation of ethnic diversity in the Parliamentary Art Collection has also been gathered.'\n\nThe committee also said it is trying to broaden the diversity and inclusion of its collection in line with how museums, art galleries and other large collections have responded to the demonstrations in recent months.\n\nThe British became involved in the transatlantic slave trade in 1562, and the country was the world's biggest slave-trading nation by the 1730s.\n\nThe abolition movement helped lead to the end of the trade in 1807 and then the use of enslaved labour in British colonies in 1833.\n\nHowever, many British people including politicians continued to have direct financial gain from the trading and use of enslaved labour in the West Indies, America, India and elsewhere.\n\nThe committee has said the intention of the Parliamentary art collection is 'not to venerate people who have supported and committed acts of atrocity, but to truthfully reflect the history of Parliament, our democracy and the people who played a part in it'.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement was sparked by the killing of black man George Floyd in the US after he was arrested by police and an officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis.\n\nProtesters in Bristol tore down a statue of Edward Colston on June 7, on the same day a memorial to Winston Churchill in London was defaced with the words 'was a racist' written on a plinth underneath.\n\nIt prompted a wave of statues being targeted with graffiti or being attacked during protests, culminating in some statues, including ones of Nelson Mandela and Churchill, being covered up to be protected from vandals.\n\nThe Topple the Racists campaign launched a comprehensive list of statues it wanted to see removed as it believed the names behind the monuments held racist beliefs.\n\nIt led to Oriel College at Oxford University voting to remove a statue of Cecil Rhodes, a colonialist politician in southern Africa in the 19th century.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said in June: 'We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations.\n\n'They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.'"
