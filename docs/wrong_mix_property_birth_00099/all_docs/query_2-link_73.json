        "text": "Lily Gladstone, born on August 2, 1986, is an American actress renowned for her captivating performances and diverse heritage. Raised on the Blackfeet Reservation in Browning, Montana, as well as in Seattle, Gladstone proudly represents her Piegan Blackfeet, Nez Perce, and European roots.\n\nGladstone gained widespread acclaim for her role as Mollie Kyle, an Osage woman who survived the Osage Indian murders, in Martin Scorsese's crime drama film Killers of the Flower Moon (2023). Her portrayal earned her numerous accolades, including becoming the first Native American to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nShe made her film debut in Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian (2012) and collaborated with esteemed filmmaker Kelly Reichardt on independent films such as Certain Women (2016) and First Cow (2019), showcasing her versatility and talent. Additionally, Gladstone's television credits include appearances in HBO's Room 104 (2017–2020), Showtime's Billions (2016–2023), and FX's Reservation Dogs (2021–2023), further solidifying her reputation as a distinguished actress in both film and television.\n\nLily Gladstone, born on August 2, 1986, in Kalispell, Montana, has a rich and diverse heritage, blending her Piegan Blackfeet (Siksikaitsitapi), Nez Perce (Nimíipuu), and European ancestry. Her upbringing on the Blackfeet Reservation in Browning, Montana, immersed her in Indigenous culture from a young age.\n\nBorn to a white mother and a father of Blackfeet and Nez Perce descent, Gladstone's lineage includes a connection to British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone through her paternal family line. Additionally, one of her paternal great-great-grandfathers was Red Crow, a chief of the Kainai Nation.\n\nGladstone's journey into acting began at the tender age of five when she watched Return of the Jedi and aspired to portray an Ewok, sparking her passion for the craft. Her early experiences on stage included a role as an evil step-sister in Cinderella with the Missoula Children's Theatre in her hometown of East Glacier, Montana.\n\nDuring her middle school years, Gladstone's family relocated to the Seattle area to be closer to her grandmother. There, she honed her acting skills at Stone Soup Theatre, participating in student films and theatrical productions.\n\nAfter graduating from Mountlake Terrace High School in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, in 2004, Gladstone pursued higher education at the University of Montana. In 2008, she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Acting/Directing, with a minor in Native American Studies. During her time at the university, Gladstone showcased her talent in various stage productions, including Riders to the Sea, Richard III, Miss Julie, and Coyote on a Fence.\n\nPassionate about using theater as a tool for social change, Gladstone became interested in Theatre of the Oppressed during her university years. After graduating, she returned to her native community, teaching acting classes and workshops focused on violence prevention, sponsored by the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center.\n\nIn 2010, Gladstone starred in The Frybread Queen, a collaborative production by Native Voices at the Autry, the UM School of Theatre and Dance, and The Montana Repertory Theatre, further cementing her commitment to Indigenous storytelling and representation in the arts.\n\nLily Gladstone's journey in film has been marked by standout performances and critical acclaim. Her film debut came in 2012 with Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian, followed by notable roles in Winter in the Blood (2012) and Buster's Mal Heart (2016).\n\nHowever, it was her portrayal of Jamie, a rancher, in Kelly Reichardt's Certain Women (2016) that propelled Gladstone into the spotlight. This breakout role earned her widespread recognition, including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nAdditionally, she received nominations for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female and the Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor.\n\nGladstone's talents extended beyond the screen as she took on the role of Kate Keller in the Montana Repertory Theatre's national touring production of The Miracle Worker in 2014. She also joined the Oregon Shakespeare Festival acting company in 2017 and starred in the Yale Repertory Theatre production of Mary Kathryn Nagle's Manahatta in 2020.\n\nIn 2017, Gladstone showcased her passion for film production by hosting a series on the educational YouTube channel Crash Course.\n\nContinuing her impressive filmography, Gladstone had a small role in Reichardt's First Cow (2019) before starring in the 2022 film The Unknown Country, directed by Morrisa Maltz. Her performance in The Unknown Country earned her the Gotham Independent Film Award for Outstanding Lead Performance.\n\nHowever, it was her lead role as Mollie Kyle in Martin Scorsese's feature film Killers of the Flower Moon that solidified Gladstone's status as a powerhouse in the industry. Released theatrically in October 2023, her performance garnered critical acclaim, with critics praising her passionate portrayal of the character. Notably, Gladstone made history by becoming the first Indigenous (Native American) woman to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. She also made waves as the fourth Indigenous and first Native American woman to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Gladstone's achievements serve as a testament to her talent and groundbreaking contributions to cinema.\n\nReferences"
