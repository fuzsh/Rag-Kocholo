        "text": "Between 1885 and 1891, the Liberal statesman William Ewart Gladstone debated the scientific status of the Book of Genesis with the natural historian Thomas Henry Huxley in a series of articles published in the Nineteenth Century. Viewed in isolation, this episode has been seen as a case of a professional scientist dismissing an amateur interloper. This article repositions this familiar dispute as one chapter in Gladstone's lifelong engagement with the concept of historical ‘development’, the unfolding or evolution of Providence to human reason over time, a concept which came to prominence in the 1840s, in both Tractarian theology and in natural history. Gladstone consistently advocated an accommodation between transmutation and natural theology based on a probabilist ontology derived from the eighteenth-century Anglican churchman Joseph Butler (1692–1752). That understanding of historical truth to which Gladstone credited his ability to discern when political issues became ripe for agitation demanded a humble, Christian moral temper that embraced doubt and salutary suffering, rather than certainty and whiggish celebration of progress.\n\n13 Hilton, Boyd, ‘Gladstone's theological politics’, in Bentley, Michael and Stevenson, John, eds., High and low politics in modern Britain (Oxford, 1983), pp. 28–57Google Scholar, at p. 30.

Moore, and John Hedley Brooke began challenging the consensus ‘conflict thesis’ in the 1970s.

In ‘Agnosticism and Christianity’ (NC, 1889) Huxley claimed that this tract and the Essay on development contained material ideal for ‘a primer of “infidelity”’.
