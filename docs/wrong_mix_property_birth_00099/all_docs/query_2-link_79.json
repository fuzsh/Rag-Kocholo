Each of them had formidable achievements to their credit, and they were undoubtedly among the most distinctive and complex characters ever to reach the top of the ‘greasy pole’ (as Disraeli described it) of British politics. Their long rivalry, as leaders respectively of the Conservative and Liberal parties, endlessly fascinated both their contemporaries and later generations. Both have been exceptionally fortunate in the biographers who have chosen to write about them. Each was the subject of multi-volume lives, written by distinguished authors, within a few years of their deaths, John Morley in Gladstone’s case, W.F. Monypenny and G.E. Buckle jointly in Disraeli’s. These works remain of great interest, but do not – of course – benefit from the results of modern scholarship – notably the editing of the 14 volumes of Gladstone’s diaries by M.R.D. Foot and H.C.G. Matthew, and the publication of Disraeli’s correspondence by the editors of the Disraeli Project at Queen’s University, Ontario. Much more accessible to modern readers are biographies of Gladstone by Roy Jenkins (1995), H.C.G. Matthew (two volumes, 1986 and 1995) and Richard Shannon (two volumes, 1982 and 1999) and of Disraeli by Robert Blake (1966), Sarah Bradford (1982) and Stanley Weintraub (1993). These are all works of the highest quality. There have been many more biographies, and numerous other authors have written more specialist works on various aspects of their careers. Despite this great outpouring, interest in these two long-dead Victorian statesmen seems not to have abated, and it has been suggested that there was now a need for a single volume, of moderate length, which would constitute a ix\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\ncomparative biography of the two men. The present work is an attempt to meet this demand. It is intended both for the general reader and for students of history and politics. Although it is largely focussed on the intense rivalry which dominated the two men’s lives for three decades, it is designed to cover, at least in broad outline, the entire period of their lives and careers, and it touches on virtually all the important political events and controversies of their time. These include electoral reform, the struggle between free trade and protectionism, the great split in the Tory Party in 1847 and the creation of the Liberal Party in 1859, the reform of the budgetary system, the Crimean War, the admission of Jews to Parliament, the Eastern Question and the expansion of British imperialism, the struggle for Irish Home Rule and the looming battle to curb the powers of the House of Lords. In all of these events one or both men were leading participants. It may not perhaps be too presumptuous to claim that the book could be read as a political history of the nineteenth century, or at least its final seven decades. This book is dedicated to my two very young grandchildren, Jakob and Noa, while I also wish to acknowledge the love and support of my wife, Irène, and of our children, Mark and Miriam, and their respective partners, Gabrielle and Phiroze, without whose constant encouragement this book would never have seen the light of day. I am also deeply grateful to my brother, Dr John Leonard, who – as with several of my earlier works – read the entire manuscript with great care and made many valuable suggestions for improvements, as did Dr Mark Garnett, of the University of Lancaster. My warm thanks are also due to Jo Godfrey, of I.B.Tauris, my able and sympathetic editor. Responsibility for any surviving errors or misinterpretations is mine alone. Dick Leonard London, November 2012\n\nNote on titles and the House of Commons Readers unfamiliar with the niceties of British peerages may be confused by references to titled persons who have served as prime ministers or in other government posts while sitting in the House of Commons. Two categories are concerned: the sons of senior peers who have courtesy titles, and Irish and Scottish peers who are not automatically members of the House of Lords. Prominent in the first category was Spencer Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, who as an MP held several cabinet posts, and led the Liberal Party in the Commons. He succeeded his father, as the 8th Duke of Devonshire, in 1891, and subsequently sat in the Lords, serving in Conservative governments led by Lord Salisbury and A.J. Balfour. Lord John Russell, a younger son of the Duke of Bedford, had a long Commons career, including during his first premiership between 1846 and 1852. In 1861, he was created a peer, sitting in the House of Lords, and becoming Prime Minister for a second time, as Earl Russell, in 1865–66. The most prominent Irish peer in the nineteenth century was Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, Prime Minister 1855–58 and 1859–65. His entire political career of 58 years was spent in the House of Commons.\n\nxi\n\nPrologue\n\nThe night of 16–17 December 1852\n\nI\n\nt was 10 p.m. on the evening of Thursday, 16 December 1852. A packed House of Commons waited expectantly to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer reply to the four-day debate which had followed the introduction of his budget a week earlier. The Chancellor was the Tory MP for Shrewsbury, Benjamin Disraeli, and the task facing him was formidable. For the Conservative government, led by the 14th Earl of Derby, was in a minority, and Disraeli needed to win over the votes, or at least the abstentions, of a dozen or more opposition MPs to carry his budget, which was the centrepiece of the government’s programme. The opposition was itself deeply divided, between Whigs, Radicals, assorted Irish Members and dissident Conservatives, known as Peelites. They were named after the former Tory Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, who had been repudiated by his own party for his action in repealing the protectionist Corn Laws in the face of the Irish famine in the late 1840s. Disraeli was also the Leader of the House of Commons, and the key figure in the government after the Prime Minister. His budget comprised a complex and ingenious mixture of proposals, and though the sums did not really add up he had presented them with his customary panache. During the debate his proposals had been heavily criticised by opposition spokesmen, including several former chancellors of the exchequer, but none of them had really succeeded in exposing their flaws and inconsistencies. Disraeli, in fine fighting form, now set out to demolish\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nthe arguments which they had put forward. In his winding-up speech, which lasted three hours, he attacked his critics with great ferocity, arousing immense enthusiasm among his followers on the Tory benches. It is doubtful, however, if these were good tactics, as his sharpest barbs were directed at three of the most respected members of the House – two former chancellors, Sir Charles Wood and Henry Goulburn, and a former Home Secretary, Sir James Graham. When Disraeli finally sat down at 1 a.m. on Friday 17 December, the House prepared to vote on his proposals. But the MP for Oxford University, William Ewart Gladstone, who had already spoken earlier in the debate, leapt to his feet and demanded the floor. A former Tory cabinet minister, he sat with the Peelites, but was widely regarded as something of a maverick. Gladstone was immediately ruled out of order by the Deputy Speaker, who was in the chair, but Gladstone blandly ignored him, and launched into a two-hour tirade against Disraeli. After overcoming noisy interruptions from irate Tories, he proceeded to spellbind the House. He began by rebuking Disraeli for the boorish and vulgar, not to say ‘unparliamentary’, way in which he had attacked his opponents. In his most patronising tone, he directly addressed the Chancellor in the following terms: I must tell the rt. hon. gentleman that whatever he has learned – and he has learned much – he has not yet learnt the limits of discretion, of moderation, and of forbearance, that ought to restrain the conduct and language of every Member of this House, the disregard of which is an offence in the meanest of us, but is of tenfold weight when committed by the leader of the House of Commons.1\n\nGladstone then proceeded masterfully to a forensic dissection of the budget proposals, in all their details, succeeding in convincing every member of the opposition that they were ill-considered and unworkable. Outside the House, a tremendous thunderstorm was raging, with repeated flashes of lightning illuminating the gloomy chamber through its high Gothic windows – and adding to the high drama of the occasion. When Gladstone finally resumed his seat, after 3a.m., the House proceeded to vote on the budget, which it rejected by 305 votes to 286, with only Tory MPs voting for it. Later the same day, the Earl of Derby travelled down to the Isle of Wight to present the government’s resignation to Queen Victoria, who was already installed at her country residence,\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nOsborne House, preparing to celebrate Christmas. Within a few days a new government was formed – a coalition of Whigs and Peelites, with the support of the Radicals, and with the Peelite Earl of Aberdeen as Prime Minister. Gladstone became Chancellor of the Exchequer, almost entirely on the strength of his speech in the budget debate. Thus began 28 years of bitter rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, who repeatedly succeeded each other, first as chancellors of the exchequer and later as prime ministers, throughout this time, ending only with Disraeli’s death in 1881.\n\nOne\n\nBenjamin Disraeli, early life, 1804–41\n\nT\n\nhe determining event in the life of Benjamin Disraeli occurred on 31 July 1817. On that day, aged 12, he was taken to St Andrew’s Church, Holborn, by a Gentile friend of his father’s, and baptised in the Church of England. Nobody could have foreseen it at the time, but it was only this which enabled him to pursue a political career, and – after many vicissitudes – attain the premiership. Had he remained a Jew, he would have been ineligible for membership of the House of Commons, at least until 1858, when the law was changed. Benjamin was born at 5.30 a.m. on Friday 21 December 1804 in the Bloomsbury district of Central London. The house in which he was born, overlooking Gray’s Inn Gardens, is still standing – 22 Theobald’s Road – though at the time the address was 6 King’s Road, Bedford Row. He was the second child and eldest son of Isaac D’Israeli and his wife Maria Basevi. Isaac was a second-generation immigrant, his father, Benjamin D’Israeli, having emigrated to London in 1743 from the obscure little central Italian town of Cento, near Ferrara, in the Papal States. The elder Benjamin, who set himself up as a merchant importing Italian straw hats, flourished, becoming a stockbroker and, in 1801, one of the founder members of the London Stock Exchange. He expected his son to follow him in his business, but Isaac aspired to be a poet and man of letters, and after several years of desultory activity, was delighted to receive a large legacy from his maternal grandmother, which left him as a man of independent means. He established himself in James Street, near Covent\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nGarden, and began to frequent the Reading Room at the British Museum, where he met a wide range of writers, publishers and other literary men. Most of his own literary work, which included poems, essays, novels, a biography and several historical works, was of little merit, but he struck gold with the publication in 1791 of Curiosities of Literature. This was a compendium of literary gossip and biographical anecdotes which went through 13 editions and was much admired by Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott and the publisher John Murray, all of whom became his friends. He was subsequently a well-respected figure on the British literary scene. In February 1802, aged 36, Isaac contracted what proved to be a happy marriage, and moved house to Bedford Row, where all his five children were born – Sarah (1802–59), Benjamin (1804–81), Naphtali (born and died in 1807), Ralph (1809–98) and James, known as Jem (1813–68). Their mother, Maria, came from another Italian Jewish immigrant family, and was the aunt of the well-known Victorian architect George Basevi. Benjamin grew up loving and admiring his father, but remained distinctly cool towards his mother, whom he felt had neglected him, while lavishing affection on his two younger brothers. All the children were named according to traditional Jewish customs, and the boys were circumcised, but Isaac D’Israeli became progressively less happy as a member of the Sephardic Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London. Its teachings were highly Orthodox, and D’Israeli’s sympathies were more in line with the Reform Judaism movement established in Germany at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Although he contributed to the funds of the synagogue on an annual basis, he ceased to attend its services. In 1813, the elders elected him a warden, in the expectation that he would decline to serve, and pay a fine instead. But D’Israeli reacted sharply, saying that the office was ‘repulsive to his feelings…he could never unite in your public worship because, as now conducted, it disturbs instead of exciting religious emotions’.1 When the elders imposed a fine of £40, he refused to pay, and after a prolonged argument eventually resigned his membership. While never converting himself, he had his daughter and three surviving sons baptised into the Church of England. This was on the advice of his friend, the historian Sharon Turner, who argued that it would be socially to their advantage. The young Benjamin was immensely proud of his Jewish heritage, which he had a strong impulse to glamorise. He greatly embroidered his\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\nfather’s lineage, in later written accounts, maintaining that he came from an aristocratic line of Sephardic Jews who had left Spain in 1492 and established themselves in Venice for several centuries before Isaac’s father emigrated to England in 1748. Actually, the family, originally known as Israeli, almost certainly came from the Levant, and went not to Venice but – as stated earlier – to Cento in the Papal States. Ironically Benjamin’s mother, though unknown to him, had comparable antecedents to those he attributed to his father. She was a direct descendant of Isaac Aboab, the leader of the Jewish community in Castille, who in 1492 led twenty thousand followers into exile in Portugal.2 Her family had lived in Britain since the seventeenth century. Benjamin’s parents provided him with a well-appointed and comfortable home, liberally staffed by domestic servants, both in Bloomsbury and later in the country, when Isaac, solicitous for the delicate health of his eldest son, moved in 1829 to a spacious mansion in Buckinghamshire – Bradenham House, near High Wycombe. Despite the family’s relative affluence, however, Benjamin’s education was badly neglected. He was the only nineteenth-century prime minister – apart from the Duke of Wellington – not to receive a university education. More remarkable was that he was the only one not to have been educated at a prestigious ‘public’ school. Instead he was sent to a ‘dame school’, run by a Miss Roper, in Islington, and subsequently to two littleknown private schools, run by clergymen, in Blackheath and Walthamstow. This despite the fact that his younger brothers, both clearly far less intelligent than himself, were enrolled at Winchester. Isaac, according to an account which Benjamin gave to a would-be biographer in 1860, had intended him to go to Winchester, but was dissuaded by his mother, who perhaps felt that he was too delicate to face the rigours of an English ‘public’ school. So, he finished up as an unhappy boarder at Higham Hall, Walthamstow, where the headmaster, the Rev. Eli Cogan, was a Unitarian minister. It was a small establishment, with fewer than sixty pupils, and hardly calculated to expand the minds of its young charges, who were recruited from ‘what was then termed “the middling class”, sons of prosperous but unaristocratic fathers’.3 Some idea of Disraeli’s schoolboy experiences may be gained from his two thinly disguised autobiographical novels, Vivien Grey and Contarini Fleming. From these it appears that he felt a profound sense of difference\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nbetween himself and his fellow pupils, whom he felt to be both less intelligent and less sensitive than himself. As Robert Blake commented, ‘It is certain that throughout his adult life he was conscious of dwelling apart from other men and it is probable that this awareness first came upon him when he was a schoolboy…To the end of his days he remained an alien figure.’4 In part, the difference was no doubt due to his physical appearance; he did not look a typical Anglo-Saxon, as most of his schoolfellows probably did. Benjamin may not have gone to a ‘public’ school, but he did not miss out on at least some of the experiences usually associated with them. He appears to have fallen deeply in love with one of his fellow pupils at Walthamstow, though whether the relationship was physically consummated is not clear. Disraeli certainly had feminine traits in his character, and may perhaps have been bisexual. One of Disraeli’s biographers refers to ‘the latent homosexual element in Disraeli’s friendships with younger men’. She refers specifically to Lord Henry Lennox, an amusing but essentially frivolous younger son of a duke, who was unsuccessful both as a politician and as the would-be husband of an heiress, once lamenting to Disraeli that ‘It is always the same thing; either the lady has too little money or I am too old.’ Disraeli long appeared to be besotted with Lennox, whom he habitually addressed as ‘beloved’ in his many letters, and once wrote, ‘I can only say I love you.’ Even so, Sarah Bradford concludes that ‘the relationship was almost certainly not physical’.5 At the age of 15, Disraeli left Higham Hall, convinced that it was not able to teach him anything relevant to his vast but still inchoate ambitions. The school authorities were not sad to see him go, writing to Isaac D’Israeli that Ben appeared to be ‘of foreign and seditious mind, incapable of acquiring the spirit of the school’.6 He returned to live in the parental home, now transferred to more spacious premises at 6 Bloomsbury Square, following the death of his grandfather, Benjamin, whose legacy enabled Isaac to upgrade his lifestyle. Ben spent the next two years luxuriating in his father’s well-stocked library, reading widely, but in an undisciplined fashion. His father made periodic attempts to direct his reading, and apparently gave him some instruction in Greek and Latin, but he was largely left to his own devices. He did not acquire a deep knowledge of the classics, but accumulated a good stock of Latin tags, with which, as was\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\nthe custom of the day, he later embellished his parliamentary speeches. Uncertain of the precise course which he wished his life to follow, his main ambition was to acquire fame, and he scrawled on the endpaper of the Historical Almanac for 1821 a quotation from Petrarch: ‘I desire to be known to posterity; if I cannot succeed, may I be known to my own age, or at least to my friends.’ Isaac D’Israeli gave frequent dinner parties for his literary associates, and the young Ben was encouraged to participate. He impressed the guests with his intelligence, precocity and gift for repartee, though not all of them accepted his self-evaluation as a genius. John Murray, in particular, took him very seriously, and began to send him manuscripts which he was considering for publication for his opinion, which elicited sharp, witty and pertinent comments. When he was nearly 17, Isaac suggested that he should go to Oxford, but Benjamin demurred. Already convinced that his self-evident gifts would very quickly win him both wealth and fame, the idea of spending several years in what he then apparently regarded as an academic backwater held little appeal for him. So, just short of his seventeenth birthday, on 10 November 1821, he was articled to the law firm of Messrs Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearce and Hunt, based at 6 Frederick’s Place, Old Jewry, near the London Guildhall. It cost his father 400 guineas (£420), and it was apparently informally understood between Isaac and one of the partners, Thomas Maples, that Benjamin might well, in the fullness of time, marry his daughter. This daughter, Disraeli was later to recall, ‘was by no means without charm, either personally or intellectually’. Yet he was to prove a gauche and inexperienced suitor, and ‘his visits to the Maples household, with Ben dressed in his finest black velvet suit, from Byronic ruffles to black silk stockings decorated by red clocks, came to nothing. Eventually the young lady would tell Ben, “You have too much genius for Frederick’s Place; it will never do.”’7 Without unduly exerting himself, Ben appeared to give satisfaction to his employers, and made many useful contacts through his work. Yet his desire to become a solicitor soon waned. It was generally agreed that he should aspire to higher things, and in November 1824, not quite 20, he was admitted to Lincoln’s Inn to read for the bar. He joined the chambers of his uncle, Nathaniel Basevi, in Old Square, later transferring to those of a family friend, Benjamin Austen. Even then, Disraeli – who had by now dropped\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nthe apostrophe from his name – did not give the impression of having his heart set on the law. He had already sent Murray the draft of a novel which he had written, but when he received no early response concluded that Murray was too embarrassed to tell him it was no good, and so sent him a message to burn it. Now he set out self-consciously to present himself as a bohemian, dressing in a very dandyish style, modelling himself on Byron, while attempting to build a quick fortune by gambling on the stock exchange with money he didn’t have. He drew friends, including Murray, into his speculations, particularly in South American mining shares. Indeed, at the urging of Murray, and at the expense of the promoter of these investments, J.D. Powles, he wrote three ‘largely fraudulent pamphlets, apparently unaware of the extent of the fraud perpetrated on the investing public by Powles or of the fact that he was describing in the most laudatory terms, mines and companies which existed only on paper’.8 These three pamphlets, all published by John Murray, appeared in 1825, and are the first three items of an extensive bibliography of Disraeli’s writings appended to Robert Blake’s biography.9 They are, by a wide margin, the most slender and meretricious of his works. Disraeli clearly hoped that the impact of the three pamphlets would greatly boost the value of the shares which he and Murray had jointly bought, and yield him an enormous profit. Instead, after a short initial rally, the shares fell vertiginously, and he was left heavily in debt. This did not seem to diminish the high regard in which he was held by Murray, who, in September 1825, responded enthusiastically to a proposal by his still only 20-year-old friend that he should launch a new daily newspaper, The Representative, as a rival to The Times. Murray agreed to put up 50 per cent of the capital, the remainder to be supplied equally by Disraeli and Powles. Murray sought to associate Sir Walter Scott with the venture, and hoped to recruit his sonin-law, J.G. Lockhart, as editor of the new paper. He dispatched Disraeli to Scotland to interview the two men, armed with a letter of introduction which could not have been more laudatory: I may frankly say that I never met with a young man of greater promise. He is a good scholar, a hard student, a deep thinker, of great energy, equal perseverance, and indefatigable application, and a complete man of business. His knowledge of human nature, and the practical tendency of all his ideas, have often surprised me in a young man who has hardly passed his twentieth year.10\n\n10\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\nNeither Scott nor Lockhart were, however, overly impressed by the young emissary, and were lukewarm about the projected newspaper. Lockhart in fact used the encounter to manoeuvre himself into the post of editor of Murray’s Quarterly Review, an influential high Tory journal, which he rightly assessed to be a more solid venture. Unabashed, Disraeli returned to London, flinging himself into the work of organisation with headlong energy. Premises had to be taken, offices to be planned, a printing establishment to be fitted up; reporters and sub-editors had to be interviewed and engaged, contributions to be secured from commercial authorities in the City, and home and foreign correspondents to be appointed and instructed. In all he was indefatigable.11\n\nHe was also wildly extravagant, making reckless promises to many of those whom he sought to associate with the paper. Launched two months behind schedule, in January 1826, it was a total failure from the start, and crashed the following June, leaving Murray £26,000 the poorer, Powles on his way to bankruptcy, and Disraeli with debts which he had not fully discharged a quarter of a century later. Disraeli lost no time in trying to recoup his losses, embarking – at double-quick speed – on writing a roman-à-clef, in which he mercilessly satirised his leading collaborators in the affair, including the long-suffering Murray. The novel, entitled Vivien Grey, appeared anonymously, but with the false suggestion that its author was a leading figure in high society. It was, initially, a succès de scandale, but when its true authorship emerged, it attracted universally hostile reviews. Blackwood’s Magazine for July 1826 referred to him as ‘an obscure person for whom nobody gives a straw’, while the Monthly Magazine suggested that the author should ‘content himself with sinking into total oblivion’.12 Disraeli made £750 from the book, but it ensured the lasting enmity of Murray and of many others, who felt they had been duped by him. The whole episode did him enormous damage, as Blake recounts: ‘He acquired a reputation for cynicism, double-dealing, recklessness and insincerity which it took him years to live down.’13 He also suffered a nervous breakdown, from which he partially recovered by embarking on a short ‘grand tour’, on borrowed money, to France, Switzerland and Italy. On his return, he was still feeling low, and Isaac D’Israeli thought a spell of country air would do him good, and moved the whole family to a beautiful Queen Anne house which he\n\n11\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nrented at Bradenham, near High Wycombe. Benjamin remained there for nearly a year, making only occasional furtive trips to London, fearful of running into creditors who would dun him for his debts. He continued his legal studies, but only fitfully, and soon polished off another novel – one of his slightest, The Young Duke, which was moderately well received, and earned him £500. He then departed, together with his sister Sarah’s fiancé, William Meredith, on a far more ambitious foreign journey, which took him to Spain, Malta, Albania, Turkey, Palestine and Egypt. Altogether he was away for 16 months, and it would have been longer if it had not been for the tragic death of Meredith, from smallpox, in Egypt. This prompted his early return to comfort his sister, who henceforth devoted her life almost exclusively to her brother’s interests. They maintained an almost daily correspondence when Benjamin was away from home, and he regularly reported to her on all his doings, and confided in her in a way which he did with no one else, his parents certainly included. Disraeli’s direct encounter with ‘the gorgeous east’ fired his imagination, reawakened all his fanciful dreams about the exotic origins of his family, and installed a lasting prejudice in favour of the Turks against the Greeks, which was to be reflected in his later policies as Prime Minister. He lapped up the luxury and the indolence of the Turkish court, writing to Edward Bulwer-Lytton: To repose on voluptuous ottomans and smoke superb pipes, daily to indulge in the luxury of a bath which requires half a dozen attendants for its perfection; to court the air in a carved caique, by shores which are a perpetual scene; this is, I think, a far more sensible life than all the bustle of clubs, all the boring of drawing rooms, and all the coarse vulgarity of our political controversies…I mend slowly but I mend.14\n\nHis general health and sense of well-being did improve markedly during the journey, with one unfortunate exception. On his return, he had to undergo painful treatment for a venereal infection. In May 1832, he published a further autobiographical novel, Contarini Fleming, and the following year two adventure stories, The Wondrous Tale of Alroy and The Rise of Iskander, inspired by his journeys in the Middle East. By this time, he had finally renounced the bar. Yet he began to harbour doubts as to whether writing was the surest route to the fame and fortune he craved. His works had, at best, been only moderately successful, and\n\n12\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\ntheir quality was very uneven. His style was lively, and he wrote with great facility, but his language was unduly florid, his characterisation poor, and his plots implausible. He began to form political ambitions, beginning the slow process of trying to re-ingratiate himself with respectable society. He suffered the indignity of being blackballed by several London clubs, including the Athenaeum and the Travellers’. It was his friendship with Bulwer-Lytton, a fellow (but far more successful) novelist whom he had met shortly before his oriental tour, which finally opened doors for him. Lytton, who had been elected to Parliament as an Independent Radical in 1831, hosted, with his wife Rosina, a political salon, to which the cream of aristocratic and political society was invited. He encouraged Disraeli to attend, and he leapt at the opportunity, making an immediate impression, both by the extravagance of his dress and the quality of his repartee. Lytton’s brother Henry Bulwer recalled him as wearing ‘green velvet trousers, a canary coloured waistcoat, low shoes, silver buckles, lace at his wrists, his hair in ringlets’.15 This – together with his arrogance and conceit – repelled the more staid of Lytton’s guests, but others found him amusing, and he probably gained as many admirers as critics during the course of his many visits to the Lytton household. Women in particular were charmed by him, and he became something of a gigolo, or in modern terms ‘toyboy’, to a series of somewhat older ladies, accepting their sexual favours while borrowing money from their complaisant husbands. His most notorious liaison, which lasted some three years, was with Lady Henrietta Sykes, the dark-haired bosomy wife of Sir Francis Sykes. A baronet whose family had become wealthy in the East India trade, he possessed a country house, Basildon Park; a yacht on which he spent much time, allegedly for his health; and a town house in Upper Grosvenor Street, a short walk from Disraeli’s bachelor quarters at 15 Duke Street…the sultry Henrietta had married Sir Francis in 1821, when Ben was not yet seventeen, and had borne him four children, the eldest then eleven, and all of them usually kept out of sight in the country.16\n\nApart from Lytton, Disraeli’s closest friend at this time was probably Count Alfred d’Orsay, the French artist and notorious dandy, reputed to be ‘the handsomest man in England’. D’Orsay was living in a bizarre ménage à trois with the Earl of Blessington and his beautiful wife Marguerite, who made a precarious living by writing popular novels.\n\n13\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nShe also presided over a very popular salon boycotted by all respectable women, but not by their husbands. When the Earl died, in May 1829, he left much of his rapidly depleting fortune to d’Orsay, on condition that he married one of his young daughters from a previous marriage. This d’Orsay did, but only for form’s sake (soon separating from her), and carried on his relationship with Marguerite for the remainder of their lives. Disraeli was encouraged in his own dandyism by d’Orsay’s example. By then, Disraeli had already set out on the tortuous trail which, after several setbacks, led to election to the House of Commons. In June 1832, a vacancy occurred at Wycombe, where his family home at Bradenham was situated, and he resolved to present himself as a candidate. His main problem was to decide in which political interest he should stand. He had developed a marked aversion to the Whigs, but otherwise had no settled political convictions. As a recent biographer, Christopher Hibbert, puts it, Realising that it might prove fatal to attach himself to a falling star, he shied away from the Tories, whose influence was rapidly waning; and he made up his mind to present himself as a Radical. ‘Toryism is worn out,’ he told [a friend], ‘and I cannot condescend to be a Whig…I start in the high Radical interest.’17\n\nIn fact, like Bulwer-Lytton in 1831, he presented himself as an Independent Radical. His sole opponent in a constituency with a tiny electorate was a son of the Whig Prime Minister, Earl Grey. The result was: Hon. Charles Grey (Whig) Benjamin Disraeli (Independent Radical)\n\n23 12\n\nHe tried again six months later in the general election following the passage of the ‘Great’ Reform Bill, which substantially enlarged the electorate of the constituency. This time he did rather better, the result, in the twomember constituency, being: Hon. R.J. Smith (Whig) Hon. Charles Grey (Whig) Benjamin Disraeli (Independent Radical)\n\n179 140 128\n\nEach time he was defeated by opponents whom he had confidently expected to beat, flattering himself – no doubt justifiably – with being a vastly better orator, and certainly possessing a great deal more chutzpah.\n\n14\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\nIn 1834 appeared a political novel, A Year at Hartlebury or The Election, written jointly with his sister Sarah, who was in fact the principal author, and published under the pseudonyms Cherry and Fair Star. It was not until 1979, with the publication of letters between Disraeli and his sister, that it became known that they were the authors, and the novel was republished, under their own names, by John Murray in 1983, with commentaries by two modern scholars, John Matthews and Ellen Henderson. In an attempt – remarkably successful – to protect their anonymity, Benjamin and Sarah had passed themselves off as a married couple, declaring in a Preface that ‘Our honeymoon being over, we have amused ourselves during the autumn by writing a novel. All we hope is that the public will deem our literary union as felicitous as we find our personal one.’18 It is a short – and fairly slight – volume, but one which gives interesting insights into Disraeli’s own views at the dawn of his political career. Apparently Sarah was the author of the first half of the book, and of the highly melodramatic final chapter. Written in the style of Jane Austen, though much inferior in quality, it is taken up with descriptions of the life and loves of the lower gentry in the village of Hartlebury, based very exactly on Bradenham. The main female character, Helen Molesworth, is an idealised portrait of Sarah herself, while the hero, Aubrey Bohun, a fabulously wealthy aristocrat and self-defined ‘genius’, is clearly based on Benjamin. Disraeli himself contributed most of the second half, which is devoted to a closely contested election held in the immediate aftermath of the passage of the ‘Great’ Reform Bill. He drew freely on his own experience of contesting elections in High Wycombe, and his contribution is notable for the deep disdain he felt for the Whigs, and his conviction that the ‘old Tories’, whom he admired, were ‘finished’, and could only prosper by adopting the ideas of the Radicals. Disraeli was to contest High Wycombe a third time in 1835, still as an Independent Radical, when he came no closer to winning. By now, it had occurred to Disraeli that if he was to prosper in politics he needed to find a powerful political patron, and with this in view he sought out Lord Melbourne, who was Home Secretary in Earl Grey’s Whig government. Disraeli himself recounted the occasion many years later, telling his secretary, Lord Rowton,\n\n15\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nLord Melbourne asked how he could advance me in life, and half proposed that I should be his private secretary, enquiring what my object in life might be. ‘To be Prime Minister.’ It was then that Lord Melbourne, with a gravity not common with him, set to work to prove to me how vain and impossible to realise, in those days was this ambition…You must put all these foolish notions out of your head; they won’t do at all. Stanley will be the next Prime Minister, you will see.19\n\nMelbourne was wrong: to his astonishment, he himself succeeded to the premiership when Grey resigned a few months later. As for Edward Stanley, he had resigned from the government and defected from the Whigs shortly after Disraeli’s meeting with Melbourne. He was later, as the 14th Earl of Derby, to be three times Prime Minister of minority Tory governments, with Disraeli as his right-hand man, and eventual successor. Disappointed by his interview with Melbourne, Disraeli now approached the veteran Tory politician and three times Lord Chancellor Lord Lyndhurst. He was the son of the American artist John Singleton Copley, well known for his painting (now in the National Portrait Gallery) of the Elder Pitt (Earl Chatham) addressing the House of Lords for the last time. Lyndhurst was a brilliant lawyer who enjoyed a somewhat louche reputation. They met at a dinner party given by Henrietta Sykes, and took immediately to each other. Lyndhurst opened many doors for Disraeli in Tory Party circles, and arranged for him to contribute articles to Torysupporting newspapers. In return, Disraeli readily agreed to share Henrietta’s charms with him, and later passed her on to him when his own ardour began to cool. With his customary insouciance, he then proceeded to write a further novel, Henrietta Temple: A love story, published in 1837 and based partly on his affair. With Lyndhurst’s aid, he succeeded in being chosen as the Tory candidate for a by-election in Taunton in April 1835, caused by the appointment of the sitting member, Henry Labouchere, to a cabinet post. According to the law at the time, this necessitated him seeking the approval of his electors. Disraeli descended with haste and a great deal of panache on the constituency, and a vivid account of his appearance and manner of speaking survives from the pen of a contemporary journalist. He was more dandified than ever, loaded with glittering chains on his waistcoat and rings on his fingers. ‘Altogether the most intellectual looking exquisite I had ever seen.’ But the observer was impressed by his powers of speech. ‘The dandy was transformed into the man of mind…a practical orator and finished elocutionist.’20\n\n16\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\nHe was soundly defeated by Labouchere, but the campaign was noteworthy for provoking a bitter feud with the Irish Nationalist Daniel O’Connell. He had written a letter of commendation to Disraeli when he fought Wycombe, and now reacted angrily to his switch from Radical to Tory. He read a newspaper report which alleged that ‘Dizzy’, as he was by now widely known, had branded him ‘an incendiary and traitor’. In fact, Disraeli was not giving this as his own opinion, but was citing an earlier accusation of the Whigs, who had now formed a parliamentary alliance with O’Connell. O’Connell reacted with extreme violence, describing Disraeli at a meeting in Dublin as ‘a vile creature’, ‘a living lie’, ‘a miscreant’ and a ‘reptile’. He continued, ‘His name shows that he is of Jewish origin. I do not use it as a term of reproach; there are many most respectable Jews. But there are as in every other people some of the lowest and most disreputable grade of moral turpitude; and of those I look upon Mr. Disraeli as the worst.’21 Disraeli felt he had no alternative but to challenge O’Connell to a duel, but the Irishman had once killed an opponent and had vowed never to fight another. So Disraeli challenged his son, Morgan O’Connell, instead, and added the provocation of publishing an open letter to his father returning all his insults with interest. Morgan was not at all anxious to fight, but the police intervened and Disraeli was arrested and bound over to keep the peace. He seemed very pleased with himself, writing in his diary, ‘Row with O’Connell in which I greatly distinguished myself.’22 It was about this time that Disraeli encountered Gladstone for the first time. Both were guests at a dinner given by Lord Lyndhurst. Gladstone, five years Disraeli’s junior, had already been a Tory MP for several years, and had served as a junior minister in the shortlived government of Sir Robert Peel in 1834–5. There was probably no direct conversation between the two men, but Disraeli noted in a letter to Sarah describing the dinner that ‘Young Gladstone was there.’ Gladstone made no mention of Disraeli’s presence in the voluminous diary which he kept, but many years later recalled the occasion, remarking that his only clear memory was of ‘his amazement at the foppery of Disraeli’s dress’.23 Disraeli’s conversion to Conservatism was cemented in March 1836 by his election to the Carlton Club, the ‘holy of holies’ of high Toryism. After his earlier experiences of being blackballed at the Athenaeum and Travellers’, he was apprehensive\n\n17\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nof a further setback, and carefully prepared the ground, being proposed and seconded by two senior Tory peers, and enrolling the services of Lady Blessington to lobby on his behalf. Disraeli went on to write his first political book, entitled A Vindication of the English Constitution in a Letter to a Noble and Learned Lord [Lord Lyndhurst] by ‘Disraeli the Younger’, an action which delighted his father Isaac. He also wrote a series of articles, notable for the venom with which they attacked leading Whigs, under the pseudonym ‘Runneymede’, which appeared in The Morning Post. He continued these in The Times, and – while he unconvincingly denied authorship – his fame spread and also his approval rating among the Tories. He lived extravagantly, contemplating moving into Byron’s former chambers in the Albany, but he was always only one step ahead of his creditors, his debts now exceeding £20,000 (perhaps £650,000 in today’s money). He was in daily dread of being thrown into a debtors’ prison, and once had to hide down a well when a sheriff ’s officer came to arrest him, and on another occasion bribed the officer to go away. He importuned many of his friends and acquaintances for help, with varying degrees of success, and more than once called on his father to bail him out, while concealing the full extent of his debts. Disraeli was now absolutely desperate to secure election to the House of Commons, and thus ensure the parliamentary immunity which would keep him out of prison. The death, on 20 June 1837, of William IV opened an opportunity to him, as it precipitated an immediate general election. He now received a number of invitations to stand as a candidate for the Conservatives. From at least nine possibilities, he chose Maidstone in Kent, which turned out to be an inspired choice. The other Tory candidate was one of the retiring members, Wyndham Lewis, a wealthy landowner who was entranced by Disraeli, and took him under his wing, paying the bulk of his election expenses. Mrs Wyndham Lewis was even more impressed, describing him in a letter to her brother as ‘one of the greatest writers and finest orators of the day – aged about 30’.24 When an unexpected Radical candidate, a former MP, entered the lists and a despairing Disraeli, already shaken by repeated antisemitic jibes, resigned himself to defeat, Mrs Wyndham Lewis was reputed to have summoned the Conservative agent, given him a large\n\n18\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\nsum of money, saying, ‘Spend that, and more if you want it – all that is necessary; but Mr. Disraeli must be returned.’25 ‘Maidstone electors expected to be bribed handsomely,’ Weintraub commented. In the event, the Wyndham Lewis largesse proved sufficient to secure the election of both Tory candidates. The result, announced in mid-July 1837, was: Wyndham Lewis (Conservative) Benjamin Disraeli (Conservative) Col. T.P. Thompson (Radical)\n\n782 668 559\n\nDisraeli’s first emotion at being elected was profound relief that the immediate threat of prison had been lifted, though his creditors continued to press him hard. His friend d’Orsay sent him a message, hinting at a more permanent way out of his difficulties: ‘You will not make love! You will not intrigue! You have your seat; do not risk anything! If you meet with a widow, then marry!’26 The newly elected Parliament did not meet until 15 November 1837, and Disraeli did not wait long to make his maiden speech. On 7 December he rose from his seat, determined to take the House by storm. It did not work out like that, being described by the diarist Charles Greville in the following terms: ‘Mr. Disraeli made his first exhibition the other night, beginning with florid assurance, speedily degenerating into ludicrous absurdity, and being at last put down in inextinguishable shots of laughter.’27 Disraeli’s first mistake was in the choice of subject matter. MPs normally choose non-controversial subjects for their first appearance, but Disraeli was determined to pursue his vendetta against O’Connell, who was the immediately preceding speaker. He launched into an elaborate assault on the electoral malpractices of the O’Connellites in the general election, accusing them of ‘majestic mendicancy’, and it was hardly surprising that he was soon the object of ‘hisses, hoots, laughter and catcalls’ from a claque of O’Connell’s supporters. So extravagant was Disraeli’s rhetoric and so bizarre his attire that the bulk of the House soon joined in the merriment and Disraeli could no longer make himself heard. He abruptly broke off his speech, with the defiant words, ‘Though I sit down now, the time will come when you will hear me.’28 This has gone down as one of the most famous – if least successful – maiden speeches in history. It was not quite a total disaster, as\n\n19\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nDisraeli related in a letter to his sister. He received some sage advice from R.L. Sheil, a veteran Irish MP who was not one of O’Connell’s men. ‘Now, get rid of your genius for a session,’ he said. ‘Speak often, for you must not show yourself cowed, but speak shortly. Be very quiet, try to be dull … and in a short time the House will sigh for the wit and eloquence they know are in you; they will encourage you to pour them forth, and then you will have the ear of the House and be a favourite.’29 Disraeli told Sarah, ‘I think that altogether this is as interesting a rencontre as I have ever experienced.’ He was sensible and humble enough to agree to follow Sheil’s counsel. Within a month or two of this fiasco, however, an event occurred which had a profound effect on his future prospects – the unexpected death in March 1838 of his fellow member for Maidstone, Wyndham Lewis, from a heart attack. Lewis’s heir was his brother, but he left his widow, Mary Anne, a life interest in his London home, in Grosvenor Gate, overlooking Hyde Park, and an income of between five and six thousand pounds a year. A good-natured but ill-educated woman, and a notorious chatterbox, she was – at 45 – Disraeli’s senior by 12 years, and her undoubted charms were already fading. Yet – following the earlier advice of d’Orsay – within four months he proposed to her. He was on record as having said that ‘I may commit many follies in my life, but I shall never marry for love,’30 and it was almost universally believed that his motive was pecuniary. He made no very strenuous effort to deny this, but it was also evident that he was genuinely fond of her, and may also have been looking for a mothersubstitute (with a single exception all the women in whom he was known to have taken a romantic interest during his life were older than him). Mary Anne insisted on waiting for a year after her husband’s death before giving him an answer, but they were duly married at St George’s, Hanover Square on 28 August 1839, with Lord Lyndhurst as best man, and Disraeli moved into her fashionable Grosvenor Gate home. Shortly before the marriage, Mary Anne had written down in parallel columns the qualities she detected in her bridegroom and herself. This revealed more discernment and self-knowledge than she has usually been credited with:\n\n20\n\nB E N JA M I N D I S R A E L I , E A R LY L I F E , 1 8 0 4 – 4 1\n\nHim\n\nHer\n\n‘His eyes they are as black as sloes, But oh! so beautiful his nose’ Very calm Very effervescent Manners grave and almost sad Gay and happy when speaking Never irritable Very irritable Bad-humoured Good-humoured Warm in love but cold in friendship Cold in love but warm in friendship Very patient No patience Very studious Very idle Very generous Only generous to those she loves Often says what he does not think Never says anything she does not think It is impossible to find out who he likes Her manner is quite different, and or dislikes from his manner. He to those she likes she shows does not show his feelings her feelings. No vanity Much vanity Conceited No conceit No self-love Much self-love He is seldom amused Everything amuses her He is a genius She is a dunce He is to be depended on to some degree She is not to be depended on His whole soul is devoted to politics She has no ambition and hates politics So it is evident they sympathise only on one subject: Maidstone, like most husbands and wives about their Children.31\n\nAgainst expectations, it turned out to be a successful marriage; they became a devoted couple, and Disraeli was devastated when she died nine years before him. This, however, had not prevented him from embarking on a number of extramarital affairs, and he appears to have fathered two illegitimate children during the 1860s (see Chapter 6, below). As for her money, it turned out not to be enough to settle all of Disraeli’s debts, though Robert Blake estimates that, altogether, she shelled out some £13,000 to his creditors.32 This at least considerably eased the pressure on him, while as an MP he was now safe from arrest for debt. Disraeli proved to be a very active MP, speaking frequently in the House, and showing at least spasmodic evidence that his earlier Radical sympathies were far from dormant. He criticised the implementation of the 1834 Poor Law, which introduced the horrors of the workhouse, and\n\n21\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nwas one of only five MPs to vote against harsh punishment for Chartist leaders following the massive demonstrations and disturbances of 1839. Robert Blake wrote in his biography that ‘politically at this time he could be described as a Tory Radical standing well to the left of centre.’33 Shortly after his election, however, he had failed to support a motion to extend the right to sit in the House of Commons to members of all religious denominations. This would have included Jews, and ‘Disraeli quickly realised that not a Tory vote was likely to be cast in favour – unless it was his.’ He voted against, and the motion was defeated by 12 votes. ‘In his first month in Parliament,’ Weintraub comments, ‘his timidity had totally overwhelmed his loyalties.’34 Later on he showed more courage, voting in favour of similar motions in 1841 and 1845, speaking in favour during a further debate in 1847, and strongly supporting all further attempts until the ban was finally lifted in 1858. He also made a point of forging close relations with a number of prominent Jews, including several members of the Rothschild family, and made no attempt to disguise his Jewish origin, in spite of suffering from persistent antisemitic slurs. The only alteration he made to his name was to drop the apostrophe, which hardly disguised his antecedents. By contrast, another baptised Jew, Francis Cohen, the son of Isaac D’Israeli’s stockbroker and an eminent lawyer, ended his days as Sir Francis Palgrave.35\n\n22\n\nTwo\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, early life, 1809–41\n\nO\n\nne of the many paradoxes in the long life of William Ewart Gladstone was that the economic basis of the political career of the great Liberal leader was a fortune largely rooted in the slave trade. That fortune was made by his father, John Gladstone (1764–1851). Born John Gladstones, he came from Leith, in Scotland, and dropped the final ‘s’ from his name after he moved to Liverpool in 1787. He came from a long line of Scottish Presbyterians, mostly small tradesmen, who had settled in the little market town of Biggar, in the Southern Uplands. The family was deeply pious, and in each generation included elders of the Church, and sometimes ministers, among its members. The first member of the family to achieve any level of prosperity was John’s father, Thomas Gladstones. Apprenticed in his youth to a wine merchant in Leith, he rose to become ‘a middle-ranking corn dealer in Edinburgh and Leith’.1 Thomas’s elder brother, the Rev. James Gladstones, joined him in Leith, where he became the rector of Leith Academy. Thomas Gladstones was to have 16 children, of whom four died in infancy. Much the most intelligent and enterprising was the eldest son, John, who after working alongside his father for several years left at the age of 22 to seek his fortune in Liverpool. Here he entered into partnership with a much older Scot, Edgar Corrie, who had become ‘both a substantial brewer and a senior partner in a firm of corn factors’.2 Corrie was entranced by his young countryman’s unbounded energy and quickness to learn, and under his avuncular tuition John Gladstone rapidly became\n\n23\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\none of the most successful traders on Merseyside, soon branching out into other fields of activity, including property, shipping and West Indian sugar, cotton and slavery, acquiring in the process extensive plantations both in Jamaica and Demerara (Guiana), and the ownership of more than 1500 slaves. His wealth expanded almost exponentially, rising, according to his own very careful calculations, from £15,900 in 1795 to £40,000 in 1799, £333,600 in 1820, £502,550 in 1828 and £636,200 in 1833.3 In his early years in Liverpool, John Gladstone mixed socially almost exclusively with fellow Scotsmen, one of whom, William Ewart, became his closest friend. In the absence of a Scots’ Kirk, they worshipped together at the Unitarian Chapel in Renshaw Street, but in 1792, ‘young and still zealous in the faith of their fathers’,4 they clubbed together to establish a Kirk in Oldham Street. In the same year, John Gladstone, now aged 27, got married to Jane Hall, daughter of a Liverpool merchant. It was not an auspicious match. Aged 26, a year younger than her husband, Jane’s health was very fragile, and ‘within less than a year she was taking medicinal baths and visiting the spas.’5 There were no children, and by 1798 Jane was dead. John, now a prosperous businessman, rapidly rising in local society, lost little time in seeking a replacement. In 1800, aged 36, he married his second wife, Anne Mackenzie Robertson, daughter of a Scottish lawyer who was Provost of the Highland town of Dingwall. She came from much higher in the social scale than the modest Gladstones family. For generations her family had been of the Highland gentry, and she could trace her ancestry back to King Robert the Bruce. Many years later, when Gladstone was Prime Minister, genealogists demonstrated that he was, through his mother, a remote blood relative of Queen Victoria. The author of a family history of the Gladstones described her in the following terms: Anne was twenty-eight, a beautiful dark-eyed woman. It seems surprising that she had been unwed for so long. Perhaps her shyness had kept her secluded for she had never been brilliant in company. Perhaps it was her intense religious dedication for she was strongly Evangelical, much concerned for the state of her soul and the souls of those whom she loved. Perhaps it was her health for like Jane Hall she was not strong. John Gladstone fell in love with the frail and beautiful Anne Robertson and she with him.6\n\n24\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\nThey set up home in the house at 62 Rodney Street, Liverpool, where John had lived with his first wife. It was a substantial property, with room for a fair number of live-in servants. It was three years before they began a family, but on 24 December 1802, their elder daughter Anne Mackenzie (1802–29) was born. Three sons followed over the next five years, Thomas (1804–89), Robertson (1805–75) and John Nielson (1807–63). Two years later, on 29 December 1809, the fourth and most famous son was born, and was named after his father’s close friend William Ewart. The family was completed four-and-a-half years later, with the birth of a second daughter, Helen Jane (1814–80). By the time that William was born, his parents were no longer members of the Church of Scotland. Some time before 1804, when John Gladstone bought two seats at the newly built Anglican Church of St Mark’s for £203, they had transferred their membership to the Church of England. The reason for the switch is unknown. It may have had something to do with their dissatisfaction at the level of preaching in the Kirk which John Gladstone had helped to establish, but more likely it was an indication of their upward social mobility. The higher ranks of the business community were solidly Anglican, and as John’s affluence and standing increased, he naturally gravitated towards them. A similar movement was reflected in his political affiliation. In 1806, the prominent Radical William Roscoe stood for Liverpool in the general election, and John Gladstone was one of his strongest supporters. But Roscoe, though successful, soon disappointed his constituents, and bowed out the following year, when a further general election was held. By 1812, when he was well on the way to becoming one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in Liverpool, John Gladstone took the lead in inviting the leading Pittite Tory, and recent Foreign Secretary, George Canning to contest the city, personally guaranteeing his election expenses, estimated at £10,000. It proved a titanic struggle, with the Whigs responding by putting up the famous lawyer and orator Henry Brougham. John Gladstone effectively acted as Canning’s election agent, and proved to be brilliant at the job (which largely consisted of the discreet handing out of bribes). Canning and his Tory running-mate were duly elected. Gladstone now developed political ambitions of his own, and dreamt of representing his adopted city in future parliaments. But nothing came of\n\n25\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nthis, and he was reduced to buying his way into the House of Commons by way of a series of ‘pocket’ or ‘rotten’ boroughs, representing consecutively Lancaster, Woodstock and Berwick-upon-Tweed from 1818 to 1827, when he was unseated from the last of these for ‘bribery, treating and other illegal transactions’. He was not a success in the Commons, and although he made two further unsuccessful attempts to be elected for other constituencies, he subsequently contented himself with being a major force in Liverpool, and buying himself a large estate at Fasque, in Kincardineshire, where he played at being a feudal landlord. Despite his slave-owning and his resort to ‘dubious electoral practices’, he was generally perceived as a ‘God-fearing man’. He was, according to H.C.G. Matthew, a classic Samuel Smiles character, ‘mixing duty, probity and religion with materialism, initiative and a strong drive for worldly success’.7 Smiles, the great Victorian apostle of ‘self-help’, indeed projected writing his biography, but was dissuaded by objections from within the Gladstone family. The home atmosphere in which the young William grew up is described by Matthew as moderately Evangelical, with the Evangelicals’ strong emphasis on the reading of the Bible and on personal duty, family obligation, sin and atonement. Religion brought joy to the Gladstone women, but it weighed heavily on the men, and especially upon William…William’s mother believed that he had been ‘truly converted to God’ when he was about ten.8\n\nWilliam was heavily influenced by his mother and his elder sister Anne, both of whom were very – but cheerfully – devout, and were regarded by him as saints. Anne was to die, still unmarried, at the age of 26. She and her mother possessed the Evangelical religious assurance, repose and sense of grace which Gladstone never throughout his life gained. For him, awareness of sin…was always uppermost, never its atoning opposite. His mother and sister represented to him, therefore, a quality of holiness which both inspired him and intensified his sense of inadequacy.9\n\nWriting much later in life, in an undated note quoted in John Morley’s monumental biography, first published in 1903, Gladstone reflected on his early childhood in terms which one can scarcely imagine any other prime minister employing:\n\n26\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\nI wish that in reviewing my childhood I could regard it as presenting those features of innocence and beauty which I have often seen elsewhere, and indeed, thanks be to God, within the limits of my own home. The best I can say is that I do not think it was a vicious childhood … But truth obliges me to record this against myself. I have no recollection of being a loving or a winning child; an earnest or diligent or knowledge-loving child. God forgive me.10\n\nHe continued in this vein for several paragraphs, repeatedly emphasising how far he had fallen short of the standards which he believed the Almighty had expected of him. The young William’s schooling began at a little school attached to the Anglican church which his father had endowed at Seaforth at the mouth of the Mersey estuary, some five miles from their Liverpool home. Here under the tutelage of the Rev. William Rawson, a Cambridge graduate who doubled up as the local priest, he studied with fewer than a dozen other boys, including initially his elder brothers. He later recalled, I have no recollection of being under any moral or personal influence whatever, and I doubt whether the preaching had any adaptation whatever to children. As to intellectual training, I believe that like the other boys, I shirked my work as much as I could. I went to Eton in 1821 after a pretty long spell, in a very middling state of preparation, and wholly without any knowledge or other enthusiasm, unless it were a priggish love of argument which I had begun to develop.11\n\nJohn Gladstone, having amassed a considerable fortune, determined that his children should enjoy the privileges and opportunities open to the aristocracy, and wished all four of his sons to be educated at Eton. Three of them were, but the third son, John, insisted on going instead to the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth. Neither of William’s other brothers distinguished themselves at Eton, but, in Roy Jenkins’s words, ‘William took to Eton like a duck to water.’12 A tall, goodlooking and ferociously hard-working young man who felt no sense of inferiority to his aristocratic schoolmates, he was a notable success, both academically and socially. He was soon to be co-opted to the school elite, becoming a member of the Eton Society (later known as ‘Pop’), where, from the outset, he acquired a formidable reputation as a debater. Yet, comments Jenkins,\n\n27\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nFor an outstanding orator, which he was already on the way to becoming, he was singularly lacking in neatness of phrase… His force depended essentially on his flashing eyes and the physical authority of his presence. Thus the printed records of his speeches do not compare with those of Chatham [the Elder Pitt], or Burke or Canning or Abraham Lincoln, or even with the contrived epigrams of Disraeli, whose flippancy was so antipathetic to Gladstone.13\n\nAt Eton, he made a number of close friends, one of whom – Lord Lincoln, heir to the dukedom of Newcastle – was later to be instrumental in launching his political career. He also had a highly charged ‘on–off ’ relationship with Arthur Hallam, the brilliant and dangerously attractive son of a leading constitutional historian, who was two years younger than Gladstone but was generally held to outshine him. Hallam was a promising poet who enjoyed a close friendship with Tennyson when they were both studying at Cambridge. He was to die tragically at the age of 22, and was the subject of Tennyson’s famous poem In Memoriam. Jenkins commented that ‘there is no evidence of any homosexual behaviour’, but cites Tennyson’s biographer, Robert Martin, who pointed out that ‘sixty years after Hallam’s death the Prime Minister and the Poet Laureate were still jealous of each other’s place in his affections’.14 In his fourth year at Eton – on 16 July 1825 – he wrote the first entry in the diary which he was to continue until he was 85. His purpose, he later wrote, was ‘to tell, amidst the recounting of numberless mercies…a melancholy tale of my inward life’.15 In fact, it is largely a catalogue of the books which Gladstone read – over 20,000 in all – the events he attended and the people he encountered – some 22,000 in his long life, interspersed with agonising introspections as to whether he was truly acting out God’s purpose in his life. The entire diary, brilliantly edited by M.R.D. Foot and, in particular, H.C.G. (Colin) Matthew, was published in 14 volumes between 1968 and 1994, under the title The Gladstone Diaries: With Cabinet minutes and prime-ministerial correspondence. Thanks to this Herculean effort, more is known of the private and public life of Gladstone than of any other nineteenth-century politician. Gladstone left Eton at Christmas 1827, writing to his sister, Anne, ‘I have long ago made up my mind that I have of late been enjoying what will in all probability be, as far as my own individual case is concerned, the happiest years of my life. And they have fled!’16\n\n28\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\nYet Gladstone did not find the teaching at Eton very inspiring, and later wrote that the one thing the school taught him was the importance of strict accuracy in everything he attempted. Otherwise, according to Matthew, it made him proficient in Greek and Latin, competent in French, barely adequate in mathematics, and largely ignorant of the sciences. ‘Yet,’ he adds, ‘his self-education in English literature, History and Theology was already considerable, and the school had achieved his father’s objective of grafting him onto the metropolitan political elite.’17 In October 1828, aged nearly 19, Gladstone went up to Christ Church, Oxford, then – and for much of the nineteenth century – the most intellectually distinguished of Oxford colleges. Here, according to his first and most comprehensive biographer, John Morley, for the first year and a half he took things pretty easily, and constantly reproached himself for his ‘natural indolence’. Then he changed, writing in his diary, ‘The time for half-measures and trifling and pottering, in which I have so long indulged myself, is now gone by, and I must do or die.’18 He buckled down, and following in the footsteps of Sir Robert Peel, another middle-class boy whose self-made father had sent him to ‘public’ school and Oxford with the aim of integrating him into the aristocracy, finished up in 1831 with double firsts in Literae Humaniores and Mathematics. When Peel, who was to become Gladstone’s mentor and political hero, achieved this feat 22 years earlier it was an unprecedented event. It had since been emulated several times, and in 1831 Gladstone shared the honour with George Anthony Denison, later to be a prominent churchman, who became a fierce opponent of Gladstone more than 30 years later when he attempted to reform Oxford University. Yet studying was perhaps merely incidental to Gladstone’s life at Oxford. It was a major formative influence both in his religious and political development. In religion, he drifted away somewhat from his Evangelical roots and associated more with High Church figures such as Edward Pusey, John Keble, F.D. Maurice and John Henry Newman, several of whom – to Gladstone’s dismay – later joined the Roman Church, as did a future cardinal with whom he became acquainted, Henry Manning, who was at that time rather Low Church. At no time in his life was Gladstone tempted to follow suit. He was to his core an incorrigible Protestant, utterly convinced that each man or woman was personally responsible for his or\n\n29\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nher own salvation, and he wrestled uneasily with his own conscience on page after page of his diaries. He was especially perturbed by his inability to resist the temptations of masturbation, condemning himself as ‘beast, fool, blackguard, puppy, reptile’ on 17 November 1829, and pleading for ‘God’s help for Christ’s sake in this besetting sin’ in April 1831. He was devastated by the sudden death in February 1829 of his saintly elder sister Anne, writing that he immediately left for Seaforth in a state of ‘abstracted shock, at first much dismayed, but afterwards unable to persuade myself of the truth of the news’.19 ‘This for Gladstone,’ Shannon writes, was the first serious breakdown of a family link. He attempted to forge a replacement by making a solemn pact with his younger sister Helen that they should henceforth collaborate and monitor one another’s religious and spiritual development in memory of their sister. This proved more troublesome than edifying. Helen, now a rather ‘difficult’ fifteen-year-old, was in no mood to submit to William’s rather officious direction. Helen’s distress upset her parents, who depended increasingly on her domestic presence. By October 1831 the situation reached the point where Tom [the eldest brother] had to be called in to write to William asking him politely to desist from ‘religious speculations’ with Helen.20\n\nDespite such distractions, Gladstone led a very busy social life at Oxford, just as he had at Eton, attending wine and tea parties, going on long walks with friends, dining out, and going on outings such as the ‘exceedingly pleasant’ visit to Henley in June 1829 to watch the first Oxford and Cambridge boat race.21 Some, at least, of Gladstone’s fellow students found him an intolerable prig, however, and late one evening his rooms at Christ Church were invaded by a group of college ‘hearties’, who proceeded to beat him up. Gladstone recorded the occasion in his diary, in these words: Here I have great reason to be thankful to that God whose mercies fail not… 1). Because this incident must tend to the mortification of my pride, by God’s grace…It is no disgrace to be beaten for Christ was buffeted and smitten… 2). Because here I have to some small extent an opportunity of exercising the duty of forgiveness.22\n\nHis favourite activity was listening to sermons, which he did several times a week, and he must have heard all the resident clergymen, and many visiting ones, eminent and less so, during his three years at the university. For some time, Gladstone thought seriously about offering himself for ordination as a priest, and wrote to his father asking permission to do so. The elder\n\n30\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\nGladstone had much grander ambitions for his son, and wrote back gently discouraging him, and Gladstone – possibly secretly relieved – readily complied, and seems never to have had any regrets. Gladstone, who had already shone at Eton, was by a wide margin the best debater of his time at Oxford. He honed his skills in an essay club which he founded along with a group of Old Etonian friends. Intended as a counterpart to the Cambridge Apostles (of which Arthur Hallam was a member), it was known as the Weg (after Gladstone’s initials). Unlike the Apostles, it did not survive the departure from the university of its founders. Yet Gladstone’s finest performances were reserved for the Oxford Union, founded only five years earlier. Elected its President, his most notable speech, on 17 May 1831, was a vehement attack on the Reform Bill, then making its troubled way through Parliament. He spoke for 45 minutes, and carried the resolution against the bill by 94 votes to 38. Also speaking on the same side in the debate, though with far less impact, was his old Etonian friend the Earl of Lincoln, and he was deeply impressed by Gladstone’s performance. Gladstone’s opposition to the bill was no passing whim. He came to London and sat through the entire five-day debate in the House of Lords, at the end of which the upper house threw the bill out by 199 to 158 in a vote taken at six o’clock in the morning. Gladstone, who at that time held High Tory views, was ecstatic, and was disappointed when – a year later – the Lords reluctantly let the bill through, in the face of William IV’s agreement to create a sufficient number of new Whig peers to vote them down. Gladstone left Oxford at the end of 1831, exuberant in the wake of his outstanding examination results, and noting in his diary, ‘It was an hour of thrilling happiness.’ Nearly sixty years later, on 5 February 1890, he made almost the last of his many subsequent visits to the city, saying in a speech, ‘There is not a man that has passed through that great and famous university that can say with more truth than I can say, I love her from the bottom of my heart.’23 On 7 January 1832, Gladstone settled down at Seaforth House, a country mansion just outside Liverpool to which the family had moved in 1815, to write a memorandum to his father, setting out his intentions for his future. He took immense trouble over the document, continuing and revising it on the eighth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth days of the month, before finally handing it over to his father. Having sensed that John\n\n31\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nGladstone’s own quiet ambition was that his youngest and most brilliant son should enjoy the distinguished political career that he had himself been unable to achieve, he carefully sought arguments as to why he would be justified in following this course. He concluded that parliamentary reform was likely to be the prelude to an attack on the establishment of the Anglican Church. He therefore concluded that it was his duty to enter public life in order to resist that threat rather than follow ‘the belief I formerly entertained’ that he could more effectively perform this service by joining the priesthood. He now felt himself ‘free and happy to own, that my own desires as to my future destination are exactly coincident with yours insofar as I am acquainted with them’.24 He resolved therefore to study the law, and in particular ‘the constitutional branch of it’, better to prepare himself. Gladstone recorded in his diary his gratification at learning from his father that his intentions met his wishes ‘and my dear Mother’s. God be praised.’25 There can be no serious doubt that in attributing the decision both to his temporal and eternal fathers, he was, in fact, following his own desires. The bug of political ambition had already bitten the young Gladstone, however much he sought to dress it up. It was decided that Gladstone should read for the bar at Lincoln’s Inn, but before doing so he left, in February 1832, with his brother John for the ‘Grand Tour’, finishing up in Rome the following July. In the meantime, the Reform Bill was passed, and preparations were made for the general election of the reformed House. One of the strongest opponents of the bill had been the Duke of Newcastle, who was the proprietor of a series of ‘rotten’ or ‘pocket’ boroughs. Several of these had been eliminated by the bill, but he still had a predominant influence in the Nottinghamshire constituency of Newark. At the urging of his son, Lord Lincoln, the Duke wrote to John Gladstone asking whether William would be interested in being one of the two Tory candidates. John Gladstone thought the offer a bit premature, but wrote to his son in Rome, who accepted with enthusiasm. The following December he was duly elected, heading the poll with 887 votes, against 798 for his fellow Tory and 726 for the sole Whig candidate. Lord Lincoln was elected for the neighbouring seat of South Nottinghamshire. The overall result of the election, however, was a massive victory for the Whigs and their Radical allies, who won 479 seats, against 179 for their Tory\n\n32\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\nopponents. It was an overwhelming endorsement of the Reform Bill, and a vote of confidence in Earl Grey’s Whig government. Gladstone proved himself a strong and effective candidate, though he had to face incessant criticism from the Whigs over his father’s ownership of slaves and recent publication of a pamphlet forcefully defending the rights of slave-owners. His election was undoubtedly aided by the widespread use of ‘treating’ and other corrupt practices by his supporters, of which the high-minded Gladstone was apparently largely unaware. He had expressed some qualms to his father about accepting the Duke’s ‘handsome contribution’ to his expenses, fearing that this might compromise his independence. But he was reassured by his brother Tom, who was already an MP, that Newcastle ‘had neither heretofore asked for pledges, nor now demanded them’.26 Gladstone was just short of his twenty-third birthday, and it is instructive to compare the relative ease with which he was able to launch himself on a political career with the many obstacles (largely but not wholly of his own making) which confronted his future great competitor, Benjamin Disraeli. He had to fight no fewer than five contests, changing his party affiliation along the way, before entering the House of Commons in 1837, five years later than his younger rival, at the age of 32. Gladstone’s first months in Parliament were dominated by the slavery issue. Strongly pressed by the abolitionist lobby, of which the Prime Minister’s eldest son Lord Howick MP (later the 3rd Earl Grey) was a leading advocate, the government agreed to bring in an Emancipation Bill. This included a subsidy of £15 million to compensate the slave-owners. Under the leadership of John Gladstone, whose West Indian estates were now valued by him at £336,000 – more than half his total worth – the plantation owners violently objected, asking instead for £20 million, plus a long-term loan of a further £10 million. John Gladstone expected both of his sons in the House of Commons to support his position, especially when he was personally attacked in the Commons by Lord Howick. Howick argued that the higher return that he enjoyed from his investment compared to other planters was because he worked his ‘negroes’ harder, and this was evidenced by their higher death rate. Both Tom and William vigorously defended their father, and William’s first major speech as an MP was devoted to a reasoned appeal to improve the terms of the bill, which was later amended to increase the compensation to £20 million, but\n\n33\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nwithout any long-term loan. William agonised over ‘this awful and solemn question’ in his diary, but, as Checkland notes, he was acutely aware that his own comforts, his education and his father’s ability to pay half the cost of his parliamentary seat were largely owed to the family income from slave labour … Certainly in after life William found it painful to look back on this part of his career.27\n\nAfter the bill was passed, John Gladstone proved to be one of its main beneficiaries. He was compensated for 1609 slaves, and received over £75,000.28 It was not just his contributions to the debate on the Emancipation Bill which marked the early Gladstone out as an improbable future Liberal leader. In Checkland’s words, Few of the shrunken band of Conservatives could have been as truly Tory as the young Member for Newark. The Irish Coercion Bill received his vote. He was against further concessions to Catholic claims in education or any other sphere in Ireland. He was adamant that Church and State should be inviolate: to this end he was against the admission of Jews to Parliament and against allowing dissenters to graduate from the universities unless they were prepared suitably to modify their views. He was in favour of flogging in the forces and of the award of commissions and of promotion in the army and navy on the basis of purchase and patronage. He was for the Corn Law and against the Property Tax. In sum, he was about as far to the right as the British political spectrum allowed.29\n\nIt was little wonder that the great historian Lord Macaulay, at that time a young Whig MP, writing in the Edinburgh Review, referred to Gladstone as ‘the rising hope of those stern and unbending Tories’. The Tories, in a relatively small minority in the House of Commons, appeared to have little prospect of an early return to power, but sharp divisions soon began to emerge among the Whigs, who were deeply split over whether to introduce a wide range of further reforms, particularly concerning Ireland, where the Anglican Church of Ireland continued to enjoy a large income derived from tithes levied on the entire population, though 90 per cent or more were either Catholics or Presbyterians. Lord John Russell, one of the chief architects of the Reform Bill, led the faction wishing to end, or modify, the tithe system. He was fiercely opposed by Edward Stanley, the heir to the earldom of Derby, who was a former Irish Secretary and now\n\n34\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\nMinister for War and the Colonies. In June 1834, Stanley stormed out of the cabinet, and three other ministers resigned alongside him. Stanley hoped his little group would form the basis of a new ‘centre’ party, but they failed to gather a significant following, and eventually joined up with the Tories, Stanley (as the 14th Earl of Derby) becoming their leader for a period of 22 years, from 1846 to 1868. Lord Grey, ageing and dispirited by the lack of unity in his party, threw in his hand in July 1834. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by Lord Melbourne, who remained in office for a mere four months before being peremptorily dismissed by King William IV, who objected to his proposed appointment of Lord John Russell as Leader of the House of Commons. The King wished to appoint Sir Robert Peel, the Tory leader in the Commons, in Melbourne’s place, but he was away on holiday in Italy, so he approached the Duke of Wellington instead. Wellington, who had not enjoyed his previous period as Prime Minister, between 1828 and 1830, declined to serve, but agreed to form a provisional government which would hold the fort until Peel’s return some three weeks later, in December 1834. Peel then took over the reins, keeping Wellington on as Foreign Secretary, while he himself combined the premiership with the role of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Among the junior ministers whom he appointed was the young William Gladstone, just three days short of his twenty-fifth birthday. He was appointed one of five Junior Lords of the Treasury, another being his friend Lord Lincoln. He held the post for exactly one month, being promoted to Under-secretary for the Colonies on 27 January 1835, serving under the Earl of Aberdeen, who was Minister for War and the Colonies. This was an excellent opportunity for Gladstone – as his chief was in the House of Lords, he became the chief spokesman for the whole department in the Commons. It also brought him into close contact with Aberdeen, one of the most senior and influential Tories, and a man known for his kindness and understanding. He was greatly impressed by Gladstone, and in the future became second only to Peel as his promoter and mentor. Nevertheless, Gladstone had some differences with Aberdeen over Colonial Office policies, notably over West Indian education, ‘Gladstone wishing that any educational schemes for the exslaves there should be explicitly Anglican’.30 Aberdeen, nominally an Anglican but effectively a Presbyterian, was unable to agree.\n\n35\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nOn accepting the premiership, Peel, not wishing to form a government based on a small minority of the House of Commons, successfully demanded a dissolution, and a general election was held in January 1835. Peel issued what became known as the Tamworth Manifesto (named after his constituency in Staffordshire), in which he presented his party, now known as the Conservative Party, as a progressive force, accepting both Catholic Emancipation and the Reform Bill, which Tories had fiercely resisted. He created a good impression, and the Conservatives gained more than 80 seats, but still finished up in a minority, with 275 MPs, against 383 for their Whig, Irish Nationalist and Radical opponents. It would only be a matter of time before the government was defeated on a confidence issue in a parliamentary vote. This duly occurred on 8 April 1835, and Peel promptly resigned after only 119 days in office. William IV was humiliatingly forced to re-appoint Melbourne, and after this no British monarch dared to dismiss a government which enjoyed a majority in the Commons. Gladstone, who had been returned unopposed at Newark in the general election, now resumed his place on the opposition benches, his reputation suitably enhanced by his brief ministerial experience. He had long ceased eating dinners at Lincoln’s Inn, and never qualified as a barrister. His main concern continued to be the protection of the Anglican Church against what he saw as Whig attempts to undermine its privileges, particularly in Ireland, where Lord John Russell, now Home Secretary, was still determined to divert part of its tithe income to secular purposes. At this time Gladstone held semi-theocratic views, believing that the state had a duty, through the established Church, to impose a Christian morality on its subjects. He argued the case for this in two books, The State in its Relations with the Church (1838) and Church Principles Considered in their Results (1840). He became closely involved with the Tractarian movement (also known as the Oxford Movement) of High Church Anglicans, attended church daily and, in 1838, drew up proposals for what he called a ‘Third Order’, a lay brotherhood of persons in public life. This was never formally established, but Gladstone with a number of like-minded friends later set up a small private all-male group which they called ‘the Engagement’. They met regularly for prayer sessions and discussions on the religious life, committing themselves to devote a proportion of their incomes, and\n\n36\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\na great deal of their spare time, to charitable activities. The group adopted an austere set of 12 rules: 1 Some regular work of charity. 2 Attendance on the daily service. 3 Observance of the fasts of the church. 4 Observance of the hours of prayer (9, 12, 3). 5 Special prayers for the unity of the church and conversion of unbelievers at some hour: also for the other persons engaged. 6 Rule of number of hours to be spent in sleep and recreation. 7 Meditation with morning prayers – selfexamination with evening. 8 To fix a portion of income for works of mercy and piety. 9 To consider with a practical view the direction of the church concerning confession and absolution. 10 Failing any spiritual director, to follow the judgement of one or more of those co-engaged in the case of breach of rule. 11 If unable to perform (1) contribute funds instead. 12 To meet, compare results, and consider amendments.31\n\nOn 20 June 1837 William IV died, and was succeeded by his niece Victoria, who had just passed her eighteenth birthday, thus avoiding the need for a regency. The change of reign necessitated an immediate general election, which took place in July 1837. It was again won by the Whigs and their allies, who accumulated 349 seats against 309 for the Conservatives. Gladstone came top of the poll at Newark. He had also contested the more prestigious seat of Manchester, which had a much larger electorate, but came third behind the two Whigs. He was joined on the Tory benches by Benjamin Disraeli, who was elected for Maidstone. The two men had little or no contact during the course of the new Parliament. Their political views diverged, with – in modern terms – Disraeli pretty far to the left wing of the party, Gladstone firmly on the right. Their religious and cultural interests were equally far apart, and they moved in different social circles, Gladstone confining himself largely to his fellow Etonians and Oxonians, while Disraeli mixed with a more heterodox, not to say more louche, set. He was ready enough to socialise with anybody, but many of his Tory colleagues avoided him because of his bohemian reputation, others through antisemitism. During the late 1830s, Gladstone – seriously unsettled by the recent marriages of two of his elder brothers – made proposals to three aristocratic ladies. He proved himself an awkward and unpersuasive suitor, and was given short shrift by Caroline Farquhar, a society beauty, who according to a family tradition once said to her mother, on seeing her over-earnest wooer approaching, ‘Mama, I cannot marry a man who carries his bag like\n\n37\n\nT h e G R E A T R I VA L R Y\n\nthat.’ Gladstone was very slow to take the hint, and shortly afterwards Caroline was married to a Whig MP, the Hon. Charles Grey, a younger son of the former Prime Minister and the victor over Disraeli in his first electoral contest, at Wycombe in 1832. Gladstone took his rejection hard, but after a while switched his attentions to Lady Frances Douglas, the eldest daughter of a Scottish peer, the Earl of Morton. As recounted by Richard Shannon, 32\n\nThe pattern of the second suit was much like that of the first. A rather precipitate and alarming proposal to startled parents, flustered fending off what, from their exalted social station, would be a dubiously advantageous alliance, followed ultimately by a formal request to desist. To their infinite relief, the Mortons contrived to marry Lady Frances off to the heir of Earl FitzWilliam. Gladstone indulged in introspective reflections about his failures in love and the ‘icy coldness’ of his heart.33\n\nHe had more success with his third choice, Catherine Glynne, a sister of Sir Stephen Glynne, who had been with him both at Eton and Christ Church. A lifelong bachelor, he was the owner of the Hawarden castle and estate in North Wales. A largely inactive MP who represented Flintshire constituencies, first as a Whig and then as a Tory for 15 years, his main interest in life was the architecture of parish churches. He visited some 5500 of these during his life, and left detailed notes about all of them, which have proved an important source for modern architectural historians. In 1838, Gladstone met up with Glynne, who was on a continental tour, travelling with his mother and his two sisters, seemingly by chance, at Bad Ems, a spa in the Rhineland, to which he was escorting his own sister Helen, whose health had broken down. Leaving her there, he proceeded to Italy, where he had planned a tour with a fellow MP, Arthur Kinnaird. There he met up again with the Glynnes, and soon became enchanted with the elder of the two sisters. Flattered but somewhat baffled by his attentions, and disoriented by having recently been thrown over by a former fiancé, Catherine was hesitant, and it was only six months later that she accepted his highly convoluted proposal. Their engagement was announced on 8 June 1839, and they were quickly married on 25 July at Hawarden at a double ceremony in which Catherine’s younger sister Mary was also married to George (later Lord) Lyttelton. The two couples then left on a joint honeymoon, which included a\n\n38\n\nw illiam e wart gladston e , e arly lif e , 1 8 0 9 – 4 1\n\ntwo-week stay at John Gladstone’s Scottish estate at Fasque. Gladstone was 29, Catherine 27. Catherine, who was related by birth to no fewer than four prime ministers (the Elder and Younger Pitt, Richard Grenville and William Grenville), might well have expected to make a rather grander alliance than with ‘a young Tory MP of slightly eccentric reputation…She had many serious suitors (her husband made a list of nine such after their marriage) and was jilted by Colonel Francis Harcourt about 1835.’34 Yet Stephen Glynne was delighted to accept Gladstone as his brother-in-law, while John Gladstone was enthralled that his youngest son had made such an aristocratic match. Catherine shared William’s strong Christian beliefs, but their characters were very dissimilar, she being much more informal, vague and untidy, in contrast to her husband’s methodical and meticulous ways. Gladstone proved himself an uxorious husband, and the marriage was largely successful, though they tended to drift apart in later years. In the first 12 years of their marriage, four sons and four daughters (one of whom died in infancy) were born. According to Matthew, The Gladstones were a comfortably-off couple, in every sense…Catherine Glynne brought with her, by her husband’s calculation, £10,716.13s.4d. This roughly balanced what William Gladstone already had [from his father]… Apart from his salary during his brief period of office in 1834–5, Gladstone had not earned a penny of his wealth, which he valued in 1840 (including the mortgaged house and his wife’s money) at £34,270.35\n\nThe house referred to was 13 Carlton House Terrace, a highly fashionable residence just across St James’s Park from the Houses of Parliament and the principal government offices. As a bachelor, Gladstone had lived in the Albany, but on his marriage he had bought the lease of this house on a mortgage of £6500, charged at 6 per cent. He continued to live there until 1847, when his father made over to him his own nearby former London residence at 6 Carlton Gardens. In 1856 he moved back to an even grander house at 11 Carlton House Terrace, where he continued to live when he served as Prime Minister, between 1868–1874, using 10 Downing Street merely as an office.\n\n39\n\nThree\n\nPeel and the great Tory split, 1841–7\n\nO\n\nne man – Sir Robert Peel – was to be a dominant influence in the careers of both Gladstone and Disraeli. Perhaps the outstanding British statesman of the nineteenth century, he acted as ‘guide, philosopher and friend’ to Gladstone, persisted in promoting him even when he proved himself contrary, and – if he did not turn him into the Liberal he eventually became – was instrumental in prodding him into becoming a fairly pragmatic ‘centrist’ politician rather than the rigidly reactionary Tory of his early years. For Disraeli, he did not perform a comparable function. Instead, he became the victim of the latter’s fiery oratory, which destroyed his own career and opened the way to Disraeli’s slow progression to the leadership of the Conservative Party. What kind of man was Peel, and how did he come to play a key role in the destinies of both men? His background was similar to Gladstone’s, "
