        "text": "Michelle Vieth took to social media to accuse her former lover and \"Mi Pequeña Traviesa\" co-star of leaking her porn video to the world. The telenovela star blatantly called Hector Soberón out and slammed him for releasing the intimate clip that put a dent in to her nascent career. Vieth who has starred in telenovelas like \"Amigas y Rivales,\" \"Soñadoras,\" \"Mujeres Engañadas\" and many more, went on a tirade where she also singled out everyone that watched the video and therefore added to her violation of privacy. Read the post down below and check out Soberón's reactions following!\n\n\"I am not the young and scared girl that was 15 years younger than Hector Soberón, hurt, and trying to understand why after so much love why everything was happening,\" she said. \"Mother of four little ones that are my life. Today I am not scared and today I put an end to it. STOP. That the man violated my human rights, in specific my sexual rights in such a cowardly way after deciding to edit, take his face out and his voice out of multiple videos that he recorded and make one and profit from it, gives him no right to insulte me, denigrate me, or talk without knowing, or to pay to see something that was reserved exclusively for our intimacy.\"\n\nVieth also added: \"Those type of things and people are the ones that make it possible for child pornography, snuff videos, rape videos and so many aberrations, violations, trangressions to so many humans. That's right, WOMAN with all of its letters, mother as well, without fear... because making love is what it is, an act of love, it can't be taken any other way. Whoever has seen the video has contributed and are part what's lewd in this world, that is enough punishment. For my part I bless you all because your souls need it desperately.\"\n\nAfter Vieth's post went viral, Hector Soberón has now reacted to her allegations. \"I will not play this game. Why did she not say this 15 years ago?\", he said during an interview with \"De Primera Mano.\" \"This destroyed me so much that it has cost me jobs in these 15 years. I want to think that there's something going on here and someone that doesn't want me to progress.\" When asked about if he was the one to leak the video he replied: \"It wasn't me, I didn't edit it, I didn't leak anything, of course not. There's a line that you can't cross and I've never crossed that line. My intimacy I have always maintained it, I have always held a distance, that intimacy and it's something that I can't transgress.\"\n\nSoberón concluded by throwing a little shade toward his \"Pequeña Traviesa\" co-star and hinting that it was an infidelity that ended their relationship. \"She said it was me, but I know who it was, I know very well who it was, but it's not right saying it,\" he said. \"And that's the reason why we got divorced.\""
