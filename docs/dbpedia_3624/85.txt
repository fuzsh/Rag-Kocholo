The international response to the Turkish War of Independence was largely negative, with many nations opposing Turkish nationalism.

The Turkish War of Independence, which took place from 1919 to 1923, was a pivotal moment in the history of modern Turkey. It was a reaction against the Treaty of Sèvres, which had been imposed by the Allied powers at the end of World War I and which sought to partition the Ottoman Empire. The war was led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who sought to establish a sovereign Turkish state.

The international response to the war was largely negative. The Allied powers, particularly Britain, France, and Italy, were opposed to the Turkish nationalist movement. They had vested interests in the region and were keen to maintain their spheres of influence. The Treaty of Sèvres had granted them significant territorial gains, and they were unwilling to relinquish these. They provided support to the Greek forces, who were fighting against the Turkish nationalists.

The United States, on the other hand, was somewhat more sympathetic to the Turkish cause. President Woodrow Wilson had advocated for the principle of self-determination in his Fourteen Points, and this was seen as being in line with the goals of the Turkish nationalists. However, the US was not directly involved in the conflict and its influence was limited.

The Soviet Union also played a significant role in the war. It provided financial and military support to the Turkish nationalists, seeing them as potential allies against the Western powers. This support was crucial in helping the Turks to achieve victory.

In the end, the Turkish nationalists were successful in their struggle. The Treaty of Lausanne, signed in 1923, recognised the sovereignty of the new Turkish state. However, the international response to the war had significant implications for Turkey's relations with other nations. The hostility of the Western powers led to a period of isolation for Turkey, while the support of the Soviet Union helped to shape its foreign policy in the years to come.
