        "text": "Mustafa Kemal Ataturk\n\nTurkey's first President and the leader of the Turkish War of Independence\n\nMustafa Kemal Ataturk was the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey. He was a division commander during the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915 and was instrumental in preventing the partition of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace through his political and military leadership in the Turkish War of Independence. The successful anti-imperialist resistance drove out the various Allied occupying forces, and ultimately led to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923. Ataturk then instituted reforms in the political, economic and cultural aspects of life in Turkey, which led to the creation of a democratic secular nation-state guided by educational and scientific progress.\n\nFounding & History of the Turkish Republic\n\nAtatürk is internationally known as an outstanding statesman, soldier, commander, reformer, and nation-builder who introduced many reforms with the aim of founding a new secular democratic and modern republic after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. As a visionary, revolutionary figure, and political thinker, he strove to set Turkey on a path from which Turks today vow not to stray (this path included a series of political, legal, cultural, social and economic reforms, such as the emancipation of women, change in dress and alphabet). Ataturk's legacy and principles are deeply embedded in the Turkish national consciousness, while the results of his reform and modernization movement are firmly rooted in all realms and dimensions of life in Turkey.\n\nThe Turkish people's enduring respect and gratitude for Ataturk's grasp of the future needs of Turkey, along with his nobility of purpose, is demonstrated by the love of nation and patriotism, and is a reason why his statues and photographs are so widely displayed. Turks, regardless of political party affiliation, desire to protect the national ideals which are founded on Ataturk's legacy and principles.\n\n* The founding principles of the Turkish Republic are often referred to as \"Kemalizm,\" \"Atatürkçü Düşünce,\" or \"Atatürkçülük\" (in addition to \"Atatürk İlkeleri ve İnkılap Tarihi\").
