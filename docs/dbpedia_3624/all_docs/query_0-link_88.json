        "text": "Near the end of the 13th century, the semi-mythical Sultan Osman I founded a Turkish principality in central Anatolia. Over the following centuries, his descendants turned that obscure tribal kingdom into one of the greatest empires the world has yet known. In 1453, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror captured the city of Byzantium, putting an end to the Eastern Roman Empire at last. 1517 CE, the Sultan claimed the title of Caliph, proclaiming himself leader of the Muslim world. Under the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1520-1566 CE), the Empire reached its zenith, controlling most of the modern Middle East, Balkans, and North Africa. Decline and decay inevitably followed, and from the disastrous Second Siege of Vienna in 1683 onward, the Ottoman Empire slowly but inexorably contracted, losing territory, prestige, and power to the encroaching European nation-states. By 1914, the once-proud Caliphate had become a semi-colonized nation, a playground for the Great Powers. It was in a desperate bid to reverse this that the Turkish government launched the Ottoman Empire into World War One on the side of the Central Powers. It was a daring gamble, and it failed. By 1918, Allied troops had overrun all of the Empire’s remaining territories outside of Anatolia, and on October 30th, 1918, the Ottomans signed an armistice with the Allied Powers. On August 10th, 1920, the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain, Italy, and a number of small Allied nations signed the Treaty of Sèvres, putting an end to the Empire and to the state of Turkey itself.\n\nExcept that didn’t end up happening. News of the Treaty prompted revolution in Turkey, and launched the ensuing Turkish War of Independence. War in the Middle East didn’t end until 1923, with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, which created much of the framework for the modern Middle East. The Treaty of Sèvres has always fascinated me, existing as it does as the least-hypothetical form of alternate history. It was a real treaty, drawn up by some of the most powerful counties on Earth. In it, we can see the outlines of a totally different world that could have been created if the Treaty had gone into affect. It’s truly a glimpse into another timeline. So let’s talk about it.\n\nTo understand the significance of Sèvres you must understand the role that the “Eastern Question” had played in European politics during the 19th century. As the Ottoman Empire declined, an intense rivalry erupted between other European Powers over who would get to dominate or conquer the so-called “Sick Man of Europe”. Arguably, this began with Napoleon’s aborted invasion of Egypt and the Levant in 1798. It was certainly in full-swing by the time of the Crimean War of 1853-1856, when a Franco-British Alliance upheld Turkish sovereignty against Russian incursion. Conflict would continue with the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, the various Balkan Wars as those people gradually drove the Turks out of Europe, and the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-1912. All of these conflicts were driven by the persistent fear that somebody (usually Russia) would upset the Balance of Power by destroying the Ottoman Empire, and while everyone wanted a share of the spoils nobody wanted their rivals to get too much. This led to a series of compromises and half-measures.\n\nTurkish entry into the Great War had inevitably doomed this status quo; either the Central Powers would triumph and Turkey would have a chance to reclaim some of her lost glory, or the Allies would and the final partition of Osman’s Empire would begin. This had already begun by 1914, with the formal British annexation of Egypt and Cyprus (both Ottoman possessions occupied by the British since the 1880s). Additionally, to secure Russian support for the war effort, the Western Allies promised the Czar control over the straits of the Dardanelles in the post-war settlement, the premier goal of Russian foreign policy since the days of Catherine the Great. But by the time the Allied powers gathered to negotiate an end to the Sultanate, the international situation had changed. Russia had fallen to Revolution in 1917, and in 1920 the Russian Civil War still raged. There was no longer any need to placate Moscow, and so London and Paris were free to impose any terms they wished on their defeated adversaries. And what they chose was the effective obliteration of Turkey as a sovereign state.\n\nIn the past, I’ve discussed my belief that the Treaty of Versailles was nowhere near as unfair a peace treaty as has often been alleged. Not so for the Treaty of Sèvres, a document which set out to reduce one of the world’s most ancient states to colonial status. The disparate treatment meted out to the Ottomans compared to any of the other Central Powers should demonstrate how hollow the Wilsonian concept of “self-determination was”. Firstly, the Turks were to lose all of their remaining Imperial possessions. Syria and Lebanon were transferred to France, Iraq, the Transjordan, and Palestine to Britain, and the Hedjaz became officially independent. Italy gained official title to the Dodecanese Islands, though they’d been occupying them since 1912. Most of this territory was already under Allied occupation when the Armistice was signed in 1918, and so this was expected. But that was not the end of the Treaty. Greece, which had been sparring with Turkey for territory since the Greek War of Independence of 1821-1830, was to be ceded East Thrace (the last Ottoman territory within Europe) and the city of Smyrna and the surrounding province, which would give the Greeks their first foothold on the far side of the Aegean since the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Istanbul itself and the entire region surrounding the Dardanelles was internationalized, with the Straits open to all commerce and all acts of war forbidden.\n\nThis was not all. A vast swath of Eastern Turkey was granted to the Armenians, creating a massive Armenian Republic with access to the Black Sea. Turkish territory to the south of that was set aside to be established as an independent Kurdistan under British influence. Most of western Anatolia was to become an Italian Sphere of Influence, and central Anatolia was put aside as a French Sphere. The Turks would only maintain true sovereignty over the central highlands surrounding Ankara, and even here their independence would be severely hemmed in. The Ottoman Central Bank was placed under the control of the Allied Powers. Any changes to the tax system or the national budget would require the agreement of the British, French, and Italians. Turkey had to concede full freedom of transit without tariffs or customs to all foreign goods passing through its territory, and it had to reinstate the Capitulations that it had abolished in 1914. The Ottoman Navy was essentially abolished, and the Ottoman Army reduced to 50,000 men. An Allied Commission was established to supervise the Ottoman Military and to ensure compliance. I think it is fair to say that the Treaty of Sèvres reduced Turkey to the status of a protectorate.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the reaction in Turkey was unfavorable. Though the Treaty had been signed by Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha, representing the government of Sultan Mehmed VI, this meant much less that it had even a few years ago. In the few years since the end of WWI, Turkey had come close to total collapse. Ethnic and national militias dominated much of the countryside, the border with the Soviet Union was uncertain at best, and the Sultan’s authority was thin. In 1919, the celebrated Ottoman general Mustafa Kemal had issued the Amasya Circular, proclaiming Turkey to be an independent state. Since then, he’d built up the powerful Turkish National Movement from his base in Ankara, building influence in the government and pushing for a more hard-line policy against the Allies. The British, hoping to forestall opposition, had arrested most of the Ottoman Parliament in March of 1920, dissolving the elected Chamber of Deputies leaving only the Sultan and his appointed Senate. But the move backfired. The illegal and high-handed dissolution of the Turkish government alienated many people, and left Kemal in a position of dominance. Those Members of Parliament who escaped the British flocked to Ankara, and Kemal proclaimed himself head of the new legitimate government, with significant support.\n\nThe Allies hoped that the Treaty of Sèvres was put an end to the unrest in Turkey by establishing a final settlement to the war. It did just the opposite. The Sultan’s acquiescence to its humiliating terms destroyed his remaining legitimacy, and even the appointed Senate refused to ratify it. This set the stage for the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence.\n\nThe War was a confused mess, less of an outright anti-colonial revolution and more of a multi-sided civil war. Kemal’s Turkish National Movement fought against the Armenians, the French, the Greeks, and the Sultan’s army. Britain stayed out of the direct fighting, but provided support to the Greeks and to the anti-Kemalist Turks, and the Soviet Union supplied Mustafa Kemal with weapons and supplies. Over the following two years, the Turkish National Movement won a series of victories against its foreign and domestic foes, driving back the Armenians into the Caucuses, pushing the French south into Syria, and forcing the Greeks to evacuate Anatolia and Thrace. In 1922, Kemal’s troops advanced on Istanbul, which was still then under British occupation. This led to a major diplomatic and political crisis, as the British government was forced to face whether or not it wanted another war. Prime Minster Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were willing, but the British Dominions made it clear that they would support no new foreign adventures, and the rest of the Cabinet was unenthusiastic at best. Britain backed down, and negotiations began again. This would result in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, which would (roughly) set the modern borders of Turkey. Though the Turks lost their empire, they emerged with control of their Anatolian heartland, and as a newly independent secular republic rather than a protectorate of the European Powers. Kemal would serve as the Republic’s president from 1923 until his death in 1938, and would be given the name “Atatürk”, “Father of the Turks”, by Parliament in 1934.\n\nThe Turks had reason to be delighted with how things had fallen out; the Greeks, Armenians, and Kurds less so. But this is less about the rights and wrongs of the situation, and more about the ramifications. The topics touched upon by the Treaty of Sèvres all continue to be major areas of contention in the modern Middle East, and it is mind-boggling to imagine how different (for better and for worse) things could be if the Treaty had ever been enforced. Greece and Turkey’s bitter rivalry continued, as can be seen in the Cyprus Crisis of 1974, and the ensuing partition that lingers to this day. In fact, this very year has seen major maritime disputes between the two countries. Imagine if the Greeks still held substantial territory in Anatolia. Imagine also if the two countries continued to harbor large minorities of each other’s populations, a state of affairs that had existed for centuries and was only ended by the Treaty of Lausanne’s Greco-Turkish Population Exchange, which saw 1.2 million ethnic Greeks deported from Turkey in return for 350,000 Greek Muslims.\n\nThe nascent Republic of Armenia would be overrun and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1920, becoming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic until its independence in 1991. If the grant of Eastern Anatolia had been confirmed, what would have happened? Would Armenia have been able to maintain independence from the USSR? Would the Soviets have been able to secure control of the entire region? Would two Armenias, a Soviet one and a Anglo-British-backed one, have emerged? It’s impossible to say. Once again, these disputes continue to have relevance today. It has only been a few months now since a Russian-mediated ceasefire brought an end to the Nagorno-Karabakh War of 2020, fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan over contested territorial claims.\n\nThe Kurdish people, spread out across modern-day Syria, Iraq, and Turkey, have been at the heart of so many conflicts and controversies over the last century that it would be impossible to list them all. The Turkish government has been engaged in an on-again-off-again war with the Kurdistan People’s Party since 1978. In Iraq, the Kurds revolted in 1943, and again in 1991, when they were brutally suppressed. They have been intimately involved in the Syrian Civil War (2011-present), and the campaigns against ISIS from 2014 to 2019. The independent (or semi-independent) Kurdistan that was planned under the auspices of the Sèvres settlement would have wide-ranging implications on all of the states of Middle East, in ways that are entirety unforeseeable.\n\nAnd of course, one cannot ignore the potential fate of Turkey itself. Historically, the Republic of Turkey that Ataturk founded quickly became a strong and independent state, one of the major regional powers of the Middle East. Under the Treaty of Sèvres it would have been a weak and de-centralized monarchy, carved up into Spheres of Influence, occupied by foreign troops, and lacking control over most of its own basic institutions. Given the rapid collapse of most of the European colonial empires post-WWII, this likely could not have been maintained for long, but the implications would have reverberated for decades. Even just looking ahead twenty years or so to the Second World War: Turkey was neutral during that conflict, something unlikely to occur if it was already partitioned into Italian, French, and British zones. Whatever the intentions of the Sultanate, fighting would likely break out. Historically, the Germans dreamed of a grand “pincer maneuver”, sweeping down from the Soviet Caucuses into Iraq and Syria to link up with the Afrika Korps advancing out of Egypt. Hitler hoped that Turkey could be induced to support the Axis under these conditions. This never came even close to reality, but a world in which Turkey was a weak, Allied-occupied state is one in which something like it is much more likely.\n\nOn the other hand, much of the rise of the Italian fascists can be attributed to fury and humiliation over the so-called “Mutilated Victory” of WWI, the idea that Italy had been robbed of its rightful spoils. A vast Italian dominion in Southwestern Anatolia would have gone a long way towards assuaging those complaints. Additionally, a Turkey laboring under the terms of Treaty of Sèvres would likely see the rise of fascistic, irridentist movements itself, though the conflict of interest with Italy would make any alignment with the Axis problematic under these circumstances.\n\nThe point of this is not to predict with any accuracy the consequences of what a post-Sèvres world would look like so much as to draw attention to the scale of them. The treaties that ended the First World War helped shape the boundaries of the modern world, as the old Dynastic Empires crumbled and the new nation-states emerged. I find it fascinating to look at the embryonic outlines of another version of our world, discussed, debated, planned for—and yet never brought to life."
