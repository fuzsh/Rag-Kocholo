        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n2. The Geographical Imaginaries of Libya\n\n6It is, of course, an anachronism to refer to the geographic space in which the nation-state of Libya persists to this day (who knows if it will continue) as ‘Libya’. For the Ottomans of 1911, the territory was divided into three parts: Trablusgarp vilâyeti (the province of West Tripoli), Fizan vilâyeti (the Province of Fezzan), and Bingazi müstakil sancağı (the autonomous Sanjak of Benghazi). For Europeans the territory followed the Ottoman designations labeling the three provinces Tripolitania, Fezzan, and Cyrenaica, in reference to the seventh-century-B.C.E. Greek colony of Cyrene. Despite the division into separate administrative regions, Europeans and Ottomans often labeled the entire region Tripolitania (or Trablusgarp in Ottoman Turkish) in reference to its largest city. The title ‘Libya’ was introduced to the country only in 1934 when Fascist Italy conjoined the three provinces into one administrative unit. The introduction of this title, a reference to the ancient Roman province of Libya, attempted to bridge Fascist Italy’s empire to its Roman antecedent by associating Mussolini’s imperial ambitions with a glorious Roman past. Ironically, the title stuck even after independence not because of the absence of other names but because both the Sanusi monarchy of 1951 and Muammar Gaddafi’s regime after 1969 hoped to dampen the centrifugal forces of regional divisions by adopting the Italian geographical designation. Our present difficulty with the proper historical designation of Libya in the Ottoman and early colonial period provides a glimpse at a radical transformation in Mediterranean space of which the Italo-Turkish War was part and parcel. The territories that became Libya required hardened borders and boundaries that both the Ottomans and Italians attempted to provide through the nationalization of the territorial gap between British Egypt and French Tunisia and Algeria.\n\n3. Corradini’s Nationalism, Settler Colonialism, and the End of Emigration\n\n30 Ibidem, p. 12.\n\nTherefore, the national organism fractures (si rompe) and dies (and everything dies in this world, nations just as individuals); therefore, the national organism dies, and we have nothing but to carry the corpse to the cemetery. That is to say, dead individuals are delivered to the cemetery; dead national peoples are subjugated (si sottomettono). And it is just, because they no longer possess the forces, that is the national organization (ordinamento), to appreciate (far valere), as much as they can appreciate, the territory upon which they live: and therefore that relationship of equity which first existed no longer exists between them and their territory.\n\n14Corradini thus mobilized his national principle to forcibly eject the inhabitant nationalities, categorizing and dismissing them as either tyrannical Turks or indigent natives, from the territory of Tripolitania. His ideology of nationalism uncannily anticipated the National Socialist quest for Lebensraum in Eastern Europe with its infatuation with ethnic taxonomy and its annihilation of peopled spaces in the name of national expansion.\n\n4. Seizing Tripolitania\n\n16Leading the fleet charged with occupying Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were the first-class iron dreadnoughts of the Italian Navy, Vittorio Emanuele, Regina Elena, Roma, and Napoli. By 2 October 1911 they were anchored off the port of Tripoli and after a delay of 24 hours commenced their bombardment of the city’s outlying forts. Thus the first shots of the Italo-Turkish War landed on the Arab port of Tripoli.\n\n20Before the end of the first month of combat, the Italian advance had stalled just outside of the range of their heavy naval artillery. The Italians, better equipped and supplied, failed to dislodge the Ottoman armies of Turkish officers and local Arab recruits that laid siege to their positions. Writing for the Berliner Tageblatt, Gottlob Adolf Krause, a German linguist in residence in Tripoli in 1911, marveled at the coordination of the Arab and Turkish forces in response to the Italian invasion:\n\n37 SEBALD, Peter, Die italienische Kolonialeroberung von Tripolis – gesehen mit den Augen eines deutsc (...)\n\nWith such calm and confidence everything is executed! The Turkish officers proved themselves outstandingly in a difficult and distressing situation, the whole of Turkey can be proud of them. An entire flotilla of a great power arrived to occupy an undefended city devoid of any soldiers. And the Tripolitanian Police! How have these brave men, who are mostly Arabs, managed to perform their most difficult duty day and night without falling to sleep?\n\n21This unexpected close cooperation between the Ottoman garrison forces and the local population astonished European spectators and frustrated Italian plans to occupy the country. An analysis of this coordination of efforts between mainly Turkish officers and local irregulars provides a new perspective on late Ottoman history, one in which the Ottomans could still maintain a multiethnic empire in an age of nation-states. But what were the contours of this alliance between local and metropole?\n\n5. Nationalism, Territory, and an Ottoman Mission Civilisatrice\n\n24Enver would later receive a letter from the head of the Sanusi order Sidi Ahmad al-Sharif who pledged to support his cause:\n\n43 HANİOĞLU, M. Şükrü, op. cit., p. 151.\n\nHail to the vanquisher of the enemies of the fatherland and of the religion, the son-in-law of his majesty the Sultan, the symbol of strength, whose wisdom makes him the greatest of the great men of the world, the leader of all virtuous monarchs, … the light to all Sanusi Sheikhs, both living and dead….\n\n25Enver’s position as commander in the region of Tobruk as a Turk amongst Arabs who spoke different tongues was met with no disapproval or anxiety. Enver often employed an Islamic discourse to explicate his cause and for whom he fought:\n\n44 Ibidem, p. 188.\n\nAnd you ask me now if I would side with the Turks or with the Arabs! For me and for Sayyid Ahmad (the Sanusi Sheikh) nationality does not exist in Islam. Thus you see, that I will defend us by whatever means and will forget everything for that fight.\n\n26And yet, the Islamic inflection of his speech should not mask the national intentions he had on the territory of Cyrenaica.\n\n29Enver, an Ottomanizing missionary of progress, perceived his role as military commander to be one of conversion. Rather than merely charging the Italian lines, he had to transform the land and people of Cyrenaica from its ‘Oriental’ state – he even uses the term to describe the Sanusiyya – into a progressive military force. He expressed with pride the providential force he had acquired for his nation:\n\n50 Ibidem, p. 152.\n\nI have become the master of the situation. Into my hands has fallen a power (the Sanusiya), a force for which the various powers of Europe, the Italians, the French, the English spend millions to have in their hands. Even the Khedive had tried to appropriate and employ them against us. And thus, this force has come to me without my spending a dime.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\n55 Ibidem, p. 168.\n\n«Wenn wir unsere Ideale nicht verwirklichen können, dann können wir wenigstens unsere Wirklichkeit idealisieren».\n\nAttributed to a ‘German book’ Enver Bey read while stationed in Cyrenaica.\n\n31The geographic space of Libya provided a venue for idealizing the reality of two struggling empires. Corradini’s «nazione proletaria» and Enver’s «sick man of Europe» both envisaged the land of Libya as a means of recovering a wayward population. For Corradini an idealized Libya would be a haven for an Italian proletarian diaspora capable of regenerated the nation’s life force through reincorporation into an Italy with four shores. To create such a port of refuge meant that the territory would have to be emptied of its inhabitants, first discursively through the denial of an Ottoman nation-state and second physically through occupation, conquest, and subjugation to a settler-colonial force. For Enver, on the other hand, the territory itself was merely the staging area of an Ottoman mission civilisatrice that could restore Ottoman hegemony over the region through the educating and disciplining of a potential citizenry."
