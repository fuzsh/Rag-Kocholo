        "text": "In a sign of growing hostility towards the West since the coup in Niger, a businessman proudly shows off his outfit in the colours of the Russian flag in the traditional heartland of deposed President Mohamed Bazoum.\n\nSince the coup, there has been a war of words between the military and the West.\n\nMr Bazoum was a staunch ally of the West in the fight against militant Islamists, and was a strong economic partner as well.\n\nNiger hosts a French military base and is the world's seventh biggest producer of uranium. The fuel is vital for nuclear power with a quarter of it going to Europe, especially former colonial power France.\n\nSince General Abdourahamane Tchiani overthrew the president in a coup on 26 July, Russian colours have suddenly appeared on the streets.\n\nThousands took part in a protest in the capital Niamey on Sunday, with some waving Russian flags and even attacking the French embassy.\n\nIt now seems this \"movement\" is spreading across the country.\n\nThe businessman, based 800km (500 miles) away in the central city of Zinder, didn't want to give his name for safety reasons and asked that we blur his face.\n\n\"I'm pro-Russian and I don't like France,\" he said. \"Since childhood, I've been opposed to France.\n\n\"They've exploited all the riches of my country such as uranium, petrol and gold. The poorest Nigeriens are unable to eat three times a day because of France.\"\n\nThe businessman said thousands had taken part in Monday's protest in Zinder in support of the military takeover.\n\nHe said he had asked a local tailor to take material in the Russian colours of white, blue and red and make an outfit for him, denying that it had been paid for by pro-Russian groups.\n\nNiger is home to 24.4 million people where two in every five live in extreme poverty, on less than $2.15 a day.\n\nPresident Bazoum entered office in 2021 in Niger's first democratic and peaceful transition of power since independence in 1960.\n\nBut his government was a target for Islamist militants linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda who roam across parts of the Sahara Desert and the semi-arid Sahel just to the south.\n\nUnder pressure from the Islamists, the armies in both neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, also former French colonies with considerable French interests, seized power in recent years, saying this would help in the fight against jihadists.\n\nLike Niger, both these countries previously had significant numbers of French troops helping them but as the Islamist attacks continued, anti-French sentiment rose across the region, with people in all three countries starting to accuse the French of not doing enough to stop them.\n\nOnce in power, the junta in Mali welcomed Russia's mercenary Wagner Group as they first forced out French troops and then pushed for thousands of UN peacekeepers to leave.\n\nAlthough Islamist attacks have continued in Mali, Burkina Faso's junta has also grown close to Russia and expelled hundreds of French forces.\n\nIn Niger, anti-French protests were frequently banned by Mr Bazoum's administration.\n\nSeveral civil society groups began escalating anti-French protests in mid-2022, when Mr Bazoum's administration approved the redeployment of France's Barkhane forces to Niger after they had been ordered to leave Mali.\n\nKey among them is the M62 movement, formed in August 2022 by a coalition of activists, civil society movements and trade unions. They led calls against the rising cost of living, poor governance and the presence of the French forces.\n\nVarious planned protests by the group were banned or violently put down by Niger's authorities with its leader Abdoulaye Seydou jailed for nine months in April 2023 for \"disrupting public order\".\n\nThe M62 appears revitalised in the wake of President Bazoum's removal.\n\nIn an unusual move, its members were quoted by state TV mobilising mass protests in support of the junta, as well as denouncing sanctions by West African leaders over the coup.\n\nIt is unclear if the group is linked to the junta known as the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland (CNSP) or to Russia.\n\nBut it was the umbrella group organising Sunday's protest, where smaller civil society groups such as the Coordination Committee for the Democratic Struggle (CCLD) Bukata and Youth Action for Niger were also present.\n\n\"I don't support the arrival of Russians in this country because they are all Europeans and nobody will help us,\" he said. \"I love my country and hope we can live in peace.\""
