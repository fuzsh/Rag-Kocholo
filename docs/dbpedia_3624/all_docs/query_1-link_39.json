The National War of Independence was an effort to create a new state from the ruins of an Empire which had already completed its life.\n\n4. MUSTAFA KEMAL decided to travel across Anatolia and carry on his struggle, and collect a new army as he understood that a political solution against the invaders who were oppressing the Istanbul Government was not possible.\n\n5. The Turkish resistance movements were transformed into a complete war of independence when MUSTAFA KEMAL landed at Samsun as the Inspector of the 9th Army on 19 May 1919. It achieved success against the armies supported by the large countries of the world and under very difficult conditions.\n\n6.  Southeastern Anatolia: invaded by the French and Italian.  Central Anatolia: Left for Turks.  Mediterranean: Invaded by the French, Italian, and the British.  Aegean: Invaded by the Greeks.  Marmara, straits and Istanbul: Invaded by the allies. The situation in Anatolia, as of May 19, 1919 when Ataturk landed Samsun was as:\n\n7. MUSTAFA KEMAL immediately started to organize a national resistance and got in touch with all the army units and local resistance organizations in Anatolia.\n\n8. The negotiations, which restarted in April 1923, resulted in the signing of the LAUSANNE TREATY ON JULY 24, 1923. The treaty recognized the creation of a Turkish State with virtually the same borders as those of the National Pact of 1920 and guaranteed her complete independence.\n\n9. Thus, it marked the successful culmination of the National War of Independence. On October 29, 1923, the Grand National Assembly proclaimed the Republic of Turkey. ATATURK was elected as the new Republic’s first president unanimously."
