        "text": "(with special thanks to Yiğit Akın and Mehmet Beşikçi) This seminar explores the tumultuous and devastating years of military mobilization, war, diplomacy, and nation-building that created the modern Middle East and Balkans as we know them today. It will investigate the political, social, and military history of the period in a wholistic manner, by looking into institutional reform, debates of constitutionalism, and rising nationalisms throughout the 19th and early 20th century Ottoman Empire. We will scrutinize the Ottomans’ road to war through studying the rebellions in Albania and Yemen (1910-12), the Italian invasion of Ottoman North Africa (1911-12), the Balkan Wars (1912-13), and the definitive establishment of the Committee of Union and Progress’ dominance in the empire. We will concentrate on the important aspects of the First World War as fought by the Ottomans, not only the military campaigns, but the declaration of Jihad (Holy War), wartime propaganda, home front, forced deportations, and state-sponsored population engineering projects. Finally, we will try to understand the impact of the war on societies and political entities which were drastically reshaped by the direct results and long-term legacies of the conflict. The class aims to familiarize the students with the fundamental chronology, events, and individuals in the Ottoman and post-Ottoman World during this period. Another goal is to introduce students to the basic historiography and major historical debates regarding the Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the experiences of the civilians as well as the members of the armed forces. Finally, students will learn how the war is remembered in the post-Ottoman world and how the perception of the conflict created competing national narratives and national identities.\n\nThe War That Never Ended: Postwar Continuity and New Challenges in the Aftermath of the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires, 1918–1923 An International Conference and Research Workshop Organiser: Institute of History, Jagiellonian University; Pratt Institute Venue: Poland, Kraków, Institute of History, Jagiellonian University Date: October 24–26, 2019 (Thursday–Saturday) Application deadline: June 1, 2019 Form of abstracts: electronic file (doc, docx, rtf, pdf), 300 words max in English Applications to be sent to: krakowpostWWI@pratt.edu Workshop fee: 250 PLN www: https://postwarconference.wordpress.com/ Call for Papers In 1914, imploding European powers committed murder and mayhem on an unforeseen scale around the world with enormous and irreversible global consequences. This bloody, sometimes even fratricidal, struggle wrought unprecedented destruction and death; by the time this disaster was “over,” a new world emerged beyond the imaginations of the perpetrators, participants and witnesses of this era. Post-armistice humanity around the globe was changed and was left heavily scarred, anxious, and full of economic, political, and cultural uncertainty. Many reflected about the recent catastrophe and sought to engage entire societies in the formation of a new order. This re-building and re-imagining could be seen from the local to the national to international levels, and included the process of constructing a lasting memory of 1914–1918 and of creating narratives about the conflict. Undoubtedly, the years of the Great War are an important caesura in the historiography of the new world. The centuries-old empires of Europe collapsed following the 1918 truce, but the agile colonial powers insisted on clinging to their overseas territories and their colonial clashes continued. For some historians there were not two world wars, but a twenty-year-long intermission that festered with uncertainties and anxieties. What is more, despite the fact that the Great War was over in the West, warfare continued for months and even years in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe, including the territories of the former Ottoman Empire. The War That Never Ended Conference invites papers engaging with the multilayered complexities, lasting and prolonged global contributions of this period, including the cultural, political, and social history of the immediate and prolonged aftermath of the First World War, its revolutions and birth of nations and states. We invite: • a particular focus on the responses of the politicians, intellectuals, artists, as well as ordinary citizens with the expectation that social history profoundly informs political and economic history; • papers focusing on and revealing the ensuing violence, mayhem and destruction in the aftermath of the war; • papers considering the creation of new cultural and political trends in the hothouse of the period; • a consideration of whether the term “Lost Generation” coined by Ernest Hemingway can be used in reference to East-Central Europe and the Ottoman Empire. • papers on post-imperial settlements, adjustments and consolidations within the geographies of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires to further our comparative understanding of post-imperial national projects and practices. Comparisons may consider areas and issues such the rule of law, the role of religion, minorities, (de)democratization, governance, as well as cultural, economic and political clashes in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. • explorations of the post-Great War formation of new states and their relationships with cultural diversity, de/colonization, democracy, and how they all interfaced with the impending clashes of World War II. Together, these inquiries can enhance our understanding of contemporary brutal conflicts such as the refugee crisis, the obstacles for democratization and the impending rise of authoritarianism in post-Empire geographies. While illuminating the post-Great War period, we hope The War That Never Ended Conference will also contribute to our understanding of the present. Accompanying events The conference will be accompanied by keynote lectures delivered by experienced scholars in this field, as well as a source-studies seminar in the Kraków Archives and Museums. As a part of our workshop, we are planning to prepare a special tour to WWI battlefields in order to visit selected military cemeteries created to commemorate the fallen soldiers in Galicia, and to see some of the splendid examples of war monuments designed by then famous artists. The excursion will only take place in favourable weather conditions. As an alternative, we are planning a visit to Kraków’s museums. Procedure Abstracts, no longer than 300 words (including title, research questions, a brief description of sources and methods), as well as contact details, name and institutional affiliation, should be sent to: krakowpostWWI@pratt.edu. The deadline for abstract submission is 1st June 2019. The complete lineup of speakers will be announced by the end of June 2019. Conference fee The conference fee is 250 PLN (=€60/$65), which includes: participation, conference materials, participation in the planned excursion, refreshments, lunches and dinners. Please note that neither the costs of travels to and from Kraków nor of accommodation are covered by the organizers (however, we will be happy to assist you in looking for a hotel near the conference venue).
