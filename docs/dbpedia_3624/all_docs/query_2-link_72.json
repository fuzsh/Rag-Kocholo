        "text": "Night has fallen on Paris. Yet, on Rue Saint-Dominique, where diplomats and military personnel share a building, and in Hexagone Balard, which houses the headquarters of the French armed forces, workers are busy countering the flood of fake news that is taking over social media. On September 30, the outcome of the military coup staged a few hours earlier in Burkina Faso is still uncertain, but the disinformation – relayed by \"Russian agents,\" according to French sources – accuses France of dropping paratroopers over Bobo-Dioulasso, the country's second-largest city, to \"save\" Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who came to power eight months earlier, also through a coup. The paratroopers intend to shelter him in the French special forces base in Kamboinsin, on the outskirts of Ouagadougou, in order to organize a counterattack against his former comrades, who are now preparing to overthrow him. Paris has not yet reacted officially to the events, but it has already been blamed for its supposed intentions: Supporting a faltering head of state against the supposed will of his people.\n\nThis putsch highlights the cracks in the Burkinabè army, which has been unable to stem the jihadist outbreak that is now devouring 40% of national territory and pushing the population to the brink. It would also demonstrate that, in a moment of confusion, condemning possible French interference is enough to see thousands of young people take to the streets and turn history on its head.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Burkina Faso attempts difficult talks with jihadist groups\n\n\"We have nothing to do with Damiba. He is neither guarded nor protected by French forces,\" a diplomatic source told us that evening via text message, before even being asked. Is extricating the embattled lieutenant colonel – similar to the operation that removed the then-newly overthrown president, Blaise Compaoré, from the violence on the streets in 2014 – a possibility? \"That was another time,\" a military source promptly cut in. \"Today's events are being treated as an internal matter in Burkina Faso.\" Do the diplomats in charge of Africa, and the officers for whom this continent remains an irreplaceable training ground and site for strategic operations, sense that a wave is about to break?\n\nFrance's denial; violence in the streets\n\nThe next day, October 1, an insurgent soldier went on Burkina's national television RTB to accuse the rival camp (the pro-Damiba side) of \"preparing a counteroffensive\" with Paris's support. Regardless of official French denials, his statement had the effect of a call to popular protest. What followed is a now familiar scenario. Stones and Molotov cocktails were thrown at the French embassy; the Instituts Français in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso were ransacked. Young people gathered near places associated with a French presence, ready to make trouble. Russian flags appeared in the angry crowds. No French nationals were injured, but economic symbols of the former colonial power (Air France agencies, TotalEnergies gas stations and the premises of the Bolloré Group) were vandalized."
