        "text": "“In Facing the Victorious Turks, Andrew Orr skillfully presents readers with a truly transnational history, connecting West to East via the Middle East, offering insight into histories of intelligence agencies, military activity, nationalism, and the geopolitics of key regional players. The book provides a new perspective on the rise of Turkish nationalism by viewing it through the lens of French officials and intelligence agents, therein contributing a cutting-edge analysis to the growing field of intelligence studies. With extensive use of archival sources and intelligence products, Orr adeptly displays the erroneous tracks reached by French officers who misjudged Mustafa Kemal as a result of their own biases, goals, and perceptions.”—Deborah Bauer, author of Marianne is Watching: Intelligence, Counterintelligence, and the Origins of the French Surveillance State\n\n“Orr offers fresh insights into the French decision-makers' attempts between early 1920 and late 1921 to make sense of Mustafa Kemal leading the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923) in Anatolia to salvage the defeated Ottoman Empire. Mustafa Kemal’s wartime rhetoric and diplomacy puzzled the French as they tried to understand his true ideological leanings and political stance on Pan-Islamism, the Bolsheviks, Germans, and the British. Orr deciphers how contemporary Orientalist prejudices and imperial insecurities led most French military, diplomatic, and intelligence officials in Paris and on the ground to misinterpret Mustafa Kemal and his nationalist movement. Orr also demonstrates how, ultimately, the French leadership went against the prevalent anti-Kemalist stance and opted to strike a deal with Mustafa Kemal in October 1921. Orr’s book is set to be among the essential readings on the post–World War I French involvement in the Middle East, Franco-Turkish relations, and Mustafa Kemal before he became ‘Atatürk.’”—Ahmet S. Akturk, associate professor of history at Georgia Southern University"
