        "text": "Last year at the Cannes Film Festival, the Sarajevo-born director Emir Kusturica was taking questions from the press about his new movie. He was discussing the sorts of things he likes to discuss: why the cinema he loves is being ruined by an inhuman, mass-produced fast food coming out of Hollywood, for instance. Until, inevitably, he was visited with a mild version of the question reporters have never failed to ask him over the last decade: During the wars that destroyed Yugoslavia in the 1990's, why didn't he come out publicly against Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader who was ravaging his homeland?\n\nKusturica, who spent most of his life in Bosnia but now lives in Serbia, is one of the most celebrated filmmakers in Europe, as festooned with various film-festival golden palms and golden lions and silver bears as anyone working in cinema today. His films \"When Father Was Away on Business\" and \"Underground\" each won the top prize at Cannes in 1985 and 1995, respectively, and this week he returns to Cannes to serve as president of the most prestigious festival jury in the world. But over the last 10 years, the man whom his fans see as the heir to Fellini's impassioned exuberance has been asked about his politics almost as much as his movies. And at times, he loses his patience for it. So, in Cannes: why didn't he speak up against Milosevic?\n\n\"Nobody's perfect,\" he said.\n\nWhen he's not being questioned by reporters or touring as a guitarist in his popular Balkan gypsy-punk-rock band, Kusturica (pronounced KOOS-toor-eet-sa) now spends most of his time in a small village in western Serbia he has recently had constructed from scratch. He's a big man, standing 6-foot-3, with a powerful chest and a potent set of shoulders, and there is an amiable menace to the way he moves; he has a reputation as a brawler and a firebrand, but, relaxing in his village, where I visited him recently, he comes off more like a gentle papa or, sometimes, a beneficent feudal lord.\n\nWhile Kusturica may be little known in America, he has achieved a peculiarly European renown. In Madrid, where his band, the No Smoking Orchestra, played to a sold-out crowd in January, his film \"Black Cat, White Cat\" remains wildly popular seven years after its release. His most recent movie, \"Life Is a Miracle,\" in which a Serbian engineer falls in love with his Bosnian Muslim hostage, shared France's prestigious CÃ©sar award for best European film, in February. And yet he remains enormously controversial. To his critics, Kusturica is an apologist and propagandist for the murderous forces that devastated his country.\n\nBorn in 1954, Kusturica grew up an only child in a secular Muslim family in Sarajevo, the capital of the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At 18 he was packed off to Prague to study at the Czech state film school, FAMU, in part thanks to the older Kusturicas' anxiety over the young Emir's enthusiastic interest in minor acts of youthful criminality. It didn't take him long to be noticed. By the time he was 40, he had already won most of the major prizes the film world has to offer.\n\nThe international success of his first films, set in Sarajevo, was unheard of for a Yugoslav director, and Kusturica was essentially crowned a prince of the city, its great cultural savior and all-around celebrity; but the war that dismembered the nation ended his love affair with his birthplace. In 1992, Serbian paramilitiaries, with the support of the Yugoslav army, began a campaign of terror against Bosnia's Muslims and Croats as the leaders of the Bosnian republic began to follow other republics in seceding from Yugoslavia. When the fighting began, Kusturica was living in Paris. \"I couldn't believe it,\" he says. \"I was one of those people who wouldn't believe this would happen, that this could be happening. I didn't want to believe.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
