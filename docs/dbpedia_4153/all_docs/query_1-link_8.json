        "text": "The Face of Honour is produced by Galileo production Montenegro in coproduction with Cinnamon films Beograd and with support from the Film Centre of Montenegro, the Ministry of Culture of Montenegro and Film Center Serbia.\n\nThe film focuses on the siege of a house during World War II and the dilemmas this siege triggers: a child under pursuit finds a shelter in the house of an enemy of his people. As the house is surrounded by the host’s people’s army, the owner of the house is faced with a moral dilemma, while the army gradually loses their patience: surrender the child to his persecutors and sacrifice his honour or refuse and forfeit the lives of his entire family. The film re-examines the dimensions of an individual human sacrifice through the prism of two different worlds: the world of honour and the world of war.\n\nThe film was developed in script workshops at the Balkan Film Market in Tirana and MIDPOINT. The scriptwriters are Ana Vujadinovic and Melina Pota. The script was adapted from the story titled The Face of Honour written by Zuvdija Hodžić\n\nProduction information:\n\nProducer:\n\nGalileo production Montenegro (Montenegro)\n\nCoproducer:\n\nCinnamon Beograd (Serbia)\n\nSupported by: Film Centre of Montenegro, Film Center Serbia, Ministry of Culture of Montenegro"
