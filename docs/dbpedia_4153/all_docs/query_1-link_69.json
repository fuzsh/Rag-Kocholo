A short, bald Roma man, played here by musician-dancer Husein Alijević, broke out with a series of hit turbo-folk songs and ballads in 1991. The 140-minute film spans his life from growing up in a juvenile correctional facility, through petty thieving in Belgrade's concrete jungle, to his first hits, after which he became one of the biggest stars on the scene.\n\nThis true rags-to-riches life tale caters well to regional, and especially Serbian, audiences' appetite for content dealing with the criminal milieu of the era, but also that of the present day, like in Miloš Avramović's two South Wind films or the TV series Besa and Legacy, and the more politically orientated shows such as The Clan and Civil Servant. Movies such as Ćeranić's own Loan Shark and Luka Mihailović's Indigo Kristal, meanwhile, offered a somewhat artier approach to the theme.\n\nThe film's title is a reference to the ballad “Nedelja” (lit. “Sunday”), one of the most famous songs by Džej (pronounced “Jay”), which is still hugely popular in the region.\n\nBelgrade-based Art Vista first opened the film in Serbia on 65 screens, to then expand to 100, including Montenegro and Bosnia, in the second weekend. This week, it heads via distributor Con Film to Cineplexx cinemas in Croatia, which are second in terms of the number of screens to Cinestar in the territory."
