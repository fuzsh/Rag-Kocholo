        "text": "\"This is a huge investment and Netflix has once again shown that it promotes Polish culture and believes and supports native creators. Partners on the side of Netflix have given us great trust, equipped us with the appropriate resources and created such a creative environment in which the implementation of this project became possible”, producer Magdalena Szwedkowicz said in a statement.\n\nThe script is penned by Marcin Baczyński and Mariusz Kuczewski.\n\nLeszek Lichota is Professor Rafał Wilczur, who loses his family and memory, and meets his daughter years later. Maria Kowalska plays the daughter. The cast includes Ignacy Liss, Anna Szymańczyk, Mirosław Haniszewski, Mikołaj Grabowski, Izabela Kuna, Paweł Tomaszewski, Małgorzata Mikołajczak and Łukasz Szczepanowski.\n\nThe budget and the shooting dates have not been disclosed.\n\nNetflix has already produced over 30 Polish films and series. Only in 2022, the service spent 84.5 m EUR / 400 m PLN on local productions, and since 2018 it has created over 3,500 jobs for Polish actors, screenwriters, directors and crews working on and off set.\n\nProduction Information:\n\nProducer:\n\nNetflix\n\nAnna Kot, Poland PR: This email address is being protected from spambots.
