        "text": "Senegal has a rich political and cultural history. Its roots can be traced back to the ancient kingdoms of Ghana and Djolof, and it was once a colony of France after being contested by several European powers. Since gaining independence in 1960, Senegal has been known for its political stability in Africa. The national language is Wolof, which is spoken throughout the country. Senegal is renowned for its generous spirit, which is evident daily. The country includes urban centers and rural areas, embodying the enriching essence of generosity represented by the term “Teranga.” This quality continues to enchant those who have experienced its positive energy.\n\nanaiis is a Toulouse-born artist of Senegalese heritage, and a child of the diaspora, who has lived in various cities, including Dublin, Dakar and Oakland. When she completed production on her latest single, “OPENHEARTED,” she wanted its accompanying video to act as a homecoming for her—a reconnection with Senegal and her roots. The resulting short film, made in partnership with director and photographer Jenny Brough, unfolds as a series of vignettes that celebrate Senegal’s characters, cultures and rich history. It captures the essence of everyday life and people of different ethnic groups and ages, framed against the country’s diverse nature and landscape.\n\nanaiis and Brough embarked on the journey across the country with a predominantly Senegal-based crew, and the film also involved a Senegalese team at all production levels. Their mission was not just to capture the essence of Senegalese life and culture but to do so authentically, focusing on real lived experiences rather than staged scenes. “Before traveling to Senegal, I did a lot of preparation work and ended up with a 100-page research document,” Brough recalls. “I wanted to go there with as much knowledge as possible and ensure I understood everything before arriving. It wasn’t just about people featured in the videos; it was also everyone we worked with, from sourcing fabrics from the markets shown in the film to working with stylists and collaborating with local designers.”\n\nThis dedication to authenticity is a testament to anaiis and Brough’s respect for the people and the culture they were portraying. One moment that stood out for anaiis was the powerful naming ceremony they attended. Having just become a mother, anaiis felt a real sense of attachment with the baby’s grandmother and with the rest of the family. “This kind of genuine connection made the video beautiful,” she says, “going beyond just capturing passing moments and forming a real and deep connection.”\n\n“When I think about collaboration,” anaiis continues, “it is a beautiful reminder of how nothing exists in isolation. When I think about Senegal, community and generosity stand out. ‘OPENHEARTED’ is a triumphant homage to diverse landscapes and the generosity of our art-making. The film showcases many faces and characters, each stealing your heart. This story is about coming home, heritage and rediscovery, built on contributions and collaborations through new connections forged in Senegal’s vibrant communities. It feels like a celebration, and we need more of that in art. ”"
