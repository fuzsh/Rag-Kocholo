        "text": "The St. Petersburg-Clearwater area will once again be the setting for another film.\n\nTitled, “A Taste of Love,” this romantic comedy is written by local talent and inspired by a slice of Tampa Bay paradise.\n\nThe movie leads include Erin Cahill and Martin Kove. Cahill has had roles in several Hallmark films such as “Sleigh Bells Ring” and “Secret Ingredient,” as well as shows like “How I Met Your Mother” and “Saving Grace.” Kove has had roles in the film “Karate Kid” and the show “Cobra Kai.” Kove’s son, Jesse Kove, also has a role in the film.\n\nConrad De La Torres III and Michael E. Brown, of Digital Caviar an independent film production company based in the Tampa Bay area, co-wrote the script and are also co-directing. Lincoln Lageson is producer of the film.\n\nThe writers said they were inspired by the beauty, and cuisine, of the Tampa Bay area.\n\nLine Producer Elayne Schneiderman Schmidt discovered the project initially. She previously has completed more than 70 projects in the industry, from the award-winning television series “Miami Vice” to “Up in the Air,” starring George Clooney and Anna Kendrick. She also worked on Oscar winning, “Moonlight.”\n\n“I could gather my team and shoot anywhere in the country but I choose Pinellas County for the friendly work environment, beauty of the area and talented crew here in Florida,” says Schmidt. She has brought a variety of projects to the Tampa Bay area, including several Hallmark films.\n\nThe production team and actors will be filming in the Pinellas County area through the end of July.\n\n“A Taste of Love” is scheduled to be released in early 2022.\n\nPhoto caption: Actors Jesse Kove and Erin Cahill are in town for a two-week shoot on the set of the romantic comedy feature film “A Taste of Love” filming in Dunedin, St. Petersburg and Clearwater.\n\nPhoto credit: Rod Millington"
