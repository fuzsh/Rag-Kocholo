        "text": "Was this helpful?\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nThe feedback you submit here is used only to help improve this page.\n\nThat’s great! Thank you for your feedback!\n\nThank you for your feedback!\n\nAbout Text iQ in Dashboards\n\nSometimes a study calls for a dashboard that performs more extensive text analysis than a Word Cloud can provide. You may wish to label text responses by topic, or perform analysis on the sentiment (i.e. positive/negative slant) of a comment. With Text iQ in Dashboards, you can perform these analyses and display them in your widgets, just as you would with any other variable.\n\nText iQ can be used in CX Dashboards, brand dashboards, and pulse dashboards. It is not available in any other Employee Experience dashboards.\n\nQtip: To use Text iQ in a CX Dashboard, the dashboard user must belong to a role with Edit Dashboard enabled.\n\nAttention: In order to analyze text in different languages, you’ll need to pull in the UserLanguage field before visiting Text iQ for the first time. This will help ensure that Text iQ will map the correct language to your topics and responses. For more details, see the UserLanguage section on our Respondent Information page.\n\nNavigating to Text iQ in Dashboards\n\nAttention: Text iQ in Dashboards is completely separate from Text iQ in surveys. While you can map Text iQ results from a specific Survey’s Text iQ, the Dashboard’s Text iQ is unique in that it allows you to analyze any open-ended field mapped to the Dashboard. This means you can analyze five different surveys’ text responses and report them all in one dashboard!\n\nThere are 2 ways to find Text iQ in a dashboard. Regardless of which method you use, each will show the same text analyses you’ve conducted in the dashboard previously.\n\nOne option is to go to the settings page of your dashboard, and select the Text iQ tab.\n\nAnother option is to click the Text iQ button at the top of the page.\n\nQtip: There are a few situations where you won’t see this Text iQ button:\n\nIf you have any data restrictions applied.\n\nIf your organization doesn’t have Advanced Text iQ.\n\nIf you’re only a participant in a Pulse dashboard.\n\nIf you’re viewing the dashboard from the Dashboard Viewer.\n\nMapping Text Entry Questions\n\nBefore you start performing text analysis, you need to make sure your text entry questions are mapped correctly.\n\nIn your dashboard data, make sure you’ve set your text entry questions to Open Text.\n\nIf your dashboard has multiple sources mapped to it, it is okay to not have data mapped to the Open Text field for each of your sources.\n\nText Analysis Capabilities\n\nText iQ has the same capabilities in the Survey Platform as it does in dashboards. Below is a series of links to the Survey Platform pages, complete with step-by-step instructions.\n\nAttention: While Text iQ works the same way in both software, the results cannot be combined. Topics and sentiment analysis that you perform in the Survey Platform can be mapped into a CX dashboard. If you enable Text iQ on your dashboard, new fields will be created. These new fields will not carry over to your survey.\n\nText iQ Functionality: Navigating Text iQ, saving changes, and the spellcheck and lemmatization capabilities.\n\nTopics in Text iQ: How to create and manage Text iQ topics. Also includes how to build complex searches.\n\nSentiment Analysis: How to edit and perform sentiment analysis.\n\nWidgets in Text iQ: How to read and manage the widgets that appear directly inside Text iQ. Note that these are not necessarily widgets that can be used in the dashboard’s pages.\n\nQtip: If you have multiple surveys mapped into your dashboard, you should enable Text iQ on your dashboard rather than each individual survey.\n\nQtip: Text iQ is only compatible in dashboards with less than 100 sources.\n\nMapping Topics and Sentiments\n\nWhen you start performing text analysis in dashboards, the topics and sentiments will map onto your dashboard automatically and be assigned the best field type for their data. These fields include:\n\nSentiment: This field will be populated with the overall response level sentiment label.\n\nSentiment Score: This field will be populated with overall response level sentiment score.\n\nSentiment Polarity: This field is no longer used and will eventually be deprecated.\n\nTopics: This field will be populated with all of the topics associated with a response.\n\nParent Topics: This field will be populated with all of the parent topics associated with a response. If you are using hierarchical topics, this field is no longer needed in your dashboard.\n\nTopic Sentiment Label: This field will be populated with a sentiment label for each topic associated with your response.\n\nTopic Sentiment Score: This field will be populated with a sentiment score for each topic associated with your response.\n\nTopic Hierarchy Level Fields: If you are using hierarchical topics, there will be 5 fields corresponding to the topics at levels 1 through 5 (ex. Topic Hierarchy Level 3). Each field will contain a list of topics for that level.\n\nYou can rename these fields as needed. You will not be able to delete them, change the field type, or change the mapping. By default, the field names include the name of the Open Text field being analyzed and the name of the specific text analytics. For example, “Movie Feedback – Sentiment.”\n\nQtip: Would you like to map topics and sentiments created in your survey’s text analysis? These are also pulled in automatically when you map data, but only if survey text analysis was performed before you mapped data to your dashboard. To add these to your dashboard data, create a new field and select Embedded Data when you map it. Under this menu, you’ll find the survey sentiments and topics.\n\nAdding Text Analysis to Widgets\n\nTo add your text entry question’s topics or sentiments as a source, metric or dimension in a widget, look for the question text with “- Topics” or “- Sentiment” at the end.\n\nExample: Here, the text topics have been selected as the dimension in the breakdown bar (left) and as the rows of a table (right).\n\nThere are also widgets made especially for text analysis performed in CX Dashboards. See Text iQ Table Widget and Text iQ Bubble Chart Widget.\n\nFAQs\n\n'>\n\nHave you ever wanted to see how your open-ended responses correlate with more quantitative data? For example, are customers who address \"ease of use\" in their feedback also more likely to mention your mobile app? If customers tend to have a higher sentiment when they mention your support team, are they also more likely to give higher NPS ratings for your entire company? To answer these questions and more, Text iQ variables, such as topics and sentiments, can be analyzed with Stats iQ.\n\nThe Settings tab is where you can modify general project settings, intercept settings, and session replay settings. Before you get started, it helps to get familiar with how this tab is organized.\n\nWith piped text, you can customize question and answer choice wording for each respondent, allowing each of them to have a customized, dynamic, and personal survey experience. Piped text is a line of code you add to your survey that pulls information from different sources and displays that information to the respondent (or can be used in display logic, embedded data, and other areas).\n\nTo present XM data on a map:\n\nStats iQ is a powerful statistical analysis tool. With this tool, you can easily conduct analyses such as regressions, cluster analysis, and more.\n\nYou can define report settings in the Visualization tab."
