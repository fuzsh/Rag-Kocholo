        "text": "With Love, the new action movie from Universal and 87North starring Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan, will be released in theaters on Feb. 7, 2025.\n\n87North has been behind such Uni action movies as Nobody, Violent Night, Atomic Blonde and this summer’s The Fall Guy which won over SXSW audiences in its world premiere on Tuesday night as well as scoring 92% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics.\n\nWith Love is produced by 87North’s Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, and it’s written by Josh Stoddard (Warrior, Kaleidoscope), Luke Passmore (Archenemy, Slaughterhouse Rulez), and Matthew Murray (Sheltered, CloudStreet: Soaring the American West). Guy Danella (Violent Night) is also producing for 87North. The pic reps the feature directorial debut of veteran stunt coordinator and fight coordinator Jonathan Eusebio, whose credits include Black Panther, The Avengers, the John Wick films, The Matrix Resurrections, Violent Night, Deadpool 2, The Fate of the Furious, Doctor Strange, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Wolverine, The Bourne Legacy and 87North’s upcoming The Fall Guy which opens on May 3, the start of the summer box office season.\n\nEusebio also served as the second-unit director on Deadpool 2, Violent Night, and Birds of Prey.\n\nCurrently there are no wide releases on Feb. 7 next year. However, With Love is opening a week in advance of Disney/Marvel Studios’ Captain America: Brave New World and Paramount’s untitled Smurfs animated musical movie.\n\nQuan won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar last year for A24’s highest grossing movie of all-time, Everything Everywhere All at Once. Quan’s role in that movie re-ignited the once child star-now adult’s acting career; the actor having broken out in Steven Spielberg 1980s productions Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Goonies (directed by the late Richard Donner)."
