An aggregate meter is a single meter that contains the cumulative total of multiple tenant meters. For example, an apartment building may have 100 electricity meters (one for each tenant), but instead of entering 100 individual meters into Portfolio Manager, you may enter one aggregate electricity meter that combines all of the electricity for the tenants into one meter. Once a meter has been marked as an “Aggregate,” you have the option to enter some details about each of the individual meters that roll up into it, so that the property owner can review the accuracy and completeness of the consumption data in the meter.</li><li><b>No</b> - This property does not have any Aggregate meters (for this fuel type).</li></ul>Metrics are available for each of the following five fuel types: <ul><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-Electric</li><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-Natural Gas</li><li> Aggregate Meter(s)-District Steam</li><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-District Hot Water</li><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-District Chilled Water</li></ul>Also see: <a href=\"#AggregateMetersNumberOfIndividualMetersIncluded\">Aggregate Meter – Number of Individual Meters Included</a>.\n\nAggregate Meter – Number of Individual Meters Included\n\nIf you have an aggregate meter, you have the option to enter identifying information about each individual meter that rolls up into it (Custom ID Name, Custom ID, Service Address, Active/Inactive, and Date Meter Became Active). This metric is the count of the active meters that have been entered as part of your aggregate meter for the Metric Year. If you have multiple aggregate meters of the same fuel type, this number will be the sum of all of the individual meters for all of the aggregate meters for that fuel type. You cannot get the detailed information about each individual meter from Portfolio Manager Reporting, but you can download this information from the Custom Download screen. <br><br>Metrics are available for each of the following five fuel types: <ul><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-Electric– Number of Individual Meters Included</li><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-Natural Gas– Number of Individual Meters Included</li><li> Aggregate Meter(s)-District Steam– Number of Individual Meters Included</li><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-District Hot Water– Number of Individual Meters Included</li><li>Aggregate Meter(s)-District Chilled Water– Number of Individual Meters Included</li></ul>\n\nAlert Metrics\n\nYou can use the following Alerts to spot check your properties for the most common errors that cause metrics to show as \"N/A.\" <br><br>These alert metrics are at the property level:<ul><li><b>Gross Floor Area is 0 ft2</b> – Your property Gross Floor Area must be larger than 0 ft2.</li><li> <b>Property has no uses</b> – Each property must have at least one Property Use (ex: Office, Retail, K-12 School). A property use is automatically created when you first create a property. You can also create one on the Details tab.</li><li> <b> Data Center Issue (with Estimates, IT Configuration, or IT Meter)</b> - If you have a Data Center, then you need to either be using Data Center Energy Estimates or have an IT Meter. This alert will flag any properties without the required data/meters. See this <a href=\"https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/article/What-does-the-metric-Alert-Data-Center-Issue-with-Estimates-IT-Configuration-or-IT-Meter-report-1600088546596\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ</a> for more details. </li></ul>These alert metrics are available for Energy, Water, and Waste: <ul><li> <b>No meters are associated with this property</b> – This means you haven't told Portfolio Manager which meters to use towards your metrics. You can associate meters from the Energy (Water/Waste) tab, click \"Change Meter Selections.”</li><li> <b>Meter has less than 12 full calendar months of data</b> – 12 full months of calendar data is required for all metrics. A “full month” includes the first and last days of that month. If your bills run from mid-month to mid-month, you will need 13 bills to equal \"12 full calendar months.\"</li><li> <b>Meter has overlaps</b> – An overlap is where the same date is covered by multiple bills.</li><li> <b>Meter has gaps</b> - A gap is where a date(s) is NOT covered by one of your bills.</li></ul><b>Individual monthly meter entry is more than 65 days long</b> (only available for energy meters) - If any of your individual monthly meter entries is over 65 days, then you will not be able to get Weather Normalized Metrics.\n\nAmbulatory Surgical Center\n\nAmbulatory Surgery Centers (ASC) refers to health care facilities that provide same-day surgical care, including diagnostic and preventive procedures. This property type is for stand-alone ASCs that are not located within a Medical Office building.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to offices, operating and recovery rooms, waiting rooms, employee break rooms and kitchens, restrooms, elevator shafts, stairways, mechanical rooms, and storage areas.\n\nAmount of Laundry Processed Onsite Annually\n\nThe Amount of Laundry Processed Onsite Annually is the total quantity of laundry that is processed every year. The quantity is expressed as a weight (e.g., kg) and should be a combined weight reflecting both linen and terry, if appropriate. You should include all laundry processed, including laundry processed on behalf of other businesses (e.g., a hotel serving as a district laundry processing center).<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nApproximate Pool Size\n\nApproximate Pool Size is the size of either indoor or outdoor heated swimming pools. Many pools have unique/nonstandard shapes. You should select the size that is closest to your pool’s size.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nAquarium\n\nAquarium refers to buildings used to provide aquatic habitat primarily to live animals and which may include public or private viewing areas and educational programs. <br /><br />Gross Floor area should include public and restricted areas such as visitor walkways, tank space, retail areas, restaurants, restrooms, laboratories, classrooms, administrative/office space, mechanical rooms, storage areas, elevator shafts, and stairwells. Areas not in enclosed buildings, such as outdoor habitats, open-air theaters, walkways, and landscaped areas <strong><em>should not be</em></strong> included in the Gross Floor Area.\n\nArea of All Walk-in Refrigeration/Freezer Units\n\nThe Area of Walk-in Refrigeration/Freezer Units is the total area of walk-in units at the property. Walk-in Refrigeration/Freezers are large enough for a person to actually walk into. They may or may not have a door, plastic strips, or other flexible covers.\n\nVehicle Dealership\n\nVehicle Dealership refers to buildings used for the sale of new or used light-, medium- and heavy-duty cars and trucks.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including sales floors, offices, conference rooms, vehicle service areas, parts storage areas, waiting rooms, staff break rooms, restrooms, hallways, and stairwells. Gross Floor Area should not include any exterior spaces such as vehicle parking areas.\n\nAverage Effluent Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5)\n\nAverage Effluent Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) is the BOD5 concentration of wastewater after it is treated and is leaving a Wastewater Treatment Plant. The concentration should be an average concentration, estimated over a 12-month period. BOD is the measure of the amount of oxygen required by bacteria for stabilizing material that can be decomposed under aerobic conditions. BOD5 is a commonly used determinant of the organic strength of a waste, recording the oxygen demand over a five-day period. BOD5 should be reported in mg/l.<br /><br />BOD5 is <strong><em>not the same as</em></strong> CBOD5 (carbonaceous biological oxygen demand). To receive an ENERGY STAR score, you must report BOD5, not CBOD5, for your wastewater treatment plant.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nAverage Influent Flow\n\nAverage Influent Flow is the total average daily flow of water through a Water Treatment and Distribution Plant or Wastewater Treatment Plant. Specifically:<br /><ul><li><strong>Water Treatment and Distribution Plants </strong> - This daily flow rate includes all sources of water through the plant, including ground water, surface water, and purchased water. This value is provided via a <a href=\"#PlantFlowRateMeter\">Plant Flow Rate Meter</a>, through which you can update flow rates regularly (quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.).</li><li><strong>Wastewater Treatment Plant</strong> - This value is the average daily flow of wastewater into the plant. It is provided via a <a href=\"#PlantFlowRateMeter\">Plant Flow Rate Meter</a>, through which you can update flow rates regularly (quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.).</li></ul><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nAverage Influent Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5)\n\nAverage Influent Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) is the BOD5 concentration of wastewater when it is entering a Wastewater Treatment Plant to be treated. The concentration should be an average concentration, estimated over a 12-month period. BOD is the measure of the amount of oxygen required by bacteria for stabilizing material that can be decomposed under aerobic conditions. BOD5 is a commonly used determinant of the organic strength of a waste, recording the oxygen demand over a five day period. BOD5 should be reported in mg/l.<br /><br />BOD5 is <strong><em>not the same as</em></strong> CBOD5 (the carbonaceous biological oxygen demand). To receive an ENERGY STAR score, you must report BOD5, not CBOD5, for your wastewater treatment plant.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nAverage Number of Residents\n\nThe Average Number of Residents is the average number of residents that occupied the property for the previous 12 months. Residents should only include those who live at the property, and should not include any employees or any visitors.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nAverage Occupancy\n\nSee <a href=\"#Occupancy\">Occupancy</a>.\n\nAvoided Emissions\n\n<strong>Avoided Emissions</strong> are the emissions benefits associated with green power use. Avoided emissions may be either <strong><em>onsite</em></strong> or <strong><em>offsite</em></strong>.<ul><li><strong>Onsite Avoided Emissions</strong> are the emissions benefits of your onsite renewable system (when you’ve retained the <a href=\"#GreenPower\">Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)</a>) due to the reduction in grid-supplied electricity. It is calculated as the amount of Onsite Green Power you consume multiplied by the non-baseload (marginal) emissions factor of your eGRID subregion.</li><li><strong>Offsite Avoided Emissions</strong> occur when you purchase green power (which come with RECs) from your utility or an independent supplier. Offsite Avoided Emissions also occur in the case of REC arbitrage, a transaction where you sell the RECs associated with your own onsite system and purchase other substitute RECs. In this case, the avoided emissions associated with your green power originate from offsite sources, not your onsite system.</li></ul>\n\nBank Branch\n\nBank Branch refers to a commercial banking outlet that offers banking services to walk-in customers.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including banking areas, vaults, lobbies, atriums, kitchens used by staff, restrooms, conference rooms, storage areas, stairways, and elevator shafts. Drive-thru windows should be included in the open parking lot, not partially enclosed parking.\n\nBar/Nightclub\n\nBar/Nightclub refers to buildings used primarily for social/entertainment purposes, and is characterized by most of the revenue being generated from the sale of beverages instead of food. <br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to standing/seating areas, stage/dressing room areas, food/drink preparation or kitchen areas, retail areas, restrooms, administrative/office space, mechanical rooms, storage areas, elevator shafts, and stairwells. <br /><br />Properties whose primary business revenues are generated from the sale of food should be entered using one of the Restaurant property uses, even if there is a bar.\n\nBarracks\n\nBarracks refers to residential buildings associated with military facilities or educational institutions which offer multiple accommodations for long-term residents.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to bedrooms, restrooms, common areas, food service facilities, laundry facilities, meeting spaces, exercise rooms, health club/spas, lobbies, elevator shafts, storage areas, and stairways.\n\nBasic Property Information\n\nBasic Property Information includes the property name, address, gross floor area, Property IDs, and federal data (if applicable).\n\nBowling Alley\n\nBowling alley refers to buildings used for public or private, recreational or professional bowling.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to bowling lanes, concession areas, party rooms, retail areas, administrative/office space, employee break rooms, restrooms, storage areas, and mechanical rooms.\n\nCampus\n\nA campus is a collection of two or more co-located buildings that function as a single property with a single shared primary function, meaning they collectively serve a common purpose. They are generally owned and operated by the same party. <br><br>To be eligible for ENERGY STAR Certification, certain property types must apply for certification as a campus:<ul><li>In the US there are five property types that earn ENERGY STAR certification as a campus: K-12 School, Multifamily Housing, Hospital, Hotel, and Senior Living Community.</li><li>In Canada, there are seven property types that earn ENERGY STAR certification as a campus: K-12 School, Hospital, Senior Living Community, Ice/Curling Rink, Self-Storage, Hotel, and Multifamily Housing.</li></ul>While the above properties must apply for certification as a campus, you might also want to benchmark individual \"child\" buildings if you have complete building energy data for them.<br><br>For other property types that exist as a campus (such as an office park made up of multiple office buildings, or a lot containing several warehouses), each individual building must be benchmarked and certified individually. This may require sub-metering if multiple buildings share an energy meter.<br><br><a href=\"https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/article/What-constitutes-a-campus-1600088528441\" target=\"_blank\" >This FAQ</a> provides some examples about what constitutes a campus.<br><br>Here's a <a href=\"https://energystar.my.site.com/PortfolioManager/s/topic/0TOt00000008fK9GAI/campuses\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> to all Campus FAQs.\n\nCasino\n\nCasino refers to buildings primarily used to conduct gambling activities including both electronic and live table games. <br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to the main casino floor/gaming area, restaurants/bars, retail areas, administrative/office space, restrooms, mechanical rooms, storage areas, elevator shafts, and stairwells.<br /><br />If your Casino is located in the same building as a hotel, we recommend that you enter a separate hotel property use.\n\nGlossary.CertificateofOccupancy.title\n\nGlossary.CertificateofOccupancy.text\n\nChange in EUI For Energy Projects\n\nChange in EUI for an Energy Project compares the EUI value before and after an energy upgrade (or series of upgrades). You can select the pre- and post- periods you would like to compare. As a default Portfolio Manager will set these periods according to your date of completion. For example, if you have a project with a completion date of March 15, 2011, then your change will compare the EUI for the 12 months before the implementation date of your project (March 2010 to February 2011) to the 12 months after your project (April 2011 to March 2012). Please note that other energy projects and/or changes in operation may have occurred during this time. We do not attempt to estimate the effect of a single energy project controlling for all other changes.\n\nChild Property\n\nSee <a href=\"#PropertyRelationships\">Property Relationships.</a>\n\nClear Height\n\nThe distance measured from the floor to the lowest overhead obstruction for the majority of the warehouse space. This is the height in which goods, products, or materials can be vertically stacked. If the warehouse consists of areas with varying clear heights, use the average of the clear heights.\n\nCollege/University\n\n<br />College/University refers to buildings used for the purpose of higher education. This includes public and private colleges and universities.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to: classrooms, laboratories, offices, cafeterias, libraries, maintenance facilities, arts facilities, athletic facilities, residential areas, storage rooms, restrooms, elevator shafts, and stairways.\n\nCommon Entrance\n\nA common entrance is a door that leads from the exterior of the building to interior common hallways that allows access to all the individual residential units. Typically, the mailboxes and buzzers are located at the common entrance. Buildings can still have individual exterior doors to units as long as there is a common entrance.\n\nCompletely Enclosed Parking Garage\n\nCompletely Enclosed Parking Garage is the total area of a parking structure that is completely enclosed on all four sides and has a roof. This includes an underground parking structure or a fully enclosed structure on the first few stories of a building. Completely Enclosed Parking Garages have lights on and ventilation 24 hours/day, therefore individual private garages in Multifamily Housing are not considered “Parking.”<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nComputer Lab\n\nComputer Lab is entered as either Yes or No.<br /><ul><li><strong>Yes</strong> – Indicates that there is a Computer Lab, which refers to a room or set of rooms specifically designed and equipped with at least 10 computers and associated peripherals, such as printers, for the use of the occupants. Typically, such spaces are separated by walls and doors and have their own temperature and humidity control.</li><li><strong>No</strong> – Indicates that the property does not contain a Computer Lab.</li></ul>If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nCongratulations Letter\n\nIf your application for an ENERGY STAR certification is approved, a Congratulations Letter will be sent to the contact selected during the application process. Included in the letter is information regarding receipt of ENERGY STAR certification.\n\nConnected Contacts\n\nYour “Connected” contacts are those that you’ve made a connection with through Portfolio Manager (similar to “Facebook friends”). Connections are necessary to share your properties with others (either individuals or organizations); you need to be “connected” with them. To make a connection, go to the “Add Contact“ or “Add Organization” page and search for them within Portfolio Manager (they need to have a Portfolio Manager account). Once you find them, send a “Connection” request. After they accept your connection request, they will show up on your list of connected contacts.\n\nConstruction Status\n\nConstruction Status indicates whether your property is:<ul><li>a design project</li><li>an existing operational property</li><li>a test property (one you are using for training or testing new features in Portfolio Manager) </li></ul>You initially select your construction status when you create a property. You can change the construction status on the Details tab, under Basic Information.\n\nContacts for ENERGY STAR Certification\n\nThe application for ENERGY STAR Certification includes several important contacts: <ul><li><strong>Application Primary Contact</strong> is the person we will correspond with if there are any issues with the application. In most cases, this is the person who submits the application online.</li><li><strong>Award Recipient</strong> is the person to whom your ENERGY STAR congratulations letter and ENERGY STAR decal will be mailed.</li><li><strong>Signatory</strong> is the person in the organization, who will sign the final ENERGY STAR application in hard copy, along with the Licensed Professional. This person must be in your Contacts Book, but does not necessarily have to have a Portfolio Manager account.</li><li><strong>Property Manager</strong> is an outside organization that you have hired to manage your facility operations. If your property is managed internally by the property owner, this field will not be applicable. </li></ul>\n\nConvenience Store with Gas Station\n\nConvenience Store with Gas Station refers to buildings that are co-located with gas stations and are used for the sale of a limited range of items such as groceries, toiletries, newspapers, soft drinks, tobacco products, and other everyday items. Convenience Store with Gas Station may include space for vehicle servicing and repair.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to sales floors, restrooms, offices, staff break rooms, storage areas, and vehicle repair areas. Energy use associated with outside areas such as vehicle parking and gas filling areas should be included with the total energy use for the building(s), but the square footage associated with these outdoor areas should <strong><em>not be included</em></strong> in the Gross Floor Area.\n\nConvenience Store without Gas Station\n\nConvenience Store without Gas Station refers to buildings used for the sale of a limited range of items such as groceries, toiletries, newspapers, soft drinks, tobacco products, and other everyday items, which are not co-located with a gas station.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to sales floors, restrooms, offices, staff break rooms, and storage areas.\n\nConvention Center\n\nConvention center refers to buildings used primarily for large conferences, exhibitions, and similar events. Convention centers may include a diverse variety of spaces, including large exhibition halls, meeting rooms, and concession stands. <br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to exhibit halls, preparation and staging areas, meeting rooms, concession stands, offices, break rooms, restrooms, security areas, elevator shafts, and stairwells. Loading dock areas located outside the walls of the building should not be included in the gross square footage. <br /><br />Conference facilities located within a Hotel should be included along with your Hotel property use details, rather than added as a separate Convention Center property use. Conference facilities primarily serving smaller meetings should be entered as Social/Meeting Hall.\n\nCooking Facilities\n\nCooking Facilities is entered as either Yes or No.<br /><ul><li><strong>Yes</strong> – There is a commercial cooking area designed to provide and serve food to occupants and/or visitors. This may include restaurants and cafeterias.</li><li><strong>No</strong> – There is not a commercial cooking area.</li></ul>If your facility contains only employee break room kitchens, this field should be marked No.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nCooling Equipment Redundancy\n\nCooling Equipment Redundancy describes the redundant capacity of the cooling equipment in a Data Center. Redundant cooling equipment is typically required in a Data Center to have backup cooling in case of a cooling equipment failure (not a power outage). The specific level of redundancy will depend on your particular Data Center. Cooling Equipment Redundancy is not required, nor is it factored into any metrics<br /><br />If there are multiple systems operating at different levels of redundancy, choose the option that applies to the majority of the data center cooling load.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nCourthouse\n\nCourthouse refers to buildings used for federal, state, or local courts, and associated administrative office space.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to temporary holding cells, chambers, kitchens used by staff, lobbies, atriums, conference rooms and auditoriums, fitness areas for staff, restrooms, storage areas, stairways, and elevator shafts.\n\nCurrency Type\n\nPortfolio Manager does not currently assign a Currency Type. You should enter the same Currency Type for all of your properties to allow for comparison. As a future enhancement, Portfolio Manager may add a field to specify a Currency Type of either Canadian Dollars or US Dollars, on a property-by-property basis for all of its all financial indicators (e.g. energy cost, water cost, investment in upgrades, etc). Portfolio Manager does not convert between currencies.\n\nCurrent as of\n\n“Current as of” is a date that is pre-populated with January 1st of the year that the building was built. You can edit the date if your “property use details” change. For example, if you change your weekly operating hours on June 1st of the same year your building was built, you would change \"Current as of\" to 6/1/xxxx.\n\nCustom Access\n\nCustom Access allows you to select more granular permissions for each group of information (Property, Meters, Goals, and Recognition). If you are sharing a property with multiple meters, you can even select different permissions for each meter. By default, all selections are set to \"Read Only.\" After you select permissions, you also decide whether you want to give \"Share Forward\" rights, meaning the ability to share the property with others. <br><br>The permissions that you can select are:<ul><li><b>None</b> suppresses access to that specific tab (Meters or Goals) or that specific information (Certification). However, all metrics for the property are still accessible via Reporting. </li><li><b>Read Only</b> provides the ability to view all data, but not edit any data</li><li><b>Full Access</b> provides the ability to add and/or edit any of this data. For example, if you want someone to add meter bills to your property, you would select “Full Access” for that meter. </li></ul> Also see <a href=\"#Permissions\">Permissions</a>.\n\nCustom Property Use Details\n\n<strong>Custom Property Use Details</strong> are metrics for you to track anything that is important to you that isn’t already in Portfolio Manager. For example, schools might want to track “Number of Students”, hotels might want to track “Rooms Sold,” a manufacturing plant might want to track “Number of Widgets Manufactured.” Initially, you will be able to set these metrics individually at the property level on the Details tab. In the future, we expect to roll out functionality to allow you to set the Custom Use Details for your entire portfolio (including buildings shared at full access with you). You will be able to add two Custom Property Use Details for each property. Six new metrics will be available in Reporting: <ul><li>Custom Use Detail 1 - Name</li><li>Custom Use Detail 1 - Value</li><li>Custom Use Detail 1 - Units</li><li>Custom Use Detail 2 - Name</li><li>Custom Use Detail 2 - Value</li><li>Custom Use Detail 2 - Units</li></ul>\n\nData Center\n\nData Center refers to buildings specifically designed and equipped to meet the needs of high density computing equipment, such as server racks, used for data storage and processing. Typically these facilities require dedicated uninterruptible power supplies and cooling systems. Data center functions may include traditional enterprise services, on-demand enterprise services, high performance computing, internet facilities, and/or hosting facilities.<br /><br />Often Data Centers are free standing, mission critical computing centers. When a data center is located within a larger building, it will usually have its own power and cooling systems, and require a constant power load of 75 kW or more. Data Center is intended for sophisticated computing and server functions; it should not be used to represent a server closet or computer training area.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to raised floor computing space, server rack aisles, storage silos, control console areas, battery rooms, mechanical rooms for cooling equipment, administrative office areas, elevator shafts, stairways, break rooms and restrooms. When a data center is located within a larger building, include only the spaces that are uniquely associated with the data center in the gross floor area. For example, do not include spaces shared by the data center and other tenants, such as break rooms or hallways.\n\nData Center - Apply Energy Estimates\n\nApply Data Center Energy Estimates is entered as either <strong>Yes or No.</strong><br /><ul><li>Yes - Estimates for energy consumption will be applied for this data center. Estimates are applied to all data centers in Canada. </li><li>No - IT Energy is metered and entered in Portfolio Manager, and will be used to determine an ENERGY STAR score for this property.</li></ul>\n\nData Center IT Energy\n\nIT Energy is the amount of energy required by the server racks, storage silos, and other IT equipment in the Data Center. IT Energy is a measure of <strong><em>energy</em></strong> (i.e. kWh), it should <b>not</b> be reported as an instantaneous reading of electric demand.<br /><br />IT Energy may be measured at any of 4 locations: <ul><li>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Output (required for a score, in most cases)</li><li> Power Distribution Unit (PDU) Input</li><li> PDU Output</li><li>Server/Equipment Input</li></ul>IT Energy meters permit readings for a user-determined time period (e.g. weekly, monthly, or quarterly). Monthly measurements are recommended, on schedule with utility readings, if possible.<br /><br />In order to receive an ENERGY STAR score, the IT energy must be measured at the UPS Output. However, you may track IT energy at the other measurement locations for your own purposes. A measurement of IT Energy from the UPS Output is consistent with a Category 1 measurement of data center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), as recommended by EPA and other leading organizations. In the following circumstances only, EPA will permit alternate measurement approaches based on the IT configuration: <br /><ul><li>Data Centers that do not have a UPS are permitted to supply readings from the input to the PDU.</li><li>Data Centers for which more than 10% of the UPS load is directed to non-IT (e.g. mechanical) equipment are required to provide a reading that excludes the non-IT equipment. Two options are permitted: <br /><ul><li>If energy used by non-IT equipment is measured, then you can subtract the non-IT energy from the total UPS energy, and enter the remainder into your UPS Output Meter.</li><li>If energy used by non-IT equipment is not measured, then you can supply a reading from the input to the PDU that supports the IT equipment.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\nData Center PUE\n\nData Center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is a measure of Data Center infrastructure efficiency, representing the amount of energy that is needed per unit delivered to IT equipment. It is computed as the total annual source energy divided by the annual IT source energy. A typical PUE value is about 2.0, which indicates that for every kWh that is delivered to IT equipment, an additional kWh is required for cooling, power supply, and infrastructure. PUE is the basis of the ENERGY STAR performance scale for Data Centers. PUE is only available for Stand-alone Data Centers (where the only Property Type is Data Center).\n\nDefault Data Flag\n\nDefault Data Flag is a Yes/No flag that indicates whether default values have been applied to any of the Property Use Details (such as Hours, Workers, or Computers).<ul><li>Yes - One or more default value was used in the Property Use Details.</li><li>No – There are no default values for any Property Use Details.</li></ul>Default values are available for property types that can get a score (in either the US or Canada) and for Property Use Details that are used in the calculation of the score. The default values are derived from the sample population that was used to create each score. <br><br>This was designed to help you get a quick score, when you don’t know the exact values for your Property Use Details. However, you should always go back and enter the actual values for your property to obtain the most accurate score. Note, there is never a default for Gross Floor Area (GFA), because GFA is needed to understand your basic property function and populate other default values. <br><br>Although the US and Canada rely on different national surveys, the same default values (based on the US population) are applied for all properties, regardless of country. <br><br>You can view this metric for all properties in a report, or for each individual Property Use Type on the Details tab.\n\nDegree Days\n\nDegree days measure the amount of heating or cooling necessary at your property. Degree days are measured relative to a base of 65°F(18°C). Above 65°F(18°C) it is assumed that your property will need to have cooling and below 65°F(18°C) it is assumed that your property will need to have heating.<br /><ul><li><strong>Heating Degree Days (HDD) </strong> - HDD is the equivalent number of days you would have to heat your building by 1 degree to accommodate the heating requirement. For example, if you have a day on which the temperature is 55°F degrees, that day is worth 10 Heating Degree Days because it is 10 degrees below 65°F. HDD is calculated in this way for each day of the year and summed up to get the total annual HDD.</li><li><strong>Cooling Degree Days (CDD) </strong> - CDD is the equivalent number of days you would have to cool your building by 1 degree to accommodate the cooling requirement. For example, if you have a day on which the temperature is 80°F degrees, that day is worth 15 Cooling Degree Days because it is 15 degrees above 65°F. CDD is calculated in this way for each day of the year and summed up to get the total annual CDD.</li></ul>\n\nContacts for Designs /Statement of Design Intent (SEDI)\n\nThe application for Designed to Earn the ENERGY STAR includes several important contacts: <br/><ul><li data-subItem=\"1\"><strong>Owner Contact</strong> is the person who represents the property owner. We will correspond with this person if there are any issues with the application. In most cases, this is the person who submits the application online. </li><li data-subItem=\"2\"><strong>Architect of Record</strong> is the organization who designed the property. </li><li data-subItem=\"3\"><strong>Project Architect</strong> is the person who was the main point of contact from the architect firm. </li><li data-subItem=\"4\"><strong>Verifying Professional</strong> – If you are not using the SEDI for Designed to Earn, then you can use someone other than a Project Architect to sign off on the validity of the information. </li></ul>\n\nDesigned to Earn the ENERGY STAR\n\nDesigned to Earn the ENERGY STAR (DEES) recognition is awarded for design projects that meet property type requirements, achieves a 75 or higher ENERGY STAR 1-100 score and account for total annual estimated energy use.\n\nDining Hall\n\nDining Hall is entered as either Yes or No.<br /><ul><li><strong>Yes</strong> – There is a Dining Hall, which refers to special space and equipment in a residential facility that is dedicated to food preparation and service for the residents. This may include bakeries, lunch counters, restaurants, or other commercial food service activities. This <strong><em>does not include</em></strong> student or occupant lounges or galleys that have food-preparation equipment and/or vending machines. </li><li><strong>No</strong> – The property does not contain a Dining Hall. </li></ul>If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nDistribution Center\n\nDistribution Center refers to unrefrigerated buildings that are used for the temporary storage and redistribution of goods, manufactured products, merchandise or raw materials. Buildings that are used primarily for assembling, modifying, manufacturing, or growing goods, products, merchandise or raw material should be classified as Manufacturing Facility.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to space designed to store non-perishable goods and merchandise, offices, lobbies, stairways, restrooms, equipment storage areas, and elevator shafts. This should <strong><em>not include</em></strong> exterior/outdoor loading bays or docks.\n\nDrinking Water Treatment & Distribution\n\nDrinking Water Treatment and Distribution refers to facilities designed to pump and distribute drinking water through a network of pipes. Depending on the water source (ground water, surface water, purchased water), a water utility may or may not contain a treatment process. This property use applies to any/all water sources and any/all levels of treatment.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all areas within the physical structures at the plant, including but not limited to treatment areas, administrative offices, break rooms, restrooms, stairways, hallways and mechanical rooms. The Gross Floor Area should <strong><em>not include</em></strong> any exterior portions of the facility, such as retention or settling ponds.<br /><br />Although not typically used for normalization at plants, Gross Floor Area is a required system input for all properties.\n\nEditing and Updating\n\nIn the action menu for each property, you will find two ways to change your data:<ul><li><b>Correct Mistakes</b> – If you find a mistake or want to finalize an estimated number, this selection takes you to the History Log. Making an edit in the History Log will correct the value, but there will not be a record of this change saved in Portfolio Manager. </li><li><b>Update With New Information</b> – If a change has occurred on your property (for example, your weekly operating hours changed from 40 hours per week to 60 hours per week) you will want to use the Update Use Details page, where you can enter the effective date for this change. Your energy use intensity can be affected by these changes. Portfolio Manager saves a record of all “updates” in the History Log.</li></ul>\n\nElectric Demand\n\nElectric Demand is the rate of using electricity. For most commercial buildings, demand is measured in kilowatts (kW). <b>Demand tracking is optional</b> and does not affect any of your energy metrics.<br><br>Utilities measure the highest rate of using electricity each billing cycle in order to adequately size the generation, transmission and distribution capacity required to provide energy to each customer. The utility then recoups these costs by billing you based on your highest measured demand, and when that demand occurs relative to when the utility experiences peak demand on their system. <br><br>In Portfolio Manager, there are 2 inputs for Demand for Electric Grid Meters: <ul><li><b>Electric Demand (kW)</b> is the highest measured rate of your electricity use for each bill. You should be able to find this rate, measured by kW, on your electric bill. It’s not always called “Electric Demand” though, it could be called: Peak Demand, On-Peak Demand, Load, etc.</li><li><b>Electric Demand Cost ($)</b> is the cost that you are charged for electric demand on each bill. Your bill may have a single value for demand cost, or you may have to add individual demand costs and tariffs explicitly related to electric demand. Demand costs should be a subset of your total electricity cost.</li></ul>There are four Demand metrics that you can add to Custom Reports:<ul><li><b>Annual Maximum Demand (kW) </b> is the highest demand value across all your electric meters and all meter entries covered in the 12-month performance period. It is equal to the highest month’s value measured by one of your meters. It is not a cumulative number. If you have multiple electric meters tracking demand, only one meter’s monthly value will be equal to the Annual Maximum Demand. </li><li><b>Annual Maximum Demand (MM/YYYY) </b> is the month and year within the 12-month period that had the highest demand. </li><li><b>Annual Maximum Demand (Meter Name (Meter ID)) </b> is the name of the meter that had the highest measured demand, and its Meter ID that was assigned by Portfolio Manager when the meter was created. This is only important if you have multiple electric meters tracking demand because you can only get one Annual Maximum Demand per property. </li><li><b>Annual Demand Cost ($)</b> is the <b><u>sum</b> </u> of all demand costs across all months and all meters in the 12-month performance period. Unlike the other demand metrics, cost is a cumulative number. Demand costs are a subset of total electricity costs. </li></ul>\n\nEmissions Factor\n\nThe GHG Emissions of a property are calculated by multiplying Site Energy by the emissions factor for each fuel type.<br><br>For electricity, GHG emissions factors are based on the region of the country where the property is located (using EPA’s Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)). These factors are based on measured power plant data from utility owners and operators.<br><br>For all other fuels, a national emissions factor is used.<br><br>Notes:<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/historical_greenhouse_gas_factors_2000_2022\" target=\"_blank\"> Emission factors from 2000- present</a> are available in Excel</li><li>Full documentation on how emissions are calculated is in our <a href=\"{.}/learnMore?relativePath=/buildings/tools-and-resources/portfolio-manager-technical-reference-greenhouse-gas-emissions\" class=\"es-link\">Technical Reference on Greenhouse Gas Emissions.</a></li><li>There are no emission rates associated with \"Other\" meters. If you have an \"Other\" fuel type meter, you will not get any GHG metrics.</li><li>Properties outside of the US and Canada will use US emissions rates. For electricity, they will use the National Average.</li><li>Properties in Canada have regional emission rates for both electricity and natural gas based on the province. </li></ul>\n\nElectric Distribution Utility (EDU)\n\nYour Electric Distribution Utility (EDU) is the company responsible for the delivery (transmission and distribution) of electricity to your building or campus and is identified on your electric bill. Your property is mapped to its EDU based on the property's zip code.<br><br><b><u>In most properties, the EDU is never used.</b></u> Portfolio Manager determines a property's eGRID subregion (for GHG Emission rates) by mapping its zip code to an eGRID SubRegion. In some cases, a zip code covers more than one eGRID subregion, and in these cases, your electric distribution utility (EDU) is used to determine your eGRID subregion. Since there are only 26 eGRID subregions in the US, chances are good that we'll get your building in the right region, even if your specific Electric Distribution Utility is incorrect.\n\nElectricity Use - Monthly\n\n“Electricity Use-Monthly” is a reporting metric that returns 12 values, one for each month in the specified year, of electricity use summed across all electricity meters. The values are “calendarized” as they are on the chart on the Energy Tab. This metric allows you to retrieve calendarized monthly electricity metrics for multiple properties at once. Select this metric in Reporting, from the “Select Information and Metrics” modal, on the “Energy Use by Fuel Source” tab. The data will appear on a separate tab in your final report.\n\nEnclosed Floor Area\n\nEnclosed Floor Area is the area within a Stadium or Arena that is covered/fully enclosed and can be conditioned. This is a subset of the Gross Floor Area that reflects only areas that are fully enclosed, which may include offices, storage areas, restaurants, and maintenance rooms.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nEnclosed Mall\n\nEnclosed Mall refers to buildings that house multiple stores, often “anchored” by one or more department stores, and with interior walkways. Most stores will not have entrances accessible from outside, with the exception of the “anchor” stores.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to retail stores, offices, food courts, restaurants, restrooms, storage areas, staff break rooms, atriums, walkways, stairwells, and mechanical rooms.\n\nEnergy Cost\n\nWhatever you enter into “Total Cost” for each energy meter gets rolled up into the Energy Cost metrics for the selected 12-month time period. There are energy cost metrics available for each individual energy type (Grid Electricity, Onsite Solar/Wind Electricity, Natural Gas, Fuel Oil (No. 1), ...) and also as aggregated values for all fuel sources combined (Energy Cost, Energy Cost Intensity, and National Median Energy Cost).\n\nEnergy/Power Station\n\nEnergy/Power Station applies to buildings containing machinery and/or associated equipment for generating electricity or district heat (steam, hot water, or chilled water) from a raw fuel, including fossil fuel power plants, traditional district heat power plants, combined heat and power plants, nuclear reactors, hydroelectric dams, or facilities associated with a solar or wind farm.<br /><br />Gross Floor Area should include all space within the building(s), including but not limited to power generation areas (boilers, turbines etc), administrative space, cooling towers, kitchens used by staff, lobbies, meeting rooms, restrooms, cafeterias, stairways, elevator shafts, and storage areas (which may include fossil fuel storage tanks or bins). This should <strong><em>not include</em></strong> any exterior spaces associated with the power stations.\n\nEnergy Rate\n\nThe Energy Rate is the price of energy per unit. For example, the electricity rate might be 11 cents per kilo-watt hour. Natural gas rate might be $13 per million Btu.\n\nEnergy Service Providers\n\nEnergy Service Providers are companies that offer energy services and products to help you improve the energy efficiency of your property.\n\nENERGY STAR Certification\n\nENERGY STAR Certification is awarded to buildings and manufacturing plants that earn a 75 or higher on ENERGY STAR's 1-100 energy performance scale, indicating that the facility performs better than at least 75% of similar buildings nationwide. The ENERGY STAR performance scale accounts for differences in operating conditions, regional weather and climate data, and other important considerations.\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Application Status\n\nThe <em><strong>&quot;ENERGY STAR Certification - Application Status&quot; </strong></em>is in two places in Portfolio Manager, each with slightly different information.<ol><strong><li>In Reporting:</strong> there is a metric&nbsp;&quot;ENERGY STAR Certification - Application Status&quot; that returns the the status of the property&#39;s current application, if there is one in process. It&#39;s not tied to any Period Ending Date because Portfolio Manager doesn&#39;t save the value over time.&nbsp;The possible statuses are below. Note - there is not a status for &quot;Approved&quot; or &quot;Not Approved.&quot; After an application is Approved (or not approved), the status is reset to &quot;Not Available&quot; because there is no longer an application <em>in process</em>.&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Submitted</strong> - Your application has been submitted, but it is not yet under review.</li><li><strong>Under Review </strong>- Your application is under review.</li><li><strong>Escalated to Expert</strong> - Your application has been escalated to a subject matter expert. </li><li><strong>Questions for Applicant</strong> - We emailed you questions about your application. You must respond&nbsp;within 30 days or your&nbsp;application will expire. If you have not received an email from EPA:<ul><li>Review the application submitted, the email goes&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pm/glossary/#ContactsForEnergyStarCertification\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Application Primary Contact&quot;</a></li><li>Check your spam folder for an email from&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:ESCertification@energystar.gov\" target=\"_blank\">ESCertification@energystar.gov</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Revised Application Required</strong> - You are required to submit a revised application.</li><li><strong>Pending Approval </strong>- Your application has been reviewed and is ready to be approved, but for administrative reasons, it cannot be approved until the following calendar year. Watch for an approval notice shortly after the new calendar year begins. This can happen for one of two reasons:<ul><li>Your property has already earned certification in the current calendar year. To confirm this, you can check your property&rsquo;s profile on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=labeled_buildings.locator\" target=\"_blank\">Registry of ENERGY STAR Certified Buildings</a>, your Recognition tab in Portfolio Manager, or your award package.</li><li>Your application was submitted after the deadline to earn certification for the current calendar year (in 2022, that deadline was&nbsp;<strong>December 9</strong>), and thus is only eligible for certification in the following calendar year.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Not Available</strong> - Your property does not have any applications currently in process.</li></ul></li><strong><li>On the Recognition tab:</strong>&nbsp;each individual application for a property has its own&nbsp;status. The possible statuses include all the statuses above, plus these additional ones:<ul><li><strong>Not Submitted - </strong>An application has been started, but it hasn&#39;t been submitted.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li>strong>Approved</strong> - Your application has been approved, but your award decal has not yet been shipped to your property.</li><li><strong>Award Sent </strong>- Your award decal has been sent.</li><li><strong>Expired</strong> - Your application has expired because you did not respond to our questions.</li><li><strong>Not Approved </strong>- Your application was not approved.</li></ul></li></ol>\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Eligibility for Report PED\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Eligibility indicates whether or not your property is eligible for ENERGY STAR certification. Common reasons for not being eligible include: <br /><ul><li>Your property is not able to earn a 1-100 score</li><li>You do not have an ENERGY STAR score of 75 or higher</li><li>You have already earned ENERGY STAR certification within the last 11 months</li><li>Your energy data is more than 120 days old</li></ul>There are two eligibility metrics:<ul><li><b>ENERGY STAR Certification - Eligibility for Report PED</b> - will determine eligibility only for the Period Ending date specified in the report.</li><li><b>ENERGY STAR Certification - Eligibility for all PEDs</b> - will determine eligibility for the property based on all possible PEDs.</li></ul>Note: In order to be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR certification, your building must be located in the US or Canada.\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Last Approval Date\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Last Approval Date is the date that we approved your last application. If your property has not earned certification, no value will display here. <br/><br/>Note: In order to be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR certification, your building must be located in the US or Canada.\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Next Eligible Date\n\nENERGY STAR Certification – Date Next Eligible is the date on which you are next eligible to apply for ENERGY STAR Certification. It is 11 months after the ending date of your last approved application (“For Year Ending: XXX”). For example, if your last certification was for the year ending July 31, 2019, your Date Next Eligible is June 30, 2020. If your property has not earned certification, no value will display here. <br/><br/>Note: In order to be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR certification, your building must be located in the US or Canada.\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Profile Published\n\nProfile Published is a yes/no designation indicating whether a profile for the ENERGY STAR Registry of Certified Buildings has been published for your property. Please note that if your property has not earned certification, no value will display here. <br><br>Note: In order to be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR certification, your building must be located in the US or Canada.\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Year(s) Certified\n\nENERGY STAR Certification - Year(s) Certified is a list of all years for which your property has been certified. <br/><br/>Note: In order to be eligible to earn ENERGY STAR certification, your building must be located in the US or Canada.\n\nENERGY STAR Partner\n\nAn ENERGY STAR Partner is a business or organization who signs a partnership agreement with EPA's ENERGY STAR program and makes a fundamental commitment to protect the environment through the continuous improvement of energy performance.\n\nContacts for ENERGY STAR Reports\n\nThe various ENERGY STAR Reports include several important contacts: <br/><ul><li><strong>Primary Contact</strong> is the main point of contact for the property. This is the person who people would contact with questions about the property. </li><li><strong>Property Owner</strong> is the organization that owns the property/building. </li><li><strong>Licensed Professional</strong> is the person who validates the property information that appears on the report. For ENERGY STAR certification, a Licensed Professional (a Professional Engineer (PE/P.Eng) or a Registered Architect) is required. For more information, see the glossary term for Licensed Professional. </li></ul>\n\nENERGY STAR Score\n\nThe ENERGY STAR Score is a measure of how well your property is performing relative to similar properties, when normalized for climate and operational characteristics.<br /><br />The ENERGY STAR scores are based on data from national building energy consumption surveys, and this allows Portfolio Manager to control for key variables affecting a building’s energy performance, including climate, hours of operation, and building size. What this means is that buildings from around the country, with different operating parameters and subject to different weather patterns, can be compared side-by-side in order to see how they stack up in terms of energy performance. The specific factors that are included in this normalization (Hours, Workers, Climate, etc) will depend on the property type.<br /><br />The 1-100 scale is set so that 1 represents the worst performing buildings and 100 represents the best performing buildings. A score of 50 indicates that a building is performing at the national median, taking into account its size, location, and operating parameters. A score of 75 indicates that a property is performing in the 75th percentile and may be eligible to earn <a href=\"#EnergyStarCertification\">ENERGY STAR Certification</a>.<br /><br />ENERGY STAR Scores are <a href=\"learnMore?relativePath=buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/identify-your-property-type-0\" target=\"_blank\">available for many property types</a>.<br /><br />The 1-100 scale is based on the country in which your property is located. Properties in the US are compared to the national population of properties in the US. Similarly, properties in Canada are compared to the national population of properties in Canada. At this time there are no ENERGY STAR scores specifically developed for other countries. Therefore, properties located in other countries will be compared to the US national population, by default.\n\nEnergy Use by Type\n\nEnergy Use by Type is a summary of the annual consumption of an individual type of energy (e.g. electricity or natural gas). Annual totals are available for every energy type in Portfolio Manager:<ul><li>Electricity (grid, onsite solar, onsite wind); specific metrics include:<ul><li>Electricity Use - Grid Purchase</li><li>Electricity Use - Generated from Onsite Renewable System (the total amount of energy produced from your onsite solar/wind)</li><li>Electricity Use - Generated from Onsite Renewable Systems and Used Onsite</li><li>Electricity Use - Generated from Onsite Renewable Systems and Exported</li><li>Electricity Use - Grid Purchase and Generated from Onsite Renewable Systems (the combined total of all the electricity used by the property, including grid purchases and the solar/wind electricity generated and used onsite.)</li></ul></li><li>Natural Gas</li><li>District Steam</li><li>District Hot Water</li><li>District Chilled Water (electric driven chiller, absorption chiller using natural gas, engine-drive chiller using natural gas, other)</li><li>Propane and liquid propane</li><li>Fuel Oil #1</li><li>Fuel Oil #2</li><li>Fuel Oil #4</li><li>Fuel Oil #5 & #6</li><li>Diesel</li><li>Kerosene</li><li>Wood</li><li>Coal (bituminous and anthracite)</li><li>Coke</li><li>Other</li></ul>\n\nGlossary.WasteUseByType.title\n\nGlossary.WasteUseByType.text\n\nEnergy Use Units\n\nYou can choose from two different setting for the Units you see throughout Portfolio Manager:<ul><li><b>Metric Units</b> – This will apply standard metric units to all values. Standard metric units include square meters for area, joules for energy, kilograms and Metric Tons for emissions, and cubic meters for volumes. For example: <ul><li>EUI will be in gigajoules per square meter (GJ/m2)</li><li>Area will be in square meters (m2)</li><li>Volume of water will be in cubic meters (m3)</li><li>Emissions will be in Kilograms (kg) or Metric Tons (t)</li></ul></li><li><b>EPA Units</b> – The standard units applied by EPA for the most part follow the International System of Units (SI). However, for a few key performance metrics related to emissions, EPA recommends metric units for consistency with common business practices and global protocol. EPA units include square feet for area, British Thermal Units (Btu) for energy, kilograms and Metric Tons for emissions, and gallons for volumes. For example:<ul><li>EUI will be in kBtu/ft2</li><li>Area will be in ft2</li><li>Volume of water will be in kgal</li><li>Emissions will be in Kilograms or Metric Tons</li></ul></li></ul><br/>You can modify your unit preference in Account Settings at any time.<br/><br/>\n\nEnrollment\n\nEnrollment is the total student enrollment for the year (i.e. number of students).<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nEstimated Data Flag\n\nWhen entering bills, you can mark entries as an \"Estimation\" if you've entered any estimated meter entries (for energy, offsite green power, water, or waste). <br><br> In Reporting, under Data Accuracy, you can choose these general metrics for \"Estimated Values\" (energy, offsite green power, water, and waste), and an \"Estimated Data Flag\" for each specific meter type. <ul><li>Yes - A meter(s) includes estimated usage.</li><li>No - There are no estimated meter entries.</li></ul>\n\nEstimated Total Annual Energy Use\n\nA property design does not have any actual energy data, therefore, you need to estimate the property's energy use for metric calculations.\n\nEstimated Savings from Energy Projects\n\nEstimated Savings from Energy Projects is anticipated savings that you estimate for your energy projects. This is a value you will calculate through either engineered assumptions or energy modeling. This value is entered at the start of a project so you can track actual performance before and after the upgrade. When computed at the property level, this metric will sum the Estimated Savings from Energy Project across all individual projects that you have entered for the property.\n\nEUI\n\nEUI stands for Energy Use Intensity. It is the energy use per square foot at a property (energy divided by square foot). EUI enables you to compare different sized buildings.<br><br>There are many versions of EUI in the metrics:<ul><li><a href=\"#SiteEnergy\"> Site EUI </a>.</li><li><a href=\"#SourceEnergy\"> Source EUI</a></li><li>Weather Normalized Site EUI </li><li>Weather Normalized Source EUI </li><li>Site EUI - Adjusted to Current Year </li><li>Source EUI - Adjusted to Current Year </li><li>National Median Site EUI </li><li>National Median Source EUI </li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3wbcxhHdHk&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" >Watch our 3 minute video of EUI</a>.\n\nElectric Vehicle Charging Stations\n\nMany commercial buildings have Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations, and many of them are not separately metered. Since the purpose of Portfolio Manager is to access the energy efficiency of the building, we want to exclude the energy used to charge electric vehicles when benchmarking the building. If your EV chargers are not separately metered, you can apply an energy estimate for your EV charging equipment which will be subtracted from your total energy use (similar to how parking is handled).<br><br>The following information is used to estimate a building’s EV charger energy:<br><ul><li><b>The number of Level One EV Charging Stations.</b> Level one chargers are smaller charging units that usually come with the vehicle itself, and plug into a standard 120VAC outlet. Outlets that are specifically dedicated to EV charging may count as a Level One EV charger. Level One Charging Stations can be counted as the number of vehicles which can be simultaneously charged with a property’s Level One Charging infrastructure.</li><li><b>The number of Level Two EV Charging Stations.</b> Level two chargers are higher voltage chargers that must be purchased separately from the vehicle, which must be plugged into a 240VAC outlet. Most public charging stations are level two. Level Two Charging Stations can be counted as the number of vehicles which can be simultaneously charged with a property’s Level Two Charging infrastructure.</li><li><b>The number of DC Fast EV Charging Stations.</b> Level three chargers are the highest voltage chargers available, and not typically found in most locations given the demand of electrical infrastructure. These offer the quickest way to charge an electric vehicle, and as opposed to level one and level two chargers which utilize AC (alternating current), DC Fast charging uses DC (direct current). DC Fast Charging Stations can be counted as the number of vehicles which can be simultaneously charged with a property’s DC Fast Charging infrastructure.</li></ul>\n\nExchange Data\n\nExchange Data allows you to select an organization (which is registered to use web services) to exchange data with your Portfolio Manager account. You will be able to specify specific permissions regarding whether the organization will be able to view or modify property, building, and meter level information. You will also decide if you want to grant \"Share Forward” rights, meaning the ability to share the property with others. <ul><li>Note: When sharing to exchange data, you may also be required to provide additional information to the organization so that they can process your request to exchange data with Portfolio Manager. </li></ul>Also see <a href=\"#Permissions\">Permissions</a>.\n\nExchanging Data\n\nPortfolio Manager has been designed to allow third-party organizations to electronically sync data with your account. You can authorize companies that exchange data with Portfolio Manager to update your meters, manage building data, and retrieve metrics. To get started, search for organizations that exchange data. Then connect with them and share your properties and meters. <a href=\"/webservices/home/\" target=\"_blank\" >More information about exchanging data via web services. </a>\n\nExterior Entrance to the Public\n\nExterior Entrance to the Public is entered as either Yes or No.<br /><ul><li><strong>Yes</strong> – The store has an exterior entrance through which customers enter from the outside.</li><li><strong>No</strong> – There is no exterior entrance available to the public. Patrons must enter through an interior entrance, such as from within a mall or an atrium in a mixed use establishment.</li></ul>Note that a retail store must have an Exterior Entrance to the Public in order to be eligible to receive the ENERGY STAR.<br /><br />If your property is in the design phase, use your best estimate for the intended conditions when the property is fully operational.\n\nFast Food Restaurant\n\nFast Food Restaurant, also known as Quick Service Restaurant, refers to buildings used for the preparation and sale of ready-to-eat food.

GHG emissions are expressed in <i><b>carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)</i></b>, a universal unit of measure that combines the quantity and global warming potential of each greenhouse gas. Emissions are reported in four categories, each is available as a total amount in metric tons (Metric Tons CO2e) or as an intensity value in kilograms per square foot (kgCO2e/ft2): <br /><br /><ul><li><strong>Direct Emissions</strong> – Direct Emissions are emissions associated with onsite fuel combustion (e.g. combustion of natural gas or fuel oil).</li><li><strong>Indirect Emissions</strong> – Indirect Emissions are emissions associated with purchases of electricity, district steam, district hot water, or district chilled water. These emissions occur at your utility’s plant, but they are a result of your property’s energy consumption and therefore contribute to your overall GHG footprint. Indirect Emissions are calculated using two different methods:<uL><li><b>Indirect (Location-Based) GHG Emissions</b> uses a regional emissions factor for electricity, and national factors for district fuels. Onsite Green Power has zero emissions, but Offsite Green Power is treated as regular grid electricity.</li><li><b>Indirect (Market-Based) GHG Emissions </b>calculates both Onsite and Offsite Green Power as zero emissions. You can also optionally enter a custom emissions factor for the energy that you purchase (the factor is often documented in a contract with the energy provider).[Coming Spring 2024]</li></ul></li><li><strong>Total GHG Emissions</strong> – Total GHG Emissions is the sum of Direct Emissions and Indirect Emissions. Since there are two versions of Indirect Emissions, there are two versions of Total GHG Emissions: <uL><li><b>Total (Location-Based) GHG Emissions</li><li>Total (Market-Based) GHG Emissions</b> [Coming Spring 2024]</li></ul></li><li><strong>Biomass Emissions</strong>– Biomass Emissions are emissions associated with biogenic fuels such as wood or biogas (captured methane). The only biomass fuel currently available in Portfolio Manager is wood. Biogenic fuels are combusted onsite, <b>but do not contribute to Direct or Total Emissions.</b></li></ul>Also see <a href=\"#AvoidedEmissions\">Avoided Emissions</a>.\n\nGuiding Principle 1.5 Integrated - Commissioning\n\nThe Sustainable Buildings Checklist evaluates sustainability in existing buildings.
