        "text": "Our story begins much earlier than the year when the ''Zillion Film'' officially started, on February 22, 1996..Â A series of acting performances in the theater and on film screen inÂ Lazar Ristovski'sÂ career led this actor to tell a story in his way â to write it, play it and direct it. Production as an indispensable part of every film creation represents an important step in the story in order to tell it the way Lazar conceived. That is how we came up with the idea of a production house. It became clearer in time what is needed for the establishment of this film house, where and how to start it, whom to rely on, how to realize all the plans â¦ In the process of the entire organization and towards the very end, one crucial thing was unintentionally left out â the name of the production house. At that moment, two boys, Petar and Jovan, the sons of Lazar and Danica Ristovski, without telling anyone about it, decided to take this task upon themselves. Inspired by a cartoon in which a boy with a âzillion-dollar accountâ gives his money for the opening of a company, Petar and Jovan made a signboard, and by accidentally mistaking Cyrillic and Latin letters they ended up creating a 3illion film (Zillion film).Â 3illion film (Zillion film).\n\nIn 1999, the filmÂ \"The White Suit\" had its world premiere in Cannes, numerous festival performances and awards, especially in Serbia. All the recognitions of Lazar Ristovski, as a director, encouraged him to continue with his filmmaking and decide that acting becomes one of, and not the only means of practicing this art. He decides to use his acting tools equally well in the profession of producer.\n\nFor him, each new film represents a challenge that brings with it passion, excitement, adventure, an opportunity to convey important messages to the world around him, all in an attempt to become better than he currently is. Inspired by the events of that time, in an unpretentious, above all intimate and poetic way, The White Suit talks about the cruelty of the moment in which we lived, and in which we may still be living.\n\nThe energy, stubbornness and depressed optimism of the main character Ensign Sava, interpreted by Ristovski, at the same time largely depicted the beginning of a much bigger story today, and then absolutely unimaginable - Zillion film.\n\nDuring 2006, a film was created TOMORROW MORNING is made, which pushes the limits of the Cinema of Serbia at the time, respecting the rules of the Dogme 95 manifesto for the first time in Serbia. With an emphasis on directorial focusing, documentary style, neatness, hand-held cameras and with the omission of optical processing and time-geographic distances, the absolute integration of the audience has been achieved. Along with this artistic step within Zillion, our story almost inconspicuously acquires a new dimension of creativity â the then student of the first year of film and television directing, Petar Ristovski, who for the first time officially participates in the making of the film âThe OptimistâAlong with the role of a video control operator, he performs various technical tasks, spending all his time on the movie set and learning about every part of this world. This has further influenced the change of his preconceptions about the creative process â that a good film is a matter of coincidence and good luck, that the goal of a director and creator in general is not to make the best film at all costs, but with the minimum of compromise to create the best possible in the given circumstances and time frames. During this process, he is learning how talent is actually the ability to overcome every possible obstacle. Therefore the full growth is visible only after the completion of the whole process. The words of Orson Wels: âThe enemy of art is the absence of limitationsâ are those that characterize the beginning of Petarâs film career, while working on this film in the Zillion film company, laid the foundations of his further professional growth. At that point, he comes to a resolution that will affect not only his but also our story â the director has to be trusted by all other authors; He needs to be stubborn in his own intentions and at the same time free of pride and vanity. He reveals how he wants to create stories about people of importance to him, and the reason for this should be familiar and clear, by showing the essence so that every action in the storyline is a small step closer to that essence.\n\nFifteen years from the founding of the Zillion, Lazar Ristovski decides to direct a film for the second time in his career and tell a story of the working class and his parents who belonged to it. Therefore, he dedicates this film to them. Lazarâs growing up and becoming acquainted with the life of workers was the reason to show how their position was equal to a tiny screw in the complex system of the working mechanism. At the time, Serbia is already going through a transition process that brings privatization accompanied by the closing of many factories. The workers begin to lose their jobs massively, and the atmosphere in the country experiencing transition feels like the story of a âsmallâ man, a member of the working class and his inevitable struggle for his dreams and freedom that belongs to him, which the White Lions portray.Thanks to this film, the horizon and capacity of Zillion are continually growing, which is significantly influenced by the cooperation with other production houses. With the Croatian co-production, White lions once again demonstrate the success of the joint work of regional artists, from Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. The films that weâve made since are the result of numerous co-productions which additionally enriched our work.\n\nRegional cooperation continues withÂ National hero Ljiljan Vidic'sÂ iÂ ON THE OTHER SIDEÂ which have achieved festival success and numerous awards. The fact thatÂ ON THE OTHER SIDEÂ was premiered at 66th Berlin Film Festival, where it was awarded by a jury with the Europa Cinemas Label, testifies to the success achieved. That same year, another one of our films is created - theÂ TRAIN DRIVER'S DIARYÂ directed by Milos Radovic. Tragically-humorous melodrama introduces train drivers to the audience by showing their specific way of life, and the fact that every train driver accidentally kills 20 to 30 people, thus becoming a victim of their victims â those committing suicides, drunken or simply absent people. In the production of this film, the contribution is again provided by Petar Ristovski, but in the most responsible and significant way so far- as the second unit director.\n\nThe very making of the movie meantlovercoming many obstacles that were present to the very endÂ - the lack of money and time made this film process extremely uncertain. Nevertheless, the persistence and determination to present a specific, never before told human story of railroad workers, resulted in that film being Zillion's most awarded film.Â At the time of the premiere, it was clear that the Train Driverâs Diary was going to become a particularly important step in both our and wider filmmaking â the World Premiere at the Moscow Festival brings the Audience Choice Award, and the Serbian premiere â the Cinema City Award for Contribution to the Cinema of Serbia. That same year, Lazar Ristovski receives âThe Golden Iguanaâ -the Lifetime Achievement Award in Mexico, while Milos Radovic wins the title of the Best Director at the âWinter Film Awardsâ Festival in New York and the Jaipur Film Festival in India. They are followed by a special award for Best Film at the Balkan Film Festival, Golden Star for Best Feature Film in Uruguay; Grand Prix for Best Actor, Golden Eagle for contribution to European film art at the International Film Festival in Prague, Audience Choice Award in Portland, Golden Arena for Best Director in Pula, as well as the Young Cinephile Award for Best Minority Co-Production â¦ Numerous acclaims and participation in national and international festivals with this film encouraged and inspired us to create even more exciting film stories.\n\nThe powerful impression left by the film Train driverâs Diary is present in the year that followed. At the same time, an accident happens in which the Cultural Center in Ravno Selo, where Lazar Ristovski was born, is destroyed in a fire. It is precisely at that place, the wreckage of the Cultural Center, that we decide to premiere our, the then last film, in order to encourage potential donors to collect money for the destroyed Center. A mixture of positive and negative impressions provoked a decision to launch an initiative to rebuild it. Shortly after, the idea and intention regarding the reconstruction of the Center are extended â the first film festival in Ravno Selo (Ravno Selo Film Festival) is created , dedicated to young people with a message that culture is not found only in big cities. This celebration of culture is contributed by professional regional artists who introduced the world of film to the participants through a variety of workshops and accompanying program activities.\n\nIn line with our goal, we have devised a wide range of categories of film debuts, which include amateurs and professionals alike. Regardless of whether the film is a short one, recorded by phone or feature-length and with a more serious production, all authors together with us as part of the whole organization contributed to this village coming to life. Over 10,000 people visited the festival in the past two years, and the construction plan of the Cultural Center began its realization - the project documentation was handed over to AP Vojvodina, which will give subsidies for the building of the new Center. In the meantime, we are trying to achieve for Ravno selo festival to become more widely known and more important in order for young people to accept responsibility for maintaining and developing the culture of their hometowns, villages or cities.\n\nIn 2018, we are faced with great challenges that make this year the most productive to date; there are three films, three minority co-productions: What a country, Leeches, Between Day and Night and the most complex production project for Zillion â a film that we have been waiting for seven years and which took a hundred days to shoot. We are given an opportunity to tell the story of our country, our history and an event that has been emotionally attached to the Serbian people, the debut film by Petar Ristovski â King Petar the First . This historical drama, based on the motifs of the novel âKing Petarâs Socksâ by Milovan Vitezovic, speaks of the epic suffering of Serbia in the First World War and the victory of the small nation over the great power.Â Respecting historical facts, director Ristovski has emotionally upgraded the story of the king and his people by creating layered characters â heroes, victims and freedom fighters, those fighting for both, their own and the freedom of their country. King Petar, played by Lazar Ristovski, is portrayed as a brave man, in constant struggle with his doubts and fears, as a living man with a clear idea of freedom, and not as an untouchable and distant icon.\n\nThe rest of the cast including Milan Kolak, Danica Ristovski, Ivan Vujic, Radovan Vujovic and others, equally and in every aspect of their artistic achievement, emotionally revive historical characters and their inner battles, imbued with dignity, honor, honesty and heroic resolve. In the year when we are celebrating the Armistice Day, we jointly delivered a story of freedom and a nation that managed to save itself. With the hope that this film will restore collective memory of the most dreadful and brightest moments of Serbian history as well as give new generations an insight into historical moments of decision-making, persistence, sacrifice and love for the country which enabled them to exist, we worked devotedly to create a film that would be a historical testimony to our science , culture and art.\n\nMovie \"Leeches\"\n\nIt was a time of great social and political crisis in Serbia. Petar MiriÄ, the writer, used a local tv station to represent his personal attitudes that contradict the principles of President MiloÅ¡eviÄ and his political regime. Petar's close encounter with the organ of State Security- Stjepan Å troha raised suspicion in the honesty of his closest friends. Life in paranoia compelled him to seek for the truth. Set of mysterious circumstances introduced him with the symbol of circular lines inscribed in triangles. With his limited knowledge of semiotics, Petar followed the lead left by an unknown girl and searched for an answer in mathematical formulas and theories. He secretly fell in love with the daughter of his new acquaintance, unknown girl from before- Margareta. That chain of events opened a love triangle, in which Petar's longtime lover- a clever woman, called Svetlana, also took place. The triangle of love, passion and mystery dragged him into the world of closely guarded Jewish secrets. Using manipulative methods, Margareta forced him to make more strongly pressure in the media, which resulted in a physical attack on him, demolition of tv studio and, eventually, murder of his acquaintance, the painter- JaÅ¡a the Jew. Having found out that Stjepan Å troh and Svetlana killed JaÅ¡a, he hid himself at Margareta's place and she revealed him the truth about the ''opening triangles''. As a public figure, Petar was a puppet, used by secret services. Using an old tape recorder, he revealed his hidden Jewish background.\n\nPetar starts a new life in Canada, with a professorship at University. Margareta joined him. After one of his classes, he recognized Å troh in the mass of students. He frantically wanted to escape, but Margareta had a plan. In the series of professional ''cleanings'', Å troh died under the wheels of a truck. Å troh's co-worker, called Vesna, also died- she fell from the window of a multistoried building. Petar set up a murder of Svetlana, who was hit with the bullet while having sex with him. Margareta became agent of MOSSAD (Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations).\n\nMovie \"What a country!\"\n\nThe film consists of three stories, and during its course, we found out about structure and interrelationships. The main characters are the general, who has a strong desire to commit a suicide, the minister in the Government of the Republic of Croatia, who imprisoned himself without an official judgement and a group of parents of different nationalities (Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian) who want to force the Governments of Croatia and Serbia to find their children lost in a war, by digging the graves of their dead presidents.\n\nMovie \"Neverending past\"\n\nThree stories about a father and a son in three time periods: the end of World War II, during the fall of Berlin Wall and after Yugoslavia breakdown.\n\nIn each of these stories, father and son find themselves in characteristic, borderline situations, in which they begin to question their own existence.\n\nDecisions they are forced to make will change their lives forever.\n\nThe movie \"The Name of the People\"\n\nSvetozar MiletiÄ was a distinguished lawyer, a member of the Hungarian Parliament and a lifelong fighter for the rights and independence of Serbs in Austro-Hungarian Vojvodina. After he was politically condemned several times, his fight is continued by his daughter, the first female journalist in Serbia - Milica MiletiÄ and JaÅ¡a TomiÄ, MiletiÄ's successor in the Serbian People's Free-Minded Party, who will declare the annexation of Vojvodina to the Kingdom of Serbia in 1918. This is the story of them and their fight.\n\nThe movie \"A Blue Flower\"\n\nA Blue Flower is a film about a woman, a mother and a daughter, and at its center is the middle-aged Mirjana, an employee in a thread factory in Zagreb. On the day of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of work, Mirjana's meetings and conversations with her relatives illuminate parts of her life: the one behind her, the one leading and the one yet to come. A Blue Flower speaks about family, love, selfishness and loneliness, and it evokes emotional associations and encourages us to take a long look at ourselves.\n\n\"Dream Team\" series\n\nDREAM TEAM is a 14-episode comedy series intended for broadcast on Sunday evenings.\n\nPartly created based on the unverified biography of star Maradona, the famous Inget, the TV series DREAM TEAM is the story of the not very successful football player Ilija Ika SrdiÄ and his team of 11 sons.\n\nEach episode of the series will tell one funny story from the life of this large football family, this unusual football team. At the very beginning of the series, \"BULBUDERAC\" (the name of this brotherly team) performs in the zone competition, but with a great ambition enter the Second League one day, then the First, and even the Champions League! Unfortunate that he was never a good footballer, Ika passionately teaches his sons to become top footballers. Our series will fulfill his wish, in the end!\n\nEach episode is a story in itself, and the central thread that connects all episodes is the progress of Ika's family club on the football map of Serbia and the region.\n\n\"BULBUDERAC\" is located in Zvezdara forest, there is a small field, a house where everyone lives together, around twenty of them, a dilapidated tavern with a garden, a barbecue. The club mainly supports itself from this bar, as Ika is a better barbecue master than a coach. The field is meticulously arranged because Ika takes great care of the grass. The playground looks more like a tennis field than a football field.\n\nThis isolated place in the forest is also the main location of all the stories of the series. Most of them take place on the field, around it, in a bar, in a dressing room, in a small house.\n\nEach episode has its main characters (Ika, his 11 sons, mother Ciga, hundred-year-old Grandfather DrakÄe) but many interesting guest characters will also appear in each episode.\n\nThe task of this series is to be easy, funny, fast, to tell a romantic story about the hopes, desires and ideals of ordinary, simple people in a humorous way.\n\n\"Dream Team\" is a contemporary series. No matter how much they hate and argue, strong bonds of love bind the members of Ikaâs family. A pillar of discord but also a pillar of love and tranquility is the main character of the series Ika SrdiÄ."
