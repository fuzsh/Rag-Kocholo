        "text": "Richard Curtis is to make his first Christmas film since Love Actually, which was released over 20 years ago.\n\nThat Christmas, an animated film, stars Succession’s Brian Cox as Santa and will be released on Netflix later this year.\n\nIt will also feature the voices of Bill Nighy, who starred in Love Actually; Fiona Shaw from Killing Eve and Jodie Whittaker, former Doctor Who. The actors play the residents of a charming Suffolk seaside town where things get turned upside down one Christmas.\n\nCurtis is best known for his romantic comedies including Four Weddings And A Funeral, Notting Hill and About Time – and adapted the new story from his children’s book series.\n\nEd Sheeran has also revealed that he has written and recorded a new original song for the film called Under The Tree.\n\nSheeran said he has been friends with Curtis “for years”, having previously appeared in the music film Yesterday – and the two have carried out charity work together.\n\nThe singer, 33, added: “He came to me two years ago to play me the rough of That Christmas. It was just sketches and voices, but it blew me away.\n\n“So emotional, yet so heartwarmingly funny, like all Richard Curtis movies. I find since having kids, there’s a real lack of great animated children’s Christmas movies, so I thought this was such an amazing thing to make and put into the world.\n\n“The scene that we wrote this song for is so heartbreaking, but so real for many people at Christmas, spending it without the ones they love, for so many reasons.\n\n“I got to work with my older brother on this which is such a rarity and a gift to work so closely with my only sibling. It felt so good to create something my children would watch, with their uncle, based in the country they live in.\n\n“I find it mad that there isn’t more animated Christmas films for kids, but this is going to become a holiday staple, at least in our household.\n\n“Hope everyone loves it, and enjoys the song, we had such a great time creating it.”\n\nSheeran has provided the music for Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit film series, The Fault In Our Stars, Game Of Thrones and Ted Lasso.\n\nHe also had a festive-themed chart-topper with Sir Elton John, Merry Christmas, in December 2021 – and the two also appeared on Sausage Rolls For Everyone with LadBaby, the YouTuber, which was that year’s Christmas number one.\n\nCurtis said: “I’m so thrilled to have Ed’s beautiful song in our movie.\n\n“It’s a film set in Suffolk ... Ed lives in and loves Suffolk and completely understood the pitch and tone of what we were trying to do.\n\n“We’ve been friends for many years and – especially now that he’s a husband and a father – it’s really lovely to have him play such a key part in this film about love, children and family.\n\n“And, of course, even if he wasn’t a friend and didn’t love Suffolk, how marvellous to have a wonderful new song by one of the greatest British songwriters ever.”\n\nSheeran, who has two daughters with wife Cherry Seaborn, lives near Framlingham in Suffolk where he grew up.\n\nHe is also a big supporter of Ipswich Town, the county’s football club, and even sponsors their shirts. In 2015, the singer received a degree from University Campus Suffolk (UCS) for his “outstanding contribution to music”.\n\nThat Christmas is directed by Simon Otto, who also animated How To Train Your Dragon, and includes a score from composer John Powell, too.\n\nPowell received Bafta nominations for films including Happy Feet and How To Train Your Dragon.\n\nThat Christmas will air on Netflix later this year."
