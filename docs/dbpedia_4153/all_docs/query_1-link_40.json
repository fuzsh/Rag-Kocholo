        "text": "The EU-supported Serbian film Impure Blood – Sin of Ancestors will be available on the Netflix platform from this month. This is considered a huge recognition for Serbian cinematography and it opens up opportunities for its visibility at a global level. The news that the film will be shown on Netflix has aroused great interest from both experts and the general public in Serbia.\n\nThe creation of the film was supported by the Creative Europe programme for the development of film art. The production company received €160,000 in European funds as financial support for the development and realisation of four projects, including this film. As part of their commitment to promoting Serbian cultural heritage, the Delegation of the European Union to Serbia also supported the film’s promotional campaign.\n\n“It is a great source of pride that the first Serbian movie available on Netflix has been supported by the European Union. The EU is a strong promoter of culture and cultural diversity, and we want to make Serbian culture more present and recognised across Europe and the world.\n\n“From 2014 to 2020, 141 Serbian artists and creative industries benefited from grants from the EU programme Creative Europe, and I am very glad that Serbia has recently become part of the new seven-year cycle of the EU programme,” said Emanuele Giaufret, EU Ambassador to Serbia."
