        "text": "The \"Art of Love\" is a Turkish film with English audio and subtitles. It features Esra Bilgiç as Alin and Birkan Sokullu as Güney. These two main characters bring this film together as a romantic interest. It is a perfect romantic comedy along with some thrilling aspects.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAfter tracking down this one person who was stealing priceless artwork, Alin is an Interpol police officer with a focus on art crimes. As it turns out, she hasn't spoken to her ex-fiance Güney in years. She was devastated when he abandoned her for six months without saying anything, and her entire life fell apart upon seeing him again. This increased her desire to catch him as the art thief. Güney is a billionaire, so it was hard to make sense of why he would steal artwork. Her partner Ozan (Ushan Çakir) helped her develop a strategy. This film was like a cat and mouse chasing. It has a thrilling aspect that is similar to the American film Lift.\n\nHighs\n\nThe action scenes in this film with Alin are its highlights; they were spectacular and gave her character the impression of being a formidable Interpol police officer. On the other side, Alin and Güney's romantic interest is ideal since, in their minds, it conveys how much they have missed one another. There was a moment when it seemed like they were in love, which made it hard for Alin to follow through on her plan. There is a plot twist at the very end of the movie, which is exciting and thrilling.\n\nThe acting was superb, especially that of Esra Bilgiç, who played a very emotional role at the start by flashing back to when she had lost Güney. It's evident that she was devastated and gave her all to her career as an Interpol agent. However, given that Birkan Sokullu is a cunning art thief who is difficult to apprehend, his acting is excellent. It was difficult to understand his true motivation for taking the artwork because he is cunning and mysterious. In addition, the setting of the film was beautiful because it was based in Turkey and Prague. Another high was the action within this film towards the end; it was thrilling.\n\nLows\n\nThe lack of background information regarding Alin and Güney's relationship was one of the film's bad points. Although the flashback was brief and gave little insight into their real relationship, it was nonetheless pleasant to have. While there were some exciting moments in the movie, there were also those parts where it was obvious what would happen. Something was lacking, such as a more significant story twist that occurred in the middle of the film. More scenes involving the other characters and their actions, such as Güney's team members, would have improved the film. They ought to have been more interested, but they weren't.\n\nVerdict\n\nThis film was thrilling and romantic at the same time. It is a perfect film to watch if people are looking for international films.\n\nRating 6.5 out of 10"
