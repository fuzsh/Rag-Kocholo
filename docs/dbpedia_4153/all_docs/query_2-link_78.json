        "text": "The Origin of Closed Captioning\n\nIt took 44 years since the invention of the television to add closed captioning to programs. The idea to make television accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing didn’t even sprout until 1970.\n\nIn 1972, at Gallaudet University, ABC and the National Bureau of Standards presented the technology necessary to make television accessible with captions.\n\nIt was revolutionary.\n\nLater that year, captions were debuted for the first time to the public on Julia Child’s show, “The French Chef.”\n\nLike a waterfall effect, captions started to appear on television, and by the turn of the century, closed captions had become a legal mandate for television.\n\nWhat Is Closed Captioning?\n\nClosed captions are a textual representation of the audio within a media file. They make video accessible to deaf and hard of hearing by providing a time-to-text track as a supplement to, or as a substitute for, the audio.\n\nWhile the text within a closed caption file is comprised predominantly of speech, captions also include non-speech elements like speaker IDs and sound effects that are critical to understanding the plot of the video.\n\nClosed captions are usually noted on a video player with a CC icon.\n\nTypes of Closed Captions\n\nBy now, you know what captions are. But how are they different from subtitles? And how are subtitles different from Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing?\n\nLet’s explore.\n\nThere’s a big difference between closed captioning vs subtitles, even though they are often used interchangeably.\n\nClosed captions assume the viewer cannot hear. They are often dictated with a CC icon on video players and remotes.\n\nSubtitles, on the other hand, are for hearing viewers who don’t understand the language of the audio. Their purpose is to translate the spoken audio into the viewer’s language.\n\nUnlike captions, subtitles do not include the non-speech elements of the audio (like sounds or speaker identifications). Subtitles are also not considered an appropriate accommodation for deaf and hard of hearing viewers.\n\nCaptions vs Subtitles\n\nCaptions assume the viewer cannot hear. They are time-synchronized text of the audio content and include non-speech elements like noises.\n\nSubtitles assume the viewer can hear but doesn’t understand the language. Subtitles translate the audio into another language and don’t include non-speech elements.\n\nIn the United States, the distinction between closed captions and subtitles is important. However, in other countries – like in Latin America – closed captions are called subtitles.\n\nSubtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH), on the other hand, assume the viewer cannot understand the language and cannot hear.\n\nEssentially, SDH subtitles combine the information conveyed by closed captions and subtitles – including critical non-speech elements.\n\nClosed Captioning vs. Open Captions\n\nThe difference between closed captioning vs open captioning is based on user control.\n\nOpen captions are burned into the video and don’t give the user the control to toggle the captions on or off.\n\nAlternatively, closed captions are added to a video as a “sidecar file” – they are a separate asset from the video.\n\nWhen you order a file for encoding you can choose between closed captions or open captions.\n\nOpen Captions vs. Closed Captions\n\nOpen captions are burned into the video, cannot be turned off, and are used for offline or social media video. Closed Captions are published as a sidecar file, can be turned on or off by the user, and are used for online video.\n\nClosed caption encoding allows the user to turn the captions on or off on offline videos. Open caption encoding burns the captions into the video, and whether the video is published online or offline, users can’t turn the captions off.\n\nThe easiest way to create open captions is to hire a professional captioning company that offers open caption encoding. Open caption encoding can be tricky to do yourself. It can be time-consuming and often requires expensive video software.\n\nYou may be wondering, why would someone want to use open captions?\n\nOpen captions are useful when video players don’t accept sidecar files. They are also helpful for social media. Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, don’t allow users to upload a separate closed caption file. As a result, companies use open captions to ensure users are always in-the-know and their videos are accessible.\n\nOther social media platforms like Facebook opt to autoplay videos on silent. Instead of having users scroll past a video, using open captions will help to quickly capture a viewer’s attention. In fact, Facebook uncovered that adding captions to videos increased view time by 12%!\n\nWatch the Quick Start to Captioning webinar below!\n\nAll About Caption Quality\n\nWhy does closed caption quality matter?\n\nWell, if you turn on the automatic captions on a video, then compare what is being said in the video with what is in the captions, you’ll probably notice a large discrepancy.\n\nSometimes the captions don’t make sense at all.\n\nFor a deaf or hard-of-hearing viewer, this can be very frustrating.\n\nClosed caption quality matters because closed captions are meant to be an equivalent alternative to video for individuals with hearing loss. When closed captions are inaccurate, they are inaccessible.\n\nCaption Quality\n\nReadable\n\nDo not obstruct important content in video\n\nInclude speaker labels\n\nAt least 99% accurate\n\nFollow DCMP, FCC, and/or WCAG standards\n\n3Play Media best practices for caption quality\n\nWhat is 99% Accuracy?\n\nThe industry standard for closed caption accuracy is a 99% accuracy rate.\n\nAccuracy measures punctuation, spelling, and grammar.\n\nA 99% accuracy rate means that there is a 1% chance of error or leniency of 15 errors total per 1,500 words.\n\nSo, what happens if you have a lower accuracy rate?\n\nStudies have shown that even a 95% accuracy rate is sometimes insufficient to accurately convey complex material. For a typical sentence length of 8 words, a 95% word accuracy rate means there will be an error, on average, every 2.5 sentences.\n\nMost automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies have an accuracy rate of 80%.\n\nKnowing how a captioning vendor measures its accuracy rate is important. For example, with some closed captioning vendors, punctuation errors are subjective; even though an em dash, period, or comma could make all the difference to the meaning of a sentence.\n\nAccuracy and Choosing a Captioning Vendor\n\nMany vendors promise a 99% accuracy rate, but in reality, their accuracy falls short. Ask your captioning vendor the following questions to ensure you get the most accurate files back:\n\nDo you guarantee 99% accuracy on all files?\n\nHow do you measure accuracy rates?\n\nIs the accuracy consistent regardless of the size of the file?\n\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\n\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a technology that automatically translates the spoken words in a video, without human help.\n\nASR transcripts are often riddled with inconsistencies and lack important closed caption quality standards.\n\nASR is fast, cheap, and a good rough draft. To give your viewers an accurate transcript, it’s always best practice to review and edit ASR transcripts.\n\nDownload the 2023 State of ASR\n\nWhy is ASR Not Good Enough?\n\nASR only provides 80% to 95% accuracy, at best.\n\nASR does not include non-speech elements, which are critical for comprehension.\n\nASR does not include grammar or punctuation.\n\nCheap services often mean low-quality transcription, which is common with many ASR services.\n\nPoor audio quality means poor transcription quality with ASR.\n\nLow accurate rates with ASR affect reading comprehension for viewers.\n\nThe Cost of Inaccurate Captions\n\nOther than the inaccessibility of inaccurate captions, there are many reasons why closed caption quality matters.\n\nInaccurate captions can have detrimental effects on your viewers and on your brand.\n\n1. Inaccurate captions mean more work for you.\n\nInstead of focusing on other projects, you now have to spend more time trying to fix your captions.\n\n2. Inaccurate captions also lead to miscomprehension of content.\n\nErrors affect the reading comprehension of your content. Misspellings and incorrect words can be misleading to readers.\n\nClosed caption quality is especially important in educational videos. Mistakes in the caption file can easily misinform a student.\n\n3. Inaccurate captions also hurt your brand.\n\nIn a study by Global Lingo, 59% of respondents said they “would not use a company that had obvious grammatical or spelling mistakes on its website or marketing material.”\n\nGrammar mistakes can hurt your credibility and cost you millions in sales.\n\nNowadays, your online appearance matters, and words are a major part of it. As a result, it’s imperative that you make a good impression by using accurate captions.\n\nClosed Captioning Standards\n\nThe FCC, DCMP, and WCAG have outlined captioning standards to ensure that all closed captions are accessible for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.\n\nClosed Captioning Standards\n\nDescribed and Captioned Media Program (DCMP)\n\nFCC Caption Quality Standards\n\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0\n\nThe DCMP\n\nThe Described and Captioned Media Program (DCMP) is a set of guidelines for captioning best practices. The DCMP’s philosophy for captioning states, “all captioning should include as much of the original language as possible; words or phrases which may be unfamiliar to the audience should not be replaced with simple synonyms. However, editing the original transcription may be necessary to provide time for the caption to be completely read and for it to be in synchronization with the audio.”\n\nAccording to the DCMP, caption quality is:\n\nAccurate: Errorless captions are the goal for each production.\n\nConsistent: Uniformity in style and presentation of all captioning features is crucial for viewer understanding.\n\nClear: A complete textual representation of the audio, including speaker identification and non-speech information, provides clarity.\n\nReadable: Captions are displayed with enough time to be read completely, are in synchronization with the audio, and are not obscured by (nor do they obscure) the visual content.\n\nEqual: Equal access requires that the meaning and intention of the material are completely preserved.\n\nNote: The DCMP guidelines are consistent with the FCC captioning guidelines.\n\nFCC Caption Quality Standards\n\nThe FCC caption quality standards are based on accuracy, timing, completeness, and placement.\n\nThese closed captioning standards apply to pre-recorded, live, and near-live video programming.\n\nWith accuracy, the FCC states that closed captions must match the spoken words in the audio to the fullest extent. This includes preserving any slang or accents in the content and adding non-speech elements. For live captioning, some leniency does apply.\n\nClosed captions must also be synchronized; they must align with the audio track and each caption frame should be presented at a readable speed – 3 to 7 seconds on the screen.\n\nCompleteness is also important. Closed captions must run from the beginning to the end of the program and not drop off.\n\nClosed captions must also be placed so that they do not block other important visual content.\n\nFCC Requirements for Closed Captioning of Online Video: Free Ebook\n\nWCAG 2.0\n\nThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of best practices for web accessibility. They cover everything from keyboard functionality, to video accessibility.\n\nThere are 3 versions of WCAG: WCAG 1.0, 2.0, and 2.1. The most widely used guideline is WCAG 2.0.\n\nWCAG 2.0 has three levels of compliance: Level A, AA, and AAA. Level A is the easiest to complete, while level AAA is the hardest. Most web accessibility laws require compliance with Level A and/or AA.\n\nWCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA require captions for pre-recorded and live video, respectively.\n\nWCAG 2.0 1.2.2 Captions (Pre-recorded) states that synchronized captions should be provided for all video with audio. When there is no audio, content creators must provide a note saying “No Sound is used in this clip.”\n\nWCAG 2.0 1.2.4 Captions (Live) is a Level AA requirement. All live synchronized media must have captions and a mechanism for people to access those captions.\n\nThe 3Play Standard for Caption Quality\n\nLegal standards for captioning can be vague, so we’ve outlined some best standards for caption quality focused on readability, closed caption placement, and speaker labels.\n\nReadability\n\nHigh-quality captions must be readable, otherwise, they aren’t accessible. The goal of captions should be to match the intent and tone of the audio so that deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals can comprehend the content.\n\nThe first element of readability is accuracy. The industry standard for caption accuracy is 99%. Accuracy measures grammar, punctuation, and spelling.\n\nAs we covered earlier, inaccurate captions are detrimental to the reading comprehension of your content. Errors as little as its versus it’s or as substantial as a misuse of words can largely affect the meaning of your content.\n\nCaptions will sometimes have errors; that’s why the standard for accuracy isn’t 100%. But having too many errors is inaccessible and unfair to viewers.\n\nThe next element of readability is grammar and punctuation. Grammar and punctuation make your content readable. It should also be consistent throughout a closed caption file.\n\nThen there is caption frame and characters per line. Each caption frame should hold 1 to 3 lines (most are two lines) of text on the screen at a time.\n\nCaptions should be time-synchronized to the audio and last 3 to 7 seconds on the screen.\n\nCaption Placement\n\nTypically, closed captions are placed in the lower center of the screen but should be moved when important visual elements – like a speaker’s name – appear in the video.\n\nClosed captions should also go away when there is a pause or silence in the audio.\n\nSpeaker labels\n\nSpeaker labels are tremendously helpful for clarifying who said what, especially when there are multiple speakers on the screen.\n\nIf names are not known, using a generic label like “PROFESSOR,” “STUDENT,” or “SPEAKER” is acceptable, but, ideally, you would include the name of the speaker.\n\nHow to Add Captions\n\nNot all video players are the same, which means that adding closed captions to videos can differ significantly from video player to video player.\n\nIn this section, we’ll explore how to add closed captions to your videos – from creating captions to uploading them.\n\nHow to Add Captions to Video\n\nUpload as a “sidecar” file\n\nUse open caption\n\nEncode your captions\n\nUse an integration or API workflow\n\nThere are four ways to add captions to videos: using a sidecar file, open captions, encoding your captions, and using an integration or API workflow.\n\nThe most common way to add captions to your online videos is to use a “sidecar” file. A sidecar file is a computer file with stored data, in this case captioning data.\n\nOpen captions are captions that are burned into a video file. Users can’t turn these captions off or on. Open captions are good for social video.\n\nCaption encoding is when captions are embedded into the video and presented as a single asset. Caption encoding is intended for video that will be shown offline or on a platform that doesn’t support captioning.\n\nLastly, an integration or an API workflow is a way to automate the process of adding closed captions. Essentially, you are creating a link between your captioning vendor and video player to allow your captioning vendor to automatically post your captions back to the original video file.\n\nCaption Formats\n\nAs we’ve mentioned, not all video players accept the same caption formats.\n\nSome closed caption formats like an SRT or WebVTT are easier to create than others. We’ll cover a bit more about closed caption formats later, but for caption formats that require hex codes or are harder to create, we recommend using a professional captioning service or a caption format converter.\n\nOpen Captions\n\nOpen captions are burned into a video. These are helpful for social video, kiosks, or offline video.\n\nThe easiest way to create open captions is to hire a professional captioning service. Although more time-consuming, you can also create open captions using Adobe Premiere.\n\nCreating Open Captions with Adobe Premiere Pro\n\nCreate your caption file and save it as an SCC. Make sure to always proofread your transcript before encoding your captions!\n\nImport the caption file into your project in Adobe Premiere Pro. To do so, select File > Import. Select your .scc caption file. The caption file will appear in your project file as a video file with no audio. Drop the file into your video sequence.\n\nEnable closed captions in Adobe Premiere Pro. Click on the far upper right-hand corner of the program monitor where your video displays. Scroll down and clicked Closed Captioning Display > Enabled.\n\nCustomize caption display (optional). Head over to the Captions Panel. Navigate to Window > Captions, and then select your caption file in the video sequence. Customize font color, background color, line breaks, timing, and caption placement.\n\nBurn the captions into the video. Open Caption Text to automatically burn the captions into the video when placed in the sequence and exported.\n\nCaption Encoding\n\nCaption encoding is when captions are embedded into a video and presented as a single asset.\n\nTypically, you can order open caption encoding or caption encoding. Open caption encoding means the captions are burned into the video and can’t be turned off or on. caption encoding means the video will be viewed offline, but users can still toggle the captions on or off using the “CC” button.”\n\nIntegrations and API Workflows\n\nIntegrations and APIs link disparate systems or platforms to make it easy to share information and build workflows between the two.\n\nWith captioning, they help eliminate mundane steps when using a closed captioning vendor.\n\nEssentially, you start by linking your captioning account to your video platform account. Once they are linked, all you have to do is order your captions via your closed caption provider’s account system or via your video platform. Your closed captioning provider will then automatically post your captions back to your video when they are complete.\n\nIntegrations and Choosing a Captioning Vendor\n\nIntegrations allow you to automate your captioning workflow. Choosing a vendor that offers integrations will save you a ton of time and make your captioning workflow easier. Here are questions to ask a vendor:\n\nDo you offer integrations?\n\nHow do your integrations work?\n\nWhat platforms do you integrate with?\n\nHow does a customer set up an integration?\n\nDIY Workflows for Captioning\n\nBudgets don’t always allow for one to rely on a professional captioning service. So, what’s a good workaround?\n\nWell, you can create your own captions!\n\nYes, DIY captioning can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, but there are some tools that can help ease the burden.\n\nUse the following tools to help you with DIY captioning.\n\nDIY Captioning\n\nCreate captions with YouTube\n\nCreate captions from an existing transcript\n\nTranscribe your audio into text manually\n\nUse an automatic speech recognition software\n\nCreating Captions with YouTube\n\nDid you know more than 500 million hours of videos are watched on YouTube each day? YouTube is pretty much the king of video content on the internet. In fact, every 60 seconds, 72 hours of video are uploaded to the platform.\n\nBut how much of this content is captioned?\n\nYouTube provides many free tools to help users close caption their videos. In fact, you can use these tools to help closed caption your own videos, whether or not you are posting them to YouTube.\n\nYouTube offers free automatic closed captioning for videos uploaded to the platform. Since automatic captions are often riddled with inconsistencies, YouTube also provides a free editing tool.\n\nAnd if you already have a transcript, YouTube will time code your closed captions to your video for free.\n\nYou can also easily download completed closed caption files in various formats, which you can then use to upload captions to other video players.\n\nYouTube Closed Captioning\n\nFrom the Video Manager, select your video and click Edit > Subtitles and CC.\n\nClick English (Automatic) to pull up the automatic captions.\n\nTo Edit these captions, click Edit. You can now select individual caption frames to edit. Your changes will populate in the video preview.\n\nWhen you are ready to download the closed caption file, select Actions > Download. YouTube allows you to download your closed caption file as a .sbv, .srt, or .vtt.\n\nAlways be careful with YouTube closed captioning and be sure to edit the final closed caption file before publishing. If you upload poor-quality captions, Google will flag your content as spam and penalize you in search results.\n\nCreating Captions with a Transcript\n\nCreating a closed caption file is way easier when you already have a transcript. If you don’t have a transcript, using automatic speech recognition software like Dragon, Dictation, or Camtasia can help you create a rough draft. Simply make sure to go back and edit it for accuracy.\n\nWith your transcript in hand, you’ll need to synchronize your transcript and video. We don’t recommend you create the timecodes yourself. Instead, use a program like Camtasia, Accessify Subtitle Horse, or YouTube to create the time codes for you.\n\nFinally, you’ll need to make sure your transcript is in the correct caption format for the video player you want to use. Reference the caption and subtitle format list to check what your video player requires.\n\nOnce you have the correct caption format, you can upload it to your video. Hooray!\n\nCreating Closed Captions Manually or with ASR\n\nCreating closed captions from scratch can be a very time-consuming process, plus there is a lot of room for human error.\n\nIf you are transcribing a video yourself, the easiest way to do it is to use technology.\n\nUsing automatic speech recognition software like YouTube, Dragon, or Camtasia will provide you with a good rough draft that you can edit.\n\nAdding technology into the mixture can cut your time by more than half. On average a trained transcriptionist can take four to five hours to transcribe one hour of audio or video content from scratch. For an untrained novice, this can take much longer.\n\nUsing software to timecode your closed captions will also save you a ton of time. Timecoding your closed captions yourself is never recommended as there is a lot of room for error.\n\nAdding Captions to Social Video\n\nOver the last couple of years, social video has grown to be the most popular form of content on social media.\n\nSocial video is a powerful tool for marketers, influencers, and organizations to engage with their audience and share interesting stories.\n\nThe major social video platforms are YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Twitter and Snapchat are also popular mediums to publish video.\n\nThe Stats on Social Video\n\nOver 500 million people watch videos on Facebook every day.\n\n91% of Instagram users watch videos weekly.\n\nHalf of social media users prefer video over other types of content.\n\n80% more people are more likely to watch an entire video when captions are available.\n\nWhile most social platforms don’t allow users to upload captions, it’s still possible and very beneficial.\n\nFacebook uncovered that 80% of viewers reacted negatively to videos autoplaying with sound. As a result, they now autoplay videos on silent. Other social platforms, like Instagram, have followed in Facebook’s footsteps.\n\n41% of videos are incomprehensible without sound or closed captions. This means that if you are not closed captioning your videos, viewers are most likely scrolling past your videos without playing them.\n\nPlatforms like YouTube and Facebook have mechanisms for viewers to add closed captions to videos.\n\nOn the other hand, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter require open captions.\n\nOpen captions are burned into a video file. They can’t be turned off or on by the viewer. The easiest way to create open captions is to go through a professional captioning vendor and order caption encoding.\n\nHow to add captions to Facebook\n\nTranscribe your video and save it as an SRT file.\n\nUpload captions to your Facebook under Edit Video.\n\nHow to add captions to Instagram, Twitter, and Linkedin\n\nGet your captions encoded (burned) into your video.\n\nPublish your encoded video and watch the likes the roll in!\n\nCost of Closed Captioning\n\nThe cost of closed captioning can vary depending on vendor and process.\n\nWhether you are closed captioning in-house or using a professional closed captioning vendor, there are costs to closed captioning.\n\nThere are four important steps in a closed captioning workflow: transcribing the video, synchronizing the text, controlling quality, and managing the overall process. All these steps impact the final cost of your closed captions.\n\nCost of Closed Captioning\n\nThe cost of closed captioning depends on the process. You can either closed caption in-house or outsource your captions.\n\nA common misconception is that using a closed captioning vendor will cost you more, which is why many organizations caption in-house. But using un-trained transcribers – like students – can actually be more costly as they can take longer to caption a single file.\n\nWith outsourcing, the cost of captions can vary from $1-$27 per minute. For a cost-effective and high-quality solution, opt for a vendor that uses a mix of technology and human editing.\n\nLastly, be careful with lower quality solutions or relying on ASR-only. The error rates in the files you get back mean that you will have to spend more time and resources correcting the files – costing you more.\n\nIn-House Closed Captioning\n\nMany people opt to caption in-house to save money. The assumption is that professional closed captioning services are expensive.\n\nBut is it really cheaper to close caption in-house than use a professional closed captioning vendor?\n\nLet’s calculate.\n\nIn-house Transcription Costs\n\nThe first step in closed captioning is to transcribe the video. This is often the most time-consuming part. A trained transcriptionist will take four to five hours to transcribe one hour of normal audio or video content.\n\nWhile larger corporations may have the means to hire trained transcriptionists, smaller organizations with smaller budgets typically have students or interns transcribing.\n\nAs an untrained transcriptionist, a student or intern can take five hours or more to transcribe a one hour file. If this student is paid $15 per hour, this means it will cost $75 to transcribe a one-hour-long file.\n\nIn-house Timecoding Costs\n\nNext, you have to synchronize the closed caption file. This is often the hardest part because you have to make sure that each caption frame aligns with the audio.\n\nThere are free tools that will help time code transcripts like YouTube, but for this analysis, we will assume that synchronization adds an additional hour to the process.\n\nNow the cost rises to $90 per hour of content.\n\nIn-house Quality Control Costs\n\nNext, we have quality control. The goal is to have accurate closed captions that are accessible and comprehensible.\n\nGood quality closed captions use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. They are also synchronized correctly, readable, and don’t obstruct important content on the screen.\n\nQuality control involves two steps: training employees on correct closed captioning standards and reviewing closed caption files for errors.\n\nA good quality check should take longer than the duration of the actual file. So for an hour and a half of quality check the total in-house cost of closed captioning rises to $112.50 per hour of content.\n\nIn-house Operations Costs\n\nFinally, we must add the cost of managing operations. Operations managers are in charge of training, finding students, and scheduling oversight.\n\nA supervisor is paid around $25 per hour. Assuming it takes around 2 hours for training and oversight, this brings the cost to $165.\n\nIn-house Final Cost\n\nA conservative estimate for in-house, large-scale closed captioning operation averages $165 per hour of video, which is more than double the cost of hiring a professional closed captioning service.\n\nIn-house closed captioning works when you have short videos. In fact, many universities, like the University of Arizona, implement a hybrid approach to captioning.\n\nOutsourcing Closed Captioning\n\nA common misconception people have about outsourcing closed captioning is that it’s expensive. When the cost to caption a 30-second Superbowl commercial is $200 (which is really only a fraction of the $4 million spent buying the ad space), it explains why people have these misconceptions.\n\nThe truth is that closed captioning prices really come down to the vendor’s process. Cheap closed captions may be enticing, but the quality could be detrimental.\n\nASR\n\nUsing automatic closed captions on their own is not good enough.\n\nASR closed captions are riddled with inconsistencies and errors; they are highly inaccessible.\n\nASR closed captions are easy and often free. For example, YouTube and Facebook both offer automatic captions for videos, so by default, many people opt to use them.\n\nOn average, ASR can cost $0.25 per minute. But cheap is cheap, so if you do opt to use ASR, make sure to double – maybe even triple – check your transcript before publishing.\n\nBelow is an ASR transcript.\n\nPlay the audio & read along. What errors can you find?\n\nCrowdsourcing\n\nCrowdsourced transcription companies distribute your audio or video files among a large number of people. A single audio or video file is either segmented into smaller parts or assigned as one file.\n\nThis can be cheap and sometimes fast, but it can also be very risky.\n\nSimilarly, other people use the Amazon Mechanical Turk, where you upload content to the platform, and a freelancer picks it up.\n\nThrough the Mechanical Turk, you dictate your own price, which can easily add up if you are using multiple workers.\n\nThe Risks of Crowdsourcing Captioning\n\nTranscriptions lack training\n\nCan be expensive and not worth the cost due to inaccuracies\n\nFiles can have inconsistencies\n\nSecurity risks\n\nLack of legal compliance\n\nMay require internal quality assurance\n\nSo, what’s the cost of crowdsourcing closed captioning?\n\nWhile in many cases the price you pay is low, the consequences of using a low-quality file are pricey. For instance, you have to QA the file yourself, which takes up time away from other tasks. There are also additional costs if you resubmit a file, or order a certain closed caption format.\n\nUsing a Closed Captioning Vendor\n\nThere are many closed captioning services to choose from, but not all are created equal.\n\nWhen selecting a closed captioning vendor, you want to make sure you find one that is reliable, accurate, and cost-effective.\n\nDifferent vendors have different processes for closed captioning. The process will directly correlate to the price. Although it can be enticing to go for the cheaper option, the quality of the closed captions you get back might not be worth it.\n\nSo, what should you be looking for in a closed captioning vendor?\n\n1. Accuracy rate\n\nWe talk a lot about accuracy because it’s critical to the comprehension and accessibility of your closed captions. When looking for a closed captioning vendor, you want to ensure they guarantee a 99% accuracy rate on all files, regardless of size. They should also have a clear method for measuring their accuracy. If you notice too many inconsistencies in the files you are getting back – it may be time to look for a new vendor.\n\n2. Process\n\nAs we covered earlier, the captioning process directly impacts the file accuracy and price.\n\nYou want to look for a vendor that offers high-quality at a good price. Ask your vendor the following questions:\n\nHow do you close caption files?\n\nAre single files split between multiple transcriptionists?\n\nAre transcriptionists trained on quality standards?\n\nDoes the vendor have a quality review process?\n\n3. Difficult content\n\nFinding a vendor who can handle difficult content – while upholding a 99% accuracy rate – is especially important for colleges and universities. More advanced subjects like physics, calculus, philosophy, law, and medicine have unique terminology that is critical for student comprehension.\n\nMake sure your vendor can handle that complex content. If you can upload glossaries with important terms, that’s a huge benefit.\n\n4. Turnaround\n\nAlways ask your vendor about their turnaround times. In particular, ask about their standard turnaround. Knowing this ahead of time can help you plan your closed captioning projects more effectively.\n\n5. Integrations\n\nChoosing a vendor that integrates with your video platform will save you a lot of time.\n\nAsk a vendor how their integrations work and if they are easy to set up.\n\n6. Workflow\n\nA non-user-friendly workflow can cause a lot of headaches.\n\nA good closed captioning vendor will have a clear workflow. They will offer different methods to upload videos, they will let you know when closed captions are ready, and they will store your closed caption files for you.\n\n7. Cost\n\nClosed captioning costs can add up quickly. Look for a vendor who is transparent about their costs, and can help you stay within your budget.\n\nWhen talking to a vendor, ask them:\n\nWhat’s your pricing model? Do you charge per minute or per file?\n\nDo you round up to the nearest minute?\n\nDo you charge fees for having multiple speakers? Or for having speaker identifications?\n\nDo you charge extra fees for certain closed caption formats?\n\nDo you require a setup fee?\n\nDo you offer bulk discounts?\n\n8. Account System\n\nDoes your closed captioning vendor allow for subaccounts? How does invoicing work? Can you pay electronically? Can you handle multiple users?\n\nThese are all important questions to ask when selecting a closed captioning vendor.\n\nYou want a vendor who can customize the account system to your needs.\n\n9. Support\n\nWhen your closed captions are due now for your Netflix show releasing in an hour, a good support system is vital.\n\nWhen asking about a vendor’s support, look into how is it made available, how fast they respond, and if they have documentation available.\n\nHow to Save Money on Closed Captioning\n\nClosed captioning is essential to making your videos accessible, but it doesn’t have to deplete your whole budget.\n\nThere are many solutions you can implement to save on closed captioning. Simply find the solution that works best for you.\n\nApply a Hybrid Solution\n\nA hybrid approach to closed captioning is when you do shorter work in-house and outsource longer files to a professional closed captioning service.\n\nThis technique has helped many organizations, like the University of Arizona, to save a ton of money on closed captioning.\n\nSo, what’s considered a short versus long video?\n\nTypically, organizations will caption in-house videos that are 5-minutes or less. Longer videos tend to take more time and resources, so it’s more cost-effective to outsource them for closed captioning.\n\nPrioritize Videos\n\nEven though your goal should be to caption all your videos, sometimes it’s not economically feasible.\n\nInstead of not closed captioning at all, try prioritizing your popular videos for closed captioning. Caption videos that have the most views, shares, or engagement; caption videos that are in more prominent places, like on your homepage; and caption videos requested by viewers.\n\nIf you caption on YouTube, you can use the YouTube Closed Caption Auditor to see which videos get the most traffic.\n\nOnce you have your important videos captioned, you can begin closed captioning other videos.\n\nNote: You should also prioritize videos that people request to be captioned.\n\nMaking the Most of Turnaround Options\n\nQuicker turnaround options can make closed captioning costs add up. Sometimes, you may need a closed caption file within 2-hours or by the next day, but if you can avoid having a rushed turnaround time, you can actually save a ton of money.\n\nFurthermore, some closed captioning vendors will offer discounts for extended turnaround times (ie. longer turnaround than the standard).\n\nThe best way to stay on top of your closed captioning turnaround is to integrate closed captioning into the project timeline.\n\nVendor Charging & Bulk Discounts\n\nIf you have a lot of video content to caption, using a vendor that offers bulk discounts can save you some money.\n\nAnother way to save money is to ensure your vendor doesn’t round up the cost of closed captioning. Some vendors will charge you for 4 minutes of closed captioning, even if your video was 3:39 minutes long. For smaller files, this might not be a big difference, but as you caption more you can save yourself more money this way.\n\nCreate a Closed Captioning Budget\n\nDon’t have a closed captioning budget? It might be time to create one.\n\nHaving a closed captioning budget will help you stay on top of how much you are closed captioning, as well as ensure that you are using your funds efficiently.\n\nThere are many creative ways you can use to find the money for closed captioning.\n\nIf you are an educational institution, you can insert a closed captioning fee into the student tuition fees. This strategy has helped NC State raise over $60,000 a year for closed captioning.\n\nIf you have leftover funds from other budget initiatives, you could use those to help create a closed captioning budget as well.\n\nThe key is to assert that you are making a commitment to closed captioning.\n\nHow to Get Buy-In for Closed Captioning\n\nThe number one barrier to closed captioning is cost and budget.\n\nAs we’ve discussed above, closed captioning costs can rack up quickly, but it shouldn’t be a barrier to accessibility.\n\nTo get buy-in for closed captioning you’ll need to first build awareness, then show it’s a worthwhile investment. Follow these tips to help build awareness at your company.\n\n1. Build Awareness\n\nGetting buy-in for closed captioning takes work. In a study we conducted on the state of captioning, we uncovered that the true decision-makers for funding closed captioning are often unaware they are required to caption.\n\nThis means that educating your higher-ups or decision-makers is the first step to getting buy-in for closed captioning.\n\nAt Netflix, they use a bottom-up approach to get buy-in. Because accessibility is a passion of many of the employees there, they got together and actually brought it up to the higher-ups.\n\nHow to Build Awareness for Accessibility\n\nHost meetings or lunch & learns about accessibility best practices.\n\nShare end-user commentary from accessibility implementation.\n\nSend out a company or team accessibility newsletter.\n\nAttend accessibility-focused events and invite colleagues.\n\nEducation is a powerful tool. If more people at your organization realize the benefits and importance of closed captioning, more people will work to create a budget to help execute it.\n\n2. Demonstrate the ROI\n\nStep two is to demonstrate the ROI of closed captioning.\n\nClosed captioning has been proven to increase engagement, boost SEO, and add brand value.\n\nROI: SEO\n\nGoogle ranking bots can’t watch videos, that’s why you need captions to tell them what your content is about.\n\nPLYMedia, an ad-tech and online marketing company, saw a 40% increase in views after adding closed captions to their videos.\n\nClosed captions are crucial for improving your SEO and they help your videos stand out among the clutter.\n\nROI: Engagement\n\nThe Journal of Academy of Marketing Science found that closed captions improve brand recall, verbal memory, and behavioral intent.\n\nFacebook uncovered that 85% of its videos are watched without sound. As a result, they now autoplay videos without sound.\n\nIf your video lacks closed captions, more often than not, people are going to scroll past it.\n\nROI: Brand Value\n\nOath is a communications company that houses brands like Yahoo!, AOL, and HuffPost.\n\nOath’s brands produce a lot of video content. When it came to video accessibility, there was no question of whether to close caption or not.\n\nInstead, they looked at their company’s values and culture. Oath values its commitment to inclusion. As a result, getting buy-in for closed captioning came from honoring that commitment, as well as realizing the ROI of closed captioning.\n\nOath saw closed captioning as a part of their overall goal of ensuring everyone has access to the content they produce.\n\n3. Suggest doing a pilot project\n\nIf you are still having trouble getting buy-in, suggest doing a pilot project.\n\nA pilot project should have a defined beginning and end, a budget, and a way to measure the impact of closed captioning.\n\nYou should monitor how people respond to the addition of closed captions, and look at the performance of the video. Did views increase? Were your videos easier to find?\n\nOnce your pilot project is over, you’ll be able to present a strong case to get buy-in for closed captioning.\n\nBenefits of Captions\n\nThe reality is most people aren’t captioning their online video content.\n\nWhile they may recognize that captions are essential for accessibility, something still keeps them from closed captioning.\n\nMore often than not that something is budgeting.\n\nBut investing in captioning can actually reap many benefits that go beyond accessibility.\n\nIn this section, we explore the benefits of closed captions for your viewers, videos, and brand.\n\nDiscover the Benefits of Captioning and Transcription: Free Ebook\n\nBenefits of Captioning\n\nAccessibility\n\nLegal protection\n\nVideo SEO\n\nBetter focus, engagement, and memory\n\nGreater flexibility for viewing content\n\nEasy to create derivative content\n\nTranslations\n\nCombat silent autoplay on social video\n\nAccessibility\n\nClosed captions were created as an accommodation for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers.\n\nWith more than 48 million Americans who have some degree of hearing loss, captions are essential for allowing your message to reach the masses.\n\n20% of Americans are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Most of these individuals (60%) are either in the workforce or in an educational setting.\n\n71% of people with disabilities leave a website immediately if it is not accessible. With the advent of the internet, a lot of disabilities are invisible to content creators – we can’t see the people surfing or consuming our content.\n\nHearing loss is often an invisible disability. Proactively captioning your content will ensure that all of your viewers can enjoy your content.\n\nLegal Protection\n\nWhat do Amazon, Netflix, and FedEx have in common?\n\nOne word: captioning.\n\nAmazon, Netflix, and FedEx have all been sued for lack of captioning.\n\nFor most video producers, you are required to caption by law. Failing to close caption your content could result in costly legal fees and damage to your reputation.\n\nKey Captioning Lawsuits\n\nOnline Video: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon were sued for lack of captions on their videos.\n\nEducation: MIT and Harvard were sued for providing inaccurate captions on public-facing videos.\n\nCorporate: FedEx was sued for failing to caption online employee training courses.\n\nVideo SEO\n\nVideo SEO means optimizing your channel, playlists, metadata, description, and videos for search.\n\nSearch engine bots can’t see a video or listen to audio, but they can index text. Captions and transcripts provide a text version of your video so search engine bots can crawl and properly index your video.\n\nAs a result, you get more search engine traffic, your videos rank higher, and they rank for more diverse keywords.\n\nAccording to Facebook, videos with captions have 135% greater organic search traffic.\n\nBetter Focus, Engagement, and Memory\n\nThere is an ancient Chinese proverb that goes, “I hear, and I forget; I see, and I remember.”\n\nCaptions can help you remember.\n\nIn fact, a research study by the University of Iowa found that people recalled information better after seeing and hearing it.\n\nCaptions are visual aids of the words being spoken. They can help children with reading comprehension, students with understanding the content, and ESL individuals with spelling and pronunciation.\n\nWhen there is complex language, poor audio, or complicated information, captions can clarify the content for your audience.\n\nCaptions can also help grow your brand awareness.\n\nA research study from the Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science found captions improve brand recall, verbal memory, and behavioral intent.\n\nGreater Flexibility for Viewing Content\n\nWe live in a world where everyone seems to always be on the go – often face down, looking at their phones… watch out!\n\nThanks to smartphones, people have access to video content 24/7. In fact, Cisco reported that mobile video content generated the majority of traffic growth in 2017.\n\nPeople are watching videos at all hours, with and without headphones.\n\nCaptions are important in order to make your video comprehensible without sound. 41% of videos are incomprehensible without sound or captions, which means that if someone doesn’t have headphones, they won’t watch your video.\n\nEasy to Create Derivative Content\n\nWith closed captions, you also get a transcript of what is being said in the video. As a result, you can easily scan the content of the video to easily create derivative content from it.\n\nYou can easily create short clips, infographics, white papers, podcasts, and more!\n\nTranslations\n\nWith captions, it’s also easier to create translations into other languages. The internet is a global place, which means that people from all over the world are accessing your content.\n\nTranslating your content is a great way to expand your reach. 80% of YouTube views come from outside the United States. In fact, 67.5% of YouTube views come from non-English speaking countries.\n\nHow to Auto Translate Captions on YouTube\n\n1. Under Video Manager, click Edit under the video you want to translate.\n\n2. Next, select the Subtitles/CC tab at the top of the video editor.\n\n3. When you select Add new subtitles or CC, a search bar will appear. Search for the language you want to translate to.\n\n4. A new menu will appear on the left. Select Create new subtitles or CC.\n\n5. You’ll be taken to YouTube’s caption editing interface. Above the transcript, you’ll see two tabs: Actions and Autotranslate. Select Autotranslate.\n\n6. Your translations will appear under the original script. You can easily edit them by clicking on the translated version.\n\n7. Finally, select Publish!\n\nCombat Silent Autoplay on Social Video\n\nAccording to Facebook, 80% of viewers react negatively to videos that autoplay with sound.\n\nAs a result, it’s led to a rise in social videos autoplaying on silent. You’ll notice this particularly when you are browsing on your phone on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.\n\nNow, if you aren’t captioning your videos, your audience will just scroll past them if they don’t have the sound on because they can’t understand it.\n\nCaptioning Laws\n\nNowadays, everyone is using video to tell their story. But while it’s a powerful medium to engage viewers, video falls short of being accessible for everyone.\n\nCaptions are a critical part of video accessibility, as they make video accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.\n\ncaptioning laws can be a bit confusing. For starters, not everyone is required to caption.\n\nOn the other hand, those who are may be required to caption by multiple laws, and even though they are complying with one law, it doesn’t mean they comply with all the laws.\n\nConfused? Fear not! Below we’ll outline all the laws you need to know and how they apply to you.\n\nCaptioning Laws\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act – Section 504 & Section 508\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) – Title II & Title III\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\n\n21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)\n\nState Laws\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act is a federal anti-discrimination law.\n\nUnder the Rehabilitation Act, Section 504 and Section 508 apply to online accessibility. Not all organizations are required to adhere to both Sections.\n\nSection 504\n\nThis law applies to:\n\nFederal programs and activities\n\nFederal agencies\n\nPrograms or activities receiving federal financial assistance*\n\nthe Executive agency\n\nUnited States Postal Service\n\n*This includes airports, state houses, public schools, colleges and universities, federally assisted housing, public libraries, police stations etc.\n\nSection 504 states that individuals with disabilities shall not be discriminated against based solely on their disability.\n\nSection 504 requires organizations to provide “reasonable accommodations” for individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions of the job. This includes making video accessible through closed captioning.\n\nSection 508\n\nSection 508 applies to:\n\nThe Federal Government\n\nState governments through “little 508s”\n\nStates who receive federal funding through the Assistive Technology Act\n\nSection 508 states that all information technology must be accessible to people with disabilities including employees and the public.\n\nThe law requires an alternative, accessible technology must be provided for disabled employees and members of the public.\n\nSection 508 applies to the federal government only, except when a state has enacted a “mini 508” or a federal grant requires compliance with Section 508 – like the Assistive Technology Act.\n\nThe law also requires compliance with WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA.\n\nExemptions are applied to organizations where the implementation of these requirements would cause undue hardship. However, organizations are still required to provide an alternative method for communicating the information to individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was created to ensure equal opportunity for people with disabilities.\n\nTitle II and Title III of the ADA relate to web accessibility for state, local, public and private entities.\n\nThe ADA was intended to apply to physical structures, but through legal action, it has been extended to online content.\n\nNote: Religious organizations are exempt from complying with the ADA.\n\nTitle II\n\nTitle II applies to “public entities” such as:\n\nState and local governments including its\n\ndepartments\n\nagencies\n\nother instrumentalities (for example public meeting halls, airports, and police stations)\n\nActivities, services, and programs of public entities\n\nLocal government, state government, private colleges, and public colleges note in Title II of the ADA. Title II of the ADA has also been applied to private entities. Under the Title, employee training videos must also comply with the ADA.\n\nFedEx Lawsuit and the ADA\n\nIn 2013, FedEx was sued by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for violating the ADA. FedEx failed to provide ASL interpreters and closed captioning employee training videos. FedEx was ordered to pay a $3.3 million settlement and provide ASL interpretation and closed captions.\n\nTitle II of the ADA protects individuals from discrimination by public entities. It requires organizations to provide equal alternatives for communication when necessary. For example, public entities must provide auxiliary aids, unless they alter the “nature of the service, program, or activity” or cause an undue financial and administrative burden. However, if auxiliary aids are unavailable, then they must provide an alternative method for effective communication.\n\nTitle III\n\nTitle III applies to “places of public accommodation” such as:\n\nPublic entities (ex: public venues, public transportation)\n\nPrivate entities (ex: private universities, food services, entertainment)\n\nTitle III protects individuals from discrimination by private entities.\n\nTitle III of the ADA relates to private entities, like private businesses and private colleges.\n\nUnder Title III, individuals with disabilities are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, or accommodations in any public place.\n\nNetflix Lawsuit and the ADA\n\nIn 2011, the National Association of the Deaf filed a lawsuit against Netflix for failing to provide closed captioning for shows and movies on its streaming service. The court ruled that although was a website and not a physical location, it was still a “place of public accommodation” under the ADA and therefore needed to make its services accessible.\n\nHow the ADA Impacts Video Accessibility: Free Ebook\n\n21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act\n\nThe CVAA applies to:\n\nBroadcast TV\n\nFaith organizations\n\nStreaming Media\n\nThe 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) states that all online video previously aired on television is required to have closed captioning (including clips and montages). Captions must be “at least the same quality as when such programs are shown on television.”\n\nIf your video content has never aired on television (like a vlog on YouTube), this act does not apply to you.\n\nVideo creators and content distributors are responsible for ensuring their content is properly captioned.\n\nStreaming sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon, must caption all content that was previously aired on television. Note: Under the ADA, streaming sites must also caption original content, even if it never appeared on television.\n\nFaith organizations that broadcast their sermons must also caption them when posted online.\n\nThe CVAA also requires live captioning for live programming.\n\nIn addition, captions must meet the FCC’s caption quality requirements, which cover caption accuracy, timing, completeness, and placement.\n\nCVAA Online Video Captioning Requirements and Deadlines: Free Ebook\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission\n\nThe FCC applies to:\n\nBroadcast TV\n\nFaith Organizations\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires broadcast content to be closed captioned.\n\nThe FCC has specific captioning standards that organizations must meet. These include caption accuracy, timing, completeness, and placement.\n\nThe FCC impacts both television and online video.\n\nAny content broadcast on television must provide captioning for live, near-live, and recorded programming. As of 2011, religious organizations that broadcast on television are no longer exempt from the FCC’s requirements for captioning; now, any faith organizations publishing content on television must close caption under the FCC.\n\nBroadcast organizations must also be aware of the audio description requirements under the CVAA.\n\nFCC Requirements for Closed Captioning of Online Video: Free Ebook\n\nFCC Closed Captioning Standards\n\nAccuracy: Captions must match spoken words to the fullest extent.\n\nPlacement: Captions do not block important visual content.\n\nCompleteness: Captions run from the beginning to the end of the program.\n\nSynchronization: Captions align with audio track and are shown at a reasonable pace.\n\nState Laws\n\nState laws apply to:\n\nPublic Colleges\n\nPrivate Colleges\n\nState Government\n\nMunicipalities\n\nK-12\n\nMany states have enacted their own accessibility laws. Several states have even created “mini 508s” which require institutions to comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nEducational institutions, state governments, and local governments should all be mindful of their state accessibility laws.\n\nIn addition, these institutions must be mindful of other accessibility laws that apply to them. Private and public colleges, state governments, municipalities, and K-12 must also adhere to the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA."
