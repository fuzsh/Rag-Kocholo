        "text": "Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties have become hot spots for Hallmark and Lifetime films. The typically romantic and occasionally melodramatic romps may not always be our cup of tea, but the impact these projects have on area businesses/local film workers is something we 100% support. Hallmark’s most recent project in the area, “A Taste of Love,” will officially premiere on Monday, February 19 at 8pm. According to Visit St. Pete-Clearwater, this resulted in an estimated $1.6 million local spend.\n\nIt’s duration in Pinellas County included 350 room nights and 30 local hires. More importantly, several local businesses in the Dunedin area are getting their respective moments in the spotlight. Iconic local gems such as Sea Sea Riders, Fenway Hotel, and Wild Iris Café along with some of the beautiful Pinellas County nature at Clearwater Beach, Edgewater Park, and the Pinellas Trail all have starring roles in the movie.\n\nFilm projects generate millions for Pinellas County businesses\n\nTodd Yonteck, Michael E. Brown, and Conrad De La Torres III of Digital Caviar Film (based in Tampa Bay) chose the St. Pete/Clearwater area as the location for this independent feature film for “the beauty of the area, the friendly work environment, and talented crew in Pinellas County,” according to a press release. Scenes from “A Taste of Love” highlight the picturesque architecture, romantic beaches and marinas, dramatic sunsets and beloved local restaurants.\n\nPop-culture figure Martin Kove (Sensei Kreese in “Karate Kid” and “Cobra Kai”) was not only cast in a lead role of “A Taste of Love” but shared the experience with his son. Actor Jesse Kove was also cast in a lead and best known for his role alongside Joseph Fiennes in “On Wings of Eagles” (the unofficial sequel to “Chariots of Fire”).\n\nMeet and greet set for Dunedin Film Festival\n\nThe Dunedin International Film Festival will host a live panel discussion with “A Taste of Love” stars Martin Kove and Jesse Kove, along with local actor Tony Senzamici on Friday, February 2 at 2 pm at HOB Brewing Company in Dunedin. Festival attendees can catch an advance screening of “A Taste of Love” that same night at 8 pm at HOB Brewing Co.\n\nTickets for that event can be reserved in advance online.\n\nWhat to read next:"
