        "text": "Luke Combs' latest single \"Ain't No Love In Oklahoma,\" highlight's 29-track collection of Americana and country songs for July 19, 2024-releasing film.\n\nThree decades of country music and mainstream media are colliding in the release of the soundtrack for the forthcoming feature film \"Twisters.\"\n\nYes, award shows, festival lineups and pop songs currently highlight the immense cultural cool of Americana and country music. But by the time the soundtrack is released alongside the film starring Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell and Anthony Ramoson on July 19, the call of the silver screen could reign supreme.\n\nAlongside Luke Combs' lead single \"Ain't No Love In Oklahoma\" (with an accompanying music video featuring NASCAR driver John Hunter Nemechek), a dozen Americana Music Association, Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association Artist or Entertainer of the Year nominees or winners including Miranda Lambert, Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson, Kane Brown, Charley Crockett, Thomas Rhett, Shania Twain and Tyler Childers, plus a sextet of assorted other chart-toppers including Megan Moroney and Bailey Zimmerman, plus social media-adored stars of the moment like Tanner Adell, are represented on the release.\n\nWhat is 'Twisters' based on?\n\n\"Twisters\" is a modern-day chapter of the 1996 blockbuster \"Twister\" and is directed by Oscar-nominated writer-director Lee Isaac Chung, with executive producers including Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg, Thomas Hayslip and Ashley Jay Sandberg.\n\nThe film focuses on the trio of lead characters as what a press release calls \"equal forces with opposing motivations who come together to try to predict and possibly tame the immense power of tornadoes.\"\n\n\"As storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed (in the form of) multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma.\"\n\n\"Twisters\" will be distributed by Universal Pictures domestically and by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally.\n\n\"Twisters: The Album\" Tracklist"
