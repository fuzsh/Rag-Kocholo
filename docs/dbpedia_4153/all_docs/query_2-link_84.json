        "text": "In 1955, The Nature Conservancy pledged $7,500 toward the purchase of 60 acres of old-growth forest along the Mianus River Gorge in New York. It was the young organization’s first-ever land preservation project, and it was by any measure a triumph. But although the land was secured, the future of the Mianus River was being decided downstream. The preserve was established at approximately the same time that a dam was being built, converting the free-flowing Mianus River into a reservoir, and proving that protecting land around a river is not always enough to ensure a river system’s overall health. Threats come in many forms across the watershed, including dams, pollution and water extraction.\n\n“I think that’s a lesson we’re still learning. In less than the span of TNC’s history, we’ve seen more than an 80% decline in populations of freshwater species—and even worse for large animals, like hippos,” says Tara Moberg, the Conservancy’s global freshwater strategy advisor. “This is the moment to turn the page, to move past the standing assumption that land preservation will inherently safeguard the freshwater systems within them.”\n\nInstead, freshwater requires a combination of strategies like the Durable Freshwater Protection Framework, a roadmap for protecting rivers like those of the Balkan Peninsula, and water funds, where downstream human communities invest in the watersheds on which they depend for drinking water or irrigation.\n\nToday, TNC is driving more than 450 current and planned freshwater projects, in 35 countries on five continents, spanning everything from fisheries management to dam removal. But it’s also working to overturn that “terrestrial bias,” both within the organization and across the global conservation community. Over the past few years, dozens of governments around the world have committed to protect or effectively conserve at least 30% of the world’s land and sea by 2030, commonly known as the “30 by 30” initiative. It’s vital, Moberg says, that freshwater systems are an explicit part of that equation. The 30 by 30 target is currently being negotiated by 196 countries under the Convention on Biological Diversity, a treaty that is expected to be renewed in 2022 after being signed 30 years ago at the Rio Summit on Environment & Development.\n\nThis fall, TNC joined experts and leaders from 97 countries and territories to urge the United Nations and national delegates to strengthen actions to protect and restore freshwater ecosystems under the Convention. And there are signs that the push to include freshwater in conservation targets is working—earlier this year, a federal report on U.S. efforts to meet the 30 by 30 goal mentioned freshwater resources alongside land and oceans, and the Campaign for Nature, the coalition leading the advocacy for 30 by 30, is partnering with TNC and others to call for freshwater to be prioritized in the 2030 commitments.\n\nProtecting freshwater also requires understanding its unique vulnerabilities—agricultural runoff can cause harm far downstream of farms themselves, for example, while a single invasive species can throw a lake’s entire food web off balance. And while efforts to protect freshwater often succeed because they are connected to its value as a resource for humans, TNC is also working to highlight its importance as habitat for protecting biodiversity, including everything from humble invertebrates to lesser-known species like the West African manatee and Southeast Asia’s Irrawaddy dolphin. “There are amazing species in freshwater systems,” says Amy Newsock, TNC’s global freshwater protection program advisor. “But we don’t communicate about them as well as we do other species. There’s a paradigm shift that needs to happen, both in how we protect freshwater, and in how we talk about it.”\n\nThe Nature Conservancy’s work to protect freshwater systems around the globe is supported, in part, by Enterprise Rent-A-Car Foundation.\n\nEven as TNC partners work with locals to protect more rivers across the Balkans, the Conservancy is working to scale up these early successes to save other vulnerable rivers around the world. In 2021, Higgins, Newsock, Zablocki and others at TNC published a set of guidelines for governments and conservation groups on how to engage local communities, build political will, identify legal and regulatory mechanisms for river protection, find funding and establish management plans.\n\n“Rivers are as diverse as the people who walk this planet, but there are common elements,” says Newsock. “We already have unifying frameworks for land protection—World Heritage Sites, for example. We want there to be this common language for fresh water, too—something that everybody can apply to their unique context.”\n\nThe Conservancy is already talking with officials in Gabon about how the framework that succeeded in the Balkans could work for them, but Newsock also hopes that these efforts will nudge the global conservation community toward more consideration of fresh water. So far, advocates for terrestrial and marine ecosystems have had better luck winning allies. That may be due in part to humans’ natural affection for charismatic creatures like the giant panda and humpback whale. “You don’t really have that in our freshwater systems,” Newsock says. “I mean, how cute is a carp?” On the other hand, perhaps living intimately with freshwater ecosystems—historically, nearly every human settlement has grown up along a river’s banks—has simply allowed us to take them for granted.\n\nBut it’s also one big reason why fresh water is so important, and why those who are fighting for rivers, from the scientists and conservationists to the Albanian villagers protesting yet another hydroelectric plant, know that they can’t give up.\n\n“You can fix a lot of other things,” Zablocki says, “but if you don’t get fresh water right, then nothing lives.”\n\nJohn Zablocki left The Nature Conservancy in August 2021 after a seven-year tenure. He now works as an energy and environmental consultant."
