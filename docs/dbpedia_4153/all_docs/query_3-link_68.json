        "text": "The BlackStar Film Festival returns to Philadelphia this week, showcasing fresh, emerging works from Black, Indigenous, and brown filmmakers both international and local. This year’s lineup includes three world premieres (The Whites of Our Eyes, Dreams in Nightmares, You Don’t Have to Go Home, But…) and works that spotlight the power of community activism.\n\nAhead of the festival, six directors shared their insights on how Philadelphia has inspired them.\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nShatara Michelle Ford\n\nFilm: Dreams in Nightmares (Aug. 1, 7 p.m., Perelman Theater)\n\nBased in: West Philadelphia and Los Angeles\n\nWhat’s your film about? It’s about committing to chosen family, community, and yourself.\n\nHow did Philadelphia inspire your art? Philly doesn’t necessarily inspire my art, but it very much does nourish and inspire me as a person, which facilitates my art. The city is full of ingenuity. I love how Philadelphians solve problems. I love how the city is shaped by its very old history. I love watching Tyrese Maxey glide down the court. I love the late springs and early summers in the park. I love all of the amazing bars and bakeries and restaurants that have been cultivated by passionate people.\n\nFavorite Philly film? Blow Out by Brian DePalma (*chefs kiss*). Close second: Unbreakable by M. Night Shyamalan.\n\nWhat are you most excited to see at BlackStar? I literally JUST finished my film, and have not had a chance to see it with a proper audience yet, so I think it would have to be that!\n\nKristal Sotomayor\n\nFilm: Expanding Sanctuary (Aug. 1, 1:30 p.m., John and Richanda Rhoden Arts Center at PAFA)\n\nBased in: South Philadelphia\n\nWhat’s your film about? Expanding Sanctuary follows immigrant mother Linda Hernandez, who emerges as a community leader during the historic campaign to end the sharing of the Philadelphia police database (called PARS) with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nHow did Philadelphia inspire your art? The film started out as a way for me to find community as a recent college graduate. What began as a search for home in South Philly grew into a beautiful over six-year collaboration with immigrant rights nonprofit Juntos. South Philly is my home and the Latinx immigrant community has been my ongoing inspiration.\n\n» READ MORE: 11 films you should not miss at the BlackStar Film Festival\n\nFavorite Philly film? I love Quest directed by Jon Olshefski and produced by Sabrina Schmidt Gordon (consulting editor on Expanding Sanctuary). It exudes what I love so much about this city — the strong sense of community that carries and supports us through the good and the bad.\n\nWhat are you most excited to see at BlackStar? You Don’t Have To Go Home But… directed by Aidan Un. I think it will be a beautiful film with stunning cinematography.\n\nDarius Clark Monroe\n\nFilm: Dallas, 2019 (Aug. 3, 1:30 p.m., John and Richanda Rhoden Arts Center at PAFA)\n\nBased in: Jenkintown\n\nWhat’s your film about? It’s an intimate, experiential, and observational five-part docuseries that studies and reveals how citizens are socialized, shaped, and formed within a society. Filmed in pre-pandemic Dallas, Texas, it follows the lives of public representatives and their varied constituents, capturing the city’s pulse and reflecting a state and country in crisis.\n\n» READ MORE: ‘Rocky’, and the 49 other best Philly movies\n\nHow did Philadelphia inspire your art? This is my fifth BlackStar Film Festival and my seventh project to screen here. Since the Philadelphia premiere of my film Evolution of a Criminal at BlackStar in 2014, I have made a concerted effort to make work and screen it for the astounding and supportive BlackStar and Philadelphia audiences. BlackStar’s creative community pushes and inspires you to be better, aim higher, go harder. During the pandemic, I finally left Brooklyn for Philadelphia. Having more space, greenery, and a healthier work-life balance has had a huge impact on my artistic process and output.\n\nFavorite Philly film? Jonathan Demme’s Philadelphia.\n\nWhat are you most excited to see at BlackStar? After a five-plus-year journey, I’m most excited to see my own film. There were many days when a premiere did not seem realistic, but being supported by an incredible team is the only way this series has been able to be birthed into the world.\n\nAidan Un\n\nFilm: You Don’t Have To Go Home, But... (Aug. 3, 11 a.m., Perelman Theater)\n\nBased in: East Lansdowne\n\nWhat’s your film about? It’s a documentary about long-standing Philly dance party Second Sundae, following the lives of three dancers. The film asks: Why do people dance? What does it mean to be in community? How do you pair passion and the needs of living in capitalism? And where does a dancer go when the club lights come on?\n\nHow did Philadelphia inspire your art? After 17 years in Philly, I appreciate the city’s sometimes charming, sometimes blunt way of asking you to look more carefully, to dig under the surface. That house you pass by everyday is where Coltrane dreamed up A Love Supreme, or tucked away in someone’s backyard are ancestral chili plants, preserved over several generations. You don’t know which of these Philly pothole streets is actually a portal to another dimension.\n\nFavorite Philly film? The Inheritance by Ephraim Asili.\n\nWhat are you most excited to see at BlackStar? A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde by Ada Gay Griffin.\n\nYaba Blay\n\nFilm: The Whites of Our Eyes (Aug. 4, 3 p.m., Suzanne Roberts Theatre)\n\nBased in: Germantown\n\nWhat’s your film about? The politics of beauty and b/Blackness in my familial homeland in Ghana. It follows a young man who has an annual beauty ritual that involves bleaching his skin.\n\nHow did Philadelphia inspire your art? I can’t say that it directly inspires my art. However, I began my research on skin bleaching and Black body/identity politics while a graduate student at Temple University’s Department of African American Studies, where I earned my doctorate.\n\nWhat are you most excited to see at BlackStar? A Mother Apart, directed by Laurie Townshend and featuring Staceyann Chin.\n\nMaame Adjei\n\nFilm: The Whites of Our Eyes (Aug. 4, 3 p.m., Suzanne Roberts Theatre)\n\nBased in: Accra, Ghana\n\nWhat’s your film about? Taking a critical look at the ideas and ideals of beauty in modern-day Ghana.\n\nHow did Philadelphia inspire your art? I went to college in Philly and spent 12 years here. Philly is where I became a woman, where my creativity was sparked, and where I met my cocreator Yaba Blay. It plays such an integral role in this film even coming to life.\n\nFavorite Philly film? Trading Places."
