It’s a time to consider how we can support our loved ones and the causes that matter most to us. Marie’s story is a powerful reminder of the impact that a well-planned will can have, both on our families and our communities.\n\nClick here to learn more about Aunt Marie's Legacy and Make-a-Will month.\n\nYet, Abdiel is not your typical two-year-old. The boy’s life has been a constant barrage of doctors, diagnoses and NICU nurses. Any person who was in a constant cycle of those types of interruptions would not necessarily think of that time as anything other than hard work.\n\nHowever, Abdiel just calls it playtime.\n\nAt the heart of its growth is the Ronald McDonald Family Room ay Kings County, a sanctuary within the bustling Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, NY. This family room offers a respite for caregivers, providing a warm and comforting environment during challenging times. Under the leadership of Odain Brissett, the Family Room has become a model of community support and operational efficiency, setting the stage for expansion into new locations at Metropolitan Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center.\n\nJoin Ronald McDonald House New York for our 30th Annual Skate with the Greats!\n\nDetails: April 2, 2024 | Chelsea Piers\n\nEvent: NY Rangers Alumni Game & Meet and Greet Reception Event\n\nNew York Rangers Alumni attending: Brian Leetch, Glenn Anderson , Ron Duguay, Nick Fotiu, Adam Graves, Ron Greschner, Ed Hospodar, Chris Kotsopoulos, Tom Laidlaw, Stéphane Matteau, Brian Mullen, Colton Orr, Mike Richter, Pete Stemkowski, Steve Vickers and Aaron Voros.\n\nTo help celebrate our 30th anniversary, we are thrilled to share that NYR#30Henrik Lundqvist will also be joining us!\n\n& a special thank you to our long time partner and title sponsor@rbcfor making this event possible!\n\nA huge thank you to @awkwafina for stopping by Ronald McDonald House New York to hand out goodies and bring some holiday cheer. There were smiles all around as kids and families got to meet Gwen and Chump from Universal's new adventure comedy, Migration (in theaters on Dec 22nd). Thanks again to Awkwafina and our friends at Universal and MDC Productions for a fun afternoon creating some extra special holiday memories with our families!\n\nHave you met Dr. Ruth Browne? Dr. Ruth C. Browne is Ronald McDonald House New York’s President & CEO, and we are honored to celebrate her this#womenshistorymonth. Dr. Browne has been a leader in nonprofits since early in her career which has been built on her commitment to equity. She has most recently been recognized as a 2024 Social Impact Woman to Watch by#NonprofitHR, a Notable Leader in Healthcare by Crain’s New York Business and a finalist for City & State NY’s Above & Beyond: Women.\n\nTo say the least, our President & CEO never ceases to amaze us! Our House is fortunate to have such an incredibly passionate leader who guides our team with innovation, compassion, and determination.\n\nFun Fact: did you know one of Dr. Browne’s favorite hobbies is dancing especially salsa and she hopes to perfect the art of moon walking one day? 💃🪩\n\n“This year’s Skate with the Greats was truly unforgettable, as we gathered in support of our families battling pediatric cancer and other serious illnesses and reflected on the legacy our dear friend Rod Gilbert started 30 years ago.”\n\n- Dr. Ruth C. Browne, president and CEO of Ronald McDonald House New York\n\nThank you to our partners@rbcand@hlundqvistfoundationwho made this year’s event possible and an incredible success!\n\nWhen we first learned that Zea needed treatment in NYC, it was overwhelming,” recalls Heather. “But coming to Ronald McDonald House New York was like coming home to a whole new family.”\n\nWhen Zea was just three months old, she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of Neuroblastoma cancer already squarely in stage four and was admitted into immediate surgery on her spine to take out the primary tumor in her body. Over the last eight years, Zea has undergone treatment and a number of surgeries that impact her ability to walk. Today, she is now working on building strength through physical therapy and her goal is to ambulate independently one day.\n\nTo learn more about Zea’s story, check out our newest blog or follow along on our page.\n\nThank you, Zea and your family, for sharing your strength and story with us 💛"
