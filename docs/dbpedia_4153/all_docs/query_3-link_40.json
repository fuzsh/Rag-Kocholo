        "text": "Filming in the four corners of Europe\n\nAlthough most of the British film takes place in London, Richard Curtis wanted some of his characters further away from the English capital. While Colin (Kris Marshall) goes to find love across the Atlantic in the U.S., Jamie (Colin Firth) heads to Marseille alone after his wife’s affair. Filming in the south of France particularly delighted both the actor and the director. “After one week of filming in Marseille, with gorgeous surroundings and lovely dinners, I realised that I had made a terrible, terrible mistake shooting only in England! Now, I’m never going to set anything closer to London than Morocco!” said Richard Curtis.\n\nHugh Grant, a reluctant dancer\n\nWhile the scene itself is iconic, filming it was laborious. Hugh Grant as the British Prime Minister swinging his hips to the Pointer Sisters’ smash hit Jump (For My Love) has brought a smile to millions of viewers around the world. The clumsy and comical dance steps may have seemed natural on the screen, but they required a lot of courage from the actor. Hugh Grant wanted to give his character a serious stature and refused to appear “ridiculous” during this scene. It took Richard Curtis’ persuasive force and the choice of the famous song to convince Hugh Grant to film this scene, which viewers still love nearly 20 years later.\n\nReal reunion scenes filmed at Heathrow Airport\n\nLove Actually opens and closes on scenes of reunions within Heathrow Airport. Couples, families and friends who meet up again give us joyful, heartfelt scenes. And they are authentic as Richard Curtis and his team went directly to the airport to film them. As soon as the cameras captured a moment that met the director’s criteria, the teams would ask the people involved to appear in the film. This authenticity has been a part of the Christmas comedy’s success for nearly two decades.\n\nAndrew Lincoln wrote his famous (and romantic) cards himself\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of the most romantic scenes in recent decades. Mark (Andrew Lincoln) confesses his love to his best friend’s wife Juliet (Keira Knightley) using cards on which he had written what had been on his heart for years. And this of course, with Christmas music in the background. It was a moment that touched hearts and the actor wanted to take part in the creation process. Andrew Lincoln confessed that he had written the cards himself. “I offered to do it myself because I like to think that I have nice handwriting,” the actor said.\n\nLove Actually 2, filmed for the good cause"
