        "text": "Have you watched the romantic comedy PS I Love You? Then you’ll already be familiar with the film locations used among the stunning scenery of Ireland. Picture the scene as the cameras roll.\n\nA guy and a girl stroll among a quiet road through the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland. The rolling moorlands are stained with purple heather. A stream flows under the stone bridge steeped in history.\n\nLater their eyes meet over a pint of Guinness in a traditional Irish pub, among the craic and laughter. He sings her a rousing version of Galway Girl and sweeps her off her feet.\n\nThis article may contain affiliate links that provide commission on purchases you make at no extra cost to you. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nWhere was PS I Love You filmed?\n\nIn the 2007 hit movie PS I Love You, the central character Holly meets her husband Gerry in Ireland, but he sadly dies. His letters mysteriously arrive from beyond the grave to persuade her to overcome her grief and return to Ireland.\n\nHolly revisits the places they fell in love. Scenes from the film were shot in the glorious countryside of the Wicklow Mountains National Park and the cottage where Holly and her friends stay is at Killruderry estate in Bray, County Wicklow\n\nYou can see the PS I Love You bridge location, the Sally Gap, Blessington Lakes and Whelan’s Bar on Wexford Street in Dublin which stands in for the local pub. This rugged and scenic corner of Ireland is surprisingly accessible. It’s less than an hour’s drive from Dublin and has been used in other films such as Excalibur and Braveheart.\n\nYou may also enjoy: Discover the natural beauty of Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way\n\nExperience the natural beauty of County Wicklow for yourself. It’s easy to hire a car and drive south of Dublin for the day. Or, book on the Wild Wicklow tour with local guides who can tell you all the best stories.\n\nRead about my day in Country Wicklow with Irish tales and 50 shades of green on the Wild Wicklow tour\n\nThe Wicklow Mountains\n\nI visited a few years ago the autumn, but the best time to see the heather in full bloom is in August and September. However, there was still colour (50 shades of green according to our guide) over the moorland with dots of fluffy white bog cotton.\n\nThe peat turf that was cut on these hillsides in days-gone-by, was once the main source of fuel for families in the area. That unmistakable smell of peat smoke hung in the air from each pub chimney and the water of the streams coloured peat-brown.\n\nDiscover all the best things to do on the Isle of Man\n\nVisit the Glendalough Monastic Settlement\n\nAlthough it’s not included in the film, I highly recommend a visit to the atmospheric ruins of Glendalough monastic settlement. It was built in a glacial valley in the 6th century by St Kevin, who lived as a hermit beside the lake.\n\nA lone tower stands among the gravestones. It was once used as a bell tower to call the monks to prayer, or to spot intruders from a far. It’s a lovely walk up the valley through woodland and alongside the lake toward the second lake which fills most of the valley.\n\nVisiting a traditional Irish pub\n\nOf course, no visit to Ireland would be complete without visiting a traditional Irish pub. You’ll usually find some live music in the evening, whether it’s a harpist or an Irish band with accordion and fiddle.\n\nIn PS I Love You, the local pub where Holly listens to Gerry playing in a band is actually Whelan’s Bar in Dublin. On our drive through Wicklow, we stopped for lunch at Lynham’s Hotel in Laragh where bare brick walls are covered with old pictures and prints.\n\nDiscover the best restaurants on the Isle of Man\n\nVisiting the PS I Love You Film locations\n\nFor more information about where PS I Love You was filmed in County Wicklow, Ireland visit the Travel Republic Famous Movie Location Guide.
