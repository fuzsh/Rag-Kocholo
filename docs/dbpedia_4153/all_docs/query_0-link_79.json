Drop me a comment at the end of the post and let me know which one is your favourite!\n\n1. Nomadland\n\nReleased at the end of 2020, Nomadland is exactly the sort of poignant, touching film we all needed to put a full-stop on the tumultuous year that was.\n\nBased on a true story, it stars Frances McDormand as Fern, a woman whose life is turned upside down after her husband passes away and her little town in Nevada is literally wiped off the map by the 2008 recession.\n\nFern takes to the road in a camper van, working odd jobs to satisfy her need to contribute to society. The people she meets along the way – real individuals who play themselves in the film – each teach her a lesson about life, love or loss.\n\nShe joins a temporary caravan and finds a community, but she’s constantly drawn back to the road. When she visits her sister, she’s forced to grapple with the questions: Why did I leave home in the first place? Did I find what I was looking for?\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n2. Paris Can Wait\n\nThere’s nothing like a road trip through France to reawaken the senses. Paris Can Wait (2017) follows Anne, a middle-aged woman at a crossroads in life, as she makes an impromptu trip from Cannes to Paris with her husband’s business partner in tow.\n\nRiding in a blue Peugeot, the pair draw out their route, making detours in search of picturesque views, good food and wine.\n\nThis film is all about spontaneity, slowing down, and taking the time to enjoy the finer things in life. Who better than a handsome Frenchman to teach one such life lessons!\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n3. Wild\n\nLike Elizabeth in Eat Pray Love, the protagonist in Wild (2014), Cheryl, finds herself at a juncture in life with more than a few demons to overcome.\n\nTo give herself a much-needed confidence boost and kick-start her new life after her divorce, she decides to set herself a seemingly insurmountable physical challenge.\n\nBased on a true story, Wild follows Cheryl as she hikes the Pacific Crest Trail across the continental US. This movie is as much about mental fortitude as physical endurance.\n\nIf you like Wild, check out this list of awesome adventure travel films.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n4. Tracks\n\nMaybe you’d rather be wandering the streets of Florence then trekking through the Australian desert.. Like Wild, Tracks (2014) proves that we all define ‘adventure’ in our own way.\n\nWhen Robyn, a young Brisbane woman, sets out to walk from Alice Springs to Western Australia’s coast, she has no idea of the challenges that lay ahead.\n\nThis inspirational travel movie explores solo travel and the restorative power of solitude.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n5. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\n\nIf you like Eat Pray Love but you haven’t seen the cult classic The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013), you need to fix that immediately! This movie has a similar tone, exploring themes of introspection, discovery and healing through travel.\n\nBased on a fictional short story, this movie tracks one man’s escape from corporate America as he turns his romantic and far-flung travel fantasies into reality.\n\nHe’s on the hunt for something specific – but what he ends up finding along the way is totally unexpected.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n6. Enchanted April\n\nAn oldie but a goodie, Enchanted April (1991) tells the story of four British women who respond to a newspaper advertisement and end up taking a life-changing spring trip to stay in a castle in Italy.\n\nThe change of scenery does its job, and as each of the women reflect on their marriages, they also find common ground and forge new friendships.\n\nInterestingly, this classic film was shot on location in Portofino at the Castello Brown – the very same castle where Elizabeth von Arnim, author of the book the film is based on, stayed in the 1920s.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n7. Everything is Illuminated\n\nDespite being a huge fan of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel this film is based on, I must confess that Everything is Illuminated (2005) is still on my watch list! By the time you read this, there’s a good chance I would have watched it multiple times.\n\nThis is another film about a deeply personal quest for meaning. Alex, the main character, sets off from his home in the US to Ukraine to track down the woman who saved his grandfather during WWII. Along the way, he must confront the pain of the past once and for all.\n\nThis film examines the impact where you come from has on where you’re going – all in a lighthearted, poignant and slightly quirky format.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n8. The Beautiful Country\n\nLike the previous title on this list of inspirational travel movies, The Beautiful Country (2005) is all about embarking on the one journey some people were born to take:\n\nThe one to discover your roots. It follows Binh, a young Vietnamese man, who was abandoned by his father, an American GI, during the Vietnam War.\n\nBinh’s determination to connect with father and discover his true identity compels him to leave his village in Southern Vietnam behind and travel all the way to rural Texas.\n\nIt’s an epic 6-month saga fraught with disaster; but for Binh, it’s worth it to unravel the mysteries of his past. This film also looks at themes of belonging and community, and is very interesting from a historical perspective.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n9. The Tree\n\nProving that it’s never too late for an adventure, The Tree (2017) is the sweet, life-affirming tale of an 88-year-old widow who travels across middle America to visit a childhood friend.\n\nDespite concerns from family, headstrong Dorothy is set her ways and wants to conquer the road back home from Kansas to Indiana on her own terms. There’s nothing fancy about this film – it’s subtle and pure, and looks at confronting issues such as ageing and independence in a soft, relatable way.\n\nThe story was inspired by the director’s mother and her best friend – how cool is that!\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n10. Midnight in Paris\n\nThis one is for the romantics. Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris (2011) is a tour of the city through the eyes of a young couple. It’s a visual feast with a rousing soundtrack. If you’ve visited Paris, you’ll recognise many of the locations.\n\nBut, there’s a twist. After the two lead characters have a lovers’ spat, Gil decides to walk Paris’s streets alone. While out late one night, he is swept up in a time-warp that sees him travel back to the Paris of a different epoch.\n\nPart fantasy, part romantic comedy, this is a unique and memorable film about love, passion, and the beauty of getting lost.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n11. Away We Go\n\nWhen Verona and Burt learn they’re expecting their first child, they decide to embark on a journey across America to find a place to raise their baby.\n\nSimilar to Eat Pray Love, Away We Go (2009) is about the search for belonging and the quest for clarity when life presents you with a difficult decision.\n\nAs the couple crisscross the country visiting relatives and friends, they gradually start to appreciate the true meaning of ‘home’ and how it’s often a fluid concept. This indie film is a lighthearted comedy and a very easy watch.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n12. Chocolat\n\nWhile there isn’t a lot of travel going on in this classic film, the evocative setting of Chocolat (2001) will transport you instantly to small-town France.\n\nRemember in Eat Pray Love when Elizabeth starts learning Italian and almost instantly feels more grounded in her surroundings? The similarly free-spirited protagonist of Chocolat also goes to great lengths to form bonds with her adoptive community.\n\nIn the story, Vianne and her daughter move to a small, conservative village to open up a chocolate shop. They fight to win over the hearts (and taste buds) of their neighbours, eventually ingratiating themselves into the community.\n\nRomance, adventure, poignant life-lessons – this uplifting story has it all.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n13. Il Postino\n\nI hadn’t heard of Il Postino (1994) until I visited the Aeolian Islands off the Sicilian coastline last summer. Parts of the movie were filmed on the island of Salina (we got to visit many of the locations), making this a cult-classic Italian film.\n\nThe plot line reminds me a bit of Chocolat. Pablo, a poet exiled from Cuba, travels to the tiny Italian island to seek refuge. Once there, he meets Mario, a local resident who is employed as a postman with the sole duty of delivering Pablo’s letters.\n\nThe two form a bond and Pablo teaches Mario the art of poetry, a tool he uses to woo a barmaid and bring the stories of his local community to live.\n\nThe picturesque setting combined with the motif of ‘fitting in’ in a foreign place make this a wonderful film for travel lovers.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n14. Roman Holiday\n\nSpeaking of Italy – Audrey Hepburn’s Roman Holiday (1953) is another cult classic travel film set in Bel Paese. Interestingly, this movie has its own genre. It emerged during what’s know as the ‘Hollywood on the Tiber’ era, when international directors flocked to Rome to use the enchanting capital as a backdrop to their romance films.\n\nWatching Roman Holiday is like taking a virtual tour around the Rome of the 1950s. The story line almost plays second fiddle to the location.\n\nIn the film, Princess Ann escapes her highly regimented life of luxury (not dissimilar to the idea of escaping from corporate America, a theme you see in many modern-day films like Eat Pray Love) and falls in love with a newsman who shows her a new side of the city, and a new side of herself.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n15. Year by the Sea\n\nWhen it comes to self-discovery and self-improvement, the ‘sea change’ is a motif that repeats across many of these films. In Year by the Sea (2016), the sea change is quite literal!\n\nIt follows Joan (a wife and mother) who decides to leave her husband in search of a new life in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n\nAs she tries to start afresh, she oscillates between feeling guilty and empowered, eventually turning to her local community and a mentor for encouragement. Like Eat Pray Love, this movie also features a male hero – described as ‘a sexy fisherman’ in the film’s synopsis!\n\nYear by the Sea proves just how powerful escaping the mental confines of one’s comfort zone by physically relocating to a new place can really be.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n16. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\n\nI automatically put this film into the ‘oldies’ box when it was released; but truthfully I love it! The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012) combines British humour (the best in the world – admit it!) with themes of self-discovery, breaking stereotypes and shifting perspectives through travel.\n\nIn the charming story, a group of retirees travel to India to stay at the eponymous hotel, most as part of a quest to give their life new meaning. Relationships form, revelations unfold, and group dynamics produce some interesting and very humorous situations.\n\nFilmed in Rajasthan (Jaipur and Udaipur), this movie is a sensual feast – you can almost taste India in some of the scenes.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n17. Under the Tuscan Sun\n\nJust like Eat Pray Love, this movie is based on the real-life memoirs of an author who transports herself to the other side of the world in the hope of transforming her life.\n\nAs the name suggests, Under the Tuscan Sun (2003) is set in the Tuscan countryside – the perfect backdrop for such an adventure.\n\nLeaving her old reality (and cheating husband) in San Francisco behind, Frances joins a group tour of Italy in search of inspiration. She winds up buying a villa (we’ve all fantasised about it!) and starting afresh in the idyllic town of Cortona.\n\nThe eclectic bunch of people from all over the world that she surrounds herself with all come to teach her important life lessons.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n18. A Walk in the Woods\n\nYou’re probably familiar with seminal American travel author Bill Bryson. Did you know that one of his novels was transformed into a movie? A Walk in the Woods (2015) draws on Bryson’s 1998 memoir, dramatising his overland journey along the scenic Appalachian Trail.\n\nNot wanting to complete the long hike alone, he calls on an old buddy to join him. The two butt heads constantly, but they end up solidifying their friendship.\n\nAs with the other inspirational travel films on this list that involve physical endurance, A Walk in the Woods conveys much wisdom about the human spirit and our impulse to press on through times of hardship. This isn’t my favourite film (I found the pace a bit slow), but it’s an easy watch nonetheless!\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n19. Vicky Cristina Barcelona\n\nWhat would you do if a tall, dark and handsome stranger offered to whisk you and your girlfriend away for a weekend in the Spanish countryside? This is exactly the predicament Vicky and Cristina find themselves in when they travel to Barcelona.\n\nThe second Woody Allen film on this list, Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2009) is simple, but extremely entertaining. Juan Antonio is one of my favourite movie characters of all time – he delivers so many great one-liners throughout the film.\n\nThe trio’s Spanish dalliance (it becomes a foursome when Juan Antonio’s passionate and slightly crazy ex-wife gets involved) is romantic, hilarious, and a train wreck waiting to happen. Similar to Eat Pray Love, it explores impulsiveness and the transformative power of ‘just say yes’.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n20. Roma\n\nRendered in black and white, award-winning indie film Roma (2018) is subtle and stirring. Set in the 1970s against the backdrop of some of the most iconic landmarks in Mexico City, it tells the semi-autobiographical story of an affluent family and their housekeeper.\n\nThe setting may be unfamiliar, but the themes this movie explores are universal and will surely hit close to home.\n\nA marriage in turmoil, an affair, a secret pregnancy – the characters’ personal trials are sharpened by the political and social instability unfolding around them. This film is an interesting lesson on Mexico’s modern history.\n\nTravel comes into the story when the two lead female characters embark on a trip to stay at a friend’s hacienda and again later in the film when they travel together to the beach. Both trips are intended to restore clarity to a very cloudy situation, and the women grow to form a unbreakable bond.\n\nHow to watch it: Stream it on Netflix.\n\n21. Dare To Be Wild\n\nOne of the lesser-known movies like Eat Pray Love that features on this list, Dare To Be Wild (2018) received mixed reviews when it was released. Many critics say it’s far too sappy and cliched – I’ll let you be the judge!\n\nThe true story this movie is based on is quite an incredible one. It recalls a chapter in the life of Mary Reynolds, an Irish landscape designer and environmental activist, whose life mission was to change the way people think about nature.\n\nIn the film, Mary and environmentalist Christy Collard join forces and travel to Ethiopia in search of inspiration. Mary’s final destination is London, where she hopes to realise her dream of showcasing nature’s wild beauty at the prestigious Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n22. The Darjeeling Limited\n\nFor me, nothing beats the nostalgia, romance and poignancy of Wes Anderson’s The Darjeeling Limited (2007). Part overland journey, part personal quest, it follows three brothers as they travel across India by train in an effort to mend their relationship and find spiritual enlightenment.\n\nThe soundtrack is a delight, and although it’s definitely a romanticised depiction of train travel in India, this movie put the Sub-Continent on my radar, never to be erased (I will travel across India by train one day if it’s the last thing I do!).\n\nThe idea of releasing one’s baggage, lightening the load, is a beautiful, universal motif that carries across this film.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n23. Lion\n\nAnother personal favourite of mine, Lion (2016) tells the incredible true story of an Australian-Indian man’s search for his birth mother.\n\nIn Eat Pray Love, Elizabeth sets off in search of ‘something’, not knowing what it is, but having a good idea of where she might need to go to find it. In Lion, Saroo’s situation is quite the opposite – he’s looking for something very solid and real, he just doesn’t know where to start.\n\nI can’t tell you how moving this film and the book it’s based on are. You just have to watch it to see what I mean!\n\nI particularly like the scenes at the end of the film when Saroo travels to India and has an opportunity to compare his memories and fantasies with reality.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n24. Up in the Air\n\nUp in the Air (2009) is a travel movie of a slightly different ilk. The lead character, Ryan, is a corporate type who flies constantly for work and aspires to earn 10 million frequent flyer miles. When he strikes up a relationship with Alex whilst in transit, he starts to question his motivations.\n\nRather than exploring travel as an escape, this movie conversely paints ‘normal life’ as an escape from travel. Themes of impermanence and escapism emerge as Ryan is forced to weigh up the pros and cons of his travel-heavy lifestyle, reflecting on the old adage ‘a rolling stone gathers no moss’.\n\nThis movie also imparts some practical lessons, like the benefits of travelling with carry-on only and tricks for getting through airport security more quickly!\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n25. The Terminal\n\nLike the title above, The Terminal (2004) takes the theme of travel to heart and is mostly set in an airport rather than an exotic location. If that doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, stick with it – this Steven Spielberg movie is actually very good!\n\nThe movie begins when a bureaucratic glitch leaves Viktor stranded in that otherworldly, interstitial space most travellers loathe: The airport lounge. He never makes it to his destination, but his experience is life-changing nonetheless.\n\nThis movie shows that oftentimes, you don’t have to travel far (or at all, really) for a transformation to take place.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n26. Lost in Translation\n\nLike Eat Pray Love, Lost in Translation (2003) is a movie about a fish-out-of-water travel experience. Set in Tokyo – mostly in a hotel room – it’s a comedy drama that examines themes of loneliness, culture shock and detachment in a poignant, profound way.\n\nBob and Charlotte strike up an unlikely friendship when they meet at their Tokyo hotel. They end up confiding in each other about their respective relationship struggles.\n\nThis movie illustrates how being in a foreign environment is a like a pressure cooker for relationships, forging friendships in a matter of hours. It also looks at the theme of finding familiarity in within the complete unknown.\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\n27. The Trip to Spain\n\nHere’s a lighthearted comedy to end the list! The third film in the British movie series based off the hit TV series of the same name, The Trip to Spain (2017) follows Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan (who play themselves in the dramatised film) as they travel together through Spain.\n\n‘Misery loves company’ and ‘wherever you go, there you are’ are the resounding themes of this movie. As the duo do their best to live in the moment, real life keeps on intruding. It’s a comedy for sure, but there are dark and thoughtful undercurrents to this film as well.\n\nQuite apart from the story line, this movie is a great way to feast on Spanish scenery and food through the screen. I must admit I let out a little squeal when I saw the pair dining at the Parador in Sos del Rey, the same little village I visited on my Spanish road trip many years ago.\n\nIf you enjoy this film, The Trip to Greece (2020), The Trip to Italy (2014) and The Trip (2011) are also worth watching (back to back if you want to make a movie marathon of it!).\n\nHow to watch it: Rent or buy on Amazon Prime.\n\nMovies like Eat Pray Love: Pin it"
