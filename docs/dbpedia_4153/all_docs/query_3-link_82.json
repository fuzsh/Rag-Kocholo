On top of that, where even is the villa? All the location details revealed.\n\nLove Island 2024 has kicked off with a bang, as Maya Jama welcomed 12 new islanders to a newly painted villa with brand new hideaway rules.\n\nThe hideaway has already caused problems between Samantha Kenny, Joey Essex and Harriett Blackmore and created a spicy private area for bombshell Uma Jammeh to have whisked away Ayo Odukoya.\n\nBut not everything has changed, the firepit is still the firepit, Ian Stirling is still the voice of the show and the the summer series is still filmed in Spain.\n\nRead more: Love Island's Harriett Blackmore Before The Villa & A Closer Look At Her Transformation\n\nRead more: Joey Essex And Samantha Kenny Have Love Island Fans Saying One Thing\n\nBut whilst the villa may be unrecognisable after its revamp, it’s still the same villa we know and love. But where is the Love Island 2024 villa located? Here is everything you need to know.\n\nWhere is Love Island filmed?\n\nThe general rule thus far has been that the summer series of Love Island seemed to be filmed in Mallorca, Spain whilst the winter seasons and the Love Island All Stars season that aired earlier in 2024 were filmed in the region of Franschhoek, Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nThe summer series 2024 is no exception to the rule and has been filmed on the small island of Mallorca.\n\nThe address is even visible on Google Maps if you find yourself in the area, you can check out the iconic villa in Sant Llorenç des Cardassar at Diseminado Poligono 8, 387, 07530, Illes Balears, Spain.\n\nHowever don’t expect the villa to look how it does on TV, first of all, you might get shouted at for wandering the ground as it’s probably private property that is rented out for the duration of the show.\n\nSecondly, all the bright neon lights and colours are built onto the villa’s skeleton for show purposes only, so if you do find yourself visiting, it’ll just look like a normal European villa.\n\nBut hovering over Google Maps showed that the villa retains the unique fire pit all year round. You can see its circle shape from the satellite images.\n\nWhere is the Casa Amor villa?\n\nThis is just speculation, but… call it a heavily educated guess.\n\nWe know the Casa Amor villa is often located incredibly close to the Love Island villa. In the past islanders have heard their counterparts yelling and screaming and partying hard from the other villa, which causes some tension and jealousy.\n\nAlso just for filming logistics, it makes sense to keep the second, smaller villa close by.\n\nAfter zooming out on Google Maps from the Love Island villa, you can see a smaller villa with a pool on another street which the program estimated was just a four-minute walk or one-minute drive down that very same road.\n\nListen live to Capital, and catch up on any shows you missed, on Global Player.\n\nListen to Love Island: The Morning After"
