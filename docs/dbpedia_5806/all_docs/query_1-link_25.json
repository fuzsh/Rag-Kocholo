        "text": "1In the 1890s, a few women attended seminars in economics as guests at German universities, based on individual permits and without the opportunity to finish degree programs. More than 60 years later, a full professorship in economics was offered to a woman for the first time in Germany. A period of social, political and economic upheaval lies in between these two dates. The discipline of economics underwent a significant transformation in this period, too. While the historical-ethical school dominated teaching and research up to World War I, during the Weimar years many economists struggled to overcome this heritage and tried to catch up with the developments in economic theory and empirical research in the Anglo-American world. After World War II, the social sciences in the German Democratic Republic were shaped by Marxist scholarship. West German economics increasingly turned towards the Anglo-Saxon mainstream. However, several of the themes of the interwar years resonated in the debates in the discipline well into the second half of the twentieth century, not least brought up by emigrants from continental Europe, many of them forced into exile, who had taken these topics along with them.\n\n1. Women’s Access to German Universities: From Guests to Regular Students\n\n7In the years before World War I, the first women who had taken standard university entrance exams became regular students. They graduated in economics or “Staatswissenschaften” with a doctorate as the standard degree. Despite the increasing number of female students, women were still a small minority at the universities. In 1908/1909, the first winter term when most German universities accepted women as regular students, 1´132 women enrolled. By 1914 their number had increased to 4´053 and women accounted for 6.7 percent of the overall 60´225 students at German universities (Titze, 1987, 42). During World War I, the share of women in the number of enrolled students remained below 10 percent. However, since many of their male peers were on leave, the actual situation at the universities during the war was very different from peace times. Seminars and lectures were “three-quarter empty” as contemporaries reported (Huerkamp, 1996, 76-77). Occasionally, the majority of actual participants were women. The extraordinary conditions could also extend to employment opportunities: Elisabeth Flitner (1894-1988) filled the job of an assistant with Professor Samuel Paul Altmann at the commercial college in Mannheim before she had finished her degree in economics, a position normally reserved for graduates (Lorenzen, 2018, 109-114).\n\n10When the National Socialists came to power, they restricted the number of students admitted to universities and decreed a share of female students across all fields of a maximum of 10 percent. The number of economics students fell from 3’000 in the summer of 1932 to 800 in the fall term of 1939/40. The share of women declined from 18 to 12 percent in the same time period. During the war, the number of women studying economics increased rapidly to over 200 and their share to over 50 percent (Knapp, 2008, 141-143). The racial and political criteria used by the National Socialists to expel employees from the civil service were devastating. Based on the “Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums”, decreed on April 8, 1933, many lost their jobs and were forced into emigration. The effects on the discipline of economics was devastating as is documented in the two volumes of the biographical handbook on the emigration by economists and social scientists after 1933 by Hagemann et al. (1999). 23 of the 331 entries are devoted to women. Their career paths were closed when the National Socialists came to power, and few found opportunities comparable to those they had seized or were preparing for before they were forced into emigration.\n\n11During the National Socialist years, women were de facto excluded from academic careers. In 1933 they were explicitly denied the right to acquire the qualification for university lectureships (habilitation and venia legendi). Though this legislation was taken back in 1934, the regime introduced an additional requirement in the form of participation in teaching academies that were closed to women. As the years went by, these requirements seem to have lost in importance as compared to the candidates´ political commitment (Knapp, 2008, 142-143). Both the female economists who held professorships (one of them non-tenured) during the National Socialist era adapted to the political situation, albeit to varying degrees (see below, section 4).\n\n12After World War II, the number of female students in economics increased only slowly. Their share remained low. Women in teaching positions in economics were rare after the war, very few permanent positions were filled with women. Between 1945 and 1964 only six women achieved a qualification for university lectureships (habilitation) in economics. On average, another ten years went by before they received a permanent position in the rank of professor. In the case of Elisabeth Liefmann-Keil (1908-1975), the first female appointed to a fully endowed chair in economics, it took 11 years (her biography and contributions will be reviewed below, section 5). Two women obtained statistics professorships in economics departments in the 1960s. Overall, only towards the end of the 1960s the share of women in teaching positions in economics reached levels comparable to those of the Weimar years (Knapp, 2008, 151-152).\n\n2. The Ideology of “Difference” between Women and Men: The First Generation of Women Economists and the Historical-Ethical School\n\n14An adequate education was therefore instrumental to such potential self-sufficiency. The activists of the women’s movement also argued that schools should prepare girls for their traditional / natural roles and possible occupations should be in line with those. The activists characterized femininity as “motherliness”, a quality attributed to women regardless of actual motherhood (Schaser, 2006, 28-29). The professions of teacher and doctor and the broad field of social work were seen as occupations that required “motherliness” and corresponded to women’s nature. These fields of employment, furthermore, would be a means to alleviate the drudges of the lower classes. If poor women had to take up factory work to contribute to the economic survival of their families, e.g. child care and primary schools would help to provide for their small children. Social work, performed by middle-class women, would thus address the social question broadly understood.\n\n18Heinrich Herkner gave his inaugural lecture at the university of Zurich in 1899 and chose to speak about the study of economics by women, which in itself is noteworthy. He reviewed contributions to economics by women in the nineteenth century and summarized what, according to his reading, characterized these contributions. Ultimately, he turned these characteristics into arguments in favor of integrating women into research. Herkner was convinced that women could investigate in areas and collect data that would not be accessible to men. Referencing Beatrice and Sidney Webb he claimed that women could win the confidence of research subjects in situations where a male investigator would be perceived as potential competitor or political opponent (Herkner, 1899, 240). Furthermore, Herkner maintained that the study of social conditions was not only a matter of observation but also one of processing and evaluating information. The “female view” would be desirable as women “regularly take more careful account of the individual personal moment”. Therefore, women would naturally provide an antidote to the “aberrations” of abstract and deductive reasoning in economics. Last but not least, Herkner emphasized that women were particularly able to communicate the insights of economics research to a broader public. The “aesthetic and more intuitive” approach of women would allow them to reach more people than an “analytical” and purely scholarly presentation of findings (Herkner, 1899, 241, the translations are mine). Herkner’s reasoning conformed with the understanding propagated by the representatives of the women’s movement. The emphasis is on differences between women and men, and the development of the particularly female capacities to the benefit of society as a whole.\n\n20Gustav Schmoller, one of the founding members, gave a programmatic speech at the inaugural meeting of the Verein (Schmoller, [1872] 1998). He sharply distanced himself and his associates from the “Manchester party”, allegedly the economists organized in the “Kongress deutscher Volkswirte”. He claimed that the principle of economic freedom had been the yardstick of legislation in the past decades. The result, according to Schmoller, was a growing gulf between the wealthy and the working classes. Not only income and wealth had diverged but also “morals, education, views and ideals” had drifted apart (Schmoller, [1872] 1998, 72). A comprehensive vision of social policy was presented as the means to overcome this gulf. Schmoller linked his policy claim to a commitment to the constitutional monarchy. The strong state power, supposedly independent of class interests, was to provide for laws and their administration aiming at improving the lot of the lower classes. Schmoller highlighted downsides of the capitalist system and explicitly rejected the liberal ideas and the analysis of the classical political economists. At the same time, he dismissed “all socialist experiments” (Schmoller, [1872] 1998, 72, the translations are mine). He rejected the idea of levelling social differences “in the socialist sense”. Instead, he drew up a vision of a class society where an “easy transition”, i.e. social and economic advancement, would be possible. The state should reign in the negative consequences of the capitalist system through factory legislation, housing policy, banking and insurance supervision, government-financed education, professional training programs etc.\n\n22The Verein für Socialpolitik pursued its goal to provide a platform for debate by initiating and coordinating large research projects. The research results were discussed in plenum sessions at the annual conferences. Reviewing the titles of the expert reports prepared in the first few years gives an impression of how broadly the field of social policy was understood. Reports on the reform of the legislation on limited liability companies, on individual taxation, mutual insurance societies for workers, the participation of workers in company profits and on the punishment of breeches of labor contracts were prepared in 1873 and 1874. In the reports, institutional structures were captured and their effects presented in detailed empirical work. Collecting and presenting data was an important aspect of the work. These methods also characterize a considerable part of the articles published in the academic journals, several of which had been founded only recently (Grimmer-Solem, 2003, 75-86).\n\n23In 1897 Schmoller became president of Berlin university. In a speech he gave on this occasion, he characterized his approach as “historical-ethical”. The “Methodenstreit” with Viennese Carl Menger (1840-1921), venerated today as first-generation marginalist, had taken place in the 1880s, but the polemic was still present to Schmoller’s listeners. While from today’s perspective, Menger’s position superseded, at the time, the debate strengthened Schmoller and his school. In his speech, Schmoller praised the historical-ethical approach taking the moral standpoint of social reform as reflecting the general interest. He contrasted it to “rationalism and materialism” and the representation of particular interests. Schmoller claimed that German economics had become “…a great moral and political science which investigates, in addition to production, the distribution of goods and which studies, in addition to the appearances of value, economic institutions; a science which places man at the center of its investigations, instead of the world of goods and capital” (Schmoller, [1897] 1998, 202-203, my translation).\n\n24The first generation of female economics students was introduced to this understanding of the discipline of economics and contributed to research along those lines. In the next paragraphs a publication of Elisabeth Gnauck-Kühne (1850-1917), who was one of the pioneers at Berlin university, will be presented to exemplify the work of many of these early female economists. As mentioned above, Gnauck-Kühne was a guest student at Berlin university for three semesters in 1895-1897. After a successful career as teacher and founder of a private boarding school for girls which she headed for over a decade, she moved to Berlin through marriage. The marriage failed after a few months and was divorced in 1890. Gnauck-Kühne became a dedicated member of the social reform and the women’s movement. She was very well connected in the respective circles, which is underlined by the invitation she received to speak, as the first woman, at the convention of the leading organization of the protestant social reform movement in 1895 (Evangelisch-sozialer Kongress). Her research project was encouraged by her academic mentor Schmoller and by Friedrich Naumann (1860-1919), a pastor and leading figure in the protestant social reform movement and later in the liberal party. Her work was published in Schmollers´ academic journal (Gnauck-Kühne, 1896).\n\n26In her article, Gnauck-Kühne presents her detailed investigation of the working and living conditions of the female workers in the paper goods industry of Berlin. The information she collected directly from workers prevails. She deplores that only few owners of workshops and firms were willing to participate in her study. By including a wealth of data and by the language she employs, she underlines the scholarly style of her presentation.\n\n27Gnauck-Kühne also utilized her research into the working conditions of the women in the paper product manufactures in a very different type of text. In 1895 she published two poems on her experiences as “voluntary worker” in the periodical “Die Hilfe”, which had been brought into life by Friedrich Naumann, a supporter of her project as mentioned above. These are personal and emotional pieces, highlighting the drudgery and misery of the working women’s lives. Like for many other early women economists in the historical-ethical school, Beatrice Webb’s work was an important inspiration. Gnauck-Kühne, who had worked in London for an extended period of time as governess earlier in her life, was familiar with Beatrice Webb’s work. Helene Simon, co-student of Gnauck-Kühne at Berlin university in 1897 had previously studied at the LSE and was personally acquainted with the Webbs. In many respects, Gnauck-Kühne’s investigation was inspired by Beatrice Webb’s work and Gnauck-Kühne’s use of different literary genres to present the results of the investigation had also been pioneered by Beatrice Webb (Keller, 2018, 103).\n\n28Another important influence on Gnauck-Kühne’s and other similar projects was the study of the pastor Paul Göhre who published an over 200 pages long report on his experiences as factory worker and tradesman in 1891. Göhre described the miserable living and working conditions vividly and aimed to understand why workers were increasingly estranged from the protestant church. He concluded with a plea for congenial rapport between social democracy and Christianity. This position was fervently criticized by some, but it also found prominent supporters in Friedrich Naumann and Max Weber. The book was widely discussed, went through two editions in the year of its publication and was translated into several languages. Gnauck-Kühne was certainly inspired by Göhre’s work (Keller, 2018, 88). So were other students of Schmoller, e.g. Waldemar Zimmermann (1876-1963). His study on Prussian railway workers also started out with an immersion as a concealed worker and was designed similarly (Allgoewer, forthcoming).\n\n29Gnauck-Kühne was a very successful writer. She published another article in Schmoller’s journal in 1905 and many book reviews. Most of her writings were aimed at readers beyond the academic sphere, such as brochures or articles in newspapers and periodicals. Her text on economics and civic education for girls´ secondary schools, first published in 1909, went into many editions, the last of which appeared after her death in 1928.\n\n30Gnauck-Kühne received recognition for her work. It was in line with the expectations of the leaders of the historical-ethical school and her policy conclusions conform to the tenets of the Verein für Socialpolitik. In his lecture in favor of women’s study of economics, Herkner (1899, 242) mentions her as an exemplary for women’s ability to explain the complicated findings of research in a form accessible to a broader public. The many invitations she received as a public speaker prove the appreciation of her expertise on social reform. Her standing is also documented by her contribution to the volume edited in honor of Schmoller’s anniversary (Festschrift) in 1908. Gnauck-Kühne was the only female of the 39 contributors. However, the topic she was assigned to cover, was the “Women’s movement and the question of women’s rights” (Gnauck-Kühne, 1908). She and several of the other female students of Schmoller would have certainly been just as qualified to write on other aspects of “The development of German economics in the nineteenth century”. It was to take more than a decade and the far-reaching social changes in the wake of World War I, before women moved beyond the narrow confines of the ideology of difference.\n\n3. Economics and Social Policy as a Step Towards Worthy Employment: The Second Generation of Female Economists in a World Shaken up by World War I\n\n31As pointed out above, the women’s movement strove for access to education and for access to adequate professional opportunities. Based on the argument of difference between women and men, they targeted occupations that corresponded to traditional perceptions of women’s role in marriage and motherhood and emphasized skills and capacities associated with the ideology of “motherliness”. We have seen that the pioneering women students in economics saw their university attendance as a means to further their expertise in view of their activities in the women’s and social reform movements. The next generation of female students came to the universities at a younger age and saw their studies as a qualification for work. After World War I the economic motives became ever more important as a motivation to take up university studies.\n\n32As early as 1913, Marie Bernays pointed out that the expectations linked to the study of economics as a door-opener to superior jobs had been disappointed. She looks back on the debate about women’s access to universities and recalls that many experts expected women to be able to secure jobs in the increasingly professionalized field of social work. However, this materialized only for very few women (Bernays, 1913, 271). Most of the jobs in this field, according to Bernays’ (1913, 273-274) judgment, did not correspond to the academic education the women had received—neither in view of the possibility to apply their qualifications nor with regard to remuneration.\n\n33During World War I, some women economists were able to enter into demanding jobs. Gertraud Wolf (1889-?) became head of the department for women’s work in the Bavarian War Ministry in 1917 (Bergmeier, 1997, 185). Marie-Elisabeth Lüders (1878-1966) headed the Women’s Office (Frauenreferat) of the German War Administration and was in charge of the coordination of women’s employment in wartime jobs and the child care linked to it (Ryan Van Zee, 2009, 102 and below). Charlotte Lorenz (1895-1979) worked at the Central Office for German-Turkish Economic Affairs and could draw on the expertise she had acquired on the Ottoman Empire in her studies. She moved on to the War Raw Materials Office and after the war and her graduation, she had a career at the Statistical Office (Reichsstatistikamt), which she could combine with her academic work (Schulze Schleithoff, 2018, 151 and below, section 4).\n\n34However, in the Weimar years, the professional opportunities for women economists did not improve significantly and across the board. Elisabeth Altmann-Gottheiner (1931, 217) characterized the prospects for female economists as “by no means brilliant”. The professional association of women economists in Germany, founded in 1916, conducted regular surveys in the 1920s, which Gabi Förder-Hoff (1992, 159-160) analyzed 30 to 50 percent of the women surveyed were employed in the field of social work, about 20 percent worked for companies and business associations. Teaching, journalism and academia each accounted for about ten percent of the women covered. However, the association found it impossible to estimate the share of unemployed female economists and suggested that many female economists accepted jobs for financial reasons that would not have required academic training. In the early years of the Weimar Republic, the activists of the women’s movement hoped for the employment of women in permanent public-sector jobs in the administration of social services. This expectation was disappointed, not least by repeated campaigns discrediting “double income” couples and putting pressure on married women to resign or refrain from applying for jobs.\n\n36After her marriage in 1917 Elisabeth Flitner suspended her studies. The dissertation, which was already under way, was submitted at the university of Jena in 1925. Elisabeth Flitner had four children. In 1929 the family moved to Hamburg where her husband became professor. She taught courses in continuing education (Volkshochschule) and was active in various women’s associations. During the National Socialist years, she was denied public activity as she was classified part Jewish according to the racist legislation. The family was fortuitous in that her husband retained his university position in those years. After 1945, Flitner returned to work in adult education. Furthermore, she taught in the teacher training program of the university in Hamburg on a per course basis, in the same institute in which her husband held a professorship. Again, she became involved in several organizations concerned with women’s causes. From 1953 onward she worked for the German association for the protection of children (Kinderschutzbund).\n\n37Reviewing her biography in light of the arguments brought forward by the economists who supported women studying at universities, Elisabeth Flitner fulfilled several of their expectations. She was committed to social causes all through her life, contributed to the professionalization of organizations drawing on voluntary work by women through the expertise she acquired through her studies. Furthermore, she taught economics to non-specialists. All these aspects conform to what Herkner had spelled out in 1899. A large share of her work was voluntary and made possible by a marriage to a gainfully employed husband.\n\n39Many more female economists of the generation of Elisabeth Flitner where similarly motivated in their studies and research work. The examples below mention women whose life work had a lasting influence. Their biographies were unpredictable and had little in common with the straightforward careers that some might have envisioned when they took up university studies.\n\nMarie Bernays (1883-1939) studied economics at the university of Heidelberg. She became a student of Max Weber. Her doctoral dissertation, published in 1910, was written under his supervision. Bernays was the first woman to deliver an address at the biannual meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik in 1911 (see above). Bernays was active in the women’s and social reform movement in Mannheim. Together with Elisabeth Altmann-Gottheiner (see below) she founded a women’s school for social work in Mannheim in 1916, in 1928 she became the school’s headmaster. In 1921-1925 she was a member of the parliament of Baden for the national-liberal party (DVP). In 1933 she lost her position as headmaster based on the racist National Socialist legislation. She found refuge in the Benedictaine cloister Beuron, where she taught and worked as a librarian.\n\nMarie-Elisabeth Lüders (1878-1966) studied economics at the university of Berlin and graduated with a doctoral degree in 1912. As mentioned above, she headed the Women's office of the German War administration in 1916. In 1919, Lüders was a member of the German National Assembly for the liberal party (DDP). In 1920-1921 and 1924-1930 she was a member of the parliament (Reichstag) and campaigned for equal rights for women in various areas. In 1933, she was banned from publishing and professional activities. In 1947 she returned to Berlin and contributed in various capacities to the reconstruction of the social services. From 1953-1961 she was a member of the West German parliament, again fighting for equal rights for women. As a member of the liberal party (FDP) and chairwoman of the party’s women's committee she contributed significantly to party work. In 1958 she was made an honorary citizen of Berlin.\n\nAlice Salomon (1872-1948) studied economics at Berlin’s university from 1902. In 1906 she was the first woman to earn a doctoral degree in economics, as mentioned in section 1 above. From an early age, she was active in the women’s and social reform movements and took over leading roles in the respective organizations. She aimed at a professionalization of social work, first through yearly courses and from 1908-1925 as director of her newly founded school for social work. In 1909-1933 she was secretary of the International Women's Federation. In 1920 she designed the state examination regulation for the social women's schools, which had a lasting influence on education for social work in Germany. Based on the National Socialist’s racist legislation, she lost all her offices on 1933. She was expelled in 1937 and emigrated to England and the United States.\n\n40Two women of this generation were pioneers as academic teachers:\n\nCharlotte Engel-Reimers (1870-1930) was an activist in the German women’s movement and, in 1902, co-founder of the “Deutscher Verein für Frauenstimmrecht”. She studied at the university of Berlin. She graduated with a doctoral degree, assessed by Gustav Schmoller and Arthur Spiethoff, in 1906, i.e. in the same year as Alice Salomon. From 1914 to her death she was an assistant of Max Sering at the university of Berlin and taught courses in this capacity. In 1926 she submitted her habilitation treatise. The procedure was delayed due to the resistance of two members of the economics department. Eventually she was admitted in 1928 and her treatise was positively evaluated. The habilitation was approved in 1930. Severely ill, she died in the same year and before she could deliver her inaugural lecture at the university (Altenstraßer, 2010, 247-248).\n\nElisabeth Altmann-Gottheiner (1874-1930) studied economics at the LSE, Berlin and Zürich where she graduated with a doctoral degree in 1902. In 1908 she was the first female economist to receive a lectureship, she taught at the commercial college in Mannheim. In 1925 she was awarded an honorary title as professor. It is remarkable that she received this honor without habilitation (Günther, 2010, 24). Altmann-Gottheiner, who was active in the women’s movement since her student days in Berlin, in 1912 became the editor of and was a frequent contributor to the publications of the “Bund deutscher Frauenvereine”.\n\n41The women of the second generation of female economists presented in this section studied economics at a young age and earned doctoral degrees, in contrast to the pioneers introduced above, who came to university later in their lives and were accepted as guest students only. Like the women of the first generation, they were all active in the women’s and social reform movement. Their professional activities, their many publications and public appearances were in line with this commitment. The fact that the following generations of female economics students had the opportunity to attend courses with the female academic teachers Elisabeth Altmann-Gottheiner and Charlotte Engel-Reimers was an important influence, as is documented by autobiographical texts. Both of them were praised as excellent lecturers.\n\n4. The Changing Field of Economics in the Weimar Years: A Few Women of the Third Generation of Female Economists Gain a Foothold in Academia\n\n42When the opening up of professional paths for women was discussed in the decades before World War I, the access to academic careers with the ultimate aim of becoming a full professor was not raised. Hiltrud Häntzschel (1997) suggests several reasons for this omission. The German universities were hierarchical institutions with the elite of professors at the summit. The tenured positions were well paid, implied power within the institution and high social esteem. The process leading up to them was unregulated and there were very few full-time positions to provide an income while working on the qualification for university lectureships (habilitation and venia legendi). The aspirants often relied on family wealth or meager incomes. They were expected to produce a habilitation treatise, a book-length study of outstanding quality. The professors at the candidate’s institution first decided over the admission of the candidate to the process, only then the evaluation of the submitted research started. The decisions reflected whom the established professors considered suitable to be endowed with the privilege to teach at their own university. The next career step, namely to be elected into a tenured position at a different university, again required good will and recommendations of those professors familiar with the candidate. Not surprisingly, these structures lead to a homogenous circle of men equipped with the privilege to teach and with the positions of professor (Häntzschel, 1997, 85).\n\n43These characteristics of the qualification path and the elitist airs at the universities, might well explain why a debate about the access of women to university teaching positions took place only in 1912 in the allied organizations of female students in Germany. However, the representatives of the member associations could not agree on a joint demand for a lectureship for women, despite the fact that there were already some women teaching at Austrian, Swiss and German universities at the time.\n\n44The mood changed after World War I certainly not least as a result of women’s right to vote and the implied move towards political equality. As mentioned above, in 1919 Emmy Noether was granted the qualification of university lecturer and the right to teach at the university of Göttingen. Several other universities endowed women with the same rights in 1919. Nonetheless, in 1925 there were only 25 women holding a habilitation at German universities across all fields, in 1929 the number had increased to 40 and in 1933 there were 56 female lecturers with habilitation in Germany. While women accounted for 16 percent of students in that year, only 0.13 percent of lecturers were female. Only two women were endowed with a full professorship during the Weimar years, while a number held the title of professor as associate non-tenured lecturers (außerordentliche Professorin) or through honorary titles (Lohschelder, 1994, 189-190 and 192).\n\n47Charlotte Lorenz (1895-1979) grew up in Berlin, left school with a university entrance exam in 1914 and studied economics, modern languages and oriental studies at the university of Berlin. In 1919 she graduated with a doctoral dissertation on the situation of women, especially of the working classes, in the Ottoman empire, with Heinrich Herkner and Max Sering as supervisors. In the following years, Lorenz was able to combine her scientific work with jobs in the administration and from 1921 employment at the statistical office (Statistisches Reichsamt). In 1927 she submitted her habilitation treatise on wholesale price indices and was granted the privilege to teach at the university of Berlin in the same year. When her first reader, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz (1868-1931) died in 1931, Lorenz was assigned to teach statistics in his place, but without a professorship. In 1937 she was appointed associate professor (non-tenured, außerordentliche Professorin) and in 1939 she was finally tenured, although at the rank of associate professor (beamtete außerplanmäßige Professorin). The fact that she had joined the National Socialist party (NSDAP) in 1933 was certainly conducive to her advancement (Schulze-Schleithoff, 2018, 151-153). After the war, Lorenz continued her academic career with only a short interruption. In 1947 she became professor at the university of Göttingen.\n\n48In her doctoral dissertation in 1919, Charlotte Lorenz presented her research on women and social policy-issues. This was fairly typical at the time, as was outlined above (section 3). She quickly moved on to other topics. Her specialization in statistics, in conjunction with working for the government’s statistical office, took her to the topical questions of the time. In her treatise on whole-sale price indices, she reviewed the controversial debates on the construction of indices with an emphasis on method and on the different fields of application of index numbers. Furthermore, she worked on international trade, a field that was also of particular interest for the recovery of the German economy in the 1920s. After 1933 she devoted herself to the statistics of consumption. Lorenz repeatedly discussed the purpose and uses of statistical analysis and in particular the relationship between statistics and government. Lorenz was convinced of the importance of sound statistical information and analysis for governments to reach their political goals and that statistics should serve the government’s purposes. She was obviously willing to serve the National Socialists´ policy goals after 1933, notably in preparation and during the war (Schulze Schleithoff, 2018, 168).\n\n49In the 1940s and especially after Charlotte Lorenz’s relocation to the university of Göttingen, she focused her research on population statistics. To this day, her publications on the development of the number of university students and graduates (1943) and her study on female teaching staff at German universities (1953) are appreciated and quoted. She also wrote textbooks in those years. Furthermore, she published book reviews regularly which shows that she continued to pay attention to the ongoing debates in her field.\n\n50During her long career, the research interests of Charlotte Lorenz changed, in part due to her understanding of the role of statistics in supporting governments to pursue their respective goals. The subjects of her statistical research adjusted accordingly. There is no particular focus on women-related topics, apart from her dissertation topic in 1919 and the 1953 study on female university lecturers. The specialization in statistics was certainly conducive to her sustained career. The field was growing and repositioning itself at the time. While it was at the margin of the discipline of economics when Lorenz entered it in the early 1920s, it received increasing attention and gained importance in the following decades. Lorenz was fortunate to be able to combine her academic career with her work for the statistical office. Until 1939, when she was finally tenured as university professor, she received the bulk of her income from the statistical office. At the same time, the combination allowed her to adjust her research subjects to what she perceived to be the fields of interest of the government through her practical work. Her research on consumption statistics was inspired by the insight of its importance in particular in the situation of war. In 1936 she published an essay on how statistical data collection and analysis should be adjusted in view of the needs to support the population in wartime, which seems timely, given the National Socialist war preparation. When Lorenz turned to population statistics in the late 1940s, she ignored the entanglement of the field and of many researchers in it with the National Socialists. In her own work, Lorenz did not critically reflect on e.g. the categories applied and the ideology underlying them (Schulze Schleithoff, 2018, 175-181).\n\n52In her dissertation, Charlotte von Reichenau analyzed the thinking of the Christian Socialist Wilhelm Weitling. It is noteworthy that the results of her research, published as an article in the journal “Schmoller’s Jahrbuch” in 1925, brought about some debate. The research for her habilitation treatise was devoted to business cycle theory and published as a book in 1932. In 1933 she was the only woman to be invited to contribute to the “Festschrift” for Arthur Spiethoff. The volume contained essays by many prominent business cycle theorists, including e.g. Friedrich August von Hayek and John Maynard Keynes. Working on business cycle theory, Reichenau had thus entered one of the thriving fields of research in the interwar years and she succeeded in it.\n\n53In 1934, Reichenau published her first article in what was to become her main research focus in the following years. Her aim was to integrate the analysis of consumption and household production into economic theory. Consumption theory, she had already argued in her book on business cycle theory, had not received the attention it deserved. She thus tried to establish the field of consumer economics in Germany, referring to similar endeavors in American economics at the time. Reichenau shared the rejection of the analysis of consumption decisions along the lines of neoclassical demand theory as inadequate. Reichenau, just as the American pioneers in the field, captured the many influences on consumption decisions by drawing on sociological approaches and combining them with economic analysis. Accordingly, Reichenau published her first articles in sociological journals. After 1939 her work on household theory and consumption decisions appeared frequently in “Hauswirtschaftliche Jahrbücher”, a periodical that was edited under the responsibility of the National Socialist women’s organization in those years.\n\n55Of the seven women who had gone through the process of habilitation between 1920 and 1933, only Charlotte Lorenz and Gertrud Savelsberg (see footnote 26) received tenured professorships at the rank of associate professors. Charlotte Leubuscher and Käthe Bauer-Mengelberg were expelled by the National Socialists on the basis of the racist legislation. Von Reichenau was given employment as a librarian, Eva von Trütschler-Flügge did not continue in academia after she left the university of Berlin in 1937 and Charlotte Engel-Reimers died in the same year she was granted the official privilege to teach. The examples presented in this section show that research and teaching of this generation of women reflected the development of the field of economics at the time. The idea that women had specific qualities which prejudiced the fields they would or should turn to, seems to have lost appeal. Elisabeth Liefmann-Keil, whose work will be reviewed in the next section, started out with research in theoretical economics in her dissertation and habilitation treatise. She then moved on to the apparently female field of social policy, but she took her theoretical interests with her and contributed to redefine the research area.\n\n5. The Application of Economic Theory to Analyze Social Policy: Drawing Out Some Lines to the Decades After World War II\n\n56The discipline of economics in Germany in the interwar years is usually characterized as going through a crisis: the historical-ethical approach of Schmoller and the early Verein für Socialpolitik was denounced as outdated, but those who had been educated in the tradition were still around. Those who had worked on social issues could contribute little to solving the economic problems that the Weimar Republic faced. Given the new political majorities and the legislation it made possible, the quest for social reform as devised by Schmoller and his disciples seemed outdated. However, the demise of the tenets of the historical-ethical school had started much earlier. While the school was certainly powerful earlier, by the turn of the century the critics gained weight. The interwar years were an era of transition in German economics and while parts of the discipline seemed in decline, other parts emerged with new issues raised and new approaches developing. The review of the work of Charlotte Lorenz and Charlotte von Reichenau in the previous section exemplifies this claim.\n\n57At the turn to the twentieth century, the development of German economics within the Verein für Socialpolitik was driven by the critics of Schmoller’s research program such as Werner Sombart and Max Weber. They questioned the agenda to always look at economic phenomena through the lens of social reform and strove for a broader outlook and for a strictly scientific orientation. Furthermore, economists who taught at the newly founded commercial colleges and business schools rejected the social reformist stance in favor of liberal policy positions. At the 1905 annual meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik held in Mannheim, these differences became clear. The question of the importance of cartels and of their relationship to the government lead to a controversial debate. Nau (1996, 46-47) argues that these discussions foreshadow the upcoming controversy on the role of valuation in research. Furthermore, several participants argued that economic theory in its own right should receive more attention at the meetings of the Verein, instead of the sole emphasis on applied research so far. For the first time in 1909, one of the keynotes on the annual meeting was devoted to a theoretical topic. Eugen von Philippovich (1858-1917), professor in Vienna, gave a lecture on the nature of economic productivity. This prompted Werner Sombart and Max Weber to criticize the evaluative concept of productivity common at the time (Rieter, 2002, 152-153). According to Weber, the classical focus on the wealth of the nation or the neoclassical on efficiency contained value judgements just as much as did the social reformist positions of the German historical school. Weber insisted on an extensive debate of the issues surrounding valuation at one of the future meetings of the Verein. It took place only in 1913/14 and figures in the literature as “Werturteilsstreit”.\n\n58The issues raised in the debate were particularly relevant for the field of social policy on which the original goals of the association rested. Another important influence on the conception of social policy was the specialization in sub-disciplines within economics, which increased significantly in the decades around the turn to the twentieth century. While the early publications of the Verein covered a broad spectrum of topics to be discussed in light of social policy, the subject area was narrowed down after the turn of the century. Otto von Zwiedineck-Südenhorst (1871-1957) published a book on “social policy” in 1911, which serves to illustrate this claim. He explicitly distinguished his work from the existing literature and emphasized his ambition to shed light on the “factual” material. At the same time, he relegated value judgments reflecting the author’s ideals to the sidelines. He justified this approach by interpreting social policy as a sociological phenomenon and presented social policy as a result of historical development. Historical causes of social policy and the effects of social policy were at the center of his attention. While Schmoller emphasized the contradiction between the creation of wealth in capitalism and social policy, Zwiedinek-Südenhorst (1911, IV) claimed that social policy can be understood as an aspect of the development of societies under certain circumstances. Social policy, according to Zwiedinek-Südenhorst (1911, 38), is directed towards securing the purposes of society. However, he does not specify what these purposes contain, i.e. he moves away from the substantial ethical position of the early Verein für Socialpolitik towards a formal definition of the goals of social policy (Janssen, 2016, 85). He thus takes an important step in the direction of a modern social-sciences approach, while reserving an important role for historical studies.\n\n59In his 1920 textbook, Ludwig Heyde (1888-1961) took another important step in specifying the definition of social policy as an area of inquiry. He defined it as a branch of government policy and sketched the historical emergence of social policy only briefly. The bulk of the book is devoted to presenting the concrete state measures. Although his contribution falls short of a theory-based analysis of these measures, he prepares the ground for such an approach by categorizing and characterizing how social policy is implemented.\n\n60Elisabeth Liefmann-Keil takes the final step to an economic analysis of social policy in her book published in 1961. I will first present her contribution to redefining the field of social policy and turn to her biography in the second half of this section. By writing an “economic theory of social policy” she continues on the path opened up by Heyde. Her contribution can also be set in the context of the increase in sociological research on social policy and of the growing importance of sociologists in advising politicians and state administration (e.g. Achinger, 1958). Elisabeth Liefman-Keil draws on insights from different traditions of economic analysis and develops a synthesis. She applies the tools of microeconomic analysis to social policy issues and approaches the political dimension of social policy decisions through the lens of public choice analysis. Liefmann-Keil’s work is decisive for the reception of this field of analysis in the German-speaking countries.\n\n61In contrast to the books mentioned so far, social policy institutions do not prejudice the structure of her presentation of the material. Liefmann-Keil treats social policy as a sub-field of economic policy and highlights the distinction between goals, instruments and strategy. The goals of social policy are determined in the political process and economic analysis takes them as given. However, Liefmann-Keil emphasizes the interaction between goals and instruments and thus challenges a simplistic distinction between goals and instruments (Liefmann-Keil, 1961, 3). She concludes that the decision on instruments modifies the initial policy goals. Liefmann-Keil (1961,13) refers to “justice” as the abstract yardstick of any social policy. She relates the idea to income distribution and claims that it has to be specified in each application. Liefmann-Keil does away with the distinction between primary (functional) income and personal income distribution, which is supposed to result from redistributive government measures. Therefore, the second part of the book is devoted to the “so-called redistribution” of income. Liefmann-Keil emphasizes that government policies change the distribution but they also affect the production decisions underlying the initial situation. John Stuart Mill (1848) introduced the distinction between production as determined by quasi-natural laws and distribution as resulting from institutions. As Liefman-Keil rejects this perspective she analyses the interplay between government policy and individual decisions with the help of public choice theory. The third part of the book is devoted to the application of these tools on the regulation of wages and working conditions. Liefmann-Keil turns to the international context of social policy in the fourth part of the book and concludes with a brief outlook on future developments in the field.\n\n62Goldschmidt and Klinckowstroem (2005) show in detail that Liefmann-Keil’s work is thoroughly anchored in the ordoliberal tradition of the Freiburg School. As a student of Walter Eucken her approach presumes that economic and social policy are quintessentially intertwined. Eucken perceived social policy as one of the “regulating principles”, alongside external effects and monopoly control, to complement the “constituting principles” of the market economy (Hagemann, 2008). His thinking shaped the concept of social market economy and inspired the policies devised by Ludwig Erhard, minister of economic affairs from 1949 to 1963 and German chancellor from 1963 to 1966. His name and his ordoliberal policy positions are remembered as cornerstones of the “German miracle”, the recovery of the German economy after World War II and the impressive growth in the 1960s.\n\n64She had joined the economics faculty in January 1946 as a research assistant and held a tenured lectureship from 1947 onward. In 1949 she was awarded the title of professor (außerplanmäßige Professorin). From 1952-1954 Liefmann-Keil received a Rockefeller-stipend, which allowed her to spend research time in the US, England, Sweden and Norway and at the International Labor Office in Geneva.\n\n65Next to research and teaching, she was a highly esteemed policy consultant all through her career. Already in 1947 she was a member of the scientific committee which was to become the advisory council of the federal ministry of economic affairs. From 1950 onward, she contributed to the reform debates on social policy and in particular to the reform of the health insurance system.\n\n66In 1956 she became a fully endowed professor of economics at the university of Saarbrücken. She was the first female economics professor and only the second woman in Germany to be entrusted with a full professorship. Despite an offer by the Free University in Berlin, she stayed there for the rest of her life. Unfortunately, Liefmann-Keil was severely injured in an accident in 1974 and was not able to return to her active life afterwards. She died in 1975.\n\n6. Concluding Remarks and Questions for Future Research\n\n67To which extent were the research topics pursued by female economists specific of women? Those members of the historical-ethical school, who supported the demands that women should be accepted as regular students at the universities, expected women to be especially qualified for empirical research in the fields that were less accessible for their male peers. Herkner (1899) spelled out this expectation and supervised many doctoral dissertations by women on e.g. the working conditions of women in particular fields of employment. Women took up these opportunities, in part expecting their study and research to prepare them for social work, at first in honorary occupations, but more and more in view of breadwinning jobs. After World War I, many developments came together to alter the outlook of women on academic work. The first women were granted the privilege to teach at university level in 1919 and several female economists set out on an academic career. The examples discussed in the paper show that research topics were no longer restricted to the areas focused by the historical-ethical school as adequate for women, namely research on women from the perspective of social policy broadly defined. Female economists entered several of the subdisciplines of economics and contributed to business cycle theory, to statistical research, to consumer theory, to labor market analysis, public choice analysis etc. Those who specialized in statistics seem to have been more likely to attain permanent jobs, although only at the level of associate professor. The racist and misogynist ideology of the National Socialists interrupted whatever tentative developments towards an integration of women into the discipline of economics. The effect was long lasting. In 1956 the first female economist attained a fully endowed chair in economics. She had finished her studies before 1933 and managed to advance her research during the National Socialist era, albeit without academic employment. Another few women attained permanent professorships in the 1960s.\n\n68There are many questions left open by the research presented in this paper. 1,262 doctoral degrees were awarded to women in the time span between 1908 and 1933 (Boedecker, 1937), the few cases studied in depth so far are hardly representative. Research along the lines presented by Robert Dimand, Geoffrey Black and Evelyn Forget (2011) on “Women’s participation in the ASSA meetings” and by Ann Mari May and Robert Dimand (2019) would help to supplement the account presented here. A comparative perspective would allow us to identify the specifics of the German developments. While the participation of women at the American Economic Association’s meetings decline in the interwar years as compared to the early years, before the turn of the century, no women participated at the meetings of the Verein für Socialpolitik. A systematic analysis of the women who participated at the meetings and of the membership would possibly allow to shed light on the employment of female economists outside academia.\n\nI thank the organizers and sponsors of the workshop “Women, Economics and History. Diversity within Europe” (Paris, November 2021) for providing an inspiring space for exchange and discussion.
