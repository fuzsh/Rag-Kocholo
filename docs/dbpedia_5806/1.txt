This paper examines the war aims advocated during the First World War by Lujo Brentano, one of the founding members of the Verein für Sozialpolitik, the organization serving as the forum for the sociopolitical activities of the Kathedersozialisten. Though Brentano's career has been surveyed, James J. Sheehan's necessarily brief account of his attitudes and conduct during the First World War does not fully explore the impact of wartime annexationism on Brentano. A lifelong Anglophile and advocate of liberal ideals in social, economic, and political questions, Brentano serves as a case study of the impact of nationalism in times of stress on individuals who, on the basis of their previous record, might have been expected to be more resistant to its appeals.

6. Ibid., 316–17. The proclamation was first published in the Kölnische Zeitung of Oct. 4, 1914. It was republished within the context of an edition of the letters exchanged between two French scholars and Brentano in this matter, which was brought out by the German League of Scientists and Artists (Künstler, Kulturbund deutscher Gelehrter und: Briefwechsel zwischen den Herren Yves Guyot und Daniel Bellet und Herrn Lujo Brentano [Berlin, 1914], iii–viGoogle Scholar, hereafter cited as Guyot-Bellet). Instrumental in arranging for the translation and publication of these letters were the Progressive deputy Georg Gothein and the leader of the Center party, Matthias Erzberger.

11. Ludwig Quidde to Brentano, Munich, Nov. 18, 1914, BN 49. Brentano had said that “even if Kant welcomed the French Revolution, he still captured the spirit of Frederick the Great in his famous Categorical Imperative …” (Guyot-Bellet, 17). Schmoller had also been attacked as one of the signers of the declaration, although the French were not surprised about his involvement because they attributed to him an ingrained hatred for the French. (Guyot-Bellet, 2, 19–20.) Schmoller strongly resented this insinuation and Brentano unequivocally supported Schmoller, refusing to have a wedge driven between them.

Ernest Mahaim to Brentano, Cointe (Schlessin), Oct. 8, 1918, “Mais je suis au regret de vous fire connaître qu'en apposant votre signature au ‘manifeste de l' Allemagne intellectuelle au monde civilisé’ (Gazette de Cologne, 20 édition du matin, Oct. 4, 1914) vous avez brisé vous-même les liens qui nous unissaient. Veuillez agréer etc.,” BN 40. Noël Sabord, Paris-Midi and Le Figaro, to Brentano, Paris, Oct. 8, 1926. After asking Brentano whether he would sign another manifesto now declaring Germany pacifist and in changed spirits, the editor asked: “Dans l'affirmative, si vous n'estimez pas qu'il incomberait aux intellectuels allemands dont vous êtes d'exprimer solennellement les sentiments de l'Allemagne de 1926 comme ils le firent pour celle de 1914?” BN 48.

21. Before the war he based his opposition on the fact that Germany needed Alsace as the liberal yeast in the conservative Prussian dough. (Brentano to Ludwig Quidde, Munich, May 21, 28, 1913, BN 49.) During the war he supplemented this argument with claims of the strategic importance of the provinces for the defense of Germany's western border.

22. So he wrote to Graf Hoensbroech, the renegade Jesuit and popular publicist: “Your memorandum could create the impression that the German Reich intends to incorporate large non-German speaking territories into its territories in case of peace. I would con sider that the greatest misfortune that could befall Germany.” (Brentano to Graf Hoensbroeck, Munich, Nov. 28, 1914, BN 25.)

23. Verein Deutsche Rheinmündung to Brentano, Berlin, June 28, 1913, BN 72. The Verein, which listed as its patrons aside from the magistrates of many cities along the Rhine also the names of the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, Norddeutscher Lloyd, and Bayer Leverkusen, invited Brentano and his colleagues Lotz and Amira to found a branch organization at Munich. The draft of Brentano's negative answer appears without a date on the reverse side of this letter.

25. Brentano to Georg Gothein, Munich, Dec. 9, 1914, Bundesarchiv Koblenz, Nachlass Gothein, no. 16. Brentano quoted an article of the Frankfurter Zeitung, “Der Krieg und Bernard Shaw” (Dec. 6, 1914). This article was based on George Bernard Shaw's scathing analysis of militarism English-style in The New Statesman. (Shaw, George Bernard, “Common Sense about the War,” The New Statesman [11 14, 1914], Special War Supplement), 1–30Google Scholar. Friedrich von Bernhardi was a German general whose 1912 publication Germany and the Next War had received wide publicity in the allied countries as an example of Pan-Germanism and German aggressiveness.

27. Brentano to Ludwig Nieder, Munich, Sept. 30, 1915 (draft) BN 46. Ludwig Nieder was a former pupil of Brentano, who was active in Catholic social work in München-Gladbach. He had suggested the annexation of Belgium to rule out Anglo-French influence there after the war. (Ludwig Nieder to Brentano München-Gladbach, Oct. 19, 1915, BN 46.)

60. Brentano to Maximilian von Harden, Munich, Apr. 27, May 20, 1917, Bundesarchiv Koblenz, Nachlass Harden, Heft 2: “I am aware of the terrible state of affairs in the top offices of the land—the only mitigating factor is that it seems to be the same with the enemy.” Harden was in trouble with the censor because of his criticisms of the imperial decision to postpone the promised reforms of the Easter Message until the end of the war.

The article that led to the five-month suspension in June 1917 implicitly placed the guilt for the fact that no peace negotiations were under way then on Germany. von Harden, Maximilian, “Vor dem vierten Thor,” Die Zukunft 25, no. 39 (06 30, 1917), esp. p. 354.Google Scholar
