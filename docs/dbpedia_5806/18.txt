That Lujo Brentano was a representative thinker of liberal social reform in the second German Empire (1871-1918) is well known. Born of an old Italian aristocratic family in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, in 1844, he studied law and economics in Göttingen, then entered the Prussian Office of Statistics in Berlin. Die Arbeitergilden der Gegenwart (2 vols, 1871-2), the product of his study in England in 1868, established his position in the German academic world. Concurrent with the publication of this book, he served as a lecturer at the University of Berlin (1871) and as an associate professor at the University of Breslau (1872). In 1873 he played a role in the founding of the Verein für Sozialpolitik. As this activity shows, Lujo Brentano’s career as a social scientist and a social reformer began in the early 1870s.1
