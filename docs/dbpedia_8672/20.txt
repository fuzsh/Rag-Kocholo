Actor Michael Caine is publishing his first book since his 2010 autobiography The Elephant to Hollywood (Hodder) in his 85th year this October.

Rowena Webb at Hodder & Stoughton acquired world English rights to Blowing the Bloody Doors Off – And Other Lessons in Life from Caroline Michel at PFD.

In the book, Caine will share "wisdom, insight and amazing stories" from a life in acting, having starred in over 100 films over six decades.

The book was bought jointly with executive editor Paul Whitlatch at Hachette Books in the US and will be published simultaneously there.

Webb said: "Caine is an absolute legend, a wonderful writer, and has a treasure trove of advice and stories to share. I’m thrilled to be publishing what I’m sure will be another classic bestseller with him in his 85th year."

Whitlatch added: "Few could claim a generation- and globe-spanning fan base like Michael Caine. I am deeply excited to be publishing this book—a wisdom-filled inside look at the roles and experiences that made him who he is."
