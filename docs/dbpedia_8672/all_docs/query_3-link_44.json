        "text": "Nobody can play an English gentleman quite like Sir Michael Caine. The veteran actor’s famous Cockney accent has popped up in everything from Woody Allen movies (Hannah and Her Sisters, for which he won an Oscar) to the new Christopher Nolan Batman franchise (as Alfred, Christian Bale’s butler) to Austin Powers 3. He is revered among fellow actors for his 1987 BBC acting workshop, where he taught young wannabes that the secret to a strong performance is not blinking. That trick bought him six Oscar nominations and two wins for Best Supporting Actor. Caine noticed his wife Shakira Baksh when she appeared in a coffee commercial, and they have been married for 40 years.\n\nNext Dianne Feinstein\n\nTIME presents its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world, from artists and leaders to pioneers, titans and icons"
