        "text": "Oscar-winning actor Michael Caine is giving fans the chance to own mementos of his illustrious film career.\n\nPersonal items including the 88-year-old star’s gold Rolex watch – estimated to fetch as much as £12,000 ($16,300) – and paintings from his personal collection will go under the hammer in London on March 2.\n\nCharlie Thomas, director of house sales and iconic collections at Bonhams, which is handling the sale, told CNN on Monday: “Sir Michael Caine has an appeal that defies any age demographic or nationality, his films are part of 20th-century history and whoever the successful bidders are, they will own a piece of that history, an item with unrivaled provenance.”\n\nAccording to the UK’s Times newspaper, “The Italian Job” star is reluctantly selling off many of his beloved items as he and his wife, Shakira, are downsizing from a mansion in Surrey, southeast England.\n\nCNN has contacted Caine’s representatives for comment.\n\nThomas described the auction – which includes a director’s chair from the 1971 crime film “Get Carter,” in which Caine starred as gangster Jack Carter, and even a pair of the actor’s famous spectacles – as one of Bonhams’ most personal sales to date.\n\nHe told CNN: “Sir Michael has collected these items over many decades and has always bought what he loves rather than for any other reason, and this makes this collection so incredibly special.”\n\nOther stand-out pieces include a portrait of Caine by English painter Lincoln Townley, which is being sold in aid of child protection charity NSPCC, as well as a film poster for the 1966 romantic comedy “Alfie,” which earned Caine an Oscar nomination for best actor.\n\nFrom his art collection, Caine is selling “Les Amoureux Dans L’Arbre” by Marc Chagall, which is expected to sell for as much as £50,000 ($68,000).\n\n“It’s going to be quite a wrench to part with so many treasured parts of my life and career, but it’s the right time to be moving on,” Caine said in a press release, adding: “I hope these mementos will give their new owners as much pleasure as they have given us.”"
