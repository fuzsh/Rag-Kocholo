        "text": "Michael Caine was doing the eye thing. It’s a trick of his, developed over years of film performances and close-ups: Let your gaze rest on your scene partner, but only with one eye. The other eye, the one closest to the camera, can connect with the lens. The camera “will not miss anything,” he said, “including the bad. So you have to watch it.”\n\nOf course there is little bad when Mr. Caine, 79, is on screen. In more than six decades of work he has been a sterling presence — even in less-than-sterling films — inimitable except that so many have tried. (In the BBC series “The Trip” the comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon do a riff on his Cockney accent and measured delivery that is as hysterical as it is accurate.)\n\nMr. Caine is asking for it, though: In 1987 he led an acting workshop for the BBC that has since become a touchstone for performers, absorbed by everyone from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jim Carrey. It contains one of the Caine-iest — which is to say the simplest — bits of acting wisdom, a surefire path to a heightened dramatic moment: Do. Not. Blink.\n\n“Not blinking,” Mr. Caine said, “is strength. If you want to be weak or funny, blink.”\n\n“I think I blinked twice during this interview,” he added, jokingly, sitting in a private room in the Four Seasons restaurant before a recent luncheon in honor of “The Dark Knight Rises,” the final installment of Christopher Nolan’s Batman series. As Alfred, the loyal butler and father figure to Bruce Wayne, Mr. Caine has served as a conscience and a consigliere, shepherding and humanizing the hero, played with chiseled — unblinking — intensity by Christian Bale.\n\nIt was a part he quickly accepted at the start of the franchise, Mr. Caine said, when Mr. Nolan turned up at the door of his home in England one Sunday morning, carrying an early copy of the script for “Batman Begins,” the 2005 kickoff to the series, and demanding, for secrecy’s sake, that Mr. Caine read it on the spot. “He had written great parts for real actors,” Mr. Caine said, “rather than ciphers who are in big special-effects movies, because they haven’t gotten enough money to pay any actors.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
