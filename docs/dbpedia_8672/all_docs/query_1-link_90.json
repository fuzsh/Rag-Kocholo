        "text": "London - The movie actor Michael Caine was knighted by Queen Elizabeth yesterday in recognition of his services to drama, but there was some confusion afterwards about what to call him. He was knighted under his real name, not his stage name, so officially he is now Sir Maurice Joseph Micklewhite. A royal official said he could, however, call himself Sir Michael if he wanted to.\n\nAsked after the ceremony, at Buckingham Palace, which form of address he preferred, the Oscar-winning actor said: \"I'm both, but I will use Sir Michael Caine.\""
