        "text": "Legendary actor Michael Caine says he's retiring from acting.\n\nThe two-time Academy Award winner said in a new interview with BBC Radio 4 that his new movie, \"The Great Escaper,\" may be his last.\n\n\"I keep saying I'm going to retire,\" Caine said. \"Well, I am now because I've figured I've had a picture, which is I've played the lead and it's got incredible reviews.\"\n\n\"The only parts I'm likely to get now are old men ... and I thought, 'Well, I might as well leave with all this,'\" he explained.\n\nCaine admitted that he had actually turned down the role of Bernard \"Bernie\" Jordan -- the real-life World War II veteran \"The Great Escaper\" is based on -- three times but \"kept falling in love\" with the character each time he read the script.\n\n\"So I did it,\" he said.\n\nCaine also admitted he is \"very happy\" in his life, gushing about his wife of 50 years, Shakira, and his grandchildren, saying he's \"been lucky in every way.\"\n\nThe actor also said he'll be leaning into a different creative outlet in the future: writing. His first book of fiction, a thriller titled \"Deadly Game,\" releases this November.\n\nWhen asked if he'll return to acting, Caine said \"no.\"\n\n\"There'll be writing. I'll write another book sometime because I so enjoy writing,\" he said. \"With writing, you don't have to get out of bed. All you need's pencil and a bit of paper and you can start.\""
