Are these up for grabs?\n\nHere’s my Michael Caine as Alfred sculpt and painted casting. Let me know what you think!\n\nIt looks awful...\n\nAWFULLY GOOD THAT IS!\n\nA hard one to capture and you did\n\nYes indeed, this is a very difficult sculpt to do IMO.\n\nThe big forehead, the sleepy eyes, very tough to do. I do think it needs a bit more refinement, but the best Caine Alfred I've seen!\n\nCongrats Steven!\n\nI'm doing a custom JG as we speak with a FML paintup of your great Oldman sculpt. Can't wait to see pics of Les' too\n\nVery nicely done. I'd bet he has one of those faces where it could easily go wrong, but you did an amazing job with it. As everyone else has said, instantly recognizable."
