Some men just want to watch the world burn.', 'Be a duck, remain calm on the surface and paddle like hell underneath.', and 'There's only two things I hate in this world. People who are intolerant of other people's cultures and the Dutch.'",

        "text": "“you lose your temper in front of people you do not know, you lose their respect and it is almost impossible to win it back. You must keep control—if you cannot control yourself, then you have no chance of controlling others.”\n\n― Michael Caine, The Elephant to Hollywood\n\n“something I loved and trying to do it as well as I possibly could. In the end if I could give you one bit of advice, it would be that: find what you love, and do it as well as you can. Pursue your dream and, even if you never catch it, you’ll enjoy the chase. The rest comes down to luck, timing and God: even if you don’t believe in him, he believes in you. And when all of that runs out, use the difficulty.”\n\n― Michael Caine, Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: And Other Lessons in Life\n\n“I don’t want to screw up today’s work and tomorrow’s worrying about yesterday’s and I don’t want to focus on what it looks like on the outside when the performance has to come from within me. I want to be in the moment now, getting it right from the inside.”\n\n― Michael Caine, Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: And Other Lessons in Life\n\n“Instead, my biggest piece of advice to anyone just starting out, or to anyone who feels like they are taking a wrong turn along the way, is this. Find something you want to do and learn how to do it really well. Take what you got and make the most of it. Learn how to do something, whatever it is, you would choose to do for nothing. Whatever it is, when you are doing it, it makes you feel amazing and most yourself. Throw yourself into it. Challenge yourself to be the best you can be. We can’t all be famous actors. But, if you can find something you love and if that something will also pay the bills, you will be on your way to your own personal paradise.”\n\n― Michael Caine, Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: And Other Lessons in Life\n\n“In the end, if I could give you one bit of advice, it would be to find what you love and do it as well as you can. Pursue your dream. And, even if you never catch it, you’ll enjoy the chase. The rest comes down to luck, timing, and God, even if you don’t believe in Him, He believes in you.”\n\n― Michael Caine, Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: And Other Lessons in Life\n\n“I was cast as a drunkard, and at my first rehearsal I came staggering onto the stage, then swayed about a bit. The director held up his hand. “Stop. What are you doing, Michael?” “I’m drunk in this scene,” I explained, failing to hide my irritation that it had not been apparent.”\n\n― Michael Caine, Blowing the Bloody Doors Off: And Other Lessons in Life"
