        "text": "Michael has been married to former actor and model, Shakira, for over five decades now. He has talked about his relationship many times. During an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, he looked back at how he found her.\n\nTimeless love story\n\nMichael met his Shakira back in the 1970s when he saw her in a Maxwell House coffee commercial. He fell in love with her at that very moment, and decided to go to Brazil to meet her.\n\n\"I saw this lady on the television in a commercial and fell in love instantly. And it was a commercial for coffee in Brazil. I just watched her and I thought, that's the woman for me,” he said with much adoration.\n\nThe Dunkirk actor was eager to meet her, and was ready to fly to Brazil. He thought she hails from Brazil, however, he was happy to find out that she was actually from London.\n\nHe went to his friends to seek help, as he shared, “And I said to my mate, I said, we're going to Brazil in the morning. We're going to find her…. And I went down the disco to my mate there, Johnny golden in Tramp. Were sitting there and one of the guys came where are you three no girls? what's going on? Not.\"\n\nRecalling the incident, the actor said, “ I said I saw a beautiful girl on the television. I said, \"and I'm going to Brazil in the morning to find her”.\n\nIt was a Maxwell House coffee commercial. As he told his friends that he believed she is from Brazil, Michael got the happy news that “She's not Brazilian. She's Indian”, and she lives in London. The actor pursued her, and the rest is history.\n\nMore about the couple"
