        "text": "One of Watchonista’s most-read Unlikely Watch Collector articles over the past year was our profile of Sir Michael Caine. In it, we saw how the versatile actor, over a long and distinguished career, has rocked an eclectic range of timepieces, including an IWC Ingenieur 666 AD, Breitling Navitimer Aerospace Titanium, and Traser H3 Black Storm Pro.\n\nHowever, the brand that has most often graced the Londoner’s wrist (both on-screen and off) over the past seven decades has to be Rolex. After hitting the big time in the 1960s, Caine began wearing a yellow-gold Oyster Perpetual Day-Date second-series Ref. 1803, with fluted bezel and linen-textured dial, at first on a leather strap before switching to a President bracelet in the 1970s.\n\nA few months shy of his 89th birthday, the actor known for playing butler Alfred Pennyworth in The Dark Knight Trilogy and the magic engineer Cutter in The Prestige has decided to take life, as Bonhams explained, “at a more leisurely pace.” As such, Caine and his wife Shakira are “downsizing” by putting a selection of the Oscar winner’s personal possessions up for auction.\n\n“It’s going to be quite a wrench to part with so many treasured parts of my life and career, but it’s the right time to be moving on. I hope these mementos will give their new owners as much pleasure as they have given us,” said Caine.\n\nLaunched in 1977, the Oysterquartz was Rolex’s response to consumer demand fueled by the quartz era, and it was one of the first Rolex models to come with a sapphire crystal.\n\nOver the next 24 years, until it was discontinued in 2001, numerous versions of the Oysterquartz model were produced using either stainless steel, white gold, yellow gold, or a combination of stainless steel and white or yellow gold. Yet, despite its variations and 24-year production run, it is thought that fewer than 30,000 Oysterquartz watches were ever made.\n\nMade around 1979, Caine’s yellow-gold Ref. 19018 is notable for its 36mm angular case that features polished sides and a brushed surface topped by a fluted bezel. The yellow-gold bracelet features three rows of rectangular links – with the peripheral links brushed and the central links polished – and it integrates seamlessly with the case. Helping the bracelet to flow even more is its “concealed” clasp.\n\nCaine’s watch looks like it’s in good condition, bar a few scratches on the sapphire crystal at 6 o’clock and a few marks on the edge of the case, bezel, and bracelet. In any case, the new owner will be able to tell their friends that it was Michael Caine who put them there.\n\nSix dial variations were available for the Ref. 19018, and the dial on Caine’s watch is champagne-toned with a radial finish. While the day of the week at 12 o’clock was available in multiple languages, the actor understandably chose his in English. And, of course, the date window at three o’clock is magnified by a cyclops lens.\n\nAt March’s auction, Caine’s Ref. 19018 will carry an estimate of between £8,000 and £12,000, which might seem about right for an “ordinary” Ref. 19018. But given this example has been owned and worn by one of the great movie icons, we can expect it to fetch considerably more than that."
