        "text": "After making films for over 50 years, Michael Caine says his latest is his best work ever. The 82-year-old British actor tells Lesley Stahl that playing the role of Fred Ballinger in the new film \"Youth\" was also his most difficult. Caine talks about his latest movie and his incredible career on the next edition of 60 Minutes Sunday, Dec. 20 at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT.\n\n\"Secretly, I regarded it as the best thing I ever did,\" Caine says of \"Youth,\" a film about aging in which he plays a retired conductor and composer. \"It was the most difficult and the criterion for that is that I made it look the most easy,\" he says.\n\nThe octogenarian actor says he needs the challenge the role posed because, he jokes with Stahl, \"I don't get the girl anymore. All I get is grandma.\"\n\nBut he tells Stahl being a grandpa is his biggest kick. Ten years ago he began playing Alfred the butler in the Batman trilogy of films. \"My grandson looked up at me and said, 'Do you know Batman?' I said 'Yes....I know him very well.' And he told all the boys at school, 'My grandpa knows Batman. Does your grandpa know Batman?'\"\n\nThere is talk of a nomination for best actor; he would be the oldest person to win that Oscar. He has won for best supporting actor twice.\n\n\"I think it would be great for the academy to recognize old age,\" he says."
