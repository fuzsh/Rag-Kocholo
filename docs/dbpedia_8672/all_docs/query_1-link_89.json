        "text": "Fox Searchlight Pictures has acquired North American rights to the film “Youth,” starring Oscar winners Michael Caine, Rachel Weisz and Jane Fonda, and plans to release it later this year.\n\nFox Searchlight presidents Stephen Gilula and Nancy Utley made the announcement Wednesday, prior to the film’s premiere in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film is written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino, director of Italy’s Oscar foreign language entry “The Great Beauty.” Paul Dano and Harvey Keitel co-star.\n\n“I’m delighted and proud that Fox Searchlight has acquired my new film ‘Youth.’ As a movie lover, I have always appreciated Fox Searchlight’s choices which have given us the opportunity to see beautiful and unforgettable films,” said Sorrentino.\n\n“This time, as the auteur, I am honored with the faith they have placed in me and the film.”\n\nThe film follows longtime two friends vacationing in the Swiss Alps. Caine plays Fred, an acclaimed composer and conductor, who brings along his daughter (Weisz) and best friend Mick (Keitel), a renowned filmmaker. The two men reflect on their past, each finding that some of the most important experiences can come later in life.\n\n“Youth” was produced by Nicola Giuliano, Francesca Cima, Carlotta Calori for Indigo Film, in collaboration with Medusa Film. Co-producers include Fabio Conversi of Barbary Films, Jérôme Seydoux of Pathé, Stephen Woolley and Elizabeth Karlsen for Number 9, David Kosse for Film4 and Anne Walser for C-Films.\n\n“Paolo’s masterful film projects an extraordinary wisdom and grace,” said Utley and Gilula. “Anchored by Michael Caine‘s emotionally riveting performance and buoyed by an exceptional supporting cast, ‘Youth’ is, simply put, a film about life and living told in the most cinematic of terms.”\n\nThe deal was brokered by Fox Searchlight’s sr. vice-president of acquisitions and co-productions Ray Strache and executive v.p. of business affairs Megan O’Brien with Muriel Sauzay, Pathe’s executive v.p. for international sales, who represented the film."
