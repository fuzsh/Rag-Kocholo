        "text": "While we were sad to learn that Michael Caine was officially retiring from acting in 2023, his rest from the screen is well-deserved, as he has been showcasing his on-screen prowess since he was a young man.\n\nGrowing up in England, Caine, who was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, relocated with his family from London to Norfolk during WWII. It was there where we first dipped his toes into the acting pool.\n\nIn a WIRED Autocomplete Interview, Caine revealed that at 10 years old, he played the part of Cinderella’s ugly step-sisters’ father. The audience gave him a good laugh when they saw his fly was undone, and that reaction was all he needed to know he wanted to pursue the craft.\n\nCaine took to acting on the stage in 1953 before hitting the big screen in 1956 in movies like Panic in the Parlor and Hell in Korea, though he had an uncredited role in a 1946 television movie, Morning Departure. By 1966, he was earning Academy Award nominations.\n\nThe 70s, 80s and beyond brought Caine much success, though he is also widely recognized for his roles in blockbusters throughout the 2000s such as Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).\n\nHis last role prior to his retirement was in The Great Escaper (2023). In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today program, he said “I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews…What am I going to do that will beat this?”\n\n“The only parts I’m liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85,” he joked.\n\nWhile Michael Caine may longer be the young actor with his fly down in the middle of a Cinderella production, his talent and iconic films carry his legacy even past his retirement.\n\nHere, take a look at some of our favorite photos of the star as a young actor.\n\nMichael Caine young\n\n1964: Break time\n\nEven this famous star needs a pick-me-up! Here, the actor takes a break to sip on some tea while filming Zulu in 1964.\n\n1964: Family time\n\nMichael sits alongside his mother and brother in this 1964 snapshot.\n\n1965: Close up\n\nThe famed actor sports a serious look in this 1965 close up photo. Look at that smolder!\n\n1966: Michael Caine gets comfy\n\nCaine lounges across his Alfie co-stars.\n\n1966: Dazzling co-stars\n\nMichael Caine acts alongside Jane Fonda in the 1966 film, Hurry Sundown. Too much talent in one movie!\n\n1969: Side by side\n\nThe actor sits alongside Nigel Davenport in military uniforms in this shot from the film Play Dirty.\n\n1972: The coolest of cool\n\nThe actor shoots pool in this scene from 1972’s Sleuth.\n\n1972: Michael and Shakira Caine — A match made in Heaven\n\nMichael poses with Shakira, who he would marry in 1973. In a 1976 interview with PEOPLE, Shakira recalled, “He was everything I didn’t expect. I had just seen him in Get Carter (1971) and he seemed so aggressive and ruthless. Instead, I found him charming and very gentle, someone whom I’d like to spend part of my life with. Michael was at that time still very much against marriage.” The happy couple have remained together since.\n\n1975: Connery and Caine\n\nCaine stands beside Sean Connery in a scene from The Man Who Would Be King."
