        "text": "LONDON — Veteran British actor Michael Caine, a Hollywood icon with a decades-spanning career littered with awards and acclaim, revealed on Saturday that he has retired from acting at the age of 90.\n\nThe Oscar-winner bows out following another widely-praised performance in his final film, “The Great Escaper”, which was released on October 6.\n\nIn it he plays real-life World War II British veteran Bernie Jordan, who escaped from an elderly residential care home to attend 2014 D-Day celebrations in France.\n\n“I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well I am now,” Caine told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.\n\n“The only parts I’m liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85.\n\n“They’re not going to be the lead. You don’t have leading men at 90, you’re going to have young handsome boys and girls. So I thought, I might as well leave with all this.”\n\nA prolific actor known for his amiable Cockney persona and deadpan acting style, Caine has appeared in more than 160 films during his seven-decade career.\n\nPossessing one of Hollywood’s most recognisable — and imitated — voices, he has long enjoyed iconic status in Britain, where he became a defining face of the so-called Swinging Sixties.\n\nHis filmography includes classic films ranging from “Zulu” and “The Italian Job” to more recently appearing in “Interstellar” and “The Dark Knight” franchise, alongside Christian Bale.\n\nA six-time Oscar nominee — who has won two Academy Awards, in 1986 (“Hannah and Her Sisters”) and 2000 (“The Cider House Rules”) — he has also earned Golden Globes, BAFTAs and numerous other gongs.\n\nHe was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000.\n\nWorking class roots\n\nCaine’s acting retirement announcement comes a month before his first novel, “Deadly Game”, is scheduled for release.\n\nHe revealed in June that it had been a long-held ambition to write a thriller, noting it is the genre he most enjoys reading.\n\nBorn Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in 1933 — to a fish-porter father and cleaner mother — the eventual star chose his stage name in tribute to his favourite movie “The Caine Mutiny”.\n\nHe left school at 16 and held a string of odd jobs before serving in the Korean War, only turning to acting after being discharged from the army.\n\nEarly starring roles included as working-class spy Harry Palmer in the 1965 Cold War drama “The Ipcress File” and a year later as womanising Alfie Elkins in “Alfie”.\n\nIn 1971, he played gangster Jack Carter in the gritty mobland flick “Get Carter” alongside another pin-up of the time, Britt Ekland, cementing him as a household name in Britain.\n\nPrior to that, 1969’s “The Italian Job” allowed Caine to deliver one of his most memorable — and often quoted — lines.\n\n“You’re only supposed to blow the bloody doors off,” his character Charlie Croker says, as his rag-tag team prepares for an audacious gold bullion robbery in Milan.\n\nThe 1983 comedy “Educating Rita” saw him praised for his portrayal of a jaded university professor, while he featured in “The Muppet Christmas Carol” in 1992 as a singing and dancing Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nSome roles failed to impress, but Caine remained unrepentant.\n\n“I have never seen it but by all accounts it is terrible,” Caine once said of “Jaws: The Revenge” — voted the sixth worst summer movie of all time by rottentomatoes.com.\n\n“However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific,” he added."
