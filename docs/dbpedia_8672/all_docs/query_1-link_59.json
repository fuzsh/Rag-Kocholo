        "text": "Michael Caine has officially announced his retirement from acting, with the legendary British actor revealing that his role in the new film The Great Escaper will be his last.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4 after the film opened to acclaim in the U.K., the 90-year-old Caine said, “I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well I am now. I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews… What am I going to do that will beat this?”\n\nCaine added that he had intended on retiring earlier, and that he actually turned down three roles in recent years, before the opportunity to play a World War II veteran who escapes his care facility in The Great Escaper arrived. (Caine, notably, didn’t appear in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, despite being a constant in that director’s previous films.)\n\n“The only parts I’m liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85,” Caine added. “They’re not going to be the lead. You don’t have leading men at 90, you’re going to have young handsome boys and girls. So I thought, I might as well leave with all this.”\n\nCaine’s co-star in The Great Escaper, the renowned British actress Glenda Jackson, died in June after filming had completed. “I’m still grabbing every second even though I’m 90,” Caine told BBC Radio 4.\n\nTrending\n\nAlthough Caine has proclaimed that he’s retiring, IMBD has him listed for one more role, reprising his character in the third installment in the magician heist series Now You See Me, although the prolonged actors strike has stalled its production.\n\nEven at the age of 90, the nonagenarian is about to embark on a new career as novelist as Caine’s first book, a thriller titled Deadly Game that he penned during the pandemic, will arrive in November."
