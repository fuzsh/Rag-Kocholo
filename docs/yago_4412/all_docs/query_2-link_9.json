Beebijan\n\nThe ancestry traced in this Family Tree has been through the help of the older members of the family and what parents have told us when we were children. The attempt by the late Mrs.Halima Buksh, daughter o T.C.H. Marikar, to trace the family tree in Ceylon, was not very successful. She was able to trace the family of Thambi Cannu Marikar up to a point. Some of the dates are from taken from Mr. H.O.L.Marikars diary, when his daughter Ayesha was attempting to compile it in the year 1990.\n\nT. C. H. MARIKAR\n\nHe was born in Kandy, Ceylon in 1852. He belonged to an aristocratic family of ancestral landlords. In a family of eight, he was the second son of Thambi Cannu Marikar.\n\nHe was a sportsman and an athlete, his favourite game being football. Once when he was playing, the ball went into the school ground next door. It was when he went to pick it up that he met his future wife who was a teacher there. (Data collected in 1999 by Shamsu (Mohmed Ali mamas son), who was working in Colombo/ Kandy as engineer. He visited the ancestral home and met some of the surviving relatives too).\n\nShe was a padres daughter. They got married with much opposition from the powerful Marikars and the Christian community. Her married name was Ayesha. She was well versed in the Bible and in the Quran. She bore him six children.\n\nMuch later, in the 1940s, her brother and his son Chelliah writer and family migrated to Munnar and settled down there. The son was employed in Marikar & Co and the family was very close to H.O.L.Marikar & Majid Marikar who had settled down in Munnar\n\nTrade and the spirit of adventure brought (T.C.H.) to India. With his business acumen, he successfully built up his trade between India and Ceylon. He came to South India and established himself in the then States of Travancore and Cochin (Kerala) and parts of Madras Presidency (Tamil Nadu). Travelling between India and Ceylon could not have been easy-sailing in the eighties. He owned 26 dhows and did regular trips. In Travancore, he was attracted to Mundakayam and Peermadu, whose scenic beauty and climate & their similarity to Ceylon attracted him.\n\nHe started his business in Kottayam where he had a supermarket of sorts. He used to go to the mosque on horseback and that is when he fell in love with a Syrian Christian lady, who was renowned for her beauty and her long & flowing tresses. She used to watch him from the threshold of her house. One day, he carried her away on his horse. This lady, Kunjamma, was already married and had a child too, but nothing prevented the progress and fulfillment of their great romance. They married to the utter dismay, anger and embarrassment of the Syrian Christian, Chowkaparambil family, to which she belonged. Kunjammas married name became Mariambi. They stayed in Kottayam for some time and later settled down in Rich Grove estate in Mundakkayam. (Kunjammas daughter & family later settled down in Canada).\n\nHe set up his son Kasim in business in Mundakayam. It was then that Kasim was married to Meera whose daughter Mymoon was given in marriage in Ceylon. His daughter Halima was married to his brother Manzoor Shahs son Muqaddam Shah. On his death she was married to Buksh in Ceylon. Ummukulsu, another daughter was married to Jain, who was employed in a tea plantation Company in Ceylon and later came and settled down in the High Ranges of Travancore. Nachiar and Amina were also given in marriage in Ceylon. Both of them were widowed early, and as was the custom in Ceylon, the daughters came back to live in their parents home in Peermedu.\n\nTCH later met the two brothers Ibrahim Kutty and Abdul Khader, who hailed from Kannur and were doing business in Peermedu. Their friendship culminated in marriage alliances between the two families.\n\nLater on TCH sold his property in Kottayam and invested in a large acreage of land in Mundakayam. Even during his life time portions of it were taken away for bridges, roads etc. He built a big comfortable house in Rich Grove Estate where Mariam and the children lived and is still the home of that branch of the family.\n\nPeermade and Mundakayam were little known areas, with virgin forests and malaria-ridden jungles. Only the pioneering spirits of a few daring British planters and people like TCH opened new vistas of development in these places. TCH foresaw the potentialities of Peermade and made it his business centre and did a flourishing business.\n\nBeing an enthusiastic equestrian with a great love of horses, he prided himself in his horses and stables.\n\nIn 1920, after his youngest daughter Saffas marriage, TCH passed away peacefully. He was laid to rest in that part of his Rich Grove estate in Mundakayam, which he had set aside for a family graveyard.\n\nA unique personality, a daring pioneer of exemplary courage and foresight with a spirit of adventure and romance who was a link to two colonial countries of the British, he died in India, the land of his adoption.\n\nAYESHA MARIKAR\n\nLeft behind in Kandy with her six children, she no doubt found the difficulties of bringing up the children with their father across the seas. Being excellent in needlework, and teaching, she managed the household on her own in the beginning. However when it became difficult to cope any longer, she took the bold decision to come to India. TCH settled her and the children in Periyakulam where he had a trading post. Another reason to choose Periyakulam was because it was in Madras Presidency, a Tamil speaking area as her language was Tamil.\n\nShe evidently made her peace and her home in Periyakulam. Her son H.O.L. was 10 years old at that time. She taught the neighboring children and her own, on the verandah of her home and continued her needlework.\n\nThis life of quiet acceptance, patience, strength and courage came to an end when she and her elder son were struck by cholera in an epidemic. After her death the children were taken to their stepmothers house in Mundakayam.\n\nIBRAHIM KUTTY & ABDUL KHADER OF KANNUR\n\nIn Peermade settled two handsome stalwart Moplah brothers with their young widowed sister and her baby daughter. They belonged to the Mannukadiyan family of Cannanore (Kannur). Ibrahim Kutty, the elder brother built up a thriving bakery business and Abdul Khader a flourishing general store. They were deeply religious and prominent Muslims of the place and were loved and respected for their generosity and large heartedness. They were plain spoken and forthright. Ibrahim Kutty with his towering height and fiery temper was a personality to reckon with. Abdul Khader, ever the younger brother, lived a peaceful life.\n\nIn these two brothers, T.C.H.Marikar found eligible husbands for his daughters by Ayesha.\n\nIbrahim Kutty married Salha, TCHs eldest daughter. She died at childbirth.\n\nSalhas sister Nachiar, who had lost her husband and her two infants in a tragic fire accident, was then married off to Ibrahim Kutty, the young widower. They had six children. Nachiar died at childbirth when the youngest, Hameed, was born. Then her sister Amina, who had left her Ceylonese husband and was living in Peermade, was married off to Ibrahim Kutty to take care of the children. They had eight children.\n\nIbrahim Kutty, in his late years, married Kulsumbi an urdu speaking Muslim and had 4 children by her.\n\nTCHs youngest daughter Zaithoon was married to chinna mama. They had eleven children.\n\nThe tie between the Moors and the Moplahs were further strengthened by H.O.L.Marikar marrying Mariambi, the beautiful little niece of the brothers. They had eleven children.\n\nIbrahim Kuttywas a forceful character till the end.He died in 1935 and was buried in the family graveyard in Peermade in his property. His brother died in Trivandurm in 1950?\n\nH. O. L. MARIKAR\n\nH.O.L.Marikar was born in Kandy, Ceylon on 9th November 1882. He came to India with his mother and the rest of the family and TCH settled them in Periyakulam & H.O.L.s education began in Periyakulam. After his mothers death the 10 year old H.O.L. & his sisters were taken to Kottayam to his step mother. In Kottayam School he studied under the late Mr.Mamman Mappillai. H.O.L. was the captain of the football team in his school.\n\nAs it was difficult for him to study in his stepmothers house, his father send him to St.Josephs school in Trichinopoly, where he did his matriculation. His unhappy childhood and frustration in studies made him resolve that he would have a happy home and give his children the best of education, for which he strove and succeeded.\n\nAt 25, a romantic young man walked from Mundakayam to Peermade to get the consent of the formidable Ibrahim Kutty to marry his 11 year old niece. It was no hitchhike! His determination took him to Peermade through cart tracts in the jungle. With the blessings of the two uncles, H.O.L. got married to their niece, Mariambi.\n\nH.O.L. started his married life in Palar. He traded in small items like hosiery, and did not get any financial assistance. However, he took his wife to Peermade for the birth of the first four children.\n\nTCH presented each of his sons with a pony from his stable. However an envious hand set fire to his stable one night killing the 20 horses in it.\n\nIn Palar, H.O.L. took up part time work with the Munnar railways. He would walk the distance to Munnar early morning to keep time at the station. Some times on shifts, he would walk home late in the nights. There were no roads, no lights and the weather used to be freezing cold. In the eerie darkness, he would walk alone amidst the tall trees. The next two children were born in Kallar, where H.O.L. had taken up the distribution of supplies to the estates. His greatest worry was the education of the children as there were no schools in Munnar. It was then that he had to take a major decision that would result in a lonely and hard life for him without the family in Munnar where he had moved. Thus his wife and the children were settled in Trivandrum entirely for their schooling.\n\nIn Munnar he set up his own shop. His visits to Trivandurm and their holidays to Munnar were events that the family looked forward to. The journey from Munnar was not as easy. From Top Station to Bodinayakkanoor the only way to travel was by trekking. One had to walk for seven miles through Korangani pathway,carrying home made eats for the way. His wife was carried in a Doli, if she felt tired. And at the end of the trail in Bodinayakkanoor, a hot meal and hospitality awaited from his good friend, Sultan Rowther. The other choice was to travel by car through the snaky Udumalpet road, with its hairpin bends and curves, which was equally exciting. During those days his was one of the first cars in the hills.\n\nThe colonial planters had envisaged only two roads to Madras Presidency from Munnar. One was the northern outlet to Udumalpet and the other to the northeast via Top station and Korangani to Bodinayakkanoor. There was an intended trace through Mankulam for connecting Munnar to the rest of the erstwhile Travancore. It was H.O.L., with his foresight, who met the Senior Maharani at Trivandrum and convinced her of the importance of opening the present Munnar Alwaye road via the now township of Adimali and Neriyamangalam. For this meritorious service, the late Sir.C.P.Ramaswami Iyer, the then Divan of Travancore, creditably commended him.\n\nWhen the family was in Trivandrum, came the devastating floods in Munnar, in 1924. The township which nestled on the banks of the river was washed away and with it H.O.L.s shops, and all his hopes and dreams. M/s James Finley of Scotland, the colonial planters, were in two minds about continuing their activities after the floods. However, Mr.Pinches, the then G.M. In Munnar, an obstinate Scot insisted on re building the plantation and their company from the ruins. A personal friend of H.O.L.s in whom he had immense confidence, Mr.Pinches threw a challenge to him, of taking up the Herculean task of reconstructing a new township and other contract works such as the roads and bridges etc. With his indomitable courage and determination, H.O.L. took up the challenge and with his capacity for hard work, the town was rebuilt in record time. His work was lauded by the company, both in Munnar and in Scotland. This was the turning point in H.O.L.s life.\n\nThe floating of Marikar & Co. was the next step. Reputed for his honesty and integrity, friends and the public rallied round him. This was the forerunner of all the other Marikar Organizations that were to follow over the years. Under his able management the rapid growth of Marikar & Co., enabled him to take up the Ford Agency in 1933.\n\nSetting his eyes on further horizons he expanded the business by floating Marikar Motors Ltd. in Trivandrum in the year 1940-41. The first branch was in Kottayam. However, none can forget the convoy of Lorries that plied between Alwaye and Munnar, daily transporting tea and other commodities, under the banner of Marikar Transports based at Perambavoor. It was not an easy achievement, considering the fact that those were the lean years of World War II.\n\nMeanwhile the family had grown and the childrens education was still his greatest concern. His eldest daughter Abusha had finished schooling successfully in Trivandrum and her Intermediate course in Queen Marys College, Madras. Her ambition and determination was to become a doctor & she joined the Madras Medical College. She was the first Muslim woman to do so in 1930. It created uproar amongst the Muslim community as there were many who believed that female education was against the religion. H.O.L. stood every type of harsh and unkind criticisms and even physical threats.\n\nThe rest of the children also had the best of education in good schools and colleges in Trivandrum & Madras.\n\nH.O.L. was a visionary in the field of education. He was of the view that emancipation of women especially Muslims could be achieved only through education. To this end he worked and contributed whatever he could. He helped many with scholarships and financial assistance.\n\nHe had definite views on marriage. He was a pioneer against the dowry system and he was strongly against polygamy. He would not condone a second marriage while the first wife was living, perhaps due to the memories of his own childhood.\n\nH.O.L. was a patriot. He was an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi. He spoke and discussed with the family the happening in India at the time. He encouraged his elder daughter to take part in the Swadeshi Movement, while she was in the Madras Medical College. He did not miss an opportunity to take his family to attend the Congress meetings held at Madras by the great leaders of that time.\n\nIt was owing to his exemplary character and discipline that he was appointed as a member of the Legislative Council by the Government of Travancore.\n\nWhen the Munnar business was stabilized, H.O.L. wanted to concentrate on expanding the business in Trivandrum. With this in view he built a house in Pattom and moved in with his family. It was a staggering blow to H.O.L. when his wife suddenly passed away on 18th May 1942 of a heart attack in Trivandrum while he was away in Munnar. She was only 48.\n\nIn conclusion, H.O.L. was one of those rare personalities. His courage and determination, his stamina for hard work, and stubbornness in his outlook to his principles in life were qualities that endeared him to every one. Though he was deeply religious, he never did flaunt it around. His sentiment in this area culminated in his initiating the building of the only mosque in Munnar, which was the only one even till 1991."
