        "text": "The longer you wait for something, the more you appreciate it when you get it, because anything worth having is definitely worth waiting for. And I think that ultimately that is where lies a huge part of your key to happiness. And remember one thing, if your Lord is making you wait then be prepared to receive more than what you asked for.\n\nI stared wide eyed at the doctor trying to process what she just said. And then the attack started. A laughing attack. I started laughing hysterically like she just told me the funniest joke ever while Maseeha and the Doctor smiled at me awkwardly. As much as I wanted to stop laughing, I couldn’t Maseeha was now looking at me with an amused look and the Doctor seemed to be concerned.\n\nDoctor: (clearing her throat) urhm. Ma’am? Are you okay?\n\nI sucked in the rest of my laughter and wiped the tears that now started gathering at my eyes) yeah. (Straightening out) I am okay.\n\nDoctor: (Talking to Maseeha) you can take these forms to my secretary. She will have your medication ready. (Looking at me) I would advise you to see a Gynecologist my dear. I wish you all the best.\n\nWe both nodded at her and she let us out if her surgery. Silently, we made our way to the front desk and collected the meds and paid. The news seemed to have fazed both of us. Or maybe it was the medication that she had given us earlier.\n\nImraan: so? What did the doctor say?\n\nMaseeha waited for me to answer but I just stared straight ahead.\n\nMaseeha: we are all in very good condition and there is no need to worry. (Imraan looked relieved) please Imraan, we all knew there was nothing wrong with us.\n\nMe: exactly. Sometimes I feel like you just love paying doctors or something.\n\nImraan: you could have had an internal injury.\n\nMaseeha: (mumbling) more like internal surprise.\n\nImraan: (confused) what?\n\nMaseeha: nothing. Let’s go home.\n\nImraan frowned and turned to lead us out. We were all quiet the way back home. I sat staring in front of me trying to understand what I just found out. It seemed as if my body was in limbo. Like an out of body experience. When Imraan stopped to let Maseeha out, I jumped of too. He looked at me confused but switched off the car and followed us. Maseeha kept looking at me curiously. I greeted my mother in law and then pulled Maseeha into her room and closed the door.\n\nMe: what just happened??\n\nMaseeha started jumping up and down and screeching at the top of her voice while I stood there smiling from ear to ear.\n\nMaseeha: AMIRA!!! It’s happening. You are really having a baby. Oh my gosh this is so exciting I can’t handle it. I can’t wait to see Imraan’s reaction.\n\nMe: (looking worried) Mas! I can’t tell him!\n\nMaseeha: huh? What do you mean you can’t tell him?\n\nMe: the last time I told him he was so happy and he looking so disappointed when I told him it was a false alarm Mas! I can’t do it again, not until I am one hundred percent sure.\n\nMaseeha: okay do you want me to come with you?\n\nMe: yes, tomorrow?\n\nMaseeha: no way. Today!\n\nMe: (laugh) its late already. How are we going to get an appointment?\n\nMaseeha; honey you are Imraan’s wife, you can get anything!\n\nMe: okay but one more problem.\n\nMaseeha: Imraan?\n\nMe: yep. He is not going to let us go out alone especially if he doesn’t know why and where.\n\nMaseeha: don’t worry about all that. I have an idea.\n\nTen minutes later we were giggling in the car on our way to a gynaecologist. Maseeha’s plan worked. She went to her mother all teary eyed and told her about how heartbroken she felt and the only thing that will help is shopping with me but Imraan wouldn’t let us. Her mother felt so bad to see her daughter in such a state and agreed to help us out and stall Imraan by sending him on errands.\n\nMe: I don’t think the idea of having a baby has funny sunk in yet.\n\nMaseeha: it will take a while. After all, you did get the news right after an accident which is a lot for you to take in.\n\nMe: can I ask you something?\n\nMaseeha: off course.\n\nMe: how are you so normal about this whole Hamza thing?\n\nMaseeha: what do you mean?\n\nMe: come on Maseeha, you can’t be heartbroken and angry and then pretend like nothing happened the next day.\n\nMaseeha: (shrug) I guess I got over it quickly.\n\nMe: did you really love him? Like a lot?\n\nMaseeha: I guess so. But it wasn’t really love right? Love doesn’t hurt, it’s not supposed to. And I got hurt.\n\nMe: I am so sorry.\n\nMaseeha: it’s okay. I understand why you didn’t tell me. Before I went to bed last night, I started to think about how angry I was at you. How it was all so unfair. But then I realised that if the roles were reversed I would have probably made the same mistake.\n\nMe: I wish I could go back and change it.\n\nMaseeha: I don’t. I’m glad it all happened. Sometimes the bad things open your eyes to the good things that you weren’t paying attention to before.\n\nWe didn’t take long at the gynaecologist. She was on standby and had to be as quick as possible with us. She did after all do us a favour by cramming us into her schedule. She asked me a few questions and then did a few tests. I waited with Maseeha in the waiting room and almost bit off all my nails in the waiting period. I was nervous as hell.\n\nThe secretary came in to tell us that she had an emergency and will call us to tell us of the news. I wanted to scream in anxiety but I composed myself and followed a very annoyed Maseeha out of the surgery.\n\nMaseeha: this is so frustrating. I hate waiting.\n\nWe rushed back home and made ourselves some popcorn and coffee while I waited for Imraan. He didn’t take as long and we both headed home. I was bursting with excitement to tell him but I pinched myself back. I tried to distract myself by thinking about something else but my mind kept wandering back to the baby topic.\n\nImraan: (pulling into our driveway) why are you thinking so hard?\n\nMe: huh? I’m not thinking hard.\n\nImraan: yes you are. You only frown like that when you thinking.\n\nI unbuckled my seatbelt and jumped off. Imraan locked the car and followed me. The security opened up for us and we made our way upstairs. How on earth are we going to climb this stairs with a pram? I shook the thought away.\n\nThe call came the next morning while I was in bed. Imraan was the one who answered it and handed the phone to me. He didn’t tell me who it was so I greeted into the phone and the secretary’s chirpy voice replied. When she told me that the news was a positive I wanted to explode. I think my heart did. It erupted into a million tiny pieces followed by the rest of my organs erupting to. And my mind thought about the little soul that was growing in me. And that is when it sank in…\n\nImraan sat at my side looking at me curiously. I didn’t want him to know just yet so I ended the call with her abruptly.\n\nImraan: so…who was that?\n\nMe: a friend.\n\nI changed the subject before he could ask me anything else and got myself busy. Imraan forgot all about it and didn’t ask anything after that. Our day went on as usual. We had breakfast and he went off to work. I couldn’t contain my excitement. I wrecked my brains trying to think of a creative idea to tell him. I wanted it to be something he will always remember. As much as I really needed Naseema’s help, I didn’t want to tell her before Imraan, so I called up Sabeeha hoping that she could help. And she did. She had a brilliant idea. Who would have thought…?\n\nSabeeha: are you really preggers?!\n\nme: can you believe it?\n\nsabeeha: uh yeah. I am just taking in the fact that we going to have to deal with pregnant you. only Allah knows how we are going to get through these nine months with you!\n\nme: hey!!\n\nsabeeha giggled and then rushed off. She explained that she had to attend her ex neighbors wedding and wont be available for a few days. The wedding was in Johannesburg. Lucky for her, her father needed to make a trip to joburg so she was jumping in. I wonder if my mother was going too.\n\nspeaking of my mother, in all the excitement of getting my surprise for Imraan ready, my mother called me and I panicked. I didn’t know how to tell her. But I didn’t have to.\n\nMum: how are you doing my child? You forgot about your mother these days?\n\nMe: Alhamdulillah mummy. How can I ever forget you mummy?\n\nMum: you better not. Before I forget, I called to tell you that we are doing an emergency trip to Joburg this week. Do you want to come with? I’m sure Imraan can live without you for a few days.\n\nMe: uh…I don’t know. What’s the emergency?\n\nMum: Sabeeha’s friend is getting married so she needs to be there and your father has a few stuff he wants to sort out. So…are you up for a road trip?\n\nMe: I don’t think so. It’s so last minute and I’ve got so much to sort out here with all that’s happening and I don’t think I can travel (realising what I nearly said) so far after so long.\n\nMum: Amira! You never say no to road trips!\n\nMe: I know. I just don’t feel like it this time.\n\nMum: why what’s wrong? Are you sick?\n\nMe: huh? No. pssht. I’m fine. Perfectly healthy person here.\n\nMum: oh my gosh! You’re pregnant aren’t you?\n\nMe: what? I didn’t say that!\n\nMum: but you didn’t say that you are not either. AMIRA! ARE YOU PREGNANT?\n\nMe: (swallowing) I just found out this morning. Officially.\n\nThen my mother did the most outrageous thing. She started screaming at the top of her lungs. She screamed so loud that I was pretty sure that the entire Durban just found out I’m pregnant.\n\nMum: I can’t believe this. It such good news.\n\nMe: mum? Are you crying?\n\nMum: off course I’m crying. I am going to be a grandmother. What could be a better thing??\n\nAnd that is how my mother came to know. Or should I say guessed. Its true what they say when they say that a mother always knows.\n\nI waited for Imraan to come home and ran up to open when I heard his car. He shot me a smile that melted my insides when he saw me and placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nImraan: someone is excited to see me today!\n\nMe: as if!\n\nHe laughed and walked to the table.\n\nImraan: what’s this?\n\nMe: I got you a gift.\n\nImraan: really? (He picked up the gift wrapped box)\n\nMe: go on. Open it.\n\nImraan opened the box and peeked in with a confused look. He put his hand in and pulled out pieces of a puzzle.\n\nMe: You have to build it.\n\nImraan looked at me weirdly. Then he turned the box over to topple all the contents onto the table. He began building it and I watched with an amused smile. He built most of it and when he came to the last few pieces his face lit up and he figured out what was written on it. He seemed to not believe what he read and carried on building it till the last piece and then looked up.\n\nHe was speechless. His eyes searching my face for a hint that this was true. Tears of joy welled up in my eyes and I grinned at my husband. The news slowly sunk in and a grin formed on his lips.\n\nImraan: are you serious. (I nodded my head. A huge smile plastered his face and he pulled me into a hug) I can’t believe this is actually happening! This is just…oh my…\n\nMe: (giggling in his arms) I have waited my whole life to see the day that you would be speechless Mr Motala. I never thought that I would actually see that day though.\n\nImraan: I just can’t believe it. It’s too…\n\nMe: good to be true.\n\nImraan: yeah. It’s too good to be true.\n\nWe spent the rest of the afternoons talking about the next year ahead of us. There was going to be a huge change. But both of us were all in for the change. We fought about what names we would keep and where the cot would go but it was in good intentions. We were excited.\n\nImraan didn’t go to work the next day. No matter how much I begged him to go, he refused. At lunch time, we went to his house to break the news. His parents were extremely excited. They fussed over us in joy and delight at the great news. And I couldn’t have felt more excitement. I was going to be a mother.\n\nNaseema went berserk when I told her. She was all over the place with a hundred and one questions. She begged Yusuf to bring her over and was there in no time with a long list of all the things that I shouldn’t eat and all the things that I should. She was worse than my mother in law with her lectures. we all ate together and then lazed around in Maseeha’s room with the air-con on full blast. This heat was killing me.\n\nNaseema: Is that coffee?!\n\nme: yeah. you want?\n\nNaseema: Amira! do you know how bad coffee is for the baby!\n\nI giggled and glanced at Maseeha.\n\nMaseeha: mahn, married Naseema is really hard to deal with.\n\nThe day passed by lazily. It felt so good to be back to normal after a long time. Naseema was slowly settling into her normal life, Maseeha was healing very fast, Sabeeha was well Sabeeha, Saffiyya was due to land in a week and I was happy and pregnant. I couldn’t ask for anything better.\n\nEveryone was psyched too have Saffiyya and Zaakir soon. Naseema had a huge welcome back bash well planned and ready to go. It kills me how that girl could have so much of passion for event planning in such a small body. It was a blessing that she was married to Yusuf too, because somehow he managed to calm her whenever she was hyped up about anything. It was pretty amusing to watch how he tamed her so well. The party was planned for two days after Saffiyya and them arrive which gave Sabeeha enough time to return home from the wedding she went to.\n\nWe left the house way after midnight and I crept into bed after a warm shower.\n\nImraan: (staring up at the ceiling) I cant wait!\n\nme: for?\n\nImraan: our baby!\n\nme: (smiling from ear to ear) lets get through this nine months successfully first.\n\nImraan: (laugh) we will get through it. Together.\n\nme: we will (i sighed and turned to my side) Goodnight Imraan!\n\nAfter a long while Imraan turned to his side too and whispered.\n\nImraan: Goodnight!\n\nSometimes what you think is good for you is actually bad. And sometimes what is good falls apart to make something better.\n\nMaseeha: (her eyes lighting up) you’ll do it!! YOU ARE THE BEST! (She jumped off her stool and dived on my shoulders in excitement)\n\nMe: whoa. Chill mas. I said I’ll go to a wedding with you not bury a dead body.\n\nMaseeha: (jumping up and down) thank you thank you thank you! You have no idea what this means to me.\n\nMe: well if I didn’t, I do now!\n\nI started to think again about what I just said I will do. Was this really that big of a deal? I mean it’s just a wedding right, can’t exactly do much harm! I shrugged all the negative thoughts away and confirmed the date and stuff with Maseeha. We came to a set story about whose wedding it was and I dropped her home. I stopped at the pharmacy to get a test (keeping up with my promise) and headed home only to find Imraan fast asleep with a baby (Muhammed) on his chest. I tapped him a few times and even shouted in his ear but he was fast asleep. Muhammed lay on his chest and slept peacefully. I took a few pics of them giggling to myself and ran up to take a shower.\n\nImraan and Muhammad were still asleep when I came back down.\n\nMe: what did you two eat? Sleeping pills?\n\nMe: wow I’m literally talking to myself!\n\nMe: and I’m doing it again!\n\nSigh.\n\nI tapped imraan again and he groaned.\n\nMe: Imraaaaaan!!!!\n\nI decided to take Muhammad away. I slowly picked him up and he immediately started screaming his guts. I quickly placed him back down and he was silent again. By now Imraan was up.\n\nMe: oops?\n\nImraan: oh, you home? (He held Muhammed and slowly sat up leaning his back on the back of the couch)\n\nMe: what is Muhammad doing here? And why are you sleeping on the couch? Did you sleep here the whole night?\n\nImraan: zaakir needed to sort out last minute passports. I was tired. And no I did not. Did I ever tell you that you ask way too many questions in one sentence?\n\nMe: I don’t know, did you?\n\nImraan: (smirk) I’m beginning to think maybe you are pregnant.\n\nMe: phhssst! Never!\n\nMuhammed lifted his head up and looked at me.\n\nImraan: see! Even Moe thinks you are!\n\nMe: Moe? So you two have already moved to pet name base? (Smirk)\n\nImraan: oh look Moe! Amira is jealous! (He threw him up and caught him)\n\nI rolled my eyes.\n\nMe: did you eat?\n\nImraan: depends. Are you offering to make breakfast for us? We are very hungry isn’t Moe?\n\nI shook my head and got up. How could I have forgotten that he has no idea how to do anything in the kitchen?\n\nMe: It’s not that I’m complaining or anything but why can’t mothers ever teach their sons. What if there is nobody to do for them, then what? Starve till someone comes along?\n\nI made him a quick meal and fed Muhammed while he ate. Don’t ask me how Zaakir was expecting Imraan to feed his son. He can’t even feed himself leave the baby. Safiyya messaged me to say that she was sorry and that the seminar came up last minute. She said that they will be back by the afternoon. I didn’t mind looking after Muhammad though. He was an angel. Speaking about babies, I finally got the guts to take the test. And as usual, I was right. No baby.\n\nI’m not sure whether I’m happy or sad. I mean I would love to have a baby around and watching Imraan with Muhammed really made me happy but this soon? I don’t think I would ever be able to handle it. I don’t think I am ready as yet. Imraan looked a little bit disappointed though. I spotted a spark of hope in his eyes when I came out of the bathroom and it was like I literally felt his heart sink when I told him. His sudden enthusiasm took me by surprise. I didn’t expect him of all people to want a baby so soon. And even though I was a little relieved that I wasn’t pregnant, I felt a pang of gloom on his behalf.\n\nThe days for Naseema’s wedding was soon numbered and time was catching up to everyone but the bride. She was flying high with her preparations and determination. Everything had to be perfect in her eyes and she was doing everything in her ability to make sure of it. Safiyya tried to talk her into having something small but she had her mind set, if she was doing this, she was doing it big. Even I tried to convince her that it was all a waste but she turned a blind eye to all the advice. It was either go big or go home.\n\nTo keep the ties we just went with the flow, a bad habit many of us live by.\n\nThe wedding Maseeha begged me to go to was before Naseema’s. Two weeks approximately. I very subtly explained to Imraan that I will be out for the day and he didn’t even ask for any details like he normally would. Relieved, I headed to Maseeha’s. She looked dazzling in a royal blue dress and nude stilettoes. I wore an elegant black dress with a gorgeous Jo Borkett jacket that Sabeeha got me. I wasn’t in the mood for heels so I just slipped on a dainty pump that went perfectly with the jacket.\n\nMaseeha introduced me to everyone (who surprisingly knew her very well). And I ignored the alarm bells that went off in my head when they called her and told her to walk in with the bride’s brother. It was only then that I realised how deep I got myself into this and how mad Imraan was going to be. I tried to stay calm and normal.\n\nMe: (driving home after the wedding) so…you seem quite comfy with that family already.\n\nMaseeha: (nervous laugh) not really. I hardly even know them, they just super friendly.\n\nMe: oh. (Pause) so do they always go around asking random strangers to hold their brothers hand and walk the aisle?\n\nMaseeha: it’s not like that Amira.\n\nMe: then what is it like Mas? Because that is not ‘I just met you friendly’ to me. That is more like ‘we know you for years and you marrying our brother’ friendly.\n\nMaseeha: (softly) you make it sound so bad.\n\nMe: that’s because it is bad Maseeha! (I slammed the breaks and the car came to a sudden halt) (Lowering my voice) I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have screamed at you like that.\n\n(I pulled into her driveway)\n\nMaseeha: yeah. You shouldn’t have Amira. And as much as I know you care about me, I think it’s only fair that you let me live a little too. Thanks again for the help. It’s really something to have someone understand you rather than judge. I’ll see you later.\n\nShe got off the car and walked off. Leaving me to return home and pretend like none of that just happened. Thankfully, Imraan was not at home and I had some time to think it all through. I decided that is was Maseeha’s life and she needed to take some responsibility. For now, all I could do was give her advice and hope she makes the rights decisions.\n\nBeing around Naseema was a no-no! In the next few weeks but as her best friend and cousin in law I had no choice but to stick around and take all the mood swings. From the way I looked at it, the more she shouted at me, the less she would shout at everyone else. She was definitely going down as the bridezilla of the century. She made the dressmaker cry, nearly got one of the décor workers fired and changed the colour of the hall three times. That is besides the shouting that we all got for everything we did wrong. Even baby Muhammed got shouting when he dug his fingers into the burfee tray.\n\nMaseeha, Safiyya, Sabeeha and I decided to wear matching dresses for the wedding. Well, it was more Naseema’s decision, we just agreed. We had them brought down from Dubai and they arrived a few days before the wedding. To say it was gorgeous would be an understatement. They were strikingly magnificent and perfect. So perfect I would have even worn it for my own wedding. Mine was a gorgeous teal, Sabeeha’s was a bold red, Safiyya’s was striking yellow and Maseeha’s was soft green. We had them ironed at kept them at Maseeha’s house for safe keeping. She had the biggest closet that nobody but we were allowed in so we knew it would be safe there. We got matching clutches too. Naseema’s mother bought them for us as early gifts for all the help. We went simple with the shoes. Naseema insisted that we had to wear heels so we each got a pair of adorable suedes.\n\nNaseema’s gown was a secret even to us. She explained it a little bit but it was hard to understand when you don’t speak dress. It didn’t come with sleeves so she was having lace sleeves sown onto it with a white satin on the inside. She also bought an extra piece to sew a scarf that will match and had the same piece of crystals put on her shoe. Yes, she was that fussy.\n\nWhile we were helping to sample the goodie bags and wrap trays, Sabeeha was settling herself in. She had the room re-furnished to her taste and was trying hard to hurry up the last minute unpacking in time for the wedding week. Safiyya on the other hand was doing her last minute hajj shopping and attending all the seminars she could. She was leaving in the next three weeks that was one week after Naseema’s wedding and two days after her walima.\n\nAs for my mother. She was back in town and going wedding frenzy. If there was one thing about my mother, it was that she absolutely loved getting involved in functions and loses her mind in the process. She won’t care who you are, if you in her way, consider yourself dead. A little like Naseema actually. That is probably the reason why I managed to stay friends with Naseema for so long. Nobody else will be able to understand their function language.\n\nThey both have this thing that I like to call function language. If there is a function and they are under pressure they tend to lose their sense of choosing the correct vocabulary and then they lose their minds when people don’t understand them. It usually goes something like this.\n\nMum: Farhana can you get that thing from the thing for me babe.\n\nFarhana: (confused face) huh?\n\nMum: that thing from the thing mahn!\n\nFarhana: …\n\nMum: I said get me the damn spoon from the bowl child. What is so hard for you to understand?\n\nAnd poor 13 year old farhana is not sure what on earth just happened. And she just sits there trying hard not to cry.\n\nNaseema now, she is a little different. And sometimes she can get really violent.\n\nNaseema: hey you, pass me that!\n\nChild: (looking at her confused)\n\nNaseema: are you bloody deaf? I said pass me that!\n\nChild: the blue packet or the red packet?\n\nNaseema: the *insert violent word* damn blue packet mahn. Why the hell would I ask you for the red packet? Gosh some people are so dumb!\n\nAnd the child just stands there and will probably believe for the rest of her life that she is really dumb.\n\nAnd that is exactly why I stay close by to the two of them when there is a function. Because I am one of the few that understands their language or can handle the screaming and so I feel the need to save all the Farhana’s out there.\n\nThe week of the wedding officially arrived and the Motala house buzzed with excitement. Sabeeha was back with her quirky comments and Safiyya was around with her adorable baba and sweet advice. Even though I was also married, I left the advice to her. Every single person was psyched and mentally prepared for the wedding of the century. If you had a gorgeous gold and white plate that had the invite to the wedding imprinted, it was like real gold. Talk about a very materialistic community.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Naseema’s mother invited everyone for supper. She had a gorgeous indoor Moroccan themed supper that blew everyone’s mind away. Naseema wore an amazing green and gold Moroccan dress. They served a buffet full of food that were all prepared Moroccan style.\n\nNaseema had her mehndi done on Thursday night so it was just us girls. And on Friday, everyone went to Yusuf’s house for lunch and to give the trays. I stayed back with Naseema and we went to the parlour for a manicure and pedicure. Thereafter she went to wash and set her hair. Yusuf’s family came over for supper to give her trays. The supper was Arabian themed and this time she wore a purple and blue Arabian outfit. She looked gorgeous and I can only imagine what a gorgeous bride she was going to make on her wedding day.\n\nAnd I sure wasn’t wrong…\n\nWOW it feels so good to be back. and I am hoping to stay this time:)\n\nI tried to write up a list of apologies but Mahn was it difficult. so I decided to rather treat you guys with a longer post. Hope you all have a spiritual Ramadaan and Fabulous EID:)\n\nThis one is for a crazy friend of mine who finally got down to reading surtidiaries. Love you kiddoe:)\n\nENJOY:)\n\nYou don’t need the strength to let go of something. All you need is the understanding. And besides, in the end, it all sums up to what matters most. Holding onto the past or moving on to the future. It’s up to us to decide which path we want to take, the thing is, you can only choose one!\n\nThe news that Sabeeha hit us all with took long to set in. Finally, Safiyya broke the silence.\n\nSafiyya: he did what?\n\nThe room fell silent. Even Muhammed realised that something was wrong and looked up anxiously.\n\nMe: he did what?\n\nSabeeha: I know. Crazy right. Anyway he is looking to get married and he wants a good surti girl.\n\nMe: (smirk) so you said yes?\n\nSabeeha: what? No. (Laugh) who said the proposal was for me?\n\nMe: (sigh) oh my word sabs. You nearly had me there for a moment. I really thought you were talking about you. I mean that would just be…insane!\n\nSabeeha: yeah. (Awkward laugh) it would have been pretty insane.\n\nMe: I know. So who is the girl he wants to go see? Do I know her? Well I have to know her or you wouldn’t tell me.\n\nNaseema: OH GOSH. WOULD YOU GUYS TAKE A HINT ALREADY? Its ME! Yusuf Asmal wants to come and see me!\n\nSilence.\n\nMaseeha: (whistle) these stories just keep getting better and better.\n\nSilence.\n\nNaseema: look Amira. I can say no if you want me to. It’s really not much of a deal anyway. I’m not even sure I am even ready for this whole samosa run thing if you can call it that. And sisters before misters right? If you don’t want me to…\n\nMe: (cutting her off) naseema! Why would I ever ask you to do that? We never even have anything. And besides. I think you two will make a good pair now that I am imagining it.\n\nMaseeha: yep. I can totally see it. (Studying naseema intently) cute babies and the works!\n\nNaseema: (shaking her head) mas! (To me) but you didn’t look very happy when Sabeeha told you. Not that I blame you or anything. It’s just, I need to know honestly. Are you sure it’s okay?\n\nMe: absolutely one hundred percent. I was worried there for a moment. But only because I thought Sabeeha was having a samoosa run. THAT would be insane!\n\nNaseema: (looking relieved) ok. Jazakallah so much.\n\nMe: really it’s not an issue. But…I am not so sure Imraan is going to be too happy about this. Wait, scratch that. I’m am pretty sure he is going to freak out.\n\nSabeeha: and that is why you, his beloved wife who he will do anything for, is going to convince him.\n\nMe: uh, have you met him? He is not very convincible, even for me.\n\nSafiyya: come on Amira. You know too well he will listen to you.\n\nNaseema: there’s something else.\n\nMe: (groan) it’s never something good when you say that.\n\nNaseema: his mother wants to come this weekend that’s coming. And my mother wants Imraan to be there, and I quote “to break the ice”.\n\nMe: that is a terrible terrible idea.\n\nMaseeha: I find that rather ironic considering the last time they met, the only think Imraan broke was Yusuf’s nose.\n\nSabeeha: (shocked) he did that?\n\nMaseeha: oh yes.\n\nSabeeha: cool mahn. (Looking at our horrified faces) I mean not so cool.\n\nNaseema: so amira? Do you think you can be convincing enough to get him to agree to come and not break ANYTHING of Yusuf’s?\n\nSabeeha: oh it can’t be that hard. Just don’t cook for the week. (We all stared at her) or not.\n\nNaseema: well let’s just hope he doesn’t freak out and mess everything up.\n\nImraan: (walking in) let’s hope who doesn’t freak out?\n\nMe: (a little too fast) nobody.\n\nMaseeha: Imraan! Don’t you know any manners? You can’t walk into someone else’s conversation and butt in. it’s rude.\n\nImraan: (a smirk playing at his lips) you’ll were talking about me weren’t you’ll?\n\nMe: no. we weren’t.\n\nImraan: really? Then why are you blushing so much? You only blush this much when you talking about me.\n\nThat made me blush even more. Oh gosh.\n\nImraan: see! You were talking about me.\n\nMaseeha: okay fine we were. But we not telling you about what.\n\nImraan: oh I see. (Pause) this is about Yusuf isn’t it?\n\nMe: what? You…how?\n\nImraan: (sitting down and picking a grape from the fruit tray) I was wondering how you could keep it from me so well. You yourself didn’t even know.\n\nSabeeha: is there something I’m missing? Like isn’t there supposed to be angry face or shouting or punching walls and stuff? Why is there always no drama when I’m around?\n\nImraan: why? I don’t see a big deal. (Innocent face)\n\nMaseeha: this is a joke right? You never know how to contain your anger.\n\nImraan: (picking another grape and studying it in his hand) well I don’t see a reason to be angry. I got the girl right? (Smirk)\n\nMe: (rolling my eyes) is that all that matters to you guys?\n\nImraan: (thinking) it depends.\n\nIt was so relieving to know imraan wasn’t planning on tearing the house apart because of the news. But that didn’t stop the actual day from being utterly and completely awkward. Naseema looked ravishing as usual. That girl didn’t even have to try. She could pitch up at a wedding in pyjamas and still put away the best dressed. She wore a simple dress and went for a natural make up look. And despite the long nerve wrecking night she had with no sleep she still managed to pull off as confident as ever.\n\nYusuf and his family only came in one car, it was him, his mother, father, his sister from Roshnee and her three kids. Just seven of them but it felt like a hundred. The men sat in the huge white lounge and the woman sat in the dining room. Yusuf’s mother hugged naseema and asked her a few questions. She was sweet and we got chatting with her very quickly. I pretended like it was the first time I met her and she did the same.\n\nYusuf’s sister Sanhaa, however, didn’t seem to have a filter from the brain to her mouth. She just yapped and yapped and I sat there trying very hard not to scream with the pining headache she gave me. Her kids ran up and about screaming at the top of their lungs, they came in every now and again to grab a handful of sweets from the sweet jar and proceeded to eat them one after the other. They then left the wrappers back in the jar and ran off for another round of hide and seek. And not once did their mother scold them. In fact, she didn’t even flinch. It drove me nuts. I could see Naseema’s mum was getting a little irritated too but she kept her cool. She just smiled and shook her head at everything Sanhaa said. Sanhaa didn’t seem to care about the kids, all she did was go on talking about China and its beauty. I have never been to China, and I don’t wish to, but Sanhaa made me feel like I did. She droned on about her five week trip to China and didn’t hesitate to leave out any detail about it. It bothered me how someone could even have such a memory. Yusuf and naseema were ushered into the TV lounge to talk and I was itching to take a peak.\n\nFifteen minutes later, naseema sauntered into the dining room and the look on her face gave it all away. A shiver went up my spine as the thought of my best friend getting married crossed my mind. Trying not to jump to conclusions, I pushed it aside and concentrated on watching the fish swim up and down in the huge tank. Sanhaa was still talking about some historical museum where her husband gave her a bunch of roses and a half a million rand ring. oh wait, that was an antique restaurant or something…the museum is where he…well I can’t remember.\n\nFinally they decided to leave. They promised to call when they have an answer. I took a peek at Yusuf as he left and the smile that teased on his lips was enough to have me planning a new outfit. I had a feeling there was going to be a wedding soon…I’m thinking maybe that gorgeous teal dress I saw on instagram the other day. or maybe even the purple one…\n\nI tried to get the answer out of naseema but she assured me that she will give it soon. That was two minutes after she told me that I should promise not to tell anyone but she had a good vibe. I laughed at her inability to keep a secret from me for even two minutes. Imraan had some renters coming to see one of the flats so we had to leave not long after. I tried to beg him to let me stay but he just laughed when I told him that I saw my best friends more often when I was not married to him. I didnt forget to mention that they were his sister and cousin and that other husbands would kill to have their wives get along with their family. He just rolled his eyes and pulled me to the car. Husbands I tell you! Cant live with them, cant live without them!\n\nThe days were just flying…the weekend also flew by and a new week came around once again…\n\nWhen my mother took me aside to give me advice before I got married, I honestly thought that she was joking when she told me that boys have a hard time understanding many things and to cut them some slack when they do. I thought Safiyya was joking too when she told me that no matter how intelligent a boy can be, the mistakes they make sometimes are really over the top. I prepared for the worse case scenario, but, I didn’t plan for the worst. It all went down like this…\n\nImraan came home from work and told me that we were invited the next day for supper at his aunt’s house in the Bluff. I figured that there was enough chocolate cupcakes to take and didn’t bother to bake anything. When I opened the Tupperware the next day, I started freaking out. There was only one cupcake!\n\nMe: no way! How can all be finished?\n\nImraan: (walking in) all what? (He leaned in and peeping into the Tupperware) there is one there!\n\nMe: one? How can I take one?\n\nImraan: you dont have to take something.\n\nMe: yes I do!\n\nImraan: we can stop and buy something?\n\nMe: no its okay. I’ll bake something…\n\nTo my luck, we desperately needed to do some grocery shopping and most of the things on my list was either finished or less. I was actually planning to go that Sunday but I couldn’t bake without most of the ingredients.Imraan offered to go to the shop for me. I promised that it wouldn’t be a lot and he could even go through the express till. So I grabbed a pen and a paper and jotted down what I needed.\n\nI ran up to get my stuff ready while he was gone. Half an hour later and he still didn’t return. I figured it might be a little full so while I waited for him to come I decided it about time I gave Sameer a call and find out exactly what was going on. His phone kept going to voicemail. Looks like I was going to have to find some other method to get hold of him. I made a mental note to call his mother in the week. Maybe she can help me out. One hour later and Imraan still he didn’t come home. I read my salaah and was about to give him a call when I heard the key turn. Imraan.\n\nI put my stuff away and ran downstairs to a very peculiar sight. Looking at Imraan questioningly, I tried to figure out why on earth there was so much of things.\n\nImraan:(out of breath) well clearly they didn’t let me through the express. (Turning to go) There is one more packet downstairs. Let me get it.\n\nStill looking confused at my husband I peeped into the packets and stared. What in the world of groceries and husbands???\n\nMy eyes fell on the shopping list I gave him and the realization dawned upon me. Trying very hard to suppress the laughter, I picked up the packets and went to the kitchen. I pulled out the list and read over it to check whether my suspicions were true. By now I couldn’t contain the laughter, this was just unbelievable. I didn’t even know a mistake like this was even humanly possible. For the first time in my life, I numbered the list and Imraan thought it was the quantity. Seriously. How even…\n\nI went through the stuff and the list to see if he really did do that.\n\nMooi river butter-there was one block butter in the packet\n\nTray of eggs- there were two trays eggs!\n\nDairy milk chocolate- there were three slabs\n\nNestle cream- there was 4 tins\n\nCake flour- I looked around and counted 3 packets.\n\nYou can guess what Imraan walked in with. Yes, 2 packets of cake flour. It took every single gut and gland to hold myself back from exploding with laughter. Instead I just looked at him with a very innocently amused face and silently read on.\n\n6. milk- yip six litres of milk\n\nYou would think that would have given him a hint that it was numbers. I mean there was no litre sign!\n\nImraan: (nearly out of breath) sshhew (putting the flour on the counter) grocery shopping can be a pain sometimes. That place was choked.\n\nMe: sorry you had to go alone. I should have come with. (oh I wasnt lying here)\n\nImraan: nah I don’t mind. You have so much other work to do the least I can do is help where I can. And besides, I think I managed it quite well what do you say? (Wink)\n\nMe: oh you managed it well alright! (Smirk)\n\nImraan: You need help with the baking?\n\nMe: NO. I think you did enough work for the day Mr. (Tapping his chest) you can go relax, I got it covered.\n\nImraan: you sure? (I nodded) alright.(He turned to go and I started to unpack the stuff with a huge smile on my face. Wait till I tell maseeha. He turned around) and for the record, I figured out what I did. (I paused, block of butter mid-air) But it was too late, I was already at the till and there was a long queue behind me. It would have been too embarrassing to go back! (I kept silent and he turned to go again, a few seconds later he popped his head in) and don’t tell anyone about this!\n\nMe: that is not something you should ask of a lady. (trying to suppress the laughter)\n\nImraan: okay fine, just don’t tell my mother. (Pause) or my sister. (I raised an eyebrow) okay just my mother. (Sigh) you can laugh if you want. (Smirk) at the rate that you are suppressing it, you look like you going to explode!\n\nthat set me off laughing.\n\nMe: (after a good laugh) I thought you always went shopping for maseeha? (I wiped the tears that started to come out because of all the laughing)\n\nImraan: I did! but she doesn’t number anything unless its quantity. And besides, I know what’s stuff like lays and bread and milk. But Mooi River butter? Do you even know how many different brands of butter there is?\n\nMe: (sarcastic) and there is only one type of chips?\n\nI only started my baking half an hour later because I couldn’t stop laughing at him. It was just too much. He was just too much. I mean how could he? This was so going down on my list of things to tell my children about their father.\n\nWhoa, look at me, thinking about what I’m going to be telling my children and stuff. It’s true what they say, marriage changes you. And I think it distorted Imraan’s left side of the brain a little…\n\nAnd finally, a post from Imraan…You asked for it…this one is for all those who waited up for a post. And for those who threatened me *wink wink*\n\nenjoy…\n\nWe slept in late on the day after the walima. I knew she still needed some rest and if I got up she wouldn’t sleep in. so I staying in bed and watched her sleep. I watched her sleep so soundly and thought to myself how beautiful she was. She was beautiful, but not like those girls in the magazines. She was beautiful, for the way she thought. She was beautiful, for the sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved. She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was sad. No, she wasn’t beautiful for something just as temporary as her looks. She was beautiful, deep down to her soul.\n\nAnd when you start to really know someone, all their physical characteristics start to disappear. You begin to dwell in their energy, recognize the scent of their skin. You see only the essence of the person, not the shell. That’s why you can’t fall in love with beauty. You can lust after it, be infatuated by it, and want to own it. You can love it with your eyes and body but not your heart. And that’s why, when you really connect with a person’s inner self, any physical imperfections disappear, become irrelevant.\n\nAnd I couldn’t help but wonder how on earth I deserved such a wife? How did it all just happen so quickly? How fast the days had just flew by. A few days ago she was a Moolla. And now, she was Motala. I smiled as I thought about the days that led to our nikah…\n\nFlashback:\n\nZaakir: congratulations (smacking me on my back) happy for you bro! It’s about time.\n\nIbrahim: so who’s this chick?\n\nAadil: you saw her mahn. He brought her once with his cuz naseema.\n\nIbrahim: oh yeah. She’s hot. And not the “holier than thou” type. Double score.\n\nImraan: (concentrating on the screen) let’s try not to refer to her as hot or chick or anything for that matter. (I pressed nitrous and took over Ibrahim’s car. I was in the lead)\n\nAadil: (to me) dude you really whipped\n\nHe threw a corn in the air and caught it with his mouth.\n\nIbrahim: so you saying that she was practically breaking up with you and you proposed? (Confused face) you need help. (He took over me again)\n\nImraan: she’s a keeper mahn.\n\nAadil: that’s what ebie said for Sameera!\n\nImraan: yeah and what zaakir said for Safiyya! And look at him! His happy! Right Zak?\n\nZaakir: couldn’t be happier! (Holding up his coke and grinning)\n\nAadil: that’s because he is zaakir!\n\nWe all laughed.\n\nZaakir: jokes aside. I think you made the right move. I don’t approve of the whole proposing directly to her though. What were you thinking?\n\nImraan: (I flew passed Ibrahim’s car and crossed the finish line) I just couldn’t stand the thought of losing her.\n\nThey all laughed.\n\nAadil: so you getting married? Whoa I never thought ill see the day\n\nImraan: aah come on. It’s not like I’m some playboy or something. You guys know I’ve never touched a woman!\n\nIbrahim: that’s the problem. You just never seemed like the type who would be NOT touching woman one minute and getting married to one the next.\n\nZaakir: so when’s the nikah?\n\nImraan: it was supposed to be in the next two weeks. (They all looked at me) but I want to move it to this Friday! (They widened their eyes)\n\nAadil: wow! That is way too soon.\n\nIbrahim: as long as you know what you doing, we with you mahn. (He gave me a slap on the back)\n\nMe: I know (handing zaakir the remote) you’re up!\n\nIt was late afternoon and I was chilling with the guys. We had to close up the archery for the day because of the rain so we rocked up at Aadil’s house for a few games of need for speed. I didn’t want to tell them yet about Amira but Zaakir just knew something was up and he had me spill it.\n\nI was nervous as ever when I called Amira. What if she says no? What if she gets upset? What if oh what if? Darn it this girl was making me so weak at heart.\n\nI was a total wreck for the next few days. I couldn’t even decide on anything without wondering if Amira would approve. Talk about soppy love. I was becoming the king of soppiness. And I wasn’t even sure whether I liked it or not.\n\nI don’t know what I was thinking when I called Amira. All I know is that I was serious about this relationship. Maybe I was impatient. Maybe I was afraid I’d change my mind. Maybe I was confused. Maybe I just wanted to get over it. Who knows, my life at that moment was a total blur. Blurred by my emotions and soppiness (told you I was the king).\n\nAll I knew was that I was a loser who just didn’t want to lose her…\n\nSo once getting her to agree was done with, I had the grandfather to deal with. When I had him agree all I had to do was convince her mother. I knew she would be the easiest. One huge bunch of yellow flowers and a really good motala smirk was all it took. Now for the actual wedding. What in the Great Wall of China did I get myself into?\n\nFriends and family can be total creeps sometimes. But when it comes to times when you need them to have your back, their always there, right at your side. It’s at times like this when you learn to appreciate them. It’s actually quite amazing how everyone seems to come together and prepare an occasion, saves us grooms from having to do much. Or should I say anything for that matter.\n\nYip, the life of a groom. That’s the life. I practically did nothing all day. Just played Xbox with the guys, tried on a few suits, played more Xbox with the guys and tasted new recipes from the aunties. The life. I didn’t even have to worry about booking the hotel. My boy Ibrahim had that all sorted out for me.\n\nZaakir: so did you get the flat all sorted out? (Taking a sip from the steaming coffee my mother just laid on the table)\n\nMe: huh? All that’s been sorted a long time ago. Furnishing the works. What’s to do?\n\nZaakir: and what about getting amira to move her stuff in there. That’s all going to be hard to do in the last few days and you don’t want her to be all out of place when you get back next week.\n\nMe: (scrunching my nose) I might have not told her about that as yet.\n\nZaakir: not told her about what? (I grinned) are you crazy? You didn’t tell her where you going to be living?\n\nMe: well she didn’t ask. (Shrugging my shoulders) she probably figured we’d be staying here.\n\nZaakir: so when are you going to tell her?\n\nMe: I was planning after the Maldives.\n\nZaakir: (raised eyebrow) and you expecting her to spend her wedding night at her mother in laws house?\n\nMe: what? No! I booked Hilton. Dude why would I ever make her stay at home? (Shocked face)\n\nSilence\n\nZaakir: I think that Amira would want to spend the night at your new home.\n\nMe: oh and you know her well right? (I didn’t mean for that to come out as harsh but this guy was just beating around the bush here and it was getting frustrating)\n\nZaakir: I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that it’s a bigger blessing to spend the night at the home. Brings barakah and what nought. I thought you knew this!\n\nMe: nobody stays at home Zak. Not even the poor.\n\nZaakir: maybe that’s why so many marriages have so minimal barakah and the divorce rate is so high. No offense but I wouldn’t want my wife to remember our first night at some hotel. The hotel don’t need no barakah.\n\nMe: (cracking up) I don’t know mahn. I think Amira will find it weird. And showing her the flat on Friday. That’s too soon. I organised for the sign and lighting just yesterday, they won’t be able to do it in three days. And I didn’t buy any electronics. Not even a coffee machine.\n\nZaakir: come on, you know for a fact Amira has changed these few months. She’s going to want it the right way. And you are a motala. I know you can have anything done last minute.\n\nMe: (sigh) why do you always give me double job? I’m telling you, if Amira freaks out, you in deep waters (pause) wait. (Smirk) did Safiyya put you to this?\n\nZaakir: maybe.\n\nMe: I knew it. You would never have thought of something so sharp.\n\nZaakir: yeah well. Soon you will have a wife to think for you too. It’s about time.\n\nThank goodness Ibrahim managed to sell the night at Hilton. He got one of his friends to hook me up a room at Elangeni for a few hours. I needed some time before the sign lighting was sorted. My mother and sister made sure Amira’s trays were made. Thankfully, maseeha did the choosing. I really don’t know the difference between lilac and violet. To me they all just purple. Why can’t girls just see it as simple as it is? It’s just a colour.\n\nAfter the whole conversation with Zaakir I started seeing everything in a different light. Zaakir was right. Amira did change in the past few months, guess madressa does make a difference, teacher or student, and I liked the change. If it didn’t happen, I probably would not be marrying her. So I decided that I would give a little surprise and rock up in something nobody would expect. It’s the least I could do considering the pressure I had put her under. It took me a three hours of online shopping to get the right outfit. I had no idea it was this difficult to find good Islamic wear. Look for a good tuxedo and you’ll find not one but hundreds of good ones within seconds. Even Siri can get it for you. But trying to find an Arab outfit for your nikah that is in three days, not a very easy task.\n\nI wasn’t feeling the nerves everyone asked me about. I wasn’t sure if it was just me or what but I felt nothing. No queasiness. No nervousness. No nothing. Not even a mosquito in my tummy. Everyone else seemed to be excited and kept poking and prodding me while asking how I was feeling. Trust me this is not better than them asking you when’s your turn. I gave them the answers their anxious faces waited for, the answers that were absolute lies. While inside I was dying with fear that something might be wrong because I wasn’t feeling anything but numbness.\n\nBut then Friday came…\n\nI think my stomach was a little delayed on the whole feeling nervous stuff because the minute it dawned on me that my nikah was today, I felt it. And mahn was it nerve wrecking. I couldn’t even eat breakfast. I never have a problem with eating breakfast. This marriage thing is so messed up.\n\nThe house was filled with aunties running up and down, the girls in my family all stood by the mirrors painting their faces with everything they took out of their makeup back, the kids ran around in their wedding clothes and the men all sat around and ate sweetmeats while talking business. I paced around like a lonely soul.\n\nWhen the time to leave was near I put on my white kurta and pulled on the Arabian bisht. I carried the agal piece, which is the head scarf, in my hand. My mother fussed at me when I was leaving and insisted she wanted to put in on for me so I let her. She pulled me to the huge mirror in our passage and pinching my cheeks exclaimed, “My handsome Arab is getting married today. You still mummy’s boy but. You tell my Amira that will you.”\n\nMe: (laughing) I’ll do that mummy (wink) I’ll do that. (I bent down to give a peck on her forehead and turned to leave. My eyes didn’t miss to see the tear she quickly wiped away. This ladies, always getting so emotional about everything)\n\nI sat at the masjid like a nervous wreck on the inside but contained myself on the outside. Keep calm imraan. It’s just your nikah. I sat there the entire time trying so hard to concentrate I lost concentration. I wondered if amira was sitting right now and listening. Off course she was. I could just imagine how she would be sitting, legs crossed, with her hands entangled and a straight face, listening carefully. I wonder if she was already in her gown. Maybe her mother allowed her to wear that dress she wanted to wear. No, naseema would have told me. She’s probably in her gown, the bride always gets ready like ages before the function. Will I get to see her before the wedding? Oh no what will I say? Gosh pay attention mahn. Stop thinking about her.\n\nIt got even worse when the qutbah was coming to an end and I realised that the moment was coming. My moment. When the mike was faced my way I softly cleared my throat and took a deep breath. This is it. My head suddenly started to spin and my heart got louder and then in that moment every single person seated there disappeared, the receiver line from where I was to where amira was vanished and suddenly it was just the two of us. And the mere imaginative thought of her helped me to find the voice that would make her my wife. My wife.\n\nI jumped off the car, still in a daze and flattened out my kurta. Zaakir whispered to me that I had five minutes with her. I followed him. My mother was standing at the door and she tiptoed to give me a warm hug. We held on for a long time. I gave Amira’s mother a quick hug (I was now her mahram- zaakir informed me in the car) and followed zaakir upstairs. He gave me a tap on the back and went downstairs.\n\nPull yourself together Imraan. She won’t like the soppy you.\n\nAs soon as I cleared my throat, I heard maseeha mumble something and then giggle. She greeted me as she passed by with a squeeze. I wanted to laugh when I walked into the room. The situation that we were both in was actually funny if you really think of it. It’s funny how much changes with the confession of love. I could see how nervous she was in her eyes. They had this deep wide glow that I could just drown in.\n\nI greeted her but she gave me this look of utter shock. I realised it was because of my clothes but then I got worried. What if she doesn’t like it? Nah, she will definitely like it. I remember now, white kurtas make her melt according to maseeha. I asked her if she liked it anyway. Someone needed to start a conversation in here. And it didn’t look like she was about to do that.\n\nI was taken aback by her reply. No wait, I was double taken aback. Falling off a building taken aback. This girl had confidence even on her wedding day. Now I know why I’d choose her anytime.\n\nI smiled at her thinking about how beautiful she looked in full white. She should wear colour often. It brings out the bold in her. I wanted to be nearer to her. Wanted to hold her in my hands, hear her breath and feel her heart beating against my hands.\n\nI was about to mentally reprimand myself for having such thoughts about her when I realised that it was okay. It’s okay. She’s mine now. We are halaal. She is my wife.\n\nI moved closer to her. She was right that I had a thing for her. But did she? Did I have an effect on her? There was only one way to find out. And that one way made me want to laugh despite the nerve wrecking circumstances. She got so edgy it was hilarious.\n\nI sat through the entire wedding impatiently waiting for it to end. Not that it wasn’t nice. It was actually a really smart setup. It must have taken a lot of effort to put it together too. Now I was seeing why Amira wanted a small wedding. She was right, Islam does have wisdom, and it is us that is foolish. Wow, she was really having an effect on me.\n\nI really appreciate all that has been done to make the wedding special but one thing I was extremely grateful for. The menu. I could have hugged whoever picked it out. It was just one mind blowing and taste bud friendly cart du jour. I couldn’t help but taste everything. I even picked at the salad that had some almond dressing on it. It was all just good food. I could only hope Amira was enjoying and appreciating the good food.\n\nIt took forever but finally, Amira and I were in the car and on our way to the hotel. I didn’t open my mouth at all about the flat. I had it all planned out and I needed it to go as planned. I was so nervous when we got to the room. I felt my pocket to make sure the ring was there and only then did I read her the letter. I don’t even know what made me write it. I guess I just needed to tell her. I needed her to know. In fact I was about to scrap it in the last moment. But I didn’t. And it was absolutely worth it. The way her eyes lit up, the way she bit her lip and the way she couldn’t hold back the tears made it all the more worth the while.\n\nAnd if I thought her reaction to that was worth doing anything, I was wrong. Because when I revealed to her that the penthouse was her new home and she leapt into my arms and clung onto my neck, the feeling that proliferated through my body was overwhelming for a guy like me. All those times when I couldn’t sleep at night because of all the issues with the building of the flat, all those days of sweating in the boiling hot sun, all those times of wanting to just give up and all those difficulties in signing forms and doing paperwork. I would do it all again. I would do it a hundred times over just to feel like that again. Because this, this wasn’t some relationship, some marriage or some contract. This. This was love.\n\nAnd yeah there are so many meanings and definitions about love, some of them more accurate than other, but that is no justice to it. Because true love? It is not defined, it is felt.\n\nThis post is dedicated to a fellow blogger…silentliving. jazakallah nominating surtidiaries for the challenge. a challenge i truly enjoyed writing.\n\nAlso dedicated to all my dearest friends. i love you guys to bits.\n\ndont forget to comment below and let me know your thoughts…enjoy…\n\nNerves. nerves provides one with energy. when you don’t have them and you feel at ease, that is when you should be worried. after all, if you’re not nervous, it’s not important to you!\n\nMaseeha slammed her mug onto the kitchen counter and sabeeha had to hit her back to recover her from her coughing fit. we all stared at the phone in the middle of the table, our mouths agape.\n\nImraan: (after a few minutes) hello? you guys still there?\n\nmaseeha: (clearing her throat) tell me that you are kidding?\n\nhe kept silent.\n\nmaseeha: (sigh) gosh, when she said she messed up her life i really thought she was exaggerating.\n\nsabeeha: so she knows that she is preg…having a baby?\n\nimraan: i think thats why she freaked out and overdosed herself.\n\nme: (thinking out loud) thats why she wanted to see me.\n\nimraan: look, i don’t mean to cause any chaos but i don’t think she overdosed herself to take away her emotion. i think it was more than that.\n\nmaseeha: what do you mean?\n\nme: she tried to kill herself!\n\neveryone turned to look at me and i shrugged.\n\nimraan: yeah. thats what i mean. i think she was trying to commit suicide!\n\nsilence.\n\nimraan: hello?\n\nmaseeha: yeah we here. its like this situation is just getting worse and worse by the minute. do you think we should go to the hospital?\n\nimraan: i will be there in 15 minutes.\n\nmaseeha: yeah okay. we will be ready.\n\nshe cut the call and chucked her cell in her handbag.\n\nnaseema: (scrunching her nose) amira, where is your mothers car?\n\nme: we dropped it off at maseeha’s house and jumped in with imraan. no use taking two cars. (shrug)\n\nnaseema: (smirk) really? or is there any other reason you jumped in with imraan?\n\nme: oh get over yourself!\n\nmaseeha: oOh mY GoSH! i completely forgot to tell you guys. i think amira’s grandfather gave imraan a call. HE TOTALLY KNOWS!\n\nnaseema: hee hee hee…(slurping her coffee) i can imagine the road trip home.\n\nA car pulled into the driveway and honked.\n\nsaffiyya: i guess thats my cue guys. my baby is probably missing his mama too much (she placed her hand to her heart and made a sad face) i will see you’ll at the hospital.\n\nnaseema: (thinking out loud) hmm…i wonder which baby she is referring to…\n\nsaffiyya glared at her and stuck out her tongue. and we all laughed. she hugged each of us and let herself out.\n\nimraan picked us up on time and we all squashed (well there was plenty space but you know what i mean) in his car. maseeha sitting in the front. and naseema (unfortunately) next to me. she kept digging her elbow into my side and making her eyes all googly. i could see imraan’s smirk in the mirror every time she did that. i shyly looked down and ignored her.\n\nnaseema seemed to be way too jumpy and excited. maseeha too was excited, i could see, but she kept her calm and pushed aside the excitement for amina’s sake. i still wasnt ready to see amina when we reached the hospital. i was furious that she didn’t tell us and i knew if i went to see her i would say things that i would later regret. but i didn’t tell any of them. maseeha could see me jumpy and she offered to go and see how she is while i stayed in the foyer with naseema. imraan went somewhere unknown to us.\n\ni felt so ashamed and embarrassed that my own blood would ever do something that amina did and somehow the feeling of helping her seemed to be disappearing. i felt sick to my stomach. Here i was feeling bad for thinking that her drama was crashing my party, and here she was knowing all along that she was irreparable. i guess thats us humans, it’s only when the situation is “not that bad” that we attempt to fix it. we don’t even want to try when it has gone from normality to gobsmacking unbelievable. we like to stay in that little bubble of ours and help those in our reach without popping it. we go on saying that we will do everything we can do to help that somebody but then back down as soon as the waters get to cold. we are hypocrites of our own decisions.\n\nBut everything that we judge in others is something within ourselves we don’t want to face. we are conveniently very good lawyers when it comes to our own mistakes but when it comes to others, we are very good judges.\n\ni was so absorbed in my thoughts that i didn’t even realise that naseema was talking to me until she tugged at my abaya.\n\nnaseema: AMIRA!!!\n\nme: (snapping out of my thoughts) huh? oh sorry. what were you saying?\n\nnaseema: i was saying that i changed my mind. i am sorry that i said all of those things about amina. she is pretty messed up but she could do with the support. from what you guys are saying, she is ready to change hers…(she stopped and stared at the doorway, her face turning bright red with fury and shock all at once)\n\nme: naseema?\n\ni swung my head around to see what could have gotten that kind of a reaction out of naseema. A tall guy walked in with a bunch of roses in his hand. he was so familiar. i was so sure i seen those grey eyes somewhere. i looked back at naseema with an inquiry look on my face waiting for her to tell me. she looked like she had recognised them.\n\nnaseema’s eyes were filled with tears and she took in a huge gulp of air. and then it hit me. ahmed. ahmed ismail.\n\ni grabbed naseema and tried to pull her behind the vending machine that stood in the passageway.\n\nnaseema: i…he…ahmed. its ahmed. why did (hiccup)he have to be here? (she closed her eyes and wiped away the tears that fell. her face filled with pain. then she looked behind me and her face filled with fury once again) why is imraan talking to him?\n\ni turned around and low and behold. imraan was shaking ahmeds hand and talking to him.\n\nme: maybe i should go see. why dont you go to amina’s room? ill be there in a sec.\n\nshe nodded and turned to go. and i walked up to where imraan and ahmed was standing.\n\nme: imraan?\n\nthey both turned to me.\n\nme: uhm. do you think you can drop us off at the mall after this? (lame excuse to make my presence known but i am not one who is good at coming up with stories off hand)\n\nimraan: (quizzical look) sure.\n\nme: (looking at ahmed) ahmed right? how’s it going?\n\nimraan: you know him?\n\nme: yeah. he is ahmed ismail.\n\nahmed shuffled.\n\nimraans eyes narrowed.\n\nimraan: oh.\n\nme: so what brings you to netcare?\n\nimraans turn to shuffle.\n\nme: what? why are you both giving me that look?\n\nimraan: (through gritted teeth) can i speak to you for a minute amira?\n\ni nodded and he pulled me aside. far away from ahmeds hearing distance.\n\nimraan: how do you know ahmed?\n\nme: he…he is an old friend. (imraan clenched his fist) a jerk, if you must know.\n\nimraan: tell me about it!\n\nme: (my turn to narrow my eyes) huh?\n\nimraan: amira. lets try not to freak out okay.\n\nme: (getting nervous) that doesn’t make me any less afraid at what you’re about to say imraan.\n\nimraan: he is the father of amina’s child.\n\nthere comes a time when one is unable to handle the incidents played out in front of them. a time when a person reaches a point where everything becomes too much and the ball of fire becomes too big. a point where the combustion is forced out. a breaking point.\n\ni stared at imraan in utter disbelief and shook my head.\n\nme: NOOO!!! ITS IMPOSSIBLE!\n\neveryone stopped what they were doing and stared at us. i could see ahmed nervously shuffling in the seat he had taken.\n\nimraan: i am sorry amira. it is what it is. there is nothing we can do to change it. but like you said. he is a jerk, i don’t know why you say that about him. but for what he has done to amina. he is a jerk.\n\nme: WHY? OF ALL THE GUYS IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE HIM! WHY AHMED. (realising that i was creating a scene i lowered my voice) are you sure?\n\nimraan: yes. we ran the test thrice. why does it affect you so badly that it is ahmed?\n\nme: nothing, its just. nevermind. you won’t understand. (i turned to go but imraan grabbed my arm)\n\nimraan: no. i know there is something you not telling me. you wouldn’t have reacted like that if it wasn’t something bad.\n\nme: let me go imraan.\n\ni shrugged myself out of his grip and ran to the room. there was no way naseema could find out about this. i needed to get her out of this place. i burst into the room in a fit of breaths.\n\nme: (gasping for air) naseema…we…(i stopped)\n\nnaseema turned to me.\n\nnaseema: need to go!\n\ni watched her walk past me and then with a confused look followed her. she closed the room door and calmly turned to face me.\n\nnaseema: (her eyes welling up with tears once again) i know amira. amina told me!\n\nme: i am so sorry nas. you shouldnt have to go thr…\n\nnaseema: no. its okay. really. (wiping her tear away) it is what it is! (shrug) i mean its not like he was mine or anything. (she let out a small laugh) i think this is what i needed.\n\nme: what do you mean?\n\nnaseema: i spent the past few months wracking my brains with maybe’s. maybe it was a mistake. maybe it was just once. maybe he only realised he loved me after that. i wrecked myself everyday thinking that maybe, just maybe we would have ended up happily together if i just gave him a second chance. (pause) i guess its about time i face the reality of the truth.\n\nme: (smile) i am so proud of you. (giving her a squeeze) but if you want to go home now i don’t mind. and i’m cool if you don’t ever want to see amina again.\n\nnaseema: no. how could i ever think that. she might have made a really huge mistake and sin but the fact that he is involved doesn’t mean i must drop out. im okay with seeing her. i have no grudges.\n\ni smiled.\n\nnaseema: just one thing. (i looked at her questioningly) i still wish she brought this drama in any other time but now. i feel so annoyed we can’t celebrate properly.\n\ni laughed at her. her words really inspired me to not give up either on amina. maybe she was irreparable. but that doesn’t mean i shouldn’t try. its true what they say. choosing your friends is indeed very important.\n\nwith amina being pregnant, it would be impossible to send her to the rehab. they refused to accept her. imraan sat down with ahmed and spoke to him. he eventually agreed to marry amina. they flew down to johannesburg that afternoon to see amina’s parents. amina promised to come clean about everything. it wasn’t going to be easy but it was for the best. amina promised to keep us updated.\n\ni finally got to kick off my shoes and jump on my bed after a long dreadfully crazy day. i was mentally and physically exhausted. i indulged myself in a yummy bowl of popcorn and a huge mug of coffee and was in the middle of sorting out my assignments when i heard a knock on my door.\n\nnana: amira?\n\nme: jee. come in.\n\nhe pushed the door open and came in.\n\nnana: you busy?\n\nme: just sorting out my assignments. they never seem to come to an end. (he laughed) so, whats up nana?\n\nnana: i spoke to imraan’s parents. they want to come tomorrow to set the date.\n\nme: (looking at him dazed) to set the date? what da…ohmygosh…date! set the date!\n\nnana: (confused) yes. we agreed to have it with just us. the immediate family. they will be here for supper….\n\nmy nana’s words only dawned on me when i opened my eyes in the morning. don’t ask me how or when but i think i fell off to sleep while he was still there. because my coffee and popcorn was gone when i got up and my textbooks neatly kept on my dressing table. my eyes shot open in the morning. today they are setting the date!\n\nimraans parents were coming. what was i going to wear? how was i going to act? oh gosh, all this was so stressful for me. i wasn’t used to last minute functions…especially when i was the reason. i jumped out of my bed and logged onto my skype as fast as i could. thankfully naseema just came out of the shower.\n\nnaseema: chill girl. you will be fine.\n\nme: yeah but what must i wear? must i wear abaya or a dress? must i put make up or not? and what about shoes? heels or flats?\n\nnaseema: can you calm down! you acting like imraan is coming to see you!\n\nme: news flash! he is! now will you get your self down here. i need your assistance.\n\nnaseema: even bigger news flash. he already agreed to marry you so even if you wear your pj’s he can’t say anything. (pause) in fact, i think he might enjoy that idea.\n\ni glared at her.\n\nnaseema: (laughing) okay. okay. i will be there. soon.\n\nI had a quick shower and washed my hair. i like the idea of freshly washed and dried hair when there is a function. even though i wear scarf and nobody actually sees my hair. weird i know.\n\nnaseema eventually turned up-at midday- calmly strolling into my kitchen as if she couldn’t be bothered that today was the setting the date night. i grabbed her by the shoulders, dragged her upstairs and pushed her into my room.\n\nthree hours later, i walked out of my closet ready to face my future in laws. I glanced at myself in the long closet door mirror and smiled at naseema.\n\nnaseema managed to rummage through the clothes i owned and put together a stunner. she made me wear a plain black abaya that flowed like a dress from the hip down. she topped it up with a beige belt that gave my body a slick yet non revealing look. she chose a floral blazer to go over my abaya. it set just over the belt and as per her order, i buttoned only one button. a black suede pumps gloved my feet and my head was draped with a black scarf with a tiny line of floral stones. we opted for no make up. she smeared on a small amount of lip gloss and lined my eyes with kohl and i was ready. i looked casual yet amazing.\n\nme: not bad.\n\nnaseema: not at all.\n\nme: jazakallah so much.\n\nnaseema: go on. say it. tell me how you just cannot live without me! (she grinned and i stuck my tongue out at here) you look amazing!\n\nthe motala family had arrived and i nervously went to greet them.i plastered on a smile but inside i was dying with nerves. after sitting down for a small chat i excused myself and went up to my room for a breather. it was not easy talking to them. and the fact that i spoke to them for so many years like a normal person didn’t help. i was setting my scarf right when a saw a shadow at my door. i turned around.\n\nimraan: you really should stop stressing. you doing great.\n\nme: what are you doing here? you not supposed to be here!\n\nimraan: (holding his hand up) i know. i’m sorry. i thought maybe if you heard my voice you would be able to calm down.\n\nme: is it that obvious?\n\nimraan: (scrunching his nose) maybe. (pause) to me. everyone else doesn’t seem to pick it up.\n\nme: (rolling my eyes) yeah yeah. now go! if they see you here they will freak.\n\nimraan: (sigh) actually. it was your mother that sent me up.\n\nme: (raised eyebrow) oh really?\n\nimraan: not really. i just came to check on you. see if you okay you know.\n\nme: i am fine. now go!\n\nimraan: right! (turning to go) you look amazing by the way.(and he was gone. sighing, i went back downstairs)\n\nthe rest of the night went really well. the supper, made by my mother, was delicious. imraan’s mum and dad didn’t drill me with any scary questions like i imagined and maseeha was there to hold my hand whenever i felt nervous. imraan on the other hand was acting really weird. he had this smirk plastered on his face the entire time and he was being so shy. i wanted to laugh so badly but for ethical reasons, i had to hold it in. The hours flew by and before we knew it, we were seeing them off to their home.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. i couldnt. the excitement of getting married had not yet dawned on me. but what did was the nerves. i was suddenly nervous about everything. i couldn’t handle it. i felt like my tummy was going to burst into a billion sparks.\n\nThe date was set…and imraan and i were to be married in exactly three weeks…that was until he called…\n\n*drum roll*\n\nAnd todays post is for SHAAKZ-007. jazakallah for always commenting, like four times on each post *happy dance* i love it:) I know i might be a little late, but i wish you and all those out there who are in the midst of the exam fever and nerd season the very best. May you all be blessed with brilliant reports and results possible. Ameen. Enjoy the extra extra extra long post:) dont forget to comment below! *wink wink*\n\nI believe that everything happens for a reason. I have no reason not to. people change so that you can learn to let go. things go wrong so that you can appreciate them when they go right. and good things fall apart so that better things can fall together. And sometimes, you have to fall to fly.\n\nHow many times are we placed in a situation that suddenly opens our mind up to a whole new way of seeing things and there is this sudden change of heart? we often stuck in our bubble, and don’t realize the reality of things until we ourselves are faced with it. its like a mini earthquake that comes into our lives to give us a shake. to wake us up from our slumber and force us to face the harsh reality out there.\n\nMe: Amina? Uh…what…why would…\n\nImraan: (cutting me off) just come here. I will explain everything later. Right now you just need to get here.\n\nMe: okay. Where are you?\n\nImraan: meet me at the gym. The one near the beautician.\n\nMe: uh. Okay. I’ll be right there.\n\nI put the phone down and took a deep breath. To be honest, I had no idea where he was talking about. I wasn’t sure what he was talking about either. Amina? What was she doing there? And what did he mean when he said she was bad? I turned around and Maseeha stood in the doorway.\n\nMaseeha: where is he?\n\nMe: the gym. By the…\n\nMaseeha: (nodding) beautician. Let’s go. (thank gosh for fast learning friends)\n\nI quickly threw on my abaya and scarf and she grabbed her stuff and we ran out. The gym wasn’t that far from us and we got there in no time. The place was barren, except for an old truck that loomed in the area. Imraan was parked on the side of the building and we pulled in next to him. He got off his car as soon as we pulled in.\n\nImraan: its hard to explain this but maybe if you see you will understand.\n\nI shrugged at Maseeha and we followed him to his boot and Imraan explained to us what happened. his story was…crazy.\n\nMaseeha: and she just passed out?\n\nImraan: right in front of me.\n\nMaseeha: so you put her in your boot? And called us here?\n\nMe: are you feeling okay?\n\nImraan: I panicked okay. I didn’t know what to do. She scares me.\n\nMe: so you kidnapped her?\n\nImraan: I didn’t kidnap her! I am trying to help her!\n\nMaseeha: by kidnapping her?\n\nImraan: stop acting so ridiculous. This is a serious thing. I told you’ll I was getting into my car at the garage and she just came to me, she insisted that i take her to amira. before i knew it she was on the floor. out.\n\nMe: (taking a deep breath) this is so ridiculous! we need to get an ambulance. We have to get her to the hospital.\n\nWe called an ambulance for her and managed to get her out of the boot and into the stretcher successfully. Imraan drove us to the hospital.\n\nMaseeha: (in the car) so you telling me that you couldn’t think of getting her to the hospital? call a doctor?\n\nImraan: well…I didn’t. I\n\nMaseeha: (cutting him off) how can you be so silly Imraan? What if it’s something serious?\n\nMe: mas. (taking her hand) drop it!\n\nWe all kept silent.\n\nWe managed to not get ourselves in a frenzy at the hospital while filling in the forms. I answered whatever questions they asked and fibbed a lie about her parents being away. After a long wait they finally let us go in. before we could go see her, a doctor approached us with news as to what exactly was wrong with her.\n\nDoctor: we can tell it’s an over dosage. With what I’m afraid I cannot tell. Maybe you will know?\n\nMe: (choking a cough) overdose? As in drugs? (I held my breath at his reply)\n\nDoctor: yes ma’am. Is she an addict?\n\nMe: I…I don’t know!\n\nMaseeha: will she be okay?\n\nDoctor: she has a mild overdose. It might take a while to get her back to her usual state. But she will be fine. We will have to treat her for a few days. And do some tests. I would recommend rehabilitation. Girls her age ought not to be on drugs. It’s going to ruin her and will be fatal if not treated now. (you don’t say?)\n\nI stumbled backward trying to get my head straight on what he just said. Rehab. Drugs. What was my cousin doing to herself? And where was her parents while she was ruining her life?\n\nmight i add to you that i am not exposed to such a thing often, i do hear of it now and again, but for me it was just so farfetched. it was just too much for my mind to handle.\n\nI started feeling bad for cutting her out of my life after the whole incident with her. She had really made me angry with the stunt she pulled but I had no right to cut off ties with her. She was a good person with good morals and a spectacular character. That was the Amina I knew. And I was aware of what she was slowly becoming, I seen her first hand when she was gaga over Imraan by the way she had changed, her dressing, character, attitude, and yet I let it slip through my hands. And now it was almost too late. what would my father say if he knew how i had left her to ruin her life? he would be so disappointed in me if i didn’t help her out of this mess! but i am just about to start my life. i am about to be someones bride. this was supposed to be all about me. right? i am sure he would understand that.\n\nBecause that’s us humans, we only care about ourselves and our beings. It’s only about us. About me. About myself. as if we are the only ones on earth. We go around judging the whole world and frowning at the actions of others, and yet we never try to help. Yes, maybe we better ourselves, maybe we don’t do the sins that others do, but don’t they have a right to be helped? It could be us in those situations, us in the trap of shaitaan, so deep a cut it would be almost impossible to heal. Wouldn’t we want to be helped? Isn’t that our duty as Muslim brothers and sisters? Weren’t we supposed to have each others back. and you know what’s funny? If a friend had to ask us to “cover” for them when they out with a boy we so happily agree, when a friend wants us to join them for a movie we jump to the opportunity. But when our friends are screaming for help from the trap of shaitaan we do nothing but push them deeper, when there is a perfect time for us to give them the right advice we push it away thinking of how we would look “holy” and “old” and agree with whatever they say be it right or wrong. Is that what kind of friends we have become? Selfish egotistical people who could care less about the wrong our beloved friends and family are doing? And we go on saying that we are true friends…\n\nI snapped out of my thoughts when Maseeha grabbed my hand and pushed me to go inside the room. I hadn’t even realized that we had walked to the room. Opening the door, I braced myself for the worst and made a silent promise that whatever Amina needed to be helped I would do whatever was in my capability to make sure she is back on track. if not for her then for my father’s sake. I was done playing judge. Now It was time to play doctor.\n\nAmina: (sitting up slightly) please don’t tell my father.\n\nMe: we won’t. Not just yet. How are you feeling?\n\nAmina: (she muffled a cry) I’m so screwed over Amira. what am I going to do? (sigh)if my father saw me like this he will die. And my mother? She will be so upset.\n\nMe: hey. It’s going to be fine okay.\n\nAmina: just make this horrible life go away. (crying more) I just want to be back to myself. I don’t even know who I am anymore.\n\nMe: (taking her hand) it’s going to be fine. You will be fine.\n\nAmina: (shaking her head) I doubt that. I can never be fine. You have no idea what I’ve become. The things I’ve done. I’m ruined for life.\n\nMaseeha: no you not! (we both looked at her. She hadn’t spoken all this time) yeah you pretty much overdosed, probably addicted to some sick drug and lost all shame and modesty you had (I made big eyes at her but she carried on, ignoring me) and you practically screwed over. But you still have your eyes, your hands, legs, you still have your health, pathetically unstable right now, but you still have it! and this, as much as it sucks is your wake up call! the call is here, now you got to actually attempt to wake up. there are many people who will be able to help you with no questions, the question is, are you prepared to accept the help with an open hand?\n\nShe was abrupt and firm but her words knocked Amina right where it hurt. She nodded her head at us. and suddenly, I wanted to help her, and like her, I too wanted to see a drastic and sonic change for the better, but nothing happens overnight. We had to take it step by step. *sigh*\n\nMe: so, why don’t you start at the beginning? Tell us everything.\n\nShe gave a meek smile and sighed. A coughing fit later she began her story. And what can I say, the stuff she told us really made me pop my eyes out every now and again. I knew it was a sick world out there. I knew it. but somehow it was just there, it was never here. I think that is where our problem starts. We allow ourselves to judge other people because it does not come close to us. We do not see it firsthand among our close family and friends and thus when we put ourselves in other peoples shoes, we tend to think “that will never happen to me” or “I would never do that”. I myself am guilty for it. if I never knew Amina on a close level I would have reacted in a very different way. Passing un-approving scowls, fake coughs when she talks, making her feel like she was a hopeless thing who destroyed her life. Yes, Amina is to blame for her actions, she was the one who did the deeds and made her decisions but that didn’t give me a right to laugh at her and judge her. Who knows, she might be forgiven for her ignorance, but do I have a guarantee of forgiveness for my arrogance?\n\nHer story was a rather long one and needless to say a very rough one too. She was really in a mess and it was clear that it would be a long journey back to herself. she was gone completely off the rails. Her parents had no idea of her messed up timeline. They were under the impression that their daughter was safe and sound at her lodging, studying all day and night to be a successful and independent lady. They would be completely ruined if they saw her in this state. Her brother, elder, would totally freak and lose his head if he knew of her addiction. He loathed drugs and all that came with it. she owed a lump sum of money to a drug dealer and was currently hiding from him, if he found her, she would be dead. Literally. and might i add, She is madly and insanely in love with a guy she met recently and was involved in a relationship that was not good for our innocent ears to hear off. they are currently thinking about marriage. however, He, just like the rest of the world, did not know of her addiction. each time she told us of the mess she made, it just got worse and worse.\n\nNaseema’s endless calls to get ourselves back home compelled us to leave her and head back home. Imraan met us in the foyer and we headed home.i couldn’t help but feel a little annoyed. i mean yes, i totally understood that amina was going through a lot right now and that she needed someone to help but did she have to choose this time, now, to bring her messed up drama into my life? maybe i was being selfish by wishing imraan didn’t find her so that i could just concentrate on the one dream i have been waiting for my whole life. but it was really hard to not think of how i was robbed of the attention a bride to be was supposed to get. i didn’t even know if my grandfather told imraan yet.\n\nit didn’t take me long to find out though. From the minute I saw the smirk in imraans eyes, when he met us in the foyer, I knew. I knew that he knew.\n\nMaseeha: (looking at Imraan) what?\n\nImraan: what?\n\nMaseeha: why are you smiling like that?\n\nImraan: I’m not smiling! (smiling)\n\nMaseeha: if you smile any wider, your lips are going to tear. (I snorted and the both looked at me, I stopped and cleared my throat) OH MY GAWD! (giggle) HAH! (pointing at Imraan) you know! Haha! You know!\n\nHis cell went off and he grabbed it and answered.\n\nImraan: (into the mouthpiece) what? (pause) okay we coming mahn. Will you guys chill! (He cut the call and everything was silent)\n\nimraan dropped us at my house and we joined our crew, who piled us with questions the second we walked in, for a yummy breakfast. Maseeha was just too good at making breakfast! good thing i will be living with her soon.\n\nNaseema: so what you are saying is that imraan miraculously found amina drug overdosed and now you’ll are playing doctor for her? Uh am I the only one who remembers what a big fat liar amina is? For all we know this is some scheme!\n\nsabeeha: who are you’ll talking about?\n\nnaseema: (turning to her) crazy second cousin to you two. lived in josi but moved to durban to study at UDW. only allah know why she would leave wits for UDW. (eyes lighting up) hehe maybe she was looking for a rameez! (we all laughed) anyway she was crazy over imraan. loong story but lets just say she got on the wrong side of us motalas!\n\nsabeeha: she sounds creepy.\n\nnaseema: exactly. we don’t need that kind of negativity in our life.\n\nMe: she needs our help nas! We can’t leave her! She is my cousin remember ?\n\nnaseema: might I remind you she is the cousin who lied that imraan was her boyfriend, the cousin who Grew up in a good home and went to makhtab and yet it’s hard to tell if she is Muslim since she started uni!\n\nMe: Naseema! We have no right to judge her! She is family and it is my family at the end of the day. You don’t want to help? Fine by me. But don’t go around picking on her.\n\nNaseema: (swallowing) now you taking her part? Fine! Go and help her! Maybe she can be your new best friend! But when she turns around and slaps you, don’t coming running to me! (She gave me a cold stare) that’s your problem amira! You think you can help everyone. (Her voice getting louder) Well guess what? You cant! You not a superhero and this is not some sci fi movie!\n\nme: (getting angry but holding my calm) well I can at least try!\n\nnaseema: (folding her arms) fine!\n\nMe: fine!\n\nMaseeha: are you two done? (looking at both of us) you two are fighting like kids! as if its going to help this in any way!\n\nsabeeha: maseeha is right! you two fighting is really silly!\n\nnaseema glanced at all of us and got off her chair.\n\nnaseema: i need some air. (and she left the kitchen after glaring at me)\n\nthey all looked at me for an explanation.\n\nme: what? (shrug) don’t look at me! i didn’t start it! (saffiyya raised her eyebrow) okay fine. ill apologize. (sighing i got off my seat.) but for the record, she was wrong to pass a judgement on her.\n\nsaffiyya: yeah but not everyone thinks like we do you know. sometimes its harder for others to forgive and forget so easily. maybe you seeing the good in her and was lucky enough to realize your past mistakes. but you cannot expect that from everyone. not everyone changes so easily.\n\namira: (sigh) do i have to apologize to her? cant we just sweep it under the carpet?\n\ni knew the answer to that question so i didn’t stay behind for an answer. i ran up to my room and found naseema on the balcony. i went to stand next to her and we both kept silent for a while.\n\nme: (sigh) i am sorry nas. i was wrong to tell you off like that. think you can forgive this future familia of yours? (puppy dog eyes)\n\nnaseema: well i would have forgiven you…if you were wrong! but i think its me that needs to apologize. i was out of line. i am sorry. (smirk) familia? ooh i like the sound of that!\n\nwe did our line up of forgiveness and hugging like typical friends would and naseema gave me her widest smile and promised me that despite her opinion on amina she would help. she did however make it very clear that it was for me and not for amina’s sake. glad that we were not at each others throat, i grabbed her hand and we went downstairs.\n\nmaseeha, sabeeha and saffiyya all sat around the table still having their coffee. mahn were they slow.\n\nsabeeha: oh good! you here! imraan says he has good news.\n\nimraan: im guessing amira and naseema is finally there now? (i jumped at the sound of his voice and then laughed when i realized it was coming from the phone on the counter.)\n\nme: what’s the good news?\n\nimraan: i have some contacts who are clued up with this whole drug thing and they more than happy to assist. they will keep amina under their care and watch till she is clean. its a completely shariah friendly zone. only girls, no boys, no drugs, no nonsense.\n\nmaseeha: that sounds really good.\n\nimraan: yeah. and they agreed to have her debts paid. provided she does work in return. she will have to work weekday afternoons. i figured that won’t be such a problem since she will be staying there. for now atleast.\n\nsabeeha: where is this place?\n\nimraan: that’s the thing. it is in Johannesburg so she will have to move there. i spoke to the doctor, he said he will be able to have her sent there. he can pull some strings with the hospital to have her transported safely since she can’t be left to go herself. though i don’t know what we going to do about her parents. we need to tell them.\n\nme: i will try convince her but i am not so sure she will be prepared to. but we will make her. we cant hide this for long. the sooner they know the better.\n\nimraan: okay then i will have the documents ready.\n\nnaseema: thank gosh. now we can concentrate on the wedding preparations.\n\nthe room went silent. something naseema has been the course of very often nowadays.\n\nimraan: (after long) speak to amina about talking to her parents. the sooner we move her the sooner she can get better.\n\nmaseeha: yeah okay. we will go visiting hours. lets hope she agrees to go.\n\nimraan: and…urm…there is one more thing. (pause) and you not going to like it!\n\nnaseema: oh no. its never good when you talk in that voice!\n\nimraan: the tests they did? it came through. with results that amina is pregnant!\n\nThis post is dedicated to, anonymous754. Enjoy the post❤️\n\nFriends. A word we consider small and people we consider underratedly. Many of us don’t realise the value of the friendships we are fortunate to be in. We don’t realise the effect our friends have on us and we don’t treasure the advice given to us by our close friends. Some have friends who will dance in the club with them and be there to take them home drunk, who will do anything in their capability to drag them to hell with them. And some have friends who will read salaah by their side and advise them wisely to always remember ALLAH. These are the friends we should treasure with all our heart. For they will be the ones who could be your golden ticket to jannah. And when we are in turmoil with ourselves not sure what to do when making a huge decision. It will be those very same friends who with the help of ALLAH will be there to guide us through.\n\nThe sun devoured my room and I held my eyes tight to climb into a comfort zone of darkness. Seconds later, my eyes shot open and embraced the sunlight. Naseema stood over me with her eyebrows raised and a bemused smile on her face. She greeted me with salaam (much too loud for my liking-it was early in the morning for crying out loud) and put her hands on her hips.\n\nNaseema: wakey wakey sleepy head!\n\nMe: (trying to block the sunlight out) wha…why are you here? (Sleepy eyed) it’s so early\n\nI groaned and turned my back to her. She tugged at the duvet.\n\nNaseema: get up! It’s already nine! You need to give us your answer! Seven hours of waiting is more than enough!\n\ni shot up.\n\nMe: oh MY WORD!\n\nNaseema: what?\n\nme: I have to give my answer! Today! Oh gosh!\n\nNaseema: technically you don’t have to. Although it will be great. Imraan can’t concentrate on anything! (She started giggling)\n\nmy phone started ringing and Naseema grabbed it and put it on loudspeaker. Maseeha’s voice filled my room.\n\nmaseeha: Salaams sister (giggle) haha that’s ironic! Anyhow, do you want to join me for breakfast. I made waffles?\n\nnaseema: ooh yum!\n\nMaseeha: wait! Who am I talking to?\n\nme: you on loudspeaker! Naseema sleep bombed me. (Glaring at Naseema)\n\nmaseeha: guess I’m not the only one super inquisitive to hear what your honor has to say. (Pause) yeah so you guys coming? Mum and dad are gone to the (pause) uh beach. So it’s just us.\n\nNaseema and I looked at each other.\n\nMe: uh I don’t think that is such a good ide…\n\nmaseeha: (interrupting me) imraan is not here if that’s what you referring to !\n\nNaseema:(flashing me a huge smile) give us ten minutes!\n\nShe ended the call and chucked it on my bed. I started to pull the duvet over me for a small nap but she was too fast. She peeled the duvet off me and pulled me up.\n\nNaseema: you are going in the shower!\n\nAfter having the quickest shower ever (Naseema stood by the door and screamed every two seconds-literally) I pulled on some clothes and grabbed my cloak and scarf. Ten minutes later we sat at the motalas pool area gobbling Nutella waffles.\n\nMaseeha: so?\n\nMe: (mouth full) so?\n\nMaseeha: come on tell us! You do have your answer right?\n\nme: (mouth still full) it’s bad to talk with you mouth full.\n\nNaseema: stop changing the subject! (She picked up her fork and pointed it to me)\n\nme: (holding my hands up) okay okay. No need to get violent. Yes I do have my answer and no I am not telling you guys as yet!\n\nAt this point the door opened and imraan walked in (more like ran in)\n\nimraan: mas do you think amira willllllll (he stopped when he saw me) oh. Amira? I didn’t know you guys were (pause) here. (Pause) so I’ll see you later then. Sorry for interrupting.\n\nNaseema: hey to you too cuz!\n\nImraan: Naseema. (He gave a nod) .Good to see you. (he walked toward us and took a strawberry from the bowl) see you later mas.\n\nimraan headed out of the pool deck. before he could pull the glass door behind him, maseeha called out after him with a smirk plastered on her face.\n\nmaseeha: oh and imraan? (imraan turned around to look at her) i think amira will love that shirt!\n\nmaseeha sat back in her lounger with a satisfied smirk. imraan blushed in embarrassment and he rushed out, leaving the door wide open.\n\nmaseeha: and that is what happens when you don’t tell your sister that you proposed to her best friend!\n\nnaseema: (giggling) speaking of that. (turning to me) you still not telling us what your answer is going to be.\n\nmaseeha: yeah amira. whats it going to be? he asked and she said yes? or forever alone?\n\namira: THAT…you guys will soon know.\n\nthey demanded my answer but i was enjoying the suspense they were in. i knew the two of them too well…if i did tell them, the entire south Africa will know within seconds.\n\nafter breakfast, i thanked maseeha and Naseema and I headed home. While in the car I decided it was the best opportunity to check in on her.\n\nMe: hey how are you doing?\n\nNaseema: (innocently) uh I’m great. I think that’s pretty visible.\n\nMe: naw nas you know what I mean. Are you fine? We never really got a chance to talk much after ahmed.\n\nnaseema: (getting angry) dont! Don’t ever mention his name again. (Her anger subsided slightly) Im fine (she clenched the steering wheel) I am a strong girl. (Flashing me her famous smile) besides, it was his loss!\n\ni smile at my beloved friend sitting next to me. I was so proud of her. She was so strong. And even though I know she didn’t quite get over it yet she will soon enough. naseema refused to leave my side when I got home. we strolled into the kitchen dropping our stuff on the table.\n\nmy mother walked in. And I screamed in utter surprise jumping up and down!\n\nme: MUMMY!?? (i squealed in excitement and ran to her) i didn’t know you were coming (we hugged) oh it feels so good to have you here. (pulling apart) wait why are you here?\n\nmum: what do you mean why i am here? you not happy to see your mum?\n\nme: off course i am. but if you were coming you would have called, like a week before you came. and you would have…(pause) oh my gosh is something wrong?\n\ni looked at her wearily. was something wrong? it didn’t look like it.\n\nmum: honey. i just came to see my daughter. (then she added) and my future son-in-law.\n\ni shuffled awkwardly and naseema giggled.\n\nmum: amira. my baby. you getting so big. (tears started welling in her eyes) i cant believe my daughter is about to take the biggest step of her life. where did all the years fly to? (she pulled me into another hug)\n\nme: oh gosh mum. please dont cry. i didn’t even give my answer yet if you must know.\n\nmum: (letting go of me) what? what do you mean you didnt give your answer yet? he asked yesterday!\n\ni just shook my head at her and laughed. How did she even know?\n\nnaseema: so…. i guess sabeeha is going to have to use up all those samosas on her own hey…\n\nwe all laughed.\n\nsabeeha: (appearing at the door) i heard that!\n\ni spun around and flashed sabeeha a huge smile. i didn’t even realise how much i wished she stayed close by so i could see her more often. I rushed over and embraced my sister with all my heart. Sabeeha glowed with happiness.\n\nSabeeha: oh I missed youuu!! (She grabbed my arms and shook me back and forth) you getting so thin madame. Where does all that Nutella even go??\n\nI laughed.\n\nSabeeha: come. You need to help me unpack. I got tons of stuffed tell you.\n\nI followed her up to my room after greeting naseema and promising her that I would tell her whatever happened as soon as it did. when I reached my room i had to literally climb throught the things to get to my bed. Sabeeha had brought almost here entire room with her. As If she couldn’t survive without her hair straightener for a few days. She wore scarf full time fogoodness sake.\n\nme: sabs? You brought your strightner? (Giving her a confused look)\n\nsabeeha: oh that (she waved her hand like it didn’t matter) you wouldn’t believe my silly father. I gave him a list of all the things he should pack away for me in his safe (he had a huge safe in his office) and instead of of packing it he sent it to durban. I think he misunderstood me. Crazy old man! (She mumbled)\n\nme: (laughing) you and you mad stories ! Drama queen! (Teasingly)\n\nsabeeha: excuse me! I am not the drama queen here. You the one who is leaving "
