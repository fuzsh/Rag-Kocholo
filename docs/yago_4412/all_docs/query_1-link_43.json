        "text": "Rebellion of the Southern AtollsWritten by Naseema Mohamed, NCLHR, Male’.IntroductionDuring the Second World War, the British used Gan Island in Addu Atoll as an air andnaval base. Looking back at this period, we can see that it was marked by conflictsbetween the Addu people and the Maldivian central Government in Male’. It was saidthat the reason for these conflicts was the rules laid down by the Maldivian Governmenton the islanders, in their relations with the British at the base. The Maldivian Governmentlaid down these rules because of problems encountered during the early days after thearrival of the British. The Maldivians in Addu were not used to having foreigners in theislands, and the British also needed to know the ways and customs of the people. Tocorrect the situation, the MaldivianGovernment sent Mr. Hussain Hilmy Didi, theMaldivian Government Representative inCeylon (later Sri Lanka) to Addu Atoll toformulate a set of rules for interaction with theforeigners and these rules were explained to allconcerned.The rules were supposed to apply to allMaldivians, but it was noted that some of theofficials sent by the Government to Addu Atollwere indulging in trade, and accepting giftsArial photograph of Gan Island.from the officers. During World War II, theMaldivian Government had given the use of Gan Island gratis to the British. The firstBritish forces landed in Addu Atoll on 29 th September 1941. Since then the close contactsbetween the people of the atoll and the British had led to many problem-creatingincidents. More problems arose in 1944, and Mr Hassan Fareed travelled to the atoll inMarch 1944, on board the ill-fated British minesweeper, the Maaloy, to solve thedisputes. It was on his way back to Colombo from this mission that the vessel waslostwith all on board, torpedoed by a German U-boat. Soon afterwards, Mr. MuhammadAmeen travelled to Addu and conducted the inquiry which found many of the leadersguilty; one of these was Mr. Abdulla Afeef who afterwards became the leader of the later<strong>rebellion</strong>The <strong>rebellion</strong> of the <strong>southern</strong> atolls of Maldives, Huvadhu, Fuah Mulaku and AdduAtolls, was one of the most difficult episodes of the twentieth century for Maldives. In1959 these three atolls decided to secede from Maldives and declared their own republic,United Suvadive Islands.http://nclhr.gov.mv/history.php 1"
