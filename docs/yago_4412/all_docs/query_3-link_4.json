        "text": "List of Maldivian Sultans\n\nMaldives was turned into a Sultanate in 1153 when the Buddhist King Dhovemi converted to Islam. Prior to that the Maldives was a Buddhist Kingdom, a Hindu Kingdom and before that a matriarchal society with each atoll ruled by a chief queen according to some accounts or by others, several theocratic societies ruled by priests known as Sawamias of heliolatric, selenolatric and astrolatric religions. All the rulers before King Koimala only ruled over parts of the Maldives or Deeva Maari (and Dheeva Mahal) as it was known then. Koimala was the first king to rule over all the islands of the Maldives as we know today and the island of Maliku.\n\nThe formal title of the Sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness. After independence in 1965 the Sultan assumed the title King with the style Majesty. This style was used until 1968, when the Maldives became a republic for the second time. The main official Royal residence of the Sultan was the Etherekoilu, a palace in Malé.\n\nThe reigns of Sultans are from three sources. Taarikh (also known as the Tarikh lslam Diba Mahal) by Maldivian chronicler Hasan Taj Al-Din (died in 1727) written in Arabic which covers 670 years of Maldives history, the loamaafaanu copper plates and the third source called Raadhavalhi which was written in 1757 using both Dhives Akuru and Thaana.\n\nThe 7 dynasties of Maldives 1. Theemugu dynasty 2. Umaru veeru dynasty 3. Hilai dynasty 4. Utheem dynasty 5. Isdhoo dynasty 6. Dhiyamili dynasty 7. Hura dynasty\n\nMain article: Theemuge dynasty\n\nName Monarch from Monarch until Notes Sri Soodasarunaditya ~4th cent. BCE unknown Exiled prince and son of King Sri Brahmaditya of the Kalinga kingdom of India.[1] Founder of the kingdom of Dheeva Mari Unknown number of rulers The Mapanansa,[2] the copper plates on which the history of the Kings of Solar Dynasty was written were lost quite early on.\n\nA 4th century notice written by Ammianus Marcellinus (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor Julian by a deputation from the nation of \"Divi\". The name \"Divi\" is very similar to \"Dheyvi\" who were the first settlers of Maldives.[2]\n\nSrimati Damahara mid-tenth cent. mid-tenth cent. She is also spelled as Damahaar.[3] Last ruler of the Solar Dynasty. It is unclear from the records how many other rulers ruled between the reigns of King Sri Srudasarunaditya and Queen Damahara. Married Prince Sri Baladitya from the Kalinga kingdom who later became the first king of the Lunar Dynasty. Al-Jawaliqi, writing in 1135 CE looking at earlier records,[4] describes a queen of Maldives named \"Danhara\" ruling on an island called \"Abannba\".[5]\n\nName Monarch from Monarch until Notes Sri Baladitya around 990 unknown Prince from Kalinga kingdom of India. Married Queen Damahara of the Solar dynasty to become the ruler of Dheeva Maari. Early during his reign King Rajaraja I of Chola captured the northern atolls Minicoy and Thiladhummathi. Although some sources indicate the start of the reign as when Rajaraja I invaded Maldives, a Chinese document from the Tang dynasty, records the visits of people from Mo-lai (Maldives) to China bringing with them gifts from their king, Che-p'o-lo-ti-to (Sri Balāditya) in 658 CE and also in 662 CE.[6] The king mentioned must have been a king of the Solar dynasty. Sri Laukabarana 11th cent. 11th cent. King of the Lunar dynasty. He is son or grandson of Queen Damahara. His name is alternatively written as Sri Loaka Abaaruna. Sri Maha Sandura ~11th cent. unknown Son of King Laukabarana. He had a daughter Princess Kamanhaar (also known as Kamanaar or Rehendihaar), who was banished to the island then called Is-Midu (Addu Meedhoo today). With her she took the Mapanansa, the copper plates in which the history of the kings of Solar dynasty was written. The Mapanansa were later buried by a certain Al-Muhaddith Hassan, and this is why such little information survived about the Solar dynasty.[2] Sri Bovana Ananda unknown before 1117 Son of King Laukabarana and brother of King Maha Sandura. He is the father of King Koimala.\n\nName Regnal Name Duration of Reign Monarch from Monarch until Notes King Mahaabarana Adeettiya (Koimala)[4] Suvasthi Shri Theemuge Rasfireyru Mini Abaaruna Mahaaradhun[8] 24 years 1117 1141 The first king to rule over the whole of Maldives.
