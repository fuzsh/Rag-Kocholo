        "text": "Transitional justice is concerned with the legal and social processes established to deal with the legacy of violence in post-conflict and post-authoritarian contexts. These processes are essentially “creatures of law” – they are established by statute, their work is molded and shaped by lawyers, and their outcomes are benchmarked against what is or is not acceptable in domestic and international law. Concerns have mounted in recent years about the dominance of legalism within the field and the instrumentalization of those most directly affected by past violence. A commonly prescribed – but as yet largely empirically untested – corrective is that transitional justice theory and practice must become more open to interdisciplinary insights and perspectives. The interview – in different guises, contexts and settings – is at the heart of most transitional justice processes. As a historian now working in a School of Law I reflect in this article on the theoretical and practical intersections between law, history, and the interview. Drawing on more than 200 interviews concerning the Northern Ireland conflict and six other international case studies I concentrate in particular on interview-based initiatives that purport to be “victim-centered”. Having identified three interrelated risks - the manipulation of victim voice by vested interests, the affording of authority to particular voices, and the reification or “freezing” of identity - and having related these to the constraints of legal mechanisms and a wider failure to manage victims’ expectations, I argue that a greater familiarity with oral history theory and praxis can usefully illuminate the tensions between legal and historical approaches to engaging voice, and ultimately offer guidance to the shared challenge of victim-centered transitional justice.\n\nThis study discusses the application of the concept of Reparation as an element of Transitional Justice (TJ) in the social transformation process especially after fragile circumstances in the society.The objective of this study is to analyze the application of Reparation in TJ processes in Sri Lanka in the post-conflict context.The term reparation refers to the measures to satisfy victims, such as revealing the truth, holding perpetrators accountable, and ceasing ongoing violations. Sri Lanka recognizes the concept of reparation aiming to assist victims by way of providing material and symbolic support.This recognition empowers affected communities to claim their legal rights as equal citizens. The study, therefore, emphasizes the needs of a Victim Centric Approach and the need to restrict politically initiated administrative measures in the reparation process.Introduction of the Reparation Act No 34 of 2018 to establish the Reparations Office can be regarded as a significant move to synchronize the reparations process in Sri Lanka with international standards.However, inconsistency in the application of the concept of reparation is still noticeable.This study is a library study based on the secondary sources of domestic and international legal instruments, scholarly articles, and judicial decisions.The study elaborates International standards on the concept of Transitional Justice (ICTJ) to find a gap in the Sri Lankan process of reparation in the light of the Victim Centric Approach.The study emphasizes issues related to international standards and domestic applications within the concept of reparations.Finally, this study suggests that the reparation process in Sri Lanka should adopt the Victim entric Approach,therebyable toaddress the individual cases equally and effectively rather than addressing the grievances of specific communities.\n\nTransitional justice represents itself as both a discourse and practice that exists primarily to support victims of human rights violations and gains its moral legitimacy from the fact that victims are deserving and the claim that transitional justice has the aim of acknowledging victims and providing redress. Here, this claim is interrogated in the light of a practice that actually appears to be rooted in liberal state-building, and for which victims are an essential instrument of prescribed mechanisms of transitional justice, such as trials and truth commissions. Evidence is presented that, despite a common rhetoric claiming that transitional justice is ‘victim-centred’, its principal mechanisms, namely trials and truth commissions, are actually driven by the needs of the state. A dominant legalism has seen mechanisms such as prosecution privileged over those that serve victims, such as reparation. One result of this institutionalisation of transitional justice processes is that v...\n\nAs victim participation becomes absorbed by transitional justice mainstream policy, the actual impact and effectiveness of particular victim participation measures and models remains uncertain and illusive. Simultaneously, in view of the myriad of political and socio-economic realities surrounding victims and victimhood in some of the most devastating conflict contexts of the past two decades, the idea of victims as empowered actors driving transitional justice is slowly giving way to processes wherein victims appear, in fact, as marginalised and disempowered. While political elites hammer out political settlements and transitional justice measures, and international experts and professionals act as advisors or staffers of the institutions being established, the victims are simply involved, if at all, at the final stages of the process, in largely unfavourable conditions, and with limited leverage. The present report looks at six cases of victim participation in transitional justice mechanisms: Burundi, Cambodia, Guatemala, Honduras, Kenya and Tunisia. It compares the findings of the case studies conducted by Impunity Watch in each of these countries. It develops an overarching analysis and reaches conclusions regarding the actual practical experiences of victim participation in transitional justice, with an emphasis on participation in official or state-sanctioned TJ mechanisms.\n\nThis article explores the construction of victimhood in transitional societies. Drawn from fieldwork in a dozen jurisdictions as well as elements of criminological, feminist, sociological, philosophical and postcolonial literature, the article focuses in particular on how victimhood is interpreted and acted upon in transitional contexts. It explores the ways in which victims’ voice and agency are realised, impeded or in some cases co-opted in transitional justice. It also examines the role of blame in the construction of victimhood. In particular, it focuses upon the ways in which the importance of blame may render victimhood contingent upon ‘blamelessness’, encourage hierarchies between deserving and undeserving victims and require the reification of blameworthy perpetrators. The article concludes by suggesting that the increased voice and agency associated with the deployment of rights discourses by victims comes at a price – a willingness to acknowledge the rights and humanity of the ‘other’ and to be subject to the same respectful critical inquiry as other social and political actors in a post-conflict society."
