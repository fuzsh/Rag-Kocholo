        "text": "It's been nine years since his last movie and three years since his last TV role, but this month, Ashton Kutcher is returning to the screen.\n\nStarring in Netflix's upcoming rom-com, Your Place or Mine, Kutcher will appear alongside Reese Witherspoon - and he's currently in the thick of promoting it.\n\nWatch the trailer for Your Place or Mine here. Post continues after video.\n\nVideo via Netflix.\n\nThis week, the 44-year-old actor was interviewed by Esquire magazine, and he discussed the new movie and so much more.\n\nHere are 8 things we learned from Ashton Kutcher's latest profile.\n\n1. He's got quite the backstory.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, profile writer Madison Vain delves into Kutcher's 'origin story'.\n\nIn case you weren't aware, the actor is from a city in Iowa, is one of three children (has a twin brother with a mild form of cerebral palsy and a sister) and worked at the local General Mills Factory with his dad until he was 18.\n\nBefore he could even consider university, he moved to New York to work.\n\nAfter a year being broke and living in an overcrowded apartment, Kutcher flew to LA, auditioned for two shows and got both. One of them was That '70s Show.\n\nWhile filming the sitcom, he also took on his first film, Dude, Where's My Car?, his first rom-com, Just Married with Brittany Murphy, and started his own production company and reality TV show (before they were even a thing), Punk'd.\n\nHe was 25 years old.\n\n2. What it was really like dating Demi Moore.\n\nFollowing in chronological order, Vain and Kutcher then discussed his relationship with Demi Moore.\n\nThe couple started dating in 2003, and she was 15 years his senior.\n\n\"The moment that information broke [about our relationship], my life changed,\" Kutcher told Vain, explaining how he went from actor to celebrity.\n\nHe and Moore married in 2005, and Kutcher became a stepdad to her three daughters with Bruce Willis - Rumer, Tallulah and Scout.\n\nHe would look after them when Moore was off working.\n\n\"I was twenty-six, bearing the responsibility of an eight-year-old, a ten-year-old, and a twelve-year-old,\" he said.\n\n\"That’s how some teen parents must experience their twenties.\"\n\nKutcher also discussed the couple trying for a baby of their own but miscarrying.\n\n\"Losing a kid that you think you’re going to have, and that close to thinking you’re going to have a kid, is really, really painful,\" he said.\n\n\"I love kids. I wouldn’t have gotten married to a woman that had three kids if I didn’t love kids,\" he continued.\n\n\"The idea of having another kid would have been incredible. For whatever reason, I had to have that experience.\"\n\n3. And what it was like separating.\n\nIn 2011, Moore and Kutcher separated. He told Vain how it affected him mentally.\n\n\"Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce,\" he said. \"Divorce feels like a wholesale f**king failure. You failed at marriage.\"\n\nHe also likened the tabloids talking about his infidelity to something he did when he was in high school.\n\nWhen the news broke that Moore and Kutcher had split, rumours of Kutcher spread like wildfire.\n\nSpeaking to Vain, the actor recalled how he'd be at industry events and \"people he admired, people who knew what it was like to live publicly\" would be talking about it.\n\nIt reminded Kutcher of when he broke into his high school as a teenager. He was arrested and charged with third-degree burglary, and became the talk of the town.\n\n\"Feeling it again at 32 is, oof. It’s humiliating and embarrassing,\" the actor said.\n\n4. He never needs to make a cent from acting again.\n\nYep, and that's not because he's made enough already.\n\nBesides being an actor, Kutcher owns a venture-capital firm called A-Grade Investments. He founded it back in 2010 and invests in tech companies like Airbnb and Uber.\n\nHe prefers it as his primary job as it allows him to spend more time with his wife and two children, Wyatt, eight, and Dimitri, six.\n\nRecently, he even moved filming Your Place or Mine from Georgia to LA so he could be home in time for dinner.\n\nAs Vain wrote, the film was originally going to be shot in Georgia because of the tax break the state offers Hollywood productions. But to be close to family, Kutcher made a deal with Netflix to pay for the extra production costs to shoot in LA.\n\n\"I have young kids, and I like my kids a lot,\" he said. \"I like spending time with them.\"\n\n5. His relationship with Danny Masterton and returning for the reboot.\n\nKutcher told Vain how he's still close with his That '70s Show co-stars - Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Wilmer Valderrama, Mila Kunis (of course), and Danny Masterton.\n\nIn June 2020, Masterton was charged with three counts of rape from three separate incidents between 2001 and 2003.\n\nHis trial began in 2022 but the judge declare a mistrial. He will now face retrial.\n\nKutcher said Masterton's legal battle is hard to watch and that they remain in touch. (When the accusations were first made public, the two were starring on the Netflix sitcom, The Ranch, together.)\n\n\"Ultimately, I can’t know,\" Kutcher said about what will happen to Masterton.\n\n\"I’m not the judge. I’m not the jury. I’m not the DA. I’m not the victim. And I’m not the accused. And so, in that case, I don’t have a space to comment.\"\n\n\"I just don’t know,\" he added.\n\nAlthough Masterton couldn't return for the sitcom reboot, That '90s Show, Kutcher and many of his other co-stars did. It was Kunis who was adamant they made an appearance.\n\n\"[She] goes, 'You know, we owe our entire careers to this show. It doesn’t matter what the script is, we’re doing it',\" he said.\n\n6. The world wasn't supposed to find out about his autoimmune disease.\n\nIn August 2022, the news broke that Kutcher was unwell. He had been diagnosed with vasculitis, a rare autoimmune disorder.\n\nHe explained to Vain the symptoms started in 2019. Kutcher woke up with a migraine, much worse than ones he'd had previously, and it lasted two weeks.\n\nHe also got vertigo, couldn't walk at one point, and spent seven days in a hospital bed.\n\nIn the interview, the actor explained how he never planned on sharing his diagnosis; he worked on getting better during the pandemic and became adventurous when the world opened again.\n\nBut when filming Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge, Kutcher had what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with the host. He spoke about his health issues but asked them not to air it.\n\nWhen the episode dropped in 2022, the conversation was left in and the world found out.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I have to look at it and be like, 'All right, well, maybe it needed to come out.' Maybe somebody will see this and go, 'Oh this is helpful for me in some way knowing this,'\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully that happens.\"\n\n7. Him and Mila Kunis are super normal.\n\nDespite their mansion and millions, Kutcher and Kunis have a pretty normal family life."
