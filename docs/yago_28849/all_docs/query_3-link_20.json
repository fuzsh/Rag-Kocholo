        "text": "The star of the hit show \"Two and a Half Men\" Ashton Kutcher filed for divorce from actress wife Demi Moore on December 21, 2012, according to a story in the Chicago Tribune. The couple had been separated for over a year before the divorce was announced. Kutcher, 34, is not going to seek spousal support nor does he deny support to Moore.\n\nKutcher and Moore, 50, separated in November 2011 after Kutcher’s sex scandal with a San Diego woman. It was not the first time the former \"That &70s Show\" star had been caught cheating, however. In 2010, Kutcher met a woman in Hollywood, when he was bowling with his wife, and had a brief affair with the woman. Currently, Kutcher is seeing Mila Kunis, who also starred in \"That &70s Show\".\n\nMoore and Kutcher’s relationship began a few years after Moore divorced actor husband Bruce Willis in 2000. The couple was married in 2005. \"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton,\" Moore said in a statement in 2011. \"As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life,\" the statement said.\n\nIf you are planning to file for a divorce, then you will want to hire a divorce attorney in Illinois. Don’t go through it alone. Contact an experienced Lombard divorce attorney at your earliest convenience."
