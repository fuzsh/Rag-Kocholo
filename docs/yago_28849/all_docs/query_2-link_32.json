        "text": "apparently she's holding out for a bigger settlement\n\nhttp://dlisted.com/2012/12/23/two-dollars-0\n\nI just can't warm to this lady, the whole whippits incident was just:eek: I do like her funky chicken dance pic in this article though :D\n\nShe doesn't seem to be able to let go, that's all. It's not like she needs the $$.\n\nShe got a big settlement from Bruce, because they were married for longer, and they have kids together.\n\nI feel bad for her, she clearly has some issues, but trying to hold onto her ex isn't going to solve them.\n\n0\n\nI prefer Bruce Willis myself.\n\nI don't think he was a much better husband to her, though, there were tons of cheating rumors going around him as well.\n\nI think Ashton is an immature douche, but in this case I think he took the blame for the marriage breaking up. I doubt they were together at the time his cheating came out, but he thought it easier to just take the blame.\n\n0\n\nI was sympathetic to Demi at the beginning of the break up but her behaviour and her need to hang on to this marriage is now getting downright embarrassing. Ashton has gone on to another relationship with the gorgeous Mila and I can understand how devastating that must be to Demi, to be replaced by a much younger version of yourself but she should find some self-respect and get on with her life. Ashton is a pretty boy who has been incredible successful but he cannot act for toffees. He is always Ashton in every movie I have seen. He is just lucky that he is beautiful and woman like to look at him but personality wise I think he is dreadfully immature and I doubt if he has actually worked at a relationship in his whole life. He is kind of an empty shell. Pretty but no substance!! That is how he appears anyway. Demi took a risk by marrying him as he was 15 years younger than her! It did not work out. Sadly, these actors have such enormous egos I guess it is next to impossible for her to believe that Ashton no longer wants her!!\n\n0\n\nI may dislike Russell Brand a lot, but a do praise him not trying to get any money from KP. Apparently they ended in less than friendly terms, he could have got $$$$ from her, but he didn't ask for anything. Demi demanding money from Ashton is just petty.\n\nI do think Demi's PR are in a bit of a limbo, they don't know how to spin it. They are trying all directions, taking the Jennifer Aniston route, where she was the cheated on wife, victim of evil Brangelina. Then the next report says, that she has hard time moving on, and is hurt by Ashton moving on with Mila. The next story says, that she is happy in her life, has moved on, but stalled the divorce for financial reasons.\n\n0"
