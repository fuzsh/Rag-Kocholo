        "text": "Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher Tie the Knot!!\n\nUS WEEKLY WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE NEWS BULLETIN: DEMI MOORE AND ASHTON KUTCHER TIE THE KNOT!!!\n\nPOSTED: Sept. 25, 7:35 a.m. PT\n\nUs Weekly is the first news outlet in the world to report that Demi Moore, 42, and Ashton Kutcher, 27, got married Saturday night at a Beverly Hills home in a ceremony in front of more than 100 of their closest friends and family, according to several sources close to the couple. ''It was very last minute,'' one guest told Us. Kutcher's publicist declined to confirm the nuptials, and when asked to confirm the wedding, Moore's publicist Stephen Huvane simply declined comment to Us.\n\nStanding before a crowd that included actors Bruce Willis and Wilmer Valderrama, actress Lucy Liu, Moore's three daughters and their closest family and friends, the couple, followers of the ancient spiritual practice of Kabbalah, exchanged vows in a brief but traditional ceremony. ''Most everyone was dressed formally,'' a source at the wedding told Us.\n\nIt is the third marriage for Moore, who separated from her second husband, actor Bruce Willis, in 1998 (she was married to musician Freddie Moore for four years in the early 1980s). It is the first walk down the aisle for Kutcher, producer and star of the MTV reality show Punk'd and former star of Fox's That '70s Show, who dated actress Brittany Murphy before he began dating the veteran film actress Moore in early 2003.\n\nSource ~ http://www.usmagazine.com/"
