        "text": "14 years ago today, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher exchanged vows in a small ceremony, attended by her ex-husband and close friend Bruce Willis, and the former couple's three daughters, Rumer, Scout and Tallula.\n\nThey were one of Hollywood's most talked-about couples, thanks in large part to their age difference that some just couldn't get over. But the two were together for eight years before splitting in 2011 after a cheating bombshell, a time so tumultuous for Moore that it lead to one of the darkest periods of her life, one she's finally ready to open up about in her new book, Inside Out: A Memoir; fittingly, her documented journey of self-discovery and acceptance comes out on the same date of her wedding to Kutcher.\n\n\"I lost me,\" the 56-year-old star said of the time period immediately following their split during an interview on Good Morning America earlier this week. \"I think the thing if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Moore went on to detail just how much she \"lost\" herself following her split from Kutcher, which she claims came after he cheated on her a second time in 2011.\n\n\"I guess the fundamental question that came forward for me was, 'How did I get here?' \" Moore said during her two-part sitdown with Diane Sawyer for GMA. \"From where I started to what I've experienced, where I've been, how did I get here?\"\n\nAnd that is what she explores in her memoir, reflecting on her troubled childhood, her relationship with her parents, and the sexual abuse she endured as a teenager as a way to reclaim her own life story.\n\nGiven how reclusive Moore has been after her high-profile romance with Kutcher, it's almost shocking how vulnerable and open she is, both in her intimate memoir and in interviews promoting it.\n\n\"As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life,\" Moore's statement continued, seemingly alluding to the cheating claims.\n\nKutcher issued his own statement, taking to Twitter to address their split: \"I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail. Love and light, AK.\"\n\nIn December 2012, Kutcher officially filed for divorce. And that was that, with both parties rarely—if ever—speaking about their marriage and its collapse, with Kutcher moving on and finding love with his former That '70s Show co-star Mila Kunis. The couple wed in 2015 and have two children together.\n\nBut Moore claims that engaging in the threesomes seemed to lead to Kutcher's alleged infidelity, writing, \"Because we had brought in a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he's done.\"\n\nOn GMA, Moore said she learned via a Google Alert of the cheating, and claims that when she asked Kutcher if the story was true, \"He admitted it right away and I think my response was, 'Are you f--king kidding me? [Laughs.] That was it. I felt like I could barely take a breath.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Moore said she had spoken to her ex-husbands before the book came out, but told The Wall Street Journal they hadn't actually read the final product yet.\n\nFor Moore, it's about telling her story in her own words, not getting back at ex-husbands or family members, telling Ellen DeGeneres, \"I feel so good about the point of view, which for me, this is—I have no interest in blaming or villainizing anyone. The journey in the book is about overcoming.\"\n\nShe continued, \"In a sense, this is my story, my point of view. If anyone else in the book, including my daughters, if they see things differently, and in some cases they did—they had some things that they had sensitivity to because it being my story didn't always allow for the context of say things that created the pain they had of when they weren't speaking to me for me to share. It was truly honest about what my experience was.\""
