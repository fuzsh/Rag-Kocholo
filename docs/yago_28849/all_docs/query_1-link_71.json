        "text": "Ashton Kutcher would get jealous over Bruce Willis when he was married to Demi Moore, the star admitted. Sources also claim Bruce Willis was not happy about Kutcher’s presence in Demi Moore’s life even after they split.\n\nBruce Willis and Demi Moore are often regarded as the perfect Hollywood dup who maintained their friendship even after divorce. The celebrity couple went their separate ways in 2000 after a decade of marriage. They co-parent their three daughters Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah Willis. While Demi and Bruce maintained their friendship over the years, Ashton was overwhelmed with jealousy when he came into the picture. Not only that, but insiders say Bruce felt was concerned Demi would be ‘hurt’ after she broke up with Ashton.\n\nAshton Kutcher admits ‘jealousy’ over Bruce Willis\n\nBruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher both had to overcome their feelings of one another to maintain their bond with Demi Moore.\n\nAfter Bruce and Demi parted ways, the Ghost actress married Ashton Kutcher in 2005 after two years of dating.\n\nBoth Bruce and Ashton were candid about the complicated nature of their relationship in the beginning. The actors had to navigate their own insecurities and jealousy to spend time and holidays together.\n\nSpeaking of Bruce Willis, Ashton Kutcher said: “At first it was difficult. You think, ‘He’s the guy who used to sleep with my wife.’”\n\n“But once you overcome the jealousy, which is just your own personal insecurity, it gets easier.”\n\nExplaining how Willis and Kutcher get on so well, the latter revealed: “People ask us, ‘How do you guys get on so well?’ Well, I don’t like everything Bruce does, and I’m sure he doesn’t think everything I do is great But being with Bruce is normal to me now.”\n\n“We go scuba-diving, skiing, we hang out with the girls together, we watch movies, we talk about sport.”\n\nBruce Willis feared Demi would get ‘more hurt’\n\nThe care and affection that Bruce had for Demi did not go away after their divorce. The Die Hard actor has been her friend through thick and thin. An insider revealed Willis was not totally on board with Ashton being in Demi’s life after their marriage ended.\n\nAs Demi and Ashton called it quits, the movie actor still shared his interest in seeing ‘the girls,’ Demi and Willis’ daughters. Talking about the complex situation a source added that the Unbreakable actor though Demi could get hurt again.\n\n“He thinks Demi is just setting herself up to be hurt – and he’s peeved because he’ll be the one having to prop her back up…Bruce doesn’t get why she’s willing to play nice when Ashton’s done nothing but humiliate her,” the insider shared at the time.\n\nEven Bruce himself has talked about how he dealt with his initial jealousy of Ashton. He said: “It’s a hurdle, but I’m fortunate to be the father of three daughters. People want to hold on to resentment and anger and blame and judgment, but Demi and I don’t because of the kids. I credit her, really. She has such a generous spirit about the whole thing.”\n\nBut the family patched things up on all form. Bruce and Demi’s daughters formed a close bond with Ashton, their stepdad, during his time married to their mom. Ashton went on to marry former co-star Mila Kunis and they share two children together."
