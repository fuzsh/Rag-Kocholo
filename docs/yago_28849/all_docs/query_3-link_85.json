        "text": "Following a 10-year break from his acting career, Ashton Kutcher is back.\n\nThe actor’s quiet semi-retirement went unannounced while he focused on his personal life, but after a long, long wait, he’s jumping back in. In an interview with Esquire published on January 31, Kutcher opened up about his time away from acting, his relationship with his wife Mila Kunis, and how he really felt about his divorce from Demi Moore.\n\nReading ex-wife Moore’s 2019 memoir Inside Out left Kutcher with complicated feelings. Moore claimed that Kutcher pressured her into threesomes she didn’t want to have by expressing his “fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed,” she writes. “I didn’t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be.” Moore went on to allege that Kutcher contributed to her struggle with alcoholism by invalidating her experiences. When Kutcher read her allegations, he was “fucking pissed,” he tells Esquire.\n\nThe publication of Inside Out stirred up a media circus around Kutcher and family, he adds. “I’d finally gotten to a place where the press had really laid off me and Mila, and my life and my family. And then the next day, [paparazzi] are at my kids’ school,” he said. Kutcher adds that after keeping his family life private, the intrusion forced him to reflect on his divorce from Moore."
