They share one child together, too.\n\nYou might also remember that Ashton was married to Demi Moore from 2005 to 2013.\n\nIn a new interview with Esquire, Ashton talked about his marriage and subsequent divorce with Demi, as well as their attempts to welcome a child together early in their relationship.\n\nAshton said that his divorce from Demi felt \"humiliating\" and \"embarrassing.\" “Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce,\" he said. \"Divorce feels like a wholesale fucking failure. You failed at marriage.\"\n\n“You own the shit you did wrong, and you go forward,\" he added.\n\nAshton also said he was \"fucking pissed\" when Demi's 2019 memoir Inside Out featured intimate details of their relationship — specifically because of the increased attention it brought to him, Mila, and their family.\n\n“I’d finally gotten to a place where the press had really laid off me and Mila, and my life and my family,\" he said. \"And then the next day, [the paparazzi] are at my kids’ school.”\n\nAlong with his comments on their breakup, Ashton also talked about when he and Demi suffered a late-stage pregnancy loss in 2003.\n\n“Losing a kid that you think you’re going to have, and that close to thinking you’re going to have a kid, is really, really painful,\" he said. \"Everyone deals with that in different ways.\"\n\n“I love kids,\" Ashton added. \"I wouldn’t have gotten married to a woman that had three kids if I didn’t love kids. The idea of having another kid would have been incredible.”\n\n“For whatever reason, I had to have that experience.\"\n\nRead the entire interview here.\n\nShare This Article"
