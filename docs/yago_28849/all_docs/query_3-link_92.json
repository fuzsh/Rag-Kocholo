        "text": "HOW LAME -\n\n601: Demi & Ashton's Punk'd wedding\n\nYou mean Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore's weekend \"wedding\" was one big publicity stunt to help hype his new season of Punk'd? And Us Weekly – who took credit for the exclusive – got majorily punk'd by Ashton & Co.?\n\nWe just got a note from a one John B. Meyers, the same fella whose name is on the domain name registration of AshtonHacked.com, the purported voicemail dumpsite of the That 70s Show star and who denies any association with the \"duo\" posting the messages.\n\nI wanted to let you know that the Us \"exclusive\" about Ashton and Demi getting married is WRONG. Ashton Kutcher is pulling a series of elaborate pranks on the news media for the premiere of his MTV show PUNK'D. I have inside information on this (see e-mail below). I am willing to talk exclusively with the highest bidder. I'm sending this out to a dozen news orgs simultaneously, so write back ASAP if you are interested. Would be a shame to have Us Punk'd without being able to write the retraction yourselves.\n\n​\n\nSay it isn't so, Demi! But snaps to John Meyers, who's trying to milk this for all it's worth thanks to his intimate knowledge of how the website is being used to promote the stunt.\n\nOh, and snaps to PMK/HBH, who have this missive going around about something by the name of \"601\":\n\nAbout part 2 of the stunt: preparations for the ceremony are in full swing, and its actually MORE hell than preparing a real wedding, if that's possible. Please note that the start time has been CHANGED to 8:00 pm, due to a fuckup with the caterer, so we need everyone there NO LATER than 4:00 pm. Players need to be fully miked and in costume by 5:45 pm. Please remember that not everyone attending knows that this is for the show, so bring your a-game and keep your mouth shut. Media is working on some big publicity for this in some major tabs, so don't talk to anyone you don't have to. As always,if anyone asks anything before we've staged the reveal, DENY. We're planning for part 3 to begin the week of 10/3, but let's deal with that after this nightmare is finished (I mean, joyous matrimony.)\n\n​\n\nOr maybe we're the ones getting punk'd and, quite honestly, thanks for caring.\n\nLINK: http://www.jossip.com/gossip/ashton-kutcher/project-601-demi-ashtons-punkd-wedding-20050926.php\n\nDemi-Ashton Wedding Photos\n\nFrom eonline:\n\nLooks like they weren't punking us after all.\n\nDespite refusing to confirm their Sept. 24 nuptials, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher have sold their wedding photos to OK! magazine for an undisclosed sum, providing photographic evidence that the sexy Striptease star and the trucker-hatted Punk'd purveyor are indeed man and wife--or at least a reason facsimile thereof.\n\nThe photos, published Wednesday, show Kutcher, 27, wearing a cream-colored Brooks Brothers suit and a fedora, and Moore, 42, wearing a white Lanvin gown. Both halves of the couple also modeled the traditional red Kabbalah string bracelet on their wrists.\n\nThat would make sense because all accounts described the ceremony as a traditional Kabbalist affair, taking place at the couple's Beverly Hills home before 45 guests, including Moore's ex-husband Bruce Willis and their three daughters, Rumer, 17; Scout, 14; and Tallulah, 11, and Kutcher's That '70s Show pal, Wilmer Valderrama.\n\nAs part of the ceremony, Moore walked around Kutcher seven times which is a symbol of Kabbalah's circle of love. The pair then exchanged--you guessed it--Kabbalist rings, according to OK!'s editor-in-chief, Sarah Ivens.\n\nIt was the first marriage for Kutcher and the third for Moore, who was married to rocker Freddie Moore from 1980 to 1984 and to Willis from 1987 to 2000.\n\nThe couple began dating in April 2003. Kutcher was rapidly accepted by Moore's kids, who reportedly refer to him as MOD, for \"My Other Dad,\" and by Willis, who gave the relationship his blessing early on.\n\nIn a recent interview with Harper's Bazaar, Moore called Kutcher her \"soul mate\" and said they would like to \"expand our family.\"\n\n\"Talk about meeting your soul mate,\" the actress said in the magazine's September issue. \"I truly feel I have been given that gift.\"\n\nThe couple has already shot down numerous pregnancy rumors in recent months. However, with a so-called family expansion in the works, who knows how much longer those denials will stand.\n\nAshton Kutcher can't stop talking about his amazing marriage.\n\nThe 'Butterfly Effect' actor tied the knot with Demi Moore on September 24 last year, becoming a step-father in the process to her three daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah from her relationship with Bruce Willis.\n\nKutcher admits he is besotted with his family and can't believe how happy he is since tying the knot.\n\nHe told Parade magazine: \"I can't help talking about my marriage and my love, because it's all tied together. When it comes down to it, my family is what I do everything for.\n\n\"We waited to get married until we felt like we were already married.\"\n\nAshton also explained how he loves being a step-father and doesn't feel the need to have a baby of his own.\n\nHe revealed: \"There is not a human being I could love more than those girls and their mom.\n\n\"If I had a daughter of my blood, I wouldn't love that child any more. I feel like I have three kids, and we'll see whether we're given another child.\"\n\nThe 'Punk'd' presenter is currently developing a sitcom about a young man whose marriage to an older woman makes him the step-father to kids nearly the same age as him.\n\nHe confessed: \"I want to depict a family that's messy and isn't necessarily two people who met in high school and fell in love and had kids.\"\n\nhollywoodrag.com\n\nDemi Moore is filing for divorce from Ashton Kutcher, she told the Associated Press.\n\n\"As a woman, a mother and a wife, there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life,\" she told the news service.\n\nIn September, it was alleged that Kutcher had cheated on Moore with Sara Leal while he was in Las Vegas. He denied the accusation. Moving vans were spotted at the couple's home in October, leading to speculation that\n\nThe pair were spotted at Bruce Willis's vacation home earlier in November, supposedly working on their marriage.\n\nKutcher and Moore were married in 2005; she was 43 years old, while he was 27 at the time.\n\nUpdate: Kutcher tweeted a statement, writing, \"I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is one of the most difficult things in »\n\nimdb.com\n\nalso, am posting Lainey cus she gives her opinion on timing which i think is interesting:\n\nMajor announcement on a Thursday which...\n\nLet’s come back to that.\n\nDemi Moore confirmed to The Associated Press that she will file for divorce from Ashton Kutcher.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton. As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life. This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation.”\n\nThe San Diego cheating scandal broke 7 weeks ago. For almost 2 months she has struggled with this decision. And as I have written here many times, for her the alternative, leaving him, at her age, in her mind, it was terrifying. But we all asked...\n\nWasn’t the humiliation much, much worse?\n\nThe answer, finally, is yes.\n\nYou have to wonder too though if he forced her there. This is a man who behaved like he wanted to get caught. Because he desperately wanted to get out. It’s a cowardly move.\n\nBut her move...\n\nNow what’s this?\n\nNormally when they want to attract the least amount of attention during the news cycle, they bury it on a Friday at 5pm so that everyone’s gone home and they can take cover for the weekend.\n\nThe fact that she chose to do it today, Thursday, pretty much guarantees that it’ll be the main focus all day tomorrow. And she’ll get at least 3 out of 6 tabloid covers next week too as she’ll have given them enough time to prepare their upcoming issues. Plenty of time to prepare their issues. Line up interviews. Get new information from sources. Send her friends out there to start talking.\n\nDemi has been around a long, long time. She knows how this game works. It’s no accident that she chose today to do this. So ...what does it portend? Everybody’s calling everyone else. Will keep you posted.\n\nDemi Moore is ending her marriage to fellow actor Ashton Kutcher, she told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nMoore, 49, and Kutcher, 33, were wed in September 2005, but the couple’s relationship became tabloid fodder in recent months as rumors swirled about Kutcher’s alleged infidelity.\n\n“It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton. As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life. This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation,” she said in her statement to the AP.\n\nThe pair frequently used Twitter to communicate with each other as millions of fans followed along.\n\n“I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi,” Kutcher tweeted Thursday. “Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail.”\n\nMoore said in 2007 that her May-December relationship with the star of “That ’70s Show” and “Punk’d” — who is 15 years younger than Moore — “caught us both by surprise.”\n\n“If somebody would have said, ‘OK, here is the prediction: You’re going to meet a man 25 years old and he’s going to see being with you and having your three kids as a bonus,’ I would have said, ‘Keep dreaming,’” Moore said in a 2007 interview with Vanity Fair. “I think it caught us both by surprise, and particularly him.”\n\nKutcher became a stepfather to Moore’s three daughters — Rumer, Scout and Tallulah Belle — from her 13-year marriage to actor Bruce Willis. Moore and Willis divorced in 2000 but remained friendly. Moore and Kutcher were photographed socializing with Willis, and the couple attended Willis’ wedding to model-actress Emma Heming in 2009.\n\nMoore and Kutcher created the DNA Foundation, also known as the Demi and Ashton Foundation, in 2010 to combat the organized sexual exploitation of girls around the globe. They later lent their support to the United Nations’ efforts to fight human trafficking, a scourge the international organization estimates affects about 2.5 million people worldwide.\n\nMoore can be seen on screen in the recent films “Margin Call” and “Another Happy Day.” Kutcher replaced Charlie Sheen on TV’s “Two and a Half Men” as is part of the ensemble film “New Year’s Eve,” set for release next month.\n\nLuukMagazine"
