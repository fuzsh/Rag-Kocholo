        "text": "It’s safe to say that Ashton Kutcher didn’t come across as the most thoughtful of husbands in “Inside Out,” the new memoir by his ex-wife Demi Moore.\n\nIndeed, the 57-year-old actress opened up in her book about the two times Kutcher was unfaithful, his desire for threesomes and his callous attitude to her substance abuse problems.\n\nShortly after excerpts of “Inside Out” began to surface, Kutcher posted a “snarky” tweet about how he preferred to focus on his current wife, Mila Kunis, and their two young children. The actor and tech entrepreneur has otherwise refused to publicly comment.\n\nA source told People that Kutcher, 41, “pretty much ignores” all the buzz about Moore’s book and the intimate details she shared about his and Moore’s eight-year marriage.\n\n“He is busy with a full life and has moved on,” the source said.\n\nMoore and Kutcher first began dating in 2003 after they met at a dinner party. Moore was in her 40s and Kutcher was 15 years her junior.\n\nHer once high-powered career as Hollywood’s highest-paid actress in films like “Ghost” and “Indecent Proposal” was winding down. Meanwhile, Kutcher was starring in TV’s “That ’70s Show” but probably became more famous because of his relationship with Moore.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Moore said that dating Kutcher felt like “a do-over, like I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young, with him — much more so than I’d ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my 20s.”\n\nThe couple married in 2005. During their time together, Moore had a miscarriage six months into her pregnancy. The loss, she wrote in her book, left her “empty, desperate, confused. . . . I really lost sight of everything that was right in front of me, which was the family that I had.”\n\nMoore also said she began drinking again after two decades of sobriety. In the book, Moore said Kutcher questioned whether alcoholism was real or not.\n\nBut Moore also said that Kutcher was not to blame for her relapse and said that she wanted to “fit the mold of the woman he wanted his wife to be.” That is, a wife who could drink in moderation and enjoy a glass of wine with her husband.\n\nWhile appearing on “Red Table Talk,” with Jada Pinkett Smith, Moore described her feelings for Kutcher as an “addiction,” similar to her addictions to alcohol and other drugs.\n\n“The addiction and the co-dependency… like my addiction to Ashton — that was probably almost more devastating because it took me seriously away emotionally,” Moore said.\n\nMoore also revealed in her book that she twice went along with her husband’s idea for them to have a threesome. But she said she came to regret the threesomes because, she said, Kutcher used them as a justification for cheating on her in 2010 with a 21-year-old woman he met through her oldest daughter Rumer.\n\nKutcher cheated again in 2011, Moore wrote, adding that she learned about both instances of infidelity through media reports. Moore claimed that Kutcher was not that apologetic.\n\n“Because we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’d done,” Moore wrote.\n\nKutcher’s only response to the unflattering allegations in Moore’s book has been a veiled tweet he posted Sept. 24. It read: “I was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet. Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.” Kutcher was referring to Kunis, and their two children, daughter Wyatt, 4, and son Dimitri, 2."
