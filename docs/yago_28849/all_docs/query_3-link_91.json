        "text": "Ashton Kutcher admits he was “f–king pissed” when his ex-wife Demi Moore’s memoir, “Inside Out,” hit bookstores in September 2019.\n\nAlthough the “That ’70s Show” alum does not “want to open anything up in that realm,” he told Esquire in a feature published Tuesday how the book’s release affected his family.\n\n“I’d finally gotten to a place where the press had really laid off me and [my wife] Mila [Kunis] and my life and my family,” Kutcher, who is the father of daughter Wyatt, 8, and son Dimitri, 6, explained.\n\n“And then the next day, [the paparazzi] are at my kids’ school,” the former “Punk’d” host continued, with the profile noting he does not have any “hard feelings” for Moore.\n\nKutcher, 44, was married to the actress, 60, from 2005 to 2013.\n\nIn her book, Moore reflected on the two threesomes she and the actor had during their time together, also accusing him of influencing her relapse.\n\nThe “Vengeance” star did not comment on the allegations at the time.\n\nMoore was already a mother when she met Kutcher. He became a stepfather to Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, whom Moore shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis.\n\n“I was 26, bearing the responsibility of an 8-year-old, a 10-year-old, and a 12-year-old,” Kutcher recalled, noting that he still maintains a relationship with his former stepkids.\n\nWhile the exes did try having children of their own before calling it quits, Moore suffered a miscarriage at six months pregnant.\n\n“I love kids. … The idea of having another kid would have been incredible,” Kutcher said of their loss. “For whatever reason, I had to have that experience.”\n\nThe “Ranch” alum and Moore separated in 2011, settling their divorce two years later. The split felt like a “wholesale f–king failure” to Kutcher.\n\n“Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce,” he explained. “You failed at marriage.”\n\nKutcher began dating Kunis, 39, in 2013. The former co-stars got engaged two years later and tied the knot in 2015.\n\n“The thing about Mila that made our relationship accelerate was that I had always admired her. Her talent, her skills, her gifts,” the “No Strings Attached” star gushed. “I knew that she didn’t need me. And she knew that I didn’t need her.\n\n“We already knew all of each other’s dirt,” he continued, calling the “Family Guy” star “so much cooler” than him.\n\nKunis gave birth to Wyatt and Dimitri in 2014 and 2016, respectively. Kutcher, who recently got a vasectomy, wants to raise “good decision makers.”"
