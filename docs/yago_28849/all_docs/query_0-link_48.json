        "text": "Mila Kunis (2012-)\n\nMila Kunis and Kutcher met on the set of That 70s Show when she was 14, and he was 19, but they didn’t start dating until 2012 after reconnecting at an A-list party. They got engaged two years later, in Feb 2014, and married in July 2015. They share two children together named Wyatt, born in Oct 2014, and Dimitri, born in Nov 2016.\n\nSarah Leal (2011)\n\nOkay, so one woman came forward to corroborate Demi Moore’s cheating allegations: a woman named Sarah Leal.\n\nShe claimed to Us Weekly that Kutcher slept with her at San Diego’s Hard Rock Hotel back in September 2011, specifically on the night of his six-year anniversary with Moore.\n\nDemi Moore (2003-2011)\n\nDemi Moore and Ashton Kutcher started dating in 2003 after meeting through mutual friends. They married in late 2005 and were together for years before he filed for divorce in Dec 2012. Their divorce was finalized in Nov 2013, amid rumors of his infidelity.\n\nIn her memoir, she wrote about his alleged infidelity, including threesomes he pressured her to get into.\n\nAshley Ellerin (2001)\n\nBack in early 2001, Kutcher started seeing a 22-year-old fashion student named Ashley Ellerin. He said that he “was trying to take her on a date” to a Grammys afterparty, but no one answered the door, so he thought he was “too late and she [had already] left.” She was actually murdered that night by Michael Gargiulo, a.k.a. the “Hollywood Ripper.”\n\nJanuary Jones (1998-2001)\n\nKutcher and January Jones dated from 1998 to 2001, and it was apparently quite toxic. They seemed in love, and moved in together rather quickly, but he was allegedly not supportive of her acting career. While she never confirmed or denied her quote was about him, what she said had people convinced it was about him, per GQ: “The guy I was dating when I first got to L.A. was not supportive. He was like, ‘I don’t think you’re going to be good at this.’ So — f*** you!”\n\nAlong with that, Kutcher allegedly accused Jones of cheating on him with her pal Bruce Willis. And per Demi Moore’s memoir, when Jones was asked about it, she said, “Are you serious? I told him [Kutcher] a hundred times, I didn’t want to f*** that old man!”"
