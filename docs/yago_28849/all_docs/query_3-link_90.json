        "text": "Demi and Ashton were the unexpected couple that we were all lowkey rooting for.\n\nThe two split in 2011 after 6 years of marriage. Now, in 2019, she’s opening up about that time in her life.\n\nDemi and Ashton got together in 2005.\n\nThey met in 2003, but wouldn’t begin dating for a few years.\n\nDemi divorced Bruce Willis in 2000. She and Ashton met at a friend’s party in 2003, when Ashton was 25 and Demi was 41.\n\nI really don’t think their age difference is that big a deal, for the record.\n\nThey revealed themselves as a couple on a red carpet.\n\nLater that year, they walked the red carpet together for the premiere of Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle .\n\nAs an aside, that movie is untouchable and iconic and I will absolutely not hear otherwise.\n\nThey split in 2011.\n\nAfter six years of marriage, Ashton and Demi called it quits.\n\nThis happened amid a number of infidelity allegations against Ashton.\n\nAt least two women come forward to claim he slept with them while married to Demi.\n\nShe spoke to the New York Times about that time in her life.\n\nShe sat down with them to promote the upcoming release of her memoir, Inside Out .\n\nThe book covers her life so far, and leaves no stone unturned. That includes her marriage to Ashton.\n\nShe reclaimed her youth with him.\n\nShe said being with Ashton Kutcher was like, “[…] a do-over, like I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young, with him […]”\n\nShe didn’t get those chances in her actual 20s.\n\nShe continued, “[…] much more so than I’d ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my twenties.”\n\nHer 20s were spent working constantly, filming back to back hits like, Ghost and A Few Good Men .\n\nThings got much darker.\n\nVery early in their relationship, Demi discovered she was pregnant with Ashton’s child.\n\nShe lost the child — a girl — who she intended to call Chaplin Ray, six months into her pregnancy.\n\nShe blamed herself.\n\nSubstance abuse had become a problem.\n\nWhile still pregnant, Demi had taken up drinking again. She lost the child and placed the blame on herself.\n\nThe loss of their daughter didn’t come between she and Ashton, however.\n\nThey wed after two years together.\n\nAfter the wedding, the two pursued fertility treatments in the hope of becoming pregnant again.\n\nHowever, Demi’s substance abuse got in the way. She began abusing Vicodin, as well as drinking even more.\n\nTheir divorce had more to it than anyone knew.\n\nThis was the hidden part of she and Ashton’s divorce.\n\nAmong rumors of Ashton’s infidelity, Demi was slowly abusing substance after substance.\n\nThey separated in 2011, but weren’t fully divorced until 2013.\n\nDemi continued to struggle.\n\nA year after their split, Demi was partying with her daughter, Rumer Willis.\n\nShe suffered a seizure after taking a combination of marijuana and nitrous oxide.\n\nThe situation pushed Rumer away, joining Scout and Talulah in the distance they were keeping from Demi at the time.\n\nThings got worse before they got better.\n\n“I had no career. No relationship.” Nothing to lose, basically.\n\nHer health took a downturn. She did not tell the New York Times what the final diagnosis of her health issues was, but they included autoimmune issues, as well as digestion.\n\nSomething had to be done.\n\n“Something was going on, including my organs slowly shutting down,” she said.\n\nShe also said, “[…] the root was a major heavy viral load.”\n\nDemi chose to enter a rehab that focused on trauma, codependency and substance abuse.\n\nNow, she’s thriving.\n\nShe began writing Inside Out with a memoirist, Ariel Levy.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow says writing it clearly helped Demi work a lot of things out.\n\n“[Women] think we just have to get through everything and bear the burden for everyone in our family.”\n\nShe reconciled with her daughters, too.\n\nAll three were given copies of the book to proofread, but had no objections.\n\nAs for her ex-husbands, Demi was unconcerned with what they would think of the book.\n\n“I don’t know what I hope they feel. Good, not bad.”"
