        "text": "2000\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis divorce two years after they separated. The couple were married for 11 years and had three children.\n\n2003\n\nMoore and Kutcher first meet at a dinner in New York.\n\n2005\n\nMoore marries the then 27-year-old Kutcher at the age of 42 after divorcing Bruce Willis. Kutcher becomes a stepfather to her children Rumer, Scout and Tallulah Belle after a Kabbalah ceremony in front of 100 relatives and friends.\n\n2008\n\nMoore tells the Telegraph's Mandrake that she and Kutcher will spend Christmas with her ex-husband Bruce Willis and his girlfriend Emma Hemming. Moore said: \"I think the key with any past is that you recognise and hold on to what you loved and what you gained and you don't attach yourself to what you've lost.\"\n\n2009\n\nKutcher tweets a picture of Moore wearing a white bikini as she steams his suit, saying: \"I love God!\" In May, he threatened to stop using Twitter if the site took part in a celebrity-based reality show. He had beaten broadcaster CNN to become the first user to have more than one million followers a month earlier.\n\n2010\n\nKutcher is first accused of infidelity with 21 year-old Brittney Jones, who revealed text messages allegedly from the actor.\n\n2011\n\nKutcher was announced as the replacement for Charlie Sheen in the US sitcom Two and a Half Men in May."
