        "text": "What will Demi Moore think?! Mila Kunis told all about her husband Ashton Kutcher's previous marriage to the much-older actress on Marc Maron's new podcast episode, RadarOnline.com can confirm.\n\n\"I married a divorcee!\" the actress, 34, told the WTF host.\n\nWhen asked who her husband had been married to in the past, Kunis answered: \"Demi Moore.\"\n\nThe mother of Kutcher's two kids insisted her husband shared a \"normal\" marriage with Moore, 55, before their 2011 split.\n\n\"They had a normal, real relationship,\" she defended of the May-December union, before referring to Moore's children with another ex-husband, Bruce Willis. \"They had three kids they were raising. He loved those kids.\"\n\nAs RadarOnline.com readers know, Kutcher, 40, was spotted constantly throughout his marriage to Moore with her girls: Rumer, Scout and Tallulah.\n\nShe insisted Kutcher still shares a relationship with Moore's kids, who are all now in their 20's.\n\nKunis also admitted she started dating former That 70's Show costar Kutcher very soon after his divorce from Moore.\n\nWhen Kutcher begged her to move in with him after three months of just \"hooking up,\" \"he had only been single at that point for about a year,\" she confessed.\n\nThough she said she was hesitant, he insisted on staying with her, saying, \"I'm not going to lose you.\"\n\nAs RadarOnline.com previously reported, Kunis had a fractured relationship with Moore in the past.\n\nAfter the birth of the couple's son Dmitri in 2016, Moore tried to give her ex-husband parenting advice, a source told RadarOnline.com at the time â€” but Kunis was having none of it!\n\n\"But Mila just snapped and told Demi that she has had enough. She wants her to just leave them alone,\" said the source. \"Demi didn't have any boys anyways, so Mila seems to feel like her advice is just quite comical.\"\n\nKunis and Kutcher have been married since 2015, two years after his split from Moore was finalized."
