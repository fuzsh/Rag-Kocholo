Kardashian cited “irreconcilable differences” in the filing and asked that the “Odom” be removed from her legal name, seeking no spousal support and requesting that he seek none from her.\n\nAlso in 2013, Kardashian’s mother Kris Jenner and stepdad Bruce Jenner announced that they had separated, and sister Kim Kardashian finalized her year-and-a-half divorce from basketball player Kris Humphries.\n\nMORE: Khloe Kardashian files for divorce from Lamar Odom (Chris Pizzello / Associated Press)\n\n2/19\n\nThe “Glee” actress and “Private Practice” alum made the joint decision to separate, news that was announced in December.\n\n“Their primary focus and concern is for their son,” the reps said on their behalf, additionally asking, as most celebs do, for privacy.\n\nThe two, both 42, met in 1995 in the original production of “Rent” on Broadway. They married in 2003 and had a son, Walker, in September 2009.\n\nMORE: Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs separate after 10 years of marriage (Frederick M.

So for anyone wondering why they’ve been living in different houses, there’s the answer.\n\nThe two say they have no plans to divorce — they’re just great friends who are happier living apart. There was one “ouch” moment, however: Kris told a magazine that if she had one regret it was divorcing Robert Kardashian.\n\nMORE: Kris Jenner, Bruce Jenner announce: We’ve separated (Matt Sayles / Associated Press)\n\n7/19\n\nAfter Miley Cyrus unfollowed Liam Hemsworth on Twitter in September, it was only a matter of time: The two officially called off their engagement.\n\nThe pair met while making the movie “The Last Song” in 2010 and got engaged in May 2012, but their relationship was reportedly on the rocks for most of 2013 amid rumors of infidelity and Cyrus being spotted without her engagement ring.\n\nThe “Wrecking Ball” singer was enjoying quite a bit of time in the spotlight after her controversial performance at the MTV VMAs in August; however, soon after the split was announced rumors surfaced that the “The Hunger Games” star was already seeing another woman and Cyrus was getting cozy with one of her record producers.\n\n“I’m just letting that chapter kind of close and just looking forward to that new one,” Cyrus told Ellen DeGeneres in October, following the split.. “I want to be really clear and determined with everything I’m doing in my life right now, and I have been ....

She indicated that she did not want to pay spousal support, according to court papers.\n\nThe “Shameless” alum hasn’t really spoken publicly about their marriage but the documents say that they wed on March 3, 2011, and separated on October 31, 2011 -- which means their separation lasted more than twice as long as the seven months they were together in their under-the-radar marriage.\n\nMORE: ‘Suburgatory’s’ Jane Levy files for divorce to end brief marriage (Allen J.

The pair stepped out around the time of the Emmy Awards in September 2012, and were photographed together frequently afterward.\n\nWe couldn’t help but wonder if the dragon mother was peeved that he didn’t include her in his Oscar musical flop “We Saw Your Boobs,” since she’s frequently been topless on her HBO series. But, you know, being neglected in that way is probably something most women would actually prefer, and technically, HBO still ain’t the movies.\n\nMORE: Seth MacFarlane and Emilia Clarke of ‘Game of Thrones’ split up (Left: Jason Merritt / Getty Images; Right: Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\n13/19\n\nKaty Perry and John Mayer have flipped their on-off switch to off once again.\n\nThough multiple sources fueled reports in mid-March, those voices seemed to be saying the breakup might not be as final as all that.\n\nIt appears to be work that drove the split, with Mayer readying for a tour after struggling with vocal problems for the better part of two years and the former Mrs. Russell Brand working on her third studio album. The two had been dating for about seven months since a brief break in August 2012. They’d dated casually for a bit before that.

Segel, who is one of the stars of the CBS series “How I Met Your Mother,” primarily resides in Los Angeles, where the comedy films.\n\nThe couple began dating in March 2012 and kept a relatively low profile throughout their relationship.
