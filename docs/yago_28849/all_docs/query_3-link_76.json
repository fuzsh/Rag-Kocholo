        "text": "It’s a real-life Hollywood fairy tale: After playing a couple on-screen as Kelso and Jackie in That 70’s Show, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis reconnected years after the show went off the air and are now happily married with two little ones. From the sitcom to the decade of distance before reconnecting, here is everything you need to know about Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis's relationship.\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis met on the set of That 70’s Show, where they played on-again and off-again couple Kelso and Jackie.\n\nAshton went on to marry actress Demi Moore after he left the show in 2005, while Mila was in a long-term relationship with Macaulay Culkin from 2002 to 2011.\n\nThey reconnected in 2012 at the 69th Golden Globe Awards and got married on July 4, 2015.\n\nThe couple shares two children together: Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, born in 2014, and Dimitri Portwood Kutcher, born in 2016.\n\n1998: First Meeting\n\nWhen Mila was just 14 years old, she met Ashton on the set of Fox’s That 70’s Show, where the two played on-again-off-again couple Jackie Burkhart (Mila) and Michael Kelso (Ashton). Although casting directors required all lead actors to be over the age of 18, Mila was able to lie her way through the audition to get the part, which she admitted to in a 2012 interview with Jay Leno.\n\n\"I told them I was gonna be 18, which, you know, I've said this story before—it's not technically a lie, cause at one point, given all things went right, I was gonna be 18,\" she said. \"They figured out sooner or later that I wasn't, but that's OK.\"\n\nMay 7, 2003: First On-Screen Kiss\n\nThe couple's first on-screen kiss on That '70s Show was actually the first time that 14-year-old Mila had locked lips ever—so sweet, right? Well, not actually. She said that her kiss with Ashton was \"so uncomfortable.\" But let's be real, who's first kiss wasn't?\n\nAshton didn’t realize at the time. \"I'm the first guy she kissed? Oh my god, I had no idea,\" he told People in 2001. \"I'm so glad I didn't know that or it would've been too much pressure.\"\n\nSeptember 24, 2005: Ashton’s First Marriage\n\nAshton married actress Demi Moore, who was 15 years older than him, after dating for two years. The couple made headlines for their wide age gap, which Demi called “silly.” The couple wed in a Kabbalah ceremony at their home in Beverly Hills, and Ashton became a stepfather to Demi’s three daughters from her marriage to Bruce Willis.\n\nMay 31, 2008: 7th Annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball\n\nAt the end of May 2008, Ashton and Mila were seen together at the seventh annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in L.A. Ashton sported a pin-striped blazer and a full face of facial hair while Mila stunned in her dark, undone, wavy locks paired with a tea-length red dress.\n\nJanuary 2011: Mila’s Break Up\n\nMila dated former child star Macaulay Culkin from 2002 to 2011, at which time the couple called it quits.\n\nNovember 17, 2011: Ashton Gets Divorced\n\nAfter six years of marriage, Demi made the difficult decision to divorce Ashton. The same day Demi announced her plan to file for divorce, Ashton tweeted, \"Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail.\"\n\nJanuary 15, 2012: Reuniting at the 69th Golden Globe Awards\n\nNot long after news of Ashton’s divorce broke, Mila and Ashton ran into each other at the 69th Golden Globes. \"I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back,\" Mila told Marc Maron on his podcast in 2018. \"I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot.'...And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my God, it's Kutch.'\"\n\nMila experienced a bit of déjà vu seeing him again after so many years. \"I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever,\" she recalled.\n\nThe timing was right for the two to reconnect, and at the end of the night, Ashton invited Mila to his upcoming housewarming party in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nJanuary 2012: First Kiss\n\nOn the night of Ashton’s housewarming party, the two shared their first kiss. Ashton recalled how it happened in Elle. \"I think I was smoking cigarettes at the time, and I was still a smoker,\" he said. \"And she had quit smoking and she was like, she wanted me to like shotgun a cigarette smoke so she could breathe it in and I was like, 'All right.'\"\n\nHe continued, \"And I started doing this. And gradually through the night, it got closer and closer and closer...It was kind of obvious that things were happening.\"\n\nJanuary 2012: The New Couple Keeps Things Casual\n\nThings escalated quickly after the two reignited the flame at Ashton’s house party and began to hook up regularly starting in January 2012. \"It was the first time ever that I ever slept over at a guy's house since becoming single...\" Mila told Marc Maron. \"When I was single, I was so adamant about never staying at a guy's house, that I was like peacing out. And he was like, 'You're not leaving.' And that was the first time [I didn't.]\"\n\nIt was around this time that Mila and Ashton starred in two separate movies with similar plot lines about a “friends with benefits” relationship gone wrong: Mila in Friends With Benefits and Ashton in No Strings Attached. “We lived our movies out,\" she said. \"We were just like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great.\"\n\nApril 2012: Moving In Together\n\nAfter a few months of casually seeing each other, Mila decided she wasn’t happy with the relationship as it stood. \"I was like, you know what, I actually care about you. I don't want to mess anything up so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much,\" Mila told Marc Maron.\n\nBefore she had a chance to end the relationship for good, Ashton asked her to move in with him. \"If we just paid attention to these movies [we did], we should know s--- like this does not work out in real life,\" Mila said on the 2018 \"WTF\" episode.\n\nFebruary 2014: Engagement\n\nA few months after Ashton and Demi’s divorce was finalized in November 2013, Ashton popped the question. Mila was first spotted showing off her five-carat Tiffany solitaire diamond engagement ring worth a reported $250,000 on February 27, 2014, according to People.\n\nThe rock is so impressive that Mila actually avoids wearing it out in public, she admitted in an interview with Australia’s Kyle & Jackie O radio show. “My engagement ring is in a safety deposit box, and I’m like, ‘I can’t wear this because someone’s going to chop my hand off for it.’”\n\nMay 9, 2014: Pregnancy Reveal\n\nA few months after news of the couple's engagement broke, Mila revealed that she was pregnant on Ellen, saying she had been craving sauerkraut and pickles throughout her pregnancy.\n\nOctober 1, 2014: Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher Is Born\n\nOn October 1, 2014, the couple welcomed their first child, Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. Per Us Weekly, Ashton told Conan O'Brien that parenthood is “the greatest thing on earth.” He continued, \"We're really privileged that we have time and can afford to take time. So we don't have a nanny or a night nurse or any of that stuff. It's just the two of us.\"\n\nJuly 4, 2015: Wedding in California\n\nAfter three years of dating, the couple tied the knot at a private ceremony in Oak Glen, California, on the Fourth of July. Speaking to Glamour in 2016, Mila admitted that she didn’t believe in marriage, however.\n\n\"I grew up in West Hollywood, and my brother has reminded me that when I was like 12, I said, 'When gay people can get married, then I'll get married.' I was ahead of my time. The Supreme Court decision [on same-sex marriage came down], and that's when Ashton and I got married,” she said.\n\nNovember 30, 2016: Dimitri Portwood Kutcher Is Born\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child, a son named Dimitri Portwood Kutcher, at the end of 2016, completing their family.\n\nDecember 3, 2017: First Red Carpet Together\n\nThe notoriously private couple walked the red carpet together for the first time since becoming a couple at the Breakthrough Prize Awards in 2017—five years into their marriage!\n\nJuly 2018: Kunis Talks About Kutcher's Previous Marriage\n\nOn an episode of the WTF with Marc Maron podcast in July 2018, Mila touched on her husband's previous marriage to Demi Moore. \"They had, like, a normal, real relationship,\" she said. \"They had three kids they were raising. He was younger, but he loved those kids.\" Mila added that Ashton is still a part of his stepchildren's lives.\n\nJune 2019: Breakup Rumors Are Shut Down\n\nIn June 2019, media reports flew that the couple had split. In true Mila and Ashton fashion, they responded in a hysterically sarcastic Instagram video. Casually shot in their car, the two mocked the dramatic rumors. Of course, just when we thought we couldn't love them any more, they post this.\n\nMarch 3, 2020: Their Silly Approach to Parenting\n\nOn March 3rd, 2020, Mila and Ashton were featured on a podcast episode of Teach Me Something New. They discussed several aspects of their life from careers to their shared parenting dynamic. It was apparent that the couple's humorous approach to just about everything also transcends into their parenting style. Mila mentioned that they are \"silly at home,\" adding that they are \"very goofy parents when it comes to our children, but that don't have skill.\"\n\nFebruary 7, 2021: Super Bowl Commercial Co-Stars\n\nFor the first time since That’s 70’s Show, Mila and Ashton starred together on the small screen alongside Shaggy in a 2021 Super Bowl commercial for Cheetos.\n\n\"It's so silly!\" Kunis told ET about the commercial. \"Ashton and I, we never work together. I mean, I know we've worked together before [on That '70s Show and more]...but in the midst of quarantine, they sent us this ad to do.\"\n\nMay 2021: Their Home is Featured on Architectural Digest\n\nIn a 2021 edition of Architectural Digest, the couple shared insight on their sustainable L.A. farmhouse. Encompassing an inviting, charming, and modern feel all into one, the design-obsessed duo explained that they truly strived for \"a home, not an estate.\" \"We wanted the house to look like an old barn, something that had been here for decades, that was then converted into a house,\" Ashton said.\n\nCommitted to the design process, the couple was extremely involved in the building of their home from the ground up. \"Ashton and Mila are two of the smartest, more inquisitive people we've ever worked with. We talked about everything from beam sizes, to the details of the cross bracing to the junctures of the wood planks and concrete. These are not the kinds of conversations we have with every client,\" their architect said.\n\nJuly 2021: The Couple Talks Bathing Habits\n\nOn the Armchair Expert podcast, Mila and Ashton revealed their lax approach to their bathing routine for both themselves and their kids. Mila said, \"I didn't have hot water growing up as a child, so I didn't shower much anyway.\" She added, \"But when I had children, I also didn't wash them everyday. I wasn't that parent that bathed my newborn—ever.\" The couple agreed that they only bathe their kids \"if you can see dirt on them. Otherwise, there's no point.\"\n\nMarch 2022: They Raise Money for Ukrainian Refugees\n\nWhen the Ukraine-Russia crisis struck in March 2022, the couple quickly sprung into action. The actors raised more than $34 million for humanitarian aid and temporary housing for refugees. Born in the Ukraine in 1983 and moving to the U.S. at just eight years old, the emergency hit home for Mila. \"Ukrainians are proud and brave people who deserve our help in their time of need,\" she wrote.\n\nJuly 2022: That '70s Show Spin-Off\n\nTo tug at our nostalgic heart strings a little more, the pair returned on the set of That '70s Show for a Netflix spin-off. On the set that began the foundation of their relationship—as well as their claim to fame—back in 1998, Ashton revealed that it was important for the both of them to be a part of the show's revival. \"Mila and I were contemplating it,\" said Ashton. \"We thought, listen, we're only in the position that we're in because of that show, so let's just go back and do this.\""
