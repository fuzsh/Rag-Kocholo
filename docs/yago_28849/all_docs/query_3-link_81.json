        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore were the “it” couple of the 2000s. Despite their 16-year age gap, they were very much in love and stayed married for over 8 years. But as history often proves, public relationships are rarely what they seem. Moore herself detailed their ill-fated union in her 2019 memoir, which left Kutcher quite upset.\n\nNow, after taking some time to reflect on his feelings and memories, Ashton Kutcher is sharing his take on everything that went wrong in their marriage and how it made him the man he is today.\n\nRichard Shotwell/Invision/East News\n\nIn a recent interview, the famous actor admitted that being in such a public relationship with Moore flipped his entire reality. “The moment that information broke, my life changed,” Kutcher revealed. Tabloids kept an eye on their every move, which was challenging in itself. However, with the rise of social media, Kutcher could fire back at rumors, which, he admits, wasn’t the best idea, saying, “It’s stupid to complain about things that you’re contributing to.”\n\nADMEDIA/SIPA/EAST NEWS\n\nKutcher realizes that at the time their relationship began, he was young, arrogant, and pretty irresponsible. But being with Morre meant he had to put on a stepdad hat, as she was a mom to 3 girls. Kutcher said, “I was 26, bearing the responsibility of an 8-year-old, a 10-year-old, and a 12-year-old. That’s how some teen parents must experience their twenties.”\n\nAt one point, Kutcher and Moore expected their family to become bigger, but they had to face a harsh reality. Kutcher said that Moore’s late-term miscarriage was a lot to handle. “Losing a kid that you think you’re going to have, and that close to thinking you’re going to have a kid, is really, really painful,” Kutcher explained. “Everyone deals with that in different ways.” During the following years, the couple tried everything to get pregnant again, but all of their efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nEAST NEWS\n\nIn some way, Kutcher has learned to accept the fact that he and Moore couldn’t become parents together, admitting, “I love kids. I wouldn’t have gotten married to a woman that had 3 kids if I didn’t love kids. The idea of having another kid would have been incredible. For whatever reason, I had to have that experience.”\n\nBut the couple could only endure so much. Kutcher struggled not only with stepparenting and trying to get pregnant, but also with staying faithful. Ultimately, Moore knew they both needed to get out of that relationship and initiated their separation. It hit Kutcher hard. “Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce. Divorce feels like a failure. You failed at marriage,” the actor said.\n\nADMEDIA/SIPA/EAST NEWS\n\nThankfully, those painful lessons led Kutcher to a happy marriage with Mila Kunis. The couple has been married for nearly 8 years, and they share a daughter and a son. Considering they have been friends long before getting romantically involved thanks to their work on That 70’s Show, Kutcher and Kunis seem like true soulmates.\n\nHave you ever been through a divorce? What helped you turn over a new page and move on?"
