        "text": "Tallulah Willis is reflecting on a difficult time in her childhood.\n\nThe 29-year-old recently recalled the effect the early days of her mom Demi Moore's romance with Ashton Kutcher had on her.\n\n\"It was like 2003, my mom had just started dating Ashton,\" Tallulah explained at the Stars on Mars premiere June 5, per Page Six. \"It was a moment, a lot going on and I really went inside of myself, and that did send me into like a total dumpster fire. It was really hard, and I'm still unpacking.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Tallulah—whose dad is Bruce Willis—has spoken about this time in her life. During a 2019 Red Table Talk appearance with Demi and sister Rumer Willis, she noted that she felt \"very forgotten\" throughout the Ghost actress' relationship with the That ‘70s Show alum.\n\n\"Everyone left the house and it was just me living there,\" Tallulah said, before adding of her mom. \"I know that she does [love me], one hundred percent, but in that moment you're hurt, and you can't fathom that someone that loves you would do that to you, and would choose others more than you.\""
