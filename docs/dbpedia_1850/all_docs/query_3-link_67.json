        "text": "Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood, created by the liver and the foods you eat. Two lipoproteins carry your cholesterol, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL is commonly referred to as bad cholesterol. LDL comprises the larger portion of your overall cholesterol count.\n\nLDL is referred to as bad or unhealthy cholesterol because it contributes to atherosclerosis, which are fatty buildups in arteries. Atherosclerosis can increase the risk of heart attack, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and stroke because it narrows the arteries.\n\nApproximately 54.5% of adults in the United States who could benefit from cholesterol medication are taking this medicine. Around 94 million adults in the United States 20 or older have elevated total cholesterol levels exceeding 200mg/dL.\n\nCholesterol won’t dissolve in your blood. Instead, proteins known as lipoproteins carry the cholesterol where it needs to go within the body. Elevated LDL cholesterol levels can increase the risk of many medical conditions, including heart disease and coronary artery disease.\n\nHealthy cholesterol levels help the body manufacture hormones, support cell membranes, convert vitamin D in the skin and aid in digestion. Elevated LDL cholesterol levels cause cholesterol buildup in the arteries, commonly known as plaque. Over time, plaque builds up, narrowing the vessels further. Narrow vessels mean reduced blood flow to your body’s organs and heart.\n\nReduced blood flow can cause chest pain (angina) and increase the risk of heart attacks. Research shows higher levels of LDL are directly associated with an elevated risk for heart disease. Each year, approximately 805,000 people in the United States experience a heart attack, with 605,000 occurrences being the first heart attack.\n\nLDL levels often rise if you eat a diet high in salt, saturated fats and cholesterol, usually found in dairy, processed foods and fatty meats. Lack of exercise, weight, tobacco and alcohol use, genetics, medications and existing health conditions may also raise the risk of high LDL levels."
