        "text": "It's important to get your cholesterol checked regularly. Too much cholesterol in your blood can cause a heart attack or a stroke.\n\nThe good news is that it’s easy to get your cholesterol checked. If your cholesterol is high, you can take steps to lower it — like eating healthy, getting more physical activity, and taking medicine if your doctor recommends it.\n\nHow often do I need to get my cholesterol checked?\n\nThe general recommendation is to get your cholesterol checked every 4 to 6 years. Some people may need to get their cholesterol checked more often depending on their risk of heart disease.\n\nFor example, high cholesterol can run in families. If someone in your family has high cholesterol or takes medicine to control cholesterol, you might need to get tested more often. Talk to your doctor about what’s best for you.\n\nWhat is cholesterol?\n\nCholesterol is a waxy material that’s found naturally in your blood. Your body makes cholesterol and uses it to do important things, like making hormones and digesting fatty foods.\n\nIf you have too much cholesterol in your body, it can build up inside your blood vessels and make it hard for blood to flow through them. Over time, this can lead to heart disease.\n\nWhat do the test results mean?\n\nIf you get a lipid profile test, the results will show a few numbers. A lipid profile measures:\n\nTotal cholesterol\n\nLDL (bad) cholesterol\n\nHDL (good) cholesterol\n\nTriglycerides\n\nTotal cholesterol is a measure of all the cholesterol in your blood. It's based on the LDL, HDL, and triglycerides numbers.\n\nLDL cholesterol is a “bad” type of cholesterol that can block your arteries — so a lower level is better for you. Having a high LDL level can increase your risk for heart disease.\n\nHDL cholesterol is the “good” type of cholesterol that helps clear LDL cholesterol out of your arteries — so a higher level is better for you. Having a low HDL cholesterol level can increase your risk for heart disease.\n\nTriglycerides are a type of fat in your blood that can increase your risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe results of your lipid profile test may also show your non-HDL cholesterol number. Non-HDL cholesterol is LDL cholesterol and the other “bad” types of cholesterol. In other words, it’s your total cholesterol minus your HDL cholesterol. Having a high non-HDL level can increase your risk for heart disease.\n\nFind out what your cholesterol levels are. If your cholesterol is high or you're at risk for heart disease, take steps to control your cholesterol levels.\n\nMake an appointment to get your cholesterol checked.\n\nCall your doctor’s office or health center to schedule the test. Be sure to ask for a complete lipid profile — and find out what instructions you’ll need to follow before the test. For example, you may need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for 9 to 12 hours before the test.\n\nYou may also want to print these questions to ask your doctor about cholesterol and take them to your appointment.\n\nWhat about cost?\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans must cover cholesterol testing. Depending on your insurance plan, you may be able to get your cholesterol checked at no cost to you. Check with your insurance company to find out more.\n\nMedicare may also cover cholesterol testing at no cost. If you have Medicare, learn about Medicare coverage for cholesterol testing.\n\nIf you don't have insurance, you may still be able to get free or low-cost cholesterol testing. Find a health center near you and ask about cholesterol testing.\n\nTo learn more, check out these resources about:\n\nFree preventive care for adults covered by the Affordable Care Act\n\nHow the Affordable Care Act protects you\n\nUnderstanding your health insurance and how to use it [PDF - 698 KB]\n\nKeep track of your cholesterol levels.\n\nRemember to ask the doctor or nurse for your cholesterol levels each time you get your cholesterol checked. Write the levels down to keep track of your progress.\n\nGet active.\n\nGetting active can help you lose weight, lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol, and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol.\n\nAim for at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity a week — try starting with a brisk walk\n\nBreak up your 150 minutes however you want — try doing aerobic activity for 30 minutes 5 times a week\n\nDo muscle-strengthening activities 2 days a week — try lifting weights or doing push-ups\n\nRemember, any amount of physical activity is better than none. If you haven’t been active before, start with just 5 minutes and build up from there.\n\nTo help you get more active:\n\nCheck out our guide to physical activity\n\nUse this tool to build a personalized weekly activity plan\n\nQuit smoking.\n\nQuitting smoking can help lower your cholesterol. If you smoke, make a plan to quit today. Call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) for free support and to set up your quit plan.\n\nCheck out our tips for quitting smoking.\n\nDrink alcohol only in moderation.\n\nDrinking too much alcohol can increase your risk of high cholesterol. So if you choose to drink alcohol, drink only in moderation. That means 1 drink or less in a day for women and 2 drinks or less in a day for men.\n\nLearn more about drinking alcohol only in moderation."
