        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this study, we identified a novel missense mutation p.G651E in the CSF1R gene in a patient presenting with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy, cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. G651 is highly conserved across species ( ) and lies in the TKD domain, the critical domain of CSF1R (PM1). The p.G651H variant was absent from the control databases (gnomAD, 1000 Genomes Project, ClinVar) (PM2). In silico tools indicated the variant was deleterious (PP3), and the patient’s phenotype and family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (PP4). Therefore, according to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for sequence variant interpretation, the p.G651E variant was interpreted as likely pathogenic (6). The patient had the core features of HDLS: age at onset ≤60 years, cognitive impairment and pyramidal signs, autosomal dominant inheritance, bilateral cerebral white matter lesions and thinning of the corpus callosum in brain MRI images. He also carried a CSF1R gene mutation. Therefore, a diagnosis of definite HDLS can be made according to the diagnostic criteria (7).\n\nOur review showed that average age of onset of patients with HDLS is 43 years; however, the onset age can vary from 10 to 71 years. This disease is clinically characterized by two groups of symptoms: neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms (8). The neuropsychiatric symptoms include memory impairment, progressive cognitive decline, depression, apathy, anxiety, and other behavioral or personality changes. Motor symptoms include Parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, dysarthria, dysphagia, and ataxia (8). The most common clinical characteristic of patients with HDLS is cognitive impairment (84%), followed by psychiatric symptoms, Parkinsonism, gait disorders, and dysphagia.\n\nThe neuroradiographic characteristics of patients with HDLS are bilateral but asymmetric T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensities in the deep and subcortical white matter, predominantly in the frontal, frontoparietal, and periventricular areas ( ) (5,8). Early lesions are patchy and focal, but with time spread around and become confluent. The preferential involvement of the frontal white matter may account for the predominant cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms in patients with HDLS. Diffusion-restricted lesions with reduced ADC can be observed in the white matter and can be persistent for several months or more, which can be differentiated from stroke. There was no enhancement and microbleeding. Thinning of the corpus callosum, cerebral atrophy and dilation of the lateral ventricles is typical, even in the early phases of the disease. Calcifications in the white matter on CT scan are characteristic imaging features of HDLS and demonstrate a “stepping stone appearance” in the frontal pericallosal area and punctate appearance in the frontal white matter adjacent to the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles (8). It should be noted that neuroradiographical abnormalities could precede the presence of clinical symptoms. At least three asymptomatic CSF1R mutation carriers with subtle T2 hyperintensities or bilateral white matter lesion, abnormal signals in lateral ventricle and frontal lobe have been reported (9,10).\n\nSo far, there have been no obvious genotype-phenotype correlations regarding HDLS, with some family members showing significant differences in disease presentation and course within the same family. Therefore, the clinical symptoms of patients with HDLS are variable and easily misdiagnosed with other diseases. Patients with HDLS presented with cognitive decline and personality changes in midlife with a progressive course, and evident white matter lesions on MRI should be differentiated with other leukoencephalopathy, such as adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, Alexander disease, or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Patients with predominant motor symptoms are easily misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, especially during the earliest phases of the disease (1). Recently, Konno et al proposed a diagnostic criterion for CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy. The criteria yield high sensitivity (96%) and can successfully exclude other leukoencephalopathy. If a patient fulfills the probable criteria, genetic testing for CSF1R should be performed (7).\n\nThe mean disease duration for patients with HDLS was 6.2 years ( ). However, the rate of progression varies among individuals and patients may develop a rapid progression or a very slow progression (http://cdn.amegroups.cn/static/application/81246daeff6dfc2975d183fab093c632/10.21037atm.2019.12.17-1.pdf). Indicators of rapid disease progression of patients with HDLS were symptomatic disease onset before 45 years, female, white matter lesions extending beyond the frontal regions, an MRI severity score based on a point system [0–57] greater than 15 points, and mutation type of deletion (11).\n\nAlthough HDLS is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, 36% of HDLS cases were apparent sporadic cases (http://cdn.amegroups.cn/static/application/81246daeff6dfc2975d183fab093c632/10.21037atm.2019.12.17-1.pdf). However, whether these sporadic cases reflect incomplete or non-penetrance or were caused by de novo mutations in the CSF1R gene remains unknown. The HDLS pedigrees reported so far showed that mutations in CSF1R have a high penetrance, but in one family carrying the CSF1R p.Q877X mutation and another p.V784M mutated pedigree, the index patient was severely affected since the age of 28 years whereas their parents who carried the same CSF1R mutation still had no neurological symptoms at 69 years and 79 years, suggesting incomplete penetrance in HDLS (9,12). In addition, three confirmed de novo CSF1R mutations (3,9) and two apparent (without paternity confirmation) de novo CSF1R mutations (13,14) have been reported in patients with HDLS, suggesting at least some patients with HDLS are true sporadic and caused by de novo mutations in the CSF1R gene.\n\nCSF1R is an essential factor for development and maintenance of microglia. Approximately 95% of CSF1R mutations in HDLS are located within the TKD ( ), suggesting that loss of tyrosine kinase activity may be necessary for the development of HDLS. Reduced expression of CSF1R was also observed in brains of patients with missense and splice-site mutations, indicating that any type of CSF1R mutation may cause HDLS by haploinsufficiency (4,15) ( ). A mutant CSF1R mouse strain with a haploinsufficient allele developed HDLS-like symptoms, including cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and motor symptoms. White matter abnormalities, enlargement of the lateral ventricles, and thinning of the corpus callosum were also evident on MRI. The mouse model provides strong evidence that CSF1R haploinsufficiency is enough to cause white matter degeneration (16). However, marginally elevated cell surface CSF1 receptor levels with increased Tyr723 autophosphorylation was observed in a HDLS patient with CSF1R p.I843_L844delinsGI mutation, suggesting a mutation-related CSF1R gain-of-function (17). Notably, mutations tend to occur more frequently in the distal part of the TKD than the proximal part (5), and exons 18­–­20 of CSF1R gene are mutation hotspots where 63% of CSF1R mutations exist ( ). Further functional experiments are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of CSF1R mutations.\n\nIn conclusion, HDLS typically presents with broad phenotypic variability, and although it demonstrates an autosomal dominant pattern, sporadic cases are not uncommon. Early recognition of clinical and neuroradiographical characteristics of HDLS is key for the correct diagnosis of the disease, given the poor prognosis, rapid course, and genetic testing implications for family members."
