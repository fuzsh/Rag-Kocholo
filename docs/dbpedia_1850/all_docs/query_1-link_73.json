        "text": "What is high cholesterol?\n\nHigh cholesterol is when you have too much of a fatty substance called cholesterol in your blood.\n\nIt's mainly caused by eating fatty food, not exercising enough, being overweight, smoking and drinking alcohol. It can also run in families.\n\nYou can lower your cholesterol by eating healthily and getting more exercise. Some people also need to take medicine.\n\nToo much cholesterol can block your blood vessels. It makes you more likely to have heart problems or a stroke.\n\nHigh cholesterol does not usually cause symptoms. You can only find out if you have it from a blood test.\n\nInformation:\n\nHeart UK has separate information about inherited high cholesterol that starts at a young age (familial hypercholesterolaemia).\n\nFind out about familial hypercholesterolaemia on the Heart UK website\n\nPage last reviewed: 13 July 2022\n\nNext review due: 13 July 2025"
