        "text": "What is Tangier disease?\n\nTangier disease is a rare condition you can get from your parents. People with Tangier disease have very low levels of HDL (high-density lipoprotein). This type of cholesterol is known as “good cholesterol” because it helps get rid of the bad kind of cholesterol (LDL or low-density lipoprotein) that clogs your arteries.\n\nTangier disease can affect multiple organs in your body and can give you a higher risk of heart disease, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nWhy is it called Tangier disease?\n\nThe name for this disease comes from Tangier Island, which is off the coast of the commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. This is where people discovered the first cases of Tangier disease. However, people in other parts of America and the world have it too.\n\nHow common is Tangier disease?\n\nTangier disease is extremely rare. Healthcare providers have diagnosed about 100 cases of it throughout the world.\n\nHow does Tangier disease affect my body?\n\nIn people with Tangier disease, fat (lipids) can build up because there’s not enough HDL to carry it to your liver, which gets rid of it. This collection of fat enlarges certain body parts, such as:\n\nLiver.\n\nSpleen.\n\nTonsils (these can look yellow or orange).\n\nLymph nodes (part of your immune system).\n\nHeart.\n\nBrain.\n\nYou may also have:\n\nNerve issues.\n\nHigh triglycerides.\n\nAn unusual cloudiness in your eyes that can make it hard to see if it’s bad enough.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Tangier disease?\n\nTangier disease symptoms are different from person to person, depending on where the fatty deposits settle. Symptoms can include:\n\nPain in your stomach or feeling sick to your stomach.\n\nPlaque collecting in your arteries (atherosclerosis).\n\nDry skin.\n\nEctropion (your eyelid flips inside out).\n\nAnemia.\n\nMuscle weakness in your arms, legs hands or feet.\n\nLong-term lymph node swelling that doesn’t come from an infection.\n\nSymptoms can appear at any time from shortly after birth to age 65.\n\nWhat causes Tangier disease?\n\nYou inherit Tangier disease through the _ABCA1 _gene you get from your parents. When this gene is abnormal, a problem with its instructions makes your body unable to move cholesterol out of your cells and into HDL. HDL takes bad cholesterol to your liver, which gets rid of it.\n\nIf you get an abnormal ABCA1 gene from each of your parents, you’ll have Tangier disease. If you get an abnormal gene from only one parent, you become a carrier for Tangier. You may not show signs of Tangier, but still can have low HDL.\n\nIf two parents who are carriers for the abnormal gene have a child, that child — regardless of gender — may:\n\nHave Tangier disease (25% chance).\n\nBe a carrier (50% chance).\n\nNot inherit an abnormal gene from either parent (25% chance).\n\nHow is Tangier disease diagnosed?\n\nYour healthcare provider can make a Tangier disease diagnosis after doing a physical exam and doing blood tests for HDL and one of its proteins. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. If you can’t get a genetic test, your provider can take a tissue sample (biopsy) from several parts of your body.\n\nWhich protein is deficient in Tangier disease?\n\nYou have a very small amount of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) when you have Tangier disease. This protein is part of HDL, which is also low in people with this disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich tests are used for Tangier disease?\n\nTests to help with a Tangier disease diagnosis or to monitor the disease’s effects may include:\n\nNerve and muscle studies (electromyograms).\n\nEye exam.\n\nUltrasound on your belly (abdomen).\n\nUltrasound on your carotid arteries.\n\nCT angiogram of your heart.\n\nEchocardiogram.\n\nExercise stress test."
