        "text": "A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\n\nYou should not eat for 9 to 12 hours before the test.\n\nAlcohol and some medicines can interfere with blood test results.\n\nMake sure your health care provider knows what medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements.\n\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\n\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\n\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\n\nYou want your HDL cholesterol to be high (unless it is due to a condition described below). Optimal values are 60 mg/dL or 1.55 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above.\n\nAt risk:\n\nMen - Less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L)\n\nWomen - Less than 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L)\n\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\n\nLow HDL cholesterol levels may be due to:\n\nEating a diet high in saturated fats or a diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat\n\nLack of physical activity\n\nBeing overweight or having obesity\n\nMetabolic syndrome\n\nDiabetes\n\nA disorder passed down through families in which there are high amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood (familial combined hyperlipidemia)\n\nSide effect of certain medicines\n\nOverall, the treatment of low HDL focuses on increased exercise and changes in the diet.\n\nAn elevated HDL is anything over 80 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L). This can be a result of:\n\nA genetic variation that causes the body to produce too much HDL\n\nOveractive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\n\nDrinking too much alcohol\n\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\n\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\n\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\n\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\n\nHematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\n\nExcessive bleeding\n\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\n\nBredefeld CL, Lau R, Hussain MM.
