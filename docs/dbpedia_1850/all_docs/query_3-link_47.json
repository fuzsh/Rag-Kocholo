        "text": "What Is Hypercholesterolemia?\n\nHypercholesterolemia is the medical term for high cholesterol.\n\nYour body needs some cholesterol to make hormones and digest fatty foods. But too much raises the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular problems.\n\nAbout 38% of American adults have high cholesterol.\n\nThere are two main types of cholesterol:\n\nLDL, or low-density lipoprotein, carries cholesterol to the cells that need it. But sometimes, there is too much LDL. This causes cholesterol to build up in the artery walls. LDL is often referred to as â€œbad cholesterol.\"\n\nHDL, or high-density lipoprotein absorbs bad cholesterol. HDL then carries it to the liver and removes it from circulation. HDL is often referred to as \"good cholesterol.\"\n\nWhen you have too much cholesterol, sometimes your body can't remove it.\n\nFor some people, this is a genetic condition called familial lipid syndrome. Familial high cholesterol affects about 1 in 200 to 250 people around the world.\n\nHypercholesterolemia Causes\n\nCommon causes of high cholesterol include:\n\nEating a diet high in saturated fat and trans fat, often found in animal meat and processed foods.\n\nEating foods high in cholesterol, such as red meat and full-fat dairy.\n\nCertain genetic changes can cause familial hypercholesterolemia. These changes make the body unable to get rid of excess cholesterol, causing it to build up in the blood.\n\nPeople with familial syndrome aren't able to lower cholesterol through diet and exercise alone.\n\nHypercholesterolemia Risk Factors and Complications\n\nWhat you eat and other lifestyle factors play a big role in having high cholesterol.\n\nOther risk factors include:\n\nObesity\n\nSmoking\n\nType 2 diabetes\n\nAge\n\nExcess cholesterol builds up in the bloodstream. It collects in the arteries, causing them to get clogged.\n\nThis makes it harder for blood to flow normally through your body and can lead to heart disease, stroke, or heart attack.\n\nFamilial high cholesterol can lead to heart disease at a young age.\n\nIt can also cause deposits of cholesterol under the skin. These look like bumps that can show up around the eyelids or over the hands, knees, or ankles."
