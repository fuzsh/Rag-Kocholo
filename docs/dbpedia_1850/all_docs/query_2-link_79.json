        "meta_description": "Background: Adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) harbors multipotent cells with potential therapeutic relevance. We developed a method to form adipose spheroids (AS) from the SVF with complex organoid structure and enhanced leptin secretion upon insulin stimulation.\nMethods: SVF was generated from the interscapular brown adipose tissue of newborn mice. Immunophenotype and stemness of cultured SVF were determined by flow cytometry and in vitro differentiation, respectively. Spheroids were generated in hanging drops and non-adherent plates and compared by morphometric methods. The adipogenic potential was compared between preadipocyte monolayers and spheroids. Extracellular leptin was quantified by immunoassay. Lipolysis was stimulated with isoprenaline and quantified by colorimetric methods. AS viability and ultrastructure were determined by confocal and transmission electron microscopy analyses.\nResults: Cultured SVF contained Sca1 + CD29 + CD44 + CD11b- CD45- CD90- cells with adipogenic and chondrogenic but no osteogenic potential. Culture on non-adherent plates yielded the highest quantity and biggest size of spheroids. Differentiation of AS for 15 days in a culture medium supplemented with insulin and rosiglitazone resulted in greater Pparg, Plin1, and Lep expression compared to differentiated adipocytes monolayers. AS were viable and maintained leptin secretion even in the absence of adipogenic stimulation. Glycerol release after isoprenaline stimulation was higher in AS compared to adipocytes in monolayers. AS were composed of outer layers of unilocular mature adipocytes and an inner structure composed of preadipocytes, immature adipocytes and an abundant loose extracellular matrix.\nConclusion: Newborn mice adipose SVF can be efficiently differentiated into leptin-secreting AS. Prolonged stimulation with insulin and rosiglitazone allows the formation of structurally complex adipose organoids able to respond to adrenergic lipolytic stimulation.",
