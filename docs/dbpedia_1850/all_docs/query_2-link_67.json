Moreover, specific compounds may alter their metabolic flexibility, defined as the ability to adapt to nutritional changes, and a required feature for cancer cell invasion and spreading. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the metabolic behavior of 3D CRC spheroids in different nutritional contexts. A long-term-subtoxic-dose experimental set-up was developed to provide insights in (i) the chronic effects of exposure to dietary metabolites, and (ii) the impact of media types with different nutrient-richness. Using extracellular flux analysis and RNA Illumina sequencing, we demonstrated that the access to glucose, glutamine, pyruvate and/or butyrate dictates the metabolic profile of CRC spheroids, who display high levels of both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, the chronic pretreatment with dietary metabolites changed the preferred energetic routes and the response of CRC cells to a shift in nutrient-richness, suggesting an impact on their metabolic adaptability. These results show that chronic exposure to dietary compounds can affect the bioenergetics of CRC spheroids, and underscore the importance of culture medium composition, choice of cell line, and time of exposure in nutritional and metabolic research.}}, author = {{Alderweireldt, Elien and Grootaert, Charlotte and Rajkovic, Andreja and Van Nieuwerburgh, Filip and Van Camp, John and De Wever, Olivier}}, booktitle = {{Ghent Gut Inflammation Group, 4th Meeting, Abstracts}}, language = {{eng}}, location = {{Ghent, Belgium}}, pages = {{1}}, title = {{Chronic exposure to dietary compounds shifts bioenergetics in colorectal cancer}}, year = {{2023}}, }"
