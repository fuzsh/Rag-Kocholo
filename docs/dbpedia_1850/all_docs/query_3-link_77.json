        "text": "You probably know that cholesterol levels are an important measure of your health. In particular, lowering cholesterol can keep your heart and blood vessels healthy. So it might surprise you to hear that there's a \"good\" kind of cholesterol.\n\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is often nicknamed “good cholesterol.” That's because having high HDL cholesterol levels can actually help reduce your overall cholesterol levels.\n\nSo what is HDL cholesterol, and why is it named \"good?” And what do you need to do to increase your HDL cholesterol levels?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nWhat is HDL cholesterol?\n\nYour body needs a certain amount of cholesterol to function normally.To transport that cholesterol to where it's needed, your liver produces molecules called lipoproteins. These particles are made up of fats and proteins that bind to cholesterol so your blood can transport it around your body.\n\nYour liver produces 2 main types of lipoprotein:\n\nHigh-density lipoproteins (HDLs), or \"good cholesterol\"\n\nLow-density lipoproteins (LDLs), or \"bad cholesterol\"\n\nHDL is the densest and smallest type of lipoprotein, and it contains the highest amount of protein. But what makes HDL cholesterol \"good\"?\n\nWhy is HDL cholesterol better than LDL cholesterol?\n\nLet's start with a quick cholesterol recap.\n\nWhen your cholesterol levels get too high, fatty buildups can start to form in the walls of your arteries. Over time, these buildups turn to plaques, which can narrow your arteries and make it difficult for blood to flow through.\n\nThis can increase your chances of developing cardiovascular disease and other conditions including:\n\nHeart attack\n\nStroke\n\nChronic kidney disease\n\nNow, on to HDL cholesterol. This \"good cholesterol\" gets its name because:\n\nIt transports LDL cholesterol, the primary driver of fatty buildups, back to the liver, where it's removed from your body.\n\nIt can have an anti-inflammatory effect, protecting blood vessels from LDL cholesterol.\n\nIt can remove existing plaques from artery walls.\n\nIt has antioxidant effects, which protect chemical messengers and cells in the body.\n\nYour HDL cholesterol level provides an important indicator for the health of your cardiovascular system.\n\nWhat is the normal HDL cholesterol range?\n\nA healthy HDL cholesterol range is 40 mg per deciliter of blood and higher for men and more than or equal to 50 mg/dL for women.\n\nIf HDL cholesterol levels go below 50 mg per deciliter of blood for women and 40 mg per deciliter for men, you are 'at risk'.\n\nYou can determine your HDL cholesterol levels by getting a lipid profile test at your GP. Your doctor will either take a blood sample or do a prick test and carry out a few measurements. These are:\n\nTotal cholesterol\n\nLDL cholesterol\n\nHDL cholesterol\n\nTriglycerides\n\nAfter taking a lipid profile test, your GP can use the information to carry out a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment. This will allow them to calculate the risk of you developing heart problems within the next 10 years.\n\nHow to increase HDL cholesterol?\n\nYou can increase your HDL cholesterol levels by making healthy lifestyle choices.\n\nThese can include:\n\nEating a balanced diet\n\nLosing weight\n\nExercising regularly\n\nAvoiding or quitting smoking\n\nReducing alcohol consumption\n\nThere are also medications your doctor can prescribe if your HDL cholesterol is low.\n\nWrapping up\n\nNot all cholesterol is bad. Having healthy, high HDL cholesterol levels is extremely important for your health.\n\nSo remember to stay active, eat healthy foods, and make sure you regularly check your blood cholesterol levels.\n\nFAqs\n\nQ: When should I test my HDL cholesterol?\n\nA: You should check your HDL levels as part of your lipid profile with a cholesterol level test every 4 to 6 years.\n\nQ: How can I naturally increase my HDL cholesterol levels?\n\nA: Lifestyle changes are the main way to naturally increase HDL cholesterol levels. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, your doctor may prescribe medications to help.\n\nQ: What impact does my diet have on HDL cholesterol?\n\nA: Having a balanced diet is one of the main ways to maintain stable HDL levels. It also contributes to lowering LDL cholesterol, the \"bad\" kind.\n\nQ: Can a high HDL cholesterol level make up for high LDL cholesterol?\n\nA: Unfortunately, we do not have the answer to this. More research is necessary to tell for sure. Either way, it's essential to maintain healthy, low LDL levels."
