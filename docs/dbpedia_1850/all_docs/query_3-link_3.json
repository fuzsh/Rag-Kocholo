        "text": "Research published by the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that people with high levels of C-reactive proteins after having had a heart attack may process high HDL negatively. C-reactive proteins are produced by your liver in response to high levels of inflammation in your body. Instead of acting as a protective factor in heart health, high HDL levels in these people could instead increase the risk of heart disease.\n\nWhile your levels may still be in the normal range, your body may process HDL differently if you have this type of inflammation. The study looked at blood drawn from 767 nondiabetic people who had recently had a heart attack. They used the data to predict outcomes for the study participants and found that those with high levels of HDL and C-reactive proteins were a particularly high-risk group for heart disease.\n\nUltimately, more research needs to be done to determine the risks of high HDL in this particular group of people.\n\nOther conditions and medications associated with high HDL\n\nHigh HDL is also linked to other conditions, including:\n\nthyroid disorders\n\ninflammatory diseases\n\nalcohol consumption\n\nSometimes cholesterol-controlling medications can also raise HDL levels. These are usually taken to lower LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Medication types that have been linked to increased HDL levels include:\n\nbile acid sequestrants, which decrease fat absorption from the foods you eat\n\ncholesterol absorption inhibitors\n\nomega-3 fatty acid supplements, which lower triglycerides in the blood, but also increase HDL cholesterol\n\nstatins, which block the liver from creating more cholesterol\n\nIncreasing HDL levels is usually a positive side effect in people who have low HDL levels as in most cases, it decreases their risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n\nA blood test can determine your HDL levels. In addition to an HDL test, your doctor will also look for LDL and triglyceride levels as a part of an overall lipid profile. Your total levels will also be measured. Results usually take just a few days to process.\n\nCertain factors can influence the results of your test. Talk to your doctor if:\n\nyou’ve recently been ill\n\nyou’re pregnant\n\nyou’ve given birth in the last six weeks\n\nyou hadn’t been fasting before the test\n\nyou’re more stressed than usual\n\nyou’ve recently had a heart attack\n\nAll these factors can lead to inaccurate measurements of HDL in the blood. You may need to wait several weeks before taking a cholesterol test to make sure the results are correct.\n\nIn most people, high HDL is not harmful, so it doesn’t necessarily require treatment. The action plan depends largely on how high your levels are, as well as your overall medical history. Your doctor can help determine whether you need to actively lower HDL levels or not.\n\nYour overall cholesterol levels may be decreased by:\n\nnot smoking\n\ndrinking alcohol in moderate amounts only (or not at all)\n\ngetting moderate exercise\n\nreducing saturated fats in your diet\n\nmanaging underlying health conditions, such as thyroid diseases\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends that everyone over the age of 20 gets a cholesterol test every four to six years. You may need to test more frequently if you have risk factors for high cholesterol, such as family history.\n\nMore research is needed to further understand how high HDL can be harmful in certain people. If you have a personal or family history of either high cholesterol levels or C-reactive proteins, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to regularly monitor your HDL levels."
