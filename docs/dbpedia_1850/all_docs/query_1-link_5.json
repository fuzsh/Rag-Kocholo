        "text": "Being diagnosed with high cholesterol usually means you have either high LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, or a high level of total cholesterol. Total cholesterol is also sometimes called serum cholesterol. It’s the sum of LDL and HDL cholesterol and 20% of your triglycerides, a type of fat.\n\nLDL cholesterol and total cholesterol can be used as indicators of your risk of developing cardiovascular disease and other complications.\n\nLearn more: What is serum cholesterol, and why is it important? »\n\nA variety of risk factors contribute to unhealthy levels of cholesterol, including genetics, lifestyle choices, or a combination of the two.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia\n\nHaving a close relative, such as a parent, sibling, or grandparent, who has high levels of cholesterol is called familial hypercholesterolemia, and it means you may be at a higher risk of having it too, because you may have inherited genes that contribute to high cholesterol levels. People with familial hypercholesterolemia can’t control their cholesterol through diet and exercise alone and may also need to take medication.\n\nObesity or large waist circumference\n\nObesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. A large waist circumference is 40 or more inches for men and 35 or more inches for women. Fat that accumulates in your waist increases your risk of elevated cholesterol and other cardiovascular complications.\n\nElevated blood sugar\n\nHigh levels of glucose can increase LDL cholesterol and decrease HDL cholesterol. High levels of glucose in your blood can also damage the lining of arteries which can increase your risk of fatty deposits building up in your arteries.\n\nLifestyle factors\n\nSome risk factors for high cholesterol may be completely controlled by lifestyle choices. These include diet, exercise, and smoking.\n\nDiet\n\nEating a diet high in saturated and trans fats can increase your cholesterol levels. Foods high in these types of fats include:\n\nred meat\n\nfull-fat milk and yogurt\n\nfried foods\n\nhighly processed sweets\n\nExercise\n\nExercise can increase your HDL cholesterol and decrease your LDL cholesterol. That means that adding exercise to your routine can help promote healthy levels of cholesterol in your body.\n\nAim for 150 minutes of moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise each week. If you’re new to exercise, work your way up to that goal. Be sure to talk with your healthcare professional before starting any new exercise routines. Adding resistance exercises, such as weightlifting or yoga, into your exercise plan may help too.\n\nQuitting smoking\n\nSmoking can have a negative impact on your heart health. That’s because tobacco damages the walls of your blood vessels. This makes it more likely for fat deposits to build up.\n\nTalk with your doctor or healthcare professional about smoking cessation programs that may work for your lifestyle. Sometimes you may need to try more than one method to stop smoking. Having a support group can help.\n\nLearn more: 14 tips for quitting smoking »\n\nHigh levels of cholesterol are usually asymptomatic. To determine your cholesterol levels, you’ll need a blood test. Your primary care physician will draw your blood to check lipid levels. This is called a lipid panel, and it’s a standard procedure for most primary care physicians. Your results will typically include:\n\ntotal cholesterol\n\nHDL cholesterol\n\nLDL cholesterol, sometimes including particle count in addition to the total amount\n\ntriglycerides\n\nThere are two additional cholesterol tests you may have, Lipoprotein-a (Lp(a)) and Apolipoprotein B (ApoB). These tests measure proteins related to LDL and can help your doctor assess your cardiovascular health and risks.\n\nGenerally, doctors use the following guidelines when interpreting the results of total cholesterol:\n\nCholesterol levels and what they mean\n\nhealthy total cholesterolbelow 200 mg/dLat-risk total cholesterol200 to 239 mg/dLhigh total cholesterolabove 240 mg/dLlipoprotein a – Lp (a)at or above 50 mg/dL apolipoprotein B (ApoB)at or above 130 mg/dL\n\nYour doctor will also interpret the other numbers to get a more complete picture of your health.\n\nWhen you should get tested\n\nIf you’re at low risk for high levels of cholesterol, you should start getting lipid panel screenings starting at age 40 for women and 35 for men. You should have your levels tested about every five years.\n\nIf you have more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol, you should start getting lipid panel screenings in your 20s and at more frequent intervals. If the results show you have unhealthy levels of cholesterol or other lipids, your doctor will work with you to create a treatment and monitoring plan.\n\nGenetic testing\n\nIf you think you may be at risk for familial hypercholesterolemia, your doctor may recommend genetic testing. Genetic testing can identify faulty genes and determine if you have familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nIf you do test positive for familial hypercholesterolemia, you may need more frequent lipid panels.\n\nOther cholesterol testing\n\nApolipoprotein (b) (ApoB) and lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a))\n\nNewer cholesterol testing includes ApoB and Lp(a) testing. Both ApoB and Lp(a) are proteins associated with LDL. High levels of these substances may indicate you are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease."
