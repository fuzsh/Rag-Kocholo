People usually begin experiencing symptoms in their 40’s-60’s although this may vary, even within families. Symptoms can be subtle in early stages, and many patients will first present to memory clinics, psychiatry (for mood changes), or movement clinics. It typically […]",

        "text": "Inheritance\n\nAutosomal dominant: In autosomal dominant conditions, only one copy of the genetic mutation is needed to cause the condition. We all have two copies of every gene, one from our mother and one from our father. Someone with an autosomal dominant condition has one parent with a copy of the genetic mutation and the condition themselves. Therefore, someone with an autosomal dominant condition has a genetic mutation on one copy of the gene from their parent with the condition. Each child of a parent with the genetic mutation will have a 50% chance of having the condition and a 50% chance of not having the condition.\n\nGenetic counselling\n\nGenetic counselling is essential for affected families due to the inheritance pattern of the condition. This is available at hospitals and Regional Genetic Centres. Please contact your doctor if you have any questions.\n\nLearn more about genetic testing and counselling here.\n\nCause\n\nCaused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. This gene provides instructions to make the CSF-1 receptor protein which stimulates signalling pathways needed for cell growth, division and differentiation. Mutations prevent these signalling pathways from being stimulated, but it is not clear how this leads to white matter damage and cognitive difficulties."
