        "text": "Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is a rare inherited or sporadic dementia affecting the white matter of the central nervous system, although it may be less rare than previously expected. ALSP is now thought to encompass previously distinct entities of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD) [1,2]. ‘Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids’ and minor variations of this name have also been used interchangeably with ALSP or HDLS. A diagnosis that requires histopathological confirmation, ALSP has distinctive pathological features of both HDLS and POLD [1]. Accordingly, we refer to ALSP as the disease entity encompassing HDLS, POLD and adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids. ALSP can be distinguished from other adult-onset leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies, which have been discussed elsewhere [3,4].\n\nAn early case report of POLD was published in 1936 [5], and a HDLS familial kindred was described in 1984 [6]. Since then, several authors have qualitatively reviewed pathological and clinical characteristics of ALSP [1], HDLS [2] and POLD [7]. We encountered a case of rapidly progressive frontotemporal dementia (FTD) that had ALSP at autopsy, raising the question of how often the neuropsychiatric manifestation of ALSP meets criteria for behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD). FTD is the third most common cause of cortical dementia after Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. FTD most commonly presents with progressive behavioral changes, which is known as bvFTD; the other variant presents with progressive language dysfunction with preservation of other cognitive domains [8]. Diagnosis of bvFTD has been based on the consensus report by Neary et al. [9] in 1998, but recently in 2011, newer bvFTD criteria were developed with improved diagnostic sensitivity [10]. We thus performed a systematic literature search for all histopathologically confirmed cases of ALSP from 1970 to 2011 to characterize clinical and pathological features of ALSP and determine the prevalence of bvFTD features in ALSP based on 1998 and 2011 criteria. We also describe our new illustrative case study of a patient with underlying ALSP which presented as bvFTD.\n\nResults of the systematic literature search are summarized in figure 1. The literature search identified 51 individual cases that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with absence of exclusion criteria, from 31 publications [2,3,4,6,7,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. Including the new case described in this study, a total of 52 individual ALSP cases were subsequently analyzed. Widening the range of keywords for the search made us aware that although ALSP is rare, there was a substantial number of ALSP cases already published.\n\nOnline supplementary Appendix A (see online at www.karger.com?doi=10.1159/000331422) lists specific information extracted from 31 publications and 1 case of ALSP. Overall, there were 30 women and 21 men (1 unrecorded). Pathological diagnoses were recorded as ALSP in 8 patients, HDLS in 12 patients, POLD in 17 patients, and adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids in 15 patients. Eight diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy antemortem, while the rest were confirmed at autopsy. Mean age of onset was 42.2 ± 12.1 years, ranging from 15 to 78 years (n = 52). Initial symptoms of disease were highly varied and are listed in detail in online supplementary Appendix A. Patients could present with more than one initial symptom, which included personality or behavioral changes (n = 15), motor abnormalities (n = 15), depression or anxiety (n = 9), memory impairment (n = 9), speech abnormalities (n = 9) and seizure (n = 3).\n\nMean duration of progression was 6.2 ± 6.0 years, ranging from 2 months to 34 years (n = 45). Excluding the two extreme cases of 2 months and 34 years of progression, which were both reported by Axelsson et al. [6], mean duration was 5.7 ± 4.2 years (n = 43). Of the 45 patients who were followed until death, 24 had a disease duration of 4 years or less. Mean age of death was 48.6 ± 14.3 years, ranging from 17 to 89 years (n = 45). Of the 44 cases that did not have brain biopsies performed, 14 listed antemortem diagnoses, none of which accurately diagnosed ALSP: Pick’s disease, bvFTD or FTD (n = 4), Alzheimer’s disease (n = 2), corticobasal degeneration (n = 2), presenile dementia (n = 2), psychiatric disorder (n = 2), microvascular leukoencephalopathy (n = 1) and Binswanger leukoencephalopathy (n = 1).\n\nTwenty-five patients had at least one family member with histopathologically confirmed ALSP, belonging to 10 unique kindreds; 24 had family histories of neurodegenerative diseases, which are listed in online supplementary Appendix A.\n\nTable 1 shows the prevalence of bvFTD features in ALSP patients according to the 2011 and 1998 criteria [9,10]. All cases had progressive deterioration, fulfilling the first criteria for bvFTD according to 2011 criteria [10]; 14 cases had 3 or more of 6 clinically discriminating features, fulfilling the criteria for possible bvFTD [3,6,7,10,11,12,18,20,23,27,28,33,36]; 9 cases had 3 features [6,7,18,20,23,27,33,36], 4 cases had 4 features [3,11,12,28] and our case had 5 features. Of these 14 cases, 6 went on to fulfill criteria for probable bvFTD with imaging consistent with bvFTD (frontal and/or temporal atrophy on CT or MRI, or frontal hypoperfusion or hypometabolism on SPECT or PET) and significant functional decline [7,10,12,23,28,33]. These cases also fulfilled the requirement for possible or probable bvFTD diagnoses that other non-degenerative nervous system, medical or psychiatric disorders could not better account for the disease, and the requirement for probable bvFTD diagnosis that biomarkers indicative of another neurodegenerative process were absent [10]. None of the ALSP cases had frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathology or a known pathogenic mutation, thus none had a diagnosis of definite bvFTD [10].\n\nFrom a total of five 1998 core features [9], the mean number of core features exhibited was 2.0 ± 1.6 (n = 52); 3 cases had all 5 core features [11,12,23] and 10 cases had 4 core features [3,4,6,7,27,30,33,36]. The most common core feature was insidious onset and gradual progression. Mean number of supportive features exhibited was 3.7 ± 2.5, ranging from 0 to 11 out of a total of 18 supportive features (n = 52) [9]. Common supportive diagnostic features included altered speech output, primitive reflexes, incontinence, frontal or anterior temporal abnormality on imaging, and mutism. Notably, 50 patients had onset of disease before age 65 years.\n\nA 60-year-old right-handed Caucasian man with 17 years of formal education presented to a specialty memory clinic after 2 years of cognitive decline that had accelerated in the past year. The history of emotional blunting, poor interpersonal conduct, amotivational syndrome, new preference for sweets, and distractibili- ty – against relative preservation of spatial orientation and short-term memory – raised the highest suspicion of bvFTD. At presentation, he required prompting for activities of daily living, yet maintained fluent speech. His family denied dysarthria, dysphagia, new weakness or falls. He had no stroke risk factors, no significant neurological or psychiatric past medical history, and no relevant family history. Mental status testing showed abnormal executive functions of sustained attention, set-shifting and self-monitoring. Elemental neurological examination was normal.\n\nBrain MRI on previous work-up for presumed depression showed symmetrical cerebral atrophy with frontal predominance (fig. 2a). There were hyperintensities in deep white matter of bilateral frontal lobes, left temporal lobe, subcortical regions and splenium of the corpus callosum. On a SPECT scan the same year, perfusion in the right anterior frontal lobe was decreased. Brain MRI repeated 6 months later showed increased volume of the previously identified hyperintensities (fig. 2b). Frontal cerebral atrophy had also worsened and progressed dorsally. Hippocampal atrophy was not apparent.\n\nTwo and a half years into the illness, he lost spontaneous speech. There was no parkinsonism, loss of vertical saccades or gait abnormality. Brain MRI at that time showed further progression of all white matter changes, including involvement of the entire inferior corpus callosum. The patient developed incontinence and falls, then dysphagia in the third year of illness.\n\nWithin the next year, he manifested a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not support viral encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, Lyme’s disease or active inflammatory processes. This seizure heralded a rapid decline into nursing home admission for palliative care. Motor weakness rapidly worsened to the point of immobility and full dependence for nutrition. The patient died before completing a fourth year of illness. The family deferred an electromyogram study, but requested an autopsy.\n\nThe postmortem brain weighed 1,600 g. Cortical atrophy was pronounced at bilateral frontal tips, but not in other regions. Frontal coronal sections revealed bilateral atrophy of deep white matter, corpus callosum and internal capsule (fig. 2c–d). Subcortical U-fibers were intact. White matter atrophy was observed in temporal and subcortical regions and cerebellar peduncles. Occipital white matter was relatively spared. Ventricles appeared enlarged with a preserved but flattened head of the caudate nucleus.\n\nMicroscopic examination confirmed myelinated white matter loss with sparing of subcortical U-fibers. There were gliosis and reactive astrocytosis (fig. 2e), axonal spheroids (fig. 2f) and macrophages with pigmentation (fig. 2g) in white matter regions. Microcalcifications and vacuolations were observed in some sections. Electron microscopy revealed intracytoplasmic ‘fingerprint’ patterns in white matter regions (fig. 2h)."
