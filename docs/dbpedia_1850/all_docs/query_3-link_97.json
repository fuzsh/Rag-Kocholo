        "text": "Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and Triglycerides in Children and Teens\n\nWhat is cholesterol?\n\nCholesterol is a fat-like, waxy substance. It can be found in all parts of your child's body. It helps make cell membranes, some hormones, and vitamin D. The cholesterol in blood comes from 2 sources. The first source is from the foods your child eats. The second source is from their liver. Your child's liver can make all of the cholesterol they need.\n\nCholesterol and other fats are carried through the blood. They are in the form of round blobs called lipoproteins. There are 2 main types of lipoproteins. One type is low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The other type is high-density lipoproteins (HDL).\n\nWhat is LDL cholesterol?\n\nWhat is HDL cholesterol?\n\nWhat are triglycerides?\n\nTriglycerides are another type of fat found in the blood. Most of your teen's body fat is in the form of triglycerides.\n\nHigh levels of triglycerides are linked with a higher risk of heart disease.\n\nHigh triglyceride levels may be caused by any of these:\n\nDiabetes\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nKidney disease\n\nLiver disease\n\nGene that causes high triglyceride levels in families (familial hypertriglyceridemia)\n\nObesity\n\nSome medicines\n\nEating a lot of high-fat or sugary foods\n\nDrinking a lot of alcohol\n\nShould my child have a blood lipid test?\n\nA lipid screening is a test to look at the levels of the fats in the blood. In the past, healthcare providers felt that children and teens were not at risk for high cholesterol levels. But we now know that children and teens are at risk. This is due to things such as:\n\nBeing inactive from too much screen time and not enough exercise\n\nHigh-fat or high-sugar diets\n\nObesity\n\nFamily history of high cholesterol levels\n\nChildren and teens with high cholesterol are at higher risk for heart disease when they become adults. Keeping blood cholesterol levels in the normal range reduces this risk.\n\nLipid testing by age\n\nYour child may need to fast before the blood test. This depends on the type of lipid test done. Fasting means your child should not eat food or drink anything but water before the test.\n\nUnder age 2. Lipid testing is not advised.\n\nAges 2 to 8. Testing is advised if your child has other risk factors for heart disease. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, exposure to cigarette smoke, or a family history of these. Other risk factors include family history of early coronary artery disease or lipid disorder, kidney disease, or other chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nAges 9 to 11. Testing is advised. This can be done with either a fasting or non-fasting lipid profile.\n\nAges 12 to 16. Testing is not advised. This is because of changing lipid levels during puberty. But testing is advised if your child has risk factors as noted above.\n\nAges 17 to 21. Testing is advised. This is because lipid levels are more stable after puberty.\n\nUnderstanding the test results\n\nA full lipid profile can be an important part of your childâ€™s health information. It shows the levels of each type of fat in the blood. These include LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Your child's healthcare provider can tell you what the results should be for your child. In general, healthy levels are:\n\nLDL of less than 130 mg/dL\n\nHDL of greater than 60 mg/dL (less than 35 mg/dL puts your teen at higher risk for heart disease)\n\nSome children and teens (ages 2 to 19) have families with high cholesterol or early heart disease. In these cases, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute advises these levels for cholesterol:\n\nTotal Cholesterol\n\nLDL-Cholesterol\n\nAcceptable\n\nLess than 170 mg/dL\n\nLess than 110 mg/dL\n\nBorderline High\n\n170 to 199 mg/dL\n\n110 to 129 mg/dL\n\nHigh\n\n200 mg/dL or greater\n\n130 mg/dL or greater\n\nTreating high cholesterol in your child or teen\n\nIf the results of your child's lipid tests are abnormal, your child's healthcare provider will work with you to create a treatment plan. Most children and teens will not need medicine. A healthy diet, weight loss, and more physical activity may bring your child's blood lipid levels to normal. The provider will track lipid levels and help your child make lifestyle changes. Your child's provider will talk with you about medicine if needed."
