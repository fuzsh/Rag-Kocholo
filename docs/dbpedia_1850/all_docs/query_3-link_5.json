You can make healthy lifestyle decisions, such as choosing healthier foods with less saturated fat and quitting smoking.\n\nIf you already have high LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, your health care team may recommend medicines that treat high cholesterol and triglyceride levels and lifestyle changes to lower your risk for heart disease and stroke.\n\nIf you already have low HDL cholesterol levels, talk with your doctor about lifestyle changes that may help raise your levels.\n\nGetting your cholesterol checked regularly is an important way to stay in control of your cholesterol health. Work with your health care team on how often you should get screened."
