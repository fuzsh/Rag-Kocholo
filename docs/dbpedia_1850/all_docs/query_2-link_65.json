        "text": "dc.description.abstractThe recapitulation of cancer environment in tumor-on-chip systems will greatly contribute to accelerate cancer studies in the fronts on fundamental research, pharmacological testing of new therapeutic compounds, and personalized medicine. Here we describe the development of two microfluidic platforms aimed to contribute to the advance of tumor-on-chip research. First, we describe a simple and robust method for the fabrication, maturation, and extended culture of large heterotypic cancer (MCF7 and MCF7/fibroblasts) spheroids (~900 µm in diameter) in a 3D-printed mini continuous stirred tank reactor (mini-CSTR). In brief, MCF7 and MCF7/BJ cell suspensions (5×104 cells) were incubated in batch culture to form discoid cell aggregates (600 µm in diameter). These microtissues were then transferred into the mini-CSTR and continuously fed with culture media for an extended time (~30 days). The spheroids progressively increased in size during the first 20 days of perfusion culture to reach a steady diameter. We characterized the spheroid morphology, architecture and the evolution of expression of relevant tumor-related genes (i.e., ER, VEGF, Ki67, Bcl2, LDHA, and HIF-1α) in spheroids cultured for 30 days. This mini-CSTR culture strategy enables the simple and reproducible fabrication of relatively large spheroids and offers great potential for studying the effects of diverse effectors on tumor progression. In addition, we introduce a 3D-printed microfluidic system that can be generically used to culture tumor-tissues under well-controlled environments. The system is composed by three compartments. The left and right compartments have two inlets and two outlets which provide means to continuously feed liquid streams to the system. The central compartment is designed to host a hydrogel where a microtissue can be confined and cultured. A transparent lid can be adapted to enable visual inspection under a microscope. We conducted fluorescent and FITC dextran tracer experiments to characterize the hydraulic performance of the system. In addition, we cultured MCF7 and MCF7/BJ spheroids embedded in a GelMA hydrogel constructs (placed in the central chamber), to illustrate the use of this system to sustain long term micro-tissue culture experiments. We also present experimental results that illustrate the flexibility and robustness of this 3D-printed device for tumor-on-chip experiments including pharmacological testing of anticancer compounds. These “open-source” organ-on-chip systems are intended to be a general-purpose resource to facilitate and democratize the development of tumor-on-chip applications. We also explored the use of these cell aggregates and some of the characterization techniques to develop educational activities in the context of tissue engineering. Students fabricated a DIY (do it yourself) incubator and cultured spheroids for 7 days on average. They evaluated glucose consumption, size progression and change in color of the culture media. In this proposed activity students were exposed to concepts and basic experimental duties commonly use in a tissue engineering lab.es_MX"
