        "meta_description": "Cancer has been a leading cause of death around the world for many years. Even with the emerging technologies seen in these times, there is still a lack of truly personalized treatments since cancer tumors are not fully understood, especially between different cancer patients. 3D models known as patient derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) have been gaining traction as in vitro models to mimic a patient’s tumor outside of their body. Grown from the patients' cells into cell clusters (spheroids) or organoids (mini parts of the tumor tissue), these models can serve as precise avenues for personalized drug discovery or studying tumor complexity. However, there are still limitations to these 3D models due to conventional fabrication methods. In order to achieve personalized care, the models being tested on should be consistent through each batch, reliable, and affordable. Traditionally, organoid development from cells aggregating in hanging droplets or rotating in flasks for maintained cell-aggregate suspension, can cause batch-to-batch inconsistencies (lack of uniformity between samples), low throughput, and often require high volume of reagents. \nTo recreate a 3D suspension for cells in a more native environment, hydrogels have become popular biocompatible scaffolds capable of sustaining cell growth. Hydrogels themselves have been widely studied for ideal cell environments, yet common methods of cell encapsulation into these hydrogels (e.g. manually pipetting) do not address the mentioned limitations, but rather introduce inconsistencies. \nDroplet microfluidics (DM), with the inclusion of hydrogels, has become a technology that has assisted in organoid fabrication, addressing conventional limitations. DM can create uniform aqueous droplets at high frequencies through controlled emulsion, using microchannels. These uniform droplets allow for controlled cell encapsulation with minimal reagent usage, thus addressing the drawbacks of traditional organoid formation and cell encapsulation techniques.
