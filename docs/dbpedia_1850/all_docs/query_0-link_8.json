        "text": "What is ALSP or Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia?\n\nALSP is a rare adult onset autosomal dominant disorder characterized by changes to certain parts of the brain. As the disorder name indicates, the individual will experience leukoencephalopathy, which is damage to the white matter of the brain, and damage to the axons which is caused by swellings called spheroids. This damage to the myelin and axons contributes to many of the neurological signs and symptoms seen in people with this condition. This condition is also known as Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS), and CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms?\n\nPersonality changes\n\nLoss of social inhibitions and depression are some of the earliest symptoms of HDLS\n\nMemory loss\n\nLoss of impulse control, self-monitoring and focus\n\nMild seizures\n\nDementia\n\nDifficulty walking\n\nMovement abnormalities known as Parkinsonism:\n\nUnusually slow movement\n\nTrembling\n\nMuscle stiffness\n\nHow Do You Get ALSP?\n\nThis disorder is caused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called colony stimulating factor 1 receptor. This protein contributes to the growth of microglial cells. Further research is needed to determine how these gene mutations cause the symptoms.\n\nHow Is ALSP Diagnosed?\n\nIt is diagnosed through evaluation of the symptoms the individual is experiencing, genetic testing, and MRI. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the CSF1R gene.\n\nIs There a Treatment?\n\nBone marrow transplant is a potential treatment for ALSP for eligible patients. There may also be clinical trials for potential new therapies listed on clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nALSP Info\n\nSistersâ€™ Hope Foundation\n\nNORD\n\nGenetics Home Reference\n\nGene Reviews"
