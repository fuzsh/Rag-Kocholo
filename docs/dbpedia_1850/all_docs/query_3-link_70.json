        "text": "Cholesterol is a waxy substance your liver makes to protect nerves and to make cell tissue and certain hormones. Your body also gets cholesterol from the food you eat. This includes eggs, meats, and dairy. There is “good” (HDL) cholesterol and “bad” (LDL) cholesterol. Too much bad cholesterol (LDL) can be bad for your health.\n\nWhat is the difference between “good” cholesterol and “bad” cholesterol?\n\nGood cholesterol is known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). It removes cholesterol from the bloodstream. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the “bad” cholesterol.\n\nIf your total cholesterol level is high because of a high LDL level, you may be at higher risk of heart disease or stroke. But, if your total cholesterol level is high only because of a high HDL level, you’re probably not at higher risk.\n\nTriglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. When you eat more calories than your body can use, it turns the extra calories into triglycerides.\n\nChanging your lifestyle (diet and exercise) can improve your cholesterol levels, lower LDL and triglycerides, and raise HDL.\n\nYour ideal cholesterol level will depend on your risk for heart disease.\n\nTotal cholesterol level – less than 200 is best, but it depends on your HDL and LDL levels.\n\nLDL cholesterol levels – less than 130 is best, but this depends on your risk for heart disease.\n\nHDL cholesterol levels – 60 or higher reduces your risk for heart disease.\n\nTriglycerides – less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) is best.\n\nOften, there are no specific symptoms of high cholesterol. You could have high cholesterol and not know it.\n\nIf you have high cholesterol, your body may store the extra cholesterol in your arteries. These are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body. A buildup of cholesterol in your arteries is known as plaque. Over time, plaque can become hard and make your arteries narrow. Large deposits of plaque can completely block an artery. Cholesterol plaques can also break apart, leading to formation of a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood.\n\nA blocked artery to the heart can cause a heart attack. A blocked artery to your brain can cause a stroke.\n\nMany people don’t discover that they have high cholesterol until they suffer one of these life-threatening events. Some people find out through routine check-ups that include blood tests.\n\nYour liver produces cholesterol, but you also get cholesterol from food. Eating too many foods that are high in fat can increase your cholesterol level.\n\nBeing overweight and inactive also causes high cholesterol. If you are overweight, you most likely have a higher level of triglycerides. If you never exercise and aren’t active in general, it can lower your HDL (good cholesterol).\n\nYour family history also affects your cholesterol level. Research has shown that high cholesterol tends to run in families. If you have an immediate family member who has it, you could have it, too.\n\nSmoking also causes high cholesterol. It lowers your HDL (good cholesterol).\n\nYou can’t tell if you have high cholesterol without having it checked. A simple blood test will reveal your cholesterol level.\n\nMen 35 years of age and older and women 45 years of age and older should have their cholesterol checked. Men and women 20 years of age and older who have risk factors for heart disease should have their cholesterol checked. Teens may need to be checked if they are taking certain medicines or have a strong family history of high cholesterol. Ask your doctor how often you should have your cholesterol checked.\n\nRisk factors for heart disease include:\n\nCigarette smoking\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nOlder age\n\nHaving an immediate family member (parent or sibling) who has had heart disease\n\nBeing overweight or having obesity\n\nInactivity\n\nMaking healthy food choices and exercising are two ways to reduce your risk of developing high cholesterol.\n\nEat fewer foods with saturated fats (such as red meat and most dairy products). Choose healthier fats. This includes lean meats, avocados, nuts, and low-fat dairy items. Avoid foods that contain trans fat (such as fried and packaged foods). Look for foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These foods include salmon, herring, walnuts, and almonds. Some egg brands contain omega-3.\n\nExercise can be simple. Go for a walk. Take a yoga class. Ride your bike to work. You could even participate in a team sport. Aim to get 30 minutes of activity every day."
