        "text": "What is familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)?\n\nFH is an inherited condition that is passed down through families and is caused by one or more faulty genes.\n\nIt's caused by a genetic mutation (a change in one or more genes) making your liver less able to remove excess ‘bad’ cholesterol, known as LDL. This means the LDL level in your blood can get too high. Having FH means you’re at risk of getting heart and circulatory disease at an early age if it’s not treated.\n\nFH is one of the most common inherited conditions that affects about 1 in every 250. It’s estimated that around 270,000 people in the UK have it, but many don’t know they do.\n\nIf one of your parents has the condition, there’s a 50 per cent (1 in 2) chance that you could have it. If you have FH, there’s a 1 in 2 chance that you could pass it on to any of your children.\n\nWhy is having high cholesterol bad for you?\n\nHaving high cholesterol causes a gradual build-up of fatty material in your coronary arteries (known as atheroma). Other risk factors – like high blood pressure or smoking – can also cause atheroma build-up.\n\nA build-up of atheroma means your arteries gradually become narrower, making it harder for blood to flow to your vital organs. This puts you at higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)?\n\nFH is not easy to diagnose. Your doctor may suspect FH if:\n\na routine blood test shows you have a high cholesterol level\n\nyou have a heart attack or stroke, especially if it happens at a young age\n\nother members of your family have a history of premature heart disease or stroke\n\nother members of your family have been diagnosed with FH.\n\nYou may also notice physical changes to your body that suggest you have FH. Your doctor will perform a simple physical exam to check for these symptoms. These can include:\n\nGenetic testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)\n\nThe first step to finding out whether you have FH is to visit your GP to have your cholesterol checked. Your doctor will also ask whether you have a history of high cholesterol or heart conditions in your family.\n\nIf your results come back high, or if your doctor notices some of the physical signs of FH listed above, they will refer you to a specialist for an assessment, which is likely to include genetic testing. The specialist will explain which of your relatives should be checked out, too.\n\nGenetic testing is a DNA test that’s done to see if you have a faulty gene which can cause an inherited condition. This test may be:\n\na blood sample\n\na mouth swab, from the inside of your cheek.\n\nIf you’re diagnosed with FH, your first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) should also be tested as soon as possible. FH is an inherited condition which means that if a parent has FH, their child has a 50% chance of inheriting it.\n\nIf one of your family members has FH, you should get tested as well. Early diagnosis of FH means you can get treatment and improve your lifestyle to lower your cholesterol and avoid risk to your health.\n\nHow is familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) treated?\n\nThere isn’t a cure for FH but it can be well managed. Treatment can greatly reduce your risk of getting coronary heart disease, having a heart attack or stroke, or needing other treatments. If you or your child is diagnosed with FH, your doctor will discuss and agree a treatment plan with you.\n\nFH is usually treated using medicines called statins, which help to lower your cholesterol levels.\n\nThere are other types of medicines which can be used to lower blood cholesterol levels either instead of or as well as statins. These are:\n\nezetimibe\n\nPCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab and evolocumab\n\nbempedoic acid\n\ninclisiran\n\nfibrates such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate.\n\nAs well as taking medications, you'll need to make changes to your diet and lifestyle which also help to improve your cholesterol level.\n\nPeople with high cholesterol often find they can bring their levels of cholesterol down just by changing their diet. Unfortunately, FH can’t be treated through diet alone, but you should still make sure you:\n\nmaintain a healthy weight\n\ndo plenty of exercise\n\ndon’t smoke\n\ndrink less alcohol.\n\nPregnancy and familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)\n\nFH shouldn’t affect your chances of getting pregnant. However, you should talk to your doctor about your plans before you try to get pregnant. This means that they can advise you on your medication and talk to you about risks during pregnancy.\n\nThey may also want to discuss the risk of your child inheriting FH and when they can test for it.\n\nEating a healthy balanced diet and keeping active will help you to stay as healthy as possible during your pregnancy.\n\nFor more information on FH, you can:"
