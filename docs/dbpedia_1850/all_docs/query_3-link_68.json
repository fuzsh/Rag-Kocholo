        "text": "About your cholesterol result\n\nA cholesterol test can measure:\n\ntotal cholesterol – the overall amount of cholesterol in your blood\n\ngood cholesterol (called HDL) – this may make you less likely to have heart problems or a stroke\n\nnon-HDL cholesterol – the difference between total cholesterol and HDL\n\nWhen you get your result, you may just be told your total cholesterol.\n\nYou might be able to get separate results for your HDL and non-HDL cholesterol too. Ask your doctor or nurse.\n\nHow your GP uses your results\n\nYour GP will use your cholesterol levels along with other factors, such as your age, blood pressure and health conditions, to estimate your risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey may give you a score (called a QRISK score) which estimates how likely you are to have a heart or circulation problem over the next 10 years.\n\nWhat your cholesterol levels should be\n\nWhat is a good target level for you depends on things like your age, whether you have any health conditions and your risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThese levels are a guide for healthy adults. If you have been ill, are taking some medicines, or have recently had a baby, your levels may be lower or higher. It does not make much difference to these levels whether you have eaten before your test or not."
