Cells need it to keep their membranes just the right consistency.\n\nOur body also makes things with cholesterol, like steroid hormones, vitamin D, and bile.\n\nHereâs how cholesterol can be bad.\n\nCholesterol in the blood can stick to artery walls, forming plaque. This can block blood flow. Atherosclerosis is the condition where plaque narrows the space inside the artery.\n\nMultiple factors can cause plaques to rupture, like inflammation. The bodyâs natural healing response to damaged tissue can cause clots. If the clots plug up arteries, blood cannot deliver vital oxygen.\n\nIf the coronary arteries that feed the heart are blocked, this could lead to a heart attack.\n\nIf the blood vessels of the brain or the carotid arteries of the neck are blocked, this could lead to a stroke.Â\n\nIf the arteries of the leg are blocked, this could lead to peripheral artery disease. This causes painful leg cramps when walking, numbness and weakness, or foot sores that do not heal.\n\nSo cholesterol can be good and bad. There are also different types of cholesterol sometimes Â called âgood cholesterolâ and âbad cholesterolâ.\n\nLDL, or low-density lipoprotein, is sometimes called âbad cholesterolâ. It carries cholesterol that can stick to arteries, collect in the vessel lining forming plaque, and sometimes block blood flow.\n\nHDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is sometimes called âgood cholesterolâ. It takes cholesterol away from the blood and returns it to the liver.Â\n\nWhen checked, you want your LDL to be low. L for low.\n\nYou want your HDL to be high. H for High.\n\nA blood test can measure the LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol. Usually, there are no visible symptoms of high cholesterol, so it is important to be periodically checked.\n\nWays to decrease your LDL and increase your HDL include:\n\nEating a heart-healthy diet low in saturated and trans fats.Â\n\nRegular exercise and being more physically active.\n\nMaintaining healthy weight.Â\n\nQuitting smoking.\n\nMedications. Medications might be recommended depending on known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (such as age and family history among others).\n\nYou may already be familiar with these guidelines for heart-healthy living. They are based on research supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH.Â\n\nThis video was produced by MedlinePlus, a trusted source of health information from the US National Library of Medicine.Â"
