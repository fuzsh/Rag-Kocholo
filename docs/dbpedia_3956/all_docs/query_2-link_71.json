        "text": "THE OCEAN HIGHWAY\n\nCompiled by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Works Progress Administration\n\nTo follow the course of the Ocean Highway along the shore of the Atlantic from New Jersey to Florida is like taking a living course in American history, so much of the past is still visible in the out-of-the-way hamlets, towns, bays, and islands through which the ancient route passes. This shore road, sometimes impassable even now in the spring because of high water, is the one by which the first white settlers ploughed their difficult way by muddy foot, horse, or boat in colonial days. It connects some of the oldest settlements in North America. When the economic spine of the south swung inland, these old towns were left to decay or to maintain with dignity the integrity and traditions of an earlier time.\n\nLanguage and customs in some sections, like the Eastern Shore of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, are still in many ways what they were in 1700 . . . How many of these words do you recognize: “stook”; “pipjinny”; “mung-ya”; “sporry”? (See page 38.)\n\nOver the Ocean Highway you will journey through romantic legend-haunted regions like the Dismal Swamp (Va. and N. C.); past such historic spots as Tangier Island, still guarding its ancient independence as it did in the War of 1812. You will pass the Georgia scene of Julia Peterkin's novels Black Skin and Scarlet Sister Mary; and the house which was the setting for George Alfred Townsend's story of antebellum days in Maryland, The Entailed Hat.\n\nFrom the road across Butler's Island you can see the house where Fanny Kemble, the English actress, kept her unhappy diary as the wife of Pierce Butler.\n\nOn Maryland's Eastern Shore you will pass fine old mansions standing on grants that bear names like Want Weather, Penny Come Quick, Hard Bargain, Aha the Cow Pasture, and Bachelor's Delight.\n\nAmong the most interesting sections of the book are the extensive group of side-trips and the description of the North Carolina Coast written in 1584 by Captain Arthur Barlow, by whom it was “taken in possession . . . to her Majesties use.”\n\nIt is easier in these coastal regions to get the traditional dishes of the country than in the more up-to-date sections to the west. A mouth-watering feature of this book is the list of “Characteristic Coastal Dishes” included as the result of what must have been the pleasantest task of research that went into the making of “The Ocean Highway.”\n\nPhoto of two men fishing AMERICAN GUIDE SERIESTHEOcean Highway NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEYTO JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDACompiled and written by the Federal Writers’ Projectof the Works Progress Administration WITH 32 PHOTOGRAPHS\n\nvignette SPONSORED BY CHARLES L.

Under this project, organized to give useful work to unemployed writers, an ambitious and pioneering task has been undertaken — a written description of the most important sections of the United States. The Federal Writers’ publications are of many types. This volume is part of the American Guide Series of regional, State and local guidebooks, and third in a series of interstate route guides. The entire series of guides, when completed, will highlight the history, resources and points of interest in an area of more than three million square miles.\n\nAlthough collated, rechecked and edited in the central office in Washington, the materials for the book were collected in the States and the book was written by the State workers on the Federal Writers’ Project. To insure its accuracy authorities have checked statements of fact, and to give it all possible scope many public-spirited persons have given their services freely. They share with us the hope that those who use this volume will through it gain a better knowledge and greater understanding of America and American life.\n\nThe Federal Writers’ Project, directed by Henry G. Alsberg, is in the Division of Women and Professional Projects under Ellen S. Woodward, WPA Assistant Administrator.\n\nAdministrator\n\nCONTENTS\n\nForewordiiiNotes on Use of BookixIntroductionxiCharacteristic Coastal Dishesxxiii\n\nMAIN ROUTE\n\nNEW JERSEYSection 1.

Descriptions of the more important side and cross routes and large cities have been omitted owing to lack of space; readers are referred to the State guide books of the American Guide Series for this material. The description of the main route, written north to south, is of course valid in the reverse direction. For the convenience of those entering the route at midway points the description of the Ocean Highway has been broken into short sections, cumulative mileage being started afresh at the beginning of each. Mileages on the side routes are also cumulative, being counted from the junctions with the main route. Those using this guide book on the road are reminded that cumulative mileages depend on the manner in which a car is driven; if curves are rounded on the inside, if many other cars are passed, if the road is left even briefly for stops at filling stations, if an alternate to the indicated route is used in going through a city or town, total mileages will differ from those given here.Travelers are advised to read in advance the descriptions of sections they expect to travel and to mark the points of interest they particularly wish to view.Great effort has been expended to make this book as accurate as possible, but it is realized that no volume covering such a wide range of material, some of it inadequately documented, can be free of mistakes; if those who find errors will report them to the Federal Writers’ Project in Washington, corrections will gladly be made in future editions.Note: In the late Spring some sections of this road south of Norfolk may be temporarily closed because of high water. Travelers should make inquiry along the route.Katharine A. KellockTour Editor, American Guide Series\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTHE 1000-MILE OCEAN HIGHWAY, branching south from US 1 in the industrial area of New Jersey and providing the shortest route between the New York City region and Florida, crosses swamps and tidal estuaries and inlets; it traverses flat country never far above sea-level. Thanks to the Gulf Stream most of it is ice-free when roads further inland are coated with a dangerous glaze.\n\nExcept for the 88-mile section in New Jersey the route runs through the Old South; the Eastern Shore, the narrow peninsula it traverses between the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay, was never a cotton-growing area and was occupied by Union troops early in the Civil War, but it was southern in customs, traditions, and sympathies.\n\nThe Ocean Highway country, in spite of modern agricultural and industrial developments, lives much in the past. It cherishes the speech and habits of its ancestors, and speaks of long-ago happenings as though they had occurred last year. Everybody knows the kin of his great-aunt's second husband's grandmother, servants work all their lives in one family, sharing their folks’ prosperity and hard times, and The War is still the Civil War.\n\nIn many places the modern road follows the Colonial route connecting the first settlements made on this part of the Atlantic Coast; in North Carolina a side route runs to Roanoke Island, where in 1585 Ralegh planted the first English colony on American soil; on the Eastern Shore the route runs close to a settlement made by Jamestown colonists, sent into supposed exile to make salt but remaining to enjoy the abundance of the land. The Ocean Highway goes through New Castle, the capital of the Province of Delaware, through New Bern, for a time the capital of the Province of North Carolina, through Charleston, the capital of the Province of South Carolina, and through Savannah, capital of the Colony of Georgia.\n\nThe early inhabitants of these regions brought old cultural traditions with them and the fecundity of the country soon enabled the new Americans to build churches and homes of architectural elegance and grace that would have merited respectful attention in western Europe. Travelers who linger here have many opportunities to wonder at the imagination and craftsmanship displayed in the early structures on these shores.\n\nIn some sections the countryside is monotonous in its fiatness, but along side routes south of the Delaware there is an astonishing lushness of vegetation, increasing toward the South, that provides delightful variety.\n\nFanny Kemble, the English actress who spent a winter on the islands off the Georgia Coast, after her marriage to Pierce Butler, wrote in her journal:\n\n“. . . Every shade of green, every variety of form, every degree of varnish, and all in full leaf and beauty in the very depth of winter. The stunted dark-colored oak; the magnolia bay . . ., which grows to a very great size; the wild myrtle a beautiful and profuse shrub, rising to a height of six, eight, and ten feet, and branching on all sides in luxuriant tufted fullness; most beautiful of all, that pride of the South, the magnolia grandiflora, whose lustrous dark green perfect foliage would alone render it an object of admiration, without the queenly blossom whose color, size, and perfume are unrivaled in the whole vegetable kingdom. . . . Under all these the spiked palmetto forms an impenetrable covert, and from glittering graceful branch to branch hang garlands of evergreen creepers, on which the mocking-birds are swinging and singing even now; while I, bethinking me of the pinching cold that is at this hour tyrannizing over your region, look round on this strange scene — on these green woods, this unfettered river, and sunny sky — and feel very much like one in another planet from yourself.”\n\nAnd again: “Here I saw growing in the open air the most beautiful gardinias I have ever beheld. . . . We saw quantities of wild plumtrees all silvery with blossoms . . . and a beautiful shrub covered with delicate pink bloom like flowering peach trees. . . .\n\n“But then the sky . . . the unspeakable glories of these southern heavens, the saffron brightness of morning, the blue intense brilliancy of noon, the golden splendor and the rosy softness of sunset. Italy and Claude Lorraine may go hang themselves together!”\n\nIt is not surprising that such a country should hold formal gardens that connoisseurs rank among the most beautiful in the world. The earliest European inhabitants were fascinated by the botanical wonders of a country that later attracted such distinguished naturalists as Bartram, and they lavished as much time and money on their gardens as they did on their houses, vying with one another in a race to acquire and acclimate large numbers of exotic plants. Brookgreen,\n\nMagnolia Gardens, Runnymede, and Middleton are merely notable survivors of the many former landscaped estates.\n\nA list of those who had plantations and estates in the area along the highway south of Norfolk would include almost every name of importance in the early history of the Carolinas and of Georgia.\n\nEven though the old King's Highway, which the route closely follows, was notoriously difficult south of Chesapeake Bay, it was the shortest route between the Colonial centers of government, culture, and trade, and at one time or another its mud was spattered over practically every southern colonizer, soldier, and statesman, and over every peddler, missionary, and distinguished foreigner visiting the South. The diaries and letters of these early travelers make lively reading, though arousing wonder and envy at the energy of the people of the past.\n\nThe journal of George Fox, the founder of the Religious Society of Friends who visited America in 1672, gives almost as much space to comments on the hardships of travel as it does to rejoicings over the success of the meetings he held.\n\n“Having visited the north part of Carolina and made a little entrance for Truth upon the people there, we began to return towards Virginia. . . . We lay one night at the house of the secretary, to get to which gave us much trouble; for the water being shallow, we could not bring our boat to shore; but the secretary's wife, seeing our straight, came herself in a canoe (her husband being from home) and brought us to land.\n\n“Next morning our boat was sunk; but we got her up, mended her, and went away in her that day about twenty-four miles, the water being rough, and the winds high; but the great power of God was seen in carrying us safe in that rotten boat. . . .\n\n“Next day we had a tedious journey through bogs and swamps, and were exceedingly wet and dirty but dried ourselves at night by a fire. . . .” At this point he describes a woman's amazement when her large dogs make no attempt to bite him. “. . . for both in Virginia and Carolina (living alone in the woods) they generally kept great dogs to guard their houses. . . .”\n\nFrancis Asbury, who established Methodism in America and who covered an almost incredible number of miles in his ceaseless journeys, made many complaints on the difficulty of the road. On Aug. 9, 1780, when he was in North Carolina, he wrote:\n\n“I have had little time or place for prayer till I came here. The roads are so bad that I have my carriage to refit almost every week.\n\n“Aug. 10. I rode for the State of Virginia; we were lost, stopped at Dickinson's and took dinner; there rode on to Sylvester Adam's, several creeks to cross and bad roads to travel. Edward Bailey led my horse down a steep hill, and the carriage overset; the horse struggled but kept his feet; one shaft broke which we strapped up and rode on near thirty miles.”\n\nIn 1787 while near the present town of South Mills in North Carolina, he recorded: “I am now surrounded by hideous swamps near the head of the Pasquotank River.”\n\nIn March of 1796 he noted:\n\n“Rode twenty-five miles to Chester's. Here I learned Edisto was impassable. If we had not hastened along as we did, we should not have passed it in proper time and I should have been prevented from visiting Georgia this year also. There are so many water-courses and so few ferries that going through this country in any certain time is like a lottery.”\n\nBut the streams that were impediments on the King's Highway were themselves travel routes. Nearly all the most desirable plantations bordered some navigable river and many plantation families traveled to the cities in their own barges and ships, making the journeys frequently because the Colonial ports were gay places, with balls, concerts, theatrical performances, and parties. They were surprisingly cosmopolitan, European newspapers, pamphlets and gossip reaching them quickly. A Charleston visitor from abroad was sometimes startled by hearing discussion of a Sir Roger de Coverley paper he had not yet read, the latest copy of the Spectator having arrived on a swifter boat than the one on which he had sailed. When popular merchants were expecting cargoes from abroad, men and women alike flocked in from the country to buy the latest Paris and London fripperies, and to parade them as soon as bought. If frocks had nine rows of ruffles in London at Christmas time, the women of the coastal plantations were wearing nine rows in February.\n\nMany changes have taken place in the Ocean Highway country since those gay days of the past. Old plantations on the Eastern Shore, some owned by corporations, are operated as fruit and truck farms. Further south some of the old estates, occasionally in the hands of the families that formerly owned them, still produce cotton, but many\n\nmore are weed-grown or covered with scrub pine, gaunt chimneys rising above piles of brick to indicate the sites of the former mansions. Nonetheless, the country does not give an impression of decadence and ruin, because the Old South is entering a new cycle in its long history.\n\nAn outline of that history is a necessary adjunct to a description of the towns and points of interest along the route; but much of the story of the Ocean Highway country is necessarily the story of the whole South. The cultural and economic patterns set on the Atlantic coast dominated the country later settled behind it.\n\nThe English and Scottish immigrants who first made homes along the Atlantic seaboard, from Maine to Florida, were nearly alike in their aspirations and ideals; all had left the lands in which they were born, and had faced the dreadful discomforts of three-month sea voyages and the dangers of pioneering among savages, in the hope of bettering their conditions of life; all wanted security — social, economic, religious. The differences of opinion later developing between those who settled along the northern shores and those who settled further south were largely the result of climate and topography.\n\nThe Virginia colonists, first to arrive, went through a disillusioning period before they realized that the only gold America had for them must come from the cultivation of the land; fortunately the country in which they had settled was ideal for the culture of tobacco, a world demand for which had been created in an astonishingly short time, after the Spanish introduced the use of the plant into the Old World. Settlers to the south of Virginia also turned to the cultivation of crops for European markets — rice, indigo, and cotton.\n\nThe Massachusetts settlers, after almost starving to death on the barren coast, found that they could make livings by sending to England the Maine furs acquired from the Indians and the fish taken from the coastal waters. They practiced agriculture but their farms were chiefly of the subsistence variety. Fishing led them to boat and ship building, eventually turning them to the carrying trade.\n\nAll the early settlers had serious trouble in finding laborers. In a land with millions of unclaimed acres it was exceedingly difficult to persuade men to till the soil for others; poor immigrants were, however, willing to bind or hire themselves out to shippers and tradesmen to acquire skills that would later make them independent. Such as were willing to do agricultural chores shunned the South because of\n\nthe heat that was so deadly to those reared in the cool British Isles.\n\nThe first slave trader in the lands of English settlement, a Dutchman, appeared in 1619. The hard-pressed planters of Jamestown bought his goods with reluctance. Before long other slavers arrived in ports all along the Atlantic coast and disposed of their cargoes without much difficulty. The northerners, however, soon found their investments in human chattels unsatisfactory. Because of the rigorous climate in the North, Africans there proved to be highly perishable property; they lacked, moreover, the slight skills demanded by tradesmen and craftsmen. The southern farmers had less difficulty in acclimating the Negro and could use workers lacking skills and trained intelligence. So the slave traders eventually found poor markets in the North, good ones in the South.\n\nNonetheless, the southern settlers did not accept slavery gladly. They had both moral and practical objections to the importation of the Africans. They early recognized the disadvantages of slave labor, its productive inefficiency, and the responsibilities it entailed. Within a few decades they were acutely aware of the problems inherent in settlement by mixed races.\n\nLong before the Revolution some of the colonies, southern as well as northern, attempted to stop further importations of slaves, but all legislative bans were immediately annulled by the British Crown, which was heavily involved in the lucrative slave trade; good Queen Anne, scattering communion cups and religious vestments among the Anglican congregations of America, was the leading stockholder in the English company holding a monopoly on the African trade.\n\nThe northerners, finding slaves unprofitable for themselves, early turned to supplying them to others. The Massachusetts ship Desire brought in Negroes in 1637. By 1680 the trade was in full swing; molasses bought in the West Indies was turned into rum by New Englanders who shipped it to Africa; there they traded it for Africans, who were carried to the West Indies for “seasoning” before shipment to the southern colonies. The ships that had carried the slaves from Africa were loaded with more molasses for processing in New England.\n\nIt was the planter Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, who, when drafting the Declaration of Independence, wrote:\n\n“. . . he (George III) has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons\n\nof a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian king of Great Britain: determined to open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce. . . .”\n\nThat this paragraph did not appear in the final draft of the Declaration was owing to the censorship exerted by northern as well as southern delegates. John Adams, sitting on the drafting committee, was mindful of the interests of New England shippers and well aware that many of the finest homes on the New England coast had been built with the profits of the trade in human beings.\n\nJefferson was far from being alone in his dislike of slavery. Washington, writing to Lafayette, said:\n\n“. . . your late purchase of an estate in the colony of Cayenne, with a view of emancipating the slaves on it, is a generous and noble proof of your humanity. Would to God a like spirit would difuse itself generally into the minds of the people of this country. But I despair of seeing it. Some petitions were presented to the Assembly at its last session, for the abolition of slavery, but they could scarcely obtain a reading. To set them afloat at once would, I really believe, be productive of much mischief, but by degrees it certainly might and assuredly ought to be effected; and that too by legislative authority. . . .”\n\nWashington was praising a humanitarian plan but he was fully convinced of the practical disadvantages of slavery and more than once spoke of his own dilemma; his slaves were breeding too fast for his needs and he could not face separating families by sale.\n\nAs the slaves began to multiply in numbers there was less need to import them from abroad and the market price dropped — to the dismay of the traders; while in drafting the Constitution the Founding Fathers had incorporated a clause prohibiting any ban for 20 years on slave importations, the act was accomplished in 1807 without great opposition from the North or the South.\n\nHad the question come up but a short time later it is possible that importation would not have been banned so easily. The North, pushing industrial development, was installing power looms in the new\n\ntextile mills and the cotton gin was coming into use, making cotton goods cheaper and greatly increasing the demand. Within a few years after the importation of slaves was prohibited the South was experiencing an enormous boom. Planters borrowed frantically to buy plantations and slaves and used their profits to obtain yet more plantations and more slaves. They ignored all possibilities of industrial development and crop diversification, becoming entirely dependent on the price of cotton. When the price of this commodity dropped alarmingly, as it did at intervals, the planters had to resort to northern money-lenders to pay the annual bills and to enable them to plant the next crop.\n\nThis dependency on northern cash, which helped to increase the antagonism between the two sections of the country, was in large part the result of the credit-economy that had prevailed in the plantation area from earliest times. The southerner had money in his pockets at only one period of the year — after his crop was sold; Parson Weems, the indefatigable book-seller, wrote to his publisher in 1804:\n\n“. . . And as also in the long run of things, my life may be worth a Jew's eye to you, I wd, by all means, advise that I be directed, like a Bird of passage, to spend the Winter in the South, and the Summer & Autumn in the North. In the seasons last mention'd the Gentry of this Country are scatter'd abroad like sheep without a shepherd, wandering in quest of Health and healthy situations. And besides were you to light upon them at that time you wd find them as lean as so many rabbits in the Dog days, without a dollar to lay down even for the ‘The life of Washington.’ But in Winter they are all in their towns thick as Bees, and merry as Crickets, with every man his pocket full of dollars from the sale of his cotton bags & rice barrels. . . .”\n\nBecause the planter had cash only once a year he had to pay high prices for everything, storekeepers and other retailers having to make him bear the cost of deferred payments for goods. It was easy to blame the high prices on the North, the money-lender, particularly because the new industrialists of that section were constantly pressing for higher tariffs to protect their markets. A purely agricultural area producing crops chiefly for a foreign market, the South demanded free trade, protesting against having to pay nearly double price for manufactures, in part for the benefit of northern producers. Her\n\nprotests were especially bitter because of the poor quality of many American products, particularly textiles.\n\nMeanwhile, the soil of the area through which the Ocean Highway runs was becoming exhausted; Fanny Kemble in 1834 commented on the shabbiness and dilapidation of many of the formerly prosperous homes. Describing a visit to the daughter of an exgovernor, she wrote: “. . . as for the residence of this princess it was like all the planters’ residences that I have seen and, such as a well-to-do English farmer would certainly not inhabit. Occasional marks of former elegance or splendor survive, sometimes in the size of the rooms, sometimes in a little carved woodwork about the mantle-pieces or wainscotings of these mansions; but all things have a Castle Rackrent air of neglect, . . . with which the dirty barefooted negro servants are in excellent keeping.”\n\nThe antagonism between the North and the South — between sections primarily industrial and primarily agricultural — increased steadily in strength and bitterness because of their opposing economic interests. Some northern politicians were not averse to fanning the growing anti-slavery sentiment of the humanitarians and the northern farmers’ fear of competition from slave labor in order to aid their own political battles for dominance in Congress, but the northern industrialists actively opposed these tactics, foreseeing the dangers in a social upheaval and appreciating the advantages to themselves of having cotton produced with slave labor. As the North approached the point where her population and wealth doubled that of the South, southern leaders realized that their long dominance in Congress would soon be lost; the people, particularly in the far South, saw this as a dreadful threat to their somewhat precarious prosperity. Talk of secession from the Union increased — an act that some northerners had advocated for their own States at times when national affairs were going in directions that did not suit their interests.\n\nWhen in 1860 the new party, openly committed to high protective tariffs, won the national election, the southern fear became intense. South Carolina immediately called a popular convention and voted to leave the Union, calling on other States to follow her. Northern leaders, eager to heal the break, hastily put through Congress an amendment to the Constitution denying the Federal Government the power to abolish or interfere with slavery, and three States had already ratified the amendment when a series of unfortunate incidents,\n\nminor in themselves, brought on the armed conflict. When the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on January 1, 1863, it came largely as a military measure to prevent Great Britain, which had abolished slavery, from recognizing and aiding the Confederacy — the producer of the raw material for her cotton mills.\n\nThe results of the war were staggering for the South; 250,000 men, many of the most active and intelligent in the area, had been killed, and even a greater number had been permanently crippled or invalided. The people had given all possible public and private wealth to the support of their armies; the emancipation of the slaves without compensation to the owners — early offers of compensation in return for peace had been refused — resulted in the wiping out of four billion dollars’ worth of southern property; plantations, homes and public buildings had been destroyed. The humiliation of a people who had long dominated the national scene, the loss of their economic security, the fear engendered by the wreckage of their whole economic system, and the despair over the terrific task ahead, had shattering results. While the war generation made some progress in re-establishing order, it was half a century before the States that had entered the Confederacy began to recover their vitality.\n\nThese fallow years were not lost; by the beginning of the 20th century, the exhausted fields had begun to recover some of their fertility, pine forests were springing up, planters were beginning to study methods of soil conservation and crop diversification, and the new generation was seriously studying the economic and social problems before it. Industrial development had begun, changing the former southern attitude on tariff protection for domestic industry and bringing a realization of the needs of balancing the Nation's industrial and agricultural interests.\n\nThe World War, increasing the demand for cotton and stimulating industrial development, gave at least a temporary return of some of the old prosperity and opened the eyes of many southerners to the new agricultural and industrial possibilities of their land. The war also stimulated the production of naval stores, particularly in the Ocean Highway country. A Georgia chemist, Dr. Charles Herty, passionately convinced of the possibility of using the pines of the large southern forests for paper-making, has devoted his energies over a long period to the project. His faith has been justified and the Ocean Highway country is already beginning to benefit from his\n\nwork. Within the last two years an enormous amount of money has been spent in building lumber and paper mills along the coast; most of the paper mills will produce kraft — brown wrapping paper — but one, at least, will produce white paper of many grades, including that for newspapers. The signs of the prosperity created by the new mills are already visible in wide areas around them.\n\nCHARACTERISTIC COASTAL DISHES\n\nThe Ocean Highway country is famous as the land of good food; nature has supplied a wide variety of fine ingredients and the inhabitants know well how to use them. Recipes are handed down from generation to generation, along with the family plate and portraits. Mention of special dishes provides a useful conversational wedge everywhere along the route and has been known to create firm friendships. Only a word of praise for a good meal is needed in a hotel to bring service that money can not buy.\n\nOf all the pleasures offered by the coastal country, food stands at the head of the list.\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nClam Fritters: the juice of a dozen clams, an equal quantity of milk, salt, four slightly beaten eggs for each pint of liquid, and enough flour so that the batter drops from a spoon. To this is added chopped raw clams, and the mixture is stirred thoroughly, dropped a tablespoonful at a time in a hot pan, and fried until it becomes a golden brown.\n\nClam Pie: one pint of clams, two medium-sized potatoes, and two medium-sized onions, are ground, salted, and boiled in clam juice for ten minutes, then placed in a pudding dish (in the middle of which a small cup has been inverted), covered with pastry, and baked for half an hour in a hot oven.\n\nSmoked Strawberry Bass: bass boiled for ten or fifteen minutes in a saucepan with an inch or less of water, and served with toast using the water in which the fish was steamed as a sauce.\n\nParsnip Stew: parsnips, potatoes, and pieces of browned salt pork stewed until tender in enough water to cover the mixture.\n\nNew Jersey Clam Chowder: chopped clams, onions, carrots, potatoes, seasoned with thyme and a small amount of salt pork.\n\nSnapper Soup: ground snapper, boiled slowly in salt water; crab meat, green peppers, thyme, parsley, small cubes of Jersey red-skin potatoes, garlic, salt, and red pepper.\n\nSnapper Stew: snapper cut in small cubes and cooked slowly; hard-boiled egg yolk, butter, cream, salt, nutmeg, and paprika are added. Served on toast.\n\nLowlands of south Jersey abound with snapping turtles, popularly known as snappers. It is a difficult job to get at the meat. The snapper is tickled on the nose with a stout stick. When he grabs it, the stick is pulled until he has fully unfolded his long neck. Then his head is chopped off behind the ears, after which he relaxes. A sharp knife is then inserted between the interstices in the side bridges that tie the lower and upper shells.\n\nDELAWARE\n\nCrab Sandwich: soft-shelled crab used as a sandwich filling. This is served at roadstands.\n\nPotato Roll: very light dinner or luncheon roll made with a maximum quantity of boiled potato.\n\nDelaware Biscuit: a cousin to the Maryland beaten biscuit, made with milk and shortening consisting partly of butter.\n\nTerrapin: served with sherry in soup plates is considered a company dish.\n\nHog-Jowl-and-Turnip Greens: young turnip tops cooked with salt pork, is a popular dish in the spring.\n\nPeninsula Succotash (south of Dover): fresh corn, lima beans and tomatoes, cooked with a piece of fat salt pork.\n\nBrandywine Punch: three parts of sauterne, one part of brandy, mixed with sparkling water; also Brandywine liqueur made of Burgundy and apricot brandy in the same proportions.\n\nPeach Cordial (company dessert or five o'clock treat): a quarter of a peck of large Delaware tree-ripened white peaches crushed with the juice of a lemon and several tablespoons of granulated sugar in the bottom of a punch bowl; to this is added a cup of old port wine, enough cracked ice to half fill the bowl, half a pint of chilled orange juice, and half a pint of chilled water. After being thoroughly stirred, this is served in wide-mouthed tumblers or in deep dessert dishes with dessert spoons.\n\nWinter Supper Dish: alternate layers of boned boiled chicken (or ham), boiled Spanish chestnuts (or boiled sweet potatoes — especially with ham), raw oysters, chopped celery hearts, parsley, and filling as for roast turkey; seasoned and moistened with chicken or ham liquor, baked in a slow oven; this is served from the baking dish to plates containing endive with French dressing.\n\nMARYLAND\n\nMaryland Biscuit: stiff biscuit dough beaten with a hatchet for 30 minutes — baked in small hard biscuits, pricked with a fork.\n\nMaryland Fried Chicken: young chicken cut in pieces, dipped in light batter, floured, fried in deep fat; served with cream gravy and waffles or corn fritters and bacon.\n\nTipsy Parson: loaf of sponge cake stuck full of blanched almonds, saturated with sherry; served with boiled custard, topped with whipped cream.\n\nEgg-Nog: yolks and whites of eggs beaten separately, with sugar, brandy, milk and plenty of rich cream; served during the holidays, especially on New Year's Day.\n\nSoft Crabs: cleaned by removing sand bag, “dead man”, and eyes — dipped in batter and cracker crumbs — fried in deep fat.\n\nCreamed Hominy: soaked overnight — simmered for six hours — creamed with butter, salt, and milk.\n\nPlanked Shad: boned, baked on hickory or other hardwood plank, served on plank with trimmings of lemon and potato chips.\n\nSally Lunn: unsweetened cake dough, raised with yeast, baked brown in deep dish.\n\nBraised Muskrat: boiled until tender — cut small and baked with thick brown crust — known as “marsh rabbit.”\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nThe Ocean Highway in Virginia passes through a land that abounds with birds and fish of exceptional quality. Housewives of the Eastern Shore cater to Epicurean tastes. It can hardly be said that they cook seafood — rather, they work magic upon all that the water yields.\n\nChincoteague Oysters make wands and witchery quite unnecessary. Their color is different from that of ordinary oysters — not gray but pure silver. The oysters are puffy fat, large, tender, and so delicious with the tang of the sea that the use of seasoning is considered a sacrilege. But if visitors prefer them cooked, they will be served oysters fried, scalloped, broiled, or baked.\n\nClam Fritters: chopped clams, seasoned, mixed with a stiff batter — and fried.\n\nChowder is rich with clams and has just enough celery, potatoes, and cream to give spice and stew-like consistency to the concoction.\n\nSoft-Shell Crabs (April-Oct.): after the “dead man” has been pulled away from the squirming little creature, the crab, still kicking, is lightly rolled in corn meal and dropped into just enough hot fat to cause a brown crust to form quickly. When soft-shell crabs are not available, clever cooks on the Shore have a way of preparing hard shells after a manner all their own. The legs and claws are cut away; the top shell is taken off; the bony structure is mashed so that the meat is easily extracted; and then the body of the crab is fried in hot butter.\n\nBird Pot-Pie: layers of birds and layers of short pastry, more layers of birds and more layers of pastry are its only ingredients.\n\nDiamond Back Terrapin: boiled alive in salt water; the black meat is then picked out, covered with a wine sauce, and served.\n\nMint Julep (served in a silver goblet covered with thick frost; it is not desecrated with cherries, chunks of pineapple, or slices of orange): two jiggers of very old whiskey — into which a teaspoonful of sugar has been melted — are poured into a silver goblet prepared by moistening the rim, dipping it in a quarter of an inch of powdered sugar, and filling the goblet with ice crushed in a clean towel and never washed after crushing; two or three sprigs of mint, whose lower leaves have been bruised, are thrust into the ice and the goblet is placed in the refrigerator for at least ten minutes before serving.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nBeaten Biscuits: made from white flour, lard, salt, and sweet milk, beaten for half an hour preferably on a marble slab; baked in a hot oven and served cold.\n\nSally Lunn: soft, muffin-like white flour batter baked in a deep cake ring and served piping hot from the oven, with melted butter.\n\nJohnny Bread: pastry of white flour, lard, and sweet milk, spread an inch thick in a biscuit pan and baked in a quick oven, split and buttered while hot, and cut into squares when served. Because this keeps fresh for days, it was originally called “journey bread.” It is especially popular for oyster roasts.\n\nCorn Pone: corn meal, water, with or without salt, shaped by hand and grooved by fingerprints, baked in a spider on top of the stove or in the oven.\n\nOyster Roasts: oysters roasted in the shell a bushel at a time on a grill over a hot brushwood fire, or, covered with jute sacks and steamed in an oven. They are served with drawn butter sauce, johnny bread or corn bread, and cole slaw. Many houses in eastern North Carolina, close to coast or river, have grills or ovens either outdoors or in the basement and a specially made table with a center groove for disposing of the shells.\n\nBarbecued Meat: pig, lamb, or chicken roasted in or outdoors and basted with a highly seasoned sauce of butter, lemon juice, tomato catsup, ginger, vinegar, mustard, salt, and red and black pepper. Sweet potatoes and apples are often roasted with a barbecued pig.\n\nBroiled Ham: from country-cured, peanut-fed hogs, smoked over green hickory chips, and broiled in a skillet either on top of the stove or in the oven.\n\nFresh Shad Roe: broiled in butter.\n\nDevilled Crabs: hard-shelled crabs scalloped with butter, lemon juice, hard-cooked egg, bread crumbs, highly seasoned, and served in a baking dish or stuffed in shells.\n\nSalt Roe Herring or Hickory Smoked Herring: broiled, and seldom served without hominy grits.\n\nSweet Potato Custard: boiled mashed sweet potato mixed with milk and egg and flavored with nutmeg; baked in a crust-lined pie pan with no top crust; served with or without whipped cream.\n\nSyllabub: heavy cream slightly sweetened and Scuppernong wine beaten together with an egg-beater (or syllabub churn) until stiff.\n\nSally White Cake: pound cake batter, sherry wine, citron, coconut, blanched almonds, rose water, and mace, sometimes moistened with peach brandy.\n\nFruit Shortcake: made with a short unsweetened biscuit dough.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA\n\nSelena la Bruce's Rice Bread: cold hominy or rice cooked with rice-flour, eggs, and yeast.\n\nBaked Shad: fish stuffed with dressing made from potatoes, eggs, celery, and onion, then baked slowly.\n\nTerrapin Soup: fresh-water terrapin boiled with bacon, cloves, allspice, and other seasonings; to this, just before serving, one glass of wine, containing a grated nutmeg, is added.\n\nHop-in-John: cow peas, rice, and bacon boiled together.\n\nCarolina Pilau: broiled chicken cooked with rice which has been browned in bacon drippings.\n\nVenison Pie: venison and brown gravy seasoned with wine, mace, nutmeg, and hard-boiled eggs; cooked in a deep dish lined and covered with pastry made of butter and flour.\n\nOyster Stew with Mace: oysters cooked in cream seasoned with mace.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nSouse Meat: hog's head, ears, and feet stewed, mashed, seasoned pressed, and sliced when cold.\n\nTurnip Greens: fresh and tender turnip tops, boiled with salt pork or smoked bacon.\n\nLeather Breeches: dried green snap beans, soaked overnight, and boiled with salt bacon.\n\nBrunswick Stew: chopped beef, pork, tomatoes, corn, onion, peppers, and high seasonings.\n\nFried Pies: pastry filled with dried or fresh fruit and fried in hot fat.\n\nAlligator Pear Salad: stuffed with crab meat.\n\nSherry Consomme: served with beaten biscuits.\n\nDeep Pot Chicken: swimming in yellow gravy and served with wild rice.\n\nBoiled Chitterlings: served hot with barbecue dressing, or cold with vinegar and red pepper sauce.\n\n“Good hot fried chittlin's, crisp and brown,Ripe hard cider to wash it down;Cold slaw, cold pickle, sweet tater pie,And hot corn pone to slap your eye.”FLORIDA\n\nFried Shrimp: shrimp cleaned in the usual way, except that the tails are left on, are seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped in a batter made of beaten egg, rolled in cracker meal, and fried quickly in fat. The shrimp are eaten by holding the tail between the thumb and finger and dipping them in catsup, chilli sauce, or relish.\n\nRoasted Oysters: oysters covered with wet sacks (to prevent charring and make them open more easily) are roasted over an open furnace, or charcoal pot covered by a strip of tin or a wire grill. After roasting, the shells are removed and the oysters dipped in melted butter.\n\nMullet Baked in Clay: cleaned mullet wrapped in leaves, rolled in soft clay, and baked in the glowing coals of a charcoal pot. When the clay has been baked hard, it is broken with a hammer and opened carefully. The mullet skin adheres to the leaves, and the flesh is removed intact.\n\nSmoked Mullet: mullet that has been cleaned, salted, and seasoned overnight is washed, hung up to dry, and then smoked over hickory wood for ten or twelve hours.\n\nMAIN ROUTE\n\nNew Brunswick, New Jersey to Jacksonville, Florida\n\nFerries across the Delaware River, the Chesapeake Bay and the Elizabeth River\n\nUS 130, US 40, US 13, and US 17\n\n992.3 miles\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nNew Brunswick — Hightstown — Camden — Delaware River Ferry at Pennsville, 88 m. US 130.\n\nPennsylvania R.R. roughly parallels route.\n\nAll types of accommodations throughout.\n\nTwo- and four-lane concrete or macadam roadbed. Heavy freight traffic at night.\n\nSection 1. New Brunswick to Delaware River, 88 m. US 130\n\nUS 130 avoids the congestion of traffic around Trenton and Philadelphia, and passes through more varied and attractive country than does the heavily traveled US 1, from which it branches. Small communities in the northern section retain much of the flavor of the days when the Dutch and the English made the first settlements in the area. Farms and woodlands line the highway throughout but in the flatter country between Camden and Pennsville, corn shocks and trees alike are scarcer, and broad creeks and marshes are numerous. Between Bordentown and Pennsville, US 130 follows the course of the Delaware River, which is about two miles away (R), and the tall chimneys of factories along the riverbanks are seen at intervals. Beyond the river rise the towers and skyscrapers of Philadelphia.\n\nUS 130 branches S. from US 1 at a traffic circle, 0 m., on the southern edge of New Brunswick, 38 m. W. of New York City. Several hundred feet R. stands the red and white steel tower of an airway beacon.\n\nDEANS, 5.3 m. (85 alt., 200 pop.), in the center of farming country, still has, on one of its four corners, pasture land, with an old-fashioned red barn not far beyond.\n\nDAYTON, 7.5 m. (117 alt., 390 pop.), was named for Jonathan Dayton who served in the Revolutionary Army and was later a brigadier general in the United States Army; he was a delegate to the Federal Constitutional Convention and served the State in both houses of Congress. Dayton, Ohio, was named for him. The little village is an important shipping point for potato growers. A blacksmith shop and, in season, crowded corncribs and haystacks accent the peaceful rusticity of the neighborhood.\n\nMany old houses are still standing along the road in this region. One, built in 1710, is some distance from the highway at 10 m. (R).\n\nIt is recognizable more by the roadside sign advertising its age than by characteristics of Colonial architecture.\n\nWindmills, having water tanks midway in their towers, as is customary in South Jersey, move their fans languidly in the gentle, fairly constant winds. The extensive Forsgate Farms (L), plainly marked by a large sign, has good herds and fine buildings; it is one of the leading producers of Grade A milk in New Jersey.\n\nAt 11.1 m. is the junction with a concrete road.\n\nRight on this road to CRANBURY, 1.4 m. (110 alt., 1,278 pop.), one of the centers of a potato-growing district; it retains much of the charm of early America. The streets are lined with old frame houses, some of them converted into stores, others the homes of retired farmers. The village post office is almost concealed within the bulky Masonic Hall (L).\n\nCranbury was settled in 1682 and here, fifty years later, David Brainerd, the young follower of George Whitefield, often preached to the Indians under one of the spreading village elms. After his death from tuberculosis in 1747 at the age of 29, Brainerd's diary was an inspiration to many other “witnesses to the spirit.”\n\nOn the north edge of the town (R) is the L. P. Curtin House, recognized by its white frame walls and the iron grillwork on the porch. Aaron Burr slept here in 1804 while fleeing from New York to Philadelphia after wounding Alexander Hamilton in the fatal duel. In summer the blossoms of the giant lotus on Brainerd Lake (L) form one of the area's most beautiful sights. Near the lake is Cranbury Inn, which in 1780 began to supply meat and drink to travelers on what was then the old York Road. Two of these wayfarers were Washington and Hamilton. The well-proportioned First Presbyterian Church (R), built in 1734, is painted an immaculate white; it has two fluted columns on the façade and a graceful lantern. In the well-kept cemetery behind the church, names and dates from 1758 are legible on the gravestones.\n\nThe highway cutting through fields and across the eastern end of Brainerd Lake (R) by-passes Cranbury (R).\n\nAt 13.7 m., at a traffic circle, is the junction (R) with Cranbury's main street (see side tour above), and a concrete road (L).\n\nLeft on this road is HIGHTSTOWN, 1.5 m. (100 alt., 3,012 pop.), a busy market place, for the surrounding farm country; it also has some manufacturing plants. The entrance to the town from the N. is attractive, with grand old willow trees grouped on the shore of Peddie Lake (L), and an ornate stone firehouse (R). Houses erected before 1800 are scattered about the village among buildings of later construction. Elaborate iron grillwork ornaments the porches of some of the old homes. The Sarah B. Smith House, 137 Stockton St., just behind the railroad station, was built in 1770 and in 1819 became the community's first post office. A modern touch is given Hightstown by the concrete street markers, designed in the shape of the Washington Monument.\n\nFounded in 1721, the town was named for John Hight, an early landowner. In 1854 it became a station on the Camden and Amboy, the first railroad built in New Jersey.\n\nThe Peddie School, established in 1864, is a private preparatory institution for boys. Its eighteen buildings serve the needs of approximately 260 students; the fine campus of 148 acres includes a private golf course.\n\nLeft from N. Main St. on Extra Rd. to JERSEY HOMESTEADS, 6.5 m., a project started by the Interior Department. Two hundred houses, built of cinderconcrete blocks, with flat, overhanging roofs are in horseshoe shaped groups. This combined agricultural and industrial community, covering 1,260 acres in rolling, partly-wooded country, was planned to remove about 200 families whose heads are union needle-trades workers from the crowded districts of Philadelphia and New York. The community is organized on a cooperative basis. Each family contributes $500 to a general fund for financing the equipment and operation of a women's clothing factory. A 414-acre farm is part of the cooperative experiment. Net profits will be divided equally among all residents — factory workers, farm workers, and clerks of the cooperative stores. The residents will make payments on their houses over a period of 40 years, with interest at three percent on the unpaid balances. One purpose of the project is to show that an industry, hitherto heavily concentrated in the slum and sweatshop areas of large cities, can be decentralized with its workers improving their own living conditions by cooperative methods.\n\nSouth of the traffic circle, the highway by-passes Hightstown (L).\n\nAt 17 m. is the junction with a concrete road leading into Hightstown (see side tour above).\n\nWINDSOR, 18.9 m. (100 alt., 250 pop.), was named by the English who settled here about 1714. A row of old-fashioned frame houses (L) lines the main street, but more conspicuous than these is the weathered brick General Store which for more than a hundred years has been the trading place of the large surrounding farm district. Behind the iron posts and worn wooden steps of the porch is an interior typical of hundreds of stores of a century ago. One display cabinet is filled with all kinds and colors of threads; another is stocked with spices. Both the cabinets and the wooden counters are even older than the pot-bellied stove in the center of the store.\n\nVineyards and nurseries, thriving on the rich loam of the region, and prosperous farms showing modern improvements and equipment, make this an unusually attractive area. Occasionally a snake fence encloses one of the fields. The village being within commuting distance of Trenton, many residents daily drive or ride on busses to work in the factories there.\n\nROBBINSVILLE, 22.4 m., a hamlet off the highway (R), was at one time known as Hungry Hill because wayfarers found it hard to obtain food there. English Quakers settled the land in 1750, and the\n\ncommunity took its name from George Robbins, an early resident.\n\nThe business district of YARDVILLE, 25.4 m. (60 alt., 920 pop.), is a few hundred yards from the highway (R). A rubber mill and a floor-covering factory are the principal industrial establishments. The village, formerly called Sand Hill, was the point where passengers on the pioneer Camden and Amboy R.R. left the train to be shuttled by stagecoach to Trenton; in 1850 the name was changed to honor the first postmaster. Many inhabitants are employed in Trenton.\n\nOn the southern edge of Yardville US 130 crosses Crosswicks Creek, remembered for a Revolutionary skirmish that took place 2 miles upstream at Crosswicks village, when the British Army was marching from Philadelphia to Monmouth in June 1778. Bogiron was mined in this area in Colonial times, and sailing vessels used the creek regularly in collecting and discharging cargoes.\n\nAt 28.3 m. is the junction with a marked, paved road.\n\nRight on this road to the Clara Barton School, 0.2 m., a diminutive red-brick building resembling a doll's house, which stands in a triangular plot at the road fork. The key to the house may be borrowed from a nearby resident, but all of the plain interior can be seen through the windows. The school, built in 1839, was used from 1852 to 1854 by Miss Barton, later founder of what is now the American National Red Cross, as an experiment in free public-school education. Her resignation in 1854 was a protest against the townspeople's action in naming a male principal to supervise her work.\n\nBORDENTOWN, 0.5 m. (65 alt., 4,400 pop.) (see N. J. GUIDE).\n\nRailroad Station. Pennsylvania R.R., Camden Branch, by Delaware River.\n\nAccommodations. Two small hotels.\n\nPoints of Interest. Bordentown Military Institute, Bonaparte Park, John Bull Locomotive Monument.\n\nThe New Jersey Manual Training School, 29.3 m. (R), is a State institution giving agricultural and industrial training to about three hundred Negro boys and girls. There is a small tuition fee. Part of the responsibility of the large teaching staff is to find employment for graduates of the school.\n\nThe Delaware River is visible (R) at 29.8 m. The land here is a low-lying plateau, slightly undulating, with ravines and shallow valleys cut by creeks on their way to the river.\n\nAt 32.7 m. is the junction with a concrete road.\n\nRight on this road is ROEBLING, 1 m., a company town established by John A. Roebling, founder of the large steel-cable factory that supplied cables for\n\nthe Brooklyn, the Niagara Falls, and other big suspension bridges. Workers of Hungarian and other central European nationalities have long been employed here. Viewed from US 130, the outlying fringe of company houses of the town seems in keeping with the worst slum traditions. Closer examination disproves this, however, for some of the dwellings are of modern construction, all are of substantial brick, and the streets have been carefully planted with trees. Old-fashioned, solid-row construction has made windows impossible except at front and back, and there is an atmosphere of somber monotony about the town that is in no wise lessened by the inherent ugliness of the mill buildings and the waste land around them.\n\nSouth of the junction with the road to Roebling the highway is almost a straight line, avoiding the curves of the Delaware River, 2 to 3 miles R.\n\nAt 36.9 m., where US 130 turns (L) to by-pass the city of Burlington, is the junction with the concrete road.\n\nRight (straight ahead) on this road is BURLINGTON, 1 m. (10 alt., 10,844 pop.) (see N. J. GUIDE).\n\nRailroad Station. Pennsylvania R.R., Broad St. in center of town.\n\nAccommodations. Several small hotels and inns; tourist homes.\n\nPoints of Interest. Birthplace of James Fenimore Cooper, Old Quaker Burial Ground, St. Mary's Church (1702) and St. Mary's Cemetery, the Witches’ Tree, Thomas Revel (William Penn) House, Green Bank.\n\nAt 41.1 m. is the junction (R) with the road detouring through Burlington. South of this point US 130 traverses the peach orchard section of Burlington County, where the spring blossoms attract thousands of visitors each year.\n\nAt 43.2 m. is Rancocas Creek, largest tributary of the Delaware River in this region. US 130 crosses the creek on a drawbridge that is a reminder of the busy traffic in lumber and charcoal that once passed along the stream. William Franklin, son of Benjamin Franklin and last Royal Governor of New Jersey, had an estate on the banks of the creek. Appointed in 1763 as a compliment to his father, he did not share his parent's democratic viewpoint and remained ardently loyal to the Crown. At the outbreak of the Revolution, his arrest and imprisonment were ordered by the New Jersey Legislature because of his autocratic handling of State affairs. In 1778 he was freed through an exchange of prisoners; later he went to England and was reconciled with his father, but never returned to America.\n\nBRIDGEBORO, 43.5 m. (20 alt., 500 pop.), lies (L) on the south bank of Rancocas Creek, with a cluster of stores and frame houses.\n\nCINNAMINSON, 47.2 m. (80 alt., 100 pop.), once had its provocative name on postmarks, but mail is now handled through the post office at nearby Riverton. To nurserymen and entomologists Cinnaminson is known as the primary port of entry of the Japanese beetle. In 1916 the first of these brightly colored beetles appeared in the community, unrecognized as the parent of future billions of pests. The insect was probably imported as a grub, concealed in soil packed around the roots of Japanese iris. Only a year later the U. S. Department of Agriculture established the Japanese Beetle Laboratory, and ever since then Federal and State experts have waged continuous war on the destructive insect by quarantine rules, poison sprays, and the importation of parasitic enemies. Although the area of heavy infestation has a radius of scarcely 100 miles from Cinnaminson, stowaway beetles have traveled by automobile and train as far north as Maine and as far west as Missouri, settling new colonies there and at scores of way stations. Motorists should beware of hitch-hiking beetles, especially during July and August when they are most numerous.\n\nAt the junction with a macadam road (L) is the Friends’ Meeting House, a charming little red brick building erected in 1859. It stands on a shaded knoll, back from the road.\n\nAt 48.6 m. is the junction with State 41.\n\nRight on this highway is the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge (toll, 35¢ for car and passengers), 2.5 m., a steel arch span over the Delaware River; its western end is in the city of Philadelphia.\n\nSouth of this junction the highway passes through the Camden suburbs. Though the section is not very attractive, Camden's back yard is better than the average outlying district of a manufacturing center.\n\nAt 51.6 m. is the junction with Cove Rd., a concrete-paved highway.\n\nRight on this road to Arlington Cemetery, 0.6 m., which holds the Grave of Peter J. McGuire, known as the “Father of Labor Day.” The grave, marked by a 6-foot polished granite tombstone, is 225 yards N. of the cemetery entrance. On Labor Day of each year it is visited by scores of workingmen and leaders of organized labor. During the 1870’s McGuire carried on a one-man campaign for the 8-hour day and a national holiday for the workingman. In 1875 he made his home in Camden and later he organized several unions. With Samuel Gompers, he helped form the American Federation of Labor in 1881. Because of his success in settling strikes he gained considerable reputation as an arbitrator. In 1894 Congress\n\nfinally declared Labor Day a national holiday and in succeeding years the Nation moved nearer to McGuire's goal of “8 hours for work, 8 hours for play and 8 hours for rest, and $1 an hour for skilled labor.” McGuire died in 1906.\n\nAt 54.1 m., at a traffic circle, is the junction with State 40.\n\nRight on this road to the business district of CAMDEN, 2 m. (20 alt., 118,700 pop.) (see N. J. GUIDE).\n\nRailroad Station. Pennsylvania R.R. and Pennsylvania Reading Seashore Line, Delaware River and Federal St.\n\nRapid Transit line to Philadelphia, stations at City Hall Plaza and at Broadway and Carman Sts.\n\nDelaware River Suspension Bridge. Toll: 25¢.\n\nFerries to Philadelphia. Constant service to Chestnut, Market and South Sts. 25¢.\n\nPoints of Interest. Walt Whitman House Museum, Joseph Cooper House Museum, Pomona Hall, shipyards, RCA-Victor and Campbell's Soup factories, PWA Westfield Acres Project, and others.\n\nLeft of the traffic circle is Camden Airport, mail and passenger terminal for both Camden and Philadelphia. It is a station on all principal air lines of the East for service to Newark and New England, to Washington and the southern States, and to Chicago and the Pacific coast.\n\nSouth of the airport, US 130 by-passes the business centers of suburban communities and twists through a succession of traffic circles and bridges, taxing the motorist's ability to keep a steady eye on the route number signs. It finally branches (R) at 59.4 m. from the broad lanes of concrete to become a two-lane highway — not very straight and in some places not very smooth. There are frequent views of the Philadelphia skyline (R) along this section of the road. The countryside loses its suburban appearance and once more offers views of fields that in autumn are stubbled, brown, and spotted with piles of bright pumpkins and yellow corn.\n\nA strange collection of concrete end-walls, sole remains of one-story buildings that formerly covered several acres, is standing on the pasture land (R), at 60 m. This was the Site of the Woodbury Bag-Loading Plant, where gunpowder was packed for shipment overseas during the World War. Directly across the channel of the Delaware River are the tall cranes of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. When motors are being tested there, the wind carries their roaring to the Jersey shore.\n\nAt 62.2 m. is the junction with a concrete road.\n\nRight on this road is RED BANK BATTLEFIELD NATIONAL PARK, 2 m. Here, on the high bank at the edge of Delaware River, stood Fort Mercer,\n\nhastily built in the fall of 1777 to prevent the British fleet from joining the land forces that occupied Philadelphia. Before the earthworks had been completed by 400 Rhode Island volunteers, a surprise attack was made from the rear by 2,000 Hessian troops. The Americans held their fire until the Hessian battalions swept up to the base of the ramparts; they then unleashed a hail of musketballs and grapeshot at close range. With 400 dead and wounded, the Hessians fell back, reformed their lines and charged again. They were again repulsed and their commander, Count Donop, was captured and mortally wounded. As the “rented” soldier lay dying he said, “I die a victim of my ambition and the avarice of my sovereign.” Meanwhile, American guns mounted on barges were hurling shots into the British fleet. Although the battle at Fort Mercer lasted barely half an hour, the naval engagement was continued the next day, October 23. Two British vessels, the 64-gun Augusta and the 18-gun Merlin, took fire and blew up. Fort Mifflin on the Pennsylvania side held out against the British fleet until November 11 but it was finally pounded to pieces. Washington, unable to spare enough men for its defense, later abandoned Fort Mercer. Some of the old trenches are still clearly defined; around a State Monument are three cannon, long buried but finally discovered with a radio detector.\n\nThe only building nearby is the old stone and brick Whitall House (adm. 25¢), maintained by the Daughters of the American Revolution in honor of a Quaker dame whose nonchalance during the battle set an all-time record even for the calm folk of Gloucester County. Ann Whitall was busy with her spinning in an upstairs chamber when the battle began. Balls whistled past the gables; finally, one shot blasted its way through the wall and hurtled across the room into the opposite wall. The old lady picked up her spinning wheel and went to the cellar, continuing her work until the battle ended and wounded men were brought to her house. While she bound up the wounds of Hessian soldiers, she scolded them for coming to America to butcher the colonists. The house is excellently preserved and Mrs. Whitall's spinning wheel is in one of the two rooms containing Colonial furnishings. Near the Whitall house is a Picnic Grove with the usual facilities,\n\nThe highway passes through level valley lands, utilized to a large extent for asparagus growing. Rows of cedar trees mark farm lanes and boundaries. Several tidal creeks are crossed.\n\nPAULSBORO, 66.2 m. (15 alt., 7,121 pop.), lies W. of Mantua Creek. A large oil refinery, a fertilizer works, a paint factory, and some smaller plants made it a manufacturing community of some importance. The highway follows Broad St., along which are the stores and other business houses. Paulsboro has operated a Municipal Gas Plant since 1909, apparently to the satisfaction of its voters since they have rejected a proposal to sell it. The plant is one of a scant dozen publicly-owned utilities in the State. In 1935 its receipts were $40,209, which was more than enough to cover all expenses, including operating costs and $13,205 paid for interest and the retirement of bonds.\n\nThe town dates back to 1681, when John Fenwick and Edward Byllynge brought 250 colonists to the section. Philip Paul, for whom the settlement was named, arrived in 1685. His family Bible is kept at Borough Hall (L). In Lincoln Park (R) on the waterfront are the ruins of an old cellar; shortly after the Revolution the house that stood here was occupied by a gang of counterfeiters, producing bonds and money worth even less than the Continentals then in circulation. When officers raided the house, the ringleader stood at the top of the stairs and, hoping to gain time while his wife burned the counterfeits in an adjoining room, threatened to shoot the first man to come up. The Federal men saw through the ruse; there was no shooting.\n\nGIBBSTOWN, 69.4 m. (10 alt., 208 pop.), is mostly a double row of frame houses. Here live many of the workmen employed in one of the largest of the du Pont high-explosive plants.\n\nDu Pont pay envelopes carry most of the income of those who live in the entire section between Paulsboro and Pennsville. Although Wilmington is the capital of this huge industrial dynasty, operations have been extended across the Delaware River until they affect the life of every town and hamlet in the river section. Many Pennsylvanians come by boat to work in the New Jersey factories making war materials, explosives, paints, dyes, and other du Pont products.\n\nBRIDGEPORT, 73.5 m. (20 alt., 850 pop.), has cornfields extending almost to the back doors of a line of comfortable old houses (R) on the main thoroughfare. The community is sufficiently large, however, to support an automobile sales agency and other business houses.\n\nAt 73.8 m. is the junction with a macadam road, US 322.\n\nRight on this road to the Chester (Pa.) Ferry, 1.5 m. (24-hour service May 30 to Oct. 1; 50¢ for car and driver, 5¢ for each passenger.)\n\nMaking few curves, the highway runs through a rather dreary section of lowlands. Farms and farmhouses are not numerous. The late afternoon sun glints more brightly on the shining aluminum paint of oil storage tanks across the river at Chester than on the still waters of the tidal marshes.\n\nSouth of Oldman's Creek, US 130 passes the Delaware Ordnance Depot of the United States Army (R), a typical Army reservation in neatness and landscaping. Established during the World War,\n\nthe depot is still used for storing shells of both large and small caliber. One ordnance company, numbering about 50 men, is stationed here, and there are many civilian employees.\n\nPENNSGROVE, 81.2 m. (12 alt., 5,895 pop.), is the southern-most town of consequence along the New Jersey shore of the Delaware. The community has a motion picture house, a bustling shopping district, and a large residential section. By common industrial interests Pennsgrove is closely linked with Wilmington, Del., across the river. (Ferry service all year, leaving Pennsgrove 6 a.m. to midnight; car and driver 75¢, passengers 10¢ each. Messages received for patrons.)\n\nCARNEY'S POINT, 82.6 m. (10 alt., 3,050 pop.), is a southern extension of Pennsgrove. The handsome Regional High School is by the highway (L). A large group of uniformly painted green and white frame houses (R) gives a key to the village's means of livelihood. These are du Pont-owned dwellings, built as emergency shelters during the World War and since then improved for rental to employees. A du Pont Powder Plant is situated nearby.\n\nDEEPWATER, 85.1 m. (10 alt., 537 pop.), has two important industries, a du Pont Dye Works and a Power Plant of the Atlantic City Electric Co.\n\nPENNSVILLE, 87.8 m. (12 alt., 412 pop.), was once known as a center for sturgeon and shad fishermen, but pollution of the Delaware by waste from upstream factories has driven the fish away. Today the little village is chiefly a ferry terminal and another residential section inhabited by du Pont workers. An amusement park, Riverview Beach, has a roller coaster and a swimming pool. The region around Pennsville was settled by Swedes shortly after 1636.\n\nRight from the center of Pennsville to the Pennsville Ferry, 87.9 m., which runs to New Castle, Del. (24-hour service; car and driver 75¢, passengers 10¢; messages received and delivered for patrons.)\n\nAs the ferry moves from its Jersey landing, the low shore line of Delaware is seen ahead, scarcely broken by the roofs and spires of old New Castle. Wilmington, up the river (R), is indicated by a smudge of smoke from its many factories.\n\nDELAWARE\n\nDelaware River at New Castle — Hare's Corner — Dover — Maryland Line. 93 m. US 40, US 13.\n\nPennsylvania R.R. closely parallels route between New Castle and Md. Line. Excellent paved roadbed; 45-mile speed limit. State Highway Police Stations at State Road, Dover, and Bridgeville render first aid and other assistance. Numerous filling stations, at many of which certified drinking water is available. Hotels in most towns of more than 2,000 pop.; tourist homes in towns; few tourist camps.\n\nSection 2. New Castle to Hare's Corner, 2.5 m. US 40\n\nThe ferry slip on the Delaware shore is at the foot of Chestnut St. in New Castle.\n\nNEW CASTLE, 0 m. (10 alt., 4,131 pop.) (see DEL. GUIDE, also NEW CASTLE ON THE DELAWARE).\n\nRailroad Station. Pennsylvania R.R., South St. near 8th.\n\nNew Castle-Pennsville Ferry. Foot of Chestnut St.; 24-hour service; basic summer schedule, service every 20 min.; car and driver 75¢, passengers 10¢ each.\n\nAnnual “Day in Old New Castle.” Usually 3rd Saturday in May. Fee of $2 covers admission to all old houses and buildings.\n\nNew Castle was founded by the Dutch under Peter Stuyvesant in 1651 as Fort Casimir, became Fort Trinity under the Swedes in 1654, and New Amstel under the Dutch in 1656. The name New Castle was given after the overthrow of the Dutch by the English in 1664.\n\nThe fine old Courthouse on the Green was the seat of the Colonial assembly in the period between 1704 and 1776 when the Three Lower Counties, as the region was called, were a semi-autonomous part of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1776-1777 New Castle was the capital of the new State of Delaware. The county courts sat here for two centuries prior to their removal to Wilmington in 1881.\n\nThough the outskirts are bordered by industrial plants, including steel and iron mills, and a rayon and an aircraft factory; the plants might be miles away for all the effect they have on the old section about the Green. In the heart of New Castle, beginning at the river bank, stand a score of Colonial and post-Revolutionary public buildings, churches, and private houses, in their original form or only slightly changed; together with the later buildings scattered among them they provide a museum collection illustrating architectural development in the region. The most important structures belong to\n\nthe era when New Castle was a busy port and a governmental and judicial center — when horses and coaches bore George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and other distinguished persons to the town, to board the sailing packets for Philadelphia.\n\nFor a century and a half the little city was an important point on the main route connecting the seaboard colonies. As early as 1671 a cartroad ran from here across the neck of the Chesapeake and Delaware Peninsula; later a well-traveled road to the head of Chesapeake Bay became the New Castle and Frenchtown Turnpike. In 1833 one of the first steam locomotives used in the country began pulling trains over the New Castle and Frenchtown R.R. to meet vessels running from Maryland and Virginia ports. By 1845, however, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the new railroad around the head of the bay were carrying most of the passengers and freight, and the day of New Castle as an important trade center was passing.\n\nAmong the noteworthy buildings are Immanuel Church, on the Green; Amstel House, a museum, 4th and Delaware Sts.; the Old Dutch House, 3rd St. between Delaware and Harmony Sts.; and the Read House on the Strand, near Harmony. (See NEW CASTLE ON THE DELAWARE.)\n\nAt 1.1 m., at the junction with State 41, is (L) Bellanca Field (open to visitors 8-5 by permission), adjoining the factory of the Bellanca Aircraft Corporation, makers of cabin monoplanes and other types of planes, and contractors to the United States and foreign governments. Bellanca airplanes have made nine non-stop flights across the Atlantic Ocean, one non-stop flight across the Pacific, and two round-the-world flights.\n\nNew Castle Common, 1.2 m. (R), is a tract of 1,068 acres divided into farms from which the revenue, for more than two and one half centuries, has gone to the town of New Castle.\n\nFrom earliest days of settlement the Dutch and the Swedes set aside certain areas for the public to use for pasturage, for the production of public revenue and so on. When the English took over the Delaware Colony in 1664 community ownership of the tracts was confirmed. William Penn, becoming the Proprietary in 1682, reconfirmed the reservation, but there were so many complaints of abuses that in 1701 he ordered that the land “hitherto reputed and called New Castle Common” be established in one convenient tract of 1,000 acres. Still the abuses and encroachments kept on, and in 1764\n\nAT THE JERSEY HOMESTEADS NEAR HIGHTSTOWN, New Jersey\n\nOLD DRAWYERS PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, DELAWARE\n\na charter was secured from Thomas and Richard Penn, sons of William, setting up a board of trustees with power to protect the property.\n\nBut this charter did not empower the trustees to lease the land to farmers who would till it on shares. To this end in 1791 two Penns, both named John, heirs of the Proprietary, signed away all claim to the land to permit the incorporation of the Trustees of the Common under the laws of the State of Delaware; in the deed they provided against the selling of the land or the diversion of any of its income. The next year (1792) the charter from the State established the system under which the Common farms have since been leased. Gross income averages $7,500 annually. After deducting the cost of repairs, and insurance and the county taxes, New Castle obtains enough income for town expenses to benefit its taxpayers materially. In 1885 the Trustees of the Common procured an act of the legislature abrogating that part of the Penns’ deed forbidding the sale of any Common land; however, except for some small parts sold for rights-of-way and other public or semipublic uses, none has been sold and the Common has remained to protect the west side of New Castle from unsightly developments.\n\nAt the junction with US 13 is HARE'S CORNER, 2.5 m., once a stagestop and a cattle market to which large herds were driven by farm boys and farmers. The Green Tree Inn, razed in 1931 to make way for the dual road (US 13), stood at the NE. corner. Here travelers alighted for refreshment while their horses were watered or changed.\n\nSection 3. Hare's Corner to Maryland Line, 90.5 m. US 13\n\nSouth of this junction, US 13 — the Du Pont Blvd. between Hare's Corner and Dover — spans nearly the whole length of the little State of Delaware, passing through two distinct regions, the gently rolling farmland of middle Delaware and the flat, sandy, pine-wooded southern end of the State. The Delaware section of the route traverses about one-half the length of the so-called Delmarva Peninsula, the water-bound region east of Chesapeake Bay that comprises the State of Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia. Most of the peninsula rises only a few feet above sea level.\n\nBordered by few notable buildings, battlefields, or natural wonders, the route's attractions lie in the succession of comfortable farmsteads, peach and apple orchards, and vistas of quiet charm. It presents marked variations in the physical aspect of the land and in the life of the people. Within a distance of 25 miles there are in some places wide differences in terrain, forestation, crops, farming customs, architectural style and building materials, political color, tempo of life, and even in accent and expressions of speech. A farmer who lives in the southern part of the State and drives a truckload of vegetables to Wilmington every Saturday, may say “okie-doke” and then speak of “housen” for houses, or of a chicken that has been dead too long as “dainty.” North and South, the 20th and 18th centuries, the rocky Piedmont and the broad salt marshes, meet along the road. Though the upper tenth of the State has a modern northern tone, the lower nine-tenths is akin in many ways to the old South. Delaware was a border slave State, and the proportion of Negroes (13.7 per cent) is higher than that in Kentucky. The bald cypress and the turkey-buzzard, both found in Delaware, are native to the South.\n\nHARE'S CORNER, 0 m., is at the junction with US 40.\n\nRoses planted and tended by the State Highway Department bloom throughout the summer along the many bridges and cause-ways of US 13 in Delaware.\n\nBuena Vista (open annual “Day in Old New Castle”), 2.7 m. (R), is a plain brick house erected in 1846 by John M. Clayton, who served as Chief Justice of Delaware, United States Senator, and Secretary of State under President Zachary Taylor. The house, to which a large wing has been recently added, stands at the end of a long avenue of trees. Clayton named the place in honor of Taylor's victory at Buena Vista, Mexico, in 1847, in the Mexican War — which Clayton had vigorously opposed in the Senate. Paintings at Buena Vista include a Portrait of Queen Elizabeth, painted about 1580 by Nicholas Hilliard, and a number of portraits by Gilbert Stuart. The present owner (1937) of Buena Vista is Clayton Douglass Buck, a great-nephew of John M. Clayton and the only Governor of Delaware to succeed himself (1929-1937). Governor Buck was largely instrumental in developing the excellent system of roads covering the State. The Claytons, a family important in State history for generations, came to Delaware with William Penn in 1682.\n\nAt 4.9 m. the road crosses Red Lion Creek, named for a nearby tavern. The creek is the boundary between New Castle Hundred and Red Lion Hundred. In Delaware the term “hundred” has been used for a political division of a county since the late 17th century; Delaware is the only State still using the term though it was formerly used in parts of Maryland and Virginia. A hundred is a tax and representation district in New Castle County. In Kent and Sussex Counties, some representation districts cross the hundred boundaries. The English hundreds established in Anglo-Saxon times by King Alfred were geographical and governmental units containing ten families, ten estates, or 100 fighting men. Each hundred had its feudal courts. By Penn's time the hundred meant little more than it does now in Delaware, though he at first planned to divide his territory into tracts of 10,000 acres to be settled with one family on each 1,000 acres.\n\nRed Lion Hundred, a wheat-growing and dairying section of declining fertility, extending east to the wide marshes of the Delaware River, is the smallest in the State — 22 square miles. In 1850 its farms and orchards were the most productive and profitable in the State. In the 1830's the once-famous Delaware peach-growing had its beginning here, spreading through the peninsula until about 1870, when the blight called the “yellows” destroyed the orchards. Around 1845 one landowner, Maj. Philip Reybold, with 80,000 bearing peach trees on his estate, had such large crops that he shipped them to Philadelphia and Baltimore on his own steamers. Such high productivity was no accident; it resulted from a pioneer adoption of scientific methods in the use of exhausted and apparently worthless land.\n\nBy 1800 successive crops of grain and tobacco, raised by slave labor, had completely worn out the soil; old tobacco barns along the roads were falling down. Then in 1823-29 the digging of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal revealed beds of marl, a substance containing decayed seashells of an early geologic period. A canal contractor spread some of the material on his land and found that its carbonate of lime produced amazing results in his crops. In the following years thousands of cartloads of marl were dug by Negroes and spread on the farms until the appearance of commercial lime ended the herculean job of moving eight tons of the stuff to get one ton of lime.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the more prosperous farmers were sending sons to college to learn, among other things, methods of crop rotation and fertilization. The topsoil was restored to still greater fertility. As a result of prosperity many substantial brick houses, surrounded by numerous tenant houses for Negroes, were built along this and other roads in the hundred. Social life became, on a small scale, that of a landed aristocracy and included dancing, fox hunting, and much drinking in spite of the prevailing Presbyterianism of the Scottish-Irish gentry. Slaveholding persisted, but many slaves were held as such only until attaining the age of 25 or 30, when they were given their freedom. They were able to earn $15 or $20 a month and the landowners grew rich on the crops they tended. When the Civil War came prices went sky high, and profits were huge.\n\nAfter the war there were no more slaves, and laborers were demanding higher wages for their work. Prices of farm products fell. The Negroes began migrating to the cities of the North, and white labor was “scarce and common at that.” As the tobacco barns had been falling down by 1800, so the frame tenant houses around the big brick houses were falling down by 1900. The mansions themselves contained tenants.\n\nThe rains are again carrying the thin topsoil into the gullies on many farms in Red Lion Hundred and a second cycle in their agricultural history is nearing completion.\n\nAt 6.3 m. (L) is a rectangular grove of trees, the Site of Brookfield, built in 1860 and later burned; it was the home of Capt. Charles Corbit (1838-1887). Corbit's wild charge at Westminster, Md., on June 29, 1863, with only 70 men against a large force of Confederates, helped defer the arrival of Gen. J. E. B. Stuart's cavalry at the Battle of Gettysburg until the afternoon of July 2. General Lee placed part of the blame for the loss of the battle on this delay.\n\nWRANGLE HILL, 6.9 m., a crossroads with an old brick house on a slight elevation, is still so called because of a feud between two early families who lived here.\n\nAt 7.6 m. is Damascus (R) a plain brick house built about 1790; it was the home of Jesse Higgins, gristmiller and enemy of the legal profession. Believing that “an honest man cannot be a lawyer,” he wrote a pamphlet called Samson Against the Philistines in which he held that arbitration could be cheaply and effectively substituted for\n\nlawsuits. (This is the thesis of the recently-formed American Arbitration Association.) When the booklet was published in 1804, Delaware lawyers bought up the edition. Higgins did not, however, need to re-issue the pamphlet, for William Duane, editor of the Washington Aurora, published it with wide resultant publicity.\n\nSouth of Damascus the road crosses Dragon Run, which flows eastward through the large Dragon Swamp to the Delaware River; this swamp harbors snapping turtles of great size.\n\nST. GEORGES, 8.8 m. (265 pop.), incorporated 1825, was laid out before 1730 at what was then the head of navigation on St. Georges Creek. A tavern stood here in 1735 and a King's Highway was officially laid out through the village in 1762; travelers stopping overnight often complained of the noise made by the wild ducks in the marshes along the creek.\n\nThe brick Sutton House (private), corner of the Delaware City road and US 13 (L), built about 1800, was the home of Dr. James M. Sutton, who, seeing the results of spreading marl on barren land, imported the first commercial lime to the region and built a kiln on the southern side of the canal. The house, with a typical low kitchen wing at right angles, and a brick-floored kitchen shed, is still owned and occupied by the Sutton family.\n\nThe CHESAPEAKE AND DELAWARE CANAL is crossed in the village on a towering steel lift bridge visible within a five-mile radius. This sea-level canal is an important link in the Intracoastal Waterway, cutting 14 miles across the isthmus of the Delmarva Peninsula from the Delaware River on the E. to Back Creek, an arm of Chesapeake Bay, on the W. Owned and operated by the Federal Government, it is toll-free. Eventually all but the largest ships will be able to use this waterway, which shortens the route between Philadelphia and Baltimore from 420 miles — around Cape Charles — to 104. Goods valued at $50,000,000 passed through the canal in 1935, in spite of the shallow 12-foot channel, many curves, frequent slides in the Deep Cut, and the swift currents caused by the tidal variance between the two bays. Yacht traffic has become very heavy since the removal of the locks, especially in fall and spring, when travel is at its height to and from Florida through the intracoastal route.\n\nThe history of the canal goes back to early Colonial times. The creation of this waterway was predicted as early as 1661 by Augustine\n\nHerman, proprietor of Bohemia Manor, in a letter to Vice Director Beekman:\n\n“For the Minquaskil and the aforesaid Bohemia River run there within a league from each other, from where we shall in time have communication with each other by water, which may serve as encouragement to the inhabitants of New-Netherland.”\n\nIn 1679-80 Dankers and Sluyter, Dutch Labadist missionaries touring the colonies, suggested the value of a waterway across this narrow isthmus. Thereafter from time to time numerous plans were made and various courses suggested. In 1786 a group of men including James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, and Benjamin Rush met in Wilmington to consider canal plans, but little was done until 1799, when Maryland chartered the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Co., with capital stock of $500,000, and appointed a board of commissioners to work with Delaware and Pennsylvania authorities. Work was started in 1804 but ceased because of financial troubles. Promotion became active in 1823, and that year digging commenced in earnest.\n\nFrom the time the C. and D. Canal was completed (1829) until the Government bought it in 1919, and turned it into a sea-level channel (1927), three locks maintained two different water levels above tidewater. One set of locks, built of stone, was at St. Georges, whence the lower level went E. four miles to Delaware City, and the upper, eight miles W. to Chesapeake City, Md., two towns that developed with the canal. Delaware City hoped to rival Philadelphia as a port, but its grandiose dreams did not consider the possibilities of railroads, and what they might do to inland water traffic.\n\nFor some distance E. of St. Georges the canal route followed the bed of St. Georges Creek which has broad marshes beside it; accordingly it was necessary to build a high bank along the north side of the channel — to hold in the water and to serve as a towpath on which mules could plod, dragging barges and sailing vessels through the water. In the excavation of the canal many Irishmen as well as Negroes were employed, all working with picks and shovels and similar hand equipment. Many of them died of malaria, and of communicable diseases that spread from them to the nearby countryside.\n\nIn 1829 the new canal, which had cost $2,200,000, was formally opened with a great celebration. At first its prosperity seemed assured.\n\nRevenues in 1831 were as high as $2,600 a week. Many parts of the East got their first cheap coal by barges that came down the Susquehanna River and canals to Chesapeake Bay and thence through the C. and D. Canal to Delaware City, where steam tugs would take them in tow to Philadelphia and other ports. Log rafts of great length passed through constantly; at a lock it was necessary to divide such a raft into small sections, which were passed through one at a time.\n\nThe old canal had a life of its own. Barge captains saluted each other with musical blasts from horns, while their wives hanging out the wash on clothes-lines rigged abaft the deck house called greetings to passing friends; barge householding included the keeping of chickens and even pigs. Showboats from the Chesapeake Bay circuit sometimes tied up at canal towns, and many floating emporiums traveled leisurely from place to place selling tinware, dress goods, steel traps, and other odds and ends.\n\nCompetition from the railroads started almost as soon as the canal was opened, and when in 1832 the New Castle and French-town R.R. substituted steam engines for horses on the passenger haul across the neck of the Peninsula, a line of passenger barges undertook the same job through the canal. The little railroad was soon ruined by competition from the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore R.R. Passenger boat, and later overnight steamer, service between Philadelphia and Baltimore was maintained until the 1920's.\n\nFiddler's Bridge, 10.1 m., now a double structure of solid concrete spanning Scott's Run, was once a narrow plank affair with swamp trees meeting densely overhead, making a dark and gloomy place. According to tradition, a demented Negro fiddler, who used to sit on the bridge rail and play doleful tunes, one night fell off and was drowned. For generations it has been believed that if a person stands on the bridge precisely at midnight and drops a coin into the water, slow, wistful notes of a violin will come from the shadows. Occasional pranks, with a real fiddler hidden in the swamp, have kept the tradition alive.\n\nListon Range, 10.8 m., is a tall black lighthouse (L). Standing four miles from the Delaware River, it is a range light by which pilots lay their courses.\n\nMACDONOUGH, 13.2 m. (20 pop.), formerly The Trap, is the birthplace of Commodore Thomas Macdonough (1783-1825),\n\ncalled the Hero of Lake Champlain because of his victory during the Battle of Plattsburg, Sept. 11, 1814.\n\nThe Macdonough House (private), where he was born is a plain two-and-one-half story structure (R), part brick and part frame, painted white and in good condition; the porch does not belong to the early years. Nearby is a family graveyard enclosed by a brick wall.\n\nThomas Macdonough entered the Navy as a midshipman at the age of 17, serving under Stephen Decatur on the Mediterranean and being promoted for bravery and ability. In Liverpool in 1810, while in the merchant service, he was seized by a British gang in one of the impressment outrages that helped to bring on the War of 1812. That night he escaped under fire to his own ship, vowing to make England remember her treatment of an American sailor. He reentered the Navy in 1812 and was given command of a small fleet on Lake Champlain. His opportunity for revenge came when, aboard his flagship, the Saratoga, he managed by clever planning to defeat the British, who outnumbered him in ships and men. This victory following Perry's on Lake Erie in 1812, stopped the enemy invasion from Canada. Congress presented him with a gold medal and the thanks of the country, and promoted him to the rank of captain, then the highest rank in the Navy. In 1815 the General Assembly of Delaware provided that a portrait of him be painted by Thomas Sully; it hangs in the Governor's office in the Legislative Hall at Dover (see below).\n\nAt 14.6 m. the dual roadways spread apart to swing in a wide curve across the marshes and channel of Drawyers Creek, which is typical of the twisting tidal creeks that flow into the Delaware River and Bay. At points on such streams where fastlands came down to navigable water there were formerly many landings for the loading and unloading of farm products and supplies, but they have disappeared owing to the development of railroads and paved roads, and the progressive filling up of the streams with silt washed from fields where forests once stood. The marshes have also been drying up, and it is now only on storm tides that the boats of the fall railbird hunters can be punted through the thickening sedge. Until recent years this marsh and the Appoquinimink marsh (see below) were famous among these sportsmen.\n\nThe name Drawyers probably came from the “drayers” hauling produce to the creek in the late 17th century.\n\nOld Drawyers Presbyterian Church (R), 14.9 m. (grounds and\n\ncemetery always open; church usually closed except for Sun. services at 3 E.S.T. in June, July, and Aug.), on a rise overlooking the creek valley, is one of the finest in Delaware.\n\nThis brick structure, built in 1773 on the site of a wooden church (1711) called Appoquinimy, is noted for its simple and dignified Georgian beauty. The architects and builders were Robert May and Co. of London, who built several notable houses in nearby Odessa as well as in Philadelphia and elsewhere. The building has beautiful lines and proportions; the fenestration and the simple lines of the cornice exhibit the architects’ fine sense of scale and the delicate paneling of the doors and shutters, the skill of the craftsmen. The bricks, now covered with ivy, were burned on the farm of Robert Meldrum, an early member of the congregation. Altered only slightly inside, the building is kept in repair by the Friends of Old Drawyers, a society composed largely of descendants of Colonial members.\n\nIt is entered through a pedimented doorway with engaged fluted columns. The interior is painted white, as are the pew stalls, whose tops are mahogany-stained; each pew has a number cut in the wood. Above the pulpit is a golden dove and an ornamental canopy. Pews and pulpit were remodeled in 1833. There are no choir stalls but immediately in front of the pulpit is a box in which sat the precentor with his tuning fork to give the pitch for hymns sung without instrumental accompaniment. The slave gallery runs around three sides of the room. There is no chimney; when stoves were used the stovepipes passed through the ceiling and loft to the roof.\n\nWeekly services were discontinued in 1861, but have recently been revived during the summer beginning with the first Sunday in June (Clover Sunday), the important annual occasion at the church. Then the rolling farmland and soft green marsh is at its best and the clover fields are in full bloom. Also in bloom then is nearly a mile of pink rambler-roses stretching along the whitewashed highway fences from the church northward along the dual highway. Between the morning and afternoon services many visitors spread picnic dinners on the lawn under the ancient cedars.\n\nThe Presbyterian influence, emanating from both the first and the present church, was felt for miles around. Congregations in St. Georges, Middletown, Port Penn, and Odessa are all offshoots of Old Drawyers.\n\nWhen in 1777 the British were advancing toward Washington's\n\ncamp near Stanton, Dr. Thomas Read, first pastor of the new church, drew maps that enabled the Americans to evacuate the section and avoid fighting until the Battle of Brandywine.\n\nODESSA, 16.2 m. (52 alt., 385 pop.), important enough in the past to have several of the finest old brick houses in the State, now has almost no activity except a cannery, a bank, and the office of a small f"
