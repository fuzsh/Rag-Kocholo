        "text": "Irene and Jeremy have had quite the whirlwind of different experiences for each baby, and Gabriel was no different!\n\nIrene had had a c-section with her first baby due to breech presentation and a bicornate uterus. She reached out with her second baby for doula services, and she at that time had a successful VBAC. Her second birth was long and hard work for Irene, so now, this time, she was hoping for a different outcome for her third.\n\nAt 38 weeks 2 days, Irene called me at 2:45 p.m. that her water had broken and she was starting to have regular contractions. This was already leaps and bounds ahead of her \"timeline\" from last time. I started getting myself and my stuff ready as I had an hour's drive to Spencer.\n\nIrene texted me that contractions were getting more regular, but she was coping well! I arrived at Jeremy's parent's house as that, where they were staying after her water broke to be close to the hospital. They had let the doctor know that her water had broken and that they were going to labor at home for a while. Irene was walking sideways up the steps and could not talk through each contraction yet, but they were coming about every 3 minutes. Irene was also GBS positive but had chosen to follow an alternative protocol that was a more \"watch and wait.\" Irene was able to check her cervix and felt that the baby was still pretty high and not engaged. I suggested flying cowgirl with my peanut ball to help the baby come down. Irene lay on one side until a little after 5 o'clock and then switched to the other until about 5:30 p.m. While lying on her right side, contractions seemed to slow to about 5-6 minutes. When she turned to the other side, contractions seemed to pick up and soon became much more intense! When 30 minutes was almost up on her left side, Irene had to breathe through them, and we asked Jeremy for more support. She then got up, stood by the stairs, and swayed back and forth. I was able to provide some counterpressure for her. She decided she wanted to shower and clean up more after her water had broken. She got out of the shower around 5:40, and Jeremy informed me that she was ready to go to the hospital as things were increasingly getting intense. She had also gone to the bathroom and noticed some more bloody show. I texted Dr. Keith and let him know we would be heading in, and Jeremy also let the OB unit know.\n\nWe arrived at the Spencer Hospital at 5:54 p.m., and on our walk into labor and delivery, Irene had to stop several times and breathe through intense contractions. She was able to lean on Jeremy while I was able to provide counterpressure. Walking down the labor and delivery hall, we saw Dr. Keith waiting happily for us in the doorway. He escorted us to the room, and we met the nurse while he talked. The nurse came in and attempted 2 IVs with no success while Irene was standing and swaying, leaning on the end table. Jeremy was able to be right by her and rub her back as she had to cope with contractions. I set up the lights, diffuser, and music, and we left the beautiful daylight coming in through the big windows.\n\nWhile the nurse was working on her IV, I had Irene place her leg on the stool and lean into a lunging position while she stood and swayed. She was able to do this on one side and then the other. She soon continued to have a growing intensity in contractions, and she was ready to get in the shower while waiting for a paramedic to put her IV in. She emptied her bladder as contractions got intense on the toilet, and then she was able to move to the shower at 6:38 p.m. She wanted to sit on a birth ball under the shower water. This was very helpful to her, and with each contraction, she continued to moan her baby down. She soon became vocal about wanting relief and talking about pain medication. Jeremy was fantastic in reminding Irene that she could do this, which is what her body was made to do. Irene also still did not have an IV at this point, so pain medication wasn't an option yet. Right at this time, the paramedic came, introduced himself, and quickly placed the IV while Irene was in the shower, still laboring on the birth ball. At this point, the tub was almost full, and Jeremy and I encouraged Irene to try the tub before the epidural as she was hoping to labor in the tub last.\n\nAt 6:42, Jeremy assisted Irene into the tub. This provided her with some relief, and Irene could continue breathing. After 2 contractions in the tub, Irene began to yell, “ I have to push!\" Jeremy stayed right by her side and remained so calm and encouraging. As Irene was close, I pulled the staff assist chord so that more nurses could come in. A few nurses assisted her out of the tub and to the bed at 6:48 p.m. Once on the bed, Irene went to their hands and knees, and her body started pushing. They called Dr. Keith to come to the bedside, and she was getting close.\n\nDr. Keith quickly arrived and sat on the edge of the bed behind Irene. On the next contraction, Irene pushed, and we saw meconium and soon a little baby bum! The baby was breech! Dr. Keith is breech trained, so he said calmly. \"Okay, guys, the baby is breech; prepare for a breech delivery!\"\n\nThe nurses called for extra staff to enter the room, and I began taking pictures and videos. Irene was fully prepared to do a vaginal breech with her first baby but had no options providers at the time. She told me that she wasn't scared and trusted her body!\n\nOnce the baby was discovered breech, Dr. Keith waited patiently as at first on the leg delivered, then most of the body. One foot was still hung up, so he did one-time positioning, and the other leg quickly came. Shortly after, one arm, the other, and the head immediately followed! She had done it! A vaginal breech delivery!\n\n6:52 p.m. Gabriel was here!\n\nAfter some stimulation and a short time, Gabriel began to cry! He was passed through Irene's legs and she was able to hold him to her chest with the chord still pulsing. The excitement in the room was unmatched! Irene and Jeremy are taking in the new soul and praying blessings over Gabriel's life.\n\nIrene describes this birth as redemptive and healing after a c-section and tough prior birth. She was absolutely amazing and so well educated on different variations of birth, that when she was found to have a surprise breech baby, she didn’t panic and knew what to do. It was an incredible delivery, and I am SO blessed to have witnessed such strength! Thank you again, Irene and Jeremy, for taking me along on your pregnancy and delivery journey.\n\nWelcome to the world, Mr. Kolter!\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Kala was one of my first ever doula clients for the birth of her first son, Kade. Kala’s first pregnancy and delivery wasn’t exactly easy. She developed preeclampsia at 32 weeks, and ended with a 3 day long induction, and postpartum hemorrhage. It was quite an experience to say the least. Kala had now been planning for the delivery of her second baby. She choose to work with the Flourish midwives and plan for a birth center delivery for this pregnancy. She also worked with a chiropractor and cared for her body, hoping to prevent preeclampsia this time around.\n\nAt Kala’s 36 weeks appointment, her blood pressure was slightly elevated above her normal range, but not yet within the preeclampsia range. So Kala tried to increase her protein and electrolytes over the following week. Kala also started to have frequent Braxton Hicks and signs that her body was preparing for labor. At her 37 week appointment, her blood pressure was back to her normal range! However, at 38 weeks, her blood pressure was elevated into preeclampsia range, so her midwives sent blood work to confirm. Kala hung around Sioux Falls and got some accupuncture while she waited for her lab results. Around 3:30pm, the decision was made that Kala should go to the hospital to be triaged for preeclampsia.\n\nIn triage, Kala’s blood pressure remained elevated and the recommended plan from the hospital’s on-call midwife was for an induction that day. This wasn’t the birth-center birth that she was dreaming of, but she remained positive throughout the entire experience. Kala’s husband had just taken a truck load to Nebraska that morning, so he wouldn’t be able to make it to Sioux Falls until late into the evening. Kala and her midwife decided to wait to start the induction until 8pm just to ensure that Kyle would be there before things picked up.\n\nAt 8:00 pm, Kala had cervidil placed to start her induction. She was 1cm dilated at this point. I sent Kala some ideas of stretches to do with her nurses until Kyle got there. She had great nurses who knew spinning babies techniques and helped her do the miles circuit, forward leaning inversions, and the side-lying release. Around 9:30 pm, Kala was starting to feel crampy with the cervidil and decided to try and rest while she could. A little after 12:00 am, Kyle made it to the hospital and got settled in. They both tried to get a little more rest before things got crazy.\n\nAnd boy, did things get crazy!\n\nAt 2:51 am, I got a text that said Kala woke up a bit ago with intense contractions, had bloody show and was going to get in the tub. At 3:03 am, Kala called me that she was getting in the tub and her contractions were intense. She felt ready for me to head over. I asked her if she would be willing to get checked to see where things were at, but I got up and started getting ready, knowing I was probably going to head up to Sioux Falls at this point. At 3:12 am, I got a call from Kyle saying, “the nurse says you need to get up here fast”. He also let me know at 3:29 am that Kala was 5 cm dilated.\n\nI left my house at 3:31 am to head to Sioux Falls, and at 3:51am I got a call from Kyle, “Don’t speed, he’s here”.\n\nKolter Isaiah\n\nBorn July 18 at 3:45am\n\nWhile Kala was in the tub, she started having intense pelvic pressure that felt like she could push. Her nurses and midwife helped move her to the bed where she labored on her side for a few contractions. At this point, her baby’s heart rate was starting to dip and the nurse was having trouble hearing his heart rate. The midwife placed a fetal scalp electrode to monitor his heart rate more accurately. With the next contraction, Kala had the overwhelming urge to push and Kolter was born.\n\nI continued up to Sioux Falls since I was already on my way. I talked with Kyle and Kala about how everything went and apologized for not making it. Kolter was ready to come and wasn’t waiting for me. Thankfully, he had waited for his dad to get to the hospital before he made his arrival!\n\nEven though I missed the delivery, it was a joy to work with Kala again and be a small part of this redemptive and quick birth, after her long induction the first time. Kala is so strong and truly showed that in this birth story. I’m so thankful to have gotten to know Kala better and to witness her love and passion for her sweet boys!\n\nAnother beautiful NWIBN baby girl is here!\n\nI was over the moon to be among the first to know that Makena was pregnant and to be asked to be a part of her delivery. Makenna was already well educated and had learned about all things physiologic birth. She knew all the options and tools available to her during the process. She kept herself active throughout pregnancy with walks, stretches, seeing the chiropractor, eating her dates, and drinking red raspberry leaf tea.\n\nAt 39 weeks pregnant, Makenna was feeling a lot of lower pressure and frequent Braxton Hicks and was curious if she was dilated at all. She had her doctor check and she was 3-4cm dilated 59% effaced and already 0 station. She opted for a membrane sweep and waited to see what happened. Not much changed throughout the day, but before bed, Makenna felt her Braxton Hicks seemed a bit stronger. She was still able to fall asleep for a bit though. Around 3 am, Makenna woke up to intense contractions, mostly in her back. She tried doing a few stretches and then filled up her tub at home for some relief. The tub only helped a little bit as the contractions were already strong and the pain in her back was intense. She decided to go to the hospital to use their tub instead. She arrived at the hospital just before 6 am and was 5cm dilated, 50% effaced, and 0 station. I got to the hospital at 6:45 am and Makenna was in the tub lying back holding Brett’s hand. We quickly caught up on how things were going and soon after, her doctor came in to see how things were going. Makenna was feeling ready for a cervical check at 7:15 am, and she was 6cm, 100% effaced, and +1 station. We were so excited about how much progress she already made!\n\nI had Makenna lean over Brett while standing for a few contractions and then move to the toilet for a few contractions as well. After this, she got back into the tub. Makenna's back labor was still intense and it felt best laying back in the tub. I had her move to her hands and knees to help take the pressure off her back but overall it was too intense for Makenna to stay in that position. Makenna opted to have some IV fentanyl to help give her some temporary relief from the back labor and help her relax more in the tub. She stayed on top of her breathing and never lost control, despite the growing intensity of labor. After a while longer in the tub, I had Makenna stand while holding onto Brett for a contraction or two. After the first couple of contractions standing up, she tried to check to feel the baby’s head but all she felt was a big bag of water. She asked if she could have her water broken to help things move a bit faster. I told her, “If you have that big of a bulging bag of water, it’s going to break with one of your next contractions, maybe you could wait a little bit”. As if on cue, with her next contraction, her water broke. We decided to move to the bed to do a few side-lying positions.\n\nAt 9:15 am Makenna asked to be checked and was now 7cm. Makenna was getting tired and the back labor, despite position changes, wasn’t letting up so Makenna was feeling ready for an epidural. She got another dose of fentanyl to tie her over till the epidural was ready and got back in the tub while she waited for her fluids to finish and for the anesthesiologists to get there.\n\nAt 9:45 am the epidural was in, but it was barely working. Makenna’s toes were numb but that was about it. She was still feeling every contraction but stuck laying on her back in bed hoping that the epidural would start working so that we could keep moving positions.\n\nAt 10:15 am Makenna was checked again and was 8cm dilated. Her doctor noticed that her cervix was becoming swollen so they gave her some IV Benadryl. Makenna's epidural was starting to take some effect but it still really wasn’t giving much relief, so the anesthesiologist came back and tried a bolus dose. When that didn’t work, they had to adjust the epidural tube by pulling it back and giving lidocaine through the epidural. After nearly two hours, the epidural started to bring some relief to Makenna.\n\nWe were now able to do some positions in the bed, moving side to side with the peanut ball while Makenna rested. At 12:05 pm, Makenna was checked and was 8cm and her cervix was now very swollen. Her doctor did some ice massage to the cervix and we continued with side-lying positions. We continued with intermittent ice massage over the next hour and after that, Makenna was 9cm. Her doctor tried to feel the position of the baby and thought she was in a good position. We crossed our fingers and hoped she was. We moved to a high throne position for a bit and then went back onto her right side. After a few contractions on the right, her baby’s heart rate had a large dip so we moved back to the throne position. The baby also had a heart rate dip in that position, so we then moved to her left side. Thankfully her baby seemed to like this position, so we kept Makenna on her left side for a while, making sure the baby was recovering well. After about 40 minutes on her left side, we decided to try hands and knees but once again, her baby didn’t seem to enjoy this position either and we had to move back to her left side again. At 4 pm, Makenna’s doctor checked her and she was still 9cm but the baby was +2 station. We could see the sweet baby girl's hair when her doctor checked her because she was SO low! Her doctor decided that she should give a few pushes a try to see if she could push past the last bit of the cervix. With her first push, Makenna moved her baby and we were already seeing baby girl’s head peeking out! With just 24 minutes of pushing, Makenna delivered her baby girl sunny-side-up!\n\nBrooklyn Rae\n\nJune 29 at 4:24 pm\n\n7lbs 15oz\n\nWhen Brooklyn was born, the song “Goodness of God” came on. It was a perfect moment to celebrate this sweet gift from the Lord. He truly is SO GOOD! This birth story wasn’t exactly what Makenna envisioned but she took every turn with grace knowing all her options with a birth team that supported her wishes.\n\nI still am in awe of Makenna's ability to push a sunny-side-up baby in just 24 minutes! This is seriously unheard of for a first-time mom! I couldn’t be more proud of her power, patience, and fierce love for her baby girl.\n\nHappy birthday to Jon Virgil!\n\n​\n\nLast February, I had the honor of working with Jackie during her third pregnancy and I couldn’t wait to be a part of another birth with them. Jackie and I began planning and preparing for another unmedicated, low-intervention labor.\n\nAbout 30 weeks into Jackie’s pregnancy, she had a follow-up ultrasound that found a mass in her baby’s chest/abdomen. This left Jackie with many unanswered questions and worries throughout her third trimester. Jackie started working with maternal-fetal medicine specialists and transferred care to a larger hospital for specialized care for her and the baby. As much as Jackie desired a low-intervention birth, she also knew her pregnancy was a special case and there was no way to avoid interventions completely. Follow-up ultrasounds were still unclear as to what exactly this mass was, so Jackie and Joe had to wait and pray throughout their third trimester until their baby boy was delivered to have answers on exactly what was going on and what the plan of care after delivery would be.\n\nJackie was still able to have a vaginal delivery so she made sure to be prepping her body with lots of movement and stretches. Jackie was hoping to go into labor naturally but the MFM doc wanted to induce at 39 weeks to make sure Jackie could be in the larger hospital, which was 2 hours from her house. Even though this wasn’t Jackie's first choice, she understood and felt confident her body would respond well to an induction with this being her 4th baby.\n\nOn the morning of June 26th, Jackie and Joe headed in for her induction. At 6:30 am, Jackie was 2cm and 50% effaced and they placed a dose of cytotec to get things started. Soon after, Jackie began to have some cramping and mild contractions. She decided to try resting after a not-so-great night of sleep. At 9 am the maternal-fetal medicine doctor came in to check Jackie again. She was now 3 cm and 60% effaced. Her doctor performed a membrane sweep to help encourage things along. Not long after that, Jackie began having manageable, regular contractions, so I started planning to get to her soon.\n\nI got to the hospital around noon. Jackie was still having contractions but they weren't too strong yet. We started with balancing stretches to help Jackie's ligaments loosen and help the baby descend. At 12:40 pm, Jackie was checked again and she was 4cm dilated. Her doctor then gave her the option to start pitocin or break her water to help contractions pick up. Jackie decided to start with a little bit of pitocin. The pitocin was started and we continued with different positions to keep things moving. The pitocin intensified contractions quickly and Jackie soon needed to stop to breathe through them. She tried every position I suggested: squatting, side-lying, the birth ball, walking, lunging, and more.\n\nA couple of hours into the pitocin being started, Jackie was feeling ready to get this over with and meet her baby. She decided she wanted her water broken to hopefully speed things up. Her doctor was busy in the clinic so we waited till her nurse practitioner could come in and break her water. At 3:50 pm, Jackie was 4 to 5cm dilated and her waters were broken. Things intensified quickly after her waters were broken. Contractions were coming quicker and stronger. Jackie leaned over the birth ball on the bed and I offered counter pressure to her hips as her baby was descending into the pelvis. Jackie then sat on the toilet for a few contractions and the pressure was intense! She moved to the bed on her hands and knees and the urge to push was undeniable. With just one more contraction, Jackie delivered her baby boy!\n\nJon Virgil\n\nBorn June 26 at 5:17 pm\n\nJon was able to come to Jackie’s chest for just a couple of seconds before he had to be taken to the warmer to assist with his breathing. A few minutes later, he was taken to the NICU. Being separated from your baby so soon is heartbreaking. Joe was initially in a bit of shock after Jon was born, but after the adrenaline wore off, Joe went to the NICU to be with Jon and I stayed with Jackie till she could leave the unit and get to the NICU.\n\nJon was in the NICU for 2 weeks to assist with his breathing and run tests to understand more about the mass in his chest. The Mass was identified as a pulmonary sequestration\n\na benign congenital mass in the chest. Jon is home now doing well and will have surgery to remove the mass within the next few months.\n\nJackie is a fierce mama for her babies and Jon is lucky to have such an amazing support system. Jackie and Joe, thank you for letting me be a part of your pregnancy and delivery journey for a second time!\n\nIt is always so special to be welcomed back into the birth space for a second time. I had the privilege to be a part of Madison and Zach’s delivery of their first baby in 2022. Madison messaged me this fall saying that baby Kinny #2 was on the way, and I couldn't wait to be a small part of this baby’s birth story.\n\nMadison's first delivery was a long induction with many interventions and a scary epidural experience. This time the hope was to go into labor naturally, have minimal interventions, and avoid the epidural. Madison stayed active throughout her pregnancy by going on frequent walks, doing stretches, and chasing around a toddler. She also tried to snack on dates and drink red raspberry leaf tea in hopes of helping her uterus and cervix become favorable throughout her pregnancy.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Madison's delivery, she had a few bouts of prodromal labor. A couple of times we got prepared for labor to start but each time things ended up fizzling out. At her 40-week appointment, Madison decided to have a cervical exam and a membrane sweep in hopes of starting labor. A few mild early labor symptoms started and fizzled out, so again we waited. A few days later on Monday, the 17th, Madison had another appointment where she opted for another membrane sweep as a last-ditch effort to avoid an induction a couple of days later. That evening, mild contractions started but eventually Madison was able to get some sleep. Tuesday morning, she woke up with more cramping and some bloody show. We were hopeful that the second membrane sweep was going to work after all! Throughout the day, Madison continued to have mild contractions but they still were not very intense or close together. Evening rolled around, so Madison and Zach were going to try to sleep a bit. She was hoping labor would kick in during the night, otherwise it would be induction day in the morning.\n\nAt 11:30 pm, Madison called me that there would be no sleeping for her. Contractions were more intense and consistently 5 minutes apart. She was ready to head to the hospital. We were so excited she was going into labor just a few hours before her scheduled induction time. Zach and Madison headed to the hospital, and I had them keep me in the loop, and call me when they needed me. At 2:45 am, Madison called me that she was 4cm when she checked in and things were picking up. I headed over to the hospital to meet them. Madison was in the tub when I got there breathing through contractions. After a while in the tub, Madison was ready to try something else, so she got out and I had her do standing lunges on each side through a few contractions. Her ontractions slowly started to space out and become less frequent. Since Madison's body was giving her some more breaks we decided she should rest while she could. I got Madison set up with the peanut ball and I headed home as well to hopefully catch a little more sleep. At 5:30 am, she updated me that contractions were still spaced out but were growing in intensity. The plan was for her doctor to come check her in an hour and go from there.\n\nAt 6:30am, Madison was 6cm and 100% effaced! She was making such amazing progress! Madison ate some breakfast, bounced on the ball, and walked the halls to keep things progressing. Around 8 am, she was ready for me to head back to the hospital. Madison was back in the tub when I got there. Contractions were intensifying but Madison was having nice breaks in between. After a while in the tub, she was ready to get out and try some different positions. She started on the ball where the nurses could monitor the baby's heart rate and her contractions. After getting out of the tub, contractions started slowing even more to about 7-10 minutes apart. The intensity during contractions was still there but the breaks were getting longer and longer. After some time being monitored, we decided to try some hands and knees in the bed and do a side-lying release. Contractions were still not picking up in frequency so Madison was feeling ready to have a cervical exam and was considering having her doctor break her water to get things going again.\n\nAt 10:15 am, Madison was 7cm dilated, 100% effaced and the baby was very low at +1 station. Both Madison and her doctor thought breaking her water would be a good idea at this point. We finished up our side-lying releases and Madison got back in the tub knowing that there was a good chance the contractions were gonna start picking up. It didn't take long at all for contractions to pick up to every 3-4 minutes. Madison tried her best to relax in the tub through contractions but the intensity was growing and it was hard to not tense up through them. She breathed beautifully through contractions working so hard to stay in control. After a little over an hour in the tub, Madison started feeling an increase in pelvic pressure and was having small urges to push through contractions. Zach and I helped Madison out of the tub and onto the bed and called the nurses to come in. Minutes later, Madison’s doctor was there and performed a cervical exam, Madison was 9cm dilated. She was so close! Madison worked so hard to breathe through a few more contractions till the urge to push was completely overwhelming and there was no stopping it. Madison’s doctor was back to do another check, and she was complete at 11:43 am. Madison pushed on her side for a couple of pushes and then felt she needed to try something else. She moved to her hands and knees and each push moved her baby so well. With just 10 minutes of pushing, Madison delivered her baby girl!\n\nTenley Rose\n\nJune 19, 2024 at 11:53 am\n\n8lbs 13oz and 21 inches long\n\nMadison put in the work throughout pregnancy and had so much patience waiting for her baby girl’s arrival. Being able to be a part of both of Madison's births has been an honor, to say the least. Tenley’s birth was truly a night and day difference from her first. Every birth is beautiful, and this one was no exception. Thank you, Madison and Zach, for letting me be a small part of both of your beautiful births.\n\nWhen Chelsey and Lucas found out they were pregnant with their second child, they felt they could benefit from doula services with this birth as they were looking for suggestions with position changes and support!\n\nIn the prenatal appointments, Chelsey and Lucas soaked up all the information I had to offer! They learned about the processes of labor as well as examples of several positions to utilize and why they work.\n\nAt Chelsey’s 39-week appointment, she had a “higher than her normal” blood pressure, but after a discussion with her midwife, she decided to watch and wait. Over the weekend, Chelsey had some off-and-on contractions and even one point where we thought it might be the real deal. On Saturday, June 15, she texted me that she would start timing contractions as she felt they were coming more regularly. After several hours, her contractions were still consistently coming about every 10 minutes but not growing in intensity. She decided to try to sleep and see what the night would bring! In the morning, she texted me and told me everything fizzled out and it was just a false alarm.\n\nMonday at 11:01 a.m., I was headed to another client's induction when Chelsey texted me from her 40-week midwife appointment. The text said, “Hello! Blood pressure is still elevated, so we have decided to induce versus triage…”. I immediately called and informed her I was heading to another client's induction. We talked back and forth, and since she was delivering in Sioux Falls, we knew we had a couple of hours until things would start moving along. I also called Kyla and informed her that Chelsey was going to be induced, and she said that she was able to go to her and Lucas’s birth if needed! What a benefit it is to be a team! Lucas kept me in the loop with updates, and at 1:30 pm, Chelsey checked into Labor and Delivery. She was checked and was 3cm dilated, and the baby was at -2 station. The midwife gave them several different options of things to do for induction of labor, and ultimately, at 2:10 pm, they were going to break her water. After her water broke, Chelsey had to lie down to be monitored for 20 minutes and then could get up and move. I let Kyla know that they would be ready for support soon! We started a group text between Lucas, Chelsey, Kyla, and me. At this point, Kyla got on the road to Sioux Falls!\n\nI got to Chelsey and Lucas around 4 pm. Walking into the labor room, Chelsey was lying in the large birth pool in the corner of the room holding on to Lucas’s hand through contractions. I quickly introduced myself and asked them what was most important to them about this birth and how I could support them the most. Chelsey and Lucas desired to have suggestions for positions, have emotional support and advocate for Chelsey’s choices. I began setting up the room with lights and set the speaker up with Chelsey’s birth playlist. Her contractions were coming on regularly every 4-5 minutes with growing intensity but Chelsey was coping so well through each of them, staying in control and breathing through each one. After a few more contractions in the tub, Chelsey was ready to get out and try something different. She gravitated towards the birth ball. She moved her hips between contractions and leaned into Lucas who was sitting in front of her through contractions while I offered sacral counter pressure. After a few more contractions like this, Chelsey was ready to move again! She and Lucas were great with changing positions to keep her pelvis moving. Chelsey wanted to get back in the tub so the nurse warmed the water for her. Chelsey leaned back through a few contractions and then tried to breathe through some of them on her hands and knees, but overall, that position didn’t feel right. Chelsey moved back to lying back through her contractions. She stayed like this through a handful of contractions, and then she was ready to move again. Lucas helped her out of the tub and I had Chelsey stand while holding onto Lucas for a few contractions to use gravity to her advantage. Contractions were coming closer and stronger. There was no doubt that this labor was moving along! We then decided to try sitting on the toilet for a few contractions to help relax the pelvic floor. They don’t call it the dilation station for nothing! Chelsey then wanted to lie on her side which was a position she gravitated towards in her first labor. Lucas and I switched off offering counter pressure through Chelsey’s quickly intensifying contractions. Her midwife stopped in to see how things were going and asked to check Chelsey’s cervix since she was having a lot more pressure with contractions. Chelsey was now 8cm dilated, so we knew things were close! I had Chelsey move onto her knees on the bed with the head of the bed up so that she was in a supported squat/hands and knees position. After a couple of contractions like that, I had her bring one leg up to what I like to call the “Captain Morgan” position. Chelsey instantly felt the urge to push while in this position, so she wanted to lay back down on her side if she was going to push. The next contraction was intense but the overwhelming urge to push wasn’t there anymore. Chelsey continued to work hard to stay in control as these contractions were so strong and close together, helping her get to the end of this labor. We added a peanut ball between Chelsey’s ankles to open the pelvic outlet for a contraction to help the baby descend. With just one contraction in that position, the overwhelming urge to push was back and Chelsey was ready to have this baby! We quickly moved the peanut ball and held up Chelsey’s leg. With 1 contraction, Chelsey was crowing and with just one more, her sweet baby was born!\n\nAvery Lynn\n\nBorn June 17 at 5:54 pm\n\n9lbs 1oz\n\nChelsey and Lucas were the definition of the perfect team. They took the unexpected turns of induction and a backup doula with grace. It was a joy to be added to their birth team at the last minute and to witness Chelsey’s strength.\n\nSweet baby Halle has arrived!\n\n​\n\nBeing welcomed into the birth space of people you love makes birth even more special than it already is. Throughout our years of friendship, Alyssa and I dreamed together of our birth experiences. Walking alongside Chad and Alyssa as they welcomed their second baby into the world was a huge honor.\n\nAlyssa has been a labor and delivery nurse for many years, so she was educated on her pregnancy and labor options. She was mindful of her nutrition and exercise throughout pregnancy to support her body and baby. At Alyssa’s 20-week ultrasound, her baby measured small based on her calculated due date. After some follow-up scans and talking to her doctor, Alyssa's due date was changed to reflect a more accurate due date, making baby girl measure in a normal percentile. Though this caused some anxiety at times, Alyssa was confident she knew her baby's due date was accurate and she was growing strong.\n\n​\n\nLeading up to Alyssa's due date, she had frequent Braxton Hicks contractions. We kept waiting for the day they would turn into real labor. Alyssa was patient with her body, keeping her body prepared for labor whenever it was ready to start. The day before her due date, Alyssa texted me that she was having some intense, regular contractions. She had a feeling this was the beginning of actual labor, so she decided to head to bed early, hoping to get some rest.\n\n​\n\nAt midnight Alyssa woke up to more intense contractions that she couldn’t sleep through. She continued to try to rest and relax in the bathtub throughout the rest of the night. In the morning, Alyssa texted me that it was baby day…on her due date! That morning, throughout early labor, Alyssa hung around the house with Chad, went for a walk, and did some stretching.\n\n​\n\nAround 10 am, Alyssa texted me she was ready for me to head her way to help support her. She was relaxed and calm as I walked in; she was still able to talk between contractions, but needed to stop to breathe through contractions as they came. Throughout the morning, Alyssa kept moving with various position changes as her contractions were coming closer together and growing in intensity. After a couple hours, Alyssa decided to get in the tub for some relief. After about 30 minutes, she wasn’t finding a comfortable position so she decided to try the shower instead. While in the shower, contractions picked up significantly. Alyssa began to need to moan through contractions that were coming every 2-3 minutes. After a long hot shower, Alyssa wanted to try to lie down and rest. She got settled in bed with the peanut ball and turned on her Christian Hypnobirthing app. Contractions slowed a little from how fast and intense they were in the shower, but they were still coming on strong and regular.\n\n​\n\nAfter about 45 minutes of resting, Alyssa decided to get back in the shower. Once again, her contractions started coming on quickly with a lot of strength. Alyssa started to feel quite a bit of lower pressure with contractions as her baby was moving down. We moved the birth ball into the shower so Alyssa could sit and rock on the birth ball through contractions with the warm water on her back. Alyssa was feeling like things were getting close but she also knew how long labor could take, so she didn’t want to get her hopes up too high. After another long shower, Alyssa got on her hands and knees in the bed as Chad and I offered back rubs and words of affirmation. Alyssa started to hit her breaking point. Labor was hard work and a good cry was needed.\n\n​\n\nCrying can be such a helpful release in labor, allowing all those emotions to come out. This seemed to help because labor went up another notch and the intensity of Alyssa's contractions continued to grow. Shortly after, Alyssa was feeling ready to head to the hospital so she could use the big whirlpool tub for some relief.\n\n​\n\nAround 4:15 pm, Alyssa got checked into the hospital. The nurses listened to the baby's heart rate and did a cervical exam, Alyssa was 7-8cm dilated! She was able to get into the tub, hoping to take some of the edge off of her growing contractions. Chad hopped right in the tub with her so that he could spray her back with warm water. In the tub, Alyssa was very clearly transitioning, as she had to breathe deep and moan through her contractions. Changing positions felt impossible but with some coaxing, she alternated between side-lying and hands and knees. After about an hour in the tub, Alyssa’s water broke and we all knew that now she was getting so close. Her doctor came in a few minutes later to see where things were at. He checked Alyssa's cervix while in the tub and she was 9.5cm dilated. The end was in sight!\n\n​\n\nWith just a few more contractions, Alyssa began to have the overwhelming urge to push. We all helped her out of the tub and onto the bed. At 6:10 pm, Alyssa was completely dilated and it was time to push. She gravitated to side-lying as it felt the most natural for pushing. Chad held her hands and I helped her stay in control of her breathing through the intensity of pushing. She gave each contraction everything she had and after 24 minutes, baby girl was here!\n\nHalle Wren\n\nJune 6, 2024, at 6:34 pm\n\n7lbs 4oz\n\nThe pure joy and relief in the room was palpable. Alyssa's determination and preparation paid off. Halle's birth was nothing short of beautiful. What an honor to call Chad and Alyssa dear friends and to watch Halle grow up. I will forever hold this birth close to my heart!\n\nMeredith was in the first half of her pregnancy when she inquired regarding doula services. Her and Noah were looking for some extra guidance and education throughout their first pregnancy. Her goal was to welcome her baby girl safely in an environment that is empowering and deepened her bond with her husband.\n\nMeredith prepared her body for labor by eating dates, drinking RRLT, and stayed active throughout her pregnancy. She had a fairly uncomplicated pregnancy, besides the usual discomforts nearing her due date.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to her due date, Meredith questioned if her body was going into labor, but each time her contractions would fizzle out. I reminded her to stay positive as this was her body doing all the right things preparing to go into labor.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 8 at 5:57 a.m., Meredith texted me that she had been woken up at 3:00 a.m. with contractions that were about 7-9 minutes apart and lasting for 40-50 seconds. She wasn’t able to rest with them, so she had gotten up to do some stretches and different positions. The intensity of each contraction was increasing and they were starting to take her breath away. I gave some position and relaxation suggestions she could do at home and we’d stay in touch throughout the morning.\n\nMeredith had a regular OB check-up appointment scheduled at 9:00 a.m. that morning. We discussed if she would still need to go to this appointment and overall she decided she still wanted to go to get reassured by her provider this was truly labor. Her provider performed a cervical exam and found she was 1cm dilated. She was going to go home to labor there for a while. Again, we went over more positions and circuits she could perform at home. Meredith continued to cope very well with each contraction.\n\nAt noon, the intensity had continued to increase and the contractions were coming every 5-8 minutes now. She still felt as if she was tolerating and coping well throughout early labor.\n\nAt 3:47, Meredith texted me they were going to start heading into the hospital. Contractions were about 2 minutes apart and she was beginning to moan through each one. We continued to stay in touch and she would let me know when more assistance was needed.\n\nHer contractions continued to come regularly and become even more intense. Shortly before 7, she requested I would start making my way as she was needing more assistance. I got all of my things ready and began to head her way. In the meantime, she got in the tub.\n\nI arrived at 7:20 p.m. to find Meredith was on her hands and knees in the tub and Noah was giving her a nice massage. Contractions were overwhelmingly strong, but she stayed in control of her body and breathing through each one. I quickly worked to set up the room with lights, got some music going, and essential oils diffusing.\n\nShortly before 8:00 p.m, she decided to get out of the tub and empty her bladder and then it was time for the monitors to be put back on for a while. Her provider came to the bedside to check her cervix again and she was 3cm dilated, 80% effaced, and -1 station. Slowly, but surely she was making some great change. Meredith leaned into Noah and swayed back and forth as I applied some pressure to her hips.\n\nAt 9:05 p.m., Meredith requested some IV pain medication to help take the edge off. She was becoming so tired as she had been up since 3 a.m. and working so hard throughout the day. She wanted to lay down in bed for a little bit so we decided to utilize the peanut ball and put her in an exaggerated runner’s position to encourage the baby to come through the midpelvis.\n\nThe IV pain medication helped for a short while, but Meredith then decided her body was needing some rest and requested an epidural. Her provider came to the bedside and requested to perform a cervical exam in the meantime. She was 5-6cm dilated, 100% effaced, and 0 station! What amazing progress she had made in just a couple of hours.\n\nShortly before 11:00 p.m, Meredith got up to once again empty her bladder. Once in the bathroom her contractions became VERY intense, became shaky, and she had a sudden urge to push. Just as the CRNA was walking through the door, her nurse checked her cervix to find she was now 7cm dilated! Meredith was making cervical change quickly. The CRNA got to work to place her epidural.\n\nIt didn’t take long and she was comfortable with her epidural in place. Her provider then came to the bedside to discuss breaking Meredith’s water at this time. She consented and at 11:40, she had her provider break her bag of water to continue the labor process. Her provider was going to come back to the bedside in a couple of hours to re-check her cervix. In the meantime, we all decided to get some rest.\n\nAt 1:10 a.m., her provider returned to the bedside and once again performed a cervical exam to find she had just an anterior rim of cervix left and baby had come down into a +1 station! Meredith got more comfortable again with a peanut ball in between her ankles and we allowed her to rest some more.\n\nAt 2:50 a.m., her provider returned to the bedside and she was completely dilated! It was finally time to start pushing. At 3:00 a.m., Meredith began to push. She was most comfortable pushing on her back and was making great progress with each push. I was in awe of the strength she had!\n\nAt 5:12 a.m. after just over a couple hours of pushing, their sweet baby girl was finally here! It was such a sweet moment to be a part of.\n\nLainey Joy\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\n5:12 a.m.\n\n7lbs 5oz\n\nMeredith and Noah worked flawlessly together to bring their sweet baby girl into the world. Meredith showed so much strength, determination, and control throughout her long and exhausting labor. It was such an honor to be a part of this birth!\n\nWelcome, NWIBN 100th baby! And even more special it was Ashtyn’s nephew!\n\nTabi texted me a picture of a positive pregnancy test on the morning of August 28th and said, “Shhh.” She knew that because I was booked out for doula clients so far, she had to let me know right away when she was pregnant, and I was ecstatic!\n\nTabi had had a previous c-section in 2022 because Hayes had been breech and was excited to have a VBAC this time! She knew that if a VBAC was what she really wanted, she needed to choose her care team purposefully. This led her to a midwife group in Des Moines, and she instantly felt at peace with them. As Tabi entered her third trimester, her midwife felt that this baby was breech. This was so disheartening as it was around the same time they had discovered Hayes to be breech as well. I sent her many things to encourage the baby to turn, and she scheduled an ultrasound in a few weeks to confirm positioning. She mentally worked through all her previous birth trauma and continued to do all she could to help him turn. On the day of her ultrasound, I got a text:” HE’S HEAD DOWN!” I almost cried!\n\nShe began to work preparing her body for birth by doing stretches, drinking red raspberry leaf tea, and eating dates. At 34 weeks, she found out her original birthplace she was supposed to birth was no longer an option, and she had to choose to transfer care over to a hospital facility and a completely different provider or stay with her midwife group and have a home birth. After talking through all the pros and cons, Tabi and Demry ultimately decided they felt completely safe with their midwives and opted for a home birth!\n\nAt 38 weeks and 1 day pregnant, tabi was having some irregular contractions or strong Braxton hicks that would come and go but never stay consistent or grow in intensity. This continued over a period of 24 hours, with still no change in frequency or intensity. This was around the same time several tornadoes were going through her area, and we felt maybe her uterus was irritable due to the weather. On Saturday, tabi again still had no change in contractions/Braxton hicks and went to Des Moines all day and ran errands and got a pedicure.\n\nShe texted me at 7 pm that evening that nothing had changed, and she was still fine. I encouraged her to try rest; she may have this go on for a while. I told her to bathe, relax, and then rest in a flying cowgirl position before bed. She had been resting in Flying Cowgirl for about 15 minutes and decided she was ready to go to bed. She got up to use the bathroom before falling asleep and felt a gush! She went over to the toilet and was still unsure if it was her water that had broken or not, but a few minutes later, I got a text at 9:41 that said, “I’m 99% sure my water broke.”\n\nA few minutes later, she texted me again, “I feel like I’m going to throw up; this contraction are so intense.” Hindsight 20/20: this is when I should have left to support her in labor; little did we know what was about to come.\n\nWe talked back and forth over the next 45 minutes, and she felt she was doing okay. I gave her a few positions to try and see what her contractions continued to do. At 10:30 pm, I was going to try to sleep for a little bit and encouraged her to do the same thing, as typically, first time actual labors tend to take a while. Boy was I wrong!\n\nI got a call from Demry at 11:15 pm (45 minutes later) and said, “Hey, you should probably head this way, I called the midwives, and I don’t think you will make it in time.” I jumped up and ran out the door with my stuff as I had a 3-hour drive. About 20 minutes into my drive, I called Tabi on Facetime to help her through different positions until I could get there. When she picked up the phone, she was laboring on the toilet, and I encouraged this was a great position! After several minutes on the phone, it was obvious I was not going to make it to her birth! I continued to encourage her to breathe through contractions and allow her body to relax in between. She was breathing so well and so controlled! She wasn’t panicking and was trusting her body. It was amazing!\n\nSoon, she said, “I can feel his head.” And soon, it became obvious that this baby was coming soon! Without me and without the midwife she had a small drive as well! At 12:25 a.m., Tabi was obviously bearing down, and the midwife came running into her tiny bathroom! She said calmly, “Okay, let’s go down on hands and knees.” And the baby’s head came out! The midwife waited seconds until the next contraction, and the rest of his body was born!\n\nThatcher William\n\nApril 28, 2024\n\n12:26 a. m.\n\n7lbs 7oz\n\nThatcher was born after a labor of 2 hours and 46 minutes, on the bathroom floor, into the comfort of his mother’s arms, almost completely unassisted! What a whirlwind of a birth! Tabi, I am so proud of all you overcame in getting to a space mentally to prepare for VBAC. You trusted your body and your baby and ROCKED it! I made it to Des Moines 1.5 hours after Thatcher was born and was able to help Tabi get settled postpartum after staying on Facetime throughout the drive. The first thing Tabi said was, “I can’t believe that just happened!” I am so honored to be a part of Thatcher's birth, even if it was over Facetime! What a redemptive birth story!\n\nJared and Brianna decided on a doula for the birth of their third child, I couldn’t have been more thrilled to work with them! Jared and I work together on our local town ambulance, so it was an honor to be hired by them!\n\nWith her previous two births of Lily and Walker, Brianna had chosen to get an epidural. After several negative side effects after her last epidural, I was really hoping she would be able to go completely unmedicated this time!\n\nIn the weeks leading up to her birth, she read through several books and worked on her mindset regarding how to handle contractions. She also prepared her body by eating dates, doing stretches, and drinking red raspberry leaf tea. Jared and Brianna soaked up all the information throughout all our education sessions and continued to do research of their own.\n\nWhen Brianna was 40 weeks and 4 days pregnant, she and Jared decided that she was going to try the midwife's brew to see if it would be just the push to send her into labor. She had had an appointment a few days prior and was 3-4cm dilated in the clinic. So, they planned that she would take it Sunday morning so they could spend the day with their family.\n\nBrianna texted me Sunday morning that she had finished drinking the tea around 8:00 a.m. They then spent the morning hanging out with their kids and enjoying time together.\n\nI checked in around noon to see how things were going, and Brianna said she had been having some of the GI side effects, but overall was feeling well! They had gone on a walk, and while on the walk she noticed a few larger contractions, so we kept our fingers crossed that it was a sign labor was going to kick in.\n\nAt 2:00 p.m., she texted and called me and informed me that her contractions were about 4-5 minutes apart and lasting 30-40 seconds. She and Jared decided they would head to the hospital since it was a bit of a drive. Brianna was coping well, and everyone was so excited!\n\nI got all my stuff ready and decided to leave my house at 3:00, to give them time to settle.\n\nWhen I arrived around 3:30 p.m., Brianna had just gotten a cervical check and was 6cm dilated and contracting approximately every 3 minutes. The nursing staff soon started antibiotics as she was GBS positive. Brianna would have to stop and breathe through contractions during this time but was laughing and joking in between. I set up the room with lights, and galaxy lights were already going. Brianna had sent me some songs for a praise and worship playlist for the birth as “Praise and Worship music was her jam!” After this was all setup, I assisted Brianna into a standing position where she could sway with Jared with her leg propped up on a chair to encourage the baby through the mid pelvis. In this position, we were able to utilize gravity, and I was able to do counter pressure while she got to talk and laugh with Jared. It was such a beautiful worship-filled environment! After doing this on each side, I encouraged Brianna to use the toilet to empty her bladder and sit, straddling it to encourage further dilation. Jared and I helped her to get comfortable and then stepped out to give them privacy.\n\nBrianna was able to stay this way through several contractions, but it was obvious that the contractions were getting more intense. While they were in the bathroom, I got the tub filled up, and Brianna was ready to get in.\n\nOnce Brianna was in the tub, she was able to relax and continued to be in complete control of her breathing. I suggested she move into a lunging position and complete it on both sides to keep opening the mid-pelvis. Soon, Jared and I noticed Brianna had slipped into “labor land.” She was so comfortable in the tub so we stayed there as long as she possibly could! I set up a fan, and the nurse got a cold washcloth to keep her cool. Throughout this time, we continued to have Brianna eat and drink to keep her energy up.\n\nAfter being in the tub for approximately an hour, Brianna began to make noise that made us think she was getting close to delivery! During the hour in the tub, the doctor also came in and was just in and out quietly in the room. We all encouraged Brianna that it was time to get out of the tub and move to the bed, and Brianna agreed. With Jared’s assistance, she was able to stand while I helped her dry off and walk to bed. The doctor offered a cervical check, and at 5:36 p.m. Brianna was 9.5 cm dilated! After this check, I had her go onto hands and knees lunge while leaning over the bed. She was able to squeeze Jared’s hands, and I was able to do counter pressure in this position. 20 minutes later, she began to feel an overwhelming urge to push and was involuntarily bearing down with contractions. She was doing so well, continuing to breathe the baby down while the doctor was setting everything up.\n\nAround roughly 6:20, Brianna started to channel her efforts while pushing. She had been breathing baby down and working with her body, but she did not seem to have been moving her. The doctor told me, “I think this is going to be a bigger baby,” we suggested Brianna hold her breath and push. Once Brianna began using this method, the baby really started moving! The doctor and I encouraged Brianna to change positions after approximately every 5 contractions, and soon, we began to see the baby’s dark hair! Then, Brianna gave one more slow, controlled push while pushing on her side, and the baby’s head was out! Immediately, we noticed that she was looking straight up or “star gazing” as the doctor had said! Brianna gave one more final push, and she was here! The doctor said, “Hey Brianna, grab your baby!” and had Brianna grab her baby, bring her up to her, and be skin to skin. She did it!\n\nDella Renee\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n7:07 p.m.\n\n10lbs!\n\nJared and Brianna worked so well together in bringing Della to this side of creation! Della was named after Brianna’s grandmother, Mardella, and Renee after her aunt, Marlys Renee. How special! Now, all their children had names of close family! Della was born in a straight OP or “sunny side up” position and weighed in at 10lbs even! Brianna could go completely unmedicated, and she did it so well! She controlled her breathing and worked through one contraction at a time! A few minutes after birth, Brianna said “Oh my goodness, I did it! I did it completely unmedicated!”\n\nJared and Brianna, thank you for inviting me into the birth space and for allowing me to witness Brianna’s incredible strength! God is so good!\n\nShanae was in the first half of her pregnancy when she inquired regarding doula services. She was looking for some extra guidance and education throughout her first pregnancy. Her goal was to deliver her baby in an empowering way - building confidence in her body’s abilities while trusting & praising God for the gift of birth and the little human he entrusted them with.\n\nShanae prepared her body by eating dates, drinking RRLT, stayed active, and consistently saw a chiropractor.\n\nShanae had a fairly uncomplicated pregnancy, until she was nearing the last few weeks when her blood pressure started becoming elevated. This called for extra appointments, lab draws, non-stress tests, ultrasounds, and blood pressure checks. Due to her higher blood pressure, her provider recommended an induction.\n\nThe evening of Sunday, April 7, Shanae got all checked in for her induction. She was 1.5 cm dilated, 60% effaced, and -2 station. She took a dose of oral Cytotec at 8:00 p.m. We discussed what the induction process may look like and when I would be the most helpful throughout her labor. I gave Shanae some ideas for different positions as well as a labor warm up circuit, but also encouraged her to rest if she was able to.\n\nI touched based with Shanae right away in the morning. She said she had a pretty uneventful evening - she was able to get some intermittent sleep. They gave her more doses of oral Cytotec at midnight and 4:00 a.m. She was having mild cramping, but it was starting to pick up a little more since the last dose. Her provider came around 8:45 to check her cervix and make a game plan for the day. She was 1.5 cm dilated, 75% effaced, and -2 station. The plan was to start Pitocin and hopefully break her water later in the day.\n\nPitocin was started at 9:30 a.m. Shanae stayed very active throughout the morning doing many different positions, stretches, and using the birthing ball. At 1:10, her provider returned to the bedside to break her bag of water. It didn’t take long for things to become intense after this!\n\nI got a text from Shanae at 2:49 p.m., “My nurse says it may be a good time to come now. Contractions are becoming very intense!” I immediately got ready to head out the door as I had an hour drive to the hospital yet. Shanae got in the tub to help provide some relief. She was doing such an amazing job coping and breathing through Pitocin contractions!\n\nAfter being in the tub for a while, Shanae wanted to try nitrous oxide to see if that would help take the edge off the pain. She tried it through a couple contractions, but didn’t like it so she requested the epidural at this time.\n\nI arrived to the hospital at 4:30 p.m. Shanae had just gotten comfortable from her epidural. Her nurse checked her and she was now 6 cm dilated, 100% effaced, and +1 station! Shanae’s nurse was amazing and helped me get her into different positions. We had her do a side-lying release on each side. She started feeling more pressure, so she agreed to another cervical exam at 5:00 p.m. where she was now 8 cm dilated. We were all getting so excited that she was progressing so quickly! Shanae continued to move into several different positions to continue encouraging the baby to come down further into her pelvis.\n\nShanae really started to feel more of a constant pressure and baby’s heart rate was dipping with contractions so we figured it had to be close. At 6:10 p.m., it was confirmed she was completely dilated!\n\nShe started pushing shortly after the nurse was able to notify her provider and have everything ready to go. Shanae was such an amazing and strong pusher. We could start to see the baby’s head with the first set of pushes! Shanae was willing to try pushing in several different positions - on her back, knees together, and tug of war. After less than an hour of pushing, their sweet baby boy was finally here!\n\nBillings Allen\n\nborn April 8, 2024 at 6:59 p.m.\n\n7lbs 12oz\n\nReese and Shanae worked together throughout the entire induction process to bring Billings into the world. Shanae, I am so proud of the strength and determination you had throughout your pregnancy and labor. It was such an honor to support sweet friends as they welcomed their sweet boy!\n\nTaylor and Erin were early in their pregnancy when they told me they were expecting. Right away I knew this birth would be beyond special to me as they are my brother and sister-in-law, so I was honored and excited they welcomed me into their birth space. I couldn’t wait to be an auntie again!\n\nErin prepared her body for labor by eating dates, drinking RRLT, and stayed active throughout her pregnancy with her busy job and going for many walks. She had a fairly uncomplicated pregnancy, besides the usual discomforts nearing her due date.\n\nA little over a week before her due date, Erin had an appointment where she had her provider check her cervix and attempt to strip her membranes. She was 1cm dilated, 30% effaced, and -2 station. Throughout the rest of the weekend, she started to have some bloody show and started to lose her mucous plug - all amazing signs that her body was preparing for labor!\n\nErin continued throughout her week without any other signs that labor was near. She had another appointment on Thursday, April 4, where she was 39 weeks and 5 days gestation. She opted for another cervical exam to see if any progress had been made and another membrane sweep if possible to try and bump her into labor. To our surprise, she was now 3cm dilated, 70% effaced, and 0 station! We were so amazed by the progress she had made and were hoping labor would be right around the corner. Erin went home and did ALL the things - stretching, walking, the miles circuit, birthing ball exercises, and pumping.\n\nThe next day we stayed in touch quite frequently throughout the day about how she was doing. Erin was a trooper finishing her last full day at work before starting maternity leave. She was having quite a bit of low back pain and a lot of pelvic pressure - which all made sense with how low the baby was already!\n\nAround 8:30 p.m. that Friday, Erin texted me asking if the intermittent back pain she was having could be early labor! I told her that easily could be the case and to start timing them to see if there were any patterns. The first hour of tracking them, the contractions were coming anywhere from 4-30 minutes apart and lasting 30-45 seconds. She continued to try resting through them, but it didn’t take much longer until her contractions were becoming more intense and she wasn’t able to get comfortable. At this point, Taylor and Erin made the decision to come into the hospital.\n\nThey arrived at the hospital and got all checked in around 11:30. Her nurse checked her shortly after getting there to find she was 4cm dilated, 90% effaced, and 0 station! Erin was doing absolutely amazing coping and breathing with each of her contractions. She continued to have back labor, so she requested to have sacral pressure and/or a hip squeeze to get through each contraction. I was actually working this evening, but I was able to pop in quite frequently to see how things were going and I knew the nurses were taking the absolute best care of her.\n\nHer provider came to the bedside around 1:30 a.m. and she requested another cervical exam - she was 5cm dilated, 100% effaced, and 0 station. Erin requested an epidural at this time as her back labor was becoming so intense. She was ready for some rest and relief as she hadn’t gotten any sleep yet. While waiting for the anesthesiologist to come and place the epidural, she received a dose of IV Fentanyl to take away the breakthrough pain and she was able to rest in between her contractions.\n\nErin continued to work very well through her contractions as Taylor applied pressure to her hips and sacrum. They truly made the best team through Erin’s labor, which was no surprise to me.\n\nFinally around 3:00 a.m., Erin had her epidural placed and was getting much better relief through her contractions. Erin, Taylor, and I decided we’d all try to get some rest at this time as it had been a long, sleepless night so far. Since I lived in town, I was going to quickly run home to shower and sleep for an hour or so.\n\nAt 5:50 a.m., I texted Erin to check in with her and see how things were going. She was able to get some rest and just requested the nurse to check her again as she was feeling increased pressure. She also let me know that her water broke spontaneously at 5:30 a.m., so I figured we had to be super close. At 6:00 a.m., it was confirmed that she was completely dilated and the baby was at a +1 station! I got ready to head back to the hospital as quickly as I could.\n\nAt 6:54 a.m., Erin began pushing. She continued to have good epidural coverage. Right away, I knew she was going to be such a strong pusher. She was most comfortable and pushing effectively on her back, so that’s what she did the whole time!\n\nAfter a little over an hour of amazing pushing, their sweet baby girl was finally here…right on her due date! Tears instantly filled all of our eyes. It was truly the most exciting, beautiful, and an overwhelmingly happy moment.\n\nOlivia Jude\n\nborn April 6, 2024 at 8:10 a.m.\n\n6lbs 11oz\n\nErin worked so hard throughout her pregnancy and labor which helped her have such a smooth labor and delivery. It was such an empowering, joy-filled journey to be a part of that ended in supporting my brother and sister-in-law and meeting my sweet niece. There’s nothing like witnessing your siblings become parents for the first time - such a beautiful moment to watch. It was truly an experience that I will forever be thankful to be a part of!\n\nLeta and Marcus set up a meeting to meet with me when she was approximately 10 weeks pregnant. They shared their difficult infertility journey with me and how they were thrilled to have their baby!\n\nThroughout pregnancy, Leta actively did her stretches and eating dates, although she hated them. As Leta entered the last few weeks of pregnancy, she decided to have an induction date on the schedule as her doctor wouldn’t allow her to go past 41 weeks pregnant. She felt good having a date set but was hoping to go into labor on her own!\n\nOn Friday, April 5th, at 39 weeks 6 days gestation, Leta decided to go into the hospital to be evaluated as she seemed to be leaking fluid possibly. Once she got there, they hooked her up to the monitors and did a test to see if her water had broken, and sure enough, it had! It turns out that Leta had been leaking fluid for over 24 hours. Because of this, it increased her risk for infection, so throughout labor, her vitals were always frequently monitored.\n\nAt 1:00 on Friday, she texted me to let me know all of this and that she wouldn't be leaving the hospital until she had this baby! Her doctor had come in and checked her cervix, and she was still closed and was not having contractions. Due to her water being broken, she was not able to have many of the \"usual\" induction medications and opted to try oral Cytotec. I sent her some stretches to try and things to do to try to encourage labor.\n\nThroughout the day, we stayed in touch, and Leta started having some contractions but was coping well.\n\nAt a little after 10 p.m., the nurse working with Leta called me and informed me that her contractions were picking up in intensity, and she was ready for me to come to support her for a bit. She had checked her cervix, and she was 2cm dilated, but the nurse felt it would be beneficial to try some positioning before she got her epidural.\n\nUpon arrival at the hospital, Leta was in the tub, breathing through contractions. We did some positions to keep helping the baby try to descend into the pelvis. Marcus and she were an incredible team, and she was so controlled!\n\nAt approximately midnight, the nurse and doctor came in and checked her cervix, which was 4cm dilated. This was encouraging, and we continued to work hard and utilize all different positions to help the baby engage.\n\nAround 2 a.m., the doctor came in again and checked Leta, and she was 6cm dilated and 90% effaced. Leta was doing great, and we continued working through contractions; we went from the toilet to the bed to standing to squat.\n\nLeta decided around 4 a.m. that she was ready to be rechecked as she started feeling more pressure. The nurse checked her cervix and thought that she was 8cm dilated, and everyone was feeling good! Leta and Marcus were ready to rest briefly, as she had been up all night. I helped her into a side-lying runner's lunge, and she could sleep, and Marcus could lay down for a bit.\n\nAfter resting, she decided to get up and try more moving positions. She labored on the toilet some more and felt like she was ready for another cervical check and possibly an epidural. At around 6 a.m., the nurse checked her and thought she was roughly 8-9 cm dilated, but she wasn't completely confident in her exam. So because of this, she updated the doctor, and he decided to come in and check Leta's cervix herself.\n\nWhen he came in and checked her, he disappointedly informed everyone that she was still only dilated at a six and had not made any cervical change from his previous check. This was very disheartening as she had been working so hard all night but re-affirmed her decision for an epidural.\n\nAround 6:30 a.m., the anesthesiologist came in and started her getting prepped for the epidural. Leta, Marcus, and I decided that I would go home for a while, and everyone would try to sleep as it had been a long night. The nurse was going to start Pitocin as soon as she was comfortable, and then the doctor would come back around 10 a.m. and recheck her cervix. I said, \"See you later,\" and left my lights and speaker all set up with plans to return after everyone had rested and things started to pick up again.\n\nWith Marcus Leta's permission, the nurse texted me and let me know she was comfortable with the epidural after a difficult process around 7:30 a.m.\n\nAt 10 a.m., the doctor came back to check on Leta after she had been on Pitocin for a few hours and was comfortable with her epidural. When he checked her cervix, he felt it had not changed from 6cm. He offered to come back in 2 hours again and see how she was doing but also gave them the option for a c-section. After a discussion between the doctor and Marcus and Leta, I received a text that said, \"Still no change from 6cm at 2 a.m. Baby still looks great, but call a c-section.\"\n\nMiles David\n\nborn April 6th, 2024 at 11:27 a.m.\n\n7lbs 3oz and 18 inches long\n\nMiles was trying to come out with his cheek first, which made it so tricky for Leta to keep dilating! Although her birth ended in a C-section, she and Marcus gave it their all. She was more than willing to do any position I had suggested and do it without complaints! Marcus stayed by her, said the ENTIRE night, and waited on every need, and it was such a sweet testament to their love story. I am so proud of Leta and Marcu’s perseverance throughout infertility, staying up all night, and working to bring baby Miles into the world! Thank you for inviting me to walk alongside you throughout the process!\n\nMy bestie had a baby! 27 years of friendship; from growing up together in California, to being a part of her birth here in Iowa. Life is wild!\n\nCassandra told me she was pregnant when she was just 6 weeks along, and I was ecstatic to be a part of her birth. 4 years ago, Cassandra had a primary c-section after a labor induction. She then had a repeat c-section with her second child. Since then, Cassandra really started diving into birth education and she wanted to give her body another chance to have a vaginal delivery with their 3rd baby. Cassandra found VBAC midwives to help guide her in this journey. Throughout pregnancy, Cassandra prepped her body with plenty of movement and stretching, seeing the chiropractor, and chasing around her two active boys.\n\n​\n\nCassandra’s due date came and went with a few bouts of prodromal labor that never ended up amounting to much. At 40 weeks 2 days pregnant, Cassandra had an appointment with her hospital based midwife; she opted for a cervical check and membrane sweep in hopes to avoid an induction. She was already 3.5 cm dilated and very thinned out. While in Sioux Falls, Cassandra started to have some mild contractions, so she decided to stay there for a while just in case labor was starting. After a couple of hours shopping and doing some walking around, not much was changing with her contractions so she headed home. Throughout the night and next day, her contractions completely stopped. The following day, at 40 weeks and 4 days pregnant, Cassandra had an appointment with her local midwife who offered a second membrane sweep. Cassandra was now 4 cm dilated with a bulging bag of water. We knew it was just a short matter of time now!\n\n​\n\nAt 10:30 pm that evening, I got a text from Cassandra saying she thought her water broke. It was baby time! She was having mild contractions when she left for the hospital and I planned on heading up when they started becoming more regular and intense. And on their drive up, contractions became just that. Cassandra was having contractions every 3 minutes that were getting quite uncomfortable in the car. I got my stuff together and headed up to Sioux Falls. Cassandra got checked in and was admitted to the floor. She was 5 cm at this point, but once she got checked in her contractions stopped. She couldn’t believe they would halt after being so intense on the drive to the hospital.\n\n​\n\nIt was around 1 am when I arrived, and Cassandra was getting all settled in. When she laid on the bed, her contractions stopped. However, if she was up and moving she would continue having them. We started off by doing some stretches to loosen her ligaments and help the baby find a better position, hoping this would start more contractions. We then decided to sleep since labor wasn’t intense yet. Cassandra and Logan both got a couple hours of light sleep before morning came.\n\n​\n\nAt 6:15 am, the midwife came in to check how things were going and asked to check if any progress was made through the night. Cassandra was still a 5 and not really contracting much. Her midwife suggested Pitocin to get contractions started again & was hoping to start pitocin before the next shift change came in the morning. She wanted to give Cassandra her chance at a vaginal delivery. With some hesitation, Cassandra decided it was at least worth a try. At 6:45 am, the pitocin was going and within 30 minutes, contractions were picking up again.\n\nI had a hunch that the baby was hung up on the right side and that was why contractions weren’t picking up on their own, so I told Cassandra we were gonna get to work getting this baby in the optimal position. Cassandra went along with all my crazy ideas knowing how important her baby’s position would be to her having her VBAC.\n\nWith only a couple units of pitocin going, Cassandra’s contractions were picking up with high intensity! By 9 am, Cassandra was moaning through her contractions that were coming every 2-3 minutes. We focused on lots of hands and knees and leaning forward positions to help rotate the baby forward.\n\nAt 10:45 am, Cassandra was deep into active labor, nearly transitioning when her midwife offered a cervical check. Cassandra decided she wanted to know where things were at, so she consented to the check. She was now 8 cm and the baby had moved down significantly!\n\nI filled up the tub hoping that would help her relax. Soon after, Cassandra got into the tub onto her hands and knees. Within a few minutes, her legs went numb and since the tub was so small, she got back out and instead squatted on the floor, lying her head at the foot of the bed. I offered counter pressure while Logan stayed by Cassandra's head, supporting her.\n\n​\n\nCassandra moved back to the bed and worked through contractions on her side, hoping that the end was near. At 12:05 pm, her midwife checked her and she was 9.5cm. She felt that Cassandra could push past the last little bit of cervix. After a few pushes, she was complete. Cassandra rocked side-lying pushing and moved her baby down with every push. We then tried the hands and knees position but it wasn’t as effective so she opted for side-lying on the opposite side. Cassandra got to reach down and feel her baby’s hair while crowning! With just an hour of pushing, Cassandra delivered her baby! An unmedicated VBA2C! Cassandra held her baby to her chest and exclaimed, “I can’t believe I did it!”. There wasn’t a dry eye in the room. Logan then got to call out to all of us that, “IT’S A GIRL!”.\n\n​\n\nHazel Noelle\n\nBorn March 28 at 1:13pm\n\n6lbs 8oz\n\n​\n\nCassandra reclaimed her power and authority in childbirth. She trusted her body and baby throughout the entire process. Birth truly can be redemptive! I couldn’t be more proud to call you my lifelong friend and was honored to support you through this amazing experience!\n\nKaitlin reached out when she got a positive pregnancy test in July for doula services in March. She is a nurse at a local hospital and is familiar with the labor and delivery world, so it was fun getting to hear her perspectives on things.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to birth, Kaitlin stayed active in working her job and keeping up with her other 3 children. She started having quite a bit of inconsistent contractions that started around 36 weeks. These would come and go, and some were even quite intense over the next few weeks. When Kaitlin was approaching 39 weeks, she decided she was ready to be induced as she felt her body needed an extra little push to go into labor as she was quite uncomfortable. She also had some higher blood pressure, and at her OB appointment also that morning. She and her doctor decided on a cytotec induction starting at 8 pm on Tuesday, March 19, and when she arrived for her induction was found to have protien in her urine which further confirmed that it was time for her to have her baby. She had cytotec placed with her other inductions and her body has responded well to it in the past, so she was optimistic this would be all her body needed.\n\nWhen she checked in to the hospital, she was checked and she was 4cm dilated and a dose of cytotec was placed around 9 pm. I encouraged Kaitlin to get up and move around when she was able as the baby was still very high. She went through some labor circuits and positioning while she was awake but also tried to sleep for a bit. She updated me via text at 1:00 am that she was having regular contractions, but she was still able to cope and the doctor would be in in the morning to check her.\n\nIn the morning the doctor checked her and at 6:00 am she was 6cm dilated. She and the doctor discussed whether to further intervention or not, and she decided that she was ready for an epidural and then wanted the doctor to come back later and break her water. The epidural was probably the most intense part of Kaitlin's labor as she was having a very difficult time getting placement. During the process of getting an epidural, Kaitlin began to get shaky and decided to get checked to see if she was in transition. She was noted to be 7cm dilated, and she decided to continue the process of the epidural. Finally, after being completely miserable during the process, the epidural began to work. Once she was comfortable, the doctor came in and checked her and she was still 7cm dilated and he broke her water at 8:55 a.m. After this, we helped Kaitlin into several positions to encourage her to rest while still working on the baby coming down. She was able to rest for a couple of hours, but soon contractions were becoming more intense. Her epidural was light enough that she was able to hold herself up, so we continued to work on positions. These involved things such as hands and knees while leaning over the edge of the bed, semi-squatting, high thrones, and many more. She was such a good sport in working to move into any position I suggested!\n\nAround noon the doctor came back to check her and she was 8cm dilated and the baby had moved into the mid pelvis. After finding this out, Kaitlin opted to start some Pitocin to see if that would help give her more adequate contractions as she was getting tired. Pitocin was started around 1:00 pm and soon her contractions became much more regular and more intense. We continued to work hard on encouraging the baby through the mid-pelvis. During this time Kaitlin's epidural also really wore off, and she was able to feel pretty much everything. She stayed in control though and did a great job breathing and coping with contractions!\n\nAround 3:00 p.m. she began to feel an overwhelming urge to push. She had pushed for several hours with her last baby, so the initial plan was for her to labor down in hopes of decreasing pushing time. But now with minimal epidural coverage, the urge was overwhelming and she asked for the doctor to come back to check her to see if she could start pushing. She was checked and found to have a small anterior lip on her left cervix. We decided to work through some more positions to try to get rid of the cervix as well as allow the baby to descend into the birth canal a little further. Within an hour, she had an even more overwhelming urge and began to involuntarily push with contractions. The doctor came back again and checked her cervix and she was 10cm dilated at 4:14 pm. He got everything set up and soon Kaitlin was ready to actively start pushing! She was nervous about this stage due to the hours she spent pushing during her son's birth 2 years earlier. Once Kaitlin began pushing at 4:26 pm, it was obvious that she was pushing very well and that it wouldn't be hours this time! Chris and she did not know the gender of this baby, so when Chris began to see the baby's head, he was ready to announce the gender. Then, with one more strong push, Kaitlin delivered their baby earthside and Chris announced to the room, \"IT'S A GIRL!\" Everyone was shocked, as Kaitlin swore it would be a boy!\n\nEvelyn Ann\n\nMarch 20th, 2023 4:46 p.m.\n\n7lbs 9oz\n\nKaitlin and Chris chose to name their daughter after Kaitlin's great-grandmother Evelyn. Her great-grandmother was a wonderful woman who will forever hold a special place in her heart. Kaitlin worked so hard throughout her induction, and Chris was there supporting her along the way with whatever she needed. Evelyn's birth was longer than Kaitlin had anticipated, but she continued to navigate each hour with perseverance. The look of shock Kaitlin had when Chris announced their baby was a girl, is something that I will never forget! Thanks, Chris and Kaitlin for allowing me to support you through Evelyn's birth!\n\nJoselyn and Joe reached out in the early third trimester of her pregnancy when her original planned homebirth was changed to a hospital due to her midwife moving into a hospital setting. They were now excited about the idea of a doula to add to her care team in the hospital. I had an unexpected opening during the weeks around Joselyn's due date and was so excited to work with them!\n\nJoselyn got right to work in preparing her body for labor but staying active by doing stretches, drinking RRLT, and eating dates. And most importantly she was patient and was trusting of her body to go into labor when it was ready.\n\nJoselyn texted me Thursday night the day of her due date that she was having some tightenings but they weren’t painful or uncomfortable. She tried some stretches and then decided to try and get some rest as we weren’t sure what the evening would bring!\n\nWhen Joselyn woke up Friday morning she was still having some off-and-on tightenings, but they had not changed. She decided to go about her day and see what would happen. I also encouraged her to go through the miles circuit to help ensure the baby was in a good position. Things didn't seem to change much throughout the day and we thought she maybe was just having regular Braxton hicks contractions. She also stayed in contact with her midwife throughout this time.\n\nSaturday mid-morning Joselyn texted me that she thought her water may have broken but she was not having much more than just tightening yet. She let her midwife know and she was encouraged to eat, rest, and see if her body would start having contractions.\n\nBy 6 pm, Joselyn had not started having contractions, so she was encouraged to go into the hospital to check on the baby and verify if her water did or did not break and to be evaluated by her midwife.\n\nOnce she arrived at the hospital, the midwife did confirm that her water had broken. She also had her cervix checked and she was about 1cm dilated with a posterior cervix and 50% effaced. In discussion with her midwife, they were going to see how the evening went and see if her body would start to labor on its own. I encouraged her to call me during the night if things started progressing!\n\nShe was able to sleep during the night, but in the morning things started progressing and contractions were starting! She felt encouraged by this and felt her contractions were manageable. We continued to stay in touch and I sent her a few different positions to try to help encourage labor. At 11:00 a.m., contractions had increased slightly but not greatly. The midwife came to check her cervix and she was now 2cm dilated at 80% effaced. Joselyn and Joe decided with the midwife that it was time to start Pitocin to help encourage more adequate contractions.\n\nThe Pitocin was started at around 1:45 p.m. and Joselyn and Joe felt ready for me to come support them in labor.\n\nI arrived at the hospital at around 3:20 p.m. and Joselyn was having to breathe through contractions but was still talking and laughing in between. She had been resting in bed so we decided to get up and move through contractions to help encourage the baby to settle further down in the pelvis. The midwife was at her bedside and informed me that the baby was at -1 station so that informed us to utilize position to help the baby navigate the mid pelvis. Joselyn and Joe were such an awesome team and were willing to work through any positions I suggested!\n\nJoselyn's Pitocin had been turned up to 4 units right before I arrived and it was all she needed to help her body kick into labor! Soon Joselyn began to slip into \"labor land\" and was not able to talk to us much in between contractions anymore. We had the rope lights, diffuser, and beautiful Christian music playing in the background while she was laboring. It was such a calm and peaceful environment that several nurses and a doctor snuck in to watch and observe how Joselyn was laboring. She was breathing wonderfully through contractions and continued to me moving into several different positions.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, Joselyn began to bear down at the end of contractions. The midwife offered a cervical check and at 4:30 p.m. she was 8cm dilated with a bulging bag of water. Joselyn continued to labor for another hour and at 5:30, she was still 8cm dilated so she consented to her bag of water being broken to help encourage the rest of her cervix to dilate. After this was broken, she dilated right to a 9.5. We decided to labor some on the toilet and have Joselyn empty her bladder. She labored through several different positions, and soon she was completely dilated and began to feel an overwhelming urge to push.\n\nJoselyn began pushing at 6:30 p.m. and was so strong! The midwife and I helped encourage her to push in several different positions from hands and knees to standing, to squatting, her side, and her back. She was working hard and the baby was moving down great! Joe was right next to the midwife, and with one final strong push, he and the midwife caught their baby! She cried immediately and was placed up on Joselyn's chest! It was such a beautiful moment to be able to witness as Joe and Joselyn entered into parenthood.\n\nMarch 3rd, 2024, 8:34 p.m.\n\nJubilee Grace\n\n8lbs 5oz\n\nJoselyn and Joe worked together the entire labor to bring Jubilee into the world. Joe was right by Joselyn’s side and was speaking encouraging words to her, holding her up, and believing in her. As Joselyn said, “Jesus is our Jubilee, and our daughter's name is a beautiful reminder of that joyful reality!\" Thank you Joselyn and Joe for inviting me into your birth space, you were such a blessing to work with!\n\n​\n\nCourtney inquired about doula services when she was in the first half of her pregnancy. This was her second pregnancy and she was looking for some guidance and support to have a different experience than her first birth.\n\nCourtney prepared her body for labor by eating dates, drinking RRLT, stayed active with her little boy and work, and saw a chiropractor towards the end of her pregnancy. Courtney didn’t do many position changes and had a prolonged amount of time pushing with a vacuum with her first baby. She was hoping to avoid each of these things this time around.\n\nCourtney texted me they had set an induction date as she was hoping to avoid going beyond her due date. A couple of days prior to her set induction date, she texted me saying she’d been having contractions for a few hours - they were lasting about one minute long and coming every couple of minutes. We discussed that this could be the start of early labor, but we would have to give it some time and see how the rest of the night went. I encouraged her to stay active if she was able, but to also prioritize rest if she felt she was able. Unfortunately, the contractions subsided in the middle of the night. It was most definitely a sign her body was getting ready and preparing for labor which was super encouraging!\n\nThe morning of her induction came. We discussed what this induction process may look like and when I would be the most helpful throughout labor. When Courtney started her induction, her cervix was about 3cm dilated and 60% effaced. The plan was to start with Cytotec and then just see how things go. Courtney spent the morning staying quite active - on the birthing ball, walking, and many other labor warm up stretches.\n\nAround noon, her provider came back to check on her. She was still 3cm dilated, but her cervix had thinned out some more. Her provider then gave her another dose of Cytotec to continue with cervical ripening. Courtney continued to be very active throughout the afternoon and even got to go outside for a walk.\n\nShortly before 5 p.m. Courtney texted me the contractions were picking up in intensity and she was really having to breathe through them. Her provider came back shortly after to perform another cervical exam to find out she was 4cm dilated. Courtney gave her provider the okay to break her water at this point. Things got really intense after this!\n\nCourtney tried to go in the tub for a little while hoping this would help her relax some more, but the heat was too much to handle. At this point, she requested I start to make my way over to her. In the meantime, they gave her a dose of IV Fentanyl to help take the edge off for the time being.\n\nAt 6:35 p.m. I arrived at the hospital. Courtney had requested an epidural so they were preparing everything for that as I was walking in. After about an hour of receiving the epidural, she was finally able to get adequate pain relief. She was exhausted and was hoping to get some rest at this time.\n\nBaby still had quite a way to come down into the pelvis, so we did several different positions to help do that. Around 9:30 p.m. her provider came back to the bedside to perform another cervical exam. She was 9cm dilated, 100% effaced, but still a -2 station. Our goal was to get the baby much lower into the pelvis before even thinking about starting to push.\n\nWithin the next hour, Courtney started feeling nauseous and had a lot more pressure in her bottom. At 10:30 p.m. her provider came back to the bedside to check her again to find out she was complete and the baby had come down into the pelvis!\n\nAfter laboring down, Courtney decided she was ready to begin pushing. Shortly after beginning pushing, it was obvious we needed to turn her epidural down so she would have a better idea of where to push.\n\nCourtney was a trooper and was willing to try ANY pushing position that I suggested. She pushed while using the tug of war method, side-lying, hands and knees, closed knee pushing, modified squatting, etc. Unfortunately little progress was being made after close to two hours of pushing. This was beginning to get quite discouraging for Courtney, but she persevered and continued to push as hard as she could over the next hour.\n\nHer provider asked another OB provider to assess if she’d be able to apply the vacuum on the baby's head, but they both agreed this wasn’t going to be the safest option at this point and time. At this time, Courtney was opting for a c-section as she was completely exhausted, feeling like she had nothing else to give and she wanted what was safest for the baby. Her provider discussed more of what a cesarean section would look like and Courtney agreed to this. At 2:05 a.m. Courtney and her medical team decided to go for a c-section.\n\nCrue Andy\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\n2:51 a.m.\n\n7lbs 11oz\n\nThis sweet little stinker was in a face up position and had his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck which explains why he was making us work so hard to get him engaged into the pelvis. We praise God that this sweet boy is here and healthy as can be!\n\nCourtney’s birth is another true testament that even though it may not have gone the way she wanted despite all efforts, God is still SO good! His plan will forever be better than we could ever want and Courtney showed true surrender to this. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your birth space!\n\nWhen Marissa texted me in July and said, \"Good morning! What does your upcoming schedule look like? Grace will be a big sister, and I'm due on Valentine's Day!\" I was so excited because I got to support Josh and Marissa through Grace's labor several months prior!\n\nThroughout the weeks leading up to birth, Marissa actively chased around a toddler and kept up with her older kids' activities. Her main hope for this birth was that she could go into labor on her own as she had been induced with Grace.\n\n​\n\nWhen Marissa was 39 weeks and one day pregnant, she went in for her appointment. She was 2cm dilated and 50% effaced and decided to have the doctor strip her membranes in hopes that may help jump-start her labor. After her appointment, Marissa went for a walk, drank some tea, and went through some stretches, hoping it would bring on labor.\n\n​\n\nThroughout the afternoon and evening, Marissa and I stayed in touch, and in the evening, around 8:30, she noticed some slight cramping. She was tired, so I encouraged her to go to bed and see how the evening would go. At 10:18, she texted me and said that the cramping had turned more into contractions and was lasting about 35-50 seconds in length. We talked back and forth about some things to try, and Marissa decided to have her mom start coming over as her mom lived 45 minutes away. At 10:35, she felt like the contractions were starting to get intense enough that she was ready for me to head to her house in hopes of laboring at home for a while.\n\n​\n\nI arrived at her house around 11:15, and Marissa was having to breathe through contractions but was coping wonderfully! They were still inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 7 minutes apart. We did some inversions and had her lean over the birth ball in hopes of getting the baby in a better position to encourage a better labor pattern. She was such a trooper and was doing whatever position I suggested! After Marissa's mom arrived, we all hung out in the living room and talked and laughed while she continued working through the contractions. Marissa decided to try pumping while doing pelvic tilts on the birth ball to see if that would help bring on any stronger contractions. We then decided to move the toilet, aka \"dilation station,\" so she could rest and continue to labor. At 12:45, we moved to the toilet, and while Marissa rested, she could sleep and her contractions spaced out. We debated whether I should go home for a while, and everyone tried to sleep as the intensity had not really increased, and now they seemed to be spacing out. Let's say it was a good thing I didn't!\n\n​\n\nAfter discussing this plan, at 1:05 a.m.Marissa got one massive, super intense contraction on the toilet that was much different than the contractions over the last several hours. We decided to see how the next one went, and it was again super intense! She climbed into her bathtub, and I had her lean over the peanut ball and place a leg on the side. We did this for two intense contractions, then she moved to the other side. After moving to the other side, Marissa had another big contraction at 1:15 a.m. and told me, \"I feel a lot of pressure in my butt.\" I encouraged her to reach inside and see if she was able to feel the baby's head, and if not, it was probably time to head to the hospital!\n\n​\n\nShe couldn't feel the head, so I helped her out of the tub to dry off, and she decided she wanted to ride with me to the hospital because I was able to put my back seats flat so that she was able to go on hands and knees and her husband would follow.\n\n​\n\nWe got loaded up in the car, and Marissa continued to have intense contractions. I called the hospital and informed them we were on our way in! Throughout the ride, Marissa told me the pressure was getting more intense, and she was also beginning to yell out through contractions. When we were a few miles from the hospital, she yelled, \"Oh my gosh, I just felt it drop like 3 inches inside me!\" I started to speed up a little as Marissa had had a reasonably quick delivery with her first baby!\n\n​\n\nWe made it to the hospital and were met by the nurse by the sliding doors, who helped Marissa walk back to her labor room. The nurse was so calm and prepared for Marissa by getting the tub to fill up and turning the lights down. Once inside the room, Marissa consented to have a cervical check from the nurse as her doctor lived a ways away.\n\n​\n\nThe nurse checked her at 1:37 a.m., and she was 7-8 cm dilated with a bulging bag of water, and the baby's head was low! Marissa was ready to get in the tub now, while the nurse called her doctor and the on-call doctor as she wasn't sure her primary doctor would be able to get there in time.\n\nWhile in the tub, Marissa could relax between contractions while she squeezed a comb in her hands. She asked me to climb behind her and do counter pressure so her husband could be by her face. After a couple of contractions in the tub, it was apparent Marissa was bearing down. The hospital that she was at policies don’t allow for water birth, but Marissa was adamant she was not going to get out of the tub at this point as she was having so much pressure. No doctor had arrived yet, so the nurse calmly put on gloves and prepared to catch her baby as I climbed out of t"
