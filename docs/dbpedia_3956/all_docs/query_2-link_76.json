        "text": "Blog\n\nJefferson’s Summary View as a Political Document with a Strong Southern Flair\n\nIn a 2022 essay for Abbeville, “Jefferson’s Textured Republicanism,” I examine letters by Jefferson on the differences between Federalists and Republicans. Jefferson argues that there is a constitutional (physical) difference between Federalists (Tories) and Republicans (Whigs), which manifests itself in polar political sentiments. Republicans and Whigs are Saxon-sympathizers; Federalists and Tories, Norman-sympathizers. In a letter from Jefferson to Marquis de…\n\nBlog\n\nWas Jefferson Davis a Traitor?\n\nWhile many Civil War students argue that Jefferson Davis was a traitor, he was never convicted of the crime because Federal prosecutors dropped the case. Specifically, in February 1869 Attorney General William Evarts notified Davis’s counsel that all prosecutors were told to apply nolle prosequi to all his indictments. To be sure, after Lincoln’s April 15, 1865, assassination many Northerners…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Nature of the Union: A Response to Mark Pulliam\n\nThis piece was originally published at the Independent Institute. Mark Pulliam is a good fellow. He is retired from big law and regularly writes for publications such as Chronicles and the Law and Liberty Blog. Pulliam often sends me links to his publications and 99 percent of the time, I love his material. I enjoy my correspondence with him. However,…\n\nBlog\n\nA Hill and a Holler\n\nSome memories are a story just waiting to be told. And memories of family make some of the best stories. Some of my favorite memories revolve around travel, those family outings where we hit the not so dusty trails of Dixie. Actually, many modern highways were the byways, the pioneer trails of yesteryear. Our travel often included extended family, with…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Resistance of the South to Northern Radicalism\n\nThis piece was originally published in the New England Quarterly in 1935. In December 22, 1859, an extra train arrived at Richmond bringing over two hundred medical students from Philadelphia. It was the hegira of southern students from the North following the excitement of John Brown's raid. The faculty and students of the Richmond Medical College, the town council, and…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Economic Aspects of the South as a Health and Pleasure Resort\n\nEditor's Introduction: This short essay in The South and the Building of the Nation series highlights the spirit of reconciliation that most Americans embraced by the early twentieth century. Published in 1909, The South in the Building of the Nation offered native Southerners--almost all of whom possessed terminal degrees in their academic fields--a chance to offer a critical yet often…\n\nBlog\n\nOh, Say Can You Secede?\n\nThis piece was originally published at The Imaginative Conservative. A review of The Constitution of Non-State Government: Field Guide to Texas Secession (Shotwell, 2022) by T.L Hulsey “Secession,” writes Robert W. Merry in a recent essay for The American Conservative, “isn’t a word heard in today’s political discourse.” But, he notes, “an extensive poll of 35,307 Americans conducted earlier this…\n\nBlog\n\nSmall Town Sunday\n\nCities hustle and bustle, small towns hum. Six days out of seven in the little town where I live, you can hear the low rattle of log trucks playing hopscotch over potholes in county roads that haven’t been solid since Clinton was governor. The chug-a-chug of the Georgia Pacific train marks six o’clock on both ends of the day. And…\n\nBlog\n\nFrom the Archives–What Secession Is\n\nThe Institute was founded in 2002 around a conference table at the University of Virginia. We held our first Summer School in 2003. Here, President Emeritus Donald Livingston discusses \"What Secession Is\" at this first summer event. It's a worthy topic in our current political climate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kZSU8NJIzY\n\nBlog\n\nThe Unimpeachable Authority of Annette Gordon-Reed on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings\n\n“Travelling through a desert, a man saw a woman, standing alone and with her eyes fixed to the ground. “‘Who are you,’ asked he. “‘I am Truth,’ she replied. “‘Why have you left the city and retreated to the desert?’ “‘Times have changed. In days bygone, few people lied. Yet now, all people lie.’ “Human life is a vile and…\n\nBlog\n\nFrom the Archives–Livingston v. Guelzo\n\nIn September 2010, the University of Virginia hosted a debate between Abbeville Institute founder Don Livingston and Professor Allen Guelzo, recognized to be one of the foremost Lincolnian scholars in the United States, on the topic \"Is Nullification Constitutional?\" Guelzo is as committed to the Lincolnian position of an \"indestructible Union\" as Livingston is to the compact fact of the…\n\nBlog\n\nFrom the Archives–A Plea for the Real Union\n\nThe Abbeville Institute website has existed in its current form since April 2014 when we relaunched and rebranded our online presence, a shade over a decade after the founding of the Institute. We wanted our online footprint to highlight our past, present, and future. Clyde Wilson was not only one of the founding members of the Institute, he has been…\n\nBlog\n\nSpencer Roane, Part 2\n\nContinued from Part 1. When the Democrats came into power, the need of a Democratic paper was felt in Virginia. The newspaper had now become one of the most important methods of political warfare. Each party maintained one at Washington, in which articles advocating the one and maligning the other were published. These were read throughout the country, and in…\n\nBlog\n\nSpencer Roane, Part 1\n\nWritten by Edwin J. Smith in 1905 and published in the John P. Branch Historical Papers of Randolph-Macon College. The formative period of our national existence is the one which, more than any other, produced great men. Great issues arose which had to be settled. Great battles were fought and won in the arena of public life-battles on which depended…\n\nBlog\n\nHow Liberal was Thomas Jefferson’s Liberalism?\n\nGovernment, Thomas Jefferson all too frequently notes, is for the sake of the wellbeing of all citizens, each considered the political equal of all others and, in consequence, deserving of the same rights. Government, thus, exists for the sake of the wellbeing of all citizens, considered as individuals. Government, he often says, is of and for the people. That noted,…\n\nBlog\n\nMy New Favorite Song\n\nI have a new favorite song. I discovered it during the promotional build-up to the annual football contest between two worthy academic institutions: The University of Michigan and The Ohio State University. I don’t know whether the song has a title, but it is sung to the tune of “ The Old Grey Mare” (she ain’t what she used to…\n\nBlog\n\nHave We Learned Anything from the Destruction of Confederate Monuments?\n\nOn a bright September day in 2017, in my hometown of Dallas, Texas, a work crew removed a large, bronze statue from Lee Park. The sculpture depicted Robert E. Lee accompanied by a young soldier, each mounted on horseback, and had been unveiled eight decades earlier as part of the Texas Centennial.

Just how that resemblance was established is unclear. Eston Hemings died in 1877; Thomas Jefferson, in 1826.

In his definitive book War Crimes…\n\nBlog\n\nAn Affectionate Farewell\n\nThis is a footnote to my most recent offering at the Abbeville Institute regarding the sayonara being given to far too much of Southern culture, heritage and history that is now being swept away by the ever-growing tsunami of mindless social justice rage. You might well ask what could possibly have led a person who was born and largely bred…\n\nBlog\n\nWillmoore Kendall’s Battle Lines\n\nFew men would confuse the late Willmoore Kendall for a Southern gentleman. The son of a blind Oklahoma Southern Methodist preacher, the conservative political philosopher married three times, and carried on numerous affairs. A regular contributor to National Review, Kendall was once caught with a copy girl in the office of a colleague in NR spaces. He was an alcoholic,…\n\nBlog\n\nBronze is the Mirror of Form\n\nWith the Thanksgiving of 2023 in the rearview mirror, I am still thankful for the over 9000 Americans who submitted comments around the removal of the Confederate Memorial in Arlington Cemetery. Only 10% of the comments supported the decision to remove the memorial. Over eight thousand Americans wrote in defense of the Confederate Memorial, and over 364 people mentioned grave…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Great Awakening in Wilson County, Tennessee\n\nIt is often said that “a watched pot doesn’t boil”. Today I’d like to alter that saying to “A watched pot doesn’t boil over.”And I’d like to add that “A watched pressure cooker doesn’t blow up.” The idea here is to prevent a situation from getting out of hand and making a mess in the environment. This article is to…\n\nBlog\n\nWhat is the Future of the Southern Tradition?\n\nWhat is the future of the Southern tradition? This question presents a pressing problem for Americans in the twenty-first century. To those who reduce the Southern tradition to treason and slavery, the answer would be simple: it must be eradicated. Unfortunately, these people dominate the academic and political classes in American society. The near decade long pogrom on Southern symbols…\n\nBlog\n\nLincoln’s Quest for Empire\n\nMany Americans cherish the image of Honest Abe Lincoln: a lad born in humble circumstances who succeeded by hard, sleeves-rolled-up work; became President, fulfilling his lifelong goal of freeing the slaves, meanwhile saving government of, by and for the people; and was martyred and wafted to Heaven by angels. This image is folklore, no more related to the facts of…\n\nBlog\n\nPotluck\n\nI believe that the Marriage Supper of the Lamb will be a potluck. The Saints will come from afar, bearing covered dishes, and reclining at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But there will be no tofu, for it will have its part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. The course of my life can be charted…\n\nBlogReview Posts\n\nOutside the Gates of Eden\n\nWilliam Faulkner once said of his own work that he was just “a failed poet.” Of course, Faulkner is at the lasting peak of American culture in his portrayal of mankind’s striving and endurance and cannot be any kind of failure. The only thing I have in common with Faulkner is that we both write in prose—me being a very…\n\nBlog\n\nProfiteering from Farcicality\n\nIn August 2019, The New York Times, prompted by a notion of Nikole Hannah-Jones, began its 1619 Project—an attempt to rewrite completely America’s history by considering the year 1619 as the real birth of the American nation. In the words of New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief, Jay Silverstein: 1619 is not a year that most Americans know as a notable…\n\nBlog\n\nThe South in the Interpretation of the Constitution\n\nEditor's Note: This chapter is republished from The South in the Building of the Nation series (1909). In the making of the American Nation, the Southern states have played a conspicuous part-a part which has not received proper recognition at the hands of historians at home or abroad. This neglect of the South is largely the result of the views…\n\nBlog\n\n“I die in the service and defense of my country!”\n\nI just finished John Headly's book \"Confederate Operations in Canada and New York.\" It's a good read and provides great insight into Confederate operations in New York and other northern states. I highly recommend it. But this piece isn't about Headly. It's about John Yates Beall, acting master in the Confederate States Navy. In this book, Headly poignantly describes the…\n\nBlogReview Posts\n\nAfrican Founders and Albion’s Seed\n\nI've often been asked a variation of the same question: \"If you had to choose one American history book to recommend, what would it be?\" The answer is simple: David Hackett Fischer's Albion's Seed. I don't make this suggestion lightly. There are other fascinating and important works to consider, but Fischer presents a compelling tale of early American culture that…\n\nBlog\n\nWhat Would Jefferson Do?\n\nOne of the most difficult tasks of any historian is to show how knowing history is today relevant—that is, to show that history is heterotelic, that it is not its own end. The “Father of History,” the Greek Herodotus, who chronicled the events of the Persian War (490–479 B.C.) and aimed to cover both Greek and Persian motives, writes (my…\n\nBlog\n\nNo to War\n\nEditor's Note: On 5 April 1917, Representative Claude Kitchin of North Carolina rose and delivered a manly speech in opposition to Woodrow Wilson's call for a declaration of war against Germany. He was one of five Southern members of Congress who opposed the war resolution. Kitchin prophetically predicted that if she became involved in the war, America would be forced…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Peanut Gallery\n\nI never want another dog. As I made the 30 mile trek home from the veterinarian’s office with the stiff body of my 14 year old cur dog, Katie, beside me, I remember muttering those words through hot tears. “They’re a damned inconvenience is what they are,” I argued to myself. Making an oral list of reasons in case I…\n\nBlog\n\nAn Educator’s View on Preserving the Arlington Confederate Monument\n\nDespite being a young, developing discipline in America, historic preservation, as it continues to grow, is of vital importance to the very fabric of this nation. Historic lands, buildings, and monuments do not just represent a window into time that best exemplifies the quality of life and happenstance of the past but also offers a teaching opportunity for future generations.…\n\nBlog\n\nFrom Mayberry to Nashville\n\nWhat do a popular country group and the Vanderbilt Agrarians have in common? West Virginian Arlos Smith penned the song Mayberry for the pop-country group Rascal Flatts. There are striking similarities between the Agrarian manifesto I’ll Take My Stand (ITMS) and the song Mayberry, but I couldn’t find any evidence that the work of the Agrarians had any influence on…\n\nBlog\n\n“A Southside View of Slavery”\n\nWithin the purview of post-1950’s modern historiography, anything proclaimed in defense of the South is labeled “Lost Cause Myth” - a product of the “Lost Cause School” of thought. The term “Lost Cause” originates from the title of an 1866 book written in defense of the South but is now applied pejoratively to an entire category of Southern apologetics. Today,…\n\nBlog\n\nStanding Against the Totalitarian Horde, At Home and Abroad\n\nA few weeks ago a close acquaintance of mine wrote an impassioned letter intended for publication in a South Carolina newspaper. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, his letter was not printed by any media source in the state….Not because it was crude or appeared to incite violence; not because he employed foul language or insulting attacks against opponents. Indeed, the letter…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Truth About the Secession Documents\n\nIf the lie did not begin with Ty Seidule, he popularized it in his 2015 Prager U. video: “The secession documents of every single Southern state made clear, crystal clear, that they were leaving the Union in order to protect their peculiar institution of slavery.” This falsehood is repeated regularly by the ignorant and informed alike. Seidule was the head…\n\nBlog\n\nIs the American Experience Conservative?\n\nDelivered as a lecture at the Heritage Foundation, October, 1986. Having recently urged upon my fellow conservatives the necessity for attaching a priority to distinctions and definitions, having in the Intercollegiate Review insisted that such exercises are properly antecedent to all questions of policy, I was obliged to attempt a reflection on this theme when Mr. Hart proposed it to…\n\nBlog\n\nPostbellum Black Suffrage\n\nPresently, the dominant Reconstruction Era narrative portrays the Republican Party’s support for black suffrage as a moral impulse. The likelihood that it would also increase the number of Republican-loyal voters is dismissed as a convenient by product of “doing the right thing.” Today’s experienced voters, however, realize that political parties seek to increase or maintain their political power by default.…\n\nBlog\n\nSwords Into Plowshares\n\nLast week, activists destroyed the Charlottesville, Virginia Robert E. Lee monument in secret. They said it was to prevent violence, but not their own. The Washington Post attended the event and documented the final moments for Lee's face. The iconoclasts fashioned it into a \"death mask\" and then melted it down, creating a haunting image captured by the Post's photographer.

Gillis is a known history buff that frequently brings up history in his stand up comedy and talk show appearances. Even though this particular conversation covered various topics, the most interesting part was his take on Stonewall Jackson’s mental health:…\n\nBlog\n\nConfederate Patton\n\nA review of Confederate Patton: Richard Taylor and the Red River Campaign, 2nd (Expanded) Edition (Columbia, SC: Shotwell Publishing, 2023), by Dr. Samuel W.

Most depictions show, in effect, that by psychological disposition, Madison was better suited to be a Hamiltonian Federalist than a Jeffersonian Republican. I offer a few illustrations. Merrill D. Peterson, in his Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation, states that Madison had a “more penetrating mind, sharp, probing, and persistent,” while…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Passing of Zippy\n\nWhen I first met Zippy he was a mature, chestnut-colored and very friendly male equine who had come to live with my neighbors. They had created an ample fenced-in, grassy pasture next to my property, plus a neat horse-shed where Zippy could both sleep or take safe refuge should the weather turn bad. Earlier this year Zippy reached the admirable…\n\nBlog\n\nYou Mean You Don’t Know?\n\nSunday afternoons were once meant for visiting all across The South. Sometimes family and sometimes friends, but the lazy Sunday afternoon visits, after church and then dinner, were a very important part of the connectedness that we all shared. And, by the way, dinner is the meal you ate at mid-day and supper the evening meal… just to set that…\n\nBlog\n\nCoffee, Waffles, and Gunsmoke\n\nThis morning I struck up a conversation with an old man over breakfast at the local Huddle House. He was sitting by himself drinking a cup of coffee.

In 1865 George Stoneman was a mediocre Union general leading cavalry behind Confederate lines in Virginia. 100 years later a Canadian rock band made him famous. It took Robbie Robertson more than six months to write the song. He spent time in libraries researching the end of the war. Many say it was an anti-war…\n\nBlog\n\nSayonara Aunt Jemima\n\nOver the past several decades, anything connected with the Confederacy, as well as much of Southern culture and heritage, have all been transformed from objects of American pride into nothing more than racist pariahs that must be blown away by the winds of woke social change and cancel culture. A prime example of such objects is Georgia-born writer Margaret Mitchell’s…\n\nBlog\n\nSecession: Where Does it Stop?\n\nA review of The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War (University of North Carolina Press, 2001) by Victoria E.

Such an effort can be considered even vaguely accurate only if and when the people being juxtaposed are of the same time period. In that case, at least, the circumstances surrounding them may be fairly equitable! But even that is not always…\n\nBlog\n\nDonald Davidson and the Tennessean’s Book Page\n\n“I can claim no ultimate wisdom in the matter.

These four new windows proudly proclaim NO and FOUL…\n\nBlog\n\nMaxcy Gregg, Scientist, Sportsman, Soldier\n\nWe survivors sometimes forget the human cost of our failed War of Southern Independence. The casualty rate for Confederate officers was about 25%. For Union officers it was 10 percent, easily replaced by incoming foreigners. The loss of talented men---future outstanding leaders, writers, scientists, artists, scholars, builders, clergy, entrepreneurs--- was very near catastrophic for the future of the South.

Just a month ago, National Review (the supposed Gray Lady of the Right) ran a piece by Yale’s Akhil Reed Amar entitled Declaring Independence from Thomas Jefferson. The piece is a paean to centralized power imbued with presentism as Amar virtue signals and plays the role of Pied Piper as…\n\nBlog\n\nThe Truth About Tariffs\n\nMost Civil War and Reconstruction Era historians dismiss Southern complaints about tariffs, both as a cause of the War and of postbellum Southern poverty. They contend that the only impact of the tariffs was to raise the price of domestic goods protected by such tariffs. The price inflation, they argue, affected all Americans, not just Southerners. Although most concede that the domestic…\n\nBlog\n\nJefferson Davis on Trial\n\nThe Boston Daily Adviser, July 25, 1865, stated exactly what was on the line: “If Jefferson Davis is innocent, then it is the government of the United States which is guilty; if secession has not been rebellion, then the North in stifling it as such, has committed a crime.” That the question was even asked tells us that the legality…\n\nBlog\n\nMy Dad was a Joker\n\nMy dad was a joker.
