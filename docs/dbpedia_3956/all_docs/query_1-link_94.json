        "text": "RUSHING\n\n(Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee)\n\nFIRST GENERATION\n\n1. Mathew[1] Rushing. Died, before 1730, in NC. The following information was supplied by Charles C. Rushing and appears in the \"Rushing Past\" newsletter, II(1), March 1980. \"Let's start with the Isle of Wight County, Virginia. 'Early Eighteenth Century Palatine Emigration' by Knittle (on Page 252) states that on the 2nd sailing from Holland to England then to Virginia, there was listed 23 May 1709 Mathys Riesin (German for Rushing) and Vrow (wife) and three children. Then on page 262 Mattys Russin -- they were of Protestant faith and could not worship as Protestants in Germany. In 'Seventeenth Century Isle of Wight Co. Virginia' by John Bennet Boddie, it states that Mattys Russian sold 150 acres to Wm Bridger in 1714. The Russians (Rushings) were living in an area overrun by Louis XIV of France and had escaped to Holland. There they were helped by Queen Anne of England who promised to take them to Virginia to settle there. In 'Lost Virginia Records' by Louis Des Cognets on Page 88, Mathew Rushin applied for 475 acres with a partner Edward Goodson. Russin sold his (or a part) to Wm. Bridger as stated above. This deed was dated 10 April 1707 (a little variation in the dates from the 'Palatine Migration' book). Mathys Rushin had to live on it for a period to get title; on 16 June 1714 he got title (page 190 of 'Lost Virginia Records'). Here is synopsis: 1707 Mathew Rushin applied for 475 acres; 1714 he received Patent.\" But this is only one theory about Rushing family origins. I am presenting it because it is a theory which at least presents documentary evidence. However, there are several other legends and theories on the origin of the family, the most widespread being that the family is Welsh. There is evidence for a James Rushing in New Kent County, Virginia, in 1667, and for a Mathew Rushing in Charles City County, Virginia, before 1670. The Rushings who settled in southern illinois, western Kentucky, and Tennessee came from Anson County, North Carolina. The Rushings in Anson County, North Carolina, seem to be very closely related, but working out the relationships between them is extremely difficult, particularly because there are so many William Rushings. I propose the following hypothesis. The Anson County Rushings seem to be descended from two near contemporary William Rushings. (A contemporary John Rushing lived near Thompson's Creek in the Chesterfield District of South Carolina.) To attempt to clarify the relationships I plotted probable locations of Rushing land grants and deeds. When this is done the Rushings fall into two subgoups. One group lived on Browns Creek near the present community of White Store, near Black Jack Creek. This group is associated with the elder and younger Joseph Whites in land grant and deed records. This group includes two Williams, Richard, Phillip, Soloman, and a John. The other group is found 5-10 miles farther south on Thompson's Creek, on the headwaters of Browns Creek, and on Little Browns Creek. This group includes two or more Williams, two or more Johns, a Mathew, Robert, Noah, and Abraham. They are associated in land grant and deed records with Benjamin Jackson and John Jackson. The breakdown is not exactly this simple, however, and some adjustments have to be made. Except for living near the southern Rushing group, Abraham is most closely tied to Richard, Solomon, and others in the northern group.\n\nHe married Elizabeth. Died, circa 1745. According to Virgil W. Huntley of Mystic Connecticut, who has studied deed records for the Rushing family in North Carolina, \"Mathew Rushing, father of William, had a wife, Elizabeth, as she acknowledges the sale of land to William Bridges or Bridgers on 15 July, 1718. \"Widow Elizabeth Rushing is said to have maried either Edwin or Edward Goodson as her 2nd husband. Elizabeth is said to have died about 1743 to 1747 leaving property to Goodson. A most dramatic will said to be filed by Goodson. Where is it?\" [Letter to David Donahue, July 19, 1992]\n\nVirgil W. Huntly also estimates that Mathew's son William had to have been born circa 1710 or earlier because he purchased his father's property in 1730. Neither of the William Rushings on Brown's Creek seem to be old enough to be the William, son of Mathew. Either or both might be grandsons. Children:\n\n2 i. William[2] Rushing.\n\n3 ii. William Rushing.\n\nSECOND GENERATION\n\n2. William[2] Rushing (Mathew, 1). Born, circa 1720. This William Rushing seems to have lived on Brown's Creek near Black Jack Branch, near the present community of White Store in Anson County. This William Rushing may have been the one who received land grant No. 6531 dated 19 April 1763 for 150 acres on both sides of Deep Creek--including his own improvement. He is mentioned in land grant No. 3092 dated 18 April 1771 to Josiah Herndon, Jr., for 200 Acres in Anson County on Black Jack Branch of Brown's Creek, joining William Rushing. Given the frequency of the name William and the absence of the name Mathew among descendants, the most likely name for a father of this William Rushing would be William.\n\nHe married an unknown woman. Children:\n\n4 i. Abraham[3] Rushing.\n\n5 ii. Phillip Rushing.\n\n6 iii. Richard Rushing.\n\niv. John Rushing. Born, circa 1750. John Rushing received Land Grant No. 4686 dated May 24, 1773, issued by Josiah Martin, Royal Governor of the Colony of North Carolina. The grant was for 150 acres in Anson County on the lower side of Brown's Creek, joining a hollow and William Rushing. This John is not in the 1790 census of Anson Co.\n\n7 v. William Rushing.\n\n8 vi. Jacob Rushing.\n\n9 vii. Solomon Rushing.\n\n3. William[2] Rushing (Mathew, 1). One William Rushing, the father of \"Flint River Jack\" Rushing, is said to have immigrated from the Isle of Wight County, Virginia, to Welsh Neck, Cheraw, South Carolina. This William is the most likely to have been father of Flint River Jack, but it seems unlikely that he lived in the Welsh Neck or even the Welsh Tract. However, this William owned land on Thompson's Creek and may have lived in what is now Chesterfield County, South Carolina. Most of his descendants seem to have lived in Anson County and are associated with the other Rushing group living there. This William Rushing seems to have been the one who received land grant No. 495 dated 13 October 1756, on Thompson's Creek. He is listed as William Ruskin. This William Rushing also received land grant No. 947 dated 26 May 1757 for 400 acres in Anson County of the S.W. side of Pee Dee river, joining the E. side of the N. fork of Thompson's Creek and crossing the creek twice. Most likely name for the father of this William Rushing would be John Rushing.\n\nHe married Mary?. Children:\n\ni. John[3] Rushing. Born, before 1753. Died, before 1790. He married Sabrina.\n\n10 ii. Robert Rushing.\n\n11 iii. Mark Rushing.\n\n12 iv. Unknown Daughter Rushing.\n\n13 v. William Rushing.\n\nvi. Noah Rushing. Born, circa 1758. Census: 1790, in Anson Co., NC. Census: 1810, in Christian Co., KY. He married Chloe Huntley. This Noah Rushing was an adult in 1778 when, with William Rushing Jr. and Benjamin Jackson, he was witness to a deed transferring 200 acres of land from William Rushing to Robert Rushing [Deed Book k, p. 470]. He may have died or moved before 1800 as the Noah in 1800 seems to be a younger individual. There is a Noah Rushing in Kentucky in the 1810 census who may have a son named Robert. There is a Noah Rushing in Warren Co., MS, in the 1820 census.\n\nvii. Rowland Rushing. Census: 1790, in Anson Co., NC.\n\nviii. Daughter (Sarah?) Rushing. She married William Johnson.\n\nTHIRD GENERATION\n\n4. Abraham[3] Rushing (William, 2). Born, circa 1742. Died, 1805, in Anson Co., NC. The birth date for Abraham Rushing is somewhat controversial. Several sources use 1730. I have been unable to determine if there is a factual basis for this or if this date is based on identifying the wrong Phillip (Revolutionary War veteran Phillip) for the son Phillip (probably the Phillip I. in the 1800 census) named in Abraham's will. Based on ages of Abraham's children other than Phillip, Abraham need not have been born before 1750. Land grant records indicate a probably birth date of 1740-1745. Abraham Rushing received land grant No. 6314 dated 15 November 1762 for 300 acres in Anson County on the North Fork of Thompson's Creek joining above John Jackson. Abraham Rushing received Land Grant No. 8814 dated July 25, 1774, and issued by Josiah Martin, Royal Governor of the Colony of North Carolina. The grant was for 150 acres in Anson County on the branches of Thompson's Creek, joining Thomas Creel and Rushing's own survey, between the two prongs of Thompson's Creek.\n\nHe married, first, Mariah Meador, daughter of Jason Meador. Children:\n\n14 i. William[4] Rushing.\n\n15 ii. Abraham Rushing.\n\niii. Elizabeth Rushing. Born, before 1775. Census: 1800, in Anson Co., NC. She married William Morgan. Elizabeth Morgan is mentioned in the will of Abraham Rushing in 1806. It seems most likely that Elizabeth was the wife of William Morgan, the only Morgan in the Anson County census in 1800 and 1810. The Morgans in Decatur and Henderson counties, TN, may be descended from this family.\n\n16 iv. Jason Rushing.\n\n17 v. Peter Rushing.\n\nvi. Sarah Rushing. She married Unknown English.\n\n18 vii. Phillip J. Rushing.\n\n19 viii. Thomas M. Rushing.\n\nHe married, second, Sarah Watts.\n\n5. Phillip[3] Rushing (William, 2). Born, circa 1745. Died, after 1840, in Perry Co., TN. Birth(2): 1756. Census: 1790, in Anson Co., NC. Census: 1820, in Perry Co., TN.\n\nTwo major myths about this Phillip Rushing create difficulties for a Rushing family researchers. Myth 1: Burrell (1798-1867) was the son of Phillip. This is based by looking at one datum point -- that there was a veteran or pensioneer named Phillip Rushing in the household of Burrell in 1840 in Perry County, Tennessee -- and ignoring a great deal of other information, including Phillip's age in the same census. (This is discussed in more detail below.) In general, because of the close associations between the families of Burrell and Isaac, Burrell and Isaac must have been brothers, but census data will not support both to be sons of Phillip.\n\nMyth 2: The Revolutionary War veteran Phillip was the son of the Abraham Rushing who died in 1805 in Anson County, North Carolina. Phillip could have been slightly older than the Abraham who died in 1805 as Phillip needed to have been born circa 1745 to be father of the Phillip Rushing Jr. in the 1790 census. Without having to be father of the Revolutionary War veteran Phillip, Abraham needs only to have been born about 1750. The myth of Phillip has pushed the estimated ages of Abraham Rushing and some of Abraham's children back in time unnecessarily. For example, I have seen 1750 given as a possible birth date for Abraham's daughter Elizabeth Morgan. No one seems to know her husband's name. Census data in Anson County, North Carolina and Henderson, Perry, and Decatur Counties, Tennessee otherwise indicate that she was the wife of William Morgan, that she was born circa 1773 or 1774, and that her own children were born from circa 1795 to circa 1813. Elizabeth probably was two or three years older than her husband.\n\nSome descendants of Abraham are needlessly looking for an earlier marriage for Abraham as Abraham's wife Mariah Meador would have too young to be the mother of children born as early as 1750 as the wrong dates suggest. The acceptance of this myth seems odd to me because Phillip's pension claim names Richard as his brother and Richard is not a name of one of Abraham's children. The Philip who appears as Philip I. in 1800, the yonger Phillip in 1810, and as Philep J. in 1820 seems a more likely choice as son of Abraham.\n\nUnfortunately, these myths are contained in an accepted application to join the Daughters of the American Revolution, and theDAR itselp seems to be distributing the misinformation.\n\nIn his pension claim in 1834, Phillip Rushing states he had been in Tennessee for 18 years.\n\nA military marker has been erected for Phillip Rushing at Rushing Grove Cemetery in Decatur County. The dates on the marker are 1756-1838. This location probably is incorrect. Phillip seems to have still been alive at the time of the census in 1840. He is listed in the household of Burrell Rushing. Burrell at this time is living south of Rushing Creek, near the Bath Springs area surrounded by various Brashers. So it is probable that this was Phillip's property and not Burrell's. (Burrell did not buy land on Turkey Creek near Rushing Grove until the 1840s, though descendants claim this was the land Burrell settled in about 1820. Burrell's property adjoined Richard's property to the east). A more likely place for Phillip to be buried then would be in an old cemetery in the Rushing Creek area (Brigance, Ivey, Minie perhaps) or in the Brasher Cemetery. For the sake of argument, a case could be made that Phillip and Richard are buried at Campground Cemetery. There is no evidence to suggest that Rushing Grove Cemetery is older than the mid 1850s when Henry Harrington may have been buried there.\n\nThe birth date used on the military marker at Rushing Grove Cemetery is 1756. This is the based on an age of 78 sworn to by witnesses in Phillip Rushing's pension claim in 1834. However, in the pension claim Phillip himself admits that his memory is failing. And while Phillip mentions that there is proof of his age in a family bible in the posession of his brother Richard, court records never indicate that the bible was produced in court. In the census in Anson County in 1800 Phillip already is listed as 45 and over. He probably was born nearer 1745 as in 1790 Philip Rushing, Jr., is already listed as the head of a family and seems to have two children. The Phillip in the 1840 census with Burrell is age 78 (born circa 1762). Either this is a different Phillip or Burrell has no idea of Phillip's correct age. The death year 1838 on the military marker seems to have been taken from Phillip's the pension papers and may come from a note from the Treasury indicating that Phillip's pension had been paid through that date. There is such a note in the pension papers for Richard Rushing with the same closing date. Richard Rushing is known to have lived until 1841.\n\nPhillip Rushing may have outlived all his children. Perry County Circuit Court Records in 1838 include a petition by grandson Calvin Lacy to be replaced as Phillip's guardian. Calvin Lacy was relatively wealthy and did not have any children, so he would have been a neutral choice among Phillip's competing grandchildren to be Phillip's guardian. If the Phillip with Burrell in 1840 is the Revolutionary War veteran, then Burrell most likely is his guardian.\n\nCensus data for Phillip in 1790 in Anson County show 3 males under 16 and 2 free white females, plus Phillip Jr. in a separate household. Data for Phillip in 1800 in Anson County: 22101-00301. I think that the 1790 census is closest to being correct for Phillip's family. I think he had at most four sons and perhaps four or five daughters, with two or more daughters having married before 1790. Decatur county Rushing claimants for descent from Phillip often use 1820 Perry County census data to show children born circa 1799. Yet a comparison 1790 and 1800 data seems to show that a married daughter (or, perhaps, a daughter-in-law) and family moved into Phillip's household in the interval, and the same thing may have happened between 1800 and 1810. The young children in Phillip's household in 1820 are more likely to be grandchildren than children. (Census data -- 1790 Anson County: 1-3-3; 1800 Anson County: 22101-00301; 1810 Anson County: 11001-11101; 1820 Perry County: 010101-01001). Phillip's sons seems more likely to some of the Rushings in Stewart County, Tennessee. It is possible that Phillip was the grandfather of Richard Rushing in McNairy County in 1850, and it is possible that he was father or father-in-law of one of the Mark Rushings in Perry County in 1830.\n\nPhillip Rushing received Land Grant No. 8510 dated July 23, 1774, and issued by Josiah Martin, Royal Governor of the Colony of North Carolina. The grant was for 400 acres in Anson County on the southwest side of the Great Pee Dee, on Great Brown's Creek, joining a bottom by the creek near the muddy spring branch.\n\nThe following is text of the pension application of Philip Rushing. His pension application number was S21458.\n\n\"Perry County, July Term 1834 -- On this 21st day of July 1834 personally appeared before the Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions for the County of Perry PHILIP RUSHING a resident of Rushing's Creek in Perry County, State of Tennessee, aged 78 years, who being first sworn acording to law doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of act of Congress passed June the 7th 1832 that he entered service of the United States under the following named officers and served as herein after stated.\n\n\"This declarent entered the service of the United States under Captain John Jackson he declarent being the Ensign of said company in Anson County in the State of North Carolina, from thence marched to Gilbert Town N. Carolina, from thence to Pleasant Garden at the head of the Catawber, from thence into the Indian Nation on the Hiwassee River, from thence to the Valley Towns where some of our men were out fowling and Indians came upon them and killed three of them, one of whose names was Turner he believes; from thence was marched home by way of Pleasant garden, declared served his tour the term of three months as Ensign, he declarent thinks his tour was performed in the latter end of the year 1776, but owing to old age he cannot recollect precisily his Major's name was Davidson, Col. David Love (or Lane) his Col., and general Rutherford was his General.\n\n\"This declarent again volunteered under Captain Stephen Jackson in the year 1777, and was imployed on the frontiers guarding the property of whigs and their lives from Ruthless hands of the Torys and British. He served this year seven months as a volunteer guarding the frontiers--again in the year 1778 he volunteered under the same Captain and was imployed on the same service that is ranging along the frontiers; in these several last tours he dose not recollect particularly owing to old age and the consequent loss of memory the events of this period of his services as he did not charge his memory with minor events but in fact he nearly always was out in the service of his country from the year 1776 up to this time which was 1780.\n\n\"The declarent in the year 1781 entered the service under Capt. Bogan, Col. Wade his Colonel; declarent was marched from Anson County N. Carolina to Cape Fear where he was attached to Colo. Smith's Regiment and to capt. Smith's Company; his declarents own Capt. and Col. having left the army. This tour we had an engagement with the Tories on Capefear not far from Wilmington and defeated them after which we marched up and attached the British in a large Brick house some time not long after this we heard that Cornwallis was defeated at Little York & went home. This declarent states that on this Tour he served two months. He has no documentary evidence by which he can prove his service nor does he know of any person except Richard Rushing by whom he can prove the same, he hereby relinquishes any claim whatever to a pension or annuity except the present and declares that his name is not on the pension roll of the agency of any state sworn to and subscribed the day and year above written.

I was on Cape Fear River near Wilmington when we defeated the Tories who had defeated Col. Wade at Drowning Creek. I was also in an attack on the Brick House in the possession of the British and after several fire we retired being unable to take the House. I was in the company of Stephen Jackson a part of the time, and a part of the time I was in the company of Capt. John Johnson and at sometime transfered to some other company in Col.

Children:\n\n20 i. Phillip R.[4] Rushing.\n\n21 ii. Hardy Rushing.\n\n22 iii. Hannah Rushing.\n\niv. Elijah Rushing. Born, circa 1775. Census: 1800, in Anson Co., NC. An Elijah Rushing served as security for Eljiah Lowry, appointed in 1816 as guardian of the minor children of Phillip Rushing, deceased, in Steward Co., TN. He may be the household listed in the 1820 census of Stewart Co., TN, with the head of household listed as \"Elizabeth.\" The household one male under 10, one male 26-45, and no females.\n\n23 v. Millie Rushing.\n\nvi. Other Children. Another likely son for this Phillip would be the Richard Rushing in Livingston Co., Kentucky in the 1810 census (born 1785 or earlier). The possibility that one of Phillip's daughters (born ca. 1777 or earlier) married Mark Rushing who lived in Hardin Co., TN, should be considered. A Burwell Rushing who would have been an adult in 1808 appears in Anson Co., North Carolina, property records. A more speculative possibility for a daughter of Phillip Rushing would be the wife (name unknown, born early 1780s) of the Robery Ivy who settled on Rushing Creek in Perry Co. (later Decatur Co.), Tennessee.\n\n6. Richard[3] Rushing (William, 2). Born, 1749, in VA. Died, 1841, in Perry Co., TN. Burial in Campground Cem., Decatur Co., TN (unmarked). Richard Rushing received two land grants issued by Josiah Martin, Royal Governor of the Colony of North Carolina. The first, No. 3853 dated May 22, 1772, was for 100 acres in Anson County on a branch on the lower side of Brown's Creek, joining the said branch above Wm. Rushing. The second, No. 7487 dated March 4, 1775, was for 150 acres in Anson County on the lower side of Brown's Creek, joining a small branch and Solomon Rushing. Richard Rushing moved to the Beech River area of Perry County (later Decatur County) in Tennessee before 1820 and settled on the south side of the Beech River. He had extensive land holdings in the 7th and 8th sections of the 8th range along Turkey Creek. He probably is the ancestor of most of the Rushings living in Henderson County.\n\nThe following is a summary of the pension claim of Richard Rushing. It was written in a letter dated July 31, 1930, by B. W. Morgan, Acting Commissioner of Pensions, to Miss Edna Rushing, Sacramento, California.\n\n\"You are advised that it appears from the papers in the Revolutionary War pension claim, [S. or 8.] 21457, that Richard Rushing was born in 1849 in Virginia 'on [the] Roanoke'. \"While residing in Anson County, North Carolina he served with the North Carolina troops, as follows:\n\n\"In 1776, three months in Captain John Jackson's Company, was in a skirmish at Drowning Creek where his brother William was wounded and soon after died; in 1777, nine months in Captain Stephen Jackson's Company; in 1778, ten months in the same company; in 1779, eight months in the same company; in 1780, six months in the same company. A part of the time he served in Colonel Wade's Regiment.\n\n\"He was in skirmishes on Black river, Bates Bridge, Lynch's Creek, Richardson's Creek and Thompson's Creek. \"He was allowed pension on his application executed July 21, 1834, at which time he was living in Rushing Creek, Perry County, Tennessee, having lived there fifteen years.\n\n\"He stated that his brother Philip served with him most of the time.\n\n\"There is no reference to wife or children.\"\n\nThere is little proof of Richard's family, and the family presented in this database is somewhat of a composit. Richard seems to have had at least nine sons (including probably David in a separate household) and two daughters in the 1800 census of Anson County. There is proof that David, Willis, and Amy Boatwright were children of Richard. Dennis and Willis are always said to have been brothers, and the elder and younger Richard are in the same household in the 1840 census (based on ages children in the 1850 census). This is \"Richard's family.\"\n\nThen there is \"Sarah's family.\" Sarah Rushing appears as age 80 in the household of Burrell Rushing, born ca. 1821, from the 1850 census. Her family includes Elijah, Isaac, and Burrell (born 1789). Phillip's wife is known from a deed to have been named Hannah, so Sarah could not have been his wife. Sarah seems to have been living in William Rushing's household in the 1830 census. Between 1830 and 1840 Elijah Rushing and his wife appear to have died. Sarah (listed as Sally) appears as head of a household in the 1840 census; this probably is Elijah's household, including Burrell (born 1821). This young Burrell has money by the mid 1840s when he buys a large amount of land, buys slaves, and builds a mansion which is still a local landmark. Where did the money come from? The best explaination would that Sarah inherited a larger widow's portion of Richard's estate and financed the acquistions of her grandson Burrell with whom she had been living for several years.\n\nHe married, first, Unknown Daughter Rushing (12), circa 1778. Children:\n\n24 i. David[4] Rushing.\n\n25 ii. Asa Rushing.\n\n26 iii. Dennis Rushing.\n\n33 iv. Amy Rushing.\n\nHe married, second, Sarah (Sally), before 1791. Born, circa 1770, in Anson Co., NC. Died, circa 1852, in Decatur Co., TN. Census: 1840, in Perry Co., TN. Census: 1850, in Decatur Co., TN. There is a Sarah Rushing living in the household of Burrell Rushing (b. c1821) in 1850. In 1840 as Sally she is listed as head of what appears to be the same household. She probably is the wife of Richard Rushing even though she is in a separate household in 1840. She would be a second wife of Richard as she is not old enough to have been the mother of David Rushing. The placement of the second marriage in the age gap between Dennis and Richard is arbitrary, although given her association with Burrell, son of Elijah, this age gap seems more appropriate than the later age gap between Willis and D. M. All birth dates for these children are estimated. Should Willis prove older than Elijah, this second marriage probably would fall between. Available information would tend to support Willis to be of the first marriage.\n\nWhat may have happened is that Elijah (and perhaps his wife) died before 1840, as Elijah is not in the 1840 census but his children are. Sarah might have moved into the household to care for the minor children, while the by now very elderly Richard remained in his own household with the family of his son Richard. Children:\n\n27 v. Richard Rushing.\n\n28 vi. Elijah Rushing.\n\n29 vii. Willis Rushing.\n\n30 viii. D. M. (Daniel??) Rushing.\n\n31 ix. Burrell Rushing.\n\n32 x. Isaac Rushing.\n\n7. William[3] Rushing (William, 2). Born, circa 1755. Died, 1776, in Drowning Creek, Anson Co., NC. The following sketch of William Rushing appears in the \"Rushing Past\" newsletter dated September 1981. \"William Rushing was a young man growing up in Anson County in the 1760's when most of his father's relatives and friends were openly advocating disolving all the ties with mother England due to the harsh, unreasonable and unjust treatment of the people of the Carolina colony. Most of William's friends and neighbors openly supported this open break. Being honorable men, the Rushings and their neighbors put their grievance in writing in a petition they signed and addressed to then Gov. Tryon. No sooner had these brave men delivered their petition than they were labeled rebels and outlaws by the English. Several of these men were hung for pursuing American Independence! English troops and militia were sent into Anson County to \"keep the peace\" and arrest \"rebels\" and their sympathisers. Armed Tory militia began military operations in the county. Many civilians were killed in these para-military operations. William and his neighbors took up arms to protect themselves, their families and their neighbors from these armed vigilantes. From 1768 to 1776, William fought in 19 major engagements with Tory and English troops in North and South Carolina. He was wounded on at least one other occasion. Finally, in the company of his brothers Richard and Phillip he fought in the battle of Drowning Creek in Anson County. He was mortally wounded. His brothers carried him to his parents home where he died. Owing to the circumstances of his death, his family could not give William a public funeral since to do so would be to invite the arrest of his family as \"rebels\" and harsh reprisals from the Tories. As with other patriots who were killed before the United States declared its Independence, William was buried in a secluded spot now lost in time.\"\n\nThis sketch seems to confuse the William who was killed at Drowning Creek other Williams in the same area. The William Rushing who died at Drowning Creek may have been the youngest son of his father and far too young to have been caught up in the Regulator movement. Nor is there any evidence that this William's family was in any way at outs with the colonial government as they received numerous land grants issued by the Royal Governor during the 1770s. This seems to have been the William Rushing who received Land Grant No. 8509 dated July 23, 1774, issued by Josiah Martin, Royal Governor of the Colony of North Carolina. The grant was for 150 acres in Anson County, on the southwest side of the Pee Dee River, joining a hill near Rushing Creek and near Talton's Creek, which is a branch of Thompson's Creek.\n\nHe married Unknown. Children:\n\ni. William[4] Rushing. Born, circa 1775. Census: 1800, in Anson Co., NC. This is the younger of the two William Rushing Juniors listed in the 1800 census in Anson County, North Carolina.\n\n8. Jacob[3] Rushing (William, 2). Born, circa 1760. Census: 1790, in Anson Co., NC. Census: 1840, in Madison Co., TN. Jacob Rushing appears in the 1783 petition to move the courthouse for Anson County. He appears in a sequence of signatures which goes Abraham Rushing, Phillip Rushing, Thomas Wright, John Willis, Isaac Jackson, Thomas Meador, Jason Meador, Richard Rushing, Robert Rushing, Jacob Rushing. According to Barbara Crumpton of Duncan Oklahoma, who has researched Jacob to the extent available records allow, in Anson County legal transactions Jacob Rushing is associated with either Abraham Rushing or one of the families allied to Abraham Rushing (e.g., Mobberly, Meador). Records for Madison County do not show if Jacob Rushing died there or moved on and do not indicate what happened to the property Jacob owned there.

Phillip[4] Rushing.\n\n9. Solomon[3] Rushing (William, 2). Died, 1811, in Anson Co., NC.\n\nSolomon Rushing received Land Grant No. 4116 issued January 22, 1773 by Josiah Martin, Royal Governor of the Colony of North Carolina. The grant was for 200 acres on the southwest side of the Pee Dee River, joining the bank of a small drain on the north side of Richard Rushing branch on Brown's Creek. Solomon's will specifically names daughters Mary Ann and Susanny. It also clearly indicates that he has other children. Paul Rushing and Stephen Rushing, executors of his estate, and John Rushing and Mathew Rushing, the witnesses to the will, probably are Solomon's sons.\n\nHe married Elizabeth. Children:\n\ni. Solomon[4] Rushing. This Solomon was age 16-26 and living in his father's household in 1810.\n\nii. Mathew Rushing. Census: 1810, in Anson Co., NC. This Mathew Rushing may have moved to Alabama.\n\niii. Mary Ann Rushing.\n\niv. Susanna Rushing.\n\nv. Stephen Rushing. Census: 1810, in Anson Co., NC. This probably is the Stephen Rushing whose family moved to Sumpter Co., Alabama.\n\nvi. Paul Rushing. Born, circa 1780. Died, before 1860. Census: 1810, in Anson Co., NC. Census: 1850, in Anderson Co., TX. Paul Rushing lived on Black Jack Creek. He may have left Anson County circa 1820 as noted by the following deed in the Anson County deed books: \"THIS INDENTURE made the 15th. day of January in the year of our Lord 1820 between Paul Rushing of the County of Anson & State of North Carolina of the one part and Moses Moore of the same county and state of the other part.

Census: 1820, in Anson Co., NC.\n\nRobert Rushing received Land Grant No. 4197 issued January 22, 1773, by Josiah Martin, Royal Governor of the Colony of North Carolina. The grant was for 150 acres in Anson County on the lower side of Little Brown Breek, joining William's line, north of Haw Branch and a point near Johnston's line. In 1778 Robert Rushing received land on Brown's Creek from William Rushing (Anson County Deed Book K, p. 470) \"...the said William Rushing for diverse good causes and considerations him thereunto moving but more especially for and in consideration of the natural love and affection he bearith towards the said Rubert Rushing....\" Witnesses were William Rushing, Jr., Noah Rushing, and Benjamin Jackson.\n\nThe heirs of Robert Rushing are shown in two deeds. The first is recorded in Union County Deed Book 4. \"This indenture made this 16th day of Nov in the year of our Lord Eighteen hundred and thirty six between Joseph Rushing, William Deason & Milly Rushing of Bedford County and Nancy Rushing of Perry County Sarah Rushing William Rushing and Robert Rushing of Benton County and all of the State of Tennessee Heirs and legatees of Robert Rushing Dec'd of the one part and William M.

Mark[3] Rushing (William, 3). Born, circa 1770, in NC. Died, before 1850, in Hardin Co., TN?. Census: 1840, in Hardin Co., TN.\n\nIn general, there seems to be an affinity between the various Marks and the family of the Rev. War veteran Phillip. Mark Rushing's first wife may have been a daughter of Phillip Rushing. There were two Mark Rushings in Perry Co., TN, in 1830. This may have been one of them. Census data for Hardin Co., TN, 1840: 012020001-00012001.\n\nHe married Mary. Born, circa 1782, in NC. Census: 1850, in Hardin Co., TN. Children:\n\ni. Susan[4] Rushing. Born, circa 1816.

Census: 1800, in Anson Co., NC.\n\nThis is the William Rushing, Jr., of the 1790 census in Anson County, North Carolina, and the elder of the two William Rushing Juniors in the 1800 census in Anson County.\n\nThe following is a deed recorded on page 272 of Anson County Deed Book H:\n\n\"To all people to whom these presents shall come I William Rushing of the State of North Carolina in the County of Anson, PLANTER, for and in consideration of the love and and good will and affection which I have and do bear towards my son William Rushing of the same state and county have given and grant & by these presents do freely give and grant unto the said William Rushing his heirs executors or administrators all and singular about fifty acres of land taken from my survey of four hundred acres beginning at a black walnut by the fork of the little creek & running near a north course to another line of which (before the signing of these presents) I have delivered him the said William Rushing an inventory signed with my own hand bearing date 1781 to have and to hold all the said land to him the said William Rushing his heirs executors or administrators from henceforth to be his property asolutely without any manner of condition in witness whereof I hereunto set my hand & seal the seventeenth day of August one thousand seven hundred and eighty one signed sealed and delivered in presence of Joseph Friffeth [Griffeth?] Noah Rushing. Wm. Rushing (seal).\n\n\"January Cot. 1782 then the within deed was acknowledged by William Rushing Sen.\" [Transcription made by Virgil W. Huntley, Mystic, CT.]\n\nHe married an unknown woman. Children:\n\n41 i. Richard[4] Rushing.\n\nFOURTH GENERATION\n\n14. William[4] Rushing (Abraham, 4). Born, 1771. Died, 1856. Birth(2): 1786. This is a composit family which probably should be considered speculative. Two lines of Rushings claim descendant from the William Rushing who married Elizabeth Tilghman and both claim that this William was a son of Abraham Rushing. Identifying that particular William as the son of Abraham is speculative. Descendants of Laben Rushing in Kaufman Co., TX, list William's birth date as 1786. The William who was son of Abraham would be older because he received a deed of gift from his father in 1789.\n\nSusan Knight Gore of Memphis who researches the family of Clement Rushing considers Clement Rushing and Laben Rushing to have been brothers and echos the claim of descent from William Rushing, son of Abraham and husband of Elizabeth Tilghman.\n\nAnother brother is Mark, who was guardian of Clement Rushing's minor children. As the Mark in the 1850 census in the part of Stewart County which later became Houston County was born before the 1801 marriage of William Rushing and Elizabeth Tilghman, the Mark used as brother here is the Mark who died in Humphreys Co. circa 1847.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Tilghman, daughter of John Tilghman and Sarah Eggarton, 12 Mar 1801. Born, 1781. Children:\n\n42 i. Clement[5] Rushing.\n\nii. Mark Rushing. Born in NC. Died, circa 1847, in Humphreys Co., TN.\n\niii. Laben Rushing. Born, 1812, in NC. Died, after 1870. Census: 1840, in Sumter Co., AL. Census: 1860, in Scott Co., MS. He married Rosanna Harrell. Laben Rushing was in Sumter Co., AL, in 1840 and 1850 and in Scott Co., MS, in 1860 and 1870. Some of his descendants moved to Kaufman Co., TX. His family is outlined in \"History of Kaufman County, Texas.\"\n\n15. Abraham[4] Rushing (Abraham, 4). Born, 1772. Died, 1848, in Humphreys Co., TN. Census: 1820, in Rutherford Co., TN.\n\nThe following information is from a sketch of Abraham Rushing 1772-1848 by Bill Medling which appears in \"Rushing Past,\" III(2), June 1981.\n\n\"We know that Abraham lived in Anson Co., N.C., and that he was born in 1772, came to Tenn. in or before 1810. On 4 Dec., 1810, he and his wife, Celia (Cealy) joined Garrison Fork Baptist Church by letter. . . . Garrison Fork Church is near Beech Grove.\n\n\"In 1813, Sister Ceiley Rushing was found 'faulty' and excluded from the church. She and Abraham were later divorced. In 1815, Abraham Rushing was also excluded from the church for marrying a 2nd wife & his first wife was still living. New we learn from Cuz Betty Riley whom I obtained many of these facts, that Abraham bought land in Stewart Co. in 1832, moved to that county in 1834, being accompanied by an Abel Rushing.\"\n\nAbraham lived in White Oak Creek section of Stewart County which was later transferred back to Humphreys County. His will was probated and his estate was settled in Humphreys County. Abraham is the ancestor of many Rushings in the White Oak Creek section of Hemphreys County, Tennessee. Through his son John, he also is ancestor of the Rushings living around Rutherford and Cannon Counties, Tennessee.\n\nThis Abraham seems to have had one son and four daughters born before 1800 and two additional sons and two additional daughters born before 1810. The list of the children Abraham is partially based on the work of Bill Medlin mentioned above.\n\nHe married, first, Celia. Divorce, circa 1814. Children:\n\n43 i. John[5] Rushing.\n\nii. Nancy Rushing. Born, circa 1795. Census: 1850, in Humphreys Co., TN. She married Unknown Dunlap. In this 1850 census she is listed as guardian of Caroline Rushing and Philander Rushing.\n\niii. Joel Rushing. Born, circa 1796. Census: 1850, in Anson Co., NC. This Joel is in Francis Thomas' list of children of Abraham Rushing Jr. However, this Joel Rushing's age and location in Anson Co., TN, seem to be in conflict with Abraham Rushing Jr.'s move to Tennessee by 1810.\n\niv. Abel Rushing. Born, circa 1800. Census: 1830, in Stewart Co., TN. Census: 1840, in Humphreys Co., TN. Census data for Abel Rushing, Humphreys Co., TN, 1840: 1111001-0010001.\n\nHe married, second, Elizabeth Powell, circa 1815. Children:\n\n44 v. William Wilson Rushing.\n\n45 vi. R. (Rowland?) B. Rushing.\n\nvii. Willis Rushing. Born, before 1820. Died, circa 1846. Census: 1840, in Houston Co., TN. This Willis Rushing is age 20-30 in the 1840 census and seems to have a wife and one son under 5. He died befor 1846 and Abraham Rushing received letters of administration of his estate which made provisions for his widow and family. He had a daughter Eliza A. Rushing (Elizabeth Crosswell was appointer her guardian).\n\n46 viii. David Rushing.\n\nix. Caroline Rushing. Born, circa 1830.\n\nx. Elizabeth Rushing. Born, circa 1831.\n\n47 xi. George W.

Census: 1800, in Anson Co., NC.\n\nHe married Alice Gulledge, daughter of William Gulledge and Bathsheba. Children:\n\ni. Malachi[5] Rushing. Born, 5 Jun 1798. This Malachi Rushing is said to have been the William M. Rushing in Anson County who purchased the Robert Rushing estate. The Malachi Rushing in Perry County, TN, in 1830 probably was a son of one of the Mark Rushings.\n\nii. Lucie Rushing. Born, 30 Mar 1800.\n\niii. Asa Rushing. Born, 25 Dec 1801, in Cherah Hill, Anson Co., NC. Died, 15 Oct 1851, in Decatur Co., TN. Burial in New Hope Cem., Decatur Co., TN. Census: 1850, in Decatur Co., TN. Occupation: Planter. He married Nancy G. Hendricks, 1825, in Anson Co., NC. Asa Rushing visited Perry County, Tennessee, in 1824, but returned to Anson County, North Carolina, where he married Nancy G. Hendricks. In 1827 he moved to Perry County (later Decatur County), Tennessee, and settled on the south side of Beech River about three miles west of Decaturville. He is listed in the 1850 census as owning 400 acres of land in Decatur County. He is known to have been a surveyor. He was a charter member of New Hope Baptist Church.\n\niv. Nancy Rushing. Born, 8 Oct 1803.\n\n49 v. Joel Rushing.\n\nvi. Mary Rushing. Born, 7 Feb 1808.\n\nvii. Matilda Rushing. Born, 14 Dec 1809.\n\nviii. Barsheba Rushing. Born, 3 Mar 1812.\n\n50 ix.

Census: 1840, in Anson Co., NC. Census: 1850, in Union Co., NC. Occupation: Veterinarian. He married Penelope Deese.\n\nxii. Elijah James Rushing. Born, 8 Sep 1820. Died, 1885. Burial in Faulks Bapt. C., Union Co., NC. He married Elizabeth Thomas.\n\n17. Peter[4] Rushing (Abraham, 4). Born, circa 1785, in Anson Co., NC. Census: 1820, in Bedford Co., TN. Census: 1840, in Calloway Co., KY.\n\nThe family of Peter is based on tentative conclusions and speculations of descendant Lee Rushing of Port Charles, Florida, outlined in letters dated January 26 and May 27, 1993, to David Donahue, and on the research of the late Georgia Maxwell Cox, Ozark, Illinois. Peter seems to have six sons, two daughters, and a wife in the 1820 census. Census data in 1830 in Bedford Co., Tennessee: 21113001-1101201.\n\nHe married Hester Frizzell, daughter of Nathan Frizzell and Ruahama Weaver, circa 1803, in Anson Co., NC. Born, 23 Dec 1785, in Anson Co., TN. Died, before 1840. This is going out on a limb. This wife of Peter Rushing is unknown. The Hester Frizzell born in 1785, daughter of Nathan Frizzell and Ruahama, is said to have been the first wife of Nathan Rushing. However, Hester Frizzell would be over 20 years older than Nathan Rushing based on his age in the 1860 census and would seem far too old to be mother of the children of Nathan Rushing's first marriage who were born 1826-1834. Dates, names, and locations would fit better if Hester Frizzell is used as mother rather than wife of Nathan Rushing. Children:\n\n51 i. Nathaniel (Nathan)[5] Rushing.\n\nii. Lucinda Rushing. She married Ezekiel L. Bevin, 15 May 1828, in Calloway Co., KY.\n\n52 iii. Alfred Rushing.\n\n53 iv. Frances H. (Fanny) Rushing.\n\n54 v. William L. (Lewis?) Rushing.\n\n55 vi. Milton M. Rushing.\n\nvii. Preston Rushing. This is one of two names said by tradition to be children of Peter Rushing. Another is Philander, though in the case of Philander it is most likely to be a confusion of Peter's son-in-law Philander Yandell. There is a Preston Rushing in Saline County, Arkansas, in 1860. There is another Preston Rushing (1844-1862) at the Old Zion Cemetery, Pope Co., IL, apparently son of Abraham Rushing (1818-1862).\n\n56 viii. Abraham D. Rushing.\n\n57 ix. Payton Calvin Rushing.\n\n18. Phillip J.[4] Rushing (Abraham, 4). Born, circa 1777, in Anson Co., NC. Census: 1820, in Anson Co., NC. Resided: 1830, in Humphreys Co., TN. Census: 1850, in Stewart Co., TN.\n\nThis is the Philip I. Rushing in 1800 in Anson County, the younger Philip Rushing in 1820, and Philep J. Rushing in 1820. In 1817, Peniah and Phillip J. Rushing sign as heirs in the selling of the estate of Thomas Gaddy, Sr., to Wm. Dismukes (Anson County Deed Book S, p. 297). The family proposed for Phillip in this database is hypothetical. It consists of the William Rushing with whom Phillip is living in 1850 in Stewart Co., TN, plus the Darling Rushing in the adajacent household. Then there is the J. J. Rushing in Benton Co. whose descendants think was descended from Phillip J. Rushing. Added to this is the John D. Rushing in Benton Co., TN, in 1850 whose ancestry has not been proven, who fits census data for the family of Phillip J. Rushing, and whose son Francis Marrion Rushing is buried in the same Williamson Co., IL, cemetery as J. J. Rushing's son James Darling Rushing. John D. and Jonathan J. appear on the same page of the Benton Co., TN, census in 1840. Added to this is the Roland Rushing in Benton Co., TN, in 1850, who may have a son named Darling Rushing. In the Dennis Rushing family Roland Rushing is stated to be a son of Phillip J. Rushing, but it is also claimed that Phillip J. Rushing was the Rev. War Veteran Phillip Rushing (Roland is too young). The Abraham Rushing is is here because of name and age fit only, and to place a loose family line somewhere that makes sense. This connection is far shakier than others. Personally, I prefer to think of the Darling Rushing, age 22, in 1850, as a grandson and the Darling Rushing, age 48, sheriff of Union Co., NC, as son of this Phillip Rushing.

The vertical file at the Crittenden County Public Library in Marion, KY, contains family group sheets for Thomas Rushing, Wilson E. Rushing, and several of Wilson E. Rushing's children. To Gertrude Rushing's list of the children of Thomas I added Margaret and Andrew E. based on the 1850 census.\n\nHe married Elizabeth. Born, circa 1787. Died, before 1870, in Bedford Co., TN.

Census: 1800, in Anson Co., NC.\n\nBy comparing the three Philip/Phillip Rushings in Anson County from 1790 to 1820, especially be comparing their ages and the ages of their children, it seems most likely that the Philip Rushing Jr. in the census in 1790 must have been the Phillip to purchase land in Stewart County, Tennessee, in 1812. Census data, Anson County, 1800: 5201-101. This shows two sons born before 1790 and five more (including Reuben and Larkin) born before 1800. This Phillip was in Stewart County in 1808 when he lived on Guices Creek and served in Captain Wardens co. of the militia.\n\nIn 1814 Isaac Lanier and later John Bailey were administrators of the estate. An inventory for the estate was returned May 2, 1814.\n\nIn 1816 the court appointed Elijah Lowry as guardian of the ophan children of Phillip Rushing deceased, naming Reuben, Larkin, Betsy, Anna, and Jemima. Elijah Rushing and Lewis Brewer were securities to the guardianship.\n\nIn February 1818 40 acres of Phillip's estate were conveyed to Mark Cooper.\n\nHe married Jemima. Children:\n\n70 i. John P.

The parents of Hardy Rushing are unknown. In this database Hardy Rushing is assigned as a son of the Revolutionary War veteran Phillip Rushing. This is based largely on the estimated date of his birth. Also, the majority of Hardy Rushing's first family left Stewart Co. area, as did most or all of the family of Phillip Rushing Jr. Names for children of Hardy Rushing's second marriage are similar to those found in the among Rushings from the Little Brown's Creek/Thompson Creek area of Anson Co. Could Hardy Rushing's second wife Elizabeth also be a Rushing?\n\nHardy Rushing appears in the 1820 census in Stewart Co., TN. He was married twice. The 1800 census in Anson County, NC, showshim married with a son and a daughter under 10. In the 1810 census, he appears to have three sons under 10, one son 10-16, and two daughters under 10. 1820 census data are 101401-10100. Assignment of Phillip, Whitmill, and R. D. as children of the first marriage is abritrary. They are Rushings which do not fit other proven and hypothetical groupings in this database. At least one source lists Hardy as a possible alternative name for R. D. Rushing\n\nHardy Rushing's second family is proven in Stewart County land grants and deeds.\n\nHe married, first, Unknown, before 1800. Children:\n\ni. Phillip[5] Rushing. Born, circa 1800. Census: 1820, in Stewart Co., TN.\n\n79 ii. R. D. Rushing.\n\n76 iii. Whitmill Rushing.\n\nHe married, second, Elizabeth, after 1820. Born, circa 1794, in SC. Census: 1850, in Benton Co., TN. Children:\n\n77 iv. Abel Rushing.\n\n78 v. Levin Rushing.\n\nvi. James R. Rushing. Born, circa 1827, in Humphreys Co., TN. Occupation: Farmer. He married Martha Cross, 16 Sep 1849, in Benton Co., TN.\n\nvii. David Rushing. Born, circa 1833, in TN. Census: 1850, in Benton Co., TN.\n\nviii. Robert Rushing. Born, circa 1837, in TN. Census: 1850, in Benton Co., TN.\n\nix. Susannan (Susan) A. Rushing.\n\n22. Hannah[4] Rushing (Phillip, 5). Born, after 1770. Census: 1830, in Perry Co., TN.\n\nIt is known that Hannah, the wife of Henry White, was a Rushing. She is assigned here as a daughter of Phillip primarily because Calvin Lacy, Phillip's guardian in 1838, is associated in 1830 Perry County, Tennessee, census records with the White family. Also, among Anson County records, it is Phillip Rushing whose name is most often associated with the Whites. Phillip Rushing and Joseph White owned adjacent property on Black Jack Creek in Anson County.\n\nShe married Henry White, son of Joseph White and Sarah. Born, circa 1765. Census: 1830, in Perry Co., TN. Note: At the time I created the Illinois Rushing database, I only had Reuben and Rebecca connected as children of Henry White and Hannah Rushing. In my original database of Rushings in Decatur and Henderson counties, TN, I now include eight children and over 2,000 descendants. Children:\n\n80 i. Reubin[5] White.\n\nii. Rebecca White. Born, 27 Oct 1800, in NC. Died, 16 Mar 1864. Burial in Brigance Cem., Decatur Co., TN. Census: 1830, in Perry Co., TN. She married Abraham Harrell, circa 1817. This is an hypothesis without proof. Rebecca, wife of Abraham Harrell, probably was the daughter of Henry White. In the 1830 census of Perry County, Tennessee. Abraham Harrell appears two households away from Henry White and adjacent to Reuben White. This would also be consistent with the close associations of Harrells and Whites with Rushings in the 1790 census of Anson County, North Carolina.\n\n23. Millie[4] Rushing (Phillip, 5). Born, circa 1785.\n\nShe married Jesse Lacy, son of Thomas Lacy and Kesiah Griffith in Anson Co., NC. Born, 20 Mar 1770. Children:\n\ni. Calvin[5] Lacy. Born, 13 Jan 1806.

Born, circa 1785. Died, before 1850. Census: 1830, in Perry Co., TN. Census: 1840, in Perry Co., TN.\n\nI have this assigned the family of Sarah Rushing in the 1850 census of Decatur Co., TN, to the family of Richard Rushing based on the name Richard. Asa Rushing on p. 171 of the 1840 census of in Perry Co., TN, would seem to be the best fit based on the females in the household. (The Asa Rushing on p. 180 is the Asa Rushing 1801-1851 buried at New Hope Cemetery in Decatur Co.) The fit on ages for the household on the p. 171 Asa Rushing is not good, but it is better than the fit for other Rushings in the 1840 census. The problem is that the Asa on p. 171 in 1840 might be the Asa on p. 234 in the 1830 census. All Rushings in the 1830 census of Perry Co., TN, on p. 234 may comprise the family of Mark Rushing; none except possibly Asa are in Perry Co. in 1840. The alternatives among Rushings in Perry Co. in 1840 are D. M./Daniel Rushing and Jacob Rushing. After returning to Tennessee, the family of David Thomas Rushing settled in the eastern Henderson Co. area near other descendants of Richard.

Burial in Tolley Cem.?, Decatur Co., TN. Census: 1850, in Decatur Co., TN. He married Sarah Jane Houston. The house lived in by Burrell Rushing later came to be known as the Townsend House. The following is from Lillye Younger's \"History of Decatur County.\"\n\n\"Townsend House, an Ante-Bellum house in Parsons has an interesting history despite the fact it is still a home.\n\n\"It is a picturesque colonial house, perched on a hill, overlooking a crest of fertile farm land and green pastures with cattle grazing lands, about one mile east of Parsons on the old Perryville road.\n\n\"It was formerly a two-story log house, chinked with mud, which was built during the 1830's.... It was built with an open hall through the center of the house, which was called a 'dog trot' back then....\n\n\"The house was sold to Burl [sic.] Rushing in 1844.... Some years later he married Sarah Houston and they lived here. During the civil war days \"Aunt Sarah\" as she was called, sat on the front porch all day during the battle of Shilo and could hear the roar of the cannons from the battles, a distance of 50 miles. Many years later she entertained her grandchildren with accounts of this incident.\n\n\"During the war the guerillas entered the couple's home in search of gold an d strung up her husband in an effort to get him to tell where the gold was hidden. Each time they tightened the rope, he refused. During the episode the Confederate soldiers came by and the guerillas fled. Mrs. Rushing released her husband who was strung up over the spot where the gold was buried.\n\n\"Under the living room floor of the house was a hideout, which could be reached by a secret trap door to the floor.\"\n\nWhile the story above places the blame on Union raiders, in actuality it probably was a crime of a local band of outlaws. The tactic is the same as used by a local outlaw, Lem Bussell (later a preacher), against the Myracle family. The house later passed to Sarah's second husband, Rennie Raines, and to his son Lennie Rains. It passed out of the family by sale in 1918. The auction at which it was sold was a major event remembered for years by many people in the community.\n\niv. Caroline Rushing. Census: 1860, in Navarro Co., TX.

Willis Rushing served from November 13, 1814, to May 13, 1815, in Capt. James Gray's company of the militia from Stewart Co., Col. John Cock's 2nd Regt. Tenn. Infantry. Willis Rushing bought a great acreage of land, owned slaves, and operated a tavern in his brick dwelling on the Paris-Reynoldsburg Road. (The house was torn down in 1871.)

Born, circa 1795. Died, before 1850. Census: 1840, in Perry Co., TN.\n\nIt was difficult to decide whether to place Daniel as a son of Richard or Phillip. Daniel has one of the strongest cases for a tie to Phillip. Perry County deeds show that Phillip made Daniel a gift of a slave. The deed mentions Phillip's \"affection\" for Daniel, a term often used in property transfers to children. My ultimate decision to include Daniel with Richard is that Daniel was sued by Phillip's estate to return the slave. Census data for D. M. Rushing, 1840, Perry County: 1120001-00101.\n\nHe married an unknown woman. Children:\n\ni. Daniel M.[5] Rushing. Born, circa 1815, in NC. Census: 1850, in Decatur Co., TN. He married Jemima.\n\nii.

He married Jane. Carrol Rushing is assigned here as a son of Daniel by default. He is not on the list of children of Isaac in the Louisiana probate record for the estate of Isaac Rushing. He is not on the deed which lists the children of Elijah Rushing. The younger Richard does not seem to have children born before 1830. He is not claimed by descendants of Burrell as part of Burrell's family. He is not on John Bateman Rushing's lists of children of Jason Rushing and Asa Rushing. He is not listed as a brother in the settlement of the estate of Enoch Deason Rushing, son of David Rushing.\n\n31. Burrell[4] Rushing (Richard, 6). Born, circa 1798, in Anson Co., NC. Died, 5 May 1867, in Decatur Co., TN. Burial in Rushing Grove C., Decatur Co., TN (fieldstone). Census: 1850, in Decatur Co., TN.\n\nBurrell gave about 10 acres of land to be used as part of the site for the town of Decaturville, Tennessee. This Burrell Rushing is often mistaken for the son of Revolutionary War veteran Phillip Rushing because a pensioner named Phillip Rushing is listed in Burrell's household in the 1840 census of Perry County. However, Burrell cannot be a son of Phillip and probably cannot be a grandson either. In 1790 Phillip Rushing had a son Phillip Rushing Jr. who had his own household and children, so the the most likely range of ages for Phillip's children would be 1765-1790. Burrell may be too young. In 1800 Phillip's wife is identified as 45 and over so is not likely to be mother of Burrell. (This is especially so when one also must consider the younger Isaac Rushing as a brother of Burrell.) Burrell is associated with Richard in most census records. In 1820 Richard, Phillip, and Burrell live adjacent to one another in Perry County. In 1830 Richard and Burrell are only three households apart, but Phillip has moved elsewhere. Phillip had a guardian in his old age, as shown in the 1838 Perry County Circuit Court record where Calvin Lacy is petitioning to be replaced as Phillip's guardian. It seems unlikely that Burrell was more than guardian of his Phillip, who probably was his uncle. Burrell certainly did not know the correct age for Phillip to tell the census taker in 1840. Burrell in 1840 is living in the southern part of Decatur County, which is probably where Phillip lived, but it is away from Richard and from where Burrell lived in 1830. In 1842, probably after Phillip's death, Burrell buys (or registers) land on Turkey Creek adjacent to Richard in the area where the other Rushings lived.\n\nHe married Mary Elizabeth Rhodes.

He married Eleanor (Elly) Ann White, 27 May 1851, in Navarro Co., TX. I am including Caswell Rushing as a son of Burrell Rushing for the following reasons. In the 1860 census Caswell Rushing is listed between the households of William Veal and Calvin Rushing (son of the younger Richard Rushing). Caswell cannot be a son of the younger Richard Rushing because census data do not seem to show the younger Richard with children born before 1830. However, he fits nicely into an age gap in the children of Burrell. The following sketch appears in \"Old Northwest Texas, Volume I-B, Navarro County 1846-1860\": \"Was the first of this surname to arr NavCo; is on 1847 TxR1.

He appears frequently in the early Perry County court records, often in scrapes (assault and battery, assault to commit murder). Did he leave Perry County because things were getting too hot? An oral tradition among descendants of Morning Rushing Tolley is that Isaac abandoned his family. This probably is not correct. Other records show that Isaac's Louisiana family and his Decatur County relatives remained in contact with one another until the time of the Civil War.\n\nThe family of Issac Rushing is outlined in the probate records of Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana.

Huntley of Mystic, Connecticut, who analyzed it using Anson County deed records. The following are extracted from a letter by Mr. Huntley to a Mrs. Thomas, dated 2 Mar 91. \"Proof that William Gilbert Rushing was a son of David lies in Anson Co.

Nancy would be David's second wife. My personal belief is that Nancy must have been the mother of Calvin Rushing (b. 1804). It is doubtful that anyone looking the matching markers for Calvin Rushing and Nancy Rushing at Campground Cemetery, with Calvin at Nancy's foot, would doubt that Nancy was Calvin's mother.
