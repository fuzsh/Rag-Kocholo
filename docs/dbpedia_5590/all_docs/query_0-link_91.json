        "text": "(Catch my previous John Ford film review here: She Wore A Yellow Ribbon)\n\nJohn Ford’s 1941 drama film about a small Welsh mining town in the late 19th century was an adaptation of a 1939 novel of the same name. The story is pastoral and elegiac at times, radical politically and theologically at others, but almost heartfelt and beautiful in its sensitivity to the plight of the family it portrays. The film is famous today as one of John Ford’s greatest non-Western pictures, as well as being the film that beat Citizen Kane at the 1941 Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Cinematography. In fact, this film was nominated for ten different categories that year and won five of them: a fact that film buffs, though rarely film scholars, look back on in confusion today.\n\nThe story recounts the life of the Morgan family as the town changes over a few short, but important years. Gwilym Morgan and his five grown sons work in the local coal mine where he is a spokesman for the workers and the Morgans are held in high esteem by their coworkers and their employers as pillars of the community. But coal prices begin a worldwide decline as production creates a supply that outpaces demand. The result is that the mine begins to decrease pay, hire fewer new workers, give out less overtime, and eventually even fires more skilled workers, like the Morgan boys, who can demand a higher wage in favor of less skilled workers who will do the job for cheaper. Gwilym’s sons begin a labor union, which creates a schism with their father who is against the idea on the mistaken belief that socialist policies will only hurt the people in the long run, and on the even more mistaken belief that the employers are good people who care about the well-being of their workers: a sentiment that is almost never true in a large company where the bosses don’t know each employee on a first-name basis.\n\nMeanwhile, the local Pastor, Mr. Gruffydd, begins to develop a rapport with the Morgan’s daughter Angharad (Maureen O’Hara) and a close relationship with the Morgan family in general. When the eldest son is married to a beautiful local Welsh girl named Bronwyn (played by the ethereal beauty Anna Lee), Gruffydd comes by, drinks with the family in celebration, and dances and sings like any good Welshman would. And when the Morgan boys later attack the local Church for its ideological complicity in serfdom through its obsession with life in the image of Christ through suffering and misfortune as the way to salvation, Gruffydd controverts them and tells them that the Church is there to free the people so that they can reach salvation. And that therefore, the Church’s teachings are in keeping with Unionization and Socialism generally as long as the movement doesn’t create new forms of serfdom or oppression in the process and remains an organization by, of and for the people.\n\nThe entire story is told from the perspective of the youngest of the Morgan boys, Huw Morgan, who is not yet old enough to work the coal mines. After the Unions begin to talk badly about Gwilym Morgan for not being in solidarity with them, his wife Beth goes out in the harsh snowy winter conditions to address them and threaten them against their antagonism toward her husband. On the way back home, however, she and Huw fall down an embankment and into the icy waters below. They both experience frostbite and lose the use of their legs for some months. Pastor Gruffydd helps Huw to recover and develops a bond with the boy, which endears the pastor even more to Angharad, and eventually the two begin lovers of the heart. But Gruffydd wants better for Angharad than a life of poverty living on the sparse collections from Church goers, and she eventually deigns to live a life in loveless matrimony with the coal mine owner’s son, despite everyone knowing of her affinity with Gruffydd.\n\nHuw goes to school and is bullied by his teacher and by the other students, but through boxing training with one-time professional heavyweight Dai Bando (Rhys Williams, the only Welsh actor in the film), Huw comes into his own as a fighter, gains the respect of his upper class schoolmates, and even has his teacher sorted out and beaten to a pulp by Bando. Huw graduates his grade with honors and is set for a scholarship to a state school to continue his education, when suddenly his older brother Ivor dies in the mine, leaving behind Bronwyn and his son. Huw decides to work in the mines and moves in with Bronwyn to help support her and her child financially, as he has always had a crush on her.\n\nEventually, the mines lay off some of the Morgan sons who leave for America. Another son dies in the mines, and later so too does the elder father Morgan. Angharad returns from abroad where she was living with her husband and things look as if she may ask for a divorce, at which Gruffydd would enter the void and take her hand in marriage. Rumors break out in the town and Gruffydd is voted out of the Church. And the valley in which Huw remembers his idyllic youth slowly changes into a grey, lifeless place, with little to no prospects. A dying community like so many I myself know from my own youth. Like the mining community of Appalachia that was small and slowly depopulating, but still vibrant and beautiful when I was a child and, together with my family, visited my Great Grandfather who preached there. Now, the town is smaller than ever, with no prospects, and no coal jobs left, a veritable shell of its former quaint glories.\n\nThe character of Huw is played by a young English actor in the film, while his narration is spoken by an older version of himself. This version is voiced by Irving Pichel: a Hollywood director with socialist tendencies based in his Christian faith who made many a pro-British, anti-Nazi film in his day, and was later targeted by HUAC as a Communist. This move, along with many others, forever branded HUAC as pro-fascist, anti-Christian, and anti-humanist and anti-free speech in the minds of thinking Americans. Pichel and Ford were apparently good friends with similar political and artistic sentiments, which is apparent as Ford employed Pichel years later, in 1949, during the time when Pichel was embroiled in political controversy, for the narration on She Wore A Yellow Ribbon.\n\nThe film is a political document and a humanistic document that pulls for the hearts and minds of its viewers. It has spoken volumes to viewers for decades at an emotional level and is an artistic work falling pretty strongly within the French poetic realism form aesthetically, matching in beauty anything by Jean Renoir. And although not as cerebral or groundbreaking as Citizen Kane, it is a masterwork within the oeuvre of one of American’s greatest film directors, John Ford, and was therefore, in my estimation, deserving of every Oscar nod it was ceded, as well as every one it won.\n\nCody Ward"
