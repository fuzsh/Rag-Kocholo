        "text": "I grew up around John Ford movies, though my father and grandfather wouldn’t have described them that way. They were movie-watchers who were driven by select stars and for both they were enamored with John Wayne, but particularly my grandfather, who almost always had a western playing on his old television set whenever I stayed with my grandparents during the summers. He used to record them on VHS tapes whenever one was playing, so it wasn’t rare for the ambient noise of something like The Searchers (1956) or Stagecoach (1939) to penetrate the walls and become the soundtrack to the time I spent with my brother and an older cousin, who was closer to a sister back then. I’ve frequently written about the ways in which my own adolescence was compromised due to being closeted, and later abused, but I look back on those summers fondly. My ship didn’t sink until years later, and as a child I loved all those old westerns, but not for the same reasons as my patriarchs. I liked the way they set my imagination ablaze and gifted me an early understanding of whatever magic there might be in cinema, but for the men in my family it was about the power fantasy, and eventually that curdled how I began to look at the movies of directors like John Ford and Clint Eastwood, both of whom were on equal footing as Jesus Christ in my conservative home.\n\nSome of John Ford’s more lyrical work outside of the western genre never made it onto the TV sets of my youth. John Ford was never the draw, but it was his principles and his way of life that my fathers reacted strongly towards. They didn’t know it, but I did when my understanding of cinema began to grow, and it should have been a joy to involve myself fully with the works of John Ford when I was a teenager, but it wasn’t. It should have been a beautiful experience to confront his contradictions, his masterful eye, and his belief in a common-sense morality, but because I grew up around his movies I began to associate the director with men who failed me. In his movies I found people and a way of life that wasn’t separate from my own background in Southern Kentucky. The morals, convictions and beliefs were all too similar and it was those exact things that were keeping me closeted and festering a growing belief that my differences may get me killed.\n\nI was probably around nineteen when I watched John Ford’s How Green Was My Valley (1941) for the first time and I despised it. It’s coal-mining, god-fearing family felt like mine, and its nostalgic look at boyhood and all its beauty and compromises felt alien to me. At the time it felt like lecture from a filmmaker who didn’t feel any different to me than my father. A few months prior to watching this movie my dad told me that no one would ever think of me as a woman and if I did transition I needn’t bother come to his funeral. Years later when my grandfather passed away I tried to get my mother and aunt to talk my father into placing my real name in my grandfather’s obituary, and my father responded by leaving me out entirely, as if I never existed. The women in my family who do support me cannot sway the opinion of my father, and in John Ford’s movies there’s a similar old fashioned hierarchy of sexism and conservatism that I still have a difficult time with, even if I find his filmmaking extraordinary.\n\nMy husband wanted to watch How Green Was My Valley this past month and I was worried about revisiting it, but I found my relationship with the film less coarse this time around, and I would even go as far as saying it’s a great film. It’s no bold claim to state that a John Ford movie is excellent, but it’s difficult for me with this one. Even while watching it now I found myself rebelling against it in little ways, finding its lack of priority in the lives of women frustrating, and its tough-nosed boyhood parable alienating all the same. But there are moments of grace too, like the gathering of men in song off to work that reminded me of the songs of my hometown of Harlan county. The element of sons challenging the father figure with new ideas of unionization and potential resettlement to find a new life felt familiar, but not as dissonant or violent in response as I had remembered. I’m trying to love John Ford, but I’m like my father in one way, and that is his stubbornness to change a long-held belief. I can hear echoes of my past when watching How Green Was My Valley, and I remember why I had to burn it all down and start anew, but I’m rummaging through the ashes of the past these days to see if anything worthwhile has survived. Reconnecting with this movie gave me the chance to do just that, even if I found that I still very much had my shield up through much of it, and couldn’t give myself over to it entirely.\n\nI don’t know if that shield will ever come down completely, but as I get older and attempt to find the nuances of what I liked about my childhood in the hazy shroud of my memories I find that cinema allows me a passageway into the better parts. Even if I have trouble remembering the exact details I can touch the feeling of watching certain things and growing to love movies, and John Ford is there. He always will be. I think part of my difficulty with some of his work is not in something objective, but in my own problems in growing to love myself. There are pictures of me dressed up like a cowboy as a young child, smiling, and I try to find the girl in there, buried under this image of what was expected of her, and in the dress of what she thought she was, but maybe the truth is that she was just a girl who liked westerns. She was a girl who loved her grandfather and even her father, until she could no longer love them back. Part of my interest in John Ford lately is due to this realization that his movies are tied into my DNA in ways that I find jagged and uncomfortable, but I love them all the same. I don’t always come out on the other side with some greater realization about myself, but I think it’s healthy to be asking myself these questions, and I’m grateful that his movies have allowed me the chance to do so.\n\nI like How Green Was My Valley.\n\nIt’s a good film."
