        "text": "It's been a great year for John Ford.\n\nThe quintessential American moviemaker, who had a particular love for southern Utah as a film location, was memorialized in June with two first-rate DVD box sets from Warner: \"The John Ford Film Collection\" and \"The John Wayne-John Ford Film Collection,\" both filled with Ford-directed classics.\n\nAnd now comes the biggest box set of all — in fact, the biggest box set I've ever seen: \"Ford at Fox.\"\n\nThis one contains 24 films — that's right, 24! Half of Ford's output for 20th Century Fox. (Does that mean a forthcoming \"Volume 2\" will have the other half?)\n\nIt's a pricey set — $299.98! (No surprise that it's coming out just before Christmas.)\n\nIn addition to the two-dozen pictures (some of them with bonus features), the set includes a new documentary on Ford's years at the Fox studio; an oversize, 168-page, hardback photo book of Ford at work; and two souvenir brochure reproductions — all of which comes in a huge, heavy box.\n\nIf $300 is too much (even at the discount prices that will no doubt be offered at some stores), some films here are also available in a pair of smaller sets — \"John Ford's Silent Epics\" ($49.98), with five silent movies, including Ford's classic \"The Iron Horse\" and \"John Ford's American Comedies\" ($49.98), with five comic adventures, including a trio of Will Rogers vehicles. Some other titles are available individually or in double-features.\n\nThe \"Ford at Fox\" films range from the 1920s during the silent era to a pair of World War II pictures made in the early 1950s.\n\nAmong them are a number of superb classics that have already been available on DVD — \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" \"How Green Was My Valley,\" \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" and \"My Darling Clementine.\" Even the recent Criterion Collection release of \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" is here.\n\nBut there are also quite a few films in this set that are making their DVD debuts, such as \"The Iron Horse\" (1924), about the building of the transcontinental railroad (which concludes with the driving of the golden spike in Utah), and \"The Prisoner of Shark Island\" (1936), about Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was imprisoned for treating John Wilkes Booth's injuries, though he was unaware that Booth had assassinated President Lincoln.\n\nAnd many films are coming to home video for the first time, as with \"Four Men and a Prayer\" (1938), featuring Utahn Loretta Young as a woman caught up in a murder mystery; and \"Tobacco Road\" (1941), Ford's adaptation of the Erskine Caldwell novel (and the subsequent play) about life in the South, with Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.\n\nThen there's \"Up the River,\" a strange 1930 musical-comedy that is creaky, to say the least, replete with the problems of early sound films — but also significant as the only teaming of Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart, long before either was a star.\n\nFilms this old have their inherent weaknesses, of course. Those who have no tolerance for movie cliches or stereotypes, or for primitive, limited filmmaking techniques, are not likely to be converted. But for film fans with an interest in the development of the industry and the charm and innovative production values of early motion pictures, there's more than enough here to fill the bill.\n\nAnd for the dyed-in-the-wool film buff, it's a pleasure just to plow through these films, to become reacquainted with those that haven't been viewed for many years, and to be introduced to some for the first time.\n\nThis is what home video does best."
