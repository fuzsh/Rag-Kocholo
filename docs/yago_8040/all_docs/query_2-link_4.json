        "text": "So what else do we know about the Gladiator actor’s much younger soon-to-be wife?\n\nWhat does Britney Theriot do?\n\nThe woman who stole Crowe’s heart is from New Orleans, Louisiana. She attended the all-girls private Catholic St Mary’s Dominican High School and was a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints, per People. The 32-year-old also has a degree in electrical engineering from Louisiana State University, per her Facebook profile. However, she did not pursue a career in this field.\n\nInstead, Theriot debuted as an actress in the 2013 film Broken City, also starring her then future husband, before settling down as a property agent with Mirambell Realty based in Louisiana.\n\nRecently, she has also assisted Crowe as he directed Poker Face and starred in The Greatest Beer Run Ever, Land of Bad and Sleeping Dogs, per IMDB. She often joins her beau on stage as a supporting vocalist during his performances.\n\nHow did Russell Crowe meet Britney Theriot?\n\nThe inseparable couple reportedly met on the set of Theriot’s first film, Broken City. This was after the Oscar-winning actor had separated from Danielle Spencer, his ex-wife. However, they were only linked romantically in late 2020, two years after his divorce from the Australian actress was finalised.\n\nHowever, fans speculated based on the American property agent’s social media posts that they were possibly already dating before it was first reported by the media. The pair quietly dated for two years before making their red carpet debut for Crowe’s Poker Face premiere in Italy in October 2022, per People.\n\nShe got proposed to in Italy\n\nDoes Britney Theriot have kids?\n\nTheriot has not given birth to any kids. However, the 60-year-old has two sons – Charles Spencer Crowe, 20, and Tennyson Spencer Crowe, 17, from his previous marriage to Spencer. The New Orleans native seems to have a great relationship with Crowe’s children, and they even went on a holiday together in – you guessed it – Italy, as seen in a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWhat are Britney Theriot’s hobbies?\n\nThe couple was once denied entry to a restaurant\n\nPer Australian media, after a game of tennis in 2023, Crowe and Theriot decided to get some Japanese food for lunch. Their choice of restaurant was Mr. Miyagi in Melbourne. However, they were reportedly refused entry into the establishment for not meeting the “casual but fancy” dress code by staff who didn’t recognise the actor.\n\nAfter initially doubling down on the rejection, Mr. Miyagi later updated its dress code policy to the glib “dress smart casual unless you’re Russell Crowe, then wear whatevs”, as seen on its official Instagram, seemingly hoping the Robin Hood actor would give them another chance."
