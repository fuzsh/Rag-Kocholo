        "text": "Russell Crowe is known for his roles in ‘Gladiator’ and ‘A Beautiful Mind,’ but he’s also a dedicated family man. Take a look at his sons as well as their mother, here.\n\nRussell Crowe is a proud papa of two beautiful boys – two sons he shares with his ex-wife, Danielle Spencer. Danielle and Russell began their romantic relationship in 1989, after working together on the movie, The Crossing. From there, their on-again/off-again romance spanned decades, until they settle down and tied the knot in early 2003. The couple wed at Russell’s property in Nana Glen, a small village in New South Wales, Australia, and later that year, she gave birth to their first son, Charles. Three years later, in 2006, their family grew, and Charles became the big brother to a baby boy named Tennyson. From there, it seemed that the couple was on the road towards a ‘happily ever after,’ but in October 2012, news broke that they were separating. Despite remaining amicable and on good terms – while co-parenting their songs – it took about six years for Russell and Danielle to hammer out the details of their divorce. In 2018, Russell announced he was ‘officially divorced’ on Twitter. Since then, the two have continued their loving relationship – but as friends and parents of two good-looking kids.\n\nScroll through the gallery to see photos of the family.\n\n1 of 7\n\nRussell Crowe & Danille Spencer\n\n2 of 7\n\nRussell Crowe & Family On The Walk of Fame Star\n\n3 of 7\n\nRussell & Danielle In Cannes\n\n4 of 7\n\nRussell Crowe & Danielle Spencer At AMFAR\n\n5 of 7\n\nRussell Crowe With His Boy\n\n6 of 7\n\nRussell Crowe & His Family"
