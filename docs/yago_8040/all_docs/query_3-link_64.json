        "text": "The couple, who’ve been married for nine years, parted ways back in 2012, have still remained close for the sake of their two boys, Tennyson, eight, and Charles, 11.\n\nThe 50-year-old has always been vocal on his beliefs, previously saying he’d only marry once, and it appears he’s doing everything in his power to make those words become reality.\n\n“Technically we’re married. We are separated and discussing what that means.” The actor recently admitted to News.com.au.\n\nRussell’s desire for romantic reconciliation may not be matched with Danielle’s, who has been noted to referring to him as ‘friend’.\n\nThe 45-year-old singer shared with the Daily Telegraphthe importance on the two remaining close.\n\n“Obviously, I want to be on the best of terms with Russell,” she said.\n\n“We have kids together, we’ve been friends since we’ve been teenagers.\n\n“We’ve been on and off and in and out of each of other’s lives for a very long time.\n\n“So, ending up in a place where we’re not friends, or we’re not able to get together for the kids and do things like the premiere or Christmas morning, or things that are very important for the kids, I think that would be a really sad place to end up.”\n\nDanielle, who supported Russell by attending the Australian premiere of his blockbuster The Water Diviner, cites her divorced parents as relationship role models for her and Russell, who like them had an amicable split.\n\n“It’s been a great example for me, that is exactly what I would aspire to achieving myself.\n\n“If my mother’s away, my father and step-dad will get together and watch the footie or something – they’re really great friends,” she added.\n\nChatting to the UK’s Sunday Times, it’s clear that Russell would like nothing more than to be united back with his wife.\n\n“Once I commit to something, I stick with it, so you never know… I’ve loved Danielle Spencer since 1989; that’s never going to change.”"
