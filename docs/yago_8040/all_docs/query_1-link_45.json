        "text": "We started off as strangers, quickly became friends, and began our relationship in October of 2015. Our young love blossomed into a bountiful relationship and we will be tying the knot with a joyous celebration this June! If you are here, please know we would love for you to attend what will be one of the happiest days of our lives. Danielle and James have been on an amazing adventure together for nearly a decade where we both continue to grow and learn from one another everyday. We met in 2014 at a party James and his housemates were throwing in Santa Barbara. We hit it off that night finding out that we had more in common than we could have ever imagined. After a few conversations we found out that we had graduated from the same high school (2 years apart) and even shared a best friend. After about a year of friendship, James asked Danielle to be his girlfriend and we began a long distance relationship. We tested out living together when James joined Danielle and her housemate one summer in Lake Havasu City while James was in between semesters in college. Needless to say, we were pretty compatible and Danielle would move to live with James in Santa Barbara. We found a place and began living together in September of 2016. James was finishing up at Santa Barbara City College getting ready to graduate and transfer to Humboldt State University. Danielle would begin her college experience. We made our big move together to Humboldt county in July 2017 where we spent 3 amazing years in Arcata exploring the magnificent redwood forest and the beautiful north pacific coast. James graduated and was accepted into a program at UC Davis' medical Center. We continued our adventure together as we moved 5 hours south to Davis, Ca in August 2020. In June of 2022 we traveled to Perú with James’ grandmother to explore a new country and hike to the magnificent Machu Picchu. The day before our hike James got down on one knee and proposed to Danielle on the Scared River in Cuzco. Danielle undoubtedly said yes and our adventure continued as an engaged couple. We have been happily living here in Davis for the last 4 years where we have created so many amazing and unforgettable relationships with countless people along the way. Every place we have lived has taught us something new. It is because of this that we are so excited to continue our fortuitous relationship together as a married couple and cannot wait to share this day with some of our closest family & friends!"
