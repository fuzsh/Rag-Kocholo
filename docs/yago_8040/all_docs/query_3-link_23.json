        "text": "Russell Crowe and his wife, Danielle Spencer, have separated after nine years of marriage, according a report in the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThe split is said to be amicable for the couple, who have two sons together, 8-year-old Charles and 6-year-old Tennyson. Crowe, 48, and Spencer, 43, met 22 years ago on the set of the film The Crossing. He proposed to Spencer, a musician, in 2002 and they quietly married at a chapel at Crowe's farm in Nana Glen, Australia in April 2003. The two have been based in Australia ever since, with their two children attending school in Sydney.\n\nRussell Crowe bailed out by Coast Guard after getting lost kayaking\n\nCrowe will next be seen alongside Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in Les Miserables. Spencer competed on the most recent season of Australia's Dancing with the Stars."
