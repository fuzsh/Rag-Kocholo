        "text": "Armani, also a wedding guest, had dressed the bridal party, including Crowe.\n\nThe nuptials capped an event-filled weekend Crowe had planned for his guests, which included a cricket match starring Australian star Shane Warne and several musical performances.\n\nDespite the couple’s best efforts, scores of reporters scrambled to cover the nuptials, hiring all available local helicopters and staking out the entrance to Nana Glen, Crowe’s property in the lush hills near Coffs Harbour, a resort town halfway between Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nCrowe’s publicist Wendy Day had earlier warned news crews against outdoing each other to get the scoop, and promised to release pictures of the event later, for free.\n\nTents and marquees were erected to protect guests from the prying eyes of the media, and security guards stood at the ranch’s entrance to block any uninvited visitors.\n\nDay said the wedding would include about 80 close friends and family members, but no Hollywood stars.\n\nAustralia’s media was buzzing in the run-up to the wedding. Several newspapers today splashed snaps of guests arriving and pictures of a cricket match between the Crowes and the Spencers and their friends, while TV channels beamed out hourly updates as the sunset ceremony approached."
