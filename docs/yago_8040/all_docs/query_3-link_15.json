        "text": "Danielle Spencer would walk away from her marriage to Hollywood heavy-hitter Russell Crowe with a settlement conservatively estimated at $25 million. The couple have separated after nine years of marriage.\n\nThe figure could grow considerably given that Crowe has earned about $150 million making films in the years since the couple wed, with no less than six new blockbuster movies about to launch in coming months.\n\nAlong with his Hollywood deals, which have included taking a share of sizeable box office earnings, Crowe has also been busy investing in various businesses outside filmmaking. They range from his share of the Rabbitohs football club and Riley Street Gym in Darlinghurst, to his premium Black Standard Beef production, which sells to top restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne, and upmarket butchers including Woollahra's Victor Churchill.\n\nBut the real money is tied up in a property portfolio worth up to $50 million, which includes harbourside Sydney homes and valuable farmland on the NSW north coast.\n\nThe couple reportedly signed a prenuptial agreement before marrying at Crowe's Nana Glen farm near Coffs Harbour in 2003.\n\nAt the time it was claimed the \"prenup\" guaranteed Spencer a minimum payout of about $15 million if the couple stayed together for at least three years.\n\nThere was also reportedly a $3 million trust fund for each child they had together, with the couple going on to have two sons, Charles and Tennyson, aged eight and six.\n\nThe \"prenup\" is also understood to stipulate that Spencer would remain in the marital home, which at the time was the $14 million 1300-square-metre penthouse suite at Woolloomooloo's Wharf complex, which in 2003 was ranked as the most expensive apartment purchase in Sydney.\n\nCrowe, who has been overseas shooting various films for months, is expected to remain living in the Woolloomooloo abode, while Spencer is likely to retain their most recent acquisition, the $10 million Rose Bay mansion where she remains living with their sons.\n\nThe Rose Bay property is the only one that has been bought in both Crowe and Spencer's names.\n\nLoading\n\nAccording to land title and Australian Securities and Investment Commission searches, the rest of the property portfolio, which includes farmland, bush cottages and apartments in Kensington, are owned in either Crowe's own name or by a variety of companies he has set up, with such imaginative names as Fear of God Films, Gruntland and Max Symous & Son Pty Ltd.\n\nWhile it is not one of his highest profile investments, Crowe also has his own pub in Nymboida near Nana Glen, where he has opened a museum dedicated to his Hollywood career."
