        "text": "Danielle Spencer has Russell Crowe fans doing a double take after posting a photo of their sons.\n\nWhile the Australian actress and the Oscar winner, who officially divorced in 2018, tend to keep their kids Charles Spencer Crowe, 17, and Tennyson Spencer Crowe, 14, out of the public eye, Danielle recently made an exception. In honor of Mother's Day earlier this month, Danielle took to social media to share a snap with the duo's teenage boys. \"Here I was telling the boys to smile - and then I didn't. Ah well,\" she captioned the May 9 post. \"Have had a lovely Mother's Day. Hope all the mums out there have been spoilt today.\""
