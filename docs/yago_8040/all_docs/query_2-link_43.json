        "text": "Described by film producer Michael Deeley as \"the very best eye in the business\", director Ridley Scott was born on November 30, 1937 in South Shields, Tyne and Wear. His father was an officer in the Royal Engineers and the family followed him as his career posted him throughout the United Kingdom and Europe before they eventually returned to Teesside. Scott wanted to join the British Army (his elder brother Frank had already joined the Merchant Navy) but his father encouraged him to develop his artistic talents instead and so he went to West Hartlepool College of Art and then London's Royal College of Art where he helped found the film department.\n\nIn 1962, he joined the BBC as a trainee set designer working on several high profile series. He attended a trainee director's course while he was there and his first directing job was on an episode of the popular BBC police series Freie Hand für Barlow (1962), Error of Judgement (1965). More TV work followed until, frustrated by the poor financial rewards at the BBC, he went into advertising. With his younger brother, Tony Scott, he formed the advertising production company RSA (Ridley Scott Associates) in 1967 and spent the next 10 years making some of the best known and best loved TV adverts ever shown on British television, including a series of ads for Hovis bread set to the music of Dvorak's New World Symphony which are still talked about today (\"'e were a great baker were our dad.\")\n\nHe began working with producer David Puttnam in the 1970s developing ideas for feature films. Their first joint endeavor, Die Duellisten (1977) won the Jury Prize for Best First Work at Cannes in 1977 and was nominated for the Palm d'Or, more than successfully launching Scott's feature film career. The success of Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) inspired Scott's interest in making science fiction and he accepted the offer to direct Dan O'Bannon's low budget science fiction horror movie Alien: Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt (1979), a critical and commercial success that firmly established his worldwide reputation as a movie director.\n\nDer Blade Runner (1982) followed in 1982 to, at best, a lukewarm reception from public and critics but in the years that followed, its reputation grew - and Scott's with it - as one of the most important sci-fi movies ever made. Scott's next major project was back in the advertising world where he created another of the most talked-about advertising spots in broadcast history when his \"1984\"-inspired ad for the new Apple Macintosh computer was aired during the Super Bowl on January 22, 1984. Scott's movie career has seen a few flops (notably Legende (1985) and 1492 - Die Eroberung des Paradieses (1992)), but with successes like Thelma & Louise (1991), Gladiator (2000) and Black Hawk Down (2001) to offset them, his reputation remains solidly intact.\n\nRidley Scott was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire at the 2003 Queen's New Year Honours for his \"substantial contribution to the British film industry\". On July 3, 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship in 2018. BAFTA described him as \"a visionary director, one of the great British film-makers whose work has made an indelible mark on the history of cinema. Forty years since his directorial debut, his films continue to cross the boundaries of style and genre, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of film talent.\"\n\nAcademy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard is one of this generation's most popular directors. From the critically acclaimed dramas A Beautiful Mind: Genie und Wahnsinn (2001) and Apollo 13 (1995) to the hit comedies Eine Wahnsinnsfamilie (1989) and Splash: Jungfrau am Haken (1983), he has created some of Hollywood's most memorable films.\n\nHoward made his directorial debut in 1978 with the comedy Gib Gas... und laßt euch nicht erwischen (1977). He began his career in film as an actor. He first appeared in Die Reise (1959) and Music Man (1962), then as Opie on the long-running television series The Andy Griffith Show (1960). Howard later starred in the popular series Happy Days (1974) and drew favorable reviews for his performances in American Graffiti (1973) and Der Scharfschütze (1976).\n\nHoward and long-time producing partner Brian Grazer first collaborated on the hit comedies \"Night Shift\" and \"Splash.\" The pair co-founded Imagine Entertainment in 1986 to create independently produced feature films.\n\nHoward's portfolio includes some of the most popular films of the past 20 years. In 1991, Howard created the acclaimed drama \"Backdraft\", starring Robert De Niro, Kurt Russell and William Baldwin. He followed it with the historical epic In einem fernen Land (1992), starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Howard directed Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Gary Sinise and Delroy Lindo in the 1996 suspense thriller Kopfgeld - Einer wird bezahlen (1996). Howard worked with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise and Kathleen Quinlan on \"Apollo 13,\" which was re-released recently in the IMAX format.\n\nHoward's skill as a director has long been recognized. In 1995, he received his first Best Director of the Year award from the DGA for \"Apollo 13.\" The true-life drama also garnered nine Academy Award nominations, winning Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. It also received Best Ensemble Cast and Best Supporting Actor awards from the Screen Actor's Guild. Many of Howard's past films have received nods from the Academy, including the popular hits Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), \"Parenthood\" and Cocoon (1985), the last of which took home two Oscars.\n\nHoward directed and produced Das Comeback (2005) starring Oscar winner Russell Crowe, with whom he previously collaborated on \"A Beautiful Mind,\" for which Howard earned an Oscar for Best Director and which also won awards for Best Picture, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress. The film garnered four Golden Globes as well, including the award for Best Motion Picture Drama. Additionally, Howard won Best Director of the Year from the Directors Guild of America. Howard and producer Brian Grazer received the first annual Awareness Award from the National Mental Health Awareness Campaign for their work on the film.\n\nHoward was honored by the Museum of Moving Images in December 2005, and by the American Cinema Editors in February 2006. Howard and his creative partner Brian Grazer, were honored by the Producers Guild of America with the Milestone Award in January 2009, NYU's Tisch School of Cinematic Arts with the Big Apple Award in November 2009 and by the Simon Wiesenthal Center with their Humanitarian Award in May 2010. In June 2010, Howard was honored by the Chicago Film Festival with their Gold Hugo - Career Achievement Award. In March 2013, Howard was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. In December 2015, Howard was honored with a star in the Motion Pictures category, making him one of the very few to have been recognized with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHoward also produced and directed the film adaptation of Peter Morgan's critically acclaimed play Frost/Nixon (2008). The film was nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and was also nominated for The Darryl F. Zanuck Producer of the Year Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures by the PGA.\n\nHoward has also served as an executive producer on a number of award-winning films and television shows, such as the HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998), Fox's Emmy Award winner for Best Comedy, Arrested Development (2003), a series which he also narrated, Netflix's release of new episodes of \"Arrested Development,\" and NBC's \"Parenthood.\"\n\nHoward's recent films include the critically acclaimed drama Rush: Alles für den Sieg (2013), staring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl, written by Peter Morgan; and Made in America (2013), a music documentary he directed staring Jay-Z for Showtime.\n\nHoward's other films include Im Herzen der See (2015), based on the true story that inspired Moby Dick; his adaptation of Dan Brown's best-selling novels Illuminati (2009), and The Da Vinci Code - Sakrileg (2006) staring Oscar winner Tom Hanks; the blockbuster holiday favorite \"Dr. Seuss' Der Grinch (2000)\" starring Jim Carrey; \"Parenthood\" starring Steve Martin; the fantasy epic Willow (1988); Nightshift - Das Leichenhaus flippt völlig aus (1982) starring Henry Winkler, Michael Keaton and Shelley Long; and the suspenseful western, The Missing (2003), staring Oscar winners Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nRecently, Howard directed Inferno (2016), the third installment of Dan Brown 's Robert Langdon franchise and The Beatles: Eight Days a Week - The Touring Years (2016), a documentary about the rock legends The Beatles. He also produced the second season of Breakthrough - Aufbruch in unsere Zukunft (2015), Mars (2016), and directed the first episode of Genius (2017), based on the life of Albert Einstein, all for NatGeo.\n\nTom Hooper was educated at one of England's most prestigious schools, Westminster. His first film, Runaway Dog, was made when he was 13 years old and shot on a Clockwork 16mm Bolex camera, using 100 feet of film. At age 18, he wrote, directed and produced the short film Painted Faces (1992), which premiered at the London Film Festival; it was released theatrically and later shown on Channel 4. He studied English at England's top university, Oxford. At Oxford University, he directed theatre productions starring his contemporaries Kate Beckinsale and Emily Mortimer, and directed his first television commercials. His father was a non-executive director at United News and Media, which owned an ITV franchise.\n\nHooper's father introduced him to one of British television's top directors and producers, Matthew Robinson, who gave him breaks by employing him to direct episodes of Byker Grove (1989) and EastEnders (1985), both series produced by Robinson. Further success came when he was approved by Helen Mirren to direct her in Heißer Verdacht - Die letzten Zeugen (2003). He then worked with her again on Elizabeth I (2005). Hooper made the difficult transition from television to film with apparent ease, directing Michael Sheen in the Brian Clough biopic The Damned United - Der Ewige Gegner (2009) and Colin Firth in The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010). Both films were critical and commercial successes, quickly establishing Hooper as one of the most in demand directors of his generation.\n\nHooper has garnered numerous awards in his career. He won an Academy Award for directing The King's Speech. The 2010 film was nominated for 12 Oscars, more than any other film of that year, and also won the Best Picture, Best Actor (Colin Firth), and Best Original Screenplay Oscars. The King's Speech received seven BAFTA Awards, including Best Film and Outstanding British Film. Hooper also won a Directors Guild of America Award for his direction. Among other accolades worldwide, The King's Speech additionally was honored with the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival; the Best British Film prize at the British Independent Film Awards; the Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film; the Producers Guild of America Awards' top prize; and the European Film Award for Best Film. The King's Speech earned $414 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nHooper was recently again a Directors Guild of America Award nominee for directing Working Title Films' Les Misérables. The 2012 film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won the Best Supporting Actress (Anne Hathaway), Best Sound, and Best Make-up and Hair Styling Academy Awards. Les Misérables received those same accolades at the BAFTA Awards, as well as the BAFTA for Best Production Design. Among other accolades worldwide, Les Misérables was named one of the year's 10 Best Films by the American Film Institute with an AFI Award; won three Golden Globe Awards including Best Picture [Musical/Comedy]; was voted the Best Acting by an Ensemble award by the National Board of Review; and was nominated for four Screen Actors Guild Awards. Les Misérables earned $442 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe Damned United received a South Bank Show Award nomination for Best British Film; and he gained acclaim for the BAFTA Award-nominated Red Dust, starring Hilary Swank and Chiwetel Ejiofor.\n\nHooper had an unprecedented run of success at the Golden Globe Awards with his works for HBO, which won the Golden Globe for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television three years in a row. The actors and actresses starring in these productions - respectively, Elizabeth I, Longford, and John Adams - also won Golden Globes for their performances three years running.\n\nHooper won an Emmy Award for directing Elizabeth I. The HBO Films/Channel 4 miniseries won three Golden Globes and nine Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Miniseries.\n\nLongford, written by Peter Morgan, starred Jim Broadbent and Samantha Morton. The HBO Films/Channel 4 Telefilm won three Golden Globe Awards and was nominated for five Emmy Awards.\n\nJohn Adams - Freiheit für Amerika (2008), starring Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney, won four Golden Globes and 13 Emmy Awards - the most Emmys ever awarded to a program in one year. Hooper, receiving his first Directors Guild of America Award nomination, directed all nine hours of the HBO Films miniseries.\n\nHooper was nominated for an Emmy Award for helming ITV's miniseries Prime Suspect 6. His television work also includes Daniel Deronda (2002), which won the award for Best Miniseries at the 2003 Banff Television Festival; the miniseries Love in a Cold Climate (2001), for which star Alan Bates received a BAFTA Award nomination; episodes of the multi-award-winning ITV comedy/drama Cold Feet (1997); and EastEnders (1985) one-hour specials that garnered BAFTA Awards two years in a row.\n\nPaul Haggis established himself over twenty years with an extensive career in television, before his big break into features arrived when he became the first screenwriter to garner two Best Film Academy Awards back-to-back for his scripts: \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004) directed by Clint Eastwood, and \"Crash\" (2005) which Paul directed himself.\n\nIn 2006, among others, Haggis penned two Clint Eastwood productions, \"Flags of our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima,\" for which he earned his third Best Screenplay Oscar nomination. He also co-wrote \"Casino Royale,\" which garnered considerable acclaim for reinvigorating the James Bond spy franchise.\n\nIn 2007, Haggis wrote, directed, and produced \"In the Valley of Elah.\" The film starred Tommy Lee Jones, Charlize Theron, and Susan Sarandon, and earned Jones a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.\n\nIn 2010, his film \"The Next Three Days\" was released, starring Russell Crowe, Liam Neeson, and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nAnd in 2013 he wrote and directed the romantic, personal drama \"Third Person,\" which starred Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde, Mila Kunis, Adrien Brody, James Franco, and Kim Basinger.\n\nMost recently, Haggis directed and executive produced all six episodes of the HBO mini-series \"Show Me A Hero,\" starring Oscar Isaac, Catherine Keener, Winona Ryder, James Belushi, and Alfred Molina.\n\nCurrently, Haggis is co-directing a feature length documentary on the AIDS crisis in San Francisco, called \"5B.\"\n\nEqually committed to his private and social concerns, Haggis is the founder of Artists for Peace and Justice. Under this umbrella, many of his friends in the film business have come forward to major build schools and clinics serving the children of the slums of Haiti (www.APJNow.org)."
