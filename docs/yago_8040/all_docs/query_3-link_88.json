        "text": "Russell Crowe doesn't want to get divorced from Danielle Spencer.\n\nThe Oscar winner admits he still feels ''connected'' to his estranged wife, whom he separated from in 2012 after nine years of marriage, and hopes to convince her to rekindle their relationship in the future.\n\nThe 51-year-old actor, who has sons Charles, 11, and Tennyson, eight, with the 45-year-old beauty, said: ''To this day everything I do is still connected to that. We haven't done the deal yet. I'm a very persistent person, you never know.\n\n''I didn't get married to get divorced.''\n\nThe 'Gladiator' star also feels uncomfortable not wearing a wedding ring.\n\nHe told Charlie Rose on 'CBS This Morning': ''I was so proud to wear that ring, Charlie. I don't feel balanced.''\n\nRussell recently admitted he and Danielle are still ''discussing'' the status of their relationship.\n\nHe said: ''Technically we're married. We are separated and discussing what that means.''\n\nThe Australian star indicated his jet-setting career was partially to blame for the breakdown of their marriage.\n\nHe said: ''Danielle is a great mom. We both made the decision that the family should stop traveling together.\n\n''The platform we have set for the boys is one of consistency. It was clear when we were traveling together that it wasn't the healthiest thing for the kids. They had to change schools, make new friends all the time, and there was something in that style of life where the grounded shifted under them all the time. That wasn't good for them.''"
