        "text": "Russell Crowe and Danielle Spencer are keeping quiet as news of their marriage split spreads around the world.\n\nTwenty two years after they first met, Crowe and Spencer have parted after nine years as husband and wife.\n\nNo public comment has been made by the Oscar-winning actor or his musician wife since news of the split was first reported in Fairfax newspapers on Monday.\n\nCrowe is currently in the US filming the biblical epic Noah, while Spencer, daughter of songwriter, singer and television entertainer Don Spencer, reportedly remains in Sydney with their two sons.\n\nThe Gladiator star spent the weekend in New York, where he took the stage at the Gramercy Theatre for the Indoor Garden Party on Saturday night.\n\nIt's understood the decision to separate was amicable, with Crowe and Spencer committed to protecting their two boys, eight-year-old Charles, and Tennyson, six.\n\nIt's been a busy year for both Crowe and Spencer with the couple often spending many weeks apart, mostly due to Crowe's acting commitments.\n\nThe New Zealand-born actor has six films coming out in the next 12 months: The Man with the Iron Fists, Les Miserables, Broken City, Man of Steel, Noah and Winter's Tale.\n\nCrowe was also absent for much of the 2012 season of the South Sydney Rabbitohs, in which he has a financial interest.\n\nSpencer, 43, has also been in the limelight this year as a contestant on the Seven Network's Dancing With the Stars. With a natural flair, Spencer and her dance partner Damian Whitewood made it to the grand final.\n\nDuring the series, Crowe and the young boys were in the audience to support her.\n\nHowever rumours their relationship was in trouble surfaced in June when photos appeared showing Spencer on a night out with Whitewood.\n\nAt the time Crowe and Spencer refused to answer questions about their relationship, but Crowe was snapped embracing Spencer in a rare display of public affection between the couple at Los Angeles airport just days after the photos were published.\n\nThey first met 22 years ago on the set of the film, The Crossing. The couple later broke up and Crowe headed overseas to find work.\n\nDuring their time apart Crowe had a romance with US actress Meg Ryan, before he returned to Australia and proposed to Spencer in 2002.\n\nThe pair were married in 2003 at Crowe's farm in Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour.\n\nIt has been reported in Fairfax newspapers that Spencer could get a settlement of $25 million.\n\nÂ© AAP 2024"
