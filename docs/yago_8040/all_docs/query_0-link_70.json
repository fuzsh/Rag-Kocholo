        "text": "Getting divorced is usually a losing proposition, but if you're the partner of a star, it can be lucrative. According to Women's Wear Daily, Russell Crowe's lawyers drew up a pre-nuptial agreement before he married the singer Danielle Spencer on April 7.\n\nIf the pair split, Spencer gets to keep the Finger Wharf apartment at Woolloomooloo, bought for $13.75 million last week, and is guaranteed a minimum of $25 million if she stays with her Oscar award-winning husband for three years.\n\nCrowe would keep his Coffs Harbour estate, Nana Glen, if they split, and each child produced from the marriage would get a trust fund of about $5 million.\n\nEmu toil\n\nForget about snazzy, aerodynamic running suits: according to reports from Britain, one of the secrets to Cathy Freeman's athletic success has turned out to be the humble emu - or more precisely emu oil.\n\nFreeman's secret was revealed on Monday when the British athlete Paula Radcliffe won the London Marathon only a month after colliding with a cyclist during a training session. The collision left Radcliffe with a dislocated jaw, whiplash and injuries to her shoulders, knees and hip.\n\nRadcliffe told journalists she began using emu oil on her injuries on the recommendation of her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, who had originally been alerted to the alternative therapy by Freeman.\n\nHowever, when Spike asked Freeman's spokesman he said he knew nothing about emu oil use and was unable to confirm the reports that she had recommended it to anyone.\n\nThe oil, classified as a pharmaceutical product in Australia, is derived from emu fat and has been used as a therapy for painful joints by Aborigines for generations.\n\nHair-raising cash withdrawal\n\nA Norwegian jail inmate has given the term \"big hair\" a whole new meaning after he was caught with cash worth $A4450 hidden in his massive bush of dreadlocks.\n\n\"We're used to finding things hidden on the body, but cash in the hair - that's a new one,\" the deputy director of Aana prison in south-west Norway, Staale Olsen, told Reuters.\n\nChardonnay socialite\n\nThe world might call her Posh Spice, her husband may call her Vic, but her hairdresser knows her as a tasty drop. Beaujolais is the pet name developed for Victoria Beckham, because the ex-Spice Girl and wife of the footballer David Beckham is generally regarded as the inspiration for the dimwitted, vain character Chardonnay Lane from the British soap Footballers' Wives. Posh admitted to the program Tabloid Tales, made for BBC1, that she has been given the name in honour of the television show.\n\nQuote unquote\n\n'You know you are getting old when the candles cost more than the cake.'\n\n- One of Bob Hope's many memorable one-liners. Hollywood celebrations for the comic's 100th birthday on May 29 have already begun. On Tuesday Hope was named Hollywood's citizen of the century."
