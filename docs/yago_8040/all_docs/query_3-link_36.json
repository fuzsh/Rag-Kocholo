        "text": "The official line from ‘friends’ appears to be Crowe’s hectic filming schedule has become too much – he has seven major films coming out or being made in the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, the Daily Telegraph reports the glamour couple has been living separate lives for at least a year.\n\nSpencer and Crowe, both fairly guarded about their private life, have not commented on the split, unless you count this from Rusty’s spokesman: ”It is unlikely he will be making any statement.’\n\nMore ‘friends’, or perhaps the same ones, told the Sydney Morning Herald that it was Spencer’s decision to give the Gladiator the flick.\n\nShe is apparently ‘’handling things well’ and ‘yes, it was her decision’, reports the SMH.\n\nSeparate holidays, with Russell hanging out with their kids Charles and Tennyson solo, and cynicism over photos of the pair holding hands after it was rumoured Danielle had a fling with her Dancing With the Stars partner Damian Whitewood also form part of the commentary.\n\nCrowe is starring in the soon to be released blockbusters Les Miserables, Man of Steel and Broken City and is filming Noah at the moment, hence his wicked beard, but he made time to see his sons and the South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league side falter in the NRL semi-finals last month.\n\nSpencer wasn’t with him and multiple media outlets say that when the couple were in Sydney, Danielle stayed in their $10m Rose Bay home (the only property in his extensive portfolio under both of their names) while Russell preferred his $14m Woolloomooloo apartment. Tough choice.\n\nRussell also owns their deluxe property and cattle farm at Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, NSW, and a nearby pub, along with other businesses.\n\nSpencer could net a $25m windfall from the break-up, courtesy of a pre-nup which guarantees at least $15 plus a percentage of earnings on Russell’s investments and movie income.\n\nLast year, in an at-home interview with Daily Telegraph, Spencer spruiked her happy family, despite the absence of her husband.\n\n“We are very Aussie, very normal. We love a barbie – Russell is very good at those,” she said. ‘It’s great getting the family together.’\n\nDespite several music releases and her runner-up appearance on this year’s Dancing With the Stars, Spencer is still best known as Mrs Russell Crowe.\n\nSince the chances of you ever hearing her sing are slim, give this a run. Apologies in advance.\n\nImages via Getty"
