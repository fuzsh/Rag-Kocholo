        "text": "The wedding of hot-headed Hollywood actor Russell Crowe to longtime girlfriend and sometime pop singer Danielle Spencer went ahead Monday without the galaxy of celebrities Australians had persuaded themselves would be at the sunset nuptials on the New SouthWales central coast.\n\nAmong those rumoured to be in attendance who turned out to be somewhere else were singer-songwriter Sting, fashion designer Giorgio Armani, Tom Cruise and his ex-wife and fellow actor Nicole Kidman.\n\nInstead, the usually quiet cattle property 25 kilometres north of the sleepy seaside town of Coffs Harbour was noisy with family and close friends.\n\nIt was an inner circle unlikely to delight the camera crews.\n\nRidley Scott, the director who steered Crowe to an Oscar for best actor in the film Gladiator, was the only guest to get the cameras of the paparazzi popping.\n\nAmong the minor placing was Robert Mammone, who starred with New Zealand-born Crowe in his 1990 breakthrough film, The Crossing.\n\nIt was on the set of The Crossing that Sydney-raised Crowe, 39, met the English-born bottle blonde who became his first wife. It was the first wedding for 32-year-old Spencer as well.\n\nSpencer arrived for the traditional ceremony in a black limousine whose darkened windows disappointed fans who had camped out along the route from town. The bridal cavalcade was led by three black Harley Davidson motorbikes. Police cars brought up the rear.\n\nCrowe spent a fortune making a set on his Nana Glen cattle property for a three-day wedding bash. He built an ostentatious basilica-style chapel for the actual ceremony at a cost of 400,000 Australian dollars ($240,000). It has a 10-metre dome and lots of stained glass windows.\n\ndpa"
