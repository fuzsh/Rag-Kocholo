        "text": "Russell Crowe's method of purging the remnants of his marriage to Danielle Spencer is no common yard sale. The actor, who has been separated from Spencer for nearly five years, will be holding a public auction at Sotheby's Australia called \"The Art of Divorce\" on April 7, 2018, which also happens to be the couple's 15th wedding anniversary and Crowe's 54th birthday. The catalogue cover of the candidly named auction features a picture of Crowe toasting with a celebratory cocktail, as if congratulating himself on finally being a legally single man (and asking bidders to do so as well).\n\n“We’ve been separated over five years now, our divorce should be finalized around the time of the auction. Just as we collaborate on the upbringing of our kids, it’s easy for us to work together on something like this. I think she feels the same way I do in regards to just moving on things that help create space for the future,\" Crowe told Australia's Daily Telegraph. “On the practical side, this collection probably equates to three rooms full of things I’ll no longer have to care for, document, clean, tune, and insure.\"\n\nThe 227 lots have something for everyone—think fine art, antique vehicles, furniture, jewelry, musical instruments, and, of course, film paraphernalia. Specifically, the auction includes a rare platinum $50,000 Vacheron Constantin watch (Crowe, a watch fan in general, is selling off 29 in total); an extensive guitar collection; Denzel Washington and Ridley Scott chair backs from American Gangster (unexplainable, as of yet); Pittsburgh Steelers and Pirates memorabilia; costumes and swords from Gladiator, including a fully functional replica of a Roman chariot and life-size prop horses; and items from Cinderella Man, Master and Commander, Robin Hood, and Les Miserables.\n\nAD Pro\n\nThe Experimental Furniture of Carlo Bugatti Is Having a Moment\n\nDesigners and experts unpack the appeal—and complexities—behind these otherworldly furnishings\n\nClever\n\n28 Best Wedding Gifts (From Hyper Lux to Super Functional) That You Probably Haven’t Thought of Yet\n\nRing the bells—these thoughtful wedding gift ideas are a click away and sure to impress\n\nClever\n\nYou’d Never Know This Layered Manhattan Apartment Is a Rental\n\nInterior designer Matt McKay uses texture to create a lived-in feel\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nBen Affleck Buys $20.5 Million French-Country-Style Pacific Palisades Home\n\nThe Good Will Hunting star’s purchase of the Cliff May-designed dwelling comes after he and wife Jennifer Lopez listed their Beverly Hills estate for $68 million"
