        "text": "Hollywood star Russell Crowe and his wife, Danielle Spencer, have split up, a report said yesterday, with speculation that the Oscar-winning actor could face a US$25 million (HK$194 million) settlement.\n\nThe Australian couple have separated amicably after nine years of marriage, said, with both determined to protect their two children, aged eight and six, from any publicity.\n\nNo comment has been made by Crowe, 48, or his wife, 43.\n\nRumours that their relationship was in trouble surfaced in June when photos appeared showing Spencer on a night out with her partner Damian Whitewood, their arms around each other.\n\nAccording to , Crowe is in the United States filming the biblical epic while Spencer remains in Sydney with their two sons.\n\nOther reports said the demands of Crowe's acting career may have been a factor in the split, with the star away for much of the past year filming , , , and now .\n\nThe pair first met 22 years ago on the set of the film . They broke up and Crowe headed overseas, where he had an affair with US actress Meg Ryan.\n\nBut he returned to Australia and in 2002 proposed to Spencer, a singer and daughter of a well-known Australian children's show host. She is credited with helping tame Crowe, no stranger to controversy.\n\nWriting in a Sydney newspaper in 2009, he said he had learned from his mistakes.\n\n\"In the past, I have put my parents and my wife, and my extended family, through some terrible times and I'm sorry for every moment,\" he said.\n\nsaid Crowe has earned about US$150 million making films in the years since he married Spencer, and speculated that she could conservatively walk away with a settlement of at least US$25 million.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Russell Crowe 'headed for US$25m divorce'"
