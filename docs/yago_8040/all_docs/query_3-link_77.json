        "text": "When actor Russell Crowe visits St. John's in August to play music in two sold-out shows at the LSPU Hall, he'll bring company with him from his home in Australia.\n\nHis wife, actress and singer Danielle Spencer, will also perform in the LSPU Hall shows, called The Indoor Garden Party.\n\nSpencer will perform songs from her second album, Calling All Magicians. She describes the songs, which she wrote on piano, as \"atmospheric pop.\"\n\nUnlike her husband, she's never been to Newfoundland.\n\n\"He is very drawn to it, or was initially drawn to the Newfoundland music by his dear friend Alan Doyle,\" Spencer told CBC News.\n\n\"He has been there and absolutely loved it.\"\n\nCrowe is a good friend of Great Big Sea frontman — and St. John's citizen — Alan Doyle. The two have worked together for several years on musical projects. In 2005, Crowe paid a surprise visit to St. John's, and played at a downtown pub with Doyle. In 2010, Doyle had a supporting role in Crowe's film Robin Hood.\n\nSpencer and Crowe will share the stage of the LSPU Hall with Doyle, the Irish band Size2shoes, and actor-musicians Scott Grimes and Kevin Durand, who also had supporting roles in Robin Hood.\n\nAnd although Spencer isn't as familiar with the Newfoundland sound as Crowe is, she's hoping that will change during her upcoming visit.\n\n\"I would love to hear some music, so I'm hoping Alan and co will actually take me out somewhere and show us some Newfoundland bands.\""
