        "text": "Family clearly matters to Russell Crowe and Danielle Spencer. The Australian couple, who have only vaguely addressed rumors that they separated last fall, spent a relaxing evening together with their sons and a few pals at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills on Thursday, June 27.\n\nCrowe and Spencer, who sat with a group of about 10 people outside in the restaurant's courtyard, \"were both talking to their kids and being attentive,\" an onlooker tells Us Weekly of the parents to sons Charles, 8, and Tennyson, 6.\n\n\"Russell and Danielle were sitting next to each other and seemed to get along well — but were never affectionate,\" the eyewitness added.\n\nLater in the evening, after the children had left the table, the pair continued to chat with another couple in a \"loud conversation,\" with Crowe \"smoking a cigarette and talking very animatedly, [seemingly] about politics.\"\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor, 49, and musician, 44, were first rumored to have split after a nine-year marriage back in October 2012, according to Australia's Sydney Morning Herald. The paper reported that the split was amicable, and that Spencer was staying in Sydney with the boys while Crowe was focusing more on his career.\n\nNeither individuals ever addressed the rumors, except in very vague comments on social media.\n\nPHOTOS: Russell's pre-marriage fling with Meg Ryan\n\n\"As soon as I finish this job and can get home, my priority is to try to bring my family back together,\" the Man of Steel actor wrote on Twitter in December, referring to shooting Winter's Tale in New York City and traveling to promote Les Miserables. \"I need to go home & be with my children. Cannot believe how f–ked up my schedule has become this year.\"\n\nSpencer took to Facebook to address her fans as well, mildly acknowledging a tumultuous past couple of months, though she never addressed the split rumors head-on.\n\n\"Hi Everyone! I'm sorry I haven't visited here for a while, things have been keeping me somewhat busy of late,\" she wrote. \"I just wanted to thank you all for bearing with me and also for your messages of support, it means a lot to me.\""
