        "text": "Russell Crowe has separated from his wife of nine years Danielle Spencer, according to an Australian news report.\n\nNews of the separation come months after Spencer, 43, was spotted out drunk with her Dancing With The Stars partner Damian Whitewood. Photos of Spencer with Whitewood caused an uproar. But Crowe later dismissed rumors about their relationship and gave his wife a lingering kiss in front of cameras at a Sydney airport.\n\nCrowe, 48, is splitting from Spencer on friendly terms, according to the report by Sydney Morning\n\nHerald.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\nOne of the reasons rumored to have caused the impending divorce is The Gladiator actor's busy filming schedule. Crowe has six movies due out within the next 12 months, including â€“ Man with the Iron Fist, Les Miserables, Broken City, Superman, Noah and the Winter's Tale. Spencer is said to be left alone to raise the couple's two young children, Charles and Tennyson, aged eight and six.\n\nCrowe met Spencer 22 years ago on the set of The Crossing. The Oscar award-winning actor started courting Spencer only after ending his relationship with romantic comedy sweetheart Meg Ryan. At the time, Ryan was married for 10 years to actor Dennis Quaid so her romance with Crowe was a highly publicized affair.\n\nRyan later defended Crowe, telling Oprah Winfrey that Crowe wasn't a \"homewrecker.\" She said she didn't leave Quaid because of Crowe but because her marriage wasn't working.\n\nAccording to the Morning Herald, Crowe had thought of marrying Spencer the first time he met her. But it wasn't until 2003 before the two got marrired at a chapel on Crowe's farm in Australia's New South Wales."
