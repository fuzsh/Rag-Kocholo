        "text": "Hollywood star Russell Crowe and his long-time singer girlfriend Danielle Spencer will tie the knot today in Australia's showbiz wedding of the year.\n\nThe ceremony will take place later today inside a $250,000 non-denominational family chappel on Crowe's sprawling property in Nana Glen, about 25km north-west of Coffs Harbour.\n\nBishop Philip Huggins, the former bishop of Grafton, flew in from Melbourne on Friday to oversee rehearsals before he marries the couple today in an event that has attracted intense international media interest.\n\nBut tight security - including a full-time security guard posted at the entrance to Crowe's property - is aimed at ensuring only about 80 guests, mainly family members and close friends, will witness today's ceremony and celebrations.\n\nAmong the steady stream of arrivals jetting in yesterday was one of the wedding's essential ingredients - the bride's dress.\n\nThe carefully-crafted Georgio Armani creation shared a jet with Australian Chamber Orchestra creative director Richard Tognetti, who arrived at Grafton Airport yesterday morning.\n\nCrowe, 38, met Spencer, 32, in 1990 on the set of film The Crossing.\n\nActor Robert Mammone, with whom Crowe worked alongside in the same film, will be one of his groomsmen, as will his business manager Mark Dumbrell and British journalist Martin Palmer.\n\nSpencer will have three bridesmaids - her friends Caroline Grose and Racquel Martel, and her husband-to-be's niece Chelsea Crowe.\n\nAmong arrivals for the wedding celebrations so far are entertainers Paul Capsis, Wendy Matthews and her band, and members of ABBA impersonators Bjorn Again, who will all feature in tonight's entertainment line-up along with DJs and a spectacular light show.\n\nMembers of Crowe's rock band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts - bassist Garth Adam, guitarist/vocalist/percussionist Dave Wilkins and trumpeter Stewart Kirwan - have also hit town.\n\nFriday saw the arrival of acclaimed British film-maker Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator, which earned Crowe a best actor Oscar in 2001.\n\nHealth permitting, media mogul Kerry Packer is expected at Nana Glen for the wedding today.\n\n- AAP"
