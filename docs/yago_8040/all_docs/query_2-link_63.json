        "text": "The decades-long tug of war between Australia and New Zealand over which country has the right to call actor Russell Crowe “our Russ” has been complicated further, thanks to requirements by the Australian government’s immigration department.\n\nDespite having migrated to Australia with his family in 1968, when he was just four years old, Crowe has claimed he was twice denied Australian citizenship. The 50-year-old actor revealed in an interview with British magazine Radio Times that changes made to immigration requirements in 2001 have seen his applications, made in 2006 and 2013, turned down.\n\n“No matter how long you’d been in the country, if you weren’t in Australia for the majority of 2000 to 2002 – when I was particularly busy filming overseas – you can’t become a citizen,” he told the magazine.\n\nWhile his passport may read New Zealand, Crowe made it clear which nation he called home. “I’ve been voted one of Australia’s 50 national treasures. I’ve even had my face on an Australian stamp, the only non-Australian to do so, apart from the Queen, of course. It’s so, so … unreasonable.”\n\nThis has been disputed, however, by the Department of Immigration who told Fairfax, “According to departmental records, Mr Crowe has not submitted an application for a permanent visa or for Australian citizenship.”\n\nSince beginning his acting career in the mid-80s, including a brief turn on Neighbours, Crowe has appeared in several important Australian films such as 1991’s Proof and 1994’s The Sum of Us. His defining role as a suburban skinhead in 1992’s Romper Stomper earned him a best actor award from the Australian Film Institute.\n\nAnd while he soon moved to Hollywood to star in such films as LA Confidential, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind, he has maintained a strong relationship with his adopted country. His recent directorial debut, The Water Diviner, tells the story of an Australian farmer who travels to Gallipoli in search of his three missing sons.\n\nCrowe owns several properties in Australia, including an apartment in Sydney’s Woolloomooloo. He was formerly married to Australian singer-songwriter Danielle Spencer, with whom he has two children.\n\nAside from his career in film, Crowe is well known in Australia for his support of South Sydney’s rugby league team, the Rabbitohs, of which he is a major shareholder.\n\nIn a December interview with the Guardian, the actor spoke of his attachment to life in Australia. “Even through the largest periods of success in my life, my principle aim – when I finish the job – has always been to get home. To go to the bush and, more recently, to be with my kids.”\n\nChanges to trans-Tasman law introduced stricter requirements for New Zealanders wishing to become Australian citizens. Applicants who were neither in the country on 26 February 2001, nor in the country for at least 12 months in the two years prior, must now be permanent residents in order to apply for Australian citizenship.\n\nMost New Zealanders who migrate to Australia are automatically granted a Special Category visa permitting them to live and work in the country indefinitely. However, the visa does not allow for the same rights and benefits as Australian citizens – including the right to vote and access to student loans."
