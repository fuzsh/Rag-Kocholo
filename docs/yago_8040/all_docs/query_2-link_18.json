Get Cingular Russell!\n\nOh....and do NOT go by this NEW version that his publicist, a Robin Baum...softened TODAY..stating he threw it cuz the phone wouldn't work.\n\nTh ORIGINAL Press on Monday was that he threw the phone when he heard that his New movie, \"Cinderella Man\", was WAY down and underperformed box office earnings in this past..the film's VERY first weekend. The film is flopping. THAT's why he threw the phone.\n\nAnger Management dear...\n\nlink MexQueenFM\n\n07.06.2005 16:58 that's great!\n\nbut i was actually expecting a jab or sumthing from him , oh well brENsKi\n\n07.06.2005 17:21 he ain't been charged for throwing the phone\n\nhe's been charged with assault - the guy who was using it was on the 16th floor and still attached to the phone when RC threw it over the balcony doremi\n\n07.06.2005 19:27\n\n<font color =#CC00FF>***Marial-B*** wrote: Those kind of pictures aren't for being release on summer :P he has to know that\n\nI said that to my friends yesterday. Who the hell releases a character driven quiet underdog film, during the summer blockbuster months with Star Wars, Batman, The Fantastic Four, etc. all the kiddies movies.\n\nEveryone in Hollywood KNOWS you release these kinds of films in the fall and right before Christmas...and so they are fresh in people's mind's for the USA's Academy Awards.\n\nIDIOTS....\n\nBut Crowe is just plain an ass anyhow. He is violent and a jerk and is always getting arrested or reprimanded for his actions.\n\nFew years ago when he WON the British equivelent of The Academy Awards for \"A Beatiful Mind\" and they had to cut his acceptence speech short (which is normal practice at award shows to have enough time for everyone & the awrds to be given out)...\n\n...Crowe PINNED against the wall, The President & Head Of the British version of The Academy Awards, and wouldn't let the poor guy go, and Crowe raised his fists and cursed at him. I SAW the footage on the news. Crowe was even so stupid, he did this in front of a ton of the TV crew filming/taping the show, so it was all taped/filmed...so he had ro go to court.\n\nHere's a recap a bit from this article about it too.\n\n\"It wasn't the first instance of reported bad behavior by Crowe. The actor got into a brawl at a chic London restaurant in November 2002.\"\n\n\"Earlier that year, he reportedly was abusive toward a TV executive when the British Broadcasting Corp. edited his acceptance speech out of a broadcast of the British Academy Film Awards.\"\n\nASS! Worse than any rock star. Crowe's ego could squash Robbie Williams' ego like a bug! Robbie's a lightweight next to Crowe!\n\nHey....there's a thought!!!! :) doremi\n\n07.06.2005 19:55 Mike Preston.... Here me!... (again doing my Luke Skywalker impression).\n\nThink there is any chance of ANYONE, EVER getting an autograph from Russell Crowe..without getting a knuckle sandwich! Now here's a peach for all of us at QZ.\n\nHey Russell..Russell, There's Robbie Williams! He wants your autograph. Sic em Russell, sic em'!\n\nThis is great. NOW we know how to get rid of the dreaded Robbie! doremi\n\n09.06.2005 14:02 He apologized on \"The David Letterman Show\" last night, but the press are calling him now (after his role as Maximus in the movie \"Gladiator\")...\n\n\"Jerkus\" Maximus.\n\nHere's the update. It's hilarious.\n\nlink bohemian 11513\n\n09.06.2005 14:06 Death penalty for him .. no more, no less!!! :-))\n\nWhat an asshole... The Fairy King\n\n09.06.2005 15:13 Born in New Zealand in sixty-four\n\nA hot-headed actor named Russell Crowe\n\nHe loves to act but he loves one thing more:\n\nFight-in' Round The World\n\nHe fight his directors and he fights his fans\n\nIt's a problem no one understands\n\nIf there's two things he love it's fighting and,\n\nFight-in' Round The World\n\nMakin' movies, makin' music and\n\nFight-in' Round The World!\n\n[a shot of Russell fighting off some Japanese]\n\nxD Erin\n\n09.06.2005 15:14 I cannot stand Russell Crowe..:-P doremi\n\n09.06.2005 15:26\n\nErin wrote: I cannot stand Russell Crowe..:-P\n\nJoin the club. I don't get why Hollywood Directors love him. On top of everything else, I've seen \"Gladiator\", \"The Quick & The Dead\", \"Virtuosity\", \"A Beautiful Mind\".\n\nCARDBOARD has more range, emotion, and talent than him. He sucks. So what's the deal?\n\nOh....I got a promo copy of his band's latest CD about 2 years ago, the band he fronts called 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts...and Crowe STARTED out as a rock singer...he's even WORSE at that.\n\nCARDBOARD sings better too!

I hate Russell Crowe.. you know, just because I am lazy and do not feel like doing a search, is he related to Cameron Crowe who just happens to be married to the lovely Nancy Wilson of Heart? doremi\n\n09.06.2005 16:14\n\nMike Preston wrote: I am in the same field..

THAT's how he met Nancy. Though he moved on to directing big films like \"Jerry McGuire\", since he started out as a rock journalist, he STILL is close to that community and he let's Nancy compose/score alot of music for his movies...and Ann & Nancy did a song for, Cameron's 1991 film, \"Singles\" as their side project The LoveMongers singing Zeppelin's \"Battle Of Evermore\".\n\nI think Nancy scored \"Almost Famous\" & \"Jerry McGuire\" too.\n\nLucky bastard TOURED on the bus at 15 FNG years old, writing for Rolling Stone, WITH Led Zeppelin, The Allman Brothers Band, Fleetwood Mac.\n\nRussell is an evil \"alien\" from Austrailia born & bred...who..cooincidentally...as I posted before..BEGAN as a serious rock musician/singer with several records. Then LATER, Russell became an actor, and Russell married Danielle Spensor the back up singer IN HIS band, 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts. deleted user\n\n09.06.2005 21:36 What a weenie. dragonzflame\n\n10.06.2005 19:11 Russell Crowe is a dick.
