They were being really playful and jokey with one another. You could see they really hit it off.\"\n\nThey then went back to Russell's suite with a group of friends where they stayed up until the early hours singing songs around his piano.\n\nThe witness added: \"They then went back to Russell's room with some friends where they were partying until broad daylight.\n\n\"They were singing really loudly together around the piano, belting out some show tunes, and they looked pretty happy when everyone left them to it.\""
