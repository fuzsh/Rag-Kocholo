        "text": "Russell Crowe spent some time with his two sons over the holidays, as ex-wife Danielle Spencer shared a rare photo of them in Italy.\n\nTaking to Instagram, the Australian actress shared a photo of the Gladiator actor, 59, with his sons Charles, 20, and Tennyson, 17, by the Trevi Fountain at night.\n\nShe captioned the photo: \"My lads and their Dad ! Love this photo #sons #myboys #mylads #father #fatherhood #dad #family #familia #familytime #russellcrowe #italia #italy #italyüáÆüáπ #italytravel #holiday #holidays #europe #europe_vacations #brothers #brotherhood #brother #trevifountain #roma #rome\".\n\nThe two boys looked so similar to their father, as they grinned at the camera.\n\nDespite Russell and Danielle divorcing in 2018, their bond remains strong as they've stayed good friends in raising their sons.\n\nTo celebrate his 59th birthday, Danielle posted a sweet tribute to Russell on Instagram. It would have been their 20th wedding anniversary.\n\nPosting a black-and-wife-photo of the actor with Charles and Tennyson, she wrote: Twenty years ago today, I married the father of my boys. While it is no longer our anniversary, it is still that guy's birthday.\"\n\nShe added: \"Happy Birthday @russellcrowe #birthday #birthdaywishes #ex #father #russellcrowe #family #friends\"\n\nRussell is now dating real estate agent Britney Theriot. The couple keep a relatively low profile, although they were first linked in 2020.\n\nIt's no surprise that Russell was spotted in Rome, as in 2022 he was appointed the ambassador of Rome to the world by the city's mayor. The actor makes the most out of his title, regularly visiting the city.\n\nWhile the former Gladiator actor is not set to appear in Ridley Scott's sequel, which will star Paul Mescal. He revealed that he does feel a bit jealous about all the talk of Gladiator 2, however.\n\n‚ÄúIt has nothing to do with me. In that world, I am dead. Six feet under\", he said at the Karlovy Film Festival. \"But I do admit to a certain tinge of jealousy, because it reminds me of when I was younger and what it meant for me, in my life.‚Äù\n\nHe continued: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about the cast, I don‚Äôt know anything about the plot. I am dead! But I know that if Ridley has decided to do a second part of the story, over 20 years later, he must have had very strong reasons. I can‚Äôt think of this movie being anything other than spectacular.‚Äù"
