        "text": "Danielle Spencer, the former wife of actor Russell Crowe, has said that she prioritised raising their children over her own acting and singing career.\n\nSpeaking to Stellar, the now 51-year-old opened up about why she felt it was so important for her to remain at home while her 56-year-old ex husband's Hollywood career went from strength to strength.\n\n\"It was difficult because I always felt that to keep our family together both of us couldn't be working and there came a point where I had to prioritise the kids, where they needed to be and their schooling,\" she told the publication.\n\n\"Obviously Russell's career was going gangbusters and I just felt like, 'This is not my time.' I absolutely love being a mother and I wouldn't change a thing, but I didn't feel I could prioritise my career for a while there. The kids needed a parent who was present.\"\n\nSpencer's onscreen roles include appearances in Minder (1979), Mission: Impossible (1988), Hampton Court (1991) and her most recent film credit in 2000's BeatMaster TV series. The Australian actress also has two music releases to her name — her 2002 debut album White Monkey and 2010's Calling All Magicians.\n\nAfter meeting Crowe while filming the 1990 Australian drama The Crossing, Spencer and the A Beautiful Mind star's on and off-again relationship endured for years before they took the plunge and tied the knot on the Gladiator star's 39th birthday in 2003.\n\nThe pair who share two boys — Charlie, 16, and Tennyson, 14 — separated in 2012 but didn't finalise their divorce until 2018.\n\nDespite their split, Spencer said that they both \"have a lot of respect for each other.\" She added, \"I consider him to be a member of my family.\"\n\nThe former All Saints actress told the publication that they have managed to remain friends.\n\n\"The marriage ended, but that didn't mean our friendship ended. We've had holidays together in the past and we can happily sit down and chat.\"\n\nSince splitting with the Oscar winner, Spencer told Stellar that her relationship of four years with art dealer Adam Long has been \"going very well.\"\n\nWith a new musical release on the horizon, Spencer told the outlet that she is \"in a really good place.\"\n\nShe added, \"My kids are doing well and life is peaceful.\""
