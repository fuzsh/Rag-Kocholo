        "text": "SYDNEY, Australia (Reuters) -- Hollywood actor Russell Crowe will tie the knot with his Australian sweetheart Danielle Spencer at his remote Australian spread on Monday, his 39th birthday.\n\nPublicist Wendy Day told Reuters the Oscar-winning \"Gladiator\" star and actress-singer Spencer planned a low-key, private affair, with about 80 close friends and family but no Hollywood A-listers.\n\nThe ceremony will take place in a domed chapel local newspapers have dubbed \"Saint Russell's Basilica\" on Crowe's 325-hectare (803-acre) farm at Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, around 500 km (310 miles) north of Sydney.\n\nNewspapers said Texas Governor Rick Perry, a long-time friend of New Zealand-born, Australian-raised Crowe, might be there. Longtime pal Nicole Kidman, who last month won the Best Actress Oscar, will not be able to attend although rumors are flying that Sting will.\n\nGossip columns in Australian and British newspapers say the wedding dress will be provided by Giorgio Armani, and the rings will come from Cartier in Paris.\n\nThey say the three-day bash will include a cricket match -- possibly with fallen cricket star Shane Warne, banned for a year for taking a prohibited diuretic -- and love poetry from Crowe.\n\nCopyright 2003 Reuters.
