No more running.\n\nWe stop them here.\n\nYou know, it ended up being\n\nquite an incredible calling card for me.\n\nIt definitely went ahead of me and did its own work.\n\nSometimes to my detriment though,\n\nI probably had at least a dozen conversations with directors\n\nin Los Angeles who had somehow been told the story\n\nthat I was in fact, a skinhead who had been discovered\n\non the streets, dragged into the film world.\n\nBut that wasn't the case at all.\n\nThe next choice that I made in terms of a commercial movie\n\nwas to play a gay rugby-playing plumber\n\nin a movie called The Sum of Us.\n\nI would just always like the idea\n\nthat somebody who is into Romper Stomper\n\nfor the wrong reasons, saw that I was in another film,\n\nbought a ticket and now they're sitting in The Sum of Us\n\nwondering how the fuck they got there.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nLA Confidential.\n\nMy process then was not to do smaller roles.\n\nI was already doing roles where my name was above the title.\n\nSo I tried to stay in that pocket.\n\nI got the call from Curtis Hanson.\n\nHe was really happy to find out\n\nthat I had in fact done American movies already,\n\nwhich would give him potentially an easier point\n\nof argument to the studio 'cause his idea\n\nwas to cast relative unknowns.\n\nYou know, he sent me the script,\n\nand I read the James Elroy book LA Confidential.\n\nAnd the thing that freaked me out was what I described\n\nas physically the biggest man\n\nin the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nI kind of got back on the phone with Curtis.\n\nWe hadn't met yet. [chuckles] I said,\n\nMan, I don't know what impression you might've got\n\nfrom the movies that you've seen, but you know,\n\nI'm not really like a big bloke, man, you know.\n\nHis vibe on that was that everything that he required\n\nin Bud White he'd seen in other work,\n\nand that was immaterial to him.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nMerry Christmas to you, officer.\n\nThat obvious, huh?\n\nIt's practically stamped on your forehead.\n\nIt was a weird situation\n\nbecause the big overarching studio\n\nand the studio directly making the movie,\n\ndidn't like Curtis's idea.\n\nSo I was flown in and I was put up at a hotel\n\nin the time we were supposed to be rehearsing,\n\nbut you know, I've got friends in the business and stuff\n\nand people would be telling me that Sean Penn\n\nwas going to be playing my role.\n\nYou know, I was talking to the director\n\nand that was my character to play.\n\nBut at one point in time,\n\nthey stopped paying my hotel bill\n\nand rental car bill, stopped providing me with per diem.\n\nAnd I really didn't have, you know,\n\na lot in my life at the time.\n\nSo I wasn't able to pay for that level of hotel, et cetera.\n\nAnd so it got pretty heavy and to the point where,\n\nyou know, there was a few times there\n\nwhere I was going down the back stairs,\n\nso the hotel manager wouldn't stop me in the foyer\n\nand ask me what was going on.\n\nI could feel all of that stuff around me.\n\nAnd the only thing I had to go on was the surety\n\nof the director that he'd made his choice.\n\nSo I just went with that and I just kept turning up to work.\n\nI think if there was ever a day where I got frustrated by it\n\nand I hadn't turned up to work,\n\nthat would have been the chink in the armor\n\nthat they would've used to shift me\n\nout of the role, you know?\n\nAnd the same process happened with Guy Pierce.\n\nWhy don't you go after criminals for a change\n\ninstead of cops?\n\nStensland got we he deserved and so will you.\n\nCurtis asked me about Guy.\n\nHe was a regular character on a soap opera\n\ncalled Neighbors that I dropped in on\n\nand did like a small character for two or three days.\n\nAnd I had a girlfriend.\n\nI eventually ended up marrying some many, many years later,\n\nand I'm a very jealous person.\n\nAnd we walked into this pub and Guy was there,\n\nand he greeted her effusively and gave her a cuddle\n\nand a kiss and I'm so standing there.\n\nHe hasn't even acknowledged my existence\n\nat this point in time. [chuckles]\n\nSo I waited 'til there was a lull in their conversation\n\nand I stepped forward and I gave him a kiss,\n\nand I behaved effusively like he was doing with Danielle\n\nbecause why can't I join in? [giggles]\n\nAnd he didn't do anything.\n\nHe acknowledged with his eyes, Sorry, mate.\n\nThat was a bit dicky of me to cut you\n\nout of the conversation.\n\nAnd later on, when I was talking to Curtis,\n\nand I told him that story and I told him how\n\ncompletely cool under fire Guy Pierce had been,\n\nand I think that really fell into the part of Guy\n\nthat Curtis had thought he'd seen in the auditions.\n\nAnd so that's how we became that team in that movie.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe Insider.\n\nAt the time, definitely the most difficult job I'd done.\n\nI got contacted by Michael Mann, you know,\n\nand he asked me to fly down to Los Angeles and talk to him\n\nand he sent me the script and I read it.\n\nI couldn't work out what character that he wanted me to play\n\nbecause it was a script full of middle aged men.\n\nI rang him first, I said,\n\nI don't get what character.\n\nAnd he said, The guy, man, the lead guy, you know.\n\nand I was like, That guy, he's 50-something.\n\nI'm 30 something.\n\nMichael said, Look, just come and see me.\n\nCome talk to me.\n\nWe had a very, very long conversation without any fences.\n\nAnd we talked about this and that to do with society\n\nand corporate malfeasance and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAnd it was a great chat, you know?\n\nAnd I said to him, Look, I don't get why you want me\n\nto play this character. I'm not the age.\n\nI don't look anything like him.\n\nMichael sorta came around from behind his desk and he said,\n\nListen, man, I didn't fly down here\n\nbecause of what you looked like.\n\nAnd he put his hand on my chest, he said,\n\nI flew down to meet you because of what you have in here,\n\nand pushing that, you know, and it was like in that moment,\n\nI was like, I'm gonna work with this guy,\n\n[giggles] I'm gonna do anything he wants,\n\nI'm going to climb any mountain.\n\nSo he really worked out who I was\n\n'cause he fricking got a hook in me very deeply.\n\nYou know, Jeffrey is, you know, a nice fellow,\n\nbut he's kind of an uncomfortable fellow.\n\nAnd he had a very strange journey, you know,\n\nwhere he begins in the Bronx and ends up\n\nsort of working in Japan and doing all these things\n\nthat gave his voice, such a crazy, colorful array\n\nbecause you know, now he's working in the tobacco industry,\n\nfor example, and he's working in Kentucky.\n\nSo as a scientist, he's never used words\n\nconnected to the tobacco industry.\n\nSo when he says those words,\n\nthey have a pronounced Southern lilt,\n\nbut a lot of the time he has that Bronx base,\n\nbut the Bronx base is also infused with the fact\n\nthat he spoke Japanese for a number of years in his life.\n\nSo I'm looking at it going,\n\nWhat the fuck do I do with this?\n\nYou know, it was a bit of a mind-blowing experience.\n\nSo what you're saying is it isn't enough\n\nthat you fired me for no good reason.\n\nNow you questioned my integrity on top of the humiliation\n\nof being fired, you threatened me, you threatened my family.\n\nIt never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement.\n\nI will tell you, Mr. Sandifer and Brown and Williamson\n\nto fuck me.\n\nFuck you.\n\nMichael is such a perfectionist.\n\nAnd he wants to really know what he has,\n\nand what he's going for and stuff.\n\nSo, you know, one example,\n\nmy very young hair would just not sit\n\nlike Jeffrey Wigand's old hair, so we bleached it.\n\nThe color came back, we bleached it again.\n\nColor came back.\n\nI think we ended up bleaching it seven times\n\nin a period of three weeks.\n\nAnd then we started to shave the volume out of it, you know?\n\nmy young hair would just go [spits]\n\nand it would be there the next day.\n\nIf we're going to do it that way,\n\nwe would have to be shaving my head\n\nin those areas every morning.\n\nAnd still, no matter how much volume we cut out of my hair,\n\nno matter how many under cuts and everything that we did,\n\none or two days later, it would go [whooshes air]\n\nand it would find a way [laughs] to cover my head.\n\nSo we were standing there doing a screen test,\n\nand I was so pleased to find out that Dante Spinotti,\n\nwho I'd met first on the Quick and the Dead\n\ndirector of photography was on The Insider as well\n\n'cause you know, I had a great relationship\n\nwith his camera crew guys\n\nand I was really excited to know that it was him.\n\nAnd I was standing there and possibly a little offensive,\n\n[giggles] I said, It's not working with the hair, man.\n\nI've got to get a wig,\n\nI've got to have like really shit hair.\n\nI've got to have the hair like his, and pointed at Dante.\n\nAnd Dante's got lovely hair, but it was just,\n\nit was the right age, you know?\n\nAnd it was behaving in the way that Jeffrey's hair behaved,\n\nyou know, so we got an incredible wig maker.\n\nWith the wig, it just made me feel like the character,\n\nyou know, and that was like a bit,\n\nit was quite a big thing for me\n\nbecause even when I'm doing The Insider,\n\nI'm still really formulating who I am as a film actor.\n\nIt's probably my what, 16th or 17th movie by then.\n\nThat really showed me that because of the visual nature\n\nof film, if somebody says you're gonna play a pirate,\n\nget an eye patch, rent a parrot.\n\nYou might immediately feel more connected\n\nto the character of a pirate if you do so.\n\nI did not feel I could play that role\n\nuntil I looked in the mirror and it looked like Jeffrey.\n\nNow, other times I've done characters\n\nwhere I feel I don't necessarily need to be accurate,\n\nbut because his story was so real,\n\nbecause it had such a deep, psychological effect\n\non him and his family.\n\nAnd because it was such an important step\n\nin the legal and cultural life of America,\n\nI just felt this need to honor him\n\nand be very careful about honoring him.\n\nSo I met a whole bunch of fantastic actors in that job.\n\nTo be surrounded by people like Al Pacino\n\nand Christopher Plummer.\n\nSomebody from the film company at the time\n\nrang me to tell me that they were going to mount\n\nan Academy Award campaign on my behalf.\n\nAnd I said, Cool, so that's like me and Al.\n\nThat's fantastic.\n\nAnd they said, Well, we're gonna put our emphasis on you.\n\nAnd we asked Mr. Pacino, and he said, Back the kid.\n\nIt's a massive thing for him to have done.\n\nYou mentioned my name.\n\nYou haven't talked to anybody about me.\n\nBrian Williamson know I spoke.\n\nHow the hell do I know about Brian Williamson?\n\nThat was just after I talked to you.\n\nI do not like coincidences.\n\nWell, I don't like paranoid accusation.\n\nTime came up later in my career.\n\nIt was a movie Cinderella Man.\n\nPaul Giamatti's mum died during the course\n\nof shooting Cinderella Man.\n\nAnd I made her a promise on the phone\n\nthat Paul was such an incredible actor\n\nthat he would be nominated.\n\nAnd the studio asked me what I wanted to do.\n\nAnd I said, Back the kid,\n\nand Paul Giamatti got an Academy Award nomination.\n\nSo The Insider is very, very important\n\nfor my growth as an actor\n\nand also extremely important\n\nfor the way my career went just after that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nCinderella Man.\n\nI'd worked with Ron Howard on A Beautiful Mind,\n\nand I gave him the script and he said,\n\nLook, I understand why you want to do it.\n\nHe said, But I don't understand why\n\nI would want to direct it.\n\nIt's like ground so many people have covered.\n\nI said to him, Well, it's just like\n\n'A Beautiful Mind, man.\n\nThe importance of this story is that it's true.\n\nThis guy, this is what happened to him.\n\nHe was a boxer, he was unsuccessful.\n\nHe owned a cab company.\n\nWell, if you own that cab company in Manhattan\n\nand Wall Street crashes in 1929,\n\nand people can't afford to take cabs,\n\nit's possibly the only time in history\n\nthat owning a cab company in Manhattan\n\nhas been a negative thing.\n\nBut so, you know, Jim from going through his sporting career\n\nand rising to a certain middle-class position sank and slid\n\nall the way back to the bottom again,\n\nand then out of pure desperation,\n\nrose and became a champion.\n\nAnd I just I'd fallen in love with that story\n\nwhen I first read it, and it was super important to me.\n\nAnd I think I was very passionate with Ron\n\ndescribing why it was important.\n\nSo he came on board and, you know,\n\nit's just one of the nature of the film.\n\nIf he hadn't have come on board,\n\nI probably don't make that film in the cycle of things\n\nif we had to start from scratch and find another director,\n\nit probably reshapes, you know?\n\nI had a run of bad luck\n\nand this time around, I know what I'm fighting for.\n\nOh yeah. What's that, Jimmy?\n\nMilk.\n\nYou know, through the course of the process of that,\n\nit was like a physically extremely tough role.\n\nI've actually done more difficult physical roles since,\n\nbut at that time, the preparation for that film\n\nand if I could show you a list\n\nof what we were doing on a daily basis, it was heavy stuff.\n\nAnd, you know, Ron is very serious director,\n\nand he brought Angelo Dundee,\n\nwho trained 15 world champions into my life.\n\nAnd Angelo constructed the energy in the training camp.\n\nAnd I mean, sometimes you just get so lucky.\n\nHaving Angelo Dundee with all of his wisdoms and experiences\n\ncome into my life as a mentor, and you know,\n\nI only knew him alive for eight years,\n\nbut what a joyful person he was.\n\nWhat an inspirational person, you know?\n\nOccasionally I would sort of just say to him,\n\nI don't know how I'm gonna do this.\n\nHe just had a way of making you believe.\n\nSo it required an immense amount of discipline\n\nto play that character.\n\nYou know, I was so into that world,\n\nso into that place.\n\nWhen I made the decision that because I'm playing a boxer,\n\nat a certain point in time,\n\nI would have a prosthetic nose and a certain point in time,\n\nI would have cauliflower prosthetic ears.\n\nAlso because of the black and white photographs\n\nI'd seen a Jim Braddock,\n\nhe had very kind of wing nut eaters, you know,\n\npoking up from the side of the head.\n\nSo we had these pieces made,\n\nwhich pushed my ears out like that.\n\nAnd Ron Howard came to see me and he's like,\n\nSo as a guy who grew up with ears like that,\n\nI'm just wondering if we need to make that,\n\nkind of decision. Do we need to be that accurate?\n\nI kinda saw what their problem was later on\n\nwhen they sort of were trying to market the movie.\n\nEvery image, you know, even if it was a romantic image,\n\nand they were focusing on the love story\n\nbetween my character and Renee's character,\n\n[chuckles] I got the nose, I got the ears.\n\n[chuckles]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nGladiator.\n\nAfter I'd finished The Insider,\n\nRidley and Michael had a conversation.\n\nI went to meet Ridley.\n\nI looked like absolute shit.\n\nI don't see how he could possibly have seen me\n\nas a Roman general, but we really got on.\n\nHe had gigantic ideas and I kinda thought\n\nmost of them were impossible really,\n\nand it certainly wasn't on the page.\n\nThere was no script that we could be enthused about.\n\nBut what I was was enthused about was the simple idea.\n\nIt's 184 A.D. or 180 A.D.\n\nYou're a Roman general,\n\nand you're being directed by Ridley Scott, you know?\n\nSo that drove my motivation a lot.\n\nIt was very difficult putting on those clothes and going,\n\nOh yeah, off we go, I'm a Roman general.\n\nAnd I know that Joaquin Phoenix had the same problem\n\n'cause we talked about it, you know?\n\nThe heights to those characters had to go to, you know,\n\nand it's very different because at that stage,\n\nif you're wearing clothes like that,\n\nyou're probably doing a comedy or a piss take.\n\nSword and sandal things had been\n\nout of vogue for a long time.\n\nThat whole idea was constructed around the sincerity\n\nof the core journey of man's vengeance\n\nfor the death of his wife and child.\n\n[suspenseful music]\n\nMy name is Maximus Decimus Meridius\n\ncommander of the armies of the North,\n\ngeneral with the Felix legions,\n\nloyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius.\n\nFather to a murdered son,\n\nhusband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance\n\nin this life or the next.\n\nIt's funny though.\n\nYou see the backstage or behind the scenes footage\n\nand everybody's just goofing around and being silly.\n\nAnd you know, the reason you do that\n\nis you're saving all your serious shit\n\nfor after the guy says action.\n\nYou know, most people, the complexities of film are such\n\nthat you have to have everything organized\n\nto the nth degree.\n\nYou're scheduling, you're purchasing, you're crewing.\n\nAll of these things have to be worked out,\n\nand particularly with your art department and you know,\n\nyour set dressers and everything.\n\nSo everybody knows what they're doing.\n\nThat's the way you make a film.\n\nHowever, we were making a movie\n\nthat grew as we made the movie\n\nand little things became big ideas.\n\nAnd we were being fluid within that gigantic\n\nhundred plus million dollar budget shape,\n\nwhich is all about schedules and disciplines\n\nand being exact about things even down to\n\nthis one conversation I had with Ridley, where I said,\n\nI wanted to decapitate a guy [chuckles]\n\nat the end of this fight sequence.\n\nAnd he said, Well, look, I can't just add a decapitation.\n\nThat's a pretty heavy thing.\n\nI'm gonna to have to discuss it\n\nwith the studio and everything.\n\nAnd I said, Look, this is the way the choreography\n\ngoes at the moment, and I showed him, I said,\n\nThis is what I want to change it to.\n\nAnd I showed him and he could see that it was more dynamic\n\nand more part of the character.\n\nAnd the last move of that sequence was [spits]\n\nthis decapitation, you know,\n\nand he literally smoking a cigar.\n\nHe said, what I've had to say, he's watched it, you know,\n\na couple of puffs and a cigar.\n\nAnd he calls out to his first assistant director,\n\nand he goes, Terry, how many heads have we got left?\n\n[giggles]\n\n[sword clanking]\n\n[air whooshes]\n\nBut working with Ridley,\n\nI always liken it to working\n\nwith some great Renaissance painter,\n\njust the way he sees the world\n\nand that level of artistry he converts onto the screen.\n\nI've ended up making five movies with Ridley,\n\nand every single one of those experiences\n\nhas gotta be in my top 10 of films that I've made.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nRobin Hood.\n\nActually, my first step on Robin Hood,\n\nwhen the idea came up was grab every Robin Hood book\n\nthat I could, big bag of them.\n\nAnd I got on a boat in Northern Queensland,\n\nand just started to read.\n\nSo I just wanted to know what the mythology was,\n\nas much of it I could find out and what it occurred to me,\n\nand what I brought up with Ridley was\n\nthat we all have a reshaped view of Robin Hood,\n\nwhich comes from Victorian times.\n\nBut in fact, this legend started\n\nmany, many hundreds of years before then.\n\nWe started looking at the facts\n\nof the currently understood myths\n\nand the realities of history timeline,\n\nand always in stories of Robin Hood in a modern era,\n\nKing Richard comes into the story.\n\nHe's been away on crusade and he comes into the story\n\nat the end of the story to sorta save the day, you know,\n\nconfirm that Robin is a good man.\n\nThe Sheriff of Nottingham was incorrect\n\nand blah, blah, blah.\n\nBut what we discovered is that, you know,\n\napart from a few months earlier in his life,\n\nKing Richard was French.\n\nHe didn't make it back to England.\n\nHe went on crusades and he died in France.\n\nThat was our first hook.\n\nIt's like, okay, everybody else is expecting\n\na Robin Hood where King Richard comes in\n\nat the end of save the day.\n\nOur Robin Hood begins with the death of King Richard,\n\nwho died putting a castle to siege in France.\n\nAnd of course I got to work\n\nwith the magnificent Cate Blanchett, or Love Blanchett,\n\nas I called her on that film\n\nand found out that, you know,\n\nnot only is she a wonderful actress,\n\nshe's spectacular company as well.\n\nI'm ashamed of you.\n\nHello, Marion. I've come to save ya.\n\nI remember standing on that set in the born wood,\n\nthe same place that we'd shot certain parts of Gladiator,\n\nand I'm looking up the hill at this French castle\n\nthat the art department have built on top of the hill.\n\nAnd I'm looking around me, hundreds of arches,\n\nand we have 180 horses galloping down the beach.\n\nThis is probably the last physical production of this scale\n\nthat I ever get to do.\n\nYou know, things were changing so rapidly,\n\nand it's proven to be that way.\n\nNow sure, I've been on big budget films,\n\nbut not in that kinda scale\n\nwhere everything's built, you know?\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nLook, the idea of this script was kind of nauseating\n\nwhen I first read it.\n\nI really didn't think I wanted to have anything\n\nto do with it, but then, you know,\n\nsomebody asked me actually,\n\nWhy are you not gonna do it?\n\nAnd it's like, 'cause it's really scary.\n\n[chuckles] And it scares me\n\nthat this is actually something that does happen.\n\nThis individual, this character is acting\n\non such a basis of a lack of humanity, a lack of empathy,\n\nand he is imploding and he's going to take her with him.\n\n[Woman] Ma'am, are you okay?\n\n[Brunette Lady] I'm pretty sure the guy\n\nin that truck's following me.\n\nHe's road ragin'.\n\n[eerie music]\n\n[Man] Why don't you just chill, man? Go your own way.\n\n[eerie music]\n\n[explosion]\n\n[screams] You know, one of the things\n\nthat was really important to me with this\n\nis that we don't at any stage try to justify his actions\n\nor his thought process because most of us\n\nwill go through this sort of thing and be, you know,\n\nit's just the ups and downs\n\nand the foibles and quirks of life.\n\nBut this particular man has decided\n\nthat all of this adds up to his right\n\nto destroy and terrorize.\n\nAnd we've seen that kind of personality at play.\n\nI mean, 20 years ago,\n\nI would have in my mind kind of written this off\n\nas some kind of anomaly, you know,\n\nbut that's the thing that kept playing on my mind,\n\nyou know, school shootings and shootings in nightclubs,\n\nbut it is the same thought process.\n\nAnd therefore it became more important to me.\n\nAnd it was particularly based on my conversations\n\nwith Derek and his perspective as a filmmaker,\n\nI knew that this movie ends up not being just about thrills\n\nand crashes and violence.\n\nThis movie ends up being a direct commentary\n\non the state of American society, Western society today.\n\nSo it went from being the thing I was most scared of\n\nto the thing I just felt most responsible to have to do.\n\nSo GQ and those of you that have tuned in\n\nthat's the end of that.\n\nI've been boring your tits off for quite some time now\n\ntalking about some of my iconic characters,\n\niconic being somebody else's definition.\n\nAnd I'm just the putz who has to say it.\n\nBut anyway, I hope you got something out of it.\n\nEnjoy yourself, and thank you, GQ."
