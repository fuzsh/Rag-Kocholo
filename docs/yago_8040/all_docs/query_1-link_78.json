        "text": "Russell Crowe and his wife Danielle Spencer have gone their separate ways after nine years of marriage, the Sydney Morning Herald reports, albeit without confirmation from either of the two parties.\n\nTongues had started wagging in June, when Spencer, a singer and former actress who met Crowe on the set of their 1990 film \"The Crossing,\" was photographed with Damian Whitewood, her dance partner from the most recent edition of the Australian version of \"Dancing With the Stars,\" at a Sydney casino. But Crowe, who has been out of country filming for most of the year, dispelled some of the talk by publicly greeting her with a kiss at the airport when he returned to the country.\n\nThe Sydney-based couple has two son together, Charles, 8, and Tennyson, 6. The famously angry actor is currently filming the antideluvian epic \"Noah\" in the U.S.\n\nFollow @VickiHy\n\n•\n\nAmy Poehler, Will Arnett kaput after nine years\n\n• Katie Holmes, Tom Cruise kaput; Oprah's couch devastated\n\n• Johnny Depp, Vanessa Paradis kaput\n\n• Peter Facinelli, Jennie Garth kaput after 15 years\n\n• Heidi Klum, Seal announce split after eight years, four children\n\n• Russell Brand to divorce Katy Perry"
