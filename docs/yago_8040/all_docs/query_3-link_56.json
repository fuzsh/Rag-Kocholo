        "text": "When a couple decides to divorce, there are, of course, a lot of items accumulated over time that need to be sorted through.\n\nRussell Crowe knows that first-hand: as he and his ex-wife Danielle Spencer are about to be officially divorced, the actor has decided to put a range of his possessions up for sale.\n\nIn an auction hosted by Sotheby's on April 7, Crowe will auction off over 200 of his personal items.\n\nThe sale is aptly titled \"The Art of Divorce,\" and is on the day of both Crowe's birthday and his wedding anniversary.\n\nHe apparently has a dark sense of humour about the whole ordeal, considering he donned a tuxedo and raised a toast in a photo from the print catalogue.\n\nThe list is full of obvious objects like artwork from Australian artists, movie memorabilia, luxury watches and guitars from his days in the band 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts.\n\nBut Crowe has also collected some bizarre and unconventional things over the years that you can purchase for a hefty load of cash.\n\nFrom dinosaur bones to duelling pistols, here are nine of the strangest items you can purchase from Crowe's divorce auction.\n\nA \"boxer protector\" seems to be a fancy term for a jock strap. This particular one was worn by Crowe himself in the 2005 film, supported by elastic and featuring a brown suede leather finish.\n\nEstimated price: $500-600\n\nThis violin used by his Master and Commander character Captain Jack Aubrey is the most expensive in \"The Art of Divorce\" collection. A musician friend hunted down the Italian-made violin from the 19th century. There's even a piece of silk Crowe put beneath his chin when he played the instrument in the movie.\n\nEstimated price: $110,000-$140,000\n\nCrowe has a letter of proof stating that this was in fact the back of Washington's chair during the filming of the 2007 film.\n\nEstimated price: $400-600\n\nA random monkey painting was in Crowe's possession which now you can own if you can pay the price.\n\nEstimated price: $30,000-$50,000\n\nIn case you have an occasion for wearing full chain mail, Crowe's costume from his role as Robin Longstride in the 2010 film is up for sale. A letter of its ownership states it was taken from the body of Robert of Loxley.\n\nEstimated: $15,000-$25,000\n\nOne of the less pricier items of Crowe's collection is his 1960s guitar inscribed by Les Paul. With a rosewood bridge and base, it features an inscription from Paul saying, \"To Russell, call me and I'll help you tune this mother.\" The guitar, however, isn't playable.\n\nEstimated price: $300-500\n\nCrowe purchased three Billboard charts from Sotheby's back in 2004 that were originally from Johnny Cash's home office until his death. On the charts, there are two Hot Country Singles with \"Folsom Prison Blues\" listed as the number one track.\n\nEstimated price: $2,000-$3,000\n\nIt's not surprising the actor would have duelling pistols, but it's curious how much he actually used them for duels. Each one has “a brass barrel, silver plate and steel fittings and horn mounted ebonised plunger, within a later fitted and velvet lined walnut case applied with foliate brass strap work, each pistol with an oval brass disc stamped ‘F. HOUSE.’”\n\nEstimated price: $5,000-$8,000\n\nThe most iconic of Crowe's items are dinosaur bones. The dinosaur skull - found in the Niobara Formation in Kansas - comes mounted in a case. But the best part about them? Crowe purchased them from Leonardo DiCaprio."
