        "text": "Russell Crowe may have angered half the world with his \"ageist\" comments about older actresses - but his latest confessions will melt your heart.\n\nIn an interview promoting his new film, The Water Diviner, a project which both he directed and starred, the former Gladiator gushed about his ex wife Danielle and their two sons Tennyson and Charles.\n\nThe Noah actor split from his wife in 2012 after nine years of marriage and they remain on good terms and have not divorced.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times, Russell shows a softer side as he laments his marriage breakdown. \"I've loved Danielle Spencer since 1989 - that's never going to change - and that's one of those things where I stare at her and go, 'How did this fail?' I still can't work it out, because my feelings for her have never changed.\"\n\nAsked if the pair could rekindle their romance, he adds: \"Once I commit to something, I stick with it, so you never know...\"\n\nThe actor recently sparked fury with his misogynistic opinions as he shrugs off the complaints from Hollywood actresses, including the likes of Joan Collins, who have found it a genuine struggle to land roles as they have got older.\n\nRussell was speaking with the Australian Women’s Weekly before Christmas when he points to the likes of Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren as examples of women who are still acting despite their older years.\n\nIn the interview, he claims that all actors as they get older can find work but they can’t expect to play young characters.\n\n“To be honest, I think you’ll find that the woman who is saying that [the roles have dried up] is the woman who at 40, 45, 48, still wants to play the ingenue, and can’t understand why she’s not being cast as the 21-year-old,” said Crowe.\n\n“Meryl Streep will give you 10,000 examples and arguments as to why that’s bullshit, so will Helen Mirren, or whoever it happens to be. If you are willing to live in your own skin, you can work as an actor. If you are trying to pretend that you’re still the young buck when you’re my age, it just doesn’t work.\"\n\nRussell, 50, also gave an example of an actress that he knew that asked for a role to change because of the number of children.\n\n“I have heard of an actress, part of her fee negotiation was getting the number of children she was supposed to have lessened. Can you believe this?” he said.\n\n“This (character) was a woman with four children, and there were reasons why she had to have four children – mainly, she lived in a cold climate and there was nothing to do but fornicate all day – so quit arguing, just play the role!”\n\nBlogger Rebecca Rose was left enraged by Russell’s recent interview, and argues on the feminist site Jezebel that the actor had failed to acknowledge how many Hollywood film show men many years older winning the heart of younger women.\n\n“Funny how Crowe doesn’t bother to offer any opinion about the mind-boggling legacy of Hollywood men playing romantic leads to women 10, 20, 30, and sometimes 40 (!!!!!) years younger than them,” she wrote.\n\n“Because it’s clearly the sad old women daring to pretend they are outside their actual birth ages that are ruining Hollywood … Thanks Crowe for reminding us, yet again, that women are always held in contempt for doing anything remotely similar to what their male counterparts do without reproach.”\n\nWhile another blogger Amy Gray writes that there aren’t enough roles for women in the first place.\n\n“The ‘ingenue’ roles Crowe refers to are the only ones readily available for women; on the flip side, the majority of male characters in film and TV are aged between their 30s (27%) and 40s (31%),” she wrote.\n\n“That could be because we’re more likely to want to watch lead characters based on their f***ability – and the older a woman gets, as any executive will tell you, the less f***able she becomes.”\n\nRussell, who is promoting his new movie The Water Diviner, insists that he’s accepted his age and that he won’t be the hot lead anymore and is happy with that.\n\n“The point is, you do have to be prepared to accept that there are stages in life. So I can’t be the Gladiator forever,” he said."
