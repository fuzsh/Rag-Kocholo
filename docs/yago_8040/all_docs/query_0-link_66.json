        "text": "With Russell Crowe’s fiery reputation, you’d need to be a pretty strong character to be his missus.\n\nHis singer-songwriter wife Danielle Spencer is certainly that – even if she is teeny tiny – but she insists she is not responsible for the Robin Hood star’s transformation into big, mellow pussycat.\n\nDanielle, 40, says: “I don’t think I’ve tamed Russell, I just think there’s a natural progression when you become a parent – you’re relaxed and happier.\n\n“There’s a pretty big shift in your focus when you have children. You can’t really be selfish any more, and I think that’s a good shift.\n\n“Having children is grounding and very humbling. But I’m the tough one with them, let me put it that way. He’s the softie.”\n\nRussell, father to sons Charlie, six, and three-year-old Tennyson, has been called a number of things over the years but “softie” is a new one. His volcanic temper has landed him in bother on several occasions – he once famously hurled a volley of foul-mouthed abuse at a television executive after his BAFTA acceptance speech was cut short – but his angry outbursts now seem a thing of the past.\n\nThe Crowe family live at their ranch in New South Wales, shunning the glitzy showbiz scene and rarely attending red carpet events. And when they do – such as this week’s Cannes film festival premiere of Russell’s latest epic Robin Hood – the whole family try to make the trip.\n\n“Generally we try to stick together so there’s usually a period of the year where we might be away for three to four months,” explains Danielle.\n\n“When we came over last summer for the filming of Robin Hood we put Charlie in a lovely school in Surrey. I worried about it being disruptive for him but he was fine. I’m not sure if the film’s going to be suitable for the children though!”\n\nRussell may be the better known of the couple, but Danielle’s been involved in the acting and music industry since she was a child. Her father is Playschool presenter Don Spencer, who also supported the likes of The Rolling Stones and The Hollies in his heyday. He started teaching Danielle the piano when she was four and she wrote her first song aged just 10.\n\nShe landed her first job in a Sydney theatre production when she was 17, then moved in to TV drama, starring in Home And Away, before making the shift back to music 10 years later.\n\nDanielle – who met Russell way back in 1990 – put her own singing career on hold to become a full-time mum after the couple got married in 2003.\n\n“I got married and then I fell pregnant immediately,” explains Danielle.\n\n“Before the wedding, I had just finished promoting and touring my first album and fully intended to start working on my second album straight away but the timing was dictated to me.\n\n“And because we were moving about so much I really wanted to create a stable environment. Then, as Charlie got to the point where I felt I could relax a bit and have a bit of space for myself, I fell pregnant again!\n\n“So I shelved the second album again until my second son was two, and that’s when I thought OK, I feel like I can go off and work without the big guilt.\n\n“It seemed inevitable that I’d fall pregnant again but it hasn’t happened yet, so I’m OK for the moment!”\n\nAlthough Danielle’s keen to increase their brood at some stage – ideally with a girl – she’s enjoying being able to concentrate on her music again and has decided to launch her songs in the UK for the first time. “I needed to take that time out to be around when the kids were babies,” she says. “But when my Tennyson turned two, it felt like I had got a bit of brain space.\n\n“It’s hard to get the peace and quiet but I’ve put a lock on my music room door so I can say, ‘Right I’ll see you in a few hours’ and shut myself away to sit at my piano.\n\n“It’s the only way that I can do it otherwise it’s just endless interruption. I’m always getting the little knocks on the door going, ‘Mum open the door!’\n\n“I’m probably a better mother doing something creative, you just have to be more structured with your time.”\n\nRussell, who had a much-publicised fling with Hollywood star Meg Ryan before he tied the knot with Danielle, is very supportive of his wife’s career. He’s even directed a couple of her videos, including her latest single Wish I’d Been Here, which is released here at the end of May. And because Russell also has his own rock band, 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts, they enjoy the odd jamming session at home.\n\n“We have a very musical household,” laughs Danielle. “It’s very noisy! My sons tell me to be quiet all the time when I’m singing.\n\n“It’s very demoralising but I can handle it. Russell and I don’t write together but we have lots of friends who are also musical. So we have our little jam sessions when we all congregate somewhere. The ranch is a great place to get friends together.”\n\nAlthough Danielle’s never felt compelled to make it in Hollywood, she doesn’t let Russell’s career overshadow her own. In fact she believes that being in the same industry is one of the reasons their relationship works.\n\n“In the back of my head I kept thinking, ‘Oh yeah I should go and try to get an agent in LA’,” says Danielle. “But I didn’t end up going.\n\n“Russell had a very clear ambition though – he knew where he was going and I had every confidence that he was going to get there.\n\n“We’re not competitive with each other. We just try to manage time so I can do my thing and he gets his time to do his.\n\n“There’s a definite understanding as far as our careers are concerned so that it makes things easier.\n\n“I think it would be hard being in the entertainment industry without someone who was, because it’s hard to explain the ins and outs of it all.”"
