        "text": "We're all used to reading about messy celeb breakups but Danielle Spencer and Russell Crowe have just proven once again that this doesn't have to be the standard practice.\n\nComing up to what would have been their 20th anniversary and the actor's 60th birthday, Daniella decided to pen a touching tribute to the Gladiator star.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nPosting a black and white throwback snap of Russell and their two sons as kids she wrote a sweet message about the man she spent 15 years married to.\n\nShe captioned the tender moment: 'Twenty years ago today, I married the father of my boys. While it is no longer our anniversary, it is still that guyâ€™s birthday. Happy Birthday @russellcrowe.'\n\nDriving home, that despite not being together anymore, they have a good relationship the actress even added in the #friends in case we didn't know what she was suggesting.\n\nHer followers were quick to praise her for making such a 'classy' post about her ex-husband. 'Love everything about this post,' wrote one while another commented: 'As all marriages that end should be.'\n\nDaniella and Russell got together after meeting on the set of the 1989 flick The Crossing and after a number of years together, said 'I do' in April 2003 at the actor's farm in Nana Glen, New South Wales.\n\nFor years they were somewhat of a Hollywood 'it' couple and when rumours started swirling in 2012 many fans were left heartbroken with the news.\n\nThough it took six years for the pair to solidify their divorce finally, Russell caused a bit of a stir when he hinted at a reunion, making headlines.\n\nSpeaking to The Sunday Times in 2015, the actor said: 'I've loved Danielle Spencer since 1989 - that's never going to change - and that's one of those things where I stare at her and go, 'How did this fail?' I still can't work it out, because my feelings for her have never changed.'\n\nHis feelings may not have changed but his ex-wife's certainly did as she later shut down any suggestion that the two might patch things up."
