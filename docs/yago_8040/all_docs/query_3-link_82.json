        "text": "Actor Russell Crowe will likely pay millions to wife Danielle Spencer once the pair's divorce is finalized, according to details in the couple's prenup.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald first reported Russell and Danielle's decision to part ways, and now they say Spencer is expected to walk with more than $25 million.\n\nThanks to Russell's blockbuster success and various business and real estate ventures since they wed in 2003, Danielle could be looking at an even larger settlement.\n\nIn addition, Spencer is expected to keep the couple's $10-million Rose Bay mansion in Sydney, while Crowe will continue living in the family's $14 million Woolloomooloo Wharf apartment nearby.\n\nDanielle was photographed outside Rose Bay mansion on Oct. 15. Credit: Splash\n\nCrowe is currently in the US filming the biblical epic \"Noah,\" while Spencer remains in Sydney with their two sons, Charles, 8, and Tennyson, 6.\n\nThe pair first met 22 years ago on the set of \"The Crossing\" and were married in April of 2003."
