Russell Crowe is rumoured to have broken up with Danielle Spencer, his wife of nine years.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian star and his musician partner have separated, owing to his busy work schedule. The pair, who met 22 years ago on the set of The Crossing, have two sons, eight-year-old Charles and six-year-old Tennyson.

The actor's rep has not commented on the reports, but it is thought that the split was amicable.

Danielle is apparently living with the couple's children in Sydney while Russell films Noah in New York.
