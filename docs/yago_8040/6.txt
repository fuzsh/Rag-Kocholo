Russell Crowe has split from his wife Danielle Spencer, according to reports.

The break-up between 48-year-old Crowe and Spencer, who he's been married to for nine years, is said to be "amicable", reports The Sydney Morning Herald.

Crowe and 43-year-old singer Spencer have two children together, 8-year-old Charles and 6-year-old Tennyson.

The pair met while filming the 1990 film The Crossing, and are both said to be "committed to protecting their boys" during this "tough time".

No reason has been cited for the reported split, but Crowe is said to be "throwing himself into work" following their break-up. He is currently filming Noah, a biblical film with Emma Watson.

People reports that earlier in the year, photographs emerged of Spencer with her arms around Damian Whitewood - her partner on Australia's Dancing with the Stars.

However, there has been no confirmation that this contributed to their separation.
