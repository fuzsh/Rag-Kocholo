Russell Crowe and his wife, Danielle Spencer, have separated after nine years of marriage, according a report in the Sydney Morning Herald.

The split is said to be amicable for the couple, who have two sons together, 8-year-old Charles and 6-year-old Tennyson. Crowe, 48, and Spencer, 43, met 22 years ago on the set of the film The Crossing. He proposed to Spencer, a musician, in 2002 and they quietly married at a chapel at Crowe's farm in Nana Glen, Australia in April 2003. The two have been based in Australia ever since, with their two children attending school in Sydney.
