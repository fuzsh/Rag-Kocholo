        "text": "FIRST OHIO CAVALRY.\n\nAbout fifty men were recruited in Union County for the First Ohio Cavalry, and this detachment was assigned about equally to Companies D and K. They enlisted during the month of August, 1861, under the first call for three years' troops.\n\nCompany K was organized at Plain City, the men having been recruited in Union, Madison and Franklin Counties. They left Plain City for Camp Chase on the 8th day of September, 1861, going across the country in carriages and wagons. A few days later the election of officers was held, and T. W. Forshee, of Madison County, was elected Captain; James Cutler, of Union, First Lieutenant; and A. H. McCurdy, Second Lieutenant; and W. L. Curry was appointed Orderly Sergeant.\n\nThere were no commissioned officers in Company D from this county, but several of the bravest and best non-commissioned officers in the regiment were Union County boys in this company, among whom were Sergeants John Newlove, Alvin Thompson, Leroy Scott and Thomas Amrine; and John Barbour, who was appointed Quartermaster Sergeant of the regiment. The officers of Company D were from Licking County. Two Captains of this company were killed in battle - Capt. D. A. B. Moore, who had been promoted to Major, and Capt. W. H. Scott - and Lieut. Ira Stevens died of disease.\n\nPage 92 -\n\nOf Company K, Capt. Forshee and Lieut. McCurdy both resigned in June, 1862, when the command of the company devolved upon Lieut. James Cutler.\n\nTo record the service of the First Ohio Cavalry is to write the history of every battle of the Army of the Cumberland, from Mill Springs, 1862, to Nashville, 1864. This regiment was organized during the summer of 1861, and was mustered in at Camp Chase on the 5th day of October, 1861. Whitelaw Reid says in his history, \"Ohio in the War:\" \"It may well be doubted whether more applicants were ever rejected from a similar organization in the service or if a nobler band of men in physical development could possibly have been selected from the yeomanry of Ohio.\"\n\nStrict military discipline was inaugurated by Col. Ransom - who was a regular army officer - in drill, reports, and everything that pertained to the regular service of camp duty. On the 9th day of December, 1861, the regiment broke camp, marched through the capital and embarked on their first campaign, from whence many comrades were destined never again to return. Arrived at Cincinnati at daybreak the next morning, took boats and reached Louisville, Ky., on the morning of the 11th, the first regiment of cavalry to enter that department save Wolford's Kentucky regiment; and again quoting from Reid's history: \"The First Ohio was the nucleus of that lost of cavalry which, under the leadership of Stanley, Crooks, Mitchell, McCook, Kilpatrick, Long, Minty, Millikin and Wilson achieved such triumphs for the country and fame for themselves.\"\n\nThe history of the cavalry of the Southwest - \"its fearless rides, its daring raids, its bloody charges, its long nights of weary marching, as it carried desolation and destruction into the very heart of treason\" - is a record of heroic achievements unsurpassed in the annals of that service.\n\nThe regiment remained at Camp Buell, Louisville, drilling, until the 16th of January, 1862, when orders were received to join Gen. Thomas, at Mill Springs. Never will the soldiers of the First Ohio forget that four days' march to Lebanon, through such rain as can only pour down in Kentucky and Tennessee, or Camp Frankenberger, where saddles and equipments were washed off by the mountain torrents on that memorable night, January 18. On the 19th Lebanon was reached and the regiment halted and resumed the regular routine of camp duty. While in this camp, the First Ohio encountered the enemy for the first time and made its first dash after John Morgan.\n\nOn the 14th of February, 1862, the regiment marched from Bardstown to Louisville, and on the 28th embarked for Nashville, where it arrived on the 6th of March. On the 14th, it led the advance of Gen. Buell's army to Pittsburg Landing, by making a dash in the night to save the bridge was burned by the fleeing rebels, and swimming their horses across the river, the cavalry took possession of the beautiful little city, which it held until the army arrived, laid pontoons, crossed the river, and made that ever-memorable march through rain and mud to Pittsburg Landing, leaving the wagon train and camping for weeks on the battle-field, without tents, raining constantly, and drinking the water from ravines draining from dead horses and men. Here the regiment saw its first real service in front of the rebel army, as the cavalry stood picket in advance of the infantry, and was constantly on duty in the advance on Corinth, skirmishing with the enemy almost daily. After the evacuation of Corinth and the pursuit of Bragg's army, the First Ohio went into camp, Company D having lost in a skirmish at Blackland R. W. Irwin and James Anderson, wounded. Col. Smith left the regiment on the 10th of June, and on the 17th Col. Milliken took command.\n\nThe regiment then moved east to Tuscumbia, and was scattered along the Memphis & Charleston Railroad guarding bridges. Companies E and K were stationed at Courtland, Ala., and on the 23d of July B. F. Lucas, of Company K, was killed near that place.\n\nOn the 25th, this detachment, with two companies of Kentucky infantry, was attacked by a brigade of confederate cavalry, under Gen. Armstrong, and after a sharp fight the two companies of infantry and about ten men of Company K - Lieut. Cutler, W. L. Curry, A. S. Chears, Lewis Latham, John Patterson, A. L. Sessler, John Johnson, William Johnson, J. F. Winters and S. P. Clark - were taken prisoners. The company was then commanded by Sergt. John Lucas until October 1862, when Lieut. Cutler, having been exchanged, returned to the regiment, was promoted Captain, and commanded the company until he resigned, in March, 1863, when Sergt. Curry, who had been exchanged in February, 1863, and promoted to First Lieutenant, took command of the company. The First Ohio had its full share of hard service on the counter-march of Buell's army back to Louisville, Company D losing Marion Lansdown wounded in a skirmish at Bardstown, Ky., October, 1862, then participated in the battle of Perryville, in which A. W. Lock and J. M. Shultz, of Company K, were wounded.\n\nIt was actively engaged in the advance on Murfreesboro, losing heavily at Stone River. The list of killed included Col. Millikin, Maj. Moore, and Lieut. Conditt; also Wesley Poling, of Company D, and Adjt. Scott, wounded, with a long list of heroes unnamed, but of undying fame. \"The regiment fell back from its field of glory, where it had made one of the most heroic charges of the war, with saddened hearts, for weltering in his life's blood on the field of carnage, lay its young and gallant commander. He was mourned by his comrads as the brave mourn for the brave.\"\n\nOn the 24th of June, 1863, the regiment moved on the extreme left of the army, and shared in some hard fighting around Tullahoma and Elk River. In August, Lieut. Curry was\n\nPage 93 -\n\ntransferred to the command of Company M, which he commanded through the Chickamauga campaign. In the advance of Chattanooga, the First Ohio, under command of Lieut. Col. Cupp, crossed the Tennessee River September 2, and was conspicuous in the expedition under Gen. Stanley in the attempt to cut the railroad south of Chattanooga. after a severe encounter with a large force of the enemy near La Fayette, Ga., it passed up the Chattanooga valley, reached the battle-field of Chickamauga early on the morning of September 20, and lost heavily in the engagement of that day. Col. Cupp was killed while forming the regiment for a charge. His death was a severe blow to the regiment, as he was universally beloved. Of the 900 men composing the Second Brigade, 134 were killed and wounded. Company K lost in this engagement Abe Orr, killed, and Sergt. J. W. Chapin, J. F. Young, William Hiser and C. S. Irwin, wounded and Lieut. Curry and C. Ziebold had horses shot under them. After falling back to Chattanooga, the troops were allowed no rest, but on the 26th of September started on the famous raid, driving Wheeler's cavalry from Washington, Tenn., to Muscle Shoals, Ala., taking more than 1,000 prisoners and several pieces of artillery.\n\nIn an engagement at Washington, Tenn., with Gen. Wheeler's cavalry, October, 1863, John Newlove, of Company D, was taken prisoner, and of Company K, Sergt. C. Byers, E. Garner and P. E. Goff were wounded, and James Henry, Sergt. E. Young, James Stanton, David Nedrow and Fred Wedo were taken prisoners. P. E. Goff, E. Garner and Fred Wedo died in Andersonville Prison. The regiment then returned to Chattanooga and took part in the assault upon Mission Ridge, where William Johnson, of Company K, was killed, and Thomas Amrine, of Company D, was wounded. After the battle of Mission Ridge, the irst moved to the relief of Burnsides, at Knoxville, being the first regiment to reach that city, having several skirmishes on the way, and capturing many prisoners.\n\nOn the 16th of December a detachment of the regiment made a brilliant charge at Calhoun upon a rebel brigade commanded by Gen. Wheeler, with a lost of one killed and three wounded, and capturing 130 prisoners.\n\nIn November, 1863, Lieut. Curry again took command of Company K, re-enlisted with the regiment in January, 1864, and after the fall of Atlanta was appointed Captain on the 14th of December, 1864, but the company was so much reduced in numbers he could not be mustered as Captain.\n\nAfter the veteran furlough the regiment was re-organized at Nashville, and on the 22d of May, 1864, started to join the advancing column of Sherman's army near Rome, Ga., encountering the enemy near Decatur, Ala., on the 26th, and in the skirmish which followed, Corp. Samuel Darrah, of Company K, captured the flag of the Seventh Alabama Cavalry. Darrah was a brave and gallant soldier. After the war, he emigrated to Missouri, where he died a few years ago. On the 27th, the First Ohio took part in the engagement at Courtland, losing on this occasion five men wounded, and on teh 29th participated in a severe skirmish at Moulton, with a loss of twenty killed and wounded. Of Company K. H. George was killed and L. Cooper wounded.\n\nThe regiment was in the memorable \"one hundred days under fire\" from Chattanooga to Atlanta, losing severely. Of Company D, Daniel Shobbell was killed near Atlanta. The losses of Company K in this campaign were Thomas Armstrong, Jeremiah Griffith and George Pearl, killed, and William Hiser, J. W. Robins and J. M. Shultz wounded.\n\nWhen Hood attempted to cut Sherman's communication between Atlanta and Chattanooga, the First Cavalry followed in pursuit and was engaged in several sharp fights, and when Sherman commenced preparations for his march to the sea, it joined the forces under Gen. Thomas, and after the victory at Nashville, rendezvoused at Gravelly Springs until March, 1865. On the 1st of April the regiment with Gen. Alexander's division gained a brilliant victory over Forrest's cavalry at Ebenezer's Church, Company K losing Sergt. E. P. Allen killed and John M. Shultz, wounded. On the 2d of April, Selma, Ala., was taken after a hard struggle.\n\nThe last fight of the First Ohio Cavalry was at Columbus, Ga., which was captured by a bold saber charge, Company K losing William Griffith, wounded, on this occasion.\n\nA detachment of the First Cavalry under command of Capt. J. O. Yeoman, was with the command that captured the President of the Confederacy, among whom was John Newlove, of Company D, and J. F. Young, of Company K, both of Union County. Of the $100,000 reward paid for the capture of \"Jeff Davis,\" Capt. Yeoman received $3,000 and Newlove and Young, $402 each.\n\nThe regiment garrisoned Georgia and South Carolina from April until September, then returned to Ohio and was mustered out at Camp Chase on the 28th of September, 1865, after four years; hard service, Company D having lost ten men on the field and in the hospitals, and twenty-eight taken prisoner, making a total loss of thirt-eight, and Company K having lost nine killed, twelve died in hospitals, twelve wounded and ten taken prisoner, making a total loss of forty-three.\n\nDuring its term of service, Company D lost by death James NEwman, Lieut. Ira Stevens and Harry Hildreth, and of Company K. Martin Brant, William Newland, David Anderson, E. Garner, Fred Wedo, Francis Jones, J. S. Ewing and H. D. Warner, died.\n\nThe First Ohio Cavalry carried on its muster-roll nearly 1800 names and mustered out at Camp Chase 701 men. It has a long roll of gallant heroes who were klled on the field of\n\nPage 94 -\n\nbattle, many wasted and died of diseases in the hospitals and prison pens of the South. Of those mustered out of service eighteen years ago, many are sleeping their last sleep in honored graves. Col. T. J. Patton was killed in a railroad collision on the Louisville & Memphis Railroad. Maj. J. W. Scott, Maj. J. C. Frankenberger, Lieut. A. Overlly, Lieut. T. Scott, Capt. L. Pickering and Sergeon John Cannan are all dead. Thus one by one they are being mustered out of life's service. This regiment has written in characters of blood upon its battle-flag, Corinth, Perryville, Stone River, Chickamauga, Mission Ridge, Kenesaw, Atlanta, Jonesboro, Lovejoy and skirmishes numbered by the score. True it was no braver nor better than other regiments. Its roll of honored dead was no larger than many others, but it never failed to respond to any call that was made upon it. The unnumbered and unlettered graves of the Fiist Ohio are scattered over every battle-field of the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nCOMPANY A.\n\nCorp. S. J. Robertson, e. Mar. 31, 1863, disc.

It has about 1,000 miles of country to picket and was engaged in almost innumerable skirmishes. The ground of its operations was in the center of the Rocky Mountains, and embraced portions of Nebraska, Dakota, Colorado, Utah, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. The first Battalion was mustered out Apr. 1, 1865 and the remaining companies not until July, 1866.\n\nCOMPANY C\n\nCorp. Anson Baughman, e. Dec. 12, 1861, disc. Apr. 1, 1865.\n\nBenedict, W. H., e.

So zealous were the officers instructed with this care, and so filled with patriotic impulses were the true men that responded to the call that on the 24th day of November, 1863, the regiment was organized complete and ready for whatever duty awaited it. The men furnished from Union County were assigned to Company C.\n\nWhile the organization was yet incomplete, six companies were called to Johnson's Island to guard prisoners and meet, if need be, the threatened invasion of rebels from Canada, intent on releasing the 3,000 imprisoned rebel officers there. The companies thus employed were A, C. D, F, I and L. The other companies were quartered at Camp Chase until February, 1864, when the whole regiment was brought together at Camp Dennison. Here it was mounted, armed and vigorously drilled until the 27th day of March, when it started to the front and entered upon its memorable career.\n\nIts first duty was to assist Gen. Burbridge in breaking up the armed bands of guerrillas and bashwhackers in Kentucky. Scattering itself over that State, it soon became a terror to marauders and rebel sympathizers, dispersed the guerrillas and restored order.\n\nThis task accomplished with commendable promptness, the Twelfth joined in an expedition against Saltville, Va. But after a toilsome journey of several days, it was halted and turned about to make one of the most rapid marches known to warfare, traveling over 180 miles in fifty hours. It struck the rebel forces at Mt. Sterling, Ky., on the 9th of June, 1864, and gallantly led the charge. In this battle the regiment fought many times its number, but never for a moment wavered. At one time sixty men of the Third Battalion,\n\nPage 97 -\n\nmostly from Company C, fought a rebel regiment for thirty minutes, losing many precious lives, but holding its ground till help came. Of this devoted little band, Union County furnished Joseph Smith, Hylas S. Moore and J. L. Cameron, others now living here Edward Routs, Frederick Keller, Uriah Jolley and John Van Pearse, of Company M.\n\nFor its gallantry the Twelth was complimented at teh close of the fight by Gen. Burbridge, who remarked that it had saved the day for him. These laurels were dearly bought for the loss of the regiment all told was 197 men. Of these were Maj. Moderwell shot through the abdomen, (afterward recovered); Capt. Hunter, through shoulder; Orderly Sergt. Alfred Wetterige and Corp. Conner, killed, and many other of Company C wounded, among whom were J. O. Sweet, Peter Black, William Blue, Jefery Williams and Bently Williams.\n\nThe battle lasted all day, and at night the regiment remained on the battle-field. Company C, chosen for special guard duty, got no rest. Three days and nights' marching and fighting was now to be followed by a gallop of thirty-three miles to Lexington on the 10th; fresh horses drawn and on to Paris, Ky., on the 11th. Awaiting here for supplies and ammunition until evening, the regiment again mounted and forward for a nights' march to Cynthiana. Early on the morning of the 12th of June, while darkness was yet so dense that the lurid jets of powder flame blazed from the carbines, the regiment was leading the charge again in battle, sustaining itself heroically, and gaining a complete victory in this engagement. On the 14th of June the regiment received the thanks and congratulations of President Lincoln and the Secretary of War, and was again complimented for its gallantry by the commanding General.\n\nAgain braking into detachments, the Twelfth scattered over Kentucky, dispersing marauders and keeping order, until the month of September, when it concentrated at Mount Sterling and again started with Gen. Burbridge's expedition to Saltville, Va.\n\nThe expedition led over 300 miles without provision, trains, tents or ambulances, was cause of much privation,and on the 2d of October was again at its accustomed place leading the advance into one of the most hotly contested battles of the war.\n\nThe rebel fortifications were in the deep mountain gorges and rendered operations by mounted men impossible, yet, dismounted, the Twelfth made again and again its famous carbine charges and reaching well up to the enemies' works. All day long the battle raged in the mountain fastness, but toward the close of the day ammunition was exhausted and the rebel forces re-enforced by 5,000 of Gen. Early's fresh troops, and Gen. Burbridge was compelled to abandon the expedition. Company C had all day been doing duty on the body guard of Gen. McLane and its couriers dashed here and there through the battle carrying orders. A rapid retreat began, and as it still had ammunition Company C was detailed a special guard for the rear, and many times during that disastrous night and the following day did this devoted little band halt in the mountain passes and hold the pursuing foe in check while the retreating column hurried on.\n\nForty-nine men of the Twelfth lay dead or wounded on the field of battle this eventful day.\n\nReturning to Lexington the regiment re-organized, drew fresh horses and supplies, and on the 10th of November was again in the saddle marching toward Cumberland Gap.\n\nReaching that point on the 26th, scattering again, it was engaged a short time destroying bands of marauders around Bean Station and Rodgersville. Gen. Stoneman now took command, and being joined with Gen. Gillem the whole force, including the Twelfth, was in the earlier part of December marching in a third expedition against Saltville. On the morning of December 15, Kingsford was reached a strong rebel force appeared on the opposite banks of the river. Halting his column, Gen. Stoneman sent Gillem to cross above and prepare for battle. The impatience of the Twelfth knew no bounds when in sight of the gray uniforms and eagerly they awaited the bugle sound to charge. That coming, with a wild yell they galloped up to the horses; joints in water to the opposite bank; opening a fire from carbines, and revolvers at short ranges the enemy was for a moment confused and Gen. Gillem then coming up aided to complete the rout.\n\nPursuit was given, and many of the enemy lay dead along the road, as the Twelfth poured into their fleeing ranks volley after volley from their carbines. Hurrying forward, Bristol was reached just before day. The Yankees dashed in, and in less than half an hour Bristol, with all its immense stores, was ours. Halting to complete the destruction of the rebel supplies and tearing up the railroad, the column again pushed forward to Abington. At Abington, Company F, of the Twelfth, a special escort of Gen. Burbridge, led the charge, and the regiment following, that place was taken, with a large number of prisoners and immense military supplies.\n\nSergt. Sherburn of Company F, and Lieut. Holt were both wounded, the former fatally. Several others of the regiment were wounded.\n\nPushing on, the column struck the army of the rebel Gen. Vaughn which soon broke in confusion, and the boys of the regiment joined in a headlong chase of five miles, with drawn sabers. Many pieces of artillery were here taken.\n\nWithout halting, the troops pushed on, and on the 12th the regiment had the grim satisfaction of leading the charge into Saltville, capturing the place where so many prisoners were lost a few months previous. Every vestige of the place was destroyed. Returning, Wytheville was cap-\n\nPage 98 -\n\ntured, and many skirmishes were had in the surrounding country. At the close of the day on the 17th, a desperate battle was fought with the troops of Breckenridge and Vaughn, near Marion. Here the brave Orderly Sergeant, John Van Pearse, of Company M, was seriously wounded while aiding to form the line.\n\nMaj. Moderwell, the favorite of the regiment, was again among the wounded. Returning from this raid, the regiment collected at Lexington to draw fresh horses and close up the broken ranks. Scattering again, it was a short time doing general patrol duty and looking after rebel sympathizers and bushrangers in Kentucky; coming together again the last of February, at Louisville, Ky., the whole joined Stoneman's command and embarked for Nashville by river. On through to Murfreesboro, and thence to Knoxville, where a veteran brigade was formed by uniting the Twelfth Ohio, Fifteenth Pennsylvania and Tenth Michigan Cavalries. On the 20th of March, this brigade was in motion marching out to Strawberry Plains, thence on through Bull's Gap, Jonesboro to Yadkin River. The stream was badly swollen, and several comrades drowned. Uriah Jolly was rescued here by Comrade Cameron.\n\nPausing a short time to close up the ranks, the forces swept on galloping through Jacksonville, on to the line of the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad at Christiansbury. This road was torn up and destroyed for many miles. Sweeping down into North Carolina, the Danville & Richmond Railroad was struck and destroyed for a great distance.\n\nHastening on, the troops brought up before Salisbury, a rebel force under Pemberton with several pieces of artillery came out to defend the town Scarcely halting, the twelfth led on the charge, and in spite of all opposition, Salisbury was soon in flames, many Union prisoners were released, and immense quantities of military stores consigned to the flames. On the 17th of April, the regiment marched on to Lincolnton, which place was captured by a charge led by Company C, of the Twelfth, under Lieut. Stewart; 200 picked men, under Maj. Moderwell were now chosen to march eighty miles to the Catawba River crossing and destroy the bridge of the Charlotte & South Carolina Railroad. On the morning of the 30th, they came across the forces of Vaughn and Duke. Sweeping down upon them, cut their way through, captured thirty-five prisoners, a large quantity of small arms and two pieces of cannon and some seven officers and 223 men; patroling the prisoners on the spot, the command returned to the regiment at Dallas, Company C having some wounded, but not fatally. On the 23d, the regiment started for Knoxville; but learning that President Lincoln had been assassinated, they joined in a head-long chase after Davis. Finally returning to Sweet Water, Tenn., thence on to McMinnville, thence to Nashville, on the 24th of November, the regiment was discharged. Of 1, 462 men, only 628 remained.\n\nThus melted away and passed into history the brave and patriotic Twelfth Ohio Cavalry.\n\nCOMPANY C.\n\nCorp. William Bushing, e. Sept. 26, 1863, disc.

It immediately joined the Army of the Potomac, and, acting as infantry, participated in the battles of White House Landing and Charles City, in the siege of Petersburg and in the engagements of Weldon Railroad, Ream's Station, Poplar Grove Church, Pegram's Farm and Boydtown Plank-road.

The Governor had previously visited Washington, and while there noticed the unguarded situation of the capitol, the President's house and the person of President Lincoln, and knowing the desperate character of the Cabinet at Richmond, he came home somewhat apprehensive for the safety of the public offices, and more especially for the life of the President. He at once commenced raising the Union Light Guard, by recruiting one man in each county of the State. By Dec. 22, 1863, the company was completed, and on the morning of that day it started for Washington City.\n\n\"Reaching the capital, its commanding officer reported to the Secretary of War, and was assigned to duty in and around the city, a strong detail being placed near the President's house, the Treasury building, War office, and other public buildings.\n\n\"In this description of duty the Union Light Guard served through 1863-64-65, and part of 1866, when it was sent home to Ohio, paid, and mustered out of the service. Its original strength was 103 men."
