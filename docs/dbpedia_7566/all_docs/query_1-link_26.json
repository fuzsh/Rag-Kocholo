        "text": "Flag of the State of Ohio, printed on oilcloth-like cotton, affixed to its original wooden staff. Made for Civil War veteran's use, the flag bears a stamped overprint in the striped field that consists of an open wreath of laurel branches, inside which is the following text: “GAR [Grand Army of the Republic] Post, Dan Hall, Columbus, OH”.\n\nBorn on October 20th, 1842, Daniel M. Hall enlisted with the Union Army as a Private at the age of 18 on August 25th, 1861. On October 8th of that year he mustered into the Co. H of the 2nd Ohio Cavalry. Discharged for disability on June 28th, 1862, he reenlisted approximately 17 months later, on November 11th, 1863, and mustered into Co. F of the 12th Ohio Cavalry at Camp Cleveland. He was at some point promoted to the rank of Sergeant, and, on February 21st, 1864, to the rank of Corporal. He mustered out at Nashville on November 14th, 1865.\n\nHall mustered into the Hamlin Post of the Ohio G.A.R. on May 23rd, 1883. He would go on to serve not only as Commander of the Dept. of Ohio for the organization, but as National Commander of the entire Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nThe Grand Army of the Republic was the primary veterans association for Union Civil War soldiers. Founded in 1866, its members dressed up in Civil War uniforms, attended parades and reunions, and the organization was somewhat more fraternal in nature than today’s VFW or American Foreign Legion.\n\nFlags overprinted for the purpose of advertising are a specialized form in American flag collecting. A flag with a basic G.A.R. overprint is the most common type. This might be accompanied by a post number and a date. More elaborate the overprints are more highly desired, such as this one, which is the only variation I know of that honors a particular person who was not the namesake of the chapter itself.\n\nIt is of interest to note that a sister variety of 48 star parade flag is known, printed on the same fabric, that bears the same overprint, accompanied by the words: “We Mourn Our Comrade.\" From the additional text on the 48 star variety, one can extrapolate that the flags were made to mourn the passing of this important leader of Civil War veterans on October 19th, 1925, just one day before his 83rd birthday.\n\nThe State Flag of Ohio was designed in 1901 by Cleveland architect John Eisenmann, who designed the Ohio building for the state's exhibition at the Pan American Exposition World's Fair in Buffalo, New York. It was officially adopted by the Ohio legislature on May 19th, 1902. It's elements are centered on a red disc, set against a circular white ground that forms a letter \"O.\" This simultaneously represents a buckeye, the fruit of the state tree and an iconic Ohio symbol. The flag's 5 stripes are said to represent the state's waterways and roads, while the triangular shape of the union is said to illustrate hills and valleys. The presentation of 13 stars along the hoist end, arranged in a semi-circular medallion with two off-set stars above and below, reflects the original 13 colonies. The diamond of stars, towards the fly end. bring the overall count to 17 to reflect Ohio's admission. When the design was adopted by the state legislature, the position of these stars was changed slightly, moving them further around the circle to form a wreath.\n\nFlag expert Whitney Smith, who coined the term Vexillology in the late 1950's (the accepted term for the study of flags), pointed out that the format of the flag itself was reminiscent of Civil War cavalry guidons, carried by Ohio regiments throughout the state. These were of swallowtail form, though with 13 stripes, all horizontal and 90 degrees to the hoist. Most often these had circular star patterns around an open center, which makes them even more similar to the Ohio flag. Although these were carried everywhere throughout the North, the flags are certainly similar. The Ohio flag, however, is in the shape of a ship's burgee rather than that of a U.S. Cavalry guidon. This is especially appropriate due to the importance of the Ohio River, as well as Lake Erie. For thousands upon thousands of American settlers, the Ohio River, largest of the Mississippi's tributaries, was the gateway to the American West. Its own tributaries provided transport throughout the state itself, while Lake Erie opened passage to Michigan and beyond. All were the lifeblood of industry and trade.\n\nBrief History of the 2nd Ohio Cavalry and the 12th Ohio Cavalry during Daniel M. Hall's tenure with the units:\n\n2nd Ohio Cavalry:\n\nSecond Cavalry. - Cols., Charles Doubleday, August V. Kautz, Bayard Nettleton, Dudley Seward; Lieut.-Cols., Robert W. Ratliff, George A. Purington, David E. Welch; Majs., Henry F. Willson, George G. Miner, Henry L. Burnett, Albert Barnitz, Hyman N. Easton, Rynd E. Lawder.\n\nThe 2nd cavalry was recruited and organized under the supervision of Hon. B. F. Wade and Hon. John Hutchins, in the summer and fall of 1861, to serve for three years, and rendezvoused at Camp Wade. Early in Jan., 1862, under orders from the war department, the regiment proceeded by rail via Cincinnati, St. Louis and St. Joseph to Platte City, Mo. In February a scouting party of 120 men of the regiment was attacked in the streets of Independence by an equal force under the command of the subsequently noted Quan- trill, but as the results of the regiment's \"first fight,\" Quantrill was routed in 15 minutes, losing 5 killed, 4 wounded and 5 captured, the Ohioans losing 1 killed and 3 wounded. (Source: The Union Army: A History of Military Affairs in the Loyal States, 1861-65…, Vol. 2).\n\nAt this point, Hall was discharged for disability.\n\n12th Ohio Cavalry:\n\nCol., Robert W. Ratliff; ; Lieut.-Cols., Robert H. Bentley, John F. Herrick; Majs., Miles J. Collier, Erastus C. Moderwell.\n\nThis regiment, from the state at large, was organized at Camp Cleveland from Aug. 7 to Nov. 24, 1863, to serve for a term of three years. On Nov. 29 it moved to Louisville, then to Lexington and Mt. Sterling, and at the latter place was closely engaged with the Confederates in the following June, behaving with great gallantry and being especially complimented by Gen. Burbridge. It overtook Morgan [Morgan's Raiders] at Cynthiana and fought with him, scattering his forces in every direction. In October it was engaged for half a day in hard fighting at Saltville, finally charging up a hill and driving the enemy from his works. It did its full share of duty under Gen. Stoneman, at Bristol, Abingdon and Marion; thence as support to Gen. Gillem in his pursuit of Vaughn; then back again to Marion, where Stoneman engaged Breckenridge for 40 hours, and finally defeated him. In December Saltville was captured and the forces returned to Kentucky, regimental headquarters being established at Richmond. In the spring of 1865 it again formed part of a raiding expedition under Gen. Stoneman, during which Salisbury, with its stores and the Federal prisoners con-fined there, fell into Union hands. The regiment was mustered out on Nov. 14, 1865, at Nashville, Tenn., in accordance with orders from the war department. (Source: The Union Army: A History of Military Affairs in the Loyal States, 1861-65…, Vol. 2)\n\nMounting: The flag was mounted and framed within our own conservation department, which is led by expert staff. We take great care in the mounting and presentation of flags and have preserved thousands of examples.\n\nThe black molding has a scooped profile, with red undertones and highlights. To this a rippled profile molding, black with gold highlights, was added as a liner. The background is 100% cotton twill, black in color. Spacers keep the textile away from the glass, which is U.V. protective.\n\nCondition: Excellent."
