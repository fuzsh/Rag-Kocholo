        "text": "Dear Mr. Fort,\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nWe searched the National Archives Catalog and located Muster Rolls of Volunteer Organizations During the Civil War, Mexican War, Creek War, Cherokee Removal, and Other Wars, 1836 - 1866 in the Records of the Adjutant General's Office (Record Group 94). This series contains muster rolls, returns, and regimental papers for Volunteer organizations participating in the Civil War and may include records for the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. We also located Regimental and Company Books of Civil War Volunteer Union Organizations, 1861 - 1867 in Record Group 94 that includes Regimental and Company Books of the 11th Ohio Cavalry Regiment. The books contain regimental and company descriptive books as well as other records. Regimental descriptive books typically contain rosters of commissioned and noncommissioned officers by rank; lists providing the name, rank, date of promotions, transfers, resignations, or death of officers; descriptive lists of enlisted men and noncommissioned officers, giving for each the soldiers' name, age, height, color of complexion, eyes, and hair; place of birth; occupation; where, when, and by whom enlisted; and remarks recording promotions, discharges, and deaths. Company descriptive books typically contain lists of commissioned and noncommissioned officers, enlisted men, and men transferred or discharged; registers of death citing date, place, and cause of death; lists of deserters; and descriptive rolls with personal data about each soldier. In addition, we located 14 series in the Records of U.S. Army Continental Commands (Record Group 393) that relate to Fort Laramie during the 1860s. These records have not been digitized and are not available online. For more information about these records, please contact the National Archives at Washington, DC - Textual Reference (RDT1) at archives1reference@nara.gov.\n\nYou may experience a delay in receiving an initial acknowledgment as well as a substantive response to your reference request from RDT1. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience as we balance mission-critical work and the safety of our staff during the pandemic. Please check NARAâ€™s web page about COVID-19 updates for the latest information.\n\nFor volunteer units raised by Ohio, there may be additional information in the custody of the Ohio Historical Society Archives & Library Finally, many histories have been published about various Civil War units, ranging from books written soon after the war by veterans of the units to works by recent authors. We suggest searching libraries (to include the Library of Congress and the State Library of Ohio), retailers, and online sites such as Google Books, the Internet Archive, and HathiTrust.\n\nWe hope this is helpful. Best of luck with your research!"
