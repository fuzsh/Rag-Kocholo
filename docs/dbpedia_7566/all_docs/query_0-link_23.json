It’s said he learned his love of art and books from his mother, Catherine Collins, and of hunting and fishing from his father, William Collins, a lawyer, Ohio senator and commander of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry.\n\nChildhood friends remembered Caspar as a red-headed, freckle-faced boy who knew the best fishing holes. They also mentioned his wit, friendliness and that he was a bit of a tease.\n\n“He was quite charming and outgoing. … He’d be a guy you’d like to know even today,” historian and Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum curator Douglas Cubbison said. “He was only 20 and an accomplished draftsman, a skilled artist and an intelligent and acute observer.”\n\nCaspar entered the army as a second lieutenant of the 11th Ohio the summer of 1863.\n\nSource: Caspar Collins: The man, the myth, the misspelling. By Elysia Conner for the Casper Journal. http://casperjournal.com/community/article_0735cb8e-86cf-56e2-aa54-7048bdb5251a.html\n\nExcerpt from Battle of Platte Bridge, Wikipedia: After reveille (July 26, 1865), all four of Anderson's (station commander, Major Martin Anderson of the 11th Kansas Cavalry) officers (with the 11th Kansas Cavalry) declined to lead the relief force and some placed themselves on the sick list to avoid the duty. 20-year-old 2nd Lt. Caspar W. Collins of Company G 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, en route back to his company farther west from a remount detail at Fort Laramie, had arrived the afternoon before with the mail ambulance and was ordered by Anderson to lead the relief. Bretney (commanding officer of Caspar Collins' 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry) had no authority to countermand the order but advised Collins to refuse it. Instead Collins borrowed Bretney's pistols and was given a mount from the regimental band.\n\nAt dawn numerous Indians were observed by sentinels on the surrounding hills observing the station. At 7:00 a.m. a larger force forded the river east of the station and rode just out of rifle range, taunting the garrison. Collins and a small detachment of 25 men of the 11th Kansas crossed the Platte Bridge at a walk, then formed into a column of fours and rode west along the north bank at a trot to drive off any hostile Indians. Behind him, a 30-man contingent of the 3rd U.S.V.I. and its 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry escort crossed the bridge on foot as a support force for Collins, forming a skirmish line after they observed 400 Cheyenne emerge from the sand hills and arroyos between themselves and Collins.\n\nThe Indians had concealed large bands of warriors near the bridge and over the crest of the hills, possibly as many as a thousand Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho. Collins wheeled his detachment into two lines and charged the first group to emerge, only to find himself heavily outnumbered. He then ordered a retreat to the bridge by breaking through the Cheyenne to his rear. Simultaneously, yet another large force, this of Lakota, rushed the bridge from the south. The skirmish line at the bridge held the Lakota at bay with volley fire until 21 of the 26 troopers with Collins, all wounded to some extent, fought their way through. Five were killed, including Collins, who was wounded in the hip and shot in the forehead with an arrow while trying to aid a wounded soldier.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Platte_Bridge\n\nFort Caspar was a military post of the United States Army in present-day Wyoming, named after 2nd Lieutenant Caspar Collins, a U.S. Army officer who was killed in the 1865 Battle of the Platte Bridge Station against the Lakota and Cheyenne. Founded in 1859 along the banks of the North Platte River as a trading post and toll bridge on the Oregon Trail, the post was later taken over by the Army and named Platte Bridge Station to protect emigrants and the telegraph line against raids from Lakota and Cheyenne in the ongoing wars between those nations and the United States. The site of the fort, near the intersection of 13th Street and Wyoming Boulevard in Casper, Wyoming, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is now owned and operated by the City of Casper as the Fort Caspar Museum and Historic Site.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Caspar\n\nThe town of Casper Wyoming was named for nearby Fort Casper in 1888, by then a ruin. The fort had been named for Lt. Caspar Collins, killed near the fort by Indians in 1865. The Army misspelled his first name when they renamed Platte Bridge Station not long after his death.\n\nSource: https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/casper-wyoming\n\nSources\n\nhttp://casperjournal.com/community/article_0735cb8e-86cf-56e2-aa54-7048bdb5251a.html\n\n\"United States Census, 1850,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MXQZ-2RK : 12 April 2016), Casper W Collins in household of Wm O Collins, Hillsboro, Highland, Ohio, United States; citing family 80, NARA microfilm publication M432 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.).\n\n\"United States Census, 1860\", database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MCGC-D3L : 2 October 2017), Casper W Collins in entry for William O Collins, 1860.\n\n\"United States Civil War Soldiers Index, 1861-1865,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FSMT-JTG : 4 December 2014), Caspa W.
