        "text": "Ohio and the Civil War\n\nOhioans played an important role in the Civil War effort, supplying 319,189 Union soldiers for at least 29 artillery units, 13 cavalry units, and 198 infantry units. Ohio provided the third most troops, only behind New York and Pennsylvania, and led the Union in troops per capita. There were about 60 military camps established in Ohio, from Athens to Zanesville. Despite divided sentiments throughout Ohio, the state still contributed greatly to the Union victory. A number of prominent generals, including William T. Sherman and future U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant, came from Ohio. 360,222 Union soldiers lost their lives during the war, 35,475 from Ohio. Nearly 30,000 Ohioans came out of the war totally or partially disabled.\n\nFor more Ohio Civil War facts, visit the History Blog.\n\nOn Ohio in the Civil War, Larry Stevens has compiled a bibliography of known published sources for each Ohio regiment.\n\nSee also: How can I research my Civil War ancestor?\n\nSquirrel Hunters\n\nIn the autumn of 1862, Kirby Smith's 6,850 Confederate soldiers threatened to reach the Ohio River. Governor David Tod called upon the citizens of the state to form militia companies to assist with protecting the border. The response brought almost 16,000 men and boys, who came wearing an assortment of different clothing and carrying hunting rifles. It was noted that they looked like squirrel hunters. Since the Confederate army did not reach the Ohio River, the troops were sent home. On March 11, 1863 the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives voted to honor the men with discharge papers in recognition of their patriotism.\n\nThe Squirrel Hunters' Records [State Archives Series 119] includes the original handwritten roster of the Squirrel Hunters on microfilm roll GR3986 in the Library Microfilm Room.\n\nThe Index of the Ohio Squirrel Hunters Roster [R 929.3771 P456i] includes an index plus a history of the Squirrel Hunters' origin, activities, and discharge.

Anxious officials ordered Cincinnati citizens to form home guards, but black men willing to volunteer were rebuffed when they attempted to join a defense force. Instead, police serving as provost guards rounded up many and marched them by bayonet to build fortifications in Kentucky. Reacting to the shameful treatment of the blacks eager to support the Union, the commander of the Department of Ohio dispatched Major General Lewis Wallace to command the civilians and to liberate black men forced into service.\n\nJudge William Martin Dickson, who favored enlisting black soldiers in the Union Army, assumed command of the brigade, composed of 800 African American volunteers determined to fight to end slavery. From September 2-20, 1862 they cleared forests and built military roads, rifle pits, and fortifications. Receiving deserved praise for their labor, the unit disbanded when the Confederate forces no longer imperiled the city. Members of the Cincinnati Black Brigade, first black unit with military purpose in the North during the Civil War, later fought with the 127th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which became the 5th United States Colored Troops (USCT), the 54th and 55th Massachusetts and other Black regiments.

As the American Civil War continued, the government sought African American soldiers to assist in the war effort. John Mercer Langston, Ohio's first African American Lawyer, helped recruit and assemble Union troops, including the Massachusetts 54th, the first black regiment in the nation. 158 Ohioans joined the 54th regiment, along with 222 Ohioans in the 55th regiment. The 127th Ohio Volunteer Infantry was formed at Camp Delaware, and was redesignated the 5th United States Colored Troops regiment before moving to Norfolk, Virginia. Other USCT regiments include the 16th, 17th, 44th, 72nd, and 27th, which included over 100 men from Ross and Highland counties. In total, 5,092 Ohio African-Americans served in the USCT. Following the Civil War, the United States military continued to welcome African American soldiers into the ranks, although these soldiers were no longer designated United States Colored Troops. African Americans still served in segregated units, commanded by white officers.\n\nUnited States Colored Troops, 1863-1867 by William A.
