With an introduction and annotations by Mark A. Smith. softcover (6 x 9), ca. 15 photos, appendix, index. Published here for the first time, the Civil War combat memoir of Col. James Taylor Holmes of the 52nd Ohio Volunteers presents a richly detailed first-hand account of the June 1864 Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. Written in 1915, Holmesâ insightful narrative, with original hand-drawn diagrams, differs on key points from the accepted scholarship on troop movements and positions at Kennesaw, and questions the legitimacy of a battlefield monument. An extensive introduction and annotations by historian Mark A. Smith provide a brief yet comprehensive overview of the battle and places Holmesâ document in historical context. Garth D. Bishop is the great grandson of Col. James Taylor Holmes. He lives in Hopewell Junction, New York. Mark A. Smith is a professor at Fort Valley State University in Georgia.

For years the Ewing family of Ohio has been lost in the historical shadow cast by their in-law, General William T. Sherman. It was the Ewing family who raised Sherman, got him into West Point, and provided him with the financial resources and political connections to succeed in war. The patriarch, Thomas Ewing, counseled presidents and clashed with radical abolitionists and southern secessionists leading to the Civil War. Three Ewing sons became Union generals, served with distinction at Antietam and Vicksburg, marched through Georgia, and fought guerillas in Missouri.

Loop. Edited by Richard A. Baumgartner. Myron Loop belonged to the 68th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, a veteran 17th Corps organization that saw nearly four years' service during the Civil War. Observant and steadfast in keeping a daily wartime diary, Loop relied on it heavily to compose a memoir that was serialized in 21 issues of The National Tribune. The regiment saw service at Fort Donelson, Hatchie River, Raymond, Champion Hill, Vicksburg, Atlanta campaign, March to the Sea, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Because an \"official\" 68th Ohio regimental history never appeared in print, The Long Road Home doubles as a useful substitute. Richard A. Baumgartner has supplemented Loop's narrative with letter and diary excerpts written by 40 other 68th Ohio officers and enlisted men, and added 22 photographs and engravings.

During the Civil War, the legendary Fighting McCooks were familiar to most Americans. Time and the tempestuous twentieth century swept Ohio's famous fighting family into a twilight of obscurity. Now the true story of this remarkable Scotch-Irish family is finally seeing the bright light of day. The McCooks gave seventeen men in the fight to save the Union. Four lost their lives. The Family provided three major generals, three brigadier generals, one naval lieutenant, four surgeons, two colonels, one major, one lieutenant, one private, and one chaplain. The McCooks are followed across forty-six battlefields, in eleven states, across land and sea. Their lives are intimately intertwined with the most famous, and infamous, men of the time, including President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, and General Ulysses S. Grant. 421 pgs.

Staats. Readers are invited to take a ride with the Sixth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry; to relive the thrilling action, disappointments, and their ultimate victory. Through the power of their personal letters and diaries, over one hundred voices tell their stories from beyond the grave.

Although a successful businessman in Newark, Ohio, prior to the Civil War, Charles Dana Miller understood the necessity of leaving his business and his home to take part in the \"struggle for the life of the republic.\" Miller served as the regimental adjutant and rose in rank to captain. His experiences in the western theater are accurately and vividly detailed as he describes the hardships and routines of camp life and the battles from Fort Donelson to Jonesboro, providing political insights into the events of the times. The narrative includes descriptions and impressions of U.S. Grant and William T. Sherman and detailed accounts of the Ohio 76th Volunteer Infantry and the Army of the Tennessee's movements. This postwar memoir provides a rare firsthand account of the Battle of Arkansas Post, an obscure engagement with very little documentation from the perspective of an officer. Miller's flair for writing and attention to detail make this memoir an important addition to Civil War history and a welcome primary source of knowledge on the war's western theater.

The 11th Ohio played a crucial role during the Civil War years on the overland roads. The first battalion sent to Fort Laramie in 1862 had not volunteered to serve out west, though those recruited in 1863 and 1864 knew they were destined for western duty. They were among the last volunteers raised from any state during the Civil War to be discharged in July 1866. The thunder of the greater war drowned out the violent and deadly war in the West along the overland roads. And it has continued to do so. While both the Civil War and nineteenth-century western history have provided fertile fields for historical investigation, few historians have focused on the plight of the overland roads during the Civil War or the impact of the war on the area they crossed. The 11th Ohio had enlisted to fight Confederates. Instead they fought Native Americans, escorted emigrants and mail, and operated, rebuilt, and restrung the telegraph. They built and rebuilt tiny stations and other posts along the roads, died in combat, and froze to death in winter storms. For the most part, these Ohioans were strung out along the roads in small detachments, seldom in company strength, and the regiment never served or fought as one. 368 pages, containing notes, statistics, bibliography, and index. Embellished with nineteen illustrations and six maps. Order from Arthur H. Clark Company\n\nBuckeye Blood: Ohio at Gettysburg\n\nBy Richard A. Baumgartner. New Bicentennial commemorative book chronicles Ohio's participation at Gettysburg. \"No one has previously attempted to explore in print the story of Ohio's long overlooked but important role in this tremendous battle,\" says author-historian Richard A. Baumgartner, whose new book Buckeye Blood: Ohio at Gettysburg is now available. \"That story seems best told through the words and photographs of Buckeye soldiers who were there, and is especially appropriate in view of 2003 being Ohio's Bicentennial as well as Gettysburg's 140th battle anniversary year. Buckeye Blood should appeal to casual readers and the scholarly oriented alike,\" Baumgartner believes. \"For 14 decades Gettysburg's battlefield has drawn millions of tourists and history students to it like a magnet. Parts of it were consecrated by the blood of hundreds of Ohioans, and their sacrifice finally is being paid detailed attention.\" Hardcover with dust jacket, 8-1/2\" by 11\" format, 254 pages, 244 photographs, engravings and maps, notes, bibliography and index. Order from Blue Acorn Press\n\nTo Battle for God and the Right:\n\nThe Civil War Letterbooks of Emerson Opdycke\n\nEdited by Glenn V. Longacre and John E. Haas. Foreword by Peter Cozzens. Emerson Opdycke, a lieutenant with the 41st Ohio Infantry and later a commander of the 125th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, played pivotal roles in some of the major battles of the western theater, including Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Missionary Ridge. He won fame at the Battle of Franklin when his brigade saved the Union Army from defeat. Opdycke's wartime letters to his wife, Lucy, offer the immediacy of the action as it unfolded and provide a glimpse into the day-to-day life of a soldier. 352 pages. 16 photographs. Order from University of Illinois Press\n\nA Grassroots History of the American Civil War, Volume IV: The Life and Times of Colonel William Stedman of the 6th Ohio Cavalry\n\nby Richard J. Staats. Stedman was a well-known abolitionist who was quite active in the Underground Railroad, and was president of the Western Anti-Slavery Society. He fought in many cavalry battles on the eastern front, and at one time he commanded a brigade of Union Cavalry. His service record was outstanding, and the official records of the war verify his bravery. He also served in the Ohio State Legislature. During the Civil War, the soldiers were free to write to their hometown newspapers, and in some cases their relatives and friends furnished the letters to the editors. A number of those letters appear in this work, to illustrate and fill in the narrative of the 6th Ohio's record under Stedman. Letters between the colonel and his family add warmth to the text. 416 pp., bibl., illus., maps, index, paperback. Order from Heritage Books Inc.\n\nSacrifice at Chickamauga. A History of the 89th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment\n\nby Bryan P. Weaver with H. Lee Fenner. This book is an attempt to portray the events of 1001 men from southwest Ohio during the Civil War. You will follow several soldiers of all ranks through the war in a day-by-day diary format. The relatively inexperienced regiment met its first combat in the infamous battle of Chickamauga - a Union defeat. In a cruel twist of fate, the 89th was abandoned on Horseshoe Ridge, where they fought valiantly until their ammunition was exhausted. Along with parts of three regiments, the 89th Ohio was captured. Very few escaped - only 75 men reported to duty the next day. After Chickamauga, the story takes two roads. One road was traveled by an augmented regiment that helped capture Atlanta, went with General Sherman to the sea, and eventually journeyed to Washington, DC, for the Grand Review. Those men captured at Chickamauga were sent down a heart breaking road to several Confederate prisons: Libby, Belle Isle, Salisbury and the notorious Andersonville prison.

Blazer's Independent Union Scouts\n\nBy Darl L. Stephenson. In the fall of 1863, Union Colonel Carr B. White formed a group of scouts and sharpshooters, headed by Capt. Richard Blazer of the 91st Ohio Volunteer Infantry, to fight the bushwhackers in the mountains of West Virginia. The unit was so successful that Gen. George Crook mounted the group in 1864 to combat rebel guerrillas, make deep raids, and act as the front and rear guard of the army, giving them the most dangerous of missions. In the Shenandoah Valley, General Philip Sheridan gave them the mandate to take on the renowned Confederate partisan John S. Mosby and his rangers. Equipped with advanced Spencer repeating rifles, they took the war to Mosby's Rangers as a regular cavalry could not do. Many soldiers from the following Ohio regiments were detailed to Blazer's Scouts: 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, 12th, 23rd, 34th, 36th, and 91st Ohio Infantries. 352 pgs. 70 illustrations.

Horwitz. 456 pgs. \"The Rebels are coming!\" That was the cry in July 1863 when General John Hunt Morgan and his guerrilla force of 2,500 Confederate cavalry terrorized towns and farms in Ohio and Indiana. Best known as Morgan's Raid, it covered over 1,000 miles through Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio. This is the true story about Morgan's most famous raid. Readers will ride along with the cavalry on this treacherous journey of high adventure. Many of these stories have never been published before about one of the South's most dashing, daring and dynamic cavalry leaders -- and the men who were willing to follow him into hell. After five years of writing and fifteen years of research, Lester Horwitz chronicles the first book-length account of this legendary raid in The Longest Raid of the Civil War.
