        "text": "Colonel D.L. Clinch's regiment, 4th Georgia Volunteer Cavalry, Provisional Army of the Confederate States, grew out of a need for a military force-in-being in the coastal region of southeastern Georgia during the Civil War. This sparsely-populated, far-flung region, which contributed several regiments of infantry to the Confederate army, was virtually without defense by mid-1862, when Confederate authorities had abandoned the practically indefensible coastal area with its numerous rivers, bays, creeks, tidal estuaries, and off-shore islands, and much of its male white population had left to join the Confederate army. Due to their exposed locations, the off-shore islands, plus Brunswick, Darien, and St. Marys, had all been abandoned and the residents had ârefugeedâ to safer locales in the uplands. The only formal military forces remaining in the area were several independent companies of partisan rangers or cavalry mustered for state service and three excess mounted companies which had been spun off from the 26th (formerly 13th) Georgia Volunteer Infantry and were left behind when that regiment went north in the early summer of 1862 to join the Confederate forces being gathered in Northern Virginia to confront the growing Federal armies located around Washington DC.\n\nIn early 1862, Confederate military authorities organized these various mounted companies into âThe Cavalry Command South of the Altamaha Riverâ, and put them under the command of Duncan L. Clinch, Jr., a local planter and an army veteran of the war with Mexico. He was the son and namesake of the late highly-regarded veteran of the War of 1812, Indian fighter, planter, and public servant - Brigadier General Duncan L. Clinch, Sr., of Camden County. The junior Clinch located his headquarters at Waynesville, which was growing significantly in regional importance with the warâs progression and deteriorating conditions on the coast. For a time, Clinchâs command shared the small village with several thousand coastal refugees, and soon saw it become the regionâs de-facto capital.\n\nThe initial organization of the âCavalry Command South of the Altamaha Riverâ was:\n\nCommanding Officer -\n\nMajor Duncan Lamont Clinch, Jr.\n\nCompany Commanders -\n\nâWayne Rangersâ\n\nCaptain Thomas Spalding Hopkins\n\nâCamden Chasseursâ\n\nCaptain George Lang\n\nâCamden Mounted Riflesâ\n\nCaptain Alexander Smith Atkinson\n\nâGlynn Guardsâ\n\nCaptain George Christopher Dent\n\nâAtlantic and Gulf Guardsâ\n\nCaptain Enoch Daniel Hendry\n\nIn the spring of 1862, the Confederate army was reorganized for the duration of the war, and most of the commandâs company officers were replaced at elections attendant to the reorganization, including all the above company commanders.\n\nThe new company commanders were:\n\nâWayne Rangersâ\n\nCaptain Joseph Sinclair Wiggins\n\nâCamden Chasseursâ\n\nCaptain John Readdick\n\nâCamden Mounted Riflesâ\n\nCaptain Nathan Atkinson Brown\n\nâGlynn Guardsâ\n\nCaptain William Miles Hazzard\n\nâAtlantic and Gulf Guardsâ\n\nCaptain Allen C. Strickland\n\nIn June 1862, due to the abandonment of Brunswick and the urgent need for rails elsewhere in the Confederacy, as well as to prevent their use by the Federals, the rails on the Brunswick and Florida Railroad were removed from Brunswick to Waynesville by civilian laborers, probably slaves, working under the direction of Clinch and fed from funds reimbursed by the Confederate Army.\n\nIn the same timeframe, Clinch was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and authorized an Executive/Operations Officer. Additional companies were added to his command as the year progressed, and it was renamed the 3rd Battalion, Georgia Volunteer Cavalry. By late 1862, the organization of the 3rd Battalion was:\n\nIn December 1862, Captain Strickland of Company A died from an internal infection or injury and was replaced by Alexander McMillan.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion, Georgia Volunteer Cavalry operated solely inside its nominal area of responsibility - the coastal region of southeastern Georgia between the Altamaha and St. Marys Rivers. Its mission was to perform scouting, picketing, and courier service in the region and, most importantly, to offer some credible resistance to Federal attempts to disrupt its contribution to the Confederate war effort. This resulted in some skirmishing with blockading Federals, as well as a few disaffected slaves and non-compliant conscripts and Confederate army deserters. Several men from the command were killed or wounded in these frays.\n\nIn early 1863, the battalion, having recently been enlarged to ten companies, and numbering almost a thousand men, was re-designated the 4th Regiment, Georgia Volunteer Cavalry. At that point, the companies were all re-lettered, D.L. Clinch was promoted to full colonel, John L. Harris to lieutenant colonel, and J.C. McDonald of the âShiloh Troopsâ to major. David Crum was promoted to McDonaldâs vacancy at company command in the âShiloh Troopsâ, and Clinchâs younger brother, Nicholas Bayard Clinch, was brought in as regimental adjutant at the rank of 1st Lieutenant.\n\nThe regimental organization at that time was:\n\nIn March, the regiment was ordered to support other Confederate troops gathering near Jacksonville, Florida, to confront some recently-arrived water-borne Federals probing the St. Johns River for opportunities to disrupt the local economy and to perhaps establish a permanent foot-hold in the region. Clinch took his third-in-command, Major J.C. McDonald, a battery of three pieces of artillery, and five companies, all told 277 men. While the records are not definitive about it, the companies probably were:\n\nA -\n\nCaptain J.S. Wiggins\n\nC -\n\nCaptain N. A. Brown\n\nD -\n\nCaptain John Readdick\n\nE -\n\nCaptain R.N. King\n\nH -\n\nCaptain T.S. Wylly\n\n1st Lieutenant Charles F. Matthews of Company C and 2nd Lieutenant John L. Morgan of Company G probably commanded the regimentâs battery of artillery on the expedition. It appears that the regimental second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Harris, and the remainder of the command, stayed in Georgia and continued its mission of protecting the southeastern Georgia coast. This brief deployment, in which Clinch served as the field commander of all the Confederate forces, involved some skirmishing and probes, but no serious fighting. It was concluded with both sides throwing a few artillery rounds at each other, then retreating to their defenses to observe a stalemate. With the arrival of other Florida forces, Clinch brought his men back home, arriving in Georgia on about 25 March. The Federals soon abandoned the effort and passed on the opportunity to permanently occupy Jacksonville after robbing a few plantations and generally destroying anything of value they could find farther up the St. Johns River.\n\nFor the remainder of 1863, Clinchâs 4th Georgia Cavalry continued to operate exclusively in the southeastern region of Georgia, as previously described. Increased activity by the ever-aggressive Federals in the region, operating primarily out of St. Simons Island and Fernandina, Florida, resulted in additional skirmishes, the most notable of which were two altercations, one in April and another in June. In the first case, the commander of the âGlynn Guardsâ, Captain W.M. Hazzard returned to his home grounds on Saint Simons, along with a squad of his men, and conducted offensive operations against the Federal forces there, determined to do damage to their local base of operations. While killing or wounding several Federals, he burned the wharf and the large storehouses at the southwestern end of the island, which were located around Gascoigne Bluff. During this operation, the Confederates destroyed a large quantity of coal, plus some quartermaster and commissary stores, which had been landed there by the enemy. The second incident involved a day-long skirmish on 8 June 1863 in which Hazzard and his âGlynn Guardsâ took on several boat-loads of Yankees attempting to destroy some salt-manufacturing apparatus in the Turtle River above Brunswick. Several more Federals were killed or wounded in this fray. Other such events involved various Federal excursions throughout the war on the Satilla, St. Marys, and Turtle Rivers to attack plantations, salt-works, sawmills, brickyards, shipyards, turpentine distilleries, potential blockade runners, and other economic enterprises. And, the regiment continued to occasionally encounter armed Confederate deserters, non-compliant conscripts, runaway slaves, and disaffected citizens. These encounters, of course, resulted in several woundings and deaths amongst the regimentâs personnel. To further burden its members, in 1863, the regiment suffered the ravages of a severe typhoid epidemic, having for several months as many as 110 men sick at a time and ultimately suffering about two dozen deaths to the disease.\n\nUp to that point, the regiment had based its headquarters at Waynesville, while keeping the individual companies at various camps located closer to, and maintaining many picket posts along, the coast. In the fall of 1863, Clinch moved his headquarters to Camp Mercer, near Screven, probably due to the Confederate governmentâs decision to remove the rails from Waynesville to the Atlantic & Gulf Railroad near present-day Waycross, but his regimentâs mission remained the same, and he continued to keep most of his companies, or detachments from them, on or near the coast. The summer and fall of 1863 also witnessed a considerable effort by the regiment to collect recalcitrant conscripts and deserters around South Georgia, involving about a dozen separate patrols and at least 85 men. This activity occasionally resulted in some skirmishes and a few more casualties.\n\nIn the same time-frame, about 100 men of the regiment whose horses had died, or become sick or lame, were transferred to a new unit formed under Colonel Clinch's younger brother and former Adjutant, newly-elected Captain N. Bayard Clinch. This command, âClinchâs Artillery Companyâ, or âClinchâs Light Batteryâ, would move to the vicinity of Savannah in June of 1864, from which time its mission and locations would be separate from those of the 4th Georgia Cavalry. In December 1863, Captain J.S. Wiggins of Company A was elected to the state House of Representatives and resigned. His place as commander of the âWayne Rangersâ was filled by Alexander Lang.\n\nThe mission of the 4th Georgia was enlarged in early 1864 when Colonel Clinch was called upon to contribute again to the meager Confederate forces in northeastern Florida opposing those of a sizable new group of invading Federals that resulted in the battle of Olustee, some 50 or so miles west of Jacksonville. Clinch's command contributed 250 of its nominal strength of over 900 men, which included detachments from, or all of, the following companies:\n\nB -\n\nCaptain W. Miles Hazzard\n\nC -\n\nCaptain Nathan A. Brown\n\nD -\n\nCaptain John Readdick\n\nF -\n\nCaptain James P. Turner\n\nG -\n\nCaptain Alexander McMillan\n\nI -\n\nCaptain John C. Nicholls\n\nK -\n\nCaptain David Crum\n\nThe remainder of the regiment again stayed in Georgia under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harris and Major McDonald to continue to perform its mission there. This division of responsibilities was dictated by the continuing campaign of attack against the economy of southeastern Georgia by the Federals. In fact, Major McDonald was in command of a large detachment operating around the St. Marys River contesting a significant Federal force operating on the river while his colonel was leading others from the regiment to Florida. Clinch, and the portion of the regiment going with him, left on horse-back on 13 February from Screven or, within a day later, from the other camps from which some of the companies were operating. Apparently, the regiment was consolidated around Kingâs Ferry on the St. Marys River and moved on to Olustee together from there. Clinch sent his heavy equipage on its way to Florida by the rails to Valdosta, from which it was shipped via wagon to the railroad at Madison, Florida, and eventually met them somewhere around Olustee. Clinch and his troopers arrived in Olustee on 17 February, and were involved in the initial fighting early on the morning of the twentieth.\n\nClinch and Colonel Carraway Smith of the 2nd Florida Cavalry were sent out with their cavalry by General Finegan to locate the approaching enemy and then draw them back toward the well-entrenched Confederate infantry near Olustee. As the main battle developed, the regiment was moved to the left flank of the Confederate lines to prevent any attempt by the Federals to outflank the Southern infantry on that side. In the process of taking station, many of the regimentâs horses bogged down in a swampy area and some were lost. This unfortunate event, plus a severe leg wound suffered early in the action that caused Colonel Clinch to retire from the field, effectively took the regiment out of the remaining dayâs fight. Captain N.A. Brown of Company C assumed command when Clinch left the field, but the regiment was not involved in any further substantive action on that day. A clairvoyant, Mrs. D.L. Clinch, who had foreseen her husbandâs condition in a dream, soon arrived on the battlefield and took him back to their recently-purchased Brooks County plantation to recover.\n\nThe battle, a resounding Confederate victory, caused the Federals to retreat to the safety of Jacksonville and the protection of the heavily-armed army transports and navy gunboats there.\n\nWith the successful thwarting of that latest threat to the security of the âCradle of Secessionâ, on the 13th of July Lieutenant Colonel Harris and his detachment were ordered to re-join the remainder of the regiment near Atlanta, probably traveling by rail and arriving by the end of the month.\n\nMajor Confederate and Federal Army Maneuvers Around Atlanta\n\nJuly - September 1864\n\nfrom\n\nâCivil War Battle Atlasâ\n\nBy\n\nTime Life Books\n\nThose men who had gone directly to Atlanta traveled via the rails to Macon, where they disembarked and were immediately diverted to Columbus on their horses. This detour was in response to a potential threat against the huge Confederate industrial complex there from Federal Major General Rousseauâs raid into the region coming out of northeastern Alabama. When that threat dissipated, they rode their horses back to Fort Valley near Macon, then on to Atlanta where they joined the Confederate Army of Tennessee and prepared to participate in the desperate Confederate defensive effort there. Upon arrival, the reunited regiment reported to Major General âFighting Joeâ Wheelerâs Cavalry Corps in the Confederate Army of Tennessee. For a period of time, it was stationed on the eastern side of Atlanta around Stone Mountain, where it was involved in a series of skirmishes with Federal cavalry. Then, in late August it was moved to the southwestern side of Atlanta, where it was dismounted and placed in trenches previously constructed by other Confederate troops at Mount Gilead Church, located about five miles west of East Point.\n\nOn 31 August, Sherman sent his 100,000 man army to the west of the city swinging counter-clockwise like a hinged gate to cut its remaining rail connections to the south and west, and in the process forcing the 4th Georgia Cavalry from its breastworks at Mount Gilead Church and driving it back to the vicinity of Rough and Ready. Several of the regimentâs members were reported to have been killed or wounded in this fighting and the battle of Jonesboro the following day.\n\nAmong the regimentâs casualties was Captain T.S. Wylly, who was so badly wounded in the neck and shoulder that he was left on the battlefield at Jonesboro when the regiment retreated from Shermanâs overwhelming forces. Surgeon Richard B. Burroughs went back to the battlefield and rescued Wylly, hauling him to safety on his own horse. As Atlanta was falling to the Federal forces shortly thereafter, the regiment was remounted and assigned, along with other cavalry units, to serve as the rear guard while Confederate forces evacuated the city. Soon, they were involved in additional skirmishing with Federal cavalry, as the Confederate army relocated south of Atlanta. Several more men were wounded or captured during these operations.\n\nFor a time thereafter, the regiment accompanied General John B. Hood in his brief campaign to lure Sherman into the mountains northwest of Atlanta, and operated as far as northeastern Alabama and possibly southeastern Tennessee, skirmishing and scouting on a regular basis. Hoodâs attempt was for little avail since Sherman would not take the bait, remaining with the majority of his army near Atlanta while his cavalry harassed and chased Hoodâs infantry, and the several strong Federal outposts along the railroads north of Atlanta kept Hoodâs attention focused on small gains with little strategic value.\n\nThe recent operations had been difficult and demanding and, after three months of arduous combat service, many of the men in the regiment and their horses were worn down to a state of ineffectiveness. Further sickness and wounds, both new and unhealed old ones, were beginning to diminish the numbers of active men in the regiment, as well as its leadership. Approximately 80 members of the command, out of about 450 who had deployed to Atlanta, were hospitalized in the summer and fall of 1864. Captain N.A. Brown of Company C was admitted to the Macon Blind School Hospital with âBilious Feverâ on about 23 September, where he remained until late December. At the same time, Colonel D.L. Clinch again relinquished command to seek medical care. On 26 September, he was reported to have been hospitalized in Macon with a broken leg and a âsupporating (sic) woundâ, which no doubt was his unhealed Olustee wound. Further, on 28 September 1864, Captain David Crum died in camp somewhere around Atlanta, possibly as the result of a mortal wound suffered in mid-August during some fighting at the main ford on the Connesauga River near Dalton, Georgia, and was replaced as commander of the âShiloh Troopsâ by his brother, former Company 1st Sergeant E.P. (Pickford) Crum.\n\nThese conditions were recognized by Confederate authorities and, during a brief respite in the campaign in late October, about 100 men and some of the regiment's horses were sent to Ladiga, in eastern Alabama, where they rested and recuperated under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harris after the vigorous campaigning of the previous months. Not shown on modern maps, Ladiga was just across the state line from present-day Cedartown, Georgia. After some ten days there, in early November they were ordered to join the remainder of the regiment, presumably operating under the command of Major McDonald. They deployed near Atlanta for the next two weeks, scouting and harassing Federal troops.\n\nShermanâs March to the Sea\n\nNovember - December 1864\n\nfrom\n\nâ The Confederacy â\n\nMacMillan Reference USA\n\nIn mid-November, Sherman destroyed much of what was left in Atlanta, and embarked with 60,000 picked men on his infamous âMarch to the Seaâ, exploiting the hollow shell that the Confederate military had become, destroying and pillaging everything that he could lay his hands upon between Atlanta and Savannah that had potential use to the Southern economy and the Confederate military forces. From then to the end of December, the regiment was involved in a largely ineffective Confederate opposition to Sherman's aggressive predators, skirmishing almost constantly for six weeks, losing men to various causes along the way, and possibly also losing its battle-flag in a skirmish with Federal cavalry near Waynesboro in Burke County on 28 November.1\n\nOn 4 December in a pitched cavalry battle with Kilpatrickâs command at Waynesboro, the regiment suffered badly. Major Jesse C. McDonald was captured, and several other men were captured, killed, or wounded. Captains E.P. Crum and J.P. Turner were among the latter. Surgeon Richard B. Burroughs, assisted by an enlisted doctor, Sergeant George Lang, and probably other personnel, performed several intricate operations, including amputations of severely-damaged limbs, amongst the wounded men of the regiment, doing so in the field without the usual facilities and medical supplies and under sanitary conditions that were marginal at best. That they all survived is a testimony to his exceptional medical skills.\n\nIn mid-December, Sherman arrived at the coast, where, in a brief and hotly-contested fight on 13 December, he captured Fort McAllister, which was located near the mouth of the Ogeechee River and guarded the southern water-borne approaches to Savannah. Captain N.B. Clinch's Artillery Company, comprised largely of former 4th Georgia Cavalry-men, were all captured or killed there, and Captain Clinch was severely wounded, along with a goodly portion of his men. The loss of Fort McAllister sealed Savannahâs fate, because Sherman had thereby gained access to the huge source of refit and supply lurking offshore in the Federal fleet awaiting his arrival on the coast. Savannah fell to the Federals on 21 December when Camden County native, Lieutenant General W.J. Hardee, escaping Shermanâs reaching grasp in the still of the night, took his 10,000 man force across the Savannah River into South Carolina.\n\nThis effectively ended major military operations in Georgia. Sherman occupied Savannah to rest and refit his army over the Christmas holidays. Then, in early 1865, leaving behind sufficient forces to hold the city and to keep the few remaining regional Confederate military forces at bay, he moved his massive force into the Carolinas, where it encountered a gallant, but feeble and ultimately futile, resistance.\n\nThe whereabouts of Clinchâs 4th Georgia Cavalry during the remainder of the war is subject to several differences of opinion. Some references have them accompanying Wheeler into the Carolinas, surrendering with Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's army in North Carolina. Others have them remaining in Georgia, operating for a while to the west and south of Savannah under Brigadier General Alfred Iverson, then resuming their previous mission of picketing and courier service along the southeastern coast. It is the compilerâs definitive conclusion that the regiment remained in Georgia, for the following reasons.\n\nIt would appear that the Confederate forces operating in Georgia and Florida came under the terms of the surrender negotiated by Johnston and Sherman in North Carolina during late April. This possibly has led some historians to the erroneous conclusion that the 4th Georgia was actually in North Carolina with Johnstonâs army at the time. The evidence, including a number of official reports to, from, or concerning the regiment during the time, as well as numerous post-war applications for Confederate pensions by former members of the command, overwhelmingly proves that it remained in Georgia, initially operating below Savannah, but eventually returning to Camp Mercer, near Screven in Wayne County, Georgia, and resuming its earlier mission to protect the coastal region between the Altamaha and the St. Marys Rivers. Further, the record is clear that Colonel Clinch returned from his hospitalization in March 1865 and reassumed command at Camp Mercer, dissolving the regiment there shortly after Johnstonâs surrender. He held a ceremony, probably in the first week of May, at which all the men still present for duty in the regiment (likely no more than about 200 of all ranks) were formed up into companies. Clinch made a brief speech, which was seconded by Captain Nicholls and other officers, and admonished his men to âreturn home and go to workâ. Lieutenant Colonel Harris, who apparently was never captured during the war, was paroled at Augusta after the cessation of hostilities, and the majority of the regimentâs members were paroled in Thomasville, Georgia, during the month of May.\n\n1 Brigadier General H. Judson Kilpatrick, Shermanâs Chief of Cavalry, reported capturing the flag of a 4th Georgia Cavalry there on that date but did not specify which of the two regiments it was.\n\nThe records of Clinchâs 4th Georgia Cavalry for the time after June 1864 are woefully sparse, probably due primarily to the destruction of the records of the Confederate Army of Tennessee at the chaotic evacuation of Atlanta in September 1864, and obviously do not fully reflect the experiences of the regimentâs personnel during that dangerous and debilitating time. But, those which have survived show that, of the somewhat over 2300 men who served in the regiment during the conflict, at least 68 men died while serving in the command, nine of them were killed in action or died of wounds suffered in combat with the enemy, and 45 were captured. Six of the latter died while being held in Northern prison camps and are included in the 68 dead.\n\nAs was the case in most other commands of the Confederate Army, by the end of hostilities, the merciless demands of war had ground down the active personnel of the 4th Georgia Cavalry to a mere token of their former numbers. One source estimated that Clinchâs regiment comprised only about 200 officers and men in May 1865 when it concluded operations. This represents over a 90 % depletion rate, and is only one of the many measures of the awful cost of the tragic sectional war between Americans in the 1860s. In fact, out of the much-reduced numbers that deployed to Atlanta in the summer of 1864 (about 450 men), at least 78 had been hospitalized for various reasons during the Atlanta campaign and the âMarch to the Seaâ, which represents about 20 % of those that were still active in the regiment at the time of their departure for that seat of war. The estimated numbers of men remaining in active service at the conclusion of hostilities would indicate that more than half of the approximately 425 men of the regiment that were paroled at the end of the war were no longer actively serving with the regiment.\n\nWhile few of these losses were due to death, it is indicative of the degree to which the cruel processes of war can gleefully consume the human resources of any society. Further, while these figures do not replicate the degree of decimation seen in the many Southern units which performed front-line duties far longer than did Colonel Duncan L. Clinchâs âWiregrass Fourthâ Georgia Cavalry, they still represent much valiant service and personal sacrifice, as well as unfathomable tragedy on the part of the families whose men lost their lives while serving their society.\n\nYes, âWar is Hellâ indeed!\n\n- O.J.

I, 4th GA Cavalry, then transferring to Clinchâs Artillery Company 1 December 1863, being captured at Fort McAllister 13 December 1864, held at Elmira, NY until the end of the war, and being paroled at Thomasville 19 May 1865. The matter of his capture is not corroborated by the records of either the cavalry regiment or the artillery company, and is not consistent with a parole at Thomasville in 1865.=\n\n3. Raulerson had been transferred to the 22nd Battalion Georgia Acting Heavy Artillery. Family lore states that he was captured while in a Confederate hospital in Savannah 21 December 1864, was transferred to a Federal hospital from which he escaped 21 January 1865, then reported to LCOL John L. Harris commanding the 4th GA Cavalry at Southwellâs Bridge on the Ohoopee River. He was sent home to recover his health, from which he returned to the 4th GA after a week, remaining with that command until the end of hostilities.\n\nAppendix D\n\nSelected Biographical Sketches\n\nCOL Duncan L.

Clinch, Sr., USA, and Eliza Bayard McIntosh of Camden County, Georgia.\n\nEducated at Franklin College (now University of Georgia) and University of North Carolina - A.B. 1847.\n\nServed as a volunteer in the U.S. Army during the Mexican War, 1847 - 1848. 1st LT, 13th US Infantry 9 April 1847, CAPT 30 July 1847. The command, one of several new regiments in the regular army authorized by Congress, was nonetheless staffed largely by volunteers. Falling under the nominal command of General Zachary Taylor, who was operating in northern Mexico at the time, it was organized somewhere on the Gulf Coast, possibly near New Orleans, and took several months to recruit and train before deploying to the Mexican theater. It arrived in Mexico during September 1847 and was stationed in the highlands above Vera Cruz until May or June 1848. Clinch, assigned to recruiting duty for his first several months, arrived after the regiment, and brought with him about six dozen new recruits from Georgia and Alabama. Since General Winfield Scottâs campaign to conquer middle Mexico had just concluded by the time of the regimentâs arrival, it is unlikely that Clinch saw any substantive combat. Although there were likely some skirmishes with the many guerrilla groups that harassed the Americans after major combat had ceased, his regiment seems to have been involved primarily in the various and sundry duties of an army of occupation while in Mexico. It served in garrison, escort, and guard duties, and many of its officers were detached for such temporary assignments. His experience was typical in that, while he commanded Company D during most of his service, he was also on detached duty as a quartermaster for a good part of that time. His Mexican War service was rounded out by a three-month sick leave from April to June 1848. Upon the regimentâs return to the U.S. in mid-1848, it was disbanded, and Clinch was discharged, at Mobile, Alabama, on 15 July 1848. He later stated that, at the close of war, he was serving on the staff of General Scott, but no documentation has been found to support that statement. Possibly it was during some of his detached duty. He drew a Federal pension of $8 per month for this service, commencing in November 1888.\n\nMarried 15 November 1855 to Susan Ann Hopkins, born 27 December 1835, only child of William Timothy and Elizabeth H. Hopkins of Camden County. Duncan and Susan Clinch lost a child, Henry McIntosh Clinch, age 11 months, to disease in 1859 and another, F.C., âFrankâ, age 3 or 4, during their stay at Waynesville during the Civil War, probably in 1862 or â63. Another son was born during the war and at least three more were born immediately afterwards. She died 15 May 1879 at Waynesville at the age of 43. Buried initially in Waynesville, her remains were later moved to the Oak Grove Cemetery in Brunswick.\n\nCAPT - MAJ - LCOL - COL, PACS:\n\nVolunteer Aide-de-Camp to BGEN A.R.

The information on âIncacheeâ is interesting, in that it was the name of the plantation of CAPT Alexander Smith Atkinson, first commander of the âCamden Mounted Riflesâ, later a company of the 4th GA Cavalry, who owned and lived on the place before and after the war, and died there in 1894. Clinch applied for his Mexican War pension from that address. He was active in local politics from 1885 to the late 1880s.\n\nDied in October 1890, buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, Brunswick, with his wife.\n\nLCOL John Lewis Harris, PACS (27 May 1821(3) - 5 May 1879)\n\nBorn in Richmond County, Georgia, at the family plantation, âWoodhillâ to Benjamin F.

Harris remained in command of the regiment during the fighting around Atlanta and the Confederate opposition to Shermanâs âMarch to the Seaâ. He retained command during the regimentâs operations in southeastern Georgia from December 1864 to March 1865, when Clinch returned to duty and command of the regiment, at Camp Mercer, Screven Georgia.\n\nPost-war: Farmed briefly in Richmond County at the family homestead, in the fall of 1865 he moved to a farm in Ware County and practiced law. In 1870 moved to a farm in Glynn County, continued to practice law, then took residence in Brunswick during the fall of 1871, where he practiced law until 1873 when he was appointed Judge of the Superior Court, Brunswick Circuit, which included the surrounding counties. He served in that capacity until his death, and was known far and wide thereafter as âJudge Harrisâ. He was highly lauded by the citizens of Brunswick, as well as by his professional contemporaries of the Brunswick Bar, in several public memorials and his obituary.\n\nBuried in Oak Grove Cemetery, Brunswick, with his wife.\n\nMAJ Jesse Campbell McDonald, PACS (4 July 1832 - 18 April 1918)\n\nBorn in McIntosh County to Alexander and Margaret Campbell McDonald.

Commanded the regiment at the Battle of Olustee after COL Clinchâs wounding early in the fighting.

Buried Homeward Cemetery, Camden County.\n\nCAPT David Crum, PACS (23 October 1837 - 28 September 1864)\n\nBorn in Camden County to James Grey Crum and Marie Louise Clark.\n\nPVT- 1st SGT - 2nd LT - 1st LT - CAPT, PACS:\n\nSecond commander: âShiloh Troopsâ. According to Vocelle, he died in camp during 1864, cause and place unknown, as is his burial site. An analysis of the official records of the war indicates that he was possibly mortally wounded in action in mid-August 1864 at the main ford on the Connesauga River, near Dalton, GA and subsequently died in camp, either near Stockbridge, about 10 miles east of Jonesborough, where the regiment had been camped since the early part of September, or near Palmetto, where General John B. Hood had been concentrating his army since the 19th.\n\nCAPT Edwin Pickford Crum, PACS (10 July 1839 â 3 January 1897)\n\nBorn in Camden County to James Grey Crum and Marie Louise Clark.\n\nPVT - 1st SGT - CAPT, PACS:\n\nThird and final commander: âShiloh Troopsâ in 1864, succeeding his deceased brother David. Wounded at Waynesboro, GA, 3 December 1864.\n\nDied in Williamson County Texas, buried in the Odd-Fellows Cemetery in Georgetown.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: Vocelle gives parental information on the two Crums as David and (?) Liles Crum, and the name Pitchford for the younger of the two. However, both the 1850 and 1860 census data for Camden County show a family of that surname with brothers David and Edwin (or E.P.), born about 1838 and 1840, respectively, and with parents James Grey and Marie Louise (or M. L.) Clark Crum. Further, an internet posting, which lists what appears to be the above family with pre-war residence in Camden County Georgia and post-war residence in Texas (from c.1874), in which state Vocelle puts âPitchfordâsâ death, shows the parents as James Grey and Marie Louise Clark Crum, and lists E.P. as Edwin Pickford. This would appear to be the correct family information. Further, the foregoing family names and relationships, as well as the birth and death dates, have been corroborated in a telephone conversation on 16 January 2008 with Ernest D. Crum, Jr., of Buda TX, a descendant of PVT Ernest Crum of Co. K who was the younger brother of the above Crums.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAPT William Miles Hazzard, PACS (1833 - 23 December 1904)\n\nBorn in South Carolina to William W.

He was also a director of the Georgetown Rice Milling Company, of which he was a founder.
