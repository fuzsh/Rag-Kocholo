        "text": "Michael W. Taylor\n\nHow much of the fatal policy of states, and of the miseries and degradations of social man, have been occasioned by the false notions of honor inspired by the works of Homer, it is not easy to ascertain … My veneration for his genius is equal to that of his most idolatrous readers; but my reflections on the history of human errors have forced upon me the opinion that his existence has really proved one of the signal misfortunes of mankind.\n\nJoel Barlow, Preface to The Columbiad (1809)\n\nThat winter of 1974–1975 was a period of political uncertainty following the resignation of Richard Nixon. There were severe economic troubles that followed in the wake of the Yom Kippur War and the Arab oil embargo. The final tragic chapter of the war in South Vietnam and Cambodia — in which I had served as a naval officer — was taking place. The Turks had overrun the excavation site at which I had worked as a field archaeologist with Emily Vermeule in the previous summer, and there had been looting of the dig finds (over which members of the excavation team including myself had labored many hours) that were stored in the apotheke of Agios Mammas Church in Morphou. The academic job market seemed almost non-existent. But despite the prevailing troubled atmosphere, Greg Nagy kept our attention focused on the language of Homer and kept asking about the transcendent meaning of the words. And he never discouraged, but instead encouraged and urged on the thinking processes and ideas of a lowly graduate student.\n\nI came to my subject after spending the 1973–1974 school year as the Charles Eliot Norton Fellow at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. It was my good fortune that one of the resident scholars that year was Evelyn Harrison of New York University who generously gave her time in discussing with me my nascent ideas about the context of late Archaic and early Classical Athenian sculpture. Her comments on the Athena Parthenos as we stood before the small copy in the Patras Museum on a School trip helped me formulate my ideas about the iconography of the Athenian state.\n\nIn recent years, I have gained the insight that my ideas about the religious usage of the tyrant slayers as founding heroes of the Athenian democracy were influenced by my childhood spent as the son of Southern Baptist missionaries living amongst the Yoruba in what was then the Western Region of the British Protectorate of Nigeria. My father, a Duke University Ph.D. in Southern History, taught history at Iwo Baptist College (now Bowen University in Iwo, Nigeria). He often reminded me of the parallels between the Greeks and the Yoruba, both living in city-states and both worshipping a pantheon of deities. As a child, I sometimes came upon a dish of food set before a painted rock as I explored the bush around our mission station and often saw women of the town praying for fertility before a giant baobab tree around which strips of cloth were tied. From these experiences, I came to understand how a propitiatory religion works, and in retrospect looking back years later, I can see that I applied that understanding to the tyrant slayers.\n\nMy desire to be an archaeologist was greatly influenced by my historian father, but I did not need much pushing in that direction after visiting the ancient ruins of Africa, the Middle East and Europe in my childhood and early teenage years. I owe a great debt to my parents, Orville W. Taylor and Evelyn B. Taylor, for the gift of a love of learning and the opportunity to explore our past.\n\nMy interest in the Athenian democracy was triggered while I was still in high school by a lecture that I attended at UNC-Chapel Hill in the early 1960s given by Anthony Raubitschek on Athenian ostracism. And my understanding of the threats that democracy could face and the citizen efforts that could be undertaken to oppose those threats was informed by the fight against the Speaker Ban Law at Chapel Hill during my undergraduate years and by the events of the Watergate scandal.\n\nCertainly, my visceral and partially negative reaction to the reckless daring of the tyrant slayers and its destructive possibilities was influenced by my military service in the Vietnam War. The insouciance of youth could not survive sights such as the bodies of massacre victims I saw floating down the Mekong River when I rode a Swift Boat upriver into Cambodia during President Nixon’s May 1970 incursion.\n\nLt.(j.g.) Michael W. Taylor on Swift Boat going up the Mekong River in Cambodia, May 1970.\n\n1998 political campaign use of photograph above.\n\nBut my presence in Athens, Greece, on November 17, 1973, when the Junta crushed the student demonstration at the Polytechnion gave me a renewed admiration for opponents of tyranny when I witnessed uniformed officers knocking a bearded young man to the pavement and savagely beating and kicking him as the crowd began to run up Kolonaki, heard from my room at the American School the rumbling of tank treads on the streets and machine gun fire echoing across Athens during the night, and then saw the destruction at the Polytechnion and its environs the next day.\n\nI began my research in the summer of 1974 in the library of the Fogg Art Museum in trying to understand why Theseus was being depicted in the tyrannicide poses. I collected all of the vase paintings of Theseus that I could find and lined them up chronologically. This is the research work that produced Chapter 4 of my book. As it became clear to me that the dating of the shift in the portrayal of Theseus to the tyrannicide pose coincided approximately with the reforms of Ephialtes in the late 460s and the ascent of Pericles to power, I realized that I had found what I was looking for, a nexus of evidence for understanding the spirit of the Athenian democracy at its high summer. Because of the course in Greek Lyric Poetry that I had taken from Gregory Nagy, I was able to grasp early on that my basic theme had a Homeric and Nagy-ian quality to it, and was at essence about the Athenian quest for kleos aphthiton — undying fame. This is a perilous matter, it turns out. Great things can be accomplished with immense self-confidence, but reckless daring also to leads to destruction.\n\nAn enticing aspect of the subject of Harmodios and Aristogeiton was the wide variety of the evidence, literary, historical, epigraphical, numismatic, sculptural and pictoral. When I was writing my Ph.D. thesis in 1974–1975, I could find precedent for neither the multidisciplinary approach I was using perforce, due to the nature of the evidence, nor for my ideas about the tyrant slayers playing a religious role in formulating a refoundation of the Athenian state. Alan Shapiro’s review in Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. 113 (1993), pp. 211–213, complimented that approach, and I have always been grateful for that review.\n\nAs I did my research back then, I came to visualize scholars in a variety of walled-off enclosures working in his or her own field — philology, ancient history, political philosophy, archaeology, art — and his or her own set of evidence — the statues, the drinking songs and the references to them in Aristophanes, the laws about the descendants, the passages in Herodotus and Thucydides — with each scholar laboring on his or her own projects in isolation, almost as if they saw themselves as not being allowed to proceed to find the overarching meaning of their work, perhaps through a too-zealous application of time-honored narrow and restrictive customs of Classical scholarship, put in place long ago to assure the focus on detail and accuracy required for excellence in this field.\n\nAs a graduate student, I was always encouraged to view German scholarship as a great model for emulation, so when I found only a short article on the tyrant slayers in the Pauly, I realized that I might have stumbled on a piece of Greek history that had not yet been thoroughly studied, and I was off and running. It seemed to me that all of the evidence about the tyrant slayers — historical, literary, epigraphic, numismatic, sculptural and pictorial — cried out for a multidisciplinary interpretation. I felt at the very least I could make a contribution (modeled on Brunsåker’s most useful compilation of fragments of copies of the tyrannicide statue group) by collecting together in one volume citations to every historical, literary, epigraphic and visual art reference to Harmodios and Aristogeiton that I could find. And I also set out to collect vase paintings of the Labors of Theseus in an effort to understand the phenomenon of a mythological king being refigured to imitate historical democratic heroes in red figure Athenian vase painting depicting Theseus standing in the poses of the tyrannicides. My book, The Tyrant Slayers, was basically the result of asking a question — Why did Theseus appear as a tyrannicide in Athenian vase painting? — and collecting evidence to attempt to answer that question.\n\nWhere do we go from here with Harmodios and Aristogeiton? What more does the phenomenon of the tyrant slayers have to tell us about Athens — and about ourselves, about our own 21st century concepts of democracy and the state? What has been missed?\n\nIn writing this, I have the advantage of returning to Classical scholarship after an absence of more than three and a half decades while I have practiced law, been engaged in politics and, as an avocation, read the Classics and American and English history on the side along with writing and publishing books and articles about the American Civil War. I am now able to look at my work and the scholarship that uses it with a fresh perspective. The main issue that needs to be further studied, I believe, is a point I attempted to make in the original 1975 Introduction to my Ph.D. thesis that became a part of the 1981 edition of The Tyrant Slayers: the central significance of the religious (civil religious, if you will) aspect of the commemoration of Harmodios and Aristogeiton.\n\nFuture Work to Be Done on the Tyrannicides? It’s Time to “Get” Religion and Understand Propaganda\n\nDuring my first semester at Harvard in the fall of 1971, Professor Edith Porada was a visiting scholar from Columbia University. After hearing her lecture on cylinder seals, I asked her one of those first year graduate student questions, “What is the origin of art?” She proved herself to be a very kind person and answered me without scorn or irony, “Oh, art comes from religion.” (Or words to that effect, as best I can remember.) So, once again, the power of the religious experience manifests itself not just in emotions but in tangible ways through art which in turn has emotive power.\n\nIt is now approaching 150 years since Matthew Arnold recorded the “melancholy, long, withdrawing roar” of the “Sea of Faith” in his poem, “Dover Beach,” and that withdrawal seems to have accelerated. We may not be as adrift religiously as much as a character in a Douglas Coupland story in Life After God (Pocket Books, 1994), but the Coupland stories are on target enough to make many Amazon.com reviewers confess to the stories’ accuracy. In the present secular environment, it difficult for us to understand the Athenians’ religion, even 60 years after the publication of E.R. Dodds’ seminal work, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951).\n\nIt is not very surprising, then, that scholarship touching upon the tyrant slayers over the past 37 years has given little attention to the religious aspect of Harmodios and Aristogeiton, too little in my opinion. It is critically important to remember that the Athenians of the classical period were a very religious people, even when beginning to address the sometimes apparent dichotomies of faith and reason.\n\nIt may be that civil religion is in a category all by itself when it comes to producing emotions of a violent nature, perhaps because the machinery of the State is available to those so emoted so that they can sometimes wreak vast swathes of destruction. One has only to think of film footage of torchlit Nazi rallies at Nuremburg to understand the extremes to which those emotions can be taken. The images of civil religion, like those of Harmodios and Aristogeiton, can seem to elevate when they actually serve to soften and even falsify our understanding and memory of the horrors of war and violence.\n\nA central postulate of my 1975 Harvard Ph.D. thesis on the tyrant slayers was that it was Pericles who seized upon Harmodios and Aristogeiton as a central symbol of the radical Athenian democracy that he led in putting forward, beginning around 460 B.C.E. It seems that Pericles, as a brilliant politician, understood the importance of propaganda in a democracy.\n\nIn an incisive analysis very pertinent to the Athenian democracy’s symbolic uses of Harmodios and Aristogeiton, Ellul says:\n\nWithin Athens and as an adjunct to compulsion within the Athenian Empire, propaganda was critically important to the execution of the policies of Pericles. In Harmodios and Aristogeiton, I would contend, Pericles found an ideal focus for his propaganda. The question must be whether Pericles used this propaganda for democratic or anti-democratic purposes.\n\nPericlean Athens and American Democracy\n\nThe 19th century rise in popularity of a beneficent view of the Greek polis was reflected in Greek Revival architecture and the establishment of the first professorial chair in Greek at Harvard in 1817, filled by Edward Everett in 1819, followed by Yale’s chair in Greek established in 1831 and filled by Theodore Woolsey. Both Everett and Woolsey later became President of their respective universities.\n\nHarvard Greek Professor and President Edward Everett was influential in several areas including the American movement that began in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts to make cemeteries into something like parks or nature preserves. Everett’s most famous moment came in November 1863 at the dedication of the national cemetery at Gettysburg, where he referred to Pericles’ Funeral Oration and spoke for two hours before Lincoln gave his immortal “brief remarks,” known to history as the Gettysburg Address.\n\nAlthough the image of Pericles shifted to a more beneficent one as the 18th century wore into the 19th, the history of the American Civil War and subsequent conflicts shows that propaganda — which I believe Pericles wielded very effectively — has become only more prevalent, with its practitioners more skilled and, as a result, propaganda is even more dangerous than it ever was. Modern events, especially wars which call for especially intensive propaganda efforts, offer useful historical analogies for the study of the Classical period in Athens in general and of the motivating emotions offered by the tyrant slayers in particular.\n\nThe tyrant slayers offer a fruitful subject for understanding the uses and abuses of propaganda, particularly with civil religious overtones, and the striking parallels with modern American and European history can inform our understanding of both periods of history and of our own present situation, besieged as we are with propagandizing messages pouring in over the air waves.\n\nDemocratic propaganda and the battlefields of the American Civil War\n\nThe State with a sword summons to war a student who drops his books.

The use of myth as propaganda played an important role in mobilizing the British, French and American democracies for war — in much the same way as Pericles’ use of propaganda did nearly 2400 years earlier\n\nThe psychic need of the British public for mythic inspiration and identification is shown by the birth of the legend of the “Angels of Mons” from a fictional newspaper account of the appearance of English bowmen from the battle of Agincourt appearing at the August 1914 battle of Mons to strike down the advancing German hordes.\n\nThe Bowmen of Mons come to the aid of the British and cause havoc among their enemies. Image courtesy of the Mary Evans Picture Library (no. 10024251).\n\nThe problem with the portrayal of the soldier as a “type of Christ” is that the experience of the trenches did not fit in with any traditional Christian framework.\n\nFrance was secular by official policy in 1914–1918, and the masses fighting at the Front, along with their families back home, were left to struggle to find a mythic consolatory framework sufficient to bear the weight of hundreds of thousands of dead. In secular France, some Catholics persisted in a strong commitment to traditional Christian beliefs, which required tortured logic to support the fighting in the trenches and to find meaning in wounds and death there. A young Catholic seminarian serving in an infantry unit, later killed in action in 1918, expressed this sort of sentiment in a January 1, 1915, letter, characterizing his wounds as a joyful sacrifice for the rechristianization of France.\n\nA French departure trench just before zero hour.

That awaits review on another day. Suffice it to say that, like Wilfred Owen and Isaac Rosenberg, many of the best British poets of the Second World War such as Keith Douglas (1920–1944), Alun Lewis (1915–1944) and Sidney Keyes (1922–1943) perished in the War. The simple and direct violence of Keith Douglas’ “How to Kill,” written in North Africa in 1943 expresses a literary ethic shorn of attempts to revive older traditions.\n\nIn World War I poetry, soldiers die, being sacrificed as a type of Christ, which gives redemptive meaning to their deaths. In World War II poetry, this is no longer true. War is death and violence without redemptive purpose, resulting in horrible deaths like that of Randall Jarrell’s ball turret gunner who is poured out of the ball turret a dead wet mess — born again dead, as it were, in a new and terrible age — and the death of the German or Italian at the other end of Keith Douglas’s rifle shot in “How to Kill,” written by a soldier who must have known his own death might be so described by an enemy shooter.\n\nPericles: What does all this mythmaking and propagandizing have to teach us about the Tyrant Slayers, Pericles and Athens during the Pentecontaetia?\n\nArendt’s approach is perhaps explicable by an almost desperate search for that which was hopeful and good in human affairs following the Holocaust and her great admiration for the public space of the Greek polis.\n\nWhat does the historical example of Pericles and Athens during the Pentecontaetia teach us about the present and future of America?\n\nEffective use of propaganda by the leader of a democratic state might be viewed as simply the construction of a dike or levy to keep the stream of fortune within its banks, as recommended by Machiavelli in The Prince. However, propaganda, as Jacques Ellul so insightfully pointed out, turns into a totalitarian tool when it moves from opinion to myth making. Remember the key principle: A democracy is based on opinion, not belief. Once blind acceptance on faith of articles of a political creed is sold to the citizenry, as opposed to the responsibility of each citizen to develop his or her own opinion, democracy moves toward totalitarianism in the hands of those who dictate the beliefs.\n\nToday in America, many are trying to sound the alarm, but vast tides of money pouring out propaganda over the airwaves are drowning out the alarms. Our mechanisms of propaganda are now under the control of the very rich after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 50, 130 S.Ct. 876 (2010). The parallels with ancient Athens are shockingly similar. The Oligarchs now control the airwaves, a situation that would have been very familiar to Greeks in the archaic period. Although they knew nothing about airwaves and electronic propaganda, they would have recognized what is happening to us.\n\nI believe that Thucydides’ point of view about democracy is not that far from Arendt’s. The tyrannicide story was unpalatable to Thucydides because it enshrined reckless daring as an ideal — and that the reckless daring of heroes. It wasn’t given to Thucydides to understand the attraction of the emotional power of the “passionate enthusiasm” that Harmodios and Aristogeiton portrayed without which the Golden Age of Athens might never have occurred, but I believe that the example of the tyrant slayers had a powerful effect in classical Athens upon those who could and did understand the attraction of their example.\n\nHarmodios and Aristogeiton had come to represent two contradictory aspects of the civil religious spirit by the late 5th century. Thucydides clearly lacked sympathy for Harmodios and Aristogeiton. Looking back across the years of Athens’ Golden Age to the death of Hipparchus, Thucydides could see no positive influence, no beneficial effect on Athens produced by Harmodios and Aristogeiton and their story. I think it is important to take very seriously the analysis of the reporter on the scene who in this case is Thucydides. And Thucydides was right in some ways; he was right that national mythology must be taken with a large grain of salt, for a nation misunderstands — and misuses — its own history at its own peril. But he was also wrong, because he fails to recognize that the mythologization of national history may be inevitable in the creation of a civic religion that binds a nation together. Harmodios and Aristogeiton can be said to embody the spirit of 5th Century Athens, the essence, the reckless daring, of the whole classical enterprise. But at the same time, however, Harmodios and Aristogeiton represent something mighty dangerous: freedom. And freedom won with violence. An intoxicating and very dangerous elixir indeed. The outcome may be desirable, but the cost, it must be remembered, is very high: reckless daring may at one moment lead to a period of exciting advances in society, but to that society’s destruction at another.\n\nAll students at Harvard come to contemplate the fact that the University’s great research library, Widener, is named after a young man who died on the Titanic by his mother in her grief, a meditation on the brevity of life and on what wealth can and cannot accomplish. But it is perhaps more the grim paintings of the World War I dead in Widener Library’s central stairwell that caused me as a student climbing the steps to study there to stop and think about the two-edged power and peril of ideas. And this contemplation has relevance extending beyond the concerns of the Academy. Thucydides drew a parallel and even a causal connection between the two-edged peril of the tyrant slayers’ reckless daring, and the reckless daring of the imperially minded Athenians during the Peloponnesian War. The same parallel suggests itself between Athens and the United States. Just as it was only natural to believe in Athenian exceptionalism after the Persian Wars, it was only natural to believe in American exceptionalism, especially after we stood astride the world following World War II and then following the fall of the Soviet Union. The reckless daring of the tyrant slayers in 514 B.C.E. had eventually led to great things, and seemed worthy of emulation. And yet, it took only the leadership of the morally flawed Alcibiades and the reckless overreach of the Sicilian Expedition for Athens to be fatally weakened.\n\nA note of thanks\n\nI want to thank University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill doctoral candidate in Classics Sarah Miller for her strenuous efforts as my research assistant over the past two years in preparing this article. She assembled the scholarship citing The Tyrant Slayers and has been extremely helpful in critiquing my writing and ideas. She is a very bright young scholar, and I predict great things for her. Sarah’s husband, John Esposito, likewise a UNC doctoral candidate in Classics has also been very helpful with useful suggestions. UNC doctoral candidate in Classical Archaeology Rebecca Worsham has also generously given her time in reading and discussing my manuscript, pointing out typographic errors and making suggestions. It has been a pleasure to work with these three fine young scholars. Donald Haggis, UNC Nicholas A. Cassas Term Professor of Greek Studies, Professor, Curriculum in Archaeology, and Emily Baragwanath, UNC Assistant Professor of Classics, each took the time to read my manuscript in much earlier stages and make suggestions. I am afraid that Professor Baragwanath will chide me a little for not discussing Herodotus, but I have to confess that I just ran out of time. And Douglas Frame also took time to read earlier versions of my manuscript and make suggestions for future directions as I went along. I owe a debt of thanks to Eric Ashley Hairston, Associate Professor of English and of Law and Humanities, and Director, Center for Law and Humanities, Elon University, for reading several drafts of this article, making useful suggestions, and helping me keep my eyes on important issues. I also want to thank Brendan Boyle, Assistant Professor of Classics at UNC-Chapel Hill, for taking the time to read and comment on a draft of this article and to meet with me to talk about it. I must emphasize that all decisions about the direction my article has taken and all emphases in it are solely my own. Finally, I want to thank my wife, Susan, for her patience as I have spent many evenings and weekends researching and writing this article, not to mention living through with me for 35 years of marriage the experiences on which much of it is based.\n\nAn autobiographical note\n\nThe reader may better understand what I have written through learning some details of my own life and family background. I am proud to have served my country and proud of my family’s record of service. We are certainly not unique. There are many families like mine in our country with a long tradition of citizen military service. I stand seventh in a line of eldest sons, and my sole badge of that office is a straight razor, given to me by my father by family custom, that belonged to William Taylor who, by family tradition, served in the American Revolution. William Taylor’s son, Lorenzo J. Taylor died fighting Sherman as an officer of the Georgia Militia in 1864, and Lorenzo’s son, my great-great grandfather, Edwin J. Taylor, served in the Confederate Army, was wounded in the battle of Jerusalem Plank Road south of Petersburg, VA, in June 1864 and was surrendered at Appomattox Court House, VA, by General Robert E. Lee. In 1917 when the United States entered World War I, my paternal grandfather was a married Baptist preacher with a child and another on the way, but one of his brothers, my great uncle, R. Clarence Taylor, served in France with the A.E.F. My father served as a Signal Corps Officer attached to the headquarters of MacArthur’s 5th Air Force in New Guinea and the Philippines in World War II, surviving a Japanese kamikaze attack in November 1944 on the USS Alpine as it was anchored off Leyte Island in preparation for debarkation and a Japanese paratroop attack on the airfield at Burauen on Leyte in December 1944. I served in Vietnam, and two of my children, one a graduate of Harvard and the other a graduate of UNC served in the Iraq War.\n\nMy father taught me one simple lesson: If you live in this country and enjoy her benefits, you have a duty to serve her. I understand the motto of the Black Prince: Ich dien. From that commitment proceeds what my ancestor’s commander said in his farewell to his soldiers at Appomattox: “You take with you the satisfaction that proceeds from duty faithfully performed.” But wherein lies duty? Aye, there’s the rub, and it should be a matter of opinion and not of belief.\n\nFive years ago, my wife, my youngest son, and I journeyed back to places where I had been in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam 37 years before. We returned to a spot on the bank of a river named Song Cai Be which American sailors called the Snake (due to its sinuosity) southeast of Rach Gia near the northern edge of the U Minh Forest. Thirty-seven years before, nearly to the day, as a field historian accompanying a PBR operation, I witnessed close up a very loud and violent encounter between the local Viet Cong, American personnel on the PBRs and American helicopters. Five years ago, when I returned, I sat down and drank a cup of chai with Mr. Lam Son who had been the local VC commander back in 1970. He was one year younger than me. He was reserved, but friendly after all these years. A few days before our 1970 mission, the American sailors had lost a PBR holed by a rocket. I asked Mr. Lam Son about that, and he said, “I fired the rocket.” We were left to contemplate what those events of long ago and our respective places in them had meant to two young men, now not so young.\n\nBibliography\n\nClassical Athens\n\nBadian, E. 1993.
