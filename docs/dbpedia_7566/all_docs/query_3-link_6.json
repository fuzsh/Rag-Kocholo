        "text": "Fort Collins, city, seat (1868) of Larimer county, northern Colorado, U.S. It lies along the Cache la Poudre River (the state’s “Trout Route”), in the eastern foothills of the Front Range, at an elevation of 5,004 feet (1,525 metres), 55 miles (89 km) north of Denver. The community developed after 1864 around a military outpost named for its commander, Lieutenant William O. Collins of Fort Laramie, Wyoming. The outpost was abandoned in 1872, but the settlement remained and, promoted by a town development company, grew with the arrival of the railroad and a highly successful sugar beet industry based on local irrigation and stimulated by a land-grant college (now Colorado State University) established there in 1870.\n\nThe contemporary city has large lamb-feeding operations and agricultural and quarry-based industries supplemented by tourism and light and high-technology manufactures. The Fort Collins Museum (founded as Pioneer Museum in 1941) preserves in its courtyard the first settler’s cabin and two other historic structures, and it houses mementos of the fort. A portion of the original city centre, including the Avery House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fort Collins is the headquarters of the Roosevelt National Forest, a few miles west; the Pawnee National Grassland is to the east. Inc. 1883. Pop. (2010) 143,986; Fort Collins–Loveland Metro Area, 299,630; (2020) 169,810; Fort Collins Metro Area, 359,066."
