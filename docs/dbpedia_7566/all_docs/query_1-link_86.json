        "text": "Brigadier General (Ret.) John Sherman Crow passed away on April 7, 2024 in Natchez, Mississippi, after a prolonged battle with cancer. He was the proud 49th Colonel of the Blackhorse Regiment and Past President of the Blackhorse Association. There are not enough words, nor words large enough, to capture what General Crow has meant to the Blackhorse Regiment and its Association. He was the epitome of a concerned cavalry leader, and he truly loved the Regiment and its troopers. He was one of a few who in 2006 worked hard to save the then-failing Blackhorse Association; he became its president and during his term with the help of a few others, brought it back to financial stability. During his time in Fulda as Regimental Commander, General Crow passionately led and endeared himself to his troops with a unique loyalty that exists today. He will be greatly missed and will be a popular guest with his fellow troopers at Fiddler’s Green. Before he passed away, General Crow wrote his own obituary: Brig. General (Retired) John Sherman Crow passed away peacefully after a brief battle with cancer. He was 87 years old. He loved to tell the story of his extraordinary family life. “As I go through life and tell of my family of 14 children, 31 grandchildren, and 36 great-grandchildren, people are in awe. I readily tell them of my Crow children, my Sims Crow children, my Jones Crow children, and my Beard Crow children. And, what I tell them is that the greatest blessing of my life is the love and respect given to me by each and every one of them. I have no words that appropriately describe the depth of love I have for each of you except to say, Thank You for allowing me to be a part of your lives.” He was preceded in death by his mother, Louise Townsend; his father, Robbie Crow; his first wife, Dinky Flanagan; his third wife, Pat Sims; his fourth wife, Frances Jones; his sister, Brenda Crow Hobson; his daughter, Becky Jones LeBlanc (Mike); and his son, Dr. John Johnston Jones, Jr. (Frankie). He is survived by his wife, Virginia Beard; daughters Lisa Crow, Linny Crow, Marcia Sims Solis (Tony), Melanie Sims Crowson (Neville), Lydia Jones Goulas (Danny), Wendy Jones Murrian (Todd), Frances Jones Roman (Roger), and Susan Beard Calhoun (Jesse); sons Chris Sims (Michelle), Ben Jones (Mollie), Tim Jones, and Bret Beard (Marla); 31 grandchildren, and 36 great- grandchildren. John Sherman had a long and exciting military career in the U.S. Army highlighted by his command of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the “Blackhorse Regiment,” in Fulda, Germany. John Sherman seldom spoke of his Army exploits but often spoke of his love and respect of the thousands of young men he was honored to serve with in his beloved Blackhorse Regiment Family as their 49th Colonel. General Crow was the 2012 recipient of the Order of Saint George Gold Medallion, Cavalry and Armor’s most prestigious award. He is a decorated combat veteran with multiple combat tours in Vietnam. Many will remember then-Colonel Crow in a 1980 CBS “60 Minutes” interview with Mike Wallace while he commanded the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (Blackhorse) in Fulda, Germany. He wished to offer a special thanks to Dr. Daly, Dr. Hollier, Dr. Musa, and Dr. Cataldo for their care and professional attention during his illness. There will be a service of Christian burial with interment to follow on June 1, 2024, 1 p.m., at Christ Church Cemetery in Bastrop, Louisiana. Honorary pallbearers are Joe Sutton, Glenn Snodgrass, Bill Hutton, Jerry Weyland, Dale Lawless, Bobby Bell, Steve Rippe, Joe Eszes, Dan Monahan, John Stephens, Dave Cowan, Doc Bahnsen, Scott Tuck, Wes Walters, John Rosenberger, Tom Millikin, Jerry Johns, Greg Hallmark, and Mark Neukom.

He is a decorated combat veteran having served multiple tours in Vietnam. He was the 2012 recipient of the Order of Saint George Gold Medallion, one of Cavalry and Armor’s most prestigious awards.
