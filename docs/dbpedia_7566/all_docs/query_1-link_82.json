        "text": "Ninth President of the United States William H. Harrison.\n\nPainting by Chet Jezierski for the National Guard Bureau Presidential Series\n\n1811\"Prophet Town\" near the Tippecanoe River, Indiana - While England and America would not actually go to war until 1812, there was trouble between the Indians (stirred up by the British) and frontier families before hostilities became formalized. The Governor of the Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, who acted also as a general of militia, commanded an army numbering about 1,000 militiamen as they approach the stronghold of the Shawnee war chief Tecumseh and his brother, a mystic known as the \"Prophet.\" The Prophet foretold of the defeat of the Americans which would force the whites back east away from tribal lands. Tecumseh and his brother used this vision to build a confederacy of mid-western tribes. It was part of this group, gathered at \"Prophet Town\" that Harrison set out to destroy. However, on this date the American camp was attacked by the Prophet before Harrison reached his goal. After an inconclusive battle in which both sides claimed victory, the Indians withdrew leaving the Americans to burn the town. Tecumseh was away and took no part in the engagement but high losses among the Indians did weaken the confederacy. Harrison had 190 men killed or wounded, nearly 20% of his force. In his report he claimed a great victory which he later used as part of his 1840 presidential campaign slogan \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too!\" (\"Tyler\" was John Tyler, who was a captain of a rifle company in the Virginia militia during the War of 1812). Tecumseh and Harrison would later face each other in battle, first at Fort Meigs, OH, in May 1813 and then at the Battle of the Thames River in Canada in October 1813. At this engagement, Tecumseh was killed and the confederacy died with him.\n\nMembers of the 168th Infantry (Iowa) prepare a machine gun position at a U.S. airfield in Algeria soon after their successful landings on this date.\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration\n\n1942Algeria - As part of Operation TORCH, the 168th Infantry (IA), 34th Infantry Division (IA, MN, ND, SD) makes an assault landing on the coast of this French colony but meets little resistance as it seizes both the port and the airfield. The colony is controlled by the Vichy French government, a puppet regime under the power of Adolf Hitler. While some French officers try to lead their men in resisting the American landing, most of their troops decide to join the Allies against the hated Nazis. By January 1943 the balance of the 34th has landed and is moving across North Africa but encounters fierce opposition from the vaunted German Afrika Corps in Tunisia. Once the Germans are defeated and the African campaign ends in May, the division prepares itself for its next mission, the invasion of Italy. After making another assault landing at Salerno on September 9th, it spends the rest of the war slogging its way up the Italian ‘boot,' ending the war northwest of Milan. The 34th is credited with 535 days in contact with the enemy, one of the highest number of days in combat of any division in the Army. It had nine members awarded the Medal of Honor and suffered 14,895 total causalities (killed, wounded and missing).\n\nMany of the Guard observation squadrons, including Wisconsin's 126th, at the time of mobilization in 1940 were flying North American O-47B photo-reconnaissance aircraft. By current standards in the European war, these were obsolete but they remained in service until late in the war, being used for coastal anti-submarine patrols. Besides being camera-equipped each was capable of carrying up to 500 pounds of bombs or one depth charge to attack submarines.\n\nNational Guard Education Foundation\n\n1940Milwaukee, Wisconsin - As war raged in Europe and the very real possibility that the U.S. might be attacked was present in most people's minds, the Army authorized the organization of seven new observation squadrons in the National Guard, even as Guard units are being mobilized for their one year of ‘emergency' training in case of war. On this date the 126th Observation Squadron receives federal recognition at Milwaukee. It was organized and commanded by Major Paul Meyers, the first American aviator in World War I to receive the French Croix de Guerre (Cross of War) Medal for valor in combat. The unit flew obsolete North American O-47B observation aircraft. Unlike prewar observation squadrons, the 126th was not assigned to a Guard division, rather it was assigned directly in support of the II Army Corps and performed various duties, including photographing portions of the Carolina Maneuvers in the autumn of 1941. During the war it served in a photographic reconnaissance role in the European Theater as part of the 9th Air Force and XII Tactical Air Command. After the war the 126th was first reorganized as a fighter squadron, but in 1962 it had a change of mission, converting to an aerial refueling unit flying the KC-97 Stratofreighter until, in 1977, they were reequipped with the KC-135 Stratotanker.\n\nOne of the defenders of Savannah was Lieutenant James Thompson of the 5th Georgia Infantry. His unit fought several delaying actions trying to stop General Sherman from taking the city, but to no availablel.\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration\n\n1864San Francisco, CA - The \"great\" earthquake strikes this morning. Within hours large portions of the city not already destroyed by the quake itself are consumed in massive, uncontrollable fires. Almost immediately the 2nd Brigade, National Guard of California, under the command of Brigadier General John A. Koster, is called up for state active duty to assist in security. The brigade consisted of one battalion of coast artillery, two troops of cavalry, three infantry regiments and one signal company. However, since many of the members of these units live in the areas affected by the quake they failed to show up, so other California Guardsmen from areas spared damage were brought in. So many men served at least some term of service, and the funds used to pay and feed them totaled nearly $400,000, that the state adjutant general reported to the Chief, National Guard Bureau that summer camp for some units of the CA NG was cancelled for 1906. Looting got so bad that the mayor issued a controversial degree allowing military and police authorities to shoot to kill any looters resisting arrest. Several looters, person's actually attacking soldiers (usually found to be drunk) or in other ways causing \"trouble\" were shot by Guardsmen. The Guard remained on duty until finally released on June 2nd.\n\n\"Trail-Blazers in The Sky\" showing the successful return of the 1st Aero Squadron back to Mineola.\n\nPainting by Woodi Ishmael for the National Guard Bureau Heritage Series\n\n1916Mineola, New York - Ten JN-4 \"Jennies\" bi-wing aircraft lift off to undertake a historic flight, becoming the first multi-plane organization to fly a cross-country course totaling about 200 miles. They land in Princeton, NJ, and then return to Mineola the next morning, arriving to find fog and low clouds, however all the planes land safely. Starting just six years after the Wright Brothers made their first flight at Kitty Hawk, NC, in 1903 several Guardsmen in different states started bringing their personal airplanes to drill to teach flying to their comrades. However, it was not until July 16, 1916 that the first National Guard flying unit received federal recognition. New York's 1st Aero Squadron, commanded by Captain Raynal Bolling, an early flight pioneer, made this nationally recognized flight. In 1917 the unit enters active duty for World War I, but never sees combat, being disbanded with its pilots sent to France as individuals. Bolling himself would die in the war, killed not in a \"dog fight\" against a German airplane but rather in a pistol fight with an enemy officer after Bolling's car was ambushed while near the Front. Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, DC, is named for this Guard aviator.\n\nMajor Charles Watters as a captain in New Jersey's 108th Tactical Fighter Wing.\n\nNational Guard Education Foundation\n\n1967Dak To, Vietnam - Many people assume that to earn the Medal of Honor a soldier must kill a large number of the enemy or capture some strategic position. But a look through the records uncovers men who were awarded the Medal for giving of themselves to save the lives of their comrades. Chaplain/Major Charles J. Watters was one such case. Growing up in New Jersey he was ordained a priest and taught Indian children on a reservation school in Arizona before returning home. In 1962 he joined the 108th Tactical Fighter Wing, New Jersey Air National Guard. As a first lieutenant he ministered during drill periods and made himself available during off-duty hours to help individuals needing religious comfort. While he enjoyed his time with the 108th the war in Vietnam was growing in intensity. By 1965 he felt a calling to minister to men suffering the stress of combat. Now a major, he volunteered his services to the Army for duty in Vietnam. The Army gladly accepted though he was reduced to the rank of captain. Watters became jump qualified and was assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade, taking part in its first wartime jump in Vietnam. On this date he accompanied Company A, 173rd Support Battalion when it launched an air assault near Dak To. As soon as the paratroopers landed they came under intense enemy fire and the number of wounded men rose sharply. Watters repeatedly ran out in front of his unit's lines to carry back the wounded. Despite pleas from his men the chaplain kept moving between the lines unconcerned by the bullets flying around him. After the company pulled back into a defensive position he again ventured out into \"no man's land\" three times bring in more wounded. While giving water to the injured he was killed by enemy fire. For his selfless caring of others and the saving of several American lives Chaplain/Major Watters was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He is buried on \"Chaplain's Hill\" in Arlington National Cemetery. To further honor his life members of the 108th established a fund in his name to assist Indian children in Arizona.\n\nAstronaut Charles \"Pete\" Conrad\n\nNational Guardsman, September 1965\n\n1969Ocean of Storms, Moon - Apollo 12's lunar module, \"Intrepid\", touches down safely. Under the command of Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, Jr., the only former Guardsman to ever make it to the lunar surface, this is the second manned mission to the Moon. Unlike the other six former Guardsmen turned astronauts during the Apollo program, Conrad had no Air Guard background. Instead he had been a member of the Pennsylvania Army Guard's 103rd Reconnaissance Troop prior to entering Annapolis and beginning a Navy flying career. Conrad had one of the longest records of space travel prior to the shuttle program, logging a total of 22-days. He flew on two Gemini missions and after Apollo 12 he was the commander of the first Skylab II mission, NASA's first space station. On this Moon mission, he and his partner, Allen Bean, collected rocks, set up scientific experiments and removed the camera to return to Earth from Surveyor 3 which had landed on the Moon in 1967. For his outstanding achievements NASA awarded him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, the only former Guardsman ever to receive this recognition. He died in a motorcycle accident in 1999.\n\nCompanies of 3rd Battalion, 369th Infantry, under the command of Major L'Esperence, marching through Ungersheim, Alsace, on their way to the Balgau on the Rhine. Alsace was traditionally a French province, captured and annexed by the Germans after the 1870 Franco-Prussian War; its population greeted the African Americans with great was enthusiasm\n\nArmy Heritage and Education Center\n\n1918Balgau, on the Rhine River, Germany - The 369th Infantry, the famed \"Hell Fighters from Harlem\" becomes the first American unit to enter German territory following the November 11th armistice ending the fighting of World War I. The 369th was one of three African American infantry regiments organized from existing pre-war black Guard units. Before the war it was designated as the 15th New York Infantry. When America entered World War I the Army had no plan to use black soldiers but it had three existing African American regiments. Given the racist feeling of the time the Army leadership did not want to inter-mix black soldiers into whites-only units and vice versa so they offered the use of the black troops to the French Army, which gladly accepted their service. The three black Guard regiments, each incorporated into three different French divisions, proved their courage in numerous battlefield actions, especially during the Meuse-Argonne offensive which ended the war. The commander of the French 161st Division, to which the 369th was assigned, selected the black soldiers to be the first Allied troops in his section of the Rhineland to take up occupation duties on German territory. This was a great honor and the black Guardsmen knew it. They marched in proud to represent their regiment and nation in front of the scared German populace. Soon, however, the Germans realized they had nothing to fear from the Americans and relaxed, often welcoming the black soldiers into their homes and shops. In fact, in February 1919, as the 369th prepared to return home, the local people held a feast in their honor.\n\nThe statue of General Hugh Mercer in Fredericksburg, VA.\n\n1758Fort Duquesne (today Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania - English General John Forbes, leading a mixed force of British regulars and colonial militia, captures the smoldering remains of Fort Duquesne after the French and their Indian allies fled rather than defend the position. Renaming the ruins \"Pittsbourgh\" (after the then British Prime Minister, William Pitt) Forbes departs, accompanied by his American military advisor, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington of the Virginia Regiment, to return to Philadelphia. He leaves Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Mercer with a battalion of the Pennsylvania Regiment (colonists, mostly with militia backgrounds, who volunteered to become full-time soldiers in the pay of their colony) to rebuild a new fort, to be named \"Fort Pitt.\" This soon became a key starting point for expeditions west into the Ohio territory and beyond. While Washington's record in later years is well known, Mercer too played an important role in the Revolution. Born in Scotland, he came to America after taking part in the failed Scottish revolt of 1745. A doctor he first settled in Pennsylvania and commanded his local militia regiment, later assuming his position with the Pennsylvania Regiment. After the French and Indian War he moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia and set up a medical practice. He soon became a good and trusted friend of Washington. Still retaining strong anti-English feelings he quickly embraced the American cause during the Revolution. But rather than acting in his medical capacity, he accepted command of the 3rd Virginia Regiment of the Continental Army. Due to both his friendship with Washington and actual battlefield talent he was promoted to brigade command in time for the Battle of Princeton in January 1777. He was killed in this battle, but his men captured a British regiment and caused another to flee, giving Washington the victory. His death was greatly mourned by Washington and many historians have speculated on the influence he might have had on American history had he lived. .\n\nSergeant Joseph Farinholt firing his 57mm anti tank gun before leaving to warn his headquarters of the Germany attack.\n\nA painting by Larry Selman for the National Guard Bureau Heritage Series\n\n1944Bourheim, Germany - Technical Sergeant Joseph A. Farinholt, a Guardsman from Baltimore, MD, was a member of the anti-tank platoon of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Battalion, 175th Infantry (MD), 29th Infantry Division (DC, MD, VA) when he earned a fourth Silver Star on this day by single-handedly destroying a German tank and other actions despite being severely wounded. Farinholt joined the 175th in August 1940 and was mobilized with the 29th Division when it entered active duty in February 1941. His regiment landed on Omaha Beach on June 7, 1944 (one day after D-Day), and immediately entered into combat operations. During the next five and half months Farinholt fought in every engagement involving the 29th as it moved across France and into Germany. Along the way, for various acts of valor in combat he was awarded three Silver Stars for bravery including: risking his life to get close enough to use a bazooka to destroy an enemy tank; exposing himself to incoming fire to rescue at least four injured men, moving them to safety; and leading a nighttime sortie behind enemy lines to retrieve equipment abandoned when their position was overrun earlier that day. On this date the 175th Infantry was spread thin around the outer perimeter of the town of Bourheim, which they had captured three days earlier. For the fourth time in those three days, a German armored column would attempt to break through this front to recapture the town, a key to their defense of the strategic city of Julich on the Roer River. The enemy attack opened with such an intense artillery barrage that the 29th Division's After Action Report cites as it as \".the worst suffered by the division during the war.\" Then the German infantry and their supporting tanks pushed forward. Men in the outlaying areas fell back toward the town and it looked as though the enemy might finally break through. However, Farinholt, the ranking member of his 3-gun, 57mm towed anti-tank gun section, quickly went into action. His crew, after firing several rounds at the enemy, all became casualties when an German shell hit a tree near their position. Farinholt loaded and fired an additional round, striking the tread of the lead Tiger tank, disabling it. However, the tank returned fire with armor-piercing machine gun shells, hitting the 57mm gun at least 20 times, wounding Farinholt in multiple areas of his body, most seriously in his right leg and foot. Despite his wounds he managed to climb into a jeep and drive to the battalion headquarters to alert its leaders of the direction and strength of the German attack. Because of his wound he could not use the clutch and brake pedals so he hit the building the headquarters was housed in. Immediately a medic started to apply first aid but Farinholt refused until he was able to report to the battalion commander. Once he made his report, he finally allowed himself to receive medical treatment. Unknown to him at this time, due to the rate and accuracy of fire from his platoon, the Germans advance was stalled for almost an hour and then diverted to another sector, buying more time for the 29th Division to move troops and summon air support to successfully stop the attack. The Germans never recaptured Bourheim. For his bravery and determination to alert headquarters of impending danger, Farinholt was awarded his fourth Silver Star for his actions at Bourheim, thus becoming the only enlisted man in World War II to earn four Silver Stars. His wounds were so severe that he was returned home, and though he lived nearly 60 more years, he never fully recovered from his injuries."
