        "text": "The 8th Regiment of Cavalry, Illinois Volunteers: Member Unit of the Division Cavalry Brigade, and the 1st Federal Division, a partner in the Blue-Gray Alliance.\n\nThe 8th Regiment of Illinois Volunteer Cavalry was reactivated by Illinois Governor Daniel Walker for the 1976 United States Bicentennial celebration. The Regiment has since been active as one of the Midwest's premiere Mounted and Dismounted Cavalry reenacting groups. We are located in northern Illinois and have had members from Wisconsin, Iowa, and Indiana.\n\nIn addition to the many Civil War reenactments we attend, we also participate in parades, living histories, school presentations, and memorial ceremonies. Our objective is to portray the highly trained 8th Illinois Cavalry in military drills, battle tactics, and camp life. We strive to provide the best impression to explain the role of Federal Cavalry in the Civil War.\n\nThe troopers provide their own reproduction uniforms and equipment. Mounted, dismounted, and civilian impressions are welcome.\n\nWe make every effort to provide a fun and wholesome atmosphere for the whole family.\n\nIf you would like to have the 8th Illinois Cavalry at your next reenactment, classroom, or parade, or would like additional information on joining the 8th, please contact us, and please follow us on Facebook.\n\nPresident and Field Commander: Garth Kisel; Secretary/Treasurer Don McArthur-Self\n\nThe 8th Illinois is a proud partner of the Camp Kane Heritage Foundation."
