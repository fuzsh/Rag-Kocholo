        "text": "The 11th NC Regiment was the successor of the 1st NC Volunteers, the Bethel Regiment. This latter was mustered into service for six months and upon its disbandment was re-organized for the war as the 11th NC Regiment, which was composed in considerable degree of the material of the Bethel Regiment. [The history of the 1st NC Volunteers contradicts this statement, asserting that very few men and officers of the Bethel Regiment were actually incorporated into the new 11th NC Regiment.]\n\nThe re-organization took place at Camp Mangum, near Raleigh, on March 31, 1862, by the election of Collett Leventhorpe as Colonel; William A. Owens as Lt. Colonel; and William A. Eliason as Major. Maj. Eliason was at the same time elected to the Lt. Colonelcy of the 49th NC Regiment, and accepted it, and Captain William J. Martin, of the 28th NC Regiment, was elected Major in his stead, and was promoted Lt. Colonel on May 6th, when Lt. Colonel Owens was elected Colonel of the 53rd NC Regiment. At the same time, on May 6th, Captain Egbert A. Ross, of Company A, was promoted to Major.\n\nThe regiment, therefore, went into service early in May of 1862, among the troops for the defense of Wilmington, with the following organization:\n\nCol. Collett Leventhorpe, Lt. Col. William J. Martin, Maj. Egbert A. Ross, Surgeon John Wilson, Assistant Surgeon J. Parks McCombs, Assistant Quartermaster John M. Tate, Assistant Commissary of Subsistence Patrick J. Lowrie, Adjutant Henderson C. Lucas, and Chaplain Aristides S. Smith.\n\nCompany ACapt. William L. Hand of Mecklenburg County; 1st Lt. Charles W. Alexander; 2nd Lt. Robert H. Hand and 2nd Lt. William B. Taylor; Sgt. R. B. Alexander was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant to fill a vacancy.\n\nCompany BCapt. Mark D. Armfield of Burke County; 1st Lt. Thomas Parks; 2nd Lt. Elisha W. Dorsey and 2nd Lt. Portland A. Warlick. Capt. Armfield was wounded and taken prisoner at Gettysburg and died at Johnson's Island in Ohio. 1st Lt. Thomas Parks was promoted to Captain, 2nd Lt. Elisha W. Dorsey was promoted to 1st Lieutenant, and private J. L. Warlick was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nCompany CCapt. Francis W. Bird of Bertie County; 1st Lt. Thomas W. Cooper; 2nd Lt. Edward R. Outlaw and 2nd Lt. Edward A. Rhodes. Capt. Francis W. Bird was promoted to Major on July 1, 1863. 1st Lt. Thomas W. Cooper was killed at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, and 2nd Lt. Edward R. Outlaw was promoted to Captain. 2nd Lt. Edward A. Rhodes was also killed at Gettysburg and Corporal William H. Todd was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and Duncan C. Winston was promoted from the ranks to 2nd Lieutenant. 1st Lieutenant William H. Todd was killed near Petersburg on April 2, 1865.\n\nCompany DCapt. Calvin S. Brown of Burke County; 1st Lt., William J. Kincaid; 2nd Lt. Louis Elias and 2nd Lt. J. M. Tate. Capt. Calvin S. Brown resigned on January 7, 1864 and 1st Lt. William J. Kincaid was promoted to Captain and 2nd Lt. Louis Elias was promoted to 1st Lieutenant. 2nd Lt. J. M. Tate was promoted to other service. Sgt. O. J. Brittain and Sgt. George W. Kincaid were promoted to 2nd Lieutenants; the latter was killed at Gettysburg, and Private James G. McCorkle was then promoted to 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nCompany ECapt. John S. A. Nichols of Mecklenburg County; 1st Lt. William J. Kerr; 2nd Lt. John B. Clanton and 2nd Lt. William N. S. Means. Capt. John S. A. Nichols died on July 12, 1862 at Wilmington, NC; 1st Lt. William J. Kerr was promoted to Captain and 2nd Lt. John B. Clanton was promoted to 1st Lieutenant. 2nd Lt. William N. S. Means was killed at White Hall, NC on December 16, 1862, and Sgt. William F. Rozell, Sgt. William S. Turner, and Sgt. James F. Alexander were promoted to 2nd Lieutenants.\n\nCompany FCapt. Edward A. Small of Chowan County; 1st Lt. T. Judson Knapp; 2nd Lt. Stephen W. Roberts and 2nd Lt. B. B. Haskins. 1st Lt. T. Judson Knapp was promoted to Chaplain, 2nd Lt. Stephen W. Roberts was promoted to 1st Lieutenant, and Sgt. William D. Rae was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nCompany GCapt. James R. Jennings of Orange County; 1st Lt. John F. Freeland; 2nd Lt. Duncan C. Waddell and 2nd Lt. John H. McDade. Capt. James R. Jennings died of yellow fever on September 16, 1862 and 1st Lt. John F. Freeland was promoted to Captain; 2nd Lt. Duncan C. Waddell was promoted to 1st Lieutenant. 2nd Lt. John H. McDade was killed at Gettysburg, and Thomas J. Norwood was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant but resigned; Nathaniel B. Jennings was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant and was killed at Gettysburg; and, Corporal James R. Whitaker and Private James W. Williams were promoted to 2nd Lieutenants.\n\nCompany HCapt. William L. Grier of Mecklenburg County; 1st Lt. Patrick J. Lowrie; 2nd Lt. C. B. Boyce and 2nd Lt. J. B. Lowrie. 1st Lt. Patrick J. Lowrie was promoted to Assistant Commissary of Subsistence, and died in July of 1862; 2nd Lt. J. B. Lowrie was killed at Gettysburg and Sgt. James M. Saville, Sgt. John M. Knox, and Robert B. Lowrie were promoted to 2nd Lieutenants.\n\nCompany ICapt. Albert Sydney Haynes of Lincoln County; 1st Lt. David A. Coon; 2nd Lt. Oliver A. Ramseur and 2nd Lt. Lemuel J. Hoyle. Sgt. Sydney M. Finger, of Company I, was promoted to Acting Assistant Quartermaster and was promoted to Major in the Quartermaster's Department in 1864.\n\nCompany KCapt. James M. Young of Buncombe County; 1st Lt. Robert L. Coleman; 2nd Lt. John A. Burgin and 2nd Lt. John W. Burgin. 1st Lt. Robert L. Coleman was promoted to Captain and Assistant Commissary in the 60th NC Regiment. When 2nd Lt. John A. Burgin and 2nd Lt. John W. Burgin were killed at Gettysburg, Sgt. William T. Dickerson was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and Privates Samuel M. Young and Benjamin F. Boyd were promoted to 2nd Lieutenants.\n\nCol. Collett Leventhorpe was born in England, of good English stock, and served for several years in the British Army, attaining the rank of captain. He resigned his commission in that army, studied medicine and came to America and settled in western North Carolina. When the Civil War between the States began he promptly took up arms in behalf of the people with whom he had cast his lot, and was probably the best finished and equipped regimental field officer in the Confederate service. Taking command of the 11th NC Regiment, he at once brought to its discipline and training the experience of his English Army life. So thoroughly did he discipline and train his regiment, that when it was inspected and incorporated into the Army of Northern Virginia the Inspector General of that army reported to General Robert E. Lee that the 11th NC Regiment was the best drilled, the best equipped, and the best armed regiment in the Army of Northern Virginia. The regiment had been stationed at Camp Davis, near Wilmington, NC, where for three months it had undergone the severest drilling that any troops ever underwent in all America. With reveille at daybreak, the company drill at 6 a.m., guard mounting at 8 a.m., squad drill at 9 a.m., battalion drill at 11 a.m., company drill again at 1 p.m., battalion drill again at 3 p.m. and dress parade at 5 p.m., the regiment soon became so complete a machine that its evolutions were as accurate as clockwork and obtained from its Colonel the compliment (as he one day dismissed the battalion): \"Not quite as proficient as British regulars.\"\n\nThe first day at Camp Mangum that Col. Leventhorpe went with the regiment on dress parade, and after the Adjutant had saluted the Colonel and informed him that the regiment was ready for his commands, the Colonel drew his sword, and \"The Eleventh!\" came in the most powerful voice we had ever heard from human lips. A loud laugh from the men greeted that potent voice, but that laugh was never heard again. Soon every officer and man knew that he had met his friend when in distress and commander on duty. Love and respect took the place of indifference, and from then until now none of his soldiers have named him but with love and honor.\n\nLt. Col. William J. Martin was born in Virginia, and at the commencement of the war was Professor of Mineralogy at the University of North Carolina, and ably assisted the Colonel to perfect and fit the 11th NC Regiment for camp life and battle. Maj. Egbert A. Ross was but an untried boy, who was soon to give up his life in battle a sacrifice to his country. To Surgeon John Wilson too much praise cannot be given for his untiring energy and work and kindness for the comfort and welfare of his patients.\n\nWe served around Wilmington and at various points on the coast until the 1st of October, when we were ordered to Franklin, VA, and took a prominent part in the defense of the Blackwater River, engaging in numerous skirmishes with the enemy operating from Suffolk. The line to be guarded was so long, and the troops to guard it so few, that forced marches were of constant occurrence, and the term foot-cavalry, facetiously applied to us, aptly described our role.\n\nOn December 12, 1862, we were ordered to Kinston, NC, but before we reached it the enemy had taken the town and sent a force up the south side of the Neuse River to cross at White Hall and take the Confederate troops in the rear. We, with portions of three other regiments and a section of artillery, all under Brig. Gen. Beverly Robertson (VA), were hurried up to White Hall bridge, and arrived in time to burn it before the enemy could cross. Here the regiment had its first real baptism of fire. Posted along the river bank, from which another regiment had just been driven, we were pounded for several hours at short range by a terrific storm of grape and canister as well as by musketry, but we never flinched, and gained a reputation for endurance and courage which we proudly maintained to the fateful end at Appomattox. The enemy finally desisted from the effort to force a passage and drew off toward Goldsborough.\n\nAfter the battle of White Hall the 11th NC Regiment became a part of the brigade of Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew (NC), and continued under his command until his death from wounds received at the battle of Gettysburg, PA. The next three (3) months were spent at Goldsborough, Weldon, Magnolia, and Greenville, all in North Carolina.\n\nFrom Greenville the regiment took part in the expedition of Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC) against Washington, NC, and on the 9th of April, 1863, at Blount's Creek Bridge, with the aid of an artillery battery, it successfully resisted the attempt of Federal Maj. Gen. John G. Foster to reinforce the garrison of Washington by that route, driving back, after a spirited fight of several hours, Brig. Gen. Francis B. Spinola's command, consisting of three brigades, besides artillery and cavalry. Our position was a very strong one naturally; we were well entrenched, and there were other troops in reserve; still it remains that Brig. Gen. Spinola's giving up the crossing of the creek as hopeless and his return to New Bern after so brief a contest was pusillanimous, and he deserved the censure he got from his superiors in command. Towards the end of the month we marched by way of Hookerton to Kinston to meet a demonstration made by Maj. Gen. Foster, apparently to distract attention from the projected movements in Virginia and to keep as many Confederates as possible away from the real seat of war.\n\nIn the beginning of May we were hurried to Richmond to meet Federal Maj. Gen. George Stoneman's raid and to protect the railroad and the bridges over the North and South Anna Rivers. From there we went to Hanover Junction, and thence to Fredericksburg (Hamilton's Crossing) early in June. There the brigade was assigned to Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's (VA) Division, Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill's (VA) Third Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, in which relation we continued to the end of the war. When the army took up the line of march which ended at Gettysburg, Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade formed part of it (except the 44th NC Regiment, Col. Thomas C. Singeltary, which had been left to guard Hanover Junction) and took a very prominent part in the bloody three days' fight.\n\nMaj. Gen. Heth's Division arrived at Cashtown, nine (9) miles from Gettysburg, on June 29, 1863, being in advance of the corps. On June 30th, Brig. Gen. Pettigrew, with his brigade, was sent to Gettysburg for supplies, but finding a large force of cavalry and infantry there, he was unwilling to hazard an attack with a single brigade, and returned without attempting to enter the town. The next day, July 1, Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's (VA) Corps and Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's (VA) Corps advanced upon Gettysburg by different roads, and Heth's Division being in the advance of Hill's Corps, was the first to strike the enemy, whose strength was then unknown. Upon engaging him he was found to occupy in large force and strongly posted a position west of the town. A line of battle, consisting of the divisions of Maj. Gen. Heth and Maj. Gen. William D. Pender (NC), with two of Lt. Gen. Ewell's divisions, was formed for attack, one division of each corps being held in reserve, and drove the Federals through Gettysburg, with very heavy loss, to the range of hills south and east of the town.\n\nIn this engagement Brig. Gen. Pettigrew's Brigade occupied the center of Maj. Gen. Heth's line, and encountered the enemy in heavy force, breaking through his first, second, and third lines. \"The Eleventh North Carolina, Colonel Leventhorpe commanding, and the Twenty-sixth North Carolina, Colonel Burgwyn commanding,\" says Maj. Gen. Heth in his official report, \"displayed conspicuous gallantry, of which I was an eye-witness, and the whole brigade fought as well and displayed as heroic courage as it was ever my fortune to witness on a battlefield.\" In this attack Col. Collett Leventhorpe was wounded and subsequently made a prisoner, and Maj. Egbert A. Ross was killed. The total loss in this day's fight we do not find recorded, but in the battles of the first and third days (it was held in reserve the second day) the regiment lost fifty (50) killed and one hundred and fifty-nine (159) wounded, and in the fatal charge of the third day on Cemetery Hill many were taken prisoners.\n\nIn the third day's fight Maj. Gen. Heth's Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Pettigrew, whose brigade was commanded by Col. Marshall of the 52nd NC Regiment, and Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett's (VA) Division, of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's (AL) Corps, a fresh division not previously engaged, bore the brunt of the attack on Cemetery Hill, and in a perfect hailstorm of musketry, grape and canister, which made it a slaughter pen, succeeded in penetrating the Federal line, only to be promptly repulsed, leaving a large number of wounded and unwounded prisoners in the enemy's hands. At the close of this battle the regiment found itself reduced to a mere handful. Maj. Jones, of the 26th NC Regiment, was the only field officer left in the brigade, and most of the company officers were either killed, wounded or captured. The companies of the regiment generally came out with a single officer, and several of them with none at all.\n\nCompany A had crossed the Potomac River with a hundred (100) men, and came out of the charge on Cemetery Hill with a lieutenant and eight men. Company C went into that day's battle with three (3) officers and thirty-four (34) men and lost two officers killed and thirty (3) men killed or wounded, probably a greater loss than any company has had in any battle since the recorded losses of companies and regiments have been kept since Thermopylae. In the third day's battle the entire new color guard of eight men being killed or wounded. Capt. Francis W. Bird, commanding Company C and the color guard, took the flag when the last guard fell with it, and carried it on until the charge was a failure and the line retired, bringing off the flag and stub of the staff which had been twice shot off in his hands. It was the only flag brought back from that sanguinary hill. Lieutenants Thomas W. Cooper and Edward A. Rhodes, of Company C, were both killed. It was the color company, and the flag that it bore was a target for the guns and rifles of the enemy.\n\nThe losses in the other companies were equally severe. Owing to the number of officers captured in the Gettysburg battles and not exchanged, many of the vacancies could not be filled, and this defective organization continued to mar the efficiency of the regiment to the end of the war. Col. Collett Leventhorpe did not return to the command, and for some time Lt. Col. William J. Martin was the only field officer. He became, upon the exchange of Col. Leventhorpe and his promotion to Brigadier General of the North Carolina Reserves, Colonel of the regiment, and Capt. Francis W. Bird, of Company C, its Major. On the death of Capt. Mark D. Armfield at Johnson's Island (OH), who was entitled by seniority to the Lieutenant Colonelcy, Maj. Bird became Lieutenant Colonel. The ranking captains were prisoners, and so we could not have a Major, and when Lt. Col. Bird was killed at 2nd Reams' Station, Col. William J. Martin, for the second time, became the only field officer in the regiment, and so continued to the end of the war. In a similar way most of the companies were crippled in the matter of officers. In spite of this great hindrance, the career of the regiment continued to be in every way worthy of its glorious past, a fact which is infinitely to the credit of the private soldiers and their non-commissioned officers.\n\nBrig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's Brigade was the rear guard when the Potomac River was recrossed at Falling Waters on July 14th, and about 11 o'clockthe men being mostly asleep from exhaustiona small body of cavalry, a squadron of the 6th Michigan, made its appearance, and being mistaken for our own cavalry, was allowed to approach within one hundred and seventy-five (175) yards unmolested. They madly charged our lines, and were annihilated; but in the melee Brig. Gen. Pettigrew was mortally wounded by a ball from the pistol of the Major in command. Subsequently a heavy force of the enemy came up, and as the crossing of the bridge had to be done fighting, some loss was sustained, including a few captured, doubtless because they were too much exhausted to keep up. As the brigade crossed, about 12 o'clock, the pontoon bridge was cut loose, and for the first time for many days the command drew a free breath. Next day the brigade marched to Bunker Hill in command of Major Jones, where the army encamped for several days to recuperate. There Col. William J. Martin, who had been sent back to the hospital after the brigade left Fredericksburg, rejoined his regiment and took command of the brigade, being in turn relieved by Col. Thomas C. Singeltary, of the 44th NC Regiment, when that regiment rejoined us.\n\nThe army gradually moved southward, and by the 4th of August we occupied the line of the Rapidan River, our brigade being stationed successively at Orange Court House, Culpeper Court House, and Rapidan Station. At this time, September 7, Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland (NC) was assigned to the command of the brigade, a command which he actually exercised for a very few months. During the period of his connection with us, about nine months, he was wounded twice, and off duty in consequence; so that, for a large part of the time, between the death of Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew and the assignment of Brig. Gen. William MacRae in November of 1864, the brigade was commanded by Col. Thomas C. Singeltary, the ranking officer.\n\nOn the 10th of October, General Robert E. Lee again took the offensive and started a movement towards the right flank of Federal Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's army; but Maj. Gen. Meade declined battle and withdrew across the Rappahannock River, whereupon a race towards Washington ensued, General Lee endeavoring to get around Maj. Gen. Meade's flank and intercept his retreat. Our corps, with Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's Division in front, crossed the Rappahannock River near Warrenton Springs on October 13th and camped within a mile of Warrenton. Early the next morning we resumed the pursuit, Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's (SC) Division in front, passing the enemy's campfires and debris of breakfast, evidently left in haste. At Greenwich, Maj. Gen. Heth took the lead and followed close upon the rear of the Third Federal Corps, picking up a number of stragglers. We overtook the enemy early in the afternoon at Bristoe Station, a part moving off towards Manassas and a part resting in the plain.\n\nIn his eagerness to prevent the Third Corps from escaping him, Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill (VA) failed to discover that the Second was there also, strongly posted behind the railroad embankment, and in rifle pits behind on the hill. He directed Maj. Gen. Heth to attack, and Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland's (NC) and Brig. Gen. John R. Cooke's (NC) Brigades were formed on the crest of the hills, parallel to Broad Run and the railroad. Brig. Gen. Cooke was on the right of the road and Brig. Gen. Kirkland on the left, the 11th NC Regiment being the extreme left of the line. As soon as we advanced the presence of the Federal Second Corps became evident, and from their shelter behind the railroad embankment they poured in a deadly fusillade, while the Federal batteries, well posted, swept the field. Brig. Gen. Cooke was more opposed than Brig. Gen. Kirkland and suffered more, and his regiments were driven back. Brig. Gen. Kirkland pushed on, and the left of his line, the 11th NC Regiment, and part of the regiment on its right, the 52nd NC Regiment, we think, succeeded in reaching the railroad and dislodging the enemy, themselves sheltered behind it. Brig. Gen. Kirkland had been wounded in this charge, and Col. William J. Martin, the ranking officer of the force at the embankment, finding, after a painful suspense, both flanks exposed, and that the enemy had posted a battery on the railroad to his left to enfilade his line, and no reinforcements appearing, reluctantly ordered a retreat, which was made under a galling fire from behind. A number of the men shrank from crossing the open field and were captured at the railroad.\n\nCol. Martin was twice shot down and severely wounded in this retreat, and the command of the regiment passed to Capt. William L. Grier, the ranking officer present. The loss of the regiment in this ill-judged attack was four (4) killed and eleven (11) wounded, with an unknown number captured. Had the strength of the enemy been recognized and an adequate force put in, what proved a disaster might have been a victory, and Maj. Gen. Meade might even have been brought to bay in the open field. As it was, he quietly withdrew in the night and safely established himself in his entrenchments at Manassas. The loss of the brigade in this battle was two hundred and seventy (270) killed and wounded, and that of Brig. Gen. Cooke's Brigade four hundred and eighty-nine (489). General Robert E. Lee's army now retraced its steps, tearing up the O. & A. Railroad to the Rappahannock River, which, however, the enemy promptly repaired. Here the line was established for awhile, but later we returned to the line of the Rapidan River.\n\nNothing of consequence occurred until during the last days of November. Federal Maj. Gen. George G. Meade moved down towards the lower fords of the Rapidan River, and General Robert E. Lee, on November 27th, moved down correspondingly, Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Corps by the plank road, Col. Thomas C. Singeltary commanding our brigade. The Federals crossed at Germania and Ely's Fords and turned up the river. They were in full force, and a general battle was expected. Our line of battle was formed first east of Mine Run, and then, as a better position in which to receive an attack, on the west of it, and slight earthworks were thrown up at Payne's Farm. There was constant skirmishing, but no general attack was made, and General Lee determined to assume the offensive. Before day on the morning of December 2nd the troops were formed for the attack, but at daylight it was found that the enemy had retired at night. Pursuit was made, but they recrossed the Rapidan River before we could overtake them. We returned to our camp near Orange Court House and spent the remainder of the winter there.\n\nOn May 4, 1864, the Federal army, this time with Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in command, again crossed the Rapidan River at the same fords, with Richmond as Lt. Gen. Grant's avowed objective point and with the intention \"to fight General Lee between Culpeper and Richmond, if he would stand.\" General Lee did stand, moving out Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's (VA) Corps on the turnpike and Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's (only Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's and Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's Divisions) on the plank road and ordering up from Gordonsville Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's (AL) Corps and Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's (SC) Division. A pitched battle was fought in the Wilderness on May 5th, 6th, and 7th, resulting in Lt. Gen. Grant's complete failure to carry our position and in his withdrawal towards Spotsylvania Court House, the beginning of his famous \"flank movements.\" The Federal attack of May 5th was concentrated on Maj. Gen. Heth's and Maj. Gen. Wilcox's line. Brig. Gen. Kirkland's Brigade, with the rest of the corps, was actively engaged all through the day in repelling assault after assault of Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's Corps and in counter charges, until night closed the contest, with the enemy baffled at every point. In one of these charges our brigade formed part of a second line of battle, Brig. Gen. Cooke's Brigade, commanded by Col. William MacRae, afterwards our Brigadier General, being on the first line. In advancing we came upon Col. MacRae's line lying down, and as we charged over him with a yell, he sneered sardonically: \"Go ahead; you'll soon come back.\" And sure enough we did. We struck, as he had done, the Federal line behind entrenchments, from which in vain we tried to dislodge it, and recoiled, lying down in turn behind Col. MacRae's line. I fancy he smiled sardonically then.\n\nThe worn-out troops of Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's (VA) Corps were ordered to rest on their arms as night found them, without reformation of lines, as they were to be relieved at midnight by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's (AL) Corps. This was a miscalculation and a well-nigh fatal mistake, for about daybreak of May 6th, when it was found that Lt. Gen. Longstreet had not come up, our men commenced to form line of battle, but before it was completed a furious attack was made on our left flank and the unformed line was rolled up as a sheet of paper would be rolled without the power of effective resistance. If even a single brigade had changed front to the left before the enemy struck their flank they might have stemmed the tide and have stopped the rout; but no brigadier seems to have thought of it, and the situation was desperate. All the advantage of yesterday's hard fighting was about lo be lost, when the head of Lt. Gen. Longstreet's column came up, and the leading brigade was formed under fire and thrown upon the victorious Federals.\n\nHere is said to have occurred the thrilling incident of General Robert E. Lee's offering to head this brigade in person and their refusing to advance unless he would remain behind. Other of Lt. Gen. Longstreet's brigades were put in as fast as they came up, and in a short time all of the lost ground was regained from the enemy, and in turn his left flank attacked, a heavy loss being inflicted upon him. Our brigade was not hotly engaged the balance of this day, and no very serious fighting was done by any part of the opposing armies the next day. On May 8th we started for Spotsylvania, to put ourselves in Grant's front and intercept his march towards Richmond. At one time, during the fighting on May 5th, our regiment lay down behind a line of dead Federals so thick as to form a partial breastwork, showing how stubbornly they had fought and how severely they had suffered. It was a novel experience and seems ghastly enough in the retrospect.\n\nThere was more or less fighting along the lines during the 8th and 9th of May, in which our brigade took no part. On May 10th Maj. Gen. Heth's Division was sent to Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early (VA), on the extreme Confederate left, and attacked Federal Maj. Gen. Francis C. Barlow's Division of Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's Corps, which had crossed to the south side of the Potomac River, menacing General Lee's left flank, and drove it back to the north side. Maj. Gen. Hancock had his artillery strung along on the hills north of the Potomac River so as to protect the crossing of his men and to prevent our crossing after them. We could not, therefore, follow up the advantage gained. During this fight the woods in rear of the Federals took fire and they had to retreat and we to advance through the burning forest. It was a hot time, literally, and many of the Federal dead and wounded were consumed. Maj. Gen. Heth's Division took no active part in the severe fighting of the next two (2) days around the town of Spotsylvania, but was moved about from point to point, as our lines were threatened by the enemy's repeated assaults. It was thus hurried in hot haste to the salient lost after desperate fighting on May 12th by Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson's (GA) Division; but Federa Maj. Gen. Hancock's men, pouring through the gap, had already been driven back by other troops and the line re-established when we got there. After several days' maneuvering and skirmishibg without serious fighting, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant gave it up, and began his next flank movement on May 20th.\n\nContinuing his policy of turning our flank and interposing himself between us and Richmond, in which policy he was continually foiled by finding General Robert E. Lee in front of him at every move, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant transferred his army to the North Anna River, and then to the Chickahominy River, whence, despairing of reaching Richmond by the north side, he crossed the James River, intending to take Petersburg. In the course of these movements, lasting from 20th May to 14th June, many engagements of minor, and some of great importance, took place on the line of the North Anna, Pamunkey and Totapotamoie Rivers, and around Cold Harbor and the Chickahominy River. Our brigade took part in a number of them, marching and counter-marching and doing some very hard fighting, but the details we find ourselves unable to record in their order satisfactorily. In one of these fights Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland (NC) was wounded and did not again rejoin the brigade. Col. William MacRae, of the 15th NC Regiment, was promoted to Brigadier General on June 27th [other sources claim it was November 4, 1864] and assigned to the command of our brigade, in which command he continued until the surrender at Appomattox. He was a strict disciplinarian, as was Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew, and which Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland was not, and he rapidly brought the brigade to a high degree of efficiency. Brig. Gen. Kirkland was subsequently assigned to a brigade in Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Division.\n\nFederal Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant commenced transferring his army across the James River on June 14th, and, in conjunction with the troops already on the south side, attempted to surprise and capture Petersburg before General Robert E. Lee's forces could get there, and he very nearly succeeded. But after some pretty stubborn fighting he was again foiled, and both armies proceeded to entrench themselves in a line reaching from the James River to the Appomattox River and around Petersburg nearly to the Weldon Railroad, and what was practically a siege of the city began, to last until its fall in April of 1865. In some places these lines ultimately came so close together that no pickets could be thrown out, and picket duty was performed by sharpshooters in the trenches, who made it hazardous for anyone on either side to expose any part of his person. Mortar shelling was also added to the ordinary artillery fire, rendering bomb-proofs a necessity, and they were accordingly built all along our lines. In spite of this dangerous proximity and the well-nigh ceaseless firing kept up during the night, our men learned to sleep as soundly and as peacefully in these trenches as they were accustomed to do in camp. One can get used to anything.\n\nAfter we got into the defenses of Petersburg we continued there to the end, except one hurried march to the north of the James River (July 27th), when Lt. Gen. Grant sent Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's Corps and a large body of cavalry to destroy the railroads north of Richmond. General Robert E. Lee supposing this to be an attempt upon Richmond itself, started a good many troops northward from Petersburg, our brigade among the number. Lt. Gen. Grant quickly took advantage of this depletion to spring a mine (July 30th), which he had prepared under a salient in our lines in front of Petersburg, and to follow this with an assaulting column, which was to break through in the confusion and capture the city. In this he would probably have succeeded but for the bungling way in which the assault was managed. As it was, the mine proved a slaughter pen for the assailants. Some indecisive fighting was done on the north side, and then, when Lt. Gen. Grant's real object was uncovered and frustrated, the troops of both armies returned to Petersburg.\n\nExcept this assault, no other was seriously attempted against the entrenched lines immediately around Petersburg until the end, and the active operations of the ensuing nine (9) months consisted of repeated efforts on Lt. Gen. Grant's part to extend his line to the left and get possession of the railroads, and on General Lee's part to prevent it and to punish him for attempting it. Inch by inch, Lt. Gen. Grant did gain ground until he planted himself across the Weldon Railroad, which he also several times cut south of us, chiefly by cavalry raids. In these operations, Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's (VA) Corps being on. the right of our line, Brig. Gen. William MacRae's (NC) Brigade was frequently called to take a part, alternating these field operations with service in the trenches, so that we were almost continuously under fire. We will mention only the principal actions, as far as we can remember them, in which the 11th NC Regiment was engaged.\n\nFederal Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren's Fifth Corps took possession of the Weldon Railroad on the 18th of August, and attempts to dislodge him brought a number of sanguinary engagements with Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill's Corps, one of which, Lt. Gen. Hill captured two thousand and seven hundred (2,700) prisoners [2nd Weldon Railroad]. Our brigade was not in this battle. A combined attack on Maj. Gen. Warren's fortifications on the railroad was made on the morning of the 21st by our brigade and Maj. Gen. Robert Ransom's (NC), with a force of artillery, making a demonstration down the railroad in his front, while the real attack was to be made by a larger force under Maj. Gen. William Mahone (VA) on his left flank. It did not succeed. We lay between our batteries (thirty pieces) and theirs during the artillery duel which opened the ball, and came in for some pretty severe shelling. We then charged, driving in their pickets and advanced line, and lay down under cover of a ravine quite close up to their works, awaiting the signal of Maj. Gen. Mahone's success to rush in. Maj. Gen. Mahone's attack failed, and we lay low till night enabled us to withdraw under cover of darkness. We lost some men killed and a number wounded, and if Maj. Gen. Warren had known how few we were in his front, and had sent out an adequate force, he might have captured the most of these two brigades, isolated as we were.\n\nOn the afternoon of August 25th our brigade and Brig. Gen. John R. Cooke's (NC), with Brig. Gen. James H. Lane's (NC), attacked Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's Corps well entrenched at Reams' Station, a previous charge by other troops having been repulsed. We carried their works handsomely, capturing two thousand (2,000) prisoners and nine (9) pieces of artillery. Maj. Gen. Hancock retired during the night and we returned to Petersburg. Our loss was considirable, including Lt. Col. Francis W. Bird, killed, after which, to the close of the war, the regiment had but one (1) field officer. The ranking captains entitled to the positions of Lieutenaut Colonel and Major were prisoners at Johnson's Island. This law of succession by seniority, customary and perhaps the best under ordinary circumstances, worked very great injury to many regiments situated as ours was. As has been mentioned, the 11th NC Regiment, most of the time after Gettysburg, had but one field officer, and from September 30, 1864, to the fall of Petersburg, during which time Col. William J. Martin was off duty from a desperate wound, it had none at all. That it maintained its efficiency under such adverse circumstances, speaks volumes for the morale of its men and for the training which it had iu the earlier part of the war.\n\nOn September 30th, a movement was made by the Federal's Fifth and Ninth Corps (Maj. Gen. Gouverneur Warren's and Maj. Gen. John G. Parke's), of two divisions each, to turn our right and incidentally to prevent troops being sent from our army to the north side of the James River, where Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was projecting important operations. This was met by a counter movement of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's (VA) Division to the right, and in the afternoon he attacked Maj. Gen. Parke near the Pegram House at Jones's Farm (aka Peeble's Farm) and forced him back a considerable distance, until night put a stop to the fighting. During the course of this advance a considerable body of troops appeared on our right and bore down on our flank, occupied by Brig. Gen. William MacRae's (NC) Brigade. The situation was critical. There was no time to ask for orders, and without orders Col. William J. Martin at once caused our regiment and the one next to us, the 52nd NC Regiment, probably, occupying the extreme right of our line, which was already being thrown into disorder, to change front to the right and charge the Federal flanking party. They were completely routed and four hundred (400) prisoners captured, more prisoners than we had men in the two regiments. We then returned to the brigade, and Col. Martin was in the act, about dark, of reforming the line, when he was struck with a shell which carried away a large slice of his left thigh. He was with difficulty carried off the field in a blanket, and neither he nor the surgeons of the field hospital expected that he would recover; but he did after so long a time, and rejoined the regiment the night before the lines were broken at Petersburg, the wound still not completely healed. In consequence of this protracted absence he has no personal knowledge of the operations in which the regiment was engaged from October 1, 1864, to April 2, 1865.\n\nOn the 1st and 2nd of October, the movement above referred to, of the enemy against our right, was kept up, and the brigade was more or less seriously engaged over several miles of territory outside our lines. As the result of the movement the Federal entrenchments were considerably extended on their left.\n\nOn October 27th, another movement to the left, with the Southside Railroad as the objective point, was made by the Army of the Potomac, with the whole or the most of the Federal's Second, Fifth, and Ninth Corps. The Fifth and Ninth found our works in their front so strong that they did not seriously attempt to carry them; but Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, to the left of the Fifth and Ninth, attacked our right impetuously, yet without success. He was then in turn attacked by Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill (VA), and a hotly contested but indecisive battle was fought in the open field at Burgess' Mill. In the night the Federals returned to their original lines and we afterwards returned to ours. From then until the close of the year the 11th NC Regiment was continuously on duty and daily (and nightly, too) under fire, but in no important engagement.\n\nBoth armies remained quiet during January of 1865, but in February, Federal Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant resumed the anaconda process of enveloping Petersburg, preparatory to swallowing it and General Robert E. Lee's army. On February 5th, the Federal's Second and Fifth Corps, with a division of cavalry, moved out to Hatcher's Run, and in the afternoon parts of the Sixth and Ninth Corps were ordered up to reinforce them. This movement was resisted by Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Corps and parts of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's (AL), Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's Division attacking Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphrey's Second Corps, and subsequently the whole corps participating. Nothing was accomplished. Fighting was resumed on February 6th and 7th, and Lt. Gen. Hill gained some advantage in the afternoon of February 6th by defeating, with heavy loss, Maj. Gen. Warren's Fifth Corps. But they brought up fresh troops, and our victory was a barren one, the Federals finally holding Hatcher's Run at Dabney's Mill.\n\nAnother lull now followed until March 25th, when General Robert E. Lee, with Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon's (AL) Division, made an assault on Fort Stedman (aka Hare's Hill), on the Federal right, and carried it handsomely, with capture of prisoners and guns. But our army was now so attenuated that we could not hold any ground we gained or follow up any victory, while the Federals could pour in fresh troops to retrieve their disasters; so the fort was soon retaken, and Lt. Gen. Grant made a counter demonstration along his lines. There was some severe fighting on our right, in which Brig. Gen. William MacRae's (NC) Brigade was engaged. Nothing was accomplished on either side.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt. Gen. Grant had been preparing his army for a final coup de main, withdrawing troops from the north side of the James River and from the entrenchments on the right of his line at Petersburg, concentrating them in the rear of his left near Hatcher's Run. His program was to bear down on our right with crushing force and, in case General Lee reinforced his right with troops from the trenches at Petersburg, to assault the weakened lines at any practicable point and carry them. The plan was a complete success. General Lee did carry every available soldier to the right, and some heavy fighting, with varying fortune, was done there, beginning March 29th and culminating in the battle of Five Forks on April 1st, in which last battle our troops (Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett's Division and our cavalry corps under Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee) were disastrously defeated at the hands of Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's Cavalry and Maj. Gen. Gouverneur Warren's Fifth Corps of Infantry. On the morning of April 2nd, at 4 o'clock, our attenuated lines near Petersburg were assaulted by Federal Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright and Maj. Gen. John G. Parke (Sixth and Ninth Corps), previously massed in front of their works, and so near to ours that they could reach them in a few steps, and almost before their approach was known.\n\nMaj. Gen. Wright's Corps carried the works in his front, which would have been impregnable if defended by any adequate force, but which in fact were occupied by a mere skirmish line. The 11th NC Regiment and the 26th NC Regiment were among the troops in trenches (the rest of the brigade having gone to the right), and the men were placed five or six feet apart. Breaking through the line at the point of assault, the Federals swung around to the left and swept down the trenches, turning our own artillery against us as it was captured. At the same time Maj. Gen. Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the first line of our works in his front nearer to Petersburg, but here encountered an inner line of fortifications which he failed to carry, though he afterwards did so when reinforced by other troops. Our lines being thus cut in two, and the troops on Hatcher's Run cut off from those at Petersburg, General Robert E. Lee evacuated Petersburg and undertook to reassemble his army on the Danville Railroad.\n\nIt was not to be. Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant flanked him and dogged his rear during all the dreary retreat, ending with the surrender, April 9th, of the remnant of General Robert E. Lee's army at Appomattox Court House. During this retreat Brig. Gen. William MacRae's (NC) Brigade was often called upon for service, which it rendered with alacrity if not with hopefulness.\n\nOn April 8th, our brigade formed the rear guard of the army. Formed in a triangle across the road, the men six (6) feet apart, the rear angle resting on the road. From this position it was relieved by Maj. Gen. William Mahone's (VA) men and taken at double-quick, with the remainder of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's Division, to protect the artillery stalled in the mud and menaced by a large force of cavalry. The division witnessed a cavalry charge that seemed to be bloody and terrific, but the retreat of the Federals disclosed the fact that although the two bodies of cavalry had violently assaulted each other with sword and pistol, the only man killed on the field was a Confederate lieutenant, whose head was shot off by our own guns.\n\nOn the night of April 7th, in a consultation of the officers of the 11th NC Regiment, Capt. Edward R. Outlaw, of Company C, was advised to take charge of the flag and see that it was not lost. It was removed from the staff, the silk cover replaced, and during the 8th of April it was not unfurled and no one knew but that the flag was on the staff. When General Robert E. Lee rode to the front and through the lines to meet Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, everyone knew that the hour of surrender had come. The officers present with the regiment at once retired to a secluded thicket, and raking up a pile of twigs and leaves, committed the flag to the flames. Before burning it, Capt. Outlaw and Capt. James M. Young tore out pieces of each color. Sincere tears have often been shed around funeral pyres, but never more bitter and sorrowful tears bedewed any ashes than were shed over their dead flag. It had been given by the Legislature of North Carolina to the Bethel Regiment, and then committed to the keeping of the 11th NC Regiment. It had waved over it in triumph on many a bloody field. It had never been dishonored and they could not bear to see it the trophy of an enemy.\n\nMaj. Gen. Henry Heth's (VA) Division surrendered a total of one thousand five hundred and seventy-two (1,572) officers and men and our brigade a total of four hundred and forty-two (442). The exact number of the 11th NC Regiment at the surrender is not recorded. It was doubtless less than one hundred (100). Whatever it was, Col. William J. Martin had the melancholy satisfaction of signing their paroles, and the gallant regiment ceased to exist. Different parties took different routes to their desolate homes, and we bade each other a sad, in many cases a tearful, farewell.\n\n* The above was written by former Colonel William J.
