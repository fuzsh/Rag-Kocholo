        "text": "Team 1 is now down to four members. One member completed his yearlong tour and was rotated home, and the other was transferred out. It is the army’s policy at the time to rotate men in and out of combat as individuals, not as units. Our team positions are Art Guerrero, front scout; John Simones, team leader (TL); David Ives (one of the new guys who came with me, communications specialist with the Second Battalion, Twelfth Cavalry), radiotelephone operator (RTO); Geoff Koper, medic; Doug Fletcher assistant team leader (ATL); with me as rear scout. Simones is a sergeant and I’m a private first class, but everyone else is a corporal. And other than David Ives, who is 20, we’re all in our mid-twenties.\n\nWe’ll soon be heading out on a mission, so the other team members take David Ives and me to the NCO club on base for a few beers, to get to know each other. From inside the club, a jukebox keeps playing the Beatles’ newly released “Strawberry Fields Forever.” An hour later, as we all walk back to our unit, John Simones starts humming the song and David Ives joins in: “Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about . . .” The melody is comforting on this dark night, in this strange country.[4]\n\nArt was raised in Denver’s inner city and served with the Fifth Battalion, Seventh Calvary Regiment—Custer’s old outfit. He earned a Silver Star––our nation’s third-highest medal for gallantry––in the An Lao Valley, where the NVA and VC had a long-established sanctuary. John served in the Marine Force Recon in Southern Europe before coming to the army, where he believed promotions happened faster. Geoff was a combat medic who served in the Forty-Seventh Medical Battalion. Doug served with the Fifth Battalion, Seventh Cavalry Regiment, and was also awarded a Silver Star for action in the An Lao Valley. Everyone but David Ives and me had several months in-country before coming to the LRRPs. They’re experienced and have pulled about ten missions as LRRPs. They will take care of David Ives and me.\n\nAt dusk, Thursday, April 20, 1967, Team 1 is inserted by helicopter into our area of operation, north of Camp Radcliff and An Khe. We’re put in at the head of a shallow valley, where a stream begins on top of a 2,000-foot mountain. The surrounding slopes are covered with double- and triple-canopy forest, but clear areas lie along the stream. Intelligence has it that small Vietcong units are operating in this area and grouping together for attacks. By using established trails, an enemy battalion of 600 men could leave this mountain; spend a day traveling, and attack Camp Radcliff that night.\n\nIt’s hot and humid, and the mosquitoes start in on us as soon as our birds lift away. We are to follow this southwest-flowing stream and look for any sign of the enemy, since people never stray too far from a reliable source of water. We will stay in the field for seven days with only what we’re carrying. Thus, having a source of water is as vital for us as for the enemy, because no one can carry a week’s supply.\n\nThe closest US Army troops are at Camp Radcliff, fifteen kilometers south. The nearest friendlies of any kind are at Kan Nak, seven kilometers away. Kan Nak is where this stream empties into the Song Ba River. The Green Berets once had a base there, but only ARVNs are there now. Our escape-and-evasion plan, if we should make contact and can’t get extracted, is to hightail it on foot to Kan Nak.\n\nWe are outside our artillery cover. And because of the mountains and the lack of any radio relay points, radio contact will be difficult. We have only one twenty-three-pound PRC-25 radio and two spare batteries. The PRC-25 has a range of twenty-four kilometers, but that’s in ideal terrain and weather conditions. It is VHF, which has more range than the lower frequencies and can penetrate adverse weather. But VHF doesn’t hug the earth as well, and here, bracketed by the wall of mountains around us, its effectiveness will be limited.\n\nWe are to radio only a brief situation report, once in the morning and once in the evening, so that enemy troops listening in on radios can’t triangulate our position. Most of the time, to make radio contact, our tactical operations center (TOC) at Camp Radcliff will need to put a chopper in the air.\n\nOn our second day, Friday, April 21, we continue downstream, making our way through thick eight-foot-high elephant grass. I quickly learn more than I ever wanted to know about leeches. The elephant grass is loaded with them. Walk a hundred meters; pick off six or eight leeches; walk, and pick off six or eight more.\n\nWe hear someone chopping wood—not necessarily a problem, since some friendly locals live out here. I later hear a hen cackling, but apparently, they run wild in the Central Highlands. This isn’t West Virginia; chickens didn’t necessarily mean people. It’s going to take some time getting the hang of all this.\n\nSaturday morning, April 22, we move through open timber and into thick new-growth jungle, still gradually descending into the valley. Unable to see more than ten or fifteen feet in any direction, we move slowly to keep as quiet as possible. We stop in this dense foliage and eat a LRRP ration—the first meal of the day. With the heat and humping heavy gear, we’re low on water, and all our rations are dehydrated.\n\nArt and I take the canteens down to the stream, about forty meters away, but on the way we discover a major trail––a “high-speeder.” The tall timber keeps the trail hidden from aircraft. Only someone on the ground can see it. Finding this sort of thing is exactly why the LRRPs are out here. This trail is wide and smooth enough to drive a jeep on. This means it sees a lot of foot traffic and is likely an enemy transit route that leads directly to An Khe and Camp Radcliff.\n\nA thatched hut stands on low stilts by the trail. The trail runs close to the hooch and curves below it. There are several firing positions on the downhill side of the hooch, overlooking the trail. The door to the hooch is on the uphill side, and Art and I don’t see or hear anyone.\n\nArt decides to check out the hooch. We left our rucksacks with the rest of the team, but we’re carrying our rifles, wearing our web gear with ammo pouches and grenades. Art peeks inside and sees papers on a shelf. I pull security while he goes after the papers. Art is a big guy and his web gear gets stuck in the small door.\n\nHearing non-English voices from the other side of the hooch, I let Art know we have company. He gets free from the door without making any noise and hand signals me to get back to our team while he pulls rear security.\n\nThe high-speed trail lies between me and the welcoming cover of the jungle. I take off too fast and hit the brush too hard—this by a guy who spent his life in the woods and knows how not to spook the game. Back across the trail, Art links up with me again. He says a woman and several men were on the other side of the hooch, and when I hit the brush, she screamed and threw what she was carrying up in the air. They’re wearing the typical black pajamas—most likely Vietcong.\n\nWe get back to the team, and they ask what took us so long to go forty meters. We quickly explain and call in a situation report to TOC—which takes several attempts because of our radio’s limitations. We’ll get water another time.\n\nA hillside across the stream from us has a clearing big enough to get a chopper in, but it’s getting late. John decides to move across beside the clearing and set up for the night in case we need to be extracted. We hear something behind us as we moved––we have an enemy trailer.\n\nAfter crossing the stream, we buttonhook near the clearing to see if we can pick up our trailer. This is a standard maneuver going all the way back to Rogers’ Rangers during the French and Indian Wars.[5] The team simply curls back onto its own trail to see if anyone is following. We set an ambush but see no one. When it’s darker, we move about thirty meters to a position that John checked before we buttonhooked.\n\nProcedure permits a team leader who believes his team has been compromised to call for an extraction. Since we didn’t detect a trailer and since our job is to find the enemy, who we now know is out there, Simones decides to continue the patrol. Also, there’s a nagging suspicion at headquarters that Simones doesn’t want to reinforce: a LRRP team leader was recently transferred out of our unit for emptying his magazine into the jungle and radioing for an extraction when the other team members knew that no one was there.[6]\n\nWe set up a night defensive position in a small cove with heavy brush around us and place claymore mines facing likely enemy approaches. We have the open field uphill and are in an excellent fighting position should the enemy decide to take us on.\n\nArt Guerrero and Geoff Koper, our front scout and medic, take a position slightly downhill and to the right of me. David Ives, our RTO, is to my left, next to a huge tree with big exposed roots. Behind the tree, facing the other direction, are our TL, John Simones, and our ATL, Doug Fletcher.\n\nIn the middle of the night, we hear movement. It’s pitch black, and we can’t see anything, but something is approaching Art and Geoff. They raise their CAR-15s, ready to fire but not wanting to shoot prematurely and give away our position. Meanwhile, the noise keeps coming and getting steadily louder. Just as they’re ready to fire, they hear snorting and snuffling that sounds like a wild boar. It heads away, but just in case the enemy is out there, I pull out the eight-inch Buck hunting knife I brought from home. I’m wondering what it’s like to kill a man in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nWhen my turn comes to rest, I sleep well. I’m exhausted from humping eighty-five pounds through the jungle all day. I don’t know how Geoff does it—he weighs only 150 pounds.\n\nSunday, April 23, 1967, is our fourth day in the field. David Ives and I are sleeping side by side, sharing a poncho liner to protect us from the bugs. We wake for the five to seven a.m. watch. Not a morning person, I sit leaning against my pack, which is propped against the tree. There’s a good chance the enemy is still searching for us, so I try not to sit too high. But I don’t want to lie down too flat, either, and risk nodding off.\n\nThere’s another problem. The LRRP rations, the malaria pills, or maybe the stream water has given me diarrhea. It’s about six a.m., and the sun is rising. I tell Dave, pick up my rifle and some toilet paper, and walk a short distance away to let ’er rip. Then I go back and sit against my pack while the other men stir a little, ready to start another day.\n\nThe next thing I know, a bright flash dazzles my eyes and I’m lying ten feet down the hill. A hand grenade has gone off, and I just became the LRRP’s first wounded in action. I can’t hear a thing and feel no pain, but I know I’m hit. Shrapnel has chewed up my face and left arm, and I’m covered in dirt, sweat, and blood.\n\nI crawl back up the hill to my weapon and rucksack. The explosion has also hit my rucksack, the tree, and, I think, Dave Ives. As I approach my pack, a burst of automatic gunfire hits the ground in front of me, spitting dirt and rocks up into my face. I come out of my daze and realize that one of the “rocks” is a ricocheted bullet. The round goes through my lower left jaw and breaks it, taking out a bunch of teeth.\n\nThe impact knocks me out. After this, events come as intermittent flashes of awareness.\n\nDuring periods of semiconsciousness, I want to cover my sector by returning fire, but I can’t see. I feel a disturbing lump dangling under my left eye and reach up to touch it. The pressure I put on the lump makes me dizzy, and I realize that this is what remains of my left eye and lower eyelid. I wipe dirt and blood out of my right eye, and for a moment I can see. I think that with just the right pressure, I’ll be able be able to hold my left eye in place and return fire.\n\nI try to raise my rifle and fire, but my left arm is too weak to support it. I realize that the grenade tore muscles from my forearm, which are hanging out in shreds, and that one of my knuckles is torn open and broken. With my right hand, I try to shove the muscles back into my arm, where they belong. It doesn’t work, so I prop up my left arm and rifle with my right hand, but when I move my right hand to the trigger, the rifle sinks. Damn, I think, I need another hand!\n\nThe first chopper arrives. It’s from the 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion and is piloted by Warrant Officer James Bracewell, a former air force enlisted man and Distinguished Flying Cross recipient who now regularly inserts and extracts our LRRP teams. The QRF isn’t airborne, so Bracewell keys the intercom to his copilot and two door gunners.\n\n“Guys, we got six LRRPs down there. One’s dead and three’s wounded. We can wait for more birds and risk hauling out six bodies, or go in now and risk putting four more bodies on the ground. Your call?”[8]\n\nThe helicopter lands in the open field just up the hill.\n\nI come to, and Doug is carrying me to the Huey. Still no pain, but I hear rotor noise, and Doug has me in his arms like a baby. I’m six feet and weigh 225, and Doug is six-two and 210 pounds—not big enough to carry me alone. And yet, he’s doing it. John is walking beside him. I think he’s carrying someone.\n\nSuddenly, I realize my rifle is in my left hand. My right side is toward Doug, and the rifle is dangling down. Is the weapon on safe? What if the trigger catches a branch, and a bullet hits someone? I better check the safety. I can’t flex my left arm, so I move my right hand to check the rifle.\n\nDoug says, “It’s okay; it’s over . . . it’s over.” His voice is calm, like a father comforting a child after a bad dream. I pass out again.\n\nI come to, and it’s cool. We’re up in the air, heading to Camp Radcliff, and wind is rushing over my body. I lift my head and see my blood on the chopper floor. If I can see my blood, I must be alive. I look out the side of the chopper at the forest below: so green, so quiet, so calm, just like my old West Virginia hills. It would be fun to walk in the woods, to watch the squirrels. Maybe I can take the old redtick out and let him run a coon.\n\nI see feet to my left. There’s a pool of blood around the feet. Someone is sitting on the bench. It’s Art, and he says, “We’re safe now, buddy. Lay down.” I raise my head and look to my right and see another pair of feet but no blood. I try to lift my head to see a face, but I can’t. Somehow, I know it’s Geoff.\n\nIn a blur of thoughts I wonder where John, Doug, and Dave are. I guess they’re taking another chopper. I know they wouldn’t leave Dave behind.[9]\n\nI come to again, and they’re taking me off the chopper. They put me on a stretcher on the ground. A female in olive drab fatigues, with curly red hair and freckles, bends over me. She smiles, and I try to smile back. I’m thinking, Little Orphan Annie’s grown up, and she’s in the army! She then talks to someone else. “You’ll be fine, soldier. You’re at the hospital now.”\n\nI come to, and Art and I are in the Second Surgical Hospital at Camp Radcliff. They’re using scissors to cut off all my clothes. In the confusion of it all, I think, don’t take my boots! I want my boots! And then I pass out.\n\nGeoff is flown to the Forty-Seventh Medical Battalion, his old unit, because he’s just bleeding slightly from one clean hole in his shoulder. But when they can't find an exit wound and his heart rate increases and blood pressure drops off the chart, they rush him by ambulance and he joins us at the Second Surgical Hospital.\n\nHe’s still conscious, and they hurry him to an operating room where he’s placed spread-eagled and naked on a table. He has to be embarrassed, just as I was, what with nurses walking everywhere. He’s operated on, and doctors find the bullet that entered his shoulder, penetrated down through his chest and abdomen, and ended in his pelvis. It did a lot of damage in between and destroyed his spleen.\n\nI come to on a gurney being wheeled down a hallway. Someone is holding my hand.\n\nI come to again, and they’re putting me on an X-ray table. They lay me on my chest and extend my head forward, then rest my chin on the table. Horrific pain––the first I’ve felt since I was wounded. “My jaw’s broke!” I mumble through whatever teeth I have left. They pad my chin and do the x-rays.\n\nArt and I are given IVs and stabilized in different operating rooms and undergo our initial surgeries. The ricochet was a .45—probably from a Thompson submachine gun spitting out ten rounds a second from its thirty-round magazine. The round had smashed my lower left jaw and ten teeth, pierced the roof of my mouth, severed the nerve to my left ear and several nerves to my left cheek, and stopped a half inch from my brain.\n\nThe next day, the three of us are rushed by choppers to the Sixty-Seventh Evacuation Hospital at Qui Nhon, where we undergo more surgeries.\n\nThe following day, April 25, 1967, my parents receive this message:\n\nWESTERN UNION TELEGRAM\n\nAPRIL 25, 1967\n\nMr. and Mrs. Ova M. Carpenter, don’t phone, report delivery\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy has asked me to express his deep regret that your son, PFC William D. Carpenter was placed on the seriously ill list in Vietnam on 23 April 67 as the result of gunshot wounds to left arm, left thigh, buttocks, facial fractures and loss of left eye. He was on reconnaissance patrol when hit by hostile small arms fire. In the judgment of the attending physician, his condition is of such severity that there is cause for concern, but no imminent danger of life. Please be assured that the best medical facilities and doctors have been made available and every measure is being taken to aid him. If there is a change in his condition you will be advised immediately. Address mail to him at 67th Evacuation Hospital, APO San Francisco 96238\n\nKenneth G Wickham Major General USA[10]\n\nThe next day, I’m moved to where Art and Geoff are. We learn that eight Vietcong bodies were found at the battle site.\n\nI come to again, and CPT James, LT Hall, and John Simones are standing by my bed. Privates salute officers, so I sit up and salute, say, “Hello, sir,” and go back to sleep.\n\nSometime later, a Donut Dolly wakes me. “Would you like to write a letter home?” she says.\n\n“I can’t. My left arm’s messed, and I’m left-handed.”\n\n“I’ll write it for you.”\n\n“I don’t know what to say.”\n\n“I’m sure you’ll think of something,” she says. I talk a little and go back to sleep, and when I wake up, she’s still sitting next to me. This happens repeatedly until, after some unknown number of starts, we have a letter to my family, letting them know I’m alive and being well looked after and will be coming home as soon as I’m stable.\n\nA few days later, I’m a little stronger and able to stay awake longer. I’m put on a stretcher and loaded onto a US Air Force four-engine C-141 Starlifter. The aircraft is a jet built to hold 155 paratroops, but it’s gutted and refitted to carry wounded. Eighty of us are stacked on metal racks three high, with several docs and nurses along to help us.\n\nI leave Vietnam completely naked, with only a thin blanket. I have served four days in the field, seen one firefight, and never fired my weapon. I don’t think I even had a chance to flick the safety off. (The average infantryman serving a one-year tour participates in several campaigns and battles, and the average LRRP pulls twenty-five to thirty missions.)[11]\n\nI have my pocketknife, Buck hunting knife, and one dog tag in a paper bag on my stretcher. I don’t know what happened to my other dog tag. These three items are my entire memorabilia from Vietnam except for some shrapnel in my body, and one .45-caliber submachine-gun slug still inside my head.[12]\n\nWe fly to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, where I spend one night in a hospital. The next morning, we’re off again to the closest hospital with beds available. It’s in Japan at Camp Zama, near Tokyo. This will be my eighth location in two months. My mail will never find me, and we can’t call home.\n\nThe next day, a Japanese woman comes to change my bed. She grabs the sheet I’m under and pulls it down. I’m still naked, so she hollers to another nurse to bring me pajamas. Later, I need to urinate, so I grab my IV stand and try to use it as a cane. The bathroom is only a few beds away, and I’m a LRRP, after all––I can walk that far. A medic sitting at a desk at the far end of the room yells, “Where ya goin’?” I tell him and he says, “Get back in bed. I’ll bring a pee jug.”\n\nLater, a medic wakes me. He wants me to sit up so they can x-ray my chest. Instead of wheeling me to X-ray, they bring a portable machine to my bed. “Why do you want to x-ray me?” I ask.\n\n“You’re not breathing well and you have a fever over a hundred and three.” They x-ray me, and I undergo a number of reconstructive surgeries.\n\nWeeks pass, and it’s Saturday, May 20. I’m at the debarkation center in Tokyo, awaiting my flight home, when up walks Geoff, our medic. He’s headed home and has somehow found me. He’s ambulatory, though he walks with a slump and has difficulty breathing. But we’re both alive. We make small talk, and he leaves to catch his flight. How can we sum up what happened?\n\nA bunch of us walking wounded are sitting on benches, waiting to board the plane. An air force one-star general comes and shakes each man’s hand, saying, “Thank you!” When he comes to me, I come to attention and he says, “Sit back down. I’m here to salute you, soldier!”\n\nTuesday, May 23, 1967, is my twenty-fifth birthday, and the C-141 I’m in lands in Denver. I’m finally home! A major gets on the plane and is looking for Private Carpenter. Uh-oh, I think, what’d I do? Majors don’t escort privates, but he does and I’m first off the plane.\n\nStanding at the bottom of the ramp is my entire family. My parents, Ova and Sarah, my older brother, Tom, and his wife, Ann, my older sister, Barbara, my younger sister, Carolyn, and my baby brother, Ronnie. Ann had raised hell with everyone until she learned from the Red Cross when I was returning.\n\nI’m forty-five pounds lighter and don’t look the same as the last time they saw me, two months ago. But I’m thrilled to be home again with everybody."
