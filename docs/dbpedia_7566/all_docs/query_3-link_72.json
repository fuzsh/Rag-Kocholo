A graduate of West Point with a doctorate from Princeton, Petraeus held leadership positions in airborne, mechanized, and air assault infantry units in Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. When President George W. Bush decided to change strategy in Iraq, he chose General Petraeus to lead the surge, turning around a seemingly hopeless situation. President Barack Obama called on him to lead U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. After 37 years of uniformed service, General Petraeus won the unanimous approval of the United States Senate to become the 20th Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Now retired from public life, he remains a sought-after authority on strategic leadership.",

        "text": "We’d like to learn something now about your early life. Could you tell us about your dad? What did he do for a living?\n\nDavid Petraeus: My dad was a Dutch merchant mariner who came to the United States when the Nazis overran Holland and his ship was at sea. They couldn’t obviously go back to Rotterdam, from which they’d sailed, and so they went into New York Harbor eventually. And virtually all of the crew signed on with the U.S. Merchant Marine, and that meant that they had a very long war. It was the service that had the highest per capita casualties in all of our military services. It was treated as part of the military at the time. The casualties were so high in fact that, although the United States could replace the ships — they were producing Liberty ships left and right — they actually couldn’t produce the crews. So very young officers ended up with very high responsibility. My father was actually the captain of a Liberty ship at the age of 29. They did a Murmansk run that took them to northern Russia. They lost a huge number of ships in the convoy. So it was very hazardous war for him. He ultimately then — he met my mother in Brooklyn during that time and they ultimately settled in the Hudson River Valley, about 50 miles north of New York City, in a little village called Cornwall-on-Hudson. It’s quintessential small town America, seven miles around Storm King Mountain from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. My dad ultimately left the sea because at that time they were expected to sail for 11 months straight and then get one month off. Like any good ship captain, he knew how to generate power. That’s what’s done, obviously, to power a ship. So a number of them all went into the booming industry of new electrical generation stations that were being created all over America as part of the post-war boom. He was an operating room engineer — supervisory engineer — at one of those, about ten miles from our house.\n\nMy dad was really a crusty old Dutch sea captain at heart, even though by the time I was arrived in the world, if you will, he had already taken up his new career. His attitude was one of results, boy. And he was not a guy who looked kindly on excuses. I mean, he was a very loving father — and occasionally a bit of gruff love — but again, very devoted, as my mother was to both of their children. Extraordinarily so, in truth. I mean, there was nothing they would not do for either of us. But we had a sailboat the whole time that I was growing up. We actually had two for a while. I had a sailboat, about a 20-footer. It was not a trivial little Sunfish. It was a real sailing boat. And it was a great experience to do that. He was very supportive of, obviously, the academic endeavors, but also of various athletic endeavors. He taught me how to ski. He took me to games. We did all kinds of different activities. In fact, even around the house, we had… I mean, this is an incredible… it was a very small, little — again, small town America — house built right after World War II. But we had a high bar for doing pull-ups. We had a rope under a tree that you could climb. We had a pitcher’s mound and a backstop for baseball. We had a little croquet golf course with coffee cans in it. We had a croquet set. We had lawn darts. You know, there was every — we had a basketball backboard and net. And even in the basement, we were using little two-by-fours, we could play floor hockey, because I also skated and played hockey over the years. But eventually I settled in on soccer and on skiing, downhill skiing. I played both of those all the way through college.\n\nThat sounds like boot camp at home.\n\nDavid Petraeus: No, it was great fun actually. Some of this was just being creative. We were just a sort of typical middle class family. We weren’t rolling in money. My mother was really focused at home. She did work at the local library part-time. But again, it was a household of modest means, but one that focused a great deal on school, on academics. And they both were very significant intellectuals. They both loved to read. In fact, the house was overflowing with books. My mother had, I think, at one point in time, three or four full sets of Dickens, for example, from secondhand bookstores. The joy in life for them was to go and — they had a big camper — and they’d go around the country. And if you found a secondhand bookstore on the way, that was a special, special day.\n\nYou went with them on these trips?\n\nDavid Petraeus: Some, at a certain point in time. They really did a great deal of that after they retired as well. But when I was growing up, we would usually have one-week or maybe even two-week vacations a summer. And one of those would always end up at Boston. We would recreate the route that Paul Revere followed and visit the North Church, and we’d go to Lexington Green, and we’d go to Concord and “the rude bridge that arched the flood.” And we’d read all the stirring novels. “Here the embattled farmer stood and fired the shot heard ’round the world,” and all of that. If you fast forward some 50-some-odd years, I commissioned our son as a Second Lieutenant in the Infantry in the U.S. Army at the Minuteman Statue in Concord, right by the bridge. It was really a special moment.\n\nI believe you placed jump wings belonging to your father-in-law.\n\nDavid Petraeus: Actually, we had done that before, because he went to jump school as a cadet. In fact, it was interesting, because I was back for what might have been the most emotionally-charged hearings that any military commander and diplomat — Ambassador Ryan Crocker — had in recent memory. These were the hearings of September 2007 on the surge. It was our first opportunity to report that we were actually making progress in the surge, although it had not been apparent back in Washington at that point in time. In fact, a vote to cut off funding for Iraq was only narrowly defeated by two votes. So that was an interesting moment. Then we went down to Fort Benning, Georgia for our son’s final jump. We were on the drop zone. Then we went to a Ranger graduation and I spoke at that. They had the ceremony to pin on jump wings, and I got to pin my father-in-law’s jump wings on him, which was a special moment.\n\nIt certainly indicated that you had a visceral concept of what was at stake with American lives.\n\nDavid Petraeus: Obviously I did. Command and combat is a fairly grinding endeavor. I occasionally would play with folks a little bit. They’d say, “What is it like to be the commander of the surge, to command all these forces in Iraq and these big missions?” And I’d say, “It’s the most unbelievably awesome experience that you can possibly imagine on a good day, but there aren’t many good days.”\n\nWhat books were important to you growing up or that you particularly liked?\n\nDavid Petraeus: We had a lot of history books around. We had the Landmark series as you’re growing up. An awful lot of those were very attractive. And reading about the old frontiersmen, West Pointers, and so forth. And really growing up in a town — gosh, half the people on the newspaper route that I had. In those days, kids still delivered newspapers, and I had 40 or 50 customers or something. And half of them were either West Point graduates or employed at West Point. So it had a huge influence in our community. My math teachers in high school, one of them was a former professor of math at West Point. Our high school soccer coach had actually coached the West Point team when it won the national championship some couple of decades earlier, when he was a younger officer. He coached our team for a dollar a year, and we actually did win the championship in my senior year, which is sort of… That’s one of those “Glory Days” moments, that Bruce Springsteen sings about. It’s pretty extraordinary really. The whole town follows you to the game, follows the bus back. It was a real thrill.\n\nWhen did you see yourself in the military or at West Point?\n\nDavid Petraeus: I guess it was a few years into high school or so, looking at the different options. To be candid, my mom was not all that enamored of the idea. She had gone to Oberlin. She was a very liberal arts kind of person. She saw this as a bit of a rough-and-tumble affair and wanted her son to have the — I don’t know, slightly perhaps more academic approach, whatever it may be, noting that West Point is typically assessed to be one of the top ten or 20 schools in America. So they were very proud, obviously, when I got an appointment to West Point and went there. They were there for the first day and many, many other times after that. But I think she had really wanted me to go to a small private liberal arts school. Colgate, or one of those kinds of colleges. I did consider those, and I applied to some of those and was accepted. But at the end of the day, there was something about those I knew who had been to West Point. If you really think about why people do what they do in life, it’s often that they want to “be like Mike,” if you will. You know, they see Michael Jordan. “I want to be like him.” You see Captain Carpenter, and he earns the Distinguished Service Cross in the battlefield in Vietnam, which I remembered delivering the newspaper that had his picture on it when he came back from that. He had married a local girl and so forth. Those that I knew who had gone to West Point, the graduates, those who were working there, it just seemed to be an awfully special place. And it is. It was and it is. I count myself very lucky to have gone down that course.\n\nDid you feel a sense of patriotism at an early age? You mentioned following the trail of Paul Revere and visiting Lexington and Concord.\n\nDavid Petraeus: Yeah, there’s a bit of this. There’s a certain romantic view of some of this as well, a slightly heroic image. My mother also made me one summer read a book called The Royal Road to Romance by Richard Halliburton, which was about a Princeton graduate, one of the reasons I actually went to Princeton for graduate school. He was quite an adventurer. He was one of those who, when he got out of college, instead of going into the family financial business or whatever, he went on a tramp steamer and went to Europe and did all these different exploits. He swam the Hellespont like Byron. He ran the original marathon, although he got drunk in the final two miles. He climbed the Matterhorn by himself. Many of these were quite significant accomplishments in their day.\n\nWhen you raise your right hand and take the oath on the plain at West Point — noting that that’s pretty quickly dispelled and you get into the normal routine — Groundhog Day sets in pretty quickly. It does in any profession. Perhaps for those — the delegates at an Academy event — I used to note on occasion that even in the loftiest of positions — I mean, you could be the commander of the surge, a commander of Central Com, the Director of the CIA — there is a Groundhog Day syndrome that does set in. It doesn’t matter how high you are, you start to get into this, “Man, today is going to be just like yesterday, and tomorrow looks like it’s going to be as well.” Maybe different Congressional visitors, different press, different activities. In truth, it’s not, but you get into that. Particularly, frankly, in military and combat, because you’re going seven days a week. There’s very little time of your own at all. You read a couple of pages of a book each night before you fall asleep with the light still on. So it’s important, I think. I used to say that when this happens to you — the people with whom I was privileged to serve at the time or whatever — occasionally, you want to go on up to 30,000 feet and do a little out-of-body experience and look down at what you’re doing, and look down at the endeavor in which you’re playing a part, and realize how special that is. What a privilege that is to be serving a cause larger than self, a mission that really is important, not just to our country but to all of the coalition countries. And then get on back down and go to work.\n\nAt West Point, you pursued a very elite academic strategy, which was the pre-med.\n\nDavid Petraeus: Yes, it was. I really enjoyed the chemistry class that we had. I guess it was the first semester of second year or maybe the second semester of first year, but it was early on. I decided to take some more. Interestingly, the roommate that I had most of the time that I was there at West Point was doing pre-med. He did eventually become an Army doctor and served as a colonel. I really enjoyed those courses very much. This is a very competitive program. One percent of the class was allowed to compete to go to medical school. If you got into that one percent, which I think was nine people in the end, you were guaranteed a slot in the medical school. It has a very good program. And the Army took care of everything, so there was a great deal of interest in it. But in the latter part of the first semester of senior year, I realized I was about number five or so. You knew what everyone else’s grades were in those days. They were all posted.\n\nI asked myself if I really had a calling to be a doctor or not, and I actually couldn’t answer in the affirmative, so I decided maybe I shouldn’t do that, because there’s a huge commitment attached to it. I thought it would be difficult if you actually get into it then and say, “Geez, why did I do this?” It was just because it was the highest mountain to climb academically. So I sort of had the peak in sight, but then I decided to seek the infantry and I enjoyed it very much. Again, there was an interesting mix. I always found in the Army, in fact, a very interesting mix between the intellectual and the physical. The infantry clearly had both of those. You can be literally out under a rucksack in field conditions one year, and you’re at graduate school at Princeton University the next. Or you’re writing speeches for the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO one year, and the next year you’re the Operations Officer for an infantry battalion right on the Iron Curtain. So I loved that mix back and forth and found it very, very stimulating.\n\nTell us about your training as a Ranger.\n\nDavid Petraeus: We all wanted to go to Ranger School if you were an infantry lieutenant, or at least you should. I set my sights on that and tried to prepare as well as I could. Frankly, I was really in extraordinary physical condition when I went there. What was grinding to some really was not to me. It sort of plays to the strengths of a guy who can run and carry a rucksack and all the rest of the stuff. So that was a piece of cake. My Ranger buddy and I — who was a West Point classmate of mine — approached this as a very competitive endeavor. So we were the first ones through in the land navigation course. This is at night with everything else. Then you’re doing a lot of leadership stuff and leading patrols and helping others with that. It’s very, very demanding physically. In those days, you ended up with a final two-week period in the field in the swamps of Florida. You actually start in Georgia, you then go to the mountains of Georgia. We did it in January, which is a brutal time to be in Dahlonega, North Georgia. It’s quite a bit of altitude and there’s a lot of snow on the ground. It’s almost a physical survival kind of endeavor at certain points in time, if it starts to flirt with zero degrees and you’re out there day after day and the exposure starts to accumulate for a lot of people. The first-time pass rate, I think probably was below 50 percent, maybe even 40 percent in Winter Ranger (school). We ended up in the swamps, and you go two weeks where you have one meal a day. People lose 30-35 pounds in those days. Well, that nonsense was stopped. That’s just foolish physiologically. But you get so tired that you can fall asleep standing up. We literally had people that just started to have some form of delusions, and we had to put a sling rope on them, what you use for mountain climbing, which we always carried with us. We’d put a sling rope on them and we just pulled them through the swamps. You’re in water up to your thigh or waist a good bit of the time, even when you’re not actually in the rivers and doing river crossing or operations like that. So it’s very, very challenging. I was fortunate and had a couple of breaks, and I ended up number one in the class. There were three awards in those days, and I took all three of them. It was a nice day. Even though my wife didn’t recognize me. She thought I looked like somebody out of a refugee camp after having gone through this experience.\n\nOne of those was the William O. Darby Award, wasn’t it?\n\nDavid Petraeus: Yes, it was. They didn’t award that to every class. It was just when they thought they should, and they did that particular time.\n\nYou’ve experienced very demanding physical discipline, at West Point and as an Army Ranger. Would you also say there’s always been an intellectual component to your approach as a military leader?\n\nDavid Petraeus: I think that’s an accurate depiction. I did always cherish, frankly, physical fitness activities, various sports. Frankly, competitions. In fact, we used to have a saying in many of the units which I served, “Life is a competitive endeavor.” There’s nothing more competitive, obviously, than combat. I had a captain walk in one time when I was a lieutenant colonel, a battalion commander. He was this incredibly inspirational company commander. He had a great sense of humor as well. He walked into the office and he said, “Sir, winners win stuff every now and then.” And I said, “That’s very profound, Fred. Thank you very much.” But he was exactly right. And we tried, we did our best. Now occasionally you have to compete to be the best team player you can be in a collective organization. So you want to compete fairly. You want to compete. When you don’t bring home the gold, you’ve got to be graceful in defeat as well as in victory. So there was always a physical piece to that. In fact, I just had a run along the water here in San Francisco, six miles — it was awesome — and hit the gym. There is something about that that I think is terrific. But there is the affinity for, I guess, the intellectual side of it, for the thinking side of it, for trying to identify the right big ideas. They may be new big ideas. They may be old big ideas. But it has to be the right strategy. It has to be the right approach. And I did put a fair amount into that.\n\nWhen I was a three-star commander out of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, it was the year that we did the Counterinsurgency Field Manual. We had all the pre-command course students there, so I would talk to them for 90 minutes each time. It was once a month. It was all the future battalion and brigade commanders, and their command sergeants major as well. I would ask them how many had written this command philosophy letter that everybody wrote. And, you know, all hands. And how some had done 20 drafts. And I used to say, “Tear it up. They’re meaningless.” You know, it was a big blow to them. “My God, tear up my command philosophy?” So one page usually — they’re all the same. It says “Mission first, troops always,” somewhere in there. Some are more eloquent than others. And I said, “Instead, focus on what the big five areas of focus are going to be for your unit. And don’t just identify them, then figure out what are the actual programs that will operationalize those areas of focus.” So if you say, again, physical fitness, which is a pretty good big five if you’re, say, an air assault or airborne infantry unit, as I was privileged to command. What does that mean? What are the standards? What’s the standard for a four-mile run? For various other events? How often do you road march? How do you earn excellence? What happens if someone is inadequate, is in a sense, deficient? What are the penalties? What are the rewards? What are the incentives? What are the various activities, the components? Oh, by the way, is it more than just sort of physical training? Is it also, perhaps, health? Smoking cessation is a big one that we used to focus on. No dipping was another one, believe it or not. It was a huge epidemic for a while.\n\nThat’s fascinating.\n\nDavid Petraeus: In infantry units, in particular. Use of alcohol and so forth. How do you, again, operationalize this, and spend time on that? That takes serious thinking and a huge amount of very, very hard work. It’s not easy. I’ve often said that big ideas don’t hit you on the head like Newton’s apple if you sit under the right tree. You have to really work at them. You get hit by a little seed of a big idea, and you involve as many people in it as you can. It’s an inclusive process. Then, like someone with clay, you shape it. You try it. You throw it at the wall and see if it sticks. But that’s how you ultimately arrive at good big ideas.\n\nYou had a meeting with General John Galvin when you were still in your twenties, and he talks about remembering you very well because you escorted him to the base outside Savannah. He had some changes in mind that he wanted to implement. Can you tell us about your response to those changes he had in mind?\n\nDavid Petraeus: Actually, what he was trying to do was to develop his big ideas. He was going to be the Division Commander of the 24th Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia, where I’d been assigned for two-and-a-half years. I’d commanded a company, and then I was a Battalion Operations Officer, which is normally a position for a major, and my Battalion Commander wanted me to do it as a captain, with just about a year-and-a-half time in grade.\n\nSo they were looking for an aide for the new Division Commander, and the one-star said that, “Here’s a nominee for you,” and so he picked me. So he arrives and he said, “I’m sort of thinking through. Do you have any thoughts on what I might do here?” And as only a young — I guess idealistic — captain can do when you’re very serious and earnest, I put a lot of work in this. I wrote a big memo that talked about big personnel changes in certain areas, some very significant different ways of doing business, if you will, than his predecessor had. And I remember he called me into the office and he said, “Are there any more copies of this?” I said, “No, sir.” This is back in the days of typewriters. And he said, “Good.” He said, “This is very, very good, but I don’t want it going out anywhere.” Ultimately, he actually took about every action that was in this. Again, some of these were very significant changes in personnel. And I’m not saying.. I mean, some of those were self-evident, I would assume, as well to him. But what it began was a relationship that was really quite extraordinary. I spent that year as his aide and it was a wonderful experience. He was very much a soldier-scholar — and ultimately, statesman as well — in his four-star assignments as the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Southern Command, all of Latin America, and then the NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. I worked for him again as a temporary duty Special Assistant in Panama, where the headquarters was for Southern Command, traveled with him all that summer. And then, when he was named the next Supreme Allied Commander, he requested that I be released from West Point a year early, where I was teaching, and go over there and spend this first year with him as a speechwriter. The truth is, we had a correspondence that continued forever. I might add, I am literally right now finalizing the foreword for a book — this will be his memoirs — Memoirs of a Cold Warrior.\n\nWe’ve been doing it together, to a degree, and it just reminded me of what a joy it was to work for him. He was a speechwriter as well, earlier in his life. He was an English professor. He had written three books. He was really quite an extraordinary individual. He was highly decorated on the battlefield in Vietnam, but was also known for very calm forthright responses to senior officers, one of which got him fired and he still survived.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nDavid Petraeus: It was a case where a very senior commander came in after a battle. He (Galvin) was a major, and the senior commander said, “I see all these — it looks like about this number of bodies.” And the major said, “Sir, actually, it’s not that many.” And he stuck to that and he was reassigned. God bless him. He was a very — again, a very low ego — but there were moments where he could be very, very determined in a very forthright way. I saw this during the years when he was the Supreme Allied Commander in particular. It was quite an experience to be, to a degree, at his right hand. I might add, when I took that job I said, “There are conditions for me to take it.” Again, only a major could dream up conditions for working for the Supreme Allied Commander. But I told his Executive Officer, “Brigadier General,” I said, “I have to hear the speech if I write it. So I have to travel with him. I have to be in the car with him on the way to the speech. I know him personally. I know what it takes to get him fired up if it’s been a really long day. I know how to get him focused, get him in the zone, and all the rest of this stuff. And I don’t want someone else in there, and then he arrives in the wrong sort of frame of mind and not in that zone.” And then I said, “We have to get some computers and automation.” The NATO headquarters was way behind the times at that moment and that was an easy one. But it was a great experience and it continued for years and years. And in a day when people sent correspondence back and forth, we had sent two- and three-page, single-spaced letters to each other every couple of weeks, really. He was a great correspondent. He was a fabulous mentor. He was very generous with his time. He was wonderfully considerate of others. He had a wry sense of humor, and he could see things in other people, and then we’d compare notes afterwards. We’d be bumping along the trail in Fort Stewart, Georgia there, going on an exercise and quoting Kipling’s “Tommy” to each other.\n\nWould you say General Galvin was the most important influence in your life and career?\n\nDavid Petraeus: General Galvin was a huge influence. He was, I think, the most wonderful mentor anybody could have and certainly the most wonderful I had. And I had a lot of great ones over the years. I think about General Vuono and General Keane, General Shelton, General McNeill, all these. And then some below me, if you will. A command sergeant major or a first sergeant. I was very privileged to serve with some extraordinary individuals, some above me, some peers, some subordinates in the chain of command.\n\nOne hallmark of your military career has been the ability to communicate well. Do you stress that in your teaching? The importance of being an effective communicator?\n\nDavid Petraeus: Yes. This course that I teach now at the Honors College of the City University of New York, after two semesters, the students have all agreed that what they got out of it most of all, the most important skill or knowledge they got, was writing and briefing of all things. In fact, there’s a delegate here who I think is one of the only students who got an A plus in that course. They actually bring him back to teach the other students in the first session of each semester how to write a policy paper and how to give a Power Point briefing. We work that quite hard. In fact, some of the students get to do it more than once because they’re honor students. I don’t want them to have a grade that would be less than what we would expect of honor students, so they occasionally get a second or even a third chance. Although at a certain point you have to call them like they are.\n\nYou did some very in-depth writing about Vietnam when you were in graduate school at Princeton. Could you tell us how looking at that conflict influenced your later thoughts about strategy?\n\nDavid Petraeus: Sure. The dissertation was titled “The American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam.” It looked at how Vietnam influenced the senior military leadership in giving advice to the President, Secretary of Defense and other civilian leaders, on the use of force. Whether you should or should not, and if so, how it should be applied. It was a very useful exercise in a host of different ways. One, it taught me more about how to communicate, how to write. I was very privileged to have as my senior dissertation adviser an individual who had been at the editorial page of The New York Times. He was a Harvard Rhodes Scholar, Oxford Ph.D. under George Kennan. He was the Head of Studies of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was the Editor of Foreign Policy magazine at the time that I was working with him at Princeton.\n\nWhat was his name?\n\nDavid Petraeus: Richard Ullman. An extraordinary individual. In fact, one who gave a tremendous amount of himself. We just had the memorial ceremony for him recently, and it was astonishing the number of people who were there overall. And then, second, what many of those people had achieved — national security advisers, trade representatives, generals, titans of the financial industry, you name it. All of us felt an enormous debt of gratitude to him for the time he gave to us. It’s something we’ve tried to do for others as well.\n\nI specifically chose a topic that I thought would help me develop intellectual capital that I might use later on in my career. So I didn’t want to do something about the Peloponnesian War or the Revolutionary War or something. I wanted it to be a bit more current and to get at the most important issue that senior military leaders ever confront in their careers, if they confront it at all. And that is the issue of military advice on the use of force. So there I was, years later, working for the Supreme Allied Commander, working for the Chief of Staff of the Army, and ultimately as the Executive Officer for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when we were doing Bosnia, Kosovo, strikes against Saddam Hussein, strikes on Osama bin Laden and all the rest. And I could bring back up the lessons that I’d learned in looking at the lessons of Vietnam that military leaders took. What was the character of their advice? What was it that again led to that advice? What were the factors on which they drew? When it came time, when I was the one actually offering a recommendation and options to two different Presidents in two different wars, I found that a very, very useful study.\n\nThe job of a military commander, in combat in the field in particular, is to provide the President his best professional military advice based on his understanding of the mission that he’s developed with the President in that context, in those conditions, in that battlefield, informed by an awareness of the issues with which the President has to deal that the commander doesn’t have to deal with directly. So you know, you have to acknowledge there are national politics, Congressional politics, coalition politics, fiscal deficits, strain on the force, programs, you name it. But at the end of the day, that advice is based on — is driven by — the facts on the ground. There was a moment where — and I reminded each President of this at some key moments — in one moment, I did not change my recommendation after several meetings, to the surprise of some of those in the room who were all changing or at least agreeing to a new forthcoming decision. It didn’t mean that I didn’t support the decision fully, publicly, and so forth. But it did mean that my recommendation was unchanged. That was, at least to me, an issue of integrity.\n\nIn some circles there was an attitude that, “We just got out of Vietnam sooner than we should have because of popular opinion.” Is that what you found?\n\nDavid Petraeus: There were a lot of different theories. A lot of different handy conclusions, if you will. The “stab in the back,” that if it weren’t for the press or the civilian leadership, we would have won. When perhaps, in truth, it might have been that we didn’t have the right strategy at the right time. Really, it went on for quite a long time with a very high level of casualties.\n\nThere were a lot of lessons out of Vietnam and, as I mentioned, I tried to draw on those and particularly with this very, very important one, about when it really comes down to it, and you’re sitting at the Situation Room in the West Wing, and the eyes go to you and you’re the commander of that particular theater. That’s a fairly big moment. It helps if you’ve thought it through, if you have an intellectual construct for what your responsibilities are. Because I’ve seen others do differently. I had, one time, someone above me who, rather than focusing on the military advice in commenting on what I had recommended right before him, said, “Well, I’m not sure Congress will buy this,” or something like that. The President’s response was, “Let me worry about Congress. What do you think of the military aspects of this?” And that was exactly right.\n\nThat brings up a more difficult question. How do you deal with officers — subordinates — who are not able to perform as you would wish? You’ve given some very demanding assignments, and not everybody is up to them.\n\nDavid Petraeus: We had some units that took very, very tough losses and very tough casualties.\n\nHow do you deal with that?\n\nDavid Petraeus: There was a unit in Baghdad, for example, that I decided needed to be moved from the location in which it was positioned because it just couldn’t take any more of that level of combat. And so what we did — and you don’t — I’ve never been one who believes in public executions, if you will. You know, public firings. I’ve always thought that you ought to try to allow a person to have as much dignity and respect as is possible, even if, frankly, you’re replacing the individual, or clearly recognize that this individual should not progress further. But there’s no reason, I don’t think, to be harsh in that kind of activity. There’s no reason you can’t try to make the individual — at least allow them to retain as much of his own dignity, and self-respect as well, as is possible. So we did what — in that case, we did a battlefield geometry re-examination, and we decided we’d shift some units around, and it was part of a big shift. As opposed to saying, “This unit can’t take it anymore.”\n\nIt seems like executing these ideas requires not only discipline, but creativity, and a sense of trust in yourself. Is that so?\n\nDavid Petraeus: Yes, but you have to be careful not to take that too far. You can’t trust yourself to the point where you think you’re infallible. I’ve tried to work on that pretty hard. You’ve got to try to keep your ego in check. It can lead you down the wrong path at times. Again, you are constantly looking… and, of course, if you get sufficiently senior, folks tend to say, “Yes, sir,” not “Excuse me, have you really thought about this?” So you also actually have to try to foster a command climate — a culture, if you will — in your collective unit. That is one that welcomes people being forthright, and you’re not committing professional suicide if you raise your hand and challenge the boss. It’s okay to say, “Emperor, you know, you’re scantily clothed today intellectually.” That’s very, very important to do.\n\nGalvin did this amazingly well. Galvin used to have me do a monthly performance evaluation of him. I mean, I’m a young captain, mid-rank captain, he’s a two-star general with extraordinary accomplishment already. And he said, “Every month I want you to give me an efficiency report, an evaluation.” And, again, as only a young captain can, you took it seriously. And I would grade every one of his speeches. I flunked him one time. We had a huge fight over this. I said, “Sir, you didn’t want to be there. You communicated that effectively to your audience and it was deficient.” Oh, my God! “But we all wish you could work this out.” And, again, you don’t normally — you do this in an affirmative way. In fact, I’m a believer in affirmative leadership. In other words, as opposed to saying, “Hey, you better get that report in on Monday close of business or I’ll have your backside.” Instead, you say, “Hey, I look forward to confirming your excellence on Monday. I know this is going to be a great report, and I’m really looking forward to seeing that on my desk and to going through it. It’s going to be terrific.” Now you’ve made the same point. “Get the report on my desk on Monday without fail.” But again, the kind of affirmative rather than negative leadership, I think, is very important.\n\nPeople constantly ask folks who have risen to a certain level about their leadership style. And so they say, “General…” or “Director, can you describe to me your leadership style?” And they presumably want to hear, “Well, I’m hard but fair,” or “I’m a really good guy,” or “I’m a…” whatever it may be. And I’d say, “Actually, I’ll tell you what my leadership style is for each of my direct reports and for the organization collectively, if you’ll tell me what style of leadership is required for each of those direct reports and the organization collectively to help each be all that he or she or it can be.” Because the truth is every organization’s different, every person’s different. I might need guidance twice a day. Someone else might need guidance twice a year. I need pats on the back every half-hour. Others don’t need anything. Some may need an application of a foot somewhere. But you have to understand each individual and your style with each individual is slightly differentiated. The leadership style that works, what I tried to do at the CIA, for example, is a very different leadership style than what works as a romping, stomping infantry platoon leader, where it’s literally, “Follow me,” and again, a fairly visceral experience. The Agency is a combination of very highly developed analytical folks and superb operators. Again, you have to be all things to all people if you’re going to lead effectively, I think.\n\nYou have to be a bit of a psychologist too, don’t you?\n\nDavid Petraeus: You have to be that too. You have to do it for yourself as well, because you’ve got to motivate yourself. You’ve got to get out of bed every day. As Bill McRaven says, “Success starts by making your bed in the morning.” Everything after that? So. Actually, for me it was dragging yourself out and getting that workout in, especially in combat. I’d get up at five or so and get a cup of coffee and go through overnight stuff that had come in, and reports and so forth from the battlefield intel and everything else. And then hop on a stationary bike that was actually in our complex usually, and pedal away for 45 or 60 minutes, if it wasn’t a run day. We tried to run a few days a week in both Iraq and Afghanistan. But it’s tough. You know, the problem in a combat situation in particular is, again, because it’s seven days a week and it really is sort of 24 hours a day, or it’s at least 18 hours a day. You’re on the edge of what you can physically handle. You’re right at it and you’re trying not to go over the edge, because if you go over the edge, you start falling asleep in meetings when people are briefing you. And that’s not a good place to be. You’re also not as coherent as you ought to be. I reached points during the fight to Baghdad where I couldn’t stay awake unless I stood up. And I mean, you’re the commander of the division. This is a foolish position to find yourself. In fact, God bless the command sergeant major. He’d sort of put his arm around your shoulder and say, “Sir, you’re not very good to any of us right now. Why don’t you let the one-star take this for a while and you go down and I’ll wake you up in five hours or something like that, or four hours.” But you’re right at the edge of what you can handle physically, and if you get a long phone call at night, or you get something and you don’t go back to bed, or you’re turning it over, you’re right at the edge of that. So for one thing, physical fitness helps you a great deal. But boy, it’s tough sometimes to contemplate that when the alarm clock goes off.\n\nWhat do you see as the next great challenge militarily?\n\nDavid Petraeus: We have a challenge in which we’re just embarking, of course, in Iraq and in Syria. The President, I felt, made a very compelling case for the threat that the Islamic State poses to the region, to our allies, and ultimately to us. I think he had a very convincing argument for the need to take action to combat that threat. And then he provided a good point of departure for the strategy that we will now follow. But this is going to be a different approach. I think it’s an approach that can achieve its goals in Iraq. Actually, I think we may be underestimating the capabilities of the Iraqi forces based on the reverses, the collapses that we saw in the north where they didn’t have good planning, competent leadership, and they didn’t have the enablers that we can provide: close air support, intelligence support, and so forth. Frankly, it’s going to be very challenging in Syria. This is going to be hugely difficult, and that’s where we’re going to need the next big ideas.\n\nYou were in government service for a long time. Could you tell us a little about what you’ve been doing since you left?\n\nI served for 37 years in the U.S. Army. I then served as the Director of the CIA. Since leaving government in late 2012, I have become the Chairman of the KKR Global Institute, a visiting professor of public policy at the Honors College of the City University of New York, the Judge Whitney Professor at the University of Southern California, a non-resident Senior Fellow at Harvard University, and also the co-chairman of a Council on Foreign Relations task force on North America with Bob Zoellick, the former World Bank President.\n\nSo you’re not retired.\n\nDavid Petraeus: No, by no means retired.\n\nWhat is the course you teach at City University?\n\nDavid Petraeus: It’s “The Coming North American Decades.” And this is founded — you look at all the economies of the world, you then gradually focus in on North America. All the others are either slowing down, treading water, experiencing reverses. This has been what we call an “asynchronous recovery” for the world, and the United States is recovering at this point in time. I think it’s established now, and I think it’s gaining momentum. This is a result of the kind of spirit of innovativeness, inquiry. Our system, if you will, that has led to the energy revolution, the IT revolution — which enabled all the others — the manufacturing revolution. And now the beginning life sciences revolution. Our country is quite extraordinary. We face a lot of headwinds. We need those in Washington, the elected officials, to help us deal with the debt-to-GDP ratio, with the education reform, comprehensive immigration reform, infrastructure investment. A whole host of topics that need to be addressed that could turn into tailwinds to our economy, rather than impeding the progress that is going to be made because of these revolutions and because of the system and so forth. But we need that help there. Perhaps some of the delegates can at some point assume some of those positions and help us do that.\n\nThe American Dream is still alive.\n\nDavid Petraeus: It is very much so, yes.\n\nThank you, General, for your time and your service.\n\nDavid Petraeus: My pleasure."
