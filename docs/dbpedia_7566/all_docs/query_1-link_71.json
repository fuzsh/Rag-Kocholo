        "text": "Ohio State Senator William O. Collins, a proponent of war funding after the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, took a stronger stand for the Union by raising a regiment of cavalry in southern Ohio, known as the 7th Ohio Cavalry. Before the full regiment could be organized, it combined with the 6th Ohio Cavalry, and Collins became the commander.\n\nIn January 1862, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck ordered the 6th Ohio and Collins to report to Benton Barrack at St. Louis, but just after they arrived they were ordered first to Nebraska City, Nebraska, and then on west to Fort Laramie, where their assignment was to guard the Overland Mail.\n\nIn time, the Ohio troops combined with additional companies until, by the spring of 1863, the 6th Ohio became the 11th Ohio. These troops patrolled along the route of overland pioneers and the overland mail at a critical time during the nation’s history.\n\nThe Ohio troops spent little time at Fort Kearny, but that is where our trip begins. This post, established in 1847, had buildings made of adobe and wood and included a post office—which was very important to travelers who could send a letter home—as well as a telegraph station, barracks and a large storehouse.\n\nA couple of miles west of Fort Kearny, Dobytown housed a community of business entrepreneurs who sold liquor and goods, and operated establishments for gambling and where soiled doves plied their services."
