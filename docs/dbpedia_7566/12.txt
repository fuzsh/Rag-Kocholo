ELEVENTH OHIO VOLUNTEER CAVALRY.

Toward the close of the summer of 1861, William O. COLLINS, of Highland county, was authorized to recruit a regiment of cavalry to be named the Seventh; but about the first of December the enlistment of cavalry was stopped. The Seventh was then joined to the Sixth, taking the latter's name. The battalion from the Seventh being ready for service, was ordered to St. Louis, Missouri, leaving the other two in Ohio and never meeting them again. While the battalion first named was at Benton Barracks, the Indians becoming hostile, it was ordered to proceed at once across the plains to open and protect communication. The command reached Fort Laramie on the thirtieth of May, having travelled seven hundred miles in twenty-six marching days. While on their way, they were fired upon by guerillas, and suffered greatly from exposure; but the Indian trouble being still farther west, with the exception of a few kept at the fort, they were moved on to the mountains. At last they were established near Pacific Springs and the South Pass, about two hundred miles east of Salt Lake City. In the summer of 1863, Lieutenant Colonel COLLINS recruited another battalion for duty in the Rocky mountains. The two battalions were raised to a regiment, and were named the Eleventh Ohio volunteer cavalry. The second battalion was in Ohio at the time of the MORGAN raid, and shared in the pursuit and capture of the invaders. It reached Fort Leavenworth about the last of August, and arrived at Fort Laramie the thirteenth of October, 1863. On the first of April, 1865, the First battalion was mustered out at Omaha, and the remaining companies were returned to Columbus for payment, in July, 1866. They were the last troops in the service from Ohio. Of the service of this regiment, it is impossible to give an outline. A complete history would be full of startling incidents and hairbreadth escapes. Its loss of life fully

equaled the average loss of life in other Ohio cavalry regiments. Its most important battles were those of Mud Springs and Rush Creek. The length of its expeditions, by scouting and escorting parties, was probably not paralleled in any other service during the war. To make the circuit of the posts required one thousand miles' travel; and to keep up communication with the most distant was at times extremely difficult and dangerous. The regiment was never actually together during its term of service. It was engaged with the Sioux, Snakes, Cheyennes, Arrapahoes, and Utes. The field of its operations was in the center of the Rocky mountains, extending nearly six hundred miles east and west, and three hundred north and south. No better evidence of the regiment's courage and vigilance can be had than the fact that after the distribution of troops in the summer of 1862, until February, 1865, communications were never interrupted on either route for twenty-four hours in succession.
