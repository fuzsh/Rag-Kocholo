        "text": "More from the Artist: Chico Hamilton |\n\nProduct type: Second Hand vinyl\n\nComments: Record has lots of shallow hairlines and marks. Residue from tape on edges. Wear on spine.\n\nMedia Condition: Very Good (VG)\n\nSleeve Condition: Very Good (VG)\n\nLabel: Pacific Jazz |\n\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, 10\", Album\n\nCountry: US\n\nRelease Year: 1955\n\nGenre: Jazz |\n\nStyle: Cool Jazz |\n\nRelease ID: r4759777\n\nWhen you buy second hand vinyl records from Djungel & Jazz, you should always feel secure in our grade and comments of the product's condition. Normally we do not sell vinyl records where the grade of the media is below VG condition, however, we can sell sleeves with a slightly lower grade, with the argument that you don't listen to the sleeve.\n\nThe majority of our records are visually graded. In many cases, we also listen to the record, and you will find our verdict on the condition of the vinyl record in the comments. If necessary, we wash the disc in our ultrasonic washer and place it in a new antistatic inner sleeve.\n\nWe always try to mention the details and deviations that are essential to know about each individual vinyl record. Please read the comments for the rationale for our grading of the specific vinyl record.\n\nBelow is a brief explanation of how we grade vinyl records and record sleeves. Should a record be incorrectly graded by us, Djungel & Jazz offers a Grading Guarantee that allows you to return the record and receive a full refund. Please read more about our Grading Guarantee and how to proceed here.\n\nMint (M)\n\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Probably never played, possibly even still sealed.\n\nNear Mint (NM or M-)\n\nAn NM or M- record has probably hardly ever been played and the vinyl will play absolutely flawlessly, without any interference during playback. We are sparing with higher ratings than this, as we believe that no record is ever completely perfect. The record should not show any obvious signs of use.\n\nPossible signs of light handling may be present to the sleeve. An LP cover should not have creases, folds, cracks in the seams, punched holes or other noticeable similar defects.\n\nVery Good Plus (VG+)\n\nA record in this condition will show some signs of having been played and handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Any defects must be of a cosmetic nature and not affect playback to any great extent. The record surfaces may show some signs of use and may show small wear or very light scratches that do not affect the listening experience. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are \"okay\". The label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. \"Spindle marks\" may occur.\n\nCovers and inner sleeves will have some wear, slightly turned-up corners or a small cracks in some seam. An LP sleeve may show slight signs of wear and may be marked by a punched hole, an indentation or a cut corner. In general, if it weren't for a couple of small things wrong with it, it would be NM/M- instead.\n\nVery Good (VG)\n\nMany of the flaws found in a VG+ record will be more noticeable in a VG record. Surface noise can be noticeable when you play it, especially in soft passages, during the intro and fade-out of a song, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear is starting to show, as well as light scratches that can be felt with a fingernail that might affect the sound.\n\nLabels may be torn from writing or have tape or stickers (or their remnants) attached. The same applies to picture cases or LP cases. However, it will not have all these problems at the same time.\n\nGood Plus (G+) & Good (G)\n\nA record in this condition can be played through without skipping. It may have significant surface noise, scratches and visible groove wear. Although the disc can be played without skips, noticeable surface noise and clicking sounds will certainly occur.\n\nA sleeve or inner sleeve will likely have cracks in the seams, especially at the bottom or on the back. Tape, writing, annular wear or other imperfections will be present.\n\nPoor (P) & Fair (F)\n\nThe record may be cracked, severely warped, and cannot be played through without skipping or repeating itself. Djungel & Jazz does not sell records with this rating.\n\nThe sleeve is probably water damaged, torn along all three seams or heavily damaged by wear and writing. The LP sleeve barely holds the LP inside. Inner pockets are torn, wrinkled and scribbled.\n\nGeneric\n\nThe term Generic is given to album covers that have no printing. Mostly solid black or white. Sometimes with a hole showing the records label on both sides."
