        "text": "Among the many Woody Allen films that pianist extraordinaire Dick Hyman contributed to as music director, composer and arranger he cites “Zelig” as a particular favorite.\n\n“He suggested many things, but he gave me rather free reign,” says Hyman, 88, who performs two shows with his quintet Aug. 8 as part of the Jazz at Lesher series. “Woody and I share a deep affection for the music of the ’20s.”\n\nOver the years, Hyman has played an invaluable role on the soundtracks for more than a dozen Allen films, including “Broadway Danny Rose,” “Hanna and Her Sisters,” “Mighty Aphrodite,” and the jazz-steeped “Sweet and Lowdown.” But “Zelig,” Allen’s innovative 1983 mockumentary about a man who keeps popping up in the midst of world-shaking historical events, is especially apt as Hyman’s top choice.\n\nMuch like the film’s titular hero, Hyman seems to have worked with everyone and played every style of jazz during a career stretching back to the end of World War II. At a time when a generational divide pitted traditional New Orleans and swing-oriented players against the seemingly radical new modernists known as beboppers, Hyman was welcome in every camp.\n\nWhile holding down the piano chair at famed New York jazz club Birdland with trumpeter Max Kaminsky’s Dixielanders, he ended up accompanying Lester Young, the great tenor saxophonist who paved the way for the modernists. “Once or twice, Bud Powell didn’t show up, so I sat in with Bird,” Hyman says, referring to altoist Charlie Parker, the bebop pioneer.\n\nHis scope as an artist is staggering, from his authoritative recordings of Scott Joplin rags and the foundational jazz of Jelly Roll Morton to making some of the first recordings employing a Moog synthesizer. He even hit the pop charts with the Moog on 1969’s “The Age of Electronicus” (Command Records).\n\n“I was just open for anything,” Hyman says. “Somehow I got myself prepared for anything and turned very little down.”\n\nBorn and raised in the New York City area, he came up on the Gotham music scene at a time when a musician could spend an entire career just playing in local clubs, working in studio bands for radio and television networks or doing studio sessions for commercials and pop albums. Hyman did it all.\n\n“I was lucky enough to be around New York when there was a vast recording and broadcast industry,” he says. “The amount of work that was possible in those days was unbelievable. I didn’t go on the road much. It’s funny that I’m on the road much more now.”\n\nThe quintet he brings to Walnut Creek (they also perform Aug. 9 at Livermore’s Bankhead Theater) is actually a group he co-leads with tenor saxophonist Harry Allen and tenor saxophonist/clarinetist Ken Peplowski.\n\nThe formidable Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra kicks off the fourth Jazz at Lesher season on Saturday, and the series continues Aug. 22 with pianist Cyrus Chestnut’s New York quintet featuring tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm and SFJazz Collective vibraphonist Warren Wolf.\n\nJazz at Lesher concludes Aug. 29 with the sterling guitar duo of Martin Taylor and 89-year-old Bucky Pizzarelli, who, like Hyman, is a survivor of New York’s golden age of jazz (they recorded together several times, including a rewarding 2006 trio session on Victoria Records, “The Lost Songs of 1936”).\n\nThe 56-year-old Peplowski and 48-year-old Allen are a couple generations younger than Hyman, but he helped boost their careers early on and has forged deep ties with both players. Hyman calls Allen “one of the best tenor saxophonists we have around. He’s wonderfully inventive with his own style and tips the hat to several earlier figures he’s studied.”\n\nHyman and Peplowski have honed a particularly freewheeling duo, performing regularly at the popular Manhattan jazz spot Kitano. With their vast knowledge of standards and jazz tunes, they don’t prepare a set list. They just hit the bandstand and see where the music takes them.\n\n“Playing with Dick is one of the best musical experiences I’ve ever had,” says Peplowski, who notes that he’s also worked extensively with Allen in tenor sax duel setting. “Now we’re all coming together out there, and we’ll do every possible variation. You can bet I’m going to make Dick play one solo piece too.”\n\nContact Andrew Gilbert at jazzscribe@aol.com.\n\nDick Hyman Quintet\n\nPart of Jazz at the Lesher Center concert series\n\nWhen: 5 and 8 p.m. Aug. 8\n\nWhere: Lesher Center for the Arts, 1601 Civic Drive, Walnut Creek\n\nTickets: $40;\n\n925-943-7469,\n\nwww.lesherjazz.org\n\nAlso: 3 p.m. Aug. 9 at\n\nBankhead Theater, 2400 First St., Livermore; $16-$39; 925-373-6800,\n\nwww.mylvpac.com\n\nAlso at Jazz at Lesher: Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra (5 & 8 p.m. Aug. 1), Cyrus Chestnut Quintet (5 and 8 p.m. Aug. 22), Martin Taylor and Bucky Pizzarelli (5 and 8 p.m. Aug. 29)\n\nOriginally Published: July 28, 2015 at 12:43 p.m.\n\nAmong the many Woody Allen films that pianist extraordinaire Dick Hyman contributed to as music director, composer and arranger he cites “Zelig” as a particular favorite.\n\n“He suggested many things, but he gave me rather free reign,” says Hyman, 88, who performs two shows with his quintet Aug. 8 as part of the Jazz at Lesher series. “Woody and I share a deep affection for the music of the ’20s.”\n\nOver the years, Hyman has played an invaluable role on the soundtracks for more than a dozen Allen films, including “Broadway Danny Rose,” “Hanna and Her Sisters,” “Mighty Aphrodite,” and the jazz-steeped “Sweet and Lowdown.” But “Zelig,” Allen’s innovative 1983 mockumentary about a man who keeps popping up in the midst of world-shaking historical events, is especially apt as Hyman’s top choice.\n\nMuch like the film’s titular hero, Hyman seems to have worked with everyone and played every style of jazz during a career stretching back to the end of World War II.
