He said you must listen to this its totally amazing - it was Fresh Cream. The rest is history - Jack was just incredible, that voice combined with those flying basslines and beautiful harp. It set a corner stone for my life thats never dimmed -- so so sad - been playing Cream vinyl and Jacks great subsequent albums since Saturday night --- Graham (Everson)\n\nNAME: Janie Morris\n\nLOCATION: South Africa\n\nEmail: jane_henstock\n\n[at]: neomail\n\n[dot]: co.za\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 09:55:04\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nDear Jack, I'm a wee bit numb still-I cannot take in that your fingers won't find the strings or the keys anymore...that you won't feel that utter love you had for making music again. Each note you played was special as it was exactly as you wished it to be....one, as gentle as your vulnerable soul, another as bold as the streets of Glasgow, yet another as passionate as your affair with the Blues,...music so honest & truthful that it sounds like NOTHING else. I heard the sexy Blues, I heard tantilising Jazz, I heard that Scots spirit, I heard the grandure of the classical composers....I feel that I know you personally because you really DID laid your soul bare in your music! Jack, you DID it - you made music your career, you played every conceivable genre....but you came \"home\" on Silver Rails. Then you were able to go. Thanks for making the ONLY music that conquered my heart and soul. God Bless You and God Bless Your Family as they will surely have broken hearts that will need mending.

His talent will be sorely missed and at the next meeting of the local acoustic music club, I'll be performing \"Theme For An Imaginary Western\" as my own little tribute. As I'm from Sudbury, I saw Jack a few times around town, but always thought he could do without me pestering him and stopping him getting on with his life. I'm just grateful to have been part of a generation that could hear Jack's music and look forward to seeing the inevitable BBC tribute. R.I.P.

Second, I want to say how happy I am that we had this amazing artist among us. As a bass player myself I believe Jack was the primary reason I picked up the instrument. I wanted to try to do what I heard Jack doing. And my life has been better, happier and more creative for it.

His was also one of the most distinguished and moving singing voices of all time, right up there with Sinatra, Lennon, McCartney, and McAloon. I will always treasure his solo albums and the account that a friend of mine gave after meeting him at House of Blues: that he was the warmest, sweetest gentleman she could ever wish to encounter.

I always thought Jack was a great spirit with a heart full of soul who spoke through his music and really nailed it, here's to him.\n\nNAME: MAURO OTTO\n\nLOCATION: PORTO ALEGRE - BRAZIL\n\nEmail: maurootto76\n\n[at]: gmail.com\n\n[dot]:\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 10:22:59\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nR.I.P Bass Master!!!

I have been playing bass guitar since 2009 and Cream is one of my all-time favorite bands mainly because of Jack's lead vocals and melodic bass (I was born in the 1990s by the way). His Gibson EB-3 has a distinct tone that is very difficult to reproduce on another bass and apply in various musical settings. This is what made Jack and his style very unique. Jack was one of my heroes and a true inspiration when writing bass solos and playing with or without a band. His work inspired me to be more aggressive with my bass and musical style, giving me ideas to bring the bass into the forefront. I truly thank him for his inspiration, influence, and for everything that he has done for the world of music. Rest In Peace Jack. You will be missed.\n\nNAME: Hans Wilczek\n\nLOCATION: Germany\n\nEmail: fdl_ldf\n\n[at]: gmx\n\n[dot]: de\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 10:42:13\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nHi Jack - I always bewondered your playing - you inspired me to playing bass.

Saw Jack at the Liverpool Wrestling stadium, in January 1971. Very few of us there, but it was a privilege. Bought the later,Cream at the Albert Hall, DVD, at a table top sale, from a guy my age. Told him, l couldnt understand, why he sold it. Older sister saw the Graham Bond Organisation, with Jack and Ginger, in the mid 60s. His playing and music is inspirational.Perhaps Harmony Row, will be released?:\n\nNAME: Bill Cushenberry\n\nLOCATION: Salt Lake City, Utah, USA\n\nEmail: st4bill\n\n[at]: yahoo\n\n[dot]: com\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 11:43:05\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nJack was my first inspiration as a bass player. Back in the 60's I was listening to the all the popular players of the time, looking for some musical roots. When introduced to Jack's playing, I had no idea a bass could be worked like that and it openned the door to possiblities and a style which I embraced. You gave me substance. Thank you Jack for your musical greatness and gift to us all. I will miss you.\n\nNAME: Laurence Staig\n\nLOCATION: Cambridge, UK\n\nEmail: laurence.staig\n\n[at]: onetel\n\n[dot]: net\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 11:43:08\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nVery sad news indeed.

Nothing can replace life. I never saw them unfortunatley i lived in Hawaii while they exisisted. Missed the winterland shows by 2 weeks. i once got rid of all of my records and kept 5 albums, i listened to only them for about six months. It was the 4 Cream albums, and Electric Ladyland. Still have the orginals somewhere. Jack WAS the voice of Cream and his songs were easily the bands best by far. I did get to see Jack finally a couple of years ago at Yoshi's in Oakland,California, where he was playing in a tribute to Tony Williams. the songs I didnt know, but it didnt matter I was seeing JACK BRUCE. half way through the show i look to booth next to me and there was Carlos Santana( whose wife at the timme was drummer with Jack.) for encore Carlos jumped up on stange and they played Sunshine of Your Love. everybody was grinning ear to ear. like now tears were rolling down my face, but from joy not sorrow. all else i can say is there wasn't a better bass player in world than your Jack. I will miss him too.\n\nNAME: Joe Kunicki\n\nLOCATION: New Jersey, USA\n\nEmail: mrcocoa.win\n\n[at]: verizon\n\n[dot]: net\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 11:58:50\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nYour statement is correct, the world of music is a little diminished but the star will shine brightly forever.

I have been a big fan of his since I was a teenager in the 1960s listening to Cream's fantastic music and I am hearing Jack's wonderful voice right now as I'm listening to Jack's CD \"Cities of the Heart\" and to the song Spoonful.

Malcolm had been doing some shows with us when I went out with my son to hear Son's of Cream. To our surprise, Jack walked in. Of course he went straight to the bar. We were having drinks together. He was VERY gracious to the few fans who recognized him. I enjoyed hanging with one of my heros, just having drinks like a regular guy at the bar. Needless to say, he had had a few! At break, Malcolm comes up to me and says \"My dad wants to play, what should I do?\" (I think he was worried that he had been drinking a bit...) To which I said, \"Your dad is Jack Bruce, you HAVE to let him play.\" My son and I were standing 3 feet from Jack in a small club when second set opened with Spoonful. Jack was beyond great. It was an experience I'll never forget and a moment with my son, Eric, that we will both treasure forever. BTW, Eric was a student of Kofi's. He went on to achieve a Masters Degree in Jazz Drum Set and became one of the best drummers I know!\n\nNAME: willem\n\nLOCATION: Netherlands\n\nEmail: wvdvrede\n\n[at]: gmail\n\n[dot]: com\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 12:25:55\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nR.I.P.

I was extremely fortunate to see Jack perform nine times including the majestic May 2nd 2005 Cream performance at the RAH. The standing ovation that we gave the three legends as they took the stage surely awed them as they stood there not knowing what to do for a few minutes. Jack was my favorite musician and singer and there will never be another like him! Jack R.I.P.

Jack will always be my favorite bassist: From Cream; solo work; Bruce West Laing and collaboration with Robin Trower, his singing and performing made the songs standout! And to prove my point: Can you imagine Cream without Jack Bruce? Who else could have filled the void with comparable writing, singing and playing; all while adding a dynamic edge that pushed them to their potential and beyond? No one could! Finally, Jack will forever be in the pantheon of great bass players like Stanley Clarke, James Jamerson and Louis Satterfield; the difference is Jack also sang and wrote fine songs. May Jack rest in peace and my thoughts are with his family.

There has never been a group that can identify three superstars in their profession as Cream. It created a sound and legacy that will live forever. I was unable to catch the Cream reunion in 2005 and always hoped for a return. The passing of Jack brings great sadness, however, we will remember all his great contributions. I hope Jack is \"Sitting on Top of the World\" looking down and smiling, knowing that he touched so many individuals...\n\nNAME: Dalibor Vincetic\n\nLOCATION: Zagreb, CROATIA\n\nEmail: vinceticdalibor\n\n[at]: gmail\n\n[dot]: com\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 12:54:45\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nall my life i listen cream and jack great bas guitar, rest in peace\n\nNAME: Henk\n\nLOCATION: Holland\n\nEmail: hjdgeus\n\n[at]: upcmail\n\n[dot]: nl\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 12:54:46\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAnother hero of my youth passed away.

I will always remember the first time that I listened CREAM: I was in love immediately. I was a little boy and one day, in my old house, in which I was born, I found an audio cassette and decided tio play it. I was so inpressed by White Room, Crossroads, Politician, Born under a bad sign, Sunshine of your love, Tales of brave Ulysses, all really wonderful songs. That way to sing so free and outside the rules and that way to play the bass guitar of Jack Bruce, so powerful and original accompanied by the tribal rhythm of Ginger Baker, so incredible. The sound of the guitar of Eric Clapton...so amazing, quicksilver! Crossroads, Spoonful...a new way to feel and play the blues. I didn't know who left that audio cassette in my house...it's a mistery even now! It seemed the destiny...to know and love Cream!!!! And then, after a long time, I received the gift of a new record: \"Around the next dream\" (B.B.M.). I was so curious and happy to listen that sound again, except Gary Moore in place of Eric Clapton. And in 2005, the Reunion! The desire not realized to go to London to embrace and see my heroes to the Royal Albert Hall, that incredible happiness to buy the dvd, go home and enjoy every second, note, frame. And then, I formed my actual band, Mr.Cream, the tribute to the legend of CREAM! I'm very proud to sing and play this music and have the way to remember and show Cream to the people that come to my gigs. Thank you Jack pfor everything you gave and left to us in all these years. A big big hug everywhere you are. I will always remember you with all my heart like you composed, sang and play with all your heart :-) Sincerely yours, Luca Vaglica\n\nNAME: Tom Daughton\n\nLOCATION: Massachusetts\n\nEmail: tomeg1\n\n[at]: yahoo\n\n[dot]: com\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 13:05:48\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nJack's music will always hold a special place in my heart as his work with Eric and Ginger in forming Cream was simply explosive, and provided a backdrop to my formative teen years and own early musical endeavors.

In the late 60's when I started playing bass, Jack was my biggest influence, I still have my EB-3 from those days. I also have a Warwick fretless even though I didn't know at the time it was what Jack was playing. I was honored to be part the Pledgemusic campaign for Live at the Milky Way. My sincerest condolences to his entire family and more so to Natascha. May he RIP and his music last forever.\n\nNAME: Pierce McDowell\n\nLOCATION: Albuquerque, New Mexico USA\n\nEmail: io5670\n\n[at]: earthlink\n\n[dot]: net\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 13:28:01\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nYour were an early revelation for me and still are one. I expect you always will be. A truly singular talent. You were the first to show me how free an expressive the bass could be. Thank you. It has been a great pleasure to know your son Malcolm and for that I thank you too. May you rest in peace and forever be remembered.\n\nNAME: tony brockamp\n\nLOCATION: fountain valley, California\n\nEmail: ynot_see_me\n\n[at]: yahoo.com\n\n[dot]:\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 13:29:11\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThis is very sad news. Jack was a legend and an important part of my youth. He made me think of music in a different way. I play bass and wish I was 1 100th as good as him. and to be able to sing and play at the same time. Wow. My prayers go out for him, his friends and family. Music has lost a great one here. God Bless You Jack.

Thank you, Mr. Bruce, for decades of inspiration. I was immediately captivated on my very first listening of Cream, when I was around 12 years old, and maintained that captivation to the present time. The music was and continues to be a well-spring of ideas which has informed my own musicianship over the years. It is, you could say, simply pure luck to have been on the earth at the same time that you were here; graciously enriching our lives through the spiritual aspect of music.

Disraeli Gears burned into my memory early on, and still one of my favorite records from that time and of all time. As a bassist (though my first instrument was piano) I have always counted him as an influence on my playing, especially as he was responsible for one of my favorite quotes, having said that Johann Sebastian Bach was the king of the bass players. Maybe so, but Mr. Bruce was a duke or an earl, at least. We'll miss him.\n\nNAME: Bert van Staveren\n\nLOCATION: Holland, Europe\n\nEmail: bertvanstaveren\n\n[at]: gmail\n\n[dot]: com\n\nDate: 27 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 13:43:08\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nFirst bass line I played: Sunshine of your love....
