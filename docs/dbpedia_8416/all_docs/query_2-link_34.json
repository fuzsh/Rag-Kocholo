        "text": "The term \"environmentalist\" may not be the first adjective that comes to mind when you hear the name Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has owned multiple gas-guzzling Hummers.\n\nNeedless to say, the Austrian-born bodybuilder-turned-actor-turned-politician has a huge interest in clean energy. The environment was an important part of Schwarzenegger's legislative agenda as a two-term governor of California, and now he's finding ways to save it â€” one sports utility vehicle at a time.\n\nOn the latest episode of \"Jay Leno's Garage,\" Schwarzenegger shows off the first-of-its-kind all-electric Mercedes G-Wagen, valued at $1 million. Schwarzenegger and Austrian car customizer Kreisel Electric teamed up to gut his 2016 G-Wagen V-6 combustion engine and replace it with electric motors.\n\nWhen the two living Hollywood legends met in Leno's garage, they went into full discussion about the new specs of the reinvented G-Wagen. Schwarzenegger explained that the vehicle maintained its 500 horses and even came back lighter. \"It's now 2,900 kilos. With the gas engine it was 3,400 kilos.\"\n\nAsked by Leno how he knows this, Schwarzenegger said, \"The way you figure it out is, you just go underneath and bench press the whole thing.\" The 2016 electric Mercedes G-Wagen also has a faster acceleration going to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, three seconds quicker than when it had the factory engine.\n\nThis isn't the last vehicle Schwarzenegger wants Kreisel Electric to transform. He's also having the engineers convert one of his Hummers into an all-electric version. Schwarzenegger wants his environmental efforts to not only inform consumers, but he would like politicians to also put it at the top of their agendas.\n\n\"There's no Republican air or Democratic air. We all breathe the same air,\" said the Republican former governor.\n\nLearn more about Schwarzenegger's electric Mercedes G-Wagen when he guest stars on an all new episode of \"Jay Leno's Garage\" on Thursday at 10 p.m. ET/PT"
