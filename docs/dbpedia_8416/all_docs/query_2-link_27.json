        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger can’t help but laugh at the right-wing conspiracy theories that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance is not only a farce, but the music superstar is a Democratic Party plant who will endorse President Joe Biden after the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers due to a rigged Super Bowl.\n\n“Remember, everything is a plant,” the former Republican governor of California said, laughing. “COVID was a plant. The vaccine was the plant. Of course, she’s also a plant and the team that wins is a plant. There are agents everywhere. The CIA is operating everything. I can see it very clearly how everything is a plant. It’s entertaining.”\n\nSchwarzenegger has never been shy about publicly slamming Donald Trump and his supporters. He’s called Trump the “worst president ever” and compared Jan. 6 rioters to Nazis.\n\n“It doesn’t surprise me,” he added about the Swift conspiracies.\n\nI caught up with the “Terminator” star to talk about his new Super Bowl commercial for State Farm. The spot shows Schwarzenegger filming an action movie called “Agent State Farm.” The punchline is Schwarzenegger’s thick accent gets in the way of him delivering the insurance company’s motto, “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.”\n\nThe “Agent State Farm” theme was written by Bonnie McKee and is performed by TikTok singer Loren Gray.\n\nSchwarzenegger signed on for the spot because he believes State Farm performs a public service. “They’re here for the people and the community,” he said. “And it’s also very entertaining. It’s the making of an action movie. I saw all the action sequences — blowing up the house, the helicopter and all this crazy stuff — and I said, ‘This is perfect.’ We laughed the whole time. That is how I kind of pick those things.”\n\nHe continued, “I get asked to do a lot of endorsements and commercials, but I’m not in need of money. I’ve made plenty of money.”\n\nSchwarzenegger plans to have some friends over to watch the Big Game: “I’ll throw some steaks on and have some good pizza and watch for my commercial.”\n\nHow does he like his pizza? “With everything on it,” Schwarzenegger said. “Totally load it up with every vegetable and every meat and every kind of junk you can find on the kitchen floor.”"
