        "text": "State Farm's Super Bowl LVIII ad which brought together Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito \"walked off with the top spot in USA TODAY’s 36th Ad Meter contest,\" according to Gabe Lacques of USA TODAY. The spot features Schwarzenegger \"playing a State Farm employee in an action film,\" though he \"struggles to pronounce the insurance giant’s tagline, giving his pal DeVito an opening to save the day in a surprise cameo.\" Schwarzenegger \"remains popular across generations\" and \"revived his action-star iconography for this spot.\" The Ad Meter top five was rounded out by Dunkin’, Kia, Uber Eats and the NFL (USA TODAY, 2/12). AD WEEK’S Keifer & Stanley had State Farm's spot as No. 3 in their Top 5 and wrote the \"cheeky spot\" revolves around Schwarzenegger's mispronunciation, \"taking the joke to ridiculous extremes\" (AD WEEK, 2/11). THE ATHLETIC’s Jake Ciely had the spot at No. 2 in his ranking and wrote it was Schwarzenegger \"in his best role since True Lies\" (THE ATHLETIC, 2/11).\n\nPLENTY OF GOOD: The DALLAS MORNING NEWS wrote Super Bowl Sunday featured \"plenty of good ones, as usual,\" though some of the talk on social media \"seemed to say the same thing about the commercials as the entertainment value of the game itself: Started out a little slow, but finished out quite strong.\" A \"strong entry\" was M&M’s “Almost Won a Super Bowl” ad featuring Pro Football HOFers Terrell Owens, Dan Marino and Bruce Smith and actor Scarlett Johansson. Arguably the \"consensus favorite of the night, though, was BMW’s ad starring Christopher Walken\" (DALLAS MORNING NEWS, 2/11). Ciely wrote the Super Bowl commercials \"seem to be on the rebound the past few years\" and this year's commercials \"might be the best group yet.\" Ciely's Top 5 Super Bowl commercials were 1. Paramount+, 2. State Farm, 3. BetMGM, 4. Dunkin’ Donuts and 5. Skechers: No, Mr. T (THE ATHLETIC, 2/11). In N.Y., Mike Hale wrote his \"Best of the Bunch\" included BMW; Mountain Dew; Squarespace; Lindor; ‘A Quiet Place; Day One’; Google; Dunkin’; E*Trade; poppi; NFL; and BetMGM (N.Y. TIMES, 2/11).\n\nSOME FAVORITES: Keifer & Stanley gave their No. 1 spot to CeraVe, as Michael Cera \"fully embraced the role\" for the \"most buzzworthy and anticipated campaign of the season.\" It generated \"attention far beyond the game.\" They rounded out their Top 5 with No. 5 Dunkin’, in which Ben Affleck \"seems to be having the time of his life.\" He is \"chewing scenery, humiliating his BFF, and announcing flashy new duds and drinks from Dunkin’.\" No. 4 Verizon featured Beyonce and her \"surprise announcement of a new record.\" That may have \"made most impact with audiences,\" but Verizon \"still has bragging rights for landing Bey.\" No. 2 Paramount+'s “A Mountain of Entertainment” campaign is \"aging like fine wine\" (AD WEEK, 2/11). AD AGE’s Tim Nudd wrote CeraVe's spot, which he gave five stars, was a \"perfect crossover opportunity,\" and it is “executed flawlessly with layered humor that feels modern but also lighthearted and not overly concepted.” Nudd also gave Dunkin’ five stars as its \"cringey humor is actually funny,\" and the \"celebs are put to good use\" (AD AGE, 2/11).\n\nMAKING THE GRADE: In Cleveland, Marc Bona wrote overall, this year’s \"predominant vehicle to sell products and messages was humor, and it was delivered by a host of stars.\" Companies \"crafted the right aura in a variety of ways -- from laugh-out-loud to light, to feel-good moments and messages via celebrities and pop-cultural references.\" Bona listed his top 5 favorites from the 2024 Super Bowl, with his No.1 being Uber Eats, whose message is \"clear because it is repeated throughout the gag with no room for misunderstanding.\" Rounding out his Top 5 are No 5. Budweiser, whose return of the Clydesdales is a \"recipe for good feelings.\" No 4. e.l.f Cosmetics picked a \"good game to go big with a commercial\" with Taylor Swift being in attendance. No. 3 Michelob Ultra \"works because we see right up front what the ad is for and then are entertained\" by Lionel Messi. No. 2 Dove promotes the \"positive messages that come from girls playing sports and takes a smart approach to tout the Body Confident Program\" (Cleveland PLAIN DEALER, 2/11). YAHOO SPORTS’ Roscher & Busbee handed out A grades to a number of spots. YouTube's ad was \"better than anyone could have hoped for.\" M&Ms featured a \"solid concept\" and \"recognizable guest stars.\" Dove's was \"another critic-proof message ad.\" PlutoTV's was \"absolutely brilliant,\" while Dunkin's was \"brilliant and goofy.\" Uber Eats featured a \"genuinely hilarious concept, executed in a genuinely funny and memorable way.\" Also receiving A grades were BetMGM, E*Trade, Etsy, e.l.f. and Drumstick (YAHOO SPORTS, 2/11)."
