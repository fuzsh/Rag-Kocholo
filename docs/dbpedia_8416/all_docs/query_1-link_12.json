        "text": "According to the Terminator Wiki, James Cameron explicitly addresses this point in the DVD Commentary for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The T-800 is the name of the series (i.e. the metal endoskeleton) and the 101 model number is the name of the skin overlay:\n\n\"...the model 101s all look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, with a 102 looking like someone else...\" - James Cameron: T2 Commentary\n\nThis was also confirmed in the official trailer for Terminator 2 : Judgement Day as you can see in the image below:\n\nThe T-800 is a series of terminators, of which the CSM (Cyberdyne Systems Model)-101 was just one implementation of the T-800 series. The CSM-102 had an identical skeletal structure, but looked like someone else (IE, not Swarzenegger). Likewise for the CSM-103, 104, 105, etc.\n\nIn other words, T-800 is the model number of the metal body, whereas CSM-101 is the skin, hair, etc.\n\nI'm not 100% sure, but I think the CSM-101 could also be implemented in the other T-8xx series cyborgs, such as the T-831, or the T-850.\n\nJust to add in another point here. Remember that this was the Infiltrator series, and despite Arnie being the model we see most, he is not the ONLY one that we see. In the very first movie, when Kyle is sitting in the base looking at Sarah's photo, an Infiltrator comes in who is very clearly a different model.\n\nNow, if we take Stirling's books into account, the Infiltrator series were actually humans who were cybernetically advanced in a variety of methods.\n\nHope this has muddied the waters a little better."
