        "text": "This month, Schwarzenegger released a self-help book titled, Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life. Since he’s no ordinary star, publisher Penguin Press knew it couldn’t promote the book in the usual way.\n\nDeveloped by New York agency Orchard Creative, the marketing campaign for the book taps into the artificial intelligence (AI) craze–with a twist fitting of Schwarzenegger’s inexhaustible spirit.\n\nOn Sept. 29, Penguin and Orchard set up an “AI” booth at Gold’s Gym in Venice, Calif.,"
