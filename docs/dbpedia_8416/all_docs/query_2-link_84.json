She wants to know if you are the father of Joseph.' And I was likeâ€”I thought my heart stopped, and then I told the truth.\"\n\nIn fact, the Total Recall star, who wed Shriver in 1986, remembers his direct response: \"'Yes, Maria, Joseph is my son.'\"\n\nHowever, he notes that he didn't initially realize he had another son."
