        "text": "Who is Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nA man of many talents, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true icon. Beginning his legendary career as a bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger cemented himself in different realms, be it acting, business, or politics. He was once the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, with The Terminator being one of his most famous roles.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s early life\n\nOn July 30, 1947, Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to a police chief and a homemaker, named Gustav and Aurelia, in a tiny village in Thal, Austria. He grew up in a Catholic household with strict parents. Though he excelled in sports, academically, he was an average student.\n\nUntil the age of 14, he played soccer. It was in 1960 that he took his first step toward becoming a bodybuilder when his soccer coach took him to the local gym and introduced him to the world of bodybuilding.\n\nAfter finishing high school in 1965, Schwarzenegger enlisted himself in the Austrian military. It was here, that he won his first bodybuilding contest, Mr. Junior Europe. Schwarzenegger has never looked back ever since.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's wife and children\n\nWhile in Austria, Arnold Schwarzenegger's family consisted of four members. Apart from his parents, Schwarzenegger had an elder brother named Meinhard Schwarzenegger, who unfortunately passed away in a traffic collision in 1971 at the age of 24. Years after moving to America, Arnold Schwarzenegger married television journalist and American royalty, Maria Shriver. The wedding took place in Hyannis, Massachusetts on April 26, 1986.\n\nThe couple has four children, namely Katherine, Christina, Patrick, and Christopher Schwarzenegger. However, the two ended their marriage and parted ways in 2011 after Schwarzenegger's alleged infidelity came to light. Schwarzenegger fathered a child named Joseph Baena during his extramarital affair with his former housekeeper, Mildred Baena.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's net worth 2024\n\nA successful entrepreneur before he ventured into the film industry, Schwarzenegger had a net worth of $450 million. During his peak, he earned $20-30 million per movie while also forging a career in real estate. The real estate portfolio of Arnold Schwarzenegger is $100 million.\n\nIn movies, Arnold earned $2 million for \"Commando\", $3.5 million for \"Predator\", $11 million for \"Total Recall\", and $12 million for both \"Kindergarten Cop\" and \"Terminator 2\". In Terminator 2, Arnold only had 700 words of dialogue, equating to $21,429 per spoken word. At his peak, Schwarzenegger earned $20 million to $30 million per movie. He receives royalties from various projects, with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines being a notable example. He earns 20% of gross profits, along with additional income from TV airings, video sales, merchandise, and other revenue streams.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s career timeline\n\nIn 1960, Arnold Schwarzenegger initiated his weight training journey under the guidance of his football coach, who led the team to a local gym. Making a pivotal decision at the age of 14, he opted for bodybuilding as a career over football. Throughout his early years in bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger actively participated in Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting competitions. He marked his professional debut in 1963 and secured victories in weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, along with powerlifting triumphs in 1966 and 1968.\n\nAmong his early successes was winning the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965, followed by claiming the title of Mr. Europe the next year at the age of 19.\n\nWhile pursuing his bodybuilding career, Arnold Schwarzenegger also gave his childhood dream a shot. In 1969, he landed the role of Hercules in the fantasy comedy, Hercules in New York. However, due to his thick Austrian accent, Schwarzenegger's dialog in his debut movie was dubbed by another actor.\n\nNearly a decade later, his bodybuilding-centric sports documentary, Pumping Iron, was released in 1977. The movie was well received not only in Hollywood but in the entire bodybuilding world. This film's success turned him into a household name. Apart from Schwarzenegger's popularity, the film also helped popularize bodybuilding.\n\nAfter this, Schwarzenegger starred in the 1980s film series, Conan The Barbarian. The first installment of the 3-movie film series was released in 1982. Made on a budget of $20 million, the film performed immensely well, earning $68.9-79.1 million at the box office. However, this wasn't the role that helped him break through in the international market.\n\nThe Terminator, released in 1984, was what made Arnold Schwarzenegger an internationally acclaimed actor. With a budget of merely $6.4 million, The Terminator grossed a whopping 78.3 million at the box office. Directed by James Cameron, this science fiction movie was well-received by the audience. Its initial success laid the foundation for its next 5 sequels that were released over the next few decades, the last being in 2019.\n\nWhile it is undoubtedly one of his most famous movies, this wasn't the movie that earned him the heftiest paycheck. The 1988 film named 'Twins' was the one that helped him make the big bucks. However, it wasn't a direct paycheck deal. Instead of getting paid while filming the movie, Schwarzenegger had cracked a deal to have a share of 45% of the profits. With the $18 million movie earning $216 million at the theaters, Schwarzenegger's income is estimated to be around $35-40 million dollars.\n\nDespite his enormous success in the film industry, when the time came to move on to his next endeavor, Arnold Schwarzenegger quit acting. In 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger pulled the plugs on his acting career in order to try his hands at politics.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's political career officially began in 2003 when he ran for the office of Governor of California.

The Republican Party member was re-elected in 2006 and served another term from 2007 to 2011.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger made a comeback to Hollywood and featured in movies such as The Expendables 2, The Last Stand, and Terminator: Dark Fate. He continued to uphold his dedication to bodybuilding and fitness through his collaboration with Lorimer. In recognition of his significant contributions, Schwarzenegger was honored with induction into the inaugural class of the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nIn 2023, Arnold Schwarzenegger broadened his fitness initiative by introducing a daily email newsletter for subscribers and unveiling his \"Arnold’s Pump Club\" app. Additionally, he became part of the cast for the Netflix series FUBAR and became the focal point of a three-part documentary titled \"Arnold,\" scheduled for release on June 7, 2023.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s partnerships and endorsements\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger endorses several companies, including Dimensional Fund Advisors, Lidl, Planet Hollywood, and State Farm Insurance. I\n\nIn 2018, Arnold Schwarzenegger collaborated with basketball player LeBron James to create Ladder, a company focused on developing nutritional supplements designed to assist athletes dealing with severe cramps.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s achievements\n\nAfter the Mr. Junior Europe title, Schwarzenegger won the Mr. Universe title in 1967, followed by three more titles, thereafter. After his win in 1967, he moved to California and trained to compete for Mr. Olympia. He was 23 years old when he won his first Mr. Olympia title in 1970. Those rigorous workouts and training fetched him six consecutive Mr. Olympia titles from 1970 to 1975.\n\nAfter the 1975 Mr. Olympia title, he retired from bodybuilding and shot his documentary, Pumping Iron. However, he soon returned to bodybuilding in 1980 to compete and won his seventh Mr. Olympia title.
