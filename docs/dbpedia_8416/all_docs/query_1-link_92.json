        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger Detained At Munich Airport After Failing To Declare Luxury Watch\n\nThe action star told German newspaper Bild that he was baffled by the ordeal.\n\nLOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was briefly detained at the Munich airport after a customs debacle on Wednesday.\n\nCustoms officials told The Guardian that the Austrian-born actor and former governor of California was held at the airport for several hours after failing to declare a luxury watch while traveling from the United States to Germany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bodybuilder intended to auction the custom Piguet timepiece during a fundraising dinner at his World Climate Summit in Kitzbühel, Austria, on Thursday.\n\nThe German newspaper Bild reported that Schwarzenegger was released after agreeing to pay € 35,000 in taxes and fines.\n\nBut forking over the tariff money proved its own ordeal, according to sources with direct knowledge who spoke to TMZ about the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter authorities unsuccessfully tried to charge the “Terminator” actor’s credit card for an hour, they had to seek out not one, but two different ATMs to get the required amount of cash.\n\nSchwarzenegger was let on his way after about three hours with customs.\n\nThe action star expressed frustration at the situation to Bild, telling the newspaper, “This is the problem that Germany is suffering from. You can no longer see the forest for the trees.”\n\nThomas Meister, a spokesman for the main customs office in Munich, said that his agency had initiated the appropriate “criminal tax proceedings” against Schwarzenegger, however.\n\n“The watch should have been registered because it is an import,” Meister told Bild.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
