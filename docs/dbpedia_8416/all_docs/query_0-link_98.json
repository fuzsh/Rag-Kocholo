        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger was a huge Guns n Roses fan and during his prime acting career, he also got to share the screen with his favorite idols during a music video. Not only did it excite the fans, but both entities got to promote their projects immensely.\n\nThe 1991 music video by Guns n Roses was an instant hit mostly because they featured The Terminator aka Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Moreover, the actor had done a photoshoot with the band around the same time. The photos after recently getting resurfaced got much excitement from the community.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger as a fan of Guns n Roses\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAt his peak, The Terminator actor had once invited the band members of Guns n Roses for dinner. And although Guns N’ Roses wrote “You Could Be Mine” when they recorded Appetite for Destruction, Arnold Schwarzenegger appealed to include it in the sequel to The Terminator. The influential actor ultimately made it possible to add the song at the end credits and several times during the action scenes.\n\nOn the other hand, they also shot a music video in 1991 when the band finally started playing the song live. According to Rolling Stone, “To promote the single, they shot a video in which the Terminator shows up at a Guns N’ Roses concert to target the band for termination.” At the end of the music video, both the actor and the band members took some immensely popular pictures.\n\nFans recall the old thrill when they first saw the collaboration between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Guns n Roses through the throwback picture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFans reminisce old days\n\nOne of the fans recalled a scene from Terminator 2, “In T2, he pulls a shotgun out of a box of roses. I always liked that fun little reference.” Another suggested, “Looks like Arnold and Slash are out on a date.” Someone else pointed out some interesting information about Schwarzenegger being a huge GnR fan. They said, “Arnold was a huge GnR fan and he wanted a song in Terminator 2. At the time, Robert Patrick’s brother played guitar with this guy Trent Reznor in his un-and-coming project Nine Inch Nails. Patrick lobbied hard for Head Like a Hole instead of YCBM, but Cameron ended up siding with the big star.” Another fan commented, “At least Arnold was kinda cool.” Someone else also noted how small Slash looked standing next to Arnie, they said, “How fucking small is Slash?!”\n\nREAD MORE: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Vocal Coach Reveals How “Vocal Pilates” Helped the Duo for 60-Second Movie ‘Agent State Farm’\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe Iconic moment where everyone in the picture was at the peak of their career called for much appreciation for the collaboration.
