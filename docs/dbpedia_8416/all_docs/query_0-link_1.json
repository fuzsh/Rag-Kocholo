        "text": "When the BBC tapped me to break down the brand of Arnold Schwarzenegger - especially now that he’s a life coach with his new book \"Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life” - it got me thinking about the lessons we can learn from this iconic and motivational figure. From his legendary roles in ‘Terminator’ to ‘Total Recall,’ Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brand has always been next-level and larger-than-life.\n\nBut has he really?\n\nDespite his portrayals of cyborgs and barbarian’s on screen, Arnold Schwarzenegger is undeniably human and likable.\n\nSo, how has he accomplished this?\n\nEmbracing Humor:\n\nI believe a big part of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brand's power lies in not taking yourself too seriously. Despite his Herculean image, Arnold has always had a sense of humor that has endeared him to audiences worldwide. From clever one-liners in movies to his chill social media presence featuring cigars, he’s always had a laugh at his own brand. In the cutthroat world of Hollywood, I’ll have you know, this is no small feat.\n\nAnd given today's prevailing seriousness, I have no doubt this facet of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brand will continue to be a hit. It also serves as a reminder of what I preach in The Kim Kardashian Principle, approachability and authenticity are our most formidable assets. According to a survey by Nielsen, 67% of consumers vibe with brands that feel authentic and transparent.\n\nThe Art of Reinvention:\n\nFrom bodybuilding champ to Governor of California to Hollywood's box office, there's no doubt in my mind that Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ability to adapt and reinvent himself has kept his brand on point. I think he could teach Madonna a thing or two about reinvention. This mindset of adaptability, just like a chameleon, is at the heart of his brand's enduring vitality.\n\nIn his latest book, \"Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life,\" Arnold Schwarzenegger emphasizes the importance of never listening to the naysayers. Even after his blockbuster success, he was told he could never do comedy. But, this didn’t deter him from believing in his sense of humor and his capacity to transform his brand.\n\nAll this to say… we’re living in an era characterized by rapid change and evolving preferences. The ability to pivot and reinvent is more crucial today than ever before. A report by McKinsey highlights that 80% of CMOs believe their business models will undergo significant change in the next five years.\n\nDream Big, Work Hard:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger epitomizes the 'dream big, work hard' ethos. His evolution from a young Austrian bodybuilder, touted as the most muscular man in the world, to the pinnacle of Hollywood stardom and later, the Governor of California, is nothing short of epic. And these accomplishments aren't fleeting; they're the result of tireless dedication, unyielding hard work, and an unwavering belief in his own dreams.\n\nI believe this underscores the importance of not just thinking big, but also of acting big. According to a study by HubSpot, 61% of consumers are more likely to vibe with companies that deliver custom content. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brand is a living testament to the fact that customized substance underpins longevity.\n\nHumanity Amidst Stardom:\n\nLast but not least, I now see that Arnold Schwarzenegger's brand has consistently shown an inspiring vulnerability and his humanness has resonated deeply, allowing him to have an impact. He's faced setbacks, candidly addressing his affair with the nanny and the child born from it and his separation from his wife, Maria Shriver. Yet, he's bounced back, showing remarkable strength. From health scares like his heart attack to political challenges, Arnold Schwarzenegger has stood strong against all odds. And most recently, Arnold Schwarzenegger became the brand ambassador for Lidl’s DIY range, championing his roots as a former bricklayer and all-round handyman; simply brilliant!\n\nBottom line?\n\nI believe Arnold Schwarzenegger's brand is as indestructible as his biceps, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon."
