They looked fairly impressive in their opening season win against Stanford, but less impressive last week against BYU. So to really get an understanding of these boys from Westwood, I sat down with long-time California resident and current governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nBlock U: Thank you Governor for taking time out of your busy day to sit down with us.\n\nAS:, Ya'.\n\nBlock U: How good is UCLA?\n\nAS: Ha! Da Bruins are pumped and ready to roll. [weird grunt]. I'm personally der trainer and dey can definitely feel da burn.\n\nBlock U: So we can expect them to be very well conditioned?\n\nAS: Ya', do you have a problem wit dat?\n\nBlock U: No, just makes it that more difficult for Utah. How does Ben Olson look?\n\nAS: He's a stud. He will crush his enemies, he is no girlie man!\n\nBlock U: What makes him a stud?\n\nAS: Because I knew an Olson in Austria and he was one tough sonofabitch. He ate glass once, I laughed. We were high.\n\nBlock U: I don't think Ben Olson is Austrian, or even German.\n\nAS: Same name, lame brain! Ha!\n\nBlock U: ...\n\nAS: Your scrawny ass got quiet all of da suddent, what gives?\n\nBlock U: I'm sorry, I just didn't expect a politician to talk like this.\n\nAS: I'm not into politics, I'm into survival!\n\nBlock U: But you're the governor of California.\n\nAS: Governor? Oh, dats right. Arnold's bad.\n\nBlock U: Right. Is there anything else you can tell us about UCLA?\n\nAS: Dey kill anything dat bleeds.\n\nBlock U: Oh I get it, you're using movie quotes now.\n\nAS: Movie quotes? Dis is how I talk.\n\nBlock U: Ok then, what do you think of Coach Dorrell? He's been on the hot seat lately.\n\nAS: Loser! Dis guy can't coach his way way out of paper bag.\n\nBlock U: Really? But you think the Bruins will win?\n\nAS: Ya'. What da hell is a Ute, anyway?\n\nBlock U: An American Indian tribe.\n\nAS: Da Utes are from India? I think I shot a movie der once.\n\nBlock U: No, American Indian. You know, Native Americans?\n\nAS: I'm a native of Austria. My fadda was a Nazi.\n\nBlock U: ...\n\nAS: Do I intimidate you?\n\nBlock U: No.\n\nAS: Den I'm not doin' my job! [gets up out of chair and begins flexing his muscles]\n\nBlock U: I think that will do it, thanks again, Governor.\n\n[Governor Schwarzenegger grunts, lifts me up into the air and spins me around]"
