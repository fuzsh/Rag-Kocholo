Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger, born on July 30, 1947, is not only a globally recognized Austrian-American actor, businessman, filmmaker, politician, and professional bodybuilder but also a notable figure in the world of luxury timepieces. Known for his iconic roles in action films and his stint as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011, Schwarzenegger's diverse achievements have garnered him immense fame.

Arnold Schwarzenegger Watch - Laco Watch Pilot Original Friedrichshafen 861753

Arnold Schwarzenegger Watch - Laco Watch Pilot Original Friedrichshafen 861753

Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-American icon whose last name distinctly rings of German origin, naturally pays homage to his heritage. One way he does this is through his choice of timepieces. In this instance, he is seen sporting a watch hailing from Germany: the Laco Watch Pilot Original Friedrichshafen 861753.

This 45mm watch stands out with its dark sandblasted stainless steel case. Paired with a rugged brown calf leather strap accented with rivets, it exudes an aura of vintage charm and durability.

Now, a little history about Laco to appreciate this timepiece better: The Laco Pilot Watches Original series are meticulously crafted reconstructions of the observation watches, or Beobachtungsuhren (B-Uhr for short), from the 1940s. These watches, distinguished by their commanding 55mm diameter, were not just timepieces but also important navigational instruments.

At that time, only a select few companies received the permission from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) ‚Äì the former German ministry for aviation ‚Äì to manufacture these pilot watches. The precise requirements set by the RLM were met by just five manufacturers: IWC, Laco, Lange & S√∂hne, Stowa, and Wempe. Together, they birthed a horological classic, which has since become a key inspiration for countless wristwatches.

Retail price: ‚Ç¨1,130.

Arnold Schwarzenegger was spotted sporting a rare and distinctive timepiece, the Panerai Radiomir PAM00341 Special Edition ‚ÄúEgiziano‚Äù (Egyptian). This discontinued model, with a hefty 60mm titanium case, was originally designed in the 1950s for the Egyptian Navy, who required an ‚Äúindestructible watch‚Äù for their underwater raid units. Boasting a water resistance of up to 100 meters, it aptly met this requirement.

However, the Egiziano is not just a robust piece of timekeeping. It's a piece of history, with only 500 units ever produced globally. Its scarcity and unique backstory make it a sought-after treasure in the vintage watch market.

Retail price: $27,700.

Market price: ~$30,000.

Arnold was also spotted sporting the rare U-BOAT U-1942, a discontinued model with only 29 pieces ever made. This behemoth of a watch boasts a whopping 65mm diameter and is entirely handcrafted, reflecting an unmatched level of skill and attention to detail.

The U-1942 features a robust titanium case, a leather strap, and a massive scratch-resistant rotational diver's bezel. This combination makes for an impressive, durable timepiece that's just as suitable for rugged adventure as it is for casual wear.

What sets this watch apart is its innovative winding crown design. Built in two parts, the first part is attached to the movement stem, while the second is hinged to it, creating a flexible joint. This ingenious design allows the crown to protrude significantly from the watch case. Not just a stylistic choice, this feature also enhances practicality, making the winding process and time-setting easier and more comfortable. All in all, the U-BOAT U-1942 is a testament to creative engineering, intricate craftsmanship, and bold design choices.

Retail price: $40,000.
