Cult-favourite Australian fashion label Dissh has confirmed the arrival of their first ever Perth store.

A reel posted to Instagram on Monday afternoon teased: “1 like and we’ll open a store in Perth.”, garnering over 800 comments, many speculating where the new store would be.

“Ok fine! Perth, we are opening our doors end of 2024. See you soon,” the brand later confirmed in a comment.

Amassing an international fan base for their elevated basics, Dissh has been worn by the likes of Emily Ratajkowski, Dakota Fanning, Aimee Song, Adut Akech and more.

Dissh’s Perth store would be the ninth in Australia, and the first in WA.

Founded in 2001 by Maree Henry, the first Dissh store was located on the Gold Coast. Working alongside her mum since 2006, Henry’s daughter Lucy Henry-Hicks took over as CEO and Creative Director in 2020, overseeing a shift towards the pared-back aesthetic and sustainable practices the brand is known for today.

With feel-good natural fibres, thoughtful detailing, and longevity in mind, our collections are crafted to uphold a new model of conscious fashion. Our design team leads with intention, bringing you considered collections that arrive with the season, but become a seasonless addition to your wardrobe.”
