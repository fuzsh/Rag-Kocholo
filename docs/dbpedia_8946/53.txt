The Label Factory houses some of the most advanced printing equipment found in Australia.

From our modern print manufacturing facility in Canning Vale, we deploy a blend of ultra-modern manufacturing technology with old school craftsmanship and technical printing expertise. Our team are highly experienced, having been in the industry for decades.

Our high speed flexographic presses are equipped with the latest Fleye Inspection systems, carefully inspecting every single label printed for defects, and automatically rejecting any media that fails inspection. Our slitting machines are also equipped with state-of-the-art inspection systems allowing us to inspect every single label we supply for defects and remove them ensuring 100% defect free supply.

We use spectrophotometer testing for our colour analysis, ANSI approved barcode verification equipment to ensure our barcodes are fit for use and will scan in the field, and a whole host of other highly automated ancillary equipment which allows us to produce your labels to the highest standards achievable.

We have smart IT systems in place, like our cloud-based MIS which allows for live tracking of the jobs as they move through our production processes, keeping our sales team up to date with the progress of each job we have in hand at the moment.
