        "text": "A Jetstar passenger has blasted the budget airline, claiming she was refused free water on a flight from Bali to Perth.\n\nDasha Daley, who is a Perth-based adult content creator, took aim at the Aussie carrier in a TikTok video over the weekend.\n\n“The joys of flying Jetstar; when you buy a bottle of water at the departure gate and they take it off you when you board as it’s not allowed but then also refuse to serve free water when you’re suffering with Bali belly. Should be illegal,” she wrote.\n\nOther travellers informed Ms Daley that Jetstar gives out free cups of water but she claims she asked cabin crew and was told no.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News, she said she had gone through a security checkpoint and purchased a bottle of water at the departure gate but it was then confiscated at a second security checkpoint.\n\nWhile on the flight, she claimed she was not provided any water until meal service.\n\n“I did have a free meal because I paid for 30kg [around 66lbs] luggage and that came with a beverage so I was lucky I had some water then,” she told the publication.\n\n“But meal service takes some time and I had to wait a while.”\n\nDenpasar International Airport requires liquids to be disposed of before boarding a flight to Australia on any airline, including unopened water bottles purchased at the airport.\n\nComplaints about this rule have popped up on travel forums for over a decade.\n\n“All airlines in Bali take it off you. I’ve flown five different ones the last few years and had to empty bottles,” one traveller wrote in response to Ms Daley’s video.\n\n“Totally ridiculous. All of this not allowed nonsense is out of control,” said another.\n\n“It’s sad when you have to sneak water onto a plane,” added a third commenter.\n\nJetstar’s service includes cups of water for customers at no cost on-board.\n\nThe airline did not provide details on this specific case when contacted by news.com.au."
