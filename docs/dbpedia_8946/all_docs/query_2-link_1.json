        "text": "Perth, city and capital, Western Australia. Perth lies along the estuary of the Swan River, 12 miles (19 km) above that river’s mouth, which forms the inner harbour of neighbouring Fremantle. The city, the fourth largest in Australia, is the centre of a metropolitan area containing about three-fourths of the state’s population.\n\nIn the early 19th century the British, suspicious of French and American interest in the Australian west coast, decided to expand their settlement to that region and claim the entire continent. In 1827 Capt. (later Sir) James Stirling arrived to choose a town site. The following year Capt. Sir Charles Fremantle took possession of the area, and in 1829 a colony, with private financial backing, was declared. It was named after the county of Perth in Scotland, birthplace of Sir George Murray, then secretary of state for the colonies, and was proclaimed a city in 1856. It was linked to Adelaide (in South Australia) by telegraph in 1877 and received strong impetus for growth from the discovery (1890) of gold at Coolgardie-Kalgoorlie (374 miles [602 km] east), from the opening of an improved Fremantle harbour (1901), and from the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1917. It became a lord mayoralty in 1929.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAustralian Vocabulary Quiz\n\nPerth is a major industrial centre with heavy industries concentrated in the suburban zones of Kwinana, Fremantle, and Welshpool. The city’s diversified manufactures include paint, plaster, printed materials, sheet metal, cement, rubber, tractors, steel, aluminum, and nickel. There are also petroleum refineries and food-processing plants. Tourism has grown in importance, especially since Fremantle hosted the America’s Cup yacht race in 1987."
