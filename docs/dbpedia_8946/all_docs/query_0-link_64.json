        "text": "Perth is Australia’s “Capital of Cool”, according to an international travel correspondent.\n\nWriting for the US news network CNN, Chris Dwyer described Perth as a “must visit city” in Australia alongside Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n“The capital of the vast state of Western Australia may be a long way from most destinations, but Perth's remote location makes its appeal even stronger,” he wrote.\n\n“There's the feeling that Perthites have long known that their city was a hidden travel gem, but it's come into its own more than ever in the past couple of years.\n\n“That's set to increase still further in March next year as Qantas makes it the hub for their long-range nonstop Dreamliner flights from Europe, meaning thousands more visitors will arrive each month.”\n\nDwyer said he came to believe Perth was one of the coolest cities in the Southern Hemisphere after he visited the small bar Alfred’s Pizzeria in Perth’s CBD.\n\n“Under a tongue-in-cheek sign proclaiming \"No Stairway to Heaven,\" brilliant cocktails, the perfect playlist and impeccable handmade pizzas came together in one of the coolest bars in what's definitely one of the coolest cities in the Southern Hemisphere,” he wrote.\n\nAmong other highlights, Dwyer recommended other Perth bars Helvetica, Bar Sequel, and Fromage Artisans as well as Wolf Lane, Rottnest Island and the award-winning COMO The Treasury hotel.\n\nHis ringing endorsement comes just weeks after the humble suburb of Maylands was proclaimed by travel gurus Lonely Planet as being among the three ‘coolest’ neighbourhoods across the country.\n\nPerth-based contributor to Lonely Planet, Fleur Bainger, put it on the map for travellers, describing it as the “once-shady suburb (which) has evolved into a buzzing community hub with a gritty, yet artisanal edge.”"
