        "text": "Food package labels must include a name or a description of the food. This name or description should be clear enough so you can tell it apart from other foods.\n\nIf there is a prescribed name for the food in the Food Standards Code this must be included on the label. If there is no prescribed name for a food, the label must include a name or description that clearly states the true nature of the food.\n\nIn accordance with food laws, labels must tell the truth and manufacturers must not represent foods in a false, misleading or deceptive way.\n\nAdvisory statements\n\nAdvisory statements must be provided for certain foods or ingredients which may cause health risks for some consumers.\n\nPrescribed warning and advisory statements are specified in Standard 1.2.3 – Mandatory Warning and Advisory Statements and Declarations (external site) and elsewhere in the Code.\n\nFoods or ingredients that fall into this category include:\n\naspartame – labels on food containing the intense sweetener aspartame must indicate the food contains phenylalanine (which can affect people with the rare genetic disorder phenylketonuria)\n\nguarana or guarana extracts – labels on food containing guarana or extracts of guarana (which is a natural source of caffeine) must indicate that the food contains caffeine\n\nplant sterols – labels on foods containing added plant sterols (which may reduce cholesterol absorption) must include statements indicating that:\n\nwhen consuming the product, it should be consumed as part of a healthy diet\n\nthe product may not be suitable for children under the age of five years and pregnant or lactating women, and\n\nplant sterols do not provide additional benefits when consumed in excess of three grams per day\n\ncaffeine – labels on kola beverages containing added caffeine must indicate that they contain caffeine\n\nWarning statements\n\nA food must have a warning statement when people may be unaware of a severe health risk posed by a food or an ingredient. For example, food containing the bee product royal jelly is required to have a warning statement, which states that: This product contains royal jelly which has been reported to cause severe allergic reactions and, in rare cases, fatalities, especially in asthma and allergy sufferers.\n\nRefer to the FSANZ website for more on warning and advisory declarations (external site).\n\nAllergic reactions – mandatory warnings, advisory statements and declarations\n\nSome food for sale can cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. It is for this reason that certain food must have mandatory warnings, advisory statements and/or declarations when:\n\ngiven to a buyer on request\n\ndisplayed next to the food\n\nincluded on the packaging.\n\nDeclarations\n\nIf a food product contains any of the following substances then a declaration must be made:\n\ncereals containing gluten and their products, namely, wheat, rye, barley, oats and spelt and their hybridised strains\n\nfish and fish products\n\ncrustacea (shellfish, for example prawns) and associated products\n\negg and egg products\n\nmilk and milk products\n\npeanuts and soybeans and their products\n\ntree nuts and sesame seeds and their products other than coconut\n\nadded sulphites in concentrations of 10 mg/kg or more.\n\nRefer to the Food Allergens Declarations for a suite of resources that provide information on allergen declaration requirements for food businesses. This information supports the objective of protecting public health of food allergic individuals. Sensitised individuals rely on allergen declaration information provided to make decisions on what food is safe for them to purchase and eat.\n\nRefer to food allergies (external site) and the Food Allergen Portal (external site) on the FSANZ website for more information.\n\nIngredients list\n\nUnless specifically exempted, food package labels must list all:\n\ningredients (this means any substance, including a food additive, used in the preparation, manufacture or handling of a food)\n\ncompound ingredients (an ingredient made up of 2 or more ingredients, such as spaghetti which is made up of flour, egg and water).\n\nIngredients and compound ingredients must be listed in descending order of their ingoing weight at the time the food is manufactured. There are limited exceptions to this.\n\nThe names of ingredients should be sufficiently detailed to describe the ingredient ensure they are not false, misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive.\n\nFor guidance on the labelling of ingredients refer to FSANZ’s Ingredient Labelling of Foods User Guide (external site).\n\nPercentage labelling\n\nCertain packaged foods labels must show the percentages of the ‘characterising’ ingredients in the food product, if the key ingredient is mentioned in the food description.\n\nFor example, if yoghurt is called ‘strawberry yoghurt’ then the amount of strawberries within the yoghurt must be listed as a percentage in the ingredient list.\n\nRefer to FSANZ for information on Standard 1.2.10 – Characterising Ingredients and Components of Food.\n\nRefer to ingredient list and percentage labelling of foods (external site) for further guidance.\n\nFood additives in most packaged food must be listed in the statement of ingredients on the label.\n\nMost food additives must be listed by their class name followed by the name of the food additive or the food additive number, for example, Colour (Caramel I) or Colour (150a). Enzymes and most flavourings (or flavour) do not need to be named or identified by a food additive number and can be labelled by their class name only.\n\nThe class name indicates what the food additive does (i.e. its purpose). Read the list of the most common class names of food additives(external site).\n\nRefer to food additive labelling (external site) on the FSANZ website for more detail.\n\nYou can only base health claims on food-health relationships that have been substantiated according to Standard 1.2.7. All health claims must be supported by scientific evidence to the same degree of certainty, whether they are pre-approved by us or self-substantiated by food businesses.\n\nStandard 1.2.7 – Nutrition, health and related claims in the Food Standards Code set out requirements for making nutrition content and health claims about food.\n\nRefer to Getting Your Claims Right - A guide to complying with the Nutrition, Health and Related Claims Standard of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (external site)\n\nFurther information is available at nutrition, health and related claims (external site).\n\nThe requirement for nutrition information is detailed in Standard 1.2.8 of the Food Standards Code (external site).\n\nThe nutrition information panel details the amount of nutrients in the food, including:\n\nenergy (kilojoules or calories)\n\nprotein\n\nfat\n\nsaturated fat\n\ncarbohydrate\n\nsugars\n\nsodium (salt).\n\nInformation must be presented in a standard format which shows the average amount per serve and per 100 g (or 100 mL if liquid) of the food.\n\nRefer to nutrition information panels (external site) on the FSANZ website for more information.\n\nYou can create your own nutrition information panel using the Nutrition Information Calculator (external site).\n\nTruth in labelling\n\nFair trading laws and food laws in Australia and New Zealand require that labels do not misinform consumers through false, misleading or deceptive representations. In Australia, this legislation includes the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) contained in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, and state and territory Fair Trading Acts and Food Acts. In New Zealand, this legislation includes the Food Act 2014 and Fair Trading Act 1986.\n\nIn Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforces the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. In New Zealand, the Commerce Commission is responsible for enforcing the Fair Trading Act 1986.\n\nName or description of the food\n\nFoods must be labelled with an accurate name or description that indicates the true nature of the food, for example ’Strawberry Yoghurt’ should contain strawberries. If it were to contain strawberry flavouring rather than real strawberries, the label should indicate that it is strawberry flavoured yoghurt.\n\nWeights and measures\n\nSuppliers must label food products with accurate weights and measures information (the quantity of food contained in a package). Weights and measures declarations are regulated by the Australian National Measurement Institute and the Trading Standards New Zealand.\n\nLegibility requirements\n\nThe Food Standards Code requires that labels must be legible and prominent so they are distinct from the background, and in English. The size of the type in warning statements must be at least 3 mm high, except on small packages where the size of the type must be at least 1.5 mm high.\n\nRefer to Truth in labelling, weights and measures and legibility (external site) on the FSANZ website for more information."
