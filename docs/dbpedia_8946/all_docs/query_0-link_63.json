        "text": "The past couple of years in Australia, and globally, live music has seen a complete halt and a rollercoaster of emotions within the industry. At a time when the music scene needs a place in which creativity and inclusivity can thrive, Australia’s newest and independent label, Archangel Records has swooped in to amp things up.\n\nAs the latest sub-label of Golden Robot Global Entertainment Group, Archangel Records aims to support women and their music, thanks to Australian music-lovers and co-founders, Jasmine Robins and Kay McRae – two young, female employees of Golden Robot.\n\nJasmine and Kay are both in the game to change the way that local music operates, and their label is built around a shared desire to support independent women and their music. With their combined experience, the venture is set to provide elegant and modern representation for women on the Golden Robot roster.\n\nAfter their official launch in July 0f 2022, Archangel Records already boasts an impressive line-up of signed artists with an inclusive range of genres and people. These artists include the likes of Meeanjin/Brisbane based singer-songwriter Ella Fence, Indonesian boundary-pushers SCALLER, and Texan alt-rock outfit Tough On Fridays.\n\nQuite fittingly, Archangel takes inspiration from the definition of the word ‘archangel’ itself – ‘angel of the highest stature’, and beings which are ‘fierce, powerful, and relentless’. Jasmine and Kay draw on these qualities as the main focus for their label.\n\nKay McRae says, “Nothing feels better than being in your element. Listening to music, creating connections and new experiences, it’s amazing. As time has gone on, I’ve noticed that something is lacking in this industry, and that’s women. I want to change that.”\n\nJasmine Robins adds, “The music industry is fast paced and fierce, but rewarding to work in. Seeing releases go out and watching them do well, knowing that you’ve had a hand working on them, is an incredible feeling.”\n\nWhile CEO and founder of Golden Robot, Mark Alexander-Erber shares, “I am over the moon to not only have two hard working and loyal staff members as part of our global team, but they have shown an entrepreneurial attitude and flair at such a young age.\n\n“I would be crazy not to back their initiative and leadership in the undertaking of this new label. They have my full support and the backing of the Golden Robot International machine in every way,” Mark finishes.\n\nAll images supplied."
