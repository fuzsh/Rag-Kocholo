        "text": "LUZIA is inspired by the people, places, and stories that define Mexico. Take a journey through a dream of Mexico, from the folklore of old to the urban landscape of today. LUZIA takes you to an imaginary Mexico, like in a waking dream, where light (“luz” in Spanish) quenches the spirit and rain (“lluvia”) soothes the soul. With a surrealistic series of grand visual surprises and breathtaking acrobatic performances, LUZIA cleverly brings to the stage multiple places, faces and sounds of Mexico taken from both tradition and modernity."
