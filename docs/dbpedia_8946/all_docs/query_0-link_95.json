        "text": "All This Filth, the dynamic and trailblazing metallers known for their industrial tinged groove metal sound and impassioned lyrics, have set the stage ablaze with the announcement of their signing with US record label Brutal Records for their much-anticipated new album titled “Tomorrow Will Be Better?“. Alongside this exciting news, the band has also dropped a thrilling new single, giving fans a glimpse into the sonic journey that awaits.\n\nThe album “Tomorrow Will Be Better?” will be released worldwide on February 9th 2024 via Brutal Records and is a testament to the band’s growth and experimentation, pushing boundaries towards new levels. Their unique blend of genres & influences coupled with soul-stirring lyrics promises an auditory experience that is both profound and thought-provoking.\n\nIn sync with this announcement, All This Filth has released their latest single and opening track “It’s Never Going To Be Ok“, providing a taste of the full release that awaits fans. The single showcases their musical prowess and is a testament to the band’s dedication to delivering electrifying and soulful music that resonates with a diverse audience.\n\nVocalist Brendan Preston comments on the single: “This new single was deliberately written as the intro track to the album. Thematically this album picks up right from where the last album, “Misery Season” left off. In short, the track basically says, “You’ve survived Misery Season and all the hardships involved in that, now what? Where do we go from here and how do we survive the new obstacles that the world throws at you both internally and externally?”\n\nOn the inspiration behind the opening line in the track: “Interesting fact, the repetition of ‘What the fuck?’ in the chorus comes from when I was involved in a pretty serious car crash. Basically I was on my way home from a gig just before the lockdowns in 2020 and a car ran a stop sign and I crashed straight into it. It happened so fast all I could say was “What the fuck?”. Could’ve been my last words. Police said my partner and I were lucky to walk away from the wreck.”\n\nOn the theme of the album, Brendan states: “Thematically this album picks up right from where ‘Misery Season’ left off. I’ve survived Misery Season and all that comes with that but now what? Where do I go from here? How do I survive in this world that’s so cruel? How do I overcome the hell inside me as well as the hell outside that we humans have created for ourselves? It’s a fucked up world and I gotta work out how to get through.”\n\nBrendan adds: “There’s also some unfinished business on this album from ‘Misery Season’. The track ‘Skyline’ could’ve been on the last album but I’m glad it’s finally been realised on this album”.\n\nTo the uninitiated, All This Filth are a Metal band from Perth, Western Australia. They blend many different Metal and heavy sub genres including Groove Metal, Thrash, Hardcore, Death Metal, Industrial Metal and even hints of Sludge and Nu-Metal to create a unique blend of aggressive fury. Strongly influenced by bands such as Fear Factory, Chimaira, Devildriver and Lamb Of God, the essence of what metal really means is expressed sonically through the crushing riffs, solid drums and ballsy bass, while being dynamically shaped with electronic keys and audio samples.\n\nAll This Filth previously released the first single off the album “Still Bleeds My Heart” in late 2022 along with a music video which premiered on Heavy Magazine and has gained thousands of views and listens since it’s release. The band followed the release supporting Powerman 5000 in their hometown of Perth in Western Australia after which the track received a nomination for Western Australia Music Song Of The Year in the Heavy/Metal category.\n\n“Tomorrow Will Be Better?” was recorded from May 2021 to October 2022 at Sumo Studios in Perth, Western Australia. The album was produced by Tristan Sturmer, mixed by Daniel Thabet at Liquid Studios in Dorset, Vermont USA and mastered by Grammy award winning engineer Alan Douches (Cannibal Corpse, Devildriver, Prong) at West West Side Music in New Windsor, New York USA. Album Artwork & Layout was handled by Kat Atkinson at Beautiful Chaos Art and Design.\n\nmorrow Will Be Better?” will be released worldwide on February 9th 2024 via Brutal Records and will be available on all digital streaming platforms, digital download and on CD & Vinyl.\n\nPre-orders available at\n\nhttp://www.allthisfilth.com/ tomorrowwillbebetter\n\nAll This Filth will hit the road in support of the new single with 3 shows in Victoria from November 24-26 including an appearance at Killfest on November 25th.\n\nTOUR DATES\n\nFriday, November 24: Sound System Studios, Sunbury VIC\n\nSaturday, November 25: Killfest: Kilmore VIC\n\nSunday, November 26: The Workers Club, Fitzroy VIC\n\nFriday, December 1: Badlands Bar, Perth WA\n\nSaturday, January 6: Munk & Petal Festival: Brisbane QLD"
