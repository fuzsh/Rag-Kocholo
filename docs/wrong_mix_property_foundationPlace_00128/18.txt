Globe created a partnership between Nokia, Roger Michell, the Director of Notting Hill, and Ellie Goulding to create a piece of content to showcase the new Nokia handset’s superior picture quality.

Globe created a short film (starring Ellie Goulding) shot entirely on the Nokia Lumia 1020 phone which became, not only a short film but also Ellie’s official music video for ‘How Long Will I Love You’ and a ‘Behind the Scenes’

The official music video from this campaign currently has over 72 million views.
