        "text": ",\n\nETBrandEquity\n\nUpdated On Dec 6, 2016 at 09:44 AM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nThere used to be a time when cell phones barely extended beyond the brand, 'Nokia'. For over three decades, the Finnish company hammered most of its competitors to rule and dominate the market. The mobile giant did take a few missteps along the way and found itself getting trampled by heavyweights like Apple and Samsung, but after a brief hiatus, Nokia is right back on track, ready to hit the market with a vengeance boasting of an all new revamp.\n\nWhile Nokia has been around since 1865 (originally selling toilet paper rolls, cables and forestry products), their foray into mobile devices happened with the Nokia Mobira Senator in 1982. It was the first Nokia phone to function on the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, which happened to be the world's first international cellular network to allow international roaming.\n\nSince the massive success of the Mobira Senator, there was no looking back for Nokia.\n\nIn 1987, Nokia launched the Cityman NMT 900, a first of its kind, hand-portable phone. The phone created a splash in the mainstream market at a time where world economies were opening up and businesses were booming, catapulting Nokia into prominence.\n\nNokia Cityman NMT 900 spot:\n\nTapping on the success that the brand had been receiving from the business sector, Nokia launched feature phones that specifically catered to the needs of the millennial businessman. After several handsets that were game changing in their own right, in 1992, Nokia launched the 9000 Communicator, the first all-in-one phone that fused fax facilities, a calendar, e-mail and internet options in a single handheld device.\n\nNokia 9000 Communicator spot:\n\nIn 1994, India opened its doors to the influx of private companies in the telecom sector and the first cellular services licenses were given out. A year later, in 1995 Nokia's made its debut in the Indian market.\n\nIndia was a fertile market and Nokia reigned undisputed for well over a decade. The brand introduced several phones exclusively to the Indian market like the Nokia Asha series and the Nokia 1100, keeping in mind price sensitivity and primary Indian telecom needs.\n\nThe Nokia 1100 'Made for India' spot:\n\nNokia 3105 spot:\n\nGlobally, Nokia has been associated with Wieden & Kennedy as their agency on record. However, in 2007 Nokia hired WPP's JWT, to handle it's creative business. The company is also known to work with various small agencies on assignment basis, however, WPP's Wunderman, remains Nokia's lead digital agency, while Dentsu's Carat, stays as the brand's media agency.\n\nWhile Nokia was at its peak in India, it churned out several commercials for its cell-phone models, ploughing the market. The Indian 'middle-class' found themselves being exposed to a cell-phone modeled especially for them. The device which was once reserved for the elite business class, found its way into the hands on the masses and Nokia reaped the benefits of their decision to introduce subtle Indian nuances to their phones such as introducing 'Saare Jahan Se Accha'– on a Nokia 5110 as a ringtone and incorporating Hindi as a registered language in the Nokia 3210 handset. In fact, India was such a vibrant market for the company that, it was chosen as the base for the global launch of Nokia's sub-$100 handset, Asha.\n\nNokia Asha 305 smartphone spot:\n\nOf course, several celebrities endorsed the brand over the years especially as brands like Samsung, LG and Apple began emerging as notable rivals in the smartphone market. Nokia roped in Shah Rukh khan and Priyanka Chopra to amplify sales and cement mass connect with a generation that was in a constant state of unpredictability and flux.\n\nPriyanka Chopra's ad on Nokia's Supernova series did the trick and the company stabilized its grip on the Indian market. However, due to Nokia's repeated inability to evolve ever since, the company began lagging behind in sales again. In 2012, the once unscathed and triumphant leader of the cell phone market in India, came second to Samsung during that fiscal year with a 27.2% market share recording an 18% drop in revenue, according Indian telecom trade publication, Voice & Data.\n\nNokia Supernova spot starring Priyanka Chopra:\n\nShah Rukh Khan's affiliation with Nokia had been a long standing one. While the actor was brand ambassador for Nokia, the duo collaborated on several ads. Nokia was even registered as the official partner for Khan's IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders. However, the worrying decline in sales called for urgent measures. The 'baadshah' of Bollywood was roped in to salvage the situation and he starred in the latest string of Nokia Lumia's ad campaigns.\n\nNokia Lumia Campaign featuring Shah Rukh Khan:\n\nUnfortunately, both, the campaign and the handset failed to make a mark with the target audience and Nokia slowly fizzled out. However, as Shah Rukh Khan's popular dialogue goes, \"Picture abhi baaki hai, mere dost\", Nokia too hasn't faded into oblivion. As reported by Brand Equity, Nokia will be making a highly anticipated come back into the smartphone game with a completely revamped order. Nokia also has a plan for how it will be banking on 'brand recall' for its come back.\n\nWill Nokia succeed in connecting people, again? Let's wait for 2017 to find more about it.\n\nBy ,\n\nETBrandEquity\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETBrandEquity App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
