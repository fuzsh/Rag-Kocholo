Announced on 27 April 2010, the Nokia N8 was the first device to run on the Symbian^3 mobile operating system and it was the company's flagship device for the year.[4] It was released on 30 September 2010 at the Nokia Online Store before being released in markets around the world on 1 October 2010.[5] There were two versions made, the N8 and the N8-00. The N8 was made for Vodafone and locked to its networks,[6] and the N8-00 was made by Microsoft and open network.[7]\n\nThe N8 has a 3.5-inch AMOLED display with 16 gigabytes of mass memory, and features a 12-megapixel camera, the second time a camera of such megapixel count was used (the first one being the Sony Ericsson Satio in 2009) with a Xenon flash (like the Nokia N82) and with a very large 1/1.83\" sensor size (larger than most point-and-shoot cameras of the time).[8] It also has 720p HD video recording, a pentaband 3.5G radio, and an FM transmitter. Among the connectivity features are an HDMI output, USB On-The-Go, and Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n.[9]\n\nThe N8 was an important device for Nokia in its bid against increasing competition in the smartphone industry, and its revamped Symbian^3 software was also important. The device was delayed several times pushing its release date by several months, which had a negative impact on the company.[10][11] Despite mixed views on the Symbian software, the N8's hardware build and camera quality were very well received, with many calling it the \"best camera phone\".[12][13] The N8 would also become Nokia's last flagship device running Symbian, due to Nokia Lumia 800 in 2011 which ran on Windows Phone software. The N8's Symbian successor, Nokia 808 PureView, appeared in 2012.[14]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe previous flagship phone in the Nseries was the N97, which was criticised for its initial firmware issues. Anssi Vanjoki, Nokia's Executive Vice President for Markets, said in an interview that software quality control would be better than for the N97.[15] The N97's reception was highly negative and tarnished the company's image in the market.[16] The N8 was the first device to feature the Symbian^3 operating system. Initially scheduled for the second quarter of 2010, the N8 was pushed back to the third quarter,[17] being finally released on 30 September 2010 due to 'final amendments'. The N8 became the product with the most customer pre-orders in Nokia's history up to the point of its release[18] and sales in Q4 2010 were estimated to be almost 4 million.[19]\n\nThe previous Nokia phone with a focus on photography had been the N86 8MP, which has an 8-megapixel sensor and had become available in June 2009.[20]\n\nThe N8 was the second Nokia to have a capacitive touchscreen, following the X6, and the first with multi-touch.[21]\n\nDesign\n\n[edit]\n\nBody\n\n[edit]\n\nAnodised aluminium monocoque case\n\nAvailable in silver white, dark grey, orange, blue, green, pink and brown\n\nSize: 113.5 mm × 59 mm × 12.9 mm\n\nWeight (including battery): 135 g (4.8 oz)\n\nCamera with Carl Zeiss optics and 12.1-megapixel resolution\n\nDisplay\n\n[edit]\n\n3.5\" AMOLED screen with capacitive touch\n\n640 × 360 pixels nHD (16:9 aspect ratio)\n\nGorilla glass protective layer[22]\n\n16M Colors\n\nHardware\n\n[edit]\n\n680 MHz ARM11 processor (ARM v6 architecture)\n\n256 MB RAM\n\nBroadcom BCM2727 GPU[23] VideoCore III Multimedia Engine with dedicated 3D Graphics HW Accelerator with OpenGL-ES 1.1/2.0 support. 32 Mtriangles/sec[24][25]\n\n16 GB internal memory\n\nMicroSD memory card slot, hot swappable, up to 32 GB\n\nThe Nokia N8 has dual charging options,[26] allowing it to be charged both from a standard-pin Nokia charger, and through the micro-USB port.\n\nThe Nokia N8's battery compartment is internally contained and thus the battery is not entirely straightforwardly removable or replaceable by users. Nonetheless, although the procedure is not endorsed by Nokia,[27][28] it is possible with the correct tool and careful handling to change the battery.[29][30]\n\nBL-4D 1200 mAh Lithium-ion battery.\n\nStandard Nokia 2 mm charger connector\n\nTalk-time (maximum):\n\nGSM 720 min.\n\nWCDMA 350 min.\n\nStandby time (maximum):\n\nGSM 390 h\n\nWCDMA 400 h\n\nVideo playback time (H.264 720p, 30 fps, maximum): 6.5 h\n\nVideo recording time (H.264 720p, 30 fps, maximum): 3.5 h\n\nMusic playback time (maximum): 54 h\n\nData and connectivity\n\n[edit]\n\nGPRS/EDGE class B, multislot class 33\n\nHSDPA Cat9, maximum speed up to 10.2 Mbit/s,[31] HSUPA Cat5 2.0 Mbit/s\n\nWLAN IEEE 802.11 b/g/n\n\nTCP/IP support\n\nCapability to serve as data modem\n\nSupport for MS Outlook synchronization of contacts, calendar and notes\n\nBluetooth 3.0\n\nHDMI mini C connector\n\nHigh-Speed USB 2.0 Micro USB connector with USB charging\n\nUSB On-The-Go[32] with built-in support for mass storage devices, HID keyboard, mice, and USB headphones\n\n3.5 mm Nokia AV connector supporting the connection of hands-free headsets, regular headphones, or a Nokia TV-out cable\n\nFM radio\n\nShort-range FM transmitter\n\nOperating frequency\n\n[edit]\n\nQuadband GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900\n\nPentaband WCDMA 850/900/1700/1900/2100\n\nAutomatic switching between WCDMA & GSM bands\n\nFlight mode\n\nSensors\n\n[edit]\n\nOrientation sensor\n\nDigital compass (Magnetometer)\n\nProximity sensor\n\nAmbient light detector\n\nSoftware\n\n[edit]\n\nSoftware platform and user interface\n\n[edit]\n\nThe N8 was the first Nokia smartphone device to run on the Symbian^3 operating system.[33]\n\nFrom 7 February 2012, Nokia Belle update was available for N8 through Nokia Suite.

In January 2011, Nokia stopped offering the Ovi Music Unlimited service in 27 of the 33 countries where it was offered. The service is still offered in China, India and Indonesia with a 12-month subscription and in Brazil, Turkey and South Africa with a 6-month subscription. The reason for the closure in a majority of the markets where Ovi Music Unlimited was offered was due to a lack of popularity.[39]\n\nOvi Music store\n\nDigital rights management support: Windows Media DRM and OMA DRM 2.0\n\nShort-range FM transmitter\n\nStereo FM radio (87.5–108 MHz/76–90 MHz) with RDS\n\nAccessories\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nokia Mobile TV Headset provides DVB-H TV.[40]\n\nThe Nokia Digital Radio Headset (CU-17a) allows the device to receive DAB and DAB+ transmissions.\n\nDevelopment support\n\n[edit]\n\nApplications can be developed using the Nokia Qt framework.[41]\n\nPromotion\n\n[edit]\n\nTo highlight the capabilities of the Nokia N8 camera, Nokia created a short film, The Commuter, in October 2010. Directed by the McHenry Brothers and starring Dev Patel, Ed Westwick, Charles Dance and Pamela Anderson, the seven-minute film was shot entirely on the phone's 720p camera. For the Spanish promotion of the phone they also created a short video featuring luminescent puppets, called \"Love Knot\".[citation needed]\n\nThe phone was also used to film Drums of Death's \"Won't Be Long\" music video.[citation needed]\n\nUsing CellScope technology, Nokia also released another film called \"Dot\" which they marketed to as the world's smallest stop-motion animation character.[citation needed]\n\nThe device also appeared on the popular Showtime TV show Dexter,[42] and the BBC TV series Hustle, as well as the film TRON: Legacy.[43] It is also the phone Sarah Lund uses in the third series of The Killing.[citation needed]\n\nIn Asian countries, it was promoted differently through the fictional character Pier Roxas on Nokia's Project Gener8 by Young & Rubicam Philippines. He also appeared on the GMA talk show Startalk to promote the device.[44]\n\nThe \"Nokia Shorts 2011\" competition involved 8 Short films shot on a Nokia N8. The winner was \"Splitscreen: A Love Story\".[45]\n\nThe independent film Olive, which is the first feature-length film of about 90 minutes to be made entirely with a cell phone, uses the Nokia N8 along with an old-fashioned video camera attachment with a 35 mm lens made exclusively for the device and to trick the audience by not realizing it was made from the Nokia N8.[citation needed]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Nokia products\n\nComparison of smartphones\n\nComparison of Symbian devices\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
