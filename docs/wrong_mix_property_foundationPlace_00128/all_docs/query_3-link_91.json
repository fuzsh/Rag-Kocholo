        "text": "Create and Customize your Own Billing Dashboard with Atlas Charts\n\nWhen it comes to managing tech stacks, controlling expenses is a top priority for our customers. This summer, we've made it easier than ever to optimize your spend with new ways for visualizing and analyzing your Atlas billing data. Through Cost Explorer , you can conveniently analyze your billing data right within the Billing section of the Atlas UI. But that's not all! We know many of you prefer to craft your own Atlas billing dashboards – allowing you to customize, embed, and share tailor-made charts to align with your optimization strategies. With the latest release of Atlas Charts , we’ve made this easier than ever with a new out-of-the-box billing dashboard! Gone are the days of navigating to a Github repository , running scripts from your command line and manually importing a dashboard to gain insights into your Atlas bill. We understand the importance of quickly accessing and being able to answer questions about your Atlas spending, so we’ve made it a top priority to enhance your user experience by streamlining this process. Now, when you enter Charts, you’ll find a dedicated Ingestions page conveniently located in the left navigation menu. Here, you can effortlessly set up your scheduled billing data ingestion by entering your Organization API keys (or create them up following the steps we’ve included), and selecting the deployment and database where you’d like your data to live. Once you’ve completed the configuration and hit Save , your first ingestion job will be kicked off. Fresh data will be retrieved from the Atlas Billing API once a day to ensure the data in your nominated database is always up-to-date. After this initial job is complete, you can click Add and open to explore your new billing dashboard. Just like any other dashboard, you have the flexibility to filter and highlight charts within the billing dashboard, and customize or add new ones to tailor the dashboard to your specific needs. You could even share the billing dashboard with your team or schedule regular dashboard reports to be sent to your email. You have the freedom to manage your ingestion configuration at any time from the Ingestions page, whether you need to update your API key pair or change the database in which your data is stored. To learn more about visualizing your billing data in Atlas Charts, be sure to check out our documentation . We’re always listening to feature requests that will enhance using Charts across teams, so if you have any requests or feedback, please share them with us here . New to Atlas Charts? Get started today by logging into or signing up for MongoDB Atlas , deploying or selecting a cluster, and activating Charts for free.\n\nOctober 12, 2023\n\nThe MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP) is Now Available\n\nAt MongoDB, everything starts with helping our customers solve their application and data challenges (regardless of use case). We talk to customers every day, and they’re excited about gen AI. But they’re also unsure how to move from concept to production, and need to control costs. So, finding the right way to adopt AI is critical. We’re therefore thrilled to announce the general availability of the MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP) ! A first-of-its-kind program, MAAP will help organizations take advantage of rapidly advancing AI technologies. It offers customers a wealth of resources to put AI applications into production: reference architectures and an end-to-end technology stack that includes integrations with leading technology providers, professional services, and a unified support system to help customers quickly build and deploy AI applications. Indeed, some early AI adopters found that legacy technologies can’t manage the multi-modal data structures required to power AI applications. This was compounded by a lack of in-house skills and the perceived risk of integrating disparate components without support. As a result, businesses couldn’t take advantage of AI advances quickly enough. Which is why we’re excited that MAAP is now available: the MAAP program and its ecosystem of companies addresses these challenges comprehensively. MAAP offers customers the right expertise and solutions for their use cases, and removes integration risk. Meanwhile, the MAAP ecosystem seamlessly integrates many of the world’s leading AI and tech organizations—a real value-add for customers. While the MAAP ecosystem is just getting started, it already includes tech leaders like Accenture, AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as gen AI innovators Anthropic, Cohere, and LangChain. The result is a group of organizations that will enable customers to build differentiated, production-ready AI applications, while aiming to deliver substantial return on investment. Unlocking the power of data… It’s an understatement to say that the AI landscape is ever-changing. To keep pace with the latest developments and customer expectations, access to trusted collaborators and a robust support system are critical for organizations who want to innovate with AI. What’s more, innovating with AI can mean tackling data silos and overcoming limited in-house technical expertise—which MAAP solves for with a central architecture for gen AI applications, pre-configured integrations, and professional services to ensure organizations’ requirements are met. This framework provides flexibility for technical and non-technical teams alike, empowering them to leverage AI and company data for tasks specific to their department, no matter their preferred cloud or LLM. The MAAP ecosystem—representing industry leaders from every part of the AI stack—includes Accenture , Anthropic , Anyscale , Arcee AI , AWS , Cohere , Credal , Fireworks AI , Google Cloud , gravity9 , LangChain , LlamaIndex , Microsoft Azure , Nomic , PeerIslands , Pureinsights , and Together AI . MongoDB is uniquely qualified to bring together the solutions MAAP offers: MongoDB customers can use any LLM provider, we can run anywhere (on all major cloud providers, on premises, and at the edge), and MongoDB offers seamless integrations with a variety of frameworks and systems. Perhaps most importantly, thousands of customers already rely on MongoDB to power their mission-critical apps, and we have years of experience helping customers unlock the power of data. The ultimate aim of MAAP is to enable customers to get the most out of their data, and to ensure that they can confidently innovate with AI. A recent success is Anywhere Real Estate (NASDAQ: HOUS), the parent company of well-known brands like Century 21, Coldwell Banker, and Sotheby’s International Realty. Anywhere partnered with MongoDB to drive their digital transformation, and is now delving into the potential of MAAP to fast-track their AI adoption. By harnessing MongoDB’s expertise, Anywhere is set to future-proof its tech stack and to excel in an increasingly AI-driven landscape. “Generative AI is a game-changer for Anywhere, and we’re integrating it into our products with enthusiasm,” said Damian Ng, Senior Vice President of Technology at Anywhere. “MongoDB has been an invaluable partner, helping us rapidly explore and develop new approaches and opportunities. The journey ahead is exciting!” …and clearing the way for AI innovation MAAP offers customers a clear path to developing and deploying AI-enriched applications. The cornerstone of MAAP is MongoDB : applications are underpinned by MongoDB, which securely unifies real-time, operational, unstructured, and AI-related data without the need for bolt-on solutions. MongoDB’s open and integrated architecture provides easy access to the MAAP partner network and enables the extension and customization of applications. With MAAP, customers can: Accelerate their gen AI development with expert, hands-on support and services . MAAP expert services, combining the strengths of MongoDB Professional Services and industry-leading gen AI consultancies, will enable customers to rapidly innovate with AI.
