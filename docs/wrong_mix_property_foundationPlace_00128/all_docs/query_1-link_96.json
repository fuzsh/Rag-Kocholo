        "text": "Nokia has launched new phones and a 007 Kevlar Case, but the full ad campaign to promote the brand’s partnership with No Time to Die (2020) will be delayed until November. And will any of these new Nokia phones be seen in No Time To Die?\n\nNokia 5.3, Nokia 1.3, Nokia 5310 and Nokia 8.3 5G\n\nFour new Nokia phones were officially revealed today: the Nokia 8.3, Nokia 5.3, Nokia 1.3 and the 5310 and a teaser advertisement was put online starring Lashana Lynch as 00 Agent Nomi who uses a cyan green Nokia 7.2 in the ad.\n\nNokia phones in No Time To Die\n\nOne or more of the phones launched today might actually appear in the film No Time To Die, most likely the Nokia 8.3 with its 5G capabilities, possibly used by Nomi.\n\nBesides the 5G model, two other models have been officially mentioned to press by HMD (owner of Nokia): the Nokia 7.2 and the Nokia 3310.\n\nThe first images from the No Time To Die trailers of James Bond holding a phone suggest he will be the one using a Nokia 7.2, 6.2 or similar, a black or charcoal version (pictured on the right). This is not yet confirmed but based on the connection between Nokia and No Time To Die and the blurred images of the phone held by Bond in the trailer it almost certainly must be a Nokia. The model is hard to pin down as the phone seems to have a chrome / shiny side, which is different from any Nokia 7.2 or 6.2 available today. But this might be light effect, so it could still be the charcoal 7.2 as pictured.\n\nBond seems to be using a Nokia in grey or black ut the phone seems to have a chrome / shiny side, which is different from any Nokia 6.2, 7.2 or 8.3 available today (p.s. the shirt is by Rag & Bone)\n\nRegarding the Nokia 3310 in the film, some intelligence that we gathered suggests that the iconic Nokia 3310 update: 3210 (not a 3310) will make an appearance in Q's home office, but this is not confirmed. If the 3310 wil be seen and used by who stays a mystery for now.\n\nAnother possible Nokia might be seen below on M's desk. The photo is taken on the set during the Pinewood set visit of Prince Charles in 2019.\n\nA yet unidentified phone on the desk of M on the set at Pinewood\n\nAn explanation for the hard to identify phones of James Bond and M in these pictures might be that the phones were possibly prototype or prop phones, since the new Nokia models were not available yet.\n\nNokia No Time To Die Ad campaign\n\nWatch the Nokia No Time To Die teaser ad with Lashana Lynch that was launched today:\n\n\"The only gadget you will ever need\" begins as Nomi – a 00 agent, played by Lashana Lynch, who joins MI6 following Bond's retirement - arrives on a Triumph Thruxton motorcycle (Triumph is another partner of No Time To Die). Lashana Lynch wears a similar commando outfit as in No Time To Die. She climbs atop a London high-rise overlooking the River Thames. Here, she watches as a suspicious boat appears, prompting her to send a text message to fellow spy T on a cyan green Nokia 5.3 phone (update: previously I mentioned it was a Nokia 7.2 which looks very similar, but looking at the photo lenses and flash it's probably actually a 5.3. The footage might have been digitally altered, which has larer been done again for the final commercial released in September 2020, where the phone in her hands has suddenly become a Nokia 8.3 5G).\n\nLashana Lynch uses a Nokia 5.3 in the Nokia Ad Campaign\n\nNomi then asks \"Permission to engage\", and climbs and jumps off a few buildings, and the cliffhanger text appears \"To be continued...\", (the ad will probably shown in full in November).\n\nThe last scene is Nomi saying: \"M, can I call you back?\".\n\nNomi in the Nokia Ad Campaign which was filmed in London\n\nThe ad campaign was created by Grey London, and was written by Mark Fairbanks, Sue Higgs and Stephania Silveira. The commercial was directed by Amma Asante through Pulse. The production design is by Neal Callow who is art director for Daniel Craig's 007 films and one of the minds behind the 007 Elements, the Bond exhibit in Sölden.\n\nNo Time To Die was set to be released on 2 April, but producers postponed the movie until November 2020.\n\n\"Few cultural properties place technology at the heart of their appeal quite like No Time to Die,\" Juho Sarvikas, global chief product officer at Nokia parent HMD, said.\n\n\"Trust, security and iconic quality design are the foundations every Nokia phone is built upon and our values reflect those of No Time to Die and the trailblazing new 00 agent, Nomi. We take great pride in making the latest technology accessible to everyone and look forward to doing this via our latest partnership.\"\n\npromotional image of Lashana Lynch as Nomi for Nokia\n\nNokia has revealed that the film will see Agent Nomi, played by Lashana Lynch, using the new device and taking advantage of its 5G skills. In the ad campaign, she is using a Nokia 8.3 5G.\n\nLynch said: \"My first phone was actually a Nokia 3210 when I was about 10-years-old. In retrospect, it was my smartphone of the 90s. Being able to change the buttons and faces, whilst playing Snake blew my mind! So, after seeing how much Nokia smartphones have evolved over the years from my childhood to now, it's exciting to play Nomi who helps unveil a new smartphone for this iconic brand.\"\n\npromotional image of Lashana Lynch as Nomi for Nokia\n\nNokia's tagline for the new Bond campaign will be \"the only gadget you will ever need\"\n\nAbout the new Nokia phones\n\nHMD press release, 19 March 2020\n\nHMD Global, the home of Nokia phones, today announces three new Nokia smartphones, a new member of the Originals family and its brand-new hassle-free data roaming service.
