It seems there is not so much space left for QT in it. Whats NEXT? Our company made investment in developing software on QT for a desktop ... and now this fundamental base started to shake. If Qt is no more a priority, what about next releases and updates, what about bug fixes and support ... and finally what about innovation on QT platform. This was not cleared yet and we need answers.\n\nAs a personal user it seems I'll say bye bye to Nokia ... It's enough for me for this mess ... I invested much time in QT and mobile platform ... and now I have to drop everything in trashcan because there is no more meaning and future ... THANKS NOKIA\n\n\"This morning’s strategy announcement was a significant shift for Nokia, and all of the parts within Nokia, including Qt.\n\nGiven the many implications of this strategy change, we are taking a little bit of time before we contact all of our stakeholders to talk directly with them about what it all means.\"\n\nI would like to point out though that your investments into Qt are secure, independent of what Nokia will do. The whole code is available to you after all. Nobody can take what is released under LGPL (or whichever licensing option you took) away from you.\n\n[quote author=\"Tobias Hunger\" date=\"1297431339\"]\"This morning’s strategy announcement was a significant shift for Nokia, and all of the parts within Nokia, including Qt.\n\nGiven the many implications of this strategy change, we are talking a little bit of time before we contact all of our stakeholders to talk directly with them about what it all means.\"\n\nI would like to point out though that your investments into Qt are secure, independent of what Nokia will do.

It looked like it won’t get into WP7, but we can hope for it, I hope.\n\nLosing great contributions of trolls to desktop Qt is huge drawback though, so I don’t want Nokia really discontinuing Qt... Or selling / transferring rights of code to some other company.\n\nBut I hope all of you remember that Nokia is not Trolltech; a company who lives from Qt. Nokia lives from mobile phones; I suppose Ovi Market isn’t that profitable like Android’s or Apple’s alternatives are.\n\nHopes ... but ...\n\nat short term, qt will continue .. for sure ... Elop needs you for the transition ... But after...\n\nFor small company like mine, It's very disturbing to read Nokia new Roadmap ... I have invested since years in Qt ... and I see no commercial raison (the new roadmap for Nokia ...is clearly not technicall but just commercial ) why Nokia will continue Desktop and mobile Qt platform ... in fact good day for microsoft : find a way to sell wP7, kill meego and symbian and kill the only good commercial C++ platform ... viva dotnet ...\n\nHopes you can communicate on news that we can trust (see previous communication about meego and symbian ... http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Porting_Android_(Java)_applications_to_S60_5th_Edition\n\nI suppose now we will have porting Qt app to .Net"
