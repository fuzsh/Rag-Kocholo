        "text": "Public private partnership with Govt of Ghana, Ascend Digital, K-Net and MNOs in collaboration with strategic technology partners Radisys, Nokia and Tech Mahindra to deliver affordable mobile broadband across Ghana\n\nAT Ghana and Telecel Ghana aim to leverage India’s successful model of Affordable handsets, digital platform, localized content and applications\n\nMUMBAI (INDIA) AND ACCRA (GHANA); MAY 27, 2024: The Government of Ghana, Ascend Digital, K-NET, Radisys, Nokia, and Tech Mahindra, with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) AT Ghana and Telecel Ghana, today announce their partnership on a new shared infra Next-Gen InfraCo. (NGIC). This collaboration aims to deliver affordable 5G mobile broadband services across Ghana. The Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) has been awarded 5G license and expected to launch 5G services across Ghana within the next six months, followed by expansion to other parts of Africa.\n\nNext-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) will be the first 5G Mobile Broadband Shared Infrastructure Entity to build a nationwide 4G/ 5G network . The company will also work with MNO partners to launch affordable 4G / 5G-enabled FWA CPEs and smart phones in Ghana within this calendar year. The partnership aims to enhance the lives of Ghanaians by introducing digital services in education, healthcare, and digital payment transactions through P2P (peer-to-peer), P2M (peer-to-merchant) and M2M (merchant-to-merchant) systems , thereby reducing -digital divide and promoting financial inclusion. Additionally, the multiplayer partnership will support NGIC in the entire deployment of network infrastructure and associated services, as communications service providers (CSPs) are looking to address enterprise and consumer markets with enhanced digital services. To achieve this, Tech Mahindra will build a Cloud Native Core Network powered by leading OEM (original equipment manufacturer) platforms.\n\nNGIC plans to adopt India's successful model of affordable handsets, digital platforms, and localized content and applications. The goal is to replicate this high-speed mobile data model across Africa, beginning with Ghana.\n\nMrs. Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, Minister for Communications and Digitalization for the Republic of Ghana, said, “The creation of a shared 5G Mobile Broadband Infrastructure is critical for delivering affordable, high-speed data access to the people of Ghana and help achieve our Digital Ghana vision. The creation of NGIC as a neutral, shared platform, accessible to all mobile network operators and tower companies, will help to expand 5G services rapidly across the country. We are inspired by India's digital infrastructure and low-cost mobile data usage and keen to replicate it in Ghana.”\n\nMikko Lavanti, Senior Vice President, Middle East and Africa at Nokia, said, “Ghana holds immense potential for mobile broadband growth on the back of an unmet demand for connectivity. Establishing an Open Access Network like NGIC will foster innovation and create numerous opportunities across various sectors. We are proud of our partnership with NGIC in helping Ghana realize its digital vision and unlock its full potential.\n\nArun Bhikshesvaran, CEO, Radisys, said, \"Connectivity for all, through the use of open and disaggregated multi-access solutions, is a key component of Radisys’ initiatives to bridge the digital divide. By bringing Fixed Wireless Access alongside 4G and 5G cellular services to help drive economic growth and digital inclusion, Radisys looks forward to helping Ascend and NGIC build a disruptive and affordable shared broadband infrastructure across Ghana. In addition, our communications platform and digital applications will help create new digital experiences that empower the Ghanian community and foster sustainable and inclusive development.\"\n\nManish Mangal, Chief Technology Officer, Telecom & Global Business Head, Network Services, Tech Mahindra, said, \"Our partnership with Next Gen Infra Co. is based on a shared vision for digital connectivity and providing Network-as-a-Service to innovate and bring cost efficiency to the telecom market in Ghana and Africa. Echoing our promise to scale at speed, we aim to rapidly advance operations by building a Cloud Native Core Network with leading OEM platforms combined with Tech Mahindra's automation platform, netOps.ai. Together with NGIC, we will support the complete network infrastructure deployment and introduce high-speed 4G/5G services in the region.\"\n\nHarkirit Singh, CEO, Ascend Digital and Executive Director, NGIC, said, “NGIC intends to launch its wholesale 4G/ 5G Network as a Service and make it available to all mobile network operators within the next six months. We have proven strengths of our partners – Radisys, Nokia, and TechM, to scale the network and deliver affordable mobile broadband services to all Ghanaians. We intend to gradually expand to other parts of Africa as well. We will tap the capital markets and bring in strategic investors as and when required.”\n\nMohamad Ghaddar, COO, Telecel Ghana, said, \"Telecel encourages initiatives like NGIC’s neutral and ‘Network as a Service’ model, which will help create diverse network options for all telecom operators in Ghana. We are looking forward to the implementation of NGIC model with the right partners, which will enable us to leverage their infrastructure to deliver enhanced connectivity, better coverage, and innovative services to our services.\"\n\nLeo Skarlatos, CEO, AT Ghana, said, \"This partnership will enable us to leverage a neutral, shared platform and scale up our services across Ghana. We are confident that our customers will experience enhanced network quality and affordable services that they deserve. We look forward to working with NGIC and the MOCD, to contribute to the country’s digital transformation agenda.”\n\nAbout Ascend Solutions\n\nBased in Ghana, Ascend Digital Solutions collaborates with public institutions across Africa to unlock the potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
