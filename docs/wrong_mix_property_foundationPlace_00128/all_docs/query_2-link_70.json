Our invited guests were on the receiving end of the knowledge and expertise of some of the e-commerce world’s greatest minds and leaders, making for a successful annual rendition of Price Points Live. On this year’s stage was Prof. Hermann Simon, the co-founder and chairman of Simon-Kucher, who was a returning speaker at Price Points Live. He is known as the world’s leading expert on pricing and growth consulting. Also on the stage was Natalie Berg, an analyst, author and podcast host; Dr Doug Mattheus, a business executive and consultant in marketing, retail and branding; Gerrie Smits, a business consultant, speaker and author, and lastly, Cor Verhoeven, Group Product Manager at Bol, specialising in pricing and assortment insights. To conclude, the warm and confident Suyin Aerts returned as our host. Whether it be transparency in pricing, marketing or e-commerce practices, our panel of speakers bring more than a century of collective knowledge and experience to the table. So, what did our guests learn and take away from each of our speakers? What can brands and retailers understand about pricing, consumer behaviour and branding? Omnia shares the insights and knowledge pertinent to e-commerce success in 2024. Natalie Berg: E-commerce author and analyst “We are living in a perpetual state of disruption, and retail is no stranger to this, but the past few years have seen unprecedented levels of volatility and uncertainty,” shared Natalie. Whether we want to call it disruption, a seismic shift or a geopolitical and socio-economic tsunami, the one mitigating force to today’s ecommerce landscape was - and still is - Covid-19. “Covid has digitised our world - the way we live, the way we shop, or the way we exercise. And when it comes to shopping, most of it is still done in a brick-and-mortar store, but the majority of these sales are digitally influenced,” shares Natalie. This has brought brands and retailers to the popular omnichannel strategy, which has become more and more common and necessary. However, Natalie predicts that retail will start moving from omnichannel to ‘unified commerce’ which is “not just about being present in those channels but centralising those operations and connecting everything in real-time,”.. We see this already taking place with the partnership that shocked the e-commerce world in 2023 when Meta and Amazon announced that Meta users can shop Amazon products without even having to exit their Instagram or Facebook apps, creating a centralised and synonymous experience for social commerce and marketplaces’ shoppers. She goes on to speak about the customer’s time and how much more precious it is going to become for e-commerce and retail leaders. “28% of Amazon purchases take place in three minutes or less,” she stated,” so if you’re not saving a customer’s time, you have to be enhancing it.” A customer’s tolerance for mediocrity or for average service or experiences is getting lower and lower, which is how the customer experience has become the new currency. “It’s about really wowing your customers. Going beyond! Disrupting the status quo.” She shares that a new phenomenon is taking place because of this refreshed focus on the customer experience: The democratisation of white-glove service. “It’s a technology that is helping brands and retailers give this level of service,”.. This includes Walmart, in the US, which will go into your home to stock your kitchen with your newly purchased groceries while other retailers will collect your returns from your house when they make delivery, allowing the customer to kill two birds with one stone. Adidas in London has installed a system called “Bring it To Me” in change rooms where, if you want an item that’s in a different colour or size, a store assistant can collect it for you without you having to leave the change room. “Tech-enabled human touch - that’s what will separate the retailer winners from the retail losers,” Natalie argues. To conclude, Natalie speaks on how the use of AI will empower both e-commerce players and customers when shopping. “In the future, we won’t know where the physical world ends and the digital one begins,” giving an eerie yet exciting conclusion. “As a brand or retailer, standing still is the most dangerous thing you can do.” Dr Doug Mattheus: Consultant and branding expert Hailing from South Africa and living in the UK is Dr Doug Mattheus whose presentation focused on the art and science of brand building. So, what makes a brand long-lasting? “It is a mix of tangible and intangible features that, if properly managed, creates influence and generates value,” says Doug. But, as we’ve seen brands rise and fall over the last few decades, what are some of the factors that have created the most valuable brands in the world, from Apple to Mercedes Benz to Walmart? Creating a brand hook The ways in which a customer can get hooked on a brand are limitless: Reflecting back to the time he received his first pair of Nike shoes in high school, the one item Doug cared about keeping just as much as the shoes themselves was the box they came in. “It wasn’t just a box - it was a Nike box.” Fast-forward to adulthood, he visited a Harrods store and witnessed customers buy empty single-use packets and bags with the Harrods logo on them. In a more recent case, the fragrance of bath bombs and body scrubs in the air at a mall or airport has become one that is synonymous with LUSH. “Just follow your nose,” says Doug. “So, what is your brand hook?” On the contrary, we see brands like The Body Shop that have struggled to keep up with digitally-native challenger brands like Drunk Elephant, Glossier and Paula’s Choice in the personal care market and is undergoing mass closures across the US and EU. Doug’s advice to brands is to create a unique hook - whether it be in the sights, smells, sounds or physical world. What’s your differentiator from competitors? A small player in the award-winning wine industry in South Africa is a vineyard called Vergenoegd Wine Estate. By a large stretch, it is not the most well-known or award-winning brand. However, this boutique vineyard did not refrain from harnessing the commercial value of organic farming. The winemakers introduced runner ducks to the vineyard, which roamed around eating worms, snails, and bugs that could be detrimental to the vines. In addition, these ducks became a tonic for families and couples with kids wanting to experience the vineyard while having something fun for children. The ducks have become a unique feature to Vergenoegd Wine Estate and a key driver of foot traffic and revenue. “This is a great example of how a small player is not being defined by its smallness and not being intimidated by bigger players.” Multiple touchpoints for customers Stemming from Natalie’s thoughts on brands having to go the extra mile to impress customers, Doug shares that there are moments of magic around us at all times, and it is up to business leaders to find and develop those moments. However, where there is ease and innovation between brands and customers (like at Nordstrom in Seattle, USA who did not want to lose their “eyeball moments” with customers from rapid digitalisation, began offering curbside pick-up so they can still have face-to-face interactions with shoppers), there are also moments of friction and time-wasting that cause frustration for customers. It’s about fine-tuning interactions and creating moments that make a brand memorable. Relevance: Do you reinvent like a butterfly or a bull? As the title suggests, brands in many verticals, but especially in fashion, personal care, sporting goods, fitness, and electronics, are faced with the rapid rise of digitally-native brands that exist to challenge the status quo. In fact, these brands, which have only known a digital world, are, in fact called “challenger brands” because of the innovative approach to design, production, supply chains, customer interactions, marketing, and everything under the e-commerce sun. According to Doug, brands who reinvent like a butterfly are those who can go with the changes and challenges in front of them with agility and resilience while those who face reinvention like a bull may be stubborn and ignorant and may face their own downfall. Cor Verhoeven: Group Product Manager at Bol. Coming from one of Europe’s largest and most successful marketplaces, Bol., Cor Verhoeven delved into pricing, specifically how Bol. tackles bad prices on the platform and what the negatives are for a marketplace or e-commerce brand. “We have 38 million items for sale, 13 million active customers, and 50,000 unique selling partners. That means almost every home in the Netherlands and Belgium has bought something from Bol.,” says Cor. With numbers like that, it’s more than possible that a marketplace would run into pricing issues. “Part of our strategy is to make Bol. an equal playing field. Our sellers must be able to make a living off what they sell on Bol. - it’s not just us that needs to do well.” So, how does a customer-centric pricing strategy fall into this? “We all work hard to make sure that the price of an item is not the reason someone doesn’t buy something on Bol.,” says Cor. “Pricing is important because it positions you in a competitive market, it establishes customer trust, and it establishes customer lifetime value. Our success is caused by growth, monetising and retaining in a loop,” explained Cor. “Our three main beliefs when it comes to pricing are High-quality deals, trustworthy and reliable prices, and competitive prices in line with the market.” The balancing act between insult pricing and best-in-market pricing is tricky and precarious, which is why Bol. judges their products on their prices. “If a product’s price is above an allowable price, we take it offline to product the customer,” Cor stated. How does Bol. decide on what is an allowable price? “We source benchmarks. If a product has a benchmark, it’s given a classification - an insult price or an allowable price - and business rules are set,” explained Cor. “When we don’t have a price benchmark, that’s when we have little control.” When Bol. doesn’t have a price benchmark for a product, they utilise their data science model to predict a price while, daily, the model is manually looking for prices to benchmark those products.” The result is a price for a product that is more aligned with the market and within the boundaries of what a customer will accept. “Of course, taking insult prices offline decreases revenue, but what we get back in return is way bigger. The seller sees increased conversion,” said Cor. Sander Roose: CEO and Founder of Omnia Retail Joining the panel was our very own CEO Sander Roose who started his keynote speech by making good on a promise. “At the last Price Points Live event, I promised that Omnia would release a new platform sometime in 2023, and the whole Omnia team is proud to have achieved that.” As a veteran in the dynamic pricing industry, with 12 years at the helm of Omnia Retail, Sander brought to the stage what he believes are the pricing elements and design principles of successful dynamic pricing. According to Sander, there are three factors to successful dynamic pricing implementations: Clearly defined objectives; securing engagement and support; and the spirit of continuous learning. “Without clear objectives, you can have a strong pricing platform, but you won’t know how to harness it,” he said. “And as the market changes, you need to be able to change your objectives.” For the second factor, pricing managers and teams need to be fully on board: “If they don’t understand how prices are calculated, they will reject the implementation as a whole.” Then, the third factor speaks to a dynamic pricing user's ability to be agile and curious: “We see that customers that used the system most intensively to make iterations with their prices get the best results.” As a result, Omnia found that two key design principles for dynamic pricing success are necessary: flexibility and transparency. “Being able to automate any pricing strategy you can think of, to facilitate all the objectives, to keep control while the system is on autopilot, and finally, making sure the users are adopting the system.” Flexibility and Transparency A pricing platform needs to be able to support a vast array of pricing objectives and strategies. “A platform needs to be able to endure various high-level objectives. Perhaps on a global level, you have a profit maximisation objective while the strategy on lower levels, such as on a per country basis, may be different,” explained Sander. “For example, if your global brand has just launched in the Netherlands, you may want to maximise market share. Then, even further down, depending on your various verticals, you may want a stock-based strategy.” Flexibility must also be present not just in pricing strategies but in data collection and the recalculation process. Using the example of a Tesla self-driving car with a blacked-out windscreen, Sander makes the point that customers of dynamic pricing still need to be able to see and understand what’s going on - even if the system is on autopilot: “If you create transparency while the system is on autopilot, you can create buy-in from internal stakeholders and facilitate learning loops.” How flexibility and transparency exist in Omnia 2.0 The culmination of these two values resulted in the Pricing Strategy Tree, developed specifically for Omnia 2.0, making strategy building and interpretation easier and faster. “The copy-and-paste feature means a large D2C brand that wants to launch in a new country can simply execute their entire pricing strategy with just a few clicks by copying the strategy in the tree from another country. This is huge for an international customer to be able to do this.” Another feature called Path Tracking allows you to visually see how your strategy came to be, step by step. “This feature helps to validate if you set up the tree how you intended to,” explained Sander. Another feature that elevates transparency is Strategy Branch Statistics which works to answer burning questions from pricing managers: ‘Which part of my strategy is most impactful? The Strategy Branch Statistics feature works to show you which business rules are doing the work to give your prices.’ An additional feature highlighting transparency is the ability to name branches within the tree. The names not only help coworkers understand what you’ve built, but they differentiate the various strategies that are at play at the same time.

The names not only help coworkers understand what you’ve built, but they differentiate the various strategies that are at play at the same time. AI in pricing “From private label matching, creating automated weekly reports to send to category managers, to automated insights, AI is a powerful technology that has the potential to contribute to the superpowers we offer customers,” says Sander. However, as of today, Sander believes that AI is one part of the machine and should not be considered the holy grail of price setting. “The true need is goal-based pricing,” Sander says.”AI is a means and not an end.” Sander's vision for AI in Omnia’s pricing platform sees a move from granular pricing strategies that affect the business’s objectives to a scenario where the customer sets the objective, and the Omnia platform automates and optimises prices. “We want to move more and more towards goal-based pricing in our platform. We believe the end game for price automation will be rules and AI, not just AI, and the Pricing Strategy Tree allows for a rules and AI combination.” Prof. Hermann Simon: Founder of Simon-Kucher, author As a world-renowned expert in pricing and consulting, Prof. Hermann Simon joins the panel to share what he thinks are the hidden champions in e-commerce and retail and what their successful strategies are. Specifically, the small and midsized global market leaders with a market share of above 50% and that are little known to the public. “In China, which is by the largest global exporter, 68% of the exports come from small and midsized companies, and behind this number are the hidden champions,” says Hermann. “Inside super export performance requires large companies plus a very strong mid sector. Hidden champions, not large corporations, determine whether a country really excels in global competition. Hidden champions are an untapped treasure to learn about business success.” Focus and Globalisation What characterises these companies? “The three pillars of the hidden champion’s strategy are ambition, focus, and globalisation fueled with the tools of innovation, value and price,” shares Hermann. Focusing on your product makes your market small. How does hidden champions enlarge their market? An example of successful globalisation is Karcher, the global leader in high-pressure water hoses, which began internationalisation in the 1970s slowly and then accelerated in the 90s to become the global market share leader at 70%. Other examples include Deichmann, the largest shoe retailer in Europe, which sits in 31 countries across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the US. “The lesson here is that if you have a good product, multiply it by regional expansion,” says Hermann. Value and Price For successful companies, value comes from innovation and a closeness to the customer. But what drives innovation? The answer is different for hidden champions and the average company. Below is a pie chart where we can see how little an average company prioritises customer needs: What is the most important aspect of pricing? “It’s customer-perceived value. The willingness to pay is a mirror of perceived value, and therefore, value equals price,” explains Hermann. “Understanding, creating and communicating values are the key challenges in pricing.” Using the example of the iPhone, the cost has always been above the market average for a smartphone, yet the success of the product indicates it must obviously bring value to the customer. “Value drives price,” concludes Hermann. According to internal studies at Simon Kucher, only one-third of companies can say they have real pricing power. So, two-thirds are exposed to the sensitivities of the customer. “The result is that value-to-customer and pricing power is created by differentiating your product, changing the way customers perceive your products and your price, and changing the mindset and confidence of your own people in your company,” says Hermann. Closeness to customer “88% of hidden champions say that closeness to the customer is their biggest strength, even more than technology,” says Hermann. Simon-Kucher found that 38% of employees at hidden champion companies had regular contact with customers, while large corporations only had 8%. In retail, it is difficult to understand value perception because there are many competitors selling the same thing. This makes retail’s soft parameters, such as the store layout, service and friendliness, more helpful in understanding value perception. The challenge then becomes how do enterprises effectively communicate their value offering. “Hidden champions are true value leaders with their intense closeness to customers. They achieve a more profound understanding of a customer's needs; their continuous innovations create higher value, and they integrate customer needs and technology much better than the average company.” Gerrie Smits: Speaker and author Gerrie believes we’re getting customer-centricity all wrong. From his 25-plus years of experience in helping companies prioritise customers as well as how to deal with the changing digital world, he has found a common thread of issues: “Technology is getting in the way, companies are seeing customers as a target, and teams are siloing their responsibilities and not wanting to take on other responsibilities,” says Gerrie. “Companies are getting tech just for the sake of it, not because there is any use for it. If you’re going to invest in tech, make sure you have a competitive edge.” According to US business leaders, the number one skill a company needs to have to succeed in the digital world is empathy. “Technology is fantastic if you know what to do with it. My clients are driven by technology, and that’s not customer-centric.” When it comes to companies seeing customers as a target. “I’ve never met a company that doesn’t say they’re customer-centric - obviously,” says Gerrie. But there is a large difference between intent and action. “For example, Amazon has always said they are obsessed with understanding the customer. Yet still, they got it wrong when, in 2022, they reportedly lost $10 billion from dismal sales for their voice-activated Echo. “What brands need to understand is that there is only a small part of me that is your customer. The rest is me as a human being,” says Gerrie. “Seeing your audience as buyers, you are not fulfilling the whole potential.” Concluding Price Points Live 2024 In closing, our panel speakers joined Suyin on stage to answer a round of interesting questions and to share their final thoughts. “To drive loyalty, one must understand what your customers value,” said Natalie, while Doug shared that although pricing is vital to brand loyalty, it is not the only factor. Answering a question about how smaller players in e-commerce can grow and succeed against large enterprises, Natalie says, “It’s like Prof. Hermann said: It’s about focus. You have to know what your strengths are, and then you have to execute really well.” The world of e-commerce is set to make $6.3 billion in global sales in 2024, which is expected to increase to $8 billion in 2027. However, what’s more interesting is the amount of e-commerce users which is set to increase to 3.2 billion by 2029 - a third of the current world population. More shoppers don’t necessarily mean more revenue and sales, so it is safe to say that brands and retailers need to focus their efforts on pricing, innovation, unique marketing and frictionless experiences if they want a segment of the ever-growing pool of e-commerce users. With these insights and go-to strategies for elevating the success of brands and enterprises, Omnia is excited to see what the e-commerce landscape will be for our customers and other growing e-commerce companies. We’d like to thank all of our speakers - Natalie Berg, Dr Doug Mattheus, Prof. Hermann Simon, Gerrie Smit, Cor Verhoeven and our own Sander Roose - and our host, Suyin Aerts, for their knowledge and time spent at Price Points Live 2024.

Propelled by e-commerce, product ranges were increasing in scope, and the heightened transparency of online pricing resulted in frequent price fluctuations. It became increasingly laborious and time-intensive to maintain competitive pricing as it required manual gathering of pricing data, calculation of optimal price points, and implementation of adjustments. This challenge led us to founding Omnia Retail. Over the years, we saw that as other retail categories matured online, they struggled with the same problem. Similarly, over the last few years, brands have become more serious about their direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels. Brands selling a product against the initial Recommended Selling Price (RSP) for the whole product life cycle leads to insult pricing and the need to change their prices, yet again, to align with the market. As a result, we now see that brands are starting to struggle with the same problem that retailers experienced over a decade ago. Simply being passionate about the challenge and using our prior retail and e-commerce knowledge, we applied our engineering expertise to solve this problem for retailers and brands. It was only later - when our company had grown to a size where everyone couldn’t fit on the same lunch table anymore - that we started reflecting on why we were so invested about solving this challenge. This very reflection led us to establishing Omnia’s purpose explicitly: “We give retailers, brands and their teams superpowers by unleashing the full potential of pricing through market data, insights and automation.” The most central concept here is the word “superpowers”. On a basic level, it refers to automating the tedious and time-intensive tasks that thousands of our users at retailers and brands had to manually do before: looking up prices of competitors, making calculations, and implementing changes. This already removes a lot of tedious work and frees up time to focus on more strategic and creative work. However, that is only one of the basic layers of “superpowers”. Another more exciting element is that we enable our users to do things that were never possible before, even if they would have all the time in the world to spend on pricing. In terms of insights, an example is providing dashboards that provide our users with a “God-view” of the market: fully understanding their own price positioning and understanding what their key competitors (or resellers) are doing. Regarding pricing automation, it’s about having nuanced and advanced strategies, understanding how they are set, impacting results in terms of price positioning and ultimately sales, and contribution margins. Elements of success for dynamic pricing software implementations Through the more than a decade of serving retailers and brands with pricing software, we have seen that certain elements lead to success and ensure the best returns on dynamic pricing implementations: Clearly defined pricing objectives: Begin by setting clear pricing objectives, emphasising the importance of starting with a clear end-goal in mind. Without clearly defined objectives one can have the greatest pricing platform in the world, but there is no guidance on how to use it, and how to measure success. It's essential to recognise that pricing objectives may vary across different parts and levels of the business and are likely to change in response to external factors. Therefore, the pricing platform must accommodate for these varying objectives to remain effective. Securing engagement and support: Securing the engagement and support of team members with direct involvement in pricing is crucial whether it’s as their core responsibility, such as dedicated pricing managers, or as part of their wider role like category managers and buyers. If these individuals struggle to implement the pricing strategies they aim for in the system, or if they cannot explain the prices suggested by the system, they may resist adopting the dynamic pricing software or, at the very least, lack the motivation to leverage the platform's potential fully. Continuous improvement: Rapid cycles of learning and enhancement drive ongoing improvement. This process is supported by ensuring all operations occur in the software's front-end. Any hardcoded rules established by a pricing software vendor in the back-end will hinder such a learning cycle. Moreover, maintaining transparency about the operational logic and performance metrics is essential. From these elements of success we have learned at Omnia, we derived two essential design principles for developing our price management platform: flexibility and transparency. Flexibility to remove barriers to adoption, improving results and ensuring control. Transparency to keep control while on auto-pilot, create buy-in from internal stakeholders and facilitate learning loops. As the ability to run detailed and complex pricing strategies has become mainstream, it has created the next level of challenges: complexity overload. Omnia 2.0 successfully cuts through the clutter with its revolutionary visual pricing logic with the Pricing Strategy Tree™. It gives complete pricing flexibility and control, coupled with transparency. The power of flexibility: Removing barriers to adoption, improving results and ensuring control Flexibility is a core principle in our design philosophy, enabling our clients' users to execute any desired pricing strategy across all parts of their business. We have seen a vast array of pricing strategies being used and broadly speaking, they are driven by differences in objectives at the highest level, the need to differentiate on objectives on lower levels, and differences in definitions. On the highest level, the main differentiation we see is between maximising revenues - with the constraint that a minimum contribution margin needs to be reached - and maximising contribution margin. Traditionally, we saw pure e-commerce players being primarily focused on the former, while more traditional omnichannel retailers were more focused on the latter. With the changing economy and higher interest rates, the importance of being profitable in the present, we now see pure e-commerce players also shifting more towards margin maximisation strategies. While on the highest level, a retailer or brand might have a margin maximisation strategy, virtually, they will always need to differentiate on the lower level as well. Take for example a racket sports retailer. Although overall profit maximisation might be the main objective, the retailer might be focused on penetration (maximisation of sales, given a minimum margin constraint) in a market where they recently launched, as well as that being the main objective to establish itself in a nascent category like padel rackets. Finally, we have learned that retailers and brands have differences of definitions and that their chosen software should support that, rather than enforcing a rigid rule or definition. Take the example of a stock-based strategy, where a company wants to automatically become more aggressive when stock coverage becomes too high or take the opportunity to steer toward margin when stock coverage becomes too low. The definitions of what’s too high and too low differ not only between companies, verticals and markets but also within a company and on different parts of its assortment. It’s crucial for pricing software to be able to provide that flexibility and give the power to the user, not only to ensure that the retailer or brand can reach its objectives but also to ensure that there are no barriers in the adoption of the pricing software. If business users - like category managers - are not able to implement the strategies, they will be inclined to resist the implementation, putting the dynamic pricing implementation project at risk. Pricing software must be able to support flexibility, but it’s even more crucial that everything is fully supported in the front-end of the user-interface (“the portal”). If there are rules or constraints hardcoded within the back-end, a common practice of some pricing software vendors in today's market, it leads to a lack of transparency and limits the pace of learning (testing with strategies). At Omnia, we’re proud to have this flexibility in our software, with not one line of customer-specific code while serving hundreds of retailers and brands since 2012. The examples previously mentioned demonstrate how the principle of flexibility is integrated into the pricing automation part of the Omnia platform. However, our commitment to flexibility extends throughout the entire platform. For instance, we don't confine our customers to predetermined calculation schedules. Instead, they have full autonomy to set the timing for pricing data collection and dynamic pricing calculations. Additionally, they have the capability to initiate calculation runs manually at any moment from the front-end, such as when assessing the impact of strategy modifications. These calculations are efficiently completed within minutes, even for extensive product assortments. Transparency to keep control while on auto-pilot, create buy-in from internal stakeholders and facilitate learning loops Automation has the potential to save time and improve results. However, when implemented poorly, automation may lead to a lack of control. From the early years, this has been our belief, and preventing our dynamic pricing software from becoming a black-box has been a core design principle. Even in our earlier years, the Omnia software had a “Show me why™” button that took the user by the hand in terms of how the software arrived at a particular price advice. Transparency in pricing software ensures control while being on auto-pilot. An element of this transparency is how your strategies will affect the prices for all products such as the number of products that received “price advice”: prices up, down, equal, price difference vs various benchmarks, and so on. One level deeper is the need for dynamic pricing users to understand the impact of every element of their pricing strategy. For example, one could have a very elaborate pricing strategy, but if anywhere in the strategy there would be a pricing rule “always adjust to the lowest price in the market”, there would be a high chance that the rule will set the prices for the majority of your assortment, and most likely down. Understanding how elements of your strategy impact the eventual prices set links to another significant benefit of transparency: improving results by enabling learning loops. When implementing dynamic pricing you can achieve surprisingly strong results by implementing a pricing strategy once, and then never touching the system again. However, we see that customers who use our software more continuously and are evaluating and testing new approaches achieve the best results. This is only achievable with a pricing tool that creates maximum transparency, facilitating those learning loops. The Pricing Strategy Tree™ as embodiment of flexibility and transparency Our previous pricing platform, Omnia 1.0, was very flexible. However, our most advanced enterprise customers using complex pricing strategies could end up with a long list of pricing strategies. Although relatively easy to build up incrementally, this could make it hard to grasp the strategies running and the logic behind them. In numerous instances, consultants specializing in pricing strategy assisted our customers by creating decision trees to map out and advise on their clients' strategies. This inspired us to use a decision tree as the main interface when building pricing strategies. Although we already had the idea of a Pricing Strategy Tree on our roadmap, acquiring German pricing strategy company Patagona GmbH at the end of 2021 gave us an unfair advantage. Patagona had developed a Pricing Decision Tree to build strategies in their Pricemonitor product. We evaluated this concept with our customers and based on their invaluable feedback, we developed the Pricing Strategy Tree as one of the core elements of our next-generation platform, Omnia 2.0. The new platform was launched in the Summer of 2023, with new product features being added monthly. Not only does the Pricing Strategy Tree lead to more transparency in terms of letting our users understand what’s running, we see that in practice it also makes it easier and simpler to create strategies. That is because it’s a visual drag-and-drop interface, but also because we embedded functionality; such as copy-and-pasting of selected branches within the tree (typically set-up for one market or format) and copy-and-pasting of entire trees across countries or formats. The latter is particularly relevant for our global customers to be able to roll out pricing strategies to additional markets with just a few clicks. To drive transparency even further, the Pricing Strategy Tree proved the ideal canvas for additional functionality: path tracking through the strategy tree, strategy branch statistics of the tree, and naming of tree branches. The path tracking is an evolution of the “Show Me Why™” in Omnia 1.0 called “Explain Price Recommendation” in the Omnia 2.0 platform and provides a full explanation of how the price advice of a particular product came about. This is a typical question for a business user as a category manager or buyer. The “Price Explanation” visually tracks the path through the tree to show the logic and how the price advice came about. “Strategy Branch Statistics” covers another use case, one that was never possible in our previous Omna 1.0 platform: It highlights how elements of the overall pricing strategy impact the eventual prices set. It does this by showing how many products are repriced by each branch in the tree, the average price difference and percentage difference of the price advice vs current price points, as well as the number of products priced up and down. One important benefit of this is that it gives our users insight into which branches are most dominant in setting the eventual prices. Remember the example of having an elaborate pricing strategy with a rule somewhere to “always adjust to the lowest price in the market” in the transparency section above. However, the value of Strategy Branch Statistics goes beyond that. It also provides users insights into the performance of a particular strategy branch, thereby facilitating the important learning loops discussed above. Another functionality we have added to the Pricing Strategy Tree™ canvas is the naming of branches of the tree. Although the tree already makes it easy to show the logic applied, the naming of branches makes it even more practical for users and co-workers to understand what happens in a particular branch by describing it in natural language, for example “Follow the lowest price point of key competitors when stock coverage is too high”. The naming of tree branches also lays the foundation for the steps we plan to take providing more insights in the performance or effectiveness of branches. “We have seen several pricing tools, but the pricing strategy tree plus “show me why” is a super unique selling point and best implementation of dynamic pricing we have seen so far.” International enterprise office supplies retailer. AI is a means, not an end: A case for blending rules, AI, and goal-based pricing We believe that AI as a powerful technology can greatly contribute to the “superpowers” in our purpose. Think about automated import mapping, creating reports based on natural language, surfacing conclusions from data and charts, and so forth. We are also convinced that AI will provide more and more value in the future core area of price setting. However, given the importance of transparency and flexibility, we firmly believe that the future of pricing setting won’t be AI only - on 100% of the products in 100% of the cases - but rather a combination of pricing rules and AI. In terms of intelligence in price setting, AI is a means not an end itself. The core need that we see at the retailers and brands across our customer base is more focused on moving away from setting granular business rules - with the aim of reaching specific objectives - to rather focus on setting the objectives themselves at a higher level and letting our Omnia pricing platform optimise for that. As a company focused on and committed to delivering value to our customers, we naturally plan for this need with more and more goal-based “nodes” (blocks) in the Omnia Pricing Strategy Tree™. Goal-based nodes can have a combination of complex AI running under the hood, for other goal-based nodes less complex statistical rules, depending on the need. The first example of such a goal-based node with AI under the hood is our Amazon Buy Box AI block whereby our user sets the Amazon Buy Box win probability certainty and the AI - based on large amounts of historical data - tries to land exactly at the right price point to reach maximum margin while keeping the win probability as a constraint. This is very different from the previous approach in our software and, to our knowledge, the current state of Buy Box optimisers in most channel management software which has usually been going step-by-step down until you win the Buy Box and then up again to increase margin. That approach is simply too slow and there are too many variables with influence that have changed in the meantime. Although we envision that larger and larger parts of the assortment will be priced by such goal-based nodes in the future, we believe they will always be combined with business rules on part of the assortment (again, it will be rules and AI). For example, our users may want to apply hard constraints (such as upper and lower boundaries) which can differ on different parts of the assortment. For promotions, retailers and brands will want to set hard price points during a certain time frame. Those are just some examples of why the goal-based nodes need to be combined with business rules. The crucial thing is that the principles of flexibility and transparency continue to be crucial when combining rules and AI. You need one single interface where rules and AI can be seamlessly combined, applied by business users, and it remains transparent how and why prices were set. Again, the Pricing Strategy Tree is the ideal concept that automatically ensures this. While this may seem to be a trivial design prerequisite, we see that other pricing software vendors that have begun making first steps with AI in their platforms often are violating this principle. There are vendors that offer “AI-only” with no capability to combine it with rules. We have seen vendors with a separate “AI-version” of their product, next to the old rule-based version of their product to let customers choose one of the products. Then, finally, there are vendors that perhaps are actually more of a team of pricing consultants, as they have to hardcode rules in the back-end, as well as requiring a lot of manual intervention from the team of the vendor for the algorithms to at least provide decent results. The latter case also leads to very long implementation times and learning loops that are too slow, as we learned when taking over customers of these vendors. “With that pricing tree, the flexibility is almost endless.” Pricing Team Manager of the largest beauty pure e-commerce player in Europe. Unleashing superpowers with Omnia 2.0 At Omnia, we believe we are still in the early stages of developing the ultimate pricing platform we aim for in the long term. Yet, we're immensely proud of how the Omnia 2.0 platform is already giving our customers superpowers by enhancing their capabilities more and more. We have made huge leaps in terms of dashboarding, and are constantly evolving those dashboards on a weekly basis thanks to the great feedback from our customers, and the way we have decoupled the visualisation layer from the data layer, enabling us to make fast interactions with little development time. We are clearly on the path of having that “God-view” of the market from the introduction above. Perhaps an even bigger leap has been the core topic of this article: the introduction of the Pricing Strategy Tree in Omnia 2.0, which combines ultimate flexibility and transparency, and we believe is the ideal concept to combine business rules with (partially AI-driven) goal-based pricing. We couldn’t be more proud of the feedback we have received from our customers, and the market as a whole, since the launch of Omnia 2.0 in the Summer of 2023. And we are very excited about further growing the superpower of our users by adding more intelligence to the Pricing Strategy Tree and the entire Omnia 2.0 pricing platform.\n\nOmnichannel dynamic pricing: Competition, comparison and consumer behaviour\n\nThink back to the last expensive product you purchased.

Did you just buy the item in...\n\nThink back to the last expensive product you purchased. Maybe it was a wearable like the newest Apple Watch, a pair of running shoes, or a new TV. How did you go about making your purchase? Did you just buy the item in one click? Did you see it in-store and immediately hand over your debit card? Or did you first research online via social media and comparison sites, then experience the physical product in-store, then research prices online to decide where to buy? As consumer behaviour evolves and the younger, more tech-savvy generation gains more experience in maximising their value for money, brands and retailers must evolve to meet these shoppers where they are and win the sale. These changes, amidst a wider shift toward omnichannel selling, call for a more thoughtful approach to the interaction and synchronisation of online and offline pricing. Businesses are spending more time and resources on building omnichannel pricing strategies that can succeed – and be implemented – across all points of sale. In this article, Omnia explores the evolution in consumer behaviour and price comparison and how omnichannel brands and retailers can use dynamic pricing to bridge the gap. How does a consumer make their decision to buy? Today’s consumer is investing more time and effort in the research stage before making a decision about if they should buy, and if so, when they should buy and from whom. 44% of consumers say they are spending more time planning their shopping trips to brick-and-mortar stores, while about half say they’re spending less time just browsing in physical stores. The retail analyst, Natalie Berg explains: \"There's just so many different ways to shop today. And as shoppers, we don't think in channels. We just want to shop and we want a seamless experience across the many touchpoints that exist today. But we're channel agnostic and we're device agnostic. Retailers have had to work really hard behind the scenes to make this a seamless experience.\" Google Trends has found some compelling insights on these omnichannel consumer behaviours since 2023: About one-third of consumers are spending more time on their decision-making, considering more brands, stores and retailers in the process 65% of consumers are more likely to research a product online, even if they plan to buy in the store And vice versa: 59% are more likely to go to stores to physically see or touch a product, even if they intend to buy online The trend is even stronger around the holidays: Consumers used online search before 96% of in-store holiday shopping trip It’s clear that online and offline are colliding, and as the data above shows, the buying journey can take many paths. Some consumers might research online first – watching unboxing videos from their favourite influencers, searching the product on social media or comparison sites – then go in-store to experience the physical product. Even after all that, they might conduct more price research online to decide whether to buy online or in-store, or whether to buy from a different seller altogether. Others might browse in-store first to get a feel for what they like, then research reviews, prices and other factors online before deciding if or where to buy. There are countless paths to purchase, and shopping behaviour is influenced by a number of factors: Price: The higher the investment, the more likely it is that the consumer will invest more effort and take the time to research Complexity: If a product is more complex, it is more challenging to get a full picture. A technical description does not always reflect the experience; for example, do you know offhand how loud 48 dB will sound in a pair of headphones? Experience: The five senses contribute to emotions, which can lead to consumers making a purchase. Experiencing a product and all its sensory information first hand can be a significant factor in the shopping journey. Returns: How easy is it to return a product? For example, consumers might be more likely to research items that are fragile or those cannot be returned due to hygiene reasons, versus something like a sweater that can easily be sent back. Brand: If the experience and association with the brand is exceptional – for example, the in-store service – a number of shopping behaviours could be impacted. The consumer might be more likely to want to shop in person and to go through with the purchase, and they are likely to be willing to pay a bit more. Competing in the price comparison stage Once a decision is made to purchase the product, the modern consumer is savvy enough to compare prices online. This means sellers across channels are competing on price, and if you’re an omnichannel brand or retailer, you’re essentially competing with everyone. In these highly competitive environments, dynamic pricing is an effective strategy to capture more sales and take control of your assortment. Omnichannel brands and retailers benefit from dynamic pricing in a number of ways, including: Competitive pricing advantage: Dynamic pricing adjusts prices in real time based on market conditions, competitor pricing and predetermined pricing rules. This ensures that prices remain attractive to consumers compared to other options in the market, which is particularly important when a shopper starts researching prices online. Maximising revenue: By dynamically adjusting prices at a higher frequency, retailers can set prices that reflect current demand, customer behaviour and other market variables, boosting revenue over time. Inventory management: By adjusting prices based on inventory levels, retailers can promote products that need to be cleared quickly or maximise profits on high-demand items. This is especially helpful when managing stock for both brick-and-mortar stores and online sales. Seasonal and promotional pricing: As mentioned previously, merging online research with brick-and-mortar shopping is even more relevant during holiday events, with consumers using online search before 96% of in-store holiday shopping trips. Dynamic pricing gives omnichannel retailers and brands the flexibility to respond to seasonal trends, demand fluctuations and promotional events. Real-time market changes: External factors, such as changes in the economy, weather conditions or geopolitical events, can impact consumer behaviour and market dynamics; changes that retailers can more quickly adapt to using dynamic pricing. Agility and flexibility: As online and offline become more intertwined, omnichannel sellers need to adapt and respond quickly to new information and competitor pricing updates. Bridging the pricing gap in omnichannel Omnichannel brands without a cohesive dynamic pricing strategy can face unnecessary losses and fractured pricing between channels. The challenge is this: How do you match your offline store to your online store while still competing with your key competitors? Consistency across online and offline channels is crucial. Omnichannel sellers have to find ways to synchronise both pricing strategies in order to provide a seamless experience for consumers and avoid losing sales or loyalty if a consumer or price comparison site spots a discrepancy. This is a common challenge. Many retailers struggle to align pricing: Their online prices change frequently, while their offline products are far more static. It’s easy to change an online price any time, but the retailer doesn’t want to change in-store prices every time if they are simply printed on signs, tags or stickers. There are a few ways to mitigate this challenge with the help of Omnia Retail dynamic pricing software. Electronic shelf labels (ESLs) This is the easiest way to match online and offline pricing. It requires more financial investment and IT infrastructure, but saves on costs by decreasing the labour and time needed to update prices. Image source If the cost of purchasing ESLs is too high, retailers can rent them (which tends to be far cheaper than buying), either for the whole assortment or just high sellers. One thing to consider with ESLs is timing. You don’t want a price to change on an ESL if a customer is standing right next to it. Imagine you’re shopping in a store, and the price on a product suddenly jumps from €100 to €110. The product hasn’t changed in the last five seconds, so it’s unlikely you’ll think it’s fair that the price has suddenly increased by 10%. To mitigate this, retailers might choose specific hours to change prices, either when the store is closed or during slower hours for foot traffic. Other retailers offer a discount if a customer comes to them after having found a cheaper price online compared to in-store. Fixed price adjustment days Another option is to decide on fixed days when you will align online and offline pricing, and adjust your repricing frequency to match. Compared to the ESL option, this is suboptimal, but it will allow you to synchronise prices at a level that does not exceed your shop floor staff capacity. This option will also decrease the chance of consumers walking out after checking online and discovering that either 1) your prices don’t match your own website or 2) your competition sells it for far cheaper. While providing great in-store service and experience adds value that consumers may be willing to pay more for, they are still likely to leave if the price difference is too large. Gaining clarity first on the following questions will help retailers to set this process up: Which key assortments are your revenue/margin drivers? How can you segment the online competition toward this assortment? Is there a pattern of which days the segmented competition is repricing their products? Answering these questions will tell you which assortments to prioritise, as well as which days your segmented competition is adjusting prices so you can do the same. Dynamic pricing made simpler with Omnia As consumers become more research savvy and the lines between online and offline shopping continue to blur, retailers and brands – especially those operating in an omnichannel environment – will need to adjust pricing strategies to win over the competition. If shoppers are researching on multiple channels, then those retailers and brands must be consistent and competitive across all points of sale. Omnia’s dynamic pricing software enables retailers and brands to bridge the pricing gap in omnichannel. Our customers who utilise ESLs use Omnia’s dynamic pricing software in a number of ways to make this strategy more effective: Understanding which products are more competitive in the market and which are not. For brick-and-mortar sales, only the competitive product prices need to be changed more frequently. Setting up the frequency at which Omnia sends data for their brick-and-mortar products, according to their ESL pricing strategies. This can be done in three different formats: CSV, XML and JSON. Omnia's output can be placed automatically to an (s)ftp location from where your ESL system can pick up the latest pricing data. Using Omnia’s filtering capabilities to decide which parts of the assortments you want to include in the reports used to change the products' prices on the ESL. This means that you can make a differentiation between the fixed-price products and the products that you want to change dynamically. Aligning online and offline pricing (where relevant). Omnia data enables customers to remove discrepancies. For example, one Omni customer used to do their offline repricing manually – a tedious and time-consuming process. Now, they use ESL software connected to the Omnia output, making it faster, easier and more accurate.\n\nE-commerce shipping: A guide on costs, speed and environmental impact\n\nThere are pros and cons to every method of shipping, whether international or local, and there’s also no “right” answer.

Every e-commerce business is different, and the right shipping strategy depends on factors like budget, product assortment, who your customers are, where the business is based geographically and more. Rather than giving tips for which shipping methods are best or which ones a business should use, we’re breaking down some of the most common methods in three key areas: cost, speed and environmental impact. Cost: How much does it cost the seller to ship the product to the buyer? Costs to consider include carrier costs like shipping labels, packaging, fulfilment, insurance and overhead. Speed: How much time does the shipping method take? How long between the customer making the order and receiving their package? Environmental impact: What effect does the speed and method of shipping have on the environment, from carbon emissions to water pollution and more? Delivery methods for e-commerce: Cost, speed and environmental impact Same-day delivery Same-day delivery is becoming more popular and is the fastest-growing segment in the last-mile shipping environment, growing at 36% annually. In Europe, same-day delivery accounts for about 5% of total deliveries. E-commerce giants with large-scale supply chains tend to cover this especially well; Amazon already delivers to nearly three in four customers within 24 hours. The same-day delivery market is forecasted to reach $26.4 billion (USD) by 2027. The term “same-day delivery” can mean different things depending on the seller; in some cases, orders placed by a certain time will arrive by the end of the same calendar day, while others may just mean delivery within 24 hours. Typically, for same-day delivery to work, sellers need to have distance limits or cut-off times for when the order must be placed by to qualify. It’s also worth noting that same-day delivery is not always possible; it’s more likely to see it as an option in large cities or in more populated areas of Europe, for example, compared to the US, Canada or rural regions in other countries. The cost of same-day delivery, both monetarily and to the environment, depends on the carrier and the region. With traditional carriers such as FedEx, UPS or DHL, same-day delivery can be quite expensive and have a higher environmental cost. As Earth.org points out, “when dealing with a one- or two-day shipping window, [carriers] are often forced to send out trucks that are filled at half their capacity, generating more traffic and thus emissions.” However, especially in larger cities across the globe, there are many carbon-neutral alternatives available. For example, there are newer carriers like Budbee from Stockholm whose offer from the start was same-day delivery, with electric vans that are cheaper and carbon-neutral. There are also bike couriers in some markets, like Stuart in London or Cycloon in the Netherlands, that offer same-day delivery directly from stores. In these cases, same-day delivery is fast, carbon-neutral and not necessarily more expensive than slower shipping options. Overnight, two-day and expedited shipping The environmental impact of overnight and other speedy shipping methods like two-day and expedited is highly dependent on the area. Within regions like France and Germany, for example, overnight or two-day shipping may be the cheapest option at many carriers, and the environmental impact is mostly based on context, such as the type of parcel, location and other factors. However, overnight or expedited shipping in regions like North America, Australia and APAC can be expensive, especially when transported by air versus sea or ground shipping. A study performed in China on the carbon footprint of shipping options found that emissions from air shipping were 65 times higher than sea shipping. (Note that sea shipping is simply not an option in certain regions like North America and Australia.) Higher speed can also mean higher costs, in some cases. Air cargo typically costs more because of the need for faster delivery times and high fuel costs. Ocean freight, however, uses larger vessels that can transport more goods for longer distances, which is why it tends to be 12 to 16 times cheaper than air freight. In general, retailers who want to use overnight and speedy shipping options without high cost or environmental impact certainly can do so, as long as they find the right carriers to partner with and take into consideration 1) the region they are operating from and 2) the regions of their shoppers. Two- to three-day shipping Two- or three-day shipping, sometimes called priority shipping, is one of the more common types in e-commerce. It is slower than overnight, same-day and expedited options, but can still get items to customers faster than standard economy shipping in some markets. In European countries, the cultural differences between countries and delivery networks create discrepancies in what is considered “priority shipping”. For example, in urban areas like Stockholm or Oslo, it’s considered normal to offer overnight delivery, while in other parts of Sweden and Norway, shipping times are far longer due to the large distances – hence the offering of priority shipping options in these specific regions. In general, consumers are more likely to complete a purchase when it’s delivered faster than usual: In North America, up to 85% of shoppers are more likely to buy when two-day delivery is offered. The cost of two-day shipping is highly dependent on how far the item is being transported. For shorter distances, ground shipping can be used; this is why sellers with fulfilment centres or warehouses in different regions are more likely to be able to use this option. For longer distances, air cargo is used to guarantee the two-day turnaround; however, this has a higher cost and a larger environmental impact. In some cases, “fast delivery” – which encompasses all shipping options where orders are delivered within one to three days – will require some air transportation, meaning sellers can’t take advantage of full truck load capacities. This results in the need to dispatch more frequently and increases the total cost of transportation and environmental impact. A simulation model run by a team of MIT researchers in Mexico, for example, showed that “fast shipping produces significantly higher CO2 emissions since it imposes a challenge for cargo consolidation.” Their findings indicated that fast shipping increases both total CO2 emissions and costs by up to 15% and 68%, respectively. In Europe and other large metropolitan areas around the world, fast delivery does not necessarily cost more or require air transportation, decreasing the environmental cost. Standard shipping This may be called economy, regular, basic or ground shipping depending on the country or region, but it’s simply the cheapest shipping option available from the courier. Items sent by standard shipping typically use ground transportation and take longer to arrive. Here are some examples of how long standard shipping takes for domestic orders in Europe, the US and UK: Netherlands: 1-2 working days Germany: 1-2 working days France: 1-2 working days UK: 2-5 working days United States: 3-5 working days Costs to use standard shipping vary by country and courier. As for the environment, the typical saying is that “slower is greener.” According to research by Josue Velazquez, a research Scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics, e-commerce customers who wait up to five days for home delivery “could help decrease carbon dioxide emissions by about 30% in the last mile of a delivery.” However, as with other types of shipping, this is all dependent on location. International shipping Shipping packages internationally can vary widely in terms of cost. While domestic shipping often has a flat fee, shipping to other countries may lead to additional costs in areas like customs and customs brokerage, as well as ground, maritime or air transportation. Speed also varies with international delivery. Shipping from the US to Europe, for example, can take anywhere from 10-16 business days with economy delivery services, or as few as one to three business days with an expedited courier. All European countries have their local domestic “postal” networks that are now used for delivering parcels. These networks stop at the country borders and therefore companies need international line haul transportation networks to \"inject\" parcels into the local networks of their neighbouring countries. This may lead to one or two additional delivery days. On the environmental side, international shipping of any speed can have a high environmental impact, as it typically requires multiple legs of transport and at least some involvement of air or ocean cargo. Eco-friendly shipping “Eco-friendly” is not a clearly definable term, and it means different things depending on the e-commerce seller. Generally eco-friendly shipping can involve any of the following: Recyclable or compostable packaging Carbon offset options Smaller packaging size Ground-based shipping versus air or sea Slower shipping An e-commerce sustainability survey by Sifted found that consumers are interested in these options. 91% wanted an eco-friendly shipping option when they checkout, and 57% are willing to pay an additional 10% for eco-friendly packaging and shipping. While the cost of using eco-friendly packaging can be higher, using less harmful shipping methods like ground and standard shipping can actually be cheaper for the seller and the shopper. Alternative delivery (parcel lockers, click and collect) Many e-commerce sellers are choosing to offer additional delivery options. A global survey of supply chain executives found that 44% offer click-and-collect (including products that are not shipped and sold directly from stores) and 11% offer collection points. These options can decrease costs for shippers if they are able to group packages, and may increase the speed of delivery in some cases. Whether delivering to a parcel locker or collection point makes a significant difference to the environment depends on what one considers “significant”. During the last-mile delivery stages, the previously mentioned study in China found that total emissions produced for home delivery were 0.012 kg CO2e higher than delivery to a collection point. Source: AZO Cleantech 2021. Which shipping method is best? It’s up to the consumer During a talk at Omnia’s annual Price Points Live event in 2022, Dr Heleen Buldeo Rai, a researcher at the Université Gustave Eiffel in Paris, spoke about how it’s really up to the consumer to choose delivery options, not the retailer. With the industry standard set at free delivery, most consumers are no longer willing to pay for shipping; they are, however, willing to wait longer or to “click and collect” their purchase. A study she conducted with colleagues in Belgium – with similar results seen in Netherlands, Bolivia, China and Brazil – found that while 81% of consumers would say yes to free next-day delivery, that number only dropped by three percentage points when offering free delivery within three to five days. When a slower shipping method is used, there is a positive impact on the company’s costs as well as the environment. This study could indicate that consumers are willing to make this trade-off, if retailers use the information to properly motivate them toward eco-friendly delivery options. Customer demands may outweigh shipping costs in the end Since 2010, global e-commerce sales have increased by nearly 800%. That’s great news for all the e-commerce sellers out there and for the customers who want to shop online, but there is a fragile balance to maintain. We all saw the strain put on supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic: An EY of survey supply chain executives across industries found that only 2% of respondents said they were “fully prepared” for the pandemic. 57% said they were affected by serious disruptions, with 72% reporting it had a negative effect on them. While that situation is not a daily occurrence, the growth of fast shipping, combined with the steady uptick in e-commerce sales each year, is putting its own stressors on the logistical capabilities of our global shipping network. In order to keep the global supply chain from collapsing as e-commerce volumes increase, and to boost environmental protections, it may become more necessary over time for customers to make trade-offs and accept slower shipping times. As data from Sifted showed us earlier, nine-in-ten consumers wanted an eco-friendly shipping option when they checkout, and eigh- in-ten would wait at least one extra day for their delivery if that meant it was shipped more sustainably. Increasing the amount of orders that are shipped slower would have significant positive impacts on the environment, while also saving e-commerce businesses on their delivery costs – but not every consumer will be willing to accept slower shipping. It’s a tricky balance, indeed. Retailers and brands who sell online must balance this need for sustainability with a positive customer experience and reliable and flexible delivery, all of which adds up to customer loyalty over time.\n\nComparison shopping engines: How to optimise your presence\n\nWe live in a world of endless choice, and while the number of options can be exciting for shoppers, it can also be overwhelming. Comparison shopping engines (CSEs) have emerged as a valuable tool for shoppers to make...\n\nWe live in a world of endless choice, and while the number of options can be exciting for shoppers, it can also be overwhelming. Comparison shopping engines (CSEs) have emerged as a valuable tool for shoppers to make informed purchase decisions and for e-commerce brands and retailers to increase online visibility and sales. But CSEs are not all the same; some, like Google Shopping, are huge generalist sites covering any product you can think of, while others are vertical shopping sites focused on specific categories. The most popular sites also vary by country, and each population uses them differently. In this post, Omnia discusses what consumers use comparison shopping engines for, the top sites by country, some benefits and challenges of selling on CSEs, and what we expect to see in the future. Consumers use comparison shopping engines to reduce choice overwhelm and find the best price As our global economy continues to accelerate, consumers are faced with an increasing number of choices and opportunities. This means that many consumers are overwhelmed by too many offers that they have difficulty evaluating. This is how CSEs first appeared in the 1990s: influential digital institutions wanted to create a solution that would keep internet users in contact with available products, assisting the shopper in making a purchase while reducing confusion and overwhelm. Comparison shopping engines have now become a significant piece of the tool belt for e-commerce businesses looking to increase their online visibility and boost sales by going head-to-head against the competition. CSEs allow customers to quickly view different products from multiple vendors, compare features and prices, and make informed decisions about what to buy. CSEs are often some of the highest ranking websites in their respective regions, and for brands and retailers selling on CSEs, the sites can increase visibility among shoppers who may not have otherwise found the business or products through other marketing methods. With Google, for example, Google Shopping results and ads appear either above the search results or on the right side of the page, guaranteeing users will see the products first. What consumers want out of a CSE One study cited in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications asked respondents to define which characteristics of a CSE would determine its quality: 81% wanted the CSE to find a lower price offer 80.2% wanted the CSE to be easy to use 76.8% wanted the CSE to be accurate in finding the right offer 70.2% wanted to have access to additional information about the offer and/or supplier 58.7% wanted the CSE to also have ratings, comments, and evaluations from other buyers That first statistic is consistent with other studies and the conventional wisdom that CSEs are used first and foremost to find the best price, which makes sense considering that they are also referred to as “price comparison websites” CSEs are used across the world, but the most popular sites and categories vary No matter the country, there are shoppers looking for the best deal, so CSEs have a worldwide presence. Some of the most popular CSEs in European markets include: How CSEs are used varies by location, age group, income level, and other factors. In a study in the UK, for example, shoppers in the 35-44 age range were the most likely group to have used a price comparison website, with 75% saying they had shopped on a CSE before. Source: Statista CSE comparison: Google Shopping and Amazon Google’s CSE arm is Google Shopping, and it’s one of the biggest comparison sites worldwide. Users shop across the platform more than 1 billion times per day, with 36% of all product searches originating on the site. Meanwhile, 49% of all product searches originate on Amazon, which has more than 1.7 million sellers for shoppers to compare. There is a key difference between the two, however, since Amazon is a marketplace. While marketplaces may include some comparison features, such as filters and sorting options, they are not primarily designed to be comparison engines. Amazon has a vested interest in getting customers to the checkout button or, even better, buying their own branded products on the site. Google sees its role differently: In 2021, Google Commerce President Bill Ready said the following on a podcast: “We’re not a retailer, we’re not a marketplace… What we do want to do is make sure that on a Google surface, the user can discover the best products, the best values, the best sellers, and then seamlessly connect to those sellers. Most of the time, that actually means clicking out to that seller’s own website; it is not our goal to necessarily keep the user on our platform.” This is interesting to note for brands and retailers selling on either site, and other CSEs in general, as it indicates the key differences between the goals of the platforms themselves. While any CSE will still monetise the process through ads, transaction fees, or other channels, some such as Google may not take on as much of the responsibility of getting the shopper all the way to the purchase point. Because of this, Google Shopping may be a unique case that does not fit perfectly into either the marketplace or CSE bucket. Benefits and challenges of selling on CSEs While each comparison shopping engine comes with its own pros and cons for brands and retailers, some of the key benefits and challenges to consider are consistent across platforms: Benefits: Expanded visibility: Listing products on CSEs enables retailers and brands to increase their visibility to potential customers who are actively searching for products. Improved conversion rates: CSEs often attract customers who are further along in the purchase process, meaning that they are more likely to convert into buyers. Increased sales: As a result of the increased visibility and improved conversion rates, retailers and brands may see an increase in sales. Cost-effective advertising: Unlike other forms of advertising, CSEs often operate on a cost-per-click (CPC) model, which means that retailers and brands only pay when someone clicks on their listing. Challenges: Increased competition: CSEs are highly competitive marketplaces, with many retailers and brands vying for the attention of shoppers. If some competitors with the same product offer are out of stock, have fewer or worse reviews, or have different delivery options, then the ones leading in these areas can win the best position on the CSE. Those products will be more likely to be chosen by consumers who care about the quality and trustworthiness of the offer. Cost: While CSEs can be cost-effective, the CPC model can quickly add up, especially for smaller retailers and brands with limited marketing budgets. Product data management: Retailers and brands must provide accurate and up-to-date product data to CSEs, including pricing, availability, delivery options and product descriptions. This can be time-consuming and requires ongoing maintenance. Limited control: CSEs can have their own guidelines around product data, and retailers and brands may have limited control over how their products are presented on the platform. One interesting factor that can be both a benefit and a challenge is consumer trust, as it is dependent on the reputation of the specific CSE in general or in a particular market. In the UK, for example, a government study found that while most consumers trusted CSEs at least a fair amount across most measures, trust levels were much lower in two key areas: Half of consumers did not trust CSEs to ensure data is not shared with third parties without permission Four in ten did not trust CSEs to treat all suppliers equally On the other hand, some comparison sites have built up a high level of trust in their markets. Check24, for example, has been operating since 1999 and is highly trusted in Germany. Price is not the only competition factor on CSEs While price is the determining factor of a product’s visibility on a comparison search engine, vendors will not only compete on who has the cheapest price. As we explored earlier, there are other factors that influence the quality and trustworthiness of an offer for consumers. When developing pricing for CSEs, sellers should consider the following factors in their strategies: 1) Filters Sellers should filter who they would like to compare product offers with and who they will adjust prices in relation to. Not every competitor will be as important to each seller; for example, even if a seller has a very competitive price, if they are a small retailer or a newcomer with an unknown name and no reviews, they won’t appear to be as trustworthy to a consumer compared to a well-known retailer the consumer trusts for fast and secure delivery. The seller may want to skip adjusting prices to these companies. 2) Market knowledge It’s important for sellers to know their market and differentiate pricing strategies between assortments and categories. For example, if you sell sporting t-shirts and sporting shoes, each market and product may have a different set of competitors, so a market analysis will be a crucial starting point. 3) Timing of price adjustments If you adjust your prices in the morning at 8am and your competitor(s) adjust theirs at 9am, then your offer will already be outdated after an hour. You can learn this through market observation, which is made simpler with Omnia’s data. 4) Price elasticity Price elasticity tends to be quite high on CSEs, so be aware and, if possible, analyse data for the platform to build the right pricing strategy for your products. Omnia has a feature in place to calculate price elasticity, as well as a process for elasticity accuracy in our software. 5) Seasonality Any seasonal factors that impact your product assortment should be taken into account when setting a pricing strategy. Special sales events like Black Friday will start with a pricing strategy weeks before, while also seeing increased competition. The same goes for Christmas shopping, when sellers need to keep delivery dates in mind for shoppers who want their products by Christmas eve, and how prices might change along with this. Seasonality shapes consumer behaviour and shopping needs throughout the year, so it is a good idea to have important dates and periods prepared for the whole assortment. 6) Channel alignment Aligning the offers you provide on the CSE with all other sales channels will be important for consistency. Considering the specific conditions of each marketplace and CSE in price calculations will lead to different prices. However, having automation and an overall pricing strategy, with rules such as rounding to a particular digit, will help properly represent the vendor in the market and easily master all different channels. The future of comparison shopping: Where do CSEs go next? With the world of e-commerce changing so rapidly, what can we expect of comparison shopping in the future? Increased use of AI and Machine Learning: Comparison shopping engines will increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning to provide more personalised and targeted search results to shoppers. This will result in more accurate product recommendations and better user experiences. Deeper integration with social media: Comparison shopping engines may integrate more deeply with social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to allow shoppers to make purchases directly from these platforms. This could result in an increase in impulse purchases and a greater focus on social media marketing for retailers. More focus on the changing customer experience: CSEs will need to continually adapt to provide a seamless, up-to-date customer experience. This could include developing mobile-specific features and interfaces, such as voice-activated search and augmented reality shopping, as well as loyalty programs or new payment models. Shifting competition: CSEs will face new types of competition as brands and retailers rethink their own selling models. Will more brands choose to sell D2C? Will retailers use their own experience selling branded products on marketplaces to produce their own labels? As costs rise amid inflation and other world events, retailers and brands will look for alternatives to increase profits, which may create competition for marketplaces from new angles. Greater emphasis on sustainability: As consumers become more environmentally conscious, comparison shopping engines may need to emphasise sustainability in their search results. This could include highlighting products with eco-friendly certifications or partnering with brands that prioritise sustainability. Growing regulatory attention: Comparison shopping engines may face increased scrutiny from governments, particularly in the areas of data privacy and antitrust. This could result in greater transparency requirements for the engines and stricter rules around data collection and use.\n\nD2C in 2023: What we predict and recommend for brands\n\nIn 2019, as a retailer, a D2C brand, or a pricing expert; if you heard the statistic that, in 2022, 64% of consumers will make regular purchases directly from brands, you’d likely wonder what could possibly take place...\n\nIn 2019, as a retailer, a D2C brand, or a pricing expert; if you heard the statistic that, in 2022, 64% of consumers will make regular purchases directly from brands, you’d likely wonder what could possibly take place in between those years for D2C shopping to become the majority choice for consumers. Direct-to-consumer, commonly called D2C, has jumped leaps and bounds in the last few years thanks to the traditional relationship between brand and retailer experiencing a reckoning with covid-19 lockdowns and closures that spanned two years. In essence, the new face of D2C e-commerce was born out of a need for survival amongst brands, from tech to fashion, who were staring down the barrel in 2020 with closed retailers, supply chain issues and sitting stock. On the other end, stay-at-home consumers were searching for a way to receive goods directly to their homes. Today, D2C sales, including established brands and digital natives, are estimated to reach $182.6 billion in 2023 and, overall, D2C sales have increased by more than 36% from 2020 - 2022 in the US. Despite these successes, D2C - both online and offline - has also suffered from the global inflation crisis of 2022 that left brands contending with 10.1% inflation in the UK, 6.1% in France and a 31.7% increase in energy prices across the EU. Facing increased competition, residual inflation, and a crackdown on sustainability practices, how does D2C fare for 2023? As we explore this growing sector of global e-commerce, Omnia looks to paint a portrait of its current state, as well as our predictions and expectations for the year ahead. Established brands will dominate revenue in 2023, showing the major shift big brands have made to D2C Despite showing impressive growth over the last few years, revenue for digitally-native vertical brands (DNVBs) will take a backseat to the more established brands that have made the move to D2C in recent years. In 2023, digitally-native brands are expected to earn $44.6 billion in revenue while established brands will earn much larger revenues, taking home $138 billion. In 2024, these numbers are expected to rise to $51 billion and $161 billion respectively. However, that doesn’t mean any less focus should be placed on the digital side of a brand’s sales stream. Although it is notable to see how well digitally-native brands are doing in the retail landscape, it is more noteworthy to see just how many established brands have made the move to D2C while some have circumvented the retailer route altogether at inception. Tech and home appliance brands like JBL, Phillips, Dyson, Bosch, and Miele, and sports brands like Nike, The North Face, Patagonia, New Balance and Under Armour have gone D2C - and these are just a handful of international brands that are making the move. In Europe alone, D2C e-commerce has grown by 23% between 2021-2022, with Germany leading the way as it remains Europe’s most sophisticated nation regarding logistics, infrastructure and a supply chain network. In addition, 57% of multinational companies worldwide gave “significant financial investment” in their D2C strategy, while another 31% added “moderate investment”. In the US, the amount of D2C brand consumers are set to increase to 111 million shoppers in 2023, making up 40% of their population. Globally, D2C-specific shoppers are at 64%, up 15% from 2019. Source: Insider Intelligence - D2C Brands 2022 Why more consumers are choosing D2C over retailers When we see brands experiencing double-digit growth in their D2C channels, we know it’s because consumers have been making a conscious and active decision to go to the brand they love and trust directly. According to Statista, the leading reason consumers choose to shop directly from a brand, at 49%, is better pricing. In second place is free delivery at 47% and free returns at 35% in third place. Free delivery and returns were made industry-standard by Amazon before the covid-19 pandemic arrived, and have become the expectation of most consumers who specifically choose online shopping over a retailer for the reason of convenience and speed. Source: Statista 2023 However, despite what many consumers think that they are getting a cheaper price directly from a brand, this is often not the case, which is why brands need a thorough dynamic pricing tool to offer a better price - not always the cheaper one - for the brand’s consistent growth. As Omnia`s pricing data show, the necessity for a dynamic pricing solution is twofold: Brands have to contend with their entire retailer network. On average, a brand’s product will be sold by more than 1,000 shops on multiple marketplaces and comparison shopping engines in a national market, which the D2C channel must compete with. Secondly, prices are volatile; meaning that on average the lowest market price for a third of all products for any assortment will either increase or decrease on a daily basis. A dynamic pricing tool gives a brand the ability to react to market changes and consumer demands. The need for market insight is, therefore, vital for a brand. D2C in 2023: In the face of increased competition, new brands will need to find a way to stand out Gymshark, a UK-based sports apparel brand founded at first, in 2012, to digital customers only, has been labelled as a “challenger brand” for one simple reason: It’s found success in creating products around neglected areas within sportswear; one of them being the interests of the everyday gym-goer, instead of the successes of famous athletes. Nike, Adidas and Reebok, who have largely encompassed their ethos, identity and marketing around the famous athlete, from Rafael Nadal to Shaquille O’Neal to Cristiano Ronaldo, have peddled the dream of sporting victories to billions of consumers who - for the most part - can’t or won’t achieve that level of sporting success; although it is nice to fantasise. Instead, Gymshark looked to focus their communication and overall identity on the wants and needs of the daily sport-lover and gym-goer who has a 9-to-5, or a family at home. In addition, the brand has focused on creating gym wear that isn’t only for model-like physiques or for fully able-bodied consumers. The online store shows people one would actually be sharing the leg press machine - not Tiger Woods. Now valued at €1.39 billion only a decade after its inception, the lesson that Gymshark can offer longstanding brands with a D2C channel is to not tell consumers to challenge the status quo with sharp taglines (“impossible is nothing”; “just do it”) but to actually do it themselves. By 2025, the sportswear market across the globe will be valued at €395 billion, with a growth rate of 8-10 percent, showing just how much potential there is within the market to rise above the fray. “Activewear start-ups have found success by creating hyper-specialised products and marketing to local communities first,” reports Business of Fashion. Not dissimilar to Gymshark, Off-White, the brand created by Virgil Abloh, learnt to fill an almost non-existent high-fashion-meets-streetwear gap. The creative director sadly passed away in 2021, however, his vision for meeting a misunderstood or neglected part of the streetwear market caught the attention of Louis Vuitton which led to his appointment as the luxury brand’s menswear artistic director in 2018. Off-White is still in production today. “In a large part, streetwear is seen as cheap. What my goal has been is to add an intellectual layer to it and make it credible,” said Virgil. Strategic partnerships are also part of Off-White’s game plan to succeed in this niche, collaborating with both ends of the spectrum - from Jimmy Choo to Levi’s to Sunglass Hut to Nike. Whether a brand is within the activewear or luxury category or not, we see opportunities for D2C players to focus on a niche in their segment or, like Gymshark and Off-White, look at the needs of consumers buying from those categories to see where they aren’t being met. How D2C brands can prioritise long-term success and growth in 2023 Rely less on digital marketing spending for growth In the early years of Facebook and Instagram, it was easy for brands to rely on sizeable marketing budgets to push growth. As consumers consumed content that was both organic and paid for, brands could rely on these platforms for sales and awareness. In addition, digital marketing on these channels used to be more affordable than it is today: On average, the cost per impression (reaching one person equals one impression) on Facebook cost $14.9 in 2021 versus $7.8 in 2019. The cost to advertise also gets more expensive if there are more ads within a segment, making the increasing competition among D2C brands in food, clothing, or tech even more costly. The smarter alternative to funnelling funds into digital marketing is to have an all-rounded approach that involves social media with user-generated content, tips and “how-to” video content; strategic partnerships with brand ambassadors; personalised email marketing and subscriptions; as well as omnichannel in-store experiences. How D2C brands spend money to acquire customers matters over the long term with strategic, disciplined spending being better over the long term. Focus on quality customer data British mathematician Clive Humby said in 2006 that “Data is the new oil”, which is a statement that has proven to be true over the last few years. Research firm Magna Global found in a study they conducted that 83% of consumers are willing to share data - such as retail preferences, location, age, and marital status - to access discounted or personalised services. In addition, McKinsey reports that 80% of consumers want personalisation from retailers, which is a lesson the D2C sector could learn using customer data. Using quality customer data, D2C brands can build stronger relationships with customers, based on their personal preferences, when it comes to new product launches, sales, returns and delivery, and more. D2C can also optimise pricing and product assortment, as well as help brands understand the customer journey online. Hire the right talent Finding and retaining quality talent will be key to achieving long-term D2C success. From branding to e-commerce to digital to customer experience (CX/UX), having professionals and experts in these arenas is a non-negotiable point. Firstly, companies can look to see who, in the team, has the knowledge, credentials and skills to push forward the D2C agenda while offering them leadership positions or promotions. Another way to secure strong talent is to acquire professionals from existing scale-ups that have shown to be strong competitors in the market. First-party data and underserved niche markets will be D2C’s best friends in 2023 Over the last three years since D2C experienced its most growth, we’ve been pleasantly surprised at the sector’s resilience, considering it is up against e-retailer and marketplace behemoths like Amazon, eBay, Bol.com, Walmart, and Target, as well as social commerce marketplaces under the Meta title. Both brands and consumers have shown an almost stubborn competitiveness in forging their own way within retail and e-commerce. However, 2023 will not come without its challenges for D2C brands: Gaining and implementing strategies with first-party customer data will become more vital for growth while Apple and government regulators work to make third-party data a thing of the past. In addition, as the competition increases within D2C, brands will have to find ways to rise above the fray to stand out. In categories like skincare, beauty, or sports apparel where mostly established brands own the customer, new and emerging D2C brands should grab underserved niche markets by the horns.\n\nBlack Friday 2022: Our predictions and recommendations\n\nEach year, avid shoppers look forward to the annual Black Friday shopping event, which kicks off the holiday gifting season, where brands and retailers reduce prices on items from electronics to jewellery to levels that...\n\nEach year, avid shoppers look forward to the annual Black Friday shopping event, which kicks off the holiday gifting season, where brands and retailers reduce prices on items from electronics to jewellery to levels that inspire crowds in their thousands. Around the world, shoppers who may not be able to afford certain products, or feel that they are getting a better deal than the usual price, can now make a purchase, or a consideration at least. Consumers who find shopping for items like dishwashing liquid a tedious task may buy in bulk on Black Friday to avoid it being on the shopping list in future, which is also known as pantry loading. Whichever category consumers fall into, Black Friday attracts people from almost every socio-economic background, making it retail’s favourite day of the year. As we await Black Friday in 2022, which officially falls on 25 November, it takes little effort to see that this year’s event may be quite different to that of previous years, considering record-high inflation has hit Europe in the jugular since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Despite mixed reports on how this year’s Black Friday will go, Sander Roose, CEO and founder of Omnia, predicts there will still be many retailers and brands who are aggressive in their discounting strategy for the fact that they are holding excessive stock and, quite possibly, because they feel inclined to discount heavily as they know they are dealing with inflation-stricken consumers. However, some studies are showing consumers to be spending more now than before the arrival of Covid-19 as people grapple with surviving a life-and-death reality.
