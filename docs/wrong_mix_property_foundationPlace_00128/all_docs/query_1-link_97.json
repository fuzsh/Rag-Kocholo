        "text": "They have already persuaded the glamorous Charlie's Angels to use them.\n\nNow Nokia bosses are cashing in on its cunning product-placement in the new Hollywood blockbuster with a TV campaign starring Charlie's Angels stars Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore.\n\nThe mobile phone company is working hand-in-hand with the makers of the new Charlie's Angels film in a multi-million pound marketing major marketing push timed to coincide with the film's UK cinema release later this month.\n\nThe TV, press and on-line campaign will try and persuade fashion-conscious consumers that the new 8210 model is the latest must-have accessory.\n\n\"This film is very relevant for the UK market because Charlie's Angels was one of the main hit series of the seventies. It's a bit of fun really but the film is just right for Nokia because there's a strong style element and they've introduced a lot of technology and made it very contemporary,\" said head of marketing Alison Brolls.\n\nA TV, press and web advertising campaign for the Nokia 8210 launches on November 24 and will feature clips from the film of the Angels using the phone. Nokia is also organising in-store promotional tie-ins, taking in Carphone Warehouse and Nokia stores, and bringing out a limited edition mobile phone carrying Charlie's Angels branding.\n\nThe deal with Columbia Pictures, the maker of the new film, is the latest in a series of Nokia product placements. Nokia made its screen debut in the 1987 blockbuster Wall Street and the company also provided the futuristic Nokia handset used by Keanu Reeves in The Matrix."
