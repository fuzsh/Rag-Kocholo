        "text": "Princess Nokia is making her feature film debut with Angelfish. The movie, written and directed by Peter Lee, tells the story of a young couple who falls in love in the Bronx in the summer of 1993. Check out the trailer and poster below.\n\nAngelfish, which also stars Jimi Stanton, premieres on Thursday, November 14 at United Palace in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. It’s then released digitally on November 19.\n\n“I loved sharing this experience with Peter Lee and the incredible team of women who made this film possible,” Princess Nokia said in a statement. “I’m really grateful to have someone believe in me so much, and believe in this talent—not just my name or the idea of me. He respected me, he respected New York and the importance of bringing these Latino characters alive respectively and accurately. Which has truly meant the world to me.”"
