        "text": "From reality TV to music stardom!\n\nShe may be best known for her starring role on reality TV shows Love & Hip-Hop: Atlanta and K Michelle: My Life, but there's no doubt that K is the real deal. Years before her television success, she signed to Jive Records and released the Missy Elliott co-written single 'Fakin It'.\n\nIn 2014, she reached a whole different level of fame when she was chosen to join Robin Thicke (whose track Blurred Lines was dominating the airwaves) on tour. She released her latest album More Issues Than Vogue earlier this year. Featuring the singles 'Not A little Bit' and 'I Ain't You', it was a collection of sophisticated and nuanced R&B."
