        "text": "Advertisements\n\nThe upoming Scifi Thriller, “Source Code” – starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan – seems like a really good movie. It’s like a cross between Tron (being inside a computer programme), GroundHogDay (Repeating events) and maybe Surrogates (going into other folk’s bodies). It looks like something I’d be very interested in watching.\n\nWhat makes it even better is the appearance of a Nokia device. Did you catch where abouts in the trailer?\n\nThis one is not new but it’s now a classic. It’s the N97 mini. I’ve seen a few floating around Uni – makes me smile :).\n\nIt looks like Ballmer and Elop can’t wait to show off Nokia’s with MS products. This N97 mini is looking up something through BING. I think it’s interesting that they’ve got Bing Desktop )or some approximation of it) on the N97 Mini. It seems Shawn /Coler/Gyllenhaal know their way around getting out of the default mobile browser versions (btw, Bing is a few steps too many switching out of mobile view).\n\nHow long until we see Nokia’s Windows Phone dÃ©but on the big screen (e.g. 5800)?\n\nAdvertisements\n\nRelated"
