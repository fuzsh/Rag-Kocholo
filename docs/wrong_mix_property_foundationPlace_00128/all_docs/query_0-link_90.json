        "text": "With back-to-school just around the corner, we knew we could expect a killer collab from Urban Outfitters coming our way, to which they did not disappoint in the slightest. The millennial favorite retailer checked all the boxes by teaming up with classic loungewear brand, Champion, to create the comfiest, not to mention chicest, BTS capsule collection ever. But the goodness doesn't stop there. The brand also tapped five up-and-comers — starring rapper Princess Nokia — to be a part of the campaign in which they were asked to answer the question, \"What Do You Champion?\" From this, the multi-hyphenates were challenged to discuss what being a champion means to them, as well as the causes they hold near and dear to their hearts. The end goal? To inspire students to consider what they champion in their day-to-day lives and how they can use that to ignite positive change.\n\nAmazing message and clothes? It's just their style. Starting today (August 14), shoppers can snag everything from genderless hoodies and crewneck sweatshirts, to joggers that come in what can only be described as happy hues of turquoise, pink, and even peach. What's more? They also created shorts, jerseys, and hoodies that boast the iconic “C” logo. And they happen to be fairly wallet-friendly, too, with prices ranging from just $45-$75."
