        "text": "TORONTO, CANADA – December 20, 2023 - Lumine Group Inc. (“Lumine Group” or “the Company”) (TSXV: LMN), a global buy-and-hold forever acquirer of communications and media software businesses, today announced that, through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Device Management and Service Management Platform businesses from Nokia (NYSE: NOK). This will mark Lumine Group’s second carve-out transaction with Nokia.\n\nDevice Management and Service Management Platform are primarily the result of two previous acquisitions by Nokia, namely Motive and mFormation. Following the acquisition, Lumine Group will restore the Motive brand as the new corporate entity for the Device Management and Service Management Platform solutions as a stand-alone business unit within Lumine Group.\n\nDavid Sharpley, Group President at Lumine Group, commented: “We are absolutely thrilled to welcome Device Management and Service Management Platform customers and employees to Lumine. As experienced corporate carve-out acquirers, our priority is to partner with Nokia to ensure a seamless transition and operational continuity for all customers.”\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Lumine Group will acquire Nokia’s Device Management and Service Management Platform businesses for a total purchase price of up to €185 million euros, which includes a contingent consideration of up to €35 million euros based on the performance of the business during the first year following close. This transaction is expected to close in Q1 2024 and is subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements herein may be “forward looking” statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual events to be materially different from any future events expressed or implied by such forward looking statements.
