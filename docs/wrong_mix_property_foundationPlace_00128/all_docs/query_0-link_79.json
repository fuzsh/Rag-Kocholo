        "text": "After starring in a multitude of leaks, Nokia's Lumia 928 has finally been revealed by the Finnish handset manufacturer. Nokia now has a page on its website dedicated to the Verizon-bound Lumia 928 that confirms the phone's name and, well, not much else.\n\nLuckily, a Vanity Fair magazine advertisement shared by Engadget contains a bit more information on the Lumia 928. The ad highlights the 928's camera features, backing up the rumors that it packs a PureView camera with Carl Zeiss lens, Optical Image Stabilization and a focus on low-light performance. The phone in the ad also sports some Verizon branding that's not shown on Nokia's site.\n\nAlong with its PureView camera, the Lumia 928 is rumored to include a 4.5-inch touchscreen, 1.5GHz dual-core processor and support for simultaneous voice and data. None of these features have been confirmed by Nokia or Verizon, though. The good news is that the phone is finally official, which hopefully means that it won't be much longer before Verizon folk can finally get their mitts on Big Red's latelst Lumia. Stay tuned and we'll give you a shout once we hear more."
