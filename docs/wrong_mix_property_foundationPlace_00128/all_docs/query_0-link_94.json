        "text": "HMD Global has announced a partnership with the upcoming 25th James Bond movie, No Time To Die under which Nokia's first 5G smartphone and other devices will be star attractions, apart from Daniel Craig, of course. The smartphone maker has also released a promotional video for the campaign starring Lashana Lynch as Agent Nomi. The advert is directed by BAFTA Award-winning director Amma Asante and inspired by No Time To Die.\n\nNo Time To Die will feature a range of Nokia phones, forming part of an integrated campaign running across cinema, digital, social, OOH and retail which goes live on 8 March, International Women’s Day. In the film, Agent Nomi utilises the range of capabilities of the new Nokia phones portfolio, including the first ever 5G Nokia smartphone which will be fully unveiled on 19 March.\n\nFor those unaware, the new James Bond film has been postponed by seven months due to the coronavirus impact. It is now scheduled to release in UK cinemas on November 12, 2020.\n\nThe other Nokia smartphones to be part of the film are the Nokia 7.2, featuring a powerful 48MP triple camera with Quad Pixel technology and ZEISS Optics and the iconic Nokia 3310.\n\nWATCH | Realme X50 Pro 5G review\n\n\"Following the announcement to postpone the movie launch to 12 November, we now have a really exciting year ahead of us in the build up to this much anticipated release. Few cultural properties place technology at the heart of their appeal quite like No Time To Die. The film’s commitment to innovation, paired with the amazing technology built into each Nokia smartphone, making our devices the only gadget that anyone – even a 00 agent – will ever need, makes this partnership a real force to be reckoned with,\" Juho Sarvikas, HMD Global Chief Product Officer said.\n\n\"Trust, security and iconic quality design are the foundations every Nokia phone is built upon and our values reflect those of No Time to Die and the trailblazing new 00 agent, Nomi. We take great pride in making the latest technology accessible to everyone and look forward to doing this via our latest partnership,\" he added."
