        "text": "Requisition: 78853\n\nPSEG Company: PSEG Services Corp.\n\nSalary Range: $ 75,000 - $ 118,700\n\nIncentive: PIP 10%\n\nWork Location Category: Hybrid\n\nPSEG operates under a Flexible Work Model where flexible work is offered when job requirements allow. In support of this model, roles have been categorized into one of four work location categories: onsite roles, hybrid roles that are a blend of onsite and remote work, remote local roles that are primarily home-based but require some level of purpose-driven in-person interaction and living within a commutable distance, and remote non-local roles that can be effectively performed remotely with the ability to work in approved states.\n\nWe want you to be healthy, balanced, and feel secure. That’s why you’ll enjoy a comprehensive range of benefits, with a focus on supporting your whole health. Starting on day one of your employment, you’ll be offered several health-related benefits including medical, vision, dental, and well-being and behavioral health programs. We also offer 401(k) with company match, company paid life insurance, tuition reimbursement and a minimum of 18 days of paid time off per year.\n\nPSEG offers a unique experience to our more than 12,000 employees – we provide the resources and opportunities for career development that come with being a Fortune 500 company, as well as the attention, camaraderie and care for one another you might typically associate with a small business. Our focus on combatting climate change through clean energy technology, our new net zero climate vision for 2030 and enhanced commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion; and supporting the communities we serve make this a particularly exciting time to join PSEG.\n\nPSEG is an equal opportunity employer, dedicated to a policy of non-discrimination in employment, including the hiring process, based on any legally protected characteristic. Legally protected characteristics include race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability or veteran status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law in locations where PSEG employs individuals.\n\nAs an employee of PSEG you should be aware that during storm restoration efforts, you may be required to perform functions outside of your routine duties and on a schedule that may be different from normal operations.\n\nFor all roles, PSEG’s drug and alcohol testing program includes pre-employment testing, testing for cause, and post-incident/accident testing. For employees in federally regulated roles (including positions covered by USDOT, PHMSA, or NRC regulations), this also includes random testing. Although numerous states throughout the country have legalized marijuana/cannabis products recreationally and/or medically, it is prohibited for employees in federally regulated roles. Employees who are hired or transfer into a federally regulated role are subject to drug and alcohol testing, inclusive of marijuana. Please note that the use of CBD products may result in a positive drug test for THC/Marijuana and such use is not a legitimate medical explanation for such a positive result.\n\nPSEG employees must apply for jobs internally through emPower which can be accessed through sharepoint.pseg.com by clicking on the emPower icon, then selecting careers. This site (PSEG Careers and Job Openings) is strictly for candidates who are not currently PSEG employees, with the exception of PSEG employees who do not have company email addresses.\n\nPSEG is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities. If you have a disability and need assistance applying for a position, please call 973-430-3845 or email accommodations@pseg.com.\n\nIf you need to request a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job, email accommodations@pseg.com.
