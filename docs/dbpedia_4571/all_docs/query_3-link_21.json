        "text": "February 5: How Can Ordinary People Make a Difference to the Climate Crisis?\n\nCaroline Levine (Cornell University, Literatures in English)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Most of us have learned to focus on what we each buy and waste, but there are reasons these actions might not help us to avert the worst of the climate crisis. In this seminar, we’ll think about how social change happens, and we’ll focus on shifting our attention from the power of individual consumers to the effectiveness of groups.\n\nBio: Caroline Levine has spent her career asking how and why the humanities and the arts matter, especially in democratic societies. She argues for an understanding of forms and structures as essential both to understanding links between art and society and to the challenge of taking meaningful political action. In her latest book, The Activist Humanist, Levine explores how humanities thinking can guide effective political action.\n\nFeb 12: The Importance of Wetlands and Waterbodies to the Global Carbon Budget\n\nMeredith Holgerson (Cornell University, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Wetlands, ponds, and lakes play an important role in global carbon cycling by sequestering carbon in their sediments and emitting greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Yet, there is a lot of uncertainty in the extent to which wetlands and waterbodies are carbon sinks or carbon sources, and inventorying emissions. In this talk, we will discuss the role of wetlands and waterbodies in the global carbon budget and provide an overview of our lab’s research studying the carbon cycle in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.\n\nBio: Meredith Holgerson is a freshwater ecologist studying how ponds and lakes function and respond to environmental change. Her research program focuses on community and ecosystem ecology, and she is interested in how organisms and ecosystem processes interact. She asks questions about freshwater food webs, community composition, greenhouse gas production, and ecosystem metabolism. Her research relies on field studies, small-scale and whole-ecosystem experiments, and collaborations to scale local observations to global patterns.\n\nFeb. 19: Heat Waves: Extreme Events in a Warming World\n\nLucas Vargas Zeppetello (UC Berkeley, Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Among the most consequential environmental hazards, heat waves are complicated phenomena that involve relationships between the atmosphere, the land surface, and the biosphere. In this seminar, we’ll learn about how heat waves are changing across the global land surface, why this might be happening, and what it means for human exposure to dangerous levels of heat stress.\n\nBio: Lucas Vargas Zeppetello is an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at UC Berkeley. His research focuses on understanding the relationship between novel soil moisture observations, ecosystem dynamics, and land surface climate variability.\n\nMarch 4: The Place of Human Values in Climate-risk Research\n\nCasey Helgeson (Pennsylvania State University)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Climate change poses many risks. Research on these risks—and on what to do about them—unavoidably goes beyond purely scientific matters to touch on questions of values and ethics. Whose risks are most worthy of attention from researchers? Which stakeholder perspectives are acknowledged when assessing potential responses to risk? In this seminar, I will provide an overview of important concepts for thinking and communicating clearly about the interplay of social values and STEM research. I will discuss best practices for navigating this interplay and show examples of their implementation in the area of climate-risk research.\n\nBio: Casey Helgeson is an assistant research professor at Penn State’s Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. His work addresses the place of human values within research design practices. He focuses on climate-risk research with the goal of ensuring such research can support inclusive and values-based decision-making about climate adaptation. Before Penn State, he held postdoc positions at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and London School of Economics. He holds a PhD in Philosophy and BS in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nMarch 11: Meeting the Net-zero Challenge: Corporate Climate Impact at Scale With the Voluntary Carbon Market\n\nDr. Jennifer Jenkins (Rubicon Carbon)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: The economic transformation required to reach global net zero requires change on the scale of the Industrial Revolution, taking place with the speed of the Digital Revolution (Al Gore, 2021). And while progress is encouraging, it is still too slow. The private sector is an important lever for change, but in order for the private sector to act, the range of solutions presented must be palatable and practical for corporate actors. The voluntary carbon market (VCM) is a critical mechanism that can be scaled for impact to help companies meet their own net zero goals. This talk will introduce the VCM, describing how it works and the opportunities it presents, as well as the barriers it faces.\n\nBio: Dr. Jennifer Jenkins is Chief Science Officer at Rubicon Carbon, a company specializing in supporting enterprise customers through their decarbonization and net-zero journeys with market-based products and solutions. Dr. Jenkins is broadly responsible for ensuring that Rubicon’s products and portfolio meet the highest standards for quality and integrity. In addition, she leads Rubicon Carbon’s work on monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) as well as stakeholder engagement, ESG strategy, marketing, and thought leadership.\n\nWith a technical background in carbon cycling and ecosystem science, Dr. Jenkins brings more than 25 years of experience on matters at the intersection of business and climate across government, academia, and the private sector. A co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Prize along with Al Gore and other IPCC scientists, she led the work that culminated in the publication of the “Jenkins Equations,” the widely accepted method for estimating tree biomass from diameter in the US. Dr. Jenkins earned a Ph.D. in Ecosystem Science and Natural Resources from the University of New Hampshire, a Master of Forest Science from Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, a Bachelor of Arts in Biology and Environmental Studies from Dartmouth College, and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Maryland’s RH Smith School of Business.\n\nMarch 18: Climate Intervention: What Do We Know, What Do We Need to Know, Should We Know It?\n\nDaniele Visioni (Cornell University, Earth & Atmospheric Science)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Climate intervention (or climate engineering, or geoengineering) is a topic that is gaining prominence in mainstream climate policy discourse, especially as the chance of remaining below 1.5 ºC of warming above preindustrial levels fades. It is defined as any deliberate, large scale intervention in the climate system aimed at reducing the harmful effects of the increase in greenhouse gases. As an umbrella term, it usually includes both large scale methods of CO₂ removal from the atmosphere (Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR) and methods aimed at reducing the incoming sunlight in order to cool the planet (Solar Radiation Modification, SRM). In this talk, I will give an overview of SRM methods, and focus on the diverse sets of challenges they present: technological, ethical and related to governance. CDR or “negative emissions” are now present in almost all “net-zero” plans from both governments and private sector actors, and all major scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) include some; but problems with their probable environmental impacts, land use, trade-offs with food production and technical challenges with their scalability need to be addressed, and uncertainties abound. SRM, while still at the fringe, may offer on the other hand a “cheap and easy” temporary solution capable to ameliorate some of the risks, but far more research would be necessary to understand its potential, limits, and novel risks, and some burning questions remain: whose hand would be on the thermostat, whose consent should be asked before SRM could even start, and can a global governance system capable of ensuring a “just” deployment ever be developed?\n\nBio: Daniele Visioni is an Assistant Professor in the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department at Cornell University since 2023. He received his PhD in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics in 2018 in Italy. With the use of Earth System Models, he researches the impacts of stratospheric aerosols on climate, societies and environments. His research is mostly focused on understanding the potential impacts of Climate Intervention techniques, collaborating across disciplines to understand what information would be needed to produce robust, trustworthy assessments that decision-makers and publics may use to make informed decisions about their eventual deployment. He’s the co-chair of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) and of the Lighthouse Activity on Climate Intervention for the World Climate Research Program.\n\nMarch 25: The Next Phase of Business Sustainability\n\nAndrew Hoffman (Holcim Professor of Sustainable Enterprise, University of Michigan)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Business sustainability has come a long way. From the dawn of the modern environmental movement and the establishment of environmental regulations in the 1970s, it has become a strategic concern driven by market forces today. But, the era of corporations integrating sustainable practices is being surpassed by a new age of corporations actively transforming the market to make it more sustainable. The first phase of business sustainability, what we call “enterprise integration,” is founded on a model of business responding to market shifts to increase competitive positioning by integrating sustainability into preexisting business considerations. By contrast, the next phase of business sustainability, what we call “market transformation,” is founded on a model of business transforming the market.

This will require the electricity sector to play a pivotal role in the transformation of how we produce and consume energy. We need to switch completely to zero- and low-carbon means of producing electricity, while switching from fossil fuel combustion to use of electricity in a variety of applications in buildings, transportation, and industry. This seminar will explore the issues, challenges, and opportunities in the electricity sector as we transition to clean energy\n\nBio: Dr. Karl Hausker is a Senior Fellow in the Climate Program at the World Resources Institute.

Max Zhang (Cornell University, Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: This talk goes through two major developments in energy transitions and the associated social, economic, and environmental impacts. The phenomenal growth in shale gas production over the last decade has fundamentally reshaped the energy systems in the U.S. and geopolitics in the world. However, the environmental and climate impacts of shale gas development have led to distinctly different energy policies even in neighboring states. Large-scale solar is an emerging energy development in the U.S. While it plays a critical role in achieving the ambitious grid decarbonization goals, the public acceptance of large-scale solar has been mixed. The speaker argues that a new kind of developmental process is necessary to accelerate renewable energy deployment while creating vibrant communities that host those projects.\n\nBio: Dr. Zhang’s research interests focus on energy and the environment, driven by societal impact. He studies the interactions between energy and environmental systems using numerical models and experimental techniques, in the context of air pollution, renewable energy, and deep decarbonization. His research has led to major legislation and programs in New York, the U.S., and internationally. He is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Dr. Zhang’s group aims to establish a source-to-receptor relationship for harmful airborne particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants and indoor contaminants, with applications on near-source air pollution, indoor environmental quality, and environmental justice.\n\nApril 29: Climate Change: Past, Present, and Future\n\nKate Marvel (NASA)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: It’s now unequivocal that human activities are changing the climate. The world is 1.2°C hotter than it was before the Industrial Revolution, and this is already having profound consequences for everyone who lives on the planet. But the climate has changed before – how do we know the most recent trends are attributable to humans? And what can past climate change teach us about what lies in store? In this seminar, we’ll discuss how scientists use multiple tools – climate models and tree rings, historical records, and satellite observations – to answer these questions.\n\nBio: Kate Marvel is a Research Physical Scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. She served as Chapter Lead for Climate Trends on the Fifth National Climate Assessment.

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been used widely to assess current policies and quantify the additional efforts needed to close the gap. Yet, IAMs still lack adequate considerations of socio-political factors that are central to climate policy making. This makes them overly abstract and simplistic to inform concrete decisions by national and subnational policymakers. In this talk, I will discuss our research focused on three areas to make IAMs more decision-relevant: 1) enhancing policy realism by incorporating political economy insights on policy instrument choices; 2) assessing winners and losers of climate policy by coupling IAMs with fine-scale impact assessment models; and 3) identifying equitable policy strategies by assessing multiple objectives under future uncertainties. I will demonstrate a range of modeling examples, from impacts of U.S. industrial policy on future decarbonization to the unintended health effects from a global carbon price.\n\nBio: Wei Peng is an assistant professor in the School of Public and International Affairs and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University.

China produced nearly 30% of global carbon emissions in 2020, making Xi Jinping’s declaration that year that his country would be carbon neutral by 2060 one of epic significance. Will China be able to meet or exceed this goal, and what political and economic roadblocks stand in its way? This lecture introduces some of the challenges, opportunities, and competing narratives at play, with a particular focus on real estate construction and China’s growth model.\n\nBio: Prof. Wallace teaches courses related to urbanization, authoritarianism, and economic development.

CUBO extends through largely low porosity and permeability Paleozoic sedimentary rocks above granulite-grade Grenville metamorphic basement rocks.\n\nThe main objective of CUBO is to explore potential fracture-dominated reservoir targets in both the sedimentary units and basement where temperatures are anticipated to range between 70 – 95 oC and help guide and de-risk decisions regarding the development of deep geothermal energy systems both at Cornell and elsewhere. CUBO is designed to be a dedicated observatory and testing borehole, separate from any future operational well pairs, and the resulting data and findings will be openly shared. The access to the subsurface provided by CUBO also permits ancillary experiments and investigations that advance our understanding of subsurface processes and conditions in general.\n\nHere I will discuss the preliminary results of our analysis of the various geologic, hydrologic, logging, sampling, and downhole testing data acquired. I will also discuss the opportunities and general challenges associated with geothermal energy, and the important role earth scientists have in developing sustainable low-carbon energy solutions.\n\nRecommended Reading: Geothermal 2.0: Why Cornell University Put a 2-Mile Hole in the Earth (Christian Science Monitor, 10/28/2022)\n\nBio: Patrick Fulton joined the faculty of Cornell’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) in January 2019.

Sources of Uncertainty in Climate Change Projections and How to Handle Them\n\nFlavio Lehner (Cornell University, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Climate is changing and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. How much exactly is however unknown because many different sources of uncertainty contribute to cloud our outlook. Do we understand the physics well enough? Are climate models fit for purpose? What are humans going to do? And what about natural variability of the climate system? In this talk, I will discuss all of these sources of uncertainty and how, despite them, we can make useful predictions about future climate and its impacts on humans and ecosystems.\n\nBio: Flavio Lehner joined the Cornell Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences in 2020 as an assistant professor. “Climate science is inherently an interdisciplinary science and solving its puzzles requires the kind of open-mindedness and excellence that a place like Cornell has fostered since its foundation,” says Lehner. Lehner’s research strives to improve our collective understanding of large-scale climate variability and change and its influence on regional climate impacts such as droughts, heatwaves, or wildfires.\n\nMarch 6: How to Reach Low Carbon Targets – What does the 1.5C Report Tell Us?\n\nNatalie Mahowald (Cornell University, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences)\n\n(video)\n\nBio: Natalie Mahowald is the Irving Porter Church Professor in Engineering, Director of Graduate Studies for Atmospheric Sciences in the College of Engineering, and the Co-Leader, Working Group on Reducing Climate Risk for Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.

Indeed, they have arguably pioneered the idea of “usable science.” Today, the climate crisis and the urgent challenges of the Anthropocene demand a more robust relationship between scientific research and on-the-ground action, strong networks sharing local lessons globally, and channels for injecting global, long-term perspectives into the noise of short-termism. We discuss insights into these challenges from the historical land-grant experience and examples of ongoing work in climate services and climate action at Rutgers University.\n\nBio: Robert Kopp is a climate scientist who serves at Rutgers University as a Professor in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences and as Co-Director of the University Office of Climate Action.

Jenkins (Penn State, Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, Geography, and African Studies)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: During the spring of 1963, while my brother and I were in the protective space of my mother’s womb, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was in a Birmingham prison because of his non-violent resistance against social injustice. While in prison, he wrote his fellow clergypersons to let them know about his disappointment in their lack of social justice action against a racist system of laws and the violence black Americans had been facing. Some 60 years later, we see another form of injustice all around the globe, with new burdens placed on future generations in terms of climate injustice— which includes the hazards of climate change, environmental injustice, and social injustice. In this talk, I discuss the reasons why we need a climate justice movement and why we can’t wait any longer.\n\nBio: Prof. Jenkins’ climate research focuses on late 20th century drying and model projections of more arid conditions in the middle to late 21st century have and may further alter the way of life for many in West Africa. Understanding the processes related to these changes require analysis of regional and global models. It also requires a better understanding of limited observations for determining emerging trends in West Africa. Climate variability and change will increase the challenges of decision-makers in West Africa who are addressing issues of urbanization, poverty alleviation, water resources, public health, and food security.\n\nMarch 27: A Roadmap for Climate Action – Investing in Technology, Nature and Policy for a Sustainable Planet\n\nStephan Nicoleau (Managing Director at FullCycle)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Solving the climate crisis will require new ways of doing business and allocating resources that can benefit both people and the planet. Climate science tells us that abating the most harmful greenhouse gasses and protecting nature’s role in stabilizing our climate has the potential to avoid runaway warming scenarios. While the solutions for effective climate action are largely known, it is the speed of implementation that will matter greatly, as will our ability to see the many dimensions of the scaling problem. This talk will roadmap technological and nature-based solutions, financing mechanisms, and effective policy – all of which play a critical role in addressing the most pressing issue of our times. It will highlight the key levers for action, such as methane mitigation, climate finance mobilization, and natural systems restoration – and our common but differentiated responsibilities for action in this most critical decade ahead.\n\nBio: Stephan Nicoleau is a General Partner at FullCycle, a sustainable infrastructure fund that is accelerating climate solutions globally. He is a member of the Board of Directors for Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization that has built one of the most enduring climate solutions frameworks.

A trio of energy, infrastructure, and science laws passed by the last Congress will deploy over half a trillion dollars of public funding over the next decade to wean the United States off fossil fuels and make cleaner alternatives cheap and ubiquitous. The challenge now: to build new clean energy infrastructure at an unprecedented pace and scale and take full advantage of this historic opportunity. This talk will discuss how far the U.S. has come on the path to net-zero emissions, how much work remains, and the many non-financial barriers that will slow the pace of transition unless proactively addressed. Prof. Jenkins leads the ZERO Lab at Princeton University, was a co-PI for the landmark Net-Zero America study, a co-author of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine report Accelerating Decarbonization of the U.S. Energy System, and currently leads the REPEAT Project, which assesses the impacts of federal energy and climate policies on an ongoing basis.\n\nBio: Jesse D.

Fossil fuels, the major source of warming, are still contributing more than 78% of global energy. I will describe a new approach for bouncing back from the crisis cleaner, healthier, and stronger. It will target climate resilience, built on three pillars: Mitigation, Adaptation, and Societal transformation. For societal transformation, I will describe ideas considered by social scientists to bring more Americans in favor of urgent climate actions. These involve narrative changes: from climate change to public health to get more public support; individual actions such as avoiding waste; pivot from short-termism to long-term co-benefits such as a cleaner and more technologically advanced America; among several others. Alliance with local to regional faith leaders should be explored to unpack climate change from all the other issues that have divided our Nation.\n\nBio: Veerabhadran “Ram” Ramanathan discovered the greenhouse effect of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) in 1975 and showed that a ton each of CFC-11 and CFC-12 has more global warming effect than 10,000 tons of CO2. This discovery established the now-accepted fact that non-CO2 gases are a major contributor to planetary warming and also enabled the Montreal Protocol to become the first successful climate mitigation policy. For this work, he was awarded the 2009 Tyler Prize by Nobel Laureate Sherwood Rowland. In 1980, Madden and Ramanathan were the first to make a statistical prediction that global warming will be detected above the background noise by 2000, a prediction which was verified by the IPCC in 2001. He led a NASA study with its climate satellite to show that clouds had a net cooling effect on the planet and quantified the radiation interactions with water vapor and its amplification of CO2 warming. He led international field campaigns and developed unmanned aircraft platforms for tracking brown cloud pollution worldwide. His work has led to numerous policies including the formation of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition by the United Nations to reduce short-lived climate pollutants (HFCs; Methane; Black Carbon and Ozone).\n\nApril 24: How Can We Understand the Vulnerabilities Communities Face to Climate Change-related Disasters and Equitably Build Resilience Within Those Communities?\n\nRebecca Morgenstern Brenner (Brooks School of Public Policy)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: We know climate change means that there will be more frequent and more intense disasters.

A fundamental ambivalence lies at the heart of the science of human “vulnerability” to climate change. As psychoanalysts concerned with climate change have recently observed, the culture of industrial capitalism tends to breed individuals who cannot tolerate evidence of their dependence on other people, nor on the physical environment. The sciences of the atmosphere have alternately critiqued and contributed to this idealization of invulnerability. To illuminate this dynamic, this presentation outlines a history of scientific efforts to measure the dependence of living things on the atmosphere. It focuses on the earliest such effort, the invention of the eudiometer (literally, a gauge of the air’s “virtue”) in the eighteenth century. The rise and fall of eudiometry reflected a momentous shift in the meaning of “sensibility,” a predecessor to today’s concept of vulnerability. This history holds important lessons for the science and policy of climate risk in the twenty-first century.\n\nBio: Deborah R. Coen is a historian of science whose research focuses on the modern physical and environmental sciences and on central European intellectual and cultural history.

While we are currently producing more than we ever have, this has not meant food and nutrition security for all, furthermore, agriculture and associated land use is now major contributor to climate change, exceedance of biogeochemical flows, biodiversity loss, and water over-extraction. By the same token, climate change and extremes increasingly threaten agriculture and food security. In response to these challenges, interest in sustainable food system transformations is growing, and a large emphasis has been placed on improving agricultural production. Emerging efforts (and carbon markets) are even pursuing agriculture as a “nature-based” climate solution via increasing soil and agroecosystem carbon sequestration. Land systems modeling is a crucial tool for understanding agriculture as both a driver of global environmental change as well as its vulnerabilities to these changes. Both must be better understood – and better modeled – in order to meet the combined goals of global food security and global environmental change mitigation into the future. My talk will provide a brief overview of agriculture-Earth systems interactions and identify key questions for modeling agriculture in a land and Earth systems framework. In doing so, I will flag key outstanding uncertainties on which future research is needed and highlight important efforts for coordinated and cross-disciplinary Earth system modeling centered around agriculture and land use.\n\nBio: Sonali McDermid is an Associate Professor in the Dept. of Environmental Studies at NYU.

Most estimates suggest that to keep temperatures below 2C, a radical reduction in energy demand, transformation of the electric power industry to renewable energy, electrification of many industries, and substantial deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies is required in the US and the world. What role does Cornell play in this effort? Our Campus has pledged to cut direct emissions from our Combined Heat and Power Plant to zero by 2035, but is that enough? Here we discuss what the carbon footprint is for Cornell as a whole, including procurement and waste, what the greatest sources of emissions are, and talk about what can be done to bring Cornell’s full carbon footprint into the red (negative) by 2040.\n\nBio: Natalie Mahowald is the Irving Porter Church Professor in Engineering, Director of Graduate Studies for Atmospheric Sciences in the College of Engineering, and the Co-Leader, Working Group on Reducing Climate Risk for Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.

Every year, the land and ocean natural carbon reservoirs, the so-called carbon ‘sinks’, absorb 55% on average of the CO2 emissions we put in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other activities. The carbon sinks slow down the pace of climate change, but they respond themselves to a changing climate by leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere. This lecture will review the latest trends in CO2 emissions including the effect of COVID-19 measures on emissions, and show their current partitioning in the environment. It will discuss the major sources of uncertainties in near-term CO2 emissions and in the long-term capacity of the natural environment to absorb further carbon.\n\nBio: Corinne Le Quéré is a Royal Society Research Professor of Climate Change Science at the University of East Anglia. She conducts research on the interactions between climate change and the carbon cycle, including those mediated by marine ecosystems.

But how do we make sure science is even relevant to what decision-makers and policy-makers need? How do we do this in a world that seems to speed up from year to year? Can we stay relevant? Scientists’ interactions with decision-makers have gone through several revisions of the so-called “social contract of science with society”. These changes were the result, in part, of key shifts in science policy and science funding policy, and more fundamentally, the result of democratization, political-economic changes in educational systems, the neo-liberalization of the academy, rapid changes in technology, the economy, society and local and global environments. This presentation will briefly characterize prior stages in science-policy/practice interactions, and then explore how scientists and their research can become – and stay – relevant in the face-paced and often challenging world in which policies and decisions get made. The topic is not new, but the world in which science tries to be useful is ever more difficult to navigate. What are the implications of accelerating climate change, which is not only a uniquely challenging topic for (physical, natural and social science) research, but which is needed and yet faces unique challenges if it wishes to be “of use” in decision-making. The talk will propose possible pathways for the engaged science of the future, placing these possibilities into the contentious debate between “the accelerated academe” and “slow science.” In doing so, it raises questions and invites us into reflections about what it means to be a “scientist” in a fast, chaotic and increasingly difficult world, how to effectively engage with others, and how to find one’s place, i.e., shape a career, in engaged science.\n\nBio: Dr. Susanne C.

As climate changes, so does the risk of disruption of the water cycle we have adapted to. The distribution of precipitation (or lack thereof) in space and time is anticipated to change, and in some respects already is changing, in response to warming. But quantifying the various aspects of this risk is a challenge because of the diverse sources of uncertainty – including natural variability, structural differences among climate models and their projections, and the range of trajectories society might choose to follow. This talk will highlight some of the key questions about Earth’s water cycle and its changes: How does precipitation vary over time, and in response to climate change? Does the latest generation of model simulations have anything new to tell us about this? And, what do we mean when talk about “extreme” precipitation?\n\nBio: Angie Pendergrass has a BS in meteorology/math and physics from the University of Miami, and an MS and PhD in atmospheric science from the University of Washington. She then joined the National Center for Atmospheric Research as an Advanced Studies Program postdoctoral research fellow. After moving to CIRES at the University of Colorado as a Visiting Fellow, she returned to NCAR as a Project Scientist. She also spent one year as a visitor at ETH-Zurich in Switzerland. She joined Cornell as an Assistant Professor in 2020. Dr. Pendergrass’s research focuses on extreme precipitation and its response to climate variability and change. She studies extreme precipitation and its change holistically, at planetary scales and in the context of the distribution of precipitation in intensity, space, and time. Her research is grounded in a top-down approach that considers fundamental questions about precipitation and its change, including: what role does precipitation play in the flow of energy through the climate system, and what can we learn about precipitation and its change from this? How have extreme precipitation events changed in the past, how will change in the future, and what processes drive these changes? How accurately do models simulate the hydrologic cycle, and how can we improve their accuracy? What are the causes and consequences of changes in the hydrologic cycle for circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, climate sensitivity, and society? In order to address these questions, she develops compact but powerful and useful metrics to describe the characteristics of precipitation. Her toolbox includes theory, analysis of observations, and a hierarchy of models from fully coupled climate models to radiative transfer models and heuristic stochastic models.\n\nMarch 14: Carbon Dioxide Removal: The Social and Policy Landscape\n\nHolly Buck (University at Buffalo)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Countries, subnational jurisdictions, and companies that have set out net-zero emissions targets now face the challenge of laying out specific roadmaps for how they will meet those targets. In most cases, these long-term strategies involve figuring out where and how to remove carbon in order to compensate for some amount of remaining emissions from hard-to-abate sectors like agriculture. Civil society is discussing climate justice risks from carbon dioxide removal as a whole, in terms of the potential for mitigation deterrence, as well as environmental justice risks from particular approaches. Meanwhile, scientists have been studying the technical potentials of various carbon dioxide removal methods, but we also know that social and political factors are going to be critical in scaling up carbon dioxide removal. This talk discusses specific examples from research conducted in the United States that point towards how social science research can help identify community concerns, priorities, and potential benefits from carbon dioxide removal projects and policies. It describes what social science has learned to date about the social dimensions of carbon removal, and outlines priorities for future interdisciplinary research to inform carbon removal policy on multiple scales.\n\nBio: Holly Jean Buck (Ph.D. ’17) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Environment and Sustainability at the University at Buffalo. She is an expert on the social and political dimensions of environmental policies, and of strategies and technologies for preventing and adapting to climate change. Buck has published extensively on the politics of carbon removal. Her 2019 book, “After Geoengineering: Climate Tragedy, Repair, and Restoration,” examines topics such as industrial seaweed farms, large-scale carbon sequestration, restoration of wetlands, and reforestation. She has also written about uncertainties surrounding solar geoengineering, in which — hypothetically — tiny aerosols could be injected into the atmosphere to block solar radiation. Buck is interested in how communities can adapt to climate change, and in how the public and environmental groups engage with emerging technologies. Additionally, Buck has studied the Salton Sea in southern California, drawing on interviews, community meetings, and archival material to understand how people living in the area view the decline of this rapidly shrinking inland lake.\n\nMarch 21: Climate Mitigation in Three Parts: Energy, Land, and Removal\n\nSteven J. Davis (University of California, Irvine)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Global climate targets entail reaching net-zero emissions of long-lived GHGs around midcentury. I’ll present recent work from my group on options and challenges related to climate mitigation along three distinct fronts. First, I’ll present analyses of the geophysical constraints on reliable solar- and wind-based electricity systems, including related modeling of long-duration energy storage options. Second, I’ll share findings of work assessing the global and regional drivers of land-use GHG emissions, including the magnitude and patterns of these emissions embodied in global trade. And finally, I’ll show results from new global modeling to evaluate the biophysical and economic limits and key uncertainties of seaweed-based carbon dioxide removal.\n\nBio: Stephen J. Davis is an Associate Professor of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine. Prof. Davis works to understand and find ways to meet the challenge of satisfying global demand for energy, food, and goods without emitting carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. He is interested in studies of coupled human and natural systems and sustainable systems analysis, including: energy technology and policy; of pollution and resources embodied in international trade; of socio-economic inertia and “lock-in” of environmental problems; and of the complex interactions of energy systems, agriculture, climate change, and global ecology.\n\nMarch 28: Towards Sustainable Energy and Materials: Creating a New Circular Carbon Economy via Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage\n\nAh-Hyung (Alissa) Park (Columbia University)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: In order to meet the ever-increasing global energy demands while stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 level, the development of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies is one of the critical needs. In particular, there have been significant efforts to develop CO2 capture solvents and some (e.g., amine-based aqueous solvents) have shown very promising results. Unfortunately, the energy requirement for the current aqueous solvent systems is still considered to be too high. Thus, efforts have been focused on the development of the next generation CO2 capture materials, which are often water-free. Nanoparticle Organic Hybrid Materials (NOHMs) are a new class of organic-inorganic hybrids that consist of a hard nanoparticle core functionalized with a molecular organic corona that possesses a high degree of chemical and physical tunability. It has recently been discovered that NOHMs have interesting electrolyte properties which may allow the CO2 capture to be pulled by the in-situ CO2 conversion reactions. The development of these unique nanoscale hybrid materials will not only advance CO2 capture materials design but also introduce unique research opportunities in various energy and environmental fields. This seminar will discuss the challenges and opportunities of different CO2 capture and conversion pathways including Negative Emission Technologies (e.g., Direct Air Capture) that can allow the development of circular carbon and hydrogen economy using renewable energy.\n\nBio: Ah-Hyung (Alissa) Park is the Lenfest Earth Institute Professor of Climate Change in the Departments of Earth and Environmental Engineering & Chemical Engineering at Columbia University. She is also the Director of the Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy at the Earth Institute, Columbia Climate School. Her research focuses on sustainable energy and materials conversion pathways with emphasis on integrated Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies addressing climate change. Park group is also working on Direct Air Capture of CO2 and Negative Emission Technologies including BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and sustainable construction materials with low carbon intensity. Park received a number of professional awards and honors including ACS ENFL Mid-Career Researcher Award (2022), U.S. C3E Research Award (2018), PSRI Lectureship Award at AIChE (2018), ACS Energy and Fuels Division – Emerging Researcher Award (2018), ACS WCC Rising Star Award (2017), and NSF CAREER Award (2009). Park also led a number of global and national discussions on CCUS including the Mission Innovation Workshop on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage in 2017 and the National Petroleum Council CCUS Report in 2019. Park is a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), American Chemical Society (ACS), Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), and American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\n\nApril 11: Bringing Science to Bear for Climate Solutions and Environmental Justice – A Perspective from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\n\nGretchen Goldman (White House Office of Science and Technology Policy)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Now is a critical time for action to address the climate crisis and the scientific community has a key role to play—not only in advancing scientific understanding of climate change and its impacts, but also in science communication and engagement with communities, stakeholders, and decision makers at all levels. Policy decisions on climate change must be informed by both scientific evidence and robust community input. The impacts of climate change exacerbate existing societal inequities, and climate solutions must ensure that community voices are elevated and environmental justice is delivered to communities across the nation. The Biden administration is employing a whole-of-government approach to advance climate solutions and address environmental injustices. This talk will highlight the ongoing work of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and other parts of the US Government to address issues of climate change and environmental justice.\n\nBio: Gretchen Goldman is currently serving at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy as the Assistant Director for Environmental Science, Engineering, Policy, and Justice. Dr Goldman is the research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. For a decade, Dr. Goldman has led research and advocacy efforts at the nexus of science and policy on topics including federal scientific integrity, fossil energy production, climate change, and environmental justice. Dr. Goldman has testified before Congress and sits on the board of the nonprofit 500 Women Scientists. Previously, Dr. Goldman has served as an expert on the Public Health Rulemaking of the California Department of Conservation’s Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM), chaired the Air and Climate Public Advisory Committee for the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, and served on the UNESCO/AAAS Consultation Group on the US science ecosystem. Her words and voice have appeared in Science, Nature, The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, NPR, and the BBC, among other outlets. Dr. Goldman holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in environmental engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a B.S. in atmospheric science from Cornell University.\n\nApril 18: How to Achieve Net Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Midcentury\n\nStephen Pacala (Princeton University)\n\n(video)\n\nBio: Stephen Pacala is the Frederick D. Petrie Professor in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University. He is interested in the processes that govern ecological communities, the interplay between community and ecosystem-level processes, and the interactions between the global biosphere and climate. His approach is to develop, calibrate and test mathematical models that explain ecological structure and function. His research focuses on all aspects of the global carbon cycle. Over the past several years, his research group has developed methods to scale-up individual-based models of communities and ecosystems. They use these methods to scale up so-called gap models of vegetation. The method provides partial differential equations that govern the behavior of a large-scale simulation model of a landscape, without the need to run the individual-based model. Their global model makes predictions about the large-scale distribution of biomes and associated biogeochemical fluxes, as well as specific local predictions including hourly physiological carbon gain and water loss, community composition and dynamics throughout succession, the outcome of spatial competition among plant species, and the fluxes of nitrogen, water, and carbon.\n\nApril 25: Lessons From the Front Line\n\nMary Nichols (Cornell Atkinson Visiting Senior Fellow and Former Chair of the California Air and Resources Board)\n\n(video)\n\nMary D. Nichols ’66 is widely recognized for a career as one of the world’s most important environmental regulators. As chair of the California Air and Resources Board (CARB), California’s powerful air pollution and climate regulatory agency from 1975-1982 and then from 2007-2020, she led California’s leading battle to cut smog and carbon emissions. Under Nichols’ leadership, CARB enacted the first comprehensive cap on industrial greenhouse gas emissions by any major regulatory agency in the world. Nichols and CARB also crafted and enforced regulations that slashed air pollution from cars and light trucks by over 99%, paved the way for a new generation of advanced biofuels, and created the roadmap for a transition to a fully electrified transportation system. Nichols now is a professor at UCLA Law School and holds a visiting appointment in the Columbia Global Energy Program. At Cornell Atkinson, she serves as Visiting Senior Fellow and as a member of the Advisory Council. She also serves as the Vice-Chair of the China-California Climate Center and Co-Chair of the Commission on the Future of Mobility.\n\nMay 2: Climate Change and Health\n\nKristie L. Ebi (University of Washington)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Climate change is altering the mean and variability of weather variables and is causing sea-level rise. Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas driving climate change, also is causing ocean acidification and reducing the nutritional quality of major cereal crops. Future health risks will be determined by the interaction of the hazards created by a changing climate with the populations and regions exposed to those changes, and the sensitivity and capacity of those so exposed to prepare for and effectively manage changes in the magnitude and pattern of exposure. That is, interactions between climate change and demographic, socioeconomic, and other changes will determine the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Key climate change-related risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events (e.g., heat waves, storms, and floods). Indirect effects include increased risks of infectious diseases (including food-, water-, and vector-borne), food insecurity and malnutrition, and diffuse health impacts from loss of livelihoods and conflicts over resources and migration. Most risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming. At higher degrees of warming, thresholds may be crossed that could result in nonlinear responses.\n\nBio: Dr. Kristie L. Ebi has been conducting research and practice on the health risks of climate variability and change for 25 years. She conducts research to estimate current and future health risks of climate change; design adaptation policies and measures to reduce risks in multi-stressor environments; and estimate the health co-benefits of mitigation policies. She has been an author on multiple national and international climate change assessments, including the fourth U.S. National Climate Assessment and the IPCC 6th Assessment Report.\n\nMay 9: How Waste Became ‘Renewable’ in Baltimore – A Cautionary Tale\n\nChloe Ahmann (Cornell University Department of Anthropology)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: How do people in post-industrial landscapes relate to the future once trajectories like progress reveal themselves to be untenable? What might their experiments in hoping at the end of things teach us about dreaming big in the face of ecological apocalypse? This talk takes up these questions from the vantage point of South Baltimore City, following debates among neighbors over a proposed incinerator. Some worried the plant would solidify their neighborhood’s position as a “dumping ground,” while others thought it might revive them from an economic slump. For a time, the proposal laid bare categorical disagreements about what residents could reasonably desire from within the haze kicked up by an aging industrial order. Exploring two takes on the notion of what constitutes a “reasonable desire” and the future orientations that structure each, my research explores both the imaginative limits to achieving something like a just transition and the hard work it takes to stretch the boundaries of the possible. In this talk, in particular, I unfold a cautionary tale about the lure of techno-fixes by examining why some considered the incinerator to be a “renewable” technology. For those interested in learning more, the optional reading centers on a youth-led campaign to block the construction of this plant, showing how this group used the incinerator as an opening into two centuries of local history and the fight against it as an opportunity to practice “prefigurative” politics.\n\nBio: Chloe Ahmann is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Cornell. Chloe is an environmental anthropologist studying the long afterlife of American industry. Chloe’s work is based in Baltimore, following industrialism’s enduring traces in toxified landscapes, patchy regulation, quotidian expressions of white supremacy, and particular orientations toward time. The work considers what efforts to think and enact environmental futures look like from the sedimented space of late industrialism. Chloe is also beginning work on ecofascist sentiments in the United States, and the dark utopian visions that sustain them. For the latest research, see “Breathing Late Industrialism,” a thematic collection I co-edited for Engaging Science, Technology, and Society with Alison Kenner, and “Unbelonging: The Politics of Address,” recently out with Anthropological Theory Commons. Come Spring 2022, a special issue I edited on “Vacancy” will be published at Anthropological Quarterly.\n\nFebruary 15: Anthropogenic Climate Change Has Slowed Global Agricultural Productivity Growth\n\nAriel Ortiz-Bobea (Dyson School, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nAgricultural research has fostered productivity growth, but the historical influence of anthropogenic climate change on that growth has not been quantified. We develop a robust econometric model of weather effects on global agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) and combine this model with counterfactual climate scenarios to evaluate impacts of past climate trends on TFP. Our baseline model indicates that anthropogenic climate change has reduced global agricultural TFP by about 21% since 1961, a slowdown that is equivalent to losing the last 7 years of productivity growth. The effect is substantially more severe (a reduction of ~26-34%) in warmer regions such as Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. We also find that global agriculture has grown more vulnerable to ongoing climate change.\n\nFebruary 22: Carbon Dioxide Removal: Enhanced Weathering As a Billion Ton Solution?\n\nBenjamin Z. Houlton (The Ronald P. Lynch Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences)\n\n(video)\n\nHolding Earth’s climate to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of modern global warming is critical for food and national security, economic growth, infrastructure, and human health, welfare and justice on a worldwide scale. Although disagreement exists over the right mix of solutions, scenarios highlight that various combinations GHG emissions reductions (decarbonization of manufacturing, energy systems and transportation) and carbon dioxide removal technologies will be needed to meet the 1.5 degree C target in the 21st century. Here I discuss the role of enhanced weathering – the purposeful introduction of volcanic rock fines into agricultural soil – as a carbon dioxide removal strategy, with co-benefits for soil health, fertilizer use efficiency, and improved crop quality and yields. I focus on both the state of the science and issues and opportunities surrounding enhanced weathering as a billion-ton carbon dioxide removal strategy. I also present first year results from our large-scale demonstration project, known as the Working Lands Innovation Center, which is leveraging public-private-academic partnerships to examine the efficacy of enhanced weathering, biochar and manure-compost amendments across ~100 acres of cropland (corn, alfalfa, orchards) and managed rangeland soil in California.\n\nMarch 1: Angry Weather – Identifying to What Extent Climate Change is Taking Its Toll\n\nFriederike Otto (University of Oxford)\n\n(video)\n\nSome consequences of a warming world, namely an increased likelihood of more heat and high precipitation extremes, have been known and predicted for a long time and are now seen across the globe. However, these consequences only hold on large scales and can be counteracted or amplified regionally (smaller scales) by changes in the atmospheric circulation – where and how weather systems develop – also due to human-induced climate change.\n\nTo understand how the risks of local extreme events are changing requires a holistic perspective combining these effects. Recent advances in the emerging science of event attribution provide the necessary basis on which to build the tools needed to assess such risks at the spatial scales people care most about. These attribution studies are starting to become the basis for legal claims, loss and damages assessments and social mobilisation.\n\n(photo credit)\n\nMarch 8: Climate, People, and Forests in the Heart of India\n\nRuth DeFries (Columbia University)\n\n(video)\n\nAbstract: Climate is a wicked problem that requires understanding of people and places. Three stories from the forested areas of central India illustrate that efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change might be most successful if approached from the lens of local livelihoods and well-being: restoration of degraded forests; climate resilient and low-GHG cereal production; and migration between rural and urban areas. The stories identify the potential for climate solutions from interventions aimed at improved nutrition and living standards.\n\nBio: Ruth DeFries is a professor of ecology and sustainable development at Columbia University in New York. She uses images from satellites and field surveys to examine how the world’s demands for food and other resources are changing land use throughout the tropics. Her research quantifies how these land use changes affect climate, biodiversity and other ecosystem services, as well as human development. She has also developed innovate education programs in sustainable development. DeFries was elected as a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, one of the country’s highest scientific honors, received a MacArthur “genius” award, and is the recipient of many other honors for her scientific research. In addition to over 100 scientific papers, she is committed to communicating the nuances and complexities of sustainable development to popular audiences through her books “The Big Ratchet: How Humanity Thrives in the Face of Natural Crisis ” and “What Would Nature Do?: A Guide for Our Uncertain Times.”\n\nMarch 15: The Role of Social Capital in Community Resilience to Climate Change\n\nShorna Broussard Allred (Natural Resources and Environment, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nBio: Shorna Allred is an Associate Professor and Associate Director of the Center for Conservation Social Sciences at Cornell University with a joint faculty appointment in the Dept. of Natural Resources and the Environment and Dept. of Global Development. A conservation social scientist, her research examines conservation behavior, community resilience, and environmental justice. She also holds an appointment with the Southeast Asia Program and is a Visiting Professor at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.\n\nMarch 22: Racial Justice and the Impacts of Climate Change Through the Lens of Media Literacy\n\nCyndy Scheibe (Ithaca College)\n\n(video)\n\nHow can we understand two of the most critical issues of our time – racial justice and climate change, and the connections between them – during an “infodemic” of misinformation, disinformation and news spin? Media literacy provides a powerful context for deep conversations about the messages we see, hear and read. Focusing on the impacts and protests related to Black Lives Matter and climate change, we’ll use constructivist media decoding to collectively explore how we know what we know and how our own biases influence the ways in which we seek out, interpret and share information about the issues that matter most in our lives.\n\nMarch 29: Transitioning to a Resilient Low-carbon Economy: How Addressing Climate Change is Being Integrated Into Core Business and Investing in the Private Sector\n\nMaryam Golnaraghi (The Geneva Association)\n\n(video)\n\nDespite over two and a half decades of coordinated international negotiations on climate change, the dialogue, only recently, the focus of the climate change debate has moved from being mainly a scientific, environmental and social responsibility issue to one of the core drivers of socio-economic development and risk management. There is now widespread global recognition of climate change science and the associated socio-economic impacts as set out by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). To reach climate change goals as set by the Paris Agreement (United Nations 2015), and pivot away from fossil fuel dependence, policy advisors are outlining the need for dramatic changes in business models in different economic sectors and profound changes needed in everyday life impacting core and essential sectors of the world economy. However, while governments have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the development of public policies for an orderly transition to a resilient low carbon future has been stubbornly slow. An orderly transition requires coordinated efforts and scale. A disorderly (unplanned or not-well-planned) transition, could disrupt the global economy, and those who do not steer a course through it and who are left holding devalued investments and assets – whether carbon-intensive or carbon-reliant.\n\nIn the absence of clear national policies and strategies for transitioning, since 2016, major initiatives are underway through the financial sector, financial regulators and standard setting bodies to address major hurdles and pave the ways to mobilize mainstream finance to invest at scale in the transitioning (e.g., scaled investing in sustainable infrastructure, large-scale commercialization of green/clean/CCS technologies, green and resilient cities). Courtrooms are becoming the new battlefield for climate activism, with governments and corporations being targeted by a range of litigants in many jurisdictions, using myriad sources of legal duties to push for climate policy and related actions. In fact, since 2015, climate litigation has gained pace, increased in volume, expanded in scope and geographical coverage. This presentation will highlight a number of critical developments that are leading to reform in both private and public systems to enable action at scale:\n\nGlobal movement in the private and public sectors to enable access to high-quality, reliable and comparable climate risk information (i.e. physical, transition and litigation risk) from publicly-traded companies, in all sectors, through their annual reporting to inform decision-making and investing – motivated by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure’s (FSB-TCFD) recommendations.\n\nEmergence of the field of sustainable finance (e.g. EU, Canada, Australia, Singapore, etc.) to reform the mainstream financial system to enable institutional investors to invest in sustainable new business models and stems with a long-term view\n\nNew emerging financial and insurance regulatory requirements for disclosure and reporting of how companies identify, assess and manage climate change risks and opportunities;\n\nActions by international rating agencies (e.g Moody’s, Standard & Poor’, Fitch) to incorporate climate change risk and related management practices in their company, municipal and sovereign credit ratings.\n\nGrowing coalition of institutional investors that are engaging with carbon-intensive sectors, demanding action through shareholder resolutions\n\nActivities through courts using litigation as a tool to push for more ambitious climate policy and actions by governments and corporates.\n\nApril 5: Wildfires and Global Climate Change\n\nJames Randerson (University of California, Irvine)\n\n(video)\n\nBio: James Randerson studies the global carbon cycle and the role of fires in the Earth System.

She is the leader of the international ‘Climate Teams’ initiative. She is a member of the Advisory Boards for the Climate Econometrics group at Oxford and the International Emissions Trading Association ‘Markets for Natural Climate Solutions’ initiative.\n\nApril 19: How Combination and Sequence of Weather Events Shape Mexico-U.S. Migration Flows\n\nFiliz Garip (Princeton University)\n\n(video)\n\nExisting work presents mixed findings on the impact of weather events on international mobility. Relying on fine-grained data over a long time span (1980-2019) in the Mexico-U.S. setting, we turn to machine learning (ML) tools to first determine if weather events can predict migration choices of 150,000+ individuals. We use random-forest models which allow us to include a comprehensive list of weather indicators measured at various lags, and to consider complex interactions among the inputs. These models rely on data-driven model selection, optimize predictive performance, but often produce ‘black-box’ results. In our case, the results show that weather indicators offer at best a modest improvement in migration predictions. We then attempt to open the black box and model the linkages between select weather indicators and migration choices. We find the combination of precipitation and temperature extremes and their particular sequencing to be crucial to predicting weather-driven migration responses out of Mexico. We also show heterogeneity in these responses by household wealth status. Specifically, we find that wealthier households in rural communities migrate in the immediate aftermath of a negative weather shock (relative to the ‘normal’ weather in their community), while poorer households need to experience a positive weather event following a negative one in order to migrate to the United States. This pattern suggests that migration as an adaptation strategy might be available to select households in the developing world, and the most vulnerable might be excluded from resorting on an international trip unless they experience particular sequences of weather events that allow them to raise the necessary funds first.\n\nMay 3: Grounding Perspectives on Ice Loss in Antarctica\n\nBritney Schmidt (Cornell University EAS)\n\n(video)\n\nBio: Britney Schmidt’s primary interest is floating ice systems—Jupiter’s moon Europa and Earth’s ice shelves. She is interested in how these environments work and how they may become habitable. She has chosen to focus on Europa because of its potential to have what other places may not have: a stable source of energy from tides that can power geological cycles over the lifetime of the solar system. At its most basic form, life is like a battery, depending upon redox reactions to move electrons. A planetary proxy for this is activity, whereby a planet recycles through geologic processes, and maintains chemical gradients of which life can take advantage. Without recycling, it is possible that even once habitable environments can become inhospitable. This is where terrestrial process analogs come into the picture—by studying how ice and water interact in environments on Earth we can better understand the surface indications of such on Europa (and other icy worlds). Britney’s work provides a framework by which to remotely understand planetary cryospheres and test hypotheses, until such time as subsurface characterization becomes possible by radar sounding, landed seismology, or one day, roving submersibles.\n\nMuch work remains to correlate observations and models of terrestrial icy environments—excellent process analogs for the icy satellites—with planetary observations. Britney thinks about how to incorporate melting, hydrofracture, hydraulic flow, and now brine infiltration as process analogs into constructing models for the formation of Europa’s geologic terrain and to study the implications for ice shell recycling and ice-ocean interactions. The inclusion of realistic analogs in our backyard–Earth’s poles –using imaging and geophysical techniques is a common thread of this work, giving tangible ways to generate and test hypotheses relevant to environments on Earth and Europa.\n\nIn the long term, Britney envisions constructing systems-science level models of the Europan environment to understand its habitability and enable future exploration.\n\nMay 10: Estimating Vector-borne Disease Transmission in a Human-modified World\n\nCourtney Murdock (Entomology, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nClimate change will alter the distribution and intensity of transmission of vector-borne diseases, potentially increasing the probability of disease emergence and threatening the fragile gains current control programs have made in combatting these diseases. Approximately 400,000 deaths occurred due to malaria in 2018 alone, despite intense effort to control transmission over the past two decades. Additionally, currently half of the world’s population is at risk for contracting mosquito-transmitted viruses, with 390 million dengue infections per year. Further, many diseases that have recently emerged or are re-emerging globally are mosquito-borne. It has been well established that temperature has non-linear effects on vector-borne disease transmission. Thus, the effects of climate change on disease transmission will likely differ across regions. This seminar will explore the mechanisms that generate complex effects of temperature on mosquito-borne disease in the malaria and arbovirus systems and will discuss implications for transmission of these diseases in a changing climate.\n\nFebruary 4: What’s New in the UN’s Special Report on 1.5C Warming?\n\nNatalie Mahowald (Earth & Atmospheric Sciences)\n\n(video)\n\nThe recent report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that human activities have already caused 1.0C global warming, but that past emissions alone do not cause a warming of 1.5C. This report addresses the emission reductions required to keep warming below 1.5C, what the climate impacts would be of achieving 1.5 vs. 2C and what these imply for adaptation requirements. An important part of the report is evaluating the synergies and tradeoffs between clim ate mitigation, adaptation, eradication of poverty and sustainable development. Ambitious and unprecedented changes in behavior and transitions across many sectors, including energy and agriculture, are required, in addition to the research, development a nd deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies.\n\nFebruary 11: The Social Value of Mitigation Activities\n\nDrew Shindell (Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University)\n\n(video)\n\nThe Paris Agreement recognizes the “social, economic and environmental value of voluntary mitigation actions and their co-benefits for adaptation, health and sustainable development.” Yet strategies to mitigate climate change often do not explicitly consider impacts apart from climate change. A prime example is European policy to encourage use of diesel vehicles in order to mitigate climate change, which led to worsening air pollution. Another example are the scenarios developed in support of climate modeling, which choose economically optimal pathways to achieve climate targets that ignore non-climate impacts. I will discuss research to provide decision-support tools that allow multiple impacts to be assessed, focusing on climate, air quality, and agriculture, and including the economic valuation of these impacts. Results span a range from emission metrics to complex physical and socio-economic models to fit a variety of applications, examples of which will be presented. Such tools enable policy makers to “put a price on the invisible”, thereby tailoring decisions to achieve priority policy goals via regulatory or market interventions.\n\nFebruary 18: Supporting Energy Democracy with Local Carbon Offsets\n\nGay Nicholson (President, Sustainable Tompkins)\n\n(video)\n\nThe climate policy battles ahead may take quite a long time to achieve a carbon tax and a redistribution of resources to assure energy democracy. In the meantime, local communities can provide leadership toward including everyone in the transition to a clean energy economy. The Finger Lakes Climate Fund works to promote renewables and energy efficiency projects while strengthening our regional economy and assisting local families in need. Carbon offset donations are used for grants to fund energy improvements that would not otherwise be possible in low to moderate-income households in the Finger Lakes Region. These grants help pay for insulation, air sealing, solar PV, energy efficient heating and cooling, and other upgrades to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMarch 4: Climate and Land-Use Change\n\nJohanne Pelletier (Atkinson Center/TNC NatureNet Fellow, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nLand-use change, especially deforestation in the tropics, is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Net CO2 emissions from land-use change were on average equivalent to 1.5±0.7 GtC (5.3±2.6 GtCO2) during 2008-2017, accounting for about 12% of all emissions from human activity. Forests and soils also play a major role as carbon sink and reservoir. Impetus to curb deforestation has led to the mobilization of international efforts around a new mechanism under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) and increase absorptions by forests. This line of action to mitigate climate change is attractive for multiple reasons, including for the co-benefits that standing forests can provide and because these mitigation actions can have an immediate impact on our climate. Focusing mainly on three case study countries, including Panama, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, I will show that various methodological and social characteristics complicate the successful implementation of these mitigation strategies. Emission and absorption estimates from forests and land management have large uncertainty compared to other sectors of activities. This matters especially in a context where countries would receive result-based payments for reducing deforestation. Drivers of deforestation are often difficult to address and vary in space and time, and governments in developing countries do not always have the capacity and/or the interest to address those drivers. Furthermore, there are real risks for undermining the livelihoods of forest dependent people in REDD+ participating countries. Nonetheless, there are examples of countries that have been successful at reducing deforestation. Forests and land management will necessarily play an essential role in climate change mitigation for achieving the ultimate goal of the Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.\n\nMarch 11: Climate Change in Court\n\nZach Clopton (Law School, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nIn many ways, lawsuits are a poor fit for the problem of global climate change. Proving individual harms from climate change is scientifically difficult. Even if one could prove that they had been harmed by climate change, it is not obvious whom they should sue. And even if they knew whom to sue, it is not obvious what law had been broken. But in the face of a federal government seemingly uninterested in addressing climate change, those committed to action on climate have turned to courts. To do so, they have developed creative theories of legal wrongs, and often they have turned to unexpected plaintiffs to serve as the faces of those lawsuits. Cities and states in particular have taken on a leading role. This seminar will review these efforts and critically examine the role of courts and litigation in ongoing efforts to fight global climate change. It also will explore what these efforts reveal about the American system of government and its capacity to respond to pressing global problems.\n\nMarch 18: Property Taxes, Fiscal Policy, and Climate Change: Why We’re Doomed to Keep Building Where We Shouldn’t and What to Do About It\n\nLinda Shi (City and Regional Planning, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nClimate change presents a massive challenge for cities because their built assets, boundaries, revenue streams, and operating costs are fixed, while the landscape of land suitable for human settlement undergoes permanent change. Much of public discourse decries poor (even corrupt) political choices in land use planning on the one hand, and contends with the trauma of retreat or resettlement after disasters on the other. Yet, all our institutional structures – fiscal, legal, and infrastructural – are predicated on cities maximizing land value and this fundamental reality remains unchanged despite new information about climate risks. In this seminar, I’ll explain the policy context that shapes the (lack of) land use planning that accounts for natural hazards, the implications this has for cities moving forward, and how we’re seeing cities respond to these changes on the ground. The seminar invites conversation around the scale and scope of changing core structural policies to support long-term, fundamental societal adaptation.\n\nMarch 25: 20th and 21st Century Climate Change\n\nWarren Washington (National Center for Atmospheric Research)\n\nEveryone knows that climate has changed…almost everyone. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) has convinced most climate scientists that humankind is changing the earth’s climate and that significant global warming is taking place because of the burning of fossil fuels. A review of climate modeling development and underlying science will be given along with 20th and 21st century computer simulations. A major societal question is whether renewables and negative emission methods can significantly contribute to reducing future global warming.\n\nApril 8: Climate Change, Indigenous Communities, and the Imperative for Action!\n\nKarim-Aly Kassam (Department of Natural Resources & American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nIndigenous and rural societies who have contributed least to anthropogenic climate change are facing its harshest consequences and for them climate change is one of the greatest challenges. But an estimated 70-80% of the world’s food is produced by the same smallholders with less than two hectares of land. Therefore, climate variability is disrupting food systems and generating a debilitating anxiety. Consequently, anticipatory capacity–the ability to envision possible futures and develop a plan of action to deal with uncertainties–is needed urgently.\n\nApril 15: Our Changing Menu: What Climate Change Means to the Foods We Love and Need\n\nMike Hoffmann (Cornell Institute for Climate Smart Solutions, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nHuman caused climate change is upon us and the evidence is everywhere, including rising sea levels, melting glaciers, more extreme weather events, increasing temperatures, and shifting precipitation patterns. These changes are rapidly making the business of growing the foods we need and love less predictable and riskier. Staples like rice, wheat and corn are becoming less nutritious, salt water intrusion is impacting rice production in Vietnam, the transport of vast amounts of grain through the Panama Canal is becoming more challenging, and extreme weather is compromising vanilla production in Madagascar. Almost everything on our food and beverage menu is changing–some obvious and some subtle and ominous. The challenges that face our local to global food system will be discussed along with solutions, including research and educational efforts underway at Cornell University.\n\nApril 22: Building Climate Resilience for Greater US Security\n\nAlice Hill (Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University; Former Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Resilience for National Security Council)\n\n(video)\n\nClimate change affects our infrastructure, economy, public health, and national security. As we recover from extreme weather events and other climate impacts, we must ensure that the infrastructure systems we rely upon will withstand future risks. Climate related disasters can have cascading impacts on multiple sectors and systems, including our public health and economy. Climate change is a “threat multiplier” that can undermine national security. To prepare our communities and build resilience, we must develop a new paradigm that looks beyond just our past experience to determine what will keep us safe in the future.\n\nApril 29: What Is the Social Cost of Carbon?\n\nIvan Rudik (Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, Cornell University)\n\n(video)\n\nThe social cost of carbon (SCC) is the monetized global damage caused by emitting another ton of CO2. Individual estimates have ranged from negative values to hundreds or even thousands of dollars per ton of CO2. In the lecture we will cover three components of how economists calculate the SCC. First, we will broadly cover the structure of integrated assessment models, models of the climate and the economy used to compute the SCC that are linked together by an object called the “damage function.” Second, we will cover in more detail the history and challenges of estimating damages caused by climate change. Last, we will go over the discount rate and the debate about the correct discount rate to use in analysis of climate change. The discount rate translates costs and benefits accruing to future generations into today’s dollars, and is a major determinant of the value of the SCC.\n\nMay 6: Theoretical Ecology: A Century of Progress, and Challenges for the Next Century in the Face of Global Change\n\nSimon Levin (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University)\n\n(video)\n\nLevin is noted especially for his contributions to the development of the foundations of spatial ecology, for his work on pattern and scale, and more recently for his research at the interface between ecology and economics, especially problems of public goods, common pool resources, and the global commons. His book, Fragile Dominion, along with his subsequent research, weaves these themes together, invoking ecological and evolutionary theory to inform principles for management practice.\n\nJanuary 29: Introduction to the Science of Climate Change\n\nPeter Hess (Biological & Environmental Engineeri"
