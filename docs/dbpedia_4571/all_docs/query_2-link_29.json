        "meta_description": "Abstract. A series of numerical experiments were conducted to test the connection between streamflow hydrographs at the outlet of large watersheds and the time series of hillslope-scale runoff yield. We used a distributed hydrological routing model that discretizes a large watershed (â¼â17â000âkm2) into small hillslope units (â¼â0.1âkm2) and applied distinct surface runoff time series to each unit that deliver the same volume of water into the river network. The numerical simulations show that distinct runoff delivery time series at the hillslope scale result in indistinguishable streamflow hydrographs at large scales. This limitation is imposed by space-time averaging of input flows into the river network that are draining the landscape. The results of the simulations presented in this paper show that, under very general conditions of streamflow routing (i.e., nonlinear variable velocities in space and time), the streamflow hydrographs at the outlet of basins with HortonâStrahler (HâS) order 5 or above (larger than 100âkm2 in our setup) contain very little information about the temporal variability of runoff production at the hillslope scale and therefore the processes from which they originate. In addition, our results indicate that the rate of convergence to a common hydrograph shape at larger scales (above HâS order 5) is directly proportional to how different the input signals are to each other at the hillslope scale. We conclude that the ability of a hydrological model to replicate outlet hydrographs does not imply that a correct and meaningful description of small-scale rainfallârunoff processes has been provided. Furthermore, our results provide context for other studies that demonstrate how the physics of runoff generation cannot be inferred from output signals in commonly used hydrological models.",

We used classification and regression approaches to show that the sensitivity of river temperature to air temperature is variable across basins and controlled largely by geology and snowmelt. Findings can be used to inform strategies for river basin restoration and conservation, such as identifying climate-insensitive areas of the basin that should be preserved and protected.\n\nDeep learning for monthly rainfallârunoff modelling: a large-sample comparison with conceptual models across Australia\n\nStephanie R.

In this study the HYDROTEL model was calibrated in seven different experiments, incorporating the SPAEF (spatial efficiency) metric alongside Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE), with the aim of identifying the optimal calibration strategy.\n\nToward interpretable LSTM-based modeling of hydrological systems\n\nLuis Andres De la Fuente, Mohammad Reza Ehsani, Hoshin Vijai Gupta, and Laura Elizabeth Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 945–971, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) is a widely used machine-learning model in hydrology, but it is difficult to extract knowledge from it. We propose HydroLSTM, which represents processes like a hydrological reservoir. Models based on HydroLSTM perform similarly to LSTM while requiring fewer cell states. The learned parameters are informative about the dominant hydrology of a catchment. Our results show how parsimony and hydrological knowledge extraction can be achieved by using the new structure.\n\nFlow intermittence prediction using a hybrid hydrological modelling approach: influence of observed intermittence data on the training of a random forest model\n\nLouise Mimeau, Annika KÃ¼nne, Flora Branger, Sven Kralisch, Alexandre Devers, and Jean-Philippe Vidal\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 851–871, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-851-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-851-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModelling flow intermittence is essential for predicting the future evolution of drying in river networks and better understanding the ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, modelling flow intermittence is challenging, and observed data on temporary rivers are scarce. This study presents a new modelling approach for predicting flow intermittence in river networks and shows that combining different sources of observed data reduces the model uncertainty.\n\nWhat controls the tail behaviour of flood series: rainfall or runoff generation?\n\nElena Macdonald, Bruno Merz, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Viet Dung Nguyen, Xiaoxiang Guan, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 833–850, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some rivers, the occurrence of extreme flood events is more likely than in other rivers – they have heavy-tailed distributions. We find that threshold processes in the runoff generation lead to such a relatively high occurrence probability of extremes. Further, we find that beyond a certain return period, i.e. for rare events, rainfall is often the dominant control compared to runoff generation. Our results can help to improve the estimation of the occurrence probability of extreme floods.\n\nSeasonal prediction of end-of-dry-season watershed behavior in a highly interconnected alluvial watershed in northern California\n\nClaire Kouba and Thomas Harter\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 691–718, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-691-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-691-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some watersheds, the severity of the dry season has a large impact on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we design a way to predict, 5–6 months in advance, how severe the dry season will be in a rural watershed in northern California. This early warning can support seasonal adaptive management. To predict these two values, we assess data about snow, rain, groundwater, and river flows. We find that maximum snowpack and total wet season rainfall best predict dry season severity.\n\nGlaciers determine the sensitivity of hydrological processes to perturbed climate in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau\n\nYi Nan and Fuqiang Tian\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 669–689, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-669-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-669-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper utilized a tracer-aided model validated by multiple datasets in a large mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau to analyze hydrological sensitivity to climate change. The spatial pattern of the local hydrological sensitivities and the influence factors were analyzed in particular. The main finding of this paper is that the local hydrological sensitivity in mountainous basins is determined by the relationship between the glacier area ratio and the mean annual precipitation.\n\nLeveraging gauge networks and strategic discharge measurements to aid the development of continuous streamflow records\n\nMichael J. Vlah, Matthew R. V. Ross, Spencer Rhea, and Emily S. Bernhardt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 545–573, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-545-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-545-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVirtual stream gauging enables continuous streamflow estimation where a gauge might be difficult or impractical to install. We reconstructed flow at 27 gauges of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), informing ~199 site-months of missing data in the official record and improving that accuracy of official estimates at 11 sites. This study shows that machine learning, but also routine regression methods, can be used to supplement existing gauge networks and reduce monitoring costs.\n\nOn the need for physical constraints in deep learning rainfallârunoff projections under climate change: a sensitivity analysis to warming and shifts in potential evapotranspiration\n\nSungwook Wi and Scott Steinschneider\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 479–503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-479-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-479-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate whether deep learning (DL) models can produce physically plausible streamflow projections under climate change. We address this question by focusing on modeled responses to increases in temperature and potential evapotranspiration and by employing three DL and three process-based hydrological models. The results suggest that physical constraints regarding model architecture and input are necessary to promote the physical realism of DL hydrological projections under climate change.\n\nEvaluation of hydrological models on small mountainous catchments: impact of the meteorological forcings\n\nGuillaume Evin, Matthieu Le Lay, Catherine Fouchier, David Penot, Francois Colleoni, Alexandre Mas, Pierre-AndrÃ© Garambois, and Olivier Laurantin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 261–281, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-261-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological modelling of mountainous catchments is challenging for many reasons, the main one being the temporal and spatial representation of precipitation forcings. This study presents an evaluation of the hydrological modelling of 55 small mountainous catchments of the northern French Alps, focusing on the influence of the type of precipitation reanalyses used as inputs. These evaluations emphasize the added value of radar measurements, in particular for the reproduction of flood events.\n\nProjecting sediment export from two highly glacierized alpine catchments under climate change: exploring non-parametric regression as an analysis tool\n\nLena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, and Axel Bronstert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 139–161, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow suspended sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas responds to future climate change is hardly assessable as many interacting processes are involved, and appropriate physical models are lacking. We present the first study, to our knowledge, exploring machine learning to project sediment export until 2100 in two high-alpine catchments. We find that uncertainties due to methodological limitations are small until 2070. Negative trends imply that peak sediment may have already passed.\n\nA framework for parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty analysis for holistic hydrologic modeling using SWAT+\n\nSalam A. Abbas, Ryan T. Bailey, Jeremy T. White, Jeffrey G. Arnold, Michael J. White, Natalja Äerkasova, and Jungang Gao\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 21–48, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-21-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-21-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nResearch highlights.\n\n1. Implemented groundwater module (gwflow) into SWAT+ for four watersheds with different unique hydrologic features across the United States.\n\n2. Presented methods for sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation for coupled models.\n\n3.

Uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation performed using an iterative ensemble smoother within the PEST framework.\n\nOn understanding mountainous carbonate basins of the Mediterranean using parsimonious modeling solutions\n\nShima Azimi, Christian Massari, Giuseppe Formetta, Silvia Barbetta, Alberto Tazioli, Davide Fronzi, Sara Modanesi, Angelica Tarpanelli, and Riccardo Rigon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4485–4503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4485-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4485-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed the water budget of nested karst catchments using simple methods and modeling. By utilizing the available data on precipitation and discharge, we were able to determine the response lag-time by adopting new techniques. Additionally, we modeled snow cover dynamics and evapotranspiration with the use of Earth observations, providing a concise overview of the water budget for the basin and its subbasins. We have made the data, models, and workflows accessible for further study.\n\nComparing quantile regression forest and mixture density long short-term memory models for probabilistic post-processing of satellite precipitation-driven streamflow simulations\n\nYuhang Zhang, Aizhong Ye, Bita Analui, Phu Nguyen, Soroosh Sorooshian, Kuolin Hsu, and Yuxuan Wang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4529–4550, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4529-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study shows that while the quantile regression forest (QRF) and countable mixtures of asymmetric Laplacians long short-term memory (CMAL-LSTM) models demonstrate similar proficiency in multipoint probabilistic predictions, QRF excels in smaller watersheds and CMAL-LSTM in larger ones. CMAL-LSTM performs better in single-point deterministic predictions, whereas QRF model is more efficient overall.\n\nRecent ground thermo-hydrological changes in a southern Tibetan endorheic catchment and implications for lake level changes\n\nLÃ©o C. P. Martin, Sebastian Westermann, Michele Magni, Fanny Brun, Joel Fiddes, Yanbin Lei, Philip Kraaijenbrink, Tamara Mathys, Moritz Langer, Simon Allen, and Walter W. Immerzeel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4409–4436, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAcross the Tibetan Plateau, many large lakes have been changing level during the last decades as a response to climate change. In high-mountain environments, water fluxes from the land to the lakes are linked to the ground temperature of the land and to the energy fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, which are modified by climate change. With a numerical model, we test how these water and energy fluxes have changed over the last decades and how they influence the lake level variations.\n\nTowards robust seasonal streamflow forecasts in mountainous catchments: impact of calibration metric selection in hydrological modeling\n\nDiego Araya, Pablo A. Mendoza, Eduardo MuÃ±oz-Castro, and James McPhee\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4385–4408, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4385-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDynamical systems are used by many agencies worldwide to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts, which are critical for decision-making. Such systems rely on hydrology models, which contain parameters that are typically estimated using a target performance metric (i.e., objective function). This study explores the effects of this decision across mountainous basins in Chile, illustrating tradeoffs between seasonal forecast quality and the models' capability to simulate streamflow characteristics.\n\nModelling flood frequency and magnitude in a glacially conditioned, heterogeneous landscape: testing the importance of land cover and land use\n\nPamela E. Tetford and Joseph R. Desloges\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3977–3998, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3977-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn efficient regional flood frequency model relates drainage area to discharge, with a major assumption of similar basin conditions. In a landscape with variable glacial deposits and land use, we characterize varying hydrological function using 28 explanatory variables. We demonstrate that (1) a heterogeneous landscape requires objective model selection criteria to optimize the fit of flow data, and (2) incorporating land use as a predictor variable improves the drainage area to discharge model.\n\nEnhancing LSTM-based streamflow prediction with a spatially distributed approach\n\nQiutong Yu, Bryan A. Tolson, Hongren Shen, Ming Han, Juliane Mai, and Jimmy Lin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-237,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-237, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is challenging to incorporate the spatial distribution information of input variables when implementing LSTM models for streamflow prediction. This paper presents a novel hybrid modeling approach to predict streamflow while accounting for spatial variability. We evaluated the performance against lumped LSTM predictions in 224 basins across the Great Lakes region in North America. This approach shows promise in predicting streamflow at large ungauged basin.\n\nDirect integration of reservoirs' operations in a hydrological model for streamflow estimation: coupling a CLSTM model with MOHID-Land\n\nAna Ramos Oliveira, Tiago Brito Ramos, LÃ­gia Pinto, and Ramiro Neves\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3875–3893, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3875-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper intends to demonstrate the adequacy of a hybrid solution to overcome the difficulties related to the incorporation of human behavior when modeling hydrological processes. Two models were implemented, one to estimate the outflow of a reservoir and the other to simulate the hydrological processes of the watershed. With both models feeding each other, results show that the proposed approach significantly improved the streamflow estimation downstream of the reservoir.\n\nModelling the regional sensitivity of snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow generation to climate over the Canadian Prairies using a basin classification approach\n\nZhihua He, Kevin Shook, Christopher Spence, John W. Pomeroy, and Colin Whitfield\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3525–3546, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3525-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study evaluated the impacts of climate change on snowmelt, soil moisture, and streamflow over the Canadian Prairies. The entire prairie region was divided into seven basin types. We found strong variations of hydrological sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes in different land covers and basins, which suggests that different water management and adaptation methods are needed to address enhanced water stress due to expected climate change in different regions of the prairies.\n\nTo what extent does river routing matter in hydrological modeling?\n\nNicolÃ¡s CortÃ©s-Salazar, NicolÃ¡s VÃ¡squez, Naoki Mizukami, Pablo A. Mendoza, and Ximena Vargas\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3505–3524, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3505-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3505-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper shows how important river models can be for water resource applications that involve hydrological models and, in particular, parameter calibration. To this end, we conduct numerical experiments in a pilot basin using a combination of hydrologic model simulations obtained from a large sample of parameter sets and different routing methods. We find that routing can affect streamflow simulations, even at monthly time steps; the choice of parameters; and relevant streamflow metrics.\n\nCalibrating macroscale hydrological models in poorly gauged and heavily regulated basins\n\nDung Trung Vu, Thanh Duc Dang, Francesca Pianosi, and Stefano Galelli\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3485–3504, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3485-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3485-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe calibration of hydrological models over extensive spatial domains is often challenged by the lack of data on river discharge and the operations of hydraulic infrastructures. Here, we use satellite data to address the lack of data that could unintentionally bias the calibration process. Our study is underpinned by a computational framework that quantifies this bias and provides a safe approach to the calibration of models in poorly gauged and heavily regulated basins.\n\nAn advanced tool integrating failure and sensitivity analysis into novel modeling of the stormwater flood volume\n\nFrancesco Fatone, Bartosz SzelÄ g, PrzemysÅaw Kowal, Arthur McGarity, Adam Kiczko, Grzegorz WaÅek, Ewa Wojciechowska, MichaÅ Stachura, and Nicolas Caradot\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3329–3349, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3329-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3329-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA novel methodology for the development of a stormwater network performance simulator including advanced risk assessment was proposed. The applied tool enables the analysis of the influence of spatial variability in catchment and stormwater network characteristics on the relation between (SWMM) model parameters and specific flood volume, as an alternative approach to mechanistic models. The proposed method can be used at the stage of catchment model development and spatial planning management.\n\nairGRteaching: an open-source tool for teaching hydrological modeling withÂ R\n\nOlivier Delaigue, Pierre Brigode, Guillaume Thirel, and Laurent Coron\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3293–3327, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3293-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3293-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTeaching hydrological modeling is an important, but difficult, matter. It requires appropriate tools and teaching material. In this article, we present the airGRteaching package, which is an open-source software tool relying on widely used hydrological models. This tool proposes an interface and numerous hydrological modeling exercises representing a wide range of hydrological applications. We show how this tool can be applied to simple but real-life cases.\n\nStable water isotopes and tritium tracers tell the same tale: no evidence for underestimation of catchment transit times inferred by stable isotopes in StorAge Selection (SAS)-function models\n\nSiyuan Wang, Markus Hrachowitz, Gerrit Schoups, and Christine Stumpp\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3083–3114, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3083-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3083-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study shows that previously reported underestimations of water ages are most likely not due to the use of seasonally variable tracers. Rather, these underestimations can be largely attributed to the choices of model approaches which rely on assumptions not frequently met in catchment hydrology. We therefore strongly advocate avoiding the use of this model type in combination with seasonally variable tracers and instead adopting StorAge Selection (SAS)-based or comparable model formulations.\n\nUncertainty in water transit time estimation with StorAge Selection functions and tracer data interpolation\n\nArianna Borriero, Rohini Kumar, Tam V. Nguyen, Jan H. Fleckenstein, and Stefanie R. Lutz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2989–3004, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2989-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2989-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed the uncertainty of the water transit time distribution (TTD) arising from model input (interpolated tracer data) and structure (StorAge Selection, SAS, functions). We found that uncertainty was mainly associated with temporal interpolation, choice of SAS function, nonspatial interpolation, and low-flow conditions. It is important to characterize the specific uncertainty sources and their combined effects on TTD, as this has relevant implications for both water quantity and quality.\n\nChanges in Mediterranean flood processes and seasonality\n\nYves Tramblay, Patrick Arnaud, Guillaume Artigue, Michel Lang, Emmanuel Paquet, Luc Neppel, and Eric Sauquet\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2973–2987, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2973-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2973-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMediterranean floods are causing major damage, and recent studies have shown that, despite the increase in intense rainfall, there has been no increase in river floods. This study reveals that the seasonality of floods changed in the Mediterranean Basin during 1959–2021. There was also an increased frequency of floods linked to short episodes of intense rain, associated with a decrease in soil moisture. These changes need to be taken into consideration to adapt flood warning systems.\n\nA Network Approach for Multiscale Catchment Classification using Traits\n\nFabio Ciulla and Charuleka Varadharajan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1675,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1675, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen studying the behavior of rivers, like their tendency to flood, it is useful to group them using the characteristics of their surrounding areas like geology, climate, land use and human influence. We developed a method that, in addition to this classification, also returns the relevant characteristics of each group and associates them to particular behaviors. In this way we better understand how rivers interact with the environment and can try to improve the predictions of future behaviors.\n\nCan the combining of wetlands with reservoir operation reduce the risk of future floods and droughts?\n\nYanfeng Wu, Jingxuan Sun, Boting Hu, Y. Jun Xu, Alain N. Rousseau, and Guangxin Zhang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2725–2745, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2725-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2725-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReservoirs and wetlands are important regulators of watershed hydrology, which should be considered when projecting floods and droughts. We first coupled wetlands and reservoir operations into a semi-spatially-explicit hydrological model and then applied it in a case study involving a large river basin in northeast China. We found that, overall, the risk of future floods and droughts will increase further even under the combined influence of reservoirs and wetlands.\n\nAdvancing Understanding of Lake-Watershed Hydrology Through A Fully Coupled Numerical Model\n\nLele Shu, Xiaodong Li, Yan Chang, Xianhong Meng, Hao Chen, Yuan Qi, Hongwei Wang, Zhaoguo Li, and Shihua Lyu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-166,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-166, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a new model to better understand how water moves in a lake basin. Our model improves upon previous methods by accurately capturing the complexity of water movement, both on the surface and subsurface. Our model tested using data from China's Qinghai Lake, accurately replicates complex water movements and identifies contributing factors of lake's water balance. The findings provide a robust tool for predicting hydrological processes, aiding water resource planning.\n\nKnowledge-informed deep learning for hydrological model calibration: an application to Coal Creek Watershed in Colorado\n\nPeishi Jiang, Pin Shuai, Alexander Sun, Maruti K. Mudunuru, and Xingyuan Chen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2621–2644, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2621-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2621-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a novel deep learning approach to estimate the parameters of a computationally expensive hydrological model on only a few hundred realizations. Our approach leverages the knowledge obtained by data-driven analysis to guide the design of the deep learning model used for parameter estimation. We demonstrate this approach by calibrating a state-of-the-art hydrological model against streamflow and evapotranspiration observations at a snow-dominated watershed in Colorado.\n\nWhen best is the enemy of good â critical evaluation of performance criteria in hydrological models\n\nGuillaume Cinkus, Naomi Mazzilli, HervÃ© Jourde, Andreas Wunsch, Tanja Liesch, NataÅ¡a Ravbar, Zhao Chen, and Nico Goldscheider\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2397–2411, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2397-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2397-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) is a performance criterion extensively used to evaluate hydrological models. We conduct a critical study on the KGE and its variant to examine counterbalancing errors. Results show that, when assessing a simulation, concurrent over- and underestimation of discharge can lead to an overall higher criterion score without an associated increase in model relevance. We suggest that one carefully choose performance criteria and use scaling factors.\n\nThe suitability of differentiable, physics-informed machine learning hydrologic models for ungauged regions and climate change impact assessment\n\nDapeng Feng, Hylke Beck, Kathryn Lawson, and Chaopeng Shen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2357–2373, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2357-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2357-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPowerful hybrid models (called Î´ or delta models) embrace the fundamental learning capability of AI and can also explain the physical processes. Here we test their performance when applied to regions not in the training data. Î´ models rivaled the accuracy of state-of-the-art AI models under the data-dense scenario and even surpassed them for the data-sparse one. They generalize well due to the physical structure included. Î´ models could be ideal candidates for global hydrologic assessment.\n\nProducing reliable hydrologic scenarios from raw climate model outputs without resorting to meteorological observations\n\nSimon Ricard, Philippe Lucas-Picher, Antoine Thiboult, and FranÃ§ois Anctil\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2375–2395, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2375-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2375-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA simplified hydroclimatic modelling workflow is proposed to quantify the impact of climate change on water discharge without resorting to meteorological observations. Results confirm that the proposed workflow produces equivalent projections of the seasonal mean flows in comparison to a conventional hydroclimatic modelling approach. The proposed approach supports the participation of end-users in interpreting the impact of climate change on water resources.\n\nAfforestation impacts on terrestrial hydrology insignificant compared to climate change in Great Britain\n\nMarcus Edmund Henry Buechel, Louise Slater, and Simon Dadson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-138,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-138, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAfforestation has been proposed internationally, but the hydrological implications of such large increases in spatial extent of woodland are not fully understood. In this study we use a land surface model to simulate hydrology across Great Britain with realistic afforestation scenarios and potential climate changes. Countrywide afforestation minimally influences hydrology when compared to climate change, and reduces low streamflow whilst not lowering the highest flows.\n\nUsing normalised difference infrared index patterns to constrain semi-distributed rainfallârunoff models in tropical nested catchments\n\nNutchanart Sriwongsitanon, Wasana Jandang, James Williams, Thienchart Suwawong, Ekkarin Maekan, and Hubert H. G. Savenije\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2149–2171, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2149-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2149-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed predictive semi-distributed rainfall–runoff models for nested sub-catchments in the upper Ping basin, which yielded better or similar performance compared to calibrated lumped models. The normalised difference infrared index proves to be an effective proxy for distributed root zone moisture capacity over sub-catchments and is well correlated with the percentage of evergreen forest. In validation, soil moisture simulations appeared to be highly correlated with the soil wetness index.\n\nRevisiting the hydrological basis of the Budyko framework with the principle of hydrologically similar groups\n\nYuchan Chen, Xiuzhi Chen, Meimei Xue, Chuanxun Yang, Wei Zheng, Jun Cao, Wenting Yan, and Wenping Yuan\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1929–1943, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1929-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1929-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study addresses the quantification and estimation of the watershed-characteristic-related parameter (Pw) in the Budyko framework with the principle of hydrologically similar groups. The results show that Pw is closely related to soil moisture and fractional vegetation cover, and the relationship varies across specific hydrologic similarity groups. The overall satisfactory performance of the Pw estimation model improves the applicability of the Budyko framework for global runoff estimation.\n\nReconstructing five decades of sediment export from two glacierized high-alpine catchments in Tyrol, Austria, using nonparametric regression\n\nLena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, Christoph Mayer, and Axel Bronstert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1841–1863, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1841-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1841-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a suitable method to reconstruct sediment export from decadal records of hydroclimatic predictors (discharge, precipitation, temperature) and shorter suspended sediment measurements. This lets us fill the knowledge gap on how sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas has responded to climate change. We find positive trends in sediment export from the two investigated nested catchments with step-like increases around 1981 which are linked to crucial changes in glacier melt.\n\nWater and energy budgets over hydrological basins on short and long timescales\n\nSamantha Petch, Bo Dong, Tristan Quaife, Robert P. King, and Keith Haines\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1723–1744, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1723-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1723-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGravitational measurements of water storage from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) can improve understanding of the water budget. We produce flux estimates over large river catchments based on observations that close the monthly water budget and ensure consistency with GRACE on short and long timescales. We use energy data to provide additional constraints and balance the long-term energy budget. These flux estimates are important for evaluating climate models.\n\nMulti-model approach in a variable spatial framework for streamflow simulation\n\nCyril ThÃ©bault, Charles Perrin, Vazken AndrÃ©assian, Guillaume Thirel, SÃ©bastien Legrand, and Olivier Delaigue\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-569,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-569, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreamflow forecasting is useful for many applications, ranging from population safety (e.g. floods) to water resource management (e.g. agriculture or hydropower). To this end, hydrological models must be optimized. However, a model is inherently wrong. This study aims to analyse the contribution of a multi-model approach within a variable spatial framework to improve streamflow simulations. The underlying idea is to take advantage of the strength of each modelling frameworks tested.\n\nHydrological response to climate change and human activities in the Three-River Source Region\n\nTing Su, Chiyuan Miao, Qingyun Duan, Jiaojiao Gou, Xiaoying Guo, and Xi Zhao\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1477–1492, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1477-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1477-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Three-River Source Region (TRSR) plays an extremely important role in water resources security and ecological and environmental protection in China and even all of Southeast Asia. This study used the variable inï¬ltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrologic model linked with the degree-day factor algorithm to simulate the runoff change in the TRSR. These results will help to guide current and future regulation and management of water resources in the TRSR.\n\nIncorporating experimentally derived streamflow contributions into model parameterization to improve discharge prediction\n\nAndreas Hartmann, Jean-Lionel Payeur-Poirier, and Luisa Hopp\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1325–1341, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1325-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1325-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe advance our understanding of including information derived from environmental tracers into hydrological modeling. We present a simple approach that integrates streamflow observations and tracer-derived streamflow contributions for model parameter estimation. We consider multiple observed streamflow components and their variation over time to quantify the impact of their inclusion for streamflow prediction at the catchment scale.\n\nMachine-learning- and deep-learning-based streamflow prediction in a hilly catchment for future scenarios using CMIP6 GCM data\n\nDharmaveer Singh, Manu Vardhan, Rakesh Sahu, Debrupa Chatterjee, Pankaj Chauhan, and Shiyin Liu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1047–1075, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1047-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1047-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examines, for the first time, the potential of various machine learning models in streamflow prediction over the Sutlej River basin (rainfall-dominated zone) in western Himalaya during the period 2041–2070 (2050s) and 2071–2100 (2080s) and its relationship to climate variability. The mean ensemble of the model results shows that the mean annual streamflow of the Sutlej River is expected to rise between the 2050s and 2080s by 0.79 to 1.43 % for SSP585 and by 0.87 to 1.10 % for SSP245.\n\nRiver hydraulic modeling with ICESat-2 land and water surface elevation\n\nMonica Coppo Frias, Suxia Liu, Xingguo Mo, Karina Nielsen, Heidi Ranndal, Liguang Jiang, Jun Ma, and Peter Bauer-Gottwein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1011–1032, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1011-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1011-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper uses remote sensing data from ICESat-2 to calibrate a 1D hydraulic model. With the model, we can make estimations of discharge and water surface elevation, which are important indicators in flooding risk assessment. ICESat-2 data give an added value, thanks to the 0.7 m resolution, which allows the measurement of narrow river streams. In addition, ICESat-2 provides measurements on the river dry portion geometry that can be included in the model.\n\nHydrological modeling using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool in urban and peri-urban environments: the case of Kifisos experimental subbasin (Athens, Greece)\n\nEvgenia Koltsida, Nikos Mamassis, and Andreas Kallioras\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 917–931, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-917-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-917-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDaily and hourly rainfall observations were inputted to a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model to investigate the impacts of rainfall temporal resolution on a discharge simulation. Results indicated that groundwater flow parameters were more sensitive to daily time intervals, and channel routing parameters were more influential for hourly time intervals. This study suggests that the SWAT model appears to be a reliable tool to predict discharge in a mixed-land-use basin.\n\nMonetizing the role of water in sustaining watershed ecosystem services using a fully integrated subsurface–surface water model\n\nTariq Aziz, Steven K. Frey, David R. Lapen, Susan Preston, Hazen A. J. Russell, Omar Khader, Andre R. Erler, and Edward A. Sudicky\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-25,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-25, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study determines the value of water towards ecosystem services production in an agricultural watershed in Ontario, Canada. It uses a computer model and an economic valuation approach to determine how subsurface and surface water affect ecosystem services supply. The results show that subsurface water plays a critical role in maintaining ecosystem services. The study informs on the sustainable use of subsurface water and introduces a new method for managing watershed ecosystem services.\n\nTechnical note: How physically based is hydrograph separation by recursive digital filtering?\n\nKlaus Eckhardt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 495–499, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-495-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-495-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn important hydrological issue is to identify components of streamflow that react to precipitation with different degrees of attenuation and delay. From the multitude of methods that have been developed for this so-called hydrograph separation, a specific, frequently used one is singled out here. It is shown to be derived from plausible physical principles. This increases confidence in its results.\n\nA comprehensive open-source course for teaching applied hydrological modelling in Central Asia\n\nBeatrice Sabine Marti, Aidar Zhumabaev, and Tobias Siegfried\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 319–330, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-319-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-319-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerical modelling is often used for climate impact studies in water resources management. It is, however, not yet highly accessible to many students of hydrology in Central Asia. One big hurdle for new learners is the preparation of relevant data prior to the actual modelling. We present a robust, open-source workflow and comprehensive teaching material that can be used by teachers and by students for self study.\n\nImpact of distributed meteorological forcing on simulated snow cover and hydrological fluxes over a mid-elevation alpine micro-scale catchment\n\nAniket Gupta, Alix Reverdy, Jean-Martial Cohard, Basile Hector, Marc Descloitres, Jean-Pierre Vandervaere, Catherine Coulaud, Romain Biron, Lucie Liger, Reed Maxwell, Jean-Gabriel Valay, and Didier Voisin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 191–212, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-191-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-191-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPatchy snow cover during spring impacts mountainous ecosystems on a large range of spatio-temporal scales. A hydrological model simulated such snow patchiness at 10 m resolution. Slope and orientation controls precipitation, radiation, and wind generate differences in snowmelt, subsurface storage, streamflow, and evapotranspiration. The snow patchiness increases the duration of the snowmelt to stream and subsurface storage, which sustains the plants and streamflow later in the summer.\n\nCited articles\n\nAhmed, M.
