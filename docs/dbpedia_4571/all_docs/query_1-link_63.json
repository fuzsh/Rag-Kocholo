        "text": "Engineering an Orange Legacy\n\nAndrew ‘25 and John ‘27 Vanderwege come from a family that bleeds Orange. Not only have several relatives attended Syracuse University, but their parents, Maureen ‘97 and Mike ‘96, are graduates of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. The University also happens to be the place where their parents would meet for the first time.\n\n“We were floor mates the second half of my junior year at DellPlain Hall. Maureen and my roommate, who was also a sophomore engineering major at the time, knew each other,” their father, Mike recalls. “We only met at the end of the year. Our hometowns are only 20 minutes apart and we got to know each other that summer.”\n\nGrowing up, Andrew and John loved watching SU sports with their parents and frequently visited campus to attend home games at the Dome. So, when it came time to choose colleges to apply to, Syracuse was an easy choice. “[My parents] played a big role in my decision since both of them went to Syracuse and both studied engineering,” says John. “I also felt at home whenever I would visit the campus or go to a basketball or football game.”\n\nBoth Andrew and John are pursuing degrees in environmental engineering, with Andrew’s interest lying in climate change. He’s also a member of the Combustion and Energy Research (COMER) Laboratory and interning with the sustainable engineering company Ramboll as part of a soil remediation group for the summer. “I knew that I wanted to go into engineering and climate change has always been something that interested me,” says Andrew. “Environmental engineering seemed to give me the best chance at making a positive impact on the climate.”\n\nJohn’s research interests include carbon capture, storage technology, and ocean acidification, areas he’s been able to explore through the civil and environmental engineering department’s comprehensive programs. He’s also considering other potential areas of study such as chemical engineering. “I wanted to do engineering since I enjoy hands-on activities as well as the math and science aspect of it,” says John. “I took an AP environmental class in high school which I enjoyed and made me realize that there are many different areas of the environment that can be studied.”\n\nThe two brothers’ passion for the environment goes beyond the classroom and they enjoy staying active as much as they love the outdoors. In their free time, the boys compete in Syracuse intramural sports like soccer and basketball and spend time hiking, biking, and backpacking. Since high school, John has also enjoyed playing ultimate frisbee and found Syracuse’s “Doom Ultimate Frisbee Club” the perfect place to get active and meet new people. “My favorite thing about Syracuse University is the opportunities available and the different majors on campus. It leads to the student body being comprised of people from all over and I really enjoy meeting others” says Andrew.\n\nMike and Maureen’s trips to Syracuse for sporting events and visiting their sons take them back to a time when they were students attending the University. “I remember falling in love with the campus and feeling a sense of belonging when I stepped foot on the Quad,” says Maureen.\n\n“The campus is very much the same, and that’s a good thing. It feels like home,” says Mike.\n\nMaureen, who currently works for her local school district as the Central Treasurer, received her bachelor’s in civil engineering and reflected on her experiences founding the Syracuse University chapter of Alpha Omega Epsilon, a professional and social sorority for women interested in STEM. “The experience of starting a chapter was difficult but rewarding and I’m so happy to see that the Zeta chapter is flourishing.”\n\nOne of her favorite things about Syracuse was the smaller, personalized classes in ECS. “I got to know our professors and classmates well. My first-year ECS class for undecided engineers was with Dr. [Samuel] Clemence. He showed us an airport in Osaka Bay that was built on an artificial island, and I was instantly hooked on civil engineering.”\n\nMike, who received his bachelor’s in mechanical engineering, works as a Senior Manager of Mechanical Engineering for L3Harris. He loved that Syracuse University had a wide variety of programs and opportunities outside of engineering. He initially leaned towards aerospace, then civil but eventually chose mechanical engineering as his major.\n\n“Realizing aerospace engineering may have a limited job market in western NY, combined with my enjoyment of the Mechanics of Materials class, I declared as a civil engineer after my sophomore year,” he says. “However, I had a mechanical engineering internship that summer in a manufacturing plant and I enjoyed the work they gave me along with the manufacturing culture. I therefore switched to mechanical engineering upon return to school at the start of my junior year.”\n\nThe parents couldn’t be more proud of their sons as they embark on the college experience and fully immerse themselves into Syracuse’s campus community. Keeping up with their traditions of attending SU sports games, they truly showcase a family united by their Orange pride.\n\n“I could fill pages and pages with memories and stories of my time at SU,” Mike says. “Picking a favorite would be difficult. I will share this more recent memory…We were at a football game, with Andrew and John in the student section and Maureen and I in the upper level above them. Watching them cheer on the Orange, combined with knowing they are in the classrooms of Link, walking the Quad, going to Marshall Street, and experiencing all that is SU… it brought my love for the university to an indescribably higher level.”\n\nInterdisciplinary Engineering Group Designs Smart Water Box for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s P3 Program\n\nCivil and environmental engineering professor Svetoslava Todorova, retired electrical engineering and computer science professor, William Tetley and engineering students David Coghiel ‘24 (civil engineering), Elliot Salas ‘24 (electrical engineering) and Jasmine Rodriguez ‘25 (mechanical engineering) participated in the TechConnect World Innovation Conference and Expo in Washington, DC from June 17-19. The group was a recipient of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) competitive program grant.\n\nThe EPA’s P3 program is a competition where undergraduate/graduate student teams design sustainable solutions to real-world environmental challenges. Todorova, Tetley, Coghiel, Salas and Rodriguez showcased their Smart Water Box, a low-cost sensor unit designed to monitor water quality in small rivers, in a 90-second sales pitch and answered questions in a booth where they displayed their sensor unit.\n\n“The TechConnect World Innovation Expo was a great opportunity that I utilized to network with other student researchers, government agencies, and private companies,” says Rodriguez. “As one of the few student attendees, it was easy to stand out and make better connections with the professionals I interacted with. The P3 National Student Design Competition also gave me valuable insight into what other universities are researching and what issues are at the forefront of people’s concerns when it comes to our environment.”\n\n“Our project stood out as a cost-effective, low-maintenance, solar-powered alternative to traditional water quality monitoring systems. I assisted with the development of the unit and fieldwork to ensure its continuous operation,” says Coghiel. “I was able to connect with different universities and companies to share experiences, knowledge, and accomplishments. Furthermore, introducing our project in an elevator pitch and a booth in the conference hall gave us valuable presentation experience that is bound to help us in our careers.”\n\nP3 has a two-phase program where teams receive $25,000 for a one-year award. The expo concluded phase 1 of the EPA P3 award cycle and the group will compete for the second round of funding in phase 2 during the fall.\n\n“The experience of presenting our project to other schools and EPA representatives was incredibly rewarding,” says Salas. “I was also thrilled to support my team and celebrate their achievements, like David’s impressive elevator pitch and Jasmine’s unique 3D prints, which are integral to our project. While I served a significant role in this project, I must acknowledge the collective effort of our group and the guidance of our mentors, Svetla and William. The time spent in DC was enjoyable and inspiring, and I eagerly anticipate the future improvements our group will make to the water quality monitoring box.”\n\n“Although we discuss the need of using a multifaceted approach in solving contemporary issues, at college level students are often taught in silos. This design project stimulated interdisciplinary collaboration and creativity by bringing together students from three different engineering departments,” says Todorova. “I am extremely proud of their motivation, team spirit, and drive for success. The team stood out with their 90-seconds sales pitch. Everyone came to congratulate us. We are thankful to Linda Hartsock, Strategic Advisor at SU Libraries, for her invaluable guidance and tips in developing a strong sales pitch.”\n\nLance S.

This collaborative project will focus on communities in Puerto Rico, with the ultimate goal being to use this case study as a framework that can be replicated in other U.S. locations and beyond. The project officially kicked off in February 2024.\n\nAccess to clean drinking water is a right for all that is threatened by the looming climate crisis. In 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water; and 2 billion people lacked a basic hand washing facility, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMany of those without access are communities of less than 10,000 people who face their own unique obstacles. In Puerto Rico, challenges for these small communities include limited economic resources and severe natural disaster risk, which is amplified by climate change. Unless viable and proactive solutions are developed, this lack of access will prevail.\n\nThis $650,000 research project, named VersaWater by its team, is funded by the NSF Convergence Accelerator Program and led by Cornell University in partnership with CSCS; Interamerican University of Puerto Rico’s Center for Environmental Education, Conservation and Research; and AguaClara Reach.\n\nThrough the Convergence Accelerator Program, the water research team will use a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to accelerate the science and community engagement practices around Puerto Rico’s safe drinking water technology using three convergent focus areas: governance and financing, community education and workforce training, and resilient water system technologies.\n\n“The Center for Sustainable Community Solutions (CSCS), which operates the Environmental Finance Center (EFC), has been a leader in environmental finance for over 30 years,” shared CSCS Director and the water project’s Co-Principal Investigator Melissa Young. “Ensuring that funding is not only available for investments like this but that it is also accessible is crucial to making everlasting change for the health and welfare of small communities.”\n\nShe continued, “We’re proud to be a part of the esteemed NSF Convergence Accelerator Program, which importantly prioritizes community-focused research and social impact.”\n\nCSCS aims to identify how small communities can better access federal funding made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) — a law that authorized billions of dollars for federal investment, including significant financial support for water infrastructure in small communities — and the barriers they experience in doing so. CSCS leverages over three decades of community-based work in EPA Region 2 (which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and eight Native Nations.)\n\nCornell Engineering is leading VersaWater (formerly called WaterSAVerS), bolstered by its ties to the non-profit AguaClara Reach, who have together been developing open-source sustainable water treatment technologies specifically for small and very small communities in the Global South over the past 20 years, according to Ruth Richardson, the water project’s Principal Investigator representing Cornell.\n\n“The AguaClara technology aims to create gravity-powered water treatment plants specifically for small and very small communities. Innovations in automated dosing, water movement, and hydraulics create treatment plants that ease operation and maintenance demands since labor is a major cost for [these communities],” Richardson said.\n\nWhat’s ahead\n\nCSCS and team are currently in Phase 1 of the NSF Convergence Accelerator Program. Over the course of nine months, the water team will develop their initial idea into a proof of concept, identify new team members and partners, and participate in the NSF Convergence Accelerator’s Phase 1 innovation curriculum, which provides fundamentals in human-centered design; team science; use-inspired research; early-stage prototyping; and communications, storytelling, and pitching.\n\nAt the end of Phase 1, the water team will participate in a competitive formal NSF pitch and proposal process, which is used in selecting teams for Phase 2. Teams selected for Phase 2 will continue accelerating their solutions toward impact. By the end of the Convergence Research phases, solutions are expected to impact societal needs at scale and be sustainable beyond NSF support.\n\nThe Center for Sustainable Community Solutions (CSCS) at Syracuse University\n\nCSCS is a nonprofit organization working at the intersection of sustainability communications, policy, and science to foster economic well-being, environmental stewardship, and social equity by engaging community members at all levels to provide the coordination and knowledge needed to make informed decisions that\n\nsupport sustainability, resiliency, and climate adaptation. The Syracuse University Environmental Finance Center (EFC), operated by CSCS, is a pillar in this mission that facilitates the development of sustainable and resilient communities throughout US EPA Region 2 (New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and eight Native Nations) and nationally.\n\nU.S. National Science Foundation\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that promotes the progress of science by investing in research to expand knowledge in science, engineering, and education across all 50 states and territories. NSF supports nearly 2,000 colleges, universities, and other institutions through competitive grants aimed at advancing science with broad impacts across the nation and its people.

The paper was written by graduate student Lucie Worthen G’19 along with Assistant Professors Christa Kelleher from the College of Arts and Sciences and Cliff Davidson from the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS). The award is nominated and selected by the Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) editorial board.\n\nThe research group was awarded for their work on “A Diagnostic Analysis of Low-Impact Development Simulations with Stormwater Management Model (SWMM).” The paper compares the results of the SWMM of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with measurements of stormwater runoff from the green roof of the Nick Pirro Convention Center owned by Onondaga County.\n\nWorthen, Kelleher, and Davidson will be recognized at the 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Convention during the awards and lectures presentation.\n\nThe Road to Sustainable Infrastructure\n\nAs the construction industry faces challenges in infrastructure maintenance, Syracuse University has established the Infrastructure Institute to develop new approaches to address these issues. Under the leadership of Min Liu, the institute strives to develop talent, conduct research, and educate the public to ensure a sustainable, collaborative future in infrastructure.\n\n“The biggest issues we see right now are public safety, the environmental impact of infrastructure, and a long-term shortage of skilled laborers,” says Liu. “My vision for this institute is to build a platform to facilitate different people from different sections to work together.”\n\nLiu earned her Ph.D. in engineering project management from the University of California, Berkeley in 2007. She then worked as an assistant and later associate professor at North Carolina State University until 2022. During her tenure, she conducted research on construction engineering and management, collected large amounts of empirical data, and used modeling programming to analyze the data and improve productivity.\n\nAdditionally, Liu worked with the North Carolina Department of Transportation and the Construction Industry Institute. She also became Chair of the ASCE Construction Research Council from 2020 to 2021. In 2022, Liu joined Syracuse University as the Abdallah H. Yabroudi Endowed Professor in Sustainable Civil Infrastructure and the director of the Infrastructure Institute, bringing years of experience to her respective roles.\n\nThe Infrastructure Institute is developing academic programs, research opportunities, and internships for students and educational programs for public officials and professionals. The institute also collaborates with a wide range of professionals, including information technology experts, data analysts, architects, environmental design professionals, journalists, and business professionals.\n\nMin’s goal is to create a platform that consists of three main pillars: the public, private, and student and faculty sectors. Since building infrastructure requires funding from the government, the union labor association serves as the workforce to construct infrastructure, and students are the future of the industry, collaboration between these three sectors is integral for the success of the institute.\n\n“Public authorities provide the direction and funding for infrastructure. Universities and faculty provide education to students. Students will then become the fresh blood for the public authorities and construction industry. These three sectors are crucial and it’s important they work together.”\n\nLiu has organized various events to integrate the different disciplines within the institute. They held a reception attended by nine different departments and centers at the University. During the event, lightning talks were hosted, and attendees discussed their vision for the future and ongoing research. This event also provided an opportunity for people to socialize and get to know each other.\n\n“With the support of the Office of Research and collaborating with the School of Architecture, the institute developed a request for proposal to encourage and facilitate collaboration across the SU campus to improve infrastructure policy and delivery based on the I-81 project,” says Liu.\n\nLiu has also taught a capstone course that included various students across the college with the goal of helping them prepare for their roles in infrastructure project management and delivery.\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Students Participate in Sustainable Solutions and Steel Bridge Competition\n\nFour civil and environmental engineering students in the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) won first place in the regional American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Sustainable Solutions Competition. The competition took place at the Upstate New York-Canada ASCE Student Symposium at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in mid-April, and the team consisted of Emma Liptrap ’24, Ananya Chandra ’24, Sam Livingston ’24, and Caitlin Spillane ’24. Liptrap served as team captain.\n\nThe ASCE competition challenges students to understand and implement sustainable solutions and the primary goal of the team’s project was to reinvigorate a fictional city’s waterfront. They designed a community center, a mixed-use development, a commercial area, and a waterfront park with pedestrian pathways and a bus loop with accessibility throughout the site. The waterfront’s innovative design also utilized green infrastructure to manage stormwater and mitigate flooding. The design exceeds the “Superior” level of the Institute of Sustainable Infrastructure’s ENVISION framework.\n\nAdditionally, a group of seven civil and environmental engineering students participated in the Student Steel Bridge Competition at RPI and the student team consisted of Patrick Alberga ‘25, Henry Bievenue ‘24, Henry Long ‘25, Sumit Mistry ‘24, Maxwell Pozar ‘25, Aaron Shinn ‘25 and Arturo Venegas ‘25. Shinn served as team captain.\n\nThe Steel Bridge Competition challenges students to create a scaled-model steel bridge. The team designed, fabricated, and constructed a 150 lb. and 21-foot-long steel bridge in segments and assembled the segments into a fully functional bridge within a time limit. The bridge was then subjected to various geometry and loading tests during the competition.\n\nThe Sustainable Solutions team has received an official invitation to compete at the 2024 ASCE Student Championships at Brigham Young University in June and is preparing for the national competition.\n\nProfessor Shobha K. Bhatia Receives Chancellor’s Citation for Excellence Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nThe College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) is proud to announce Professor Shobha K. Bhatia as the recipient of the Chancellor’s Citation for Excellence Lifetime Achievement Award. From research and teaching to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, her outstanding contributions have made her a leading figure within her fields of study and ECS. As Bhatia prepares to retire, she leaves a legacy of inclusion, empowerment and environmental justice, inspiring hundreds of students and colleagues to do the same.\n\n“The Chancellor’s Award means a lot. The greatest honor is that my colleagues took time to nominate me,” says Bhatia. “My students [at Syracuse] and colleagues from around the country and abroad wrote beautiful letters. I’m thrilled to receive this award.”\n\nBhatia completed both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in civil engineering at IIT Roorkee, India in 1971 and 1973. She went on to earn her Ph.D. as a Commonwealth Scholar at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver in 1980. While searching for a job, she initially didn’t consider the College of Engineering and Computer Science as an option. However, when her husband, Tej Bhatia, became a faculty member at Syracuse University’s Languages, Literatures and Linguistics (LLL) Department, she decided to join him.\n\nAside from the chilly weather, Bhatia wasn’t sure what to expect when she first arrived at Syracuse University. She was the only female faculty member in ECS at the time and the only full female professor in the engineering college until 2008. This experience defined her approach to supporting colleagues and students.\n\n“Syracuse University made me feel like this was my university, my work – my voice meant something. I want to give the same feeling to my students – it’s their university, their department, their lab.”\n\nInfusing environmental justice and sustainability in her research goals, Bhatia is an influential figure in geotechnical engineering. Her research on geotextile tubes has critical applications in containment systems and filters. She also developed the Bubble Point technique, which more accurately evaluates geotextile filters used in roads and landfills. The American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) recognized the increased efficiency and accuracy of the Bubble Point technique and has adopted it as a standard test method.\n\nBhatia has published over 150 articles and book chapters covering topics that range from soil materials and erosion control to road and building construction and the protection of water quality. She has taught many courses at Syracuse University, as well as guest lectures and seminars in the United States, Mexico, India, Singapore, and the United Kingdom among others. Bhatia also served as a consultant with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station on the dynamic analysis of the 340-foot-high Folson dam.\n\nIn addition to her impactful research and contributions, Bhatia has been instrumental in creating programs to support undergraduate students in their academics within the University. As co-director of Women in Science & Engineering (WiSE), she developed a learning community designed for first-year women in STEM. She has worked with the WiSE leadership team to establish the WiSE Future Professoriate Program for graduate students and the WiSE undergraduate Women of Color Career Preparation Program (WWoC), both of which provide support for women pursuing STEM degrees.\n\nWhen reflecting on her work, Bhatia does not focus on what she has given to the University, but rather on what Syracuse University has given to her. “When I think about the times, I was the happiest working, it was with my students and colleagues. Working with them has always been a highlight. The Syracuse community has been wonderful, and I’ve been able to make lifelong friends.”\n\nBhatia has also received the 2024 USUCGER Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Award for her efforts toward improving DEI initiatives in geotechnical engineering and the 2025 Robert M. Koerner Award for her contributions to the geosynthetics industry.\n\nShe will continue her work at Syracuse University as a research faculty member for two additional years, working on several collaborative research projects in the U.S. and India. ECS will not be the same after Bhatia’s retirement, but her legacy of collaboration, innovation, and revolutionary research will benefit the university for years to come.\n\n“People have been asking me how I feel but I’ve never retired before, so I don’t know what I feel. It’s a new experience for me,” Bhatia says. “It’s an interesting time for me to reflect because we don’t often take time to reflect…When I think about my accomplishments, it’s not about the number of papers I’ve published. It’s the people I’ve worked with and what we’ve been able to accomplish together.”\n\nLifelong Learning: Paul Ossenbruggen ‘63\n\nWhen it comes to lifelong learning, there’s no better example than Paul Ossenbruggen ‘63. With several decades of experience as a professor, and an engineering career spanning over 40 years, he continues to publish new research papers to this day. However, the journey towards settling into his teaching role took some time. With so many different things he enjoyed learning, it made choosing a specific career difficult.\n\n“I never seem to settle in anything. Some people got involved with one thing and that’s what they do,” he says. “That’s not me – I jump around from one thing to the next.”\n\nGraduating from Brooklyn Tech High School in 1959, Ossenbruggen was uncertain about his career path. Though he began studying civil engineering at Syracuse University, he remained open to exploring other options. At one point, he even considered becoming an airline pilot. It was only during his internship at an energy technology company, Babcock and Wilcox, that he finally discovered his passion for nuclear engineering.\n\n“Babcock and Wilcox make huge boilers,” he says. “Even though I was a civil engineering student, I was getting more involved with nuclear engineering. It was challenging but interesting and I loved every second of it.”\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate studies at Syracuse in 1963, he continued pursuing his interest in nuclear engineering when working at General Dynamics Electric Boat, where he helped build nuclear submarines. Yet, a part of him wanted to continue learning and exploring other options.\n\n“I loved my job at Electric Boat. They designed and constructed the first nuclear-powered submarine, the U.S.S. Nautilus,” he says. “But I felt there was so much more I wanted to learn so I decided to go to grad school at the University of Connecticut in 1967 and later Carnegie Mellon University for my Ph.D. in 1970. I like learning new things.”\n\nInitially planning to return to Electric Boat, Ossenbruggen became interested in higher education and decided to pursue teaching instead. He began teaching at Northeastern University in Boston, and later in 1975, he moved to the University of New Hampshire where he taught for 34 years. He also taught at the University of California, Berkeley from 2000-2003.\n\nTeaching not only allowed him to mentor and guide students but also explore new engineering concepts, which he found fulfilling. During his tenure as a professor, he also wrote a textbook in 1984 titled “Systems Analysis for Civil Engineers.” The book combined the fundamentals of engineering economics and civil engineering systems and garnered critical acclaim at the time of its publication. It was also translated into Chinese.\n\n“It was a cutting-edge book. Civil engineers didn’t usually write this kind of textbook,” he says. “And one of the great things about it is that it’s still being read to this day.”\n\nNowadays, Ossenbruggen has settled down, returning to Syracuse where he sees a bright future for the University and the city. He’s been particularly excited about Micron’s plans to invest an estimated $100 billion into Central New York as well as the community grid in downtown Syracuse.\n\n“I’m excited to be in Syracuse now to see this transformation happen. Micron is going make a big difference,” he says. “I’ve been to every meeting, and it looks promising to me. This area turned into a rust belt but hopefully, it’ll become stainless steel.”\n\nOssenbruggen also looks forward to the Operations Research and System Analytics Master’s Program, which he believes will bring immersive learning to the college’s forefront and fuel students’ passion for learning and discovery.\n\n“I’ve been interested in operations research since I was a grad student at Carnegie Mellon. It had just got off the ground when I was completing my Ph.D. I even proposed a similar course while I was at the University of New Hampshire.\n\n“I’m glad ECS is committed to introducing this program. It’s interdisciplinary, which I like very much. The course selection is great and offers a nice variety of courses that can be tailored to meet a student’s interests. Syracuse University is in a great position.”\n\nCivil and Environmental Students Apply Science to Litigation in Mock Trial Exercise\n\nIn December 2023, students in Professor Svetoslava Todorova’s course CEE 341 “Introduction to Environmental Engineering” served as expert witnesses and lawyers in a mock trial. In this simulated trial, they learned the importance of scientific accuracy and engineering judgment in litigation practice.\n\nUsing real data from a contamination case in Europe, students were split into three groups representing different companies accused by the city of contaminating its groundwater pumping wells. For three weeks, they worked with their groups to analyze chemical and hydrological data, considered toxicological exposure, and government regulations to provide their engineering interpretation of the issue to their fictional company’s CEO.\n\n“Our group worked hard over the weeks leading up to the trial and were trying to look at all possible directions that the trial could go. We chose two of our witnesses to be expert witnesses in the fields of groundwater flow and toxicology, with our last witness being an employee from another company,” says civil engineering student Kana Wong ‘25.\n\nAfter weeks of preparation, students from CEE 341 and students from ECS 101 “Introduction to Engineering,” taught by civil and environmental engineering professor, Peter Plumley, came together in the School of Law’s courtroom. CEE 341 students served as legal professionals and witnesses and the ECS 101 students served as the jury. A legal professional from the local community also served as the judge while Plumley served as the court bailiff.\n\n“The concept of upper-division students role-playing as legal professionals and witnesses and entry-level students as jurors adds a great dimension to the student learning experience. Professor Todorova’s [project] effectively recreates the atmosphere and components of a real-world civil trial,” says Plumley.\n\n“From the lawyers who smiled coyly after nailing a speech or debate with their witnesses, to being yelled at by the other passionate jurors when voting, it made me truly feel like I was in a political court case. I was a little worried I wouldn’t be able to interpret any of the law terms, but after the first trial I sat through, being the foreperson in the second trial was a breeze,” says environmental engineering student Natahlia Hammond ‘27.\n\nPlumley and the judge kept track of time during all legal proceedings, which included opening statements, questioning witnesses, cross-examining opposing witnesses, and closing statements.\n\n“I served as the expert witness employed by my company to show our findings. I was questioned by my company’s lawyers and cross-examined by [opposing counsel]. The roles we played were done in the hopes that we could [shift the focus onto] the other companies rather than the one we were chosen to represent,” says environmental engineering student Emma Crandall ‘25.\n\n“As one of the lawyers from my group, it was important to have a good grasp of all of my company’s data and what may play to our strengths and weaknesses in our defense, but to also know how the procedures worked overall when cross-examining witnesses,” says civil engineering student Noah Ialongo ‘25.\n\n“As the faculty member providing the jurors, I especially appreciate that the outcome of each trial depends so much on the defense and delivery of the expert witnesses and the cross-examination by the associated company attorneys,” says Plumley. “Svetla and I are also particularly thankful for the School of Law for allowing our engineering students to experience the inner workings of a courtroom.”\n\n“It was absolutely captivating to see how junior engineering students applied the knowledge they gained in class, managed to build a defense plan, and utilized expert witnesses, detailed maps, and cross-examination to defend and deflect the prosecution,” says Todorova. “Developing a solid scientific argument in support of, or against the presented evidence is critical.”\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Staff Spotlight: Weisi Liu\n\nName: Weisi Liu\n\nTitle: Budget Manger\n\nTell us about your role at ECS:\n\nI oversee all budget and financial operations and provide financial guidance to ensure the financial stability and smooth functioning of the department. Work closely with faculty and staff on the grants proposal and awards management.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of working here at ECS?\n\nWorking with a team of diverse backgrounds and innovative minds. By providing support, guidance and leadership regarding all budget and financial aspects to the faculty and students, I am happy to see they obtain more research funding and exceptional educational experience.\n\nStudents Witness International Environmental Policy Negotiations at Minamata Convention on Mercury\n\nFrom October 28 to November 4, 2023, 11 students accompanied by civil and environmental engineering professor, Svetoslava Todorova, attended the 5th Conference of the Parties (COP5) of the Minamata Convention on Mercury held in Geneva, Switzerland. This trip was part of the Role of Science in Environmental Governance course where students explored how scientific, political, social, and economic views shape environmental policy.\n\nAt the conference, students observed delegates discussing the environmental impact of mercury pollution, which has become a public health issue due to its harmful effects on the nervous, digestive, and immune systems and lack of biodegradability. Participation in these ongoing negotiations helped students understand the complexity of reaching international agreements.\n\n“No matter the preparations made in the classroom and on our own, being an observer at COP5 showed me that there is no replacement for experiencing the negotiations firsthand. It was interesting to see how many moving pieces go into these conventions, and increased my appreciation for the work they do and what they can accomplish,” says environmental engineering student Brady Hartnett ’24.\n\nThe students witnessed several key decisions being made, including the establishment of new timelines for phasing out products containing mercury, recognizing the disproportional impact of mercury pollution on Indigenous communities in the Arctic and Amazon regions, and coming to an agreement on the threshold for mercury waste.\n\n“I think one of the most challenging aspects of the COP-5 negotiations was getting all the countries to agree on particular topics. This became evident when the threshold for the mercury levels in waste was being discussed. It took the delegations seven years to finally agree on this threshold. I am very glad that I had the privilege of witnessing this history being made,” says civil engineering student Caitlin Spillane ’24.\n\nStudents also had the opportunity to meet with delegates, non-government officials, and UNEP representatives from several different countries.\n\n“We had a networking opportunity with Ken Davis, a former Peace Corps Volunteer and EPA employee who works for UNEP, as part of the Minamata Secretariat,” says environmental engineering student Ananya Chandra ’24. “He gave valuable insights about the importance of international negotiations, the mechanisms of the Minamata Convention, and his career path.”\n\nTodorova and her students also visited CERN, one of the world’s largest centers for scientific research on fundamental particle physics, and received a special in-depth tour of the particle accelerator. This was made possible by Syracuse University professor Marina Artuso and Bolek Pietrzyk from CERN.\n\n“It was so interesting to be touring places that not only hold global significance but are places that people work every day,” says civil engineering student Julia Johnson-Milstein ’25. “Walking through those hallways, I knew that I was passing some of the brightest minds in the world.”\n\nOn their final day in Switzerland, they visited a cheese and chocolate factory, ending their memorable trip with a fun tour.\n\n“The trees and villages I saw on the bus to the factories are the same trees and villages that are impacted by environmental regulations that are decided on in rooms much like those I sat in. It was watching the mountains protect the nature underneath that showed me how important the work of the last week was, and I will be forever grateful for this experience,” says psychology student Gary Shteyman ’26.\n\nWhen Todorova and her students returned to Syracuse, the class held their own intergovernmental negotiations. Acting as delegates representing different countries and regions, they developed a new mercury treaty.\n\n“This is experience-based learning at its best because it trains students by immersing them into an authentic situation,” Todorova says. “It was also rewarding to see them apply the negotiation techniques we discussed in class as well as to replicate the dynamics they observed during the real convention.”\n\nHumanitarian Work in Water Systems\n\nFrom the drylands of Kenya to the rainforests of Suriname, civil and environmental engineering professor John Trimmer has dedicated his career to making a difference. After a service-learning trip to Nicaragua, where he helped with construction projects, Trimmer was inspired to pursue humanitarian engineering and improve the well-being of others. With a core research focus on water systems, sanitation, and resource recovery, he strives to promote sustainable living.\n\nAs an undergraduate at Bucknell University, Trimmer was able to work with a few non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In addition to his trip to Nicaragua, he collaborated with a Peace Corps volunteer in Suriname, South America, stationed in a remote village and working on a rainwater collection system. After graduation, Trimmer continued working with the Peace Corps and spent three years in Uganda working with an NGO that specialized in constructing water tanks, latrines, classrooms, and other structures.\n\nAfter completing his Ph.D., which included working in Uganda on innovative approaches to sanitation systems, Trimmer joined the Aquaya Institute on their mission to improve global health through safe water and sanitation access. His work at the Aquaya Institute largely focused on research and he found himself based in Nairobi, Kenya, interacting with pastoral communities in dry regions of the country.\n\n“Though the communities were nomadic, it seemed like they were also looking to settle, and they were open to permanent infrastructure,” Trimmer says. “It was very qualitative. We focused primarily on asking questions regarding their current water systems and what they do for sanitation. We also did interviews and discussion groups to understand what these communities wanted and needed.”\n\nWhile working with the Aquaya Institute, Trimmer also researched the effectiveness of a program that aimed to provide more durable infrastructure to vulnerable households in northern Ghana. Since unstable soil is an issue that impacts certain areas, they wanted to ensure the structures they built would last.\n\n“If you dig a traditional pit latrine, it may collapse because the soil is unstable. Since the locals in the area didn’t have the means for a more durable structure, we were looking at different ways those systems could be supported financially,” Trimmer explained. “UNICEF funded the project so durable structures could be installed.”\n\nAs Trimmer has traveled to different countries, he’s loved working with young researchers and found it rewarding to help them develop their skills and witness their growth. This passion for mentoring younger researchers would translate to his position as a Syracuse University professor, giving him a chance to continue guiding and supporting students.\n\nWhile teaching courses at the University, Trimmer plans to collaborate with NGOs he’s previously worked with on upcoming projects. He hopes to collaborate with colleagues to develop a platform that models sanitation systems to implement them as a teaching and research tool in the classroom. This will enable him to share the knowledge he’s gained from his humanitarian work and educate future researchers to do the same.\n\nYizhi Liu\n\nDegrees:\n\nPhD Architectural Engineering, Penn State University\n\nMS Robotics, Columbia University\n\nMS Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Penn State University\n\nMS Construction Engineering & Management, University of Michigan\n\nBS Construction Management, Tianjin University\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nConstruction robotics;\n\nHuman-robot interaction;\n\nRobotic teleoperations;\n\nRobot path planning;\n\nComputer vision and machine learning algorithms for seamless human-robot collaboration;\n\nPhysiological sensing for workers’ health and safety\n\nSelected Publications:\n\nLiu, Y., Habibnezhad, M., and Jebelli, H.

This award was established to honor practitioners that have made significant contributions and advancements to the research, design, construction, manufacturing and use of deep foundations.\n\nClemence was recognized for his 40 years of comprehensive research on the design and behavior of helical foundations. He is credited with shaping the modern use of helical piles and tiebacks, which advanced to a widely implemented foundation tool and robust business industry. He was a founding member and chair of DFI’s Helical Piles and Tiebacks Committee.\n\nMatthew Conte ’06, principal at the Conte Company, introduced Clemence at the DFI Awards ceremony and provided this tribute to Clemence’s accomplishments, innovation and leadership.\n\n“If you work in the helical pile industry, you have Sam Clemence to thank. The modern use of these deep foundations was shaped by Sam. His research has created one of the most comprehensive data collections of torque-to-capacity and helix plate analysis in the industry. The use of helical piles and tiebacks advanced into a widely implemented foundation tool and robust business industry. Serving as the first Chair of the DFI Helical Pile and Tiebacks Committee, Sam made it known that these foundations have their place in design standards.\n\nAs an Assistant Operations Officer in the US Navy Civil Engineer Corps, Sam completed projects in some of the most remote locations in the world. Installing deep foundations into crystallized coral and constructing bridges using elephants probably would not surprise you if you were familiar with his creative approach to engineering.\n\nWith a career close to 50 years as an educator, Sam developed a unique way to both relate to young engineers while also preparing them for the industry ahead. He didn’t have to tout his accomplishments; you could recognize them in how he taught. When I meet other Syracuse University engineering alumni, we always share a fun story about our time with Professor Clemence. A legend always leaves a lasting impression on those they meet. The contributions of Sam Clemence have made impressions on the current deep foundation industry and will continue to do so in the contributions of the students he has taught.”\n\nCharting a Pathway to Renewable Energy\n\nImagine a city where streetlights and crosswalks no longer rely on electric grids for power. Instead, they draw their energy from the construction material that makes up several buildings and sidewalks: concrete. While it sounds far-fetched, three College of Engineering and Computer Science students, Ian Storrs, Brendan Murty, and Ryan Mussaw, are working to make this a reality. Through research and testing, their discoveries have the potential to be a new commercial technology that harnesses an overlooked source of energy and makes an impact on sustainability.\n\nTheir invention, ConCurrent, relies on the principles of thermodynamics, a field of physics that involves energy, temperature, and heat. Concrete on its own can’t generate electricity. But heat can – and construction materials like concrete and asphalt can soak up a large percentage of the sun’s heat. With a huge amount of heat being absorbed into the concrete, the engineering trio discovered an ingenious way to transform this wasted energy into a power source by turning heat absorbed by concrete into electricity. This began their journey into the world of renewable energy research.\n\nOriginally a pitch for Invent@SU, their prototypes were concrete blocks fused with a thermoelectric generator, which transforms heat absorbed by the block into electricity when one side of the block is hot, and the other side is cool. The temperature difference between each side is crucial to generating electricity—the greater the temperature difference, the more electricity can be generated.\n\n“We were thinking our invention could power things in close proximity to roadways and illumination for sidewalks like embedded lights, kind of like what you’d see at movie theatres when you’re walking down the aisle,” Murty said.\n\nHowever, a single concrete block isn’t enough to generate power for crosswalks or streetlights, so they’ll need a considerable number of these devices to achieve this. These blocks have been helpful in exploring the concept of heat, concrete, and electricity and they’ve included other materials in their prototypes to amplify the temperature difference on each side of the block.\n\n“We included a copper plate on top to absorb heat and pull it down from the surface of the concrete,” Storrs said. “The aluminum plate pulls heat from the bottom to try to cool it. The sides are also wrapped in foam insulation to reduce heat escaping. And on the bottom, we have a heat pipe, a copper tube with fluid that’s good for moving heat.”\n\nWhile some may think ConCurrent is solar power with extra steps, there are some differences. Solar power relies on sunlight. ConCurrent relies on solar radiation or the heat absorbed from the sun’s radiation. This means even when the sun goes down, their invention can continue functioning since concrete absorbs and retains heat.\n\n“It’s a resource that hasn’t really been tapped in a real effective way. We have solar, which harnesses the sun’s energy but this specific realm hasn’t been focused on,” Murty said.\n\nThe research aspect of the project was by far the most interesting part to the engineers. They would be able to continue research on ConCurrent when offered a position at the Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) at the start of fall 2022. At the assessment center, Storrs, Murty, and Mussaw assisted manufacturing companies in conserving energy by suggesting changes in lighting and other power sources. Funded by the assessment center, their work also helped them when it came to research and they spent the summer reading other academic papers and building different iterations of the design.\n\n“It’s a relatively small research area,” Storrs said. “We did find other projects that were doing similar things like a solar collector, but those projects focus on asphalt road surfaces. They’re also different since they have pipes underneath roads that circulate water and air to collect heat.”\n\nConCurrent’s function heavily relies on temperature difference, so the engineers have explored ways to reduce energy loss. They’ve considered filling the empty space of their thermoelectric generator with insulation materials and conducted experiments to test the effectiveness of covering pavement with absorbent black paint, as this could help increase solar radiation absorption. Their research has also allowed them to delve deeper into understanding heat absorption in asphalt pavements. Even with their many triumphs, however, the engineers did encounter some issues along the way.\n\n“Since we’re a self-guided research team, we’ve had to narrow the scope and direction of our project as we did our literature review,” Storrs said. “This was initially overwhelming, but we were able to meet with the engineering librarian Jaun Denzer who was enormously helpful in pointing us in the right direction.”\n\nDespite being a self-guided group belonging to different programs within ECS, the engineering trio is far from a ragtag bunch – they’re a dream team. Whether it be Storrs’s mechanical engineering knowledge or Murty’s previous experience using modeling software in his aerospace engineering course, each member has contributed something noteworthy to the project to make it what it is today.\n\nMussaw, who joined the group after Invent@SU, and his electrical engineering expertise also came in handy for ConCurrent’s electrical components, something the group initially struggled with during the competition. He discussed some things he desired to achieve with this invention.\n\n“We’re hoping to have multiple temperature sensors throughout the prototypes we’re using,” he explained. “We’re also hoping to pull weather data from Syracuse Airport so we can compare weather data from stations – there will be a lot of data analysis to paint a better picture of what’s going on.”\n\nMatthew Brewster, a civil engineering student who exited the group after Invent@SU, was credited with designing how their invention would look and even suggested using thermoelectric generators while ConCurrent was in its early stages of development.\n\n“One of the ideas I had initially suggested when brainstorming was developing some type of solar sidewalk where the solar cells could be laid out and pressed into wet concrete,” Storrs said. “Matthew suggested using thermo-electric generators, which I had never heard of before. We essentially just ran with it from then on.”\n\nWhat began as an Invent@SU pitch has now evolved into a research project where every member, current and former, has contributed to the project’s success. And though they didn’t place in the competition, their collective drive to make a positive impact on the environment has led to the creation of innovative solutions for renewable energy. With support from the ECS faculty and their experience at the assessment center, these engineers are paving the way for clean energy solutions and revolutionizing the way we consume power.\n\nCenter for Sustainable Community Solutions and Environmental Finance Center Announces New Director\n\nThe College of Engineering and Computer Science is pleased to announce the transition of Melissa Young into a new role as Director of the Center for Sustainable Community Solutions – Environmental Finance Center (CSCS-EFC) at Syracuse University. CSCS-EFC is housed within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. With her extensive leadership experience and dedication to sustainability, Young is poised to build upon the Center’s long and successful history and to continue developing impactful programming for the communities it serves.\n\nYoung has been an integral part of the CSCS-EFC team since 2008, previously serving as Director of Resource Conservation Initiatives. Throughout her career, she has played a pivotal role in public engagement, outreach, education, and technical assistance initiatives. Her programmatic effort was previously focused on sustainable materials management, encompassing crucial aspects such as waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. In her new position, Young will expand her scope to include initiatives related to water and wastewater infrastructure, particularly for rural and underserved populations, which she had worked on when she was first hired at Syracuse University.\n\nThe shift in leadership comes as CSCS-EFC celebrates its 30th year anniversary in 2023. Since 1993, CSCS-EFC has used a unique community-based approach to assist hundreds of municipalities across EPA Region 2, which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and eight Native Nations. CSCS-EFC provides essential training and brings together a variety of governmental and nonprofit actors to collaborate on sustainability issues, including water infrastructure management, water equity, climate resiliency, resource conservation, and sustainable materials management. Since 2015, CSCS-EFC has been awarded $15.75 million in federal, state, and local grants to support communities by providing tools, technical assistance, outreach and education, research, and more.\n\n“This is an exciting time for Syracuse University’s CSCS-EFC as it continues to lead the way in developing solutions for communities across EPA Region 2,” says J. Cole Smith, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “Melissa’s background and track record of proven results and positive impact will be essential to taking CSCS-EFC to even greater heights.”\n\n“I am honored and deeply committed to lead our organization’s efforts to catalyze positive change and foster environmental stewardship, while engaging deeply with communities across our region and beyond,” says Young. “Together with our dedicated team and partners, we will continue to innovate and expand our impact, working to create a more sustainable and resilient future for all.”\n\nReducing Plastic Pollution\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Professor Svetoslava Todorova attended the second session of the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Negotiations Committee on Plastics during the summer of 2023 in Paris, France.\n\nTodorova joined representatives from UN member states, regional economic integration organizations, UN agencies and intergovernmental agencies in an attempt to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment. Unfortunately, the committee was unable to come to an agreement on a draft at the second session.\n\nThe next meeting of the committee will be held in November 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya. The committee has the goal of delivering a final agreement by the end of 2024.\n\n“Overconsumption of plastics in a throw-away society generates a lot of waste. Much of it is not easily degradable and can persist in the environment. Single-use plastics visibly accumulate on the streets and in our waterways. I had hoped that the high visibility of problems connected to plastics pollution would make intergovernmental negotiations easier,” says Todorova. “Unfortunately, during the second session of the Intergovernmental Negotiations Committee, the delegates were locked in extensive discussions on basic principles and missed engaging in more substantive topics. This shows how difficult these negotiations will be and how challenging it will be to overcome divergent interests and opposition to progress in reducing plastics waste.”\n\nDigging Deep into Soil Analysis\n\nWhether he’s exploring rocky quarries, mountain biking on winding trails, or training for club gymnastics, Trygve Moler prefers the outdoors. Growing up in Montana, he spent his childhood playing in open fields and poking around the wilds, instilling in him a deep appreciation for nature.\n\n“My family camped a lot when I was younger,” he said. “I grew up living on the edges of town with fields and ditches to explore. Even as I’ve gotten older, I’ll take any excuse to be outside.”\n\nHis strong connection to the outdoors also made him aware of the current climate crisis that’s affecting Montana. Soaring temperatures, blazing wildfires, and winters that rival Syracuse’s chilly seasons have wreaked havoc on his home state.\n\n“It’s not hard to notice highly irregular snowfall, extreme forest fires, and smoke when I’m living through them. Right now, Montana is experiencing a serious heat wave,” he said. “Winter is also unpredictable. Sometimes we barely get snow, but other times we get more than expected.”\n\nThese experiences ultimately shaped Moler’s decision to pursue environmental engineering at Syracuse University and further explore his fascination with the natural world. “There really was never a question about it,” he said. “I knew I wanted to be an engineer when I saw environmental was an option. It was an immediate choice.”\n\nWith an internship under civil and environmental engineering professor, Chris Johnson, Moler has gained experience in environmental lab and field work while considering possible career paths. Alongside fellow interns in Johnson’s biogeochemistry laboratory, he’s spent his summer in New Hampshire and Link Hall analyzing phosphorus in soil samples.\n\nPhosphate, a naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, providing the essential nutrients required for root growth, seed formation, and winter survival. When there’s a sufficient amount of phosphate in the soil, plants can grow to be healthier and stronger. But when there isn’t enough phosphorus, plant growth can be slow.\n\nThe soil samples are collected from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. For decades, scientists have conducted research in the area to better understand the environment and forest ecosystems, making it an ideal spot for analyzing the role of soil phosphorus in forest health.\n\n“Hubbard Brook has a unique history, as some of the most interesting experiments in terms of soil, water, atmosphere, and wildlife took place there,” Moler explained. “It also has some of the longest-running data sets in those fields, as it was founded in the 1960s. For the purposes of my group, Hubbard Brook has the perfect climate to slow the decomposition of organic matter in the soil to a matter of years rather than months, which allows us to study how phosphorus, and many other important nutrients, cycle through the soil.”\n\nMoler’s trip to Hubbard Brook was an amazing opportunity for fieldwork. He and the team stayed in a cabin and journeyed through the wilderness on days it wasn’t raining. Trekking through lush green terrain and flowing brooks, the group used a watershed map with a grid as their guide.\n\nIn certain locations, there would be markers on the ground and on the map which would indicate the areas to collect soil samples from. The soil would be dug from the ground, placed into individual bags, and the size and volume of the soil sample would be recorded. On a typical day, each group would collect samples at between eight and 15 sites.\n\nAfter collecting the samples at Hubbard Brook, Moler and his group returned them to the lab for analysis. He and another intern would take turns preparing the samples to extract various forms of soil phosphorus. The process involved weighing soil samples, mixing acids and bases, shaking them to promote the extraction, and centrifugation to separate the solids from the liquid. The extract solutions were then analyzed for phosphate and total phosphorus.\n\nA segmented flow analyzer was used to analyze phosphate and total phosphorus concentrations in the extract solutions. This device utilizes spectrometry to measure light attenuation or transmittance to determine phosphate concentrations. Before running samples through the machine, the solution must be adjusted to a specific acidity level by adding acids and bases until the sample changes color. Once the solution reaches the desired acidity level, samples can be analyzed by the segmented flow analyzer to determine phosphate concentration in the soil.\n\n“I really enjoy my research,” Moler said. “My coworkers and the lab space are great, and I think this experience will be invaluable in the coming years. This is the most involved work I’ve ever been a part of.”\n\nWhile interning at the biogeochemistry laboratory, Moler was introduced to a field he never knew existed and soon discovered the vastness of environmental research. Something as seemingly simple as soil had extensive research and analysis. Even nutrients found within the soil like nitrogen also had entire papers and in-depth studies, which he found fascinating.\n\n“All the chemistry I’m learning is new. I didn’t even know biogeochemistry crossed over,” Moler said. “That entire area was unknown to me, and I was shocked about how deep every component of it was, including all the elements in the soil. You can read so much about it and all the experiments people have conducted. It was interesting to discover.”\n\nWhen Moler isn’t working at the segmented flow machine, he’s somewhere in the wilderness or participating in physical activities. He’s expressed interest in joining the university’s Outing Club, a pack of outdoor enthusiasts whose adventures consist of weekly trips, ranging from hiking trails to spelunking caves – there couldn’t be a more perfect club for him to join.\n\nHowever, his adventurous spirit goes beyond internships and extracurricular activities. He intends to study abroad in Santiago, Chile, which will allow him to immerse himself in a new culture, explore unfamiliar places, and practice his Spanish.\n\n“Chile was an easy choice for me. In my fourth year of Spanish, I reported on the culture, history, environment, and current affairs of Chile, so I’m already fairly invested in the country,” he said. “I think it’ll be a cool place to study and explore. I’ve also been studying Spanish for four years, so I would love to make the leap to complete fluency.”\n\nMoler considers these experiences to be vital and encourages Syracuse students to seize every opportunity to enhance their college experience through internships, extracurricular activities, and study abroad programs. Such experiences have helped him gain clarity about his future goals and career aspirations.\n\n“For jobs and internships, just get moving,” he said. “I struggled for my first semester to find any opportunities, but it just takes some time and continuous applied effort. Talk to your professors, send emails, ask questions, check on different options, apply regardless of the requirements, and things will happen, especially here in Syracuse.”\n\n“On the other hand, never take yourself too seriously,” he added. “It’s easy to get wrapped up in these big leaps and bounds that college allows us to make. But always remember to take time to have fun and play like a kid.”\n\nJohn Trimmer\n\nAreas of Expertise:\n\nWater and sanitation in resource-limited settings\n\nResource recovery from sanitation\n\nSustainability analysis of water, sanitation, and resource systems\n\nSocial-ecological systems\n\nJohn Trimmer is an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He is interested in sustainable water and sanitation in resource-limited settings, as well as the possibilities associated with resource recovery from sanitation systems. He employs an interdisciplinary perspective to explore how these and other resource systems interact with economics, agriculture, ecology, and socio-cultural contexts to impact people and the environment. He has spent several years working on these topics throughout Africa, first as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Uganda and more recently in Nairobi, Kenya with The Aquaya Institute, a non-profit research organization focused on water, sanitation, and health.\n\nHonors and Awards:\n\nEnvironmental Science & Technology: Best Paper on Environmental Policy in 2020\n\nPaul V.

While it may appear free of noticeable damage when driven over, standing on the bridge reveals that it moves more than expected. This is due to its design as a cable-stayed bridge, where cables play a crucial role in balancing tensions and compressions while distributing weight to the piers and beams. However, the bridge has some cracks in its structure and moves slightly more than it should.\n\nRest assured, the bridge isn’t on the verge of collapse, but it is structurally deficient. This term is used by engineers to describe structures that aren’t in the best shape but still safe to use. And it’s more common than you think. In fact, more than a third of bridges in the United States are structurally deficient as of 2022. However, recent investments in construction aim to tackle the problem of aging infrastructure throughout the country.\n\nAssisting in efforts to improve infrastructure, civil engineering student Alex Torres is currently spending the summer in his home country Puerto Rico gaining structural engineering experience. With the Carrasquillo Engineering Service Group, they’re on a mission to repair the Jesús Izcoa Moure Bridge and other structures in Puerto Rico to ensure their safety.\n\nWearing a helmet, vest, and steel-toe boots, Torres and the service group inspect cracks underneath the bridge, focusing on the beams, which act as the bridge’s support. Using scaffolding to get a better view and make their way around the structure, they also close lanes to restrict the flow of traffic as they scrape and refill areas of the bridge. This is all to balance tension and distribute weight to prevent the bridge from accumulating more pressure and collapsing.\n\n“The bridge is divided into 6 spans and each span is subdivided into 4 squares. The spaces that need to be scrapped or refilled along the bridge are being identified,” Torres explained. “The purpose is that the bridge ends up as leveled as possible and with the most reasonable slope.”\n\nTorres uses a device called Ground Penetrating Radar to avoid damaging crucial structural areas of the bridge. This device sends frequencies to the ground that bounce back when they detect iron rods in the concrete that support the bridge. The frequency data is then passed to a computer, which analyzes wavelengths and shows the highest points. This process determines the depth of any cables, wire tubes, or important structures beneath the concrete, and with this information, Torres can determine the amount of scraping required for the bridge repair that won’t cause damage to crucial areas.\n\n“The highest point in the wavelengths determines how close under the surface the rod is. Therefore, with this you can calculate the maximum clear cover which tells you how deep you can scrape without touching the rods” Torres said.\n\nBridges aren’t the only infrastructures Torres has been inspecting. He also got the chance to collect data at a structurally deficient parking garage. Using ZipLevel, a tool that measures elevation with pressure through gravity, the multilevel garage was a great opportunity for him to see other structures in need of repair and devices civil engineers utilize in the field. Torres noticed that engineers could get creative with tools, seeing firsthand how experienced engineers would use devices for different purposes.\n\n“I noticed how the engineers were analyzing ways to gather data in the field. When discussing how to approach certain repairs, one of them would come up with the idea to use a tool or device that no one else would’ve thought of using for that specific task. Sometimes you can adapt a device you used previously to something else and make it work perfectly for what you need.”\n\nDespite hours spent in the tropical heat, Torres is excited to be working on location. The opportunity to collect data and gain practical experience is invaluable to him – he’d much rather do this than input information in an air-conditioned office. He also had the chance to view a construction plan for the bridge, which provided him with more exposure to the intricacies of civil engineering – an experience he would’ve never had if he weren’t on site.\n\n“I saw a detailed plan of how the bridge was going to be built, including the materials and all the other details. It was interesting because each project has a plan like this. It’s what everyone follows when the project begins,” Torres said. “Seeing one firsthand was fascinating. When I become an engineer and start my own projects, I’ll also have to follow a plan like that. It was an amazing experience. Being able to read one so early on is a blessing.”\n\nTorres enjoyed applying lessons learned from his Engineering and Computer Science courses, like ECS 101, to his current work. Understanding bridge tensions, compressions, and force dynamics helped him make connections between his work experience and classroom education. Additionally, his familiarity with AutoCAD, a software program used by architects and engineers to create model structures, proved useful during the bridge repair process.\n\nWhen the service group isn’t collecting data or repairing damaged areas, Torres chats with the other engineers about their experiences, which provides him with an opportunity to explore different career paths within civil engineering. With the vast array of options available in this field, he’s narrowed his focus to structural and construction engineering as possible career choices after graduation.\n\n“I think it’s good to have a sense of what you would be working on after you graduate,” Torres said. “It’s motivated me to study harder in school. I’m grateful for what I’ve learned at ECS and this experience.”\n\nTorres also encouraged students to participate in various activities to make the most of their time at ECS. He emphasized the importance of pursuing one’s interests and being a part of the community. Not only has his experience allowed him to gain more exposure in civil engineering but it’s also allowed him to build a future for himself.\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Professor Charles Driscoll Selected for the 2023 Clarke Prize in Water Science\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Professor Charles Driscoll has been selected to receive the 2023 Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Water Science and Technology from the National Water Research Institute. Driscoll is the University and Distinguished Professor of Environmental Systems Engineering in College of Engineering and Computer Science.\n\nThe Clarke Prize is considered one of the most prestigious awards pertaining to water science. It is awarded to thought leaders in water research, science, technology, or policy in the United States. Past honorees have included some of the most significant figures in civil and environmental engineering; the water, biological, physical, chemical, health, and political sciences; and public planning and policy.\n\nDriscoll’s research largely involves characterization and quantifying the impacts of air pollution, such as acid rain and mercury, changing climate, and land and water disturbances on the structure and function of ecosystems, and pathways of ecosystem recovery. Much of his work has focused on forests and associated aquatic resources, including long-term studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH and the Huntington Forest in the Adirondacks, NY. Recent work has included strategies for the decarbonization of sectors and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOver the past 40 years, Driscoll has advanced new analytical techniques, established and maintained long-term measurements and experiments, and developed a series of research and predictive models that simulate transformations of major chemical elements in forest vegetation, soil and surface waters in response to air pollution, climate and land disturbance. Beyond theory, he is interested in testing ‘in situ’ strategies to reverse the damaging effects of acid rain and mercury contamination, eutrophication, urbanization, and climate change. Driscoll has testified at US Congressional and state legislative committee hearings, and provided briefings to government agencies, industry and stakeholder groups on environmental issues. He has served on local, national and international committees pertaining to environmental management and policy.\n\nDriscoll will receive the award and give a lecture in Irvine, California, on October 21, 2023.

In international negotiations and conventions, governmental representatives make the final decisions, but representatives from non-governmental organizations are sought to inform the process. It is a critical role because input from experts shape the regulations to ensure the best possible outcomes for our environment. Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Svetoslava Todorova has been involved with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) since 2010. The UNEP is responsible for coordinating responses to environmental issues within the United Nations.\n\n“I have been passionate about participating in international efforts to address environmental issues since a young age. It has been an incredible journey to build and direct my professional life around this cause, and I am excited to make the most of this opportunity,” says Todorova.\n\nTodorova started as a science observer during the UNEP intergovernmental negotiations on mercury. Those negotiations led to the development of the Minamata Convention on Mercury in 2013. The purpose of the convention was to draft an international treaty designed to protect humans and the environment from the release of mercury compounds. Todorova made an important contribution to the treaty and continued her involvement.\n\n“One specific contribution was a sentence in the treaty text that considers the co-benefits of treatment technologies,” says Todorova. “Now, I am part of a scientific group that was formed in 2022 to develop the framework for assessing the Convention’s implementation.”\n\nTodorova’s involvement with the UNEP evolved out of the Minamata Convention. From 2017-2019 she served as a communications liaison for the Fate and Transport group under the Global Mercury Partnership, a scientific advisory body on mercury to the UNEP. In June 2022, she became a member of a working group that was tasked with the development of a framework for a future science-policy panel on the management of chemicals and waste. In October 2022, she was elected to a group tasked with developing a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention.\n\n“The group’s mandate is to provide a plan for data analysis and identify any existing gaps in monitoring, which will be presented to the 5th Conference of Parties (COP) of the Convention in October 2023 for discussion and voting,” says Todorova.\n\nThe COP is the governing body of the convention that makes decisions for its implementation and evaluation. Todorova’s involvement in the mercury negotiations has enabled Syracuse University to become an accredited observer institution, allowing students and faculty to participate in the COP.\n\n“The accredited observer status given to Syracuse University provides opportunities to contribute to the work of the UNEP,” says Todorova. “Being an accredited observer under one convention allows us to participate in the negotiation and implementation of other Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), such as the recent negotiations on a new treaty to address global environmental issues on plastics. This ensures that we have a continuous presence and input on the process.”\n\nIn November 2019, Todorova brought a group of 11 students to attend COP3 of the of the Minamata Convention as part of an Honors course on environmental science-policy. At the COPs, students have the opportunity to sit amongst policymakers and get a sense of the complexity of negotiating agreements on environmental issues. This fall another group of students will have a similar opportunity.\n\n“I am teaching The Role of Science in Environmental Governance in the fall of 2023. As part of the class, students and I will travel to Geneva, Switzerland to attend COP5 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury,” says Todorova.\n\nTodorova says Syracuse University and ECS have been very supportive of her involvement with the UNEP. Her work embodies the College of Engineering and Computer Science’s commitment to meaningful interaction with the world and positively impacting the public.\n\n“I started attending the negotiations for the Minamata Convention on Mercury while I was still a doctoral student in the civil an"
