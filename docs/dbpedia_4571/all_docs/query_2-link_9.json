By birth a Jew, he was educated in the Jewish faith; but he was converted to Christianity by the teaching, it is said, of cardinal Pole and M. A. Flaminio.

Having left Italy, he visited Germany and England, where he lived in. intimacy with archbishops Cranmer and Parker, and for some time supported himself by teaching Hebrew at Cambridge. On the death of Edward VI he returned to Germany, where he remained teaching Hebrew at Hornbach and Heidelberg. He was next invited to occupy the Hebrew chair at Sedan, where he died in 1580.
