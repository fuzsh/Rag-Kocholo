        "text": "Estonian is a Uralic language, which makes it related to Finnish and Hungarian. At the same time, approximately one-third of its vocabulary is borrowed from Germanic languages. Some borrowings also happened from Swedish and Russian. Estonian is the official language of Estonia and is spoken natively by about 1.1 million people, about 900,000 of whom live in Estonia. Historically, there were two versions of the language — the Northern and Southern dialects — but the modern standard version is based on the Northern dialect.\n\nTranslate into Estonian with InText\n\nWhile assisting our international clients, InText always relies on three pillars of our competitiveness:\n\nWhich means:\n\nProven linguists\n\nRobust QA procedures\n\nTop-notch project management\n\nOur Estonian language experts\n\nAs Estonia is highly integrated into the European economy, knowledge of foreign languages is quite common among younger generations.
