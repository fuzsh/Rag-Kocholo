        "text": "Estonian (eesti keel) is a Finno-Ugric language spoken by roughly 1.1 million people in Estonia. Though closely related to Finnish and distantly to Hungarian, Estonian bears almost no resemblance to any other European language in either vocabulary or grammar.\n\nThe lack of Indo-European language structures makes Estonian a rather difficult language to learn. The fact that it has more words of Indo-European origin than Finnish, for instance, it is slightly easier to learn. Even though many people in Estonia (especially young people) speak English and many of the older generation understand Russian (though Russian has an association with the Soviet and Russian imperial times and starting a conversation with native Estonian speakers in Russian can be perceived as rude), an attempt at some basic phrases will definitely impress the locals and you will receive an enthusiastic welcome.\n\nPronunciation guide\n\n[edit]\n\nWritten Estonian is based on the Latin alphabet and uses 27 letters:\n\na b d e f g h i j k l m n o p r s š z ž t u v õ ä ö ü\n\nAdditionally, the letters c, q, w, x and y are used in loanwords, foreign proper names and quotes.\n\nPronunciation is fairly straightforward. Most words are pronounced as they are written, with a major exception being vowel length (see below).\n\nVowels\n\n[edit]\n\nLong vowels are indicated simply by doubling the vowel in question.\n\na\n\nlike a in father, but short and clipped\n\naa\n\nlike a in father\n\ne\n\nlike e in get\n\nee\n\nnot found in English, but just stretch out the e sound\n\ni\n\nlike i in bit\n\nii\n\nlike ee in beet\n\no\n\nlike o in nor\n\noo\n\nstretch out the o sound\n\nu\n\nlike u in rule — that's the same u as in German, Italian or Spanish\n\nuu\n\nstretch out the u sound\n\nä\n\nlike a in cat\n\nää\n\nlike a in bad\n\nö\n\nlike German ö, similar to e in her (transcribed ew )\n\nöö\n\nnot found in English, but just stretch out the \"ö\" sound\n\nü\n\nlike German ü, something like ew in few, but there's no ü sound in English\n\nüü\n\nnot found in English, but just stretch out the \"ü\" sound\n\nõ\n\na uniquely Estonian sound pronounced with the tongue in the same position as the o sound, but with lips unrounded; kind of halfway between the e in get and the u in hung\n\nõõ\n\nnot found in English, but just stretch out the \"õ\" sound\n\nThe duration of vowel sounds can be short, long, or overlong, depending on the word. Short vowels are written with one letter, long and overlong vowels with two. Overlong vowels often change the pitch or stress of the syllable as well as the duration. There is no written distinction between long and overlong vowels. Example:\n\nshortsada (SAH-dah)→one hundred longsaada (SAAH-dah)→send! overlongsaada (SAAAH-dah)→to get\n\nConsonants\n\n[edit]\n\nc, foreign letter, used only in names and foreign words. Pronounced as ts in hats, also, for example the place name Chicago is pronounced in the same way as in English.\n\nh : silent at the beginning of a word; before a vowel like English h; before a consonant harshly pronounced guttural h\n\nj : like y in yes\n\nq, foreign letter, used only in names and foreign words. Sounds similar to k in kitchen\n\nr : like r in trilled, like Spanish rr\n\ns : like s in soap\n\nš, foreign letter, but used in loan words. Sounds like sh in shoe\n\nž, foreign letter, but used in loan words. Sounds like s in measure\n\nw, foreign letter, used only in names and foreign words. Sounds like w in Worry\n\nx, foreign letter, used only in names and foreign words. Sounds like x in excite [ks sound]\n\nb d f g k l m n p t v y z : pronounced as in English\n\nConsonants can appear doubled, such as kk, pp, tt, etc., and are pronounced by inserting a glottal stop or prolonging the duration of the consonant.\n\nDiphthongs\n\n[edit]\n\nae\n\nas the 'ie' in \"diet\" [two sounds]\n\nai\n\nas the 'ai' in \"aisle\"\n\näe\n\nas the 'ae' in \"aesthetic\"\n\nStress\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first syllable of a word is always stressed, except in some foreign words such as Ameerika (ah-MEHH-ree-kah)."
