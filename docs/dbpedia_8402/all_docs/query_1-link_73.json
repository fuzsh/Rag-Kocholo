        "text": "The goal of this paper is to analyze the syntax of spatial preposition in Norwegian and Persian language. This account is pretty novel as it analyzes the prepositional phrases in a unified way, since it does not restrict itself to some simple spatial prepositions. Rather, the chosen approach accounts for both simple and complex spatial prepositions. Furthermore, there is a clear difference in spatial prepositions between Persian and Norwegian. In this study, some of the nuanced differences between Persian and Norwegian, when it comes to spatial prepositions, are offered. Moreover, it goes further than this, by analyzing wh-questions responses in the form of spatial prepositions and shows the ungrammaticality of some of the answers by adhering to the principles stated in this novel approach. In this work, some important features of Persian and Norwegian spatial prepositions are further detailed which shows the rich internal structure of spatial preposition and its flexibility of movement/orientation aspect.\n\nIn their keynote contribution, Poplack, Zentz & Dion (henceforth PZD; Poplack, Zentz & Dion, 2011, this issue) propose an interesting “scientific test of convergence” (under section heading: “Introduction”) which contains criteria to check whether a particular feature in a given language in contact with another one is due to language contact or not. This is a valiant endeavor with a laudable goal. It is valiant because the answer to this question requires a complex investigation of the languages at issue. It is laudable since it is commonly believed that a given feature of a language in contact with another one is the result of convergence. This belief however is, in general, only a mere conjecture due to superficial similarities of the features at issue, for which no empirical evidence is provided. Yet, there is no doubt that PZD accomplish their endeavor in an outstanding manner. Based on a thorough study of substantial data from Canadian French and Canadian English, they demonstr...\n\nStudies on prepositions have been explored in corpus linguistics. They have been studied in various perspectives mainly in relation to frequency and collocational information. In order to look at the developments of these studies, this paper will focus on the development of sequence of studies of prepositions in three decades as observed by the authors. In keeping up with the developments, this paper will also look into the scenario of English language corpus work in Malaysia. Based on these review, this paper will then further add to this body of knowledge by providing a more tangible and practical applications in dealing with prepositions from the perspectives of the teaching and learning of prepositions.\n\nThe growth of English into a lingua franca has inevitably created linguistic deviations and innovations in the use of English. These emerging uses that result from the needs and preferences of speakers whose mother tongues are all different can be broadly identified as lexico-grammatical and pronunciation features and they compose one of the main arteries of study in English as lingua franca communication. In an effort to investigate shared and systematized uses of English as a lingua franca (ELF) and their possible codification have formed the focus of considerable research in the field. This paper introduces an ELF corpus, Corpus IST-Erasmus, which is compiled as part of a PhD study to investigate the lexico-grammar of ELF interactions. The corpus consists of 10 hours 47 minutes of recorded speech and 93,913 words of transcribed data. It is compiled by means of 54 speech events, 29 interviews and 25 focus group meetings. The participants of the study are 79 incoming Erasmus students, representing 24 first languages. These languages are namely Arabic, Azerbaijan, Basque, Bulgarian, Cantonese, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, Galician, German, Greek, Italian, Korean, Lithuanian, Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Suriname, Turkish, and Ukrainian. The focus of this paper is to examine whether there are variations from standard English as Native Language (ENL) forms with respect to the use of prepositions in spoken ELF interactions, as have been outlined in ELF research (Seidlhofer, 2004). The paper also aims to present the emerging patterns in the use of prepositions and suggest implications for an ELF-aware pedagogy in English Language Teaching. Although there is an increase in the number of empirical studies, there is still a gap in the description of ELF discourse. In order to fully identify the characteristics of ELF, more corpora studies should be conducted. These studies will provide data for ELT professionals in designing an ELF-oriented pedagogy and materials. Besides, there is limited research on the English use of international students- none in the Turkish setting. The present research, therefore, aims to fulfil this niche in the ELF research.\n\nThis pilot study aims to identify differences in native and non-native phraseologies, focussing on prepositional patterns. Previous research suggests L2 users’ limited phraseological choices may hinder the accuracy of their language production, and prepositions can pose a particular challenge to Czech learners of English, given the lack of correspondence between translation equivalents. Further, prepositional patterns contribute to text structuring, making them an important part of learners´ competence. Using representative corpora of English and Czech, 3- to 5-grams containing the equivalent preposition pair in/v are extracted. The identified patterns are classified by their semantics and textual functions. While in/v patterns mostly fulfil corresponding functions in the languages compared, the distribution of these functions differs. Specifically, some pattern types are only found in English, highlighting its analytic nature as opposed to inflectional Czech.\n\nOne of the main syntactic developments in contemporary Russian is a greater use of prepositions and less use of simple cases. This tendency implies greater analyticity, the possibility of the loss of cases and can be considered a characteristic of all Indo-European languages. This process has already taken place on a considerable scale, bringing to a significant change in the structure of Modern Russian as opposed to Old Russian. A frequently occurring feature in Old Russian was the absence of prepositions in constructions which are now expressed with the help of prepositions. This article analyses the expansion of prepositions in Russian by means of four statistical tools applied to two corpora of literary prose texts from the late 19th and the late 20th centuries. The application of principal component analysis as a tool for dimensional reduction and the testing of the hypothesis for frequencies reveals a significant increase in the total frequency of prepositions in prose literary texts written at the end of the 20th century, if compared with the frequency in texts written at the end of the 19th century."
