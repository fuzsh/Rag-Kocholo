        "text": "Estonia\n\nSince Estonia's independence from Russia in 1991, Estonian has become the country's only official language. Even during the Soviet occupation, when it was not banned, Estonian was widely used in business and education. The language, which is closely related to Finnish is spoken by over two thirds of the population (particularly younger and older people) while Russian is spoken by about a quarter of the population. Other minority languages include approximately 3% Ukrainian speakers, 2% Belarusian, 1% and a smaller number of Hebrew speakers.\n\nBBC News Online country profile\n\nCountries Languages"
