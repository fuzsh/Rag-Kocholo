        "text": "Heritage is also an important part of Tallinn and Tartu. The Old City of Tallinn is like stepping into a fairytale, with ivy-covered walls, turrets and a wood-lined perimeter. The Old City also houses restaurants serving traditional Estonian food and shops selling traditional products. Over in Tartu, you can find one of the last surviving baroque squares in Europe, as well as the Vanemuine, the oldest Estonian-language theatre in the world.\n\nBut many Estonians will tell you that the country’s true treasure is its nature. From national parks, to stone beaches, to pine forests, there’s lots of nature just waiting to be explored for such a small country.\n\nSince regaining its independence in 1991, Estonia has completely transformed its economy. It’s now among the most technologically advanced countries in the world. Estonians can even vote online. Tallinn and Tartu have thriving tech start-up scenes and an increasing number of international companies are choosing to set up their Baltic offices in Estonia. Adding to this is the fact that Estonia is among the countries where it’s easiest to do business.\n\nThis means that internships, apprenticeships and summer work can be easy to come by, helping to boost your education. Tartu is also known as a city with a strong student vibe. Nightlife and activities are aplenty. Estonia has everything you need for a fantastic student experience."
