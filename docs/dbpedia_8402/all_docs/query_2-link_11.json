        "text": "Estonian (eesti keel) is the official language of the country of Estonia and a national treasure.\n\nIn addition to Estonian speakers, there are many native Russian speakers in the country, as well as other smaller communities of speakers of other languages. English is spoken widely enough that, in practical terms, learning Estonian isn’t necessary: You will most likely get by quite nicely with just the basics.\n\nTo get a long-term residence permit, however, you’ll need to reach the B1 level.\n\nIf you do decide to learn, get ready for exciting times. As a Finnic language, Estonian is unrelated to most other languages in Europe. Newcomers can struggle with what feels like excessive grammar and vowel-heavy pronunciation.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it’s just another language. Your ability to pick it up will mostly just depend on your interest and effort level. The secret is finding out how to trick Estonians into making small talk long enough for you to practice! When you find out how to do that, let us know—we’ve been trying to unlock that secret."
