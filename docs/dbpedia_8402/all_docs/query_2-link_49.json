You can learn the language in different ways: by writing, listening and with the help of the example posts. The app is very user-friendly and it’s easy to study whenever possible.\n\nWordDive is one of the best online language courses that I have ever used. I thought I was really bad at languages, but with WordDive I have learned more than 300 study items permanently in a short time. Sometimes I study more than 2 hours per day. Even then it doesn’t feel like I’m spending a long time studying because it’s so fun and rewarding.\n\nWordDive is one of the best online language courses that I have ever used.

The program tells you when you are making progress or when you are too tired and should take a break. WordDive has become a daily companion for me. I enjoy studying and becoming better. It’s also nice to notice that you can learn new things even at this age.\n\nThe efficiency is way better than it would be in school.

It’s nice to attend meetings now that I can express myself properly.\n\nWordDive is very addictive, and the words stick to your mind.As a researcher of digitalization, I can say that WordDive is an excellent example of gamification, because in WordDive, the motivation comes from outside the game: improving your language skills.
