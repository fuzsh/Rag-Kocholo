Once a relationship warms up this becomes less so.\n\nA couple enjoying their sauna. Photo by Estonian Saunas on Unsplash\n\nEtiquette and Manners in Estonia\n\nMeeting and Greeting\n\nGreetings can come across as rather formal and rather reserved.\n\nMen should initiate greetings with women and the younger person always greets the older person.\n\nWhen meeting someone make sure you are stood up, offer direct eye contact and give a nice firm handshake.\n\nThe most common greeting is \"tere\" (\"hello\").\n\nTitles are very important. \"Härra\" is for Mr, \"Prova\" is Mrs and \"Preili\" is Miss. All should be followed with the surname.\n\nOnly use first names once you have been invited to do so.\n\nGift Giving Etiquette\n\nGifts are usually exchanged for birthdays and at Christmas.\n\nGifts need not be expensive as it is more about the thought than monetary worth.\n\nIf you are invited to an Estonian's house, a decent gift is a bring a box of chocolates or flowers.\n\nFlowers should be given in odd numbers.\n\nGifts are usually opened when received.\n\nDining Etiquette\n\nArrive on time. Punctuality is expected. Call if running late.\n\nCheck to see if shoes are being worn in the house.\n\nDo not expect a tour of the house - homes are private.\n\nDress conservatively.\n\nTry and offer to help the hostess with the preparation or clearing up after a meal is served. This will be turned down but is nonetheless polite.\n\nDo not discuss business.\n\nReciprocate any hospitality received.\n\nTable Manners\n\nTable manners are relatively formal in Estonia.\n\nRemain standing until invited to sit down.\n\nTable manners are Continental, i.e. the fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating.\n\nDo not begin eating until the hostess starts or someone says \"head isu\" (\"good appetite\").\n\nAvoid resting your elbows of the table.\n\nCompliment the hostess on the meal.\n\nTry to finish everything on your plate.\n\nTipping\n\nAlthough tipping isn’t compulsory in Estonia, it is part of Estonian custom to reward good restaurant service with a 10% tip.\n\nTips are generally accepted by other service providers, if offered (e.g. by rounding up the taxi bill, or by giving a small tip to porters and housekeepers) but they are not expected.\n\nEstonian Business Culture and Etiquette\n\nMeeting & Greeting Etiquette in Estonia\n\nEstonians are quite formal and may not come across as quite cold or even friendly to people from more informal cultures. This should not be interpreted so.\n\nOnce the relationship warms up the communication style becomes a lot less stiff.\n\nShake hands with everyone at the meeting.\n\nRemember it is rude to greet someone while seated.\n\nHandshakes should be firm and confident.\n\nMaintain steady eye contact while shaking hands.\n\nTry and wait for a woman to extend her hand.\n\nAddress businesspeople by their professional title and their surname.\n\nIf someone does not have a professional title, use \"Härra\" to address a man and \"Prova\" to address a woman.\n\nWait until invited before moving to a first-name basis.\n\nBusiness Card Etiquette\n\nBusiness cards are exchanged without any fuss or ritual.\n\nPresent your business card so it is readable to the recipient.\n\nTreat someone's business card with respect.\n\nHaving the other side of your card translated into Estonian is a nice gesture.\n\nPhoto by UNHCR (CC BY-NC 2.0)\n\nCommunication Style\n\nEstonians mean what they say and do what they say they will do.\n\nThey expect foreign businesspeople to keep their word.\n\nFailing to do so can cause irreparable harm to a business relationship.\n\nThey are generally polite and courteous speakers.\n\nEstonians are somewhat pragmatic and reserved, especially in the early stages of developing a business relationship.\n\nEstonians are not emotive speakers.\n\nIf you are from a culture where hand gestures are robust, you may wish to moderate them to conform to local practices.\n\nSoft voices are the norm. If you have a booming voice, you may wish to moderate it when conducting business with Estonians.\n\nEstonians do not always respond to what has been said, especially if they are uncomfortable with the subject or if they need more time to organize their thoughts.\n\nAlthough they are direct communicators, Estonians temper their directness in order to protect the feelings of all concerned.\n\nThey are slow to pay compliments and may become suspicious of compliments offered too readily and without sufficient reason.\n\nPassive silence is very much part of the communication style.\n\nEstonians are not fond of conversational overlap and will not think highly of someone who interrupts them while they are speaking.\n\nEstonians value their good reputations. Therefore, be careful not to criticize or embarrass anyone publicly.\n\nBusiness Meeting Etiquette\n\nMeetings generally begin with a welcoming speech from the most senior Estonian at the meeting. The most senior person from your team should respond with a short speech.\n\nIt is common to continue meetings over lunch or dinner, although the conversation will tend to be social, rather than business-oriented.\n\nThese seemingly social occasions are an opportunity for your Estonian colleagues to get to know you as an individual and develop a personal relationship.\n\nSince this is a culture that prefers to do business with friends, consider the time spent at meals as important as time spent at the negotiating table.\n\nAlthough Estonians juxtapose business and social situations, it is important to maintain a formal demeanour at meetings.\n\nEstonians dislike an overly casual attitude towards business, especially from foreigners.\n\nIt generally takes several meetings to reach a decision. In most cases, decisions are still made at the top of the company, so unless you are meeting with the top echelon of the company, what you propose will have to make its way up the chain of command for approval.\n\nOlder businesspeople are generally only fluent in Estonian or Russian. Therefore, you may wish to have an interpreter with you at meetings.\n\nManagement Culture\n\nRead our guide to Estonian Management Culture for more information on this topic."
