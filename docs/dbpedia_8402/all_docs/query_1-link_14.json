        "text": "Although Estonia shares borders with Latvia, Russia, Sweden, and the Gulf of Finland, it has a national language of its own. The country was once under Baltics German rule and became independent in 1917. The same reason why German and Estonian have many similar words. However, contrary to popular belief, Estonian is not related to Russian or German. The Estonian Language is more similar to Finnish as it belongs to the Uralic Language family. In fact, Estonian is the second most spoken language of the Finnic family.\n\nSpoken by more than 1 million people around the globe, it is considered the 5th toughest language to learn for English speakers. The Estonian alphabet is based on Latin alphabets. The syllables and varieties in words aren’t easy for an outsider to understand. But don’t be too intimated, you don’t have to learn Estonian to visit Estonia. There are plenty who can speak and understand English there.\n\nThe Official Language Of Estonia\n\nEstonia has one of the highest literacy rates of 98% with students learning many other languages at school. If you ever come here, you will find many English, Russian and Finnish speakers. Many people also speak German, French, and Swedish with fluency. Estonian is written using the Roman Alphabet just like English, with the addition of a few letters including õ, ä,ö, and ü. It is considered one of the hardest languages because of its 14 noun cases, long vowels, and consonants. Surprisingly, the language has no gender, no future tense. But this doesn’t mean that it is free of tongue twisters, the 24 letter word ‘kuulilennuteetunneliluuk’ is not only a palindrome but it also means a whole phrase, i.e “the hatch a bullet flies out of when exiting a tunnel”.\n\nEstonian Language In The World\n\nWhen it comes to the official language, it isn’t just spoken in the country. You can hear people speaking Estonian in Russia, villages in Siberia, and many Finnish areas. Despite 90% of the native speakers living in Estonia, Estonian is spoken as the first language in Siberian villages where the earliest descendants came and settled down.\n\nRegional Estonian Language Dialects\n\nIt may seem highly unlikely that in such a small country, there could be much difference in dialects. Not only are they different and specific, but the southern and northern dialects also have different pronunciations. In fact, the vocabulary also changes significantly from North to South Estonia.\n\nFor example, the inhabitants from the largest island of Sareema don’t use the sound “õ”. For them, there is no difference between õ and ö. Perhaps they also think that the 14 case nouns thing was a bit too much.\n\nOther than the omission of “õ”, there are also certain vocabulary differences. These differences are found in the northern and southern dialects which make the same native language sound different to the listeners. One fine example is using the word for snow while making a snowball, there is “pakib” or “hakkab Kokku”, where they both mean almost the same thing.\n\nWhat Language Do They Speak In Estonia?\n\nEstonian is the standard language of the country. But there are other Estonian languages too.\n\nThe residents are insistent that they are separate languages with their own distinctive vocabulary and dialect. These regional languages include:\n\nVõro\n\nVõro belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages. Initially, it was considered the South Estonian regional dialect but today, it has the status of an individual language. With 75000 speakers in the parishes of the Voru county and a newspaper of its own, this language is endangered due to the lack of government’s attention on preserving it.\n\nSeto\n\nSometimes considered a version of Võro, a fusional language you can call it, is a southern dialect in the country. There are more than 12000 speakers of this language who sometimes use it with a combination of Võro, making it one entity, known as Seto-Võro.\n\nSetos inhabit areas closer to the border of Russia.\n\nMulgi And Tartu\n\nMulgi or South Estonian is a dialect of standard Estonian. Many linguists agree with that. Others, however, go with its history which indicates that it is a separate Finnic language.\n\nFrom the 17th to 19th century, Southern Tartu and Northern Võro were used for publishing literature. This version was more commonly called the literary South Estonian. Its written form was used in schools. It was later shifted to Standard Estonian after the independence in 1918.\n\nModern Estonian Orthography is more concentrated on Finnish orthography."
