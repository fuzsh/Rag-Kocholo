        "text": "Economy\n\nImports\n\n$19.3 billion (2020). Refined Petroleum ($1.19B), Cars ($1.07B), Packaged Medicaments ($476M), Broadcasting Equipment ($431M), and Sawn Wood ($359M), importing mostly from Russia ($2.28B), Germany ($2.02B), Finland ($1.78B), Latvia ($1.59B), and Lithuania ($1.33B).\n\nFinancial inclusion factors (over 15 years of age)\n\n• 98% have an account with a financial institution\n\n• 29% have a credit card\n\n• 75% make online purchases\n\nEase of doing business\n\nIt is very easy to conduct business (rated 76.8 out of 100) ranked 10th out of 34 OECD high-income countries, and ranked 18th out of 190 countries worldwide (2022, World Bank).\n\nGlobal Innovation Index\n\nRanked 10th out of 39 European countries, and 18th out of 132 worldwide.\n\nMedia\n\nMedia language\n\nPredominantly French, English, Arabic\n\nInformation channels:\n\nTelevision is Estonia’s most popular medium, while print media are losing ground to online outlets. The media market is lightly regulated. Three major companies, including Sweden’s MTG, run the top commercial TVs. Eesti Televisioon and Eesti Raadio are public broadcasters. Digital TV platforms offer stations in Finnish, Swedish, Russian and Latvian. Estonia has a free media, according to groups such as Freedom House and Reporters Without Borders. It has not followed the example of Lithuania and Latvia, which in 2014 and 2015 imposed rebroadcasting bans on some Russian TVs.\n\nThe press\n\nPostimees – leading daily, Estonian and Russian-language editions\n\nOhtuleht – popular tabloid\n\nEesti Paevaleht – daily\n\nAripaev – business daily\n\nMaaleht – weekly\n\nEesti Ekspress – weekly\n\nSocial statistics\n\nLife expectancy\n\n82.73 yrs (2020)\n\nAverage age of the population\n\n42.4 yrs\n\nHealthcare expenditure\n\n6.73 of GDP\n\nClass\n\nEstonia is a totally classless society. However, as is the case in most countries today, there are both well-to-do and less fortunate people, economically speaking. Regardless of one’s financial situation, nobody is looked down on in Estonia today, nor do the poorer people unduly worship those who are richer.\n\nEthnicity\n\nRegardless of ethnic background, everyone is judged – socially and professionally – on their skills and ability to handle the task taken on and on their ability to get along with others, co-workers and supervisors alike. It is also very important to note that, by law, workers in Estonia must be able to understand and speak the national language, which is Estonian – a language very similar to Finnish.\n\nReligion\n\nEven though most Estonians consider themselves as religious people, religion is not a critical factor in most work and social situations in today’s Estonia. The Lutheran Church is the prevailing one; the Russian Orthodox Church has also a number of followers; there are relatively few Roman Catholics among the Estonians. A number of other religions also have followers, including Judaism and other eastern faiths. So, most everyone can find a place to worship in Estonia, certainly in its major cities.\n\nGender\n\nAccording to the law, there is no difference between the sexes and they enjoy the same freedoms. Women may hold the same positions as men; however, they are still in charge of bringing up children, doing housework, etc., although this is becoming more equally shared. All of these tasks impede women from spending as much time at work as men can; therefore, the evolution of their careers takes much longer. There are fewer women in positions of responsibility, but those who do hold them are respected all the more."
