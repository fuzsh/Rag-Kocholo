        "text": "Estonian language and professional translation\n\nEstonian is an official language of the Republic of Estonia. In spite the Estonian is considered a European language, it very much differs from the most of European languages because it does not belong to the Indo – European group. It fits to the Finno – Ugric language family, which also includes Finnish and Hungarian. Thus, the difference between the Indo-European languages such as German, Russian, French, Spanish, Italian or English is originally as distant as English is from Arabic.\n\nEstonian language is also divided into the Northern and the Southern dialects. Turtu, the Northern Estonian, is spoken mostly in the big cities including Tallin while Seto and Võro dialects are used in the Southern regions of the country.\n\nIn order to produce a precise, accurate and culturally correct translation from Estonian into English or from English into Estonian, a translator should first recognize the dialect that your document is written in and, of course, be familiar with the dialect.\n\nEstonian translation industries\n\nThe Estonian translators hired by Apoling Solutions possess excellent linguistic skills, are native speakers of Estonian language and ATA certified. Most of them are also experts of specific translation industries such as:\n\n– Estonian Legal translation\n\n– Estonian Medical Translation\n\n– Estonian Financial translations\n\n– Estonian Personal Document translation\n\n– Estonian Technical translation\n\n– Estonian Interpreting services\n\n– Estonian document translation\n\nDocument translation from Estonian into English\n\nAfter completion a deep study of our clients – the Estonian immigrants inhabited different corners of the world and the USA, American citizens and needs of small businesses and corporations, we’ve made a decision to focus on translating the below listed documents that you or your business entity may require sooner or later:\n\n– Birth Certificate translation from Estonian\n\n– Marriage Certificate translation from Estonian\n\n– Divorce Certificate translation from Estonian\n\n– Death Certificate translation from Estonian\n\n– Estonian Passport translation\n\n– Estonian Driver License translation\n\n– Personal Letters translation from Estonian\n\n– Estonian Power of Attorney translation\n\n– Bank Statement translation from Estonian\n\n– Medical Exam Report translation from Estonian\n\n– Immunization Book translation from Estonian\n\n– Medical History translation from Estonian\n\n– Diploma translation from Estonian\n\n– Transcript translation from Estonian\n\n– Academic Record translation from Estonian\n\n– Course description translation from Estonian\n\n– Tax Documents translation from Estonian\n\n– Corporate Document translation from Estonian\n\n– Business Contracts translation from Estonian\n\n– Partnership Agreement translation from Estonian\n\n– By-laws translation from Estonian\n\n– Technical Documents translation from Estonian\n\n– Scientific Research Papers translation from Estonian\n\nApoling Solutions is a corporate member of the American Translators Association, and certified translations of important documents done in our office are accepted by immigration authorities, schools and universities, evaluation centers, banks, mortgage companies, official and private authorities.\n\nDocuments for use in Estonia\n\nEstonia is a party of the Hague Convention (also known as the Apostille Treaty). Accordingly, any document that you intend to submit with the Estonian official institutions should be appropriately legalized in an Estonian Consulate or bear an Apostille Stamp. Without these steps, your documents might be denied acceptance.\n\nWe know the legal requirements regarding document preparation for use in Estonia. Our Apostille agents will obtain an Apostille Stamp in a proper department; our professional Estonian translators will translate your documents and certify the translations. By passing to our Mobile Notaries and Estonian translators the task of your document legalization, you are ensured that you will have no complications with Estonian official and government agencies.\n\nU.S. document translation into Estonian language\n\nIf you applied for the Estonian citizenship for your child born in the U.S. or spouse who you married in the United States, you would be asked by the Consulate of Estonia to provide certified legalized translations of the supportive documents, priory authenticated by apostille and translated into Estonian language. Such translations must bear a certification letter (in Estonian language) provided by a translation agency or a translator, indicating that a USA document’s translation from English into Estonian is complete and exact and attesting to his or her competence as a translator.\n\nIf you need assistance with the translation of your American documents into Estonian language, we’ll gladly assist you with the translations, completed by the native speakers and authenticated by the U.S. authorities in accordance with the requirements of the Consulate of Estonia or Estonia competent authorities.\n\nHow to order Estonian translation services\n\nWe always welcome our customers and are really glad to meet all of you in person, in our translation agency in Brooklyn, NY.
