        "text": "Estonian is the native language of the Republic of Estonia, where it is spoken by about one million people, or two-thirds of the total population.\n\nEstonian is one of the Finno-Ugric languages, which constitute a branch of the Uralic language family. Its closest relative is Finnish, spoken across the Gulf of Finland. The two languages are sufficiently similar to be mutually intelligible, at least for those Estonians who speak the dialect of the north. Estonian is not, as is sometimes thought, in any way related to its nearest geographic neighbors, Latvian and Lithuanian.\n\nLike Latvian and Lithuanian, Estonian employs the Roman script. The alphabet lacks the letters c, q, w, x, y, z, but contains the letter õ, found in no other language of eastern Europe. Umlauts may appear over the letters a, o, and u.\n\nLet me hold your hands in resignation,\n\nSoldier, whom this mortal strife must take.\n\nSoon my hands will fold in supplication\n\nFor your own and all your comrades' sake.\n\nNow your changing face is even dearer.\n\nI recall you as a schoolboy when\n\nYou first left me. Come, dear child, come nearer!\n\nYou have grown mature in wood and fen.\n\nYet your vivid eyes are still ingenuous,\n\nThough they must have witnessed what is vile\n\nThings that men will do when life is strenuous\n\nAnd resorts to cruelty and guile.\n\nDo not stand there rigid and unspeaking;\n\nIn your glance are things that cry for breath.\n\nWhich of those two lords of man is seeking\n\nTo command your valor, Life or Death?\n\nMARIE UNDER, Soldier's Mother"
