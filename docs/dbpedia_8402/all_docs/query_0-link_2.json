        "text": "Seto (seto kiil')\n\nSeto is spoken mainly in the Setomaa region of southeast Estonia. It is classified as a dialect of South Estonian, or as a dialect of Eastern Võro, however the Seto people (Setokõsõq) consider themselves culturally distinct from the Võro people (Võrokõsõq). In 2011 there were about 12,500 speakers of Seto, most of whom are older people. Younger people are more likely to speak Estonian.\n\nPeople started writing Seto during the early 21st century. There is no standard way to do so, and each writer has their own spelling system. Some spelling systems are based on Estonian, others are based on Võro.\n\nThere is a weekly news program on the radio in Seto, and the language is used to some extent in newspapers and books. There is also a strong tradition of singing in Seto, particularly of choral singing, which is known as leelo.\n\nSeto alphabet\n\nDownload an alphabet chart for Seto (Excel)\n\nSample text in Seto\n\nKõik inemiseq sünnüseq avvo ja õiguisi poolõst ütesugumaidsist.
