        "text": "Information on command of languages was collected through the population and housing census survey from the end of 2021 to the beginning of 2022. Responses to the questions on languages spoken are generalisable to the whole population aged 3 and over (data on language command was not collected for children under the age of 3). A person is deemed to speak the language if his or her language skills enable him/her to manage with speaking, writing, and reading in familiar language use situations. The census data are collected as of 31.12.2021 and therefore do not include war refugee data.\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, 76% of the inhabitants of Estonia, i.e. 975,320 people, speak a foreign language. In the 2011 census, 69% of the population (856,225 people) spoke a foreign language, up from 64% (851,639) in 2000. The number of foreign language speakers has therefore increased steadily over the last three censuses.\n\nOne in two inhabitants of Estonia with command of foreign languages speak one foreign language (48%) and one in three speak two (35%). Of those with command of foreign languages, 13% speak three and 3% speak at least four foreign languages. The proportion of people speaking one and two foreign languages has gone up (43% and 34%, respectively, in 2011), while the proportion of those speaking three and four foreign languages has decreased slightly (17% and 5%).\n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken foreign language in Estonia\n\nThe proportion of foreign language speakers is highest in Viimsi, lowest in Sillamäe city\n\nCommand of foreign languages is fairly equal between the sexes – 74% of men and 73% of women speak a foreign language. However, there are large differences between age groups. The share of foreign language speakers is highest among 15–29-year-olds, with 90% of them speaking a foreign language. The percentage of foreign language speakers is lowest among people aged 65 and over (68%) and understandably also in the youngest age group, i.e. among 3–14-year-olds (48%).\n\nThe municipality with the highest percentage of foreign language speakers is Viimsi rural municipality (87%), followed by Jõelähtme rural municipality (85%), and Rae and Saue rural municipalities (84% each). “For comparison, 81% of the population in Tallinn and 82% in Tartu city speak a foreign language. The municipalities of Ida-Viru county have a lower-than-average percentage of foreign language speakers. For example, in Narva and Sillamäe, 36% and 32% of the population, respectively, speak a foreign language,” said Osila.\n\nEstonian as a foreign language is most often spoken by Finns\n\n84% of the population speak Estonian\n\nShare of language speakers in age groups, 2021\n\nInformation on command of languages was collected through the population and housing census from the end of 2021 to the beginning of 2022. Nearly half of the total population participated in the survey, and the breakdowns were calculated taking into account the people who refused to answer the question. The aim of the survey was to find estimates for the questions asked. A more detailed description of the survey can be found in the methodology document.\n\nFor more information on command of languages collected during the population census, visit rahvaloendus.ee. The data are published in the statistical database.\n\nSee also:\n\nResults\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor further information:\n\nHelen Maria Raadik\n\nMedia Relations Manager\n\nMarketing and Dissemination Department\n\nStatistics Estonia\n\nTel +372 625 9181\n\npress [at] stat.ee\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"
