        "text": "IU is the only university in the United States that regularly teaches Estonian. In addition to becoming proficient in Estonian at IU, you can also study Estonia in depth by choosing a Major or Minor in Central Eurasian Studies.\n\nEstonia is a North European country on the Baltic Sea, a member of the Euro zone and NATO, a uniquely free market economy. Estonia is known for high levels of IT: e-government, i-voting, mobile-ID and a free Wi-Fi access point never far away.\n\nThe fascinating history of breathtaking twists and turns, knights, kings and czars left their legacy, while Estonians kept their ancient language and a treasure trove of olklore and became a modern European culture and state. If you know some German, Swedish or Russian, you will recognize influences in the culture and language.\n\nLearning Estonian is a sure way to make your CV stand out, win scholarships, and become an instant celebrity with the Estonians - get yourself an invitation to the magical Midsummer Night bonfire deep in the woods or on the seashore!"
