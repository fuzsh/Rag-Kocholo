        "text": "Kraasna in 5 questions\n\n1) Who are the Kraasna Estonians?\n\nThe Kraasna Estonians were a small group of Estonian speaking people, who settled in the region of Krasnogorodsk – hence the name Kraasna – roughly 150 kilometres south-east of the Republic of Estonia. Their cultural and linguistic origins lie within the South Estonian Seto community, who is nowadays living in Setomaa, a small stretch of land along the southern Estonian-Russian border. The Kraasna Estonians have kept many of their pagan beliefs and practices, even under strong influence from their Russian neighbours. Most of the Kraasna Estonians worked as unskilled labour in agriculture.\n\n2) How are the Kraasna Estonians’ language and standard Estonian related?\n\nThe language of the Kraasna Estonians is considered a sub-dialect of the South Estonian dialect of Estonian. That means, that the ancestors of the Kraasna Estonians spoke South Estonian before their own dialect developed from a common South Estonian language. In a statistical survey (Pajusalu 1997), the overlap of the dialect and the modern Estonian literary language concerning vocabulary and grammar was found to be only 13,3%. This makes the Kraasna dialect one of the most distant dialects – speakers of the standard Estonian language can understand texts in the Kraasna dialect only with difficulties, while they are more easily readable by speakers of South Estonian.\n\n3) How do we know about the Kraasna Estonians?\n\nThe first information about Estonians in the Latvian-Russian border region comes from the mid-19th century. Before that, only sparse information is found about resettlement of Estonians due to the Northern Wars. The first modern survey of the Kraasna Estonians was carried out by Oskar Kallas in 1901. He wrote a comprehensive monograph on the beliefs and cultural phenomena of the Kraasna people, also including text samples. The second researcher who worked with Kraasna Estonians was the Finn Heikki Ojansuu, who visited Kraasna in 1911/12 and 1914 and collected the largest share of recordings. After Ojansuu, there were no expeditions during the World Wars, so that the next researcher to visit Kraasna arrived there in 1952 – Paulopriit Voolaine conducted field trips until the 1960s but his interest in the region ceased when he could not find any new informants for his research.\n\n4) Is Kraasna Estonian still spoken today?\n\nNo, Kraasna Estonian is not spoken anymore. The Kraasna Estonians have been thoroughly assimilated by the Russian majority. The last phonograph recording was made in 1914, the last written record of the Kraasna dialect was made in 1952, the last speaker of Estonian in the Kraasna region died in 1961.\n\n5) What does this project try to achieve?\n\nUntil recently, the state of documentation of the Kraasna dialect was not well known, documents were scattered over various archives, and only the 2014 publication of the 9th volume of a dialectal text collection series (Eesti Murded) brought the Kraasna dialect back to the agenda of Estonian dialectology. During this project, I have digitised various manuscripts and investigated original sources for links between them – on the one hand, this shall enable further studies of the Kraasna dialect, on the other hand, it shall also generate interest in this dialect and promote future research about the dialect and its speakers. Therefore, all materials created during the project are accessible on this site with additional resources and information tailored to the needs of various interested parties and possible uses.\n\nGlossary\n\nThe links are leading to external websites holding more information on the topics. [For a more differentiated, scientific discussion of these terms and concepts, consider the scholarly literature and scientific publications]\n\nBaltic – a) geographical term describing the area of the three Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania; b) Baltic languages (belonging to the Indo-European language family) include Latvian and Lithuanian, Estonian is not considered a Baltic language but belongs to the Finnic languages\n\nBaltic-Finnic – see Finnic\n\ncorpus – an (electronic) database of language data, usually structured and with several layers of additional (linguistic) information added. In the case of this project, the language data is written, and without any additional information (so far).\n\ndialect – a regionally delimited variety of a language\n\nEstonian – a Finnic language spoken primarily in the Republic of Estonia, with roughly 1 million speakers.

A similar project has been carried out for the Lutsi sub-dialect.\n\nmaarahvas – “rural population”, a term used by Estonians as a self-designation in former times\n\nmanuscript – a hand-written source of text\n\nMulgi – one of the South Estonian dialects\n\nNorthern Estonian – a main dialect of Estonian spoken in the northern parts of Estonia; had a strong influence on the creation of the literary language\n\nparish – Estonian kihelkond; a term referring to the influence sphere of a church which coincides with dialectal boundaries (in the case of Estonian); the term is used to classify and locate dialects\n\nphonograph recording – an audio recording produced by using a phonograph; the recording medium is a cylinder of wax onto which the recording is engraved.\n\nSeto – one of the South Estonian dialects, presumably the origin of the Kraasna Estonians\n\nStandard Estonian – the standardised form of Estonian with a set of codified grammatical and orthographic rules; it was created in the beginning of the 20th century using features of both main dialects (Northern and Southern Estonian)\n\nSouth Estonian – a main dialect of Estonian spoken in the south-eastern parts of Estonia and in bordering regions of Russia and Latvia. South Estonian developed independently from North Estonian, hence it can be seen as an individual language. Only due to political developments, it is considered a dialect of Estonian. It is usually divided into 3 or 4 dialects (Mulgi, Tarto, Võro, Seto). Kraasna is a sub-dialect of the Seto dialect.\n\nsub-dialect – a term used to refer to a regionally more limited, smaller variety than a dialect; either referring to the variety of a parish or a village\n\ntranscription – the written representation of spoken language, UPA mostly used for Uralic languages\n\nUralic – the language family containing Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic\n\nvariety – neutral term for language/dialect; a variety represents an instance of similar language produced by a specific set of people (regionally, socially differentiated) or for a specific purpose (e.g. officialese)."
