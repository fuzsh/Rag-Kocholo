        "text": "Across the globe, there are millions of people who can speak English, but only one million speak Estonian. The language is part of the Finno-Ugric group, related to Finnish and Hungarian. Tallinn University’s summer course in Estonian Language and Culture offers an opportunity to study an unusual and entrancing language, all amongst the backdrop of a well-preserved medieval city. The course aims to familiarize a wide range of international students not only with the Estonian language but also with the country’s rich culture, history, art and lifestyle.\n\nAfter a short written test, students will be divided into groups based on their initial proficiency in the Estonian language. The number of groups depends on the number of participants, usually, there are 5-7 groups. Please note that participants in one group might have slightly different levels, more advanced students can ask for additional tasks.\n\nThe courses will then foster skills at the following levels:\n\nBeginner – students will develop basic Estonian communication skills and master day-to-day conversation. The course programme includes pronunciation practice, listening comprehension and easy communication.\n\nIntermediate – students will further develop their speaking, listening, reading, writing and grammar skills. The students should be familiar with basic Estonian structures. The course programme includes activities on various everyday-life situations.\n\nThe languages of instruction are Estonian and English and course materials are distributed during the course."
