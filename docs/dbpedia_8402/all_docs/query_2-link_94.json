        "text": "Tallinn (the capital of Estonia) is only about 50 miles south of Helsinki (the capital of Finland) across the Gulf of Finland —a branch of the Baltic Sea. It takes less than 3 hours to travel by ferry.\n\nThe geographical proximity of Estonia and Finland raises the question of whether their respective languages —Estonian and Finnish— are similar, and if so, then to what extent.\n\nFinnish and Estonian are among the very few languages spoken in Europe which do not belong to the Indo-European family of languages.\n\nThis is a very significant fact, because of how large the Indo-European family is. It includes for instance:\n\nthe Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish, ..)\n\nthe Germanic languages (English, German, Dutch, ..)\n\nthe Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, ..)\n\nthe Celtic languages (Irish, Welsh, Breton, .. )\n\nthe Indo-Iranian languages (Hindi, Persian, Sanskrit ..)\n\nFinnish and Estonian both belong to the Uralic family of languages. The Uralic languages are not part of the Indo-European family of languages.\n\nBesides Finnish and Estonian, the Uralic languages also include Hungarian and some others which are less known (such as Mansi and Khanty).\n\nLinguistically, Finnish and Estonian are closer to each other than they are to other Uralic languages such as Hungarian.\n\nThis is because Finnish and Estonian are both part of the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages, while Hungarian is part of the Ugric branch.\n\nWhile Finnish and Estonian have a lot of similar vocabulary words (which we will see), in the case of Finnish and Hungarian the vocabulary is much less similar.\n\nAlthough Estonia is included in the Baltic states (because of its geographic location) its language (Estonian) is not classified by linguists as a Baltic language.\n\nThe Baltic languages (which include Lithuanian, Latvian) are part of the Indo-European family of languages.\n\nFinnish and Estonian: similarities and differences in vocabulary\n\nFinnish and Estonian vocabulary words which are identical\n\nFinnish and Estonian are similar, and closely related languages. As a result, there are many vocabulary words which are identical between the two languages.\n\nHere is a list of Finnish and Estonian words which are the same:\n\nTable: Finnish - Estonian identical words English Estonian Finnish water vesi vesi moon kuu kuu money raha raha tree puu puu snow lumi lumi hand käsi käsi expensive kallis kallis sea meri meri\n\nFinnish and Estonian vocabulary words which are similar\n\nThere are many words in Finnish and Estonian, which although not identical are quite similar.\n\nHere is a list of Finnish and Estonian words which are similar:\n\nTable: Finnish - Estonian similar words English Estonian Finnish today täna tänään kiss suudlus suudella river jõgi joki belief usk usko night öö yö bird lind lintu peace rahu rauha eye silm silmä laugh naerma nauraa shoes kingad kengät clean puhas puhdas\n\nNotice the letter 'õ' in the Estonian word «jõgi»: that letter exists in Estonian but not in Finnish.\n\nFinnish and Estonian vocabulary words that are completely different\n\nSince Finnish and Estonian are different languages (and not different dialects of the same language) there are also many vocabulary words that are completely different between them.\n\nHere is a list of Finnish and Estonian words which are very different:\n\nTable: Finnish - Estonian different words English Estonian Finnish smile naerata hymy house maja talo art kunst taide book raamat kirja computer arvuti tietokone easy lihtne helppo privacy privaatsus yksityisyys silence vaikus hiljaisuus slow aeglane hidas smart tark fiksu seasons aastaajad vuodenajat vegetables köögiviljad vihannekset important oluline tärkeä telephone telefon puhelin love armastus rakkaus\n\nLooking at these words which are different between Estonian and Finnish, we notice that some of the Estonian words are similar to German words (for example “kunst”, “privaatsus”).\n\nThis is because Estonia was occupied by the Germans during a period of the middle ages. As a result, despite Estonian and German being languages with completely different origins, there are a number of German loanwords in Estonian.\n\nEstonian - Finnish vocabulary false friends\n\nIn the context of languages, “false friends” are words that sound similar in both languages but have completely different meanings\n\nHere are some Estonian - Finnish false friends to be careful of:\n\nA commonly known false friend is « hallitus » which means “government” in Finnish and “mold” in Estonian [1]\n\n« Kohtu » is another Estonian-Finnish false friend to be careful of: that word means “court of law” in Estonian, but in Finnish it means .. “uterus”.\n\n« Kannatus » in Estonian means “suffering”, while it means “support / endorsement” in Finnish\n\n« Kalju » means “rock / cliff” in Estonian, while in Finnish it means “bald / hairless”\n\n« Pulm » means “wedding” in Estonian, while « pulma » means “puzzle / problem” in Finnish\n\n« Halpa » means “cheap” in Finnish, while « halb » means “bad” in Estonian\n\n« Raamat » means “book” in Estonian, while « raamattu » means “bible” in Finnish\n\nFinnish and Estonian are both genderless languages\n\nAnother similarity between Estonian and Finnish is that they are both genderless languages, meaning that grammatical gender is not present in those languages.\n\nIn particular, Estonian and Finnish both use gender-neutral pronouns. The English pronouns “he” and “she” both translate to the Finnish pronoun “hän”, and to the Estonian pronoun “ta”.\n\nAs genderless languages, Estonian and Finnish nouns don’t have genders. To an English speaker, this might not seem that noteworthy, but in many European languages every noun has a gender.\n\nThis is the case with French, where remembering the gender of French nouns can be tricky for language learners.\n\nThis is even more the case in languages such as German and Norwegian where each noun has one of 3 possible genders (feminine, masculine, and neuter).\n\nEstonian and Finnish similarities in pronunciation\n\nEstonian and Finnish are both languages in which the length of vowels can change the meaning of words.\n\nFinnish distinguishes two vowel lengths (short vowels and long vowels). Estonian goes one step further and distinguishes 3 vowel lengths: in addition to short and long vowels, Estonian also has a rare \"overlong\" vowel length.\n\nIn some languages, long vowels are indicated by marks (diacritics) on those vowels. In Finnish and Estonian long vowels are indicated by doubling the vowels (writing it twice).\n\nThis is why Finnish and Estonian are languages in which so many vocabulary words have double vowels.\n\nAre Estonian and Finnish hard to learn?\n\nThe U.S. Foreign Service Institute rates languages into 4 categories, based on the time it takes for diplomats who are learning those languages to reach working proficiency.\n\nCategory I languages are those which are most similar to English and take the least amount of time to learn. These include Spanish, Norwegian, and Italian.\n\nCategory IV languages are the “Super-hard languages” which are exceptionally difficult for native English speakers to learn. These include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic.\n\nEstonian and Finnish are similar in difficulty: they are both category III languages (“hard languages”), which means that it takes about 44 weeks (1100 class hours) to reach a working proficiency in those languages.\n\nOne of the reasons why Estonian and Finnish are difficult languages for English speakers to learn is that they both have many grammatical cases. Finnish has 15 grammatical cases, and Estonian has 14.\n\nIn Finnish and Estonian, suffixes are used to indicate grammatical cases.\n\nConclusion\n\nEstonian and Finnish are both very similar languages and because they are unrelated to the Indo-European family of languages, they are very different from the languages which many of us are familiar with.\n\nWe’ll end with a quote by J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings who was also a linguist - and more precisely a philologist, meaning someone who studies the history of languages:\n\n“It [discovering Finnish] was like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before. It quite intoxicated me.”\n\n— J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nTo continue learning about the similarities and differences between Estonian and Finnish, have a look at these lists of the 1000 most common Estonian words, and the 1000 most common Finnish words.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Source\n\n[2] Source"
