Tsillokõnõ Prints — in Seto language.

The Seto language is a Finno-Ugric language, closely related to the South Estonian dialects. It is often considered a variant of the Võro language, which is another South Estonian language. Seto and Võro are both part of the larger South Estonian language group, which differs significantly from the standard Estonian spoken in most parts of the country. It is sometimes identified as a variety under Võro, or the two are described as Võro-Seto. Setos (setokõsõq) mostly inhabit the area near Estonia’s southeastern border with Russia in Setomaa, and are primarily Eastern Orthodox, while Võros (võrokõsõq) are traditionally Lutherans and live in historical Võru County.
