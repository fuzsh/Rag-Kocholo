Parking Information

The Jacob Weinberger United States courthouse is located in downtown San Diego and is close to downtown shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. In fact, the courthouse is two blocks directly west of the Westfield Horton Plaza shopping center.

No parking is available at the Weinberger courthouse. On-street parking can be difficult, but you may be able to find available parking on the streets surrounding the courthouse.

The City of San Diego charges $1.25 per hour at street-side parking meters. The parking meters near the courthouse have a two-hour time limit, and “meter feeding” to remain parked beyond the time limit may result in your vehicle beng ticketed. However, the parking spaces on G Street west of State Street have longer time limits; consult the map below.

Parking also is available in various nearby private parking lots. Prices vary according to the lot, and they can be extremely expensive.

Public Transportation

San Diego County's public transportation system, the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), makes it easy to reach the Weinberger U.S. Courthouse without parking hassles. Visit https://www.sdmts.com for more information.
