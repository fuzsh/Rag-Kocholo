Calculating the Due Date or Deadline Pursuant to the FRCP

Under amended FRCP 6 (a)(1), all deadlines stated in days, no matter the length of the period, are computed in the same way. The day of the event that triggers the deadline is not counted. All other days - including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays - are counted, with only one exception: If the period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the deadline falls on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. FRCP 6 (a)(1).

When determining the last day of a filing period stated in days, a day on which the clerk's office is not accessible because of the weather or another reason is treated like a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. FRCP 6 (a)(3).
