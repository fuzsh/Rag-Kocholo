        "text": "Greetings,\n\nCampus is buzzing with excitement as our #14 ranked Wildcats prepare to take on #10 UCLA Saturday afternoon in Tucson. The pre-game will be hosted by ESPN's \"Game Day\" crew, and the athletic department is requesting that all UA fans wear red for the \"Red Out.\"\n\nIf you would like to see the team in action, you can still buy tickets for the October 25th Homecoming game in the Arizona Law block.\n\nWe are buzzing here at the college, too, as our fall semester kicks into high gear. Last week, we hosted almost 300 alumni, friends, and employers at our Career Development Mixer. Connecting our great legal community with our great law students was bound to go well -- and it did!\n\nAnd on Monday of this week, we held our annual Constitution Day Supreme Court Review, hosted by the Rehnquist Center and moderated in his typical highly engaging and informative fashion by Professor Dave Marcus.\n\nOn Friday of this week, we offer the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Visiting Scholars Roundtable with Elisa Marchi (Italy), Magdalena Butrymowicz (Poland), Melanie Clerc (Switzerland - UN) (find out more here). We also will hold our second Law.Change presentation, by alumnus Alex Lane ('98) on Friday (register here).\n\nWe welcome alumni and friends at our events. Please take a look at the list of events at the bottom of the newsletter and join in as your schedule allows.\n\nThis week, I'm proud to introduce you to 3L student Dami Oguntade and alumna Irma Gonzalez ('73).\n\nUntil the footnotes,\n\nMarc\n\nDami Oguntade is one of our many international students. An attorney in her home country of Nigeria, Dami chose to come to Arizona Law for its innovative two-year JD admissions program, small class sizes, and collegial environment.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with our international program, students who are already trained as attorneys in their home countries can earn a JD in two years. The students begin their education as 1L students, taking the same foundational 1L courses and training as our traditional JD students. After the first year, the students have the option to essentially skip the second year and move into their 3L year.\n\nWhen I asked Dami what she enjoyed most about law school, she spoke of Arizona Law's many skills training programs.\n\n\"I enjoy being able to take practical classes that will enable me to hit the ground running after graduation. I am particularly enjoying the classes I am enrolled in this semester: Transactional Law Skills; Law, Innovation and Entrepreneurship; and the IP and Entrepreneurship clinic; as well as the new Law.Change program.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Dami hopes to work in corporate law or compliance, preferably at a top-tier firm in Phoenix or Dallas. Dami is married with an adorable two-year-old girl. She loves to cook, watch classic movies, and has recently discovered a love of hiking. Dami is also passionate about community service and always finds reasons -- and ways -- to volunteer.\n\nThis week, we begin a series on alumni who will be presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the College of Law this fall as part of our Centennial Celebration. The text of the award reads:\n\nIrma Elsa Gonzalez ('73), nominated by President George H. W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1992, became the first Mexican-American woman in the nation to be appointed as a United States District Judge.\n\nJudge Gonzalez's parents grew up on opposite sides of the Arizona-Mexico border, her father a citizen of the United States and her mother a citizen of Mexico. She moved to Arizona with her family when she was 12 and attended public schools in Tucson, accumulating multiple academic honors in high school. She earned a BA degree from Stanford University in 1970.\n\nIn an era when few women were pursuing careers in law, Gonzalez came back to Tucson to attend the University of Arizona College of Law. She earned her JD in 1973.\n\nAfter a federal court clerkship, Gonzalez devoted herself to public service. She was Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona and later held the same position in the Central District of California. She also served as a trial attorney with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Gonzalez was appointed U.S. Magistrate for the Southern District of California in 1984.\n\nAfter serving with distinction in this judicial position for seven years, she was named to the California Superior Court by Governor George Deukmejian and shortly afterward was confirmed as United States District Judge for the Southern District of California in 1992. From 2005 to 2012, Judge Gonzalez served as the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. After more than two decades of service, Judge Gonzalez retired on October 25, 2013.\n\nA pioneer in the judiciary with many firsts to her name, Judge Gonzalez is known for her integrity, her absolute fairness, and her humanity on and off the bench.\n\nJudge Gonzalez will be honored at the College of Law on October 22, 2014, at the Lifetime Achievement Award Ceremony.
