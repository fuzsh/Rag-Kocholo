        "text": "The federal judiciary's Southern District of California covers California's two southernmost counties: San Diego and Imperial counties:\n\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California serves both counties, but the courthouse is in downtown San Diego only at 325 West F Street (at the corner of F and Union Streets):\n\nLocations for 341a meetings are held at two locations: downtown San Diego and El Centro. Meetings may be held remotely through Zoom or other methods; follow the instructions in the notice sent from the courts or the trustee.\n\nOur Web site and electronic filing system (CM/ECF) are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\n\nParking Information\n\nThe Jacob Weinberger United States courthouse is located in downtown San Diego and is close to downtown shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. In fact, the courthouse is two blocks directly west of the Westfield Horton Plaza shopping center.\n\nNo parking is available at the Weinberger courthouse. On-street parking can be difficult, but you may be able to find available parking on the streets surrounding the courthouse.\n\nThe City of San Diego charges $1.25 per hour at street-side parking meters. The parking meters near the courthouse have a two-hour time limit, and “meter feeding” to remain parked beyond the time limit may result in your vehicle beng ticketed. However, the parking spaces on G Street west of State Street have longer time limits; consult the map below.\n\nParking also is available in various nearby private parking lots. Prices vary according to the lot, and they can be extremely expensive.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nSan Diego County's public transportation system, the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), makes it easy to reach the Weinberger U.S. Courthouse without parking hassles.
