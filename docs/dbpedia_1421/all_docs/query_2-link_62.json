        "text": "Huge Differences in the Number of Persons Sentenced by Individual Judges\n\nWhere Does Your Judge Rank?\n\nRobert C. Brack was confirmed as a judge for the federal district of New Mexico on July 14, 2003. He reports that in the ensuing years — almost 12 of them now — he has achieved what he views as an unfortunate record. \"By the end of 2015, if the government's criminal enforcement of the immigration laws is not substantially changed, I will have sentenced more than 15,000 individuals.\"\n\nThough looking at the full historical record of the courts on this question is difficult, Judge Brack's total count may well mean that he has sentenced more federal criminal defendants than any other federal district judge in U.S. history.\n\nBut only focusing on the last five years the judge's record for FY 2010-FY 2014 is staggering: 6,708 defendants, by far the most in the nation and nearly 2,000 more than the next judge on the list. These counts are based on the analysis of millions of records by the Transactional Records Access Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of Syracuse University.\n\nAs suggested above, Judge Brack is not proud of his distinctive record. \"It just tears at my heart,\" he said in a brief conversation with TRAC. The judge, in this and other interviews, has said he does not agree with the heavy reliance of Congress and the administration in using criminal sanctions as an important way to deal with the flood of undocumented individuals attempting to come to the United States, especially along the borders with Mexico. On the day Judge Brack was interviewed, he said one mother he had just convicted would not be able to legally return to her family in Los Angeles since she would be deported and barred from returning.\n\nWhile fully explaining the stark judge-to-judge variations is a challenge, mostly because of the many different forces always at work in shaping the day-to-day operations of the courts, one of them can mostly be ruled out as a significant factor: the personal work habits of individual judges. Thus, the explanation for Judge Brack's unique position was almost certainly determined by political, administrative and judicial forces not subject to his control.\n\nIndeed, as shown in Table 1 which lists the judges according to the number of individuals they sentenced during the past five years, judges based in the five judicial districts along the southwest border occupy the top 48 places. For example, in second place, sentencing 4,738 defendants was Judge Robert A. Junell, who served in the Western District of Texas. Three judges from the Southern District of Texas — Judge Micaela Alvarez (sentenced 4,687), Judge Randy Crane (sentenced 4,528), and Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa (sentenced (4,172) — came in third, fourth and fifth. Like Judge Brack, all serve in jurisdictions along the southwest border where criminal prosecutions for illegal re-entry are common.\n\nTable 1. Criminal Caseload for Individual Judges in District Court, Fiscal Year 2010-2014\n\n(Click column header to sort, click table title to go to the Judge Information Center)\n\nWhen you look across the rest of the federal districts in the nation, such high numbers of defendants sentenced by these judges are uncommon. Typically judges sentenced several hundred, not several thousand defendants over this five year time span.\n\nTo determine the judge-by-judge variations in the number of their sentences TRAC began by examining the records of all of the cases in the United States that reached this final stage during the five years from fiscal year 2010 to 2014. Also examined was case-by-case information obtained from the Justice Department's Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nA critical factor that partly explains Judge Brack's ranking is that he has served in a judicial district court that for many years has been in the top five when it comes to the criminal enforcement of the immigration laws by the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. But the district courts in Arizona and in the Southern District of Texas have each sentenced five times the number of defendants during this same period than has the New Mexico district court.\n\nThe records of New Mexico's federal court show there are other causes that have contributed to Judge Brack's ranking position in sentencing counts. Once criminal cases reach a given federal district court, the administrators there are responsible assigning them to the judges in a fair and even-handed way. But partly because of vast size of New Mexico, and partly due to the varying number of cases sent to the courts in different part of the state by the federal enforcement agencies depending on their location, the equalization of the caseloads is a serious challenge. Thus the huge number of immigration cases coming to Judge Brack's court, located in Las Cruces, may not be surprising.\n\nJudges with the Largest Number of Convictions for Other Case Types\n\nFor various reasons Judge Brack stands out when it comes to immigration conviction counts. But when the sentencing records of individual judges are examined by different broad categories of the cases that are dealt with by the courts — weapons, drugs, white collar crime — a more complex geographic picture emerges because of the natural variety of federal crimes in different regions.\n\nTable 2 highlights the judge or judges who have sentenced the most individuals in different types of offense categories. For drug matters alone, the judge with the largest number of sentences — 2,304 of them — is Robert A. Junell of the Western District of Texas, with his court in Midland.\n\nLooking at weapons cases in the last five year there was a tie in the Eastern District of North Carolina, with Judge Terrance W. Boyle and Judge Louise Flanagan both being credited with 224 individuals sentenced. (The major city in the eastern district is Raleigh.)\n\nThe judge sentencing the largest number of white-collar offenders (356) was Judge Juan M. Perez-Gimenez in Puerto Rico. Judge Walter S. Smith, Jr. in the Western District of Texas sentenced the highest number (95) of government regulatory offenders. While Judge Sandra L. Townes who serves in the Eastern District of New York sentenced the largest number (64) involved in organized crime.\n\nJudge Roberto A. Lange in South Dakota made the list for sentencing the most in \"other\" crime categories, handling a large number of assault cases by or against native Americans.\n\nIn addition to the criminal tool on which the numbers in this TRAC Report are based, the Judge Information Center includes tools that allow users to examine the caseloads of the district court judges on civil matters, as well as asylum denial rates for administrative Immigration Court judges."
