        "text": "Pamela Medina asks for your support and vote for Judge of Harris County Probate Court No. 2, as the imminently qualified and compassionate candidate.\n\nPamela was licensed by the Texas Supreme Court in 2007. She is the owner of Medina Law Texas, PLLC. Her practice areas include estate planning, estate administration, trusts, guardianships, probate litigation and general civil litigation.\n\nPamela Medina began her legal career as a law clerk with the 269th Civil District Court in Harris County. Pamela drafted legal memoranda, performed legal research and analysis of statutory law and legal precedent, conferred with the judge to prepare for hearings and worked with the judge during court proceedings.\n\nFollowing that, and prior to establishing her law firm, Pamela Medina was a Vice President at Cadence Bank, N.A., in their corporate trusts and estates asset management division. Pamela provided personal trust administration and financial planning to middle to high-net-worth individuals and families. She also provided trust administration for trusts created by probate and state district courts after the trust beneficiary was deemed incapacitated or was a minor. Pamela Medina also served as estate administrator, either by testamentary bequest or by court appointment.\n\nPamela Medina is a proud native Houstonian. Her mother, Vera Vasquez, is from Fifth Ward and her father, Ralph Vasquez, is from Second Ward. Pamela attended the Gifted and Talented Vanguard program in Houston public schools. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the University of Texas, in Austin -Texasâ flagship university. Pamela spent six years teaching in the Houston Independent School District, initially teaching children with special needs and coaching teachers on inclusion modalities, then teaching bilingual students.\n\nFollowing that, Pamela followed her life dream and obtained her juris doctorate. She graduated cum laude, from Thurgood Marshall School of Law, an historically black college or university, where the law school held the distinction of being the most diverse in the nation.\n\nPamela loves coordinating gatherings and community service projects with her large family, the Vasquez clan. She loves Facetiming along with her husband of six years, David, with their children, Ashley and Auggie, Milan In Madrid, Spain and grandchild, August, and Astros home games with their sons, Adam, Vincent and Wayne. Her passions include voter education and outreach, supporting access for all to strong educational opportunities and mentoring law students.\n\nPamela Medina is imminently qualified to serve as your judge. She is a strict adherent to the rule of law and has an unbiased approach to legal issues. Pamelaâs calming and patient nature will provide great judicial temperament. She has a keen ability to listen with compassion and an attention to detail. Pamelaâs intellect, demeanor and compassion are much needed in the probate court where often the parties are experiencing a difficult life event - coping with a lost loved one, or a family member needing court intervention due to their diminished capacity and consequent need for substantial care and support.\n\nPamela strives to live out her childhood role model's words: \"It is a privilege to serve people, a privilege that must be earned, once earned, there is an obligation to do something good with it.\" Barbara Jordan\n\nPamela Medina asks for your support and your vote. She is the imminently qualified and compassionate candidate ready to serve Harris County and to make history as the first probate judge in Harris County to be Latina and bilingual."
