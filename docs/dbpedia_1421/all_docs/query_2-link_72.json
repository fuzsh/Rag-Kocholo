        "text": "Good afternoon! I want to begin by welcoming all our faculty and staff, family and friends, alumni, and of course, my fellow 2023 graduates to such a joyous event.\n\nI am humbled to have this distinct opportunity to speak with you and celebrate our achievements.\n\nTake a moment to look around the room. Each of us sitting here today took a chance on ourselves.\n\nSome of you decided it was time for a career change. Some saw the possibility to further your education in a country of opportunities (and by country, I mean Texas). And others wanted to diversify their skills and continue reaching for the stars. Each of us had a different journey, with unique challenges. However, the fruits of hard labor are always the sweetest of all pleasures, and today, we get to indulge.\n\nI graduated from UTD back in 2019 with my bachelor’s as a first-generation college graduate, and clearly, I couldn’t get enough. So here I am back for round two. I know some of you can relate to being back on campus, and if you can’t, think about going for seconds at Thanksgiving. Same satisfaction. You just can’t get enough!\n\nOver the course of my five-and-a-half years at UTD, I’ve endured and learned quite a bit. So today I’m here to give you the SparkNotes or CliffsNotes version of three recommendations in hopes that you will take away at least one piece of advice.\n\nNo. 1: Be resilient and persevere through the difficult times no matter how much you want to give up. Life is not meant to be a cakewalk, and each of us will undoubtedly encounter some form of challenge to overcome. Believe in yourself, trust yourself and lean on those around you. Mistakes will happen along the way, but they have the power to turn you into something better than you were before.\n\nNo. 2: Imposter syndrome doesn’t define you. It takes a lot mentally and physically to overcome the constant doubts of not being good enough, the worry of being “caught” as a phony, or the fear of failure. I’ll be the first to admit I’ve felt it at some point during my formal education, especially after switching career paths and doing a complete 180. It’s one thing to think and feel these thoughts, but it’s another to truly believe it. Here’s what I do believe. I believe I wasn’t an imposter then, and I am not an imposter now, and neither are any of you.\n\nNo. 3: Be kind, compassionate, and always remember your humble beginnings. With every future interaction you have, remember to share kindness in your words and actions because they have a significant impact. They have the potential to make or break you. Give graciously, support one another because we are all on the same team, and remember to stay true to your roots and core values.\n\nI encourage you all today to reflect on your journey, remember those who have left an imprint on you. Remember our wonderful faculty and staff, who were dedicated to helping us succeed. Remember your friends, with whom you spent late hours studying together for exams. Finally, remember your loving family members, who have made incredible sacrifices for us to be here today and the love and support they have given us every step of the way.\n\nI want to dedicate this speech to my parents, Mohsin and Samina Hemani, and my best friend and older brother, Zain Hemani. They didn’t even know I was going to be speaking today, so I’m sure they are still shocked. Thank you for all the sacrifices you have made for me. This achievement is just as much as yours as it is mine. Let’s all take a moment and turn to our families and friends in the audience and wave, thanking them for what they have done to make today possible for each of us.\n\nGraduates, today marks the beginning of a new chapter in our lives and an opportunity to leave a lasting legacy. We leave here today with our degrees in hand and ready to conquer what comes at us. I believe each of us has the chance to create something bigger, better and brighter.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2023, and best of luck in your endeavors. Thank you.\n\nMariam Hemani began her journey at UT Dallas in 2015, when she enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in health care studies program as a first-generation college student. After graduating in 2019, she enrolled in the Master of Science in information technology and management. She is graduating today as a scholar with high distinction, along with a certificate in cybersecurity. She has served on the Graduate Dean’s Council in the Naveen Jindal School of Management and as a Student Government senator, worked diligently within the Dallas County court system as a Court Appointed Special Advocate volunteer for children in foster care, and served as a leading alumna of Kappa Alpha Theta fraternity. Today marks the beginning of her career in IT and cybersecurity. She says she will passionately work as a servant leader in this rapidly evolving industry. She is committed to delivering high-quality, secure and accessible solutions that will benefit everyone."
