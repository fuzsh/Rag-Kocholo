        "text": "Parking Near U.S. District Court Southern District of California\n\nWith the help of SpotHero, enjoy the convenience of booking a parking spot ahead of time, ensuring you have a space waiting for you when you get to U.S. District Court Southern District of California.\n\nTo get started, select the timeframe you wish to book parking for, find your ideal spot on the map, and head to checkout to complete your reservation!\n\nFAQs\n\nHow does SpotHero work?\n\nSpotHero is a parking reservation service. We partner with different facilities nationwide to provide you with tons of parking options and premium rates.\n\nWhile SpotHero does not own or operate any of these locations, we do work very closely with the operators we partner with to ensure you have a seamless parking experience every time you park!\n\nDo I have to enter and exit at exactly the time listed on my reservation?\n\nSimilar to how a hotel reservation works, you can enter at any time after the start time listed on your SpotHero reservation, and you can depart at any time prior to the end time listed on your reservation.\n\nFor example, if your reservation goes from 8 am to 8 pm, you can enter any time after 8 am, and must leave anytime before 8 pm. Please be aware that any time spent parked outside of your reservation is subject to a ticket, tow, or an additional charge (at the drive-up rate) from the parking facility.\n\nWhat if I have another question?\n\nYou can check out our FAQ page to see if something has already been asked.\n\nOur Customer Heroes are here to help, as well. If you would like to report an issue please reach out to our Hero team either by phone (312) 566-7768, or email – support@spothero.com for a prompt resolution.\n\nPlease note – If you have already made a reservation, please have either the Rental ID number (located in the confirmation email) or the email address you used to book handy to help us quickly locate your information."
