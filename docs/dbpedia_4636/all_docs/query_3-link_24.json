        "text": "Which characters are in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero? We’ve seen so many versions of Dragon Ball fighting games over the years. Starting with the Budokai series which began back in 2002, transitioning into a 3D arena with Budokai Tenkaichi (named Sparkling in Japan), before taking the series to the esports scene with Dragon Ball FighterZ.\n\nFortunately, the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero release date is only two months away, and there’s still plenty to look forward to. Dragon Ball Sparking Zero follows on from Budokai Tenkaichi, introducing a new entry to the fighting game series since 2010. Unlike past entries, this new title uses the Japanese name across the world. The Sparkling series is known for its massive and diverse roster of characters, with Budokai Tenkaichi 3 (or Sparkling! Meteor) featuring 96 characters and over 161 transformations.\n\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero characters list\n\nHere are the confirmed characters in the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero roster so far, in release order:\n\nBase Goku (Super and Z – Early, Mid, End)\n\nSuper Saiyan 1-3 Goku (Z – Mid and End)\n\nSuper Saiyan God Goku (Super)\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku (Super)\n\nBase Vegeta (Super and Z – Scouter, Mid, End)\n\nGreat Ape Vegeta\n\nSuper Vegeta (Z – Mid)\n\nSuper Saiyan 1-2 Vegeta (Super and Z Early and End)\n\nMajin Vegeta\n\nSuper Saiyan God Vegeta (Super)\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan Vegeta (Super)\n\nBroly (Super)\n\nLegendary Super Saiyan Broly (Super)\n\nSuper Saiyan Broly Full Power (Super)\n\nSuper Saiyan Trunks\n\nSuper Saiyan Future Trunks (Super)\n\nCell (Perfect)\n\nMajin Buu\n\nFrieza\n\nJiren\n\nDBS Android 17\n\nAndroid 18\n\nPiccolo\n\nKrillin\n\nYamcha\n\nTien\n\nHercule\n\nBergamo\n\nMaster Roshi Max Power\n\nNappa\n\nBurter\n\nJeice\n\nHit\n\nSuper Saiyan Kale (Berserk)\n\nToppo\n\nDyspo\n\nKakunsa\n\nKid Trunks\n\nSuper Saiyan Kid Trunks\n\nCaulifa\n\nSuper Saiyan Caulifa\n\nGoten\n\nSuper Saiyan Goten\n\nKale\n\nSuper Saiyan Kale\n\nGotenks\n\nSuper Saiyan 1-3 Gotenks\n\nKefla\n\nSuper Saiyan Kefla\n\nVegito\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan Vegito\n\nGogeta (Super)\n\nSuper Saiyan Gogeta (Super)\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan Gogeta (Super)\n\nFused Zamasu\n\nCorrupted Fused Zamasu\n\nUltra Instinct Goku (Super)\n\nSuper Saiyan 2 Adult Gohan\n\nGolden Frieza\n\nBardock\n\nRaditz\n\nGoku Black\n\nZamasu\n\nFull Power Jiren\n\nUltra Instinct -Sign- Goku (Super)\n\nSuper Vegito\n\nYajirobe\n\nDabura\n\nSpopovich\n\nSuper Saiyan Rosé Goku Black\n\nFuture Trunks\n\nRibrianne\n\nRoasie\n\nAnilaza\n\nNail\n\nFirst Form Frieza (Z)\n\nSecond Form Frieza (Z)\n\nThird Form Frieza (Z)\n\nForth Form Frieza (Z)\n\nFull Power Frieza (Z)\n\nChiaotzu\n\nSaibaman\n\nZarbon\n\nSuper Zarbon\n\nDodoria\n\nCui\n\nGinyu\n\nRecoome\n\nGuldo\n\nBase Goku (Super and Z – Early, Mid, End)\n\nYou couldn’t have a Dragon Ball game without regular old Goku in his base form, and fortunately, Sparkling Zero features four versions of Base Goku. Just like the previous Budokai Tenkaichi games, each character variation features a unique move set, albeit with some slight tweaks. The version of Goku at the beginning of Z is drastically different from the man we see at the start of Super, both in terms of moves and abilities.\n\nSuper Saiyan 1-3 Goku (Z – Mid and End)\n\nThe first appearance of Super Saiyan 1 Goku is a separate form in this game, alongside Goku in all three Super Saiyan forms at the end of Z. The differentiating factors between Goku on Namek and his usual SSJ form include his ripped outfit and, surprisingly enough, the way physics is applied to his hair. Though nothing is stopping him from using these forms in Super, Goku is rarely seen using his golden-haired power-ups in the latest series.\n\nSuper Saiyan God Goku (Super)\n\nThe red-haired Super Saiyan God form is largely ignored these days in favor of SSGSS, but that’s not to say SSG is completely useless. In the case of Goku, we know he has access to several special abilities only ever seen in the Dragon Ball Super: Broly movie, including the God Bind which can briefly be seen in the first trailer.\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan Goku (Super)\n\nGoku appears in his Super Saiyan Blue form, or Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (SSGSS) as it’s more commonly known, for the first time in the Budokai Tenkaichi series. Part of the announcement trailer showed SSGSS Goku getting pummeled by Broly, so we can expect to see some of Goku’s more modern attacks make it in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.\n\nBase Vegeta (Super and Z – Scouter, Mid, End)\n\nBase Vegeta makes his debut in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, but this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. What should be surprising is the inclusion of Vegeta with his iconic scouter, debuting a less-skilled version of the proud Saiyan. The trailer gave us a glimpse of Vegeta parrying a ki beam, sending it flying into the distance, destroying part of the battlefield. We also see Vegeta attack Goku using Final Burst Cannon, a large purple ki beam that Goku easily teleports past.\n\nGreat Ape Vegeta\n\nGet your hands on a giant-sized character with Great Ape Vegeta, providing you with access to a massive monster that can rip through the stage elements with ease. These giant characters were nowhere near as large as they are in Sparkling Zero, so it’ll be interesting to see how they stack up against the rest of the cast this time around.\n\nSuper Vegeta (Z – Mid)\n\nDragon Ball Sparkling Zero’s roster is so granular that it breaks down individual forms of Super Saiyan, including Super Vegeta, a self-proclaimed title from the Prince of Saiyans. It’s important to note that this version of Vegeta is different from both Super Saiyan 1 and 2. It’s an in-between form that only featured once in Dragon Ball Z. The version of Vegeta was used against Imperfect Cell, though it has some downsides, like increased muscle mass that slows the user down.\n\nSuper Saiyan 1-2 Vegeta (Super and Z Early and End)\n\nUnlike Goku, Vegeta has used his Super Saiyan form a few times in Dragon Ball Super, and we see two variations from Z at the beginning and end. Vegeta never appeared to reach Super Saiyan 3, leaving him stuck at Super Saiyan 2 as his highest peak when it comes to the legendary form.\n\nMajin Vegeta\n\nArguably, this is Vegeta in his most villainous form. After years of settling down with a family, learning to treat his former enemies as friends, and learning to work with Goku, Vegeta goes against everything he has worked towards in favor of Babadi’s instant power upgrade. Upon receiving the Majin mark on his forehead, Majin Vegeta immediately blasts away hundreds of tournament attendees to force Goku to fight him. Expect Majin Vegeta to have access to his Final Explosion attack to take down powerful enemies.\n\nSuper Saiyan God Vegeta (Super)\n\nFor a good few years, there was some confusion about whether Vegeta ever achieved Super Saiyan God form, but fans finally received confirmation in the Dragon Ball Super: Broly movie. The animation as Vegeta transforms from Super Saiyan into a Super Saiyan God has been taken directly from the film, and you can expect a number of his attacks to be lifted from his fight scene against an aggressive Broly.\n\nSuper Saiyan God Super Saiyan Vegeta (Super)\n\nAnother character variation, this time the debut of Vegeta’s SSGSS form. Hardcore Dragon Ball fans will know that this isn’t Vegeta’s final form, but it’s unclear just how far Sparkling Zero will go into the series’ lore. The trailer shows Vegeta getting ready to perform his Final Flash attack just as Goku readies his Kamehameha. The two beams collide, and here’s where you would expect a classic beam clash to play out.\n\nBroly (Super)\n\nWe are truly in the next generation of Budokai Tenkaichi games now as we get our first glimpse of Broly from the Dragon Ball Super movie. Broly comes equipped with his iconic grab where he smashes his opponent into the ground repeatedly. This doesn’t necessarily rule out the variation of Broly from the Dragon Ball Z movies, and it really wouldn’t surprise us given the number of characters these games usually have.\n\nLegendary Super Saiyan Broly (Super)\n\nUnsurprisingly, we get a chance to see Broly transform into the Legendary Super Saiyan we always knew he could be. Sadly, we don’t get to see him in action at all, but he most likely has access to his movie moveset, including his Gigantic Breath ki blast and more.\n\nSuper Saiyan Future Trunks\n\nFuture Trunks, the time-traveling fighter, equipped with his father’s Saiyan armor, joins the Sparkling cast. While it’s always difficult to recognize exact variations of characters, Future Trunks features his post-Hyperbolic Time Chamber haircut, so we’re pretty sure it’s the same Trunks that arrives after the Frieza saga.\n\nSuper Saiyan Future Trunks (Super)\n\nThis variation of Future Trunks comes from Dragon Ball Super, sporting his sword and Capsule Corp outfit. To differentiate the two versions of Trunks, it’s likely this version incorporates his sword into his moveset.\n\nPerfect Cell\n\nThere’s a glimpse of Cell in the middle of a speech in the trailer, which only makes sense for one of DBZ’s best trash-talkers. After absorbing both Android 17 and 18, Cell’s tail retracts into his body, and his form changes one last time to create Perfect Cell. Don’t be surprised if Cell’s Imperfect and Semi-Perfect forms make the roster, especially if the game’s story mode runs through this iconic saga.\n\nMajin Buu\n\nThe first form of Majin Buu, sometimes referred to as Fat Buu, is briefly shown throwing a pink substance that looks a lot like his body. Just like Cell, you should expect to see a few more forms of Majin Buu in the game, including Super Buu and Kid Buu.\n\nFrieza\n\nRemember that time Freiza blew up Namek for fun? Well, we get to see him do it again in the launch trailer. Freiza is shown in his ‘Final’ form, but we know that Golden Frieza exists in Dragon Ball Super, let alone another form that has yet to be revealed in the anime. In addition to this, Frieza’s previous forms might come to the game, featuring the villain in various shapes and sizes.\n\nJiren\n\nOne of Dragon Ball Super’s scariest villains, Jiren rarely ever talks, maybe because he does all the talking he needs to do with his fists. Jiren is one of the most powerful people in the universe, capable of bringing the Z fighters to their physical limit without ever breaking a sweat.\n\nAndroid 17 (Super)\n\nThe Androids were always threatening villains, but Android 17 in Dragon Ball Super appears to have mellowed out since the Cell saga. Along with a change of outfit, Android 17’s abilities focus primarily on protecting other people and animals. That said, he can pack a punch when required, but he’d rather avoid confrontation if possible. There are a few more versions of Android 17 we could see, including his Dragon Ball GT variant, Super 17, and first appearance as regular old Android 17 in DBZ.\n\nAndroid 18\n\nAndroid 18 is spotted in the trailer wearing her classic outfit, the same one she wore when destroying cities and killing innocent people with her twin brother. She also appears in Dragon Ball Super as Krillian’s wife, and while the question remained whether she could keep up with the rest of the Z fighters, she proved her worth in the Tournament of Power.\n\nPiccolo\n\nOnce Goku’s greatest enemy, now long-time family friend, Piccolo has one of the best character arcs in the entire series. He’s also a formidable fighter, though his strength certainly dips as we approach the beginning of Dragon Ball Super when the Saiyans start to overtake absolutely everyone. The most recent Dragon Ball movie debuted a new form for Piccolo, so with any luck that form makes it into the game.\n\nKrillin\n\nGoku’s best friend and rival, that is before Vegeta landed on Earth, Krillin is actually one of the strongest humans on the planet. Though his alien friends are capable of turning their hair golden, Krillin is no slouch either, as he’s able to throw a mean Destructo Disc when called upon.\n\nYamcha\n\nJust like Krillin, Yamcha is one of the strongest humans on Earth and is a useful ally to the Z fighters. As a martial artist, Yamcha fights primarily using standard attacks, but he also can utilize Ki in his fists to land devastating punches.\n\nTien\n\nDespite Tien’s largely human appearance, he descends from the Triclops race which is why he has a third eye in the middle of his forehead. This extra eye can be used to fire Ki blasts, and it’s been said to give Tien an advantage in battle.\n\nHercule\n\nThe biggest joke in Dragon Ball Z, Hercule is the World Martial Arts Champion, though he did not reach this role through merit alone. After bragging to a local news station about his strength, Hercule was sent to take on Majin Buu. Fortunately, he managed to convince Buu to change his ways, that was before he split himself into two and became a much larger threat than before as Super Buu.\n\nBergamo\n\nThe Budokai Tenkaichi series is known for featuring weird, offshoot characters that only briefly made an appearance in the anime. This is the first appearance of Bergamo, a large wolf-man who first appeared in Dragon Ball Super’s Tournament of Power saga. Bergamo is part of the Trio of Danger, so there’s a chance the other two wolves could be added to the roster.\n\nMaster Roshi Max Power\n\nUntil the Tower of Power tournament, we had no idea Master Roshi was capable of fighting at a high level until he was asked to show off his skills. Remember, he’s still an old man, but this old man is clearly capable of pummeling people, and he can throw a mean Kamehameha, too.\n\nNappa\n\nAs the only bald Saiyan left, Nappa is rare in that he’s a villainous Saiyan, something that doesn’t really exist in this universe anymore. Back in his heyday during the Frieza saga, Nappa was a deadly threat, capable of taking most of the Z fighters out with the help of his goons. Would he fare better against Super Saiyan Gods? Probably not, but the game will let you try that match up anyway.\n\nBurter\n\nThe tallest and fastest member of the Ginyu Force, Burter is the perfect example of a deadly henchman. Similarly to Nappa, Burter is much better when paired alongside his Ginyu Force mate, Jeice. Judging by the most recent trailer, it looks like these two may have special animations if you put them together in a party.\n\nJeice\n\nAnother member of the Ginyu Force, Jeice is known for his baseball pitcher skills, capable of powerful throwing techniques like the Crusher Ball. The Ginyu Force haven’t proven themselves to be a threat beyond the Namek saga, but we’re interested to see how Jeice and the gang stack up against their modern-day counterparts.\n\nHit\n\nHit, the legendary assassin for Universe 6, is one of the most dangerous fighters in Dragon Ball Super. While he’s known for his ability to kill targets in a single blow, he’s also an incredible fighter who can hold his own against the very best.\n\nSuper Saiyan Kale (Berserk)\n\nOutside of her true Berserk Super Saiyan form, Kale isn’t like most of the Saiyan fighters. She’s both insecure and shy, but underneath the surface is a Legendary Super Saiyan, just like Broly.\n\nToppo\n\nLet’s be honest, the Pride Troopers of Universe 11 don’t look threatening at all, but Toppo goes out of his way to show that looks can be deceiving. This warrior is capable of God of Destruction-level power, a feat that only a handful of people in Dragon Ball Super can match.\n\nDyspo\n\nDyspo is the third most powerful member of the Pride Troopers, and his abilities all stem from his lightning fast speed. His attacks are so fast that most fighters can’t even see them, making Dyspo impossible to fight against.\n\nKakunsa\n\nKakunsa’s human form might appear to be innocent, but this warrior is extremely aggressive, and she isn’t afraid to bite her opponents using her sharp teeth.\n\nKid Trunks\n\nThe son of Vegeta and Bulma, he certainly has the arrogance and potential of the Prince of Saiyans. Growing up with Goku’s youngest son, Goten, the pair regularly sparred together into their teenage years.\n\nCaulifa\n\nAs one of few Saiyans left on Universe 6, it’s up to Caulifa and her gang to keep the Saiyan spirit alive and well. Caulifa is known for her tactical approach to combat, being able to keep a calm mind when dealing with heated moments.\n\nGoten\n\nThe youngest in the family, Goten spent most of his life not knowing his father due to the events of the Cell saga. As a result, he was trained primarily by Gohan, with additional training from Chi Chi and Kid Trunks.\n\nKale\n\nKale is Caulifa’s best friend and protégée, though her qualities as a fighter were fairly unknown until she tapped into her Super Saiyan state. Unlike most Saiyans, Kale doesn’t show her aggression on the surface, causing her fellow teammates to think she isn’t concerned about fighting.\n\nHow many characters will be on the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero roster?\n\nThe end of the Goku vs Vegeta Rivals Trailer revealed what looks to be the character select screen in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero roster. This officially confirms that there are 24 slots dedicated to variations of Goku and Vegeta.
