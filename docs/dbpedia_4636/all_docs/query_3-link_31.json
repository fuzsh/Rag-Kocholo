        "text": "For people who know about DBZ and its characters/story, this might be a really interesting qustion: Who would be stronger? Kid buu or Buuhan (Super Buu Gohan Absorbed)?\n\nFirst off, lets look at their fighting techniques:\n\nRegular Super Buu at first fought only people who werent superior to his power (he was merely using Gotenks as a warmup), but when mystic gohan came, super buu had a really hard time attacking gohan until he later absorbed gotenks and piccolo.\n\nNow if we look at the fact that Super Buu mutates when he absorbs someone (you can notice it by the fact not only his body look changed but also his personality) he gets their personality's.\n\nBut when Super Buu absorbed gohan later on, his personality of fighting like buutenks has dissapeared and made him to overconfident (probelly becus of the overconfindence gohan got when he was fighting super buu) and you can defitnily notice that when he is fighting againts vegito.\n\nBut the absorbtion of mystic gohan did make him very much more powerfull, even tough vegito was superior to him in evry possible way, Buuhan did had incredible power despite the fact vegito was toying with him.\n\nAnd now some facts about Kid Buu (there isnt as much facts as Buuhan becus with Kid Buu most of the part is already guessable)\n\nbut first im going to answer a really much asked qustion: Isnt Kid Buu stronger? Kid Buu was able to create a giant energy ball in less then 3 minutes while it took Buuhan lots of screaming and powering up just to create a even sized ball that was able to split the earth in half.\n\nThe answer is: im not 100% about this fact since i never really heard anybody else saying this possibility. the reason why kid buu was able to create more powerfull attacks and ki energy stuff is becus what Dende stated somewhere in the episodes is that Super Buu is able to get deeper in his power supply when he is really angry, but with Kid Buu its probelly a very diffrent matter, the reason is probelly becus when super buu transformed into kid buu, they mentioned that super buu's power was increasing instead of decreasing (his power was decreasing becus he lost the good influence of the kai's) and that power increase must have combined itself with the power supply thing. that could be one of the reasons how kid buu was able to create such a enormous ki ball in less then 3 minutes.\n\nOfcourse i do want to show you guys this video i made about the power of Buuhan and then you will understand what i mean with able to use the power supply when angry.\n\nBut to make the story short: there are 2 ways you can describe the answer, Buuhan is more powerfull when it comes to natural power and the power supply boost, while kid buu is more powerfull in the fact that he has nothing that slowes his power down (the influence of the kai's slowed down a bit of super buu's power) basicly kid buu is more dangerous then buuhan but not nessecerly stronger with brute strenghts etc.\n\nWhat is your tought about this qustion?"
