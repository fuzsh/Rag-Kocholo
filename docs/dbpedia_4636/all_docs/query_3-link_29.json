        "text": "@lvenger\n\nI agree with most of what you said there.\n\nAs much as i'd love to have an open Vegeta VS Wonder Woman debate, it would most likely never work out. I've seen some CAV's turn out badly due to the fact it's a Comic Character VS DBZ Character, including a couple of my own. Some even get entirely derailed because a few people can't read simple rules or just flat out ruining what we have.\n\nSo.. open Battle threads involving DBZ VS Comics, are a no go IMO. However, I do feel that DBZ on this site is being targeted more times than Comic Books. I know this is \"Comic Vine\", but that is no excuse to target something else as to blame for fan outrage.\n\nMost of the old bumped DBZ threads i've seen that involve somewhat hostility has been mostly due to Comic fanboys. I don't say that lightly either, there are undoubtedly DBZ fanboys to add to that but most of the backlash that i've seen is from the actual Comic-Book fans who feel the need to degrade and/or underrate DBZ Characters.\n\nWhile calculations, power-scaling, and ABC logic tends to cause uproar when debating with a DBZ fan, if someone debating against that person cannot disagree with this in a professional manner than it is not the person who made those type of arguments fault, at all. @nighthunder made a good point there.\n\nAll in all, DBZ VS Comics will never truly work out in open debates in my eyes. CAV debates for the most part work out just fine.\n\nThere's fanboys on both sides, but I truly feel that DBZ gets the blame too much. I mean sure, if it gets unbanned then i'd happily work with it but I wouldn't see the unban lasting too long at all.\n\n@homicidalmaniac:\n\nI'm wasn't saying that you said Kid Goku's combat speed was FTL.I said that Tien had tag Goku and Goku would have dodge it considering he have light speed reaction speed.\n\nHe didn't need to keep dodging Tien's attacks, he was slightly better than Tien so he was able to duke it out with him in combat. If Tien was superior and his blows were too devastating to tank, Goku would resort to dodging.\n\nI am very sure that fighting as appearing invisible isn't really massively hyper-sonic speed.A character can move at speeds that appear invisible to other character(s) that depending on the character(s) reaction spee\n\nUh, it is though. It doesn't depend on the character(s) reaction/perception speed to see said character move at invisible speed. It's due to the fact that they're literally moving at that speed, which labels them said speed (M Hyper-Sonic+).\n\nIn Anime/Manga, they tend to just show the characters performing those speeds and they don't necessarily state the speed they're moving at as opposed to comics.\n\nPower Levels weren't around the DB stories until the Sayian Saga.IIRC,Akira Toriyama stated that power levels are quite meaningless.Roshi PL was about around 180 and which is 20+ time stronger than a baseline human(which is 5).That a baseline human characters can increase their power by 30 times an that they can destroy a moon with that power.It kinda doesn't sit well for me.\n\nNo, you cannot make a comparison to Roshi and a human at all. Master Roshi's style of martial arts is completely non-existent, and his mastery of Ki is beyond our reach. That's what puts him so far above a human, and therefore you cannot calculate/compare the two.\n\nOne is fictional, the other is real. Trying to compare the two, is illogical.\n\nI found this thread in Vine Gen.Discussion forums\n\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/forums/gen-discussion-1/why-power-scaling-doesn-t-work-in-dbz-1526092/#15\n\nAnd I refuted it, take a look.\n\nConsidering that Kid Goku was hurt by bullets and a axe,I don't think Kid Goku can not take a few of Luffy's punches.\n\nUh, Goku doesn't possess just two Durability feats, and besides that was at the very beginning of Dragon-Ball and years behind the end of the King Piccolo Saga.\n\nI can find a lot more of his durability feats to prove that he could tank one of Luffy's punches, just say the word. And once he does tank one of the punches and finds out he can't keep tanking those kind of attacks, he resorts to dodging them from there on out.\n\nBoth Luffy and Kid Goku are both in-characters,both are goof balls and eat a lot of food.Luffy doesn't hold back that much when he is fighting.\n\nWhen Goku is in a battle where he isn't certain of the outcome, he takes it seriously. If he is certain he could beat Luffy after a while of battle, he'll goof around and toy with him. If he realizes Luffy isn't someone to trifle with, he'll take it seriously and fight at his best.\n\nI'm not trying to go off topic and reaction time speed does help you dodge the attack coming at you.\n\nI know, but not in the case of Batman. He dodges the bullets, before they're fired. As bullets are fired in a straight line, they're easily predictable by Batman. But yeah you're right, this argument is meaningless here.\n\nI'm been ask to be part of another CAV.So,do you want have the last say or me.\n\nAh, so you're finished then? If so, this is my last post. If you want to say anything else, by all means go ahead but i'm pretty much done now so i'm ready to open voting as long as you say the word.\n\nI'm going to do my best to try and refute this. While I do respect your opinion, that doesn't mean I agree with it. I ain't gonna try and make you change your mind on this, i'm just giving you my honest disagreement here:\n\n1. Uneven returns - Any given amount of KI, does not give a specific amount of Speed, Strength and Durability(as seen with Trunks' USSJ form). Which effectively means that Power Scaling cannot be used for those kinds of physical feats.\n\nHighly untrue for the most part, as you have been shown the scan of Vegeta stating that if the power increases, speed increases same-fold:\n\nAnd it doesn't matter how fast they get, the point is, they get fasterthe more power they attain. The way we measure their rough speed, is through quantifiable training increases and multipliers for transformations.\n\nThe ASSJ Transformation in regard to Trunks is the only exception in your case. It increases everything else like a regular SSJ Transformation does, except at the cost of speed. However, this does not apply to any other accountable SSJ transformation at all, and is merely a boost like transformation to mainly harm the opponent rather than keep up with them:\n\nSSJ - X50 Base\n\nSSJ2 - X2 SSJ\n\nSSJ3 X4 SSJ2 (although the massive Ki strain creates difficulty retaining this transformation, but has no relevance here).\n\nIf I were to include SSJ4, then it would be X10 SSJ3.\n\nThe ASSJ form does not adequate SSJ2 tier either, it is merely more powerful than regular SSJ at the cost of speed.\n\nIn other words, it's the only transformation which negates speed bar every other important aspect.\n\nAs for strength. Clearly in the 40 Ton (although the gravity on South Kai's Planet is undefined) feat by Goku he couldn't do it in just Base Form, hence why he transformed to SSJ and did so effortlessly:\n\nAnd finally durability, Goku in Base taking a lot of damage from Frieza's hits and then just before turning SSJ was so worn out he almost drowned:\n\nAnd then the difference in SSJ, literally dissapointed at Frieza's (at 70% power) blows (as opposed to the 1% Frieza who was beating the hell out of Goku in Base).\n\nThere's a solid difference:\n\nSo there's proof of speed, strength, and durability all increasing as long as said character gets more powerful.\n\nMoving on,\n\n2. Power Multipliers - Their various special(named) attacks are all power multipliers(Goku's Kamehameha against Raditz has a multiplication factor of about 2.2, while Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon has a multiplication factor of about 3.6, just to give some examples). Without knowing the specific multiplication factor for each technique, Power Scaling is effectively useless for KI based feats.\n\nIf you had noticed, Piccolo asked Goku to restrain Raditz and he put nearly all of his Ki into those two Special Beam Cannons, where as Goku did not do the same with his Kamehameha. Piccolo was given time, Goku did it on the spot.\n\nA few examples to demonstrate my point:\n\n1. Master Roshi, with a power level of 180, blew up the moon. However, he did that using his Max Power form, and the Kamehamaha technique. So, in order to figure out his actual effective PL for that feat, you need to know the power increase from his Max Power form, and the multiplication factor of his Kamehamaha.\n\nLater, Piccolo blows up the moon, with a power level of about 400, but again, we don't know the multiplication factor of the technique he used.\n\n2. Master Roshi, with a power level of about 138, is roughly 28 times more powerful than a normal human(based on the power level of 5 on the random Farmer scanned by Raditz).\n\nUsing Power Scaling, he should logically be about 28 times stronger and faster than a normal human. But with his 100 meter dash speed recorded at about 3.1 seconds, he's barely 3 times faster.\n\nYou're trying to apply DBZ Character stats to regular human stats, which is illogical.\n\nRoshi has a mastery over Ki that no human on the planet could hope to reach on their own, not to mention his style of martial arts is non-existent.\n\nTherefore, you cannot put this as false. As he is completely separate from the real world which you're trying to compare him to, after all it is fiction.\n\nIf we try looking at it the other way around:\n\nSince Roshi blew up the moon at about 180 PL, a normal human, if they learned to use their Ki, without increasing their Power Level, should be able to blow up a mountain several times the size of Mt. Everest.\n\nIf a human learned how to use their Ki to that extent, then yes they should be able to blow up a mountain like you said without exerting their Ki drastically.\n\nIf they still have the Ki but don't know how to use it, they could risk destroying large areas around it and not the mountain itself.\n\nAll that Ki Mastery means is the ability to focus your Ki to perform a particular task (assuming you have the power to do) and get it done right.\n\nSee Majin Buu for example, he has no control over his Ki but yet he still has the power to destroy buildings by running through a city. All that learning Ki Control would do, is let him harness this power.\n\nIn other words, Ki Control does not adequate the ability to do something, as you need the power to back it up. That of which, power-scaling is imminent.\n\nBottom line: Power Scaling is completely and utterly useless for any DBZ debate, and no real DBZ fan should be using it, since they should already know these things.\n\nNo it's not completely and utterly useless at all for that matter. I myself, have used power-scaling in the past and I refrain from using it as much as possible but it does not change my opinion on the matter which I have a valid argument for likewise so do you.\n\nOpinion >/< Opinion, there's no verdict.\n\nYou may stick to how you think as will I and everyone else, but that doesn't mean you can state that someone else's opinion on a matter is entirely useless and they're not a \"real fan\" if they hold the view against yours.\n\nEspecially if they have a valid argument and some forms of evidence to back their points up."
