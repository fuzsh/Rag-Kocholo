        "text": "Goku and Chi-Chi’s marriage, while iconic in the Dragon Ball universe, was never the ideal example of a loving and healthy relationship, especially from the perspective of their son, Goten. Goku’s constant absences, preoccupation with training and fighting, and lack of emotional expressiveness often left Chi-Chi feeling neglected and unsupported. This dynamic, while understandable given Goku’s role as the world’s protector, did not provide Goten with a positive template for his own future relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Goten grew older, he found himself seeking a more balanced and nurturing relationship, something that his parents’ marriage had never quite embodied. Fortunately, Goten had a close friend and peer who would ultimately shape his understanding of what a fulfilling relationship could look like – Trunks.\n\nThe Impact of Trunks on Goten’s Life\n\nTrunks and Goten‘s friendship in Dragon Ball forged through their shared experiences of facing Majin Buu and the loss of their family members, became a powerful source of support and inspiration for Goten. In a remote interview via DragonBallOfficial, psychologist Dr. Haruka Sudo explained:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sense of unity between them would also have been made very strong due to each having lost a family member to the same cause. I think that their bond became even closer due to being two people in the same situation with the common goal of defeating the same enemy.\n\nThis deep connection allowed Goten to witness a different type of relationship, one built on mutual respect, understanding, and a true partnership.\n\nIn the future timeline, we see a more mature Goten, who has developed healthy age-appropriate behavior, such as interest in romantic relationships, with Goten even having a girlfriend. Sudo notes that his approach to romantic relationships might even be based on the lessons he learned from his friendship with Trunks.\n\nThey contributed to the creation of a peaceful world by attaining greater power through the Fusion technique and fighting alongside the others to defeat Majin Buu, so I’d like to think that they’ll continue to share the bond between them of being part of this team that protects Planet Earth.\n\nThrough their shared experiences of facing the powerful threat of Majin Buu, Goten, and Trunks formed an unbreakable bond that would stay with them for the rest of their lives. The trials they faced side by side, and the way they supported each other through those difficult times, provided Goten with a blueprint for the kind of partnership he aspired to have in the Dragon Ball series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Legacy of Camaraderie in Dragon Ball\n\nTrunks and Goten’s friendship not only shaped them to overcome the challenges they faced but also profoundly shaped the individuals they became. As Sudo eloquently states she thinks that the people Trunks and Goten become would not exist if they didn’t have each other.\n\nSudo also stated:\n\nI think it’d be almost impossible for a child to live up to or surpass such an immeasurably powerful father like Goku or Vegeta… I think in that sense, it must also have been a great thing for Trunks and Goten to have somebody in that same position who understands their feelings.\n\nGoten, in particular, benefited greatly from this close bond, as it allowed him to develop a healthier perspective on romantic relationships, one that contrasted with the tumultuous marriage of his parents. Trunks’ presence in his life was instrumental in helping him become a more well-rounded individual, capable of forming meaningful and fulfilling connections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, Trunks and Goten’s friendship served the transformative power of strong peer relationships in Dragon Ball, especially during the formative years of childhood. Their bond not only helped them defeat powerful foes but also contributed to becoming their best selves by inspiring each other."
