        "text": "I'm not good at wording so i will try to go right to the point, i have some issues when it come with the current scaling of DBZ Anime.\n\n1) Post-Vegito Division Key for Vegeta and Goku should not exist.\n\nThe only major power increase that Vegeta had during the Buu Saga was with the Majin Form via Babidi's magic after that he remained death for a while only to be brought to back to life later, and last time i check being resurrected in the DBverse doesn't make someone stronger.\n\nWhile in the case of Goku he literally has no major gains of strength during the last saga of the Manga, and using the difference displays of power show between Innocent Buu and Kid Buu doesn't work since in both Anime and Manga he admit that he was holding back against Innocent Buu and that he could have defeat him but he wanted the younger generation to do it instead.\n\n2) Having all version of Super Buu scale to Buuhan doesn't make sense.\n\nSince we actually accept the anime statements of Kid Buu be the strongest incarnation of Majin Buu, meaning he surpassed his previous forms, having all versions of Super Buu (aside for Buuhan) and everyone who scale to him be 2-C its a major inconsistency that can't be ignored.\n\nBuuhan, which i need to remind he supposedly got much stronger by absorbing people and Goku admit that fusion was necessary to win against him, to perform his 2-C feat he had to go trully berserk and Vegito SSj1 had to actually put effort into stopping him yet somehow Super Buu, Gotenks and Ultimate Gohan are put in the same tier despire be potrayed as far weaker than Buuhan.\n\nAnd we can't just downscale previous versions of Super Buu to 2-C without good reason or just because of the massive gap of the tier, by the same logic why don't have all versions Buu at that level too? Or why not have everyone in the Buu Saga be 2-C? You see what kind of slippery slope we end up making?\n\nConclusion:\n\nSuper Buu should be downgraded to whatever tier the rest of the Buu Saga cast scale and have only Buuhan and Kid Buu reaching 2-C for the reason mentioned above, meaning 2-C will be restricted to just Kid Buu, Vegito, Goku SSj3 Post-Vegito Goku, Post-Vegito Vegeta, Super Janemba and possibly Hirudegarn (even thought if you actually see their fight Goku was potrayed as much stronger than him, unlike Super Janemba who actually overpower Goku SSj3) for DBZ Anime.\n\nBase Goku GT can remain the same since Uub its suppost to be as strong as Kid Buu.\n\nThe reason the Buu’s scale to the 2-C feat via downscaling is because they use to downscale from Kid Buu’s feat who’s stronger than Buuhan where Kid Buu was gonna destroy the kaioshin realm ignore the joules since it was before the kaioshin realm was accepted as infinite too\n\nBuuhan is 1/50th of Kid Buu\n\nUltimate Gohan is over 1/2 of that for sure, as he is far above Buucilo, so he'd be far above 61.4 Ronnafoe\n\nBuutenks is >= Gohan (which IMO was done better in the anime than the manga where Gohan just got stomped), so he'd also be far above 61.4 Ronnafoe\n\nSuper Buu is 1/2 of Buutenks, as he is SSJ3 Gotenks + Super Buu, and keep in mind that they were equal so they'd each be 1/2 of Buutenks. Thus, he'd be above 30.7 ronnafoe, which is consistent with Ultimate Gohan clapping him.\n\nAgree with everything in the OP. The Post Division scaling is especially BS since that scene still happens afterwards.\n\nEven if there might've been one, their post division versions have no real feats to warrant an upgrade in the scaling chain.\n\nInterpreting the inside Buu fight as meaning Base Goku/Vegeta>= Gohan/Gotenks that is obviously not sound with the narrative, the scene above in the OP proves that Goku up to then was still keeping himself below Fat Buu and Vegeta was under the impression they weren't even Fat Buu level, let alone being stronger than Gohan and Gotenks in Base. What's more, Goku (pre Kid Buu fight) and Vegeta were still scared of fighting Super Buu (who's literally weaker than Gohan and Gotenks) and said he would kill them individually. The Post Division clone scaling should just be nuked entirely.\n\nThey’re stated to be 1/100 of their power inside of there and Kid Buu fights well against Kid Buu who’s 50x stronger than Buuhan bare minimum\n\nDo note that the logic behind all Super Buu forms being 2-C is due to him holding his own against Gotenks, who is at least 1/2 of Buutenks, who is equal to Ultimate Gohan, who is at least 1/2 of Buuhan. If that is done away with, then oh well\n\nI do agree that Post-Vegito Division is a mess and I have stressed that many times. But at the same time, they stress that Kid Buu is the strongest and there is literally nothing to imply that their words excluded Buuhan. So we have to make do with that mess. I think the entire Inside Buu section should be reevaluated because Super Buu shitcanning Super Saiyan Goku and Vegeta even though they overpowered apparently perfect clones of Ultimate Gohan and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks is stupid\n\nBtw the 1/50th scaling doesn't work anymore because currently Vegito scales above Gogeta who stomped Janemba who is stronger than Hirudegarn who is stronger than Post-Buu Saga Super Saiyan 3 Goku (and remember, Super Saiyan Goku after having his stamina restored effortlessly overpowered Kid Buu in the struggle over the Spirit Bomb and was stated by the episode title to have \"proven himself as the strongest\")\n\nWell thank goodness Buuhan is the one who does the feat and not Kid buu\n\nImo Fusion Reborn needs to gtfo out of main toei canon, 2-C ratings can stay due to direct comparisons to 2-C characters, but trying to fit it into the timeline makes scaling a complete mess.\n\nTrying to fit Dead Zone is a mess too but its still canon because they say it is and its referenced. Same for Fusion Reborn\n\nYeah Fusion Reborn has to be canon for the same reason Deadzone has to be canon\n\nOK, FusiReborn aside\n\nWhy would any Buu besides Buuhan, Kid Buu, and (a big) maybe Buutenks scale to 2-C?\n\nSuper Buu is very blatantly not remotely close to 2-C, hell the reason Buuhan is 2-C is because he does exactly what Super Buu did ( punch a hole through spacetimes) except on a multiversal scale.\n\nThe nature of the feat makes it pretty evident that Super Buu is not remotely comparable to Buuhan.\n\nAnd afaik it was never confirmed anywhere that Buus absorbtions were only additives, for all we know he becomes exponentially stronger after absorbing someone, the only reason we have scaling chains placing Buutenks as 2x Super Buu and so on is because it’s an acceptable lowball to work with.\n\nI understand the concern but downscaling is the most reasonable option considering Goku and Vegeta think that Gohan and Gotenks would be helpful against Kid Buu\n\nOK, FusiReborn aside\n\nWhy would any Buu besides Buuhan, Kid Buu, and (a big) maybe Buutenks scale to 2-C?\n\nSuper Buu is very blatantly not remotely close to 2-C, hell the reason Buuhan is 2-C is because he does exactly what Super Buu did ( punch a hole through spacetimes) except on a multiversal scale.\n\nThe nature of the feat makes it pretty evident that Super Buu is not remotely comparable to Buuhan.\n\nAnd afaik it was never confirmed anywhere that Buus absorbtions were only additives, for all we know he becomes exponentially stronger after absorbing someone, the only reason we have scaling chains placing Buutenks as 2x Super Buu and so on is because it’s an acceptable lowball to work with generally speaking.\n\nSuper Buu did it on a lesser scale to escape the RoSaT but why would it be exponential?\n\nSuper Buu did it on a lesser scale to escape the RoSaT but why would it be exponential?\n\nBecause the disparity between their actual feats is exponential, it’s not on a lesser scale, the two feats aren’t remotely comparable, one makes a small 1 meter hole between two spacetimes, the other tears apart the entire universe sized space-times of the whole macrocosm.\n\nI understand the concern but downscaling is the most reasonable option considering Goku and Vegeta think that Gohan and Gotenks would be helpful against Kid Buu\n\nAnd how does them being ‘helpful’ translate to them being remotely comparable to Buu?\n\nHelpful is a subjective statement it.\n\nMr Satan was ‘helpful’ in buying time for Goku, Mr. Buu was helpful in doing the same and so was Vegeta, and all three of them got completely btfo by Kid Buu."
