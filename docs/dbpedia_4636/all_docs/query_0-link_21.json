        "text": "Toyo: Ever since the movie was announced, my head has been bursting with these incredible fantasies. But it betrayed all of them, in a good way! That’s how it feels. While building on the parts that are, in a way, typical for Dragon Ball movies — for instance, “a powerful foe appears, and they combine their strength to defeat him!” — it creates something different from there, I guess you could say… I was quite surprised.\n\nOoishi: In Dragon Ball, the ten years between the “Majin Boo arc” and the final chapter just go by, don’t they. During that time, there must have been a variety of things that went on with Goku & co.… I had figured as much, but just the fact that it’s showing us a piece of that, you could say it’s overwhelming!\n\nOoishi: Yes. In this movie, I feel like there’s a large amount of “affection” depicted, which is rare for Toriyama-sensei. Like, “so there’s that kind of setting, too!” Vegeta is especially irresistible. There’s a not-so-cool part shown as well, but he really is cool!\n\nToyo: And the Pilaf gang, which will bring back memories for the fans, appears too. Especially, to think Mai would have that happen…! (laughs)\n\nOoishi: I suppose it might be her “first love”…? This is also one of those rare instances of “affection”.\n\nToyo: The parts that touch on the finer aspects of Dragon Ball’s history are wonderful, too! For me in particular, I was moved at how they hadn’t forgotten about Vegeta’s younger brother “Tarble”. The feeling of, “That means it’s after that episode,” [i.e., the 2008 Jump Super Anime Tour special] it just gave me goosebumps. (laughs)\n\nOoishi: And to think “that” person would be the key. “Affection” is depicted here, too.\n\nToyo: It’s definitely a major point to watch out for.\n\nDRAGON BALL HEROES: VICTORY MISSION in “BATTLE OF GODS”\n\nPanel 1\n\nBEAT: What? This isn’t the battlefield… Where are we?\n\nNOTE: Heh heh heh… we’re inside the movie Battle of Gods! It’s the first movie in 17 years… so we’re going to appear too!\n\nPanel 2\n\nBEAT: WHAA?! You can’t do that, Note!! We’re not supposed to be in this Age!\n\nNOTE: Don’t say such uptight things! Look, the battle’s started!\n\nPanel 3\n\nBEERUS: Before creation, there is destruction!\n\nPanel 4\n\nNOTE: Now’s our chance! We’ll participate in the battle and appear in the movie, Beat-kun!\n\nSFX: *rustle*\n\nPanel 5\n\nSFX: *sneak*\n\nPanel 6\n\nBEAT: Go- Goku-san?!\n\nPanel 7\n\nGOKU: Shhh! This is just getting good!\n\nPanel 8\n\nVEGETA: HOW DARE YOU STRIKE MY WIFE…!!!\n\nGOKU: Oho! Looking good, Vegeta!\n\nBEAT & NOTE: …\n\nPanel 9\n\nGOKU: Go, Vegeta!\n\nNOTE: Um… shouldn’t you go help him?\n\nPanel 10\n\nGOKU: Hm? Ah… But it’ll be more dramatic if I wait until it gets a little more dire, won’t it?\n\nPanel 11\n\nNOTE: *exasperated sigh*\n\nBEAT: Dramatic?\n\nGOKU: Aw… so close!\n\nNARRATION: Thus Beat & co. missed their chance to appear in the movie…\n\nThe END\n\nI want to rewatch the climactic battle right now, again and again…!! — by Toyotarō"
