        "text": "Again, like my super controversial article on Cell, this installment focuses on yet another super playable personality. Majin Buu is easily in the top three personalities for a beatdown deck in my book (and a good contender for the #1 spot). So let’s take a look at the one Majin Buu Lv. 1 that no one seems to use or care about.\n\nThe Upside\n\nThough while not the strongest level one, this Majin Buu is still an incredible powerhouse that stays in the “D” power stage bracket until you can knock him to zero. Similar to the Cell Stage One HT, Majin Buu gets a double attack doing +3 stages so long as you did not declare a Tokui-Waza. However unlike Cell Lv. 1, Majin Buu actually has the power stages to back his double attack. If you’re opponent can’t block more than one physical attack in a combat, this Buu is going to quickly gain the upper hand. Sure he can’t declare a Tokui-Waza, but he doesn’t need one to play an “infinite” variation that runs pretty much every card/attack that can draw another card without a Tokui-Waza. An onslaught from Buu early game with only a handful of successful physical attacks will set the pace of any game.\n\nThe Downside\n\n–No Tokui-Waza. Sure there are benefits to going Non-Tokui, but if they were significant then you’d see more Non-TW decks played in the environment. While definitely a playable niche, it’s just easier to go the styled route.\n\n–Comparatively better Lv. 1 personalities. Of the four Majin Buu Lv. 1 personalities, three of them can already perform a Physical attack doing +3 power stages of damage. One just has better power levels and the other can at least declare a Tokui-Waza and get a semi-useful Constant Combat Power. You are essentially throwing out any benefits of a mastery and Tokui-Waza for a guaranteed additional physical attack for +3 power stages of damage and no additional effect.\n\n–The “Overpower” Rule. There was a time when Majin Buu was just stupid to play after the archaic “Double Power” rule was abolished. The new “Overpower” rule was installed in Retro DBZ events to stop the imbalance and help other characters join the ranks of playability. While this nerf had other Majin Buus in mind, it unfortunately hits this one too, making it always go second in a game where it needs to go first.\n\nOverall\n\nIn theory, it seems like a hoss power with decent power levels, but the only deck variation that can inherently incorporate that is a variation of the non-TW “infinite” deck that runs pretty much every card that can draw a card without a TW. Unfortunately, the “Overpower” makes the traditional Goku the Hero Lv.1 choice (and even the less traditional Unlocked Potential for Majin Dabura, Meditated) a better option for the deck. There’s just not enough support for that many Non-TW decks that would make this Majin Buu a worthwhile choice.\n\nLater, BroZ!\n\nFollow Me on Twitter @ArguablyTrue!"
