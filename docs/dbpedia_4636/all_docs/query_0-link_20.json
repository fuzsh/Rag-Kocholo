        "text": "@thekinfing said:\n\n@sy8008: I think this is the second version you mentioned, I have seen people differentiate between them by callling them Fat Boo(Splited) and Majin Buu(The ''original''), but @deathhero61 should probably confirm which version it is.\n\nHonestly, whenever I plan on using him in debates, unless absolutely necessary, I just assume whatever the strongest version of \"Fat Buu\" is. And I would assume Current Buu is stronger due to his training before the TOP. Plus Goku confirmed he got a lot stronger and faster but never specified on how much stronger he got or if he was stronger than when he first appeared.\n\n@thekinfing said:\n\nI though Z characters where fodder to Toriko?\n\nSpecifically top tiers like Toriko, Acacia, Joie, Midora. IMHO none of the Kings listed here would be able to take him on solo. Poison from Coco would at best slow him down, Sani wouldn't be able to put him down unless he tried to devour him. Zebra is their best bet, especially while working in conjunction with his fellow Kings.\n\n@marc_55 said:\n\n@deathhero61: How does he resist Coco's poison?\n\nHercule Satan tried to feed him poison, failed to work, plus Buu is virtually unkillable, in the DB verse poison has always been a go to option to assassinate the strongest characters in the series, and has failed time and time again. Jaco The Galatic Patrolman wanted to use the extinction bomb to kill Goku as a child, but knew that races like the Saiyans and Frieza's race would be immune to the virus, due to being to naturally hardy and strong. I wanna make note that hte extinction bomb is a virus made to wipe out entire species. If the virus wouldn't affect Frieza and Goku, I don't think it would work on Buu either. Has Coco's poison ever killed someone with healing abilities as potent as Buu's?\n\nEdit: Plus Coco would have to tag Buu with his poison attacks, and Buu has ways to defend or repel them.\n\n@marc_55 said:\n\nHe has an outer layer one his make up\n\nIt's up to you to prove that he has an \"outer layer\", which directly contradicting everything shown in the show seeing as how he's made out of the same exact material as his pants and gloves, and is shown to have no layers of skin.\n\nYou're saying I need to prove he has poison resistance of some arbitrary level when you need to prove that poison would damage or work on something so entirely not grounded in reality to the point where it's nothing like any other living being we've ever seen. Poison has already been tried on Buu oddly enough, and it wasn't resisted but completely ignored. Poison obviously doesn't work on someone who is made out of pants. He has no skin blood or eternal organs, scales, or anything for the poison to enter or touch to effect.\n\nLoading Video...\n\nYour argument is ridiculous and is holding Buu to the most ridiculous standard while holding Coco to literally no standard assuming his poison can ever effect beings such as Buu when poisons have already been proven to be entirely innefective to it. It's made out of magic.\n\nClear and implicit bias in favour of the team for whatever reason.\n\n@marc_55 said:\n\nbut my self appointed job is to argue favor for the Team.\n\nA bit weird considering the self appointed job should be to be intellectually honest with yourself and everyone else in the thread without having a definite bias towards one verse and unreasonably holding one side of the argument to a much higher standard than any you've made so far.\n\nCan we get some poison resistance feats for Flubber too?\n\nThis arguement is a joke.\n\nAnd Buu stomps. No answer to him blowing up the planet and moving on to the next one.\n\n@iusemycajonas: So, is your entire argument just his body is just somehow immune to poisons that corrode on touch? Even though his body can directly be affected by physicals and energy attacks?\n\nThe flubber thing is cool, but you realize Coco has resisted poisons, with his own, that melted the ground into a sea of poisons. His poison are easily potent enough to melt any kind of real world materials, as they damage and corrode things far more durable on contact. So, any feats of poison resistance remotely on Coco's level guy?\n\nYou're implying a random man-made poison suddenly = to Coco's poison is nonsensical at best. One showing of resistance is not a blanket immunity, please realize this.\n\nThat aside, Coco also has an addictive variant, which he can just addict Buu too. Allowing his team either consume him with their hair, or try to kill him with death sound. Or take that win through addiction.\n\nNot to mention with back channels to augment theirs speeds, they should be far faster than Buu. Allowing for a chance to see if these tactics work, if nothing else.\n\nOf course, I figure this will be going in circles. So, we'll see how long I care to stick around.\n\n@marc_55 said:\n\n@iusemycajonas: So, is your entire argument just body is just somehow immune to poisons that corrode on touch? Even though he body can directly be affected by physicals and energy attacks?\n\nThe flubber thing is cool, but you realize Coco has resisted poisons, with his own, that melted the ground into a sea of poisons. His poison are easily potent enough to melt any kind of real world materials, as they damage and corrode things far more durable. So, any feats of poison resistance guy?\n\nIt's not poison he's using if he's melting real world materials. That's all you had to say lol.\n\nIt's acid despite what the series is calling it.\n\nBuu is immune to poison but poison resistance feats are unecessary for this move, or else you'd have things like Moongooses and Hedgehogs resisting it. You're really looking for acid resistance feats. To which I say of Coco's acid who has it failed to work agaisnt and for what reason? What is the upper limit to it's effects within the show?\n\n@marc_55 said:\n\nThat aside, Coco also has an addictive variant, which he can just addict Buu too. Allowing his team either consume him with their hair, or try to kill him with death sound. Or take that win through addiction.\n\nCovered this earlier, poison WILL be innefective. There is no brain for the addictive poison to contaminate, you need specific magics to loosely control what it does, and even then those don't even work if it decides to resist.\n\nThe acid however, we're unsure until you provide feats to it's upper limits. Because as of now you're giving me a NLF when it comes to the acid.\n\n@marc_55 said:\n\nNot to mention with back channels to augment theirs speeds, they should be far faster than speed. Allowing for a chance to see if these tactics work, if nothing else.\n\nI'll just agree here because speed debates are boring to me, and speed isn't really even relevant in this fight as there are a phlethora of ways Buu can win out agaisnt faster opponents which he's already done in Z.\n\n@marc_55 said:\n\nOf course, I figure this will be going in circles. So, we'll see how long I care to stick around.\n\nOnly reason it was going in circles earlier is because you were misusing the definition of poison lol. Seems like a pretty straight line now to me.\n\nI gotta give this to Buu. Sani, Coco, and Zebra weren't really that impressive in the final fight, and they were called small flies while Toriko and Star were called large flies and that was before Toriko's final power ups, so they don't really scale to him. They were probably still well below the 8 kings. Also hair, sound, and poison really won't be effective against Buu while Buu can turn them into candy, absorb them, or blow up the planet, and that's if he can't just out right kill them."
