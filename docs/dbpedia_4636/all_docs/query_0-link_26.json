        "text": "Since your Note 1 says you're also interested in what happens in the original DBZ series, and if it's a problem there or not, the following is based on the English (Funimation) dub of the original scene. It seems that in the Japanese Kai version, Piccolo has a great deal more specific things to say, which are more problematic, as you indicate. I won't go into trying to work out the why of this apparent change, I'll largely just proceed to operate on the basis of the original Funimation dub, as indicated.\n\nIn the Buu saga scene, Vegeta asks Piccolo if he'll get to meet Goku in the afterlife (or in Other World, if you prefer). Piccolo then informs him that Goku earned a body and freedom of movement in the afterlife due to a long life of selflessness and heroics, and that Vegeta should not expect to be granted the same reward, having spent too much of his life being selfish and inflicting pain and misery. It is not stated that anything happens that erases memories or wholly prevents resurrection via Dragon Balls in this version. All he's being told is that he won't be able to run around being rivals with Goku in the afterlife.\n\nWhat we do know is that elsewhere in the series it is implied that a spirit which is purified of its evil can then be reborn. This is how Uub comes to exist, as the reincarnation of the purified Buu. And in the movie Fusion Reborn, with the villain Janemba, there is even a machine for such purification. However, many villains and other beings are shown in Hell at various points and in various media.* This suggests that purification is not particularly fast or even mandatory, and may not necessarily be applied to the most powerful of entities. This is reinforced by how Fusion Reborn is predicated upon the (single) demon that operates the machine being lazy and not properly doing his job. So even if evil spirits are supposed to be purified quickly, in practice it would seem things are run too inefficiently to achieve this. There is also the fact that Shenron originally had a one year time limit on restoring someone to life. If whatever happens to evil beings upon death prevented resurrection via Shenron (which is who resurrects Vegeta on Namek), then there must be at least a one year delay between death and whatever this process is (purification and being reborn, or otherwise) in order for this time limit to be knowable and meaningful.\n\nMoreover, we are ultimately told that Hell is planet-specific, and so the above purification stuff is for Earth only. So there's no reason at all to think that the rules stated for those who have died on Earth will also apply the same to those who die on Namek or anywhere else. So even if you are right and Vegeta should have been purified upon death, by Earth's rules for Hell, he wasn't by the simple fact that he died on Namek and not Earth.\n\nAnd in any case, even by Earth's rules his resurrection is not prevented. We know, from Chiatzu receiving a body and Tien a new arm after losing them in their fights against Nappa, that it is possible for bodies to be repaired or reconstructed entirely in the afterlife. Upon being wished back to life, Chiatzu retained his body, and Tien retained his replacement arm. So even if Vegeta, upon his death on Earth, was denied the retention of his body (he wasn't, but by a special exception rather than having earned it), his body can still be reconstructed when something like a wish on the Dragonballs is made.**\n\nFinally, in the Buu saga, we have two wishes that go out of their way to exclude the resurrection of evil people. First, when using Earth's dragon balls to restore those killed in Majin Vegeta's rampage, they specifically exclude the resurrection of evil people. Second, near the end of the Buu saga, when Dende wishes the Earth and then its people back using New Namek's dragon balls, he also specifically excludes evil people from being restored to life. And while we might say in the first case that maybe the Z-team doesn't know the exact ins-and-outs of what the dragon balls can do with regards to reviving evil people, Dende was an expert. Such specific exclusion of evil beings would be completely unnecessary if they were already impossible to resurrect.\n\n*You don't seem to be quite as concerned with why so many decidedly-not-worthy beings have bodies, so I won't put much effort into trying to explain that. Best guess is that anyone of sufficient (will)power can forcibly retain/manifest a body, but they are generally denied freedom of movement and constrained to Hell (or HFIL in the original dub). Though why Piccolo would apparently not know this, and would not predict that Vegeta could probably forcibly retain a body, is less clear. Perhaps he wasn't being as honest as he claimed. But being constrained to Hell alone would be sufficient to keep Goku separated from him in normal circumstances."
