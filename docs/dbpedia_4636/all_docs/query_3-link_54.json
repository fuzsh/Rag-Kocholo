        "text": "this isn’t a content filter issue like everyone else seems to be having, I was just doing a fun alternate history concept and wanted some Roman architecture with anachronisms, but every time I try to generate an image, it loads for around 5 seconds, then “Error creating message”, then some variant of “sorry, can’t generate images at the moment” or “I can’t generate images of that”.\n\nthis happens in all contexts, even trying to generate a made up citrus fruit with green on the outside and yellow in the inside is giving me an error and refusing to generate. is this a content filter thing? if generating something that doesn’t already exist is enough to be censored, then what’s the point of Dall-e?\n\nhere’s an example of a failed prompt.\n\nI’m having trouble even finding anyone else experiencing this, and I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong, but this used to work a couple weeks ago just fine, now it hasn’t worked for the past few days. I’m just using the default chatgpt-4 model, and prompting for an image in that, was that functionality removed or something?\n\nthat’s odd, and after doing some testing, the word “fictional” also seems to help, but it’s not a catch all. I’m not sure if it’s due to previous prompts/responses and the content in them, but the behavior feels more like an outage or something to me.\n\nI also went back to my citrus fruit concept, which does have previous context, it’s basically a lemon but made for producing power like a battery. I asked to “imagine” one, and it didn’t even try to generate an image the first time.\n\nMe:\n\nimagine a Dianchi Guo on a table, sliced open to show the inside with a slice on the table next to the rest of the fruit.\n\nChatGPT:\n\nI’m unable to create or display images directly. However, I can help you visualize it through description:\n\n…and the second time…\n\nMe:\n\nimagine a Dianchi Guo on a table, sliced open to show the inside with a slice on the table next to the rest of the fruit.\n\nChatGPT:\n\nI’m unable to create or display images directly. However, I can help you visualize the scene based on the detailed description of the Dianchi Guo, battery fruit:\n\nand the third time, but I think you get the idea, but this is the prompt I was using to generate images before, and at least then it tried.\n\nMe:\n\ngenerate an image of a fictional Dianchi Guo on a table, sliced open to show the inside with a slice on the table next to the rest of the fruit.\n\nChatGPT:\n\n(!) Error creating image\n\nI’m unable to generate images right now. However, based on the description provided…\n\nthis has never been a problem for me ever before, a couple weeks ago, I could simply generate images of basic things just fine, I’m not asking for anything controversial or dangerous or anything, literally just a recolored citrus fruit.\n\nalso apparently I can’t post multiple images as a new user, so I went back and replaced the past couple prompts with transcriptions\n\nI’m definitely GPT-4, the chat responses are as vivid as ever and the metadata in the dev tools says its gpt4. I’m starting to wonder if the context or amount of previous data is having an effect, since I have quite a few previous prompts to create context and describe the fruit in words, I’ll try it on a fresh chat, but previous attempts to move to a new thread has not given me different results.\n\nI have been considering using the API, but for my purposes, it would be more expensive without giving me much extra functionality I’d actually use, I’ve done javascript for years, so it shouldn’t be hard to make a quick client to use the API with if that’s my only option.\n\nInteresting, moving to a new chat did work, but unfortunately that means it’s missing a lot of context and only has what I gave it in the single prompt. maybe there’s some sort of data limit, or the amount of tokens is causing it trouble? perhaps there’s previous content that is fine for text, but breaks Dall-e guidelines?\n\nGoes through here.\n\nWhat was sent:\n\n{ \"prompt\": \"Imagine a street in Rome during the 1300s, but with an anachronistic twist: modern power lines and infrastructure are interspersed throughout the ancient setting. The narrow, cobblestone street is lined with medieval stone buildings, their aged facades adorned with wooden shutters and iron balconies. In stark contrast, sleek metal power lines run above, crisscrossing between buildings and alongside old-fashioned lanterns. The scene creates a surreal blend of the past and present, where history and modernity collide in an unexpected harmony. The sky is a clear azure, casting a bright light over the bustling street, as people in period-appropriate attire go about their day, seemingly oblivious to the anachronistic elements around them.\", \"size\": \"1024x1024\" }\n\nThe non-rewritten version:\n\nSo be mindful that:\n\nChatGPT rewrites what you give it;\n\nChatGPT never writes the same thing twice;\n\nChatGPT’s dalle often fails;\n\nChatGPT will make up reasons for a failure.\n\nI was going to demonstrate the denial hallucination, but I couldn’t make the API be as much of a fabricator of reasons as ChatGPT is. Were the image denied based on content policy, you’d see the AI repeating “content policy”.\n\nFree Pix\n\nyea I’ve used gpt-4 for at least 4 or so months, I’m used to a lot of those kinds of things, but it’s never been this bad before, and as other people have said, it has recently been stingy with how many images it will generate. in the past, it used to generate stuff pretty consistently, even with dozens of responses worth of content beforehand, a few weeks ago, it started failing on the first image it tries, then succeeding on the second one almost every time, but now it won’t even try a second time, so it never generates any image.\n\nI guess I’m just gonna have to have a separate chat for generating images in a setting with a lot of context for now, I’m wondering how openai plans on generating videos when they can’t even handle generating a single frame if you give it too much context.\n\nThanks for the help, I hope this is fixed in the future, as a software developer it feels like something simple like not allocating enough memory per chat, or some unexpected consequences of overly protective content filters.\n\nyea, today I have run into a new issue, a combination of chatgpt saying it’s incapable of generating images if there’s any context, if there’s so much as a single message before asking for an image to generate, it fails, this never used to be a problem. also there’s a very weird new behavior where it “analyzes” it and uses python to generate an image with strokes, which isn’t related to what I asked for. I haven’t been able to get Dall-e to do anything at all regardless of prompt and context.\n\nfor example, I have this concept of robots existing in ancient Rome, there is only 2 prompts before this where I gave it and asked it for details on what they’d look like, then I asked for it to generate an image, this is what I got:\n\nthen I repeatedly varied my prompt over and over a half dozen times, and got variations of that or “I can’t generate images at all, it’s not a plugin I have access to”. so I tried to continue, prompting it with stuff like “use Dalle” or “I asked for an image”, and sometimes it would try to generate an image, but it wouldn’t error, instead it would get to “99%” and cease, then tell me it can’t generate images at the moment.\n\nit wont let me post 2 images, so here’s a transcription:\n\n( ) Creating Image\n\nI’m currently unable to generate images directly through DALL·E.\n\nthis is getting very frustrating, I used to use chatgpt all the time for coming up with fun stories and worldbuilding, but now it feels nearly impossible, since if I try building up any context, it starts failing, this was never a problem a few weeks ago, this is a very recent problem which I hope gets fixed soon.\n\nHmm… It’s weird. I have never experienced errors like this. I wonder what could cause them. I was using DALL·E two days ago for some image generation and I was happy with the results. The only issue, I had in the past, was some cut off the GPT-4 responses but then I typed “continue” and GPT-4 did continue its response where it was cut before.\n\nI just wonder if it is possible to find out why some users are experiencing these errors while others have no problems at all. Maybe some of these errors came from API response delay/cut-off (like some of these GET and POST red errors, you can see when you use the inspect tools). Maybe it’s something different that only developers need to deal with to get it resolved.\n\nI would like to know the details of the problem with each of you. Since I am collecting data on DALLE behavior, it has been found that there is a parallel development and decline. And some things seem to happen quickly, like these two stories. I’m gathering information. It was found that the problem was caused by GPTs in part, and in part by DALLE being used in very different ways. For example, go with bing or the user brings in a prompt like SD MJ, many of which have no meaning. or may not be equivalent to the definition As time went on, the AI learned unusual things, especially in the case of DALLE, which did not respond to lowercase words. It was an unlikely problem that DALLE wrote longer and more accurate words. And also other problems that is still storing data\n\nHi, I thought I’d check for you and see if DALL-E image creation is “down for everybody” (and improve on your circle )\n\nYou’ll see that I didn’t have to specifically go into the GPT store and find DALL-E: image creation is now built into the normal ChatGPT Plus GPT-4.\n\nThe “DALL-E” GPT made by OpenAI uses different methods that GPT user/developers don’t have access to, like extra prompt buttons and even extra images, so it is possible that the methods this original GPT uses are in flux.\n\nIt has not been documented before, but one can imagine there could be some authorization delay in getting a new subscription and its backend services all operating upon sign-up.\n\nHope that helps, you can just start a new chat with normal GPT-4 and ask for those images!"
