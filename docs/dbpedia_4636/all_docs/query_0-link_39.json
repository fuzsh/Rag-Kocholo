        "text": "Nothing exemplifies the raw strength of Dragon Ball‘s Z Fighters better than the legendary transformations they attain on their journey to become the world’s greatest warriors. But as we learned in #10-6 of this Top Ten list, pure strength means nothing in the face of powerful design and story impact. It is my belief that these five forms are the most significant transformations in the entire series, and the implementation of these states only improve upon the characters that so achieve them. No matter how powerful a form may be, it is through its use and effectiveness in Dragon Ball‘s story that truly matters. With all that being said, here’s the Top Ten Dragon Ball Transformations (#5-1).\n\nLet’s power up!\n\n5: Ultimate Gohan\n\nFrom a very human perspective, Gohan is an exceptionally sympathetic character. All the young Saiyan wants is to rake in the dough from years of scholarly work and live peacefully with his wife Videl. But as the son of the savior of the universe, everybody around Gohan pushes him to be stronger than he would like to be. After all, the kid defeated Cell when he was just eleven years old. Vegeta, Piccolo, Future Trunks, and even us Dragon Ball fans wished Gohan would put some of that hidden Saiyan potential to use. Our wishes were finally granted in the Majin Buu Saga when Old Kai uses his godly powers to unlock Gohan’s innate potential, materializing in a pale, white glow. Ultimate Gohan boasts power even greater than his Super Saiyan form, and with it, he could finally fight alongside his fellow Z Warriors. He still puts off his training in Dragon Ball Super, however, as he prioritizes his work and family more than pushing his fighting capabilites. Only time will tell if and when Dragon Ball Super decides to put Ultimate Gohan back into the spotlight.\n\n4: Kaio-ken\n\nWhereas all other forms prior were strictly upgrades to previously established transformations, the Kaio-ken is a lot more flexible. Taught to Goku by King Kai in Other World, the Kaio-ken is applied to the user in the form of a crimson aura, doubling or tripling their power as they so desire. However, Goku seldom uses this technique as it only lasts for a short time, and the power increase makes him much more unstable. If Goku loses control of the boiling energy, the ki could potentially hurl inwards killing him from the inside. Through intense ki control training, the Kaio-ken has been relevant since its introduction, with its latest application in the series being used in conjunction with Super Saiyan Blue to best Fusion Zamasu through pure strength.\n\n3: Final Form Frieza\n\nFrieza is the spark of nearly every major event in Dragon Ball. As emperor of the largest military organization of the universe, Frieza enslaved and exterminated the entirety of the Saiyan Race including Goku’s father Bardock, instilling Vegeta’s intense pride for his loved ones and fellow Saiyans as well as trapping Goku on Earth. During the Namek Saga, the second major saga in DBZ, Frieza sought the Dragon Ball to wish for universal domination and immortality, but was beat in the race to power by the Z Fighters. With no other options left, Frieza vented his rage on the Saiyans who ruined his plans. Mutating into larger, more terrible forms, only Goku had the strength to fight Frieza at his strongest, Final Form Frieza. This form differs from his other transformations as its sleek exterior and lightweight build allowed for faster movement speed and flight. With this power boost, Frieza ruthlessly murdered Vegeta, Piccolo, and Krillin in cold blood, effortlessly besting the likes of Kaioken x20 and the Galick Gun. It was only through Frieza’s merciless massacre of DBZ’s strongest fighters that allowed Goku to reach an uprecedented level of power not seen in 1000 years.\n\n2: Super Saiyan\n\nNo need for introduction here. The Super Saiyan tranformation is the most iconic element in all of Dragon Ball. By erupting power directly from the user’s body through pure emotion and willpower, the Super Saiyan has set the gold standard for Shōnen as a whole. Power levels and fight scenes do play a role in the Super Saiyan’s popularity, but the reason why the Super Saiyan is such a successful implementation to the series is its phenomenal design. Immediately the viewer’s attention is pulled towards the Saiyan’s iconic golden hair and iridescent yellow aura, conveying a muted strength similar to the a flame’s fiery tongues. However, the strongest distinction of the Super Saiyan is also the most subtle. Akira Toriyama draws the Saiyan’s eyes with extraordinary detail, both aesthetically and artistically. The eyes’ edges are drawn with a full outline enclosing the space. This is in direct contrast to the routine method of drawing an unfinished half circle around the eyes, leaving and aloof expression. The result is an enraged, stagnant expression reserved only for villains, certainly unlike the extraordinarily carefree Goku. To further emphasize this distinction between the initiation of the form and how it is actually implemented is Goku. The first time he activates the Super Saiyan state, Goku decides to spare the tyrant Frieza, admitting that although his power was born by intense rage and innate desires to kill, the Saiyan will never bring himself down to the level of evil Frieza dwells in.\n\n1: Super Saiyan God (Blue/Rosé)\n\nWhat form could top the Super Saiyan’s iconic design? How about the form that did everything Super Saiyan did but better. Meet Super Saiyan God, the poster child of Dragon Ball Super. Through rigorous ki control training under the tutelage of the guardian of god Whis, Goku and Vegeta have unlocked a state so powerful, the two Saiyans became literal deities just to produce the energy to maintain the state. Goku Black has also achieved his own version of Super Saiyan Blue, Super Saiyan Rosé. With strength reaching into levels of absurdity, the Super Saiyan God can thrust punches so powerful, shock waves from the ensuing contact threaten the stability of the entire universe, and only the Gods of Destruction themselves can prove to be a match worthy of the almighty Saiyans.\n\nBut why does this form top Super Saiyan? After all, it just looks like Super Saiyan with blue hair dye, and sheer power alone could never outweigh well-crafted design, right? Well, the most distinct element of these two versions of Super Saiyan God are the colors of their hair and auras. Shockingly, this simple design element resonates a deeper meaning. To unlock the powers of Super Saiyan Blue, a Saiyan must first reach a state of enlightenment and absolute tranquility in order to calm the rage of a Saiyan God. According to Akira Toriyama, “By overcoming a certain limit he has become both strong and tranquil, able to keep his composure in a fight.” The color blue resonates serenity and peacefulness like the vast ocean under the blanket of an endless sky. Similarly, Goku and Vegeta physically manifest their perfected understanding of martial arts in the form of their turquoise colored auras.\n\nLikewise, Zamasu’s character is defined by his inability to see the beauty of anything less than the supreme authority of the divine. He spits upon the face of humanity because of our inability to cooperate with each other and live in veritable harmony, but by doing so Zamasu acts against the will of the gods, contradicting his own philosophy of peace. As a result, Goku Black’s aura produces a vibrant shade of pink, epitomizing his philosophy of beauty through divine absolution. The word rosé refers to a type of red wine popularized by the first European winemakers spanning generations of development. Although derived from nature and poured into a glass in its beautiful, perfected state, rosé wine is still alcohol, dangerous if abused and life threatening when taken in extremity. The flower rose is a token of unadulterated love and beauty, yet picking one off of its stem results in cuts from its thorns. Similarly, Super Saiyan Rosé is the result of a god drunk on his own divinity, and what beauty Black may have sought in obtaining this form will never be worth the vile actions of ruination and loss that he committed on the pursuit for his ideals.\n\nDragon Ball Z transformations are not simply an excuse to force out new character designs or produce new merchandise. Rather, the introduction of Super Saiyan God, Kaioken, Ultimate Gohan, and Fusion Zamasu add layers of depth to an already awe-inspiring series. Breathing new life into these decades old characters with the application of epic action scenes and unexpectedly profound character development, the Super Saiyan God (Blue/Rosé) tops today’s list of Top 10 Dragon Ball Transformations.亀\n\nThere has never been a better time to start watching the Dragon Ball series. Longtime fans and newcomers alike rejoice with the Dragon Ball Super‘s addition of more powerful characters, earth-shattering fight scenes, and best of all, the latest epic transformations. Back in the days of Dragon Ball, fighters like Goku and Piccolo took off their hefty training gear right before a match to unlock a boost in their martial arts prowess, a common training technique used by athletes today. Since then, weights and equipment are no match for the legendary forms the Z Fighters have come up with, and decades of Dragon Ball have given us all kinds of Super Saiyan goodness to savor. Today I’m counting down the Top 10 greatest Dragon Ball transformations, #10-6! Keep in mind that the power levels of these forms isn’t necessarily a factor, just how dynamic the form was to character development and the series’ plot as a whole.\n\nWith that being said, let’s take a look!\n\n10: Perfect Cell\n\nCell is quite a unique Dragon Ball Z villain. Although he never started off as an initially powerful threat, Cell’s persistence alone was enough to keep our heroes on their toes. The super mutant was introduced journeying from town-to-town concealing his power level, slowly exterminating Earth’s weak human inhabitants to reach might that rivaled that of Goku and Piccolo. By absorbing powerful life forms through his tail, Cell excelled in pure fighting potential. That is, until the payoff finally comes. After chasing down Android 18, a powerful life form protected by the Z Warriors, Cell staves off the likes of Tien, Piccolo, and Krillin to eradicate Android 18 and drain her of her energy, mutating into his most powerful state, Perfect Cell. To test his transformation, Cell offers a challenge to Earth’s mightiest warriors: to defeat him in the Cell Games, a tournament where the challenger either defeats Cell and stops the destruction, or ends up alongside the millions of innocents Cell has murdered on his journey to perfection.\n\n9: Super Saiyan 3\n\nDragon Ball transformations are notoriously ostentatious and flashy, and no other form exemplifies this better than Super Saiyan 3. With this power-up, the user sacrifices their body’s reservations of ki in exchange for absolute utilization of their fighting energy. However, SS3’s biggest drawbacks include putting intense stress on the user and potentially causing worldwide devastation if the user were to accidentally leak their energy outwards. As a form, SS3 does not boast a compelling story; Goku achieved the form through years of unspecified training in Other World, and Gotenks simply followed Goku’s example. However, what SS3 does bring to the table is formidable power, titan-like clashes of pure strength, and luscious golden hair. Although the backstory of SS3 is rather shallow, nobody can argue the sheer awe this epic transformation attains.\n\n8: Kid Buu\n\nMajin Buu, Earth’s final challenge in Dragon Ball Z. Summoned by the wizard Bibidi, the demon Buu’s power derives from eliminating and absorbing powerful beings in a manner similar to Cell. In an absolute rage, Buu obliterated planets and murdered the Supreme Kais. With every kill, Buu took on the personality and strengths of his victims. This came to the point where the final form of Buu, Super Buu, was nearly unstoppable, capable of individually murdering the entire population of Earth in the span of a few minutes. His most unpredictable form, however, is Majin Buu Pure, or Kid Buu. Kid Buu relishes absolute destruction and besting the strongest opponents in the universe. With no foreign personality to take hold of his psyche, Kid Buu maniacally beats his chest and screams with laughter during his bouts of rage. His restless anger caused the Majin to furiously launch energy attacks straight towards Earth with the intent to annihilate. Even with Vegeta and Goku doing everything in their power to stop Kid Buu from obliterating the Earth, Kid Buu succeeded, bursting the planet and wiping out everything on it.\n\n7: Super Saiyan 4\n\nDragon Ball GT is the anime successor to Dragon Ball Z produced by Toei Animation spanning 64 episodes. However, Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball’s author, never produced a manga to coincide with its release in the same manner as Dragon Ball Z or Dragon Ball Super. Because of this, GT polarizes the Dragon Ball fan base to this day as some go so far as to discredit its existence due to a lack of canonicity. But despite all the criticism GT has gotten, the general consensus between Dragon Ball fans is that Super Saiyan 4, a transformation introduced in GT, is freaking sweet. SS4 ditches the golden hairdo for an auburn look that spreads through the body in the form of fur, a nod to the Saiyan species’ origin as primeval ape warriors. Brought about through the culmination of a Saiyan’s instinct to eradicate and the presence of a kind heart, SS4’s fortitude extends past the realm of canonicity into the hearts of the viewer.\n\n6: Fusion Zamasu\n\nZamasu, the Supreme Kai apprentice of Universe 10, is my favorite villain in Dragon Ball Super. There are actually two versions of Zamasu. The first is Goku Black, the North Kai of Universe 10’s current timeline. In training to become a Creation God, Zamasu learned that a Kai’s role in the Universe is to create celestial bodies in order to govern the mortals that may inhabit them. Through understanding and patience, a Kai will oversee the evolution of us mortals in maintaining the balance of life in the universe, thus leading us to enlightenment resulting from our success or destruction at the hands of a god should we be unruly. In observing the progress of the Planet Babari over 1,000 years, Zamasu grew impatient at its inhabitants, who have never evolved past their primal caveperson-like forms to reach an agreement of peace like the gods would. The young Kai concluded that mortals are inherently wicked at heart, culminating into unending wars over the simplest of disagreements.\n\nThe only solution, therefore, would be to annihilate mortals altogether, ushering an era of peace for the gods who so watch over them. Zamasu then gathered the Super Dragon Balls to wish for a body powerful enough to wipe the universe of its people, yet with his spirit in control of the vessel’s actions. As a result, the dragon swapped the body of Zamasu with that of Goku, the only mortal Zamasu deemed powerful enough to be his avatar. He was christened Goku Black. Using this new body, Black murdered his teacher, Gowasu, and stole his Time Ring, traveling backwards into the alternate Future Timeline to meet himself before he ever assumed control of unending power. This Future Zamasu, under the guidance of Goku Black, gathered the Super Dragon Balls to wish for absolute immortality, should Goku Black ever die in battle. In this timeline, Goku and Vegeta have been long dead, leaving Future Trunks as the final Z Warrior. With no obstacle in their wake, Goku Black and Future Zamasu laid waste to the entire multiverse, murdering every god and mortal in their path, leaving Future Earth as the final battleground.\n\nTo demonstrate to Future Trunks his absolute dominion over all mortals, the two Kais merged together using the divine Potara Earrings and materialized as an all-new god, Fusion Zamasu. Capable of obliterating the entire universe with but a thought, Fusion Zamasu is the most powerful villain seen in the series, and he sure does love to boast about it. Intoxicated with power, Fusion Zamasu refuses to utilize the full extent of his divine ability because winning is not a priority to the young Kai. After all, how could he show off his powers of a god to his foes if all of his enemies are dead? By consistently wasting his time boasting to his enemies and flaring his godlike ego rather than fighting, Zamasu never bested his mortal opponents in a fair match, disclosing his weaknesses and holding back his unlimited strength. Fusion Zamasu’s arrogance and restraint to actually use the full extent of this form is what limits him, and his character demonstrates that power is never enough if you let it get to your head. 亀"
