        "text": "There seems to be a general opinion that DBS is inferior to its predecessors.\n\nSuper is so much better, structurally, than anything that happened after the original two Androids showed up in Z. Rewatching Z made me realize:\n\n-Trunks barely does anything in his own story\n\n-17 and 18 never do anything in the present\n\n-Cell spends a lot of time just goofing off with no real motivations\n\n-Characters are made entirely useless on a whim\n\n-Power-ups are made useless right after they are gained\n\n-There's so much rubber banding with who is fighting who and getting what power up, especially in the Buu arc\n\nThe direction is \"throw stuff at the wall until something sticks\" for the entire second half of Androids/Cell all the way up until the end of Buu.\n\nSuper gives us:\n\n-Characters who are not just \"the previous bad guy but stronger\"\n\n-A lot of world building by running with the expanding universe from Z (literally)\n\n-At least tries to give screen time and something to do to secondary characters\n\n-Callbacks and references to Dragon Ball and Z that shows reverence to the past material in a way that Z did not (Especially in the Goku Black arc)\n\n-Brings us to new and exotic locales\n\n-Gives characters abilities, power-ups, and techniques that do something without simply being power boosts (especially in the Tournament of Power arc)\n\nNow, let me make it clear: I love Dragon Ball Z. Even with all of its wonky writing and the obviously improvised on the fly plot, I think it is peak creativity, and it's easy to see why it inspired so much of popular culture.\n\nI also realize that Super has problems Z does not, mainly in its early animation, and in its often rushed or poorly explained plotlines.\n\nBut I think Super has more going for it than Z did in what is generally its most disliked story arc, the Buu arc, and even has strengths that put it over the Cell arc in some ways.\n\nI'm curious to see which one people like better.\n\nWait! You say. How can you put all of Super against one story arc of Z? Well, that's the point. I want to see if people think Super is better than the low point of Z or not. And the Buu arc is long - really long. Long enough to be as many episodes as nearly all of Super!\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nMajin Buu arc gave me Majin Vegeta vs Goku, so yes. Super has yet to give me any moment like that thus far unless we're counting DBS Broly.\n\nEverything after Vegeta dies is bad in the Buu arc. The Buu arc also gave us SSJ3 (Which is the most useless and ugliest canon SSJ form) and Gotenks, so yeah... it's a net negative for me.\n\nWhy do people love Majin Vegeta so much? He's basically just a jealous fighter who use steroids to finally stop being second-best and he still was second-best.\n\nIt's the arc that makes Vegeta the most well developed character in all of Dragon Ball. It's basically when he realizes there's more to life than just trying to overcome Goku and faces a lot of his demons.\n\nThe high points of the Buu saga are better than the high points of Super, but I think -- even with the shitty redone Resurrection F arc -- Super is overall better than Buu. I love everything up to Vegeta's death and then the whole Kid Buu stretch of episodes, but there's a giant mass of episodes in between those two points that is kind of a forgettable wash (minus the episode or two where Gohan was briefly cool again). Only the Frieza retelling stuff in Super feels worse than that to me, and that's just because of how awful the animation is; the actual writing around those episodes is better than the movie they're based on, but it's all buried in some of the worst looking animation I've seen for a show like this."
