If you go to the talk page you can see me arguing with Kojidude trying to get him to show some proof that the attack in question is the Final Kamehameha as I believe that the attack is just a generic attack that whoever wrote the article decided to call the Final Kamehameha. Is there any way to confirm wheather Kojidude is right or not?\n\nStarone\n\nLink to article: Vegetto#Final Kamehameha\n\nLink to Talk: Talk:Vegetto#Final Kamehameha --DesireCampbell\n\nDaizEX forum discussion on the matter, consider Duo's post (old topic, do not reply) [1]\n\nNew DaizEX discussion on the matter [2] --DesireCampbell\n\nHello, all. It was initially my hope to try to have this done as part of Esperanza's proposal for an appreciation week to end on Wikipedia Day, January 15. However, several people have once again proposed the entirety of Esperanza for deletion, so that might not work. It was the intention of the Appreciation Week proposal to set aside a given time when the various individuals who have made significant, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia would be recognized and honored. I believe that, with some effort, this could still be done. My proposal is to, with luck, try to organize the various WikiProjects and other entities of wikipedia to take part in a larger celebrartion of its contributors to take place in January, probably beginning January 15, 2007. I have created yet another new subpage for myself (a weakness of mine, I'm afraid) at User talk:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week where I would greatly appreciate any indications from the members of this project as to whether and how they might be willing and/or able to assist in recognizing the contributions of our editors. Thank you for your attention. Badbilltucker\n\nI just joined, some of you might have already seen some of my edits in the DB pages but anyway hi to everyone that has never heard of me, I will make the most to keep them as top shape as possible as I have tried to do in the past :) -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nAwesome. Welcome =) VelocityEX\n\nWheeeeeeeee! --DesireCampbell\n\nThanks-Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI'd just like to take this opportunity to thank Ned Scott for diving in and cleaning up the main page. Thanks bud. --DesireCampbell\n\nAh, no problem, I just go around and steal good ideas from other projects ;) -- Ned Scott\n\nHehe, I started a temp page for the project by copy-pasting the entire WP:SM page :P --DesireCampbell\n\nTo meet Wikipedia:Verifiability, required for a GA or (eventually!) a featured article, we need sources. Very few Dragon Ball articles are sourced and most of those are from websites. Even wonderful ones like Daizex are just websites and so we'll want some print ones, too. Unfortunately, there aren't very many. And the ones that are there aren't great. But... better than nothing.\n\nAlso, can anyone find online a repository of VIZ and FUNI press releases? I used to be able to get them on Google Groups, which is how I pinned down dates for many things in Dragon Ball (franchise), but bad me didn't know to actually do inline citations then and the work is lost. They also have plenty of marketing spiel, but nuggets of important information like revenue projections, licensing agreements, etc.\n\nI've started a short table just from what I can dig up tonight. Please feel free to add to this.

Yeah, cut that plot recap down to 5 lines per saga (per Toei saga, not Funimation saga). There's no need for every charcer page to have a rehash of the plot. Give an incredibly brief synopsis about his involvement in each saga and link to the saga summary pages appropriately. On the other hand, I think the page could be lengthened a bit by adding a section detailing his name - where it comes from, why it's pronounced as it is, and the similarities he shares with his namesake. --DesireCampbell\n\nI'll work with the origin of his name tomorrow, DesireCampbell can you do the sagas part? --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nOooph. I could, but I'm not sure what everyone else would think about it. I mean, I'll be cutting probably 90% of that section out. I'll make a note on the Talk about what I'm doing first, and get the whole cut done in one edit (for easy revert) just in case. --DesireCampbell\n\nShould we make one of those templates that say \"[Article name] is a part of WikiProject Dragon Ball...\"?--SUIT42\n\nI think it would be a great addition --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nHmm...Let me take a shot at it... -- bulletproof 3:16\n\nOk there... What do you think? Created new temp and new cat. -- bulletproof 3:16\n\nLooks nice. Good job--SUIT42\n\nJust finished adding the new template to a Lot (115) of Dragon Ball related articles, but there are still a lot left; if someone can add it to the video games articles please do it, I'm tired and will rest for a while see you then, what do you think of my job? -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nAnother question- are we going to assess articles?--SUIT42\n\nI don't know yet... since the articles are already being assessed by the parent Wikiproject, Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga-- bulletproof 3:16\n\nI just added the template to the Sagas, movies and episode lists, I'm not sure if there are any pages left if they are just tell me --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nThe To-Do list has been updated! Take a good look at it and help improve it.-- bulletproof 3:16\n\nAdded Senzu to the list of articles to expand, I rewrited it in an encyclopedic tone and did cleanup to this page but it's still to short for an item with so many appearances, maybe adding a list of uses or something like that to make it longer will help. --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nAre there any administrators in this Wikiproject? If not, I wouldn't mind helping in admin related ways, such as deleting pages, protecting pages when necessary, etc. I don't have a clue about anything related to Dragon Ball though, so perhaps \"joining the project\" per se isn't a good idea? Either way, people should feel free to contact me if they need something admin-related doing --Deskana (request backup)\n\nI added myself as a member after having a discussion with another member. Contact me on my talk page if anyone needs anything :-) --Deskana (request backup)\n\nThat's pretty cool to have an admin help out here and there, in case we have a problem. Welcome to the project, Deskana =) VelocityEX\n\nmaybe ill help too Kenn5\n\nYou aren't an administrator--SUIT42\n\nBut you're still free to help in any other way you are able to. -- Ned Scott\n\nMy fellow Editors I look at alot of the article pretaining to good old Dragon Ball and something really gets to me. That is when many of you edit a article and put a movie reference or link on to the article, you guys use the movie number and not the movie title. I feel that it is wrong to use movie numbers. It seems better to use the actual title for the movie. Be it the Funimation version or the Toei Studio version, it just doesn't look right editing a encyclopedia using links saying something like Movie #4 when the link or reference should use titles like (Funimation title) Lord Slug or (Toei title) Super Saiyan Goku. - Heat P\n\nI don't see the harm in this since there were so many of them. And the problems with using the Toei titles have been well documented. Just using the number seems to make most people content enough. JRP\n\nWhat people? Real Dragon Ball fan like us? Thats it. What about people that just getting into DB or doesn't know much about it but wants to read on it. Despite it being a link to the movie article. It should not be title that way and to make this a more general looking encyclopedia site I say use the actual titles not numbers. If so just use the Funimation titled movies.\n\nHeat P\n\nIn this case the best option might be using the names of the Funimation dubs since those are the names the articles themself have, and it's better to use them since japanese titles are so long. Using a shortcut like Movie #12 doen't have an encyclopedic tone to it unless it's Movie #12 Fusion Reborn. --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nThat I agree with. Something like you said. If some don't get what DDF means. He means a link like Movie # 12, Fusion Reborn and by what I myself mean a link like \"the film or movie Fusion Reborn\" and not this way, Movie 12. That there does not seem like the encyclopdia tone DDF meant.\n\nHeat P\n\nSince we are talking about Dragon Ball films, should we include the chinese movie Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins to the project? I don't think we should but just asking what you think --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nHMMM...I have never watch it. The only Dragon Ball thing I never actual seen completely but from what I read and seen in shot, pictures and the short videos on youtube. Naaaaa...\n\nHeat P\n\nJust because it was absolute crap doesn't mean it isn't relevent--SUIT42\n\nI know but it's not made by anyone related to Dragon Ball, actually if I remember correctly they don't have Dragon Balls they have Dragon Pearls or something like that, but if we include thigs that are related we should add Dragon Ball AF right? and since it's not clear I decided to ask for opinions. --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nIf it's Dragon Ball related and has an article then it falls within the scope of the project. -- Ned Scott\n\nWow, so \"even this one\", interesting if an article is related to a project it falls under their classification even if it's an evil hoax designed to raise the fans hope just to let them down later, thanks for letting me know that --Dark Dragon Flame\n\nWe are Wikipedia, we take the good with the bad. Think of it this way, we can use that article to help spread the truth that it is a hoax. -- Ned Scott\n\nI think if anything, we should just refer to them as their proper title. That's my opinion. VelocityEX\n\nHas anyone started this area yet? Also are we still keeping them separate by series or sticking all characters in one page? I'm just worried with the sheer quantity, even if only the few minor characters show up there with actual details, the page might get quite big resulting in poor running for some users (Ever used a complex web page, it makes IE eat up RAM for fun).\n\nAnyway, if someone hasn't created a blank list page for this I'm willing to go to work on it later today when I get back from work. Let me know guys.Darkwarriorblake\n\nWe have lots of character lists they are separated, some by species or by relation to a certain character or saga -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nWe really need to do something about the character references. Nearly every character article has an unreferenced tag, Majin Buu doesn't have one but its references aren't done very well. Anyway, we really should get to that if we want any of these articles to reach Good Article Status--SUIT42\n\nOk, what shall we do about them? I have no idea how to do a reference thingy. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nI don't know how to reference tv episodes which means you have to go find the manga chapters and I imagine that would be incredibly difficult at this point of time nearly what? A decade after it stoppped?Darkwarriorblake\n\nI said character pages not the episode pages.--SUIT42\n\nI just noticed this page needed cleanup (It's on teh To-Do List). I figured it'd be easy to work on this page, considering there is a lot of information regarding these sets. I'm gonna start. Anybody wanna help out? VelocityEX\n\nI did a bit on that page a while ago, but I may look into it again some other time--SUIT42\n\nSo what are opinions so far on the Freeza article? I think it looks a lot better than before, any other changes, comments, etc? Coz I want to get this to GA but without input or other peoples contributions I don't know what else needs fixing.Darkwarriorblake\n\nWhy was my user name removed from the list of members? future_trunks\n\nWe need a List of monsters in Dragon Ball. Toriyama shows that earth is inhabited by three types: Humans, Animals, and these Monster types. That's what Pilaf, Buyon, Baba's monsters, etc. are and there's no category for them that I can find. Evan1975\n\nIt would be nice if the character infoboxes had a place for the seiyū. Evan1975\n\nSo what was it decided would be used for character names? Viz, Funi, Steve Simmons, our own rominizations, what? Takuthehedgehog\n\nMostly the original japanese pronuciation is being used (see Burdock for example) in most cases due to the wide variety of ways to write them or entirely different and alternate names in different dubs; however there are a few exeptions in wich dub names (mostly Funi) are being use as is the case when naming characters that only received name in a dub or characters with complicated names that are either hard to say or remember, but mostly we try to use the japanese names to be more accurate -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nSo, for example, Broly, who's Japanese name is Burori and is a pun on broccoli, would be named Broli? If so we need someone to explain that to them because I tried to change the article yesterday and someone reverted it imediatley.Takuthehedgehog\n\nThe article is Anglo-centred and Broly seems to be the most common way of spelling that based on the westernised version. Besides you can't just go changing every reference from Broly to Broli and leave the article named Broly. Changing Hercule to Mr Satan makes sense because its a completely different name amd the original is Mr Satan. Broly is just based on the area I guess and pronounciation/spelling. I personally vote for Broly.Darkwarriorblake\n\nAh, okay. But why is Burdock so special? Bardock is the more commonley used name and it's only a one letter diffrence. The way I see it it's the same as Broli. Takuthehedgehog\n\nNo, its just used more commonly in the nations that have Funi's dubs as in most cases the perception is that is more popular just because is more used on one's own country, but Wikipedia is not centered on Funi's domain only. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nWhat should the Tsufurujin page be called? It currently uses Tsufurujin, and both dub names lose most of the pun. What are they called in Steve Simmons' subtitles? Takuthehedgehog\n\nHi guys. Is the Super 17 arc officially called by TOEI a saga distinct from the shadow dragon one? Or is this just what FUNImation called it on their website?\n\nBecause from what I've read online and seen from the show, this arc opposes what every other \"Dragonball arc\" (in all 3 series) considers a saga when you take into acount: themes, narratives, plot devices, etc. This should really be part of the \"Shadow Dragon\" arc as 1 long story (it's the same story). It's as if FUNI were to make up a \"Dabura saga\" as distinct from the entire Majin Buu saga. (but if TOEI said it, then I guess that's ok).\n\nI have yet to see Toei divide any of their series into 'sagas'. The whole saga thing isn't official. Most of it's been done by either FUNimation, or by fans. Personally, I think the Super 17 arc would count, as while it is very short, it does mainly focus on Super 17. Most story arcs in Dragon Ball or 'Z' don't really do that (Unless you refer to the Androids, of course) 66.222.198.121\n\nHmm, thats a good point. But like you said: The androids (first 5) had their own story until Cell showed up. All in all it's the: \"Android/Cell\" arc (but FUNI separated them both into their own sagas, even made the trunks episodes into his own saga). But as for the Ginyu force episodes, it's similar to this (they focused on the arrival of the ginyu force and had very little on anything else).\n\nI still hold my ground that the Super 17/Evil Shenlong stories are 1 story/dragonball arc. The fact that the balls cracked caused hell to open up, and then release the evil dragons (all 1 continuous plot, with characters going through \"new\" development which goes through the entire story until the end of the series <IE: Vegeta wanting to catch up to Goku again>. Similar to the android/ginyu argument: the entire \"Bebi\" story didn't really begin until about episode 20, but everything before it was revealed to be part of the same story as it was all leading up to them being on planet M2, but you cant call both stories different.\n\nAnyways, it was fun chatting. I just wanted to share this idea and see what everyone thought of it. It just never sat well with me to consider the Super 17 7 episode thing an entire arc, as it says on the wiki site that it is. take care :)\n\nI think of it is a seperate (albeit small) arc. Just because it has ramifications in the next arc... well, one could say the same of the Saiyan and Freeza arcs, the Daimao and Ma Jr. arcs, and the Pilaf and Muten Roshi arcs technically. One can't really compare it to the Cell saga/androids, because in that case it was one defined story. Dr. Gero made all of them for revenge on Goku. #17 and #18 existed for Cell's eventual completion. Super 17 and the dragons are not remotely linked, aside from the fact that the crack is what lead to villains coming forth. Onikage725\n\nI would agree with you, but even if it's not too well written, Shenron ties everything up at the end of the Evil Dragon fight as if it was part of 1 long story. Also Goku wishes back everyone who died at the start of the big event, and specifically states starting from Super 17 until the end. The villains came from the over use of the dragon balls, and so did the dragons. (The Super 17 battle, which was very very short for Dragon ball, would have been 20 minutes out of 2 hours if it was a movie, was just a big openning to the saga and an excuse for them to make the wish that allowed the Evil Dragons to come out. (they needed an excuse big enough to use the dragon balls again).\n\nWuz up guys. I been gone for a while on vacation with the fam. I was looking over the DB articles and I am really starting to like what I see but something caught my attention as something always does, it's about Gohan and Dabura's fight. Can someone tell me where they read it or seen other than Gohan's hair that he was a Super Saiyan 2 in the anime? Please don't give me that \" Look at his hair its a Super Saiyan 2' hair\" cause that has been discussed many times. Just wondering because I still do not see it. Also if you are going to use the manga for the main source for the articles why but Super Saiyan 2 in the articles when he didn't use it in the manga during that fight? Talking about Dabura's article. You got non-manga usage and in it you say he was a SSJ in the manga and in the anime a SSJ2, but in the article you got SSJ2 when using manga work for the main plot and summary of the article. Call me crazy but does that seem right. So I will not change a thing. I just want to know before I go and do edit it. Does it say somewhere that he was a SSJ2 in the anime, really says it?\n\nHeat P\n\nNo he was SSJ1, it seems people speculate he was SSJ2 just because of the look of the hair, again -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nOk then since there is no source that anyone has give us I will edit it back on Gohan's and Dabura's articles. Please don't use speculation on the articles. please.\n\nHeat P\n\nUgh. Somebody's gone through List of Dragon Ball special abilities and changed most of the move names into English. Was there a consensus on this? For the record, I can't stand it; I can't find anything now. Wondering what the opinion is here before I try to do anything with it. Evan1975\n\nI reverted it to an earlier version, if it changes again find the person's talk page and post it in here. Takuthehedgehog\n\nI already explained it on Takuthehedgehog's talk page. I ain't gonna say it again... Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nYeah there was concensus only two users were aganist the change, we did these just because although it might be confusing to us the casual reader will find it easier to identify the abilities, just check the article's talk page to see how it went; also please don't revert pages without checking the talk pages it's kind of a drag having to revert them back without a justified reason-Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI agree. It is quite idiotic for someone to revert an article without seeing if it was discussed first. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nI don't see any links to any discussions or consensus. If you don't provide any, I recommend Takuthehedgehog's revert. Evan1975\n\nJeez this isn't difficult people, just put one name first then the translation. Darkwarriorblake\n\nHey Evan didn't you read, look at the article's talk page don't be lazy. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nJust to let it clear the final score was 7 users in favor vs. 2 users aganist the change. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nAs I said on the article's Talk, all names follow the same guideline: use official romanizations. Technique names should follow Daimao's official romanization spellings or translations. If a technique is named in a supplemental volume that has no official English romanization, then a standard Hepburn romanization is acceptable. --DesireCampbell\n\nList of Dragon Ball special abilities has been temporarily fully protected. All Dragon Ball WikiProject members, please see the respective talk page to solve the dispute. It seems that we're gonna go by Steve Simmons subtitled names, so let's just get all of the examples from Daimao straightened out on that talk page A.S.A.P.!!! Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nI figured if we're going to use all official English translations, a list of articles that need renaming would come in handy. Here's what I've found, go ahead and add others that you find too, but please only list articles that the character's name is in the title of, as they need to be moved to be changed, unlike lists where they can just be edited.\n\nBroly\n\nTsufurujin\n\nRou Dai Kaioshin\n\nAll android characters, including Super 17\n\nMuten-Rôshi\n\nUranai Baba\n\nPiccolo Daimaō\n\nPaikuhan\n\nDabura\n\nArticles I've found that I'm not sure need renaming are Uub (Dragon Ball) and Majin Buu. Takuthehedgehog\n\nSince when is Dabura not called Dabura? He sure as hell was in the episodes I watched. No-one looks for Doubler. Broly is ok too. Steve Simmons does the translations from Japanese to English for FUNimation. His translation is used for the subtitles for the Japanese version of the show on all of FUNimation's Dragon Ball Z DVDs. Takuthehedgehog\n\nRegardless, the UK version and the US version I have, though I don't know which organisation it is by, both call him Dabura and I'm pretty sure that's more the accepted name than Dabra.Darkwarriorblake\n\nAgain, I reiterate, what we believe is a more proper romanization is not at issue here. WP:Anime states we should be using official romanizations if possible. Whatever Daimao uses is what we should use.\n\nAnd, as I've said before, every character entry should have at least a small section detailing the character's name. --DesireCampbell\n\n\"Piccolo Daimaō\" in the Japanese Wikipedia translates to \"Piccolo Large Devil\" (ピッコロ大魔王) \"Large\", \"Grand\", \"Great\", etc., can mean Dai. Mao is anything that has to do with \"Evil\", \"Demon\", \"Devil\", etc.,: Perhaps this is the name we should use for him, \"Piccolo Great Demon\" or \"Great Demon Piccolo\" (or perhaps something of the nature)... Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nAbout Dabura, yes Dabra sounds unusual but the point of that name is to keep the name puns going (Bibidi Babidi Buu) and it's the best of the romantizations no matter if it sounds good or not, we can't let something as meaningless as that stand in the way of doing things the way we should. In this case the romatization should be used to keep the pun alive so should be the case with Broly. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nHowever not all articles should have the official romatization as title, just tought I should let what I think clear. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nWhy not? If they type in the dub, manga, or some other name it would redirect them anyways. Takuthehedgehog\n\nBecause if we rename all the pages we would have to rename all the links directing there in the other pages and that might take a while, there is more important stuff to do with the Dragon Ball pages like expanding content or doing cleanup. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nA good point. This stuff can wait until all of that is done. Takuthehedgehog\n\nActually, you just need to take care of double redirects when renaming. Normal redirects really don't harm anything. -- Ned Scott\n\nI don't get why Funimation's are 'official'. Still, theres whats 'official' and what people will be actually searching for. Hercule redirecting to Mr Satan, that makes sense, it was a stupid PC name change and most DBZ fans know from net lurkings what his real name is meant to be. But Dabra? I'm not a Dabura fan or anything but who actually calls him Dabra? Naming should at least be sensible. Is Piccolo Daimou actually called Great Demon Piccolo in Dragon Ball? I've never watched it.Darkwarriorblake\n\nHe is called \"King Piccolo\" in the FUNimation dubb. He is called \"Demon Lord Piccolo\" (or \"Demon King Piccolo) in the Viz manga. Since Wikipedia is not censored, we shouldn't go by any of those. We should title the article something like Piccolo Great Devil, Piccolo Large Devil, Piccolo Grand [Lord] Devil, etc. Or, in this case since WP:UE, and for the name to make sense, it should be Devil Lord Piccolo, Demon Lord Piccolo, or Evil Lord Piccolo. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nNo. Those are just titles. His name is Piccolo. We only use the disambiguating title to make him separate from Piccolo Jr. (the Piccolo of the rest of the series.) One answer would be to have Piccolo go to the elder and Piccolo Jr. go to the current Piccolo, but that would confuse more people than it would help, I think. My suggestion is to go with Piccolo Daimao as the elder and not translate the term. (It doesn't translate in a non-ambiguous way, anyway.) JRP\n\nJrP, have you seen the Japanese Wikipedia for Piccolo Daimao? \"Daimao\" actually has a translation if you compare the katakana (or kanji whtvr) only if you have a translator on your computer. The entire name is translated as \"Piccolo [flute] large devil\" if I recall correctly. It is a title, just as King Kokou (king of the Dragon World) or President George W. Bush (president of the U.S.,) get it? Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nI agree, he needs a title to distinguish himself from Piccolo Jr. I think if anything, the title should be somethign to do with 'Demon' or 'Devil'. What is the name referred to him anyways in the Japanese subtitles? 66.222.198.121\n\nI have some of FUNimation's Dragon Ball DVD's that I bought off eBay. The DVD's translator, \"crazy old Steve Simmons\", had his complete name spelt as Piccolo Daimao-sama in the Japanese audio with English subtitles. Which, if it were translated into the English language exactly (word for word), it would be something like Piccolo [flute] large devil-lord. Of course, we'd have to establish a more organized name to have it make sense. But, what we can't do is censor it to something like \"King Piccolo\", 'cause that's too childish and it is unofficial, hence, it ain't his original name. Does everyone understand what I mean here? This would be like how we compromised for Mr. Satan to be Hercule's main article name on Wikipedia because its his original name. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nDoes noone listen to me?\n\n\"Why are Funimation translations 'official'?\" Because they're legitimately licensed products. Funimation has a license for, apparently, all English speaking countries. While there are several English dubs that vary from country to country (or from year to year), the home releases all contain the same Japanese audio with subtitles.\n\nWe use this as our translation of choice because it is (1) accurate, and (2) (more) widely available (than any other English version). This falls in line with WP:NAME, WP:COMMONNAME, WP:MOS-JA, and WP:Anime guidelines.\n\n\"We should title the article something like Piccolo Great Devil.\" No. \"Daimao\" is not part of his name, really. It's a title. Like Muten Roshi, or Kame sennin, or Kami, or Saichoro. \"Daimao\" is used to distinguish one Piccolo from the other. As our guidelines state, we should use whatever name the official romanizations give him. If Simmons translates the name as 'Great Demon King Piccolo', then use that. If he uses 'Piccolo Daimao', then use that.\n\n\"I'm not a Dabura fan or anything but who actually calls him Dabra?\" Um, I do. But that's not the point. What names we choose should not rest on which ones we like - we should rely on official romanizations, as the guidelines state.\n\nHave I not been clear on this in the past? The guidelines are in place, and they make sense. Am I missing some obscure reason as to why we shouldn't follow them? --DesireCampbell\n\nActually,someone else translated Dragon Ball. But that's beside the point. Who here actually has FUNimation DVDs and can check for the names used in the Japanese subtitles? I know I don't have any DVDs, outside of DBZ movies 1-3, 8, and 10-13. Takuthehedgehog\n\nI have a few of Funimation's Dragon Ball DVDs. What would you like to know? Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nI'd like to know what the Japanese subtitle track translates Tsufurujin, Rou Dai Kaioshin, Muten-Rôshi, Uranai Baba, Piccolo Daimaō, and Dabura as. I already know that Jinzoningen (Android in the dub) is translated as Artificial Human, Paikuhan as Pikehan, and Broly as Broli, but I don't know about the other characters since I don't have those DVDs. Thanks PL. Takuthehedgehog\n\nI didn't buy the new uncut DBZ collection yet, but I will as soon as I get paid $_$. But I do have some of the Dragon Ball DVDs. The Piccolo Daimao arc (my favorite since it has the most onscreen deaths) the main names are: Piccolo Daimao-sama, Muten Roshi-sama, Uranai Baba, and that's pretty much the names the Japanese audio uses. I'm not sure about Burori, Dabura and the others since I don't have those DBZ DVDs. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nIn all cases, but especially Muten Roshi and Chichi, punctuation is very important. Is it \"Chichi\", ChiChi\", Chi Chi\", \"Chi-Chi\"... If any accents are used (though I doubt they are) they need to be included as well. Also, I'd like to ask everyone's opinion on what to name Muten Roshi's article: Muten Roshi, or Kame sennin. Is there any reason why one should (or would) be better? --DesireCampbell\n\nJust got done watching DBZ Movie 2 for the first time. In it, Muten Roshi is called... Muten Roshi. Also, Oolong mistakes Piccolo for Piccolo Daimao, and calls him Piccolo Daimao, without the line over the o. Also, Muten Roshi's article should be called Muten Roshi IMO, since thats what most people call him and because Daimao translates Kame Senin as(atleast when Goku says it) Old Man Turtle Hermet, or something like that. Takuthehedgehog\n\nReally? Are you sure Simmons isn't translating じいちゃん (Jiichan) as \"old timer\"? Regardless, if \"Kame sennin\" is translated as \"Turtle Hermit\", then the article, and the character should be kept as \"Muten Roshi\". By the way, is the \"Kame House\" kept as \"Kame\" or changed to \"Turtle\"? --DesireCampbell\n\nI might be wrong. Goku says it while he's in the Hottub in movie 2, so I probably just heard wrong. I'm not sure what Kame House is translated as, nobody said it in Movie 2, or atleast to my memory. Takuthehedgehog\n\nI was just wondering if you knew. I was tinkering with the idea to switch Muten Roshi over to Kame sennin because the house is \"Kame\" house, not \"Muten Roshi\" house. But if Daimao says \"Muten Roshi\" and \"Turtle hermit\", then it's clear his article should stay where it is. --DesireCampbell\n\nSweet. Glad that's taken care off. Anyways, about the Androids. Most fans consider that 'Android' is not a good term to refer to them as. 'Jinzoningen', if I remember, translates to 'Cybernetic Being', right? That might work. Or just have it as #[Insert name here] VelocityEX\n\nNot really \"cybernetic\", more simply \"artificial\" or \"man made\".\n\n(-from daizex.com-)\n\n人造人間 (jinzôningen) kanji sound meaning 人 jin person 造 zô create, make, construct 人 nin person 間 gen interval, space\n\n人造人間 (jinzôningen) kanji sound meaning 人造 jinzô artificial 人間 ningen human being\n\nAnd it's clear that while most of Gero's creations are, in fact, androids, 17 and 18 are clearly cyborgs.\n\nThere are four ways we can choose to name these characters:\n\n1. \"Jinzôningen ##\" - Simply use the original term. It's extremely accurate (as it's the actual word), but not well known, and could prove rather confusing.\n\n2. \"Android #14, Android #8, Cyborg #18\" - Use \"Android\" for characters that are androids, and \"Cyborg\" for #17 and #18 (and maybe Dr. Gero?). This option makes it clear that #17 and #18 are cyborgs, but could cause confusion because, again, the term \"cyborg\" is not used in official English translations - and further, using a separate name for on set of Gero's creations and another for the rest is a bit odd.\n\n3. \"Creation ##\" - \"Creation\" is probably the best English word to describe the broad meanings of jinzôningen. This option would mean using a single English word for all of Gero's creations. Though, again, as this is an un-official term, it would prove confusing due to its unfamiliarity.\n\n4. \"Android ##\" - What I think the best option is, is simply following the naming guidelines we have in place already: use Daimao's official translations. \"Android\"'s not a bad translation, per say - though some meaning is lost, it's pretty close. It may cause some confusion as to why two cyborgs are called \"androids\", but that can be explained easily in the articles. The term \"Android\" will be far more recognizable, simply because it's the official translation.\n\nOf course, I'm assuming that Daimao uses 'Android' in his subtitles. If he uses something else, then, we should go with that. Choosing a naming guideline is hard because it's a balance between accuracy and popularity. Using the direct romanizations would be most accurate, using the most well known names would be popular. We use the official Japanese script translations as available on all English home release DVDs. This option is neither perfectly accurate, nor the absolutely most popular - but it's far more accurate than anything more popular, and far more popular than anything more accurate. --DesireCampbell\n\nI heard that Daimao uses Artificial Human in his subtitles. Takuthehedgehog\n\nReally?! That'd make my day. Does anyone have any of the Cell saga DVDs? Or movie 7? *excited* --DesireCampbell\n\nIf movie 7 is the one with Androids 13-15, then, yeah, I have it (the DVD of course). What would you like to know Desire? Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nDon't tease me! Tell me! Tell me! --DesireCampbell\n\nClyde Mandelin is the DB translator, I believe. I have the FUNI Ma Jr. dvds, and the subs use Daimao . Relevant example-\n\nPiccolo: What business do you have in the Lower World!?! Kami!\n\nKami: Have you just now figured it out, Piccolo Daimao?\n\nIn \"Super Android 13,\" the subs use Artificial Humans. Hope that helps. And for that bit far above, using Dabra would be like using Boo. If Buu is ok, so is Dabura. Onikage725\n\nOkay, before anyone does this again, here's the scoop: In Funimation's English dub they, for some inexplicible reason, decide to say that GT happens ten years after the ending of Z. This line is not present in the original script, and it, like \"Bardock is a scientist\" is completely erroneous. The GT 'Perfect File' books, which are what the GT portion of this timeline are derived from, state five years, not ten. Stop changing dates. Please? --DesireCampbell </wiki/User:DesireCampbell> 13:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nNevermind my previous comment. I thought I was the one at fault, but apparently I changed it to the correct version after all. x_x Daishokaioshin </wiki/User:Daishokaioshin> 23:30, 18 December 2006 (UTC) Haha! You changed the dates back correctly, others have been changing them. I doubt they mean to vandalize, they just don't know the correct information. I hoped that this bit of Talk would deter others. --DesireCampbell </wiki/User:DesireCampbell> 01:10, 19 December 2006 (UTC)\n\nAbout GT, I doubt that the Bebi and Super 17 sagas are 1 year apart, especially with Vegeta being jealous of Goku for being SSJ4, it would not have taken a year for him to react. It more like hints that 1-2 weeks passed between the Bebi and Super 17/Shenron arcs. (FF)\n\nI think the people who change it to 10 years depend on the story. Most people seem to miss that the end of DBZ takes place like 5-10 years after Buu's defeat then GT is beyond that. So if you just leave the story at \"Buu was defeated\" then they must just be skipping the end of DBZ's timeline and adding it up.Darkwarriorblake\n\nAs listed in the \"GT Perfect Files\" books and the seventh daizenshuu, the final scene in Dragon Ball (the budokai with Pan) takes place ten years after the defeat of Boo. GT begins 5 years after that. --DesireCampbell\n\nI agree with DesireCambell. Not only is the source (perfect files) an official authority, it's all we have. But I disagree about what the site says dividing the: Bebi saga and Super 17 saga by 1 year (it's hinted that it happened 1 week or month after). Also we could be a little more detailed about the article- The Super 17 Saga happens on May 7th since it's on the same day as the Tenkaichi Budokai .......and the last scene in GT happens 100 years later again, on May 7th. --FoxFang\n\nOk people as you know one of our Project's priorities is to raise Goku's page to Good Article classification, now the best way to reach this goal is to have as much people as we can working in the article at the same time under the same goal; although the article is a lot better now than what it was it still requires some work, so what I propose is to set a date to work on the page and raise it to GA in as fast as possible (without affecting the quality of the article or doing it in a rush) so we can proceed to work on the other Dragon Ball pages that need work, how many of you are willing to help me raise this page to Good Article and when do you think it's the best date to work on it (I personally think monday might be good since it's one of those holidays that are somewhat boring since everything is closed), thank you all for your time. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI haven't actually seen anyone but me and maybe 1 other doing any actual work on it. I've trimmed down the summary immensely, I don't think you could get it shorter without missing some important plot points. I neutered his techniques which were essentially histories of the attacks and nothing to do with Goku and I cleaned up a bunch of game lists. I can't be bothered working through his transformations though. Darkwarriorblake\n\nI've been trying to cut down the plot recap, and got about half-way before my computer, uh, broke. Now that my machine's up and running again, I can continue my efforts. How does it look so far? User:DesireCampbell/Son Goku (Dragon Ball)\n\n--DesireCampbell\n\nLooking good, I have been waiting for you to add it so I can add the part about his name's origin and with the plot taking less space we can add some other important and interesting stuff, we must remember the article's size (see GA Superman for example it is a big mass of letters that is somewhat interesting to read) is not the only factor needed to raise it to good article, the article must appeal the reader's interest. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI'd like to request some help for the GT portion, if I could. I've seen the series only sporadically, and quite some time ago. --DesireCampbell\n\nApart from the dragon saga I don't think you're getting it any shorter. The Dragon Saga can be shortened though.Darkwarriorblake\n\nActually I think that part must be completely rewrited, just read how it sounds now it needs to be writen in an enciclopedic tone. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nThe article won't reach GA unless it has good references, and so far it has none--SUIT-n-tie\n\nYeah I believe that we must make the changes first since if we add them now and then we add Desire's rewritten version it would be kind of pointless. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI think we should remove the 'In Popular Culture' section. There's only one tidbit of information in there. And I agree with SUIT. It needs references =P\n\nMaybe not remove it just integrate it to the article and move the image to a place where it looks better. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nDoing this here should be a little quicker. Anyone care if I go ahead and merge the last three one movie characters(Bojack, Tullece, Janemba) with their respective lists? I'm sure you know my argument by now. Nemu\n\nHow 'bout a big fat NO!!! Dude, you seriously have issues with characters who appear less frequently in the series. I've said it before and shall say it again, \"As long as there is sufficient information to write about the character, they deserve a main page. Quit being greedy and selfish about how \"you\" want the articles to be. If you redirect without consensus, you'll be reverted and warned. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nIf we said it to him that straight he will nominate them for deletion, but seriously no need for that. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nPL, please just be quiet. You're the one the got me to start up again by posting three weeks after I had gotten fed up with trying just to try to trump me. Really, after you tried to keep the New Vegeta eternal stub, I've pretty much ignored any sort of opinion you've had. Nemu\n\nSilence Nemu! You seriously have issues with articles you find to be \"worthless\" for no apparent reason! I don't even know what the hell you're talkin' about now. \"Vegeta eternal stub trying to keep\"? HUH?!! What are you sayin', eh?! See, this is why I don't understand Wikipedians like you and that Recoome! Both of you are bias, and I don't mean that as a personal attack. Seriously, you guys have got to straighten out and be more like everyone else on the encyclopedia. My point is, just take what others have to heart you guys. Especially for you Nemu. Quit redirecting every main article just because you think they're not worth having a main article. Talk to others before acting as such! As for you Recoome, quit creating sockpuppets! You are only supposed to have one account to edit on Wikipedia. Also, don't subvert to 3rr using confirmed socks either Recoome. It's just ridiculous that you just had to edit war on the Action figure article doing such actions! Mend your ways, the both of you! Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nDo you really have that little of a grasp of English? The article New Vegeta was a stub that would never grow. You tried to keep it because you cannot let a page go. You don't understand that this site is an encyclopedia, not an in depth guide (goto the Dragon Ball Wikia for that). I have no bias. I'm looking at this from a broad perspective. I see DB and it's characters. These minor character mean nothing in Dragon Ball, even less in the rest of the world. You, on the other hand, are incredibly biased. Everything Dragon Ball deserves to stay in your eyes. You would probably want to keep an article on Goku's boots if it was made. When the hell did Recoome come into this conversation? Nemu\n\nAlso,is \"Vegeta eternal stub trying to keep\" what you actually read or were you just trying to act confused? If it's the first, you may want to check if you have Dyslexia or something. Nemu\n\nAnd you say I'm a dyslexic retard?! Nemu, do not redirect those pages again without advising the community. I actually agree with Desire on this one, they have enough content to warrant a page - but not by much. It doesn't mean that you can idioticly redirect them! At least fix 'em up a bit, like I did, but don't just redirect them like that as it causes problems. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nDyslexic does not mean retarded. Dyslexia is when people have trouble reading due to various mixings of words and letters. By your mixing of the words, it seemed like a possiblity to that and your constant questioning of people. The discussion is over. Nobody besides you objected. Please stop wikilawyering. You probably mentioned nothing of this to whomever you contected. Nemu\n\nI suggest you check yourself out Nemu for Dyslexia or somethin' because you seem to have it! Me, Dark Dragon Flame, and DesireCampbell see that the three articles are \"okay\" so far, just fix 'em up a bit rather than retardly blank 'em by redirecting to whatever. Again, you check yourself out, not me!!! Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nHmmm.... looking over all of them, they seem to be big enough to warrant themselves their own page - but not by much. Articles should be created when they can't easily be contained in another article. Characters should be included on lists wherever possible, only breaking off to full articles when they become too large for the list. --DesireCampbell\n\nThey have info, but it's all just right from the movies. It's fine on the larger character pages because, besides Goku, they aren't around for every single second of the series. The movie characters are pretty much cookie cutter characters around for a short period of time. There is nothing to explain besides what's already on the movie's article. Nemu\n\nA character needs an entry - that much is clear. The only choice here is whether to give him his own article, or leave him in a list. The choice to split a character entry from a list to his own page should be decided based on entry length: if the characters entry is so long that it overshadows the other characters on the list, then he should probably get his own page.\n\nAgain, I should mention that I'd much rather a single character list instead of the *looks* twelve we have now. And I think every character entry should be significantly longer than it is now. But that's a whole other thing.\n\nAs it stands now, those character articles are too big to be added to the lists. If someone wants to cull the articles of useless info to the point where it's small enough to fit in the lists, then do so - and I'll give them my full support. --DesireCampbell\n\nI'm pretty sure all three of those could easily be redirected at any time. The only real info on the pages are the plot summaries, which are really unimportant. The entries probably would be fine with a little rearranging. Nemu\n\nWhen a character article includes the line \"Suddenly, 19 receives a kick in the head and is sent flying aside\" you have to admit something's wrong. I love Dragon Ball, and would love to work on the articles, but this WikiProject is scary. I tell you, the thought of having the full weight of WP:DBZ fall upon me for recommending the merger of Bardock's article into a List of characters scares the hell out of me.\n\nThe article on Raditz is just one of the problems. Goku's article says he's a Saiyan right of the bat, when everyone knows Toriyama was making it up as he went along and Goku \"wasn't an alien\" until DBZ. There's an article on the Z Fighters, which is nothing more than another in a long line of lists. There's an article on Bra? Goku's Power Pole has a longer on the show history than Bra! Come on people, what of your ultimate goals?--Nohansen\n\nThe Project is still in its infancy: long term goals haven't been discussed at length yet. Generally, the main goal is to clean out dub information, put in more relivant information, and cut down the total number of articles.\n\nOne specific goal is to delete, or merge, a lot of character pages. There are far too many character pages (including Bra's) that have little or no information on them. These character pages should be deleted and merged into a list. Further, the twelve character lists we have now should be consolidated into a single one. --DesireCampbell\n\nOk, so whenever PL stops his WikiLawyering, I'll get to weeding out the unimportant characters(filler, one episode, generally not note worthy) from the list. Once we have them down to a resonable size, we should merge some of them. Nemu\n\nNow, now... PL's just doing what he thinks is best - just as we are. The whole point of a collaborative effort like Wikipedia is to encourage differing opinions about what should, and shouldn't be included.\n\nI'll try to get a little list made up as an example of what I'm thinking of. --DesireCampbell \\\n\nWith any other person, I'd agree, but PL's opinion is keep everything no matter what. That sort of makes it hard to respect it. At this point, with the rest of the movie characters merged, I can only assume that's he's just trying to hold this up for some reason. I had already assumed at this point that nobody cared besides him due to people editing this project and the related articles without commenting. Nemu\n\nI myself am coming on this issue kind of late but from what I can tell Nemu wants to merge those three movie characters with their respected lists as well some characters like Bra as Nohansen mentioned and Pl dosen't.\n\nWell I looked over them and I am sorry PL but Nemu is right their summaries and bios are just so short to have their own article. Most of their bios is movie summaries something people can go to the movie article and read about if we fix them if they do not mention it already. So putting them in there repected list does seem right or just make a new list of movie characters.\n\nThe only movie characters I see that need their own article which they have is Broly, Coola, and Garlic Jr since they have a series of movies or appeared in a movie and the series.\n\nBoth of you Nemu and PL just need to calm down and think it through first. I agree with Nemu but it wouldn't really hurt too keep them as such but then again other movie character may need their own articles too if we keep it as such like Tapion how has a long history in such a short movie. However it has to be a majority thing to agree on.\n\nSo Nemu please after we on the project agree on such leave then articles be. I agree with you but as I said we ALL need to come to an agreement not just a agruement between you and PL. Just wait and see what others think.\n\nHeat P\n\nI have to disagree with you and Nemu here on why to remove the articles. I think a character (or anything, really) should be split into its own page when the length becomes too great. I don't care if the character is important, or interesting, or on screen for two minutes - got too much info? New page!\n\nAnd one character list - not twelve (seriously, twelve?!) --DesireCampbell\n\nWhile I agree that length should be a determining factor when deciding whether or not a character needs its own article, the question is whether or not the information that makes up that length is noteworthy. Pu'ar, for example, has a fairly lengthy article, yet transitions from a third-rate character to near background status soon after his introduction. Likewise, Marron has a long article, though most of her article amounts to when she appeared and what other characters were doing at the time. I could list some other characters that are in the same boat, but I think you get the idea. ~SnapperTo\n\nYeah, that's pretty much: Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, especially point seven for these articles I'm trying to merge. Nemu\n\nHey Nemu since it seems you like to do work that requires a lot of writting why don't you go ahead and start merging the character lists, that surely is more needed than disscusing if some characters deserve redirects or not. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nMan its like a gestapo in here. Look, there are articles on this site for albums that just feature a track listing. If a character is remotely noteworthy they deserve an article. Bardock, Broly. Maron, no unless there is sufficient data in which case putting her on a crammed list would be non sensical. Darkwarriorblake\n\nThoae albums can actually be made into real articles. They're placeholders until that happens. These articles, though, can be filled with nothing, but a plot summary. Read - Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information Nemu\n\nOK, does anyone have any valid objections to redirecting these pages? WP:ILIKEIT and \"they have info\" are not valid reasons. I really shouldn't have to do this just because DB86 needs to keeps his precious pages, but I guess I do. Nemu\n\nYou know how I feel about it. If these character's bios is just a movie summary then I say merge then. So I agree with you. But wait and see if you get the majority of your votes first. Don't need to start a needless agruement. Heat P\n\nPlot recaps are not good enough. If that's all you have for a character, he doesn't get his own page. Name puns, character design notes, speech pattern information, techniques and transformations, character personality sketches: these are all great sections that every character can have, and can become quite long. Plot recaps stay short. --DesireCampbell\n\nIs that just a general comment or are you addressing someone? Does anyone mind if I redirect them later today if there are no valid complaints? Nemu\n\nHello.\n\nI have depopulated and tagged the above category for deletion. My reasoning is that all characters in it were already in Category:Dragon Ball characters and it can't be precisely defined what a \"supporting character\" is in this series. Beowulph\n\nYeah, almost every character in that list has it's own important role in the series. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI placed my vote for its deletion already. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nI was looking over the Dragon Balls article and I see we left out or overlooked something about the Black Star Balls. That they don't revert to stone when they are used. If they were they would not show on Trunks's Dragon Radar or when Giru turned himself into the Dragon Radar. And remember the Dragon Balls including the Namekian Balls turn to stone until the year has gone by or when the balls can be used again like Namekians is half a year if all the wishes are used and when only one of the Earth's Balls (Dende's DBs) wishes are used half a year too. So it seems the BSDBs can be used over and over if collected in time before the planet they were created on is not destroyed yet. Also that they need to remain on that planet without another wish being used when the year comes to an end or the time of the BSDBs will not reset and that planet will still be destroyed. Is that something we need to mention in the article?\n\nHeat P\n\nIf it's not on there already feel free to add it, sounds like a big thing to leave out. Good job catching it. --DesireCampbell\n\nThanks, just doing my job? Heat P\n\nI went and edit the Dragon Ball (artifact) article, the Black Star Dragon Balls summary with the info I just gave you up top. Can someone go over it and see if I left anything out or fix that summary if they find anything wrong? Thank you. Heat P\n\nRaditz has been nominated for deletion due to little information in the article, and Nappa's article is even shorter than Raditz's. Should Nappa be deleted as well? Takuthehedgehog\n\nMaybe just merge and redirect it to the list?--SUIT-n-tie\n\nYeah, I'd have to agree with SUIT on this one. // DecaimientoPoético\n\nWhile we're at it, I'll suggest Dodoria and Android 19. They're both pretty small. Nemu\n\nI third it here. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nMabey we should make a list of articles that should be deleted? (I know, we've got too many lists on this page as it is, but I still think we should. Trunks' time machine sure doesn't need it's own article, and a lot of other things don't like Zarbon and Bra EDIT: Just found out Bra doesn't have an article anymore.) Takuthehedgehog\n\nI think Uranai Baba and Android 16 are worth a look, too. If you trim Baba's abilities and the plot summaries in Android 16 there's almost nothing left. Also, I'd suggest merging Super 17 into Android 17. It's basically the same character, just the former is the evolution of the latter. On the same note as Raditz, I think Bardock should be merged into a list. There's nothing there and him being Goku's father is not reason enough to keep the article around.--Nohansen\n\nI not exactly sure about Zarbon, but the rest (especially Hope (Dragon Ball)) need to go. // DecaimientoPoético 03:25, 22 February 2007 (UTC) After just looking through Zarbon's page, I'd say he should be merged with the rest of them. // DecaimientoPoético\n\nI just wanted to say that's it's insane that 'Hope' has its own article - but Capsule Corp is a redirect. Frankly, any article that's even suggested to be merged or deleted almost certainly has my support. If it appears like having its own article is unnecessary, get rid of it. --DesireCampbell\n\nOk, I made a list. I think any page that remains in the top section for a few days should be merged. Sound good? Nemu\n\nZarbon looks like it has only a little more information then Dodoria to me. Also, I think Chaozu should be merged into a list. It's just a plot summary and abbility list. Takuthehedgehog\n\nWould a complete list of all current character articles be useful to show? It would allow people to see what there is to work with. ~SnapperTo\n\nWhy don't we redirect/merge all of the really non-important Dragon Ball characters? How about this then: I'll agree to everything if ya leave the most important ones like Son Goku, Kuririn, Master Roshi, Piccolo (and his father), Freeza, etc., because they actually did things that changed the course of the Dragon Ball history forever. The other characters didn't really do something big like these guys did. Get what I'm saying? Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nJust because a character does something important doesn't mean they deserve their own article. Raditz tells Goku that he's a saiyan, but there's not enough information on Raditz to justify his own article. The Piccolo Daimaō article is pretty short on it's own. Mabey we could merge it with Piccolo? Takuthehedgehog\n\n:::::If we're thinking about merging Daimaō, what about Kami? Beowulph\n\nI'm going to add an \"articles to be kept\" section to help give us some perspective. Beowulph\n\nWe could merge Kami into Piccolo also, I think that would be fine. Since they are all originally one being, we could mention that in the opening of the article. Takuthehedgehog\n\nMerging three technically different character into one character article would be fairly confusing. Sections on the list would be fine, and easier to navigate. Nemu\n\nI guess so. So Kami and Daimao go on the list of Namekians and Piccolo keeps his article, Sounds good to me. Takuthehedgehog\n\nPiccolo Daimao and Piccolo Jr. could be merged, if you remove most of the cruft in both articles. They're basically the same character, anyway. Now Kami is a different character altogether, it sould stay as is. --Nohansen\n\nThese lists look solid to me. Nice work, Nemu (and Beowulph). JamesMcCloud129\n\nPiccolo Daimao and Piccolo merger sounds good too. Piccolo is pretty much just Daimao reincarnated. Takuthehedgehog\n\nWe're still going to have a section on the list for Piccolo Daimao, so I do think it would be better to leave him there, and just let the Piccolo talk about them like it already does. I would say the same for Super 17 Nemu\n\nYeah but Daimao would work good in Piccolo's article since they're basically the same character, and it would help expand upon Piccolo's article. Same goes for Super 17, although Android 17 needs to be longer more than Piccolo does. Takuthehedgehog\n\nNow, how exactly are they going to be merged? The problem I'm seeing with merging is that we'll be talking about Daimao, then say he's gone and Piccolo now exists, but they aren't the same. It just seems like it could get sort of messy. It's not really as clear cut as Buu or anything. Nemu\n\nThe are articles on comicbook characters with the same name, say Speedy. The lead section on a merged Piccolo article could read something like \"Piccolo is the name of two fictional characters in the Dragonball Universe. The first, Piccolo Daimao is the evil counterpart of Kami, the God of Earth.\" and from there it goes into Piccolo's bio. \"Piccolo Jr. is the reincarnation of Piccolo Daimao, born after the Evil King's death at the hands of Goku.\" and so forth. It's not that difficult.--Nohansen\n\nWell, what about the different \"Supermen\"? Kal-El, Kal-L? (and I'm sure I've forgotten others). Further: Piccolo, Piccolo Daimao, and Kami are separate characters.\n\nThink about it this way: would you list them as one entry in the list? If they're separate entries in the character list, then they remain separate. --DesireCampbell\n\nDaimao and Ma Jr. are NOT the same character. Ma Jr. was born with a unique soul. He inherited his \"father's\" memories, but he is a different character. You'll note that we have distinguishing articles for Future Trunks and the one from the main timeline. And while we're at it, there are a number of articles on the list to delete that I think ought to be discussed. I mean, I understand that idnividual attacks and Trunks' time machine don't need articles, but Kami, North Kaio, Trunks...these are major characters, no? Onikage725\n\nBut some of these characters don't have enough to write about to need their own article. The information about them would go on a list of characters. Takuthehedgehog\n\nYea but Daimao was like the DB equivolent of Freeza, and noone wants to drop his article just because he only had the one saga. And Daimao left a pretty big legacy too. He also shouldn't be relegated to a list of Namekians, nor should Kami. IF they get merged to a list, there needs to be a demon list made and Daimao would go there (and Kami to the list of deities). Neither of them is a true Namekian after the split. Kami is God of the Earth and pure good, while Daimao is pure evil. No Namekian is shown to give birth to demon-spawn as Daimao can, and his victims are said to be unable to pass into the afterlife (a trait attributed to demons). Ma Junior does not posess this taint, as Kami notes when Raditz is said to have passed Enma Daio for judgement, as he was \"born\" a full Namekian. And Trunks? He really shouldn't be on the same article as Future because they are two different people. They are genetically identical but have two entirely different histories and personalities. I feel that merging the two would just make for clutter. And his article shouldn't be relegated to a list because he is a main character in the Buu Saga (the second longest Z arc if I'm not mistaken), as well as being one of the main characters in GT. That's just my 2 cents on it anyway. And even lil' Chaozu, he's one of the Z Senshi and in a good portion of the series, even if he is the least of the team. He can't be less important than Naruto's Choji Akimichi, yet the folks over there have managed to keep a nice article on him. Onikage725\n\nThe Dragonball characters lists are pretty problematic. Take Kami-sama: All through DB he is a deity, make that The Deity of the Dragonball Universe... but in DBZ he is revealed to be an alien, a Namekusei-jin at that. So where does he belong? I'm of the mind that, if he must be on a list, make it the deities one, that's what he was until DBZ retconned his origin.\n\nAbout the articles with no determined merge location...\n\nIf Android (Dragon Ball) is merged with the List of Androids in Dragon Ball it could turn out a pretty decent article.\n\nMerge Ki (Dragon Ball), Power level (Dragon Ball) and Scouter (Dragon Ball)\n\nRoom of Spirit and Time into Kami's Lookout\n\nKami's Lookout into a Locations in the Dragonball universe or something of the sort. Same with Karin Tower, Serpent Road, Hell (Dragon Ball), etc.\n\nKintoun into Goku\n\nMerge Majin (Dragon Ball) with what used to be List of Majins in Dragon Ball and place Dabura in there\n\nAgain, merging Piccolo Daimaō and Piccolo (Dragon Ball) can work.\n\nBy the way, Karin is a deity who looks like a cat. Where does he belong?--Nohansen\n\nIs he a deity of some kind? What exactly constitutes a \"deity\" in Dragon Ball?\n\nRegardless, I think the place for him is the same place for everyone else: the character list. One list, not twelve. --DesireCampbell\n\nThe problem with there being one big character list is that there are far too many characters. Every henchmen, every one episode villain, every character that seems to have been given a name has an entry somewhere. Of course, even if you get rid of all of those characters, you still have a far too many characters to put on one list. Having a couple, very broad content-based, lists is the only way to avoid a surplus of characters without having 10 character lists. ~SnapperTo\n\nWe definetily need to trim down the ammount of lists to less than five; just take a look at them we got list to list characters related to a alien (Frieza) instead of having them in the list of aliens, seriously we can cut it to at least three lists. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nHas anyone given thought to dividing the characters by story arc instead of race?--Nohansen\n\nWouldn't that at least double the ammount of list we already have? -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nWouldn't that just call for more articles?\n\nAs for splitting up the groups, Saiyans, Namekians, and Freeza's crew are all aliens, so they could just be put with the other aliens. Humans, animals, androids, and \"monsters\" are all from Earth, so they could be put in something like List of Earthlings in Dragon Ball. Then Dragons and deities could be crammed together somehow. Doing something like this would leave just three incredibly long lists of characters. ~SnapperTo\n\nThere's an article for every saga in Dragonball. Take the Freeza arc, for example: delete the race lists, add a \"Characters introduced in this arc\" section and now the characters are in chronological order, the saga articles are a little bit better and problem of \"on what list does this character belong to\" is resolved.--Nohansen\n\nThe issue here is that we want to reduce he ammount of lists as we change it not just change it, there are a lot of unneeded lists right now, I seriously like Snapper2's aproach to fuse dragons and deities since that would cut the ammount of unrequired lists. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI don't like the idea of cutting up lists based on saga - it just seems odd. No other Wikipedia fiction character list is structured that way. Plus, it seems like we'd be repeating what the saga articles are saying.\n\nThat said, the lists we have now are pretty badly divided up too. Like, there's a list for Saiyans, and a list for those in Freeza's employ - Vegeta, Nappa, Bardock, and Raditz were all Freeza thugs as well as Saiyans. Should Dende and Kami be on the Namekkian list or the Deity list? As the lists are now, we're dividing up characters based on race and employment. Many characters can be placed on two or more lists.\n\nIf we simply divided up the lists by race, this would also lead to characters on multiple lists. Where would we list Trunks, Bra, Gohan, and Goten? In the human list or the Saiyan list? This option coule work, but it would involve putting characters on one list, and adding \"see List of Saiyans in Dragon Ball#Son Goten\" on the other list.\n\nSo, dividing the list up by race leads to problems, dividing up the list by saga seems redundant and odd, keeping the lists divided like we have now (by more than one category) is stupid and must be changed. I think dividing up the characters by race is the best option - but I'd also like to consolidate all characters to one list. Long, yes - but easier to find everyone. --DesireCampbell\n\nI actually like the race idea. For the question above about characters on two lists, we could just handle those characters by citizenship. The half-Saiyans would be on an Earthling list. Bah, have to go, I have some ideas tho so I'll list them later Onikage725\n\nI actually think one character list is the way to go, but it would be sooo long I don't think anyone who comes to wikipedia would even bother to use it. Maybe dividing in 3 lists by alphabetical order?\n\nDragonball characters: A-F\n\nDragonball characters: G-R\n\nDragonball characters: S-Z\n\nEven then it'd be hard to navigate and find what we're looking for.\n\nLet me push the Characters by story arc idea one more time. Okay, we have the Saiyan Saga (Eps 1-35) Instead of a detailed summary and a blow-by-blow on the fights, have a general summary: What's the arc about? What new concepts introduces? What are some of the plot twists?\n\nThen, the list of characters, with a bio and an image of how he looks like in that arc:\n\nSon Gohan - Goku and Chichi's son, saiyan/human, trained by Piccolo\n\nRaditz - Saiyan, Goku's brother, etc, etc.\n\nKaoi-sama - teaches Goku the Kaio-ken, blah, blah, blah.\n\nOf course someone like Gohan deserves his own article, so when he appears again in the Freeza Saga add him to the list, have a 5-line summary of what he does in the arc and link to his article.\n\n--Nohansen\n\nI'm going to agree with the dividing up characters by Saga since most of the minor characters only appear once and then vanish. We could probably even merge it into the saga articles themselves as one of the main sections. One of the other benefits would be a pretty healthy trim of the character article itself since all of the characters actions would be detailed in the main saga portion. Beowulph\n\nI'm going to have to again disagree with dividing character lists by saga. The point of the lists are to make it easy to find a character without too many different pages. That's why I'm pushing for one list. Long? Maybe. East to find everyone? Definitely.\n\nDividing the character lists by saga would lead to more articles than we have now. There's thirteen sagas as defined by Toei. We have twelve already.\n\nDividing lists at all, I think, is unnecessary. I think a single list would be sufficient, and while long, wouldn't be longer than other (ie1, ie2 character lists.\n\nFor now, we should focus on cutting down needlessly long character pages, and merging them into the current lists. Then we can easily consolidate all the lists into one. Then, if as a group we agree that that one list is too long, then we can divide it up. --DesireCampbell\n\nI like that idea of some of the names on the list to be merge but some I feel should still have their own articles.\n\nlisted below\n\nand most of the undetermined list. These characters or sectios had a major impact on the series or had a very important role in the series and have enough info to have there own article. The ones on the undetermined list that can be merged without much disagreement is,\n\nTsufurujin\n\nRed Ribbon Army\n\nUub (Dragon Ball)\n\nThats is my recommendation. What you guys think?\n\nHeat P\n\nIf we go the route of adding a \"characters\" section to each saga/movie article, I'd like to see how many character articles we'd actually need afterwards. For example, if we detail what Mirai Trunks did in the Trunks Saga, Androids Saga, Imperfect Cell Saga, Perfect Cell Saga, Cell Games Saga, each of the movies he was in, and place other relevant details on his \"list\" page (name pun, origin, summary etc.), what would be the need for his article? I'm thinking this could apply to most characters in the series. Beowulph\n\nHeh, sneaking on during break, here's a quick thought- what do some other articles do? Do some of the other series' have a good model we could use? Is there a \"norm\" at the moment for anime articles (or a guideline at the anime wikiproject in general)? I'll dig around when I can, but just food for thought. Onikage725\n\nWoah, Woah, Woah, Goten and Vegetto should not be merged. Any main character should have their own page. Vegetto is an important and popular character despite his briefness. He deserves more than a few paragraphs on the list of saiyans page. Darkwarriorblake\n\nBut if you remove the plot summary from Vegetto and trim the wordy description of its attacks, you'd be left with just enough info for a list entry.\n\nI honestly don't understand how Vegetto has its own page. Vegetto is an fusion, an \"attack\", not a character. A brief one, at that. I think it should be merged to Vegeta.--Nohansen\n\nI disagree completely. Vegetto is a character, not simply the result of a technique. Saying Vegetto is simply one of Goku's attacks is the same as saying Gohan is one of his attacks. Both are characters with distinct personalities that show up after two other characters, uh, \"perform a technique\" *wink*wink*nudge*nudge*\n\nVegetto is a character, and as such deserves his own entry. Whether or not he gets his own article is a question of length. --DesireCampbell\n\nIf fusions are characters, how come Kibitoshin doesn't have his own article nor entry on a list? I'm just asking.--Nohansen\n\nHe has one at List of deities in Dragon Ball. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nThat he does. Damn, these lists are a mess. I fixed the redirect on Kibitoshin.--Nohansen\n\nOk, I merged humans, animals, and monsters into Earthlings. Should Freeza related characters → aliens? Wasn't there something about merging Dragons and Deities? After we get these articles all merged, we should try to raise the quality be a lot. Nemu\n\nHey Nemu. For once, I'd like to say \"good job!\" I did a few fixes myself. Do ya like it? Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nIf that's the direction that's going to be taken, then I had suggested merging deities and dragons together (maybe List of higher powers in Dragon Ball?) And if it helps, I had also suggested splitting androids amongst the alien and earthling articles, as well as merging saiyans and namekians into aliens as well. ~SnapperTo\n\nOk, dragons and deities are merged. The dragons could technically be deities, so I think that seems fine. I'll get on the others in a minute. Nemu\n\nOh yeah, if anyone is bored, there are a ton of redirects that need changing. Nemu\n\nI\"m confused. There are characters in List of aliens in Dragon Ball that I don't think are aliens but demons. Let me name them: Janemba, Majin Buu and Dabura. Let me name the reasons why I don't think they're aliens:\n\nJanemba - he was originally an oni from Hell gone bad.\n\nMajin Buu - was \"created\" by a wizard/sorceror named Bibidi. I think he was called a demon or monster in the series, but I'm not too sure about that.\n\nDabura - From what I remember, he was lord of the underworld or somethin'. It would explain how East Kaioshin knew him since both characters dwell in the Other world. Should there be a new list titled List of demons in Dragon Ball or should they be merged with List of monsters in Dragon Ball? Garlic Jr. should be added to such a list and not have a main article since I believe he is still a minor character in the story because he didn't do anything \"big\" that changed the course of the Dragon Ball series. Also, he is more likely a demon/monster than an alien, although he did draw his power from another planet if I remember correctly. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nThey all are demons, so is Princess Snake. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nSo, should they be merged elsewhere? They really aren't aliens from what I can recall. Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nLet's see, they being demons makes them different than your garden variety monster, how about adding them to List of deities in Dragon Ball and rename that to List of supernatural beings in Dragon Ball, how about it? -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI'd support something like that. And Garlic Jr's race refer to themselves as demons, and that \"planet\" is the Devil Star (Makyo). There are a number of others on the alien list as well. Hirudegarn was created in much the same way as Majin Buu, a magically created monster of pure evil. Piccolo Daimao and his minions are another example. Daimao is not a true Namekian, but is rather negative ki given Namekian form. He is dubbed the Great Demon King, his victims cannot find rest, his spawn (aside from Ma Jr) are demonic, and he is susceptible to the Demon Sealing Wave/Mafuba (note the only two times this was used on a non-demon were against Kami; the first time was due to the \"Reverse mafuba\" technique and the second was in the filler Garlic Jr. arc). I'd have to dig up movie 9 to double check, but I always thought Bojack and co. were demonic in nature. They have power ups similar to Garlic and his posse, and they were sealed away by the Kaio (who I don't think normally interfere with mortal affairs, given the no-intereference policy displayed towards the Cold empire). Now Bibidi and his brat, does anyone know off the top of their head if anything beyond \"pissed off wizards with Napolean complexes?\" I only ask because the general seperation of the realms and them being in opposition to the Kaioshin makes me think of a more supernatural nature. Obviously if that isn't actually said anywhere then they are best left where they are. Onikage725\n\nAlso, does anyone else think that the various biographies on the character pages could be done away with? It seems to me that plot summaries on Saga pages or episode summaries with an ep list would serve the same purpose. For example, the Raditz incident is covered on Goku's page, in more detail on Piccolo's page, and on the Vegeta Saga page. Why not just have one place for plot summaries, and have brief bios, creation notes, name meanings/puns, special attacks, other media, etc for the character pages? That could also serve as a good test for who should be merged. If the in-depth play by plays are nixed, and those other sections don't have any relevant info, then they should be on a list. Onikage725\n\nBibidi being a decent adversary for the supreme deities in the DB universe lends me to believe he has to be some sort of \"devil\" figure here wich would make him definetily supernatural in origin; if we are to keep the plot summaries we can only focus them on the caracter the page is about for example we don't want an entry on Goku's page that says and then Piccolo scratched his nose and did a backflip cause we don't really need that, there's a reason for saga pages after all.-Dark Dragon Flame\n\nHey, where was it discussed that Earth (Dragon Ball) and Kamehameha (Dragon Ball) would be redirected? I thought the articles were alright, weren't they? Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nWell apparently a few people decided that 75% of the articles here sucked and should be reduced to list entries. Noone asked me, personally. Yet, going through them, I find myself hard-pressed to disagree. For example, the Kamehameha (and Kaioken, and Genki Dama) all have adequate, detailed entries on the technique list. That kind of goes to what I was saying about the plot summaries. There's no need to say the same thing twice. Onikage725\n\nOh someone asked above about Karin. He'd go on a deity list, at least in the role of servant. Kibito and Popo show up in those places, right? Also I'm pretty sure they refer to him as sama, he's the first stop on the way to the Shinden/Lookout, he grows the Senzu, etc. Also, at least in the anime, if someone who didn't know him acted like he was just some talking cat, those in the know freaked. Onikage725\n\nGuy I was looking at the Template and someone add more villians to the list, Zarbon, Doboria,Nappa, Ginyu Force and A.17. Does these villians real need to be on the list, or are we going to keep them on until we figure out what to do with the merging of articles?\n\nHeat P\n\nI think when we're done we should link to all the characters with their own articles, and then link to the list with all the other characters on it, but that's just me. Takuthehedgehog\n\nTakuthehedgehog, I reverted your redirect to the Earth (Dragon Ball) article for the moment. I looked over the Kamehameha, Kaio ken and Genki Dama articles and saw that they were pretty much needed to be merged as they were plot summaires. However, since the Earth (Dragon Ball) article looked more informal than a plot summary would, I saw no reason as to why it should be redirected. Any thoughts people? Power level (Dragon Ball)\n\nIt was on the list of articles to be merged and didn't look like much other than a list of important locations to me. It would work good on the proposed \"List of locations in Dragon Ball\", but it didn't look like enough for it's own article to me. The information is all in the history so it would only take a copy and paste to get it all back. Takuthehedgehog\n\nI put it on the disputed list. I, too dispute that merge. It is the central location of the majority of the series, and I don't see what is helped by dropping an informative article in favor of like 2 lines on a short list. Onikage725\n\nWhat about List of supernatural beings in Dragon Ball is there oposision to rename the List of Deities in Dragon Ball to this after the inclution of the demon characters? -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nI'm all for that. Onikage725\n\nI with you. That sounds better. Heat P\n\nI moved the demons in the list of aliens to the list of deities, I need to go so I will rename the page tomorrow that unless one of you does it before ;) see you all then. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nOk just finished moving it and checking the redirects; if someone notices a double redirect please remove it I was sleepy while doing so and one might have slip by me. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nLike what you done with the List of supernatural beings in Dragon Ball. Just need to be twiked a little but it seems to be good. But on the List of Earthlings in Dragon Ball and List of aliens in Dragon Ball the Artifical Beings (Androids and Mutant Machines) are on these pages. Do you think they should have there own list instead of saying they are Earthlings and Aliens( List of Artifical Beings in Dragon Ball). They are not really naturally born or magical created except for A 17 and A 18 and Dr Gero. And on Dr. Gero, sorry I don't wanna be a pain but I still think he deserves his own page as a major or rather an important villain. Lets say he deserve his own page a little more than so that have their own like Zarbon and Dodoria.\n\nHeat P\n\nCool. I moved Garlic and Daimao in there too. Wondering still if Bojack should go I can't find my DVD, can anyone help with this?) and Lord Slug's group. I know Slug himself wasn't demonic, but if I recall correctly his minions were. Here's a question though...what to do with Piccolo the younger? Born a \"true\" Namek, he still is the son of a demonic being, has all his memories, calls himself son of the demon or great demon king at times, was resistant to the demonic bite of Garlic Jr's minions, and later merges with Kami (who is on our deity list). And that doesn't even consider that he was born on Earth and grew up their, and would \"legally\" thus be an earthling. Onikage725\n\nPiccolo Sr. and Jr. were both actually Nameks, as of course was Kami. They had forgotten who they were and assumed they were supernatural, but nothing that they did were outside the range of other Nameks, if you include Slug on that list. Whether Piano and the rest of the musically named \"demons\" were mutant Nameks or not was never explained. I think \"demon\" was in this case a bit of a honorific. JRP\n\nThat's the thing though- Daimao and Kami aren't run of the mill Nameks. Kami has \"ascended\" one could say. He is pure good. Daimao is literally his evil karma taken form. His ability to spawn monsters isn't demonstrated by any other Namek (though one could argue that they simply never had a need to). His weakness to the Mafuba is another indication. It is described as a technique for sealing demons. As I noted earlier, the only two times it is used on a non-demon is a case of reflection and then in filler. Also, they do make specific note of his demonic nature in reference to Piccolo Ma Jr. not being the same. Specifically, when Kami hears of Raditz's passing, he mentions that someone slain by a demon (as in, Daimao's victims) cannot find rest. Therefore he takes the fact that Raditz passed on to judgement as a sign that Ma Jr. was different from his \"father\" and had some hope for him. Also don't forget that Kami has access to Enma-sama (something your average mortal can't do without some form of teleportation), and in Dragonball was capable of possessing a human host (again, an ability no normal Namek has ever shown). As for Slug, I don't think he should be on that list, but his minions should be. Onikage725\n\nI have a problem with the Piccolo articles in that nowhere it is acknowledged that out-of-universe Kami and Piccolo weren't aliens. It's not until the Saiyan Saga that these aspects are introduced. Until then, Kami and Piccolo were the equivalent of God and Satan... And Goku was the monkey boy from Journey to the West until it is revealed he's actually an alien.--Nohansen\n\nBojack is a space pirate. So alien. And Vegetto, Gotenks and Gogeta should have their own articles, taku is wrong to just go redirect them. Regardless of their brief nature they are important, popular and most importantly what people will search for. Noone would miss a Pui Pui or Bojack article but Vegetto, Gotenks and Gogeta? Come on.Darkwarriorblake\n\nCan people offer some reasons to keep the disputed articles, so we can decide? Most of the characters were fairly important, but were only around for a pretty short time(Vegetto), or have nothing but trivial things to write about if they were around longer(Videl). The planets can easily be confined to a list or whatever. Kamehameha could probably be condensed onto the list pretty easily. Nemu\n\nKamehameha (Dragon Ball), Planet Namek, and Vegetto were all \"merged\", but all were reverted due to no indication of why being given. You could try merging them again and specify why you're doing so, and see how that works out. If it doesn't, a topic on each article's talk page would probably be the best place to discuss it, as this giant discussion is becoming unmanageable. The rest were all disputed by User:Heat P because the \"characters or sectios had a major impact on the series or had a very important role in the series and have enough info to have there own article\". I'm at least inclined to agree with keeping Power level (Dragon Ball) and Earth (Dragon Ball); the former has had a number of articles merged into it, and I don't know where else it could go, while the latter is more prominent in the series and can have Kami's Lookout, Karin Tower, Room of Spirit and Time, and maybe a few others merged into it. ~SnapperTo\n\nI myself was the one who put the list up but after I looked at it a few names can be merged. Videl, Tao Pai Pai, Yi Xing Long, and Power levels (But what would that be merged with). But others do have a long or very important history that is too much to put in to a merged section of a list. Pilaf is kind of iffie. But the others should be ok to have their own.\n\nHeat P\n\nCan anyone explain to me the reasons why Vegetto is being redirected? Thanks! Gooden\n\nRead. The. Discussion. The basis of it was to decide which pages needed to be redirected. All of the ones on the list were to be merged with the target article, then redirected. Vegetto was on that list, thus redirected. That is all. There was no indepth discussion on each character. Nemu\n\nYou folks can't just pick up and move something without an immaculate reason! I disagree with that voilation. You cannot do something without reasoning behind it. Until you tell me the reasoning, i'm going to get down to the bottom of this mystery, until i know for sure that Vegetto can be an article again, or the reasons for it's redirection is justified immaculately! Gooden\n\nJust drop it. Vegetto was merged along with many oother articles. Stop disrupting the project and get on with your editing.--SUIT양복\n\nWhy should i let this go? I can't just accept Vegetto not being an article! I'm going to investigate the matter. And you people are being absurd by not informing me the reasons to your actions. I believe that this character should be an article, and you folks just don't give a dam about what i say? So this is a monarchy situation now? I thought we should talk about things? No problem, as i told Nemu, if you don't want to talk about the situation, then i'll take into my own hands!

It has references and it's pretty good in my opinion. Any comments before I do so? I'll wait a couple days--SUIT-n-tie\n\nI don't like the way the transformation section looks because of all the images, but I changed it myself by removing all the images and adding one new one showing Freeza's first three forms. Other than that it looks pretty good. I say go for it. Takuthehedgehog\n\nHaving looked at it just now I will say it's the best article we have in this project at the moment, specially because it has proper references wich is what's kepping Goku out of GA right now. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nDid a bit more cleanup myself, changed a couple gramatical things and added/removed links to other wiki pages. Takuthehedgehog\n\nYou should probably go back and find the paragraphs that used to be in the video game section and replace the list. Nemu\n\nYou should also get more OOU citations. I'm not tottaly sure, but it may be too in-universe(compare to some other character GAs). You probably should also cut down the lists into full prose. Nemu\n\nThe list is more useful than the paragraphs that were there before. Considering I'm the one who's done the lion's share of the work on the Freeza article too I won't be impressed if that list just ups and disappears for \"Freeza was also a playable character in BUdokai 3\".Darkwarriorblake\n\nIt's useful if people want a list of games he's been in, but not if they want an encyclopedic overview. Nemu\n\nIs there a reason the list of video games is divided by Dragon Ball series? Some of the games he appears in aren't strictly 'Dragon Ball' games. I'm changing it to just a straight chronological order. --DesireCampbell\n\nCan we separate Freeza's actions in the manga from those of the anime? Additionally, I don't think we should say that Coola is Freeza's brother and Kuriza is his son without some note that those characters are not in the original manga (similar to what we have on the list of Dragon Ball special abilities). Beowulph\n\nI agree about making a note about Coola and Kuriza not being in the actual anime or manga but seperating Freeza's action from the anime and manga would kind of difficult because not much was different between the two other than a longer lenghtly fight in the anime, and the add stuff he did when M.Trunks arrived. If we did that then we have to go on every article and do that to all the characters. It is a delicate subject but it can be done just. Can you give us a small example here of what you mean by separating the manga and anime so we can get a idea of what you really mean? We don't wanna go in make changes and mess up the article and turn it into a bad article again.\n\nHeat P\n\nSure, I mean things like details of Freeza's encounters with Burdock and Vegeta's father and his appearances in the anime (in cameo form) after his death; IMO, we should have non-manga section which contains this anime filler as well as his movie appearances. Beowulph\n\nAt least Coola exists in the DB universe. Kuriza is from a parody. He has nothing to do with DBZ in that regard, its more a popular culture thing at best.Darkwarriorblake\n\nAgain, that brings up Dr. Slump. How is it that Kuriza (who has never appeared in any series, nor movie or TV special, nor the manga) is included as a Dragon Ball character, but Arale (who defeated General Blue in the manga, and the anime, and appeared in another movie) isn't? --DesireCampbell\n\nAs I mention to you in Onio Issues a second ago Dr. Slump Character have their own Dragon Ball list but I do understand what you mean like why they are not mentioned in other articles. but they should be. Now this issue with Kuriza is the same issues we have with Onio on the Super Saiyan page. Just because he on a Self-Parody about Dragon Ball does not mean he should not be mention. He is still a character created by Akira Toriyama in which Toriyama has made Kuriza Freeza's son. So yes he should remain on Freeza's page but only on the relative list under Freeza's introduction picture, or maybe a note at the bottom of the page mentioning their non canon relationship. Beowulph I say I somewhat agree on mentioning some of the non manga stuff but we need to be very careful if we do input it in but again we have to go though all the main or important characters and do the same if they do not have them on their pages already.\n\nHeat P\n\nThen maybe we should put on Trunks page that the kid in Blue Dragon looks just like him but in a Great Saiyaman outfit. It doesn't matter if he was made by Akira Toriyama, its a parody and nothing to do with continuity at all even if it features DBZ characters it isn't DB, DBZ or DBGT so not it shouldn't be anywhere near a Dragon Ball article, Onio or Kuriza.Darkwarriorblake\n\nApparently some of you guys are not getting it. We who care want to put these characters on some DB articles because of their true connection to DB despite being a parody or from another manga. No we should not add some character because they look like someone for DB but has no true connect to DB. Did Toriyama create these characters in other mangas and games like Blue Dragon and Dragon Warrior with a real connection to DB other than the way they look? No because many creations of his all have the same or similiar look because of his artistic style. Kuriza is connect because Toriyama made him Freeza's son. Onio is connected because he is a Saiyan, ya a fat one but one none the less. If it can be mentioned that DB character that appear on in that manga appear on the NM article why not add the connect of some of the characters to in NM to DB? Same goes for DR. Slump for their connect to DB. I said before I do not like the idea of Onio being on the Super Saiyan article but for the good of an encyclopedia it must be is some shape or form. Kuriza is already mention in Freeza's article anyway in the relatives list. Onio is off and on on the Super Saiyan and other Saiyan lists articles when some unknown IP user is not erasing his name. So far these articles have become or remained good article despite these informations remaining on these atricles.--Heat P\n\nIf Kuriza appears only in that story which is a parody, I mean parodies are never considered available or relevant,and in the anime and manga Kuriza doesn't exist. ? And then please who wrote this article could kindly tell me if this son should be considered..existent olso in the normal dragonball z story or not?So why he doesn't live with his father? And who is the mother?\n\nWe are not trying to say he is part of the Dragon Ball story only their connection to Dragon Ball. As mentioned many times that in the manga Neko Majin Z Akira Toriyama made Kuriza Freeza's son. And as for why he didn't lived with his father and who is his mother? Does every character in any anime that is not show with their parents show any explanation on were their parents are? For example Goku, only his father was shown. Krillin has no explanation on who his parents are when he was younger. Does it explain who Freeza and Coola's mother is? No it doesn't. So that question was a very unnecssary question.\n\nHeat P\n\nFellow editors a small but large problem is arising again on the Super Saiyan page and that is the issue if the Saiyan Onio from Neko Majin Z should stay on the page or be taken off for good. Already some unknown IP user went and erased it despite the majority rule on it. I would fix it but we need to have a vote on this. So to fix this I will bring it here so we can settle this once and for all.\n\nI myself agree to put him on and keep him on the page. If you want to know my reasons go to the talk:Super Saiyan page and read why. Anyone else agrees or disagree?\n\nHeat P\n\nOnio is a Super Saiyan - but he's not from the same series as, um, every other Super Saiyan. So, perhaps he should be listed, but under a different header than the others, or clearly indicate that he's not from a Dragon Ball series. --DesireCampbell\n\nThat's sort of discriminating; he is a SSJ and all SSJ have the right to be on that list self parody or not. -Dark Dragon Flame\n\nWell, the contention is that the list should be about not simply \"Super Saiyans\", but \"Super Saiyans in Dragon Ball\". Adding Onio to the list without specifically pointing out that he's not part of the Dragon Ball series would be misleading.\n\nThis brings up Neko Majin Z. How should we handle it? Do we include characters from it? Like Onio and Kuriza? They aren't part of the Dragon Ball series any more than Doctor Slump is. --DesireCampbell\n\nWhy not just add a Notes section at the bottom of the article and put something thats says... Although Onio is not part of the Dragon Ball series he is shown to be capable of transforming into a Super Saiyan in the parody manga, Neko Majin Z.. Then he can be removed form the list of Saiyans that reached SSJ 1 in the article, since there would already be a note at the bottom that states he is capable of transforming into a Super Saiyan without confusing the reader into thinking he is part of Dragon Ball.-- bulletproof 3:16\n\nSounds like a good plan for Onio (the article's about Super Saiyans in general, not just Dragon Ball Super Saiyans). But what about Kuriza? He's connected to Dragon Ball, but he's not actually part of it - and yet he's listed as a DB character.\n\nBut then again, he's playable in DBZ 2...\n\nWe should either cut him out, or include all of NMZ's characters. Having a character entry for Kuriza and not Onio makes no sense, \"all or nothing\" as it were. --DesireCampbell\n\nWell Desire from the comment about \"Adding Onio to the list without specifically pointing out that he's not part of the Dragon Ball series would be misleading.\"? Well the thing was it was mentioned on there a few months ago but for some reason it was erased that he was part of the Neko Majin Z manga. But I agree with the concept of putting a note on the botom of the page, mentioning next to his name he is a NMZ character, or create another section on the page on him but unless we turn the article into Super Saiyans (Dragon Ball) or something of that nature he must be included "
