        "text": "I think GTAV is the only one in the series where the gameplay felt good enough all-around to keep me coming back periodically over the years since its initial release.\n\nI am looking forward to GTA6 on that front (gameplay), but I admit that GTA's storytelling has never really been my thing. I think I appreciate them chasing a tone that largely felt distinct for a while after GTA III, but the various copycats and even its own internal storytelling just kinda felt like it caved under its own weight a bit.\n\nRDR2's storytelling was fantastic though, and if Rockstar has found a way to take that kind of tack and apply it to a modern setting and kinda ditch the mega cynicism of the previous GTAs and manage to strike a good balance of parody and humane drama without going so, so, so sardonic, then I think GTA finally fully realizes itself with 6 for me. So I'm excited, but I say that as someone who only ever really loved the gameplay of V and never really loved the storytelling of any of them.\n\nFuck GTA and I don't even want another RDR for now. I'll play GTA 6 when it's absurdly cheap or on some sub if I ever feel the need and not follow the story probably, just do shit until I get bored.\n\nHaving played 2, 3 and VC, I skipped high school to go rent San Andreas and play it all morning with some friends at a rehearsal place and then all weekend at home.\n\nI got an Xbox 360 and more or less back into videogames full steam again after getting hyped with some GTA 4 trailers and shit. The game didn't deliver but I finished it. And loved my 360 and eventual ps3.\n\nGot hyped as hell with RDR and it was very nice and even played online with friends.\n\nStill got GTA 5 day one on PS3 and suffered it until the end of the story and many side activities. Much better than 4 in everything but the Euphoria engine use.\n\nRDR2 was the best game by Rockstar I played so far when I got it day one and played for months (also even online). Had my fill.\n\nNot anymore. Saw the trailer for 6, zero hype, found it disgusting even. Much more exciting games to look forward to personally.\n\nFor GTA, the last one I liked was San Andreas. Haven't cared about the series at all since then, so I'd say I'm over it. But 1, 3, and SA got a lot of play out of me when I was a kid.\n\nMortal Kombat is another franchise I used to love, all the way up until 9. 9 was awesome, the absolute peak of the (mainline) series for me. X started letting me down during the roster-reveal process. Most of my favs weren't there, and I didn't like the new characters either. Still, I bought it randomly when I saw it on sale for like $20 later. Played through it once with Sub-Zero and never touched the game again. Didn't like the boost in speed X had over 9, too, on top of the disappointing roster.\n\nHonestly, the only thing I want from MK now is a port of Shaolin Monks.\n\nOnly ever played actually GTAV (played GTAIV occasionally at friends' houses, but that was just taking turns killing people and trying to stay alive for as long as possible), and I actually enjoyed it and played the story all the way through like 3 times, but I came back like a year later and just moving the characters around felt absolutely awful to the point I wondered how I played it so much in the first place. Played some missions and the insanely restrictive design really started to bother me (it really feels like you turn left when the game wants you to turn right and back to the last checkpoint). It completely killed any desire I had to play RDR2, which from all I've read about it doesn't change any of those issues, and as a consequence I also don't really care about GTAVI at all. I'm sure it will sell gangbusters but only way I would play it is if I got it for free.\n\nDefinitely still some love there, but they have to win me back over. 4 and 5 both had big flaws that kept me from enjoying them outside of doing the story and the occasional side mission, just driving around etc. Mafia is still the best 3D open world crime and car game, but by the looks of it GTA6 finally might become what I envisioned GTA always could and should've been: more grounded, less reliant on the parody on America and silly jokes, more authentic and real-to-life in its driving, the city it's based on, the things you have to do and can do to live life, complete missions in all kinds of creative ways, the police response, jail and or prison system and less of a rags to riches story, which GTA5 partially already did. Playing as a woman should also really add a new element to the game. The only way this game could really let me down if it's still the same old GTA, but more realistic graphically and actual life-like gore. I don't need to see intestines, shredded arms and other body parts accurately reacting to being hit with a bullet / sharp object etc. That could really turn me off, though I might just drive around the city since it's the only game I expect to have next gen graphics in an open world where you can just explore any part you want as you would in real life."
