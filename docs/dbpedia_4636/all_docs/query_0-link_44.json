        "text": "By Jeremy Carden\n\nI am not sure if this was already mentioned in one of my previous blogs, but I was originally against the idea of Goku and Vegeta fusing during the Tournament of Power.\n\nYes, this went for both Gogeta (Fusion Dance) and Vegito (Potara Earrings).\n\nI felt like the Tournament of Power had already handed out enough transformations, power-ups, fusion (Kefla and the Universe 6 Namekians). However, I think the change in tone of the final battle between Universes 7 and 11 has given me a new perspective about fusion.\n\nGoku and Vegeta fusing now would seem appropriate instead of being nothing more than mere fan service like it was during the Zamasu/Goku Black arc or at the end of GT.\n\nIn the last episode, Vegeta said that he was willing to do whatever it took to defeat Jiren. 17’s sacrifice to buy the Saiyans sometime for them to recover some stamina would have been the trigger for them to fuse.\n\nThe Saiyans pulled out all the stops to defeat the powerful alien of Universe 11. They tried a Spirit Bomb, Kaio Ken times 20, Ultra Instinct Omen, Final Flash, Limit-Breaker Vegeta, etc.\n\nHeck, Goku even organized a coordinated attack with 17 and Vegeta and that still wasn’t enough!\n\nWith both warriors barely able to stand, they refused to surrender considering Vegeta’s promise to Cabba and Goku’s resolve to avenge 17.\n\nIf done right, I believe this would have been one of the most epic battles of the entire franchise. Yes, I am certain that we would see very powerful attacks and fight sequences. However, I think the meaning behind the battle would be even greater than the fight itself.\n\nJiren does not trust anyone except for himself and his own belief in absolute power standing above all.\n\nWho better to show Jiren that trusting each other and what it means to draw strength from a desire to protect something other than yourself than Goku and Vegeta?\n\nRemember that they made it clear during Resurrection F/Golden Frieza Saga that they would rather fight alone without helping each other due to their pride.\n\nThey did put their differences aside to fuse into Vegito to face Merged Zamasu because the stakes were way too high for either one of them to handle alone. It was for the sake of saving Trunks’ timeline.\n\nHere the same rules apply because they would be fusing to save their entire universe from being erased.\n\nSince Dragon Ball Super is ending soon, it was just revealed that Goku would be obtaining full mastery of Ultra Instinct. This new level of Ultra Instinct will have the Saiyan sporting white/silver hair. Fans are already split over this new form, but I will wait until I see it in the anime before I form an opinion of my own.\n\nWould Gogeta or Vegito have a mastered version of Ultra Instinct if Goku and Vegeta fused? I would like to say yes because both Saiyans had reached a limit-breaker form.\n\nHaving them fuse with Vegeta (attack) and Goku (defense) having one piece of the puzzle that is Ultra Instinct would have been amazing to see!\n\nIn the end, Jiren would eat a piece of humble pie while finally accepting the fact that trust is not a weakness but a strength. It is something far more absolute than any level of strength of that Jiren could achieve on his own.\n\nGogeta or Vegito should be more than capable of handing Jiren. Considering that Goku with Ultra Instinct will being giving Jiren a run for his money, I do not believe that a Goku/Vegeta fusion would not be able to get the job done.\n\nYeah, I might be looking too deep into this subject, but I’d much rather see a brotherhood between these Saiyans to show this emotionless bastard what ‘absolute power’ truly is!\n\nThoughts?\n\nBe sure to follow me on my Youtube channel where I follow all things anime related:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYMDpWqlAAAoMZbwIXeL1UQ\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nFor those of you that have not watched Episode 126, I would suggest clicking off this blog immediately to avoid spoilers.\n\nIf you watched the last episode of Super, I am sure you are aware that Toppo was eliminated by Vegeta’s Final Explosion sending him out of bounds.\n\nHowever, I think that Toppo was defeated much too quickly. Considering how awesome it was when he powered up to his God of Destruction state, Episode 125 was amazing compared to this episode. I am not saying that I disliked Episode 126, but it felt rushed for the most part.\n\nThe first half of the episode showed Toppo blowing up more rocks than inflicting damage on Android 17. Heck, the first 2-3 minutes of the episode was literally the last couple of minutes from last week’s episode!\n\nI was also cringing at the thought of Piccolo and Beerus being excited that #17 was able to trick Toppo into being covered with rubble from the arena. Don’t get me wrong, it was a crafty strategy that worked. However, I can’t believe they thought a God of Destruction tier opponent would be overtaken by rocks of all things.\n\nOne of the most epic scenes from last week’s episode was how easily Toppo defeated Frieza. #17 tossing that rock to prevent Frieza from being eliminated led a lot of viewers to believe the Frost Demon would be unconscious for at least one or two episodes. However, Frieza was back in this episode like nothing happened a few seconds ago.\n\nBasically, the first 7-9 minutes of the episode was a game of cat and mouse between Toppo, Frieza and #17 like it was in the last episode. Vegeta got forced into fighting Toppo instead of him confronting the “second fiddle” of Universe 11 as the preview had viewers thinking he would.\n\nI think for a solid minute, Vegeta was being bombarded by energy blasts from Toppo. During this entire scene, I was thinking #17 and Frieza would try to distract Toppo for Vegeta to counter. It just seemed like those two disappeared as soon as Toppo started attacking the Saiyan Prince.\n\nHonestly, I did not enjoy this fight as much as I thought I would. As I mentioned before, it seemed like Toppo was being rushed off the arena. The dialogue between Toppo and Vegeta was more interesting than the actual fight. Last week, Toppo was dominating his opponents. This week, Toppo was being knocked around like a ragdoll by Vegeta. It would have been better if their battle was at least two episodes. Have Vegeta struggling at first, but then pushing Toppo back after gaining a new sense of resolve by thinking of his loved ones.\n\nYes, I understand that Super is ending in about five episodes. However, this is going to lead to a very rushed ending that will leave a sour taste in the mouths of fans. Seeing the beam collision between the Final Flash and Toppo’s destructive energy was cool. Though it just felt too rushed for me to enjoy the scene. Vegeta thinking about his family and promise to Cabba was interesting. It showed the character growth that he has had since Z. Toppo was almost a representation of Majin Vegeta.\n\nRemember that Toppo threw away everything that made him Toppo. He let go of his sense of good, evil and most importantly his justice. Just as Vegeta let go of what he considered to be petty attachments for Babidi to take his soul to gain enough power to close the gap between himself and Goku.\n\nGoing even further back into the Z series, remember that Vegeta told Goku to let go of his soft-heartedness to defeat Frieza. On the contrary, it was his soft heart that allowed him to become enraged enough to achieve the Super Saiyan transformation.\n\nThis was one of the reasons why the Vegeta vs. Toppo fight should have been extended for at least another episode. We got to see Vegeta draw strength his family. This is very ironic because in the episode “Vegeta’s Respect”, Vegeta questioned if Goku had such amazing power because it was his sense of duty to protect his friends and loved ones. However, when Vegeta found himself with a family of his own, he did not get any sort of power increase.\n\nAll of that made the moment where he berated Toppo for surrendering his justice even better. The problem was that the scene was over in the blink of an eye, and did not have enough time for those words to sink in. There was more time spent on Vegeta’s fists pounding Toppo in the face or destroying the energy blasts sent his way. All of that looked good, but it would have been cooler to see Toppo somewhat second guessing his decision.\n\nEven though the Final Explosion was incredible to see once again, this fight did not seem worthy of one. Vegeta did not seem to be having that much of a difficult time against Toppo that he would have to resort to using his suicidal technique.\n\nAfter Vegeta lashed out at Toppo, he was not able to even land a hit on the Saiyan. All of this made Toppo’s feats in the last episode even less impressive because a few seconds later Vegeta is beating the tar out of him.\n\nIt appears that Super seems to have allow these fighters to use techniques that have life-threatening effects doing nothing more than lead to exhausted from a severe loss of energy and stamina. We saw this with the Evil Containment Wave in the Goku Black Saga when Goku used it on Zamasu in the manga. He did not have enough energy to go Super Saiyan Blue but resorted to Super Saiyan God to fight the immortal Kai. Even Roshi used the wave several times in the tournament without dying!\n\nApparently, if a character is powerful enough then their ki is severely drained but not the entirety of their life force.\n\nIt reminded me of the videos games where Majin Vegeta uses the Final Explosion but survives with only one hit point and nearly zero ki left.\n\nOverall, Toppo was wasted in the Tournament of Power. Not only did he fail to eliminate even ONE opponent, but he had more success blowing up the arena than knocking off fighters.\n\nNow, why did I mention that Toppo should have been the final opponent?\n\nIt all goes back to how Super began. This series started with the introduction of god-tier characters like Whis and Beerus. The challenge that Goku and Vegeta faced was gaining the power necessary to compete with these beings.\n\nSuper should have ended with Goku and Vegeta overcoming someone who is in the same league as a God of Destruction. If anything, I think it would be like a graduation or right of passage for them.\n\nToppo represented what Goku and Vegeta declined from Whis. They turned down the chance to be trained as the next God of Destruction of Universe 7. Vegeta asked Whis to take him on as a student, but Whis mentioned that he would only train the next God of Destruction.\n\nAfter the battle with Beerus in the Battle of Gods movie, Whis asked if Goku would like to take Beerus’ position after he died. The Saiyan turned down the offer, but he was more than willing to join Vegeta on Beerus’ planet to train.\n\nInstead of sharing how to utilize the powers of a God of Destruction, it seems like Whis was more focused on teaching the Saiyans the following things:\n\nKi control\n\nSensing beings with divine energy\n\nRecognizing their flaws\n\nGoku is too relaxed leaving himself open to attack\n\nVegeta is too stressed which prevents him from reacting fast enough in combat\n\nLearning how to work together\n\nLetting their bodies act naturally in combat by fighting without thinking\n\nUltra Instinct; something even Beerus has yet to master\n\nWhat made the training more effective was the Saiyans sparring with each other. Whis commented that those two training together was advancing their skills even faster than training with him.\n\nWhile they were training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber in preparation for the Universe 7 vs. Universe 6 Tournament, Goku mentioned that sparring with Vegeta was allowing him to see his own weaknesses. Vegeta begrudgery agreed with that comment before going at it again with his rival.\n\nThe one thing Whis was unable to teach his students was how to work together. These two did not mince words when expressing their desire to get stronger and fighting separately instead of as a unit.\n\nEven Whis pointed this out when Jiren was being thrown off balance by Goku and Vegeta after the Saiyan Prince reached his new limit-breaker form. The Saiyans were fighting at the same time against Jiren, but they were not synchronized which proved effective against the silent alien.\n\nConsidering that Vegeta gave his all against Toppo, I do not think he and Goku will be fusing against Jiren. I believe #17 and Vegeta will be eliminated at some point before the finale. The last Universe 7 fighters will be Goku and Frieza.\n\nNothing is confirmed, but I do not doubt that these two will be the last ones standing based on a Dragon Ball Heroes trailer last year. In the trailer, we saw Jiren standing against Golden Frieza and Goku. I think the finale will be Goku once again using Ultra Instinct to fight Jiren.\n\nNot to mention, Frieza was nowhere to be seen after the Final Explosion. We know that Frieza was not eliminated because he was not teleported to the sidelines with the gods and other defeated fighters. I think he will be in hiding until the right moment to either land a decisive blow or have Jiren and Goku eliminate each other so he wins the Super Dragon Balls.\n\nOverall, Toppo should have been the final obstacle for Goku and Vegeta to overcome. Either by Fusion, tag-teaming or mastering their limit-breaker/Ultra Instinct powers, the Saiyans could topple the God of Destruction candidate to save their universe.\n\nBy extension, there would be nothing left for Whis to teach them. Perhaps at some point they could challenge Beerus again, but for now they could move on with their lives away from Beerus’ planet.\n\nThis could explain Goku’s blue gi at the end of Z. However, those are just my thoughts on the subject because Toppo seemed to be a much more interesting character than Jiren. Not just in his personality, but also in his characteristics and justice-themed attacks.\n\nToppo throwing away his beliefs in favor of destruction is a contrast to Vegeta holding onto his pride and Goku holding onto to his battle hungry spirit. That is why these two could not become the God of Destruction of Universe 7 because doing so meant letting go of who they are.\n\nIf you liked this blog, I would suggest checking out the video below on my Youtube channel where I talk about all things anime related:\n\nBe sure to follow me on my other social media outlets:\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nDBZ Facebook Page\n\nAnime Youtube Channel\n\nby Jeremy Carden\n\nObviously, this post will contain spoilers about the results of Dragon Ball Super Episode 116. Make sure you take that into consideration before going any further.\n\nNow, I am glad that this episode took its time in terms of having the characters describing the amount of power each fighter had. However, I think that Kefla was way too overpowered!\n\nFor starters, Whis stated that Super Saiyan Kefla’s power rivaled that of the Universe 7 Spirit Bomb; which Roshi said would have defeated Jiren had it hit its target. This explains how Kefla was able to push Goku far enough for him to reactivate Ultra Instinct.\n\nAfter she went Super Saiyan 2 against Goku, Piccolo theorized that her power might have even surpassed Goku’s during his first bout with Jiren using Ultra Instinct!\n\nBefore charging at Goku, Kefla boasts that she feels like her power could destroy an ENTIRE universe!\n\nIt is hard to believe that only a couple of days ago, these female Saiyans did not even know what Super Saiyan was. Now, they have obtained one transformation after another, and Potara on top of that!\n\nFans have been in an uproar about the Universe 6 Saiyans obtaining all of these transformations with ease, but Universe 7 Saiyans had to go through years of training to obtain their power.\n\nI do not fault Cabba at all because for the two levels of Super Saiyan he has gained, he had to actually work for them! His body was nearly broken and his emotions were pushed to the limits. Even though he is weaker than Kale and Caulifla, I think his characters speaks volumes above the girls.\n\nAfter becoming enraged over her attacks not hitting Goku, Kefla digs even deeper for more power. Cabba states her power is swelling even larger than before, and Roshi says Goku would lose if he got hit with even one of her attacks at this level.\n\nIn the video below, I go into far more detail about Kefla’s power. However, I think that she was written to be too much of a good thing. Yes, it was good to have female Super Saiyans introduced into the franchise, but it was all too much too soon.\n\nIt is crazy to think that if she went Super Saiyan 3, her power would have been multiplied by four. However, I think that four would have been the minimum increase because of her bottomless potential! For all we know, she might have obtained some sort of Super Saiyan 3 Berserker transformation! Which I think would have been the trigger to defusing Kefla before the battle could be won.\n\nRemember that Super Saiyan Gotenks could only be utilized for five minutes before Goten and Trunks’ Fusion Dance would split. So, Gotenks had to think carefully before using this form.\n\nBased on the two pictures above, I actually thought that she was going to go Super Saiyan 3 based on her frustration and posture. That hunched positioning of the body is the typical stance for someone about to go Super Saiyan 3!\n\nConsidering all of the power that she was using, I was not going to be the least bit surprised had she defused before landing a finishing blow on Goku.\n\nI dare say that she may have been able to surpass even Jiren! That might come across as an unbelievable statement, but look at what the writers have done with her so far.\n\nOverall, I have watched the episode around eight times alright. It literally felt like a Dragon Ball Z episode because the first 8-9 minutes consisted of nothing but Goku and Kelfa powering up while everyone is in awe of their strength!\n\nI was a bit bored in the sense that watching two characters fighting, but one not being able to land a blow can get kind of old. Anyone reading this a Pokemon anime/video game fan?\n\nDon’t you feel that same level of annoyance whenever an opponent uses Double Team, Sand Attack or anything to increase their ability to dodge attacks? It gets so annoying because the battle drags on longer than it should because one Pokemon can’t land an attack at all, and their opponent just attacks whenever it wants to.\n\nOne of the worst examples of this was in the Black and White anime (arguably, the worst Pokemon series). It was during the finals of the Jr. Cup World Tournament between Trip’s Serperior and Ash’s Pignite.\n\nDuring this tournament, Serperior was able to make quick work of every opponent that it was up against. To add insult to injury, this was the only Pokemon that Trip used in the entire tournament. Pignite did everything that it could, but none of its attacks landed.\n\nSerperior was just using its natural speed without the use of a move like Double Team and it was able to move around each attack like it was nothing. Heck, Pignite was spamming Flame Charge to increase its speed, but even that did not work! That resulted in probably one of the worst battles to watch because it was about five minutes of straight attacking and dodging until Serperior won…\n\nI did not feel as upset about watching Goku and Kefla but it was almost getting to that point. However, Goku made up for it with that EPIC Kamehameha to the face! It was so epic that we had to see it THREE times from different angles before Kefla was knocked out of the match.\n\nAt least in this episode, we get a twist since Whis points out that even though Goku is handling Kefla with ease, he can’t utilize Ultra Instinct when he attacks because he is still “thinking” of the attack instead of naturally allowing himself to attack. That explains how Kefla as able to get up and dust herself off after each attack.\n\nThat is kind of ironic because Kefla’s attacks had the potential to defeat Goku if even one blast landed, but none of Goku’s moves that made contact could finish the job!\n\nMaybe he will be able to master Ultra Instinct before his next match with Jiren.\n\nDo you think Kefla was too overpowered? Do you think she could have defeated Jiren had she obtained Super Saiyan 3? Are you a bit surprised that she did not defuse after exhausting so much power as an enraged Super Saiyan 2?\n\nBe sure to subscribe to my Youtube channel for more videos on the Dragon Ball series:\n\nJust Covering Comics\n\nAlso, LIKE my Dragon Ball Facebook Page where I post in-depth discussions on the series as well:\n\nSuper Saiyan God Vegeta\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nBeerus’ brother from Universe 6 has shown himself to be a pretty interesting character. We have not seen too much from him in the anime, but we have gotten a glimpse of his character in the manga.\n\nWe already know the basics in terms of who he is and what he does. Champa is Beerus’ brother from the universe connected to his. He is also a God of Destruction, and has an attendant (Vados) who assists him in his role.\n\nHe and his brother used to fight in the past, but their brawls usually resulted in galactic destruction (as seen in a flashback in the manga). Because of the destruction linked to their physical confrontations, we learn that they now have food competitions. Basically, they compare foods from Universe 6 and Universe 7 to see which one has the best dishes.\n\nConsidering that they are brothers, I can understand that there is a natural rivalry between the two just like normal siblings. However, Chama seems to be hiding something from Beerus…\n\nThis goes back to the manga because he and Vados are trying to navigate around Universe 7 without being detected by Beerus.\n\nWhen they are first seen in the manga, they see Beerus fighting against Goku on King Kai’s Planet. They use this opportunity to continue their search for the wish-granting orbs.\n\nLater, they detect Whis and Beerus going to Earth (in the search of the Super Saiyan God), and Champa ventures to another part of the universe.\n\nEventually, Old Kai and Kibito Kai are spotted spying on Champa and Vados. It was right after a planet was destroyed by the pair because it was not the one they were searching for.\n\nThe kais found out that they are looking for the Dragon Balls, and are approached by an irritated Champa. He demands to learn what they had overheard, but they denied hearing anything at all.\n\nSoon after, Champa destroyed one of the Frieza Force ships that was searching for the Dragon Balls.\n\nHe and Vados decide to head back to their universe, but only after they find a souvenir for Beerus.\n\nIn anime, Whis and Beerus are heading towards Earth to witness the battle between the Super Saiyans and Golden Frieza. Whis notices someone else traveling a great speed, and it turns out to be his sister.\n\nVados and Champa are face to face with Whis and Beerus. The two brothers stare each other down, and Champa orders Vados to take out Beerus. He says that the reason he does not want to fight is because he is too lazy. This mirrors what he said when he ordered Vados to destroy a planet because it was not one of the Super Dragon Balls.\n\nBeerus demands to know what he is doing in his universe, but Champa says that it is nothing suspicious about it before departing. After that, Beerus and Whis continue on their journey to Earth. Champa and Vados go to another part of the universe to continue their search, and that is the last time that we will see them until the Champa Saga starts tonight!\n\nIn both the anime and manga, Champa seems to be hiding something from Beerus. We eventually learn that he is searching for the Super Dragon Balls which are planet-sized orbs.\n\nOriginally, I thought that both Universe 6 and 7 each had a set of these Super Dragon Balls.\n\nHowever, it turns out that all 7 are scattered between both universes, and Champa already has 6 of them.\n\nHe eventually arises on Beerus’ planet where he meets Goku and Vegeta. After another one of their food challenges, the two brothers setup a tournament between universes. The winner will get the Earth of Universe 7 (because of its delicious food), and take home the 6 Super Dragon Balls that have already been collected.\n\nEveryone at this point who has been reading the manga knows what happens from this point forward. Both teams arrive at the tournament grounds, and the fight has already begun in Chapter 8 of the manga.\n\nThis is really where I need to stop because there is one huge unanswered question that still puzzles me…\n\nWhy was Champa gathering the Super Dragon Balls to begin with?\n\nBeerus was unaware of the Super Dragon Balls, but Champa seems to have been collecting them for quite some time. Even time in fact that leads me to believe that he has traveled to Universe 7 on multiple occasions undetected in order to collect them all.\n\nI find it hard to believe that the only reason he wanted to gather them was to get his hands on Universe 7’s Earth for the food. There is no need to use the balls for that because the winner of the tournament gets Earth.\n\nNot to say that he looks evil simply because he is a “Fat Beerus.” Remember that the Good Buu was fat while the Evil Buu was skinny.\n\nHe just seems to be hiding something that he does not want his brother to find out about. He could want to use the orbs to wish for control over all 13 universes, or that he was the most powerful God of Destruction.\n\nBeerus confirmed in Battle of Gods that some of the universes out there bred beings more powerful than himself and Whis. Perhaps Champa does not want to be ranked in the lower tier of Gods of Destruction, and wants to achieve power through wishes rather than training.\n\nHe did say that he was lazy so it would not surprise me if he planned to wish his way to the top rather than actually earning.\n\nAt this point, I can only speculate so much about his true intentions, but I think it is safe to say that he is up to no good. Maybe there is another being from one of the other 11 universes that will arrive at the tournament to take the Super Dragon Balls for themselves.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and I cannot wait to see what Champa really does have up his sleeves.\n\nWhat do you think of this theory? Do you think that Champa is up to no good?\n\nLike what you read? Be sure to follow my blog, and you will be able to read my past blogs about the Dragon Ball series!

Be sure to pass it along to your friends, and I look forward to your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nBy Jeremy Carden\n\nI must say that the Dragon Ball Super manga has blown me away with such amazing storytelling and action! Even though there are multiple inconsistencies with the manga (and anime) when compared to the original Dragon Ball Z series, I still enjoy reading the manga chapters.\n\nWhat I think is the most amazing thing about the Dragon Ball Super franchise is the fact that I get to follow it from start to finish. I did not get into the series until I was about 11-years-old, and by that time the manga was done. The anime (in the United States) was in the Kid Buu Saga, and I was fresh to the scene.\n\nIn this case, I got to see the Dragon Ball Super series begin with episode 1, and read the manga from Chapter 1. Overall, I just feel privileged to be living in a time like this!\n\nNow, I am truly excited to see that Goku and Vegeta have finally begun training together. Considering that they are rivals, I think that their training is much more effective as a result. I can see them learning from each other, and really growing as a result. They are probably trying to one-up each other in their sparring sessions.\n\nAccording to the manga, they trained in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber for 3 years (3 days in our time). Looking past the obvious inconsistency here (only being able to use the room for 48 hours in a lifetime; established by Mr. Popo in DBZ), that is truly impressive!\n\nI have heard that the Time Chamber was rebuilt after the Buu Saga, and it now allows visitors to use it for more than 48 hours total. Remember that it was destroyed during the battle between Super Buu and Gotenks (Piccolo blew up the door), and apparently rebuilt when the world was restored after being destroyed by Kid Buu.\n\nWhis pointed out the flaws in each Saiyan as an individual, and taught them about how to control their new godly ki. Goku’s carefree attitude which made him vulnerable was the opposite of Vegeta’s uptight demeanor that prevents him from fighting at his maximum potential in a battle.\n\nAt some point in the anime, Whis says that there was no longer a need to train the two Saiyans. During their sparring sessions together, the Saiyans’ innate fighting abilities resulted in them progressing much quicker than Whis had originally anticipated.\n\nOverall, Whis’ goal was to get the Saiyans to become more in tune with their new godly ki. This was why he did not allow them to become Super Saiyan or beyond during their training, and only wanted them in base form to master their new powers. Even though Whis pointed out to the Oracle Fish (in the anime) that the Saiyans knew this which was why he never had to outright tell them to train in base form.\n\nBeerus was annoyed by the constant noise that the Saiyans were making, and he told Whis to send him to “that place.” It turned out to be a Hyperbolic Time Chamber-like voice where Goku and Vegeta were surrounded by godly energy.\n\nWhis told them that they must raise their powers without it leaking out of their bodies because it would alert their opponents to the power-up.\n\nVegeta noticed that until they mastered Whis’ tip, they would not be able to move at all in “that place.” He figured this out because Goku which once again shows that he is a better tactician than his Saiyan rival.\n\nIt is unknown exactly how long Goku and Vegeta were in “that place” training in order to master their new godly powers. Goku mentioned that the measurement of time in “that place” was different than the outside world.\n\nEventually, Whis releases the two back into the real world. Like the length of time they were in “that place”, it is unknown how much more powerful the two had become. The only thing that we know came as a result was the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan transformation.\n\nThe one thing that I felt caught my attention during their time in “that place” was Whis’ staff. Goku figured that it was the only way of getting out of the void. Take a look at the picture above of Whis’ staff just floating there.\n\nI always wondered what Goku and Vegeta’s walk towards the light in the opening theme of Dragon Ball Super was all about. After seeing them train, I think that I have figured it out.\n\nFrom that same light, we see Beerus/Champa along with Whis/Vados descend to the front of our television (or computer) screens.\n\nOverall, I think Goku and Vegeta approaching that light was their ascension to the level of gods. Then seeing the 4 gods mentioned above coming out from that light is proof of Goku and Vegeta trying to follow in their footsteps in order to reach a higher power.\n\nThis is further backed up by the fact that the next scene shows Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Goten fighting off Frieza’s soldiers; which symbolized the Resurrection F saga which is happening now.\n\nI guess one difference is that in the anime, Frieza powering up to his final form killed his remaining soliders before Goku and Vegeta could take them on; minus Vegeta killing Tagoma (well Ginyu).\n\nAlright, Whis mentioned that Goku and Vegeta had a chance at beating Beerus if they teamed up. Super Saiyan Blue is more powerful than Super Saiyan God, and this means SS Blue is more powerful than the 70% Beerus that we saw in the first movie.\n\nIndividually, I do not think that SS Blue Goku or Vegeta could defeat Beerus. I think that is proven by the fact that Golden Frieza (before his ki began to fall) was more powerful than SS Blue Goku, but he was still frightened of Beerus.\n\nBeerus would probably need to exhaust around 85% or so to defeat the likes of Golden Frieza, and 80% for a single SS Blue opponent.\n\nAgain, that is just my opinion with a tiny bit of power scaling based on what has been seen from the movies.\n\nMoving on with the Time Chamber training, Goku and Vegeta train in 10 times gravity for 3 years. During that time, it would not surprise me if the duo reached Super Saiyan Blue 2 and Super Saiyan Blue 3!\n\nHowever, Akira stated in an interview that the SS2 and SS3 transformations were a thing of the past with the main focus being on SS1 because it was the form that utilized the least ki consumption and strain on the user’s body.\n\nI do not know if SS Blue will be the last transformation that we will see in the series. Unless we get to see an SS Blue Vegito or Gogeta!\n\nSomething tells me that at some point during the Champa Saga or afterwards; Goku and Vegeta will fuse! I have already written a couple of blogs with my thoughts on that subject.\n\nBack to the subject of this blog, I do not see any reason why Goku and Vegeta have NOT surpassed Beerus after their 3 years of training. We are talking about a God of Destruction who does nothing aside from eating, sleeping and watching anime (Whis mentioned that to Goku and the others.\n\nCompare that purple cat to a couple of warriors who eat, breathe and do nothing but train! I truly believe that their training has resulted in them surpassing the God of Destruction. Unless they get into a battle again with Beerus, I am not sure if they are even aware of their increase in power to the point of rivaling Beerus or surpassing him.\n\nI do not think that they have surpassed Whis, but I think a fusion between the two would give him one heck of a battle. Why? Given the time that the two have trained with each other instead of training separately against each other, I think it is safe to say that they know each other like the back of their hands.\n\nSeeing if the two have truly mastered Whis’ training of their weaknesses is something that I would like to see. After the time spent fighting each other, I think they might have seen what makes the other Saiyan a genius in their own right. Vegeta’s polished and tactical strategies vs. Goku’s out-of-the box techniques that keep even the most dangerous opponents on their toes.\n\nImagine a Gogeta or Vegito that is made up of a Goku and Vegeta that have trained/sparred together for YEARS! I think it is obvious that fusion would be a true blend on even terms of Goku’s relaxed nature and Vegeta’s tense demeanor.\n\nWhis would be in for one heck of a fight if you ask me!\n\n3 years is a long time, and the Saiyans know how to improve their skills in a short period of time. Just thinking about how much they could have advanced in 3 years is just unbelievable. I wonder if there are any of the Universe 6 opponents who are near the level of Goku and Vegeta now.\n\nDo you think that Goku and Vegeta have surpassed Beerus? Did they reach a new transformation or fuse in the Time Chamber? Will there be anyone from Universe 6 that can truly give them a challenge?\n\nLike what you read?
