        "text": "Learn who are the most famous film composers of all time!\n\nWhen you watch a movie, you hear the music that creates the atmosphere and adds an interesting background to the plot, highlighting the most important scenes. This is one topic that many movie-lovers often don’t realize, that each film is enhanced by the music that accompanies the film.\n\nIf you watched some of the popular movies, it is very likely that you have heard music that was composed by one of the most famous film composers! Let’s have a look at who are the most famous film music composers and which movie themes you can easily learn to play on your violin!\n\nFilm composers are important because they create the soundtrack which accompanies a film that is as crucial to the plot as the storyline is. It’s the small detail that has a great impact on what makes movies a special form of visual art.\n\nFilm composers have an exciting job which (in some ways) is quite simple. She or he has to compose film scores that support the film. If it goes very well, they can transcend the film and the story even further.\n\nIt is so important to the plot of a story that it often means the composer must make several drafts of their work before the final product is included with the film. Some composers create a broad sound world that captures the feelings and emotions of a particular scene. For scenes that are similar to each other, a composer might choose to use the same kind of music for that scene, with few changes if any. There are also some composers who are so dedicated to the artistic success of the film that they create various themes for each of the individual characters within a story. As the characters develop throughout the film, so do their musical themes, mirroring the characters changing identity.\n\nWhat is so exciting about film music is how original it can be, and how each song can be special and appeal to the audience in ways that a symphony or a pop song cannot. For example, in “Frozen” the ice queen “Elsa” sings a song called “Let it Go” which took the world by storm (excuse the pun).\n\nThe success of the song was recognized by the American Academy Awards in 2014, winning an Oscar for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song. That means that this animated film, intended for children and their families, beat out every other Hollywood film music that year!"
