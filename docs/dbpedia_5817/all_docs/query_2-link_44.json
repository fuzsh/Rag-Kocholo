        "text": "As Alfred Hitchcock is indelibly linked to the suspense thriller and Merchant-Ivory embody the respectable British costume drama, so Ken Russell's career is defined by music. Always far more stimulated by notes than by words, he made his first composer portrait for the BBC in 1959 and over the next four-and-a-half decades would make fifteen more, ranging from TV documentaries to full-length feature films. In addition, he has made numerous films and programmes about music in general, from the encyclopaedic Ken Russell's ABC of British Music to smaller-scale studies of specific areas, such as colliery bands, mechanical musical instruments and the English folk song. He has said on more than one occasion that if he had the talent, he'd rather have been a composer than a film-maker.\n\nThis is a list of composers whose lives and works inspired complete films and TV programmes by Ken Russell, in chronological order of birth:\n\nFranz Liszt (1811-1886) - Lisztomania, feature film (1975)\n\nAnton Bruckner (1824-1896) - The Strange Affliction of Anton Bruckner: 50-minute South Bank Show (ITV, tx. 14/10/1990)\n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) - The Music Lovers, feature film (1970)\n\nEdward Elgar (1857-1934) - Elgar: 56-minute Monitor special (BBC, tx. 11/11/1962) and Elgar - Fantasy of a Composer on a Bicycle, a 52-minute South Bank Show (ITV, tx. 22/9/2002)\n\nGustav Mahler (1860-1911) - Mahler, feature film (1974)\n\nFrederick Delius (1862-1934) - Song of Summer: 72-minute film for Omnibus (tx. 15/9/1968)\n\nRichard Strauss (1864-1949) - Dance of the Seven Veils: 55-minute film for Omnibus (BBC, tx. 15/2/1970)\n\nClaude Debussy (1865-1918) - The Debussy Film: 85 minute Monitor special (BBC, tx. 18/5/1965)\n\nRalph Vaughan Williams (1873-1958) - 60-minute South Bank Show documentary (ITV, tx. 8/4/1984)\n\nBÃ©la BartÃ³k (1881-1945) - 50-minute Monitor special (BBC, tx. 24/5/1964)\n\nArnold Bax (1883-1953) - The Secret Life of Arnold Bax: 60-minute South Bank Show documentary (ITV, tx. 22/11/1992)\n\nBohuslav Martinu (1890-1959) - The Mystery of Dr Martinu, 60-minute fantasy (BBC, tx. 16/5/1992)\n\nSergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) - Prokofiev: 28-minute documentary for Monitor (BBC, tx. 18/6/1961)\n\nGordon Jacob (1895-1984) - 17-minute documentary for Monitor (BBC, tx. 29/3/1959)\n\nGeorges Delerue (1925-1992) - Don't Shoot The Composer: documentary for Omnibus (BBC, tx. 29/1/1966)\n\nOther music-related works, listed in order of broadcast/release:\n\nGuitar Craze (BBC, tx. 7/6/1959) and The Light Fantastic (BBC, tx. 18/12/1960) - short Monitor documentaries about then-current music and dance crazes.\n\nVariations on a Mechanical Theme (BBC, tx. 27/9/1959) - short Monitor documentary about mechanical musical instruments.\n\nMarie Rambert and Cranks at Work - short Monitor documentaries about choreographers Marie Rambert and John Cranko (both BBC, tx. 17/1/1960)\n\nMiners' Picnic (BBC, tx. 3/7/1960) - short Monitor piece about a colliery band contest.\n\nLotte Lenya Sings Kurt Weill (BBC, tx. 26/3/1961) - live performance, co-directed by Humphrey Burton\n\nThe Boy Friend (1971) - feature film adaptation of Sandy Wilson's musical\n\nTommy (1975) - feature film adaptation of The Who's rock opera\n\nKen Russell's View of 'The Planets' (ITV, tx. 12/6/1983) - a 52-minute South Bank Show\n\nAria (1987) - Russell directed a visualisation of Puccini's 'Nessun Dorma' for Don Boyd's multi-director operatic feature film extravaganza.\n\nKen Russell's ABC of British Music (ITV, tx. 2/4/1988) - 75-minute South Bank Show special\n\nClassic Widows (ITV, tx. 5/2/1995) - a 52-minute South Bank Show about the widows of composers Sir William Walton, Bernard Stevens, Benjamin Frankel and Humphrey Searle\n\nKen Russell In Search of the English Folk Song (Channel 4, tx. 31/8/1998)\n\nDistinguished composers and musicians who have worked with Ken Russell include:\n\nRichard Rodney Bennett - original score for Billion Dollar Brain (1967)\n\nJohn Corigliano - original score for Altered States (US, 1980)\n\nCarl Davis - original score for The Rainbow (1989)\n\nGeorges Delerue - original scores for French Dressing (1963) and Women in Love (1969)\n\nThomas Dolby - original score for Gothic (1986),\n\nPeter Maxwell Davies - original score for The Devils; arrangements for The Boy Friend (both 1971)\n\nAndrÃ© Previn - music director on The Music Lovers (1970)\n\nPete Townshend - original score for Tommy (1975)\n\nRick Wakeman - original scores for Lisztomania (1975) and Crimes of Passion (US, 1984).\n\nMichael Brooke"
