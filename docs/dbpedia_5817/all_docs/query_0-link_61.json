        "text": "The one-man play by Simon Bradbury (who plays Chaplin) and Dan Kamin was seen in earlier productions at Ontario's Shaw Festival (in 2002) and at Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre (in 2005), under the title, Chaplin. It has now been revised and expanded.\n\nSimon Johnston directs this black comedy, \"a multi-media extravaganza based on the collision of art and politics that occurred when Charlie Chaplin created his classic film 'The Great Dictator.'\"\n\nAccording to production notes, \"Intended to illustrate Hitler's lust for world domination to an as-yet-uninvolved American public, Chaplin used comedy to speak out. Filming is going well until Chaplin finds himself facing his two most famous screen creations, Hynkel and the Tramp, both vying for their creator's attention and both convinced that their world view is the correct one.\"\n\nBradbury stated, \"In the play, Chaplin is forced to face the dark and light sides of his comedic art, between artistic purity and moral responsibility.\"\n\nBradbury was a major player for 16 seasons at Canada's Shaw Festival. Co-writer Dan Kamin performs worldwide for theatres, colleges and symphony orchestras. He created the physical comedy sequences for the films \"Chaplin\" and \"Benny and Joon,\" and trained Robert Downey, Jr. and Johnny Depp for their starring performances in those pictures. Costumes and scenery are based on an original design by David Boechler. Music is by Paul Sportelli. Video design by Simon Clemo. Original sound design is by Trevor Hughes and sound assembly is by Ron Way. Lighting design is by Del Surjik.\n\nFor tickets and information visit www.gatewaytheatre.com or call (604) 270-1812.\n\n*\n\nTheatre writers and composers have used movie legend Chaplin as the main character in stage shows for years.\n\nAs recently as fall 2006, the musical Behind the Limelight, by composer-lyricist Christopher Curtis, appeared in the New York Musical Theatre Festival.\n\nIt's one of a number of Chaplin-inspired musicals, including Chaplin the Musical, with book, music and lyrics by Anthony Newley, who played the lead in developmental productions that did not end up making a big splash (this despite the late Newley's famously Chaplinesque persona on and off stage)."
