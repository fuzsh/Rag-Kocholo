        "text": "Paranormal historian, writer and publisher Paul Adams has written a superb post for Spooky Isles on the top ten British composers of horror music. He includes three composers renown in classical music circles as well as a woman—a delight to see in a male-dominated profession. All ten composers hail from the twentieth century. Adams’ article includes sound selections so you can get a taste of each composer’s style. His list got me thinking about a similar list of American composers. So here are the two lists.\n\nTop 10 British Horror Composers\n\nYou can read Adams’ complete article on British horror composers at Spooky Isles.\n\nMalcolm Arnold (1921-2006) — Before Sondheim’s musical, there was Arnold’s ballet score Sweeney Todd, in 1959. He also scored a number of films.\n\nRichard Rodney Bennett (1936-2012) — Prolific composer who scored films during the 60s and 70s, earning an Oscar nomination for Murder on the Orient Express.\n\nJames Bernard (1925-2001) — Composed music for many Hammer horror films during the 50s and 60s, such as The The Curse of Frankenstein and The Hound of the Baskervilles.\n\nHarrison Birtwistle (1934-present) — Wrote the opera Gawain based on the Arthurian legend Sir Gawain and the Green Night.\n\nBenjamin Britten (1913-1976) — One of the greatest English composers, he wrote two operas based on ghost stories: The Turn of the Screw and Owen Wingrave.\n\nPaul Ferris (1941-1995) — scored a number of films during the 60s and 70s.\n\nBenjamin Frankel (1906-1973) — A talented jazz pianist who wrote the first British film score using the twelve-tone serial method created by Arnold Schoenberg.\n\nTristram Cary (1925-2008) — Pioneer of electronic music who scored several Hammer films, incorporating electronic sounds.\n\nElisabeth Lutyens (1906-1983) — scored films for Hammer rival studio Amicus during the 60s, including cult classic The Skull starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.\n\nRalph Vaughn Williams (1872-1958) — Symphonic composer whose ninth symphony alludes to the appearance of a ghost.\n\nTop 5 American Horror Composers\n\nHere is my own perspective on American horror composers.\n\nJohn Carpenter (1948-present) — Best known as a director, he also scored some of his movies such as Halloween and The Fog. Carpenter was an early adopter of synthesizers.\n\nCharlie Clouser (1963-present) — Former Nine Inch Nails keyboardist, his industrial melanges have lent an unsettling mood to the Saw franchise and American Horror Story.\n\nDanny Elfman (1953-present) — If you enjoy your horror music with a playful, light touch, Elfman is your man, collaborating on a number of Tim Burton flics like The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nBernard Hermann (1911-1975) — Composer of many horror, dramatic, and sci-fi films, but best known for the iconic Psycho score.\n\nStephen Sondheim (1930-present) — Although only two of his musicals fall within the horror/fantasy orbit, both are sufficiently masterful to qualify him for this list: Sweeney Todd and Into the Woods."
