        "text": "1934: One Night of Love\n\n- Composers: Louis Silvers, Victor Schertzinger, Gus Kahn\n\n- Director: Victor Schertzinger\n\n- IMDb user rating: 5.7\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 84 min\n\nThe first Oscar for best scoring went to this opera-themed drama, which was a box office hit in its day. Released during the early days of the sound era, it made innovative use of vertical cut recording. Director Victor Schertzinger composed the title song with lyrics by Gus Kahn.\n\n1935: The Informer\n\n- Composer: Max Steiner\n\n- Director: John Ford\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.5\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 91 min\n\nAustrian-born composer Max Steiner was a child prodigy who composed his first operetta by the age of 14, eventually making his way to Hollywood. His first Academy Award came for this 1935 drama from director John Ford, about a young Irish rebel who betrays his former comrade. Steiner composed over 300 scores throughout his career, earning 24 Oscar nominations and taking home the trophy three times.\n\n1936: Anthony Adverse\n\n- Composer: Erich Wolfgang Korngold\n\n- Directors: Mervyn LeRoy, Michael Curtiz\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 141 min\n\nLike composer Max Steiner, Erich Wolfgang Korngold was also born in Austria and also a child prodigy. Drawing crowds as early as the age of 11, he later moved to Hollywood as the Nazis rose to power in Germany. When scoring this award-winning historical romance, Korngold cultivated an \"operatic\" template without arias.\n\n1937: One Hundred Men and a Girl\n\n- Composer: Charles Previn\n\n- Director: Henry Koster\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 84 min\n\nStarring conductor Leopold Stokowski himself, this 1937 dramedy uses a score of pre-existing classical music and doesn't credit an actual composer. Its Academy Award for best scoring went to Universal Studios Music Department head Charles Previn and sparked controversy. As a direct result, the academy created two separate awards for best music score of a dramatic picture and best scoring of a musical picture.\n\n1938: The Adventures of Robin Hood\n\n- Composer: Erich Wolfgang Korngold\n\n- Directors: Michael Curtiz, William Keighley\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.9\n\n- Metascore: 97\n\n- Runtime: 102 min\n\nErich Korngold only composed the music for 16 Hollywood films making his two Academy Awards even more impressive. His romantic and sweeping score for this 1938 adventure helped turn it into a critical and commercial smash. Korngold's uniquely symphonic style on this film and others is considered a clear predecessor to the work of future composers such as John Williams.\n\nYou may also like: The best movies of 2024 so far\n\n1939: The Wizard of Oz\n\n- Composer: Herbert Stothart\n\n- Directors: Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Mervyn LeRoy, Norman Taurog, Richard Thorpe, King Vidor\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.0\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- Runtime: 102 min\n\nThis iconic fantasy film simply wouldn't be the same without its signature songs and musical score.

It earned the accomplished composer his second Academy Award.\n\n1943: The Song of Bernadette\n\n- Composer: Alfred Newman\n\n- Director: Henry King\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.6\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 156 min\n\nAlong with Max Steiner and Dimitri Tiomkin, Alfred Newman is widely considered one of the \"godfathers of film music.\" His nine Academy Awards and whopping 45 nominations put him in the upper echelons of Oscar history.

As the story alternates between romance and paranoia, the classical score follows suit. Ironically, Rózsa later wrote in his autobiography that the two men met only twice during the entire production.\n\n1946: The Best Years of Our Lives\n\n- Composer: Hugo Friedhofer\n\n- Director: William Wyler\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8\n\n- Metascore: 92\n\n- Runtime: 170 min\n\nIn 1947, the academy narrowed down the playing field for best music score of a dramatic or comedy picture to just five nominees.

It was one of the film's seven Oscars, including best picture.\n\n1947: A Double Life\n\n- Composer: Miklos Rozsa\n\n- Director: George Cukor\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 104 min\n\nHaving previously tackled themes of identity and psychology at the behest of Hitchcock, Miklós Rózsa covered similar terrain for this acclaimed film noir.
