        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nOriginal Score\n\nIt’s tricky to even call this category Original Score since the only group that actually holds true to that is the Oscars and even they have had a lot of different categories over the years. Nonetheless, I have tried to hold true to that, even though at times I disagree with the Academy’s distinction of how much pre-existing music can dilute that score.\n\nThere were scores before there was recorded sound in film, music that was designed to be played in the theater with the film but the whole concept changed when recorded sound was introduced and suddenly a score could be written for the film that could play at exactly the same point and speed in every print of the film.\n\nLike with songs, the first awards for such film music came in 1934 when the two categories were added at the Academy Awards. By then, Charlie Chaplin had recorded his brilliant score for City Lights and Max Steiner was already well at work (most notably having done King Kong).\n\nWhile many other groups would follow the Academy’s lead and establish awards for music in film, they were often defined rather differently, which seems appropriate, given the Oscars own history.\n\nOne thing that is hard to distinguish is how much the “main title score” is as compared to the rest of the score. I usually grade something on the best bit of music. So, for example, my 9 point list below includes Chariots of Fire which has an absolutely brilliant main score with a solid rest of the soundtrack. On the other hand, it also includes Star Trek II which has an excellent main score but has other parts (notably “Genesis Countdown”) which easily get into the 9 point range. I think the entire soundtrack as a whole is a major factor in my Top 5.\n\nMy Top 5 Original Scores in Film History:\n\nJohn Williams, Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1981\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, 1977\n\nTrevor Jones / Randy Edelman, The Last of the Mohicans, 1992\n\nHoward Shore, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001\n\nJames Horner, Glory, 1989\n\nThe other 9 Point Scores (chronological):\n\nHerbert Stothart, The Wizard of Oz, 1939\n\nMax Steiner, Gone with the Wind, 1939\n\nFumio Hayasaka, Rashomon, 1950/1952\n\nMalcolm Arnold, The Bridge on the River Kwai, 1957\n\nErnest Gold, Exodus, 1960\n\nMaurice Jarre, Lawrence of Arabia, 1962\n\nElmer Bernstein, The Great Escape, 1963\n\nHenry Mancini, The Pink Panther, 1963 / 1964\n\nMaurice Jarre, Doctor Zhivago, 1965\n\nEnnio Morricone, A Fistful of Dollars, 1964/1967\n\nEnnio Morricone, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, 1966/1968\n\nEnnio Morricone, Once Upon a Time in the West, 1968/1969\n\nNino Rota, The Godfather, 1972\n\nJohn Williams, Jaws, 1975\n\nJohn Williams, Superman, 1978\n\nJerry Goldsmith, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, 1979\n\nJohn Williams, 1941, 1979\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, 1980\n\nVangelis, Chariots of Fire, 1981\n\nJames Horner, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, 1982\n\nMichael Gore, Terms of Endearment, 1983\n\nBill Conti, The Right Stuff, 1983\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, 1983\n\nRandy Newman, The Natural, 1984\n\nAlan Silvestri, Back to the Future, 1985\n\nBruce Boughton, Silverado, 1985\n\nMark Knopfler, The Princess Bride, 1987\n\nEnnio Morricone, The Untouchables, 1987\n\nJohn Williams, Born on the Fourth of July, 1989\n\nJohn Williams, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, 1989\n\nMaurice Jarre, Dead Poets Society, 1989\n\nJohn Williams, JFK, 1991\n\nAlan Menken, Beauty and the Beast, 1991\n\nHans Zimmer, The Power of One, 1992\n\nJohn Williams, Schindler’s List, 1993\n\nPatrick Doyle, Much Ado About Nothing, 1993\n\nJohn Williams, Amistad, 1997\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, 1999\n\nTan Dun, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, 2000\n\nClint Mansell, Requiem for a Dream, 2000\n\nJohn Williams, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, 2001\n\nYann Tiersen, The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain, 2001\n\nHoward Shore, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, 2002\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, 2002\n\nHoward Shore, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, 2003\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, 2005\n\nGustavo Santaolalla, Brokeback Mountain, 2005\n\nHans Zimmer, The Da Vinci Code, 2006\n\nDario Marianelli, Atonement, 2007\n\nNicholas Hopper, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, 2007\n\nnote: I rate all aspects of film on a 9 point scale. They also correspond to the 100 point scale for Best Picture. Films above *** (76-99) all land on the scale. 1 point is for 76-79, just worth mentioning. 2 points is for 80-83, a weak mention, 3 points is for 84-87, near great, 4 points is for 88-89 (which is ****), a solid nominee, 5 points is for 90-91, a very solid nominee, 6 points is for 92-93, a weak winner, a 7 points is for 94-95, a worthwhile winner, 8 points is 96-97, the kind of winner you can’t complain about even if it’s not your #1 choice and 9 points is for 98-99, the very best of all-time. The above list are my 9 point films for Sound through 2011, listed chronologically.\n\nThe Composers\n\nMax Steiner\n\nThe original great film composer, Steiner was nominated for the Oscar the first 17 years the category existed, still the second-longest streak in any category in Oscar history. He was first in Oscar points from 1935 to 1938 and then, except for a couple of years in the early 40s, second behind Alfred Newman all the way until John Williams finally passed him in 1993. He composed over 300 film scores, won three Oscars and earned 24 nominations and while most of his work predated the Globes, he did win the first award in 1947.\n\nKey Films: Gone with the Wind, King Kong, The Informer, Casablanca\n\nAlfred Newman\n\nWhile he didn’t earn his first Oscar nomination until the fourth year of the category, he immediately started to dominate the award and two years later he was #1 in points and has never dropped that distinction. Nominated for 43 Oscars and winner of nine. Nominated 12 years in a row, then skipped 1949, then nominated 7 more years in a row. In those 20 years he earned 37 nominations. He was the king of a family that included brother Lionel (9 nominations, mostly for Musical Score, Song Score or Adapted Score winning one), son Thomas (nine nominations through 2011) and nephew Randy (8 nominations though he has two Oscars for Song).\n\nKey Films: Gunga Din, The Song of Bernadette, Wuthering Heights\n\nMaurice Jarre\n\nDavid Lean’s favorite composer (he would win three Oscars working with Lean) was a force to be reckoned with for some 40 years. In 1989 he joined John Williams becoming just the second composer to win multiple Oscars, BAFTAs and Globes.\n\nKey Films: Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, A Passage to India, Dead Poets Society\n\nEnnio Morricone\n\nHe became famous for his spaghetti western themes for Sergio Leone which are his best work but eventually he started to find recognition from the awards groups as well for such work as Once Upon a Time in America, The Mission and The Untouchables.\n\nKey Films: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Mission, The Untouchables\n\nJerry Goldsmith\n\nThe rare composer who finished in the Top 10 in Oscars points in four different decades (60’s through 90’s). He has only won one Oscar (The Omen) and he never won the BAFTA (in four noms) or the Globe (seven noms) but he wins two Nighthawks (Chinatown, Star Trek) and earns seven Nighthawk noms and 14 Oscar noms.\n\nKey Films: Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential\n\nJohn Williams\n\nWhat do I need to write here? He is the second most nominated individual in Oscar history behind only Walt Disney. He is by far the most nominated individual at the Nighthawk Awards. I own 13 of his soundtracks plus three store-bought compilations plus three more homemade compilations. He dominates the 9 point list above. He’s won 24 Grammys and his score for Star Wars was declared by AFI to be the greatest film score of all-time. I have no figures to back this up but I am willing to bet that his soundtracks have far far outsold anyone else’s in the history of film composing (Star Wars went Platinum which is extremely rare for an instrumental soundtrack and six others have gone Gold).\n\nKey Films: Star Wars (eight films), Indiana Jones (four films), Harry Potter (three films), Jaws, Superman, Schindler’s List\n\nThe Academy Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThough composing came in with film sound (actually it took a couple of years for it to really get going), a category for Score wouldn’t start until 1934 (meaning Charlie Chaplin for City Lights and Max Steiner for King Kong were both passed over though both films were lacking any nominations anyway). Max Steiner was nominated that first year (but didn’t win) and was then nominated the next 16 years as well.\n\nI cover a lot of the history here in the Best Score post which is filled with the history of the divisions in the category (it was split into two awards in a lot of different years with different reasons depending on the era) and the history of the major composers and their records at the Oscars.\n\nLike many of the Tech categories, Score earned a lot of weak scores for a long time, mainly because every studio earned a nomination for a stretch in the 40s as long as they submitted a score. The scores took a big leap up in the 60s and then again in the 80s and have generally been fairly strong since then.\n\nDirectors:\n\nMichael Curtiz (12 noms, 3 wins) and Walter Lang (11 noms, 5 wins, all from Musicals) were the big directors from the Studio Era but it’s all about Steven Spielberg. Teamed almost entirely with John Williams, his films have a combined 16 noms and 3 Oscars and he shows no signs of stopping with only one gap of more than four years since 1975.\n\nFranchises:\n\nIt’s a tricky category because if a franchise has the same main theme, how much does that influence you (either for the score or against it, if you think it’s all about the original music). But, two years after the first Godfather’s score lost its nomination due to pre-existing music, the Academy gave the Oscar to The Godfather Part III. Since then, while many sequels have earned nominations (the first two Star Wars sequels, the first two Indiana Jones sequels, all with music by John Williams, the third Harry Potter film, also John Williams) only Return of the King has managed an Oscar.\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama leads in nominations (36.88%) and wins (32.56%) but not by a ton over Musicals (24.23%, 32.56%). Comedy, even given its own category in several years, often didn’t win it (either to Musicals or Kids films) and is in third in both (11.17%, 10.08%). Every category but Mystery (even Documentary because Let it Be won Song Score) has at least one win though Action, Crime, Suspense and War only have one each. Every category (including Documentary) has at least 7 nominations. At one point, Horror had a 31 year gap between nominations (1943 to 1974). Kids, before its five wins from 1989 to 1995 had only won once since 1941. No Musical has won the category since 1986 and only three films have been nominated in the regular Score category since the 60s.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nThere have been 22 films that have won both Picture and Score while another three won Picture and Adapted or Song Score. It did take until 1946 for the first film to do it and it only happened twice in the first 22 years of the category’s existence as well as only once in the 70’s. There have been 48 Best Picture winners to at least earn a Score nomination while 205 films have been nominated in both categories.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nThe first Foreign Film to earn an Oscar nomination would be in 1961 (Khovanshchina) with six more earning nominations through 1971 (four of them in Adapted or Song Score) but none of them would win the award (though Umbrellas of Cherbourg would earn nominations in both Score categories). Then there was a long drought until 1995. Starting in 1995, four films in six years actually won the award (Il Postino, Life is Beautiful, Red Violin, Crouching Tiger) while since then four more films have earned nominations but none have won the award.\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nAs mentioned in my Score piece from several years ago, lots of films earn just this one nomination (196 in total). It was very common in the era where every studio was guaranteed a nominee (83 in nine years from 1937 to 1945) and was quite common among Adapted / Song Score nominees (25 films in less than 20 years including three winners) and in the short stretch of Drama / Comedy splits from 1995 to 1998 (11 films). Since 1980, excluding 1995 to 1998, there have only been eleven films over almost 30 years (including two winners). Winners with just the single nomination aren’t common (10, including the three in Adapted / Song) with only four in the regular Score category since 1949. The majority of winners, especially since 1980 earn a Picture nom and win at least one other Oscar.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nArt Direction has the most overlap (234 films), followed by Cinematography (233 films), Picture (206), Sound (196) and Editing (174). Animated Film and Foreign Film are the only categories with less than 10 films overlapping. Art Direction (30), Editing (27) and Cinematography (26) have the most overlap of winners while Picture and Director are both at 25 though only only 21 of them are the same. Every category has at least two overlapping winners except Animated Film which just has one (Up).\n\nThe Academy Awards Top 10:\n\nAlfred Newman – 1200\n\nJohn Williams – 1100\n\nMax Steiner – 700\n\nMorris Stoloff – 525\n\nVictor Young – 500\n\nMiklos Rosza – 475\n\nJerry Goldsmith – 450\n\nDimitri Tiomkin – 435\n\nRay Heindorf – 430\n\nFranz Waxman / Alex North – 350\n\nnote: Wins are worth 50 points and nominations are worth 25. For the category “Adapted Score” or “Song Score”, wins are worth 20 points and nominations are worth 10.\n\nTop 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nStar Wars Episode IV, A New Hope\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nLove is a Many-Splendored Thing\n\nOne Night of Love\n\n100 Men and a Girl\n\nThis is the Army\n\nSeven Brides for Seven Brothers\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Nominees:\n\nShanks\n\nDoctor Dolittle\n\nPatch Adams\n\nLove is a Many-Splendored Thing\n\nThe Champ\n\nTop 5 Scores Snubbed by the Oscars:\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans\n\nGlory\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nThe Power of One\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nTop 5 Oscar Years:\n\n2005 (Brokeback Mountain, Memoirs of a Geisha, Munich, Pride and Prejudice, Constant Gardener)\n\n1984 (A Passage to India, The Natural, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Under the Volcano, The River)\n\n1989 (The Little Mermaid, Born on the Fourth of July, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Field of Dreams, The Fabulous Baker Boys)\n\n2001 (Fellowship of the Ring, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, AI, Monsters Inc, A Beautiful Mind)\n\n1960 (Exodus, Spartacus, The Magnificent Seven, Elmer Gantry, The Alamo)\n\nTop 5 Oscars Years by Oscar Score:\n\n2001 – 97.1 (Fellowship of the Ring, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, AI, Monsters Inc, A Beautiful Mind)\n\n1984 – 95.0 (A Passage to India, The Natural, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Under the Volcano, The River)\n\n2008 – 93.9 (Slumdog Millionaire, Wall-E, Milk, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Defiance)\n\n2005 – 92.9 (Brokeback Mountain, Memoirs of a Geisha, Munich, Pride and Prejudice, Constant Gardener)\n\n1997 – 87.5 (Titanic, Amistad, L.A. Confidential, Kundun, Good Will Hunting)\n\nnote: The difference between this list and the previous one is that the first one is a flat total based on my 9 point scale. In this one, it’s comparing my top three films to the ones the Oscars actually nominated. So, in the first one, it’s how good are the nominees. In this one it’s how good are the nominees compared to what else was eligible.\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Years:\n\nnote: These are the same as the worst 5 years by Oscar Score so I just included the score.\n\n1947 – 18.8 (A Double Life, Life With Father, The Bishop’s Wife, Forever Amber, Captain from Castile)\n\n1934 – 25.0 (One Night of Love, The Lost Patrol, The Gay Divorcee)\n\n1936 – 26.3 (Anthony Adverse, Charge of the Light Brigade, General Died at Dawn, Garden of Allah, Winterset)\n\n1958 – 28.1 (Old Man and the Sea, Big Country, Separate Tables, Young Lions, White Wilderness)\n\n1944 – 30.6 (Since You Went Away, Double Indemnity, Wilson, Kismet, None but the Lonely Heart, Address Unknown, Adventures of Mark Twain, Casanova Brown, It Happened Tomorrow, Princess and the Pirate, Voice in the Wind, Bridge of San Luis Rey, Christmas Holiday, Fighting Seabees, Hairy Ape, Jack London, Summer Storm, Three Russian Girls, Up in Mable’s Room, Woman of the Town)\n\nTop 5 Films to win the Oscar (based on quality of film not score):\n\nSunset Blvd.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nWorst 5 Films to win the Oscar (based on quality of film not score):\n\nA Little Night Music\n\nLove Story\n\nLove is a Many-Splendored Thing\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nCamelot\n\nnote: Interesting that three of the worst films won Adapted or Song Score.\n\nWorst 5 Films to earn an Oscar nomination (based on quality of film not score):\n\nPatch Adams\n\nThe Amityville Horror\n\nThe Silver Chalice\n\nA Little Night Music\n\nDoctor Dolittle\n\nYears in Which the Worst of the Nominees Won the Oscar:\n\n1980: Fame over Empire Strikes Back, Elephant Man, Tess, Altered States\n\nOscar Nominees I Haven’t Seen\n\nnote: This is one of the categories where I haven’t managed to see every nominee. There are nine nominees that I still haven’t managed to see (all of them earned no other nominations).\n\nTropic Holiday, 1938\n\nMercy Island, 1941\n\nKlondike Fury, 1942\n\nSomething to Shout About, 1943\n\nThree Russian Girls, 1944\n\nG.I. Honeymoon, 1945\n\nHitchhike to Happiness, 1945\n\nSunbonnet Sue, 1945\n\nWhy Girls Leave Home, 1945\n\nOscar Scores By Decade:\n\n1930’s: 47.4\n\n1940’s: 53.5\n\n1950’s: 49.7\n\n1960’s: 60.6\n\n1970’s: 59.3\n\n1980’s: 81.2\n\n1990’s: 74.2\n\n2000’s: 80.9\n\n2010’s: 91.6\n\nAll-Time: 66.9\n\nThe BAFTA Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music at the BAFTAs is a very different award than the Best Original Score award at the Oscars. It’s actually about all of the film music because except for the short period from 1982 to 1984 there has not been a Song category at the BAFTAs. That is why we get winners like O Lucky Man, Strictly Ballroom or Backbeat. It began as a category in 1968 when the BAFTAs redid their categories and took its current name in 1994 (a name I find a bit odd since I don’t think of Asquith’s films as having notable music).\n\nFranchises:\n\nLike the Oscars, the BAFTAs began to notice sequels with The Godfather Part II and then Empire Strikes Back, though here the former was just nominated and the latter won the award. Since then, however, with a couple of nominated exceptions (Return of the King, Dark Knight), they have mostly ignored franchises.\n\nGenres:\n\nEvery genre has earned at least three nominations except Documentary which just has one. Drama (36.84%) and Musicals (14.74%) dominate with the latter, in an era where they were rarely earning Oscar noms showing the difference between this category and the Oscar category. Adventure, Fantasy and Documentary have never won the award while Drama has won 21 times (almost half) and Musicals another 5 times.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nEight films have won both Picture and Film Music with The King’s Speech also winning British Film. Until 1989, only one film had won both awards (Butch Cassidy). Another 19 films have won Picture and earned Music noms. From 1968 to 1992 only nine Picture winners earned at least a Score nom but since 1993 the only Picture winner not to earn a Score nom is Hurt Locker. Another 18 films won Music and earned Picture noms while 39 more earned noms for both.\n\nSingle Nominees:\n\nOnly 17 films have earned nominations for Film Music with no other noms and none since 1990. Of those 17, Summer of ’42, Days of Heaven and Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence all won the award.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nFifteen Foreign language films have been nominated for Film Music, starting in 1968 (Closely Watched Trains) and most recently in 2007 (La Vie en Rose, Kite Runner). Of those, seven actually won the award.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nExcluding the short lived Song category, Score has overlapped with every category with multiple winners of both categories except Visual Effects. With Visual Effects not arriving until 1982, after the first two Star Wars films (which both won), no film has ever won both awards. The biggest overlap is Screenplay (102) though Editing, Cinematography and Sound are all over 90.\n\nThe BAFTA Top 10:\n\nJohn Williams – 475\n\nEnnio Morricone – 250\n\nRichard Rodney Bennett – 200\n\nGeorge Fenton – 150\n\nHanz Zimmer – 150\n\nAlexandre Desplat – 150\n\nHoward Shore – 150\n\nMaurice Jarre – 125\n\nDavid Hirschfelder – 125\n\nGabriel Yared / Craig Armstrong / Gustavo Santaolalla / T Bone Burnett – 125\n\nTop 5 BAFTA Winners:\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nJaws\n\nThe Godfather\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nnote: Because the BAFTA category is so different, I will not do any of the “worst” awards or even rate the nominees although I will say that The French Lieutenant’s Woman winning over Raiders and Chariots of Fire is kind of weird.\n\nThe Golden Globes\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Globes would start awarding Best Score in 1947, not long after they began and long before they started giving out Best Song. Prior to 1964, with the exception of a few years in the early 50’s, they did not have nominees (in the early 50’s they had three nominees). Several times, the Globes have had more than five nominees, most notably 1999 through 2001 where there were a total of 23 nominees in three years.\n\nThe Globes have shown some independence in this category. Only half the time has their winner agreed with the Oscars and their winners have included scores rejected by the Oscars as ineligible (The Godfather, The Aviator), scores that weren’t original for the film (The Truman Show), scores diluted by songs (Moulin Rouge) or scores that the Oscars considered either adapted or a song score (Little Prince, A Star is Born) and those are just among the winners. Lately, they have been agreeing more with the Oscars, with the last five winners of each group being the same.\n\nThe Globes Top 10:\n\nJohn Williams – 675\n\nMaurice Jarre – 350\n\nHans Zimmer – 275\n\nDimitri Tiomkin – 225\n\nJerry Goldsmith – 225\n\nEnnio Morricone – 225\n\nMichael Legrand – 200\n\nGiorgio Moroder – 200\n\nAlan Menken – 200\n\nHenry Mancini / John Barry / Elmer Bernstein / James Horner / Howard Shore – 175\n\nTop 5 Globe Winners:\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nJaws\n\nThe Godfather\n\nAtonement\n\nWorst 5 Globe Winners:\n\nThe Stunt Man\n\nSeptember Affair\n\nInspector General\n\nLife with Father\n\nThe Little Prince\n\nThe Broadcast Film Critics Awards (Critics Choice)\n\nSummary:\n\nLike most of the Tech awards at the BFCA, this award only finally came into existence in 2009. They immediately screwed with the consensus since they gave the award to Avatar in 2009 (when the other three groups awarded Hurt Locker) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in 2011 (when the other three awarded Hugo). In 2010, they did award Inception, but the CAS had awarded True Grit. They also, in each year, nominated a film that none of the other three groups nominated (Nine, Toy Story 3, Tree of Life).\n\nThe BFCA Top 4:\n\nHoward Shore – 225\n\nJohn Williams – 200\n\nHans Zimmer – 175\n\nseven composers – 75\n\nThe Nighthawk Awards\n\nnote: Because my awards go, retroactively, all the way back through 1912, there are a lot more nominees and winners than in the other awards. But I don’t always have a full slate of nominees and some years I don’t have any nominees.\n\nDirectors:\n\nCharlie Chaplin deserves special note, not only for winning five Nighthawks (though, to be fair, against little competition) and earning three other nominations but because he was both director and composer. Hitchcock (mostly with Herrmann) has three Oscars and seven other noms. Kurosawa, with a few different composers, has two wins and 12 noms. But of course, it’s Spielberg (with John Williams except for one nomination) whose films reign supreme with 5 wins and 11 other nominations.\n\nFranchises:\n\nStar Wars is the biggest winner (4 wins, 6 total noms) over Harry Potter (6 noms for 3 different composers), Lord of the Rings (3 wins), Star Trek (2 wins, 2 other noms) and Indiana Jones (1 win, 2 other noms).\n\nGenres:\n\nEvery genre has won at least three awards except Musical (which has just one – A Nous La Liberte, though bearing in mind that Wizard of Oz and Disney films aren’t considered Musicals). Drama leads with 39.90% of the nominees and 33.33% of the winners with Comedy in distant second place in both. It’s notable that all six of the Sci-Fi winners and 10 of the 18 nominees are Star Wars or Star Trek films. Musicals, which don’t have their own category like the Oscars, only earn 3 nominations, the only genre with less than 14 noms (3.45%).\n\nBest Picture:\n\nThere are 34 films that win both Picture and Score including a nine year streak from 1946 to 1954. The next longest streak of winners (2000-03) is followed by a tie for the longest streak of Score winners that don’t even earn Picture noms (2004-06). There are another 21 films that win Picture but earn Score noms, 27 that win Score with a Picture nom and 106 that are nominated for both.\n\nForeign Film:\n\nThere are 10 films that win Score that are also Foreign films (six of which win Foreign Film and all six of those also win Picture). There are another 60 Score nominees that are Foreign films with several films each from Kurosawa, Fellini, Ray and Miyazaki.\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nOf the 406 films nominated for Score, only 39 of them earn no other nominations with only two of those (Exodus, The Natural) winning the award. Dead Poets Society has the distinction of being the only **** film to earn Score but no other nominations.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nArt Direction (214) and Cinematography (205) have the most overlap with Score nominees though Cinematography (32) has more winners (AD has 30) and both Picture and Director have 34 overlapping winners. The only category with fewer than five overlapping winners is Animated Film (just three – Snow White, Up and Tintin).\n\nMy Top 10\n\nJohn Williams – 1025\n\nMax Steiner – 450\n\nBernard Herrmann – 350\n\nMaurice Jarre – 350\n\nCharlie Chaplin – 325\n\nEnnio Morricone – 325\n\nHans Zimmer – 275\n\nFranz Waxman – 225\n\nJerry Goldsmith – 225\n\nHoward Shore – 225\n\nMy Top 10 weighted\n\nJohn Williams – 1582\n\nMax Steiner – 757\n\nMaurice Jarre – 582\n\nAlfred Newman – 540\n\nJerry Goldsmith – 514\n\nHans Zimmer – 481\n\nBernard Herrmann – 459\n\nFranz Waxman – 445\n\nEnnio Morricone – 428\n\nDanny Elfman – 427\n\nnote: This based on a scale from 20-1 based on Top 20 placement at the Nighthawks. A win is worth 40 points in Sound, a 20th place finish is worth 1 point (if the list goes a full 20).\n\nMy Top 20 Absolute Points List:\n\nJohn Williams – 2220\n\nDanny Elfman – 791\n\nMaurice Jarre – 788\n\nJerry Goldsmith – 753\n\nMax Steiner – 734\n\nHans Zimmer – 723\n\nEnnio Morricone – 626\n\nAlfred Newman – 624\n\nJames Horner – 594\n\nHoward Shore – 547\n\nBernard Herrmann – 542\n\nDimitri Tiomkin – 541\n\nJames Newton Howard – 535\n\nElmer Bernstein – 524\n\nFranz Waxman – 505\n\nAlex North – 497\n\nMiklos Rosza – 490\n\nThomas Newman – 461\n\nNino Rota – 430\n\nJohn Barry – 430\n\nnote: This is a point scale based on their points, not where they finished in the year. That means, for instance, that John Williams gets the maximum number of points for 1989 when he finishes 2nd at the Nighthawks because his score for Born on the Fourth of July is a 9 point Score. In some ways, though I would want to be able to figure out an average score and combine the two to account for quality as opposed to just quantity, this could be considered my list of the Top 20 film composers of all-time.\n\nThe Top 5 Absolute Points by Decade\n\n1912-1929\n\nCharlie Chaplin – 105\n\n1930-1939\n\nMax Steiner – 317\n\nAlfred Newman – 216\n\nErich Wolfgang Korngold – 150\n\nHerbert Stothart – 100\n\nCharlie Chaplin – 94\n\n1940 – 1949\n\nMax Steiner – 305\n\nMiklos Rosza – 214\n\nFranz Waxman – 181\n\nBernard Herrmann – 168\n\nAlfred Newman – 160\n\n1950 – 1959\n\nFranz Waxman – 255\n\nDimitri Tiomkin – 212\n\nMiklos Rosza – 182\n\nAlfred Newman – 181\n\nBernard Herrmann – 156\n\n1960 – 1969\n\nMasaru Sato – 336\n\nElmer Bernstein – 275\n\nMaurice Jarre – 264\n\nEnnio Morricone – 208\n\nAlex North – 198\n\n1970 – 1979\n\nJohn Williams – 471\n\nJerry Goldsmith – 362\n\nNino Rota – 194\n\nPopol Vuh – 118\n\nMaurice Jarre – 112\n\n1980 – 1989\n\nJohn Williams – 522\n\nMaurice Jarre – 325\n\nJames Horner – 276\n\nEnnio Morricone – 170\n\nJerry Goldsmith – 162\n\n1990 – 1999\n\nJohn Williams – 558\n\nDanny Elfman – 417\n\nHans Zimmer – 282\n\nPatrick Doyle – 245\n\nCarter Burwell – 200\n\n2000 – 2011\n\nJohn Williams – 625\n\nHoward Shore – 434\n\nAlexandre Desplat – 388\n\nJames Newton Howard – 379\n\nHans Zimmer – 373\n\nTop 5 Films to win the Nighthawk (based on quality of film not score):\n\nSunset Blvd.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nWorst 5 Films to win the Nighthawk (based on quality of film not score):\n\nThe Natural\n\nExodus\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture\n\nThe Da Vinci Code\n\nThe Mission\n\nWorst 5 Films to earn a Nighthawk nomination (based on quality of film not sound):\n\nLove Story\n\nEarthquake\n\nRequiem for a Dream\n\n1941\n\nUnder Capricorn\n\nTop 5 6th Place Finishers at the Nighthawks:\n\nJohn Williams, Munich, 2005\n\nAlexandre Desplat, The Queen, 2006\n\nPatrick Doyle, Henry V, 1989\n\nJoe Hisaishi, My Neighbor Totoro, 1994\n\nSergei Prokofiev, Ivan the Terrible Part II, 1960\n\nBest Score by Place Finish at the Nighthawks:\n\n1st – John Williams, Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1981\n\n2nd – Bill Conti, The Right Stuff, 1983\n\n3rd – Yann Tiersen, The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain, 2001\n\n4th – John Williams, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, 1989\n\n5th – Alan Menken, The Little Mermaid, 1989\n\n6th – John Williams, Munich, 2005\n\n7th – Howard Shore, A History of Violence, 2005\n\n8th – Fumio Hayasaka, Ikiru, 1960\n\n9th – Dario Marianelli, Pride and Prejudice, 2005\n\n10th – Danny Elfman, Corpse Bride, 2005\n\n11th – Rupert Gregson-Williams, Hotel Rwanda, 2004\n\n12th – David Newman, Serenity, 2005\n\n13th – Stephen Warbeck, Proof, 2005\n\n14th – Harry Gregson-Williams, Kingdom of Heaven, 2005\n\n15th – John Williams, War of the Worlds, 2005\n\n16th – Rachel Portman, Oliver Twist, 2005\n\n17th – Alexandre Desplat, Syriana, 2005\n\n18th – Rolfe Kent, About Schmidt, 2002\n\n19th – Harry Gregson-Williams, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, 2005\n\n20th – James Newton Howard, Collateral, 2004\n\nBest Scores by Genre\n\nAction: John Williams, Superman\n\nAdventure: Randy Edelman / Trevor Jones, The Last of the Mohicans\n\nComedy: Henry Mancini, The Pink Panther\n\nCrime: Nino Rota, The Godfather\n\nDrama: Maurice Jarre, Lawrence of Arabia\n\nFantasy: John Williams, Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nHorror: John Williams, Jaws\n\nKids: Herbert Stothart, The Wizard of Oz\n\nMusical: Herbie Hancock, Round Midnight\n\nMystery: Hans Zimmer, The Da Vinci Code\n\nSci-Fi: John Williams, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nSuspense: Ennio Morricone, The Untouchables\n\nWar: James Horner, Glory\n\nWestern: Ennio Morricone, The Good the Bad and the Ugly\n\nBest Scores by Star Rating of Film\n\nnote: Of the three biggest Tech awards (Editing, Cinematography, Score), this is the category that can most easily come from a weak film. True, a great score works better in conjunction with a great film but a great score can still be a great score even to a bad film. So, by rating of the film (not including the ratings that have no score on my list), here are the best scores.\n\n****: John Williams, Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\n***.5: John Williams, Superman\n\n***: Hans Zimmer, The Power of One\n\n**.5: Ernest Gold, Exodus\n\n**: John Williams, 1941\n\n*.5: James Newton Howard, The Village\n\nThe Nighthawk Winners:\n\n1925-26: Charlie Chaplin, The Gold Rush\n\n1927-28: Charlie Chaplin, The Circus\n\n1928-29: none\n\n1929-30: Josiah Zuro, The Trespasser\n\n1930-31: Charlie Chaplin, City Lights\n\n1931-32: Georges Auric, A Nous la Liberte\n\n1932-33: Max Steiner, King Kong\n\n1934: Heinz Roemheld, Black Cat\n\n1935: Max Steiner, The Informer (Oscar)\n\n1936: Charlie Chaplin, Modern Times\n\n1937: Frank Churchill, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Oscar)\n\n1938: Erich Wolfgang Korngold, The Adventures of Robin Hood (Oscar)\n\n1939: Hebert Stothart, The Wizard of Oz (Oscar)\n\n1940: Charlie Chaplin / Meredith Willson, The Great Dictator (Oscar)\n\n1941: Bernard Herrmann, Citizen Kane (Oscar)\n\n1942: Bernard Herrmann, The Magnificent Ambersons\n\n1943: Max Steiner, Casablanca (Oscar)\n\n1944: David Raksin, Laura\n\n1945: Miklos Rozsa, Spellbound (Oscar)\n\n1946: Maurice Thiriet, Children of Paradise\n\n1947: Georges Auric, La belle at le bete\n\n1948: Max Steiner, Treasure of the Sierra Madre\n\n1949: Alessandro Cicognini, Bicycle Thieves\n\n1950: Franz Waxman, Sunset Blvd. (Oscar, Globe)\n\n1951: Alex North, A Streetcar Named Desire (Oscar)\n\n1952: Fumio Hayasaka, Rashomon\n\n1953: Hugo Friedhofer, From Here to Eternity (Oscar)\n\n1954: Leonard Bernstein, On the Waterfront (Oscar)\n\n1955: Ikuma Dan, Samurai I: Miyamoto Musashi\n\n1956: Fumio Hayasaka, Seven Samurai\n\n1957: Malcolm Arnold, The Bridge on the River Kwai (Oscar)\n\n1958: Bernard Herrmann, Vertigo\n\n1959: Bernard Herrmann, North by Northwest\n\n1960: Ernest Gold, Exodus (Oscar, Globe)\n\n1961: Henry Mancini, Breakfast at Tiffany’s (Oscar)\n\n1962: Maurice Jarre, Lawrence of Arabia (Oscar, Globe)\n\n1963: Elmer Bernstein, The Great Escape\n\n1964: Henry Mancini, The Pink Panther (Oscar)\n\n1965: Maurice Jarre, Doctor Zhivago (Oscar, Globe)\n\n1966: Maurice Jarre, The Professionals\n\n1967: Ennio Morricone, A Fistful of Dollars\n\n1968: Ennio Morricone, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\n1969: Ennio Morricone, Once Upon a Time in the West\n\n1970: Maurice Jarre, Ryan’s Daughter\n\n1971: Walter Carlos, A Clockwork Orange\n\n1972: Nina Rota, The Godfather (Oscar – revoked, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1973: Toshiski Tsushima, Battles without Honour and Humanity\n\n1974: Jerry Goldsmith, Chinatown (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1975: John Williams, Jaws (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1976: Bernard Herrmann, Taxi Driver (Oscar, BAFTA)\n\n1977: John Williams, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1978: John Williams, Superman (Oscar, Globe)\n\n1979: Jerry Goldsmith, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (Oscar, BAFTA)\n\n1980: John Williams, Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1981: John Williams, Raiders of the Lost Ark (Oscar, BAFTA)\n\n1982: James Horner, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\n\n1983: Michael Gore, Terms of Endearment (Oscar)\n\n1984: Randy Newman, The Natural (Oscar)\n\n1985: Alan Silvestri, Back to the Future\n\n1986: Ennio Morricone, The Mission (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1987: Mark Knopfler, The Princess Bride\n\n1988: Peter Gabriel, The Last Temptation of Christ (Globe)\n\n1989: James Horner, Glory (Globe)\n\n1990: John Barry, Dances with Wolves (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1991: John Williams, JFK (Oscar)\n\n1992: Trevor Jones / Randy Edelman, The Last of the Mohicans (BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1993: John Williams, Schindler’s List (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1994: Hans Zimmer, The Lion King (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe, CFC)\n\n1995: Patrick Doyle, Sense and Sensibility (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n1996: Carter Burwell, Fargo (CFC)\n\n1997: John Williams, Amistad (Oscar)\n\n1998: Stephen Warbeck, Shakespeare in Love (Oscar, BAFTA)\n\n1999: John Williams, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\n\n2000: Tan Dun, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe, LAFC, CFC)\n\n2001: Howard Shore, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe, BFCA, LAFC, CFC)\n\n2002: Howard Shore, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (BFCA)\n\n2003: Howard Shore, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe, BFCA, CFC)\n\n2004: Shigeru Umebayashi, House of Flying Daggers\n\n2005: John Williams, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\n\n2006: Hans Zimmer, The Da Vinci Code (Globe, BFCA)\n\n2007: Dario Marianelli, Atonement (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe, BFCA)\n\n2008: A.R.

90 that earn points for Score but nothing else. Of those 90, 60 of them are ***, so are good films. Of the other 30, 24 are **.5. But that still leaves six films, films I rate as bad films but which I rate the Score as worthy of consideration. I give them here in rank order of Score.\n\nTrouble Man (Marvin Gaye, 1972, **)\n\nKing Richard and the Crusaders (Max Steiner, 1954, **)\n\nThe Witches of Eastwick (John Williams, 1987, **)\n\nPrince of Darkness (John Carpenter, 1987, *.5)\n\nBetween God, the Devil and a Winchester (Carlo Savina, 1968, **)\n\nRock-a-bye Baby (Walter Scharf, 1958, **)\n\nSince 2011\n\nThe Composers:\n\nAlexandre Desplat\n\nI could have listed Desplat up above, since he already four Oscar nominations, three Nighthawk nominations, a BAFTA and a Globe by 2006. But it’s really since 2011 that he has come into his own. He still hasn’t won a Nighthawk but he has come in second place three times since 2011 (Argo, Grand Budapest, Shape of Water) while winning two Oscars (the last two films) and two BAFTAs (the same) among six Oscars noms in just seven years. There’s no question that he is the most critically acclaimed composer working today. Since 2011, Desplat has gone from 59th place at the Oscars to a tie 14th, from 4th at the BAFTAs to a tie for 2nd (doubling his points) and from 15th to 4th at the Globes while tripling his points at the BFCA. Desplat’s Oscar total this decade is the highest for any composer in any decade other than John Williams since the 50’s.\n\nEssential Films: The Shape of Water, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Argo\n\nOscar Notes: No one has entered the Top 10 since 2011 but Thomas Newman, Hans Zimmer and Alexandre Desplat are all getting really close (through 2018). John Williams is now up to 1200 and just 70 points behind Alfred Newman. Since 2011, Steven Spielberg has earned two more noms (only one with Williams) and Williams has had two more Star Wars scores earn nominations. No more Foreign films have earned nominations since 2011. The genres have been a bit different since 2011. Only one Drama has won the award and at six years and counting it’s at the largest gap in history for the genre while the first Western (Hateful Eight) in 25 years and only the second since 1969 won and La La Land became the first Musical to earn a nom in 20 years and the first to win in 30 years. Since 2011, only one Best Picture winner has won Score and only three Picture winners were even nominated but more than half of the Score nominees have also been Picture nominees and only Score winner (Hateful Eight) wasn’t Picture nominated. Only two films since 2011 have earned just the one nomination for Score, both of them in 2013 (The Book Thief, Saving Mr Banks).\n\nBAFTA Notes: Since 2011, Alexandre Desplat has moved way up the list (he is now at 300 points), Hans Zimmer has moved up to 225 points and Thomas Newman has entered the list with 150 points. John Williams is now up to 550 points, almost double any other composer. After 21 of 22 Picture winners earning at least a Score nomination from 1993 to 2013, Boyhood, Three Billboards and Roma all failed to earn Score noms. No Drama has won the award since 2011. A Star is Born made Lady Gaga the first female winner in this category. In 2013, The Book Thief became the first film to earn a Film Music nomination at the BAFTAs with no other nominations in 23 years and no film has done it again since.\n\nBFCA Notes: Since 2011, the Top 5 has had some significant changes.\n\nBFCA Top 5 (through 2018):\n\nJohn Williams – 275\n\nHans Zimmer – 275\n\nHoward Shore – 250\n\nAlexandre Desplat – 225\n\nTrent Reznor / Atticus Ross / Jonny Greenwood / Justin Hurwitz – 100\n\nGolden Globe Notes: The second half of the Top 10 is still the same but the Top 5 has changed.\n\nGlobes Top 5 (through 2018):\n\nJohn Williams – 750\n\nHans Zimmer – 375\n\nMaurice Jarre – 350\n\nAlexandre Desplat – 300\n\nEnnio Morricone – 275\n\nNighthawk Notes: Since 2011, Andy Nelson has earned another 180 points and is now in 1st place by a long, long way. In fact, that 180 points he’s earned since 2011 would put him the Top 10 All-Time. Captain Phillips becomes just the third film since 1984 to earn a Sound nomination but no other nominations at the Nighthawks. Spielberg’s films have earned two more nominations. Andy Nelson would tie Douglas Shearer for Weighted Points in 2012, go flying past him in 2015 and soar even higher in 2016 and is now at 661 points. Nelson is also now up to astounding 850 Absolute Points, way more than anyone else while Christopher Boyes has soared up the Top 10 list with 470 points now. Bear in mind that Nelson’s total doesn’t even include Ready Player One or his work that hasn’t been released yet such as the next Fantastic Beasts film or the next Star Wars film; reaching 1000 points is entirely feasible before the end of the decade even. La La Land is easily the Best Score from a Musical. Spielberg has another nom (with Williams), Star Wars has two more wins and another nom, The Hobbit has a win and two other noms and Fantastic Beasts adds another Wizarding World nomination. The Book Thief is the only film nominated for Score since 2011 with just one nomination.\n\nFor Absolute Points, Alexandre Desplat entered the Top 20 in 2012, leapt into the Top 10 in 2014 (with Thomas Newman following him into the Top 10 in 2015) and by 2018 has moved all the way into 4th place with 794 points. For Weighted Points, Hans Zimmer is up to #4, just one point behind Jarre and Howard Shore is now #8 on the list, just behind Morricone while Desplat is a little ways out of the Top 10.\n\nTop 5 Absolute Points 2012-2018\n\nAlexandre Desplat – 362\n\nMichael Giacchino – 319\n\nJohn Williams – 277\n\nThomas Newman – 260\n\nHoward Shore – 213\n\n9 point Scores Since 2011:\n\nHoward Shore, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, 2012\n\nSteven Price, Gravity, 2013\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, 2015\n\nEnnio Morricone, The Hateful Eight, 2015\n\nJustin Hurwitz, La La Land, 2016\n\nMichael Giacchino, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, 2016\n\nJohn Williams, Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, 2017\n\nThe Nighthawk Winners:\n\n2012: Howard Shore, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\n\n2013: Steven Price, Gravity (Oscar, BAFTA, BFCA, Globe)\n\n2014: Antonio Sanchez, Birdman (BFCA, BAFTA, Globe)\n\n2015: John Williams, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (Oscar, BAFTA)\n\n2016: Justin Hurwitz, La La Land (Oscar, BAFTA, Globe, BFCA, LAFC)\n\n2017: John Williams, Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (Oscar)\n\n2018: Justin Hurwitz, First Man (Globe, BFCA)\n\nSingularity: Since 2013, we have had the first film ever to earn just a single nomination each from the Oscars, Globes and BAFTAs and for that single nomination from all three groups to be Score: The Book Thief, which of course, is a John Williams score. What’s more, it also earns a Nighthawk nom but nothing else.\n\nChart / Consensus Notes: Because Whiplash didn’t even earn a CAS nomination, Birdman becomes the first Consensus winner since 2001 to not win either the Oscar or the BAFTA and Whiplash becomes the first film to win both the Oscar and BAFTA and fail to win the Consensus."
