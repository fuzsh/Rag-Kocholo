Soprano Renée Fleming talks about her role in the epic score of Howard Shore’s Lord of the Rings.

15.00-16.00 The Early Music Show

Hannah French looks back at representations of period music in film. She talks to composer and cellist Peter Gregson about scoring the film A Little Chaos, directed by Alan Rickman, and starring Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts as two landscape artists who become romantically entangled while building a garden in King Louis XIV's palace at Versailles. Peter explains how he drew on the music of Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, a harpsichordist who worked at the Court of Louis XIV, and who composed much of her music in Versailles. Jocelyn Pook chats to Hannah about her inspirations when writing the music for the 2004 film of The Merchant of Venice, starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, and Joseph Fiennes. She speaks about drawing on Italian, English, and Sephardic Jewish music to infuse her score with a16th-century Italian flavour. Hannah also looks at how films have included existing music to create a sense of time and place, whether it's adaptations of music by Handel in The Madness of King George, or a more subtle influence in John Barry's Academy Award-winning score for the 1968 film A Lion in Winter, set in the Loire Valley in France in 1183.

17.00-17.30 The Listening Service

From 2001: A Space Odyssey to Barbie, from The Shining to Maestro, Tom listens in to some of the most iconic film scenes using needle-dropped classical music. He explores how directors harness the resonance and meanings of a piece of music to enrich the film's storytelling, and how a successful fusion of sound and image can leave such a deep impression in viewers' minds that music and film become inextricably entwined in popular consciousness. Plus Maggie Rodford – one of the film industry's most sought after Music Supervisors – pulls back the curtain on the processes and thinking behind choosing the right needle drop for the right scene to make the most meaningful movie.

18.45-19.15 Between the Ears

An immersive dive into the life and music of one of the greatest film music composers of all time: Henry Mancini, who was born 100 years ago this year. Mancini is one of the great icons of film music. His scores for movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and The Pink Panther, or TV shows like Peter Gunn, not only brought him Academy Awards and a glittering career, but featured songs and themes that have become instantly hummable classics in their own right away from the screen. Alongside these seminal hits like Moon River or Days of Wine and Roses, and a reputation for 'cool jazz' Mancini was actually one of the most versatile composers in Hollywood. He pushed the artform in new directions and inspired some of the biggest names in film music today, from John Williams to Quincy Jones. This Between the Ears tells Henry Mancini's story from his early life as the son of Italian immigrants in Pittsburgh where he was first handed a flute by his father, through his years as a musician in the Big Bands, learning the film trade at Universal Pictures, and eventually to composing some of the most recognisable music on film. With recordings of Mancini himself from the BBC Archives, there’s also interviews with his daughter Monica Mancini, and son in law Gregg Field, as well as film historian Jon Burlingame and pianist Tom Poster.

19.15-19.30 Sunday Feature: New Generation Thinkers – shorts

On Oscar night, New Generation Thinker Diarmuid Hester celebrates a film that's often included in lists of 'great movies' but struggles to be viewed other than through the lens of its own notorious reputation. Flaming Creatures fell foul of New York obscenity laws in the early 1960s, when it was first seen. The creation of avantgarde film maker Jack Smith, it follows an ensemble of artists, including for the first time on film drag performers. It was made in the rooftop studio Smith shared with Tony Conrad who provided the soundtrack. But the look, the challenge and the concept of the film was very quickly swamped by its reputation as 'pornographic' and, according to New York legislation of the time, 'obscene'. Diarmuid talks to people who knew Smith, and visits the filmmakers archive to see what Smith himself thought of both the film and its reputation, over which he had increasingly little control.
