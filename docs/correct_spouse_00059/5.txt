SARATOGA SPRINGS – Shaun O’Brien, 86, a member of the New York City Ballet for more than four decades, died last week from natural causes.

Shaun and his partner of 62 years, Cris Alexander, became enchanted with Saratoga in 1966 when the New York City Ballet opened at Saratoga Performing Arts Center for its premiere season. They bought a home in Saratoga in 1973 and moved there full time in 1992.

Shaun started dancing as a child, performing with his older sister at the age of only 4. He danced ever since. He performed on Broadway prior to beginning his career with the New York City Ballet in 1949.

Shaun’s most famous roles were as Drosselmeyer in “The Nutcracker” and as Dr. Coppelius in George Balanchine’s “Coppelia.” He was recognized for bringing both these characters to life with his remarkable stage presence and acting skills.

He performed in more than 100 ballets and is credited for “creating” the character of the tragic dollmaker in his roll as Dr. Coppelius.

Shaun worked with many legendary dancers throughout his career, including Patricia McBride, Allegra Kent, Violette Verdy, Edward Villella and close friend for many years, Jacques d’Amboise. Shaun often spoke of New York City Ballet director and choreographer George Balanchine, who he admired and respected.

Shaun was born in Brooklyn in the Bay Ridge neighborhood. His parents, Michael and Elsie O’Brien, along with his three siblings, were proud of him and celebrated having a star in their family.

Shaun was a resident of Saratoga Springs for almost 40 years, was a part of Saratoga’s art community and was recognized wherever he went. The restaurant community will miss him as well.

Shaun is survived by his partner of 62 years and legal spouse, Cris Alexander, actor, photographer and painter.

William J. Burke & Sons Funeral Home confirmed O’Brien’s death last Thursday.

A celebration of Shaun’s life will be held at a later date
