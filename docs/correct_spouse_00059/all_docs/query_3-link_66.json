        "text": "Coronation Street spoilers follow.\n\nCoronation Street star Paddy Bever has teased the reported upcoming return of Martin Platt, who's expected to make a comeback as part of iconic character Gail Platt's exit storyline.\n\nBever, who plays Martin's adoptive grandson Max Turner on the soap, spoke to The Sun at the Radio Times Soap Awards about welcoming Martin star Sean Wilson onto set again.\n\n\"Absolutely yeah,\" he said when asked whether he was looking forward to working with the actor. \"I've not met him yet but I've heard lots of lovely things.\"\n\nRelated: Corrie's Lucy Fallon responds to co-star's exit\n\nWilson has not yet spoken publicly about his rumored return, but it's thought he'll make his way back to the cobbles to help give Gail a happy ending.\n\nAfter it was confirmed actor Helen Worth will be leaving her role as Gail after 50 years, Corrie's executive producer Iain MacLeod promised Gail wouldn't be getting a tragic ending. Instead, he revealed he's been considering what viewers would like to see in her final scenes.\n\n\"Gail has had a hard life. She had a difficult childhood and disastrous marriages,\" he said. \"So, we thought what viewers really want is a happy ending for her, so that what we're doing.\"\n\nRelated: Coronation Street to air special episode for Paul and Billy\n\nMartin was introduced to the street in 1985 and he went on to enjoy a decade-long marriage to Gail. The two welcomed a son, David Platt, in 1990.\n\nGail and Martin's marriage ended after he had an affair with nurse Rebecca Hopkins. He then went on to controversially date teenager Katy Harris. He later left Weatherfield behind in 2005 when he met girlfriend Robyn, with the couple going on to welcome a daughter off-screen one year later.\n\nMartin's last appearance was in 2018, when he told David that he was emigrating to New Zealand with his family. While David considered moving abroad himself, he eventually decided to stick around in Weatherfield.\n\nGail's exit storyline is due to air on ITV1 and on top streaming service ITVX towards the end of the year.\n\nCoronation Street airs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV1 and streams on ITVX.\n\nRead more Coronation Street spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nCheck out Digital Spy's curated round-up of the best Amazon Prime Day deals for 2024 here\n\nYou Might Also Like"
