        "text": "Passed away peacefully, at the Caribou Memorial Veteran’s Pavilion, St. John’s NL on March 2, 2024, William Alexander “Bill” Luscombe. Born July 8, 1925, at the Grace Hospital in St. John’s. Predeceased by his wife Emily Victoria (nee Goodyear); parents, John and Clara; his brother Jack (Ontario); his sisters Agnes, Sylvia and Marjory of St. John’s, and his infant daughter, Jill.\n\nHe was a proud veteran, a long-standing member of the Canadian Legion, and a Shriner, and will be remembered as a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather by all his family. Others may remember him from his former careers as a De Havilland Aircraft foreman in Toronto, owner of Luscombe’s Driving School in St. John’s, or proprietor of the Trading Post in Bay Roberts.\n\nBill was a WWII veteran. He volunteered with the North Nova Scotia Highlanders to defend his country, at age seventeen, and fought in the liberation of Belgium and Holland in 1944-45. He met and fell in love with his future wife and fellow veteran (Canadian Women’s Army Corps), Vicki Goodyear, aboard the SS Kyle on their mutual return from service, to Newfoundland, in 1945.\n\nSome of his happiest times were spent on weekends at the “bayhouse” in Bareneed, Conception Bay, where extended family gathered for Saturday night singalongs or “hootenannys” as he liked to call them. He was an avid boxing and hockey fan all his life, and he loved the Toronto Maple Leafs almost as much as he disliked the Montreal Canadians.\n\nHe leaves to mourn his son Bill, of Hagersville, ON, and grandchildren Kelly and Bill, ON; son Rob of Halifax, NS and partner Jayne (Rideout), and grandchildren Nicholas and Thomas; daughter Deb O’Brien, of St. John’s, partner Sean and grandchildren Tim (Jaclyn Whelan) and Katie (Shannon Dwyer); son Capt. Richard, of St. Philips, and grandchildren Aimee, Danielle, Emily and Alex; and son Phil of Cambridge, ON., partner Tina Kent and grandchildren Janine and Stephen. Also mourning his loss are 14 great-grandchildren, 4 great-great-grandchildren, and 22 nieces and nephews.\n\nMany thanks to the wonderful staff at the Veteran’s Pavilion, for the kindness, support, and care shown to Bill and to Vicki over the last six years."
