        "text": "This is what Iâ€™m talking about! AUSactive leading with action straight to Canberra. When we all pull together as an industry and put our collective weight behind an initiative, incredible things happen. MillionMoves on the Sunshine Coast achieved over 2 million moves from a demographic who donâ€™t use our gyms and facilities. Remarkably, 70% of participants reported having at least one chronic illness that could be improved with exercise. Iâ€™m proud to be a board member of an organization that is tackling these issues head-on.
