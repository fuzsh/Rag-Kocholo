        "text": "Founded in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa is the nationâ€™s oldest and most prestigious academic honor society. Since its founding, 17 U.S. Presidents, 39 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and more than 130 Nobel Laureates have been inducted as members.\n\nAcquiring a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa is not a simple matter and we are one of the 290 colleges to house a chapter on campus. Colleges must go through a rigorous application process, lasting several years. The college must have at least five members of Phi Beta Kappa as professors on staff, it must submit an enormous amount of information demonstrating academic excellence and a commitment to education in the liberal arts and, finally, it must pass muster during an on-campus visit by members of the national leadership.\n\nBrother Abdon Lewis Garavaglia, a literature professor who had become a member of Phi Beta Kappa at Catholic University, was the driving force behind Manhattan College's ten-year effort to win its own chapter of the society. When the Upsilon of New York Chapter was finally established at Manhattan College in 1971, it became the first Christian Brothers School, and the sixth Catholic institution of higher education, to acquire a chapter."
