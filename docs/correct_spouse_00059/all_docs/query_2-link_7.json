He would become a perennial audience favorite for nearly all that time. Shaun began a romantic relationship with actor/ photographer Cris Alexander in the 1940’s and the couple would remain together for the next 60 years. They would live to see gay marriage legalized and in 2011 tied the knot. Shaun and Alexander died less than two weeks apart, Alexander age 92 and Shaun passing first age 86., having shared their life and their love.\".",
