        "text": "I teach because I was raised to believe that the exchange of ideas is one of the most important things we can participate in. Being in a Jesuit school allows us to be lifelong learners.\n\nThis is my vocation, not my job. I cherish the day-to-day opportunities I get to live my faith life in my teaching and in my interactions with students.\n\nI choose to teach in a Catholic high school because I receive the opportunity each day to create a life-giving home for my students in a faith-based environment. Our school is a family that shares in our academic, spiritual, and personal successes and joys. Our students and teachers lovingly guide each other through simple moments of this life, slowly walking each other towards our eternal home in heaven.\n\nAs the son of two career Catholic educators and administrators who have dedicated more than 50 years of each of their lives to education and educational administration in St. Louis, I have always possessed a true appreciation of—and respect for—the concept of \"education as a vocation,\" and the challenges, sacrifices, and ultimate rewards and successes that define such a career choice.\n\nThe future world can always be better, and the future is our students. I teach because I want to help shape a better future.\n\nI teach to challenge students to go beyond what they think they are capable of achieving. Ultimately it’s about pushing a student to that moment when he realizes he doesn’t need me to learn and to support him in the failures that happen along the way.\n\nI get to practice my faith in my place of work and do what God called me to do. A school is much more than simply succeeding in academics. Understanding content means nothing if you can't see beauty and value in \"knowing\" and don't utilize knowledge to live out your gifts, which God bestowed on you in service to others.\n\nPhysics introduces students to a different way of scientific thinking. My goal is to have my students learn that way so if they do wish to pursue physics or engineering in college, they will have skills that will help them succeed at the next level."
