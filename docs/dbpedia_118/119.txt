You should expect and budget for your fees to increase each year.

Your fee is based on the year you enter the university, not your year of study. This means that if you repeat a year or resume your studies after an interruption, your fees will only increase by the amount linked to inflation.

Find out more about our tuition fees payment terms, including how inflationary increases are applied to your tuition fees in subsequent years of study.

If you're a UK national, or EU national with settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you may be able to apply for a Postgraduate Master’s Loan from the UK government, if you meet certain criteria.

The government has not yet published the loan amount for students starting courses in Autumn 2024. As a guide, the maximum value of the loan was £12,167 for courses starting on or after 1 August 2023.

The loan is not means-tested and you can choose whether to put it towards your tuition fees or living costs.
