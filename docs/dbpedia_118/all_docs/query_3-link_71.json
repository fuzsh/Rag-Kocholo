        "text": "Example 1: In a class of 45 students, we calculate their mean marks to evaluate performance of that class.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics uses data that provides a description of the population either through numerical calculated graphs or tables. It provides a graphical summary of data.\n\nIt is simply used for summarizing objects, etc. There are two categories in this as follows.\n\nMeasure of Central Tendency\n\nMeasure of Variability\n\nLet’s discuss both categories in detail.\n\nMeasure of Central Tendency\n\nMeasure of central tendency is also known as summary statistics that are used to represent the center point or a particular value of a data set or sample set. In statistics, there are three common measures of central tendency that are:\n\nMean\n\nMedian\n\nMode\n\nStatistics formula\n\nStatistic Formula Definition Example Mean x̄=∑ x/n​​ The arithmetic average of a set of values. It’s calculated by adding up all the values in the data set and dividing by the number of values. Example: Consider the data set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.\n\n(2+4+6+8+10/ 5)\n\nMean = 5\n\n​\n\nMedian Middle value in an ordered data set The middle value of a data set when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there’s an odd number of observations, it’s the value at the center position. If there’s an even number, it’s the average of the two middle values. Example: Data set {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}. Median = 9 Mode Value that appears most frequently in a data set The value that occurs most frequently in a data set. There can be one mode (unimodal), multiple modes (multimodal), or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency. Example: Data set {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7}. Mode = 6\n\nMean\n\nIt is the measure of the average of all values in a sample set. The mean of the data set is calculated using the formula:\n\nMean = ∑x/n\n\nFor example:\n\nCars\n\nMileage\n\nCylinder\n\nSwift\n\n21.3\n\n3\n\nVerna\n\n20.8\n\n2\n\nSantra\n\n19\n\n5\n\nMean = (Sum of all Terms)/(Total Number of Terms)\n\n⇒ Mean = (21.3 + 20.8 + 19) /3 = 61.1/3\n\n⇒ Mean = 20.366\n\nMedian\n\nIt is the measure of the central value of a sample set. In these, the data set is ordered from lowest to highest value and then finds the exact middle. The formula used to calculate the median of the data set is, suppose we are given ‘n’ terms in s data set:\n\nIf n is Even\n\nMedian = [(n/2)th term + (n/2 + 1)th term]/2\n\nIf n is Odd\n\nMedian = (n + 1)/2\n\nFor example:\n\nCars\n\nMileage\n\nCylinder\n\nSwift\n\n21.3\n\n3\n\nVerna\n\n20.8\n\n2\n\nSantra\n\n19\n\n5\n\ni 20 15 4\n\nData in Ascending order: 15, 19, 20.8, 21.3\n\n⇒ Median = (20.8 + 19) /2 = 39.8/2\n\n⇒ Median = 19.9\n\nMode\n\nIt is the value most frequently arrived in the sample set. The value repeated most of the time in the central set is actually mode. The mode of the data set is calculated using the formula:\n\nMode = Term with Highest Frequency\n\nFor example: {2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 6, 4, 7, 7, 4, 2, 4}\n\n4 is the most frequent term in this data set.\n\nThus, mode is 4.\n\nMeasure of Variability\n\nThe measure of Variability is also known as the measure of dispersion and is used to describe variability in a sample or population. In statistics, there are three common measures of variability as shown below:\n\n1. Range of Data\n\nIt is a given measure of how to spread apart values in a sample set or data set.\n\nRange = Maximum value – Minimum value\n\n2. Variance\n\nIn probability theory and statistics, variance measures a data set’s spread or dispersion. It is calculated by averaging the squared deviations from the mean. Variance is usually represented by the symbol σ2.\n\nS2= ∑ni=1 [(xi – ͞x)2 / n]\n\nn represents total data points\n\n͞x represents the mean of data points\n\nxi represents individual data points\n\nVariance measures variability. The more spread out the data, the greater the variance compared to the average.\n\nThere are two types of variance:\n\nPopulation variance: Often represented as σ²\n\nSample variance: Often represented as s².\n\nNote: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nDispersion\n\nIt is the measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.\n\nσ= √ (1/n) ∑ni=1 (xi – μ)2\n\nInferential Statistics\n\nInferential Statistics makes inferences and predictions about the population based on a sample of data taken from the population. It generalizes a large dataset and applies probabilities to draw a conclusion.\n\nIt is simply used for explaining the meaning of descriptive stats. It is simply used to analyze, interpret results, and draw conclusions. Inferential Statistics is mainly related to and associated with hypothesis testing whose main target is to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nHypothesis Testing\n\nHypothesis testing is a type of inferential procedure that takes the help of sample data to evaluate and assess the credibility of a hypothesis about a population.\n\nInferential statistics are generally used to determine how strong a relationship is within the sample. However, it is very difficult to obtain a population list and draw a random sample. Inferential statistics can be done with the help of various steps as given below:\n\nObtain and start with a theory.\n\nGenerate a research hypothesis.\n\nOperationalize or use variables\n\nIdentify or find out the population to which we can apply study material.\n\nGenerate or form a null hypothesis for these populations.\n\nCollect and gather a sample of children from the population and simply run a study.\n\nThen, perform all tests of statistical to clarify if the obtained characteristics of the sample are sufficiently different from what would be expected under the null hypothesis so that we can be able to find and reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTypes of Inferential Statistics\n\nVarious types of inferential statistics are used widely nowadays and are very easy to interpret. These are given below:\n\nOne sample test of difference/One sample hypothesis test\n\nConfidence Interval\n\nContingency Tables and Chi-Square Statistic\n\nT-test or Anova\n\nPearson Correlation\n\nBivariate Regression\n\nMulti-variate Regression\n\nData in Statistics\n\nData is the collection of numbers, words or anything that can be arranged to form a meaningful information. There are various types of the data in the statistics that are added below,\n\nTypes of Data\n\nVarious types of Data used in statistics are,\n\nQualitative Data –Qualitative data is the descriptive data of any object. For example, Kabir is tall, Kaira is thin, etc.\n\nQuantitative Data – Quantitative data is the numerical data of any object. For example, he ate three chapatis, and we are five friends.\n\nTypes of Quantitative Data\n\nWe have two types of quantitative data that include,\n\nDiscreate Data: The data that have fixed value is called discreate data, discreate data can easily be counted.\n\nContinuous Data: The data that has no fixed value and has a range of data is called continuous data. It can be measured.\n\nRepresentation of Data\n\nWe can easily represent the data using various graphs, charts or tables. Various types of representing data set are:\n\nBar Graph\n\nPie Chart\n\nLine Graph\n\nPictograph\n\nHistogram\n\nFrequency Distribution\n\nModels of Statistics\n\nVarious models of Statistics are used to measure different forms of data. Some of the models of the statistics are added below:\n\nSkewness in Statistics\n\nANOVA Statistics\n\nDegree of Freedom\n\nRegression Analysis\n\nMean Deviation for Ungrouped Data\n\nMean Deviation for Discrete Grouped data\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\nCausal Analysis\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nAssociational Statistical Analysis\n\nLet’s learn about them in detail.\n\nSkewness in Statistics\n\nSkewness in statistics is defined as the measure of the asymmetry in a probability distribution that is used to measure the normal probability distribution of data.\n\nSkewed data can be either positive or negative. If a data curve shifts from left to right is called positive skewed. If the curve moves towards the right to left it is called left skewed.\n\nANOVA Statistics\n\nANOVA statistics is another name for the Analysis of Variance in statistics. In the ANOVA model, we use the difference of the mean of the data set from the individual data set to measure the dispersion of the data set.\n\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a set of statistical tools created by Ronald Fisher to compare means. It helps analyze differences among group averages. ANOVA looks at two kinds of variation: the differences between group averages and the differences within each group. The test tells us if there are disparities among the levels of the independent variable, though it doesn’t pinpoint which differences matter the most.\n\nANOVA relies on four key assumptions:\n\nInterval Scale: The dependent data should be measured at an interval scale, meaning the intervals between values are consistent.\n\nNormal Distribution: The population distribution should ideally be normal, resembling a bell curve.\n\nHomoscedasticity: This assumption states that the variances of the errors should be consistent across all levels of the independent variable.\n\nMulticollinearity: There shouldn’t be significant correlation among the independent variables, as this can skew results.\n\nAdditionally, ANOVA assumes homogeneity of variance, meaning all groups being compared have similar variance.\n\nANOVA calculates mean squares to determine the significance of factors (treatments). The treatment mean square is found by dividing the treatment sum of squares by the degrees of freedom.\n\nIt operates with a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1). The null hypothesis generally posits that there’s no difference among the means of the samples, while the alternative hypothesis suggests at least one difference exists among the means of the samples.\n\nDegree of Freedom\n\nDegree of Freedom model in statistics measures the changes in the data set if there is a change in the value of the data set. We can move data in this model if we want to estimate any parameter of the data set.\n\nRegression Analysis\n\nRegression Analysis model of the statistics is used to determine the relation between the variables. It gives the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variable.\n\nThere are various types of regression analysis techniques:\n\nLinear regression: This method is used when the relationship between the variables is linear, meaning the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable.\n\nLogistic regression: Used to predict categorical dependent variables, such as yes or no, true or false, or 0 or 1. It’s used in classification tasks, such as determining if a transaction is fraudulent or if an email is spam.\n\nRidge regression: Ridge regression is a technique used to combat multicollinearity in linear regression models. It adds a penalty term to the regression equation to prevent overfitting. It’s most suitable when a data set contains more predictor variables than observations.\n\nLasso regression: Similar to ridge regression, lasso regression also adds a penalty term to the regression equation. However, lasso regression tends to shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n\nPolynomial regression: Uses polynomial functions to find the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. It can capture nonlinear relationships between variables, which may not be possible with simple linear regression.\n\nBayesian linear regression: Bayesian linear regression incorporates Bayesian statistics into the linear regression framework. It allows for the estimation of parameters with uncertainty and the incorporation of prior knowledge into the regression model.\n\nHow to create chart and table\n\nChoose the right chart type: Different chart types are better suited for different kinds of data. For example, bar charts are good for comparing categories, while line charts are good for showing trends over time.\n\nKeep it simple: Don’t overload your chart with too much information. Make sure the labels are clear and easy to read.\n\nUse clear and concise titles: Your chart title should accurately reflect the information being presented.\n\nUse color effectively: Color can be a great way to highlight important data points, but avoid using too many colors or colors that clash.\n\nMean Deviation for Ungrouped Data\n\nSuppose we are given ‘n’ terms in a data set x1, x2, x3, …, xn then the mean deviation about means and median is calculated using the formula,\n\nMean Deviation for Ungrouped Data = Sum of Deviation/Number of Observation\n\nMean of Ungrouped Data = ∑in (x – μ)/n\n\nMean Deviation for Discrete Grouped data\n\nLet there are x1, x2, x3, …, xn term and their respective frequency are, f1, f2, f3, …, fn then the mean is calculated using the formula,\n\na) Mean Deviation About Mean\n\nMean deviation about the mean of the data set is calculated using the formula,\n\nMean Deviation (μ) = ∑i = 1n fi (xi – μ)/N\n\nb) Mean Deviation About Median\n\nMean deviation about the median of the data set is calculated using the formula,\n\nMean Deviation (μ) = ∑i = 1n fi (xi – M)/N\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) is a statistical approach for summarizing the main characteristics of data sets. It’s an important first step in any data analysis.\n\nHere are some steps involved in EDA:\n\nCollect data\n\nFind and understand all variables\n\nClean the dataset\n\nIdentify correlated variables\n\nChoose the right statistical methods\n\nVisualize and analyze results\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) uses graphs and visual tools to spot overall trends and peculiarities in data. These can be anything from outliers, which are data points that stand out, to unexpected characteristics of the data set.\n\nFollowing are the four types of EDA:\n\nUnivariate non-graphical\n\nMultivariate non-graphical\n\nUnivariate graphical\n\nMultivariate graphical\n\nCausal Analysis\n\nCausal analysis is a process that aims to identify and understand the causes and effects of a problem. It involves:\n\nIdentifying the relevant variables and collecting data.\n\nAnalyzing the data using statistical techniques to determine whether there is a significant relationship between the variables.\n\nDrawing conclusions about the causal relationship between the variables.\n\nCausal analysis differs from simple correlation in that it investigates the underlying mechanisms and factors that drive changes in variable values, rather than simply finding statistical links. It provides evidence of the causal relationships between variables.\n\nLet’s look at some examples where we might use causal analysis:\n\nWe want to know if adding more fertilizer makes plants grow better.\n\nCan taking a specific medicine prevent someone from getting sick?\n\nTo figure out cause and effect, we often use experiments like giving different groups different treatments and comparing results. These types of studies, called “randomized controlled trials,” are usually the best way to show that something caused a change.\n\nSometimes, other things can interfere with our understanding of cause and effect. For example, two things might appear connected because they both come from a third factor. This confusion is known as “confounding.” When confounding happens, it can lead us to wrongly think that one thing caused another when it really didn’t.\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nStandard Deviation is a measure of how widely distributed a set of values are from the mean. It compares every data point to the average of all the data points.\n\nA low standard deviation means values are close to the average, while a high standard deviation means values spread out over a wider range. Standard deviation is like the distance between points but applied differently. Using algebra on squares and square roots, rather than absolute values, makes standard deviation convenient in various mathematical applications.\n\nAssociational Statistical Analysis\n\nAssociational statistical analysis is a method that researchers use to identify correlations between many variables. It can also be used to examine whether researchers can draw conclusions and make predictions about one data set based on the features of another.\n\nAssociational analysis examines how two or more features are related while considering other possibly influencing factors.\n\nSome measures of association are:\n\nChi-square Test for Association\n\nChi-square test of independence, also called the chi-square test of association, is a statistical method for determining the relationship between two variables that are categorical. It assesses if the variables are unrelated or related. Chi-square test determines the statistical significance of the relationship between variables rather than the intensity of the association. It determines if there is a substantial difference between the observed and expected data. By comparing the two datasets, we can determine whether the variables have a logical association.\n\nFor example, a chi-square test can be done to see if there is a statistically significant relationship between gender and the type of product bought. A p-value larger than 0.02 indicates that there is no statistically significant correlation.\n\nCorrelation Coefficient\n\nA correlation coefficient is a numerical estimate of the statistical connection that exists between two variables. The variables could be two columns from a data set or two elements of a multivariate random variable.\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient (r) measures linear correlation, ranging from -1 to 1. It shows the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A coefficient of 0 means no linear relationship, while -1 or +1 indicates a perfect linear relationship.\n\nHere are some examples of correlations:\n\nPositive linear correlation: When the variable on the x-axis rises as the variable on the y-axis increases.\n\nNegative linear correlation: When the values of the two variables move in opposite directions.\n\nNonlinear correlation: Also called curvilinear correlation.\n\nNo correlation: When the two variables are entirely independent.\n\nData Analysis\n\nData Analysis is all about making sense of information by using mathematical and logical methods. In simpler terms, it means looking carefully at lots of facts and figures, organizing them, summarizing them, and then checking to see if everything adds up correctly.\n\nTypes of Data Analysis\n\nThere are basically three types of data analysis which are as follows:\n\nDescriptive Analysis\n\nPredictive Analysis\n\nPrescriptive Analysis\n\nDescriptive Analysis\n\nExamining numerical data and calculations aids in comprehending business operations. Descriptive analysis serves various purposes such as:\n\nAssessing customer satisfaction\n\nMonitoring campaigns\n\nProducing reports\n\nEvaluating performance\n\nPredictive Analysis\n\nUses historical data, statistical models, and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions about future outcomes. Some applications of predictive analytics are:\n\nSales Forecasting: Predictive analytics can help businesses forecast future sales trends based on historical data and market variables.\n\nCustomer Churn Prediction: Businesses can use predictive analytics to identify customers who are likely to churn or stop using their services, allowing proactive measures to retain them.\n\nHealthcare Diagnostics: Predictive analytics can aid in diagnosing diseases and predicting patient outcomes based on medical history, symptoms, and other relevant data.\n\nPrescriptive Analysis\n\nUses extensive methods and technologies to analyse data and information in order to determine the best course of action or plan.\n\nFor example, prescriptive analysis may suggest specific products to online customers based on their previous behaviour.\n\nCoefficient of Variation\n\nCoefficient of Variation is calculated using the formula,\n\nCV = σ/μ × 100\n\nWhere,\n\nσ is Standard Deviation\n\nμ is Arithmetic Mean\n\nApplications of Statistics\n\nVarious application of statistics in mathematics are added below,\n\nStatistics is used in mathematical computing.\n\nStatistics is used in finding probability and chances.\n\nStatistics is used in weather forcasting, etc.\n\nBusiness Statistics\n\nBusiness statistics is the process of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data relevant to business operations and decision-making. It is a critical tool for organizations to gain insights into their performance, market dynamics, and customer behavior.\n\nScope of Statistics\n\nStatistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It is used in a wide variety of fields, including:\n\nScience: Statistics is used to design experiments, analyze data, and draw conclusions about the natural world.\n\nBusiness: Statistics is used to market products, track sales, and make financial decisions.\n\nGovernment: Statistics is used to track economic trends, measure the effectiveness of government programs, and allocate resources.\n\nHealthcare: Statistics is used to develop new drugs, track the spread of diseases, and assess the effectiveness of medical treatments.\n\nSports: Statistics is used to analyze player performance, scout new talent, and predict the outcome of games.\n\nLimitations of Statistics\n\nWhile statistics is a powerful tool, it is important to be aware of its limitations. Some of the most important limitations include:\n\nData quality: The quality of statistical analysis is limited by the quality of the data. If the data is inaccurate, incomplete, or biased, the results of the analysis will also be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased.\n\nSampling: Statistics is often based on samples of data, rather than the entire population. This means that the results of the analysis may not be generalizable to the entire population.\n\nAssumptions:Statistical methods often rely on assumptions about the data, such as the assumption that the data is normally distributed. If these assumptions are not met, the results of the analysis may be misleading.\n\nCausation vs. correlation: Statistics can show that two variables are correlated, but it cannot prove that one variable causes the other.\n\nMisinterpretation: Statistics can be misused or misinterpreted, leading to false conclusions.\n\nSolved Problems – Statistics\n\nExample 1: Find the mean of the data set.\n\nxi\n\nfi\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n4\n\n8\n\n5\n\nSolution:\n\nxi\n\nfi\n\nfixi\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n12\n\n5\n\n4\n\n20\n\n8\n\n5\n\n40\n\nMean = (Σf ixi)/Σfi\n\nΣfixi = (6 + 12 + 20 + 40) = 78, and\n\nΣfi = 16\n\n⇒ Mean = 78/16 = 4.875\n\nExample 2: Find Standard Deviation of 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16.\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven,\n\nxi = 4, 7, 10, 13, 16\n\nN = 5\n\nΣxi = (4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + 16) = 50\n\n⇒ Mean(μ) = Σxi/N = 50/5 = 10\n\nStandard Deviation = √(σ) = √{∑i = 1n (xi – μ)}/N\n\n⇒ SD = √{1/5[(4 – 10)2 + (7 – 10)2 + (10 – 10)2 + (13 – 10)2 + (16 – 10)2]}\n\n⇒ SD = √{1/5[36 + 9 + 0 + 9 + 36] = √{1/5[90]} = 18\n\nConclusion of Statistics\n\nStatistics is not merely a collection of formulas; it’s a language that unlocks understanding across every discipline imaginable. From decoding the secrets of the universe to optimizing marketing campaigns, statistics plays a vital role. It empowers researchers in medicine, finance, engineering, and countless other fields to analyze patterns, measure risk, and predict future outcomes.\n\nStatistics – FAQs\n\nHow to calculate mean?\n\nThe mean is the most common way to calculate the “average” of a data set.\n\nFormula: Mean = Σ(x_i) / n\n\nΣ (sigma) represents the sum of all the values (x_i) in the data set.\n\nn represents the total number of values in the data set.\n\nHow to calculate median?\n\nThe median is the ‘middle’ value when the data is ordered from least to greatest.\n\nIf you have an odd number of data points, the median is the exact middle value.\n\nIf you have an even number of data points, the median is the mean of the two middle values.\n\nHow to calculate mode?\n\nThe mode is the most frequent value in the data set.
