        "text": "The Hankamer School of Business awards two basic types of scholarships to students who have been admitted into the Hankamer School of Business either after a minimum of 60 hours or as part of the Business Fellows or Business (Hankamer) programs.\n\nMerit-based scholarships – awarded primarily based on college academic success or other leadership criteria.\n\nNeed-based scholarships – awarded based upon documented need per the CSS Profile (www.cssprofile.org) and/or FAFSA (www.fafsa.gov). For consideration of any need-based scholarships, you must have completed the FAFSA. Students who started at Baylor before summer 2019 are exempt from the CSS Profile requirement; however, they must still submit a FAFSA for need-based scholarship consideration.\n\nFor the 2024-25 academic year, students seeking a business school scholarship should follow the following procedures:\n\nALL students should apply using Scholarship Universe.\n\nTo apply for these scholarships, use the menu on the top left to select the Applications tab. Next, select the HSB 2024-2025 General Scholarship Application. If your major is specific to one of the HSB Department Applications, you'll want to complete that application as well.\n\nFor merit-based scholarships, also complete this link\n\nNo additional application exists for need-based scholarships but ensure the CSS and/or FAFSA have been completed.\n\nFor departmental scholarships, please see the links below and follow any additional instructions.\n\nAll scholarship applications must be submitted by end of day (11:59 PM) on April 1. HSB Scholarship Committee recommendations are forwarded to the Student Financial Aid Office for final assignment, and award notifications are sent by Financial Aid in June for use the following academic year.\n\nNote: the incorporation of Scholarship Universe is an updated approach for the upcoming 2024-25 academic year. If you previously applied for any merit-based or departmental scholarships, you MUST also apply using the link above for consideration.\n\nEarl Patrick Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship was established to help fund the education of children of pastors, missionaries, and other faith-based leaders who have chosen a career in service to the Christian faith. Awards will cover 50% of tuition per year, and a recipient can receive the scholarship for up to four years. The scholarship is available to incoming or current Baylor students, but the recipient must maintain a business major (or pre-business) to receive financial support. Interested students should complete the Scholarship Universe application above as well as the link here:\n\nApplication Link\n\nDepartmental Scholarships\n\nDepartments also offer scholarships in addition to the Hankamer scholarships above. The Scholarship Universe application must also be submitted for consideration."
