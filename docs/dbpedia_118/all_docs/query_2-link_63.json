        "text": "The ESCB’s statistical function is based on a legal mandate to collect all necessary and relevant data in order to produce and disseminate impartial, reliable, appropriate, timely, consistent and accessible statistics in the areas under the ESCB’s responsibility. Where appropriate, these statistics comply with European and internationally agreed standards, guidelines and good practices. The independence granted to the ESCB under Article 130 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union entails, among other things, that there is no political interference in the compilation and dissemination of statistical information.\n\nThe ESCB attaches great importance to the quality of its statistics. It therefore takes into consideration internationally agreed quality standards, such as those formulated in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard and Data Quality Assessment Framework, which are in turn rooted in the UN’s Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. Without prejudice to the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as “the Statute”), it collaborates with the European Statistical System (ESS), which comprises Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the European Union (EU)), the national statistical institutes and other national statistical authorities, and takes account of the principles laid down in the European Statistics Code of Practice for the National and Community Statistical Authorities\n\nThe ESCB aims to perform its statistical function effectively and to use resources efficiently when collecting, compiling and disseminating statistics. In accordance with primary and secondary EU law (Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 5 of the Statute, and Council Regulation 2533/98 as amended by Council Regulation 951/2009 respectively), the aim is to collect the necessary statistical information of an appropriate quality while keeping the reporting burden on respondents to a minimum, guaranteeing their privacy and protecting the confidentiality of the non-public information they provide. The possible reuse, for administrative purposes, of confidential statistical information supplied by individual reporters to the ESCB is limited to information on businesses that would otherwise have to submit the same information to the ESCB twice (e.g. for minimum reserves purposes) and must be provided by law. In addition, the ESCB guarantees that confidential statistical information provided by an ESS authority is used for statistical purposes only.\n\nIn the performance of its statistical function the ESCB is committed to good governance and the highest ethical standards, as well as to executing its tasks in a spirit of cooperation and teamwork. In short, and in line with the Eurosystem Mission Statement, ESCB statistics are governed by a set of principles referring to the ESCB’s institutional environment, statistical processes and statistical output.\n\nInstitutional environment\n\nThe institutional set-up in which statistics are produced has a significant impact on their quality. The institutional environment significantly affects the integrity and credibility of the production and dissemination of statistics. The relevant principles that apply are:\n\nPrinciple 1: Professional independence\n\n“Professional independence” has two dimensions in the context of the ESCB’s statistical function. First, the independence of the ESCB is guaranteed by Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 of the Statute. This applies to all tasks performed by the ESCB and implies that there is to be no political interference in the ESCB’s performance of its statistical function. In accordance with the Statute, the ESCB shall not “seek or take instructions from EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies from any government of a Member State or from any other body”. Second, the production of ESCB statistics must meet the criterion of scientific independence, which implies that the choice of sources, definitions, methodologies and statistical techniques for the development and production of ESCB statistics, as well as decisions about the timing and content of all forms of dissemination, must be guided solely by statistical considerations.\n\nIndicators:\n\nThe independence of the ESCB statistical function from political and other external interference in developing, producing and disseminating European statistics is guaranteed by law.\n\nThe ESCB statistical function has responsibility for ensuring that European statistics are developed, produced and disseminated in an independent manner.\n\nThe ESCB statistical function has the sole responsibility for deciding on statistical methods, standards and procedures, and on the content and timing of statistical releases.\n\nThe statistical work programmes are published and periodic reports describe progress made.\n\nStatistical releases are clearly distinguished and issued separately from political/policy statements.\n\nThe ESCB, when appropriate, comments publicly on statistical issues, including criticisms and misuses of official European statistics.\n\nPrinciple 2: Mandate for data collection\n\n“Mandate for data collection” means that the ESCB must have a clear legal mandate to collect information for European statistical purposes. Moreover, it is empowered to impose sanctions on reporting agents which fail to comply with their obligations.\n\nIndicators:\n\nThe mandate of the ESCB to collect information for the production and dissemination of European statistics is specified in law.\n\nOn the basis of a legal act, the ESCB may compel the response to statistical surveys.\n\nPrinciple 3: Adequacy of resources\n\n“Adequacy of resources” means that human and financial resources, facilities and the IT infrastructure are used as efficiently as possible and are commensurate with the statistical work programme.\n\nIndicators:\n\nSkilled staff, and financial and computing resources, adequate both in magnitude and in quality, are available to meet current European statistical needs.\n\nThe scope, detail and cost of European statistics are commensurate with needs.\n\nProcedures exist to assess and justify demands for new European statistics against their cost.\n\nProcedures exist to assess the continuing need for all European statistics, to see if any can be discontinued or curtailed to free up resources.\n\nPrinciple 4: Commitment to quality\n\n“Commitment to quality” means that the ESCB statistical function is committed to quality. It systematically and regularly identifies strengths and weaknesses to continuously improve process and product quality.\n\nIndicators:\n\nQuality policy is defined and made available to the public.\n\nProcedures are in place to plan and monitor the quality of the statistical production process.\n\nProduct quality is regularly monitored, assessed and reported upon according to the ESCB quality criteria.\n\nThere is a regular and thorough review of the key statistical outputs.\n\nPrinciple 5: Statistical confidentiality\n\n“Statistical confidentiality” means the protection of confidential statistical information that relates to single statistical units and is collected by ESCB members either directly from reporting agents or indirectly from ESS authorities or other national/international entities. Confidential statistical information that is transmitted between an ESS authority and an ESCB member should not be used for purposes that are not exclusively statistical, such as for administrative or tax purposes, for legal proceedings or for verification or sanctioning in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of Council Regulation 2533/98. Such information should only be accessible to those staff performing statistical tasks within the specific domain to which the information relates. Moreover, the ESCB must take all regulatory, administrative, technical and organisational measures that are necessary to protect confidential statistical information from unlawful disclosure or use.\n\nIndicators:\n\nStatistical confidentiality is guaranteed by law.\n\nStaff sign legal confidentiality commitments on appointment.\n\nPenalties are prescribed for any wilful breaches of statistical confidentiality.\n\nGuidelines and instructions are provided to staff on the protection of statistical confidentiality in the production and dissemination processes. The confidentiality policy is made known to the public.\n\nPhysical, technological and organisational provisions are in place to protect the security and integrity of statistical databases.\n\nStrict protocols apply to external users accessing statistical microdata for research purposes.\n\nAt least once a year the ECB decision-making bodies publish a report on the application of the principle of statistical confidentiality.\n\nPrinciple 6: Impartiality and objectivity\n\n“Impartiality” means that ESCB statistics must be developed, produced and disseminated in a neutral manner. Furthermore, they must be equally accessible to all users in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the policy decisions of which they form the basis.\n\n“Objectivity” means that ESCB statistics must be developed, produced and disseminated in a systematic, reliable and unbiased manner. It implies adherence to professional and ethical standards and that the policies and practices followed are transparent to users and respondents.\n\nIndicators:\n\nStatistics are collected, compiled and disseminated on an objective basis determined by statistical considerations.\n\nChoices of sources and statistical methods as well as decisions about the dissemination of statistics are informed by statistical considerations.\n\nErrors discovered in published statistics are corrected at the earliest possible date and publicised.\n\nInformation on the methods and procedures used is publicly available.\n\nStatistical release dates and times are pre-announced.\n\nAdvance notice is given on major revisions or changes in methodologies, source data and techniques.\n\nAll European statistics are made available to all users. Any privileged pre-release access is limited, controlled and publicised. In the event that leaks occur, pre-release arrangements are revised so as to ensure impartiality.\n\nStatistical releases and statements made in press conferences are objective and non-partisan.\n\nSpecial press briefings are held to announce and explain major new statistical releases."
