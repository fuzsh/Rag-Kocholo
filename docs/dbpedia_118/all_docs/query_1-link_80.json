        "text": "Application of Statistics in Daily Life\n\nDiscovery Project\n\nWatch the weather forecast today? What statistics are given in the forecast? Is there a chance of rain or snow given in the forecast? Does the weather person tell what the average temperature is for the day? These are all statistics or based on statistics. What is the forecast for the next week? This is all based on statistics and what is called inferential statistics, statistics used to predict values. Make a list of all the statistics you hear or see from the weather forecast.\n\nResearch Project\n\nUse an Internet search engine to research the concepts of mean, median, and mode. During your research, determine when and why each of these is used. Is one of these used more frequently than others? Which do you think is the easiest to calculate? Now let's apply it. Suppose you have a gerbil that ate 10 food pellets on Sunday, 12 on Monday, 9 on Tuesday, and 10 on Wednesday. You would like to approximate how many pellets the gerbil will eat on Thursday. Would you use the mean, median, or mode to decide? Why did you pick this method?\n\nDiscussion Question\n\nEconomists often use a median to describe housing prices or wages in an area. For example, the median wage in Bigtown is $50,000 meaning half the people in Bigtown earn less than $50,000 and half of the people earn more than $50,000. Why do you think that the median is used? Why is the mean not used? Why is the mode not used?\n\nStatistics is often seen as the domain of big business, especially in the age of the internet, big data, and machine learning algorithms. Statistics helps us gauge uncertainty and make plans when given incomplete information by collecting a sample of information and deriving further information from that data.\n\nA screenshot of Google search results.\n\nThe application of statistics is done on large scales with massive budgets and strict adherence to the scientific method and can be found across all industries, government organizations, and academia. Education administrators, governmental offices and officials, business leaders and marketing departments, and scientific researchers all use statistical methods and processes during their work.\n\nBut it can also be applied to the real world and day-to-day activities of people going about their daily lives, too. Every day, people are confronted with incomplete information and try to figure things out based on that information. It could be what route to take to work, how much to charge for a product they're selling, how long a certain activity will take, or how much they should pay for something in a store or online.\n\nOnce they've decided on what they are trying to find out and how they will discover that information, steps are taken to collect and organize the data in a structure that can be examined more easily and interpreted to conclude what has been found. They might even use this data and their conclusions to convince others of their position on the topic.\n\nSo, what are statistics used for in everyday life and in people's careers, and what are some examples of its use? It helps to understand the process behind the statistical process and some definitions of important concepts in the field first.\n\nPlanning a Study\n\nThe first step in any statistical examination is asking a question like, \"What time should I leave for work in order to minimize my travel time?\" This is the most important part, as knowing what needs to be discovered informs all other parts of the statistical process. Once the question is known, the researcher needs to plan the steps they will take to collect their data and what tools will be best used for the process.\n\nOrganizing the Data\n\nOrganizing data might be as simple as noting values down on a piece of paper for less formal types of statistical analysis. However, in large organizations or when working with large data sets, the software is used to manipulate and structure the data somehow, whether simple spreadsheet software or complicated mathematical algorithms developed for niche purposes in various industries.\n\nInterpreting the Data\n\nOnce data has been collected and organized, interpretations need to be made based on the data. Is it the best day to have a sale on a weekend when traffic is already high or is it on a weekday to encourage people to visit a business during slower times?\n\nPresenting the Data\n\nFinally, the ways in which data and findings based on data are presented have a massive effect on how people feel about the interpretations. In many academic fields, findings are presented dry and formal. Still, the marketing department of a business might develop flashy infographics to persuade more people of their arguments.\n\nMean, Median, and Mode\n\nMeans, medians, and modes are everywhere in statistics and are the fundamental pieces of information derived from data that help inform researchers of the structure of the data itself. Consider the following table of values:\n\nObservation Value 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 5 5 8 6 11 7 14\n\nThe mean is the average of the data's values, calculated by taking the sum of all the values and dividing by the total number of observations. From the data in the table, the total of the values is 46 and dividing that by 7 gives a mean (or average) of 6.57.\n\nThe median is whatever value is represented by the center-most piece of data when the data has been ordered in some way. The data in the table are ordered in ascending order, and the center-most observation is the 4th value, so the median is 5. In data sets with even numbers of observations, the average of the central observations is used.\n\nThe mode is whatever value occurs most often in a set of data. The most common observation in the table, with two total observations, is 3. The mode of this data set is 3.\n\nThe larger the collection of data, the more reliable it is to conclude it. A sample of five people out of a hundred might give a hint of a trend in the total population, but it would be much less reliable to make a statement about that population using that data than if the total number of people sampled was fifty.\n\nDefinition of Statistics\n\nTimmy is a pizza shop manager and he has two locations picked for a possible new location. He decides to conduct a mini-study to decide based on a variety of factors. Location A is smaller, and he notices that there is a high school two blocks away, some business offices close by, and a laundromat next door. Location B is larger and next to a supermarket with some business offices scattered around the area, amidst several vacant lots. If you were Timmy, which would you choose?\n\nYou are a statistician in many ways. Statistics is the method of conducting a study about a particular topic by collecting, organizing, interpreting, and finally presenting data. Being a statistician at an elementary level may simply mean noticing patterns in daily circumstances and drawing conclusions about those patterns. On a grander scale, statisticians may spend months or years conducting a study before they can produce meaningful analysis of information. Statistics is its own community, with rules, procedures, and policies all built on simple mathematical principles.\n\nStages in the Statistical Process\n\nThe statistical process guides genuine study, and statisticians are exacting in their methodologies. The major steps of statistics are explained in a simplistic form as follows:\n\nPlanning a study: There must be a subject that requires investigation. Planning entails deciding what instruments (interviews, surveys, etc.) to use, who to speak with, and how to analyze findings. Instruments, in this case, are tools used in conducting a study like surveys, interviews, etc. Do you remember Timmy? In this stage, he plans to interview shoppers and count people.\n\nOrganizing the data: The best way to obtain the valid answers is to organize the information effectively to help expose patterns and other significant relationships. There are a variety of software programs that can help with this step. Once Timmy has gathered data, he could perform calculations of the mean, mode, and median visitors.\n\nInterpreting the data: This is the heartbeat of statistics. Interpretations can have lasting repercussions, and it's important to make sure they are valid assumptions and supported by mathematical reasoning. Timmy, based on his interpretations of the numbers, could make plans to have special sales on days with the most traffic.\n\nPresenting the data: The methods you chose to present the data can make findings more interesting or powerful. People use graphs, tables, and various diagrams to show relationships between data. With this information, Timmy could present compelling arguments using his analysis so that he and his business partners can discuss the most profitable possibilities for the pizza shop.\n\nApplications of Statistics\n\nOther than individuals and small businesses owners like Timmy who conducted their own studies, there are some entities who thrive on statistics. Here are a few major examples.\n\nGovernment Agencies\n\nThe government uses statistics to make decisions about populations, health, education, etc. It may conduct research on education to check the progress of high schools students using a specific curriculum or collect characteristic information about the population using a census.\n\nScience and Medicine\n\nThe medical field would be far less effective without research to see which medicines or interventions work best and how the human bodies react to treatment. Medical professionals also perform studies by race, age, or nationality to see the effect of these characteristics on health.\n\nPsychology\n\nAlthough this is attached to both the science and medical field, success in psychology would be impossible without the systematic study of human behavior, often analyzing results statistically.\n\nEducation\n\nTeachers are encouraged to be researchers in their classrooms, to see what teaching methods work on which students and understand why. They also should evaluate test items to determine if students are performing in a statistically expected way. At all levels of education and testing there are statistical reports about student performance, from kindergarten to an SAT or GRE.\n\nLarge Companies\n\nEvery large company employs its own statistical research divisions or firms to research issues related to products, employees, customer service, etc. Business success relies on knowing what is working and what isn't.\n\nThree Major Statistical Measures\n\nIn many cases, basic statistical analysis can be done by using three main concepts: the mean, the median, and the mode.\n\nMean\n\nThe mean is the mathematical average. For example, a laundromat may conduct a study to see how many people use a machine each day, then calculate the average for each week.\n\nSun: 105\n\nMon: 50\n\nTues: 40\n\nWed: 50\n\nThurs: 70\n\nFri: 80\n\nSat: 95\n\nThe mean is the sum of the items divided by the number of items. In this case, we have seven items, so: mean = (105 + 50 + 40 + 50 + 70 + 80 + 95) / 7 = 70 people\n\nMode\n\nThe mode is the number that occurs most frequently in the data set. If we first organize the data in ascending order we get: 40, 50, 50, 70, 80, 95, 105. You can see 50 is the mode because it occurs twice while every other number occurs just once."
