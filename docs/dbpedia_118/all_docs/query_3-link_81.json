These programs are part of our larger quality strategy to reform how health care is delivered and paid for. Value-based programs also support our three-part aim:\n\nBetter care for individuals\n\nBetter health for populations\n\nLower cost\n\nWhy are value-based programs important?\n\nOur value-based programs are important because they’re helping us move toward paying providers based on the quality, rather than the quantity of care they give patients.\n\nWhat are CMS’ original value-based programs?\n\nThere are 5 original value-based programs; their goal is to link provider performance of quality measures to provider payment:\n\nEnd-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program (ESRD QIP)\n\nHospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program\n\nHospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP)\n\nValue Modifier (VM) Program (also called the Physician Value-Based Modifier or PVBM)\n\nHospital Acquired Conditions (HAC) Reduction Program\n\nAre there other value-based programs?\n\nThere are other value-based programs:\n\nSkilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNFVBP)\n\nHome Health Value Based Purchasing (HHVBP)\n\nWhat's the timeline for these programs?\n\nHow do value-based programs work with other CMS quality efforts?"
