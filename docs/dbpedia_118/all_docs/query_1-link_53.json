Prospective elective students who have taken one of the standard prerequisites should simply register for STAT0013 on Portico and await a decision. Prospective elective students who do not satisfy the standard prerequisiters must additionally consult a member of staff in the Department of Statistical Science.\n\nConsultation request form\n\nPostgraduates\n\nSTAT0013 is specified as a formal option within the MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning programme. Students from this programme should simply register for STAT0013 on Portico and await a decision. It is not necessary to register separately with a member of staff in the Department of Statistical Science (successful admission to the programme already demonstrates that the prerequisites can be met).\n\nSTAT0013 is also offered as an elective. All potential elective students must consult a member of staff in the Department of Statistical Science, who will confirm whether they have the necessary prerequisites.\n\nConsultation request form"
