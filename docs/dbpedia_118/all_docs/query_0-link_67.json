        "text": "Admissions to this program have been suspended indefinitely.\n\nThe MS in Statistics has been developed for students interested in becoming practitioners of statistics, who are trained in statistical methodology. The program emphasizes the foundations and concepts of statistics as well as the new and developing areas of statistics. Though the applications of statistical sciences are emphasized, the theoretical foundations are presented as well. Specifically, students are prepared for professional work in the design and analysis of statistical experiments, development and analysis of statistical models, data analytic techniques and the associated computational methods, and statistical computing.\n\nThrough the accessibility of computers and the availability of powerful statistical software to analyze huge data sets, the use of statistical methods has now become quite widespread in many industries. Students and faculty in the department have access to state-of-the-art interactive computing environments for data analysis and data graphics. This program also offers MS students the opportunity to obtain applied experience by becoming involved in the data collection, analysis and interpretation of ongoing projects. In addition, our proximity to the pharmaceutical industry permits students the exciting option of an applied industrial experience, working under the supervision of a practicing statistician.\n\nAlong with the Statistics (BS in Mathematics – Finance and MS in Statistics) degree, the department also offers the following options for graduate study: Statistics (MS), and Statistics (Combined BS/MS)."
