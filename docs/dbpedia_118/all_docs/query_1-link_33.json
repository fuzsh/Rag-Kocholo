        "text": "A finance major may seem like a natural choice if you love working with numbers and money. Yet, finance graduates do so much more. They provide valuable services to corporations, small businesses, non-profits, and individuals to help them manage a critical resource. Before you start advising people about where to invest their money and creating financial forecasts, you probably need a degree. Choosing finance as a major could be a good place to start.\n\nWhat is a finance major?\n\nThe term \"finance\" refers to the management of money. When you major in finance, you'll generally explore topics like financial planning, banking, and investing, all while developing valuable job skills like problem-solving and communication.\n\nIn a finance major degree program, you study financial theories and how they apply in the business world to help companies and individuals make and manage money. You practice using mathematical concepts, statistics, and analytical tools to solve problems and make decisions. With a finance degree, you can prepare for a career as a financial planner, financial analyst, commercial banker, investment manager, and more.\n\nFinance major degree coursework\n\nAs a finance major, you study finance-related topics, including math, economics, and statistics. You can expect to take several math classes like accounting, calculus, and business math. These courses establish a foundation for finance courses that cover valuation, investing, international banking and finance, econometrics, and buyouts and acquisitions. You may see the following courses in your school's curriculum:\n\nAnalysis of Financial Statement Presentation\n\nBanking, Financial Institutions, and Society\n\nBusiness and Economic Forecasting\n\nFederal Taxation for Businesses\n\nFinancial Management of the Firm\n\nFinancial Modeling\n\nFundamentals of Business Statistics\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nOrganizational Behavior\n\nPrinciples of Macroeconomics\n\nPrinciples of Microeconomics\n\nStatistical Methods in Business\n\nVenture Capital and Private Equity\n\nIf you're an undergraduate finance major, you will likely spend the first two years of your degree program taking general education courses. Social science, literature, and humanities courses can introduce you to new perspectives and build a broad knowledge base. You may use the skills you learn in composition and public speaking courses throughout your career.Â Â\n\nIn your junior and senior years, you typically spend more time taking courses related to your major. This is when you delve into topics like finance and management principles, business law and ethics, corporate valuation, and urban fiscal policy. During your final two years, you may have opportunities to study areas of interest such as real estate development, entrepreneurial finance, hedge fund management, and fintech.\n\nIf you're a finance major in a master's program, your courses tend to cover more advanced topics than what's available at the undergraduate level. The concepts tend to be similar, but you have more time to devote to them. You may spend an entire semester examining behavioral finance, business tax laws, bond markets, derivatives markets, portfolio management, venture capital, and more.\n\nIs finance a good major?\n\nPeople who choose to major in finance are interested in numbers, financial markets, and finding ways to make money. They tend to be natural problem-solvers who like setting goals and researching ways to reach them.Â\n\nThrough your coursework, you can build on and expand these skills as you learn how markets work, how to value a business, and how to consider the implications of money-related decisions.Â\n\nWith a finance degree, you can choose to work in several fields where you can help other people and businesses create plans that help them achieve their goals. The work is not only financially rewarding but also can give you the satisfaction of knowing you helped someone solve a problem or make a dream come true.\n\nYou also may find a finance degree practical if you plan to pursue additional education or work in business, law, or a related field. Many finance majors earn professional certifications like Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). In doing so, you can expand your skill set and create additional career opportunities.\n\nRead more: What Should I Major In? 5 Things to Evaluate\n\nFinance major salaries: How much can I earn?\n\nThe job market for a finance major is favorable, with average growth expected in the sector through 2030.
