        "text": "Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation Guide, a companion to the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000), describes the economic sectorization, valuation, and other accounting rules used in compiling data on the financial assets and liabilities of the financial corporations sector (monetary statistics) and all economic sectors (financial statistics) of an economy. The Guide is intended to assist countries in compiling such data according to current best practices; it contributes to the IMF's ongoing initiatives to enhance data transparency and statistical standards among its member countries, and thus to further the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies and the smooth functioning of global financial markets."
