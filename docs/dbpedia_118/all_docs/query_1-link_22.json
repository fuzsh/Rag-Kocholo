        "text": "There are many reasons a business uses statistics in its practice. The first reason is that in the use of statistics, the business will have to track and understand its numbers and information. The collection and organization of this data will be a good opportunity for the business owner to understand the performance of the business.\n\nOther than the act of collecting and arranging data help, statistics show how customers react to the products or services a business provides. It is important for a business to understand how they are profiting and how customers are interacting with their products or services alongside different marketing tactics the company is using. This is important for a business as a good use of these statistical tools will allow it to make the necessary changes in the business in order to increase revenue and profit.\n\nAnother reason for using statistical tools will be for the company to identify trends in itself or with regard to the industry it is in as a whole. For example, if a business recorded lower profit in certain months in a year, it can adjust its cost and inventory during those times so as to minimize the cost of keeping stock and transporting those stock from warehouse to storefronts. The company may also look at the trend and decides to develop marketing strategies that focus on those slower sales months in order to improve the profitability of the business in those times.\n\nLast but not least, another reason can be for the business to make a prediction about the future according to the trend it observes from the data. While there are different possibilities in the future and it is difficult to have certainty, analyzing existing data can give the company a sense of what may happen in the future and the possibility of those events happening which may be beneficial or challenging. With that knowledge in mind, the company can make adjustments if needed or have contingency plans ready should those unfavorable events happen.\n\nThere are more reasons for a business to use statistical analysis tools. The most important aspect is how the competition in industries is fierce and the more data and knowledge a company can get, the higher chance it can stay in business and profit in the long term.\n\nUse of Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics, as its name implied, is used to describe a dataset. In business, descriptive statistics can be used to help the business to understand how its customers behave and react to the products or services it provides. There are a few commonly looked at statistical points, which are:\n\nmean: the average\n\nmode: the most frequent data point\n\nmedian: the data point that is in the middle of the range\n\nExample of Descriptive Statistics Application\n\nA software company may look at the mean spending of customers on their apps, the mode of what items the customers are buying, and the median spending per customer. While this may seem overlapping at a glance, these three numbers can each show a different facet of the business.\n\nFrom the mean spending, the company can look to increase the value of their offering so that they may be able to convince customers to buy more and thus increasing their revenue.\n\nFor mode, the company can understand what function is most appreciated by its user and consider promoting that feature to even more customers or develop new features that will amplify what the customers are already liking.\n\nFrom the median, the company can understand the spending habit of their customers. For example, if the median is a lot lower than the mean, it may imply that most of its customers are spending little while a smaller selection in the customer base is spending the bulk of their money. This may lead to the company investing in developing features that customers with a lower budget can also enjoy and contribute to the revenue.\n\nUse of Inferential Statistics\n\nInferential statistics helps the business in drawing conclusions from a set of data and making predictions or estimations based on that set of data. Six sigma is a common term in business statistics that refers to a process that attempts to maximize profit and through analysis, the company will result in no more than 3.4 defects out of a million.\n\nAnother tool a business can use will be a statistic model, which is a representation of the data it used in the analysis and will reflect what is likely to happen. Probability is one of the features used to express the predictions from the statistic model as it is impossible to be absolutely accurate in predicting future events. An example of using probability is, if the business plan on investing in a new storefront, the statistic model will take into account different costs the company will have to pay for the initial startup cost, then it will include the potential of turning a profit in a designated time period. With the result, the business can decide on whether to go forward with the plan.\n\nA control chart is also a common tool. It is a graphical representation of how different process in the business is going and the resulting quality from those processes. By constructing and observing a control chart, the business can identify potential problems that cause a lower quality in their service or products and predict variances.\n\nWhat Is Business Statistics?\n\nBusiness statistics is a specialty area of statistics which are applied in the business setting. It can be used for quality assurance, financial analysis, production and operations, and many other business areas. Just as in general statistics, there are two categories: descriptive and inferential. Descriptive statistics are used to describe the total group of numbers. Inferential statistics infers relationships from the population of numbers.\n\nUse of Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe total numbers. Looking at statistical numbers such as mean, or the average number, mode, or the most frequent number, or median, or the middle number, helps managers monitor business activities and make decisions. Often numbers themselves do not show the big picture, so ratios, or numbers representing relationships are used.\n\nPerhaps you're a regional manager who oversees 15 different car dealerships. You will keep track of sales per month, number of vehicles sold, number of salesmen, sales per person, operational costs, delivery times, and other information. You use this statistical information to look at trends, understand relationships between numbers, and make sound business decisions. Perhaps you need to shift a sales member to a different store, or realize that you need more available stock during certain months, all of which helps maximize the company's resources and profit.\n\nOr, perhaps, you're a regional store manager and are concerned about how long customers have to wait to check out. Currently, customers queue in multiple lines with a single cashier. You measure the mean length of time for customers to complete their transaction for a month. Then the next month, you line up customers in a single line with multiple cashiers and measure the mean length of time for the transaction. You notice that even though customers take longer to walk to the next available cashier, the overall transactions are reported faster. When the company expands and builds the next store, you specifically request it to be designed with one queuing line, using your findings to substantiate the request.\n\nUse of Inferential Statistics\n\nInferential statistics help managers draw conclusions based on limited data. When predicting the future, we don't have a magic crystal ball, but we do have statistical strategies, such as sampling, probability, and models.\n\nMarketing departments often use inferential statistics. A company might issue a survey and ask questions about their products. However, it's impossible to survey every individual customer. The marketing department will determine the appropriate sample size, or the number of people to ask. Based on the results, statisticians can infer the responses are representative of the larger group of customers.\n\nFinance departments use statistical modeling for predicting budgets and capital expenditures, when there are many unknown factors. A statistical model is a representation of what will probably happen. Unfortunately, economists can't predict everything so they use probability. Probability is simply the likelihood of something happening.\n\nFor example, let's say a company is taking out a loan for construction of a plant expecting it to be operational in 3 years. They are relying on the income from the plant to repay the loan. The finance team will run a statistical model that will include any possible delays, changes to building regulations, and catastrophic events. It's best to be prepared so it doesn't bankrupt the company if something goes wrong."
