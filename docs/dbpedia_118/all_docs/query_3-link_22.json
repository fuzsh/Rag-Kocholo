        "text": "Investment Industry Career Paths\n\nIf you are a college student or a job seeker looking for a varied career that allows you to work with people and in which you can make a positive social change, a finance career might be for you. Within the financial system, there are many people-facing roles that provide services to facilitate successful saving and investing for both individuals and companies. Explore below to get familiar with finance industry and investment management jobs.\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nFunctional cookies, which are necessary for basic site functionality like keeping you logged in, are always enabled.\n\nAllow analytics tracking. Analytics help us understand how the site is used, and which pages are the most popular. Read the Privacy Policy to learn how this information is used.\n\nStructure of the Financial System\n\nLet’s take a broad look at how the financial system is set up and why so many financial services jobs exist to support saving and spending activities.\n\nThe financial system helps link savers, including individuals, companies, and governments who have money to invest with spenders who need money to achieve a variety of goals\n\nMost often, investors cannot analyze, plan, and execute all saving and spending activities on their own, so intermediaries (i.e., financial services professionals) are needed to support these activities either directly or indirectly.\n\nWithin the financial system, the investment management industry offers a range of products and services to savers and spenders to channel funds between them. Investments can be made in a wide range of assets, including real assets (e.g., land, buildings, machinery, cattle, gold, forests, etc.) and financial instruments (e.g. shares, debt securities, mutual funds, etc.)\n\nFinancial services intermediaries can also play an important role in the areas of corporate management and strategy, such as planning mergers and acquisitions or assisting with capital raising for startups; they can be key in minimizing risk for institutions across many organizations, from hedge funds to commercial banks; and they can be advocates for ethics and compliance with laws and regulations in their clients' industries.\n\nJobs in Finance: Types of Career Opportunities\n\nTo find out if finance is a good career path for you and what a typical finance career path looks like in the investment management industry, visit our finance professionals job description pages:\n\nQuantitative & Analytical Roles\n\nData Scientist\n\nData Analyst\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nRisk Analyst & Manager\n\nForex Currency Traders\n\nClient-Facing Roles\n\nFinancial Analyst\n\nPrivate Wealth Manager\n\nInvestment Consultant\n\nTransaction-Focused Roles\n\nInvestment Banker\n\nInvestment Strategist\n\nStockbroker\n\nSales & Trading\n\nPortfolio Manager\n\nPrivate Equity Associate\n\nChief Investment Officer\n\nBuy-Side vs. Sell-Side Jobs: What's the Difference?\n\nYou may be familiar with the descriptors \"buy side\" or \"sell side\" to describe investment firms. Knowing the difference between these two groups may help you to narrow your financial career search to jobs that fit your interests.\n\nBuy Side\n\nThe buy side is comprised of institutional investors that seek to deploy capital into a wide variety of assets, such as equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), real estate, infrastructure, etc. Using the language of \"savers\" and \"spenders\", this side deals more with the savers, including both retail investors (individuals) and institutional investors (pension plans, endowment funds, foundations, etc.).\n\nSell Side\n\nThe sell-side is the part of the industry that is involved with the creation and sale of securities, primarily providing investment products and services. The sell side works for the companies they represent (e.g., an investment banker advising a company) and the investors they serve (e.g., a trader transacting on behalf of another investor). The major institutions on this side of the street are generally big banks.\n\nThe buy-side/sell-side classification does not apply to all firms in the investment industry. In addition, the buy-side/sell-side classification is somewhat arbitrary and not easily applied to many large, integrated firms. For example, many investment banks have divisions or wholly owned subsidiaries that provide investment management services, which are buy side. These functions are on the buy side, even though investment banks are sell-side firms.\n\nFront, Middle, and Back of Office Roles\n\nAnother set of terms you may encounter in financial job descriptions is \"front office\", \"middle office\" or \"back office\". These terms are used to roughly group the major activities that happen within sell-side firms. The terms front office, middle office, and back office are generally not used when describing buy-side firms. However, the main departments of buy-side investment management firms are similar to those of sell-side firms. These departments include sales and client relations, investment research and portfolio management, trading, compliance, accounting, and administration.\n\nFront Office Middle Office Back Office\n\nFinancial Education: Majors & Degrees\n\nMost financial services jobs will, at a minimum, require a four-year degree (in the United States) or the international equivalent to a bachelor's degree. Hiring managers often prefer to recruit entry-level employees who have graduated with a degree in finance or a major in a related field such as accounting, business management or economics. In mid-to-senior level employees they often look for those who have previous career experience making financial decisions or giving financial advice. An advanced degree such as an MBA or professional development certifications such as the CFA charter and CPIM Certification are typically helpful for those who already work in financial services and are looking to improve their career opportunities.\n\nHow to Break into Finance from an Unrelated Field\n\nMaking a career change from an unrelated field to a finance job is not impossible, but you will need to familiarize yourself with the finance industry and financial regulations to improve your chances of success when applying. Whether you aim to work in an investment bank, commercial bank, hedge fund, investment firm, or in the finance department of an organization, you'll need to understand how financial markets work.\n\nInnovation in financial technologies (fintech) such as AI, machine learning, and blockchain development has increased the need for data experts and programmers.\n\nFinance Skills: Are My Talents a Good Fit?\n\nThe following skills are commonly transferrable across most finance roles, regardless of their buy side vs. sell side designation or where they might sit in a front, middle, or back office schematic.\n\nInterpersonal communication\n\nAttention to detail\n\nTeamwork and relationship building\n\nAnalytical competency and critical thinking\n\nKnowledge of global current events\n\nUnderstanding of the financial system\n\nUse the table below to see common financial, communication, and analytical skill sets that are more particular to the job divisions we outlined above:\n\nQuantitative & Analytical Job Skills\n\nMathematical Skills\n\nStatistical inference\n\nForecasting\n\nFinancial modeling\n\nFinancial risk analysis\n\nValuation\n\nProgramming Skills\n\nPython programming\n\nR programming\n\nData visualization\n\nSQL querying\n\nDatabase architecture\n\nMachine learning techniques\n\nCommunication Skills\n\nProject management capabilities\n\nCross-functional teamwork\n\nWorkflow process management\n\nExplaining complex concepts to a non-expert audience\n\nClient-Facing Job Skills\n\nFinancial Knowledge\n\nInvestment strategy & processes\n\nPerformance measurement & risk management\n\nFamiliarity with financial analysis tools\n\nCommunication Skills\n\nPublic speaking\n\nUsing data to tell a story\n\nPersuasion\n\nNegotiation\n\nEmotional intelligence\n\nBusiness Knowledge\n\nExpertise in client's sector\n\nAwareness of regulatory environment\n\nCommitment to ethical best practices\n\nTransaction-Focused Job Skills\n\nFinancial Transaction Knowledge\n\nUnderstanding of markets & exchanges\n\nPortfolio management & execution\n\nKnowledge of asset classes & investment vehicles\n\nPersonality Traits\n\nEntrepreneurial mindset with enthusiasm for driving profit\n\nWillingness to work hours that correlate to global market openings & closings\n\nComfort working in fast-paced environments\n\nOther Key Skills\n\nAnalytical & problem-solving skills\n\nProject management\n\nInterpersonal skills\n\nMeticulous recordkeeping\n\nHow Can the CFA Program Help You?\n\nThe CFA® Program curriculum is designed to provide you with the expertise and real-world skills in investment analysis that will help you begin or advance your career in finance.
