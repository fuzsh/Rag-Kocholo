        "text": "What Financial Managers Do About this section\n\nFinancial managers are responsible for the financial health of an organization. They create financial reports, direct investment activities, and develop plans for the long-term financial goals of their organization.\n\nDuties\n\nFinancial managers typically do the following:\n\nPrepare financial statements, business activity reports, and forecasts\n\nMonitor financial details to ensure that legal requirements are met\n\nSupervise employees who do financial reporting and budgeting\n\nReview financial reports and seek ways to reduce costs\n\nAnalyze market trends to maximize profits and find expansion opportunities\n\nHelp management make financial decisions\n\nFinancial managers spend much of their time analyzing data and advising senior managers on ways to maximize profits. They often work on teams, acting as advisors to top executives.\n\nFinancial managers must have knowledge of the topics, tax laws, and regulations that are specific to their organization or industry. For example, government financial managers must be experts on appropriations and budgeting processes; healthcare financial managers must understand billing, reimbursement, and other business matters related to healthcare.\n\nThe following are examples of types of financial managers:\n\nControllers direct the preparation of financial reports that summarize and forecast an organization’s financial position. These reports may include income statements, balance sheets, and analyses of future earnings or expenses. Controllers also are in charge of preparing reports required by governmental agencies that regulate businesses. Often, controllers oversee the accounting, audit, and budget departments of their organization.\n\nTreasurers and finance officers direct an organization’s budgets to meet its financial goals. They oversee investments and other plans to raise capital, such as issuing stocks or bonds, to support their organization’s growth. They also develop financial plans for mergers (two companies joining together) and acquisitions (one company buying another).\n\nCredit managers oversee an organization’s credit business. They set credit-rating standards, determine credit limits, and monitor the collections of past-due accounts.\n\nCash managers monitor and control the flow of money into and out of an organization to meet business and investment needs. For example, they must project whether the organization will have a shortage or surplus of cash.\n\nRisk managers use strategies to limit or offset an organization’s chance of financial loss or exposure to financial uncertainty. Among the risks they try to limit are those arising from currency or commodity price changes.\n\nInsurance managers decide how to limit an organization’s losses by protecting against risks, such as for disability payments to an employee who gets hurt on the job or for costs imposed by a lawsuit against the organization.\n\nHow to Become a Financial Manager About this section\n\nFinancial managers typically need a bachelor’s degree and 5 years or more of experience in another business or financial occupation, such as an accountant, securities sales agent, or financial analyst.\n\nEducation\n\nFinancial managers typically need at least a bachelor's degree in business, economics, or a related field. These disciplines help students learn analytical skills and methods.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nAlthough it is not required, professional certification indicates competence for financial managers who have it. The Association of Government Accountants (AGA) offers the Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM) designation to financial managers working with federal, state, or local government. To earn this certification, candidates must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, pass examinations, and have professional-level experience in government financial management. To keep the certification, CGFMs must complete continuing professional education.\n\nThe CFA Institute confers the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification to investment professionals who have at least a bachelor’s degree or 4 years of work experience, or a combination of experience and education, and who pass three exams. The Association for Financial Professionals confers the Certified Treasury Professional (CTP) credential to those who have at least 2 years of relevant experience or 1 year of experience and a graduate degree in business, finance, or a related field. This association also confers the Certified Corporate Financial Planning Analysis Professional (FP&A) credential to those who have a bachelor’s degree or who are currently enrolled in an undergraduate program with a finance-related major and will graduate within 2 years. Both credentials require passing an exam.\n\nCertified public accountants (CPAs) are licensed by their state’s board of accountancy and must pass an exam administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\n\nWork Experience in a Related Occupation\n\nFinancial managers usually have experience in another business or financial occupation. For example, they may have worked as a loan officer, accountant, securities sales agent, or financial analyst.\n\nIn some cases, companies provide management training to help prepare motivated, skilled financial workers to become managers.\n\nAdvancement\n\nExperienced financial managers may advance to become chief financial officers (CFOs). These executives are responsible for the accuracy of an organization’s financial reporting.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nAnalytical skills. To assist executives in making decisions, financial managers need to evaluate data and information that affects their organization.\n\nCommunication skills. Financial managers must be able to explain and justify complex financial transactions.\n\nDetail oriented. In preparing and analyzing reports, such as balance sheets and income statements, financial managers must be precise and attentive to their work in order to avoid errors.\n\nMath skills. Financial managers need strong skills in certain branches of mathematics, including algebra. Ability to understand international finance and complex financial documents also is important.\n\nOrganizational skills. Because financial managers deal with a range of information and documents, they must have structures in place to be effective in their work.\n\nJob Outlook About this section\n\nFinancial Managers\n\nPercent change in employment, projected 2022-32\n\nFinancial managers\n\n16%\n\nOperations specialties managers\n\n11%\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n3%\n\nEmployment of financial managers is projected to grow 16 percent from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nAbout 69,600 openings for financial managers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nEmployment\n\nServices provided by financial managers, such as planning, directing, and coordinating investments, are likely to stay in demand as the economy grows. In addition, several specialties within financial management, particularly cash management and risk management, are expected to be in high demand over the decade.\n\nCompanies, particularly those with operations in foreign countries, have accumulated more cash on their balance sheets in recent years. As globalization continues, this trend is likely to persist. This practice should lead to demand for financial managers, as companies will need expertise in managing cash.\n\nThere has been an increased emphasis on risk management within the financial industry, and this trend is expected to continue. Banking institutions are expected to emphasize stability and managing risk over profits. This emphasis is expected to lead to employment growth for risk managers.\n\nEmployment projections data for financial managers, 2022-32 Occupational Title SOC Code Employment, 2022 Projected Employment, 2032 Change, 2022-32 Employment by Industry Percent Numeric\n\nFinancial managers\n\n11-3031 792,600 919,200 16 126,600 Get data\n\nState & Area Data About this section\n\nOccupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.
