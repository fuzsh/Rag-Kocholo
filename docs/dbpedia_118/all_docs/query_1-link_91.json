        "text": "2024 Digital Financial Inclusion Statistics Report\n\nFintech innovations are a game-changer for financial inclusion in America. Traditional banking can be inaccessible and costly for many people, particularly people from minority groups.\n\nFintech experts at Tipalti share their insights on the unbanked population rates in America and how fintech innovations contribute to improving financial inclusion.\n\nAs many will know, having access to financial services from banks and credit unions can be crucial to achieving financial stability. Although most adults have a bank account and can obtain credit in the US, some still don’t have access to financial services, especially those among particular demographics.\n\nIn this article, we take a closer look at financial inclusion, covering financial inclusion statistics, the definition, key benefits, and financial inclusion technology you can count on for embracing digital technology and inclusive practices.\n\nUnbanked Rate by Demographics\n\nIn 2022, 6% of adults were ‘unbanked,’ meaning that they do not have access to traditional banking services, such as savings or checking accounts. Those without bank accounts often rely on more expensive and less secure alternative financial services like check cashing and payday loans. This remains unchanged from 2021.\n\nUnbanked Rate by Family Income\n\nResearch suggests that unbanked rates are particularly high among adults from low-income backgrounds. Last year, up to 17% of adults with an annual income of less than $25,000 were unbanked. This is significantly higher when compared to the 1% of adults with an income of between $50,000 and $99,999.\n\nUnbanked Rate by Age\n\nYoung adults have the highest unbanked rate, with 10% of people within this age group lacking access to traditional banking services. 8% of individuals aged 30 to 44 also have a relatively high unbanked rate, while those aged 60+ have the highest level of bank account ownership.\n\nUnbanked Rate by Race\n\nIn 2022, unbanked rates were higher among Black (13%) and Hispanic (10%) adults. Interestingly, although traditional payment and credit methods were lower among these ethnicities, they tended to use relatively new financial services more, such as cryptocurrency for transactions and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL).\n\nUnbanked Rate by Disability Status\n\nRegarding disability status, unbanked rates tended to be higher among those with a disability. In fact, adults with disabilities (10%) are twice as likely not to have access to traditional banking services compared to adults without a disability (5%).\n\nNonbank Check Cashing and Money Orders\n\nAccording to statistics, 12% of adults used nonbank check cashing or money orders in 2022. Though this remains unchanged in the last couple of years, there has been a 3% decrease from 2019.\n\nDespite both banked and unbanked adults using nonbank providers to conduct financial transactions, there was a much higher rate among unbanked adults.\n\nWhile only 12% of banked adults used a nonbank money order or check cashing service, 31% of unbanked adults also did the same. The use of nonbank money orders and check cashing has fallen by 16% among unbanked adults since 2019.\n\nMethodology Used\n\nUsing data from the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022, we analyzed the Banking and Credit section statistics, particularly looking at bank account ownership, the unbanked rates among different demographic groups, and the use of nonbank check cashing and money orders among banked and unbanked adults. We specifically looked at Table 16 and Figure 22.\n\nWhat is Digital Financial Inclusion?\n\nDigital financial inclusion refers to the process of ensuring those in underserved or financially marginalized communities (unbanked populations) have access to affordable financial services and products (through digital means). The idea is rooted in the concept that everyone should have access to financial services, regardless of economic status, location, or access to a traditional banking infrastructure.\n\nThese services can include (but are not limited to):\n\nBanking\n\nPayments\n\nSavings\n\nCredit\n\nInsurance\n\nInvestments\n\nFinancial inclusion is particularly popular in struggling economies and developing countries (like parts of Asia and Africa).\n\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic increased global digital adoption, as people sought alternative ways to address daily needs without human contact. Results from the latest Global Findex survey—conducted in 2021 in 123 countries with more than 125,000 respondents, show that the use of digital payments has grown exponentially, as necessity is the master of invention. The digital divide continues to shrink, as telecommunications rise.\n\nSo, what is digital financial inclusion? Key components include:\n\nBenefits of Digital Financial Inclusion\n\nWhen it comes to services for digital financial inclusion, there are a multitude of benefits. Consider these top advantages:\n\nEconomic Growth: Financial inclusion contributes to economic growth by encouraging entrepreneurship, fostering financial stability, and enhancing productivity.\n\nFinancial Empowerment: Individuals are empowered to save, invest, manage, and protect their assets, subsequently improving financial well-being.\n\nReduced Financial Exclusion: Digital services help address financial exclusion by reaching businesses and people in remote or underserved areas, as well as those who cannot access traditional banks or payment systems. This includes developing economies like Bangladesh or Ghana, where money accounts have been hard to come by.\n\nEnhanced Security: Digital transactions often come with enhanced cybersecurity that exceeds formal financial services. This works to reduce the risk of theft, money laundering, and fraud. This is especially the case for those in cash-based economies.\n\nCost Efficiency: Financial inclusion reduces the costs associated with transactions, like traditional banking fees.\n\nData-Driven Insights: DFS generates valuable data that can be used to tailor financial products and services to the specific needs of underserved populations.\n\nDigital financial inclusion is an important aspect of global efforts to reduce poverty, enhance economies, and achieve broader social goals. Organizations like the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), a group of over 30 leading development organizations, work tirelessly to advance the lives of poor people, especially through financial inclusion.\n\nBy leveraging digital technologies and payment services, financial inclusion can bridge the financial divide and promote financial equality for all.\n\nExample of a Digital Financial Service\n\nDigital financial inclusion services are designed to ensure that the unbanked and underserved have access to essential resources through digital means. Some examples of common services include:\n\nHow Automation Bridges the Gap for Financial Inclusion\n\nWhat is one of the smartest ways to address financial access for the underserved? The answer is financial inclusion technology. In fact, automation is finance’s greatest asset and plays a crucial role in bridging the gap for inclusion. Here are a few ways in which automation contributes to financial inclusion:\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion technology makes banking a reality for many underserved populations around the world. The benefits of digital financial inclusion will resound for generations to come, and with the right programs, communities will thrive.\n\nFintech innovations are reshaping the modern financial landscape, both in the United States and globally, making technology more accessible to everyone. By leveraging the right tools, innovations help decrease unbanked rates, encourage communities to manage their finances better, and empower people to improve their financial well-being across the planet."
