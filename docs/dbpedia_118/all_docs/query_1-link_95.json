        "text": "Statistics is a branch of Mathematics, that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and the presentation of the numerical data. In other words, it is defined as the collection of quantitative data. The main purpose of Statistics is to make an accurate conclusion using a limited sample about a greater population.\n\nTypes of Statistics\n\nStatistics can be classified into two different categories. The two different types of Statistics are:\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nInferential Statistics\n\nIn Statistics, descriptive statistics describe the data, whereas inferential statistics help you make predictions from the data. In inferential statistics, the data are taken from the sample and allows you to generalize the population. In general, inference means “guess”, which means making inference about something. So, statistical inference means, making inference about the population. To take a conclusion about the population, it uses various statistical analysis techniques. In this article, one of the types of statistics called inferential statistics is explained in detail. Now, you are going to learn the proper definition of statistical inference, types, solutions, and examples.\n\nAlso, read:\n\nStatistics\n\nCategorical Data\n\nSample Space\n\nPopulation and Sample\n\nSampling Methods\n\nCentral Tendency\n\nStatistical Inference Definition\n\nStatistical inference is the process of analysing the result and making conclusions from data subject to random variation. It is also called inferential statistics. Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are the applications of the statistical inference. Statistical inference is a method of making decisions about the parameters of a population, based on random sampling. It helps to assess the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The purpose of statistical inference to estimate the uncertainty or sample to sample variation. It allows us to provide a probable range of values for the true values of something in the population. The components used for making statistical inference are:\n\nSample Size\n\nVariability in the sample\n\nSize of the observed differences\n\nTypes of Statistical Inference\n\nThere are different types of statistical inferences that are extensively used for making conclusions. They are:\n\nOne sample hypothesis testing\n\nConfidence Interval\n\nPearson Correlation\n\nBi-variate regression\n\nMulti-variate regression\n\nChi-square statistics and contingency table\n\nANOVA or T-test\n\nStatistical Inference Procedure\n\nThe procedure involved in inferential statistics are:\n\nBegin with a theory\n\nCreate a research hypothesis\n\nOperationalize the variables\n\nRecognize the population to which the study results should apply\n\nFormulate a null hypothesis for this population\n\nAccumulate a sample from the population and continue the study\n\nConduct statistical tests to see if the collected sample properties are adequately different from what would be expected under the null hypothesis to be able to reject the null hypothesis\n\nStatistical Inference Solution\n\nStatistical inference solutions produce efficient use of statistical data relating to groups of individuals or trials. It deals with all characters, including the collection, investigation and analysis of data and organizing the collected data. By statistical inference solution, people can acquire knowledge after starting their work in diverse fields. Some statistical inference solution facts are:\n\nIt is a common way to assume that the observed sample is of independent observations from a population type like Poisson or normal\n\nStatistical inference solution is used to evaluate the parameter(s) of the expected model like normal mean or binomial proportion\n\nImportance of Statistical Inference\n\nInferential Statistics is important to examine the data properly. To make an accurate conclusion, proper data analysis is important to interpret the research results. It is majorly used in the future prediction for various observations in different fields. It helps us to make inference about the data. The statistical inference has a wide range of application in different fields, such as:\n\nBusiness Analysis\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nFraud Detection\n\nMachine Learning\n\nShare Market\n\nPharmaceutical Sector\n\nStatistical Inference Examples\n\nAn example of statistical inference is given below.\n\nQuestion: From the shuffled pack of cards, a card is drawn. This trial is repeated for 400 times, and the suits are given below:\n\nSuit Spade Clubs Hearts Diamonds No.of times drawn 90 100 120 90\n\nWhile a card is tried at random, then what is the probability of getting a\n\nDiamond cards\n\nBlack cards\n\nExcept for spade\n\nSolution:\n\nBy statistical inference solution,\n\nTotal number of events = 400\n\ni.e.,90+100+120+90=400\n\n(1) The probability of getting diamond cards:\n\nNumber of trials in which diamond card is drawn = 90\n\nTherefore, P(diamond card) = 90/400 = 0.225\n\n(2) The probability of getting black cards:\n\nNumber of trials in which black card showed up = 90+100 =190\n\nTherefore, P(black card) = 190/400 = 0.475\n\n(3) Except for spade\n\nNumber of trials other than spade showed up = 90+100+120 =310\n\nTherefore, P(except spade) = 310/400 = 0.775\n\nStay tuned with BYJU’S – The Learning App for more Maths-related concepts and download the app for more personalized videos."
