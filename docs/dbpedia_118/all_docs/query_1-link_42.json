        "text": "Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In other words, it is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data. Also, we can say that statistics is a branch of applied mathematics. However, there are two important and basic ideas involved in statistics; they are uncertainty and variation. The uncertainty and variation in different fields can be determined only through statistical analysis. These uncertainties are basically determined by the probability that plays an important role in statistics.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nDefinitions\n\nExamples\n\nBasics of Statistics\n\nWhat is Mathematical Statistics?\n\nTypes of Statistics\n\nFormulas\n\nSummary Statistics\n\nScope\n\nMethods\n\nData in Statistics\n\nTypes of Data\n\nTypes of quantitative data\n\nRepresentation of data\n\nCentral Tendency\n\nDispersion\n\nSkewness\n\nAnova Statistics\n\nDegree of Freedom\n\nApplications\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Statistics?\n\nStatistics is simply defined as the study and manipulation of data. As we have already discussed in the introduction that statistics deals with the analysis and computation of numerical data. Let us see more definitions of statistics given by different authors here.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster dictionary, statistics is defined as “classified facts representing the conditions of a people in a state – especially the facts that can be stated in numbers or any other tabular or classified arrangement”.\n\nAccording to statistician Sir Arthur Lyon Bowley, statistics is defined as “Numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other”.\n\nStatistics – Download PDF\n\nDownload the PDF to get the statistics notes and learn offline too.\n\nClick here to Download Statistics PDF\n\nStatistics Examples\n\nSome of the real-life examples of statistics are:\n\nTo find the mean of the marks obtained by each student in the class whose strength is 50. The average value here is the statistics of the marks obtained.\n\nSuppose you need to find how many members are employed in a city. Since the city is populated with 15 lakh people, hence we will take a survey here for 1000 people (sample). Based on that, we will create the data, which is the statistic.\n\nBasics of Statistics\n\nThe basics of statistics include the measure of central tendency and the measure of dispersion. The central tendencies are mean, median and mode and dispersions comprise variance and standard deviation.\n\nMean is the average of the observations. Median is the central value when observations are arranged in order. The mode determines the most frequent observations in a data set.\n\nVariation is the measure of spread out of the collection of data. Standard deviation is the measure of the dispersion of data from the mean. The square of standard deviation is equal to the variance.\n\nMathematical Statistics\n\nMathematical statistics is the application of Mathematics to Statistics, which was initially conceived as the science of the state — the collection and analysis of facts about a country: its economy, and, military, population, and so forth.\n\nMathematical techniques used for different analytics include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equation and measure-theoretic probability theory.\n\nTypes of Statistics\n\nBasically, there are two types of statistics.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nInferential Statistics\n\nIn the case of descriptive statistics, the data or collection of data is described in summary. But in the case of inferential stats, it is used to explain the descriptive one. Both these types have been used on large scale.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nThe data is summarised and explained in descriptive statistics. The summarization is done from a population sample utilising several factors such as mean and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics is a way of organising, representing, and explaining a set of data using charts, graphs, and summary measures. Histograms, pie charts, bars, and scatter plots are common ways to summarise data and present it in tables or graphs. Descriptive statistics are just that: descriptive. They don’t need to be normalised beyond the data they collect.\n\nInferential Statistics\n\nWe attempt to interpret the meaning of descriptive statistics using inferential statistics. We utilise inferential statistics to convey the meaning of the collected data after it has been collected, evaluated, and summarised. The probability principle is used in inferential statistics to determine if patterns found in a study sample may be extrapolated to the wider population from which the sample was drawn. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and study correlations between variables, and they can also be used to predict population sizes. Inferential statistics are used to derive conclusions and inferences from samples, i.e. to create accurate generalisations.\n\nStatistics Formulas\n\nThe formulas that are commonly used in statistical analysis are given in the table below.\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}Sample\\ Mean,\\ \\bar{x}\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\sum x}{n}\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}Population\\ Mean,\\ \\mu\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\sum x}{N}\\end{array} \\)\n\nSample Standard Deviation, (s)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x-\\bar{x})^{2} }{n-1}}\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}Population\\ Standard\\ Deviation,\\ \\sigma\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x-\\mu )^{2}}{N}}\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}Sample\\ Variance,\\ s^{2}\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}s^{2} = \\frac{\\sum (x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}Population\\ Variance,\\ \\sigma ^{2}\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sigma ^{2} = \\frac{\\sum (x_{i} – \\mu)^{2}}{N}\\end{array} \\)\n\nRange, (R) Largest data value – smallest data value\n\nSummary Statistics\n\nIn Statistics, summary statistics are a part of descriptive statistics (Which is one of the types of statistics), which gives the list of information about sample data. We know that statistics deals with the presentation of data visually and quantitatively. Thus, summary statistics deals with summarizing the statistical information. Summary statistics generally deal with condensing the data in a simpler form, so that the observer can understand the information at a glance. Generally, statisticians try to describe the observations by finding:\n\nThe measure of central tendency or mean of the locations, such as arithmetic mean.\n\nThe measure of distribution shapes like skewness or kurtosis.\n\nThe measure of dispersion such as the standard mean absolute deviation.\n\nThe measure of statistical dependence such as correlation coefficient.\n\nSummary Statistics Table\n\nThe summary statistics table is the visual representation of summarized statistical information about the data in tabular form.\n\nFor example, the blood group of 20 students in the class are O, A, B, AB, B, B, AB, O, A, B, B, AB, AB, O, O, B, A, AB, B, A.\n\nBlood Group No. of Students O 4 A 4 B 7 AB 5 Total 20\n\nThus, the summary statistics table shows that 4 students in the class have O blood group, 4 students have A blood group, 7 students in the class have B blood group and 5 students in the class have AB blood group. The summary statistics table is generally used to represent the big data related to population, unemployment, and the economy to be summarized systematically to interpret the accurate result.\n\nScope of Statistics\n\nStatistics is used in many sectors such as psychology, geology, sociology, weather forecasting, probability and much more. The goal of statistics is to gain understanding from the data, it focuses on applications, and hence, it is distinctively considered as a mathematical science.\n\nMethods in Statistics\n\nThe methods involve collecting, summarizing, analyzing, and interpreting variable numerical data. Here some of the methods are provided below.\n\nData collection\n\nData summarization\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWhat is Data in Statistics?\n\nData is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations etc.\n\nTypes of Data\n\nQualitative data- it is descriptive data.\n\nExample- She can run fast, He is thin.\n\nQuantitative data- it is numerical information.\n\nExample- An Octopus is an Eight legged creature.\n\nTypes of quantitative data\n\nDiscrete data- has a particular fixed value. It can be counted\n\nContinuous data- is not fixed but has a range of data. It can be measured.\n\nRepresentation of Data\n\nThere are different ways to represent data such as through graphs, charts or tables. The general representation of statistical data are:\n\nBar Graph\n\nPie Chart\n\nLine Graph\n\nPictograph\n\nHistogram\n\nFrequency Distribution\n\nBar Graph\n\nA Bar Graph represents grouped data with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. Pie Chart\n\nA type of graph in which a circle is divided into Sectors. Each of these sectors represents a proportion of the whole. Line graph\n\nThe line chart is represented by a series of data points connected with a straight line.\n\nThe series of data points are called ‘markers.’ Pictograph\n\nA pictorial symbol for a word or phrase, i.e. showing data with the help of pictures. Such as Apple, Banana & Cherry can have different numbers, and it is just a representation of data. Histogram\n\nA diagram is consisting of rectangles. Whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable and whose width is equal to the class interval. Frequency Distribution\n\nThe frequency of a data value is often represented by “f.” A frequency table is constructed by arranging collected data values in ascending order of magnitude with their corresponding frequencies.\n\nMeasures of Central Tendency\n\nIn Mathematics, statistics are used to describe the central tendencies of the grouped and ungrouped data. The three measures of central tendency are:\n\nMean\n\nMedian\n\nMode\n\nAll three measures of central tendency are used to find the central value of the set of data.\n\nMeasures of Dispersion\n\nIn statistics, the dispersion measures help interpret data variability, i.e. to understand how homogenous or heterogeneous the data is. In simple words, it indicates how squeezed or scattered the variable is. However, there are two types of dispersion measures, absolute and relative. They are tabulated as below:\n\nAbsolute measures of dispersion Relative measures of dispersion\n\nRange\n\nVariance\n\nStandard deviation\n\nQuartiles and Quartile deviation\n\nMean and Mean deviation\n\nCo-efficient of Range\n\nCo-efficient of Variation\n\nCo-efficient of Standard Deviation\n\nCo-efficient of Quartile Deviation\n\nCo-efficient of Mean Deviation\n\nSkewness in Statistics\n\nSkewness, in statistics, is a measure of the asymmetry in a probability distribution. It measures the deviation of the curve of the normal distribution for a given set of data.\n\nThe value of skewed distribution could be positive or negative or zero. Usually, the bell curve of normal distribution has zero skewness.\n\nANOVA Statistics\n\nANOVA Stands for Analysis of Variance. It is a collection of statistical models, used to measure the mean difference for the given set of data.\n\nDegrees of freedom\n\nIn statistical analysis, the degree of freedom is used for the values that are free to change. The independent data or information that can be moved while estimating a parameter is the degree of freedom of information.\n\nApplications of Statistics\n\nStatistics have huge applications across various fields in Mathematics as well as in real life. Some of the applications of statistics are given below:\n\nApplied statistics, theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics\n\nMachine learning and data mining\n\nStatistics in society\n\nStatistical computing\n\nStatistics applied to the mathematics of the arts\n\nVideo Lesson\n\nGrade 11 Statistics\n\nStatistics Related Articles\n\nAbsolute and Relative Error Alternative Hypothesis Assumed Mean Method Box and Whisker Plot Categorical Data Cluster Analysis Confidence Interval Control Charts Correlation and Regression Arithmetic Mean And Range Data Collection And Organization Of Data Measures of Dispersion Frequency Distribution Table Statistics Interpolation Interquartile Range Null Hypothesis P-value Quartiles Sample Statistic Sampling Error Tests of Significance Z-Score Table\n\nHope this detailed discussion and formulas on statistics will help you to solve problems quickly and efficiently.
