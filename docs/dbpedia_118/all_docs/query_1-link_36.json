Before sharing sensitive information, make sure you're on a federal government site.\n\nThe site is secure.\n\nThe https:// ensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is an agency of the United States Department of Labor. It is the principal fact-finding agency in the broad field of labor economics and statistics and serves as part of the U.S. Federal Statistical System. BLS collects, calculates, analyzes, and publishes data essential to the public, employers, researchers, and government organizations.\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics measures labor market activity, working conditions, price changes, and productivity in the U.S. economy to support public and private decision making.\n\nOur Work and Organization\n\nThe first BLS Commissioner, Carroll D. Wright, described the Bureau’s mandate as “the fearless publication of the facts.” Today, \"Just the Facts\" is a core BLS value. If asked, “Is the glass half empty or half full?” At BLS, we see an 8-ounce glass containing 4 ounces.\n\nWho We Serve\n\nSurvey Respondents\n\nThe generous cooperation of the people who participate in our surveys—people like you—helps us fulfill our mission of providing vital information about our economy and society to our nation's workers and employers.\n\nOur Website\n\nwww.bls.gov is the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with online publications and data tools to help you find what you're looking for.\n\nCustomer Input\n\nBLS is proud to work with prominent technical and scientific professionals who serve on these committees of stakeholders, advising BLS on ways to improve and innovate.\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nAbout BLS in a Q & A format.\n\nLast Modified Date: April 11, 2024"
