        "text": "How it's used in finance: For instance, when evaluating the average return on an investment over a certain period, analysts typically use the mean. If you had five yearly returns of 5%, 6%, 4%, 8%, and 7%, the mean would be 6% [(5+6+4+8+7)/5].\n\nStrengths and weaknesses: While the mean provides a quick snapshot of an average, it can be skewed by outliers. For instance, in the case of CEO salaries within a company, if one CEO earns significantly more than the others, the mean could provide an inflated average, making it seem like everyone earns more than they actually do.\n\nRelevance in financial data: It's particularly useful in real estate. For instance, when looking at the price of homes in San Francisco in the past decade, the median value offers a clearer picture than the mean. Given the presence of super-luxury homes, the mean can get skewed, but the median provides a more accurate representation of what most houses are priced at.\n\nWhen to use it over mean: Median is the go-to when you have skewed data or outliers.\n\nIts applications in finance: For instance, in analyzing the most frequent quarterly profit margin achieved by Apple over the past 10 years, the mode would provide insight into the most consistent profit margin.\n\nHow outliers impact each measure: While outliers can drastically change the mean, the median remains unaffected. For example, if Amazon's stock had an unusually high surge one day due to significant news, that day's price might skew the mean price over a month but won't influence the median much.\n\nSkewed data and the role of central tendency: In a scenario where most of Europe's tech startups see modest profits but a few, like Spotify, have immense profits, the mean profit would be skewed higher. However, the median would provide a more realistic average profit for a typical startup.\n\nMean: An investor wants to understand the average return of their investment portfolio over the past ten years. By calculating the mean return of the portfolio annually, they can get a quick insight into the general performance trend.\n\nMedian: In a different scenario, let's consider a hedge fund examining the annual salaries of CEOs in the tech industry. Due to outliers like Elon Musk's compensation, the median would provide a more representative view of a typical tech CEO's salary than the mean.\n\nMode: A retail bank might be interested in the most common credit score among its loan applicants to design suitable loan products. Here, the mode helps in identifying that frequent score.\n\nMean: Take the tech giant, Apple. By studying the mean closing price of Apple's stock over the past decade, analysts can deduce a general trend in its stock performance. If the mean price has been steadily increasing, it's a good indicator of the stock's overall positive momentum.\n\nMedian: On days when the stock market is particularly volatile, looking at the median stock price over a month can provide a more stable view of a stock's value, free from the influence of extreme highs or lows.\n\nMode: For a day trader, understanding the mode of a stock's intraday price might be beneficial. If a stock often hits a certain price point multiple times within a day, a trader could strategize their buying and selling around that price.\n\nMean: By studying the mean quarterly revenue of Amazon over the past five years, stakeholders can gauge its consistent growth. A rising mean indicates steady growth, which is a positive sign for potential investors.\n\nMedian: When assessing the net income of startups, where a few outlier quarters (due to initial investments or sudden growth spurts) might distort the bigger picture, the median net income over a period provides a more stable view.\n\nMode: Suppose a company has sporadic sales, with some products selling far more than others. The mode can help identify which product price or range is the most frequent, offering insights into the company's main revenue source.\n\nMean: The mean value of a company's assets over several quarters can show whether the company is accumulating assets or depleting them, influencing investment decisions.\n\nMedian: For a company with fluctuating liabilities (like a seasonal business), the median liability over a year can provide a clearer picture of its typical debt situation.\n\nMode: If a company has taken various short-term loans at different interest rates, the mode can reveal the most common interest rate they're dealing with.\n\nHow averages might not represent the entire dataset: For instance, the mean income in New York City might seem high, but it doesn't account for the disparity between the wealthiest and the poorest."
