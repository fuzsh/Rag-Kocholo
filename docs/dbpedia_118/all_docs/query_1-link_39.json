Learn more about the financial knowledge and decision-making skills building block and how it can help young people make the right decisions for their situation.\n\nDevelopment of this building block\n\nFinancial knowledge and decision-making skills typically donâ€™t develop until adolescence and young adulthood. During these years, they become more relevant, especially for youth who start to earn money, buy things on their own, manage a bank account, or borrow for education.\n\nThe tables that follow show what this building block looks like at three stages of development and how the skills and abilities relate to adult behavior associated with financial well-being."
