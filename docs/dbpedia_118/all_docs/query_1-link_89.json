Furthermore, you can project how the cost structure for your business may change as your business grows and revenue levels increase.\n\nHow Financial Performance Data can help existing businesses?\n\nBusiness plans are not just for start-ups. Revisiting and updating your business plan frequently can help you to ensure that your business is performing optimally, staying on top changing business conditions, keeping tabs on the competition and injecting fresh ideas into your operations.\n\nWhether you are putting together a formal business plan or seeking to make an operational decision, the Financial Performance Data can provide insight on the operations of similar small and medium-sized businesses in your industry, from amounts spent in specific expense categories to the general health of the firms in operation.\n\nFinancial Performance Data also offers you the option of entering data from your business - annual revenue and expense data and assets/liabilities, which can be used to benchmark your small or medium sized business against relevant industry averages.\n\nBenchmarking using Financial Performance Data can identify areas in which your business deviates from the relevant industry average, identifying opportunities to make changes to your cost structure that may help you to grow your business."
