        "text": "Professionals in this area use statistical and quantitative methods to analyze and predict the markets, and apply programming tools to produce robust investment strategies. Their work revolves around creating mathematical models that are used to assess and manage financial systems, potential risk, and timing of trades.\n\nNecessary Skills: a strong command of programming languages, such as Python, C#, and SQL, as well as statistical analysis tools, such as R, Matlab, and SAS. Some roles will also require knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Good understanding of a variety of mathematical and statistical models used in finance.\n\nSample of Employer Partners in this area:\n\nPortfolio managers engage in portfolio construction, monitoring asset exposures and allocations, managing client requests, tax management, monitoring pre-trade client guideline compliance and exception resolution. They initiate trades, and monitor the portfolios on an ongoing basis. They also develop a deep understanding of investment products and operational policies and procedures. With career progression, they can manage a team of analysts and researchers.\n\nNecessary Skills: in addition to effective communication skills and knowledge of asset classes, professionals in this area also require strong quantitative and mathematical modeling, coding, and analytical thinking skills. This role often prefer a financial analyst certification, like the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), and previous experience. Most portfolio managers will start their careers as portfolio analysts.\n\nSample of Employer Partners in this area:\n\nQuantitative engineers or quantitative developers work in the FinTech space. They are responsible for designing, developing, testing and deploying sophisticated software solutions to facilitate the work of various financial institutions.\n\nNecessary Skills: excellent coding skills in Python, C++, and Java, and knowledge in probability, linear regression and time series data analysis. In addition, interest in financial markets and knowledge of various financial products give quant developers a distinct advantage, since they work on a variety of projects with teams across an organization.\n\nSample of Employer Partners in this area:\n\nProfessionals in this area empower the decision making process for investments and trades by providing risk analysis, and developing/enhancing risk model frameworks across various markets and assets. They use various techniques, including \"value at risk\" (VaR), Monte Carlo simulation, and linear regression-based statistical models, to measure the potential of loss on an investment profile. They also run stress tests to gauge the effectiveness of their models.\n\nNecessary Skills: strong skills in communication and detail orientation, quantitative and financial modeling skills, programming abilities using tools like VBA, Python, R, and SAS, as well as knowledge of various statistical and volatility models.\n\nSample of Employer Partners in this area:\n\nTraders analyze market data, such as price and volume, and use mathematical and statistical models to identify and execute trading decisions that may involve hundreds of thousands of shares and securities.\n\nA trader develops a strategy and applies the model to historical market data so that it can be back-tested and optimized. If the strategy yields profit, it is then applied onto real-time markets to implement an automated trading process. Quantitative trading techniques also include high-frequency trading, algorithmic trading and statistical arbitrage.\n\nNecessary Skills: a strong background in programming skills in Python, C++, SQL, R, and/ or Java. Ability to navigate price indexes, such as SPX and VIX. It also requires the knowledge of statistical analysis, numerical linear algebra, and machine learning processes. In addition, traders must possess the ability to thrive under pressure, maintain focus despite long hours, withstand an often competitive/intense environment, and respond well to failure.\n\nSample of Employer Partners in this area:"
