        "text": "The Google Play Store for Android and the Apple App Store for iOS are the two largest distribution channels for mobile apps, offering almost global coverage to a huge potential audience. However, as competition on the two major stores has grown, developers have found it increasingly difficult to achieve visibility for their apps on these stores. At the same time, a host of new alternative app stores have proliferated, driven by the open nature of the Android platform (which allows third party app distribution) and growth of the Chinese app market, where Google Play isn’t officially available but still can be reached. These new app store environments offer a number of benefits for developers and can form an important part of an app marketing and distribution strategy.\n\nLaunching your app with these different app stores may fit your go-to-market strategy, if you want to reach a niche audience. Knowing what audience an app store caters to means developers can upload their app with confidence – there will be users that are interested in that type of app. For example, an alternative app store may focus on a specific app genre (e.g. games, utilities, business or one type of user segment). Alternative app stores also allow targeting of national audiences – for example Tencent MyApp, 360 Mobile Assistant (China), and the SK T-Store (Korea) would be key channels for Western developers and publishers seeking to access those markets. In fact, when targeting the Chinese market, there’s no choice but to use one of the Top Android app stores in China. You can find more app distribution services and channels in our app marketing directory.\n\nWith that number of multiple app stores and app developers constant need to diversify their distribution channels to grow their apps user base efficiently, the online tool to monitor multiple app stores was launched by appScatter team. The tool gives developers a truly holistic view of the entire app stores landscape and provides information about app performance statistics such as downloads, rankings and revenues, as well as competitors app information. appScatter system dashboard presents data for four types of data – Distribution, Tracking, Performance and Intelligence.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo quote the company’s market research:\n\n“There are more than 2 app stores. In fact there are over 300 app stores worldwide today and still growing. Distributing, managing and tracking your apps across multiple stores possess signiﬁcant challenges. Further, the risk of not adhering to your mobile strategy in terms of legal, compliance and governance is tremendous both from a financial and brand reputational perspective.”\n\nNow, alternative app stores may also offer a revenue share model that is more favorable to developers than the standard 70/30 split offered by Apple and Google Play. Some app stores may not be as generous with their revenue share model, but do offer the ability to pay for a certain amount of downloads to increase an app’s popularity, or even to buy ‘featured’ placement. This ability to access additional promotional tools is one of the key advantages of using different app stores for independent developers who may find the tight editorial control of the major stores difficult to penetrate.\n\nAlternative app stores can deliver increasingly impressive levels of downloads and user numbers if the right strategy was applied. In this guide we’ve listed a number of mobile app stores grouped by platform, manufacturer, location and mobile operator.\n\nA quick snapshot of the mobile app industry can be presented with the following scope of data points.\n\nKey App Stores Data Points:\n\nTotal number of Android apps on Google Play – 3.3 million\n\nTotal number of iOS apps on the App Store – 2.2 million\n\nMyApp (Tencent) market share – 25% of the China’s Android app market\n\n360 Mobile Assistant market share – 15% of the China’s Android app market\n\nXiaomi App Store market share – 11% of the China’s Android app market\n\nSo we’re starting our list with Android app stores because they presented the biggest and most diverse segment of the mobile app industry.\n\nAndroid App Stores\n\nWith the Android mobile OS Google chose an open platform approach, permitting its apps distribution via multiple app stores. Over time it was adopted by a number of OEMs and it lead to Android OS getting a foothold with multiple top mobile device manufacturers, among those – Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, Huawei and others. In terms of the number of apps available, we have 5 stores presented in the following table, with Google Play leading the list with 2.7 million Android applications as of June 2019, 479,000+ on the Amazon AppStore, 850,000+ on the independent app store GetJar that began offering apps starting pre-iPhone era in 2005 and in February 2014, GetJar was acquired by Sungy Mobile.\n\nNumber of apps on Top Android App Stores, in millions\n\nName Available Apps Google Play 2.7 million Amazon AppStore 0.48 million GetJar 0.85 million Aptoide 0.7 million Opera Mobile Store 0.3 million\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nAnd so let’s dive into the actual list of Android app stores that are currently operational.\n\nList of Best ASO Tools and Agencies\n\nGummicubeThe #1 App Store Optimization (ASO) company trusted by thousands of the world's leading companiesView moreFavouredApp Marketing Agency Cofounded by Former Apple Marketing LeadView moreYodel MobileThe leading global app marketing consultancyView moreMoburstMobile Done RightView moreThe ASO ProjectFull-Service App Store Optimization AgencyView moreConsultMyAppTruly effective mobile marketingView moreEvamobiMobile Performance Marketing AgencyView moreThe Game MarketerMobile Game Marketing ExpertsView moreAPPlyzerThe ASO data platform that doesn't limit growth.View moreSEM NexusStartup App Marketing ExpertsView moreSearch Ads OptimizationScale Apple Search Ads ProfitablyView morePhitureWe Help Apps GrowView morePreApps#1 App Marketing AgencyView moreApp GuardiansA Mobile-First Advertising AgencyView moreApp RadarAll-in-one ASO platformView moreREPLUGENABLING YOUR MOBILE GROWTHView moreV.O.X by Liberteenz, Inc.Science The Message | Unlock Your Mobile PotentialView moreSplitMetricsUnlock mobile growthView more\n\nOur List of Android App Stores\n\nGoogle Play – the original Android app store operated by Google, it has more than 3.3 million apps, multiple categories, top charts, parent guide and more.\n\nCodeNgo – this app store offers bulk Android app submission, just fill in a single form to submit your app to more than 30 stores, from Google Play, Opera to Amazon, Samsung and more. Also CodeNgo features the section dedicated to Top Chinese app stores Android app submission.\n\nAppBrain is an online Android market browser store with the ability to enable installations directly to a user’s phone. The store was founded by Mathijs Vogelzang and the Zürich-based company AppTornado in 2009. The company has launched an impressive 35 Android apps, which when combined, total 50 million downloads – these apps are published by Swiss Codemonkeys. The store displays the Android apps via search, categories and rankings, and sections such as hot today, all-time popular, top rated and the popularity in a certain country, which help users to locate Android apps more efficiently – at the time of writing there are 1036815 apps available on the Android market.\n\nAppBrain listing example\n\nSlideMe is an alternative app store that was founded in 2008 and is based in Seattle. Serving as a marketplace (and featuring a growing community within this), it hosts a variety of Android apps catered to specific audiences. The company says their philosophy is defined on the basis that “one Application Store can’t reach everyone, everywhere with the applications they want.” They are ranked second to Google Play when speaking in terms of global reach for Android apps – an impressive milestone.\n\nThe company provides an “on-device” Application Store for device vendors, and delivers the apps themselves to niche markets through variables such as: geographical location, the device being utilized, the payment method and apps that users can’t find in a more conventional manner; SlideMe allows developers to sell their new app globally. In essence, the company is positioned as the place that distributes developers’ apps to users who do not have Google Play enabled devices available to them – many of these devices have SlideMe preloaded instead. They also offer custom distribution channels, they have no country restrictions across different Android device types and there is no setup fee for developers.\n\n1Mobile is an alternative app store that provides a collection of mobile apps, games and videos. Multiple mobile formats are catered to on the website, but Google’s Android format features the largest library of applications. The apps are displayed in a variety of ways on the website: there is a “Games of the Week” feature at the top that lists the best new apps and games to appear on Google Play within the last week, an editor’s choice section where the editors list their favourite 50 games and apps, the top trends of recent times and more. A section of the website is also home to the 1Mobile Market APK– the dedicated 1Mobile store app for mobile devices that allows users to browse, download and install over 60,000 apps wherever they are.\n\nDevelopers have to go through a standard registration procedure before they can start publishing apps on 1Mobile. Once they have registered for an account, developers submit their app to 1Mobilefor an “AppReview” – if the developer’s app is judged to be of a high enough quality to be published, it will appear on 1Mobile within 2 business days. If the app doesn’t meet the certain requirements, then the developer will have to respond to the feedback and fix any present errors – it’s part of 1Mobile being a store that focuses on providing a selection of quality apps to its users. The revenue share model for 1Mobile is the standard 70/30 split – a special SDK is required for the purpose of in-app billing. 1Mobile is positioned as an app store that is focused on becoming the leading alternative choice for app store sales and distribution.\n\nAptoide – provides a solution to create an app store within a website own storefront. Currently hosts 199k stores and over 789,000 apps.\n\nSome of Aptoide’s clients\n\nSource: Aptoide.com\n\nCross-platform App Stores\n\nThe mobile app ecosystem isn’t limited with just the iOS and Android duo, a lot of app stores are still catering to Windows Phone and Symbian, among other platforms. The Amazon and Windows Phone app stores are the third and fourth by number of apps, with 400,000 and 340,000 applications respectively. Some stores, like Kongregate, have focused on the gaming market, while Opera offers cross-platform apps that also work in its web browser. A fair few of these also double as content stores, offering more than just apps but also music, wallpapers and other products.\n\nAmazon team launched their own alternative app store for Android developers in 2011 and being a well-known brand has helped the company attract quite a lot of attention to it. The store features a smaller number of apps than some of the other competing stores, this is partly due to their moderation process which has to meet certain quality standards. They offer a free paid app or game every day which can generate a significant amount of exposure for the app developer, and personalized recommendations, customer reviews and 1-Click payment options mean users can find and install a developer’s app quickly and easily.\n\nAmazon provides useful services for developers using their app store, such as: an app compatibility test that detects problems for developers automatically – the test will let developers know if their app is suitable for publishing or not; a cross-platform analytics service that analyses user engagement through active devices, sessions and retention; a reward program for developers called the Appstore Developer Select which offers free ad impressions, boosts customer acquisition through Amazon “coins” and offers 25% credit back when purchasing Amazon Web Services products. The company is positioned as one of the largest third-party alternative app stores and they allow for the distribution of developers’ apps in over 200 countries in online and mobile store formats.\n\nFounded in 2004 by Ilja Laurs and based in California, GetJar has had over 2 billion apps downloaded since its inception; 3 million apps are downloaded every day. Additionally, over 395,000 developers have registered with the company to distribute their apps. The supported app platforms for developers are Android, the older Windows Mobile, and even iOS, (although Android is predominant here). Users can find a developer’s app through a series of categories and top and newer apps are displayed on the front page of the website-store.\n\nOn the developer side of things, there is no upfront cost and the requirements to get an app published are minimal. Developers have the ability to target any phone or platform as well, so there is a high degree of flexibility here. Specifically for developers looking to publish Android apps, there is the ability to grow in-app revenue through GetJar’s Offerwall system and the option of displaying App deals within an app and offering in-app discounts to re-engage existing users or acquire new ones. GetJar claims to reach over 200 million Android users too – developers can target this audience with free cross-promotion and the company’s proprietary Behavioral Targeting technology. They are positioned as one of the largest alternative app stores out there at the time of writing.\n\nThe Opera Mobile Store was launched in 2011 and followed the success of Opera Mobile that launched long ago in 2000. The company’s popular store boasts support for multiple app formats: Android, Java, iOS, Windows Mobile and provides 170,000 apps and games for 6,000 different mobile phone models. The front of the website-store features the most popular apps, new paid and free software that has just been released and software that has been updated recently. The apps are split into key categories like Business and Finance, Games, Multimedia, Communication and more.\n\nApp or game developers can sign up for a developer account which allows them to publish their apps to multiple different formats; a promotional platform is also part of this free account. The store’s large range of supported app formats coupled with the fact a developer’s app can be distributed to 230 countries, means the platform is positioned as one of the leading places for a developer to reach specific local markets – this is ideal then for a developer who has created an app with a definite market in mind. A new blog has also launched on the store that offers guidance, insight and rewards for new developers with interviews, app reviews, contests and more.\n\nAppszoom – it provides databases of both Android and iPhone apps since 2009, the store gets 7,000 apps tested annually to provide its users the best experience to use apps free of malware. It offers premium profiles to app developers to get more awareness for their apps. The site owners claims it has 3 million unique visits monthly.\n\nAppolicious – it is one of the most established third-party app stores, in operation since 2009. In 2010 it partnered up with Yahoo! to provide high quality iOS app suggestions. It owns androidapps.com directory to cover Android apps within the same framework.\n\nNexVa – a multi-platform app store that also offers a white label product for mobile operators, OEMs and companies from multiple business verticals. It also works with affiliates to drive traffic via CPI and advertising solutions, as well as proprietary API to support in-app and subscription monetization of developers apps through mobile money transactions. Each app profile provides an app description, rating, screenshots, supported platform and review section.\n\nKongregate – the app store is popular and famous for its selection of Flash-powered games, this store continues that tradition in offering video games for the mobile web (and thus mostly cross-platform).\n\nAppland – both an app store and an app-store manager, allowing you to create your own. Uploading applications is free, and will showcase your apps on the stores maintained by other devs. Pre-installed on operator 3 mobiles.\n\nItch.io – an app store that is intended to be used by both game developers and gamers, this is a free and paid-for indie games store that covers all platforms. Has a very large choice, and also has sections for game assets, development tools and books.\n\nTop App Stores for iOS\n\nIn a contrast with Google’s Android open model, Apple Inc. has established its App Store ecosystem as a closed, moderated platform that implies having a single app store only – the App Store, that by January of 2017 boasted 2.2 billion iOS apps. The app store online version users can find the same library of apps they can install via the iOS App Store app, after they find them via Google / Bing search engine search. The other distinctive feature of the Apple’s iOS ecosystem has been locking iOS driven devices (iPhones and iPads) with specific mobile operators. Since the early days if iOS multiple alternative iOS app stores have popped up that required jail-breaking and unlocking devices to be able to install iOS apps outside the Apple’s official App Store. As of 2017 only a handful such app stores exist and the data points to describe each are scarce.\n\nNumber of apps on Top iOS App Stores, in millions\n\nName Available Apps App Store 2.2m Cydia n/a GetJar 0.85m Appland 0.13m\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\niOS App Stores\n\nApp Store – Apple’s official iOS application store and this is the only source of the Apple’s editors team reviewed apps for iOS running devices such as iPhone and iPad. The current app review time process on average takes about a day. The overall number of apps, iPad and iPhone combined, is over 2.2 million, the total number of downloads for iOS apps from July 2008 to June 2017 – over 180 billion. The number of apps on the App Store has grown from 5,000 in summer of 2008 on its launch to 2.2 million on January of 2017.\n\nNumber of available apps on the App Store 2008-2017\n\nSource: Statista\n\nCydia – unofficial iOS app store that is only available to users with ‘jailbroken’ iOS devices. Most apps are offered for free, but there are also paid apps. Claims over 4.5 million weekly users.\n\nBlackBerry OS App Stores\n\nThe fifth-biggest store by number of apps, with 130,000, the Blackberry is facing tough times: recently, both Facebook and Whatsapp said their apps would no longer be supported on the Blackberry OS.

The most likely changes to keep an eye out for will be continued app store consolidation (Alibaba/Tencent acquiring independent stores), tightening app regulations (local government requiring more documentation) and Google’s re-entry into China (China-specific version of the Google Play Store in partnership with a local tech company).”\n\nAll in all, the market for apps in China is huge and should be part of any mobile app strategy. Here are the major app stores in China to consider.\n\nMyApp from Tencent – currently the biggest app store in China, it holds around a quarter of the Chinese Android apps market.

The major app stores are Apple’s iOS App Store and Google’s Google Play store. Because of the Android ecosystem open approach Android apps can be installed not just from Google Play store but from a variety of stores. The Chinese market has become an equal rival to the US one and is on the path to leave it behind in the foreseeable future. Android app developers need to follow a smart approach of publishing their apps on multiple stores and do their homework by studying each store specifics."
