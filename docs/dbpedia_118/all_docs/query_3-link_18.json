        "text": "Industry influencers, academicians, and other prominent stakeholders certainly agree that Big Data has become a big game-changer in most, if not all, types of modern industries over the last few years. As Big Data continues to permeate our day-to-day lives, there has been a significant shift of focus from the hype surrounding it to finding real value in its use.\n\nWhile understanding the value of Big Data continues to remain a challenge, other practical challenges, including funding and return on investment and skills, continue to remain at the forefront for several different industries that are adopting Big Data. With that said, according to Research and Market reports, the global Big Data market size is expected to reach USD 268.4 billion by 2026.\n\nGenerally, most organizations have several goals for adopting Big Data projects. While the primary goal for most organizations is to enhance customer experience, other goals include cost reduction, better-targeted marketing, and making existing processes more efficient. In recent times, data breaches have also made enhanced security an important goal that Big Data projects seek to incorporate. More importantly, however, where do you stand when it comes to Big Data? You will very likely find that you are either:\n\nTrying to decide whether there is true value in Big Data or not.\n\nEvaluating the size of the market opportunity.\n\nDeveloping new services and products that will utilize Big Data.\n\nAlready using Big Data solutions. Repositioning existing services and products to utilize Big Data, or\n\nAlready utilizing Big Data solutions.\n\nWith this in mind, having a birdâs eye view of Big Data and its application in different industriesÂ will help youÂ better appreciate what your role is or what it is likely to be in the future, in your industry or across various industries.\n\nSource: Presented at Everis by Wilson Lucas (note that the diagram shows potential Big Data opportunities)\n\nHere is the list of the top 14 industries using big data applications:\n\nBanking and Securities\n\nCommunications, Media and Entertainment\n\nHealthcare Providers\n\nEducation\n\nManufacturing and Natural Resources\n\nGovernment\n\nInsurance\n\nRetail and Wholesale trade\n\nTransportation\n\nEnergy and Utilities\n\nBig Data & Auto Driving Car\n\nBig Data in IoT\n\nBig Data in Marketing\n\nBig Data in Business Insights\n\nIn this article we will examine how the above-listed ten industry verticals are using Big Data, industry-specific challenges that these industries face, and how Big Data solves these challenges.\n\n1. Banking and Securities\n\nIndustry-specific Big Data Challenges\n\nA study of 16 projects in 10 top investment and retail banks shows that the challenges in this industry include: securities fraud early warning, tick analytics, card fraud detection, archival of audit trails, enterprise credit risk reporting, trade visibility, customer data transformation, social analytics for trading, IT operations analytics, and IT policy compliance analytics, among others.\n\nApplications of Big Data in the Banking and Securities Industry\n\nThe Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is using Big Data to monitor financial market activity. They are currently using network analytics and natural language processors to catch illegal trading activity in the financial markets.\n\nRetail traders, Big banks, hedge funds, and other so-called âbig boysâ in the financial markets use Big Data for trade analytics used in high-frequency trading, pre-trade decision-support analytics, sentiment measurement, Predictive Analytics, etc.\n\nThis industry also heavily relies on Big Data for risk analytics, including; anti-money laundering, demand enterprise risk management, \"Know Your Customer,\" and fraud mitigation.\n\nBig Data providers are specific to this industry includes 1010data, Panopticon Software, Streambase Systems, Nice Actimize, and Quartet FS.\n\nRelated Read: How Facebook is using Big Data\n\n2. Communications, Media and Entertainment\n\nIndustry-specific Big Data Challenges\n\nSince consumers expect rich media on-demand in different formats and a variety of devices, some Big Data challenges in the communications, media, and entertainment industry include:\n\nCollecting, analyzing, and utilizing consumer insights\n\nLeveraging mobile and social media content\n\nUnderstanding patterns of real-time, media content usage\n\nApplications of Big Data in the Communications, Media and Entertainment Industry\n\nOrganizations in this industry simultaneously analyze customer data along with behavioral data to create detailed customer profiles that can be used to:\n\nCreate content for different target audiences\n\nRecommend content on demand\n\nMeasure content performance\n\nA case in point is the Wimbledon Championships (YouTube Video) that leverages Big Data to deliver detailed sentiment analysis on the tennis matches to TV, mobile, and web users in real-time.\n\nSpotify, an on-demand music service, uses Hadoop Big Data analytics, to collect data from its millions of users worldwide and then uses the analyzed data to give informed music recommendations to individual users.\n\nAmazon Prime, which is driven to provide a great customer experience by offering video, music, and Kindle books in a one-stop-shop, also heavily utilizes Big Data.\n\nBig Data Providers in this industry include Infochimps, Splunk, Pervasive Software, and Visible Measures.\n\n3. Healthcare Providers\n\nIndustry-specific Big Data Challenges\n\nThe healthcare sector has access to huge amounts of data but has been plagued by failures in utilizing the data to curb the cost of rising healthcare and by inefficient systems that stifle faster and better healthcare benefits across the board.\n\nThis is mainly because electronic data is unavailable, inadequate, or unusable. Additionally, the healthcare databases that hold health-related information have made it difficult to link data that can show patterns useful in the medical field.\n\nSource: Big Data in the Healthcare Sector Revolutionizing the Management of Laborious Tasks\n\nOther challenges related to Big Data include the exclusion of patients from the decision-making process and the use of data from different readily available sensors.\n\nApplications of Big Data in the Healthcare Sector\n\nSome hospitals, like Beth Israel, are using data collected from a cell phone app, from millions of patients, to allow doctors to use evidence-based medicine as opposed to administering several medical/lab tests to all patients who go to the hospital. A battery of tests can be efficient, but it can also be expensive and usually ineffective.\n\nFree public health data and Google Maps have been used by the University of Florida to create visual data that allows for faster identification and efficient analysis of healthcare information, used in tracking the spread of chronic disease. Obamacare has also utilized Big Data in a variety of ways. Big Data Providers in this industry includeÂ Recombinant Data, Humedica, Explorys, and Cerner.\n\nBig Data Students Also Enroll In\n\nBig Data Hadoop and Spark Developer Free Course | MongoDB Developer and Administrator Free Course | Apache Spark Free Course | PySpark Free Course | Hadoop Free Course Apache Spark Data Analytics Free Course\n\n4.
