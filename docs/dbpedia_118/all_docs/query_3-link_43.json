        "text": "Most accounting jobs — even entry-level roles — require a relevant degree. An associate degree in accounting provides a helpful starting point for a career.\n\nMoving up the career ladder into higher-level roles, like accounting managers or firm partners, often requires a bachelor's or master's degree.\n\nFortunately, many degrees and concentrations can lead to an accounting career, giving students several options when choosing their best educational path. For example, a finance or economics degree could qualify someone for an accounting position as much as an accounting degree.\n\nAdditionally, many schools offer multiple accounting concentrations, like sports accounting, taxation, or management accounting, allowing students to specialize in an area of interest.\n\nFor instance, someone interested in government accounting might specialize in forensic accounting or auditing, while a financial accounting concentration could be best suited for someone who plans to work for a private organization's accounting department.\n\nContinue exploring this guide to discover various types of accounting degree levels, specializations, and programs.\n\nPopular Online Accounting Bachelor's Programs\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nAccounting Degree Levels\n\nAlthough all types of accounting degrees can lead to an accounting career, higher levels of education can prepare learners for more advanced roles and certifications.\n\nAn undergraduate certificate and associate degree are for entry-level positions, ideal for introducing students to the accounting world. A bachelor's degree is more commonly required by employers seeking a higher level of knowledge in topics like taxation and business finance.\n\nStudents interested in becoming a certified public accountant (CPA) or having a managerial role in accounting should consider a master's degree and, later, a graduate certificate for additional education in a specialty area, like auditing or public accounting. Meanwhile, a Ph.D. in accounting can pave the way for a career as an accounting professor or researcher.\n\nLearn more about each degree level in detail below.\n\nCertificate\n\nA certificate briefly introduces students to accounting or an associated niche topic. Although not a degree or a professional license, an accounting certificate can provide a path to a graduate or undergraduate degree. Some schools allow enrollees to \"stack\" several related certificates into a business degree.\n\nOften requiring 9-45 credits, certificate programs usually take at least six months, and some last a year. Courses may include an introduction to accounting, federal taxation, and business law. An undergraduate certificate can help bookkeepers move into entry-level accounting positions, while an accounting graduate certificate can help meet the academic requirements for CPA licensure.\n\nAssociate\n\nAn accounting associate degree program takes longer to complete than a certificate program but less time than a bachelor's. It usually requires enrollees to earn 60-66 credits over two years. The curriculum consists of a general education core and electives, plus an accounting major. Accounting courses may include finance, marketing, managerial accounting, and business math.\n\nMost technical colleges, community colleges, and some four-year institutions offer associate degrees. An associate of arts (AA) or an associate of science (AS) in accounting is usually fully transferable to a bachelor's program, but an associate of applied science (AAS) is generally a terminal degree. Graduates may pursue entry-level careers in accounting.\n\nBachelor's\n\nA bachelor's degree in accounting meets the educational requirement for careers like accountant and auditor. Earning a bachelor's degree takes four years of full-time study, though some institutions offer accelerated programs. Accounting majors complete a minimum of 120 credits to graduate. Graduates may earn a bachelor of science, bachelor of accounting, bachelor of arts, or bachelor of business administration degree.\n\nDuring a bachelor's program in accounting, undergrads complete courses in areas such as financial accounting, auditing, managerial accounting, and accounting information systems. Accounting majors also complete general education courses that encourage critical thinking and analytical skills.\n\nMaster's\n\nBuilding on a four-year bachelor's degree, a master's program in accounting immerses students in advanced concepts in the field. These programs may confer an MS, MAcc, or MBA. The MS focuses on accounting principles, while an MAcc emphasizes advanced skills. The MBA is a general business leadership degree that can incorporate an accounting concentration.\n\nMost accounting master's programs require students to earn 30 credits in 1-3 years. Core courses may include data analytics for accountants and strategic cost accounting. Some master's degrees offer concentrations in fields such as taxation, auditing, or financial analysis and reporting. Graduates may pursue careers as forensic accountants, internal auditors, finance managers, or CPAs.\n\nDoctorate\n\nA doctorate is the highest degree awarded in the field. A doctoral program in accounting prepares graduates to serve as researchers, college professors, or advanced accounting analysts. The Ph.D. in accounting focuses on original research, while a doctor of business administration (DBA) with an accounting concentration emphasizes real-world applications.\n\nDoctorates usually take 3-5 years to earn and require about 60 credits on top of a master's degree. Courses may include advanced auditing, accounting ethics, and tax research and jurisprudence. Ph.D. students complete their doctorates with a traditional dissertation, which requires original research, and DBA students conduct an applied doctoral project.\n\nAccounting Degree Concentrations\n\nStudents can choose between an accounting-related degree or an accounting degree with a specific concentration. Schools offer both options via online, in-person, and hybrid programs.\n\nAn accounting-related degree program provides a comprehensive curriculum in a different field. Students may be able to add an accounting specialty, like taxation.\n\nIn contrast, an accounting degree with a concentration in taxation primarily follows a general accounting curriculum, along with a few courses pinpointing taxation concepts, like individual and corporate tax.\n\nAn accounting concentration gives learners some wiggle room to explore areas of interest while developing advanced accounting skills.\n\nAuditing, financial accounting, taxation, forensic accounting, and management accounting are among the most common concentration options. Find descriptions for these and other accounting concentrations below.\n\nActuarial Science\n\nCourses in actuarial science teach students to calculate risk and determine the financial costs associated with insurance.\n\nEnrollees who specialize in actuarial science take classes in probability, statistics, modeling, and financial mathematics. This concentration can help prepare graduates for actuary certification exams.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), actuaries earned a median salary of $120,000 in 2023. These professionals usually need at least a bachelor's degree, and most work in finance or insurance.\n\nAuditing\n\nAuditors evaluate financial documents to ensure their accuracy and regulatory compliance. Auditing concentration classes strengthen learners' analytical and investigative skills and explore best practices for internal and external auditing. Enrollees may also study forensic accounting and fraud examination, which can lead to fraud and forensic auditor jobs.\n\nAuditing roles typically require at least a bachelor's degree. Graduates can qualify for careers like internal auditor, tax auditor, external auditor, and government auditor.\n\nBookkeeping\n\nBookkeepers work for organizations, recording financial transactions and maintaining accounting documents. A concentration in bookkeeping strengthens financial reporting and accounting skills. Students learn to manage a general ledger and report financial information. Coursework in this specialization also covers career-focused math and auditing skills.\n\nEither an undergraduate bookkeeping certificate program or an associate degree program with a bookkeeping focus can prepare you for a career as a bookkeeper. These programs typically take 1-2 years to complete.\n\nCost Accounting\n\nA cost accounting concentration focuses on internal accounting operations, including financial planning and budgeting. Cost accounting classes explore evaluating operational metrics, identifying inefficiencies, and making decisions based on cost accounting information.\n\nIn addition to accounting classes, learners pursuing a cost accounting concentration study operations management.\n\nThis specialization prepares graduates for jobs as cost accountants in diverse fields like government, manufacturing, and construction. Cost accounting training can lead to careers in analysis, management, and consulting.\n\nEconomics\n\nEconomics studies how society allocates goods and services. An accounting degree with an economics concentration is designed to examine how businesses make economic decisions. Courses in microeconomics, investment finance, macroeconomics, and global commerce introduce concepts like resource allocation and financial markets.\n\nAdding economics coursework to an accounting degree can improve skills like logical reasoning, statistical modeling, and cost-benefit analysis. An economics concentration also helps graduates pursue careers in corporate finance, international business, and accounting.\n\nEnvironmental Accounting\n\nEnvironmental accounting applies accounting principles to the environment. Classes in this concentration train learners to determine businesses' environmental impacts. Organizations rely on environmental accountants to minimize these impacts. This specialization is also called sustainable or green accounting.\n\nWith an environmental accounting concentration for their degree, graduates can pursue careers as sustainability analysts, environmental accountants, and conservation fiscal specialists. They may also work in auditing roles.\n\nFinance\n\nAccounting programs explore financial analysis and reporting, while the discipline of finance focuses on investing, forecasting, and financial management.\n\nA finance concentration for an accounting degree blends these two knowledge bases together. Students explore corporate finance, financial modeling, and international financial management while developing analytical, decision-making, and management skills.\n\nProfessionals who add a finance concentration to their accounting degree can qualify for roles like financial analyst, personal financial advisor, and financial accountant.\n\nFinancial Accounting\n\nFinancial accounting emphasizes reporting financial information — especially external reporting. In financial accounting courses, enrollees learn to use accounting principles to evaluate organizations' financial health and report their findings.\n\nWhile accounting majors often take several financial accounting courses as part of their degree, this concentration offers greater depth into the analytical and reporting knowledge for financial accountant roles.\n\nWith a financial accounting specialization, graduates can qualify for auditor, financial accountant, and budget analyst jobs.\n\nForensic Accounting\n\nForensic accountants investigate financial crimes using accounting skills. Classes in a forensic accounting concentration explore techniques for examining fraud, financial cybercrime, and related crimes. Students learn to identify evidence for financial malfeasance and collaborate with law enforcement, including acting as expert witnesses in court.\n\nAfter graduating with a concentration in forensic accounting, professionals can work as fraud examiners, auditors, and forensic accountants.\n\nInformation Systems\n\nFinancial and accounting organizations increasingly rely on technology to manage information. An information systems concentration adds technology skills to an accounting degree.\n\nStudents pursuing this specialization learn to manage accounting databases, use financial software, and manage IT teams. They also study accounting networks and security procedures.\n\nBachelor's programs typically offer upper-division information systems classes, and students can also earn a master's in accounting with an information systems focus. With both accounting and tech skills, graduates can qualify for accountant, accounting systems manager, and management analyst roles.\n\nInternational Tax\n\nGlobal corporations rely on international tax professionals to manage complex tax issues that cross national borders. Courses in an international tax specialization examine financial regulations for companies with international operations. This includes foreign companies with U.S. operations and domestic companies operating abroad. This concentration is typically offered at the graduate level.\n\nWith an international tax accounting degree, graduates can work as international tax analysts, tax consultants, and compliance officers. A master's degree can also lead to roles such as international tax manager.\n\nManagement Accounting\n\nManagement accounting draws on financial information to make managerial decisions. In management accounting courses, learners explore financial planning, accounting controls, and strategic problem-solving.\n\nWhile most accounting majors take a management accounting course as part of their graduation requirements, this concentration adds additional upper-division classes. Degree-seekers can also earn a master's in management accounting.\n\nWith a management accounting specialization, graduates can qualify for management accountant, cost accountant, and accounting manager careers. The concentration can also help learners prepare for credentials like certified management accountant.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nAccounting professionals play an important role in corporate mergers and acquisitions. Pursuing a concentration in this area typically includes taking classes about corporate restructuring, business valuation, and mergers and acquisitions modeling.\n\nThis specialized path of study trains graduates to evaluate corporate merger plans, recommend acquisition strategies, and shepherd organizations through an acquisition. These skills help prepare professionals for careers in mergers and acquisitions, financial management, and risk analysis.\n\nPublic Accounting\n\nPublic accounting focuses on financial transaction disclosure, including taxation and auditing services. In a public accounting concentration, students learn to prepare financial statements such as individual and corporate tax returns, audit financial records, and consult on public accounting issues.\n\nAccounting students who specialize in public accounting often pursue CPA careers. In addition to an undergraduate accounting degree, CPAs typically need 30 additional credits to satisfy their state's educational requirements for licensure. Learners can meet this requirement by earning a master's degree in accounting.\n\nSports Accounting\n\nAccountants help sports teams manage their finances, payroll, and budget. While completing a sports accounting concentration, students learn about financial reporting for sports organizations. Classes cover sports-specific management operations, financial analysis, and accounting issues.\n\nBecause this concentration is specific to one industry, only a few schools offer it at the undergraduate level. Some institutions offer graduate levels of this specialization. A degree with this concentration can prepare graduates to work as sports accountants, merchandise accountants, financial controllers, and payroll accountants.\n\nTaxation\n\nA taxation concentration adds more public accounting and taxation coursework to a general accounting degree. This specialization prepares graduates for careers as tax professionals, including CPAs.\n\nDuring a taxation accounting degree program, students take courses in corporate taxation, income tax law, and real estate tax regulations. They learn to evaluate tax regulations and prepare tax returns and other financial documents. In addition to the CPA career path, graduates can work as tax analysts or personal financial advisors.\n\nQuestions About Types of Accounting Degrees\n\nHow many types of accounting degrees are there?\n\nThere are dozens of accounting degree types, including financial accounting, international taxation, sports accounting, and cost accounting.
