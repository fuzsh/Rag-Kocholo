        "text": "I just graduated in engineering where I have a very strong background in pure maths, but unfortunately I didnt study any statistics in my course. I know calculus, probability theory, measure theory, analysis etc. But I have not done any courses on regression etc.\n\nI am planning to apply for several \"analyst\" positions at various banks/investment firms in the coming months.\n\nAmongst some of them, they specifically require the applicants to have a good knowledge in statistics.\n\nWhat statistical techniques/concepts do I need and should I learn (self study), that an financial analyst would require? Basically I will be analysing and computing statistical and financial data, what techniques should I learn? Should I start with regression, time series etc.?\n\nAs taken from wikipedia, this is something I would probably be doing:\n\nFinancial analysts use spreadsheet and statistical software packages to analyze financial data, spot trends, and develop forecasts. On the basis of their results, they write reports and make presentations, usually making recommendations to buy or sell a particular investment or security. Senior analysts may actually make the decision to buy or sell for the company or client if they are the ones responsible for managing the assets. Other analysts use the data to measure the financial risks associated with making a particular investment decision.\n\nSo what statistical concepts/tools/techniques/methods do I need to study, in order to do the above (in the quotes)?\n\nI just got the book George Snedecor: Statistical Methods, but what main concepts/techniques are most important/most used by analysts? I'd like to quickly start into those topics first."
