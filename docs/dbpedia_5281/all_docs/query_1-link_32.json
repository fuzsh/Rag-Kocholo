        "text": "I can't believe this was my 4th Seattle/King County Clinic & as the only returning Patient Registration Manager üëÄ I was a little worried about managing my area this year, but also felt relieved when I heard Don Nunn was joining me. Though he knows the ins & outs of the entire Clinic, I had to fill him in on some nuances & processes at Patient Registration. But we made a great team and broke records for how fast we got patients through registration. This year, I was also asked to participate in interviews and talk to tour groups. If you didn't know, I love being behind the camera more than being in front of it and people. But I jumped in because the elected officials on the tour needed to hear how essential the Clinic is for the community, so they can help influence legislation and change how our healthcare system works. The representatives from the various clinical fields and schools also needed to see the value and become future volunteers & donors/sponsors. It was a busy 5 days (including 1 day of set-up for me), but they flew by in a blink of an eye. I always look forward to seeing returning volunteers & Leadership Team members. Despite only seeing each other once a year, we work like a well-oiled machine to efficiently run our areas and bring the Clinic to life. Onwards to the next one in April 2025 ‚úåÔ∏è"
