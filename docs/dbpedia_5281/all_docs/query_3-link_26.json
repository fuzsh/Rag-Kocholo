        "text": "The PFWA’s Bill Nunn Jr. Award is given to a reporter who has made a long and distinguished contribution to pro football through coverage.\n\nThe award is named for Nunn, who prior to his Hall of Fame scouting career with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worked for 22 years at the Pittsburgh Courier, one of the most influential Black publications in the United States as a sports writer, and later, sports editor and managing editor.\n\nNunn, who started with the Courier as a sports writer in 1948, regularly covered HBCU events and athletes. He compiled the definitive Black College All-America team for the Courier starting in 1950. In 1952, he became the sports editor, and he was the paper’s managing editor when the Steelers hired him as a part-time scout in 1966. Nunn became the Steelers’ assistant director of player personnel in 1970, and he stayed with the organization as a scout and personnel executive until his death in 2014. He helped build the Steelers’ dynasty of the 1970s, and the organization won six Super Bowls during his tenure. He also continued to write his “Change of Pace” column for the Courier well into the 1970s.\n\nNunn was an inaugural inductee into the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2011, and he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a contributor in 2021.\n\nThe Nunn Award is presented yearly during the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Festival weekend in Canton, Ohio.\n\nBILL NUNN JR.
