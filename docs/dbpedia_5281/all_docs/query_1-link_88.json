        "text": "Nelson\n\nFor the transcriber, let’s just introduce ourselves so she can pick up on our voices. I’m Mike Nelson.\n\nEngel\n\nI’m Jeffrey Engel.\n\nGates\n\nAnd Robert Gates.\n\nNelson\n\nIt is July 8th and we’re here in Mr. Gates’s home. You’ve done this before, so you know the drill. You will get a transcript; you will get to edit, redact, et cetera, all designed to encourage you when you’re trying to decide should I say this or not to say it, because you can take it out later if you want. The transcript is the only thing that will ever become public, at such time as the Bush 43 Foundation and so on choose to release things. Any nuts-and-bolts questions?\n\nGates\n\nNo.\n\nNelson\n\nI didn’t think so, since you’re a veteran.\n\nGates\n\nI guess I’ll probably see you guys again, when you’re doing [Barack] Obama. [laughter]\n\nEngel\n\nWe were just discussing which topics transition through and which ones we should focus on.\n\nNelson\n\nAs in all these interviews, we’re interested in finding out something of how you became the person you were at the time that you entered the [George W.] Bush Presidency, so if you don’t mind, from the family you grew up in, in Kansas, how did you develop an interest in politics? History? Foreign affairs? Then how did you get to William & Mary?\n\nGates\n\nI grew up in a house where we were a very modest, middle-class family, very close family. Growing up in 1950s Kansas was pretty idyllic. I had a few ground rules I had to obey, and other than that I had an enormous amount of freedom to explore and do whatever I wanted. My brother and I were familiar faces at local emergency rooms. We were a little on the adventurous side. I was a reader; I particularly liked biography and American history.\n\nIn high school I focused more on science and had a big debate with my father, “argument” is a better word. I wanted to go back east to school; I was a stupid teenager and thought that I had to go back east to get a good education. That started when I was about 15, and eventually he relented. My brother is eight years older than I am, but basically my father said, I’ll give you the same amount of money to go to school that I gave your brother. If you want to go back east, you make up the difference.\n\nI was going into pre-med. My final two choices were between Johns Hopkins and William & Mary. I chose William & Mary because it was a little better deal financially and I had a friend I had known in Kansas who was at William & Mary, a couple of years ahead of me, so I entered William & Mary as a premed student.\n\nMy first semester freshman year, I took chemistry, biology, English, calculus, and German. I did OK in everything but calculus; I got a D in calculus, as I always would tell the freshmen at Texas A&M.\n\nEngle\n\nSounds like you’re telling my life story.\n\nGates\n\nMy father called from Kansas, and in those days, 1961, a long-distance call was a big deal. He said, “Tell me about the D.” I said, “Dad, the D was a gift.”\n\nAnyway, I stayed. I didn’t change my major to history until my sophomore year. Partly I found that I was better at the lab work in chemistry and biology and so on, but my dislike of math and my ineptitude in math made aspects of chemistry, in particular, really hard for me. I realized that I probably wasn’t cut out to go in that direction. Just being in Williamsburg had an impact as well, being so steeped in history. There had been this long interest in American history and so on before that.\n\nI changed my major to history, and as my education continued, I just kept moving east. I wish I could say it was out of intellectual curiosity, but it actually was more out of a perception, particularly as a result of dialogue with my professors, of where teaching jobs were going to be. By then there was a glut of professors of American history, so there were really no job prospects.\n\nBy the time I was through most of my master’s, it was a combination of Russian and eastern European history, but really more on eastern Europe. Then my entire PhD was on Russia and the Soviet Union. Out of that master’s program is where I was recruited by the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency].\n\nNelson\n\nYou decided somewhere along the line you wanted to be a college professor?\n\nGates\n\nYes, my plan all along had been to be a college professor, or to teach. When I got my master’s, I had two job offers. One was from CIA and the other was to teach seventh-grade history in Williamsburg. I actually think the teaching job paid a tad bit more, but I decided to go ahead and do the CIA thing just because it sounded exciting and everything. By the time I did a stint in the Air Force and did my CIA training, I actually didn’t start full time at CIA in an operational job, a regular job, until January of ’68.\n\nI began my PhD program at Georgetown in the fall of ’69.\n\nNelson\n\nWere you in ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps]?\n\nGates\n\nNo. When I was recruited by CIA, CIA gave no draft deferments. This was at the height of the buildup in Vietnam, the spring of ’66. CIA granted no deferments, but they had a deal with the Air Force so that the Air Force would move you to the top of the list to go to Officer Training School. You’d go to Officer Training School and then you would spend a year at an operational base. Then you would be seconded back to CIA for two years. You did three years of active duty in the Air Force and then three years in the inactive Reserve.\n\nI started at CIA in August of ’66, worked at CIA for about two months, until my Officer Training School class began. Then I went into the Air Force and was on active duty in the Air Force for three years, but two of those three, beginning in January of ’68, I was back at CIA as an Air Force lieutenant, but in civilian clothes and everything.\n\nI started my PhD program because I had no intention of making a career of CIA. I wanted to be a college professor. I finished my PhD in the spring of ’74 and literally within a few weeks received my first offer from [Henry] Kissinger and [Brent] Scowcroft to come down and take the Soviet desk at the NSC [National Security Council]. I told my wife, “Well, I’ll do that for a year or two, and then I’ll go teach.”\n\nNelson\n\nHow did they know about you?\n\nGates\n\nAs with most cases in the NSC, I had a friend who was already there. Actually, it was not in a substantive job; he was the deputy executive secretary. But Kissinger had taken his Soviet expert, Bill Hyland, to State when he became Secretary of State, so there was a vacancy for a Soviet expert on the NSC. They clearly wanted somebody more junior, who would not be competitive with Hyland or [Helmut] Sonnenfeldt, those guys over at the State Department. That’s how I got the job.\n\nNelson\n\nFrom the time you enrolled at William & Mary until the mid-’70s, there was a sort of a sea change in the attitudes of young people toward things like the military, the CIA, the NSC. Did any of that affect your thinking? Did you feel like you were sort of out of step?\n\nGates\n\nNo, because William & Mary was a very conservative campus. For the first three years I was there, it was completely segregated; Virginia was still segregated. There was one demonstration in my four years at William & Mary and it was when the administration canceled the taping of the TV show Hootenanny. They canceled it because it was to take place during finals.\n\nAnd Indiana was pretty conservative, even as a big public university. As late as ’66, when I was there, Maxwell Taylor could come and speak and not be hooted off the stage. They actually had General [Lewis] Hershey, the head of the draft, on campus. There were some demonstrations, but they were, by later standards, pretty tame, so I really wasn’t affected much by it.\n\nThere is an interesting contrast, too, between those studying in the Soviet and east European arena and Sinologists. Most of the great teachers of Chinese history in the U.S., [John] Fairbank and others, were the children of missionaries, and they loved China. Most of the great early professors in Soviet and Russian history here in the U.S., after World War II, were émigrés who had fled Soviet Russia in the ’30s, and hated Russia and hated the Soviets, hated the Communists. Their students had a far more negative attitude toward the Soviet Union than Sinologists had toward China. It was an academic environment where the Communists were really bad guys and needed to be fought, as opposed to the Chinese side or Latin American studies or African studies, or any of the other regional studies.\n\nThe other side of it is that, both with respect to China and the Soviet Union, the relationships between faculty in those areas and CIA and the Defense Department were always different from the relationships and attitudes of faculty in other regions of the world. For example, on the Soviet economy, virtually everything that scholars had to work with came from CIA and from the work their economists were doing, and to a considerable extent the same thing on China in the early years. There was always a closer relationship, more funding, more acceptable attitudes toward accepting funding from the security departments of the government than was the case on Latin American studies, which were very anti-CIA. For Africa studies and Middle East studies, it was more dependent on the individual faculty member and the countries you were talking about.\n\nMy whole academic environment was in conservative universities and then, of course, my PhD was at Georgetown. It was different from people in other fields and students in other majors.\n\nEngel\n\nHow did you come to choose your specific dissertation topic, and what were the language resources and others that you brought to bear? And how much of that was out of intellectual interest versus what the CIA might find useful?\n\nGates\n\nWhen I started my PhD, the relationship between the Soviet Union and China in the late ’60s was probably closer to open conflict than the relationship with the United States. In fact, in February of ’68 or ’69, I can’t remember, was when they had the conflict on the Ussuri River. A number of Soviet soldiers were killed and then the Soviets massively retaliated against the Chinese. It was a big deal.\n\n[Anatoly] Dobrynin even approached the United States at one point to ask what our reaction would be to their use of nuclear weapons against China, so that was the environment in which Kissinger and [Richard] Nixon saw the opportunity to triangulate and be better friends with each of those two than they were with each other. What was your question again?\n\nEngel\n\nHow did you come to choose your specific topic—\n\nGates\n\nBecause the Sino-Soviet thing was so hot then, it just seemed to me that maybe—How could we get a better handle on how to interpret where the Soviets were in terms of their policies toward China? By reading the works of their academics? Since everything was so closely controlled, it was clear that when relations were in one place, there were things Soviet Sinologists could write about that in another time they couldn’t.\n\nA big deal, for example—and I can’t even remember the details of it at this point, going back into the 17th century and the Treaty of Nerchinsk or something—was about the Jesuits negotiating a peace, negotiating the border between Russia, the Russian empire and the Chinese empire. How they wrote about that had very direct relevance on the Russian Soviet claims, of 1968, ’69 about where the border was. I was intrigued, being at Georgetown, that the Jesuits had negotiated the treaty, because they were the only ones that spoke Russian and Chinese. Anyway, that’s how I picked up on that topic.\n\nI’d worked at CIA just long enough that by the time I was working on my dissertation in 1973, I’d learned how to write pretty succinctly, because I was writing for the President and stuff. I handed in my dissertation, and my advisor said, “This is really terrific but it’s—I really have no issues with it except it’s too short.” So I had to go back and pump about another 200 pages worth of air into this thing. Where I had quoted a sentence or two, I quoted a page. I just pumped this thing up. It’s as if you hefted it and said, “Well, the substance is fine, but it’s not big enough.”\n\nNelson\n\nWeighty subject, but the book itself doesn’t weigh enough.\n\nGates\n\nI have to say, though, as I was telling Keith [Hensley] the other day, when I was up for confirmation for the first time as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence in ’86, I got a call from a friend at the Georgetown library who said there were several journalists there reading my dissertation. To which my response was, “It serves them right.” [laughter]\n\nNelson\n\nIt’s interesting to me that already you had experience in at least three domains that later would be of relevance to your subsequent career, but in particular your tenure as Secretary of Defense. You’d been in the Air Force, you’d worked for CIA, you’d lived in Washington and put in there the work you did on NSC. That’s a range of acquaintanceship with various tribes, you might say, in the national security community. Can you think about things that in each of these domains stood you in good stead in terms of navigating the challenges of being Secretary?\n\nGates\n\nThe NSC experience was huge for me, and had a big impact both on my time as Deputy National Security Advisor, then as DCI [Director of Central Intelligence], and then as Secretary. There were several lessons that I took away from those years under Nixon, [Gerald] Ford, and [Jimmy] Carter. One was that I soon became just about the only intelligence officer in the government who actually understood how intelligence was used at the White House in decision making, because I was there and watched it.\n\nIt was symptomatic of CIA at the time that they did not see that as an asset for them. I tried to give them guidance in terms of how to be more helpful to the President. It’s little stuff, like you guys have your timetable for getting your papers done. The Presidential briefing book for a trip, an international trip, closes at a certain point. It may be the smartest, best, and most insightful analysis ever written, but if it’s an hour late, it’s toast. It’s in the wastebasket. If you don’t understand that kind of timing, if you don’t know when the book closes, if you’re not in close-enough touch with the people doing that stuff, your work may not only not be relevant, it may be too late to affect decision making.\n\nAnother big thing I learned was the costs of bureaucratic internecine warfare and how badly Presidents were served when agencies wrangled with one another, and particularly when it’s less over substance than over turf. But they confused the two, or obscured the fact that it was over turf and not over substance. I also learned a lot about running meetings and the consequences of interminable meetings that led nowhere, where there was nothing—no action at the end of the meeting, no decision, no action, no nothing—just an ongoing conversation, a “bull session,” if you will.\n\nThere were many lessons I took out of those years—a big factor for me that had a big impact when I became Secretary was that for most of my career the Secretaries of State and Defense hated each other. Israel nearly lost the Yom Kippur War because Kissinger and [James] Schlesinger weren’t speaking to one another and Schlesinger delayed resupply of the Israelis, which Kissinger was calling for. He delayed it because Kissinger was calling for it. [George] Shultz and [Caspar] Weinberger hated each other. Mel Laird and Kissinger, and before Kissinger [William] Rogers—Laird was probably the politically most canny Secretary the department ever had. As I wrote in my first book, if he couldn’t beat you in the White House, he’d beat you on the Hill. He’d just go around everybody.\n\nI watched, and I saw all that. I thought, This really isn’t good; this isn’t the way the system is supposed to work. That had big lessons for me in terms of how I would approach both Condi [Condoleezza] Rice and Hillary Clinton.\n\nNelson\n\nAs a junior officer—granted, you were in a specialized arena—were there things that gave you a sense, when you were Secretary, that you had a feel for how things worked further down the chain of command than most Secretaries ever did? I have a specific example in mind, but anything that comes to mind?\n\nGates\n\nNo, because the truth of the matter is—and it was one of the big surprises to me when I became Secretary—operational plans, contingency plans, those kinds of things from the Pentagon, were never shared with the White House except maybe at the most senior—Presidential, National Security Advisor level. They were never discussed in broader meetings. That was totally different by the time I became Secretary and it took me aback.\n\nJust to give you an example, during the Gulf War, 41 [George H. W. Bush] insisted that I go over to the Pentagon as Deputy National Security Advisor and review the bombing target lists with [Richard] Cheney. Go over to the Pentagon? Cheney and [Colin] Powell hated that. They fought it, and finally the President said, “No, it’s going to happen.”\n\nIt wasn’t that we suspected that they had mosques and hospitals and schools on the target list; it was that the President wanted to be in a position to assure himself so he could assure others that he was comfortable that we were not bombing any civilian targets in Iraq. But Cheney and Powell insisted on doing it with me themselves and resented every single second of it. That was totally different by the time I became Secretary.\n\nEngel\n\nLooking back now, are you happy with that evolution? Is that a good thing? During your time as Secretary of Defense, then, if there is more integration with the White House, on a lower operational level, that is, removing some of the fence around the turf of the Secretary of Defense, around the Pentagon, I well can understand Cheney’s and Powell’s concern.\n\nGates\n\nNo. When I became Secretary, I was more in their camp, and it mainly was because when you begin dealing with military operational plans, you’re dealing with the lives of troops—and the interagency and the White House leak like sieves. The Pentagon leaks as bad if not worse than anywhere else, but almost never about operational matters. It’s policy issues, programmatic issues, budget issues, turf fights, and stuff like that. There are almost never leaks about operational stuff.\n\nThe leaks about the [Osama] bin Laden raid all came from the White House and the CIA. I don’t think any of them came from the Department of Defense. Having all that stuff over there just is an opportunity for more leaks, and, as far as I was concerned, puts troops at risk, so I really fought against giving up too much detail when I was Secretary, most of the time not very successfully. But there had been a quantum change in the degree of centralization and micromanagement, in my view, by the NSC. It is reflected in the fact that when I was there, when I was last on the NSC as Deputy National Security Advisor, the NSC had maybe 50 professionals on it; today it has 350.\n\nDoug Lute’s operation on Afghanistan alone had 25 staffers. I told [Thomas] Donilon at the time, when you have 25 people at the NSC covering one country, they’re going to be spending too much of their time looking for stuff to do, and that’s when you get into micromanagement and into an NSC operational role, which I’ve always been totally opposed to. But the shift toward more micromanagement—Hillary ran into the same, and to a degree Condi—was much worse in the Obama administration than in the Bush administration. Hillary and I had a problem in common with the White House’s determination to run everything. I didn’t have that so much with [Stephen] Hadley as National Security Advisor and Condi and me in office in the Bush administration. It was not just a historical trend; it also had to do with specific Presidents.\n\nEngel\n\nIt’s interesting to me as a historian to hear you say that, because when I think of a centralized White House controlling foreign policy, the first name that comes to mind is Kissinger.\n\nGates\n\nI’ve written in my book that that was the greatest degree of centralized control since Nixon and Kissinger ruled the roost. But, in terms of the level of detail, it is significantly greater today than it was even under them. Then it was the two of them; it wasn’t the NSC staff. All the threads were in their hands, but it wasn’t in the hands of a GS-15 or a three-star on the NSC staff. It was in the hands of Kissinger, personally, and Nixon, personally. It was highly centralized, but it was also at a very high level, and that is one of the major changes.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nNelson\n\nDo you have anything that carries over from this morning?\n\nEngel\n\nYes. This is jumping ahead a little bit into the 1980s. First, I need you to describe your position in the last years of the [Ronald] Reagan administration. For the record, we were just talking about this in the car, where you stood vis-à-vis Soviet policy, the end of the Cold War, and the questions about where America was headed post–Iran-Contra in particular. Also, if you could relate that back to what we were discussing this morning, about how perhaps your training as a Soviet expert could have affected that thinking a decade later.\n\nGates\n\nI have to say, as I have done on so many other occasions for this, that there is a serious misreading of CIA’s analytical work on the Soviet Union. The reality is that every President from Richard Nixon on made policy toward the Soviet Union grounded in the perception of their growing economic crisis. The reason Nixon felt that they could be pressured into an arms control agreement was because of their economic difficulties. CIA didn’t miss that. The first briefing in which Ronald Reagan was told the Soviet regime could not survive, period, was just before his first meeting with [Mikhail] Gorbachev in the fall of ’85. Kay Oliver from CIA said the ancien régime cannot survive; the social alienation has become so great and the system is falling apart.\n\nIt was always easy to say the Soviet Union is going to collapse, like Senator [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan did. It is picking a date that gets hard.\n\nEngel\n\nThat was my next question.\n\nGates\n\nWhat I believed, and where I got it right, was that Gorbachev was dismantling the Stalinist economy, but because he wasn’t a capitalist and didn’t understand market forces, he had nothing to put in its place, and that led to the economic collapse of the early 1990s. Where I got it wrong was that I didn’t think he would move as fast as he did on foreign policy in terms of pulling the Soviet troops back from eastern Europe, in terms of telling the eastern European leaders you’re on your own, and so on.\n\nBut in terms of telling Presidents that this country is in trouble, the Agency did a great job. I use as the best example—it is in my first book—that when I became Deputy National Security Advisor in January of ’89, CIA’s reporting was so dire on the crisis in the Soviet Union that I received Bush 41’s permission the following July to create a very secret task force, or working group, to begin contingency planning for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Condi Rice led it. Two and a half years before Gorbachev fell, the Bush administration was beginning contingency planning on what it would need to do if that happened.\n\nWhile most in CIA and I saw the Soviet Union continuing to be very aggressive in its foreign policy—and I would say that continued until about 1987—they were still pumping huge amounts of money into Angola, into Cuba. At a time when they were dying economically, the annual subsidy to Cuba, both economic and military, was about $7 billion a year.\n\nThey kept this aggressive posture until about 1987. That’s when Gorbachev flipped the switch. That’s when they started pulling back. We were late in seeing that; there are no two ways about it. But on the domestic side, the Agency was on top from the very beginning, mainly concerning the reforms, because he couldn’t replace them with anything. I was very much a part of that, heading the analytical side of the Agency until ’86. Of course, we were dealing with many other problems as well. Then as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, I had less of a role in that. I had only been the deputy for six months when Iran-Contra broke and when [William] Casey had his tumor. It was an interesting time.\n\nEngel\n\nWhat lessons—This is broad question, but we want to move chronologically forward, since we know you’ve covered a lot of this material with your Bush 41 interview.\n\nGates\n\nThe biggest lesson for me for governance in terms of Iran-Contra was that it sort of built on LBJ [Lyndon B Johnson] picking targets in the Situation Room. It showed the extraordinary dangers of the White House and the NSC having an operational role of any kind, which was one of the reasons why I pushed back so hard in the Obama administration against that very thing, because I had seen the risks to the President and to the country of doing that. Personally, the biggest lesson that I took away from Iran-Contra was that I hadn’t done anything wrong, but I hadn’t done enough as the deputy.\n\nIn other words, I went to the general counsel of the Agency about it, but I didn’t go any further. I made Casey and me go tell [John] Poindexter what we thought was going on. Of course, we didn’t realize he was at the core of the thing. I thought that, having alerted the White House and having alerted the general counsel, I had done my job. What more could I have done? I might have quietly gone to the White House counsel, I might have quietly sat down with the Deputy Attorney General, but my knowledge level was basically at the same level as Shultz’s and Weinberger’s. Weinberger clearly knew a little more, which is why he was indicted. I would think to myself, Well, if Shultz is OK with this—I considered George Shultz to be a man of just the ultimate probity, integrity. If Shultz—He may disagree with it, but if he doesn’t think it’s wrong or illegal, I’ve probably done what I needed to do.\n\nThe only thing that [Lawrence] Walsh came after me for was that he claimed that I had been told about Iran-Contra a few weeks earlier than I said I knew about it. Never mind the fact that I told him that I might have been told earlier, but I just forgot. This is when it made an impact on me, or it was told to me. The guy who Walsh thinks told me, my deputy at the time, Dick Kerr, testified that it had probably been in one of these late-evening sessions where he had gone through a checklist of about 10 or a dozen things with me, kind of just checking them off. He said he could easily see why it might not have registered.\n\nIf I was defensively minded before Iran-Contra, I became absolutely paranoid afterward. The funny conundrum I never resolved was, on phone calls, whether I should have detailed notes or nothing at all. The worst thing of all is partial notes. But then, from a governance standpoint, it was keeping the NSC out of operational stuff.\n\nEngel\n\nWhat was your initial reaction, then, in terms of things like keeping notes or things like keeping other people in the loop on what you’re hearing, checking with your deputies, checking with your lawyers. What was the initial reaction in the first years then, after those 41 years? Did that evolve over time? Were you more paranoid in that period than you were in later years? Did you become more paranoid about these issues as you went along?\n\nGates\n\nActually, the circumstances were so different under 41, really, even in the Reagan administration. It shows the importance of individuals. Having Frank Carlucci and Colin Powell in the National Security Advisor’s office, having Ken Duberstein in the Chief of Staff’s office, it’s a totally different atmosphere and a totally different environment in terms of process and doing things the way they’re supposed to be done. In a way, the paranoia just became more personal, in the sense of never leaving a stone unturned.\n\nI don’t think after that, even as President of Texas A&M, I ever had a meeting with anybody that I didn’t have somebody else sit in.\n\nNelson\n\nMaybe this isn’t something you were thinking about at the time, but by the end of the Bush 41 Presidency, you had a chance to observe several Secretaries of Defense at work. Because our focus in these interviews is on your time as Secretary of Defense in the Bush Presidency, had you formed any notions of what makes for a good Secretary of Defense? What traps Secretaries of Defense might fall into? Anything that shaped the sense of the job you were stepping into?\n\nGates\n\nNo, I can’t honestly say that I did. I worked with the military and interacted with the Secretaries pretty routinely from 1986 to 1993, but it was always on policy issues and really never had anything to do with internal DoD [Department of Defense] issues. Although I knew a lot about military affairs at the 30,000-foot level, I really was no expert on the Pentagon or acquisition or any of those kinds of issues relating to the Defense Department. I just knew that Cheney had tried to cut two programs as Secretary: the A-12, which was still in litigation 20 years later; and the Osprey, which is still flying.\n\nNelson\n\nHow about the military in general?\n\nGates\n\nNot really. Again, I had very limited interaction, mainly with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, almost never with the service Chiefs themselves or the service Secretaries. Every now and then, I’d have an interaction with the Assistant Secretary covering intelligence matters. But other than that, very little contact.\n\nNelson\n\nHow about the Presidents that you worked with? Did you come away thinking, Here are the qualities a President needs to have, based on what I’ve observed?\n\nGates\n\nI would get this question all the time in speeches in 2012. When I would give speeches, in the Q&A [question and answer], I would say I have not found a better description of the ideal qualities of a President than the comment of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., about FDR [Franklin D. Roosevelt] in the early ’30s, when he said that Roosevelt had a second-rate intellect and a first-rate temperament. That’s what works best in the Presidency. If you look at George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, [Harry] Truman, [Dwight] Eisenhower, Reagan, and 41, that is the characteristic of all of them.\n\nThe smartest Presidents—Carter, [Woodrow] Wilson, [William] Clinton—have generally not been distinguished Presidents. It is these guys who have enough self-confidence to admit that they don’t have all the answers and to admit that they don’t—because I guess I put myself in the same category. They’re not experts; they’re not the smartest guy in the room, but they are the smartest guy in the room in terms of eliciting other people’s views and then integrating those in their minds into policy and figuring out how to communicate it, if not to the American people in general, at least to the people working for them.\n\nPresidents who have always been the smartest kid in the room have a hard time doing that.\n\nEngel\n\nThis might be splitting hairs, but I don’t know that I would have put Theodore Roosevelt on that list as a person who was confident, eliciting other opinions, and not thinking that he was the smartest person in the room. Perhaps it is a question only a historian would care about, but why would you put Roosevelt there?\n\nGates\n\nI did because I didn’t think he was a first-rate intellect [laughter], and second, he had a great temperament, which was obviously very appealing. My subordinate descriptions of what comes under that umbrella may not fit all of them equally, but, in terms of just what Holmes said, he fits. It is pretty audacious to tell that to two Presidential scholars.\n\nEngel\n\nWe’ll talk about it over tomorrow’s lunch. Actually, if you don’t mind, this is going somewhat chronologically out of order, but one of the things that is striking to me about your time coming to the NSC, starting in ’89, and then your time coming back into the Pentagon in 2006, is that they’re both preceded by arguably the two biggest foreign policy studies that we can think of from the last 25 years: the Iran-Contra Commission and then the Iraq Study Group. Given that General Scowcroft played such an integral role, to my mind, in writing the Iran-Contra report [Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran/Contra Affair] and then moving directly into government, and then your being integral in the Iraq Study Group and then moving into government, did you take any lessons from what you saw from him in ’88, ’89, when you began working on a larger commission? Obviously, you didn’t know that you were going to be Secretary of Defense subsequently.\n\nGates\n\nNo, because I really was completely on the periphery when Brent was working on that with [John] Tower and company. In a way, Brent probably didn’t learn very much from doing the Iran-Contra study, apart from having it reinforce everything he already believed about how the NSC ought to operate and how important it is to tell a President what he needs to hear.\n\nThe only thing that really helped me about the Iraq Study Group was that I was able to pretty well hit the ground running in terms of what was going on in Iraq and the problems that we faced. That might have taken me some months to get up to speed, or at least some weeks, had I not been a part of the Iraq Study Group. It gave me the opportunity to meet a lot of the key figures, both Iraqis and Americans, and particularly military, that I would be dealing with when I became Secretary.\n\nI don’t think it helped much in terms of my approach to the job as much as it did helping me be substantively on top of my biggest problem when I became Secretary.\n\nEngel\n\nI want to delve into this more again chronologically as we get to it, but here’s one question I want to ask in response to what you just said. If Scowcroft did not find anything in ’87–’88, that really would have—As you said, it only reinforced what he already believed. Was there anything when you were involved in the Iraq Study Group that was shocking to you, or did things reinforce what you believed? As you said, you got more depth, more information, but was there anything that fundamentally was shocking to you?\n\nGates\n\nI don’t think “shocking.” Again, in the idea of reinforcing and filling in, a lot of what I saw during the Iraq Study Group reinforced what I had already believed about monumental mistakes made in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. It filled that out to where it was beyond just an opinion to really understanding the breadth of the problems we had faced and that we had created for ourselves.\n\nNelson\n\nWe’re about at the point of the George W. Bush Presidency, but before we go into that, I wonder if there are aspects of your career prior to that point that we passed over that we shouldn’t have passed over, or that you’d like to talk about in greater depth?\n\nGates\n\nNo, it is something that we talked about earlier. That is, the benefit to me on becoming Secretary of Defense of having spent almost nine years at the White House and the NSC and watching the interagency—knowing where its strengths and its weaknesses were, knowing what created problems and created resentments, and what tended to diminish them, so I was able to avoid a lot of land mines coming in as a newcomer after an absence of 13 years.\n\nThe interesting thing, in a way that ill prepared me for the job, was that both as an NSC staffer and then as Deputy National Security Advisor for all that time, I had very little to do with Congress. I had very little interaction with Congress. What I had had between ’86 and ’89, shall we say, wasn’t a glorious experience.\n\nOne of the things I’ve reflected on, one of the huge differences between January ’93 and December ’06, was that there were, still, in January of ’93, when it came to foreign policy issues, significant vestiges of bipartisanship. In other words, Les Aspin played a big role in the House approving going to war in the Gulf because he thought it was the right thing for the country. Never mind that the Democratic caucus then denied him his chairmanship and he had to go crawling back and so on. They were still able to reach across party lines on some things, but particularly on national security. That had almost entirely dissipated by the time I came back.\n\nEngel\n\nAs a person outside of politics through that interim largely, what did you ascribe that to?\n\nGates\n\nIt depends on whether you talk to Republicans or Democrats. [laughter] But it mostly happened in the House. Some people will say that it began with Newt Gingrich going after Jim Wright and the viciousness with which that took place. Others will say that it was the impeachment of Clinton. Others will say the cumulative effect of the Democrats controlling the House for 40-some years and the arrogance with which they did that and then the Republicans’ determination to take revenge when they finally got a majority.\n\nBut the thing that really began in the early ’90s was the steady erosion of the numbers—my best examples are in the Senate—of the people—center-left, center-right—that I regarded as bridge builders. David Boren called me in early ’94. He had been invited to become president of Oklahoma [University] and he was wrestling with it. He asked me to come down to his Senate office to talk about it. We talked for an hour. At the end I said, “David, there is an easy solution to your dilemma here. When you’re in your car or on an airplane and daydreaming, are you daydreaming about what you can accomplish at OU [Oklahoma University] or what you can accomplish in the Senate?” He just burst out laughing. He said, “That makes it easy.”\n\nSo you lost in fairly short order Bill Cohen, Sam Nunn, David Boren, Bill Bradley, and then over time Jack Danforth, Bob Dole, Nancy Kassebaum, a number of moderate Democrats, of additional Democrats. More and more from both parties, even in the Senate, which is less polarized than the House, all those guys from the center were disappearing. Olympia Snowe is the most recent. It’s not because any of them were in danger of not being reelected. They were just fed up; they were tired and frustrated because there was nothing happening.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you play any role during the 2000 campaign?\n\nGates\n\nZip. For the 2000 election, staying in chronological order, the answer is no. Despite having worked closely with Condi and Steve Hadley and company, I never got one call, never was asked for my opinion about anything, never had any contact with them.\n\nAfter the election, or while it was still being disputed, I called Condi Rice to make one suggestion, I said, “Condi, I don’t want a job. I don’t have anybody to recommend for a job. I just have one piece of advice for you. Whatever you do, don’t give Paul Wolfowitz an operational role, because he can’t manage his way out of a paper bag.” So of course they gave him the biggest managerial role in the government. That’s the extent of my influence.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you base that assessment on?\n\nGates\n\nWatching Paul in the Deputies Committee and as Under Secretary for Policy throughout the 41 administration.\n\nNelson\n\nThat’s pretty specific, if you’re going to make your first contact, for it to be about one person.\n\nGates\n\nYes, and I actually liked Paul and I used Paul as a resource when I was doing some consulting in the ’90s. I had nothing against Paul. People need to understand that people have strengths and they have weaknesses. Paul was a great Under Secretary for Policy, but if the role of the deputy is to be the day-to-day manager of the Pentagon, that is totally wrong. Especially when you have a guy like Don Rumsfeld, who is very policy oriented himself. It was putting twins in there in the sense that they both were policy guys. Paul was a disaster as an operational manager—as deputy.\n\nNelson\n\nWas the occasion for the call that you had heard some—\n\nGates\n\nI was reading that he was being rumored to head CIA, which I thought would be a really big catastrophe. I just said, “There are a lot of roles Paul can fill, but that isn’t it.”\n\nNelson\n\nWhy do you think you didn’t get any calls during the campaign?\n\nGates\n\nBecause I was a senior member of 41’s team, and because everybody knew I was close to 41. I was at that time the interim dean of the George H. W. Bush School and people who had been close to the father were absolutely kept totally at arm’s length. They didn’t want any—43 [George W. Bush] himself didn’t want anything to do with the people who had been close to his father; he wanted to be his own man.\n\nEngel\n\nThat leads to my follow-on question: Did you understand that as 43 wanting to put a public face on his own independence, or was there a policy and ideological schism or difference that you perceived?\n\nGates\n\nIt was both. He very much wanted to be and be seen as totally independent of his father’s advisors. The last thing he wanted was a story about how he was relying on his father’s advisors. But I also think he considered himself tougher and more idealistic than his father. All these pragmatic realists around his father were not part of who he was running as: Scowcroft, Baker, me.\n\nNelson\n\nDo you remember when you first met George W. Bush?\n\nGates\n\nIt was a photo op at the state capitol. He did these one-day seminars for all the senior people in state government, elected and appointed, mainly appointed. He showed up, the Lieutenant Governor showed up, and so on. I was asked to moderate one part of that.\n\nA part of the deal was that several of us went up to the Governor’s office and had our pictures taken with him. When I interviewed with him in November of ’06 was the first conversation I’d ever had with the man.\n\nNelson\n\nReally? So you didn’t really have an impression of him based even on your Texas experience?\n\nGates\n\nI had a very good impression of him as Governor when I was at the Bush School.\n\nNelson\n\nBased on?\n\nGates\n\nA bunch of things, the fact that he received 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. His partner was Bob Bullock, a Democrat, the Lieutenant Governor. He had forged a really great partnership with this guy. There was a lot of bipartisanship in things they were doing in state government. Bullock, ironically, had the greater power. The Lieutenant Governor in Texas has more power than the Governor. The way they worked together—Just on a superficial level, he seemed to me to be a good Governor.\n\nEngel\n\nWhat had you heard at that point? We’re talking in the period around 1999–2000. From the people that you knew, Condoleezza Rice and others, with whom you had worked before, what were they telling you? You mentioned you didn’t have any policy—\n\nGates\n\nI didn’t have any connections to speak of. I had one or two contacts with Condi, but only because she was on the Advisory Board of the Bush School at the time. Whatever contact I had other than this one call was maybe two or three calls having to do with the Bush School. That was it.\n\nNelson\n\nPrior to 9/11 [September 11, 2001], how did you think he was doing?\n\nGates\n\n[pause] This is very impressionistic, but it seemed to me he was sort of adrift. There didn’t seem to be a theme to the pudding at that point, but it was very superficial, because that was the last six months I was at the Bush School. I was moving back out here. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t paying much attention.\n\nNelson\n\nYou must have known Powell, Rumsfeld, et cetera—Rice, obviously. All these people.\n\nGates\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nWho better to have an informed opinion about whether these were good people? Were they a good team? Were the ways in which they interacted with the President good, functional, or not?\n\nGates\n\nThe big surprise to me was Rumsfeld, his appointment. I felt that Bush had to know what Rumsfeld had done to his dad in the mid-’70s, in terms of seeing Bush as a potential rival in ’80. How do you sideline him? You get him to go to CIA, because nobody will ever be elected President who was Director of CIA. [William] Colby was booted, the space became available, and Bush went in there. Bush basically had to tell the Congress he’s out of politics forever because they questioned him pretty closely about that.\n\nEngel\n\nCan I push on that for a second? Again, I’m trying to get you to think about your thoughts during this time period and not the personal interactions you had with some of these players later. You mentioned that the W. [George W. Bush] camp in the 2000 election was trying to create distance between themselves and the 41 crowd. This appointment of Rumsfeld is the classic example after the election, of course, of, as you put it, really sticking it to the 41 crowd in many ways. Yet there are two key moments that Bush 43 turns to the 41 crowd, almost for validation in many ways, or for solace. The first being the selection of Senator Cheney to be the Vice President, and the second being the selection of Jim Baker to run the—what was he called?\n\nNelson\n\nPostelection campaign—\n\nEngel\n\nPostelection campaign manager. Just from the outside, did you make anything of that? What were your thoughts on that?\n\nGates\n\nI don’t know the thinking. I didn’t have any thinking about Cheney. Cheney was very much in line with the more ideological, harder line that Bush 43 wanted to take and that the “Vulcans” represented, as opposed to the realists under his father. Then the Baker choice, as far as I’m concerned, that was just 43 being smart enough to go for the best, most ruthless possible person in order to win the Presidency. There I think he just went purely for talent and skill. This is not something he wanted to leave in the hands of a beginner. [laughter]\n\nEngel\n\nIt may not have been intimate or even friendly, but did you have—Describe, if you will, your interactions with the Vulcan crowd during the ’90s, the late ’90s in particular.\n\nGates\n\nI really didn’t have any.\n\nEngel\n\nNone at all? Did you have an impression?\n\nGates\n\nWhen I moved out here I kind of just—I move through life in pieces. I don’t drag a lot of former life along with me. I would have a rare telephone call, say, with Condi, or I would maybe encounter Hadley or some of these guys at the Aspen Strategy Group or something like that. In all honesty, I made little effort to stay in touch with them and vice versa.\n\nEngel\n\nLet me ask about the issues then, because one of the key issues obviously is Iraq. That is animating a lot of the interest among this group. What was your sense of U.S.-Iraqi policy in the late ’90s?\n\nGates\n\nI had the sense that the effectiveness of the sanctions was steadily eroding and particularly around ’98, ’99, when Saddam [Hussein] threw the inspectors out. From a distance, it looked to me like he was trying to reconstitute those programs. That was clearly the message he was sending everybody.\n\nI like to point out to people to go back to the UN [United Nations] Resolution 1441. If ever there were doubts in foreign intelligence services about what Saddam was doing, that would have been the time where you would have had a real fight in the Security Council, but instead you have the Russians, the Chinese, the French, all going along. Every intelligence service in the world believed he was doing what he said he was doing, and partly because that was a deception that he was trying to continue, largely vis-à-vis his own military and people, but also vis-à-vis Iran. In my book, I went back through my stuff and I gave a speech six weeks after the invasion saying the situation in Iraq reminds me a little bit of the dog that catches the car: Now what are we going to do with it?\n\nThe bottom line of what I said in there, interestingly enough, was that if we have 100,000 troops in Iraq six months from now, we’re in trouble. We need to turn this over to somebody else, international peacekeepers or somebody, as fast as possible, but in the lead-up, I didn’t have any different view than anybody else.\n\nEngel\n\nLet me unpack that for a second, for the record. When you say you had no different view than anyone else in the lead-up, are you referring to the lead-up to the 2003 invasion?\n\nGates\n\nYes.\n\nEngel\n\nOK. For the record, can you tell us what your thoughts were during that period?\n\nGates\n\nI was just watching the continued erosion. The irony is that the erosion of the sanctions, the power of the sanctions, was as the French, the Germans, the Russians, and everybody else was trying to do contracts and deals with Saddam. I saw the sanctions, essentially, as falling apart and thereby creating the opportunity for Saddam to reconstitute those programs if he chose to do so.\n\nNelson\n\nHow did you learn about 9/11?\n\nGates\n\nI was on an airplane.\n\nNelson\n\nTell the story.\n\nGates\n\nI was on my way to a board meeting in Cleveland. The pilot comes on and says, “Both World Trade towers have been blown up and every aircraft in America is being grounded. We are landing in Kansas City.” That was about 15 minutes away. We landed on the tarmac. I was on a TWA [Trans-World Airlines] flight and at Kansas City International Airport, one of TWA’s major hubs in those days. We actually had a gate, but there must have been two dozen big planes on the ground, just out on the tarmac, that had just landed.\n\nWe went right up to the gate. The gate agent got on a little microphone—I was sitting in first class and the gate agent said, “Now if you’ll all proceed from the airplane to the ticketing desk, we will proceed to reticket you,” blah, blah, blah. I thought to myself, Every airplane in America has been grounded? There ain’t anybody going anywhere for a while. Instead, I went to the hotel desk and reserved a room at the airport Marriott. That was on Tuesday. I didn’t get out of there until Friday, when I rented a car and drove to Denver, where I could get a plane back to Seattle.\n\nI camped out in the Marriott for two and a half or three days. But every time I needed something, I’d agree to do an interview with Fox or CNN [Cable News Network] or somebody. They’d send a limo out to the hotel to pick me up. We’d go in, I’d do the interview, and on the way back, I’d ask them to stop by the Rite-Aid or CVS or grocery store, ATM [automatic teller machine], or whatever.\n\nNelson\n\nThe interviews were surely, “What should we do? What do we do?” What were your thoughts as they unfolded?\n\nGates\n\nI’ll be honest with you; I hardly remember. It was pretty quickly identified as al-Qaeda. My general thinking was that these guys have been at war against us for eight years and we’ve just discovered we’re at war with them, because they hit us beginning in 1993 at the World Trade Center and the embassies, the Cole, Khobar Towers. I went through that: We’re living in a different kind of world. These guys have the capacity to do bad things, really bad things.\n\nNelson\n\nOver the weeks that followed, how did you assess the performance of the Bush administration?\n\nGates\n\nThe easiest way to look at it is that I didn’t have any issues with any of it. I probably felt like they were doing a pretty good job, under the circumstances. I thought at the time, because there was a lot of commentary, at the time and since: People have not given proper credit, or proper weight, to the personal impact on all these people, that of having been in charge and having let the country down and the sense of utter fear they felt that something else was coming and coming quickly.\n\nThat was aggravated by the fact that, because the dots hadn’t been connected, all the filters that differentiate quality of intelligence reports—from rumor mongering to intercepts—all those filters were removed, so all of the intelligence about threats was coming into the White House with no filters. They then had, every day, reports of imminent attacks with nuclear weapons on Washington, New York, LA [Los Angeles], and Chicago. Those were just flooding into the White House. They were just buried in threats.\n\nThey were in an environment where for many months they were expecting another attack, another really big attack. People haven’t appreciated the impact of that on these individuals as human beings and the sense of responsibility they felt for their failure to protect Americans. This was the first successful, foreign-based attack with loss of life on the continental United States since the War of 1812.\n\nThat’s a point I would make in speeches all the time. The other point I would make, and still make, is this: Who thought, on September 12th, that we would go more than 10 years without another successful attack? Nobody believed that. All Americans believed there was going to be another attack. Much of what has been written about those months and the interrogations and the wiretaps and all those things was a manifestation of the belief that the country was at war, was under attack, and we were going to be attacked again, and how you prevent that.\n\nI put some of the things that were done in the same category as Lincoln lifting habeas corpus, Roosevelt interning the Japanese. There was a fear for the survival of the nation. They were determined to do whatever they could to prevent it.\n\nEngel\n\nLet me preface this question by saying I would only ask this to another professionally trained historian. You’re telling us that assessment in 2013, after having time to reflect and time out of service as well. At what point do you think, between 2001 and two minutes ago, did that sense that the personal failure of the administration to prevent an attack, did you begin to perceive that within the administration on a personal level? Did the people tell you this? Did you—\n\nGates\n\nIt was almost immediate.\n\nEngel\n\nReally?\n\nGates\n\nBecause I’d been there. I’d been the Deputy National Security Advisor; I’d been the Director of CIA. I was thinking to myself, What would I be feeling if I were in their shoes today, September 12, 2001? It is just this huge burden of failure, that thousands of people lost their lives because I didn’t do my job right and a bunch of other people didn’t do their jobs right. What’s wrong with us? How do we fix this and how do we fix it overnight? A big chunk of what I just said two minutes ago I believed from almost the very beginning. I guess I was very sympathetic to them for all those same reasons.\n\nEngel\n\nLet me follow up on this for a second. Aside from the things that were in the headlines—the Cole attack and the embassy attacks and what not—had you given a lot of thought to al-Qaeda as a problem in the interim? Could you speak to that?\n\nGates\n\nThere were two levels of strategic intelligence failure. There was the specific, and I think there was a broader, deeper, lack of understanding of Islamic fundamentalism. I remember when I was on the NSC and either right before or right after the Islamic revolution in Iran, the then Deputy National Security Advisor, David Aaron, wrote, “Ask CIA for their assessment of Islamic fundamentalism.” The CIA came back and said they didn’t have anything. We didn’t know anything.\n\nHere they’d just taken over Iran, with huge strategic implications. That level of ignorance continued certainly until 1993, but even then—The reality is that on 9/11 we didn’t know jack shit about al-Qaeda. That’s the reason a lot of this stuff happened and the interrogations and everything else, because we didn’t know anything. If we’d had a great database and knew exactly what al-Qaeda was all about, what their capabilities were and stuff like that, some of these measures wouldn’t have been necessary. But the fact is that we’d just been attacked by a group we didn’t know anything about. In a way, the failure to appreciate Islamic fundamentalism is a far more valid criticism of the intelligence community in the ’80s and ’90s than the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nEngel\n\nWhat do you ascribe the failure to? There are many theories circulating around that perhaps this was simply a generational shift, that people who had been trained as Soviet specialists were just not thinking in the ’90s about other parts of the word.\n\nGates\n\nI’ll reveal a bias of mine: area experts, country experts, are sometimes the very last ones to see a revolutionary change coming, because the history of most countries is a history of continuity. In discontinuity, they find too many reasons why that won’t happen.\n\nThe guy who was covering Iran, the senior analyst on Iran, in 1979, had spent 20 years working on Iran. He spoke Farsi. This was not some sort of liberal arts generic analyst; this was a real expert, and he and everybody else missed it.\n\nWhen I was head of the analytical side of the CIA, I set up a separate group called global issues. They were to look, not from a country aspect in terms of looking at terrorism, but to look at the factors that give rise to terrorism and discontinuities and to develop metrics. How can you gauge when the temperature is rising on certain issues and among certain elements of the population and so on? I’m not sure whether it contributed very much or not, but it was a different way to come at my concern that the area experts are very often the last to realize that a revolution is about to take place.\n\nWe totally misread the Arab spring. The Arab spring is all about revolution. As a result, the consequences are going to be with us for a hell of a long time. Arab spring sort of connotes reform, the flowering of reform and the building of institutions and sort of all peace and good will and is mainly bullshit. [laughter]\n\nI realized later, and it would have been politically controversial, CIA should have had sections working on religious issues, because the truth is that we have serious international problems being created by Christian fundamentalism, Jewish fundamentalism, Hindu fundamentalism, and Islamic fundamentalism. But tell me if I would like to go up and testify about that on the Hill.\n\nEngel\n\nEven after the Helsinki Accords and the greater emphasis on human rights, with religious rights being among them, there was no sense of that in the CIA?\n\nGates\n\nNo sense of studying extreme forms of religion and what the potential consequences are of that. It’s a pretty touchy subject for the American government, right up there with monitoring student groups. [laughter]\n\nNelson\n\nI was thinking when you were talking about it with empathy, the sense of responsibility that people in the administration must have felt. You’ve been there, so you knew what that was like, but you were not there at the time. Did you have any occasion to reach out to people you knew in the White House and provide words of whatever: comfort, insight, advice?\n\nGates\n\nNo. In fact, I remember vividly saying to somebody in 2004 or 2005 that during the second Clinton administration I had gotten one call from Madeleine Albright. I remember saying to somebody, well into the Bush administration, as I say, in 2004, that at that point I’d gotten one more call from Madeleine Albright than I had gotten from the Bush administration.\n\nIn 2004, I was totally opposed to the Intelligence Reform Act. I wrote a 16-page paper to Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins, the co-chairs of this effort in the Senate, the government, operations, whatever it is, detailing why the new law won’t work. It didn’t matter; they passed it, and the President signed it.\n\nYou can imagine then my astonishment when I got a call in early January 2005 from Hadley, asking me if I’d be willing to consider being DNI [Director of National Intelligence], the first DNI. It was clear that having passed the law and recognizing it was unworkable, they had decided among themselves there was only one person who could try to make the unworkable work. That was the first time they had reached out to me for anything.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you tell them?\n\nGates\n\nI really struggled with it. By then I was president of A&M. I flew back to D.C. [District of Columbia]—It was Monday before the inauguration—and spent several hours with Hadley and [Andrew] Card. They were willing to give me everything I wanted. Among other things, the law did not empower the DNI to fire the head of a single intelligence agency and yet he was responsible for all of them, so we worked that out. We worked our way through a lot of these things, and they basically gave me everything I wanted. I still have the file of exchanges between them and me and faxes and emails of what I was demanding and what they were prepared to give.\n\nBut they made a mistake that Monday in the White House that no car salesman would ever make; they let me off the lot without closing the sale. [laughter] I went back to A&M and we went back and forth for the rest of the week. The President went to Camp David after the inaugural and I was to call Andy Card on Monday and give him my final decision. I’m pretty sure they thought I was going to take it, and I thought I was going to take it.\n\nI took a walk around campus that Sunday night, smoked a cigar. I concluded I didn’t want to fight with Don Rumsfeld for the next four years, but mostly I didn’t feel like I had gotten far enough on my agenda at A&M. I really did not want to go back to Washington and I did not want to leave A&M, particularly with so much started but not done.\n\nI called Card on Monday and told him I wouldn’t do it. He was just stunned, because they thought it was a done deal. I told my wife after that, “The good news is we’re safe now, because this administration will never ask me to do another thing.” As I put it, another great analytical moment.\n\nNelson\n\nThe President, there was never any moment in this process—\n\nGates\n\nThis is where they screwed it up, because if I’d been doing it, toward the end of this meeting at the White House, I’d have orchestrated for the President to come down the hall, throw those guys out of the office, sit down, put his hand on my shoulder or on my knee, and say, “I need you to do this for the country.” There is no saying no to the President under those circumstances. But they never brought the President in to me.\n\nNelson\n\nDo you have any sense of why not?\n\nGates\n\nThe same thing happened a little bit with the Secretary of Defense job. The White House has gotten itself into this situation—and this isn’t the only White House—where they cannot tolerate the idea of somebody telling the President no directly. They want a firm answer before the conversation with the President, so that the President never gets surprised or never gets turned down. It’s bullshit, because there’s a certain category of appointee where you’re not going to get him if the President doesn’t make the ask, and sometimes even he is going to get turned down.\n\nThe irony is both Obama and I were turned down by John Hamre. We both talked to Hamre about being Deputy Secretary under me and John turned us both down. But in this case, and I don’t know whether it is peculiar to the Bush administration, because I wasn’t involved in that many appointments when I was in government before, but they didn’t involve the President.\n\nBut regarding Secretary of Defense, Hadley called me and asked me if I’d do it and then two days later [Joshua] Bolten called me and asked me if I’d do it, sort of just to make sure.\n\nEngel\n\nLet me delve in here for an instant, because this is actually something that has always been a puzzle for me, because I remember quite clearly being at A&M when you announced you were leaving to become Secretary of Defense. You may recall you gave a talk at the Bush School. In fact, I’m sure you don’t recall, but we went out to dinner that night and you said time and again that when the President of the United States asks you to do something, the answer is yes.\n\nWhen you were having this first conversation about becoming DNI and you pointed out that the President at that point did not walk down the hall, is that splitting hairs a little bit? Because it seems to me that clearly the President of the United States is asking you when his Chief of Staff is asking you? Explain that difference to me.\n\nGates\n\nI probably overstated when I was talking to the class or said that, because there were other factors on the DNI decision. First, I’d already done that. The truth is that the way they’d written the law, I felt like I had had a stronger position as DCI than I would as DNI, and why the hell would I want to come back and just fight all the time with everybody. That was a big part of it for me, as well as this sense of unfinished business at A&M.\n\nTo be honest with you, I had felt for a long time, because every now and then people would talk about me for National Security Advisor and stuff like that, that I had no interest in that. I told my wife, “There are only two jobs that I would ever go back to D.C. for, and the good news is, nobody is ever going to offer me either one of them.” That was State and Defense.\n\nNelson\n\nWhy wouldn’t you want to be National Security Advisor?\n\nGates\n\nWhy? Those guys work all the time; they put up with all that bullshit in the White House, all those Presidential and staff egos. No thanks. I’ve been there, done that, got the t-shirt. That’s why, when Hadley called in October of ’06, the answer was an immediate yes as opposed to the two weeks of wrestling with the DNI job.\n\nEngel\n\nBecause it was a job you had already put in the category that you would be interested in?\n\nGates\n\nWe’re jumping ahead a little bit, but as I put it to Hadley, it was very simple. It was a very simple conversation. He said, “If the President asked you, would you agree to become Secretary of Defense?”\n\nI said, “Steve, we have kids out there fighting and dying and doing their duty; how could I not do mine if the President asked? So the answer is yes.”\n\nNelson\n\nBack to the DNI appointment: Is it possible that you weren’t being offered the job; you were being offered the job with a 99 percent certainty that your meeting with the President would not reveal some fundamental difference of temperament or whatever?\n\nGates\n\nNo, there was never any question. They were clearly going back and forth with him, because the authorities I was asking for they couldn’t deliver; only the President could deliver.\n\nNelson\n\nSince we’ve already tiptoed across the line into your Secretary of Defense experience, is there anything between the period we just covered and the time you got that call from Steve Hadley? Is there anything in those intervening years that we’re overlooking here that would be relevant to your service in the Bush administration?\n\nGates\n\nWell, I learned a lot at Texas A&M—\n\nNelson\n\nOh, please, go with that.\n\nGates\n\n—that contributed to my success as Secretary. Dealing with faculties, dealing with deans—although the Texas legislature wasn’t the Congress—kept my skills honed in terms of dealing with legislators, how you get things done in a big organization. I’d done a lot as DCI in a relatively short period of time, so the A&M experience built on that, but I would say strengthened my skills in managing a huge, diverse organization that was culturally resistant to change, and in terms of how you bring people along, and make them your allies in an effort, even when their own ox is being gored—I would leave it at that. The A&M experience—I was a significantly better Secretary of Defense having led a big university than I would have been otherwise.\n\nNelson\n\nTell us about some of the things you learned about managing a huge, diverse institution with a culture resistant to change. What did you learn that worked in that setting?\n\nGates\n\nI started doing that at CIA.\n\nNelson\n\nWell, begin there.\n\nGates\n\nIt is fundamentally that in all these very diverse organizations, for all practical purposes, everybody has tenure, so no matter who you are, if you don’t get buy-in from those people, any change you try to bring will either never occur or will be so much an alien graft that it is rejected the second you leave. This is the subject of my second book, by the way, how you lead change in big public institutions, big public bureaucracies.\n\nWhat I learned is that the leader has to set the goals, preferably in consultation with the professionals. Even when it came to the goals at A&M, there was a lot of dialogue with the deans and with faculty and so on. There had been a huge effort before I came to A&M, under my predecessor, to identify what it would take to move A&M into the top 20 public universities by the year 2020. It was a big effort. They had identified 11 things that needed to be accomplished; they called them imperatives.\n\nThe first thing about being a leader is to know you can only accomplish three or four really big things, not 11, not 12, maybe two or three or four, so my dialogue with the deans at Texas A&M and the faculty went like this: of these 11, which will have a more dramatically leveraging effect on the others, so that if we focus on these three or four it will enable the rest? Elevating the faculty was one; academic buildings was another. The graduate program was another, and diversity was the fourth. Those became the four pillars of everything I did at A&M. It was focused on those. It was a product of the dialogue, with my provost at my side, with all the deans and all these people. What are the goals we should focus on here? What will have the most—\n\nMy challenge was easier at CIA, because six weeks after I became Director, the Soviet Union collapsed. The goal at CIA and the intelligence community became very straightforward: How do we reorient this massive intelligence community away from a singular focus on the Soviet Union and the Cold War to a much more diverse set of problems in the world? When I arrived at Defense, it was this: What do we have to do to be successful in Iraq and then Afghanistan, including what do we have to do to better support the troops?\n\nWhen I was kept on by Obama, then it was a very wide broadening of the aperture. How do we restructure the Defense Department for the future so we’re able to take on a wide and unpredictable scale, range of military challenges premised on the reality that for 40 years our record in predicting where we would use military force next was perfect; we had never once gotten it right. There wasn’t a single instance: Grenada, Panama, Iraq twice, Afghanistan, Libya twice, Haiti, the Balkans. In not one instance did we know six months before we would have troops deployed and in action in those places.\n\nHow do you develop a military that isn’t focused on fighting two big regional wars but a military that is trained and equipped to be maximally versatile across the broadest possible range of conflict? How do you restructure the budget in a period when you know the budget is going to go to hell? How do you restructure the budget to take money out of overhead, out of tail, and put it into tooth? How do you show the Congress and the American people we actually can do this, do hard things?\n\nThe agendas in each of these three institutions were shaped in that way. At CIA and at Defense, they were fairly self-evident. At A&M, it was more of a collaborative process. But then at the next level it was OK, now you have the goals. How do you get there? That’s where bringing everybody in mattered.\n\nJust to give one example, on the budget, on the efficiencies exercise, as Secretary of Defense in 2010, where we cut $178 billion out of overhead, over a four-month period I had 60 meetings ranging from two hours to eight hours. Both at A&M and as DCI, I used task forces. Here’s the task: We’re going to restructure the National Reconnaissance Office. Here is the chair of the task force. The task force is a broad range of people from across the entire intelligence community.\n\nThen I did something unprecedented. When they issued their report and the recommendations, I made it available to anybody in the community who wanted to read it and invited comments. Then when I did a decision memo, I made it available, in draft, to anybody who wanted to comment on it. Today I would do all that online; we didn’t have the capacity to do it, but the drafts were easily available.\n\nI wanted the maximum possible input. I wanted everybody to feel that they’d had a shot at being a part of the process, because even if you don’t participate, if you’ve had the chance to participate, it makes it a hell of a lot tougher for you to come back later and complain. The result was, in every one of these instances, there was great buy-in.\n\nAt A&M, I used task forces. Every single task force had faculty and students on it, as well as administrators and sometimes outsiders and so on. The key was how to get people on board. I used those very same techniques at the Department of Defense. At A&M, controversial issues would come up that were very important for the faculty and not very important to anybody else. For example—You may remember this—a big issue came up about a living wage.\n\nThe truth is, A&M paid pretty well and was the economic backbone of the community. But there was a strong group of people in the faculty and in the administration, among the university staff, that felt we needed to raise the wages. I did then what I would do multiple times in the Defense Department: to buy time, I directed a review. I did this with don’t ask, don’t tell. I did it with several issues, including the Iraq War. I put faculty members, local citizens, staff members, and everybody on it to first let the passions cool. At least I was doing something. Let the passions cool. Get the data together. We actually ended up raising the overall salaries a little bit for the staff, so it led to a positive result.\n\nThe issue went away, and didn’t bankrupt the university, but the idea of buying time to look at an issue and let passions cool I would use time and again in the Defense Department, but I first used it at Texas A&M. Those are some examples.\n\nNelson\n\nIt’s fascinating. Let’s have a short break.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nGates\n\nThere are two other things, including another technique I first used at A&M and then used at Defense. There is nothing that makes an impression and sends a message to an important constituency in a big institution, particularly constituencies that are accustomed to being ignored, like the faculty, as to have them make a suggestion and for you to say, “That’s a hell of a good idea, let’s just do it.”\n\nI did that when the faculty recommended—apropos of this living wage thing—forming a staff council. Mainly it was a draw on my time, but it was a chance for staff to present their issues and have a dialogue with the president of the university. I said, “Sure, there’s absolutely no downside to this except it costs me a little time.” The faculty reacted as if they thought, Wait a second; let’s reexamine this. Is this really a good idea?\n\nBeing open on the issues that matter to me, doing something on issues that matter to them, was immensely helpful. It goes to the second point I was going to make, which is for me, at all three of these institutions, but I’m especially conscious about it at A&M and at Defense, there was very little that I did where I didn’t have a strategy, where I didn’t know where I wanted to go and figured out a strategy for getting there. It wasn’t just imposing it or figuring it will take care of itself, or just telling somebody to do it, but rather, How do I get from here to there and keep everybody on the bus?\n\nOne of the results of that was that virtually nothing I ever did as Secretary was overturned by the Congress, or rejected by the Congress.\n\nNelson\n\nBecause you included Members of Congress in this process?\n\nGates\n\nNo, because I didn’t have anybody running to Congress complaining.\n\nNelson\n\nNo end runs.\n\nGates\n\nBecause they knew there was a solid front, they just didn’t go there. I did the same thing at A&M—I’d also keep the relevant legislators informed of what I was doing. I did the same thing as DCI. I set up something as DCI that has never been done since. I told Boren and Cohen, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the SSCI [Senate Select Committee on Intelligence] and head of the House Intelligence Committee, “The way your hearing structure is set up, I never get a chance just to talk to you about things that are going on that I’d like for you to know, that you ought to know. There is no setting and I can’t have 60 staff members sitting there while I’m telling you, or even 30 members.”\n\nI then started meeting with those guys about every three weeks in the late afternoon, one staff guy on their part and I brought my deputy and one staff guy, and I told them everything. If we had a counterintelligence investigation against somebody, I’d tell them that. I had no secrets from those guys. From the day I became DCI forward, there wasn’t another major problem with the oversight committees on the Hill.\n\nI would do the same thing with [Carl] Levin and [John] McCain and with Ike [Isaac] Skelton and his number two.\n\nEngel\n\nThat sort of personal trust building works very well traditionally when people get along. Did you find any instances where you decided this was not working out with the legislator or what not for any personal reasons?\n\nGates\n\nNo, I was lucky in the legislators. I’m very negative about Congress, but my experience is that, especially for the most senior Members, if you get them away from a television camera and the press, they can be pretty reasonable. If you’re fair with them, they’ll be fair with you. I disagreed with Levin on lots of stuff. He was my principal adversary on Iraq, but it never was personal. When he told me he would do something, he always did it, and vice versa.\n\nEngel\n\nCan we go back to something you said just a moment ago, that there are two to three, at the most four, things that a transformational leader can hope to change within a large organization? But at the same time you said that you wanted to ensure that you had given significant thought, strategy, as to where you wanted to go. Both at A&M and at the CIA, I guess, but most important for our purposes at DoD, when you came into those organizations, which of those two, three, four things did you know you wanted to do ahead of time? And which of them did you, as you put it, sort of pause and take a step back to reflect and decide, here’s where we need to go?\n\nGates\n\nMostly I didn’t have a clue at A&M. At CIA, events dictated the agenda and the goals: the collapse of the Soviet Union, or the impending collapse. At Defense, events dictated it: first, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were my two highest priorities in the Bush administration, along with taking care of the troops. I actually had a strategy session with my senior staff, just four or five guys, in December of ’08.\n\nAs I put it in the book, we had this strategy session over martinis, steaks, and red wine, always a formula for deep thinking. [laughter]\n\nEngel\n\nBefore you go any further—December of ’08, is this before or after you decided to stay on?\n\nGates\n\nThis is after I’ve already been announced. It was what does Gates 2.0 look like? I decided that it was what I just described in terms of the budget, in terms of shaping the force. I’d talked about shaping the force in 2008, but it was mainly rhetorical, because I was going to be gone. But now I said, OK, now these guys are going to learn I actually meant what I said.\n\nEngel\n\nWe want to make sure we start getting into the nuts and bolts of the Pentagon days, but I have two things I want to follow up on from what was said already. I’ll do it in chronological order. When I was asking about the 2003 invasion, you said, and I wrote down this quote, that there were “monumental mistakes” postinvasion. Could you go into some detail for us of what you perceived to be mistakes, not of the invasion, but immediately in the postinvasion—\n\nGates\n\nFirst, allowing the looting to take place. But even more significantly, the disbanding of the Iraqi Army and the de-Ba’athification. On the first, it just seemed monumentally stupid to me. You have 400,000 guys who know how to use weapons and you have just made them all unemployed. The counterargument I heard when I mentioned this at one point was, “Well, the Iraqi Army had largely already dissipated after we invaded.” I said, “OK, I got that. But you put it out that if everybody comes back to their job, they’re going to get X dinars a month to feed their families, they’ll have a place to live, and they will still be part of the Iraqi Army to take care of their people, they’ll come back.”\n\nSecond, on de-Ba’athification, as I said time and again, it is like these guys never read a book about de-Nazification and how the manager of the local power plant was a Nazi, but he really wasn’t a Nazi. He had to be a member of the party to get the job. What you’re really talking about is the upper crust of the party. Once you say, “Anybody who was ever a Ba’athist can’t have a job,” you no longer have any teachers, managers of plants, or anything else. Those were the two biggest mistakes as far as I was concerned.\n\nEngel\n\nNeither of those are necessarily affected by what is oftentimes a criticism made of the administration at this point, that there were simply not enough troops for occupation.\n\nGates\n\nThat was what led to the looting. If you had had enough troops to sustain order, particularly in Baghdad, that would have mattered.\n\nEngel\n\nThe second point, going back to your discussions with the White House about becoming DNI, you went into some good detail for us about the negotiations that you had with the White House about what it would take to get you to do this. Say a little more, if you would, about how those negotiations would have been put into effect. Is this something that you would have gotten the President’s promise to back you up on these issues? Could you have gotten it in legislation?\n\nGates\n\nLegislation? Having passed the Reform Act, Congress was not going to touch this issue again, so it all had to be through empowerment from the President. Just to give you one specific, I said, “I need to be able to fire the Director of the CIA.”\n\nHadley said, “Well, you can’t fire the Director of CIA, because he’s a Presidential appointee.” I said, “Got it. I want a guarantee that if I tell the President I want the CIA Director fired, he’d fire him.” They got it. And I said, “I want a deal on the defense agencies, where I either nominate the heads of those agencies and Rumsfeld concurs or vice versa. If there is a disagreement, we go to the President. But they have to know that they’re accountable to both of us, not just to Rumsfeld.” We went through a bunch of stuff like that.\n\nEngel\n\nFor something like the first issue—that is, you’d want the authority to fire high-ranking individuals, Presidential appointees—would you have expected it to be an open secret that this is your power? Would you expect the President in the press conference announcing your appointment to say, “And I’ve given him this power”?\n\nGates\n\nWe never got that far. The benefit that it had was that it was—It’s a little bit like Washington as the first President. Because I would be the first DNI, nobody would actually know what I could or couldn’t do, but for me to simply say, “The President has given me the assurances that I require to be able to do this job effectively.” The truth is all of it would have come out in the confirmation hearing.\n\nEngel\n\nI see, because—\n\nGates\n\nBecause they would all be asking, “How the hell are you going to make this mess run?”\n\nNelson\n\nBy the way, I don’t remember who was the first DNI.\n\nGates\n\nJohn Negroponte.\n\nNelson\n\nDid the White House realize these were good ideas and did he have these—\n\nGates\n\nNo.\n\nNelson\n\nYou and he didn’t talk about—“John, you should really ask for this”?\n\nGates\n\nNo, because he never called me. I didn’t think I was in much of a position to offer advice since I turned it down. [laughter]\n\nNelson\n\nWell, the assigned topic is how I became Secretary of Defense. Would you give a talk on that subject?\n\nGates\n\nIt’s a very short story, and we’ve already been through a good part of it. I was giving a speech for Norman Borlaug. I don’t know if you ever heard of him. Norman Borlaug is the winner of the trifecta: Nobel Peace Prize, Congressional Gold Medal, Medal of Freedom, the father of the green revolution. He was on the faculty of Texas A&M for the last 20 years of his life and he was active until his mid-90s. I was giving a speech at his request at the World Food Prize in Des Moines. I received an email from my secretary saying that Steve Hadley’s secretary had called and they wanted me to call him right away.\n\nNelson\n\nThis was when?\n\nGates\n\nI can’t remember, Friday morning, maybe.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat week?\n\nGates\n\nOctober, around October 20th.\n\nNelson\n\nBefore the election.\n\nGates\n\nOh, yes, three full weeks before the election, at least, a little more than three weeks before the election. She says, “They really want you to call back right away.” I said, “Well, tell them I’m on the road.” As I write in the book, I’d worked in the White House for nine years. I knew that most of the time when the West Wing is calling and it’s urgent, it’s always urgent for them. I said, “It will keep. Tell him I’ll call him back Saturday morning.” They’re also not accustomed to being treated like that. It’s important to get things right in the first instance, but I had no idea why Hadley was calling.\n\nNelson\n\nNo idea at all?\n\nGates\n\nEspecially since we hadn’t talked since I turned down the DNI job. I take it back, just to go back to the first term. I was offered one job by the administration. Condi called and asked if I would be interested in being on the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. I said, “Sure, I think could be helpful there.”\n\nThe next thing I knew, I got a call from Presidential Personnel asking me if I would be willing to chair some obscure declassification board. I had my secretary give them an answer; I didn’t even call them back, so I did have that experience. But clearly that had run into huge political problems that even PFIAB [President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board] was too prominent for a former 41 person.\n\nI called Hadley on Saturday morning, and we had exactly the conversation that I described: “If the President asked you,” and I said exactly what I said earlier. He said OK. Then I didn’t hear anything for a couple of days. Then Josh Bolten called and said, “I just want to follow up on Hadley’s call and confirm that you really are willing to take this on.” Then I realized they were serious when he said, “Now, is there anything in your background, anything that you’re doing now, corporate stuff, illegal immigrants working for you, all the things that have caused confirmations to blow up in the past?”\n\n“Well,” I said, “I do have a Mexican housekeeper,” and I could hear this [makes sighing sound]. Before he began to hyperventilate, I said, “It’s OK, Josh, she has a Green Card and she’s on her way to citizenship.” That’s when I realized that it was pretty serious, that this was actually something that might happen.\n\nHe said, “We need to arrange an interview for you with the President.” I said, “I can slip into Washington and get back to A&M without it being noticed on Sunday evening, the 13th, and have dinner.” He called me back shortly thereafter and said, “That’s too long. Could you get to the ranch early in the morning on the 6th?”\n\nI said, “Yes, I could do that. We’re going to have out-of-town guests, but I’ll get up early and get out.” They don’t know what my schedule is, anyway. That’s when I realized this was very likely to happen, but it was still in the “might be” column.\n\nI got up about five in the morning and drove—Joe Hagen then called me about the arrangements. They were very precise. I was to meet him at such-and-such a grocery store in McGregor, Texas; he’d be driving a white Durango. I was to park, get in the car, and he’d drive me to the ranch. We had this clandestine meeting; I met with Bush in his office at the ranch. He drove over. They were having a 60th birthday celebration for Laura. He absented himself, came over by himself, and we met at 7:30 or 8 o’clock in the morning, for about an hour.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nGates\n\nHe went through his priorities, his concerns that Iraq was going badly, that we needed to make a change in strategy. We talked about the surge.\n\nNelson\n\nReally?\n\nGates\n\nA surge. He asked me to think about a new commander, and he mentioned [David] Petraeus. Then he talked some about Afghanistan, talked about some of the challenges facing the department. Then he asked me what questions I had. I said on Iraq, I think it is going badly also, and that there is a need for a change. I told him that I had supported a surge as part of the Iraq Study Group, and in fact had sent an email three or four days before Hadley first called me, and had sent an email to [Lee] Hamilton and Baker, saying we ought to recommend a surge of 25,000 to 40,000 troops in Iraq.\n\nI said that I thought that our goals were too ambitious in Afghanistan, that it was being neglected and that we needed to narrow those goals. I told him that I thought the Army and the Marine Corps were too small for what they were being asked to do; they needed to be bigger. I told him I thought that we pulled a bait-and-switch on the National Guard, that overnight they’d gone from being a strategic reserve to an operational force. Neither the guardsmen’s employers nor their families had bargained for what they got, and it was a big problem we had to address.\n\nI told him that I was no expert on it, but I thought the Pentagon was buying too many Cold War–era weapons for the kinds of challenges we were likely to face. We talked about all those things and then he leaned forward. It was clear that the interview was coming to an end. He leaned forward and said, “So what about Cheney?” I said, “Cheney?” He said, “I want you to know that he is an important voice, but he is only one voice, and my voice is the only one that matters.”\n\nI said, “Well, I’ve gotten along with Dick for a long time. I got along with him when he was Secretary. I know he and Rumsfeld are close. I’ll never replicate that, but I think we can get along OK.” That was it.\n\nThe only person that I had told other than Becky [Gates] that I was having this meeting—I had actually talked to 41; 43 never knew it, but I let 41 know. Forty-one had gotten me to A&M and I didn’t feel like I could make a commitment to leave, much less do what I was going to do, without talking to him. I think he was really excited about the prospect. I think he was more excited because he felt like it would really help his son more than anything about me. He made this point: A&M needs you, but the country needs you more.\n\nAs I put it in the book, as I was driving back to College Station, I pretty well felt that what up until that morning had been a “might be” was now going to be a “will be.” Sure enough, later that same day I received a call from Bolten, basically saying, It’s done. Can you be in Washington on Wednesday for an announcement?\n\nNelson\n\nThe day after the election?\n\nGates\n\nYes.\n\nThe President also said—and this is the reason I mentioned about 41—“My father doesn’t know anything about this.” I thought, Oh, shit.\n\nActually, the first time he will know that is when he reads my book.\n\nNelson\n\nWe’re not going to tell him. Was the uncertainty in your mind about whether you would be offered the job or whether you would take it? Had you already decided to take it?\n\nGates\n\nI had already made my commitment to Hadley and Bolten. I was in. They knew I was in. My head was already there. But it was a function of never having had a conversation with the guy. If the chemistry hadn’t clicked, it might not have happened.\n\nNelson\n\nI really want to ask you about that, because this was your first time with him, and talking about something very serious and for the length of an hour. What were your impressions of him? What did you learn about him during that hour that was new to you or that had deeper nuance?\n\nGates\n\nThe first thing, he was extremely candid, just like the question about Cheney. I would never have brought that up, but I also was extremely candid with him and he didn’t bat an eye. I found that very reassuring. I came away thinking, I can tell this guy what I need to tell him and he’s not going to punish the messenger. I can be as honest with him as I need to be.\n\nNelson\n\nSomething we overlooked, Jeff, I guess, is to ask Secretary Gates about the Iraq Study Commission, just one particular thing at the moment. That is, in the email you sent endorsing a surge with about 25,000 troops, did you have a mission in mind for those 25,000 or would those 25,000 go there to do something different?\n\nGates\n\nThe whole key was about securing Baghdad and protecting the population.\n\nNelson\n\nThe Petraeus idea of “clear, hold, and build” was something that was already in the current—\n\nGates\n\nIt wasn’t that articulated in the summer and fall of ’06. But clearly the idea, based on our trip in September to Baghdad, was that you had to provide better security for the people of Baghdad.\n\nEngel\n\nMy understanding of the Army side of this debate over the surge is that there were actually two separate questions going on at this time. The first was to surge or not and to embrace COIN [counterinsurgency] or not in sort of a get-out-and-see-the-population as the prize. The second question was did you do outside of Baghdad or inside of Baghdad first.\n\nGates\n\nThe really big question—and it was not just the Army, it was virtually the entire uniformed leadership, [George] Casey [Jr.]’s position and [John] Abizaid’s position—was the importance of transferring security responsibility to the Iraqis. The more we did, the less they’d do. The more we did, the less pressure they’d be under to do more, so they opposed any surge at all. Their mission was transferring security and then to get out.\n\nBefore the attack on the mosque in the spring of ’06, Casey had intended to be down to 10 brigade combat teams by the end of the year. It was only in the summertime he realized he couldn’t do that because the security situation was just going to hell. The issue, as framed for the Iraq Study Group, was that Casey was completely wedded to this transfer-of-security strategy, and Abizaid and the Chiefs all supported him. What I only got a hint of with the Iraq Study Group and even on my first trip as Secretary, was how much subordinate commanders, like [Raymond] Odierno, disagreed with that and thought that there needed to be more troops.\n\nBut we pressed [Peter] Chiarelli and a whole bunch of others that we talked to very hard about whether they thought more troops were needed. They all toed the line because they were all subordinate to Casey. I give Bush a lot of credit. In essence, because Iraq is not going well, at the end of 2006, for all practical purposes, he fires the Secretary of Defense, the combatant commander, CENTCOM [U.S. Central Command] commander, the field commander, and goes against the unanimous advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to approve the surge.\n\nFor those who talk about Obama neglecting the views of the military or disagreeing with the military or so on, this is as stark a case as I have ever read about, since [Abraham] Lincoln, in many respects, or the conflict or the disagreement between Roosevelt and [George] Marshall about sending materiel to England rather than building up the U.S. Army first. There are a handful of these examples in the 20th century and early 21st century, but this is a stark one of a President and his civilian advisors directly disagreeing with all of their uniformed leaders to take a major step.\n\nNelson\n\nWell, to compound the degree of difficulty, you just had an election. It was probably in all of American history the closest thing to a national referendum in a midterm election and the verdict was get out of Iraq. The new Democratic Congress—\n\nGates\n\nAnd the President doubles down.\n\nNelson\n\nIt’s an extraordinary thing.\n\nEngel\n\nExplain this one a little bit, because this is also an administration that had a President who had, like a catechism, like a mantra, said, “I follow the advice of my generals. I’m not going to pick targets in the basement of the White House. I’m going to do what my generals say.” Then, as you point out, he went for the junior varsity in some sense and put them into play, neglecting the entire JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff].\n\nGates\n\nI think it worked. There are those who would argue that he and Rumsfeld rejected the recommendations—for example, of a larger troop force, for the original invasion, and certainly for the period postinvasion—so there’s one place where they disagreed.\n\nOne of the Democratic criticisms of him was that he hadn’t paid any attention to his military when he went into the war. What I later learned from Hadley and others was that actually the military was split in those days, at the beginning, between those who supported Rumsfeld’s idea of a lighter, faster, more technologically advanced—and those who wanted a much heavier troop presence. But the light invasion force was a manifestation of how little they had thought about what was going to come after.\n\nMy experience was that Bush listened to his generals and always listened respectfully, but was not in the slightest hesitant to disagree with them. It was particularly true in ’06, when it was perfectly apparent that their strategy was failing.\n\nEngel\n\nI’m struck, in a sense, that this is a case where the uniform military personnel were, in essence, making a political argument, that being if we give too much more to the Iraqis they’re not going to stand up and do things for themselves. You have the civilian leadership making, in essence, a security argument, that we need to get more boots on the ground to accomplish physical security of a population, which almost gets down to a level of tactics and not strategy.\n\nGates\n\nNo, it was high strategy. It was fundamentally that you cannot transfer until security has improved. The military was arguing transfer and then security will improve. But in fact, as they were transferring, security was getting worse. Their strategy was clearly not working, so Bush did have that to his advantage.\n\nThe lesson the Democrats took from that was to get the hell out. We were just talking about what Bush’s lesson was.\n\nEngel\n\nHow much of that lesson do you think was—I don’t want to say “internalized”—quietly not being disputed, if you will, by the upper echelon of the military that was against the surge? Let me go back to that for a second to ask this, was there a sense that rather than double down—If the choice is double down or get out, and get out with your tail between your legs, then there were elements in the military in 2006 who were ready to say, “It just isn’t worth it. It’s not a question of our strategy is going to work or the other strategy won’t work, but we need to get out.”\n\nGates\n\nI never heard anything like that.\n\nNelson\n\nI know it is a little bit out of sequence, but we haven’t talked at all about how you became part of the Iraq Study Group and how their recommendations took shape, what you learned from that experience, how your recommendations were different. Could you talk about that? It seems to me that you had a deep immersion on the big issue you’d be dealing with as Secretary of Defense.\n\nGates\n\nWell, Baker was a Secretary of State with whom I’d had some differences, but we got along fine. It was much to my surprise when he called me at A&M and asked me to be on this. I said, “I’m willing to do it, but is the President on board with this?” He said, “That was the first question I asked. I’m not going to do anything that makes life harder for him.” There was a kind of m"
