        "text": "''A great experience,'' Bill Bradley called it, an opportunity to see the country while performing a useful service for his party, for his state and - though he neglected to mention it - perhaps for himself as well.\n\nBetween Labor Day and Election Day, New Jersey's senior Senator campaigned in 24 states in behalf of the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, more than 40 Democratic Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates, and as many state and county Democratic contenders as he could squeeze in.\n\n''He was one of the most-requested and active surrogate campaigners we had,'' said Anita Dunn, communications coordinator for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''He was also one of the few Democrats who was not only welcome but eagerly sought-after in every state. Frankly, we don't have a whole lot of people who can travel to all corners of the country and get the kind of respect and popularity that Bradley commands.''\n\nTwo other especially active and well-received Democratic politicians, she said, were Senator Sam Nunn from Georgia and Senator John Glenn from Ohio. Governor Cuomo was peripatetic, too, campaigning in nine states this fall, a spokesman in his Washington office said. Moving Beyond Basketball\n\nIn an interview here, Mr. Bradley emphasized that his highest priority had been to support New Jersey's junior Senator, Frank R. Lautenberg, who waged and eventually won, by a comfortable margin of 8 percentage points, a grueling re-election battle against the retired Army General Pete Dawkins.\n\nMr. Bradley noted, too, that he had campaigned for Democratic incumbents and challengers before. But this time around, he said, he received more requests and was better known as a Senator and perhaps a little less known as a former professional athlete.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
