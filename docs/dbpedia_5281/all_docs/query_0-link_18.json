        "text": "Commanding performer Bill Nunn made his feature debut in fellow Morehouse College graduate Spike Lee's School Daze (1988), but really etched himself into moviegoers' minds as a formidable screen presence in his second film with Lee, Do the Right Thing (1989), playing Radio Raheem, whose ever-present boom box is at the center of a fight that leads to his death at the hands of an overzealous police officer, the prelude to the all-out riot that follows (Nunn also acted in Mo' Better Blues (1990) and Spiel des Lebens (1998) for Lee). Though he made his initial mark playing young street toughs on screen, this veteran of the Atlanta stage showed he could use his impressive size for something other than menace with a critically acclaimed performance as Harrison Ford's sympathetic, high-spirited physical therapist in In Sachen Henry (1991). Nunn subsequently played pretty much every type there is, all the way up to nice, huggable teddy bear guys like Whoopi Goldberg's protector Eddie Souther in Sister Act - Eine himmlische Karriere (1992).\n\nHis professionalism made him a favorite of other directors besides Lee. He portrayed a Southern police chief in Bill Condon's White Lie (1991) (USA Network), later reteaming with Condon for Candyman 2 - Die Blutrache (1995), and has also acted twice for Michael Apted (Extrem... mit allen Mitteln (1996), HBO's Mit dem Rücken an der Wand (1998)) and Gary Fleder (Das Leben nach dem Tod in Denver (1995), ...Denn zum küssen sind sie da (1997)). Nunn also turned in a fine performance as Tim Roth's adoptive father in Die Legende vom Ozeanpianisten (1998), Giuseppe Tornatore's first English-language feature, released initially in Italy and then in the United States in 1999. He can also be seen in Spider-Man (2002), Im inneren Kreis (2002) with Al Pacino and the prison thriller Lockdown (2000).\n\nNunn has also found time to do numerous television pilots and three series. He was in the CBS series Traps (1994) with George C. Scott, sitcom Local Heroes (1995) for NBC and the critically acclaimed Der Job (2001) with Denis Leary on ABC. He appeared on episodes of Chicago Hope: Endstation Hoffnung (1994), Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994) (both CBS), New York Undercover (1994) and Millennium (1996) (both Fox), among others.\n\nNunn lived in Georgia with his wife Donna and daughters Jessica and Cydney.\n\nOnly one film-maker can claim the title \"Godfather of Gore.\" That peculiar but apt identification seems to be the exclusive property of Herschell Gordon Lewis. With an unusual background that included teaching English Literature to college students, producing and directing television commercials, and voicing radio and television commercials, Herschell literally - and single-handedly - established the \"Splatter Film\" category of motion pictures. He accomplished this by writing and directing (including the musical score) a mini-budget movie titled \"Blood Feast,\" shot in Miami in 1963 and released theatrically the following year. As critics lambasted the primitive effects and inattention to script and sub-par acting, audiences flocked to theaters to see why friends who had reacted to the movie's fiery marketing campaign had said, \"You gotta see this.\" Armed with boxoffice grosses, Herschell and his producer-partner David Friedman quickly decided to build onto their newly-discovered base. Herschell wrote and directed \"Two Thousand Maniacs.\" The lead singer of the musical group hired to perform background music had a tenor voice. Herschell had written the title song, \"The South Gonna Rise Ag'in.\" He wanted a baritone, and without hesitation he made the switch: the voice on the sound track is his. After their third splatter film, \"Color Me Blood Red,\" David Friedman moved to California, engaging in a different type of motio0n picture. Herschell continued to grind out one success after another, with titles such as \"The Gruesome Twosome,\" \"The Wizard of Gore,\" and \"The Gore-Gore Girls.\" When major film companies began to invade his splatter-turf, Herschell took a hiatus, shifting full time to his \"other career,\" writing advertising and mailings for marketers worldwide. He became one of a handful of experts to be inducted into the Direct Marketing Association's Hall of Fame. (Author of 32 books on marketing including the classic \"On the Art of Writing Copy,\" Herschell is often called on to lecture on copywriting, just as he is invited to sing the theme from \"Two Thousand Maniacs\" at horror film festivals.) Over the years, an unusual reality came into place: Herschell's old films continued to play not just on TV screens but in theatres, years after conventional movies would have disappeared altogether. The result has been renewal of his life as a film director. Thus it is that a new Herschell Gordon Lewis movie is hoving into view: \"Herschell Gordon Lewis's BloodMania,\" produced by James Saito in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and planned for 2015 release. Both the producer and the director encapsulate their opinion of \"Herschell Gordon Lewis's BloodMania\" in a single word: Enthusiastic.\n\nBorn in Seattle, Washington, in 1922, as Solomon Krakovsky, to Russian Jewish immigrants, Hill became interested in the theater as a little boy. After graduation from high school, he served in the Naval Reserve (1940-44). From there, he worked alongside a young, unknown star Marlon Brando in \"A Flag is Born.\" His real acting debut came about in 1950, when he co-starred opposite Hedy Lamarr in A Lady Without Passport (1950), and his career took off from there.\n\nFor the rest of the 1950s and 1960s, he co-starred in B-movies such as: Die Göttin (1958), Kiss Her Goodbye (1959), Ein Kind wartet (1963), Stimme am Telefon (1965). Hill also became a leading character actor guest-starring in a wide variety of shows such as: Schlitz Playhouse of Stars (1951), Danger (1950), Playwrights '56 (1955), Studio One (1948), Playhouse 90 (1956), Gnadenlose Stadt (1958), Espionage (1963), Stationsarzt Dr. Kildare (1961), Ben Casey (1961), among many others. Another guest-starring role on Tausend Meilen Staub (1959), led him to starring on Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966). Though the series lasted seven seasons, Hill was not pleased with his role because he refused to abide by the production schedule that required working on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, being an Orthodox Jew. Hill was fired after 1 season, and was replaced in the series by Peter Graves. After his firing, he went on a sabbatical from acting, to focus on selling homes in real estate, hence he moved to New York.\n\nAfter his long absence from acting, he returned to the small screen with the TV mini-series, King (1978). The 1980s saw Hill returning to the box office, co-starring in such blockbuster films such as: It's My Turn - Ich nenn' es Liebe (1980), opposite Jill Clayburgh and Michael Douglas, Der Augenzeuge (1981), Yentl (1983), Die Göttliche (1984), opposite Anne Bancroft and Carrie Fisher, On Valentine's Day (1986), and it's sequel, Courtship (1987), he played a Mafia Don in Arnold Schwarzenegger's another blockbuster film, Der City Hai (1986), then, in a blockbuster ten movie Die Flucht ins Ungewisse (1988), followed by Der Preis des Erfolges (1988), Frühstück bei Ihr (1990), and one of the last films, Billy Bathgate (1991).\n\nIn the 1990s, at 68, after a 23-year-absence from the small screen, he reestablished his career, as the last minute replacement for a starring role in Law & Order (1990), where he played the role of a pragmatic District Attorney, Adam Schiff, a character whom everyone grew to love. Despite not appearing in the pilot episode of the series, he quickly became one of Hollywood's likable and bankable stars, where he often had scenes, that were filmed, only in court. His co-stars on the show consisted of actors who have also made bankable names like Hill himself like Chris Noth, former Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986) alumnae, S. Epatha Merkerson, Sam Waterston, and newcomers Jill Hennessy and Benjamin Bratt. On Law & Order (1990) he was also nominated for Emmies twice, but did not win. The entire cast was shocked when, in 2000, he left his role to enjoy his retirement. Before then, the entire cast appeared with Hill on Larry King Live (1985), to say goodbye to a legendary star.\n\nNeil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 - August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer, and the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.\n\nArmstrong was born and raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio. A graduate of Purdue University, he studied aeronautical engineering; his college tuition was paid for by the U.S. Navy under the Holloway Plan. He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS Essex. In September 1951, while making a low bombing run, Armstrong's aircraft was damaged when it collided with an anti-aircraft cable, strung across a valley, which cut off a large portion of one wing. Armstrong was forced to bail out. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.\n\nArmstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thrust. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash. On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon, and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the Lunar Module Eagle spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Apollo Command Module Columbia. When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 effectively proved US victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. President Jimmy Carter presented him with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1979, and with his former crew-mates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.\n\nAfter he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. He served on the Apollo 13 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In 2012, Armstrong died due to complications resulting from coronary bypass surgery, at the age of 82.\n\nPaul Fix, the well-known movie and TV character actor who played \"Marshal Micah Torrance\" on the TV series Westlich von Santa Fe (1958), was born Peter Paul Fix on March 13, 1901 in Dobbs Ferry, New York to brew-master Wilhelm Fix and his wife, the former Louise C. Walz. His mother and father were German immigrants who had left their Black Forest home and arrived in New York City in the 1870s. (The name \"Fix\" is of Latin/Germanic origin, and is derived from St. Vitus and means \"animated\" or \"vital\").\n\nBesides Peter Paul, the Fix family consisted of two girls and three boys, the youngest of whom was six years older than the future actor. Peter Paul's childhood was a happy one. He and his family lived on the 200-acre property on which the Manilla Anchor Brewery, where his father was brew-master, was situated. Such was the importance of the senior Fix to the brewery that when he died at the age of 62 on the eve of America's entry into the First World War (two years after his 54-year old wife had died), the brewery closed.\n\nThe orphaned Peter Paul, who kept to himself a lot and had a vivid imagination, was sent to live with his married sisters, first one who lived nearby in Yonkers, and then to another in Zanesville, Ohio. The just-turned-17-year-old Peter Paul Fix joined the U.S. Navy on March 12, 1918, and spent his state-side service time during World War I in Newport, Rhode Island and Charleston, South Carolina. He first tread the boards as an actor while a sailor stationed in Newport, when the baby-faced salt (who looked much younger than his age) was one of six gobs chosen to play female roles in the Navy Relief Show \"HMS Pinafore\". The Navy staging of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta was a big hit and chalked up a run of several weeks in Providence and Boston.\n\nFix was assigned as an able-bodied seaman to the troopship U.S.S. Mount Vernon, which was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of France but did not sink as it was run aground. The rest of Fix's naval career was less exciting, and he was demobilized on September 5, 1919. After his discharge, Fix went back to his girlfriend Frances (Taddy) Harvey, whom he had left behind in Zanesville. He and Taddy were married in 1922 and they moved to California as Fix had always wanted to live in a warm climate.\n\nFix and his bride settled in Hollywood, not so much because he had set ideas about becoming an actor but because he didn't know what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. He liked writing and acting in local plays, and soon became friends with the fellow tyro actor Clark Gable, who was his own age. Fix and Gable were discovered by the stage actress Pauline Frederick, who hired them to be members of her touring troupe that traveled by train the length of the West Coast putting on plays. In all, Fix - who had informally renamed himself Paul Peter - appeared in 20 plays with Gable.\n\nPaul Fix had one of his earliest acting roles on celluloid in the mid-1920s, appearing in a silent Western starring William S. Hart. The Western genre eventually would become the one he was most identified with. He played uncredited bit parts and small roles in silents before getting his first credited role in an early talkie (which was part-silent and part-talking), The First Kiss (1928), which starred future Hollywood superstar Gary Cooper and the dame that drove King Kong ape, Fay Wray. In all, Fix appeared in 300-400 films. The Western programmers of the silent and early talkie days could be shot in less than a week.\n\nIn 1925, Taddy gave birth to their daughter Marilyn Carey, who eventually would marry Harry Carey Jr., the son of one of the first great Western superstars. They would have three more children and become part of the extended family gathered around the director John Ford. In his career, Paul Fix would appear with another Western legend, John Wayne, in 26 films, starting in 1931 with Three Girls Lost (1931). Urged on by Loretta Young, Fix became an acting coach for the young actor, and Wayne later paid him back when he became a star by having Fix appear in his movies. (The Duke also was a part of the close-knit group that collected around John Ford). With the Duke's patronage, the kinds of roles that Fix played changed. He had been typed as villains in the 1930s but, in the 40s, he began assaying a better class of character.\n\nPaul Fix was also a screenwriter, and is credited as the writer on three films: Der Fremde aus Arizona (1944), Gala-Premiere (1954) and The Notorious Mr. Monks (1958). His favorites parts included playing the stricken passenger in the John Wayne picture Es wird immer wieder Tag (1954), Elizabeth Taylor's father in George Stevens' classic Giganten (1956), the grandfather of the eponymous Böse Saat (1956) and the judge in Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962). His last screen appearance was in the Brooke Shields movie Wanda Nevada (1979), but he is most famous for appearing in the recurring role of \"Marshal Micah Torrance\" in the popular Western TV series Westlich von Santa Fe (1958). As of 1981, the 80-year old Fix was still getting mail from all over the world from \"Rifleman\" fans.\n\nPaul Fix died October 14, 1983 of kidney failure. He was survived by his daughter Marilyn Carey and son-in-law Harry \"Dobe\" Carey, three grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nAn accomplished actor, painter/sculptor and writer, Denis Forest attended Ryerson Theatre School in Toronto, Canada. He was an associate artist with the Necessary Angel Theatre Company from 1982-1987, where he collaborated on a number of award-winning plays under the direction of Richard Rose (\"Tamara\"). In 1983 \"Mein\" received the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best New Play, and in 1984 Denis was nominated for an ACTRA acting award for the CBC drama Harter Mann in Uniform (1993). In 1985 he was co-recipient of the prestigious Chalmers Award. In 1990 he moved to Los Angeles, where he played a number of memorable roles in film and on television. Recent film credits include Eraser (1996), Cliffhanger - Nur die Starken überleben (1993) and Die Maske (1994) (which showcased his comic abilities). He also starred in John Frankenheimer's Against the Wall (1994), Andersonville (1996), Stephen King's Stephen Kings Sturm des Jahrhunderts (1999) and the drama The Shield: Gesetz der Gewalt (2002)). In March 2002 he appeared in two episodes (\"Provenance 1\" and \"Provenance 2\") of Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993) and was preparing to begin work on a film.\n\nHe has also written screenplays, among them \"Blind Spot\" and \"Into the Fire\". As an acclaimed artist, his paintings and sculptures have been exhibited and are permanently displayed in galleries and venues such as the William Turner Gallery in Venice, California (2000-2001), Bedlam Art in Los Angeles (March-April 2002), Soolip Gallery (2000), JP Morgan Securities in San Francisco, Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas (2000), Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas (1999), the Laguna Museum of Art (2000; his work is also featured in the sales and rental office of the museum), LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) Group Show (1999), DeVorzon Gallery in Beverly Hills, D2 in Seat Vision, Diana Derpic, the William Turner Gallery in San Francisco at the Triton Hotel (1996) and in private collections.\n\nAlthough Denis was often cast to play bizarre and eccentric characters, his dramatic work (including a flawless performance in \"The Shield\") speaks of his amazing range, talent and sensitivity. Denis spoke of his delight at the success in his native Canada of the children's film Daffy und der Wal (1988) (\"The Tadpole and the Whale\"), which made his character Marcel a favorite with children - who would recognize him and approach him on the street. In his personal life, Denis was an engaging, sensitive, spiritual, kind, funny, extremely intelligent and enlightened person; he will be remembered as a truly gentle soul. Denis' special interests included poetry, literature, philosophy, art, film, music, yoga, and alchemy which held a special intrigue for him and figured profoundly into his painting. Denis was truly a Renaissance Man. Denis passed away suddenly following a massive stroke in Los Angeles on March 18, 2002, after having dinner in a Franklin Avenue restaurant in Hollywood with a few friends. An incredibly talented actor, writer, and artist, a wonderful and inspiring friend who left us too soon, a ray of light - that is how Denis will be remembered by those who had the good fortune of knowing him.\n\nSherman Hemsley played characters known to be wise-cracking, \"Weezy\" loving, boisterous fools which America and the entire world laughed with kindheartedly. Sherman Alexander Hemsley, Air Force veteran and actor, was born on Feb. 1, 1938 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, William Hemsley, worked at a printing press while his mother worked at various factories during the war. As a child, Hemsley was introduced to acting during school where the teachers would ask students to play different characters. The first play he did as a kid in school was about fire prevention and Hemsley played the fire. He eventually ended up dropping out of school and joined the Air Force. During his adolescence he never considered acting as a profession until after he served in the military. Hemsley then moved from south Philadelphia where he had spent most of his life to New York City. He worked graveyard shift as a post office clerk during the night and actor during the day. He considered New York the best place to be as it had several acting workshops and theater companies such as The Negro Ensemble Company (NEC)founded by Robert Hooks which helped actors/actresses obtain roles on theater, television and movies. His former co-star, Roxie Roker, was also part of the NEC alumni. Hemsley made his professional acting debut on the Broadway play, Purlie, and toured with the show for a year. In 1971, while on tour for Purlie, he received a call from producer/creator/writer Norman Lear. Lear wanted Hemsley to audition for a role which was going to be part of his sitcom Es bleibt in der Familie (1971). Due to his commitment to the Purlie project, Hemsley declined the role. Norman Lear said he would have the role open for him and Hemsley joined the cast two years later. Hemsley and co-star, Isabel Sanford were chosen to do a spin off of the show All In The Family called Die Jeffersons (1975). Despite the age difference between Hemsley and Sanford (twenty years apart), many described their on-screen marriage as truly hilarious. Hemsley was nominated for a Golden Globe for his outstanding performance as George Jefferson. The Jeffersons turned out to be a success spanning eleven seasons ending in 1985. After The Jeffersons, Hemsley steadily started working on other projects and in 1986 joined the NBC sitcom Amen (1986) where he played religious deacon Ernest Frye. The show ran for five seasons until 1991. Hemsley then made his debut as a voice actor as part of the ABC live action-puppet series, Die Dinos (1991). Hemsley played Bradley P. Richfield, Earl's cruel boss. The show ran successfully for four seasons. In 1997, the remaining cast of The Jeffersons had a reunion on the Rolonda (1994) talk show, still having the same charm they did decades ago. Isabel Sanford and Sherman Hemsley made television guest appearances together on well-known television programs such as Der Prinz von Bel-Air (1990) and were in commercials for The Gap, Old Navy and Denny's. Hemsley and Marla Gibbs guest starred on the TBS show House of Payne (2006) in 2011. Sherman Hemsley will be remembered as an actor who was on shows that addressed serious issues but also one who brought laughter into homes every week.\n\nDavid Alexander Hess was born in New York City in 1936. He began his professional career as a songwriter for Shalimar Music, in 1957, under the pseudonym of David Hill. His first recording was a quick hit, which was later performed by and credited to Elvis Presley, \"All Shook Up.\"\n\nDavid went on to compose \"Start Movin'\" for Sal Mineo and \"Rockin' Shoes\" for the The Ames Brothers. He continued to write songs for Elvis throughout the 1950s and 1960s, including \"I Got Stung,\" \"Come Along\" (from the film \"Frankie And Johnny\"), and \"Sand Castles\" (from the film \"Paradise, Hawaiian Style\"). He also wrote \"Make Me Know You're Mine\" (first performed by Conway Twitty, and \"Blue Lagoon.\" \"Your Hand, Your Heart, Your Love\" became a 1960s hit when it was performed by Andy Williams. In 1963 David wrote and recorded \"Speedy Gonzalez,\" which became a #1 single for Pat Boone, selling more than eight million copies worldwide. David then recorded two solo albums for Kapp Records, again topping the charts, this time with a Top Ten folk hit called \"Two Brothers.\"\n\nIn 1969 he became head of A&R at Mercury Records in New York. There he linked up with Western classical composer John Corigliano, and together they wrote the Grammy award-winning rock opera \"The Naked Carmen\", which became a big hit of the Berlin Ballet Week in 1970. David's work with Mercury also included \"And the Children Toll the Passing of the Day,\" a 1969 album he wrote for Irish actor Malachy McCourt.\n\nIn 1972 his career split off into several new directions with his starring role in the Wes Craven horror classic Das letzte Haus links (1972), for which he also composed the soundtrack. He went on to score Bucks größtes Abenteuer (1991), a children's film based on a collection of Jack London stories. It won the top prize for film and direction at the Giffone Film Festival. A subsequent job offer from PolyGram Records' German affiliate gave David the opportunity to move to Munich, Germany, and a multilingual career in film dubbing from 1972 to 1976, which in turn led him to write the English-language shooting scripts for such German greats as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Reinhard Hauff and his present collaborator, Peter Schamoni.\n\nHis ability to switch seamlessly from in front of the camera to the production team earned him the opportunity to direct his first American feature film, Goodnight (1980), for Media Home Entertainment in 1980. He also appeared in two low-budget horror films directed by Ruggero Deodato, Der Schlitzer (1980) and Body Count - Die Mathematik des Schreckens (1986).\n\nIn 1991 he played the part of the American in Peter Schamoni's Max Ernst: Mein Vagabundieren - Meine Unruhe (1991). From 1993 to 1995 he produced Niki de Saint Phalle: Wer ist das Monster - du oder ich? (1996).\n\nDavid's final musical accomplishments included the release of two albums, \"Caught Up In The Moment\" and \"Live & Unplugged in Hollywood, 2002.\" He lived in Southern California, just outside of Los Angeles, with his wife, with whom he had three children.\n\nDavid Hess died on 7 October, 2011.\n\nLeslie Howard Steiner was born in London to Lilian (Blumberg) and Ferdinand \"Frank\" Steiner. His father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant, and his English mother was of German Jewish and mostly English descent. Leslie went to Dulwich College, then worked as a bank clerk until the outbreak of World War I, when he went into the army. In 1917, diagnosed as shell-shocked, he was invalided out and advised to take up acting as therapy. In a few years, his name was famous on the stages of London and New York. He made his first movie in 1914: (The Heroine of Mons (1914)). He became known as the perfect Englishman (slim, tall, intellectual, and sensitive), a part that he played in many movies which set women to dreaming about him. His first sound movie came out in 1930: Outward Bound (1930), an adaptation of the stage play in which he starred. In Never the Twain Shall Meet (1931) and Liebesleid (1932), he played the Englishman role to the hilt. His screen persona could perhaps best be summed up by his role as Sir Percy Blakeney in Die scharlachrote Blume (1934), a foppish society gentleman.\n\nIt was Howard who insisted that Humphrey Bogart get the role of Duke Mantee in Der versteinerte Wald (1936), a role that Bogart had played in the stage production. As he became more successful, he also became quite picky about which roles he would do, and usually performed in only two films a year. In 1939, he played the character that will always be associated with him, that of Ashley Wilkes, the honor-bound, disillusioned intellectual Southern gentleman, in Vom Winde verweht (1939).\n\nHowever, war clouds were gathering over England, and he devoted all his energy on behalf of the war effort. He directed films, wrote articles and made radio broadcasts. He died in 1943, when the KLM plane he was in was shot down by German fighters over the Bay of Biscay."
