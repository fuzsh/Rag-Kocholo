INTRODUCTION For the past several years, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has been examining fraud, abuse, and inadequate regulation in the insurance industry. During this investigation, a number of regulators described problems they had encountered in trying to regulate and oversee the operations of Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans in their states. Many of them noted that they spent a disproportionately greater amount of time regulating their ``not-for-profit Blues'' than they did on any ``for-profit'' insurance companies. Other regulators said that they knew little about their Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Plans, and that when they attempted to find out more about their operations, they were either denied access or were otherwise barred by their own State law from requiring full disclosure. Some regulators expressed concern that the philosophy guiding many of these Plans had changed from that of a non-profit organization primarily concerned with the subscribers' interests to that of a large corporation out to maximize short-term profits. In October, 1990, for the first time in the history of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield System one of its members--the West Virginia Plan--was declared insolvent and was seized by the West Virginia Insurance Department, leaving more than 51,000 individuals with unpaid claims and thousands more with reduced or non-existent coverage. In the aftermath of this Plan's failure, press reports raised serious questions about its management and the regulatory oversight of its operations. In 1991, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) formed a Special Committee on Blue Cross Plans.\\1\\ The Special Committee's charge was to ``identify solvency issues related to Blues organizations, and review current regulatory oversight of these issues.'' This was the first time the NAIC had deemed it necessary to form such a committee on the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The NAIC consists of the heads of the insurance departments of each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia and the four U.S. territories. For the last 120 years it has served as the primary vehicle for coordinating insurance regulatory activities and as a catalyst for developing a national program of insurance regulation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Set against a backdrop of spiraling health care costs and growing public debate over the future of the American health care system, these concerns prompted then Subcommittee Chairman Sam Nunn to launch a specific inquiry regarding the nation's Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans. This inquiry focused on allegations of mismanagement and misconduct on the part of several of these Plans and the ability of state insurance regulators to oversee their operations, as well as those of the other Plans in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system. It led to a series of hearings, the first of which took place on July 2, 1992, examining the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans of West Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and New York (Empire) and Blues contracts with the Federal government. At the July hearing, then Chairman Nunn noted that when the Senate last undertook a comprehensive review of the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield system in the early 1970s,\\2\\ it found evidence of mismanagement, excessive billings, exorbitant salaries and perks for Plan officials, as well as conflicts of interest and fraud. Then Chairman Nunn described the framework for the Subcommittee's subsequent efforts in its updated examination of the Blues, including the following issues: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ The Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopolies, Chaired by Senator Philip Hart. --Lthe financial integrity of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans; --Lthe role of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association in ensuring that its member Plans are financially sound and well managed; --Lthe propriety of not-for-profit Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans creating and operating ``for-profit'' subsidiaries, and the impact these subsidiaries or affiliates may have on the former's financial integrity and stability; --Lthe effectiveness of State regulators in overseeing their domiciled Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans and their subsidiaries and affiliates; --Lthe Plans' management style and philosophy, and whether these have become inimical to effective State regulation; --Lthe propriety of salaries and fringe benefits received by Plans' officers and directors; and, --Lthe role of the Federal government in monitoring and supervising the Federal employee programs administered by the various Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans. This investigation was conducted by the Subcommittee's Majority Staff at the direction of then Chairman Nunn, with the concurrence and support of then Ranking Minority Member, Senator William V. Roth, Jr. It was authorized pursuant to Senate Resolution 62, adopted February 28, 1991, and Senate Resolution 71, adopted February 25, 1993, which empower the Subcommittee to investigate ``all other aspects of crime and lawlessness within the United States which have an impact upon or affect the national health, welfare, and safety; including but not limited to investment fraud schemes, commodity and security fraud, computer fraud, and the use of offshore banking and corporate facilities to carry out criminal objectives.'' II. THE BLUE CROSS/BLUE SHIELD SYSTEM A. History of the Plans The Blue Cross/Blue Shield organization is the largest and oldest provider of prepaid health care coverage in the nation. It is a nationwide federation of individual corporations, or Plans, each of which serves its community as a non-profit organization. Each Plan is a member of the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, which serves as a coordinating agency for the Plans. Blue Cross and Blue Shield were originally two separate organizations. Blue Cross Plans were founded primarily to cover hospital expenses, though over time they have expanded into other areas, such as outpatient and home care. Blue Shield Plans were established primarily to cover physicians' services, though over time they also have expanded into other areas, such as dental, vision, and outpatient coverage. The Blue Cross Association and the Blue Shield Association began operating under one president in 1978 and merged into a joint corporation in 1982. Today, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans either cooperate closely, are joint corporations, or are separate entities whose benefits may overlap. At the end of 1991, the system's 73 Plans totaled approximately 94.3 million subscribers. Of these, 68.1 million were private subscribers (26.5 percent of the market share), and 33 million were Government subscribers.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ About 6.8 million subscribers--Medicare recipients with supplemental Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage--are counted as both Government and private subscribers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Unique Status of Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans Ever since their establishment in the 1930s, Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Plans have been organized and regulated pursuant to special statutes in their various states of domicile. This special status is based on a number of considerations, including their: not-for-profit nature; \\4\\ presumed commitment to providing health care coverage at the lowest possible cost to the largest possible population; and, in some states, status as the health insurer of last resort. Unlike their for-profit counterparts, Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans are looked on as having an intrinsic fiduciary responsibility to protect the interests of their subscribers. In line with their special role and responsibilities, Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans are often accorded significant advantages not available to commercial insurers, such as being exempt from certain tax and other regulatory requirements. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ In recognition of changing market conditions and the special need to access capital markets, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association's Board of Directors has recently authorized Member Plans to change their organizational form to ``for-profit.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (the Association or BCBSA) is a trade association and as such is neither the parent of the individual Plans nor a guarantor of their debts or other contractual and financial obligations. According to its articles of incorporation, the Association's purposes are to: --Lpromote the betterment of public health and security, and to secure wide public acceptance of the principle of voluntary, non-profit prepayment of health service; --Lprotect the Blue Cross and Blue Shield service marks; --Ldevelop and maintain the Association's membership standards; --Lcooperate with federal, state, and local governments for the provision of health services to the needy and aged; --Lestablish and maintain support and other services to Members through the exercise of authority delegated by the Members; and, --Lconduct its affairs, to have offices within and without the State of Illinois, and to exercise the powers granted by the General Not-For-Profit Corporation Act of the State of Illinois. A significant Association activity is to coordinate health care coverage for national employers with offices in more than one region of the country including, for example, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Under that program, Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans insure 3.5 of the 9 million participating Federal workers, retirees, and their families throughout the country. In addition, the Association is the prime contractor for the Blue Cross/Blue Shield organization's administration of Medicare (Part A). Under this program, the Association contracts with member Plans to perform a wide range of functions, such as claims processing, audits, utilization reviews, and other administrative tasks. D. Association Structure The Association is governed by a Board of Directors, which consists for the most part of the Plan CEOs. The Board holds at least four regular meetings each year, in addition to any special meetings that may be called. Between meetings, its authority is vested in a 26-member Executive Committee. The Executive Committee Chairman also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Another Executive Committee member is the President of the Association, while the remaining 24 represent the 12 districts into which the member Plans are divided. E. Financial Information In 1990, the Association reported systemwide total assets of $118,857,345, liabilities of $106,054,671, and equity of $12,811,674. In the same year, it reported total revenues of $109,129,527 and total expenses of $106,866,512. In terms of systemwide revenues, the Association maintains it is the same size as the fifth ranked corporation on the list of Fortune 500 companies. Based on aggregated data derived from member Plan balance sheets, the Association reported total Plan assets of $30.1 billion and reserves of $9.8 billion as of December 31, 1991. It should be noted, however, that the financial strength of any individual Plan relies not on these total figures but, rather, on the strength of its own assets and reserves. F. Oversight of Member Plans At the outset of the Subcommittee's investigation, all Plans had to adhere to seven membership standards as a condition of membership.\\5\\ However, partly in response to the Subcommittee's investigation, as of June 1993 these standards had been revised and/or expanded to: clarify Plan Boards' oversight responsibilities; inform state regulators about Plan subsidiaries' activities; assure that subscribers' claims are paid and their coverage continued in the event of a Plan insolvency (effective December 31, 1994); inform the public on Plans' financial condition; and, assure that Plans are able to meet their inter-Plan program financial obligations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ These standards provided that Plans: be organized and operated on a non-profit basis; have a Board not controlled by any special interest group and which is comprised of a majority of persons other than health care providers; furnish reports and records to the Association to indicate compliance with these standards; maintain adequate financial resources to protect customers and meet long-term business obligations; use their best efforts to contract with cost- effective health care providers; operate in a manner responsive to customer needs; and participate in each national program adopted by the Association. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These standards apply to all regular member Plans and membership renewal is contingent upon their compliance with them. Based on the degree of compliance with the standards, the Association has a range of options it can pursue.\\6\\ It can monitor Plans experiencing financial and/or operational difficulties, using authority it has to require records and other relevant data to be submitted. In the event that a Plan fails or is expected to fail to meet one or more of the membership standards, the Association can contact the Plan's Board or the concerned state insurance regulators to seek their input in this regard. If these efforts prove unsuccessful, the Association can seek judicial enforcement of the license agreement or, with a majority vote of the membership, move to terminate the Plan's license. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ At the outset of the Subcommittee's investigation, Plans were subject to a somewhat different regime: they could be in substantial compliance with all seven membership standards; they could receive comments on specific issues where they were not in full compliance; they could fail to be in substantial compliance with any one membership standard, which would prompt their being placed on conditional status (being required to develop a rehabilitation plan and being subject to continuous monitoring by the Association); and, in the event that they failed to meet the membership standards, failed to meet terms agreed upon pursuant to conditional membership status, or failed to apply for renewal, their membership could be subject to non-renewal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- III. FINDINGS The Subcommittee's examination of the West Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, and New York (Empire) Plans, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield's Federal employee and Medicare contracts, has revealed a pattern of gross mismanagement, ineffective oversight, and regulatory failings strikingly similar to that uncovered by the Senate Judiciary Committee in its investigation of the Blues more than twenty years ago. With the exception of the Federal contracts, these problems caused severe financial impairment in all of the Plans examined and, in the case of the West Virginia Plan, helped to bring about its demise.\\7\\ These problems also adversely impacted the Plans' ability to fulfill their responsibilities to policyholders, providers, and other health care industry interests. In the case of the Federal employee and Medicare contracts, these problems resulted in wasted taxpayers' dollars, unnecessary costs to the Federal government, and questionable charges and poor service to subscribers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ While this investigation focused on the West Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Empire Plans, the Subcommittee also received information on other Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans that have experienced some of the same problems discussed herein. For example, according to an April, 1994 GAO report, Blue Cross and Blue Shield: Experiences of Weak Plans Underscore the Role of Effective State Oversight (GAO/HEHS-94-71), Plans in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and West Virginia (Mountain State, successor to the failed West Virginia Plan) have experienced such problems. In addition, the Subcommittee notes that the Colorado Plan's CEO was recently removed for misconduct and that the former CEO of the Louisiana/Mississippi Plan pled guilty in Federal Court to charges of having bribed the State Insurance Commissioner in an attempt to quash an audit critical of the Plan. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE WEST VIRGINIA, MARYLAND, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, & EMPIRE PLANS A. Mismanagement 1. The Plans' CEOs created corporate cultures inimical to Blue Cross/Blue Shield's historical mission and non-profit status. These executives operated their Plans in an irresponsible and unsafe manner that ill befitted their status as non-profit health insurers whose primary mission was to provide affordable, quality health care to their policyholders and, in some cases, serve as the health insurer of last resort. 2. Top managers failed to operate their Plans in accordance with their fiduciary responsibilities to the policyholders by making unsound business decisions and, in at least two instances (Empire and West Virginia), engaging in highly questionable, if not improper, conduct. The Subcommittee found that these managers at times acted for their own self-interest and/or enrichment and, in three of the four Plans examined, set up for-profit subsidiaries that had little to do with the Blues' primary mission and ended up losing hundreds of millions of dollars. 3. The Plan CEOs and their management teams generally succeeded in resisting and/or evading duly constituted authorities--State Insurance Departments, Plan Boards of Directors, and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association--in the exercise of their oversight/regulatory functions. 4. Top Plan managers abused their positions by obtaining exorbitant salaries and other fringe benefits and by incurring millions of dollars in unnecessary and/or unjustified travel and entertainment expenses, at a time when their Plans were in dire financial straits and subscriber premiums were being increased dramatically. 5. All the Plans examined had extensive and recurring accounting, financial reporting and/or internal control deficiencies, which significantly impaired their operations and financial integrity. In the Maryland and Empire Plans, these deficiencies helped create circumstances that enabled major frauds to be perpetrated against them, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in losses. 6. All the Plans examined had serious problems in their underwriting policies and practices, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in losses. In large part, these problems were caused by management decisions to systematically underprice their lines of business in order to gain market share. 7. The Plans' problems had serious consequences for policyholders, providers, and other health care industry interests. The lives of thousands of West Virginia Plan policyholders and providers were thrown into turmoil as a result of its failure. In the Empire, Maryland and District of Columbia Plans, policyholders experienced poor service, a diminution in and/or loss of coverage, and dramatically increased premiums, while providers encountered ever-increasing problems in obtaining reimbursement for services rendered. B. Inadequate Oversight by the Boards of Directors 8. The Plans' Boards of Directors failed to perform their requisite oversight functions, ignoring their responsibility to the policyholders whose interests they were charged with protecting. The Subcommittee found that: a. management was able to gain effective control of Boards by circumventing and/or altering rules regarding the process by which members were selected. As a result, over time Boards tended to become unquestioning ``rubberstamps'' for management decisions. b. many Board members failed to understand Plan policies and procedures, were ignorant of the serious problems and/or abuses occurring within the Plans, and were easily manipulated and misled by management. This was particularly evident in the case of the Maryland and Empire Plans, where the CEOs used their dual roles as Board Chairmen to control the information made available to Board members. c. many Board members failed to understand their fiduciary obligation to protect the policyholders' interests and their responsibility to oversee management's actions. Indeed, the West Virginia Plan's Board Chairman was involved in an incident that constituted a conflict of interest with his Board responsibilities, and he also served as Board Chairman for a number of the Plan's for-profit subsidiaries that were designed for his benefit and that of other Plan officials and Board members. C. Inadequate Regulation by State Insurance Departments 9. State Insurance regulators were hesitant, reluctant, and even afraid to take decisive action against a Plan for fear of the effect such action might have on the large number of policyholders involved. In effect, the Plans examined became too-big-to-fail and/or to be effectively regulated, as reflected in the following: a. regulators overseeing the Plans examined often accorded them special treatment and made forebearances for them. The Subcommittee found instances where assets of questionable value were allowed to be counted toward meeting statutory reserve or other important reporting requirements; official decisions were reversed when such action accrued to a Plan's benefit; premium increases were readily granted; and, Plans were allowed to ignore regulations, directives, and remedial recommendations with impunity. b. regulators in some cases ignored or failed to fully utilize examination results and other information available to them, which described the Plans' problems and set forth specific recommendations for further action. c. regulators in the concerned States failed to use available means to enforce their authority over the Plans. d. regulators in the concerned States were often unaware of or not fully informed about significant Plan activities, such as the establishment of for-profit subsidiaries and the major problems they subsequently caused. e. regulators in some cases were subject to political pressure exerted on behalf of the Plans, which undermined and/or negated oversight and enforcement efforts. f. regulators in the concerned States were hampered in their oversight efforts by inadequate staff, resources, and/or statutory authority, and the Plans' ability to evade and resist such efforts. 10. As a result of a Federal statutory exemption from District of Columbia insurance regulation, oversight of the D.C. Plan rested on limited efforts by Maryland and Virginia regulators to oversee that portion of the Plan's business underwritten in their jurisdictions. D. Inadequate Oversight by the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association 11. While being aware of these Plans' serious problems, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association failed to act decisively to correct those problems. For example, the Association failed to enforce its membership standards, even after long-term monitoring had shown that a Plan was not meeting specified reserve and liquidity requirements. 12. Association officials were extremely reluctant to act against the Plans, fearing that their only effective means of enforcement--i.e., the ``ultimate weapon'' of revoking the Blue Cross/Blue Shield trademarks--would seriously injure the image of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system and leave them with the difficult task of having to find substitute coverage for the affected policyholders. 13. The Association failed to systematically share in a timely manner the important information it had concerning the Maryland, District of Columbia, and Empire Plans' problems with the appropriate State insurance authorities and Plan Boards, even after the West Virginia Plan had failed and the other Plans had become seriously impaired. FEDERAL CONTRACTS A. Mismanagement 14. Blue Cross/Blue Shield's mishandling of its Federal contract responsibilities has resulted in millions of dollars in unnecessary, wasteful, and/or questionable costs incurred by the Federal government and, in some instances, subscribers. a. excessive layers of bureaucracy involved in the Federal Employee Program (FEP) contract--i.e., the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, the FEP Director's Office, the FEP Operations Center, and the 67 participating Plans--have added unnecessarily to the Federal government's FEP program costs. b. Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans participating as FEP and Medicare contractors have billed the Federal Government for tens of millions of dollars in charges that have been questioned and/or disallowed. In the FEP, since 1988 the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Inspector General (OPM/OIG), has questioned more than $78 million in contract charges and disallowed $51.6 million (66%) of that amount. Since 1992, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS/OIG) has recommended disallowing more than $40 million for improper charges by Blues Medicare contractors. c. Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans have withheld millions of dollars in hospital and provider discounts from the Federal government and some FEP subscribers. In the case of the subscribers, this has resulted in higher and unfair out-of-pocket expenses. d. reflecting the same irresponsible management outlook and disregard for cost-containment uncovered in the West Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, and New York (Empire) Plans, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association has billed the Federal Government for millions of dollars in questionable and/or unnecessary charges for FEP conferences and meetings, promotional items, and executive compensation. 15. Poor performance on the part of some Blue Cross/Blue Shield Medicare contractors has resulted in their being placed on a ``watch list'' and/or being terminated by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). Eight of the 41 Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Plans participating as Part A intermediaries in 1993 were on the watch list and one of these was scheduled to be terminated at the end of the 1994 contract year. Seven of the 27 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans participating as Part B carriers were on the watch list in that same year and another three will not be renewed at the end of the 1994 contract year. 16. Extensive and recurring internal control weaknesses among Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans involved in the FEP have resulted in duplicate payments, coordination of benefits problems, and discrepancies in enrollment data that have caused erroneous premiums to be collected and benefits to be paid. These internal control deficiencies constitute an invitation to fraud, particularly since anti-fraud efforts have generally received minimal attention from the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association and the individual Plans. B. Inadequate Regulation 17. Regulation by OPM and HCFA, the agencies responsible for overseeing the Blue Cross/Blue Shield contracts with the FEHBP and Medicare, has been marked by many of the same inadequacies that the Subcommittee found in connection with the West Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, and New York (Empire) Plans, including: a. uncooperative attitudes and evasive tactics on the part of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association and the individual participating Plans; b. a tendency by regulators to treat the Blues in an unquestioning and deferential manner, owing to their size and market share,--i.e., the ``too-big-to- regulate'' dilemma; and, c. a serious lack of regulatory resources; resulting, for example, in an inability to audit the participating Plans on a timely basis. C. Inadequate Oversight by the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association 18. The Association's performance regarding its Federal contract responsibilities exhibited most of the same shortcomings identified in its failed oversight of the West Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, and New York (Empire) Plans. For example, OPM officials indicated that a lack of guidance and oversight by the FEP Director's Office is the biggest problem in FEP operations and subscriber service. In the Medicare program, the Association does not monitor the performance of Blue Cross/Blue Shield contractors and is thus largely unaware of any problems they may be having in carrying out their functions. IV. CONCLUSIONS A. Gross Mismanagement, Ineffective Regulation/Oversight Raise Concerns About Blues' Ability to Serve Basic Purpose Based on its investigation, the Subcommittee is concerned about the ability of Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans to continue to serve their basic purpose of providing quality health care coverage at an affordable price. In the cases we examined, the accountability triad of oversight by Plan Boards of Directors and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, and regulation by State insurance authorities (and OPM and HHS in the case of the Federal contracts) did not ensure that the Plans performed efficiently and effectively. Plan executives were able to operate in a grossly inept and unsound manner, while deliberately blocking and evading the efforts of those charged with regulating and overseeing their activities. The evidence also highlighted the inability and/or unwillingness of regulators, Plan Boards, and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association to effectively carry out their responsibilities regarding the Plans and their policyholders. Accordingly, the Subcommittee believes that major improvements are needed across-the-board in response to the problems uncovered by its investigation. The management of Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans has to be improved substantially and Plan operations have to be carried out in accordance with the Blues' mission. In addition, State insurance authorities (and OPM and HHS in the case of the Federal contracts), Plan Boards, and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association have to substantially improve their regulation and/or oversight of Plan management and operations. The Subcommittee notes that should States fail to improve their regulatory performance regarding the Blues, this may prompt the need to consider a Federal role beyond the narrow one maintained in terms of the FEHBP and Medicare contracts. B. Implications for Health Care Reform The Subcommittee also believes that the serious problems revealed regarding the Blues Plans examined and those charged with their regulation and oversight may have implications for the current debate on health care reform. Specifically, the Subcommittee is concerned about the role Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans can and/or should play in any new or substantial revision of the existing health care delivery system. They must correct their operational problems, lack of accountability, and inadequate performance in containing costs, to function effectively as part of a revised health care delivery system. Similarly, in considering the idea of a significant Blues role in a reformed health care delivery system, the Subcommittee notes that there is sufficient reason to question the ability of State insurance authorities, Plan Boards, and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association to effectively carry out whatever regulatory and/or oversight responsibilities they may be given in this regard. Indeed, one of the key dilemmas facing those concerned with health care reform is how to resolve the apparent problem posed by any potential role the Blues might play in our health care system and the Subcommittee's findings that the existing mix of State regulation and Association/Plan Boards oversight are inadequate. The essential question remains, if these entities cannot be counted on to do the job, to whom will these essential functions be assigned? V. RECOMMENDATIONS In setting forth its recommendations,\\8\\ the Subcommittee intends that they serve the dual purpose of providing a blueprint for correcting the serious problems it has identified in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system, while at the same time constituting an important reference point for the health care reform debate. The pivotal issues raised in this Blue Cross/ Blue Shield investigation--i.e., corporate performance and accountability, cost containment and protecting policyholders' interests, and regulatory capability--are clearly among those that will have to be addressed effectively for any proposed health care reform effort to succeed. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ The Subcommittee notes that in response to its investigation, remedial actions reflecting the findings and conclusions are under consideration and/or have already been instituted by the Maryland legislature and Insurance Division, the District of Columbia Superintendent of Insurance, the New York Insurance Department, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- With these thoughts in mind, the Subcommittee makes the following recommendations: A. Plan Performance and Accountability 1. eliminate management deficiencies and abuses The Subcommittee received overwhelming evidence showing that the problems--mismanagement, exorbitant salaries, wasteful travel and entertainment expenses, internal control deficiencies, and faulty underwriting--experienced by the Plans examined were a reflection of a corporate culture and operational approach that were inconsistent with Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Plans' non-profit status and special responsibility to their policyholders. Indeed, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association has already responded to some of the Subcommittee's findings in this regard by providing for its assessments of Plan performance to be communicated directly to the Boards rather than through Plan CEOs, and by requiring that the Boards adopt a code of conduct that shows that they are committed to the highest level of business ethics. While these measures are clearly steps in the right direction, the Subcommittee believes that additional remedial actions are needed and recommends that the Association: --Lestablish cost containment guidelines and develop related incentives to assure compliance; --Ldevelop minimum standards regarding accounting and internal control procedures and require that Plans comply with them; --Lrequire that compensation packages, i.e., salaries, bonuses, and other benefits for corporate officers and senior managers be a matter of public record; --Lestablish guidelines to curtail waste and abuse in travel and entertainment expenses; --Ldevelop a policy regarding compensation of Board members that helps to assure their independence; --Lprohibit a Plan CEO from also serving at the same time as Board Chairman; --Lrequire Plans to develop and implement detailed programs to deter and detect fraud; and, --Lclosely monitor the performance of the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Plans participating in the FEP and Medicare. In addition, in light of the mismanagement and extensive operational problems found in the Plans examined, and the Blues preeminent position in the health insurance industry, the Subcommittee is concerned that such problems may also exist among other health insurers. These concerns reflect testimony by Blue Cross/Blue Shield officials in which they attempted to justify questionable entertainment, travel, and marketing expenses by asserting that they were necessary in order to remain competitive and that others in their industry were doing the same thing. The Subcommittee believes that the possibility that such practices--and the underlying corporate culture that aids and abets them--may be more widespread needs to be examined, both in terms of their immediate effects and longer term health care reform implications. Such an undertaking should involve, but not necessarily be limited to, state insurance regulators, the NAIC, Congress, and concerned Executive Branch agencies. 2. plans must be accountable As non-profit corporations, the Plans of the Blue Cross/ Blue Shield system have no shareholders to whom they must answer and are not fully subject to the rigors of marketplace competition. In the cases examined by the Subcommittee, the Boards of Directors charged with holding Plan officials accountable failed to fulfill their responsibilities in this regard. While State insurance regulators are supposed to serve as the ultimate authority to whom an insurer must answer, the testimony presented demonstrated that they too failed to carry out their responsibilities. In light of these findings, the Subcommittee believes that the critically important question--to whom are Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans accountable--needs to be examined, both in terms of correcting the problems revealed by this investigation and in the wider context of the current debate on health care reform. Every effort must be made to improve the performance of Boards of Directors and State insurance regulators in holding Plan officials accountable and protecting the policyholders' interests. For example, consideration should be given to mandating the establishment of voluntary subscriber watchdog groups, to monitor Plan performance and represent subscribers' interests before Plan Boards of Directors, State legislatures and regulatory bodies, and other relevant entities.\\9\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ Similar consumer advocacy organizations were established in the late 1970s and early 1980s to represent the interests of utility ratepayers. These advocacy organizations, known as ``Citizens' Utility Boards'' (CUB), currently exist in states such as Wisconsin, California, Illinois, and Oregon. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Subcommittee also notes that the NAIC has recently formed a Special Committee to look at issues relating to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans, and thus strongly recommends that the question of accountability be placed high on its agenda. In considering health care reform, this question of accountability must be carefully addressed by the President, Congress, as well as other interested parties. 3. insolvency safeguards The disastrous effects of the West Virginia Plan's failure--in unpaid claims and diminution in and/or loss of coverage--emphasized the need for measures to provide added protection for other Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plan subscribers in the event of an insolvency. At the time of our investigation, only 25 of the more than 70 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans were participating in state guaranty funds. The Subcommittee notes that the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association has moved to require its member Plans to either participate in a state guaranty fund or institute some other acceptable type of financial safeguard (e.g. creating a special reserve). In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is presently considering whether and how Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans can and/or should be integrated into state guaranty fund systems. While the Subcommittee is encouraged by the Association's action in this regard, we believe that State regulatory authorities also need to be involved to assure that concrete action to protect policyholders is undertaken as quickly as possible. Accordingly, we recommend that the NAIC expedite its efforts along these lines and that, in addition to these efforts, individual State legislatures and insurance departments act to ensure that Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plan policyholders in their jurisdictions are afforded protection against an insolvency. 4. uniform solvency standards A number of witnesses discussed the absence of uniform solvency standards and financial reporting requirements regarding the Plans of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system. For example, the District of Columbia Superintendent of Insurance indicated that the dramatically different solvency standards in effect in the District, Maryland, and Virginia were not in the policyholders' best interests. The clear implication is that while the D.C. Plan might reach a stage where it would be considered insolvent in one State, it could theoretically still continue to operate in another State whose solvency requirements it had not violated. The Subcommittee recommends that the NAIC and Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Association, jointly or separately, develop specific solvency standards, financial reporting requirements, and other additional measures as needed, to apply uniformly to all Plans. The Subcommittee notes that both the NAIC and Association have already begun to consider such questions and urges them to make this effort a high priority and bring it to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible. The Subcommittee further recommends that the NAIC and State regulatory authorities mandate the use of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the reporting of financial information by insurers. As stated in the Subcommittee's Third Interim Report on efforts to combat fraud and abuse in the insurance industry,\\10\\ statutory accounting principles--the other accounting methodology used in the reporting of financial information--are too flexible to provide an accurate picture of an insurer's financial soundness. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ Third Interim Report on United States Government Efforts to Combat Fraud and Abuse in the Insurance Industry: Enhancing Solvency, Regulation and Disclosure Requirements--A Case Study of Guarantee Security Life Insurance Company, Senate Report 103-29, March 23, 1993. The other two reports issued by the Subcommittee pursuant to its investigation of the insurance industry are: Interim Report on Combatting Fraud and Abuse in Employer Sponsored Health Benefit Plans, Senate Report 102-262, March 12, 1992; and, Second Interim Report on U.S. Government Efforts to Combat Fraud and Abuse in the Insurance Industry: Problems with the Regulation of the Insurance and Reinsurance Industry, Senate Report 102-310, July 1, 1992. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. information sharing The Subcommittee found that a great deal of important information regarding the financial problems and management abuses in the Plans examined was in the hands of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association and the concerned State regulatory authorities before the Plans became impaired. Such information, according to the Subcommittee staff and other witnesses, was not shared between or among these various entities, with clearly adverse effects. Without such information, state insurance authorities were not fully aware of the severity of the problems at a given Plan, nor did they have sufficient information upon which to make the most informed and timely regulatory decisions. In response to this situation, the Subcommittee recommends that: --Lthe Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association in a timely manner share all relevant information regarding both itself and the individual Plans with the appropriate state and federal regulatory authorities; --Lstate insurance authorities improve and expand their procedures to share information concerning a Plan operating simultaneously in several jurisdictions, such as the instant case of the D.C. Plan and its activities in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia; and, --Lagencies of the U.S. Government involved in some official capacity with Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans, such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Personnel Management, develop procedures to make available to the appropriate state insurance authorities all reports and reviews of Plan operations. B. Regulation/Oversight 6. more effective State and Federal role The Subcommittee received testimony conclusively showing that in the cases examined State insurance regulators, as well as OPM and HHS regarding the FEHBP and Medicare, were unable and/or unwilling to deal effectively with the Plans operating in their jurisdictions and/or areas of responsibility. The Subcommittee strongly believes that regulatory authorities can and should do more in their efforts to oversee the Plans of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system and recommends that States: --Lprovide increased staff, training, and resources to their insurance regulatory bodies; --Lestablish cost containment guidelines and develop related incentives to encourage compliance; --Lrequire that the information used as the basis for granting rate increases be made available to the public; --Lutilize existing subpoena and/or investigatory authority and, where none exists, seek such powers from their legislatures; and, --Lseek enactment of statutory authority to: * Lprohibit the creation or alteration of subsidiaries and affiliates without prior written notice; * Lestablish specific reporting requirements including, but not necessarily limited to, audited financial statements for all wholly- owned subsidiaries or affiliates, detailed consolidated financial statements, and internal and external audits or studies; * Lexamine all books and records of affiliates and subsidiaries at any time deemed necessary; * Lrequire that a Plan get prior written approval for a sale or liquidation of any significant assets; * Linstitute administrative fines applicable to the Plan, as well as its Officers and Directors, for failure to respond on a timely basis to lawful orders; * Lremove Officers and Directors if, after due process, a determination is made that members of either and/or both groups have failed to comply with lawful orders; and, * Lmake health insurance fraud a felony and enhance existing criminal and civil penalties for violation of relevant insurance laws and regulations. Regarding the FEHBP and Medicare, we recommend that: --LCongress and the Administration consider giving both OPM and HHS the authority to openly and competitively bid the FEHBP and Medicare Parts A and B contracts, and to contract directly with the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans, rather than the Association, in connection with the FEHBP and Medicare Part A contracts; --Lthe appropriate Congressional Committees review and consider providing additional resources for OPM's Contracting Office, the OPM Office of Inspector General and HHS Office of Inspector General to enable them to better perform their regulation and oversight functions; --LOPM and HHS establish cost containment guidelines and develop related incentives to encourage compliance; --LFederal contracts policies and procedures be revised as appropriate to: * Lrequire Plans to collect, utilize, and maintain standardized information before paying claims; * Lallow easier termination of a contractor for repeated violations of the contract or regulations and for failing to: cooperate with the Government in an audit or investigation; promptly provide access to files and records; and, resolve audit findings in an expeditious and reasonable manner; and, * Lin the case of the FEHBP, establish a centralized enrollment system. --LThe appropriate Committees of Congress should carefully review the annual amount of individual compensation health care contractors can charge the Federal government in combined salary and benefits. 7. intermediate enforcement measures The Subcommittee found that State insurance regulators and officials of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association were severely hampered in their efforts to respond to the abuses and problems found in the Plans examined because they felt that the only enforcement tool available to them was in the form of ``an ultimate weapon.'' For State regulators, this meant declaring a Plan insolvent and placing it into receivership; for the Association, it meant acting to remove a Plan's Blue Cross/Blue Shield trademarks. The Subcommittee recommends that the Association, the NAIC, and/or individual State insurance authorities act expeditiously to develop and institute intermediate enforcement measures, including fines against the Association and/or its officers. Efforts along these lines might be undertaken by the NAIC and the Association jointly. 8. federal criminal/civil sanctions for insurance fraud To ensure that health benefits and insurance premiums are adequately protected from internal fraud and abuse, Congress and the Administration should consider establishing Federal criminal and civil sanctions for the violation of fiduciary responsibilities within the insurance industry. The health insurance industry is entrusted with billions of dollars of subscribers premiums and, as such, has a fiduciary duty to see to it that those funds are not squandered or misappropriated. The Subcommittee believes that its Blue Cross/Blue Shield investigation highlights the need for such sanctions, for example, as indicated by the possibility that in certain cases involving hospital/provider discounts and coinsurance payments some Blues Plans may have violated prohibited transaction requirements stipulated by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA). Indeed, the Subcommittee further recommends that these potential ERISA violations be reviewed by the Department of Labor, the agency responsible for overseeing the activities carried out pursuant to this law. 9. review of plan non-profit tax benefits The Subcommittee found that the Blues Plans examined abused their non-profit status, e.g., West Virginia Plan managers engaged in a highly risky type of investment trading that its auditors said was not appropriate for a company of its type. In addition, top managers of these Plans operated them in a grossly irresponsible manner, for example, by using policyholders' premiums for excessive executive compensation packages, lavish parties and entertainment, luxury travel and transportation, and charitable contributions. Given these abuses, the Subcommittee recommends that the Administration review the Federal tax status of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association and the individual Plans of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system, to ascertain whether they continue to warrant the special tax advantages accorded them as non-profits. 10. enhancing District of Columbia insurance authority The Subcommittee believes that the District of Columbia should continue its efforts to swiftly enact and implement the legislation and regulations necessary to enable its Superintendent of Insurance to effectively oversee GHMSI's operations. Toward this end, the Subcommittee recommends that the Congress provide all necessary support, including, but by no means limited to, enacting legislation to dissolve GHMSI's Congressional charter. VI. APPENDIX: CASE STUDIES THE WEST VIRGINIA PLAN A. Background/Organization Blue Cross/Blue Shield of West Virginia, Inc. (the West Virginia Plan) was incorporated as a non-profit health service corporation in West Virginia in 1983. Headquartered in Charleston, it employed approximately 700 employees over the seven years it was in existence and, at its peak in 1983 had some 379,000 subscribers. It was formed as a result of a merger between Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Southern West Virginia (Charleston) and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Northern West Virginia (Wheeling). In 1984, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans of Morgantown merged with the West Virginia Plan, completing the consolidation of Blue Cross and Blue Shield operations in the State with one exception--West Central Blue Cross/Blue Shield (Parkersburg). During its seven-year existence, the West Virginia Plan's organizational structure consisted primarily of three types of entities: those involved in underwriting and servicing its core lines of Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance business; a for- profit stock holding company; and, a number of for-profit joint ventures with the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The for-profit external business activities were deeply involved in the West Virginia Plan's rapid financial decline and ultimate collapse. B. Financial Profile The Plan, according to its financial records, incurred losses in all but two years of its existence. Total losses amounted to approximately $69 million, while about $13 million was made in 1984 and 1985.\\11\\ By 1987, the Plan was insolvent and its reserves (or net worth) continued to decline drastically, so that by the end of 1989 they had reached a negative balance of $31 million. Ironically, while the number of subscribers dropped from a high of 379,385 at the end of 1983 to 273,695 in 1989, during the same period the premium income increased from $213 million to $252 million. However, despite this increase in premium income, the Plan still lost money. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Although Plan gains exceeded losses in 1984 and 1985, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association noted that the entire system experienced similar profitability trends at that time, influenced by an upturn in the underwriting cycle and a nationwide drop in health care claims. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. Problem Areas The Plan's decline, insolvency, and ultimate seizure by the West Virginia Insurance Department in 1990 were primarily caused by a combination of: mismanagement; inadequate Board of Directors' oversight of management policies and actions; and, inadequate regulation and enforcement by the West Virginia Insurance Department.\\12\\ While not found to be a factor that directly contributed to the Plan's failure, inadequate oversight of Plan operations and activities on the part of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association was also a problem area. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Plan officials James Heaton (President and Chief Executive Officer), Salvatore Torrisi (Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer), and Donald Wagenheim (Chairman of the Board of Directors) maintained that the Plan's problems and collapse were not a consequence of their mismanagement, but the result of factors beyond their control, including cost shifting from West Virginia hospitals and a general decline in the West Virginia economy. While such factors may have contributed to the Plan's problems in some small way, the overwhelming evidence accumulated by the Subcommittee shows they cannot explain the Plan's dramatic decline and ultimate failure. If controlling, such factors logically should have also affected the Parkersburg Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plan. However, there was no evidence of any major adverse effects on the Parkersburg Plan, which was profitable until its merger with Blue Cross/Blue Shield Mutual of Ohio (the Cleveland Plan). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Mismanagement a. Flawed Management Approach Regulatory officials, Plan employees, Board members, consultants, and outside accountants provided testimony on management's questionable actions and decisions. The Plan's Labor Consultant from 1985-1990 said that the management was so bad he could only assume that the Plan was being ``managed to fail.'' A former Plan Executive Vice President, with 20 years of experience working at various Blue Cross/Blue Shield organizations resigned in 1986 after having concluded that Jim Heaton's policies and actions were leading the Plan to a ``significant downward turn [and] turbulent financial ride.'' In addition, a management consultant with years of Blue Cross/ Blue Shield experience, hired by Heaton in 1984 to head the Plan's planning staff, advised the Subcommittee Staff that upon becoming familiar with Heaton's management style and major policy decisions, he concluded that the Plan was doomed and resigned. Fred E. Wright, the former Insurance Commissioner for the period 1985-1988, said the Plan's 1984 decision to buy the old Sears Building in South Charleston to turn into its new corporate headquarters was ``a crazy idea.'' He called the purchase ``puffery...an edifice to the glory of management,'' which was not justified by the Plan's needs, made at a time when the Plan had serious financial problems (e.g., in 1983, the Plan had $2.4 million in underwriting losses and, at the end of the same year, had a surplus sufficient to cover only one week's claims). b. Proliferation of Subsidiaries Heaton and other Plan officers established a number of for- profit subsidiaries and affiliates that were essentially for their personal gain rather than for the benefit of the subscribers. This scheme, which was part of a reorganization launched by Heaton in 1984, violated management's fiduciary responsibility to the subscribers. Though funded by Blue Cross/ Blue Shield money, the potential profits from these ventures would not have benefitted the Plan or its subscribers. Heaton said that he saw nothing wrong with establishing these for- profit affiliates and subsidiaries, further underscoring his apparent lack of appreciation for any fiduciary responsibility to the Plan's subscribers. These for-profit external businesses also violated the ``corporate opportunity doctrine,'' which holds that a director or officer of a corporation may not take advantage of a business opportunity that rightly belongs to the corporation. In a 1984 letter, for example, one of the Plan's legal advisors warned: The plan of reorganization * * * raises several areas of concern dealing with the `corporate opportunity doctrine'. * * * [A] sale of all of the stock of the subsidiary of Blue Cross/Blue Shield to the individual members, or a corporation controlled by the members, even at fair market value, might raise concerns as to whether the members were taking a 'business opportunity' from Blue Cross/Blue Shield. * * * In the present situation, corporate officers and directors might be considered to be taking personal advantage of an enterprise already profitable to Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Although the motive for splitting-off the subsidiary corporation is bona fide, the fact that future profits may be diverted from the parent corporation to individual directors or members raises at least the specter of impropriety. Finally, these external ventures diverted millions of dollars (at least $1.8 million in start-up costs alone, according to Insurance Department figures) from other areas of activity at a time when the Plan was experiencing serious financial problems. As one Insurance Department auditor explained: The problem with the subsidiaries was especially serious since it would appear to aggravate the already shaky financial condition of the West Virginia Plan. It is one matter to create subsidiaries, but it was particularly troubling to find the Officers and Board considering to diversify and create a multitude of affiliates and subsidiaries when the parent Plan was losing money. Our question was where the money would come from to pay for these new ventures. c. Internal Control Deficiencies In a 1987 examination, the Plan's outside accountants, Ernst & Young, identified numerous deficiencies in the Plan's internal system of controls, recordkeeping, and accounting practices. It took 68 pages in their report to detail the weaknesses found and to list the extensive improvements needed. Most significantly, Ernst & Young cited five material weaknesses in the Plan's internal accounting controls for accounts receivable and investment activity.\\13\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ A material weakness is a deficiency in an entity's internal control structure so significant that there is more than a relatively low risk that errors or irregularities may occur and not be detected within a timely period. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During this same internal control examination it was also discovered that the Plan was engaged in a highly risky type of investment trading--hedging and speculating in stock price fluctuations--which the auditors believed was neither appropriate for a company of its type nor permissible under the West Virginia Insurance Code.\\14\\ Records indicate that Plan management had only a limited knowledge of how the market for these investments actually worked or the potential for significant losses. While the Plan subsequently ceased this investment activity, its involvement still resulted in more than $2.3 million in losses. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ The Insurance Department subsequently determined that the Plan's participation in these investments was, in fact, a violation of the West Virginia Insurance Code because borrowed money was used to finance the transactions. The Department filed a $2.3 million suit against Shearson Lehman Brothers and E.F. Hutton, the firms that advanced loans for the transactions and advised the Plan on the specific investment strategy utilized. This suit was settled in August 1993 for $775,000. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- d. Questionable/Poor Underwriting Practices Numerous sources said that the Plan was consistently undermined by ill-advised underwriting decisions. The Vice President for Finance, for example, said that the Plan took on new clients without properly underwriting that business, in order to generate more cash through premiums and recapture lost market share. This decision, he added, resulted in the Plan assuming more liabilities than it could handle. In a 1990 document, Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association auditors reported that the Plan's financial predicament was, in part, a result of its tendency to ``focus on enrollment rather than profitability.'' An analysis by the West Virginia Hospital Association concluded that one of the major factors that contributed to the Plan's failure was ``terrible underwriting decisions * * * throughout the 1980's which found Blue Cross acquiring business and then losing millions of dollars as they gambled to expand marketshare.'' e. Excessive Salaries While salaries hardly increased for the Plan's 700 or so employees, those for Heaton and the other nine highest paid officers rose precipitously. These increases occurred most pointedly between 1984-1989, when the Plan was in serious financial difficulty. For example, while total salaries for the Plan's top ten officers was approximately $575,000 in 1984, by 1989 that figure had risen to more than $900,000. During this same timeframe, Heaton's salary nearly doubled, from $85,000 to $160,000. 2. Inadequate Oversight by the Board of Directors The Subcommittee received considerable testimony on the Board of Directors' failure to perform its requisite oversight of management policies and performance. Instead of protecting the subscribers' interests, the Board was routinely manipulated and misled by management and, in some instances, became intertwined with the latter in questionable activity. In January, 1984 Heaton moved to create a new governing body within the existing Board, which effectively undermined the Board's ability to properly perform its responsibilities. This new governing body, the ``Board of Voting Members,'' came to be known as the ``Super Board,'' and was comprised of Heaton, Board Chairman Don Wagenheim, and a group of their hand-picked associates. The new Board of Voting Members was the only body empowered to: change the corporation's by-laws; elect the directors on the Board; and, nominate new voting members. In Heaton's words, ``control of the voting members allows for control of the board.'' \\15\\ Among other things, this ability to control the Board enabled Heaton to establish and operate the Plan's highly questionable for-profit external ventures with virtually no opposition from the Board.\\16\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ In a July 14, 1988 letter to the President of the District of Columbia Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plan. \\16\\ After discovering the creation of the Super Board in their 1984 audit of the Plan, Insurance Department examiners concluded that it violated state-mandated requirements regarding the Board's appropriate composition and directed that it be dissolved. The Department's subsequent 1986 examination found that the Plan had not complied with the earlier directive and the Super Board was still in existence. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In an affidavit submitted to the Subcommittee, one longtime Board member described the effect of the Super Board: This special creation of a ``Super Board'' caused some full Board members to resign. * * * Members became much, much less involved * * * [and] soon, the Board just went along with whatever management suggested, and questions were not asked at Board meetings. The Board was controlled and silenced. The evidence also established that management routinely misled and/or failed to inform the Board: --Lregarding the Plan's involvement in the risky investment activity--i.e., speculating in future stock price fluctuations--described above, Board Chairman Wagenheim told the Subcommittee Staff that ``he didn't understand it then and * * * wouldn't understand it today''; --Lthe Board was unaware that the Plan incurred more than $240,000 in expenses in settling a lawsuit brought by a female Plan employee in relation to her long- running affair with President Heaton; and, --Lalthough the Board was informed in early 1988 that the Plan was in a ``negative reserve'' condition, a Board member noted that the word ``insolvent'' was never mentioned (even though the Plan was insolvent at that time). She noted that: * * * Mr. Torrisi would continue giving optimistic forecasts for recovery. He would flash slides on viewgraphs, but not give us copies of the information. The graphs only gave limited snapshots of the financial condition of the Plan. Financial forecasts were handed out, but no one ever explained that the forecasts were just based on management's opinion. Questionable conduct on the part of Board Chairman Wagenheim may also partly explain the Board's failure to adequately carry out its responsibilities. In a number of instances while serving as Chairman and Board member, Wagenheim, at best, used very poor judgment or, at worst, behaved unethically and/or knowingly involved himself in an unlawful business transaction. Most notably, Wagenheim became deeply enmeshed in the process by which his firm, H.E. Neumann Construction Company, was awarded a $723,000 contract from the Plan to do work in connection with the renovation of its Charleston headquarters building. In the Insurance Department's 1986 examination of the Plan, the auditing team learned that Wagenheim's firm received the contract even though it had not submitted the low bid and had not been recommended by the architectural and design firm that oversaw the bid process. The auditors felt that this was a ``sweetheart deal,'' in violation of West Virginia law and recommended that Wagenheim be removed as Board Chairman.\\17\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ West Virginia law (Chapter 33, Sec. 4-17 and 33-24-4) strictly bars officers and directors of an insurance company and/or Blue Cross/ Blue Shield Plan from profiting from their position in transactions with the company. As explained below (see p. 24), the audit report containing this recommendation was never filed and, therefore, no action was taken to remove Wagenheim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When deposed by the Subcommittee Staff, Wagenheim admitted that he appointed the Building Committee that determined which contractors would be solicited for bids and what bids would be accepted. He also admitted that the Plan did not publicly advertise bids for the rehabilitation of the new headquarters renovation; instead, the Building Committee sent out invitations to a limited number of companies--including H.E. Neumann--to submit bids. In his deposition, Wagenheim saw no problem with his actions in connection with the contract award and no mention was made regarding it during Board and Executive Committee meetings at that time. Indeed, one member expressly said that she first heard about this situation only when informed by the Subcommittee Staff. Chairman Wagenheim, it should be noted, also served as Board Chairman of a number of the for-profit enterprises the Plan's management established during the 1980s, which were intended to benefit certain Plan officials and Board members. 3. Inadequate Regulation by the Insurance Department The West Virginia Insurance Department's efforts to oversee the Plan and protect the interests of its subscribers were inadequate. While the regulators knew about the Plan's problems almost from its merger-based inception in 1983, they did not move against it until 1990, by which time it had been insolvent for almost three years and was essentially beyond any hope of recovery. This inaction resulted from both the Plan's ability to evade regulatory efforts and the Department's own inability and/or unwillingness to take appropriate action in a timely manner. Past and present senior Department officials testified that they had neither sufficient staff nor budget resources to properly oversee the Plan's operations and the other insurance companies under their jurisdiction. Former Commissioner Wright testified that when he took over, the Department was ``a mess,'' i.e., it had few experienced employees, was suffering from high turnover, and had no comprehensive management policy in place. In an affidavit provided to the Subcommittee, the Counsel to the Insurance Commissioner from 1982 to 1989 stated that: In 1982, the Department had a small number of employees, approximately 25 to 30. Only a handful of those employees were professionals and I was the only in-house attorney. We were charged with regulating the activities of approximately 20 to 25 domestic insurers, overseeing the business practices of over 1000 non- domestic insurers and regulating the activities of several thousand insurance agents and brokers. * * * The former Counsel also notes that although resources increased over time, during her tenure the Department still never had sufficient staff or budget to be able to fully carry out its regulatory functions. The Department's ability to do its work was also hampered by a lack of expertise and turn-over in the ranks of senior employees. During the Plan's short-lived existence (1983-1990), for example, there were three Commissioners and three Chief Examiners. One of the Chief Examiners was removed for incompetence and two of the three had no prior field examination experience. Shortly after the completion of the Department's 1986 examination of the Plan, the Chief Examiner left to take a job with the Plan. The Subcommittee also received testimony indicating that the Department's failure to act against the Plan was also a matter of its apparent unwillingness to do so. In 1984 and 1986, Department examiners reported the Plan's financial decline, as well as questionable conduct on the part of management and directors. In the 1986 report, the examiners recommended that the Department seek to remove Heaton, Torrisi, Wagenheim and most of the other Directors for violating their fiduciary duty. However, the Department did little if anything about either of these reports and their findings and recommendations. For reasons that remain unexplained, nearly a year intervened from the time the 1984 report was submitted to the Commissioner and when it was finally filed in 1985. The 1986 report was never filed and, therefore, remained unavailable to the public. In his deposition, former Commissioner Wright testified that the main reason that the 1986 report was never filed or acted upon was because ``there were just too many other more important and pressing things to do at the time,'' including the status of three financially distressed domestic insurers. Nevertheless, the point remains that the Department's failure to act on the report was to some considerable degree a matter of choice. Indeed, in his deposition former Commissioner Wright conceded that, in retrospect, he perhaps should have been more aggressive and followed up on his examiners' recommendations. The present Insurance Commissioner, Hanley C. Clark, told the Subcommittee Staff that in part he did not act sooner because he did not have the regulatory tools to do so.\\18\\ He said that when he obtained the needed additional regulatory authority in March, 1990, with the passage of West Virginia House Bill 4195, he started to proceed against the Plan. Some legal experts, however, informed the Staff that even from a cursory reading of the Code, the Insurance Commissioner clearly had the discretionary authority to refuse to renew, suspend or revoke the license of the Plan for being ``in an unsound condition or in such condition as to render its further transaction of insurance in West Virginia hazardous to its policyholders or to the people of West Virginia.'' \\19\\ Indeed, Department representatives, such as current General Counsel, Keith Huffman, and former Commissioner Wright, testified that they did not use regulatory tools available to them, such as public hearings and subpoena power, because of concerns about litigation: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ Prior to being named Commissioner in January, 1989, Mr. Clark was either the Deputy or acting Commissioner for much of the Plan's existence. \\19\\ West Virginia Insurance Code, Sec. 33-3-11 (4). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Senator NUNN. But you had subpoena power, did you not? Mr. HUFFMAN. He [Commissioner Clark] had subpoena power, Senator, but * * * if the department would have issued subpoenas to * * * garner evidence * * * [from] the National [Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association or from] * * * E & Y [Ernst & Young], I guarantee you what would have happened is that those entities would have called down the street to their 200- or 300-lawyer firm and tied the department up [for] so long * * * that those subpoenas would not have been very effective at all. * * * Senator NUNN. Were you afraid to subpoena Blue Cross/ Blue Shield of West Virginia * * * because of their lawyers? Mr. WRIGHT. Senator, everything we did at that time involving what I would call the bad insurance companies or organizations developed into a war with lawyers. * * * Former and current officials also testified that the Plan quite literally fought the regulators at every turn. Former Commissioner Wright's Counsel, for example, stated that: The relationship between Blue Cross and the Department was rocky, full of contention and far from pleasant. My perception of Blue Cross was that it made little effort to cooperate with the Department and seemed to almost automatically take a position in opposition to suggestions or recommendations of the Department. I questioned Blue Cross' willingness to deal openly and fairly with the Department. Both the former and current Commissioners echoed the Counsel's remarks. In his testimony, for example, Commissioner Clark stated that: The relationship between the management of BCBSWV and the Department could be characterized, at a minimum, as very poor. In nearly every encounter with the BCBSWV management, the Department staff came to expect misinformation, deceit, arrogance, and defiance. Commissioners Wright and Clark indicated that nothing ever came easy in dealing with this Plan. Both described how they would have to threaten litigation before the Plan would voluntarily comply with a simple request that would be handled pro forma by any other insurance company. The Department's lead examiner on the 1986 exam, had this to say about his dealings with the Plan: Throughout this examination, the Plan's officers and employees exhibited an arrogance to the law and an unwillingness to cooperate with the examination. We quickly learned that the Plan's Officers felt they were 'above the law,' and were very well connected politically. The Plan's officers did not even attempt to hide their displeasure that we were there. 4. Inadequate Oversight by the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association The Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association's role regarding the Plan, indicates that it had sufficient information about the Plan's problems and authority to take decisive action, but failed to do so in a timely manner. In addition, the Association failed to adequately convey its knowledge of and concerns about the Plan's problems to the West Virginia Insurance Department. Beginning in 1987, a year after the Plan's financial problems had led to a loss of nearly $3 million, the Association took the serious step of placing it on conditional status for failing to comply fully with a membership standard involving financial responsibility, i.e., failing to have sufficient reserves on hand to meet at least 1.5 months of potential claims. Conditional status was renewed in 1988, after Association staff made an on-site visit to the Plan to examine its 1987 performance results. In the March, 1988 report summarizing the results of their visit, the Association staff found that: the Plan's forecast of a $1.5 million gain in 1988 was unlikely and, instead, that significant losses could occur; the Plan could be out of operating cash by late summer of that year; and, because of the Plan's deteriorating financial condition, there could be intervention by the State Insurance Department. In 1989, conditional status was again renewed, when the Plan failed to meet the same reserve and liquidity requirements it had not met in 1988, and also failed to satisfy a requirement that financial reports be submitted in an accurate and timely manner. The conditional status for 1989 reflected the Association's April, 1989 review of the Plan, which found that it had experienced four years of enrollment and market share decline, in addition to net losses of $22 million and $19 million in 1987 and 1988, respectively. The April review also pointed out that it was the Plan's ``precarious financial condition'' that forced it to be placed on conditional status in 1987 and 1988, and that management's response to these problems had been largely unsuccessful. Finally, in the spring of 1990, the Association's Plan Performance and Monitoring Committee voted for non-renewal of the Plan's license, the most serious sanction available to it. However, a non-renewal recommendation could have been made at least a year earlier, after the Plan had experienced three consecutive years of declining financial performance and two consecutive years of non-compliance with the financial responsibility membership standard. At the very least, an earlier threat of non-renewal of the Plans's membership by the Association might have prompted an affiliation or some other action that could have helped avert the Plan's ultimate seizure and liquidation. According to Association officials, action was not taken sooner because of a series of promising developments, all of which, however, eventually ``fizzled.'' In 1988, the West Virginia Plan and the District of Columbia Plan (GHMSI) had begun affiliation negotiations. In addition, at the end of 1988 the Plan's accountants, Ernst & Young, projected a $6.8 million gain for 1989. Although this projection did not materialize and West Virginia's problems continued in 1989, the Association officials noted that the talks with GHMSI were ongoing and Ernst & Young had again forecast positive results for 1990--a projected gain of $8.9 million.\\20\\ Then, in early 1990, hopes were again raised when Commissioner Clark approved a significant rate increase for the Plan and affiliation talks began with the Cleveland Plan. The Association officials also stated that they did not move earlier to rescind the Plan's membership status because that is a drastic measure they only use as a last resort. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ The Subcommittee staff were surprised to learn that Association officials were unaware that the Ernst & Young forecasts were compilations, rather than examinations. The officials told the staff that since the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner had requested and relied upon the forecasts, it never occurred to them that the forecasts were not independently audited or verified. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to the Insurance Department, the Association concealed the true nature and extent of its concerns regarding the Plan's problems and, by so doing, effectively contributed to delays on the regulator's part to act against the Plan before it became irreparably impaired. As early as 1986, the Association was fully aware of the Plan's deteriorating financial condition and had placed it on conditional status in 1987. The Association, however, failed to notify the Department of this action and also failed to do so again in 1988 and 1989, when the Plan's conditional status was continued.\\21\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ In his deposition, Plan President Heaton said that as a former member of the Association's Board of Directors and with his more than 20 years of experience in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system, he found that the Association uses three techniques to stave off a Plan's failure. It will first approach the regulators to get rate increases. If that doesn't work, it will put political pressure on the regulators--including, for example, going as far as threatening to pull a Plan's trademark and service marks, which Heaton said he saw done in the case of the New Jersey Plan. Finally, if all else fails, a merger with another Plan will be pursued. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commissioner Clark testified that in meetings from May 17- 23, 1988, Association representatives told Department staff that the Plan was not experiencing more financial difficulties than any other Plan in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield system, and that these problems were related to a normal downturn in the insurance cycle being experienced by all health insurers. According to this testimony, Department staff were told that the situation would improve in 1989. Commissioner Clark also testified that the Association representatives advised the Department that drastic action was not needed, although at the same time they said that the Department ought to continue to monitor the Plan. The Commissioner explained the Department's ``huge dilemma'' in this regard as follows: Under laws in existence in the State of West Virginia, if the Department sought rehabilitation or liquidation of the plan, it would be faced with a full adversarial hearing * * * in which it would be necessary to demonstrate (over the strenuous objections of management) that [such action] was in the `interest of the policyholders, creditors, stockholders, members, subscribers, or the public'. * * * As a practical matter, the Department needed the support of * * * the National [Association] against BCBSWV management in order to take affirmative action. * * * There would have to be expert testimony that the plan was insolvent and would not recover on its own * * *, as well as a workout plan to help retire the liabilities of BCBSWV * * * and provide a solvent merger or affiliation partner. * * * However, * * * the National [was] aligned against such measures.'' \\22\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ In its role as Receiver, the Insurance Department filed a civil suit against the Association in January 1992, alleging that its conduct in connection with the Plan's failure was ``willful, wanton, and malicious'' and in violation of the West Virginia Unfair Trade Practices Act. The suit called for $34 million to cover outstanding claims resulting from the Plan's failure; $10 million in extra contractual damages for annoyance, inconvenience, hardship, and mental anguish; and, another $10 million for punitive damages. This suit was settled in March 1992, with the Association agreeing to pay the Department $8.6 million. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- D. Effects For thousands of West Virginia subscribers, providers, and others, their lives and/or businesses were thrown into turmoil as a result of the Plan's failure. The Plan's demise left subscribers with more than $40 million in unpaid claims. An administrator of and participant in his small company's employee health benefits plan, testified that he personally lost $23,000 due to non-payment of benefits. The financial pressure placed on him and his family as a result of his unpaid medical bills became so great that at one point he seriously considered declaring bankruptcy. Another subscriber, who was left with more than $37,000 in unpaid medical bills for services rendered in treating her serious cancer condition, described the difficulties she faced: To stop the harassment from the medical providers for payment that they had been denied by the failed Blue Cross Plan, and to prevent creditors from putting a judgment against my home, I had to start making monthly payments. * * * Not only do I have to worry about having cancer, I now have to worry about the bills. * * * This constant worry about the medical bills and where the money is going to come from to pay them has put me under a lot of additional stress, as I worry about the possibility of losing our home. At the time of the Subcommittee's hearings this individual had no health insurance at all. Some West Virginia Plan subscribers were also dramatically affected by premium increases. For example, one of the witnesses who testified about the impact of the Plan's failure explained that in the wake of its demise many firms were unwilling to trust the successor plan, Mountain State Blue Cross/Blue Shield. When some of these firms signed up with other health insurers, Mountain State increased premiums for its high-risk subscribers by more than 60%. This action, he said, ``hit home'' for him because the pastor of his church had to drop his family's coverage when his premiums increased from $500 to over $800 a month. In their testimony, the Subcommittee Staff confirmed that many West Virginia Plan subscribers lost their coverage as a result of this staggering premium increase.\\23\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\23\\ Generally speaking, the Plans examined by the Subcommittee had little difficulty in obtaining desired premium increases. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lastly, the Subcommittee also found that the Plan's failure had major consequences for providers. Testimony submitted by the West Virginia Hospital Association states that the more than $40 million in unpaid medical bills for services already provided to Plan subscribers had a ``substantial'' effect on providers. THE MARYLAND PLAN A. Background/Organization Tracing its roots back to predecessor organizations formed in the late 1930s, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan of Maryland (BCBSM) was established as a result of the 1985 merger of the State's separate Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. Headquartered in Owings Mills, BCBSM was serving approximately 1.4 million Marylanders (nearly 30% of the State's population) in 1992. In addition, at the time of the Subcommittee's hearing, BCBSM employed approximately 4,500 individuals and in 1991 took in $1.7 billion in total revenue. From the mid-1980s onward, BCBSM's organizational structure included three types of operational entities: those involved in underwriting and servicing its core Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance business; for-profit subsidiaries with some health- related purpose; and, for-profit subsidiaries with no health- related purpose. In 1985, BCBSM's structure was fairly simple, consisting of the parent company and two subsidiaries. By 1991, however, it had become extremely complicated by the addition of another 29 subsidiaries and three limited partnerships. B. Financial Profile From 1986 through 1988, BCBSM incurred operating losses of $110 million and its net worth declined dramatically from $67 million to $17 million.\\24\\ Reflecting these losses and reduced net worth, a 1987 Maryland Insurance Division examination found that BCBSM had achieved a deficit position of $1.2 million.\\25\\ Between 1985 and 1989 the Plan's reported reserves declined precipitously from $122 million to $16 million. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ Since 1989, BCBSM has reported operating gains of $121 million and an increase in net worth of $85 million as of June 30, 1992. However, according to the Subcommittee staff, these figures may be substantially overstated because accepted accounting rules and asset valuation procedures have not been strictly followed by BCBSM. See related discussion below, p. 42. \\25\\ This examination was never formally completed. See related discussion below, p. 39. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In a July 17, 1992 letter to the Governor, the Maryland Insurance Commissioner, John A. Donaho, observed that, ``in broad terms, BCBSM may be 60-65 percent weaker at December 31, 1991 than it was at December 31, 1984.'' On the basis of its April, 1992 business performance review of BCBSM, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association concluded that the Plan's reserve position was ``low and tenuous.'' Since 1986, the Plan's subsidiary companies had incurred total losses of $120 million. During this same timespan the Plan made capital infusions of more than $170 million to its HMO and non-insurance subsidiaries. Between 1987 and 1990, BCBSM's external auditors refrained from issuing a ``going concern'' audit opinion on its HMO subsidiaries, but only after Plan officials said that they would guarantee the latters' solvency.\\26\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ A going concern opinion indicates that the auditors have substantial doubt that the entity examined will be in business one year from the date of the audit. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. Problem Areas Some of the same key factors associated with the demise of the West Virginia Plan were present in varying degrees at BCBSM.\\27\\ Specifically, the testimony established four broad problem areas: mismanagement; inadequate oversight by the Board of Directors; inadequate regulation by the Maryland Insurance Division; and, inadequate oversight by the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association.\\28\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ In their testimony the Subcommittee staff offered two cautionary notes on this point. First, they explained that while there were major similarities in the problems at the West Virginia and BCBSM Plans, there were also a number of important differences, including: no evidence was uncovered that top BCBSM officers or Board members had engaged in self-dealing or created subsidiaries for their personal enrichment; and, BCBSM's President did not create a ``Super Board,'' consisting of himself and certain hand-picked associates, in an effort to control the Plan and circumvent existing regulatory requirements. Second, the Staff cautioned that the similarities in the Plans' problems did not mean that BCBSM was on the verge of imminent failure. Rather, they suggested that BCBSM could ultimately become as impaired as the West Virginia Plan, if its problems were not addressed in a timely manner. \\28\\ BCBSM officials did not dispute the Subcommittee's findings, although in their testimony they did cite other factors--e.g., the 1986-1988 downturn in the health insurance industry, increased competition from for-profit insurance companies, and dramatic changes in health care industry products and services--to explain the situation that confronted the Plan from the time of its establishment in 1985. However, within a week of the hearings, the Board met and removed Carl Sardegna as its Chairman and appointed a special committee to examine the issues raised by the Subcommittee. The results of this special committee's review corroborated virtually all of the Subcommittee's findings regarding BCBSM's management and operations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Mismanagement As in the West Virginia Plan, mismanagement and questionable management decisions were inextricably bound up in BCBSM's financial difficulties. An August 11, 1992 letter from Commissioner Donaho to the Governor seriously questioned BCBSM's management decisions: The Blue's generally poor financial condition is a result of years of a combination of mismanagement and inadequate rates.
