        "text": "Do the Right Thing portrays a vibrant, predominantly African American Brooklyn neighborhood on the hottest day of the summer. The heat brings simmering tensions to a boil after neighborhood regular Buggin’ Out (Giancarlo Esposito) confronts pizzeria owner Sal (Danny Aiello) for not featuring any Black actors on his Italian Wall of Fame. The ensuing face-off leads to a tragic conclusion that, more than 30 years later, still seems ripped from today’s headlines.\n\nThe film’s illustrious cast also includes Spike Lee, Rosie Perez, Bill Nunn, John Turturro, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Lawrence, Robin Harris, and more. Named to the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry in 1999, this classic is backed by a beautiful Bill Lee score (Spike’s father) and numerous rap hits, most notably Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power.” (120 mins., DCP)\n\nOn December 4, 2020, a 23-year-old Black man named Casey Goodson Jr. was murdered by law enforcement in Columbus, Ohio. John Landry’s short film Standing in The Blink of a Night (2020) both honors Goodson’s life and reckons with the aftermath of his murder. Winner of the 2021 Ohio Shorts Jury Prize, selected by juror Prentiss Haney. (6:02 mins., DCP)"
