        "text": "Bill Nunn, best known for playing Radio Raheem in Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing, has died. He was 62.\n\nLee shared the news on his Instagram and Facebook accounts, writing that the actor passed away Saturday morning (Sept. 24) in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Nunn’s wife confirmed to the Associated Press that he had been battling cancer.\n\nGone But Not Forgotten: In Memoriam 2016\n\nNunn made his film debut in Lee’s musical-comedy School Daze in 1988 and collaborated with the filmmaker on multiple features in the following years. After landing his well-known role as Radio Raheem and blasting Public Enemy‘s “Fight the Power” on the streets of Brooklyn in Do the Right Thing, he subsequently starred in Lee’s Mo’ Better Blues and He Got Game alongside Denzel Washington.\n\n“Radio Raheem is now resting in power. Radio Raheem will always be fighting da powers dat be,” Lee captioned an image of Nunn from the 1989 film. “May God watch over Bill Nunn.”\n\nTrending on Billboard"
