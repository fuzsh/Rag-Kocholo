        "text": "While walking down the block in my neighborhood, I noticed a sign that read, “Rest in Power”. It struck me because normally people would say Rest in Peace. I knew it had to be someone special because it was posted at the office of film director, actor, producer and writer Spike Lee. He always makes signs that recognize people that are loved and lost. This time it was about the recent death of Bill Nunn, whose battle with leukemia ended in September. It is a disease that causes the body to be unable to fight off infection. It can affect the bone marrow and the heart. Mr. Nunn died at the age of 63 and he leaves a wife and two children. I was unable to find a will but if he died without a will his estate will be handled under the laws of intestacy we know that his wife will get the first $50,000 plus ½ of everything left behind. Bill Nun was an actor and his estate is a little over one million dollars.\n\nThe spike lee movie that Bill Nunn acted in is “ Do the right thing” he played the character by the name of Radio Raheem. This movie was set in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn in the 90’s, in the summer heat and it followed the lives of the black community. Mr. Nun roll in the film was symbolic to me because his gold rings that read Love and Hate. Which is what we are facing in the world today. The difference between real life and movie is that the director cannot say cut if someone says or does something hateful. The film taught everyone to always do the right thing and as Mr. Nunn/ Radio Raheem carried around the radio in the movie. He played truth lyrics by conscious rappers who made sure that the community looked beyond there everyday lives to the future.\n\nSadden by the death of this actor; we know that he was also a man that had to live in this world and deal with life after the cameras stopped rolling. So he received an education by graduating from Morehouse College in Atlanta, all male Historical Black College, while there he worked with students at Spelman College in the arts of acting. Then he later formed a project, called Bill Nunn Theatre Outreach Project to help public school students learn the arts profession. Students were able to win scholarship money for college and help build self- esteem to those who don’t always have a father figure. I’m sure his presence will be missed on stage, in movies and mostly in the live of his wife, children and close friends."
