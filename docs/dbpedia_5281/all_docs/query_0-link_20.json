        "text": "Pittsburgh, PA -\n\nSeasoned actor Bill Nunn, widely recognized for his roles in several of Hip Hop fans’ favorite movies, has passed away at the age of 62.\n\nAs a longtime collaborator of Spike Lee, Nunn actually got his acting start in the iconic filmmaker’s 1988 college lifestyle flick, School Daze and went on to assist Lee in memorable cinema such as Mo’ Better Blues, He Got Game and most notably, Do the Right Thing, where he portrayed Radio Raheem, the neighborhood Hip Hop head whose life would go on to impact an entire impassioned neighborhood in Brooklyn for a lifetime.\n\nLee led the charge on social media eulogies, confirming his passing that would dispel the rumors that were circulating within trending topics.\n\n“My Dear Friend, My Dear Morehouse Brother- Da Great Actor Bill Nunn As Most Of You Know Him As Radio Raheem Passed Away This Morning In His Hometown Of Pittsburgh,” Lee wrote on Facebook.\n\n“Long Live Bill NUNN. RADIO RAHEEM Is Now RESTING IN POWER. RADIO RAHEEM WILL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING DA POWERS DAT BE. MAY GOD WATCH OVER BILL NUNN.”\n\nNunn’s other top acting credits included starring as loyal henchman to Nino Brown, the Duh Duh Duh Man in the 1991 classic New Jack City and the role of Joseph “Robbie” Robertson in the 2000s Spider-Man trilogy starring Toby Maguire and directed by Sam Raimi.\n\nNo cause of death has been made public as of press time and Nunn is said to be survived by his wife Donna and their two children.\n\nAs news of his death began to spread online, social media tributes began multiply, especially within the rap community who shared parts of their lives watching his films."
