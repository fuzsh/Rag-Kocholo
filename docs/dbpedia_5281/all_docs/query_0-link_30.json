        "text": "I wasn’t in Do The Right Thing, but I was IN Do The Right Thing. Spike Lee’s third feature film began shooting on my birthday, July 18, 1988, in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Lee had been inspired by the 1986 murder of Michael Griffith, a Black man from Trinidad, to make a film that didn’t just tackle racial tension in America, but held it down on the blood-stained asphalt to stare at its reflection in the broken glass and dirty water that had pooled in the gutters. Griffith lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and was set upon by a mob of white men from Howard Beach, Queens, when he and his friends were leaving a local pizzeria. While trying to escape his attackers, Griffith ran in front of a moving car, driven by the son of a police officer, and was killed.\n\nRELATED: Celebrating The Women Of 'Do The Right Thing'\n\nWhile the subsequent trial played out in the papers (17-year-old Jon Lester served 15 years for the death before being deported back to his native England), I was on the B35 and B16 buses back and forth to middle school from my home in Flatbush, Brooklyn, a predominantly Black and West Indian enclave, to the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn, which was predominantly white. In the three years between Griffith’s murder and the release of Do The Right Thing in 1989, my personal lens on race had been irrevocably altered. Thanks to my education, my proximity to whiteness was not theoretical or abstract. I’d been welcomed into the homes of my Italian-American classmates but also had been called a \"spade\" and hit with eggs on my way home by those who only knew me as the Black kid on the bus. Compared to Griffith I’d gotten off easy, but when Public Enemy’s “Fight The Power” turned my favorite art form into more than just entertainment, my bones were shaken with the urgency of their message. By the time I sat down in the theater to see what Mr. Lee had to say about me and my hometown, I was ready and receptive. Before I could be conditioned to think my story didn’t matter, here I was, 13, impressionable, smart yet naive, about to watch the world I walked in projected onto a screen. Michael Griffith was not alive to see this, but I was.\n\nThe tragic story of a Brooklyn neighborhood torn asunder on the hottest day of the year remains one of Spike’s most nimble yet impactful scripts. Opportunity (or lack thereof) for financial independence, love, respect and recognition pushed the story forward in disparate but connected directions with racial tension serving as its corrosive nucleus.\n\n\"I think my job as a filmmaker is to shed light on the problems that face us and by examination of these problems, hopefully, an answer can be worked out,” Spike said in a documentary about the making of Do The Right Thing. “I think in order to fix a problem we have to acknowledge a problem is there.”\n\nIt’s been a rocky 30 years since the release of Do The Right Thing. America still hasn’t fully embraced the lessons about racial hatred, gentrification and police brutality that Spike Lee and his amazing cast unfurled for us that year. There are so many iconic moments that have endured and been cemented into the cultural lexicon (\"D, motherf*cker, D!\"), but there is so much that even I’m still learning about the creation of the film.\n\nSo, in recognition of the 30th anniversary of Do The Right Thing, I present “30 for 30,” facts you should know about Spike Lee’s classic. We scoured the internet for interviews, written and video, to unearth some gems."
