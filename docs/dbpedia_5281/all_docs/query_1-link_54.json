Currently, the only available vaccine for TB prevention is Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG). However, BCG demonstrates limited efficacy, particularly in adults. Efforts to develop effective TB vaccines have been ongoing for nearly a century. In this review, we have examined the current obstacles in TB vaccine research and emphasized the significance of understanding the interaction mechanism between MTB and hosts in order to provide new avenues for research and establish a solid foundation for the development of novel vaccines. We have also assessed various TB vaccine candidates, including inactivated vaccines, attenuated live vaccines, subunit vaccines, viral vector vaccines, DNA vaccines, and the emerging mRNA vaccines as well as virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines, which are currently in preclinical stages or clinical trials. Furthermore, we have discussed the challenges and opportunities associated with developing different types of TB vaccines and outlined future directions for TB vaccine research, aiming to expedite the development of effective vaccines. This comprehensive review offers a summary of the progress made in the field of novel TB vaccines.\n\nKeywords: tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), vaccines, clinical trials, deep learning\n\n1. Introduction\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease widely distributed across the world and is the leading cause of death from bacterial infections [1]. In 17–18th century Europe, TB was known as the “white plague”, with almost 100% of Europeans infected and 25% of them dying from the disease [2]. In 1882, Robert Koch, a German microbiologist, deciphered Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) as the etiological factor responsible for TB, thereby opening a new chapter in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of TB [3]. With the continuous development of anti-TB drugs and improvements in sanitation and living conditions, the incidence and mortality of TB decreased significantly. However, since the 1990s, the global TB epidemic has worsened due to factors such as the emergence of drug-resistant strains of MTB, the use of immunosuppressive agents, drug addiction, poverty, and population movements [4]. TB has become a leading re-emerging infectious disease and a serious global health problem, especially in developing countries.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of anti-TB drugs, eradicating TB still faces many challenges. On 27 October 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global TB Report showed that approximately one-quarter of the world’s population is infected with MTB [4]. In 2021, the estimated global number of new TB cases was 10.6 million, a 4.5% increase from 2020, and the number of deaths from TB was 1.6 million, a 6.7% increase from 2020 [5]. China is one of the countries with a high burden of TB, with an estimated number of TB cases only second to India and Indonesia, accounting for 7.4% of the global TB incidence [5]. In 2015, the WHO introduced the “End TB Strategy”, a comprehensive plan that outlines ambitious targets for the period of 2020–2035. These objectives include a significant reduction of 90% in the incidence of TB and a remarkable decrease of 95% in TB-related mortality compared to the 2015 levels by the year 2035 [6].\n\nVaccination stands as the most economically efficient method for the prevention and management of TB, serving as a crucial approach towards realizing the WHO’s Global End TB Strategy by 2035. One of the most successful measures in this regard is the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which has been widely deployed worldwide for 140 years since its inception [7]. Although BCG provides significant protection against severe TB in infants and young children, such as disseminated tuberculosis and meningeal tuberculosis [8], its protection against adult pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is limited, with varying efficacy and no effective protection against primary or latent TB infection caused by MTB [9,10,11]. Currently, approximately one-quarter of the world’s population has latent TB infection (LTBI), which has no clinical symptoms, and about 90% of LTBI patients do not progress to TB disease. However, this latent state is a potential source of active TB and a major obstacle to TB elimination [12]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more effective TB vaccines to prevent and control both latent and active infections caused by MTB.\n\nWith the rapid development of immunology and molecular biology, some new vaccines have entered clinical trial stages and have shown certain safety and protective efficacy. However, designing an ideal TB vaccine still faces many challenges, such as unclear pathogenic mechanisms of MTB, difficulty in screening for specific antigens, lack of ideal adjuvants, and the limitations of animal models. This article provides a review, analysis, and discussion of the immunological mechanisms of MTB–host interactions and the current status of new TB vaccine research in clinical trials. Challenges faced by TB vaccine research and future development directions are also discussed to provide a new perspective for the future development on TB vaccines.\n\n2. Infection and Immunity to MTB\n\nThe main route of transmission of MTB is through airborne particles, which enter the human body through respiration and initiate the infection of alveolar macrophages. Previous studies have shown that approximately 5% of infected individuals can completely clear MTB from their bodies, approximately 5–10% will develop active TB disease, and nearly 90% of infected individuals remain in a LTBI state [13]. This indicates that after MTB infection, only a small proportion of individuals have an immune system that can effectively recognize, monitor, and clear MTB, while the vast majority of individuals are in an LTBI state. Thus, the interaction between MTB and its host is extremely complex, and the occurrence, development, and outcome of TB are not only related to the virulence of MTB, but also closely related to the immunity of TB patients. Genetic differences lead to certain immune defects or abnormalities in TB patients, which affect the ability of the body to resist MTB infection [14,15]. After MTB infection, a series of immune responses are induced, mainly including innate immunity (also known as non-specific immunity) and adaptive immunity (also known as specific immunity) ( ). In this article, we will focus on the innate and adaptive immune responses induced by MTB and provide new insights for the research on new TB vaccines.\n\n2.1. Innate Immune Responses Induced by MTB\n\nInnate immune response plays a crucial role in the non-specific defense against MTB, and it is responsible for initiating adaptive immune response which specifically targets MTB [16]. Therefore, innate immunity serves as the first line of defense against MTB and is of utmost importance. The evolutionarily formed innate immune system is responsible for the defense function of innate immunity, which includes barrier, cellular, and molecular components. To resist MTB invasion, the host’s innate immune system relies on tissue barriers such as the mucosal barrier, physical and chemical barriers [17,18]. Concurrently, various components of the innate immune system, including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer T (NKT) cells, and γδT cells, contribute to the generation of immune responses that combat TB infection [19,20]. In addition, the host exerts its anti-tuberculosis immune response and immune regulation function through immune molecules such as cytokines IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-1β, MIP-1α/CCL3, chemotactic factors, complement molecules, antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, and βdefensins [21,22,23].\n\nMacrophages play a key role in the protective immune response against MTB by their potent phagocytic and bactericidal ability [24]. Macrophages possess the ability to detect the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) exhibited by MTB via specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicase receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) [25]. Subsequently, upon the recognition of MTB, macrophages employ a range of mechanisms, including autophagy, phagocytosis, apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inflammasome activation, to eliminate MTB from the system [26]. The interaction between PAMPs and PRRs induces macrophages to express various inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-1β, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α/CCL3) [27]. These cytokines recruit neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and monocytes to the site of infection, forming granulomas around infected cells to restrict bacterial spread [28].\n\nStructurally, granulomas are tightly organized aggregates with macrophages and other immune cells, including neutrophils, DCs, and NK cells, around the site of infection. DCs play a critical role in the anti-mycobacterial infection by being the most efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs). DCs not only present TB antigens to initial T cells but also connect innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Depending on the developmental stage of DC cells, they can be divided into immature DCs (iDCs) and mature DCs (mDCs) [29]. iDCs do not have the ability to secrete cytokines, but they have a strong antigen uptake ability. After antigen uptake, they gradually migrate to lymph nodes and present the antigen to effector T cells, thereby initiating adaptive immune response [30]. mDCs have the ability to produce cytokines and stimulate T cell differentiation, thus activating T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses [31].\n\nIn addition, NK cells and neutrophils also participate in the early innate immune response to the mycobacterial infection by producing non-specific cytokines and chemokines [32,33,34]. After the body is infected with MTB, NK cells can respond quickly. NK cells are not restricted by MHC and antibodies and can directly kill MTB inside and outside cells by producing cytolytic granules containing perforin, granulysin, and granzymes [35]. NK cells can mediate the response of CD8+ T effector cells by secreting cytokines such as IFN-γ. IFN-γ is the main cytokine secreted by NK cells and can enhance the antigen presentation ability of APCs by promoting the expression of MHC class molecules in monocytes and macrophages, thus participating in the control of MTB infection during the granuloma stage after MTB is recognized [36,37]. After MTB is recognized, neutrophils quickly arrive at the site of infection, and then activate and secrete a large number of chemokines, including ILs, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), monokine induced by IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1α), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP), IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10/CXCL10), and monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG, CXCL9) [38,39,40]. These chemokines can selectively recruit immune cells, including Th1 T cells, Th17 T cells, neutrophils, DCs, and NK cells to the site of infection. Moreover, the chemokines secreted by neutrophils can further enhance the recruitment of similar cells [41].\n\n2.2. Adaptive Immune Responses Induced by MTB\n\nUpon stimulation by MTB antigens, antigen-specific T/B lymphocytes undergo self-activation, proliferation, and differentiation into effector cells, generating a series of biological bactericidal effects. According to the different types of cells and mechanisms involved in the immune response, the adaptive immune response can be divided into two types: B cell-mediated humoral immune response and T cell-mediated cellular immune response.\n\n2.2.1. CD4+ T Cells and Their Differentiation and Balance\n\nCD4+ T cells are crucial effector cells in the host’s response to MTB infection [42]. Initially, native CD4+ T lymphocytes (Th0 cells) lack effector T cell function and only produce low levels of IL-2, while failing to produce IFN-γ, IL-4, or IL-5. DC cells take up MTB antigen and present it mainly through MHC II to Th0 cells. Activated Th0 cells differentiate into different types of helper T cells under the regulation of different cytokines, including Th1, Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells (Treg cells), etc. [43] ( ). DC cell-secreted IL-12 and IFN-γ can induce Th0 cells to differentiate into Th1 cells, while in the microenvironment of IL-2 and IL-4, Th0 cells differentiate into Th2 cells [44]. Th1 and Th2 cells are both effector T lymphocytes and play important roles in host resistance to MTB infection. During MTB infection, Th1 cells predominantly release crucial effector molecules like IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, which play a vital role in activating the macrophage system to effectively control and eliminate MTB [45]. These mechanisms involve the use of autophagy, reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, antimicrobial peptides, the initiation of downstream antimicrobial pathways, and lysosomal enzymes to combat the infection [46,47]. Although Th1 plays a major role in intracellular pathogen infection, the role of Th2 in combating MTB infection is also important. Th2 cells mainly secrete cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, etc., assist in the activation and proliferation of B cells, and participate in the regulation of humoral immunity [22,48,49,50]. Th1 and Th2 cells are regulatory cells that regulate each other through the cytokines they secrete, and they are in a dynamic balance state and play an important role in maintaining the balance of the immune response ( ). The imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells is also considered an important cause of TB. TB is not due to the lack of an effective Th1 response, but rather an excessive shift towards a Th2 response, with Th2 cytokines suppressing the action of Th1 cytokines [51].\n\nSimilarly, under the action of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and TGF-β, Th0 cells can differentiate into Th17 cells. Th17 cells, a novel subset of CD4+ effector T cells, have recently been discovered within the human body. These cells exhibit the ability to secrete various effector cytokines, including IL-17, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22. By producing such cytokines, Th17 cells facilitate the recruitment of neutrophils and IFN-γ-positive CD4+ T cells to the site of infection, subsequently playing a crucial role in combating MTB infection [52]. Interestingly, the recruitment function of Th17 cells cannot persist at all times. If its activity is too strong, Th1 and Th2 cells counteract the effects of Th17 cells by secreting cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-4, thus maintaining a dynamic equilibrium of the immune response ( ).\n\nTh0 cells can differentiate into Treg cells in response to IL-10 and TGF-β, in addition to differentiating into Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells. Both in vitro and in vivo, Treg cells exhibit immunosuppressive functions, characterized by the high expression of Foxp3, CD45RO, CTLA-4, CCR4, mTGF-β, GITR, and CD62L, as well as a low expression of CD45RA and CD127 (IL-7R), and a memory-like phenotype upon activation. Previous research has demonstrated higher frequencies of Treg cells and lower frequencies of IFN-γ-positive T cells in elderly tuberculosis patients, with Treg cell expansion closely related to MTB loads [53]. Human cohort studies have reported the lowest frequencies of Treg cells in healthy individuals, followed by those with LTBI, and the highest frequencies in ATB patients [54,55]. An increase in CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ cells is associated with the damage to Th1 responses and decreased in vitro microbial killing activity observed in both LTBI and TB cohorts [56].\n\nInterestingly, Treg and Th17 cells also possess a reciprocal inhibitory and balancing relationship. TGF-β can induce the expression of Foxp3 or RORγT in Th0 cells, and the expression of IL-6 plays a critical role in determining whether Th0 cells differentiate towards Treg or Th17 cells ( ) [57]. In the presence of IL-6, the balance tilts towards Th17 differentiation, whereas, in its absence, differentiation towards Treg cells predominates [58]. FoxP3 inhibits the function of RORγT, and prior studies have found that CD4+CD25+Foxp3+CD39+ Treg cells play a role in suppressing pathogenic Th17 cells [59,60]. Additionally, recent studies suggest that Treg cells can suppress pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells by expressing coinhibitory molecule T cell Ig and ITIM domain (TIGIT) [61].\n\n2.2.2. CD8+ T Cells and B Cells\n\nAlthough the critical role of CD4+ T cells in controlling MTB infection is well established, the roles of CD8+ T cells and B cells are increasingly being recognized. After phagocytizing MTB, dendritic cells present antigens to CD8+ T cells through MHC class I molecules, activating them into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs can lyse macrophages that have lost their immune activity by releasing perforin and granulysin. As a result, MTB loses its protection and can be eliminated by activated macrophages and NK cells [30,62,63,64]. Additionally, activated CTLs can secrete cytokines such as IFN-γ, stimulating monocytes and macrophages to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs) that induce direct cytotoxicity [65,66].\n\nT lymphocytes play a critical role in mediating adaptive immunity to clear MTB. However, recent studies have also revealed the importance of humoral immunity in preventing MTB infection [18]. It is certain that humoral immunity plays a significant role in acquired immune responses. It involves the generation of antigen-specific antibodies against invading pathogens or vaccine antigens. In the case of TB, research indicates that B cells and humoral immunity can indeed modulate the immune response [67]. This suggests that B cells and the production of antibodies may have a role in the immune defense against TB infection. Activated B cells can regulate the inflammatory response by producing IL-10 and stimulate the Th1 response by producing IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α [68]. Furthermore, B cells can mediate cytotoxicity through the production of antibodies [69].\n\n3. The Clinical Pipeline of TB Vaccines\n\nAdvancements in the scientific understanding of the genetic system, proteomics, and immune mechanisms against MTB have accelerated the development of safer and more effective new TB vaccines [70]. The ideal vaccine strategy for TB should include three components: the prevention of primary infection and disease after exposure, the prevention of the reactivation of latent infection, and immunotherapeutic adjuvant to standard TB treatment for patient recovery [71]. The new TB vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials include inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, recombinant BCG vaccines, subunit vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and DNA vaccines [72,73,74]. Inactivated vaccines are primarily used for TB treatment; live attenuated vaccines are targeted for the initial immunization of newborns or the prevention of TB in adolescents and adults; subunit vaccines are mainly used for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against MTB; while viral vector vaccines aim to enhance the immune effect of BCG [75]. This review provides an overview of the development progress and obstacles facing 19 candidate TB vaccines currently in clinical pipelines ( ).\n\n3.1. Inactivated TB Vaccines\n\nInactivated vaccines use either the entire or fragmented, lysed forms of MTB to induce an immune response against a variety of MTB antigens. Inactivated vaccines have long been used for the prevention and treatment of TB. These vaccines induce both Th1 cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, defending against extracellular MTB infections, and have shown good immunotherapeutic effects in controlling TB [76,77]. The disadvantages of inactivated vaccines include short immunization time, short immunization period, and a requirement for multiple doses. However, inactivated vaccines have advantages in terms of stability, safety, and production, making them a rapidly developing vaccine type [23]. Currently, inactivated vaccines undergoing clinical trials include MIP, RUTI, Vaccae, and DAR-901 ( ).\n\nTable 1\n\nVaccineNCT\n\nNumberPhasePopulationSample SizeArms and InterventionsPrimary Outcome MeasuresResultsRef.M72/AS01E{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01755598\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01755598\"}}NCT01755598ILTBI individuals3575Experiment: 2 doses of M72/AS01E (10 µg), spaced one month apart, i.m. in the arm triangle area.\n\nPlacebo comparator: 2 doses of placebo with a 1-month interval, i.m. in the arm triangle area.Incident rates of definite PTB disease, not associated with HIV-infection, meeting the case definitionLTBI population vaccinated with M72/AS01E can prevent latent infections from developing into TB, the vaccine efficacy in the 36th month was 49.7%[78,79]{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00950612\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00950612\"}}NCT00950612IIAdolescents60Experiment: 2 doses of M72/AS01E (10 µg), with an interval of one month, i.m. in the arm triangle area.\n\nPlacebo comparator: 2 doses of placebo with a one-month interval, i.m. in the arm triangle area.Number of subjects with solicited local symptoms and solicited general symptoms, unsolicited AEs and SAEs, different levels biochemical and hematological levelsM72/AS01E induced strong T cell and antibody responses, including NK cells and IFN- γ generation[80]{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04556981\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04556981\"}}NCT04556981IIIHIV-positive patients402Experiment: 2 doses of M72AS01E (10 µg), i.m., at days 1 and 29.\n\nPlacebo comparator: control sodium chloride 0.9%, i.m., at days 1 and 29.Number of participants with solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, and SAEsNAGamTBvac{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03255278\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03255278\"}}NCT03255278IHealthy adults60Placebo comparator: s.c. 0.5 mL placebo.\n\nSafety and portable study group: s.c. 0.25 mL GamTBvac.\n\nExperimental 1: s.c. 0.25 mL GamTBvac.\n\nExperimental 2: s.c. 0.5 mL GamTBvac.\n\nExperimental 3: s.c. 1 mL GamTBvac.The number of AEsDifferent doses of vaccines were evaluated for immunogenicity, with half dose (0.5 mL) having the best effect[81]{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03878004\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03878004\"}}NCT03878004IIHealthy adults180Experiment: s.c. 2 doses of 0.5 mL GamTBvac, with an interval of 8 weeks.\n\nPlacebo comparator: s.c. 2 doses of 0.5 mL placebo, with an interval of 8 weeks.1.

MIP\n\nMycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) is a non-pathogenic, fast-growing strain of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) [106]. MIP was initially widely used as an immunomodulator for leprosy, and it was later found to prevent TB in mice [107] and guinea pigs [108]. Additionally, MIP has been shown to be safe in TB retreatment patients [96] and can contribute to protective immune response by activating NF-KB through TLR-4 signaling and inducing macrophages infected with MTB to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and NO [109]. A clinical trial conducted in Ghatampur, Kanpur (India), assessed the protective effect of MIP (Mycobacterium indicus pranii) in a rural population of approximately 28,948 individuals residing in 272 villages. The results revealed a substantial reduction in the incidence of PTB in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group. This reduction was observed 10–13 years after vaccination, and the statistical analysis showed a p-value of 0.002 and a chi-square value of 11.604 [110]. Additionally, it has been reported that TB patients who received DOTS along with MIP demonstrated a faster recovery in terms of sputum clearance compared to those who received only DOTS treatment [111,112]. This indicates that the inclusion of MIP in the treatment regimen enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of DOTS in TB patients. A phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00265226\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00265226\"}}NCT00265226) sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India and Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of MIP in category II TB patients in India [96]. It was observed that the sputum smear conversion rate in MIP treated patients and placebo-treated patients did not show any significant difference after two weeks with rates of 53.35% and 48.72%, respectively. However, after four weeks of treatment, the sputum culture conversion rate in the MIP group (67.1%) was significantly higher than that in the placebo group (57%), indicating that MIP has the ability to clear the bacteria [96]. Although local reactions were significantly higher in the MIP group than in the placebo group, they quickly self-resolved and disappeared. These results demonstrate that MIP has good safety and has the potential to clear MTB in TB patients.\n\n3.1.2. RUTI Vaccine\n\nThe RUTI vaccine is a therapeutic vaccine designed to combat TB infection. In a collaborative effort between Archivel Farma S.L. (Badalona, Spain) and Parexel (Glendale, CA, USA), a vaccine has been developed that incorporates purified and liposomal cellular fragments of MTB bacilli. These bacilli are cultured under stress conditions to simulate the environment within granulomas, thereby inducing the production of latency-specific antigens that are typically hidden from the immune system [113]. This vaccine can provide a strong and effective immune response against both replicating and non-replicating bacteria [114]. Experimental models involving mice, guinea pigs, goats, and mini-pigs have demonstrated RUTI’s efficacy in controlling LTBI after brief chemotherapy [98,115,116]. Based on these satisfactory outcomes, a randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00546273\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00546273\"}}NCT00546273) was conducted in healthy volunteers in 2007 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of four doses (5 µg, 25 µg, 100 µg, and 200 µg) of RUTI. The trial confirmed that RUTI vaccination at different doses caused only twitching symptoms at the injection site in volunteers, and two individuals (2/16) experienced sterile granulomatous inflammation, possibly related to a non-active compound used in the RUTI vaccine product [97]. Additionally, this clinical trial proved that the RUTI vaccine can elicit specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in volunteers [97]. As the first clinical trial evaluating RUTI vaccine, the results of this phase I trial provided a foundation for the subsequent clinical trials of the RUTI vaccine. In the year when the results of this phase I clinical trial were published (2010), a phase II clinical trial of the RUTI vaccine ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01136161\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01136161\"}}NCT01136161) was launched in three South African regions to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of three RUTI doses (5 µg, 25 µg, and 50 µg) in HIV-positive (n = 47) and negative (n = 48) LTBI individuals. In 2014, the outcomes of the phase II clinical trial were released, showcasing the findings regarding adverse reactions in individuals receiving the RUTI vaccine. The most frequently observed adverse reactions among the RUTI recipients were related to local injection site responses. These included erythema (91/92), sterile abscess (6/6), induration (94/92), swelling (74/83), local nodules (46/25), local pain (66/75), ulcer (20/11), nasopharyngitis (20/5), and headache (17/22) [98]. It is important to note that the majority of these reactions were mild in nature and well tolerated by the participants [98]. Furthermore, the results indicated that HIV-negative patients who received 5 µg or 25 µg RUTI showed good immune responses and a slight increase in immune response intensity after the second vaccination, while HIV-positive patients showed a similar polyantigenic profile of immune response after the first vaccination of 25 µg or 50 µg RUTI, and no significant increase in immune response was observed after the second vaccination [98]. These results suggest that the immune responses induced by the RUTI vaccine differ between HIV-negative and positive populations, possibly due to impaired CD4+ T lymphocytes in HIV-positive individuals.\n\nAlthough the results of the above two clinical trials have proven the acceptable tolerability and safety of the RUTI vaccine, as well as the induction of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, more large-scale clinical trials are needed to verify the efficacy of the vaccine. Currently, two phase IIb clinical trials ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04919239\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04919239\"}}NCT04919239 and {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT05455112\",\"term_id\":\"NCT05455112\"}}NCT05455112) are recruiting volunteers to evaluate the effectiveness of RUTI as an adjuvant for TB chemotherapy and the effectiveness and safety of RUTI immunotherapy in TB patients compared with standard treatments. Additionally, from the clinical trial data already published, there appears to be a correlation between the frequency of adverse events and the doses of the RUTI vaccine administered to volunteers. We believe that, in future RUTI clinical trials, one of the main considerations will be how to improve the vaccine to reduce adverse reactions in volunteers and determine an appropriate dose range for the vaccine.\n\n3.1.3. Mycobacterium Vaccae\n\nMycobacterium vaccae (M. vaccae) is a rapidly growing environmental mycobacterium with low pathogenicity to humans. It was first isolated from the mammary glands of cows by Boenickse R and Juhasz E [117]. M. vaccae contains many shared mycobacterial antigens with immunomodulatory properties. These shared mycobacterial antigens can help the host defend against MTB infection by inducing Th-1 type immune responses and thereby play a role in the treatment of TB [118,119,120,121].\n\nDespite this, early studies mostly focused on the adjuvant immunotherapy role of heat-killed M. vaccae in anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, but the results showed heterogeneity. In 1995, a clinical trial was conducted in the northern Nigerian city of Kano to evaluate the efficacy of M. vaccae immunotherapy in the treatment of PTB, showing that the sputum conversion rate of patients receiving M. vaccae immunotherapy was significantly higher than that of patients receiving placebo (chemotherapy alone) at 3 weeks of anti-tuberculosis drug treatment (73% vs. 19%, p = 0.00001) [122]. These findings suggest that M. vaccae immunotherapy has beneficial effects in the first two weeks after injection. Two years later, another clinical trial showed that M. vaccae immunotherapy significantly improved the treatment success rate of patients with refractory TB (77% vs. 52%, p < 0.02) [123]. These clinical trial results suggest that M. vaccae immunotherapy has certain adjuvant effects in the treatment of TB; however, some clinical trials reached the opposite conclusion. In 1999, a clinical trial published in The Lancet evaluated the role of M. vaccae in standard short-term anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy and found that M. vaccae immunotherapy did not significantly reduce the time to sputum conversion in TB patients, suggesting that M. vaccae immunotherapy did not provide any benefit in standard anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy [124]. Similarly, clinical trials have evaluated the effect of adding a single dose of SRL172 (killed M. vaccae) immunotherapy to standard anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy on the mortality rate of HIV-infected TB patients (n = 760), and the results showed that a single dose of SRL172 therapy was safe and well tolerated, but it did not significantly impact the survival or microbiological outcomes of adult PTB patients with HIV infection as an adjuvant immunotherapy for standard anti-tuberculosis treatment [125]. To address the heterogeneity issue of the aforementioned clinical trial results, Chen-Yi Huang et al. conducted a meta-analysis in 2017, which included data from 13 clinical trials [126]. The results of this study demonstrated that TB patients who received M. vaccae immunotherapy exhibited notably higher rates of negative sputum smear at 1–2 months and 6 months compared to the placebo group [126]. Additionally, a negative result of sputum culture was more likely to be observed in these ATB patients at 1 or 2 months [126]. These findings from the meta-analysis indicate that M. vaccae immunotherapy holds promise as an effective treatment for PTB.\n\nThe aforementioned clinical trials suggest that heat-killed M. vaccae preparations have the potential to be used as an adjunct to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, and recent clinical trials have also validated the ability of M. vaccae vaccine to prevent TB. Phase I and II clinical trials conducted in Finland and Zambia among HIV-infected adults previously vaccinated with BCG showed that whole inactivated M. vaccae had good safety and immunogenicity, and found that M. vaccae could prevent TB in HIV-positive populations [127,128]. In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial conducted in Tanzania, it was shown that M. vaccae, when used as a preventive vaccine, is both safe and well tolerated [129]. Furthermore, the vaccine was found to have a substantial protective effect against TB infection [129]. These findings highlight the potential of M. vaccae as a preventive measure against TB.\n\nExcitingly, the Chinese National Institutes for Food and Drug Control in Beijing, China, in collaboration with the Eighth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital in Beijing, have improved Mycobacterium vaccae and named it VaccaeTM. VaccaeTM, originally manufactured by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (now provided by Anhui Zhifei Biological Products Co., Ltd., Hefei, China), is known for its ability to enhance immunity, stimulate phagocytosis, regulate immune responses in both directions, and minimize pathological damage [23]. A phase III clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01979900\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01979900\"}}NCT01979900) was conducted in Guangxi, China, which included 10,000 patients aged 15–65 years with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) > 15 mm, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VaccaeTM in preventing TB in patients with LTBI, and its results have not been published yet. VaccaeTM has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) (approval number: S20010003) for the adjunctive treatment of TB [126]. Furthermore, VaccaeTM is the only vaccine recommended by the World Health Organization for immunotherapy of TB. The VaccaeTM vaccine also showed some issues, such as inducing local skin rash, induration, or fever in a very small number of people after vaccination [130].\n\n3.1.4. DAR-901\n\nDAR-901 is an inactivated whole-cell vaccine derived from M. vaccae and represents a novel and scalable manufacturing process for SRL172 [100]. DAR-901 has demonstrated efficacy as a BCG booster in preclinical studies, effectively preventing TB disease [131], thus presenting a promising candidate for further clinical development. The DAR-901 vaccine is known to induce a Th1 immune response and quicken and strengthen specific immunity against structural and growth-related antigens, thereby reducing MTB burden and relieving pulmonary pathological damage [132]. In a phase I clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02063555\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02063555\"}}NCT02063555) conducted in the United States, the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated at different doses (0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, and 1 mg) in adults who had previously been vaccinated with BCG, with or without HIV infection. The trial showed that the vaccine was well tolerated at all three dose levels, induced cell and humoral immune responses specific to MTB antigens, and had no serious adverse events [133]. In another phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02712424\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02712424\"}}NCT02712424) conducted in Tanzania, the vaccine’s efficacy in reducing the risk of TB infection was evaluated in adolescents previously vaccinated with BCG. The findings indicated that a three-dose series of 1 mg DAR-901 was deemed safe and well tolerated. However, it did not exhibit efficacy in preventing initial or persistent IGRA conversion [100]. Interestingly, DAR-901 recipients who converted had enhanced immune responses to ESAT-6 [100]. Therefore, the clinical trials of DAR-901 for TB prevention are necessary since preventing disease may require different immune responses than protection against infection.\n\n3.2. Attenuated TB Vaccines\n\nAttenuated TB vaccines with gene defects are prepared by removing some of the virulence genes in the MTB, which loses its pathogenicity, significantly expresses multiple antigens, activates different types of T cells, and enhances immunogenicity. It can be used as a preventive vaccination and a substitute for newborn BCG vaccination. Compared with other vaccines, its advantages are that it can activate complex and diverse immune responses, has a wider range of antigenic epitopes, induces immune responses similar to natural infection, and thus produces long-term protection. However, attenuated vaccines also have some drawbacks, such as potential risks of regaining virulence and complications of immune complex. MTBVAC and BCG (revaccination) are currently attenuated TB vaccines in clinical trials ( ).\n\n3.2.1. MTBVAC\n\nMTBVAC is a new TB live vaccine based on a phoP-fadD26 gene-deficient attenuated strain of MTB. PhoP and fadD26 genes were knocked out of MTB to deactivate the expression of various virulence factors including ESAT-6, and to play a role in MTB cell membrane synthesis, respectively [134]. The vaccine is mainly targeted at newborns as a replacement for BCG vaccination, and at adolescents and adults for boosting immunity. So far, MTBVAC is the first attenuated TB live vaccine to enter clinical trials and has shown safety comparable to that of BCG. In 2013, a phase I double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation trial was conducted in HIV-negative volunteers in Switzerland to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MTBVAC compared with BCG ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02013245\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02013245\"}}NCT02013245). The results showed that the safety of MTBVAC in three dose groups (the first group received 5 × 103 CFUs MTBVAC, the second group received 5 × 104 CFUs MTBVAC, and the third group received 5 × 105 CFUs MTBVAC) was comparable to that of BCG vaccine, and no serious adverse events were triggered after vaccination [94]. In addition, to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MTBVAC in adults and newborns in TB-endemic areas, a phase Ib randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation clinical trial was conducted in a high-TB-burden region in South Africa ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02729571\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02729571\"}}NCT02729571). The results showed that the frequency, severity, and types of adverse events in the two groups were similar, and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events [95,135]. In addition, the trial observed that Th1-type CD4 cells had a dose-dependent response to MTBVAC, and the peak response of MTBVAC (i.e., on day 70) was higher than that of BCG vaccine in the 2.5 × 105 CFUs dose group, and the response of MTBVAC was higher than that of BCG on day 360 [95]. The response of Th1-type CD4 cells to MTBVAC in the low-dose group (2.5 × 103 CFUs) was significantly lower than that of BCG or high-dose MTBVAC on day 70 and day 360 [95]. The above immunogenicity results show that high-dose MTBVAC induces a strong immune response, and in future studies, it may be possible to consider omitting the low-dose group of MTBVAC.\n\nCurrently, there are two ongoing clinical trials in South Africa, namely {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02933281\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02933281\"}}NCT02933281 and {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03536117\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03536117\"}}NCT03536117, investigating the different aspects of MTBVAC. {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02933281\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02933281\"}}NCT02933281 is focused on evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of four doses (5 × 103, 5 × 104, 5 × 105, and 5 × 106 CFUs) vaccination of MTBVAC in adults with or without LTBI. On the other hand, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03536117\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03536117\"}}NCT03536117 aims to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the three-dose (2.5 × 104, 2.5 × 105, and 2.5 × 106 CFUs) vaccination of MTBVAC in newborns. However, the results of these trials have not yet been disclosed. Furthermore, a randomized, double-blind, controlled phase III clinical trial of MTBVAC ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04975178\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04975178\"}}NCT04975178) is being conducted in TB-endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa to evaluate its efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in newborns with and without HIV exposure, and is currently recruiting participants.\n\n3.2.2. BCG Revaccination (Gates MRI-TBV01-201)\n\nAs previously mentioned, BCG vaccination provides benefits for infants but not for other populations. In recent years, the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute (Gates MRI), Aeras, and Sanofi Pasteur conducted clinical trials for the repurposing of the existing BCG vaccine in adolescents and children. In Cape Town, South Africa, a randomized, placebo-controlled, partially blinded phase Ib clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02378207\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02378207\"}}NCT02378207) was conducted in 2015 to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of BCG revaccination in healthy, HIV- and MTB-uninfected, previously BCG-vaccinated adolescent participants. Published in EClinicalMedicine in 2020, this clinical trial showed that BCG revaccination had acceptable safety and induced robust, multifunctional BCG-specific CD4+ T cells [84]. Furthermore, a randomized, placebo-controlled, partially blinded phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02075203\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02075203\"}}NCT02075203) was conducted in healthy adolescents in Cape Town, South Africa to assess the efficacy of BCG revaccination in preventing MTB infection. The results indicated that BCG revaccination was immunogenic and reduced the rate of sustained QFT conversion, with an efficacy of 45.4% (p = 0.03) [88]. However, the study also found that although BCG revaccination did not induce serious adverse events, mild-to-moderate injection-site reactions were more common with BCG revaccination than with the H4:IC31 vaccine.\n\nTherefore, the safety of BCG revaccination has become a topic of increasing interest. In 2022, an article published in the journal npj Vaccines investigated the incidence and risk factors for the development of BCG injection-site abscesses and local lymphadenopathy. Results showed that 3% of 1387 BCG-vaccinated participants developed injection-site abscesses, with the majority (34/41, 83%) resolving without treatment [136]. Furthermore, the incidence of injection-site abscesses was higher in participants who received BCG revaccination (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7–7.5) [136]. Additionally, local lymph node lesions were observed in 48 out of 1387 (3%) participants who received the BCG vaccine. Interestingly, a higher incidence of these lesions was found among individuals who underwent BCG revaccination (odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–3.9) [136]. It is worth noting that the frequency and types of adverse events associated with initial BCG vaccination and revaccination vary across different geographical regions. To address this variability and shed light on the safety of BCG revaccination, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted. This review encompassed a total of 22 studies, including randomized trials (n = 8), case series or reports (n = 6), case–control studies (n = 4), and observational studies (n = 4) [137]. The findings suggest a slight increase in the incidence of mild local and systemic reactions following BCG revaccination; however, there were no serious adverse events among immunocompetent individuals who received the vaccine [137].\n\nBased on the data obtained from the aforementioned clinical trials and studies, in 2019, Gates MRI conducted a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04152161\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04152161\"}}NCT04152161) to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of BCG revaccination in healthy children and adolescents to prevent sustained MTB infection in South Africa. The clinical trial aims to recruit 1820 pediatric and adolescent volunteers between the ages of 10 and 18 years. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to two groups and will receive a single 0.1 mL injection of BCG SSI or normal saline, both administered intradermally in the deltoid region of the upper arm. The results of this clinical trial have not yet been published.\n\n3.3. Recombinant BCG Vaccines\n\nThere is a large difference in the protective efficacy of BCG for adults, but the protective efficacy of other new vaccines still cannot surpass the existing BCG. Therefore, reasonable recombination and modification of existing BCG is one of the research directions for TB vaccines. So far, the study of BCG modification has benefited more and more from the research methods and results of modern molecular biology, that is, by inserting exogenous target genes into existing bacteria or viruses to use them as carriers to construct recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccines [138]. Several types of rBCG have been developed, and their protective effects and humoral and cellular immune responses have been evaluated in animal models and humans. Currently, three types of rBCG have entered clinical trials (VPM1002, rBCG30, and AERAS-422), among which rBCG30 and AERAS-422 have been discontinued due to poor efficacy and safety issues ( ).\n\nVPM1002 is a rBCG vaccine created by substituting the urease C gene with the listeriolysin O (LLO) encoding gene from Listeria monocytogenes [139]. This substitution results in the secretion of LLO, which promotes the entry of antigens and DNA into the cytoplasm of the host cells. As a result, VPM1002 has been shown to significantly enhance the production of antigen-specific CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells. Additionally, it has been found to induce autophagy, activate inflammasomes, and promote cell apoptosis [140,141]. It has been demonstrated that VPM1002 can effectively induce Th1 and Th17 type immune responses [142]. Moreover, when tested on mice, immunodeficient mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates, VPM1002 has shown to be more efficient and safer compared to BCG [142]. Additionally, the vaccine has been used for immunotherapy to treat non-muscle invasive bladder cancer as a replacement for BCG [143].\n\nA randomized, control, dose-escalating phase I clinical trial was carried out in Germany to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VPM1002 in male human volunteers ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00749034\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00749034\"}}NCT00749034). The results revealed that VPM1002 induces specific and dose-dependent immune responses and is safe and well tolerated at the highest dose (5 × 105 CFUs) [91]. A subsequent phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01479972\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01479972\"}}NCT01479972) was conducted in high-burden settings in South Africa to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VPM1002 and BCG in newborns unexposed to HIV and unvaccinated with BCG. The results indicated that VPM1002 is safe, immunogenic, and immunologically tolerated in newborns after a single dose [92]. The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses induced by VPM1002 are comparable to those induced by BCG [92]. To further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VPM1002 in comparison to BCG in HIV-exposed and unexposed newborns, a double-blind, randomized, controlled phase IIb clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02391415\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02391415\"}}NCT02391415) was conducted on 416 newborns in four healthcare centers in South Africa. The results showed that VPM1002 is safe in both HIV-exposed and unexposed newborns [93]. Although both vaccines have immunogenic properties, VPM1002 generates lower immune responses than BCG.\n\nOne limitation of the clinical trials mentioned above is the small sample size, rendering the statistical comparisons of the immune response elicited by both vaccines difficult to establish. In two recent phase III clinical trials ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03152903\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03152903\"}}NCT03152903 and {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04351685\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04351685\"}}NCT04351685), which have yet to recruit volunteers, the sample sizes have been increased to 2000 and 6940 participants, respectively. These clinical trials aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of VPM1002 in preventing TB recurrence in individuals who have been successfully treated for TB and in preventing TB infection in newborns.\n\n3.4. Subunit TB Vaccines\n\nSubunit TB vaccines consist of immunologically active components isolated and purified from MTB, such as proteins, peptides, amino acids, and sugars. These vaccines offer advantages such as efficiency, safety, and lower cost. However, their limited antigen quantity results in weaker ability to activate broad immunity, shorter immunogenicity duration, and lower memory immune ability. Therefore, subunit vaccines require adjuvants to induce immunoprotection or immunotherapy, enhance their immunogenicity, and ensure targeted delivery. They are often utilized as booster vaccines after initial BCG vaccination to augment BCG-mediated protection or extend the duration of protection. The clinical trials for the six subunit vaccines for TB, including M72/AS01E, GamTBvac, H56: IC31 (AERAS-456), H4: IC31 (AERAS-404), ID93+GLA-SE, and AEC/BC02, are currently underway to evaluate their abilities against MTB infection or TB disease ( ).\n\n3.4.1. M72/AS01E\n\nM72/AS01E is a subunit candidate TB vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in the UK, consisting of highly immunogenic MTB proteins Mtb39A and Mtb32A, and the adjuvant AS01E. The M72/AS01E subunit vaccine has shown efficacy in inducing an immune response characterized by the activation of γ-interferon producing CD4+ T cells and antibody production; however, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear [80]. To better understand the immune protective mechanisms of the M72/AS01E vaccine, further basic research must be conducted.\n\nThis vaccine is designed to protect against TB disease, and its success in activating both T cells and antibody production make it a promising candidate for future TB prevention efforts. To evaluate its safety, immunogenicity, and efficiency of protection, some clinical trials have been conducted. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01755598\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01755598\"}}NCT01755598) was conducted in Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia, consisting of 3575 adults aged 18–50 living in countries with high TB prevalence. The trial aimed to evaluate the protective effect of two doses of M72/AS01E compared to placebo against PTB. The results revealed that the vaccine was safe and effective, with minor vaccine-related adverse reactions and 54% protection efficacy against MTB infection in adults [78]. A three-year follow-up indicated that M72/AS01E vaccination provided at least three years of immune protection to prevent latent infections from developing into active TB cases. However, the final protection efficacy was found to be 49.7% after 36 months of follow-up ( ) [79]. In addition, a double-blind, randomized, controlled phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00950612\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00950612\"}}NCT00950612) was conducted in TB endemic areas to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of M72/AS01E in healthy HIV-negative adolescents. Findings demonstrate that M72/AS01E vaccination exhibited acceptable clinical safety and reactogenicity profiles. Furthermore, this vaccination approach elicited robust and durable CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, along with CD4+ T cell-dependent interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) responses in NK cells [80]. These effects were observed in both MTB-infected individuals and uninfected healthy adolescents residing in TB endemic regions [80]. These trials demonstrate that M72/AS01E has good safety and immunogenicity in adolescents and adults.\n\nCurrently, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04556981\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04556981\"}}NCT04556981) is being conducted in South Africa to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of M72/AS01E in HIV-positive participants undergoing virus suppression and antiretroviral therapy.\n\n3.4.2. GamTBvac\n\nGamTBvac is a recombinant subunit vaccine candidate for TB, composed of dextran-binding domain-modified Ag85a and ESAT6-CFP10 antigens from MTB, along with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant with dextran [144]. Ag85a is a protein component of the MTB secreted acyltransferase 85 complex, and ESAT6-CFP10 is a fusion of two MTB proteins. Both antigens are fused with a dextran-binding domain (DBD) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides to enable them to bind to dextran. The DBD fusion improves the antigen’s stability and immunogenicity by facilitating their uptake and presentation by APCs [145]. The CpG oligodeoxynucleotides are immunostimulatory agents that activate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling, a critical component of the innate immune response [146]. These oligonucleotides are immobilized on a DEAE–dextran core, consisting of a modified version of the 500 kDa DEAE-dextran with attached diethylaminoethyl polycation to enhance antigen delivery and promote TLR9 signaling. The addition of these adjuvants enhances the immune response to the antigens, leading to increased vaccine efficacy.\n\nThe immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the GamTBvac vaccine was evaluated in murine and guinea pig TB models using the GamTBvac-prime/boost and BCG-prime/GamTBvac-boost protocols. The results showed that the GamTBvac vaccine exhibited strong immunogenicity and demonstrated excellent protection against aerosol and intravenous challenges with the MTB H37Rv strain in both models [144]. A phase I clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03255278\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03255278\"}}NCT03255278) was carried out in 2017 to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the GamTBvac vaccine. This study, which included healthy volunteers who had been previously vaccinated with BCG, involved a comparative placebo-controlled design with five arms, comprising two safety evaluation arms (safety and portable study group; placebo safety study group) and three immunogenicity evaluation arms with increasing doses (0.25 dose group, 0.5 dose group, and 1 dose group). Two years later, the results demonstrated that the vaccine candidate had an acceptable safety profile, and the 0.5 dose vaccine group (containing 12.5 μg of DBD-Ag85a, 12.5 μg of DBD-ESAT6-CFP10, 75 μg of CpG (ODN 2216), 250 μg of DEAE-dextran 500 kDa, and 5 mg of dextran 500 kDa) exhibited the highest immunogenicity, as evidenced by a significant increase in the IFN-γ in vivo IGRA response and IgG ELISA analysis [81]. Following this, a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03878004\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03878004\"}}NCT03878004) was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GamTBvac in 180 MTB-uninfected, BCG-vaccinated healthy volunteers. Results confirmed the acceptable safety profile demonstrated in the phase I trial and showed that the vaccine induced high levels of antigen-specific IFN-γ, Th1 cytokines, and IgG antibodies [82].\n\nBuilding upon the promising outcomes from the phase I and II clinical trials mentioned earlier, a phase III clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04975737\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04975737\"}}NCT04975737) was carried out in 2021. This multicenter trial adopted a double-blind, randomized design with a 1:1 ratio of vaccination to the placebo. The purpose of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of the GamTBvac vaccine in preventing PTB in individuals aged 18–45 years, who were not infected with HIV. The results of this clinical trial, which is currently recruiting volunteers, will determine whether the vaccine has the potential to be used for TB prevention.\n\n3.4.3. H56:IC31\n\nH56:IC31 is a subunit vaccine composed of three MTB antigens (Ag85B, ESAT-6, and Rv2660c) and the IC31 adjuvant produced by Valneva Austria GmBH [83]. Studies have shown that exposure to H56:IC31 after infection with LTBI or ATB in mice or NHP models can prevent the reactivation of MTB and significantly reduce bacterial loads compared to control groups receiving adjuvants or BCG [147].\n\nThe safety and immunogenicity of H56:IC31 have been evaluated in four clinical trials ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01967134\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01967134\"}}NCT01967134, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02378207\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02378207\"}}NCT02378207, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02503839\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02503839\"}}NCT02503839, and {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01865487\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01865487\"}}NCT01865487). The initial phase I clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01967134\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01967134\"}}NCT01967134), conducted in South Africa, aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the H56:IC31 vaccine in HIV-negative adults, both with and without LTBI. The findings of this trial indicated that the vaccine was safe for administration [83]. Additionally, it successfully stimulated the production of antigen-specific IgG antibodies as well as triggered the development of CD4+ T cells expressing Th1 cytokines [83]. These immune responses were observed to persist for up to 210 days after vaccination. A phase Ib randomized placebo-controlled trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02378207\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02378207\"}}NCT02378207) was conducted in South Africa to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of H56:IC31 in healthy, BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative adolescents. The overall safety and tolerability of the vaccine were good, and no serious vaccine-related adverse events occurred. H56:IC31 induced a good CD4+ T cell response and serum IgG [84]. Another phase I/IIa clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01865487\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01865487\"}}NCT01865487) conducted in South Africa evaluated the optimal dose and the vaccine’s effect on MTB-infected and uninfected adults. The results showed acceptable immunogenicity regardless of the dose (5, 15, 50 μg H56/500 nmol IC31), the number of administrations, or MTB infection. Two or three injections of H56:IC31 at the lowest dose (5 μg H56/500 nmol IC31) induced a long-lasting antigen-specific CD4+ T cell response in MTB-infected and uninfected adults [85]. In another randomized, open-label phase I/II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02503839\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02503839\"}}NCT02503839), the safety and immunogenicity of H56:IC31 in pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB patients, as well as the joint application of H56:IC31 and the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (etoricoxib), were mainly evaluated. The results showed that H56:IC31 induced a strong expansion of antigen-specific T cells and a higher proportion of serum conversion [86]. It was noteworthy that the joint application of etoricoxib not only failed to enhance the immune response, but also reduced the T cell response induced by H56:IC31. These data suggest that the administration of H56:IC31 is feasible and well tolerated in vaccinated individuals, demonstrating a promising safety profile for further clinical development. These clinical trials also suggested that the H56:IC31 vaccine demonstrated excellent immunogenicity in populations with different levels of LTBI infection.\n\nCurrently, a phase IIb double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03512249\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03512249\"}}NCT03512249) is being conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of H56:IC31 in reducing TB recurrence in HIV-negative adults. The trial plans to enroll 900 participants, but volunteers have not yet been recruited.\n\n3.4.4. H4:IC31 (AERAS-404)\n\nThe H4:IC31 vaccine, also known as AERAS-404, is formulated with a recombinant fusion protein Ag85B-TB10.4 (H4) and the IC31 adjuvant. This vaccine was developed collaboratively by SSI, Sanofi Pasteur, Valneva, and Aeras [87]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that H4:IC31 can provide protection against PTB in animals [148]. Moreover, in human studies, this vaccine has been shown to stimulate antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, leading to the secretion of important cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 [149]. Several phase I clinical trials evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of H4:IC31 have been conducted in TB-negative, HIV-negative, BCG-unvaccinated adults in Switzerland ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02420444\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02420444\"}}NCT02420444), in TB-negative, HIV-negative, BCG-vaccinated adults in South Africa ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02109874\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02109874\"}}NCT02109874), in HIV-negative, BCG-vaccinated adults in Sweden ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02066428\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02066428\"}}NCT02066428) and Finland ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02074956\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02074956\"}}NCT02074956), and in HIV-uninfected, HIV-unexposed, BCG-primed infants in South Africa ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01861730\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01861730\"}}NCT01861730). These clinical trials have produced similar results, demonstrating that H4:IC31 is safe in humans and induces IFN-γ production and multifunctional CD4+ Th1 responses [87,150,151]. In 2020, a phase 1b randomized clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02378207\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02378207\"}}NCT02378207) was conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. The objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and immunological responses of three different vaccine regimens: H4:IC31, H56:IC31, and BCG revaccination. This study involved 481 adolescents that were not infected with MTB. As a result, the results indicated that both H4:IC31 and H56:IC31 vaccines induced Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cell-mediated cellular immune responses and H4 and H56 antigen-specific IgG antibodies, but no antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses were detected [84]. Furthermore, in 2014, a randomized, placebo controlled, partially blinded phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02075203\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02075203\"}}NCT02075203) was conducted to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and prevention of infection with MTB of H4:IC31 and BCG revaccination in HIV-uninfected, QFT-GIT-negative, previously BCG vaccinated adolescents in the Western Cape region of South Africa. The results showed no clinically significant difference in the incidence of severe adverse events between the H4:IC31 vaccine and the BCG vaccine group [88]. Both the H4:IC31 vaccine and BCG were found to be immunogenic. However, the conversion rate of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube assay (QFT) was lower in H4:IC31 vaccine recipients (30.5%) than that in BCG vaccine recipients (45.4%) [88].\n\n3.4.5. ID93+GLA-SE (QTP101)\n\nThe ID93+GLA-SE vaccine, developed by the US Center for Infectious Disease Research, consists of three MTB virulence-related antigens (Rv2608, Rv3619, Rv3620), one latency-related antigen (Rv1813), and the adjuvant GLA-SE [152]. ID93+GLA-SE can stimulate CD4+ T cells to secrete high levels of Th1 cytokines, resulting in protective anti-tuberculosis effects in BCG-immunized and non-immunized mice and guinea pigs [153,154]. A phase I randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01599897\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01599897\"}}NCT01599897) was conducted in the US to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of ID93 antigen, alone or in combination with two doses of GLA-SE adjuvant, in healthy adults. The results showed that all doses of ID93 alone and ID93+GLA-SE had acceptable safety, and that ID93 in combination with adjuvant GLA-SE induced strong antibody and CD4+ T cell immunogenic responses [89]. A subsequent phase I randomized, controlled, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01927159\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01927159\"}}NCT01927159) was conducted in South Africa to evaluate its safety and immunogenicity in HIV-negative, BCG-vaccinated healthy adults. The results showed good safety at all antigen and adjuvant dose levels. Moreover, vaccination with the ID93+GLA-SE vaccine induced high and sustained antigen-specific CD4+ T cell and IgG responses [155]. In addition, a phase IIa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02465216\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02465216\"}}NCT02465216), completed in Cape Town, South Africa, aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ID93+GLA-SE in HIV-uninfected adult TB patients after the completion of treatment. The results showed that ID93+GLA-SE induced strong and durable antibody responses and antigen-specific, multifunctional CD4+T cell responses, with significantly higher levels of antigen-specific IgG and CD4+ T cell responses induced by two injections of 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE doses than in the placebo group, and the responses lasted for 6 months. No vaccine-related severe adverse events were observed [90]. A phase IIa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03806686\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03806686\"}}NCT03806686) is currently underway in Korea to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of ID93+GLA-SE vaccine in healthy healthcare workers vaccinated with BCG vaccine. The study has not yet recruited volunteers.\n\nThese clinical trials evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of ID93+GLA-SE in different populations, and all demonstrated good safety and immunogenicity, providing strong evidence for further clinical trials. However, the limitation of small sample sizes in these trials means that statistical differences cannot be accurately estimated.\n\n3.4.6. AEC/BC02\n\nAEC/BC02 is a recombinant subunit TB vaccine that contains two main components: MTB Ag85b and a fusion protein called ESAT6-CFP10. It is combined with a CpG and aluminum-based adjuvant system known as BC02. The vaccine was developed by the China National Institutes of Food and Drug Control in Beijing, China, and manufactured by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Hefei, China). The initial evaluation of the immunogenicity and efficacy of the AEC/BC02 vaccine in a BALB/c mouse model showed that AEC/BC02 could induce a strong cellular immune response, with a high frequency of antigen-specific interferon-γ-secreting T cells in mice [156]. In addition, in a guinea pig prevention model, AEC/BC02 did not prevent infection with MTB, but the risk of inducing the Koch phenomenon was low [156,157]. However, in a guinea pig latent infection model, AEC/BC02 effectively controlled the reactivation of tuberculosis bacteria and reduced the bacterial load in the lungs and spleen [156]. These results suggest that AEC/BC02 may prevent the reactivation of latent infection and may serve as a therapeutic vaccine. Subsequently, a study validated the therapeutic effect of the AEC/BC02 vaccine on latent infection with MTB in mice and found that AEC/BC02 vaccine immunotherapy significantly reduced the bacterial loads in the lungs and spleen of mice, which may be related to the antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 cellular immune responses induced by AEC/BC02 [158].\n\nThese preclinical studies suggest that the AEC/BC02 vaccine has great potential in preventing and treating LTBI. As a result, a phase I clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03026972\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03026972\"}}NCT03026972) was conducted in 2017 to evaluate the safety of the AEC/BC02 vaccine, sponsored by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. This study aimed to enroll four groups of participants: the first group comprises 25 TB-PPD-negative and IGRA-negative volunteers who will receive interventions with placebo, low dose adjuvant, or low dose vaccine; the second and third groups will include 30 subjects each with TB-PPD-negative and IGRA-negative, who will receive interventions with placebo, high dose adjuvant, or high dose vaccine; and the fourth group, consisting of 50 subjects with TB-PPD-positive and IGRA-positive, will receive interventions with placebo, low-dose adjuvant, high-dose adjuvant, low-dose vaccine, or high-dose vaccine. In addition, a phase Ib, single-center, single-dose, placebo-controlled clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04239313\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04239313\"}}NCT04239313) evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of the AEC/BC02 vaccine in healthy adults was conducted in Hubei, China, in January 2020. Unlike {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03026972\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03026972\"}}NCT03026972, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04239313\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04239313\"}}NCT04239313 recruited participants who were TB-PPD-negative and IGRA-negative and primarily evaluated the safety of low-dose vaccine and low-dose adjuvant. Both clinical trials have completed participant recruitment, but the results have not yet been released. In March 2022, a phase II double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT05284812\",\"term_id\":\"NCT05284812\"}}NCT05284812) was initiated in Hunan, China, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the AEC/BC02 vaccine in LTBI individuals aged 18 and above. This study plans to enroll 200 subjects, and the primary outcome measure is the number of adverse events after intramuscular injection, while the secondary outcome measures are changes in the levels of antigen-specific total IgG antibodies and antigen-specific IFN-γ levels. The trial is currently recruiting volunteers.\n\n3.5. Viral Vector-Based TB Vaccines\n\nThe viral vector-based TB vaccine is a type of vaccine that transfers protective antigens of MTB into a relatively safe viral vector for efficient and sustained immune protection. The viral vector-based TB vaccine has advantages such as high safety, easy manufacturing, and low cost, and can carry larger gene fragments. However, there are also drawbacks such as the recovery of virulence and unstable expression of exogenous genes. Common viral vectors used for developing TB vaccines include modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), influenza virus, Hemagglutinating virus, adenovirus Ad5 and Ad35, Sendai virus, and simian adenovirus. Viral vector-based vaccines currently in clinical trials for TB include MVA85A, ChAdOx1.85A, TB/FLU-01L, TB/FLU-04L, and AdHu5Ag85A ( ).\n\n3.5.1. MVA85A\n\nMVA85A vaccine is an active viral vector vaccine developed by Aeras and the University of Oxford, using the vaccinia virus Ankara strain as the carrier to express MTB antigen 85A and induce T cell immune responses [101]. Preclinical studies have shown that MVA85A can stimulate cellular and humoral immune responses in animal models and confer immunoprotection against TB in mice, guinea pigs, cows, and rhesus macaques [159,160,161]. In 2007, a phase I clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00460590\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00460590\"}}NCT00460590) was conducted in Cape Town, South Africa, to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A in healthy volunteers without TB infection. The results showed that the vaccine was well tolerated and induced sustained, robust, and antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses [101].\n\nClinical trials have also assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of MVA85A in children and infants. Children are a target population for TB booster vaccines, but they often have a high helminth burden. In 2014, a phase II clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00679159\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00679159\"}}NCT00679159) was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A in BCG-vaccinated healthy children and infants in South Africa. Seven years later, the results of this trial were published and suggested that the MVA85A vaccine was shown to be safe and generated robust, polyfunctional, durable CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in infants [162]. Unfortunately, this clinical trial did not reveal the safety and immunogenicity of the MVA85A vaccine in children. In 2009, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00953927\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00953927\"}}NCT00953927) evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A in 2797 newborns who had previously received the BCG vaccine and were not infected with HIV. The results were published in The Lancet in 2013 and showed that although infants who received MVA85A experienced a higher incidence of mild adverse events compared with the placebo group (89% vs. 45%), there were no significant differences in the occurrence of systemic and severe adverse events between the two groups [103]. Additionally, the vaccine showed an efficacy of 17.3% (95% CI, from −31.9% to 48.2%) against TB disease and −3.8% (95% CI, from −28.1% to 15.9%) against TB infection [103].\n\nThe lack of efficacy of MVA85A against infant TB disease or infection is inconsistent with previous animal studies and may be attributed to the incomplete establishment of the immune system in infants, resulting in the insufficient ability to mount an effective immune response to MVA85A. Since newborns infected with HIV are prohibited from receiving a BCG vaccine, a new TB vaccine is needed to prevent TB in HIV-infected newborns and avoid potential risks associated with BCG vaccination. In 2018, a phase II double-blind, randomized, controlled trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01650389\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01650389\"}}NCT01650389) conducted in South Africa evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A vaccine in HIV-exposed newborns. The results showed that the vaccine was safe and induced early moderate antigen-specific immune responses [102]. However, the trial did not evaluate the protective efficacy of the MVA85A vaccine against TB in HIV-exposed newborns, and thus cannot be compared with the results of the {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00953927\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00953927\"}}NCT00953927 clinical trial. These promising results support the possibility of evaluating the efficacy of MVA85A in preventing TB in infants.\n\n3.5.2. ChAdOx1.85A\n\nChAdOx1.85A is a simian-adenovirus vector-based TB vaccine expressing the MTB antigen Ag85A. In a preclinical study, researchers evaluated the immunogenicity and protective effects of ChAdOx1.85A using a mouse model [163]. The nasal administration of ChAdOx1.85A induced significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion from CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in mice. However, compared to the negative control, ChAdOx1.85A immunization alone did not significantly reduce the MTB loads in mouse organs [163]. Immunization with BCG prior to ChAdOx1.85A and AMVA85A enhanced immune protection [163]. Similar results were validated in another animal experiment, where the CFU in the lungs of mice inoculated with ChAdOx1.85A alone did not decrease significantly compared to the unvaccinated group [164]. Mice vaccinated with BCG had decreased CFU in their lungs (p = 0.0059) and did not significantly benefit from the subsequent immunization of ChAdOx1.85A [164]. Furthermore, the BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A prime boost regime further improved the protective effect compared to the control group [164].\n\nData derived from the animal experiments indicate that the BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A prime-boost regimen provides greater protection compared to BCG or ChAdOx1.85A alone in mice. Based on these results, most clinical trials of the ChAdOx1.85A vaccine have used the BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A prime boost regime. Indeed, a phase I clinical trial with the identifier {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01829490\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01829490\"}}NCT01829490 was conducted in the UK to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1.85A vaccine, both with and without the MVA85A boost, in healthy adults. The results show that adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate, and the vaccine was safe [104]. MVA85A boost enhanced the Ag85A specific ELISpot and intracellular cytokine CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses induced by the ChAdOx1.85A vaccine [104]. In 2018, a phase IIa randomized open label trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03681860\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03681860\"}}NCT03681860) was conducted in Uganda to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different doses of ChAdOx1.85A vaccine (5 × 109 vp and 2.5 × 1010 vp) in different age groups (adults and adolescents) and to assess the advantage of the BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A prime boost regime in enhancing the protective efficacy. The safety and immunogenicity of this clinical trial were assessed by primary outcome measures of solicited adverse events and T cell response to Ag85A, respectively. Volunteer recruitment has been completed, but the results have not yet been published.\n\n3.5.3. TB/FLU-01L and TB/FLU-04L\n\nTB/FLU-01L is an attenuated influenza strain, Flu NS106, which expresses the MTB antigen ESAT-6. Meanwhile, TB/FLU-04L is a modified influenza vector with a truncated NS1 protein that expresses MTB antigens ESAT-6 and Ag85A [163,165]. These two vaccines were jointly developed by the Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems (RIBSP) in Kazakhstan and the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (SRII) in Russia.\n\nCurrently, multiple clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the TB/FLU-01L and TB/FLU-04L vaccines. In 2017, a randomized phase I clinical trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03017378\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03017378\"}}NCT03017378) was conducted in Kazakhstan to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose (day 1 and day 21) regimen of TB/FLU-01L TB vaccine in 36 BCG-vaccinated adults aged 18–50 years. However, the results of this study have not yet been reported.\n\nAnother study by Kira Stosman and colleagues evaluated the safety of the TB/FLU-04L vaccine in an animal model and found no lethal effects in the acute toxicity test [166]. No pathological changes in vital functions such as behavior, clinical signs, food and water intake, body temperature, and weight were observed, and no significant impact on metabolic and hematopoietic indicators was reported for vaccines with 6.5 log10 TCID50 and 7.5 log10 TCID50 [166]. These findings were further validated "
