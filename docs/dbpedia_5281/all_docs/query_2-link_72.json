        "text": "The Army will host an industry week on contested logistics next month at Ft. Gregg-Adams, VA, which will be followed by an announcement for a follow-on solicitation, according to a government notice posted this week.\n\nThe industry week will feature five panel sessions between industry and government subject matter experts. It will focus on five subject areas, which are:\n\nRenewable & distributed energy generation and storage\n\nAdvanced manufacturing\n\nDemand reduction -- water at the point of need\n\nAutonomous distribution -- human machine integration\n\nEnhanced explosive ordnance disposal training capability\n\nThe meeting, which will take place Sept. 19-20, will be unclassified with the goal of having “fair, even and transparent communications with industry, academia and other non-governmental organizations to inform industry on Army sustainment and logistics-related needs and to determine industry capabilities to meet said needs.”\n\nLast year, the Army stood up a Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team based out of Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL. The CFT was created to fill gaps in areas such as sustainment, autonomy, data-based logistics and fuel efficiency.\n\nAt the end of the industry event next month, Combined Arms Support Command intends to “set conditions” when it comes to delivering logistics and sustainment capabilities for the Army of 2030 and 2040, according to the notice.\n\nThe notice states that following the industry week, there will be a “follow-on announcement for solicitation” that centers around the five discussion topics of the event.\n\nThis Wednesday INSIDER Daily Digest has news on Defense Department legislative liaisons, the Maritime Administration's National Marketing Campaign, solid-rocket motors and more.\n\nSenate appropriators, in a report accompanying their version of the fiscal year 2025 defense spending bill, are retaining a provision from previous years prohibiting the use of funds to \"plan or implement the consolidation of a budget or appropriations liaison office\" anywhere within DOD:\n\nSenate appropriators nix DOD moves to consolidate congressional liaisons\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee says it is concerned the Defense Department might move to consolidate or \"supplant\" the budgetary liaisons who traditionally assist lawmakers in crafting annual spending legislation.\n\nThe Maritime Administration's National Marketing Campaign is meant to inform the public about the urgent need for skilled workers in the maritime industry:\n\nMARAD seeks PR help to boost National Marketing Campaign\n\nThe Maritime Administration is seeking public relations help to boost its National Marketing Campaign -- an initiative meant to bring more workers into the merchant marine and shipbuilding industries.\n\nSome solid-rocket motor news:\n\nLockheed, GD to join forces to build solid-rocket motors, boost output\n\nLockheed Martin and General Dynamics will come together to develop and produce solid-rocket motors in a bid to improve the nation's crippling domestic supply chain for the energetics systems that power most of the Pentagon's munitions, according to an announcement issued this week.\n\nNews on the Air Force's T-7 trainer aircraft:\n\nAir Force taking 'incremental' approach to T-7 milestone C decision\n\nThe Air Force is planning to approve low-rate initial production for its T-7 Red Hawk trainers on an incremental basis as it deals with long-term developmental delays, according to Kevin Stamey, the Air Force's program executive officer for mobility and training aircraft.\n\nWe also have the latest on the Defense Department's Replicator drone effort:\n\nDIU, Navy award contracts for small sea drones for Replicator\n\nThe Pentagon's innovation hub and the Navy have awarded contracts to prototype small sea drones, in line with the department's Replicator program timeline to field thousands of attritable, unmanned systems by August 2025 to counter China's military mass, the Defense Innovation Unit announced Monday.\n\nOshkosh will continue to build medium tactical trucks for the Army after receiving a $46 million contract, the Defense Department announced Tuesday.\n\nIssued as a modification to an earlier contract, the Wisconsin-based company will build the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles by an estimated completion date of Nov. 30, 2026, with funding and work locations being determined with each order, the Aug. 13 announcement reads.\n\nPerforming 55% of the Army’s haul and resupply missions, the FMTV includes cargo, recovery and tractor variants on a six-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive chassis, according to Army budget documents.\n\nThe Defense Department announced a $108.9 million contract to the company in May with a Sept. 30, 2026 completion date.\n\nIn January, the Army announced an order of 1,343 FMTV A2s, an upgraded variant with a more powerful engine, and increased armor that can carry heavier payloads when compared to the earlier A1 variant.\n\nEarlier variants of the FMTV can carry the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, which the Army is also testing on the A2 variant, according to service research and development documents.\n\nIn its 2023 report, the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation concluded the FMTV is effective and survivable but recommended the Army eliminate secondary hazards after finding that crew members experienced strain, discomfort and blunt-force injuries.\n\nThe Army intends to procure 208 trucks in fiscal year 2025 for $134 million and 695 trucks by FY-29 for an approximate $446 million, the budget documents add.\n\nIn July, the Senate Armed Services Committee included $134 million for the FMTV program in the FY-25 defense authorization bill.\n\nOshkosh also produces the Army’s Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles, which includes the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck and Palletized Load System as well as the M1070 tank transporter.\n\nThe company expects contract extensions for the vehicles following the loss of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle production contract, company executives said during a quarterly earnings call late last month.\n\n(Editor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that the State Department has approved the possible sales, not Congress.)\n\nThe State Department has approved a nearly $19 billion proposed foreign military sale of up to 50 F-15IA and F-15I+ aircraft to Israel, along with a host of other weapon systems, according to a recent Defense Security Cooperation Agency announcement.\n\n“Incorporating F-15IAs into the Israel Air Force’s fleet of fighter aircraft will enhance Israel’s interoperability with U.S. systems and bolster Israel’s aerial capabilities to meet current and future enemy threats, strengthen its homeland defense, and serve as a deterrent to regional threats,” DSCA said.\n\nBoeing would be the prime contractor. The proposed sale must still be approved by Congress.\n\nOther potential deals that Congress approved involving Israel today include an FMS for 32,739 120mm tank cartridges and related equipment for an estimated cost of $774 million, and another FMS for M1148A1P2 Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles costing about $583 million.\n\nAdditionally, DSCA announced a potential $102.5 million FMS to Israel for up to 30 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles and a $61 million FMS for up to 50,000 M933A1 120mm high explosive mortar cartridges.\n\nMeanwhile, Pentagon officials say they continue to monitor the Middle East for signs of a possible attack on Israel or U.S. forces by Iran or its proxies following the recent assassinations of top Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.\n\nThis Tuesday INSIDER Daily Digest has news on the Pentagon's Replicator drone effort, a Defense Science Board report on position, navigation and timing control and more.\n\nHere's the latest on the Defense Department's Replicator drone effort:\n\nDIU, Navy award contracts for small sea drones for Replicator\n\nThe Pentagon's innovation hub and the Navy have awarded contracts to prototype small sea drones, in line with the department's Replicator program timeline to field thousands of attritable, unmanned systems by August 2025 to counter China's military mass, the Defense Innovation Unit announced Monday.\n\nMore unmanned systems news, specifically on MQ-4C Triton cost increases:\n\nDrastic cost increase of MQ-4C reflects widespread problem, with unique causes\n\nThe MQ-4C Triton uncrewed aircraft system recently experienced significant unit cost increases, mirroring what some other Defense Department programs go through every year.\n\nThe recently released executive summary of a June 27 Defense Science Board report on Position, Navigation and Timing Control \"examined a variety of alternative navigation systems, space-based and otherwise, and considered warfighter needs and future opportunities for meeting them\":\n\nDSB recommends military use of commercial PNT systems\n\nA Defense Science Board task force is recommending the Pentagon try to leverage commercial markets to rapidly scale and lower the cost of position, navigation and timing systems for military use, according to an executive summary of the advisory panel’s latest report.\n\nDocument: Executive summary of DSB report on PNT control\n\nOffice of Strategic Capital Director Jason Rathje spoke at the National Defense Industrial Association’s emerging technology conference last week:\n\nStrategic capital chief expects loan funds available by year's end, awards in early 2025\n\nThe Defense Department office aimed at catalyzing private investment in technology areas deemed critical to national security expects to announce its first available funds by the end of this year, with its eye on awarding the money in early 2025, according to its director.\n\nOur colleagues at Inside Cybersecurity have the latest on the Pentagon's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program:\n\nSecond proposed rule for Pentagon's CMMC program clears OMB regulatory review process\n\nThe second rulemaking to implement version 2.0 of the Pentagon's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program has cleared the interagency regulatory review process at the Office of Management and Budget, setting up the potential for the closely watched initiative to be put into place by the end of the year.\n\nThis Monday INSIDER Daily Digest has news on MQ-4C Triton cost increases, the Air Force's multibillion-dollar, next-generation AWACS aircraft and more.\n\nPrompted by the Navy, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council -- the organization charged with assessing and evaluating joint military requirements -- decided in 2022 to reduce MQ-4C procurement numbers from 70 to 27 aircraft, due to increasing costs:\n\nDrastic cost increase of MQ-4C reflects widespread problem, with unique causes\n\nThe MQ-4C Triton uncrewed aircraft system recently experienced significant unit cost increases, mirroring what some other Defense Department programs go through every year.\n\nIn other unmanned systems news, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Heidi Shyu, who spoke at the National Defense Industrial Association's recent emerging technology conference, pointed to the increasingly widespread availability of commercial UAS products:\n\nShyu says counter-drone warfare 'never going to die'; Anduril touts new production facility\n\nThe global proliferation of unmanned aerial systems and the technologies to counter them has the Pentagon's technology chief predicting continued \"explosive growth.\"\n\nBoeing and the Air Force have put the finishing touches on a multibillion-dollar contract for the next-generation AWACS aircraft:\n\nAir Force, Boeing finalize E-7A Wedgetail contract for $2.6 billion\n\nThe Air Force and Boeing finalized the E-7A Wedgetail contract, inking the deal for $2.56 billion for the rapid prototype program, according to a service announcement.\n\nMissile Defense Agency Director Lt. Gen. Heath Collins said a prototype integrated air and missile defense architecture developed by his agency called the Joint Track Management Capability (JTMC) Bridge will be the starting point for tying together different air and missile systems originally developed by the military services as stand-alone capabilities:\n\n'Bridge' to link Army-Navy sensor tracks on Guam not ready to handle 'advanced' threats\n\nThe U.S. military is planning to roll out a Defense of Guam capability that effectively identifies from Army and Navy radar a single track for air-breathing threats but not yet adversary ballistic and hypersonic missiles, even as top brass assess that incoming raids in a conflict with China could be in the \"hundreds\" or \"thousands.\"\n\nThe services have received several systems under the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve program:\n\nDOD highlights successful prototype transitions to defend RDER funding\n\nThe Pentagon has released project details for several systems that have successfully transitioned to the military services via the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve program, which senior officials have been defending amid recent congressional criticism.\n\nThe Air Force's weapon systems and subsystems will now go through HII-run depots for some repair or maintenance work,according to an announcement the company issued today.\n\nThe shipbuilding giant’s mission technologies unit has been awarded a $209 million contract by the Air Force to “perform research and analysis that will support the USAF’s weapons systems development, sustainment and long-term strategy,” HII said in the notice.\n\nThe company will mainly support the service’s fighters and advanced aircraft and bomber directorates on maintenance work in an effort to swiftly increase aircraft readiness or mission-capable availability, at a time when the service expects up to514 aircraft to be grounded at any point due to lack of spare parts.\n\n“HII is excited to build upon our Air Force Life Cycle Management Center work, helping to optimize the customer’s approach to developing, fielding and maintaining fighter and bomber platforms and subsystems to maximize their readiness and lethality,” Grant Hagen, HII’s president of mission technologies’ cyber, electronic warfare and space business unit, said in a statement.\n\nWork supported by the new five-year task order will be performed out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH, where AFLCMC is housed, as well as at Robins AFB, GA, Hill AFB, UT and Tinker AFB, OK -- the locations of the service’sthree sprawling Air Logistics Complexes.\n\nThe Air Force in September will release a three-phased plan to overhaul its aging depots to be better equipped to meet the demands of a potential fight with a near-peer adversary, formally dubbed \"The Air Force Depot Infrastructure Optimization Plan,\"Inside Defense previously reported.\n\nThe Office of Naval Research is seeking information on technology that will assist in subsea and seabed warfare and plans to use this knowledge for technology operational experimentation event (TOEE) 25.2 -- part of a series of experiments that take place in operationally relevant conditions.\n\nThree focus areas for TOEE 25.2 include autonomous undersea navigation and collaborative autonomy, sensors and automated target recognition and command and control tools as well as decision aids for planning and mission coordination, according to a request for information posted today.\n\n“TOEEs is a series of events designed to provide decision-quality information to Naval Research & Development Establishment (ND&RE) leadership informing future Science and Technology (S&T) investments (further development, transition, or divestiture) through live force experimentation executed in operationally relevant scenarios and environments,” today’s notice reads. “Past events have focused on Expeditionary Sustainment, Maritime Reconnaissance and Counter-Reconnaissance, and Small Boat Payloads in support of Littoral Maneuver.”\n\nThe Navy is interested in technologies with a technology readiness level of five or greater and that can conduct live experimentation in fiscal year 2025.\n\nAfter an initial demonstration, successful technologies will be allowed to join in a limited objective experiment, currently scheduled for January to February 2025. If the technology is successful here, it may participate in an advanced capability experiment, which will tentatively take place in September 2025, according to today’s notice.\n\nAn industry day will also occur from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. CST on Aug. 28 virtually on Microsoft Teams.
