        "text": "BELDING, Mich. - It isn’t hard to spot Chris Kaman in a crowd.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of 7-footers wandering around, even at a basketball tournament. The Grand Rapids, Mich., native has some gray in his beard now and added a few pounds to his frame. But Kaman, who spent 13 years playing in the NBA, laced on his basketball shoes one more time to play in the Gus Macker 3-on-3 basketball tournament in the small Michigan town of Belding on Saturday.\n\nSince he retired from the NBA in 2016, Kaman has mostly disappeared from the public eye.\n\n“I don’t typically do a lot of interviews anymore,” Kaman said. “I told my wife and my family ‘once I’m done (playing basketball), I’m done. I get offers to do things sometimes, but I just want to stay out of the limelight, to be honest.”\n\nKaman created a buzz at the tournament once area fans realized he was playing. When he wasn’t on the court, he was being hounded for his autograph or to take a photo with him.\n\n“Excuse me, are you the NBA guy?” a young girl asked Kaman. “My older brother said you are good. Can I get a photo with you?”\n\nKaman bent down and took a selfie with the girl.\n\n“It comes with the territory,” he said. I could be a jerk about it, but that doesn’t make sense to me. I’m here, I’m available, and I want to make people as happy as I can. I try to be a genuinely kind person. That’s how I look at life.”\n\nKaman played for five teams in the NBA: The Los Angeles Clippers, New Orleans Hornets, Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers. He played with Damian Lillard, Dirk Nowitzki and even Kobe Bryant.\n\nBut he was wearing a black Trail Blazers shirt while he played on Saturday.\n\n“I just played for them last and I had a bunch of free stuff they gave me,” he said. “And this is comfortable.”\n\nKaman went to Wyoming Tri-Unity High School near Grand Rapids and then Central Michigan University. He was taken in the 2003 NBA Draft in the first round.\n\nAfter his career ended, Kaman got married, had kids and moved to rural Michigan and bought a farm.\n\n“We have a small farm,” he said. “We have some cows and chickens. I just want to live a slower, calmer lifestyle. I want to raise my kids the best I can and take the time to do that.”\n\nHe moved 40 minutes north of Grand Rapids to Belding, Mich.\n\n“I live near Belding,” he said. “I live right down the road (from the tournament). I was living in Greenville, where I have some businesses. This is where we’ve built our family and where we want to be. We sold our house in Greenville, where we lived for about 10 years. Our kids have a cool school they go to. A small Christian school.”\n\nKaman said he’s played in a few Gus Macker tournaments since he retired, but wanted to play in this one because his 8-year-old son wanted to play, too.\n\n“My son is playing for the first time,” he said. “He’s 8. I’m trying to enjoy my family time and spend some time with my friends as well. A buddy of mine roped me into playing in the Macker. I don’t normally do these either. I played in Gaylord this year and two years ago I played in Iron Mountain.”\n\nOne of his Gus Macker teammates played in the NBA as well. Robert Sacre, a 7-footer from Vancouver, played four years with the Los Angeles Lakers from 2012 to 2016. Sacre and Kaman were teammates on the 2013-14 Lakers team.\n\n“Sacre was on the Lakers when I was there and we got to be good friends,” Kaman said. “We maintained our friendship since. He’s a fellow hard-working man. He’s got an excavating business.”"
