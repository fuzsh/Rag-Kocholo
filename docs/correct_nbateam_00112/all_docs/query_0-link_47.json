        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers targeted center as an area of need this offseason and landed a veteran.\n\nChris Kaman agreed Thursday night to a two-year contract with the Blazers, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports. The deal is worth $9.8 million total but only $1 million is guaranteed in the second year. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because NBA contracts cannot be signed until July 10.\n\nThe 11-year veteran spent last season with the Los Angeles Lakers, marred by injuries and inconsistency while averaging 10.4 points, 5.9 rebounds and 18.9 minutes in 39 games. He was an All-Star in 2010 for the Los Angeles Clippers, but Portland will be his fifth team in the past five seasons.\n\nKaman has career averages of 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds per game but should be a solid veteran backup for Robin Lopez. Yahoo! Sports first reported that Kaman and the Blazers had an agreement."
