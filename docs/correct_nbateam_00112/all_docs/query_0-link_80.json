        "text": "Serena Winters: How does it feel to be in this building for media day, and back in LA?\n\nChris Kaman: First it was kind of interesting, and surreal, haven’t been here since Labor day, now its settled in, and I’m excited and ready to get practicing tonight.\n\nSW: Okay so there’s a question that Lakers fans want to know. They want to know if you will grow back the beard, or keep it shaved?\n\nCK: I don’t know about the beard, the hair is definitely not coming back cause it can’t, and the beard I have no idea yet I haven’t decided. It depends on how it goes, its all about my emotions and my mood.\n\nSW: There’s something that you have in common with Kobe, and that is that Mark Cuban seems to call you out. He called Kobe out about amnestying him, and then he called you out about putting the ball on the floor too much. What’s going on with that?\n\nCK: You know what I got to be honest, Mark (Cuban) is a good guy. I think he does stuff sometimes to get stories, and says stuff to the media which is the case in this situation, but I can’t say anything back about Mark he does a great job as an owner, and I actually really liked him.\n\nSW: You were with the other team in LA for quite some time the Clippers. Did you ever think you would be part of the team that has the same arena the Lakers.\n\nCK: Yeah, I used to say to say we used to share the arena with the Lakers, but the Lakers have to share the arena with the Clippers, so you know its been the same thing the last 10-12 years, and its a nice arena.\n\nSW: Can I ask you what your vibe or mood toward the Lakers was, and how you saw this team?\n\nCK: We always hated the Lakers. That’s what they wanted you to do. You’re playing for the other team in town, they never really got any recognition, still really don’t, and just the fan base is really different with the Lakers, that’s how it goes.\n\nSW: I know you have a busy day ahead of you, so what’s the one thing you’d like to say to Laker fans out there?\n\nCK: I’m excited to be here. I’m looking forward to the season, and go Lakers.\n\nSW: If you had to hunt one person in the NBA who would it be?\n\nCK: Oh wow. Like kill them?\n\nSW: Well…\n\nCK: I don’t generally hunt people. I don’t know that’s a good question.\n\nSW: What about a team, would you like to hunt a team?"
