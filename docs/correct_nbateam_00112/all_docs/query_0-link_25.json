        "text": "What was your immediate reaction when you heard about the trade? CK: I was shocked. I didn’t know if it was real or not. I called my agent and he didn’t answer and then Al-Farouq (Aminu) called his agent and he told us it was done. My agent called me an hour later and we talked about it and there really wasn’t much you could do about it. I was moving to New Orleans. I didn’t mind; it wasn’t a big deal, but it was definitely shocking. In light of how well the Clippers are doing now, in your heart of hearts do you wish you were still playing for them? CK: You know what? Yes and no. I’m in a new city and with a new team and I’m happy. I got to keep being professional and do my job the best I can here until someone says otherwise. But it’s still a little frustrating. I put my heart into the team in L.A. I definitely cared about being there. I enjoyed my time there. The people who worked in the organization, besides a few people who I won’t name, are really great people. It is what it is. It’s a business. I’m where I’m at for a reason. I feel like God has a plan for my life and I’m here for a reason.\n\nIs there a team you would like to play for next season or a conference that you‘d prefer being in? CK: Good question. Right now, I’m in limbo. I don’t know where I want to go. I’m here and I’m going to give my heart to where I’m at. I enjoy the city of New Orleans – it’s a great place – and I enjoy the Hornets fans. I don’t have any complaints right now. As surreal as it may seem, would you be open to playing for the Clippers again? CK: If they made some different decisions with some of the people in the upper management then, yeah, maybe. But the way it is there now, no.\n\nYou were drafted by the Clippers in 2003 as the sixth overall pick and spent eight seasons with them before being traded to the Hornets. Did you think at some point you were going to play your entire career with the Clippers? Chris Kaman: I had some thoughts about that, yeah. But last year when they hired Vinny (Del Negro) as coach, they started to change the team in a different direction. They started to go uptempo and wanted to run more and push the pace. They wanted real athletic guys and that’s not really my style for the most part. But when they had the opportunity to trade for Chris Paul, it was a great opportunity for them. So they thought the trade would work best for them. That was the decision they made. I don’t think they handled it in the most professional way, but it was definitely a good deal for them.\n\nThe NBA trading deadline is March 15. Do you expect to be traded? Chris Kaman: I don’t know. Honestly, I don’t know. I think it’s 50-50 right now. If you do get traded, do you think the team that acquires you will want a commitment that you will stay with them beyond this season? And are you willing to make that commitment? CK: At this point, I don’t even know. I just want to play basketball. If that’s here or somewhere else, that’s God’s plan and that’s what I’ll do. I’m just going to keep playing hard and try and help this team get as many wins as it can.\n\nWith the March 15 trade deadline looming, however, sources say the Hornets are again open to trading Kaman, 7 feet, 265 pounds, if they can find an attractive deal. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future or what’s going to happen in the next five days,’’ Kaman said. “I don’t know if there will be a trade or won’t be one. I just play and try not to worry about it, but it does stress me out a little bit. I go home at night and have some rough nights sleeping once in awhile thinking about it, but it’s out of my control. “I think I’ve shown for eight years what I’m capable of doing.’’"
