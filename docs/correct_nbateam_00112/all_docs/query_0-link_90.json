        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Chris Kaman had a busy off-season. He got married and honeymooned in Hawaii.\n\nBut the 2010-11 NBA training camps have begun and the former Central Michigan University star is one of the cornerstones of a Los Angeles Clippers' franchise that has struggled.\n\nKaman believes this is the year that changes, especially with the addition of prize prospect Blake Griffin, the No. 1 pick who was injured all of the 2009-10 season. Kaman will start at the five position, with Griffin manning the four.\n\nThe Clippers also have a new coach in Vinny Del Negro.\n\nKaman, who played in his first all-star game last season, averaged 18.5 points and 9.3 rebounds per game."
