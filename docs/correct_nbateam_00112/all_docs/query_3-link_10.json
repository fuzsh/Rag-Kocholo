NAS counters IBM’s X models by expanding its 8000 series By Jeffry Beeler CW West Coast Bureau MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — National Ad¬ vanced Systems, Inc. last week countered the recent announcement of IBM’s 3080 X main¬ frames by introducing five intermediate and large-scale processors that reportedly offer up to 10% greater performance than their Big Blue equivalents at a 5% lower price. Three of the additions to NAS’ processor line — the 8043, 8053 and 8063 — corre¬ spond to IBM’s recently announced 3083 Models EX, BX and JX, respectively. Round¬ ing out last week’s announcement were two other 8000 series newcomers: the 8023, which competes with IBM’s 4381 Model Group 2, and the high-end 8083, which com¬ petes with the industry giant’s 3081 Model KX. Although neither the 8023 nor the 8083 has any 8000 series predecessors, the 8043, 8053 and 8063 will replace NAS’ existing 8040, 8050 and 8060, respectively, according to the company’s president, David Martin. Users of installed 8040s, 8050s and 8060s can upgrade their systems in the field at no cost and, in so doing, transform the machines into 8043s, 8053s and 8063s, respectively, Martin said. In addition to providing 6% to 8% greater internal throughput than the 8000 series ma¬ chines they replace, the 8043, 8053 and 8063 models boast a maintenance price tag that is approximately 11% lower, according to NAS’ large systems marketing manager, Robert Ludwig. Together, the maintenance price cuts and the introduction of the five 8000 series main¬ frames constitute the second half of NAS’ re- See NAS page 2 Survey uncovers ironic twist to spread of micros in Fortune 1,000 companies By Jeffry Beeler CW West Coast Bureau LOS ANGELES — The suddenness with which personal computers burst on the scene caught many information systems managers by surprise and deprived them of a large measure of control, which they are now scrambling madly to regain. Ironically, however, personal computers remain woefully underused within most big businesses — a problem with which MIS di¬ rectors have only recently begun to come to grips. These and similar conclusions highlight the results of a recent survey conducted by Management Science America, Inc., which asked Fortune 1,000 companies to describe their current microcomputer installations and predict how their personal computer pur¬ chases will change in the future. The survey by the Atlanta-based software publisher also produced at least two other major findings: ■ Large corporations have begun only re¬ cently to buy small quantities of microcom¬ puters for evaluation purposes and are now busily experimenting with the machines in an effort to find out whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs. ■ As the year progresses and as personal computers gradually prove their ability to yield a significant return on investment, pur¬ chases of microcomputer products in the big See MSA page 4 FYI Look before leaping, Juneau learns hard way By Edward Wtarner CW staff JUNEAU, Alaska — It was the kind of mistake that often happens in a home com¬ puter store. The customer does not know what he wants and ends up spending more than he should. In this case, it happened on a bigger scale, and the price tag could reach $490,000. That is what the city -borough of Juneau — with a $ 1 .2 million data processing bud¬ get — ^ could end up paying for continued use of its outside service bureau and a software needs assessment study by a lo¬ cal consulting firm. It will incur those un¬ anticipated costs because its new in-house computer system, which was slated to go on-line in February, is unlikely to be on¬ line for another two years, according to DP director Jeannie Miller. The Wang Laboratories, Inc. VS 90 mini¬ computer system and software, purchased for a total of $600,000, were expected to go on-line six months from installation. That, Miller admitted, was an unreason¬ able expectation. The computer is now in place, but the software, from S-Qubed, Inc., is being held back until it can be tai¬ lored to the city-borough’s specific needs. What are those needs? That is the hitch. Miller, who was not hired until after the implementation program was under way, said that no thorough assessment of soft¬ ware needs was ever made by the city -bor¬ ough, a combined city-county form of gov¬ ernment, when it dove headlong into the in-house computer project. The problem, according to Miller, is that no one involved in the decision to convert to an in-house system knew all that much about data processing. She noted that pri¬ or to her arrival, the city-borough’s DP de¬ partment consisted of two data entry clerks working at terminals linked to the service bureau Systems Northwest, Inc. Miller was quick to note that of the un¬ slated $490,000 in costs, the $120,000 the city-borough expects to pay consultants David George and Associates for the needs assessment is the cost for a project the city should have undertaken in the first place. She admitted, however, that the $300,000 to $370,000 planned into her department’s budget for the remainder of this and all of the 1984-85 fiscal year could be exceeded if the computer system does not come on¬ line until April 1986. Miller refused to point a finger of blame at any individual or entity within the city- borough. “There isn’t anybody to point to,’’ she said. “The people who wanted this See JUNEAU page 6 2 COMPUTERWORLD APRIL 16, 1984 NEWS Stratus to extend its supermini line By Tom Henkel CW staff NATICK, Mass. — Stratus Com¬ puter, Inc. is scheduled to announce tomorrow two high-end additions to its Stratus/32 line of fault- tolerant superminicomputers. While Stratus is calling the proces¬ sors its Extended Architecture (XA) models, a spokesman said the term is not to be confused with IBM’s MVS/ XA operating system. Like the origi¬ nal Stratus/32 processor, which has been renamed the FT 200, the new XA 400 and XA 600 use the firm’s VOS operating system. An enhanced version of VOS, Ver¬ sion 3.0, is being announced to sup¬ port the XA 400 and XA 600. Howev¬ er, all applications developed for the FT 200 will run without modification on the newly announced machines. Stratus noted. Use Motorola 68010 Unlike the FT 200, which uses the older Motorola, Inc. 68000 micro¬ processor, the XA 400 and XA 600 use Motorola’s 68010 microproces¬ sor. In addition, the XA 400 offers 3.1 times the internal performance of the FT 200, and the XA 600 offers 8.2 times the performance of the FT 200, according to Stratus’ director of product marketing, Nicholas J. Bolo¬ gna. Current FT 200 users can field-up¬ grade to the XA 400, but not to the top-of-the-line XA 600. The reason, Bologna explained, is that in addition to using a different CPU board, the XA 600 offers twice as much main memory (up to 16M bytes) as the FT 200 and XA 400 and incorporates 48K bytes of cache memory. The FT 200 and XA 400 have a maximum 8M bytes of main memory and do not of¬ fer a cache memory. The XA 400 has four internal CPUs, which can simultaneously exe¬ cute instructions. The XA 600 has six Stratus/32 multiprocessor CPU design internal CPUs. Both hav^ redundant CPU boards, which perform the same operations in lockstep; if an error is detected in one CPU board, the sys¬ tem shuts it down, allowing the sec¬ ond CPU board to continue process¬ ing. As a result. Stratus claimed, the user will not experience performance degradation. Purpose and prices The Stratus/32 line was developed primarily to perform transaction pro¬ cessing applications, and, Bologna said, all three models have been geared to complement IBM main¬ frame environments. For example, some financial users install Stratus/32 series processors as front-end processors in IBM-ori¬ ented automated teller machine ap¬ plications. Up to 32 Stratus/32 systems, in any combination, can be linked in a network with existing FT 200 sys¬ tems by using the firm’s Stratalink local-area network. A basic XA 400 configuration, which costs $185,000 and is slated to be available in October, includes a 20- slot chassis, two multiprocessor CPUs, 4M bytes of duplexed main memory, two communications con¬ trollers, two disk controllers, a tape drive and systems software. It can be expanded to up to 8M bytes of du¬ plexed main memory with up to 21G bytes of disk storage. Up to 128 workstations and up to three tape drives can be attached to the system. The basic XA 600 configuration in¬ cludes a 40-slot chassis, two multi¬ processor CPUs with 48K bytes of cache memory, 8M bytes of duplexed main memory, two communications controllers, two disk controllers, a tape controller and tape drive and systems software. In addition, the XA 600 incorporates arithmetic pro¬ cessors, which are said to improve the unit’s performance in compute¬ intensive applications. The XA 600 can be configured with up to 16M bytes of duplexed main memory ,-42G bytes of disk stor¬ age, 256 workstations and three tape drives. The basic configuration costs $270,000 and will be available in May, Stratus said. An upgrade kit that allows FT 200 users to migrate to the XA 400 costs $45,000 until July 17. It will be priced at $64,000 after that date, Bo¬ logna said. Stratus is located at 17 Strathmore Koad, Natick, Mass. 01760. from page 1 ply to IBM’s recent additions to its X model processors [CW, Feb. 27]. The first half occurred in late March, when NAS announced reductions in purchase prices and expansions in . main memory for its existing AS/ 9000 line of large-scale processors. NAS’ two-stage response to IBM came hard on the heels of the indus¬ try giant’s announcement of six X models for its 3083, 3081 and 3084 mainframe families. Although it boosts the 3080 line’s performance by 5% to 14%, the IBM offering suf¬ fers from at least one serious short¬ coming: Users of existing 3083, 3081 and 3084 systems are reportedly un¬ able to upgrade the machines in the field to their X series equivalents. No such barrier to field upgradability, however, applies to any of NAS’ five new 8000 main¬ frames, Martin said. In addition to offering a less wrenching migration path than the X series machines, the 8000 processors reportedly compare favorably to their IBM rivals in internal perfor¬ mance. The 8023, for example, at least equals the power of the 4381 Model Group 2 and, in some in¬ stances, outperforms its IBM coun¬ terpart by as much as 10%, Ludwig said, while the 8043 typically pro¬ vides 10% greater throughput than the 3083 Model EX. The 8053, 8063 and 8083, mean¬ while, match the performance of their 3083 or 3081 equivalents, ac¬ cording to an NAS spokesman. Intended primarily for remote, de¬ centralized computing sites rather than for large corporate MIS facili¬ ties, the five members of NAS’ 8000 line span three mainframe perfor¬ mance ranges, Martin said. The 8023 is classified as an inter¬ mediate-scale processor and provides a migration path for 4381 -class users who need additional capacity, but want to cofttinue using comparative¬ ly old IBM operating systems, such as DOS/VSE. The 8083, by contrast, qualifies as a- true large-scale, dual-processing CPU, with performance exceeding 8 million instructions per second (Mips), and serves as a bridge to NAS’ largest mainframe family, the 9000. Together, the 8083 and 8023 bracket the 8043, 8053 and 8063 models, which NAS categorized as entry-level, large-scale machines with internal performance ranging from 4 to 8 Mips. The 8043, 8053 and 8063 define the boundary where us¬ ers typically make the transition from DOS or VM to newer operating systems like MVS, Martin said. As long as they remain at the 8023 or 8043 end of the mainframe perfor¬ mance spectrum, most users will probably be content to continue oper¬ ating in relatively old software envi¬ ronments, such as DOS/VSE.. But once they migrate to the 8053-class performance level or beyond, custom¬ ers are usually forced to convert to MVS, Ludwig added. All five members of the 8000 main¬ frame line expand to hold up to 32M bytes of main memory and 24 chan¬ nels. The processors also support the 2K-byte, storage-protect key, which is reportedly necessary for accommo¬ dating older IBM operating systems like DOS/VSE, DOS, VM, VSl and MVS 3.8. A 4M-byte 8023 with eight chan¬ nels costs $639,000, while the 8043, 8053 and 8063 sell for $1.26 million, $1.76 million and $2.25 million, re¬ spectively, in 8M-byte, eight-channel configurations. A 16M-byte 8083 with 16 channels costs $3.5 million. Although the 8043 is available now, shipments of the 8023, 8053 and 8063 are not set to begin untU the third, second and fourth quarters of this year, respectively. The 8083 is scheduled to be available during next' year’s first quarter. NAS is located at 800 E. Middle- field Road, Mountain View, Calif. 94042.

(Geisco) last week went to the commercial end- user market offering dial-up use of its 600-city teleprocessing network. In a related announcement, the company revealed it has entered into a joint marketing agreement with Wang Laboratories, Inc. for end-to- end document distribution to Wang personal computers via the Geisco Quik-Comm electronic mail service. Geisco, which had been expected to make its network available to cus¬ tomers last year, introduced a value- added net for transmission, process¬ ing, storage and integration of data between privately owned computer installations within the U.S. It thus became one of a growing number of old-line time-sharing firms to sell ac¬ cess to its teleprocessing network as a way of filling excess capacity left by the dwindling of the once-lucra- tive remote computing business. Christened Mark-Net, Geisco’s data communications network will be unbundled from the company’s 14- year-old Mark III packet-switching network and will combine satellite transmissions with 100,000 miles of land lines. However, the Rockville, Md.-based firm is aiming to construct an all-satellite system in order to in¬ tegrate voice and data transmissions in a single shed on customers’ proper¬ ty and to bypass anticipated access charges, according to Gerhard O. Mueller, engineering manager at Geisco. Mueller admitted the all-satellite network represents Geisco’s bid to make information networking profit¬ able through “economies of scale.” It is doubtful if any information ser¬ vices company has yet turned a prof¬ it through networking, according to industry analysts. The value-added network an¬ nounced last week will offer elec¬ tronic mail and bulletin board soft¬ ware as well as error detection and retransmission, full redundancy and central site control of remote nodes, said Robert D. McCalley, general manager of Geisco’s network opera¬ tion. McCalley added that the net will support synchronous and asynchro¬ nous communications through either X.25 or asynchronous interfaces. In addition, the information net¬ work will enable data communica¬ tions between IBM hosts and 3270 terminal clusters or bisynchronous IBM first-quarter profits up 23%, ARMONK, N.Y. — IBM showed profits of $1.2 billion for its first quarter, up 23.1% over the $976 mil¬ lion reported in the year-ago period. Earnings per share were $1.97, up 21.6% from the 1983 quarter, the company announced last week. Worldwide revenues for the quar¬ ter totaled $9.5 billion, up 15.7% from the $8.2 billion reported a year earlier. Revenues from sales grew 38.4% to $5.4 billion, while revenues from rentals decreased 26.2% to $1.9 billion. Revenues from services were $2.1 billion, up 25.8% from the $1.7 billion reported in the 1983 first quarter. “Order activity for our products MSA from page 1 business realm will steadily grow. The purpose of the survey, which elicited about 500 responses, was to lay the information groundwork for the creation of MSA’s Micro Distribu¬ tion Division, according to the firm’s senior vice-president, Howard Smith. Headquartered in this Southern Cali¬ fornia city, the division provides large corporations with personal computer application packages from multiple vendors. Although micros are slowly gain¬ ing acceptance in the commercial world, big businesses have barely scratched the surface of the ma¬ chines’ potential usefulness. “Most large corporations use their personal computers for only about an hour a day and run only one application on the machines,” Smith said. Smith’s conclusion is borne out by the survey, which shows that most Fortune 1,000 firms use their micros strictly for doing spreadsheets. The only other personal computer appli¬ cations found to be significant in the study are office productivity, data base management and accounting. Although many microcomputers may be able to justify their existence solely as spreadsheet generators, the machines are equally capable of serv¬ ing in many other capacities as well. Moreover, the vast untapped poten¬ tial of personal computers is slowly being recognized by top management, which is increasingly demanding that users squeeze as much informa¬ tion processing mileage from the products as possible. Smith said. Toward that end, many Fortune 1,000 corporations are beginning to shed indifference to personal com¬ puting and are planning to increase their personal computer acquisitions incrementally. “Large companies are starting to feel a lot of pressure from their end users and are now trying to learn how microcomputers work in big organizations and determine whether they want to buy additional personal computers,” Smith said. The big business world’s budding infatuation with micros is reflected in MSA’s survey results, where 11% of the respondents indicated their in¬ tention to buy 100 to 500 personal computers this year, and another 11% indicated 50 to 100 units. As the business sector’s microcom¬ puter population has grown, large corporations have shown an in¬ creased interest in justifying the ma¬ chines’ costs. A case in point is a large Northern California user com¬ pany that recently evaluated the per¬ formance of its 50 to 100 personal computers and ultimately credited the products with cutting costs by $6 million. Smith said. In other comments, the MSA senior vice-president described most MIS managers as woefully ignorant about controllers at remote sites. Support of IBM 2780 and 3780 re¬ mote job entry terminals as well as Systems Network Architecture and Synchronous Data Link Control is yet to come, McCalley said. Microcomputers sold by IBM, Ap¬ ple Computer, Inc. and Radio Shack can be hooked up to the network. Wang personal computers will be the next pieces of hardware expected to be able to plug in, McCalley said. Geisco’s remote computing ser¬ vices sales force will market the val¬ ue-added network with the help of a number of “specialists,” McCalley said. Observers noted Geisco’s mar¬ keting strength with Fortune 1,000 firms, but questioned whether time¬ sharing sales representatives would be successful at selling a different technology and bundle of services. The joint marketing agreement with Wang caught visitors to Geisco’s news conference here last week by surprise. Under the agreement, sales reps from each firm will essentially recommend the other’s product. Wang, however, has mqde known its intention to build an information net¬ work of its own under contract to Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.

Now many of them are at a complete loss to know what to do.” applications market By Paul Gillin CW staff FORT LEE, N.J. — On-Line Soft¬ ware International, Inc. is immedi¬ ately halting development and mar¬ keting of the Production and Inventory Optimization System (Pios), its manufacturing resource planning (MRP) software for IBM’s CICS/DL/1 environment. Introduced two years ago, Pios was On-Line’s first departure from its traditional systems software fo¬ cus. Billed as a modular manufactur¬ ing control system, the package con¬ sists of eight functional modules and sold for up to $300,000 for an entire system. Pios is a version of an MRP prod¬ uct developed by Rath & Strong Sys¬ tems Products, Inc. for Cullinet Soft¬ ware, Inc.’s IDMS data base management system. On-Line invest¬ ed $1.5 million converting it to nm.in the CICS/DL/1 environment. The company has sold two complete Pios systems and one partial system. On-Line President Jack Berdy said it became apparent in recent months that the staff commitment required to support the product was running far ahead of revenues from the prod¬ uct. “We didn’t realize the support requirements for each sale,” he said. “It was a draw on both talent and money. It takes so long to make a sale in the first place, and then customers want a lot of extra support after that.” Since all development costs have already been expensed, the decision to discontinue Pios will not affect the company’s bottom line, he said. On- Line is negotiating maintenance con¬ tracts with existing customers, but maintenance will probably be picked up by Rath & Strong eventually, Berdy said. The 18 On-Line employees who were assigned to Pios have all been reassigned within the company. Berdy said he believes the MRP market is underpriced and is not yet mature enough to reap large prof¬ its. He said On-Line has no plans to re-, enter the applications market in the foreseeable future. Second-class postage paid at Framingham, Mass., and additional mailing offices.

(And how SYDOC can change ’em!) Call (201) 568-9700. 4 SYDOC: Structured Documentation System In keeping with our tradition of printing “aii the DP news that fits,” we present Six Unexpurgated Facts About COBOL Maintenance and Documentation: 1 . Very few programmers— male of female— have ever established a meaningful relationship with documentation. What they produce is seldom very good— and it’s almost never updated. 2. The result is a generation that might be called “Orphan COBOL Programs.” They may have fathers. And they may have mothers. But birth certificates they have not got! 3. The rub comes when you try to update these orphans to meet the demands of the brave new world of DP You can try to deduce the logic of such orphans by referring to the source code. But that’s a slow and dangerous business. And your name had better be Sherlock Holmes. 4. Or you can simply ask the author of the program about the underlying logic. But guess what? He or she has just left for an exciting new job in Tahiti. 5. What you’re probably left with is hand-drawn hierarchical charts— a long bus ride from structured programming techniques. And if you try to insert new code without understanding the logic, watch out. You’ll probably introduce so many bugs you’ll never be free of the exterminator! 6. The cost to society is high. It’s been estimated that as much as 80% of your entire DP budget may be going into modifying complex COBOL programs! WITH SYDOC YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE TO ALL THAT: SYDOC is not a sort but a new and exciting Structured Documentation System for OS/VS. It takes the responsibility for documentation out of the hands of programmers and puts it on the broad shoulders of the computer. SYDOC works three ways: 1. SYDOC IS GREAT FOR MAKING MODIFICATIONS: It works like an X-Ray. It analyzes existing programs and prints out charts that tell you everything you need to, know about the program’s logic, hierarchical structure, variables, and relationships between statements. You can quickly and safely pinpoint code to be changed. And you’re far less likely to introduce bugs because you know the logic. 2. SYDOC IS GREAT FOR DOCUMENTING NEW BORNS: It tracks new programs and automatically produces first-rate structured documentation. You have an accurate and concise record of every program your staff develops. A record that can never be lured away by an executive recruiter. 3. SYDOC IS GREAT FOR MANAGERS: It permits you to establish, uniform, structured-documentation standards and stick to thern. You don’t have to nag programmers about documentation. The ball is in the computer’s court. So if you’d like to reduce the size of your COBOL maintenance budget, give us a call. Dr. SYDOC will be glad to put you on his famous “Waste Watcher” diet! Syncsort Incorporated 560 Sylvan Ave., Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632 6 COMPUTERWORLD APRIL 16, 1984 NEWS DEC ties micros more tightly into office environment By Eric Bender CW staff NEW YORK — Digital Equipment Corp. last week introduced a host of products here that it said enhance its Professional and Rainbow personal computers and integrate the micros more closely into that vendor’s office system environments. Highlighting the Professional side of the announcements were Decnet local-area networking for the Profes¬ sional 350 and a software package for both the Professional 325 and 350 that brings many features of DEC’S VAX/All-In-1 office automation soft¬ ware down to the desktop micro (sto¬ ry below). On the Rainbow side of the an¬ nouncements, DEC replaced its Rain¬ bow 100 with a more powerful flop¬ py disk version that will sell for the same price. The firm also unveiled Binary Syn¬ chronous Communications packages enabling Rainbows to emulate IBM 2780/3780 and 3270 terminals (story below). The announcements “expand Digi¬ tal’s office strategy to provide sys¬ tems solutions at every level of an or¬ ganization — personal, departmental and corporate — with the communi¬ cations to tie those products togeth¬ er,” the compiany said. However, some industry analysts remarked that one remaining gap in the product line is a Decnet interface for the Rainbow, but DEC is expected to introduce this feature at a later date. The new products will be on dis¬ play this week as DEC begins a nine- city exhibition tour that will focus on its personal computers, microcom¬ puters and terminals. The Spectrum ’84 tour will open on April 18 in Dal¬ las at Loew’s Anatole, then move to Atlanta’s Peachtree Plaza April 25- 27; Houston’s Albert Thomas Civic Center, April 30-May 3; Chicago’s Conrad Hilton, May 8-10; the Salt Lake Palace in Salt Lake City, May 15-16; the Memorial Coliseum in Portland, Ore., May 18-19; San Fran¬ cisco’s Sheraton Palace, May 22-24; and St. Louis’ Chase Park Plaza, May 30-31. The tour will make its final stop at the Meadowlands Hilton in the New York area on June 11-13. Among offerings for the Pro: Ethernet local networking DEC’S Model lOOB heads string of Rainbow announcements NEW YORK — Digital Equipment Corp.’s introduction here last week of enhancements to its Professional 325 and 350 microcomputers repre¬ sents “the most important product announcements since we began ship¬ ping the product,” said Nathan Ka- lowski. Professional product group manager. Among those announce¬ ments were: ■ Ethernet-based local-area net¬ working with Decnet, which allows the Professional 350 to act as a dis¬ tributed workstation within the Digi¬ tal Network Architecture, along with PDP-11 minicomputers and VAX- 11 superminis. The Professional previously of¬ fered file-structure compatibility with PDP-1 Is and VAX-1 Is, but links were primarily limited to data trans¬ fers. The Decnet connection gives the Professional full access to all re¬ sources on the network, Kalowski said. Additionally, intensive processing functions can be handled locally, en¬ abling host computers to handle data base operations more efficiently, DEC said. The PRO/Decnet software, which runs on the Professional 350’s lOM- byte Winchester disk, will cost $95 when it becomes available next month. The Digital Ethernet CTI Net¬ work Adapter network controller, also available in May, is priced at $895. The Digital Equipment Local Network Interconnect, which allows Ethernet-compatible devices to be grouped together up to 50 meters away from the network connection, is available now for $985. ■ The PRO/Office Workstation software package, which allows the Professional to function as a distrib¬ uted workstation for the VAX/All-In- 1 office automation package. DEC’S All-In-1 office information system is an applications software package that provides a range of in¬ tegrated tools, such as document pro¬ cessing, electronic mail, calendars and decision support. The package will be ready next month for $950. ■ For videotex applications, two software packages that allow the Professional 350 to act as a North American Presentation-Level Proto¬ col Syntax (NAPLPS) videotex termi¬ nal or as a stand-alone desktop video¬ tex host. PRO/NAPLPS works on the Pro¬ fessional’s existing hardware and will be available next month at $195 for P/OS Version 1.7 systems. PRO/ Videotex permits users to store a complete videotex data base on the Professional’s hard disk drive, signif¬ icantly reducing the communications costs associated with accessing a re¬ mote videotex host. PRO/Videotex will be available in May for $895 for P/OS Version 1.7 systems. ■ Version 2.0 of the P/OS operat¬ ing system, with enhancements, in¬ cluding Decnet support. Version 2.0 now comes standard with both the Professional hardware and with Dec- net software; it can be purchased separately for $250. ■ The Professional CTS-300 soft¬ ware system, which offers Dibol as a software development tool to busi¬ ness users. It is available for $995. ■ Engineering Systems Corp.’s De¬ sign Graphix/Executive computer- aided design and drafting software, available now for $595. More information about these products is available from DEC in Maynard, Mass. 01754. NEW YORK — Digital Equipment Corp. announced here last week that it is replacing its Rainbow 100 per¬ sonal computer with the Rainbow lOOB, a more powerful version of the floppy-disk-based microcomput¬ er that will sell for the same price. The Rainbow lOOB offers twice the base memory (128K bytes) and four times the expansion memory (768K bytes) of the Rainbow 100 and can be upgraded to accept a hard disk drive. The Rainbow lOOB is available now for $2,750, excluding keyboard and monitor. With keyboard and monitor, it costs about $3,500, said Robert Nusbaum, Rainbow marketing manager. An option that adds a lOM- byte hard disk to the Rainbow lOOB, creating a Rainbow 100 Plus, will sell for $2,800. In announcing the Rainbow lOOB, DEC emphasized its plans to support existing Rainbow 100 users. In other Rainbow announcements, the compa¬ ny introduced: ■ An expansion of the Rainbow lOO’s memory, adding up to 768K bytes of random-access memory (RAM) for a total of 832K bytes. The company said 64K-byte boards cost $149; 256K-byte boards are priced at $695. ■ For a limited time, two systems based on the Rainbow 100, each fea¬ turing a 5M-byte hard disk drive and everything else included in a basic system except a monitor. A system with 128K bytes of RAM will sell for $3,995; a version with 256K bytes of RAM will be offered for $4,595. ■ The Gold Key Country Kit pack¬ age, which allows the Rainbow lOOB and 100 Plus to be used as VAX-11 terminals for the All-In-1 office in¬ formation system. The package is available now for $245. ■ Poly-BSC/RJE and Poly-BSC/ 3270 Binary Synchronous Communi¬ cations (BSC) programs, allowing Rainbows to emulate IBM 2780/3780 and 3270 terminals, respectively. Both are currently available, Poly- BSC/RJE for $500 and Poly-BSC/ 3270 for $595. ■ A Rainbow version of Digital Research, Inc.’s Concurrent CP/M, which allows up to four CP/M appli¬ cations to run simultaneously. Most off-the-shelf CP/M applications “which are well-behaved and don’t dive down to call the hardware di¬ rectly” will run under Concurrent CP/M, Nusbaum said. ■ The availability for the Rain¬ bow series of third-party application software now sold by DEC: Context Management Systems, Inc.’s Context MBA, priced at $695; Samna Corp.’s Samna Word II, $450; and Software Publishing Corp.’s PFStFile and PFS:Report, each offered for $140. ■ A Personal Presentation Sys- tem^ available under agreement with Polaroid Corp., which turns Rainbow screen graphics into 35mm color slides and prints “on your desk” for less than $1 a slide, Nusbaum said. The system costs about $7,200. ■ The Rainbow Remote Graphics Instruction Set (Regis) program, which permits Rainbow users to work with VAX- 11 -based and PDP- 11 -based graphics applications, available now for $175. ■ The Technical Character Set, a read-only-memory-based product foe generating special characters. It is slated to be ready in June for $95. More information about these products is available from DEC in Maynard, Mass. 01754. CORRECTIONS Due to a reporter’s error, the story on Page 6 in the April 9 issue of Com- puterworld said the DEC high-end VAX adds 30% to 50% more power.” According to Digital Equipment Corp.’s performance claims for the VAX-11/785, the system can actually operate 50% to 70% faster than the Model 780 in compute-intensive ap¬ plications in both commercial and technical markets. The story about the reinstatement of criminal charges against three de¬ fendants in a highly publicized trade- secrets theft case [“Judge reinstates charges,” CW, April 9] incorrectly identified National Advanced Sys¬ tems, Inc. (NAS) as a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd. NAS is owned by National Semiconductor Corp. and acquires its IBM-compati¬ ble mainframes from Hitachi. “Software conference seeks new committee members” [CW, April 9]' incorrectly stated that the Confer¬ ence on Software Maintenance will be held Nov. 11-13, 1984. The confer¬ ence is set for Nov. 11-13, 1985. JUNEAU from page 1 wanted it very much and were very sincere.” She also refused to blame S-Qubed for the software delays, saying those delays are the city’s fault and arise from its lack of certainty about its software needs. She speculated that the software purchased for the sys¬ tem is better suited for use with com¬ mercial applications and will have to be tailored for municipal uses. Not everyone involved in the city- borough’s government is so magnani¬ mous, however. According to press accounts, one city-borough assembly- man chastised the city-borough’s ad¬ ministrators and consultants, who re¬ portedly recommended the system last year. “We were convinced our people were right — they were wrong,” Assemblyman Hugh Grant told theJuneau Empire. Miller could not say where the idea originated that a new, in-house .system could be brought on-line in only six months. ■■ She said she arrived on the job shortly after, the decision was made and found “they [S-Qubed] were go¬ ing to start dropping software on us.

That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet. — William Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet By John Gallant CW staff What’s in a name, indeed. For the manufacturers of large systems soft¬ ware, whose product labels are care¬ fully crafted to convey a lasting im¬ age or grab a prospective buyer’s eye, a name can sometimes spell success for a package. And the stories behind the names are often as interesting as the names themselves. “It’s very difficult to come up with a name for a new product,’’ said Rich¬ ard Peres, head of marketing for ADR Corp.’s Adroit software. “You need a one-word name that people can easi¬ ly identify with. But that word can’t be too common, or people won’t asso¬ ciate it with the product for very long. “It should either be a name that says exactly what the product does or an adjective that describes the product or an acronym for a longer name.” Peres and colleague Barry Walter, product manager for Adroit, spent nearly four months mulling over names for the recently developed computer-based training course gen¬ erator. The duo was unhappy with the product name — Natural write — that came with the package when it was acquired from CAI, Inc., so Wal¬ ter went to the dictionary for assis¬ tance. “He looked at every word that started with ADR in that book,” Peres recalled, “and the best one was Adroit. “It means ‘skillful and clever,’ which we feel is a good image for the package, and it also worked out to an acronym — the ADR On-line Interac¬ tive Training system. I didn’t like it at first, and I spent a month trying to beat it, but I Just couldn’t.” Unfamiliar with the Wizard deci¬ sion support system (DSS) and the Socrate data base management sys¬ tem (DBMS)? Those are the names under which two widely used soft¬ ware packages are marketed in Eu¬ rope. Their respective manufacturers, Comshare, Inc. and United Software Systems & Services Corp. (USSS), had hoped to use those names in the U.S., but were unable to do so be¬ cause of possible copyright viola¬ tions. The products are better known here as the System W DSS and the Clio DBMS. “When the development project for System W began,” said Comshare spokesman Larry Eiler, “we code-named the project W as a sort of front-end acronym for the ‘World’s Best Modeling System,’ which was what we set out to make. When the software was ready to be marketed, we developed the name Wizard, but when problems arose with that, we settled on System W. Naturally we were disappointed, but the System W name seems to have worked out just fine.” When the first version of Clio was developed by Syseca, Inc. at the Uni¬ versity of Grenoble in France, the DBMS was named in honor of the Greek philosopher Socrates. Finding that name already spoken for in the U.S., the company labeled the soft¬ ware Clio instead — a reference to the Greek goddess of memory, ac¬ cording to a spokesman for USSS, which supports and distributes the system here. McCormack & Dodge Corp. (M&D) held a company wide contest to name what would later be known as the Millennium fourth-generation lan¬ guage system. \" As a group of marketing strate¬ gists reviewed the contest entries, M&D Vice-President of Marketing Bob Weiler stood and listened. After a few moments, according to a spokesman, Weiler turned to the group and said, “We’re talking about the future, aren’t we? How about Mil¬ lennium?” Despite all the other offer¬ ings,- that name stuck. Images of the future Images of the future were also be¬ hind the name of Intel Corp.’s System 2000 DBMS, according to spokesman Dale Weisman. “System 2000 was de¬ veloped by a company known as ' Management Research International, Inc., which Intel later acquired. “While they were working on the product at their headquarters in Aus¬ tin, Texas, a theater nearby was playing 2001: A Space Odyssey. They came up with System 2000: to reflect the kind of advanced technology por¬ trayed in the film.” There isn’t always a logical expla¬ nation behind how a product is named, though, as the case of Bell Laboratories’ Unix operating system illustrates. “About 14 years agO, Bell Labs was working on the Multics op¬ erating system with MIT,” according to spokesman Ralph Dobriner. “We dropped out of that project because Ken Thompson, one of the co-devel¬ opers of Unix, felt he could develop a simpler operating system. He came up with the name Unix as a pun on Multics, a play on words, even though the systems have nothing in common.” IMS VERSUS CICS DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCES? Once, it was enough to know only CICS or only IMS. Today, the on-line world is expanding so that you can no lon^r afford not to know the capabilities of both.

Take Oracle Corp.’s Oracle data base management system (DBMS). “In 1977, when we were still named Relational Software, Inc., we got a contract with a govern¬ ment agency to develop a relation¬ al DBMS,” spokesman P. Michael Seashols recalled. “The code name for that project was Oracle, and the founders of the company decided to stick with that name when the software was offered commercially,” according to Seashols. “In 1983, we changed the com¬ pany name based on the wide product recognition Oracle had earned,” Seashols went on to say. Computer Corp. of America A spokeswoman for Computer Corp. of America said that compa¬ ny’s Model 204 DBMS, the off¬ spring of a sponsored research program, was initially known as Model 101. The numeric portion of that ti¬ tle was to change as the software underwent revisions on the road to becoming a commercially viable system. When the package was re¬ leased, Computer Corp. of America chose to retain the internal nam¬ ing structure. ^ Mathematica Products Group Originally developed as a mar¬ keting application program for Al¬ lied Chemical Co. in the mid- 1960s, Mathematica Products Group’s Ramis was an acronym for the Rapid Access Marketing Infor¬ mation System. When the application later be¬ came a “full-blown product,” ac¬ cording to Mathematica spokes¬ man Paul Grabscheid, the company retained the Ramis acro¬ nym, simply replacing “Market¬ ing” with “Management.” . “In the mid-1970s, we complete¬ ly rewrpte the package to Version II, and it came to be known as Ra¬ mis II,” Grabscheid said. “Some people confuse the name with the Egyptian king Ramses; but it isn’t quite that glamorous. It’s nothing more than an acronym that \"few people remember today,” according to Grabscheid. I 1 APRIL 16, 1984 COMPUTERWORLD 9 NEWS \\ Last night someone accessed the peESOpnd database.: Was this for a iegitiraate business need, or is yoOf VM system wide open? Your computer hdds the design fdare for the company's hottest new product to be introduced next month. Who has seen, or even copied those plans? You need security for your system, and for the applications and data it suppcxts. Meeting these security needs requires an entirely different aji^roach in a VM environment than in any other environment. THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT When most peo{^ think of secu¬ rity for an IBM mainhame, they have as a mental starting point one of IBM's batch operating systems. Giyar that DOS has been around since the 60s and MVS siTKe the trad 70's, this is understandable. So rncm people have a mind¬ set that links a security system to moperMii^ 5{«fem,ra|her than a machine, ^ditionally, tire operating sys- to controls the user: chine functfons independently of the others, making sharing of re¬ sources between machines diffi¬ cult at best. THE COMRUUSON In contrast to other IBM main¬ frame environments, such as MVS, the VM control program (CP) allows pAysrea/ access to equipment. Thus, a user can ac¬ cess any lo^cal piece of a physi¬ cal entity in his virtual machine.- Machine Machine In fact, in MVS, it controb the user at a logical levd. It or¬ dinarily allows access only to dataseb and erther logcal entities. THE VM ENVIRONMENT ‘ Under VM, mnltifdc virtual ma¬ chines can be run on one real madiine. Inside these ‘machines’, various seb of inductions, or cp- eratirig systems, can be run. For cxati^le, one virtual machine mi^t nm CMS, another DOS or MVS. A unique feature of VM b that each virtual machine (or user) b sqrarated by hardware feom other virtual machines on die same CPU. Each wtual ma- What thb means for security is that a user in VM can bypass a logical system such as CMS and do (hysical access in his virtual machine. For example, a user in MVS cannot execute a privileged instruction, such as starting I/O to a device. He must ask MVS to do it. In VM, a user can do it easily. Vendor names: Odd logic The Cat’s Pajamas, Pansophic Systems . . . By Paul Gillin CW staff From the sublime to the ridiculous, the names of software companies are often the result of a thought process that only a computer person can un¬ derstand. A mention surely must go to The Cat’s Pajamas, a Berkeley, Calif.- based seller of software for the pub¬ lishing industry. The small company got its name one night when its founder and president, Wayne Olson, was mulling over the idea with his four children. “I told the kids I was going to start a software company. The kids want¬ ed to know why it was called ‘soft¬ ware,’ ” Olson said. “I said it was something that had to fit comfort¬ ably. One of my children said, ‘Just like the cat’s pajamas.’ ” The unusual tag has caused some problems. “At the University of Ne¬ braska, the purchasing people re¬ fused to issue a purchase order to a company named The Cat’s Pajamas,” Olson said. “We’ve also had some people call the company and think they’ve got a wrong number.” But Olson plans to keep the name. “I think it’s memorable,” he ex¬ plained. “So many software compa¬ nies are named Automation some¬ thing or Service something that it all begins to sound the same.” Goal Systems International, Inc. sounds obvious enough, but “Goal” is actually an acronym for the last names of four Westinghouse Electric Corp. employees who in 1975 talked about starting their own company. Although the four eventually went their separate ways, Steve O’Donnell, the “O,” liked the acronym enough to keep it as the name for his fledgling firm. But the name has generated some misimderstanding. “People some¬ times think it’s a company that spe¬ cializes in motivating people,” O’Donnell said. Pansophic Systems, Inc.’s name was chosen by founder and chief ex¬ ecutive officer Joe Piscopo. “It comes from the Greek derivations ‘pan’ and ‘soph,’ which roughly translates to ‘universal wisdom,’ ” a spokeswom¬ an said. The company was founded in 1969. Tower Systems, Inc. of Irvine, Calif., was named for a building. One day in 1975, Tower President J. Greg¬ ory Siemon was talking with his law¬ yer about possible names for his new¬ ly established company. “Like all good decisions, this one was made in a bar,” according to Greg Collins, vice-president of marketing and sales. Siemon and his lawyer had ad¬ journed to a watering hole at the top of the Occidental Building in down¬ town Los Angeles. There, on the back of a, napkin. Tower Systems was christened in honor of the building that housed the tavern. Management Science America, Inc. started out as Management Science Atlanta, Inc., but as the company grew, so did the scope of its name. The change took place in 1971. , Candle Corp. draw^ its name from a slogan. The company was founded in 1977 with the motto, “innovators in illumination.” “It involves lighting the way for systems analysts and programmers into the mysteries of systems soft¬ ware,” said spokesman Michael 01- lins. Tone Software Corp., like many companies, was named for its flag¬ ship product. Introduced in 1974 and still on the market, the product is a utility that allows IBM’s TSO to run under IBM’s VSl operating system. Combining the “T” from TSO and the “one” from VSl, Tone was born. Today, Tone markets about a doz¬ en products, but is still latched firm¬ ly onto its 1 0-year-old identity. “We See NAMES page 10 What makes a name work? Expert offers guidelines By Paul Gillin CW staff SAN FRANCISCO — What do Digital Equipment Corp.’s Rain¬ bow, Software Publishing Corp.’s PFS series and Mathematica Prod¬ ucts Group, Inc.’s Ramis software all.have in common? They’re all poorly named prod¬ ucts, according to an expert here. Ira Bachrach has some very strong opinions about names. He is president of Namelab, Inc., a com¬ pany that commands a good deal of respect and a lot of money for the names it formulates for prod¬ ucts and companies. Namelab earns up to $30,000 per name and boasts a list of over 120 clients, including many of the top consumer products companies, Bachrach said. Its client base of late has increasingly included computer and software compa¬ nies. See TAG page 10 THE MISCONCEPTION The main lihirsy of the security gurus goes something like this: We must: 1) Define ownership ot all re¬ sources (tape, disk, machine access, etc.), 2) Specify rules to access those resources (hence the buzz¬ words “resource access con¬ trol”), and 3) Manage and monitor this effort. ■ This is what you get with a package from IBM such as RACF on MVS. One might conveniently think that the low level commands from such an MVS security im¬ plementation could be ‘moved’ to VM, but this is a dangerous misconception. Any security facility imple¬ mented in an operating system within VM, such as CMS, whose usage can be bypassed, is just smoke — ^not reali^ic at all. Think of a security system that modifies every possible CMS command to control logical access to fifes. Sounds good, but any program¬ mer can write a program outside CMS to beat it, or cc^)y an un¬ altered version erf a command from one of 10,000 plus other VM systems. The virtual machine is (he only level at which a VM system can be secured. THE SOLUTION First, what does VM itself offer for security? The VM directory defines users (virtual machines) and maps virtual to physical re¬ sources for those users. It con¬ tains a password for each user to access the system, and an op¬ tional password for access to each user’s disk by others. In fact. VM is relatively secure when users need not share. The simple reality though, is that programs and data must be shared among users. To be effective, a security package must work within the constraints oL and address the vulnerabilities of VM. It must be implemented at the control pro¬ gram level of VM — where it can¬ not be bypassed in CMS. It must be built within the VM directory scheme, so that it becomes an in¬ tegral part of the VM system, dnd it must not require modifications to any part of VM or CMS. The issue of security in the VM environment cannot be ap¬ proached in the same way as for batch operating systems. It re¬ quires a vendor who understands the intricacies of VM to develop a security package to meet the needs of the VM community. It requires a vendor with the ae- ativity to implement a system that addresses the unique features of VM. VM Software Inc. is the un¬ disputed leader among vendors of system software for the VM en¬ vironment. Our newest product, VMSECURE, was designed by our experienced staff of VM jxo- fessionals. VMSECURE is a re¬ source access control, directory management, and disk ^ace management s>'stem designed specifically to address the security needs of VM users. mwmii 2070 Chain Bridge Rd. ■■ Suite 355 Softwafc Inc.

Its names are the result of months of psychological, linguistic and legal research. They are intended to hit a carefully target¬ ed audience with a message that con¬ veys emotions, experiences and im¬ ages and does it in one or two syllables.

While DOD was recently given au¬ thority to review the export of com¬ puters to Western countries suspect¬ ed of being shipment points to the Eastern bloc [CW, April 2], a messy interagency dispute has pitted the DOD against the Department of Com¬ merce over the issue of controlling exports of small computers to the So¬ viet bloc. The interagency dispute broke into the open last December, as the U.S. met in Paris with its Europe¬ an allies and Japan at the Coordinat¬ ing Committee for Multilateral Ex¬ port Controls (Cocom). Negotiations with Cocom Cocom is the formal agency that the Western allies use to coordinate the transfer of technology to the So¬ viets through a formal licensing pro¬ cedure. The U.S. negotiating team was forced to ask its allies for an ex¬ tension of time while the U.S. govern¬ ment hammered out a formal position for presentation to Cocom this com¬ ing May on the issue of export con- ' trols on small computers. Last week, Perle told the Senate committee that the U.S. is currently negotiating within Cocom on the issue of small computer and electronic sales to the Soviets. ‘‘Some people believe that because these machines are widely available on the open market, we shouldn’t try to control the Soviet acquisition and [should] let it pass,” Perle said. ‘‘We believe that a control regime can be established. . . . We seek to control the ease with which the Soviets can buy computers, especially like the Grid. ‘‘We know we cannot put a her¬ metic seal around the Soviet Union,” he added, ‘‘but we don’t want them to be able to import them by the thou- - sands.” Lionel Olmer, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, told the committee that it is ‘‘a gross misstatement to suggest that the So¬ viets are technologically backward. They are producing 100% of their semiconductors used for military purposes and 45% for commercial uses.” He agreed with Perle on the need to restrict exports of semicon¬ ductor manufacturing equipment to the Soviets. ‘‘Volume controls are an issue when it comes to commercially avail¬ able equipment,” Olmer said. He add¬ ed that he is optimistic that agree¬ ment could be reached with DOD on the dispute. However, Perle revealed during his testimony that there are differences of view even within his own agency on the extent of the con¬ trols needed over commercially avail¬ able computers. Large U.S. companies that manu¬ facture computers that would be af¬ fected by the export controls have been putting pressure on the Reagan administration to ease up on the re¬ strictions that have been coming down on export licenses in recent months. v Give Ada to USSR, he says By Edward Warner CW staff NORWALK, Conn. — The U.S. should lift its embargo on shipments of sophisticated computer equipment to the Soviets and give them free training in the Ada language, which the Defense Department is now using to develop all its mission-critical ap¬ plications. Sound preposterous? Not if you want to save humanity from ‘‘World War Last,” writes Steven B. Weiss- man in the April issue of the ‘‘Ada- data Newsletter,” which he edits. According to Weissman, a nuclear war could be caused by a glitch or soft error in the Soviet Union’s ‘‘all but obsolescent processors.” A soft error occurs when natural radiation fools a computer into thinking an in¬ struction has been input. ‘‘Our very lives,” he wrote, ‘‘hang on the slim hope that either Russian computer environments are proofed against soft errors or that Soviet technicians know how to stop a launch in the face of a computer rebellion.” The article goes on to suggest that sales of computers to the Soviets will boost the domestic computer market and that sending the Soviets ‘‘a pre¬ sent of Ada” will ‘‘not only act as a sort of nuclear insurance policy, but will also help drive the domestic Ada market.” Is Weissman joking? Only in the article’s tone, he said in a telephone interview last week. He’s serious about the article’s central idea, one he admitted he has heard no other person put forth. ‘‘It seems like an oddball idea,” he said, ‘‘but it really isn’t.” While humorous in tone, the arti¬ cle had a darker point to make — that, in Weissman’s words, ‘‘thanks to automation, we know we can oblit¬ erate each other any time we want. Isn’t it time we worked toward a point where we could at least trust each other’s technology, if not each other?” The basis for that trust, Weissman argued, could be the high reliability of the Ada language, developed for the Defense Department for military uses in a worldwide software compe¬ tition. The language is so reliable it was named in January as the stan¬ dard for all U.S. military computer systems, according to Adadata pub¬ lisher Kenneth G. Bosomworth. In an interview last week. Bosom- worth said that Weissman was joking about selling any computer hardware to the Russians. ‘‘I’m not at all in fa¬ vor of letting the Russians have more computer hardware than they al¬ ready have,” Bosomworth said. But Weissman may not have been joking about offering the Ada lan¬ guage to the Soviets who, he wrote, are no further along in Ada develop¬ ment than we are. The language, a variant of Pascal, could be taught to Russian programmers and students by U.S. technicians, he wrote. r • Operates at 1200 and 0 to 300 bps. • Built-in automatic dialer. f Non-volatile memory stores 15 phone numbers of up to 31 digits each. • “Talks” in English to terminal operator. t Up to 26 user-programmable options are stored in modem memory, and can be keyed in from the front panel. i Calls can be originated or answered from terminal keyboard or modem front panel.

Filed late last month in New York Supreme Court by Micro/Macro, Inc., the suit asks $250,000 in compensa¬ tion. It claims that Hertz requested Micro/Macro to develop the terminal emulator so that Hertz could replace its Lear Siegler, Inc. ADM-32 termi¬ nals with IBM Personal Computer XT microcomputers and Victor Technol¬ ogies, Inc. 9000 microcomputers in its Fleet Rental Division offices across the country. Micro/Macro produced the termi¬ nal emulator in a six-week crash ef¬ fort, gave it to Hertz management and received its approval but no money, according to John Potye, Mi¬ cro/Macro’s vice-president for soft¬ ware service. “All they said was, ‘That’s nice,’ ’’ Potye said. “We per¬ formed the work to specifications in good faith, and Hertz just ignored its commitment.” Potye said he does not think Hertz ever put the emulator program into use. He speculated that Hertz lost in¬ terest in acquiring the emulator soft¬ ware when the executive who head¬ ed the project was transferred and his replacement “didn’t want to go down that path.” Hertz’s manager of public affairs, John Britton, said he hadn’t seen the suit and that his firm would prefer “to answer charges in court and not in the press.” He declined to comment further on the case. Hertz had still not responded to the suit through its attorneys by ear¬ ly last week,' Potye said, noting that the 30-day limit for such a response was drawing close. If the firm fails to respond, Potye said, the court could enter a default judgment against it. Micro/Macro’s manager of legal systems, Wayne Robertson, said that while he knows of no contract signed between the two firms, an exchange of letters had informed Hertz that Mi¬ cro/Macro “does not do work on speculation.” Potye said that approx¬ imately $65,000 was spent by Micro/ Macro in developing the software and that its agreement with Hertz promised reimbursement for those development costs, plus $52,000 for licensing the software to the rental firm and $ 1 1 ,000 for support and ser¬ vices. Security panel recommended WASHINGTON, D.C. — A Con¬ gressional subcommittee has wrapped up hearings on computer and. communications security and privacy by recommending the estab¬ lishment of a national commission to investigate a range of computer-re¬ lated problems. The recommendation was one of several presented at a press confer¬ ence last Wednesday by Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), chairman of the House Science and Technology Sub¬ committee on 'Transportation, Avia¬ tion and Materials, and Rep. Bill Car¬ ney (R-N.Y.), ranking subcommittee minority member. The two congressmen, whose sub¬ committee has conducted a year-long investigation into computer security problems in the government and the private sector, released a report pre¬ pared by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. The report maintains that insuffi¬ cient attention is paid by the federal government to the growing problems of computer crime, privacy and unau¬ thorized access of data bases. Commenting on the findings of the subcommittee, Glickman accused the government of paying “good lip ser¬ vice” to these issues without taking proper action to prevent what he called “catastrophes in this country waiting to happen both in and out of government.” Besides calling for a national com¬ mission, he listed several other steps to correct this situation: ■ The Office of Management and Budget (0MB) should “provide a fo¬ cus” for computer and telecommuni¬ cations security and privacy activi¬ ties within government, including the preparation of a manual to give agencies guidance in planning and implementing security measures. ■ “An intensive [security] train¬ ing effort is needed in thjs country for both computer users and security personnel. . . . The federal govern¬ ment ought to be involved in that, the National Science Foxindation [and] universities.” .■ 0MB should establish security data classification to protect sensi¬ tive computer data. ■ The\" National Bureau of Stan¬ dards should be given the resources to certify security methods and sys¬ tems for government and private computer users. Glickman said that if the adminis¬ tration does not adopt the national commission plan he will push the idea legislatively.

NCR 1884-1984 Celebrating the future ;?v APRIL 16. 1984 COMPUTERWORLD 13 NEWS AT&T, communications users oppose rate compromise By Phil Hirsch CW Washington Bureau WASHINGTON, D.C. — A compro¬ mise to resolve the complex, increas¬ ingly bitter battle over pending rates for dial-up and private-line service appeared headed for the scrap heap last week after it was vigorously op¬ posed by both AT&T and key commu¬ nications user groups. The proposal, which elicited com¬ ments from about 120 carriers, users and related organizations, was ad¬ vanced last month by the National Exchange Carriers Association (Neca), which represents most of the nation’s local telephone companies. The plan’s key features include the following; ■ Rates for dial-up, long-distance service would be reduced 2% to 3%. ■ Pending tariffs covering switched local access services would become effective today, and pending tariffs for special access — local pri¬ vate lines — would become effective “as soon as possible.” ■ AT&T would be allowed to in¬ crease its private-line rates 5% to 10% and its rates for 800 service 5% to 7%. ■ Local exchange carriers would be allowed to retain their existing 12.75% rate of return, subject to later adjustment. The Neca proposal contains “ele¬ ments that could ameliorate, in part, the problems that the pending access tariffs would create,” AT&T said, but “it is evident that these changes could not restore AT&T’s earnings to reasonable levels.” The International Communica¬ tions Association (ICA), whose mem¬ bers include many of the nation’s largest corporate communications us¬ ers, charged that pending access tar¬ iffs contain a “windfall” worth “as much as $2 billion” to the exchange carriers. Half comes from the allegedly ex¬ cessive 12.75% rate of return that lo¬ cal carriers are currently allowed to earn on the circuits, switches and other facilities they use for local ac¬ cess service; the other half comes from assigning excessive costs — technically “revenue requirements” — to these services. The ICA said the Federal Commu¬ nications Commission should lower both. “Substantial reductions” would then be possible not only in the rates charged by exchange carriers, but also in the rates charged by AT&T Communications, Inc. and other long¬ distance carriers, the association said. The Ad Hoc Telecommunications Users Committee, another big-compa¬ ny communications user group, said that Neca seems to “imply that so long as AT&T’s financial position is improved, the switched access tariffs filed on March 15 and 19, 1984 should become effective.” This repre¬ sents “an outrageous disregard for the rights of users to pay only just and reasonable rates,” the group add¬ ed. 0 FCC guidelines hasten new private-line services WASHINGTON, D.C. — Guidelines aimed at bringing new private-line services to market more quickly were adopted by the Federal Communica¬ tions Commission last week. The commission also decided that a carrier offering a volume-sensitive private-line service must make simi¬ lar, lower volume versions of the same service available to avoid dis¬ criminating against some users. But the rates for each offering do not have to be based on fully distributed costs. The new guidelines for private¬ line services require carriers to file tariffs containing “simple and easy- to-uhderstand” rate structures, to group together similar service offer¬ ings and to use consistent definitions of rate elements and service func¬ tions. The commission also decided not to reconsider its earlier ruling that a telephone carrier offering network channel terminating equipment must do so through a separate subsidiary unless it first obtains a waiver from the commission. Such equipment pro¬ vides the terminal interface to Data- phone Digital Service and other wide¬ band digital communication services. Business surcharge gaining opposition in Congress WASHINGTON, D.C. — Opposi¬ tion to the monthly surcharge of $6/ line on business communications us¬ ers, scheduled to begin June 13, be¬ gan building in Congress last week. A recommendation calling on the Federal Communications Commission to defer the surcharge until June 30, 1985 was circulated among members of the Senate. It was drafted by Sens. David H. Pryor (D-Ark.) and Bob Has¬ ten (R-Wis.). A few days before the Senate rec¬ ommendation surfaced, 175 members of the House of the Representatives sent a letter to FCC Chairman Mark Fowler asking for deferral of the sur¬ charge until June 30, 1985. The letter was drafted by Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Larry Craig (R-Idaho). “It is clear,” Wyden said, “that even if the surcharge reduces long-distance rates, only a few businessmen will benefit; for the vast majority, the vast bulk of their communication is local.” FCC ruling on free telex helps some, hinders others WASHINGTON, D.C. — Letting prospective telex customers use ter¬ minals free of charge for three months is legitimate, but requiring a user to give a carrier all or some of his telex transmission business in ex¬ change for a free terminal is illegal. That’s the gist of a ruling made early this month by the Federal Com¬ munications Commission’s Common Carrier Bureau. As a result, TRT Telecommunications Corp. can con¬ tinue to offer three-month free trials of its telex service. But Western Union International, Inc. and RCA Global Communications, Inc. must amend their offers, which require the user to guarantee the carrier a specified volume of telex business. Such “tying” arrangements, the bureau explained, enable the carrier to cross-subsidize its costs of supply¬ ing terminals with revenue derived from transmission activities, which violates the Record Carrier Competi¬ tion Act of 1981 and subsequent com¬ mission orders. Justice believes FCC can loosen hold on AT&T WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Jus¬ tice Department believes Federal Communications Commission regula¬ tion of AT&T’s rates and facilities can^ be lessened without increasing the carrier’s ability to disadvantage its customers or competitors. In a comment submitted to the commission early this month, the de¬ partment said FCC rules requiring AT&T to obtain prior commission ap¬ proval for new services and to submit extensive cost-support information allow “competitors to stifle innova¬ tion and use the regulatory process for competitive gain.” A better approach. Justice said, would be to let the new services be¬ gin and to monitor them afterward. The department advocated a simi¬ lar approach to rates. It recommend¬ ed that the commission let tariffs be filed without cost-support informa¬ tion and make them effective 14 days later, subject to challenge by any par¬ ty who can show that a tariff is un¬ lawful or that “the harm from imple¬ menting the tariff outweighs the harm based on the unavailability of the service at the tariffed rates.” Rep. Dingell to USTA: Shift interstate costs to local users WASHINGTON, D.C. — Shifting costs from interstate to local commu¬ nications users is a better way of ad¬ dressing the long-distance bypass problem than the Federal Communi¬ cations Commission’s approach, which involves imposing an access surcharge on all users of local ex¬ change facilities. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee, told a meeting here this month of the U.S. Telephone Association. Dingell suggested reducing “the amount of joint and common fixed costs allocated to the interstate juris¬ diction from its current level of ap¬ proximately 25%. ” * 1 yr. lease $45 /mo*.

The industry observers also claimed that banks have a natural advantage over their competitors in the home banking battle. “We do have the customers already,” noted Charles S. Forbes, vice-president of the electronic banking division at Chemical Bank in New York. Joining Forbes in discussing the future of video banking was Arthur Hill, director of client services for CSP International, who predicted that the number of U.S. home com¬ puters will rise from 10 million at the end of 1984 to 60 million in 1990. But since communications devices are key to services such as home banking, it will be equally important that the proliferation of modems for those computers rises from 5% this year to 20% by the end of the decade, he added. Hill emphasized that while con¬ sumers will not buy personal comput¬ ers just for video banking, video banking could giye a person one more reason for buying a computer or one more use for an already owned com¬ puter. Speeding the’spread of home bank¬ ing, according to Hill, is the agree¬ ment of manufacturers to standard¬ ize videotex communications — the North American Presentation-Level Protocol Standard. Further fueling this movement is the likelihood that modem prices will drop and that mo¬ dems will be built into home comput¬ ers. According to Hill, one of the incen¬ tives for banks to move into electron¬ ic banking is reduced costs. It now costs $1.20 for a single bank teller transaction; Hill said that can be slashed to 18 cents for an automated teller machine (ATM) transaction once ATM transactions increase. Hill and Forbes predicted that a vi¬ tal part of video banking will be small business video banking, a ser¬ vice that Forbes said Chemicjil Bank plans to test in conjunction with its 5,000-user Pronto home banking sys¬ tem. Chemical Bank charges home us¬ ers $12 per month for the right to use personal , computers to pay bills, check account balances and do other basic banking electronically . Those who will be competing with banks for the video banking dollar in¬ clude current information providers such as Knight-Ridder Co., ojjerators of a test videotex project; communi¬ cations organizations such as AT&T; hardware manufacturers; data pro^ cessing companies such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc.; retailers such as Sears Roebuck & Co.; and finan¬ cial service companies such as Shear- son/ American Express, Inc. But the advantage that banks hold is that banks have established multiple rela¬ tionships with their customers, as opposed to the single-faceted rela¬ tionships bn which competitors have focused, such as charge cards, Forbes said. Accord reached on hacking bill ALBANY, N.Y. — New York’s at¬ torney general expects the Empire State to become the 21st state in the union to make hacking a crime when a bipartisan bill is passed later this legislative session. Attorney General Robert B. Abrams was joined by Brooklyn As¬ semblyman Melvin H. Miller, a Demo¬ crat, and State Sen. Ronald B. Staf¬ ford, a Republican from Plattsburgh, in announcing bipartisan accord on legislation making it a crime to break into computer systems via remote ac¬ cess. “The computer is a fact of .life in the ’80s, and it has created a whole new area of crime. This bill is a very important weapon for prosecutors and the public,” Abrams told report¬ ers in announcing the accord. Passage of the bill is considered certain; Miller and Stafford chair the Codes Committees in the two houses of the New York legislature. No com¬ puter crime bill could have hoped to get out of committee without their support. If signed by Gov. Mario Cuomo, the law would make it a felony to break into computer memories and change or ruin the data contained therein. Under the bill, a felony conviction would be punishable by up to four years in prison and a fine of $6,000. New York State currently has no law prohibiting outsiders from breaking into computers through phone lines and remote terminals. Twenty other states have already passed laws to put a stop to hacking.

The key to marketing such net¬ works is not savings for an institu¬ tion or a customer, but convenience, stressed Phillip A. Parker, president of First Virginia Services, Inc., owner of the Network Exchange in the Washington, D.C., area. “(POS] can provide convenience and should be marketed that way,” Parker said, noting that computerized POS and ATM services allow residents of Washington, D.C., Maryland and Vir- rginia to shop and bank in the sur- roimding jurisdictions, which previ¬ ously had been impossible. Banks must cut prices on electron¬ ic services at the early stages to help “create an environment that encour- Arrests slow in export case BOSTON — Only one . arrest has been made so far in the case of the seven businessmen and four firms in¬ dicted by a federal grand Jury here for allegedly shipping millions of dol¬ lars worth of sophisticated comput¬ ers and equipment to the Soviet Union and East Germany in 1981 and 1982. Leslie Klein, owner of the Canadi¬ an firm Eurodata, Inc., was released on $1.26 million bail after his arrest at Miami International Airport earli¬ er this month. Klein claimed the in¬ dictment is faulty for charging him with, among other things, failure to obtain a re-export authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce be¬ fore shipping U.S.-made computer equipment from Canada to European nations. “You don’t need a re-export li¬ cense when you ship to West Germa¬ ny from Canada,” Klein said in a tele¬ phone interview last week- The indictment alleges that the computer hardware, most of it from Hewlett-Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp., was shipped from the U.S. to Canada, the only nation to which such equipment can travel without a U.S. export license, and from there to West Germany and Switzerland. It was then allegedly shipped on to East Germany and the Soviet Union [CW, April 9). The two Americans charged in the indictment remain at large. They are Albert C. Beeson Jr.,, vice-president and contract, administrator of MLPI Systems, Inc. of Phoenix, and R. Paul Boucher, owner of Young Sales and Service, Inc. of Nashua, N.H. Also named in the indictment are the two Europeans, Dieter Enderlein and Fred Schiavo. ages use of the cards,” Parker said. But, he added, “If you think you are going to get into [POS] to save money, forget it.” Speaking with Parker, Hugh J. Barrett, senior vice-president of First City Bank Corp. of Texas, Inc., added that the proliferation of electronic services' Will eventually bring down banks’ costs to a point of economic returns. The speakers noted that a key issue to be decided in establish¬ ing networks is how costs are to be split among the bank that issues a debit or credit card, the merchant and the merchant’s own bank. They agreed that, in the end, the customer will foot the bill. However, the current question for banks is not whether they will share their ATM or POS systems, but with whom. It is unclear whether POS is accelerating awareness of the shar¬ ing issue or whether the interest in POS is a result of ATM sharing, Bar¬ rett noted. The ATM environment is much more forgiving than POS, because if an ATM customer finds a terminal not working, he can move to another terminal; with POS, a merchant can¬ not afford to let a customer leave the store if the network is down, Barrett warned. Barrett suggested that the ideal network for most institutions would be designed along the lines of the one in which his bank participates, the Pulse system. He said that when ATMs were growing in popularity, Texas passed a law requiring banks with ATMs to enter sharing agree¬ ments. Both speakers noted that ATM proliferation is nearing the satura¬ tion point, where any degree of cus¬ tomer use will not pay for the ATM equipment and communications lines. But they claimed that POS is unlikely to reach such a point be¬ cause such a high percentage of mer¬ chants already use electronic cash registers, which can make the transi¬ tion to POS easier.
