        "text": "The Lakers’ consolation prize after losing in the Dwight Howard sweepstakes set foot Tuesday into the team’s practice facility, oozing enthusiasm on everything about purple and gold.\n\nVeteran center Chris Kaman gushed that Mike D’Antoni’s offense centers on pick-and-rolls at a fluid tempo. Kaman expressed excitement about playing with Kobe Bryant and offered no preference as to whether he will start or come off the bench.\n\nFor all the talent the Lakers lost in Howard going to the Houston Rockets, there is a chance Kaman’s versatility in the post and team mindset could mitigate Howard’s void and eliminate the drama surrounding his lone season with the Lakers.\n\n“I’m here to do a job. Whatever it is, I’ll do it. It just depends on whatever the coach needs me to do is where I’ll be at,” Kaman said. “I’m confident I’ll get along with coach and have a good relationship.”\n\nHoward had a frustrating time in his lone season with the Lakers beyond nursing back and shoulder injuries. He wished D’Antoni’s offense featured more post-ups than pick-and-roll plays. Howard also didn’t respond well to Bryant’s demanding leadership style.\n\nKaman suggested those issues won’t bother him.\n\nHe sounded intrigued about playing with Bryant after spending most of his career playing as a crosstown rival. Kaman, 31, spent eight of his first 10 NBA seasons with the Clippers (2003-11) before being traded to New Orleans as part of the Chris Paul deal.\n\n“You always hear a lot about how hard he works and stuff like that. I’m just interested to see what it is,” Kaman said. “Everybody knows his mentality is different than most players, and that’s why he is where he’s at.”\n\nKaman also sounded unconcerned about how he will mesh with Pau Gasol. He and Howard didn’t consistently co-exist partly because of persistent injuries and D’Antoni’s preference for small ball.\n\n“Coach D’Antoni’s offense is a little bit different than most coaches. I like his style,” Kaman said. “They have a lot of up-and-down up tempo, a lot of Steve Nash pick and rolls.\n\n“I think the game is changing and the game is evolving into a pick-and-roll game and a face-up game.”\n\nHence, Kaman hardly hesitated in joining the Lakers on a one-year deal at the mini mid-level exception of $3.2 million after playing last season for the Dallas Mavericks for $8 million.\n\n“There wasn’t a ton of options,” Kaman said. “Waiting for Dwight to make his decision jammed things up a little bit for the big guys. For me, I thought it was a comfortable fit.”\n\nStill, it’s a tall order for the Lakers to make a significant playoff run next season, let alone win their 17th NBA championship.\n\nBryant remains sidelined with a torn left Achilles tendon and isn’t expected to return until either November or December. The jury remains undecided on whether Nash and Gasol can fully recover from their respective hamstring and knee injuries. They’ll be without Metta World Peace, who was waived last week through the amnesty provision in a move that saves the Lakers $15 million in luxury taxes.\n\nThe Lakers added young talent in former USC product Nick Young, four-year swingman Wes Johnson and former Laker Jordan Farmar (once they negotiate a buyout with his Turkish team).\n\nHow far can the Lakers go next season?\n\n“That’s a hard question to answer,” Kaman said. “I don’t think the team is complete and I think you get a better feel for that once Kobe gets back.”\n\nKaman also will face adjustments.\n\nFirst, he must find a place to live after selling his Manhattan Beach residence a week and a half before joining the Lakers.\n\n“If anybody knows a rental, let me know. South Bay please,” Kaman said, drawing laughs from reporters. “I’ll probably just find a spot to rent. I have two dogs. It makes it difficult sometimes for people to let me use their house.”\n\nKaman also sounded eager to improve from last season with Dallas, where he averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in a career-low 20.7 minutes. After the Clippers drafted him sixth overall in 2003, Kaman averaged a career-high 18.5 points and 9.6 rebounds and appeared in his lone All-Star game in 2010.\n\nKaman said he’s “confident” he could return to that level, but also sounded mindful about playing unselfishly in a contract season.\n\n“It’s not easy. You have that one-year situation and you’re stressed if you don’t play well and get hurt,” Kaman said. “You don’t want to force anything and do too much. The best part is not having to think about it and go out there and play.”\n\nHis wife forced Kaman to trim his beard after he spent the past five months sporting a thick one, a ritual the Mavericks followed in their quest to finish with a .500 record. Kaman poked fun at his “white tan” after spending recent weeks vacationing in Hawaii. He deadpanned his newly adorned No. 9 jersey had “zero significance” other than wanting a single-digit number.\n\n“I’m excited for this new opportunity with the Lakers,” Kaman said. “There’s a lot of changes being made around here. Hopefully everything works out for the best for the Lakers and everybody involved.”\n\nCREDIT HERE Chatter goes here in this space Officium quodis repuda voloruptatis excersp eliquam am"
