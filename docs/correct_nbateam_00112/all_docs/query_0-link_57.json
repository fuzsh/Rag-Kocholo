        "text": "Former Central Michigan player Chris Kaman has received German citizenship and will team up with Dirk Nowitzki for Germany at an Olympic qualifying tournament later this month.\n\nKaman, whose great-grandparents were German, averaged 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds last season with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe 7-foot Kaman will add size to a German team seeking to qualify for its first Olympics since the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\nThe German team is practicing at home for a warmup tournament before it travels to Greece for the July 14-20 qualifying event in Athens. Coach Dirk Bauermann says Kaman is a significant addition."
