Chris Kaman agrees to contract with Los Angeles Lakers

The Los Angeles Lakers have found their new center.

Veteran free agent Chris Kaman, who spent eight seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers, tweeted Monday that he had reached an agreement to join the Lakers. Kaman played last season for the Dallas Mavericks after a year with the New Orleans Hornets. The Los Angeles Times reported the deal was for one season.

Kaman has career averages of 11.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.4 blocks a game, so he won't replace all of Dwight Howard's production. But he has a long-held reputation as a strong post player and even reached the 2010 All-Star Game in his penultimate season with the Clippers.

The Lakers don't need to start Kaman, as 7-footer Pau Gasol may be a more natural center than power forward at this point in his career. But expect Kaman to play with Gasol a lot either way. The Lakers only have nine players under contract and lack salary cap space, so how they fill out the rest of their roster will determine how Kaman plays.

Kaman may be most known for his hair, be it his long, blond locks with the Clippers or his bushy beard with the Mavericks. He was the No. 6 pick in the historic 2003 NBA draft, immediately following Carmelo Anthony (No. 3), Chris Bosh (No. 4) and Dwyane Wade (No. 5). The Central Michigan product is 31 years old.
