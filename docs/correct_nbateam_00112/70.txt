According to Yahoo! Sports, Chris Kaman is one of the free agents that the Los Angeles Lakers are considering picking up off the scrap heap this summer: “Several other teams have expressed interest in Kaman, including Golden State, Atlanta, Sacramento and New York, sources said. Discussions are still in the formative stages, but Kaman has a reputation as a hard-working, dependable 7-footer who can fill a needed role. Kaman played his first eight NBA seasons for the Los Angeles Clippers, and a return to Southern California to join the Lakers has strong appeal to him, a league source said. Kaman, 31, averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in 20 minutes a game for the Dallas Mavericks in 2012-’13.”
