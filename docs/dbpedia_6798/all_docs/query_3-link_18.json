        "text": "Dream Lover\n\nLouise Glass\n\nIndependently Published (2023)\n\nISBN: 979-8399566924\n\nLouise Glass is a genre-bending novelist, dollhouse enthusiast, interior designer, and wildlife photographer from Demarest NJ. While working as a designer Louise freelanced in magazines and now enjoys creating lifelike characters that resonate with the readers. Louise focuses on blending the lines between contemporary, literary, and paranormal romance genres. Louise is a psychic empath with an interest in the afterlife which helps her write her novels.\n\nHi Louise, welcome to Reader Views! What is Dream Lover about and what was your inspiration behind the book?\n\nDream Lover follows the story of three diverse best friends who share an unbreakable bond. Ali discovers her psychic abilities and saves Lizzie from certain death, opening a portal to the supernatural world. This multi-genre paranormal romance is packed with humor and dark subjects, making it a must-read for anyone who loves a thrilling story about the power of female bonding. Dream Lover is a multi-genre and paranormal romance with some dark subjects and much humor.\n\n“I draw inspiration from my own life. I used to work as an interior designer, but I had to put that career on hold when I started writing this series. As a clairvoyant psychic empath, I took my own experiences and conducted extensive research to create my work. I have always been fascinated by New Age Sciences and the paranormal, even before my abilities became apparent. Being a romantic at heart, I wanted to give my characters Ali, Lizzie, and Suzanne soulmates, just like my husband is mine. If you’re fortunate enough, you’ll also find your soulmate.\n\nIn writing the Dream Lover series, I have come to realize the immense impact of fate and destiny in our lives. It is fascinating how ideas come and go, and through countless rewrites, the story takes shape to become exactly what I envisioned. The epilogue was a turning point for me, as it seemed to flow effortlessly, paving the way for the second book in the series, Arianna’s Story.\n\nYour characters, Ali, Lizzie, and Suzanne, have very distinct personalities and supernatural challenges. How did you develop these characters and decide on their specific traits and experiences?\n\n“I based one of my characters, Ali the psychic interior designer, on my own life. Although the character is almost biographical, I had a smaller bird and never married another psychic with a billion dollars. Lizzie, on the other hand, is a combination of my friends from over the years. I wanted Lizzie to be a redhead with freckles, who can eat as much as she likes without gaining weight. Yes, this book has fantasy in it, but don’t we all need some in our lives?\n\nLizzie and Suzanne are both merchandise buyers for Bloomingdales. After college, I spent a few happy years as a buyer in NYC, and that experience helped me in writing these characters. It is said that we should write what we know, and that holds true for me to some extent. Human beings are complex creatures, and Lizzie has an outgoing personality and resembles a young Nicole Kidman. However, I decided to make her the insecure one, not realizing her own talent and focusing on her negatives, such as her height, thinness, and flat chest. She was an asset at her profession, but she felt Ali was the better decorator between the two. Suzanne, on the other hand, was purely from my imagination. She is a young woman who loves vintage designer clothes and is looking for Mr. Right. But living in the big city makes it harder for her to find him. Suzanne’s downfall was that she was too trusting, and I got that trait from someone close to me. In the book, Suzanne goes through a dark period and experiences the paranormal, which we should not learn about for many years. However, in my books, unless a character is truly evil, I try to give them a silver lining.”\n\nThe character of Fred the cockatoo is quite unique and memorable. How did you come up with his character, and why did you decide to make him so central to the story?\n\nI had the joy of owning a delightful and energetic parrot. We got him from a breeder when he was young, forging an unbreakable bond. I named my little guy Fred after the character from the old television series Baretta. Tony Baretta’s cockatoo was a hoot, and I decided if I ever had another large bird, it would be a Sulfur-Crested Cockatoo.\n\nFred and I shared many happy moments, even showering together. He was a brilliant bird, and in some ways, he was even more intelligent than a dog.\n\nAs a bird enthusiast, I spent many hours reading books and articles about parrots and cockatoos, learning everything I could to ensure that Fred had the best possible life in captivity.\n\nI made sure that Fred had a spacious aviary to call home and let him fly free throughout the house to a great degree. I wanted his life to resemble the wild birds to some degree, and the years we spent together are memories that I put into Dream Lover.\n\nAli’s Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo used to land on her shoulder, and Fred landed on mine. Art imitates life.\n\nDespite my best efforts, Fred did not live to be an ancient parrot, and I miss his amusing antics and the affection he bestowed on me and my family. I felt compelled to include him in my book, and quickly, he became a fan favorite. Messages kept coming to include more Fred the Cockatoo in the next installment of the Dream Lover series.\n\nFred’s obsession with Cheez Doodles is a delightful detail. Are there any real-life inspirations behind such unique character quirks?\n\nOne day, we had a guest over who was snacking on some Cheez Doodles, and Fred squawked and made a huge fuss wanting to eat the cheese puffs. Although I found it quite amusing, I couldn’t let him have any, as I didn’t want to compromise his health. My avian vet suggested that feeding him a few occasionally would be safe, but I decided against it. So, I asked my guest not to bring Cheez Doodles again, as I wouldn’t want to go through another temper tantrum again,\n\nThe novel is praised for its witty dialogue and the strong bond of friendship among the three women. How important was it for you to showcase female friendship in your story?\n\nFemale friendship has always been of utmost importance to me, especially when the paranormal world is the backdrop. I have always had girlfriends and have found that you can confide in them things that you may not even tell your husband. Women need friends just as much as they need air to breathe, and based on the reviews on Amazon, I believe I have accomplished that goal. I would be lost without my closest friends and I am grateful for them every day.\n\nDream Lover explores the theme of the afterlife merging with the physical realm. Can you share what research or influences guided your portrayal of this concept?\n\nAs I mentioned I am a clairvoyant psychic empath, but I also have contacted the other side, had ghostly visits, and astral projected. I have a guardian angel who taught me how to control my paranormal abilities and help ground myself after astral projecting and much more. I have had communications with some loved ones in the afterlife and I’m relieved our souls live on but for me, it’s a frightening place. We lose our physical bodies and are as I explain in Dream Lover and subsequent books, disembodied souls. Pure energy with our memories intact but life as we knew it in the physical realm is gone. We can make ourselves look however we want and at any age we prefer, but it is only an illusion. When one of my characters dies and experiences ‘life’ there she cannot handle it and luckily, she gets to return to life. Lastly, I have astral projected and ‘seen’ the afterlife and it looked beautiful, but learning it was an illusion was disconcerting.\n\nGhosts wishing to become human again is a fascinating concept. How do you see the relationship between humans and the supernatural in your universe?\n\nThe reason I came up with that idea of ghosts returning to life is because it is unfathomable to me to have to spend eternity as a disembodied soul, pure energy. Yes, some souls get another chance and reincarnate starting life anew in another body, but losing most of their memories if any are buried in the subconscious. I write fiction so when I finished book two in the Dream Lover Series, Arianna’s Story I was able to take past lives and reincarnation to a much higher level because I injected fantasy into the equation which is one of the perks of being a writer in the paranormal genre.\n\nAstral projection and near-death experiences are pivotal in your novel. What drew you to these specific paranormal phenomena?\n\nIt’s a simple concept: astral projection. I’ve personally experienced it, and I firmly believe that each of us has the potential to achieve it by allowing ourselves to fully relax and slow down our breathing. After a while we begin to feel weightless, as if we’re floating, and with practice, you float above your physical body, looking down at yourself.\n\nLet me share a true story: Many years ago, I was undergoing biofeedback treatment for pain management. During my third session, I had an extraordinary experience and astral projected for the first time. I felt no pain and the high of being weightless was unbelievable. It also enhanced my paranormal abilities. In fact, I’ve even shared my knowledge with a friend, guiding her through the process.\n\nWhile I’ve thankfully never encountered a near-death experience myself, I’ve communicated with loved ones in the afterlife who passed on. I have learned from them and knowing our minds and memories live on helps and is invaluable to my writing.\n\nThe narrative incorporates a sense of humor amidst its darker themes. How do you find the right balance between humor and the more serious elements of the plot?\n\n“I don’t have a set rule for this. Yesterday, while I was rewriting a chapter, the theme of the story turned dark, and to lighten up the mood, I used wacky pets. In my novel Dream Lover, I had my characters Ali and Lizzie joke about Lizzie’s corn on her foot, and they even named it Hubert. As there are so many negative things happening in our world, I try to find laughter in everyday life and see the absurd in things. This helps me stay sane, and my family also helps me look at the lighter side of things. It’s crucial to maintain a balance between the silly and serious elements when writing about murder or death. With each novel, I’m learning and getting better at my craft.\n\nDream Lover doesn’t shy away from dark themes, including assault. Why was it important for you to include these elements in your story?\n\nIncorporating an assault in my story was a necessary step for Suzanne’s character development. It brought the required darkness and sadness to the story, and I knew I had to persevere despite the emotional toll it took on me. As the story unfolds, readers will understand why the sociopath inflicted harm on Suzanne – it’s a crucial part of the plot. Writing it was emotionally draining, but I persevered. While some writers may be comfortable with writing about serial killers and multiple assaults, It is my belief that readers should be left with a sense of hope and optimism, rather than despair, and did my best to give that to Suzanne.\n\nHow do you handle the portrayal of sensitive topics like assault in a way that is respectful but also integral to the story?\n\nDue to the delicate nature of the assault, I minimized the graphic nature. The feedback I received was all positive. Knock wood! I have friends who are writers and draft novels about psychopathic killers who molest and torture women and I cannot deal with that. We all have to go to our inner drummer and mine likes to see a happy ending.\n\nThe romance in Dream Lover varies from sweet to realistic struggles. How do you balance the romantic elements with the supernatural aspects to keep the story cohesive?\n\nWriting romance brings me joy, but I also find delight in exploring the paranormal world. I have discovered that incorporating both genres comes naturally to me, and often, the supernatural unexpectedly plays a role in my writing. There are times when I become so absorbed in my writing that I go on a ‘writing binge’, typing nonstop for several minutes without even realizing what I am typing. The end result is usually a perfect fit for the story. I wonder if other writers experience this phenomenon.\n\nThe book explores deep, existential questions through its paranormal storyline. What do you hope readers take away from your exploration of life, death, and the afterlife?\n\nUpon completing Dream Lover, my aim was to inspire readers to believe that there is always hope and to learn how to deal with their problems. I tried to convey that it’s important to get rid of inner demons that can make one sad and insecure. Throughout the book, the character of Lizzie, who was a fan favorite, grew and matured, shedding most of her insecurities and finding the happiness she deserved by the end.\n\nThe process of ghosts and humans interacting and possibly merging worlds is intriguing. How do you approach creating the rules of this supernatural universe?\n\nThe beauty of writing paranormal and supernatural fiction is that there are NO rules. My imagination and knowledge of the New Age Sciences guided me as I wrote Dream Lover. I could not have written such a thorough book without my experiences. Dialogue is my most important tool when writing, and it helped me achieve a five-star rating and a gold medal from you.\n\nWith Dream Lover being part of a series, how do you envision the development of these characters and the overarching story in future books?\n\nI finished the new book in the “Dream Lover Series,” and Arianna’s Story picked up where Dream Lover ended at the epilogue. New York Times best-selling author Bob Tarte wrote in his review that my epilogue deserved five stars on its own. I had Jack and Lizzie grow a lot since the inception of Dream Lover and it helped to strengthen their relationship. People from Dream Lover are carried over to the story and many have a lot less to say as I introduced a lot of new characters in two different timelines of history.\n\nWe all undergo changes as we navigate through life, and one character in my writing goes through one of the most significant transformations I have ever written about. In my upcoming book, I am introducing LGBTQ characters because they are a part of life. One of the characters in Dream Lover is hiding in the closet and is eventually forced to confront her true identity. It was exciting to see the changes that occurred as this complex character, who is a narcissist, had to deal with her personality and her relationships with her daughter, husband, and girlfriend. In the third book and all future books, each character will experience growth, whether it is good or bad. This is because I strive to make my books as true to life as possible.\n\nThe epilogue suggests a hopeful perspective on loss and eternal connection. Can you elaborate on the significance of this ending for the series moving forward?\n\nI introduced Arianna, Suzanne’s guardian angel mid-way through Dream Lover. As I wrote about Arianna, I felt her innermost longings when she and Suzanne spoke together as sisters do. But in this case, one sister is alive and the other is dead in the book. Arianna is fascinated with everything in the human world as she watches over her twin sister through the ensuing years. Over time her yearning to become human is a problem she wrestles with and then a miracle happens. The epilogue pays homage to this young woman’s hopes and dreams and shows miracles can come true.\n\nReviewers have praised the rich and imaginative prose of your book. Can you discuss your writing process and how you develop such vivid storytelling?\n\nAs a writer, I don’t have any set process for creating my books. I believe that inspiration can come from anywhere and at any time. One day, I woke up with several stories in my head that I knew had to be written. That’s how the “Dream Lover Series” was born. It was an exciting time for me, and I felt like I was on a mission to bring these stories to life.\n\nThe first chapter of each book is always the most challenging to write. I can spend days working on it and then rewrite it countless times, but I don’t let that discourage me. I find that ideas come to me as I write, and when I come across something new, I jot it down so that I don’t forget. I also read my dialogue aloud to make it sound as realistic as possible. I believe that this helps me to better understand my characters and give them a voice that readers can connect with.\n\nI am fortunate to be one of those people born to be a writer. Dream Lover was my debut book, and I’m proud of what I accomplished with it. But I can honestly say that book two, Arianna’s Story, is much better and has brought me more joy than I ever imagined possible. I am currently rewriting it, and I can’t wait for readers to experience it for themselves.\n\nYour ability to juggle multiple storylines has been commended. What challenges do you face in weaving together various plot threads, and how do you ensure each is given adequate attention?\n\nArianna’s Story takes readers on a journey through two timelines and introduces a diverse group of characters. To write a successful book, it is essential to focus on character development, pay attention to detail, and do much research. I am in rewrites and still doing research. It is an ongoing task for me but worth it.\n\nI have revised the manuscript multiple times. I have made changes, moved chapters, and deleted content while retaining the most minute detail.\n\nMy books feature lovable animal characters, including Fred the cockatoo and Marlon the Labrador Retriever, who plays a central role in book two. However, there is also an obnoxious new canine character introduced that brings much needed humor to the book.\n\nWhile writing book two, I found the writing flowed easier, despite having more characters and covering more time periods. My writing has improved over time and my attention to detail.\n\nArianna’s Story is a time travel novel that spans thousands of years, with a focus on Hollywood 1940s and 2012 New York City. I did extensive research to ensure accuracy and I am still doing research and enjoying every moment. I’m especially excited because I uncovered a Hollywood mystery that involves the mafia and two big screen actors who had a romantic love affair that had to be kept hidden until the actor’s death. These two characters are central to Arianna’s Story.\n\nSo, what’s next for you? Do you have another project in the works? If so, what can you tell us about it?\n\nI have been working on the rewrite of Arianna’s Story, and I’m thrilled to say that I have created a book trailer that I’m very proud of. I manage all aspects of the book except formatting, which I leave to the experts. As soon as my second book is available on Amazon and I have two books to promote, I will begin working on the third book in the “Dream Lover Series.” In this book, I plan to address some significant unanswered questions and tie up loose ends as much as possible. I have some new ideas for book three and will follow my inner muse to see where it takes me. If my readers are happy, that makes my day.\n\nCONNECT WITH LOUISE GLASS!"
