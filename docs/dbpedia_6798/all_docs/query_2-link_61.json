        "text": "For therapists, life coaches, counselors, educators, clergy, trainers, and other mental health and well-being professionals, the Gottman Method is an approach to couples therapy that includes a thorough assessment of the couple’s relationship, and integrates research-based interventions based on the Sound Relationship House Theory. The goals of Gottman Method Couples Therapy are to disarm conflicting verbal communication, increase intimacy, respect, and affection, remove barriers that create a feeling of stagnancy, and create a heightened sense of empathy and understanding within the context of the relationship.\n\nLearn more about Gottman Method Couples Therapy here. Most of our CE courses and certification in Gottman Method Couples Therapy are also relevant in non-clinical settings for other professionals who work with couples.\n\nClick here to sign up to our Gottman Pro Newsletter for clinical professionals and receive updates on trainings, new courses, professional opportunities, and resources to help you dig deeper into Gottman Method Couples Therapy.\n\nSee The Gottman Method in action and learn ways to apply it with your couples in practice with the Art and Science of Love.\n\nSuccessful couples and those who want to be successful use the Gottman Method. The real magic happens when you don’t just understand our concepts, but actively apply them to everyday life—turning insights into action. At the end of the day, every couple is made up of two humans in a relationship, shaped by the past, wounds, dreams, beliefs and aspirations. When the relationship struggles, it impacts everything. But it doesn’t have to stay that way.\n\nDr. John Gottman and Dr. Julie Gottman have studied every aspect of human relationships and discovered the secrets to being successful in love and long term partnerships. Those secrets have been transformed into the Gottman Method, readily available in all our products today. We recommend taking the time to truly master and implement these methods for a thriving relationship.\n\nTo illustrate, let’s briefly look at one of our many concepts, Love Maps. It goes beyond simple knowledge like “What’s your favorite movie?” to provide a rich exploration path. You’ll understand not just your partner’s preferences, but their hopes, dreams, vulnerabilities—creating a detailed map of their inner world. You’ll know exactly what bagel to surprise them with, what holding their hand means when they are sick, and what their hopes are for the future.\n\nThese insights will help you add positivity to your daily interactions, reduce conflicts, and create a closer bond. Love Maps is just one tool in a vast array of concepts we explore and teach you to apply in the Gottman Method."
