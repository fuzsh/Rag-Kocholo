        "text": "Whitfield Harrington is a servant of God and anointed minister, teacher, mentor, author, musician, and entrepreneur. He resides in Chicago, Illinois and has been in ministry for over 22 years.\n\nMinister Whitfield has a strong anointing in translating biblical principles in spiritual warfare and dream interpretation into everyday language that enables Christians at all levels to comprehend.\n\nMinister Whitfield has authored a number of compelling books, including, Get To The Point with Prayer Points: Why Some Prayers Get Answered and Others Don’t and 7 Steps To Interpret Your Dreams: Journey Into the World of Your Dreams.\n\nHe is a selfless visionary committed to helping the children of God understand their purpose and inherited power in Jesus Christ.\n\nAs a faithful man of God, Minister Whitfield loves to help people grow in the Lord.\n\nHe understands that we are living in a critical time in the Kingdom of God and believes for growth that Christians need to “stop playing and start praying”. By focusing on engaging with God in prayer and through the application of biblical principles, Minister Whitfield helps believers maximize their full potential in the Kingdom.\n\nHe values empowering the children of God to directly hear from God for themselves.\n\nThere are many reasons why prayers may not be answered, but most commonly, people simply don’t know how to pray effectively.\n\nWhen Jesus taught his disciples how to pray, He explained to them that there was a right way and a wrong way to pray.\n\nAre you praying the right way or the wrong way? What is the difference? This book will unlock and explain the mysteries of prayer, and provide you with revelations from the word of God which will empower you to pray the way Jesus taught his disciples."
