        "text": "Ashley Anderson\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI’m from Arlington Texas and come from a fairly large family of four girls. Growing up, it was pretty easy to get lost in the mix, and things were no different when I first arrived to college at Stanford University. Nonetheless, after my freshman year, I managed to find my place and graduated with a BA in International Relations. I then went to Boston to get my graduate degree at Harvard, and arrived at UNC shortly after graduation. My research spans a lot of topics in political science, but is mostly concentrated on authoritarian politics and the Middle East. Outside of work, I love to lift weights, explore new restaurants in the Triangle, and watch tv. One of my greatest ambitions in life is to write my own TV show (tentatively titled “Ladykillers”) and see it on ABC primetime.\n\nSusan Bickford\n\nAssociate Professor, Associate Chair\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI grew up in a small town in central Ohio, and was the first of my family to go to college. I went to a small women’s college, which was an empowering experience, and only possible because I got full financial aid. I went to the University of Minnesota for graduate school, and after getting my PhD there, I was hired at UNC. My work focuses on political theory, which is a subfield of political science that addresses ethical issues about power, justice, equality, and freedom. I also make a point to stay up on current scholarship about best practices for teaching and learning, and am happy to share information about that. I have a son who just transferred to UNC, and my husband is a political scientist at UNCG. I like to watch women’s sports, and read science fiction novels when I have time. I also have a dog who has been fondly described as “a lovable goofball” and “sweet, but not the brightest.”\n\nBenjamin Carpenter\n\nAcademic Coordinator\n\nUNC Learning Center\n\nI am the Chemistry Learning Specialist for the UNC Learning Center, where I work as an academic coach and facilitator of CHEMpossible. I was a graduate student at UNC and earned my Ph.D. in chemistry while helping to design curriculum for chemistry courses. In my role as an academic coach, I am equipped to help students improve in all areas of academic success: study strategies, time management, setting goals, etc. My course expertise and insight into chemistry would also allow me to advise and mentor students who are taking chemistry courses as part of their major.\n\nIvonne Chirino-Klevans\n\nClinical Assistant Professor\n\nKenan-Flagler Business School\n\nI am a former Assistant Dean of Executive Education at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, and founding member of Duke Corporate Education (DukeCE). I am a guest faculty at the International School of Management in Pari, and Assistant Clinical faculty in Organizational Behavior at the Kenan-Flagler business school. I am an expert in the use of Virtual Reality simulations for global business and skills development focusing on intercultural competence. I am the recipient of two awards for Serious Play and Campus Innovation in the use of Virtual Reality for Leadership. I am a consultant for major global organizations in the design, implementation and evaluation of leadership and high performing teams. My latest book is called “Cases on Global Leadership” focusing on leadership practices in global organizations. I have been the recipient of several teaching awards for my work in the classroom and mentoring students. I hold a PhD in Psychology, a Master’ in Psychology, a Master’s in Business Administration and my undergraduate degree is in Psychology. A former Pan-American games medalist in gymnasts and All-American in the same sport, I bring my expertise in sports to the classroom by designing high impact and transformative learning experiences aimed at developing leadership competencies in multicultural and global environments. I am fluent in English, French and Spanish.\n\nMark Crescenzi\n\nDistinguished Professor, Department Chair\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI grew up in California, living in the Bay Area (Silicon Valley) until going to UC Irvine for college. I have worked at UNC for nearly 25 years, with a focus on teaching and studying International Relations. My research specializes in Peace Science, a field dedicated to uncovering the causes and consequences of political conflict. One of my favorite classes to teach is POLI 150, which is the gateway to our International Relations courses. It is my chance to introduce our students to the global geo-political arena, and to open their worlds beyond North Carolina and the United States.\n\nEvan Feldman\n\nProfessor; Area Head of Brass, Wind and Percussion\n\nDepartment of Music\n\nI’m originally from New York, but have lived and taught in Iowa, Virginia, and, for the last 13 years, North Carolina. I’ve taught high school music, and most recently college wind ensembles (concert bands) and professional and amateur orchestras. I’m also involved in the music education program here at UNC, and a lot of what I do at an academic and professional level involves music education. If you’re interested in music or education or the intersection of the two, let’s chat! I’m “classically” trained, but I have an equal affinity for the pop/film/theater music side of things. I’m especially interested in incorporating multi-media into my concerts, which has allowed me to dabble a bit into video editing and finding creative ways to engage and teach audiences. These are the sorts of questions that make education a two-way street between teacher and student, so I’m really interested in connecting with anybody who wants to explore the same sorts of issues.\n\nVeronica Flaspoehler\n\nPresident\n\nCarolina Alumni\n\nI am the new President of Carolina Alumni, the alumni association of UNC Chapel Hill. Prior to coming to Carolina in July of 2023, I was a Banking Executive and worked at Wells Fargo for the past 15 years. I was a Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) Issues Management where I was responsible for leading the front-line issues control management program and developing an aggregated view of the risks across the Corporate & Investment Banking businesses, covering Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Markets, and International. Veronica supported these business lines with risk strategy, implementation, and execution to meet regulatory, corporate, and business risk management requirements and expectations. Through proactive coordination, my team delivered integrated risk strategy, producing an efficient and sustainable control environment and a culture of strong risk management.\n\nMy prior roles at the bank include serving as the Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer for the Latin America and Caribbean regions and leading efforts to build risk oversight programs covering regulatory compliance, operational risk and financial crimes. Additionally, I led and supported a number of change initiatives at the bank, spanning business lines and enterprise functions.\n\nI graduated from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor of Arts, double majoring in Economics and Public Policy with a minor in Entrepreneurship Studies. While at UNC, I served as the Class of 2008 Senior Class Vice President among other leadership roles and service organizations.\n\nBorn in Alajuela, Costa Rica, I grew up in Lincolnton, North Carolina. I have served on the Carolina Alumni Board of Directors, UNC Alumni Committee for Racial and Ethnic Diversity, UNC Board of Visitors, Carolina Latinx Center Advisory Board, and the UNC Young Alumni Leadership Council\n\nStephen Gent\n\nProfessor\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi, and went to college at the University of Mississippi (aka “Ole Miss”). As an undergraduate, I majored in political science and Spanish and participated in study abroad programs in Spain and Mexico. After six years of grad school in snowy upstate New York, I started teaching here at Carolina in 2005. My research and teaching focus on international relations and the study of peace and conflict. In my recent book, I explored how economic competition over energy resources and minerals can lead countries like Russia and China to pursue aggressive foreign policies. My husband and I live in Durham with our rescue dog, Maggie, and when I’m not working, I enjoy watching movies, reading, and traveling.\n\nWill Goldsmith\n\nTeaching Assistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Public Policy\n\nI was born and raised in Old Fort, North Carolina, graduating from McDowell High before heading to Yale for college (which was a disorienting experience for a small-town kid!). I returned to North Carolina to teach high school in Halifax County Schools, and then worked as a journalist in Virginia before getting a PhD in history. My research looks at education and economic development policy in North Carolina in order to understand how the state has (and hasn’t) changed since the Jim Crow era. My hobbies are few and far between as my spouse and I raise three young kids, but I love basketball and literature in addition to my professional interests in history and politics. As someone who felt a little lost in college, particularly the first few years, I enjoy talking to students about goal setting, time management, figuring out what really matters, and the adjustments coming from small towns.\n\nDavid Gotz\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nSchool of Information and Library Science\n\nI’m a 2nd generation American, born and raised in New Jersey before moving south when I started as an undergraduate at Georgia Tech. I have a BS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and earned my MS/PhD in Computer Science from UNC-Chapel Hill. I spent nearly a decade working in the tech industry at IBM in New York before moving my family back to Chapel Hill to join the UNC faculty as part of the School of Information and Library Science. In addition to teaching and my research as part of the Visual Analytics and Communication Lab, I help lead educational programs related to health informatics and data science. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors (from the beach to the mountains!), sports, and spending time with my wife and three children.\n\nJacquelyn Greene\n\nAssistant Professor of Public Law and Government\n\nSchool of Government\n\nI grew up in upstate NY and first came to Carolina as an undergraduate, knowing no one on campus. It wasn’t always easy, but I found ways to connect and thrive as part of the University community. My time here launched me to Harvard Law School and a career in state government, focused on juvenile justice policy. I was lucky to return to UNC as a professor at the School of Government where I teach, advise, and write about juvenile justice for court officials in NC. I also spend lots of time cheering on the Heels with my husband and kids. I welcome the opportunity to get to know you and to help you find your home and thrive at UNC.\n\nDana Griffin\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nSchool of Education\n\nI am a first generation college student from rural Virginia. I have a BA in English and a PhD in Counselor Education from The College of William and Mary and a MA in Counseling and College Student Development from Hampton University. Growing up in poverty, I truly believe in the power of education and how education can disrupt intergenerational poverty in low-income families. I study how school counselors can be influential in creating equitable educational access for low-income and Black students through using school-family-community partnerships. I’m really good at listening and I am always open to talking to students about anything – personal or professional – and just providing the support and encouragement needed. Outside of work, I love watching television (so much that I make watching TV a major assignment in one of my courses). I love listening to music and playing games (Spades is my jam). I have two kids – one at Duke (don’t hold that against me) and one in middle school in Durham Public Schools. I am a sports mom and often spend weekends on the road cheering on my son’s soccer and baseball teams. My husband is a high school math teacher, who coaches football and track. Fun fact about him: He played football at William and Mary with Mike Tomlin and Sean McDermott (current NFL coaches). I also have a cat named Mowgli.\n\nDeVetta Holman-Copeland\n\nResiliency and Student Support Programs Coordinator, Student Wellness\n\nUNC Student Affairs\n\nDr. D. has spear-headed several groups on campus such as SISTER TALK, P.E.A.C.E. and R.E.A.L.Talk with the Fellas. Her body of work emphasizes persistence, self-awareness, resiliency, a growth mindset and its relevance to personal agency both, in and out of the classroom. Dr. DeVetta is a two time alumnus of the University of North Carolina as an undergraduate, as well as, a graduate of the Gillings School of Global Public Health. She is an advocate of the Human Spirit and is committed to “meeting students where they are”. She received her Doctorate in Leadership Studies focusing on Education, Resiliency and Belongingness. DeVetta serves on several campus committees. She is the past recipient of the C. Knox Massey Award, Member of the Frank Porter Graham Honor Society and Inducted into the Order of the Golden Fleece. To give back to the community, Dr. D. serves as the Executive Camp Director for Global Health Connections, Inc., a residential Summer STEAM camp for under-served students in the eastern-most parts of North Carolina. She is married to E. Rick Copeland and is the proud mother of one son, Robert-Anthony Nash.\n\nKaneesha Johnson\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI was born and raised in the UK, where I completed high school and sixth form college (the equivalent of the last two years of high school in the US). My original dream was to run track and field, but that dream ended with an ankle injury. I then moved to New York, where I worked and took community college classes. I eventually transferred to Durham Tech and then finally to UNC-CH. I then attended Harvard for my doctoral studies. In July 2023, I returned to Carolina as a postdoctoral fellow in the Carolina Postdoctoral Program for Faculty Diversity. My research encompasses qualitative and quantitative political science research on racial disparities. I have published on the biased nature of the death penalty and inequalities within the criminal legal system. My dissertation examined the historical origins of punishment across social services in North Carolina. During my time at Carolina as an undergraduate, I was supported by people dedicated to making education more equitable. I am so excited to be able to continue that tradition.\n\nRoxana Boyd Keesler\n\nAssistant Director of Federal Affairs\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nI joined UNC’s Office of Federal Affairs in June 2019 after spending 6 years in Washington, DC at law/lobbying firms where I focused on higher education, healthcare, and technology policy. I’ve always enjoyed serving as a mentor to students, whether their interests lie in policy/politics or not. My passion for education and federal affairs stems from growing up in a family of educators and my experience working as a congressional intern. I grew up in Wilmington, NC and received my B.A. in Political Science from Davidson College (2013) where I was active in student government, orchestra, and club sports. In my free time, I enjoy getting outside with my dog Meli, exploring the area (I’m on a mission to try all the ice cream shops!), and volunteering with my church’s youth group.\n\nMary Kroeger\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI am from North Carolina and went to UNC for undergrad. As a first-generation college student, I’m so grateful for the wonderful mentorship I received throughout my time at UNC. I came back to join UNC’s Political Science department as an assistant professor in 2020. I research how bureaucrats and interest groups get their bills introduced into state legislatures. I love to hear about what students want to do with their lives and brainstorm how to get there. I like thinking about academic and non-academic pathways. My husband (we met at UNC) and I spend our time chasing our toddler!\n\nKalisha-Lourdy Lazare\n\nGraduate Student Coordinator\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI was born in New York City, and went to undergraduate and graduate school at Georgia State University, where I studied communications and served in leadership roles in the Nonprofit Leadership Alliance and the university’s student government. My graduate work focused on addressing digital credibility in Haitian government services. As a first generation Haitian American, I am passionate about helping other first generation Americans and immigrants navigate the process of successfully graduating from college and building a strong network of supporters. During my free time, I love to walk – seriously, you can often find me walking around campus during lunch. I also love reading – my current favorite genre is historical nonfiction.\n\nJosmell Pérez\n\nDirector\n\nCarolina Latinx Center\n\nI was born in Lima, Peru. I came to the US at the age of 6 with my parents and 2 brothers. I grew up in Northern New Jersey in a household with limited financial resources but an abundance of encouragement. We had to overcome some of the typical immigrant struggles, but we always could turn to family for support. As a first gen-college student, I am excited to support our Covenant Scholars! It is common to see my partner and I on campus with our two daughters. We love spending time on campus and exposing our girls to the rich community of Carolina.\n\nTyler Pratt\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI’m originally from Augusta, Georgia, and attended college at UGA (go dawgs!). My original career ambitions were to work in public service. After college, I got a master’s degree in international policy and spent a few years in Washington, DC working at the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State. Eventually, I decided to go back to school for my Ph.D, and I came to UNC in Fall 2023 after teaching at Yale for several years. My research focuses on how states can solve global problems through multilateral diplomacy, and how we can hold governments accountable for bad behavior. In my free time, I like to play with my kids, spend time outside, and talk about politics.\n\nJason Roberts\n\nProfessor\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI grew up in rural Alabama and was the first person in my family to attend college. I know what it is like to feel out of place or like you do not belong at a place like UNC. I have been a faculty member at UNC for 15 years and I teach and do research in American politics with a focus on elections and the U.S. Congress. I am also a member of the Orange County, NC Board of Elections and I really enjoy helping people navigate the voting process. In my free time I enjoy fishing, watching my daughters play soccer, cooking, watching college football, and attending Avett Brothers concerts.\n\nEmily Roscoe\n\nLegal and Policy Research Associate\n\nSchool of Government\n\nI am originally from Sanford, North Carolina, but have lived in Chapel Hill for 19 years. I have five degrees from UNC (BA, MPA, MSLS, JD, PhD), so I am a tried and true Tar Heel! I work as a legal and policy research associate at the School of Government. Previously, I taught in the School of Information Library Science (undergraduate and graduate students), in the School of Government (graduate students and public officials, particularly registers of deeds), and worked in the law library at the School of Law in reference, research, and public services. Although research can be daunting at times, my philosophy is that it is infinitely exciting. There is always something more to learn.\n\nElizabeth Sasser\n\nTeaching Assistant Professor, Interim Director of Experiential Education\n\nDepartment of Public Policy\n\nI was raised in Washington, DC, but wound my way through Durham, Beijing and then New York before finally settling here in Chapel Hill, where I’ve lived for 16 years. My career has also taken me on a bit of a journey, from advertising, into policymaking and then finally into teaching. All of this has led me to enjoy helping students find their own way through all of the often confusing options out there. My teaching and research interests include energy and environmental policy and US politics. Outside of school, my family and I enjoy traveling, both locally and more far afield.\n\nKarina Soni\n\nOutreach Projects Librarian\n\nUniversity Libraries\n\nI’m Karina, and I’m a librarian at UNC’s University Libraries. I am a first-generation American and a two-time Carolina graduate. Like you, I attended UNC as a Carolina Covenant scholar and can relate to some of the experiences you’re going through as you navigate college life. I enjoy mentoring students, sharing my experience, connecting them to resources at Carolina that can support their success. Outside of my professional life, I DJ in the local area (I got my start doing radio shows on the campus radio station WXYC), collect records, and enjoy spending as much time as I possibly can outside, preferably near a beach or body of water.\n\nMillie Tan\n\nUndergraduate Coordinator\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nI am currently the Undergraduate Coordinator for the Political Science Dept after a successful career in corporate executive marketing roles with significant global experience and in-market operating assignments in Asia and Europe. I am a first-generation college student, born and raised in NYC, and grew up in a Chinese immigrant household with illiterate parents in Chinese and English. I earned a BA from Skidmore College, an MA from Teachers College, Columbia University, and an MBA from The Tuck School, Dartmouth College. I am interested in supporting students through their college experience as well as to navigate the world beyond UNC, drawing not only on my career experiences but also my training as a career counselor. I am an avid traveler, having traveled to all seven continents, along with interests in cooking ethnic cuisine and hiking.\n\nGeetha Vaidyanathan\n\nTeaching Professor, Director\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nI am originally from India but I have lived in North Carolina for more than 30 years. I was the first in my family to go to college and I found it be a roller-coaster adventure. I have taken many turns during my educational journey (Natural Science, Math, Speech Pathology and Audiology, Accounting and finally Economics). I got my doctoral degree in Economics from the University of Kentucky. I am a Teaching Professor and I am currently the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Economics. I have participated in a similar mentoring program at UNC-Greensboro and I found it be a mutually beneficial experience. I like to interact with students and help them navigate the college path which can sometimes be complicated. During my free time, I like to hike in the trails in Chapel Hill."
