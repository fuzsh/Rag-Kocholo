        "text": "ATLANTA (WANF/Gray News) - The husband of a woman at the center of a 1999 Atlanta cold case is now behind bars.\n\nChristopher Wolfenbarger has been charged with murder in connection to the death of his wife, 21-year-old Melissa Wolfenbarger.\n\nAuthorities in Atlanta announced his arrest at an early Wednesday afternoon press conference.\n\nWolfenbarger was arrested on Tuesday. Police said he was taken into custody at his home in the Griffin area while hiding behind a dryer.\n\nMelissa Wolfenberger’s dismembered remains were found in black trash bags tossed on the side of the road in 1999.\n\nThe coroner positively identified the remains as Melissa Wolfenberger in 2003.\n\nAlthough years had since passed, the woman’s family never gave up on finding her killer.\n\n“We have finally made it and he’s in custody,” Norma Patton, the woman’s mother, said. “My last words to her were, ‘I love you, and you know where I am if you need me.’”\n\nAtlanta police did not disclose many details or say what the motive was, but they said they believed it was related to domestic violence.\n\n“It’s been a long wait. Twenty-five years, but finally, hopefully, we will get justice for Melissa. She didn’t deserve what she got,” Tina Patton, Melissa Wolfenbarger’s sister, said. “And I hope anybody who is in a domestic violence situation, please get out.”"
