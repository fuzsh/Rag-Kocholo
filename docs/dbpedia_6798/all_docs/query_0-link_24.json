        "text": "Certain mornings can seem exceptionally beautiful for no apparent reason. One morning many years ago, 18 months after my wife and I had moved to New York City from Dhaka, Bangladesh, my heart felt light. The sun had risen brilliantly, dispelling the gloom that had clouded the skies for days. Maybe I was feeling good because of this.\n\nFrom the bed, I peeked through the window of our Queens apartment into the trees of Captain Tilly Park and noticed a bird perched on a branch, its feathers ruffled by the wind. After a few moments, it flew away.\n\nAlthough getting up early is my habit, on that morning I felt like staying in bed a little longer. My wife, Fancy, got up, probably to go to the bathroom. Ever since we married, when we were in bed together, there was an invisible connection between us, even if we weren’t touching. And when one of us got out of bed, the other sensed it.\n\nWhen Fancy came back, she crept into her place, very slowly, like a cat. Usually, when she went to the bathroom, it didn’t take her so long, but on that day she must have been performing her morning prayers."
