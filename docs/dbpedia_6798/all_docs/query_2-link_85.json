        "text": "In this post, I thought it might be fun to detail my dreams in life.\n\nIt’s sort of a follow-up to another article on my site, in which I compiled a list of 100 life goals.\n\nThat one is intentionally quite impersonal. It’s simply full of ideas I hoped someone would find useful if they were looking for direction, purpose, and cool experiences to have!\n\nI wondered if writing my personal dreams might help you guys get to know me a bit better. I also find it quite inspiring to learn about other people’s goals, so maybe you will, too?\n\nEqually, from a selfish perspective, it’s always useful to write down your goals and share them with other people. It helps you commit to them!\n\nWith all that said, here are 40 of my dreams for the future.\n\nUpdated 3/7/24 with current ideas and what I’ve been able to achieve so far.\n\n1. To Work Online\n\nTechnically, this is one of my life dreams that I’m already doing!\n\nAnd I have no intention of stopping any time soon.\n\nThe internet provides an incredible opportunity to break away from the norm, be your own boss, and earn money on the go. I look forward to seeing if I can make it work long-term.\n\n2. Build a Business from Blogging (My Main Dream in Life)\n\nThis is my primary focus at the moment – and has been for years.\n\nI aim to make a living through writing, blogging, creating content, and running websites. It still feels like I’m at the start of this journey, and the industry has changed a lot.\n\nOf all my dreams in life, this one has been a slog. It turns out that making a successful website isn’t easy! However, I’m still keen to explore new avenues and make it work.\n\n3. To Be Financially Free\n\nThis, ultimately, is my biggest life goal.\n\nI’d love to get to a point of financial freedom. For me, that means earning enough each month that I don’t have to worry about what I spend.\n\nI don’t need to be a gazillionaire. But I don’t want money to be a cause of stress. I want to provide for my family, give to others, and bring to fruition everything I’d like to do in life that requires capital!\n\nIf this is also one of your dreams in life, you might like these money affirmations.\n\n4. Control My Time\n\nI also want to act like time is my main currency.\n\nYou can get more money. But you can’t get more time.\n\nThe fact it’s ticking steadily away with every moment is terrifying! But it motivates me, too.\n\nI want to take full control. Unless I’m doing something I’m passionate about, I don’t want others to dictate how I spend my time.\n\n5. To Earn Passive Income\n\nI think most people’s dream future involves earning a living through passive income!\n\nIt’s been a focus of mine for a while now. I still swap my time for money, but I’d love for that to change in the future.\n\nIt’s one reason I like blogging as a business model.\n\nAlthough it’s a huge time investment right now, it has the potential to earn money with minimal input. And, as I enjoy the process of writing and running them, it seems like a worthy investment.\n\n6. To Write a Book (High on My Dream List!)\n\nI’d love to write a book, but I’m still working out the details! I have no idea what it would be able, or even if it’d be a novel or non-fiction.\n\nI know how much time and effort is involved in writing them, so this might be a life dream I postpone until the future. Nevertheless, I’m determined to do it one day…\n\n7. To Read as Much as Possible\n\nThis is another very loose goal!\n\nIt’s a big one for me, though. I love reading, and think it’s an essential part of becoming a better writer. Given that I intend to write a book and make a business from blogging, that seems important!\n\nUnfortunately, I’m failing on this goal big time right now. I literally can’t remember the last time I sat down to read for pleasure. Something I need to work on…\n\n8. To Publish a Book\n\nIf I’m going to write books, then I’d quite like to have one published someday, too!\n\nIt would be cool to write them, whatever happens. Yet, if I’m honest, the thought of being a published author is definitely part of the appeal…\n\n9. To Build My Own House\n\nI’d say this is in my top three life dreams.\n\nI would have no idea where to even start, but I think about building my own house almost every day. I just love the idea of buying some land, designing the property I want to live in, and then actually building it!\n\nEither that or renovating one…\n\n10. To Invest in Property\n\nThis one feeds into my desire to earn passive income.\n\nI’m going to need to save up a lot before this ever happens. But investing in property seems like a good use of money. I also like the idea of being able to provide someone with an affordable home.\n\n11. To Get a Dog\n\nI am determined to have my own dog at some point!\n\nThere’s not a lot more to say on this one. I just adore dogs and think having one would be a one-way ticket to a happier life. Current target: German Shepherd.\n\n12. To Own, Travel, and Live in a Van\n\nVan life has appealed to me for years.\n\nIt’s the freedom and simplicity involved that I find so alluring. You’ve got a home on wheels, which means you’re not tied down to anything!\n\nYou can come and go as you please, wake up in spectacular places, and explore indefinitely.\n\nThis is one dream I’ve been lucky enough to make happen. I travelled around Australia in a van in 2020 and then converted one in England in 2022, which I still own with my girlfriend.\n\n13. To Travel the World\n\nI’ve done a reasonable amount of travelling now.\n\nBut it still doesn’t feel like enough! There are so many more adventures I’d like to have and so many other places I’d love to explore. I think travel will always be part of my life.\n\n14. To Start a Community\n\nWhen I first wrote this article, this dream revolved around building a house and living with other people in an actual community space.\n\nIt’s changed a bit since then.\n\nWhile that idea still appeals, I also like the thought of building an online community. There must be other people like me who want to travel the world, have adventures, find more fulfillment in life, and learn about themselves…\n\nMaybe I can build a community around it?\n\n15. To Help Others\n\nAs far as personal dreams go, this is a big one for me.\n\nI really want to make a positive difference in the world.\n\nMy life has been very self-involved over the last few years, and I can’t say I’m proud of it. I’d love to change that and devote my time to doing something good for others.\n\n16. To Work in Disaster Relief\n\nOne area I’ve thought seriously about is disaster relief.\n\nFor a long time, I’ve wondered whether I could earn enough passive income (or have enough saved up) to enable me to go places that need support and volunteer my time.\n\nIt’d combine two of my main goals: travel and helping people.\n\nI’ve done similar work in the past and loved every second. If my business plans don’t work out, I can imagine myself seeking ‘real’ employment in this area.\n\n17. To Contribute to Worthy Causes\n\nThis is another related goal.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t necessarily pertain to helping other people. It might be a political cause, an environmental issue, a charitable cause, and so on.\n\nI’d like to find a cause I’m passionate about and try to help.\n\n18. To Become a Leaf on a Tree\n\nBy this, I mean being part of something bigger than myself.\n\nMy dad introduced me to the concept years ago.\n\nIt speaks to being connected with others and part of something bigger than yourself. Again, this goal relates to my desire to do some good in the world.\n\n19. To Meditate Daily\n\nI think meditation is a central part of happiness.\n\nMy girlfriend (a yoga teacher) does it every single day, and I can see the difference it makes in her.\n\nI’ve done bits and pieces of mindfulness for a long time but have never been able to commit to a daily practice! I think it would be good for me, though. My head is always so busy, and I’m susceptible to anxiety. Meditation might offer a reprieve.\n\n20. To Stay Present\n\nI want to spend as much of my time feeling present as possible.\n\nToo often, I’m either living in the past or contemplating the future.\n\nI need to get better at staying in the here and now. I think it’ll be key to becoming happier and more content overall.\n\n21. To Become More Politically Aware\n\nI’m not a very political person. I had zero interest in it until I was probably in my early twenties.\n\nI’ve got better, but I’m still very ignorant when it comes to most political issues. It’s an area I need to know more about.\n\n22. To Live Simply\n\nHaving lived out of a backpack for half a decade, I already live quite a simple, minimalistic life.\n\nAnd I want that to continue.\n\nI hate accruing stuff. I don’t want to spend my money on material things – I don’t think it makes you happy. I’d much rather invest in experiences, personal growth, and other people.\n\n23. To Get Out of My Head\n\nAll too often, I’m inward-facing.\n\nThere’s a whole world out there with lots of issues that need addressing. I need to get out of my head more. Being too introspective isn’t helpful.\n\n24. To Learn to Ride a Motorbike\n\nI don’t really know why this appeals to me!\n\nI’m actually quite scared of learning to ride a motorbike. But I also think it would be cool.\n\nI love the idea of owning one of the old-school ones. Nothing fancy. But imagine traveling around a country on it! What a cool adventure.\n\n25. To Complete a Crazy Fitness Challenge\n\nI want to do some crazy fitness challenges. Ironmans, ultramarathons, walking around the world…something of that nature.\n\nA couple of years ago, I ran the length of the UK, from John o’Groats (Scotland) to Land’s End (Cornwall, England). I did it unsupported over 66 days.\n\nIt was hard work but an epic experience. I’d like to do similar stuff in the future.\n\n26. To Do Physical Activity Every Day\n\nI live a fairly active life. However, I’m also a workaholic. I often spend 12 hours a day in front of the computer trying to grow my content/blogging business!\n\nAt the time of writing, I spend far more time sitting down at my computer than is good for me.\n\n27. To Prioritize Sleep and Wellbeing\n\nI hate being tired. I’m grouchy and impatient and find it much harder to enjoy my day.\n\nRemove caffeine from the equation, and I’m even worse!\n\nIf I’m truly going to get the most from my life, then I have to prioritize my sleep. Late nights, drunken nights, and so on don’t go hand in hand with that.\n\nThis links in with my overall well-being. I plan on prioritizing my mental and emotional health alongside my physical health.\n\n28. To Practice Gratitude\n\nThis is another life goal I need to improve at.\n\nI aim to regularly remind myself what I’m grateful for. It’s good for the soul.\n\nIt’s easy to be grateful for the good stuff. The real trick is to find genuine thanks for the hardships that come too. This is still a work in progress.\n\n29. To Live in another Country\n\nI don’t just want to travel the world.\n\nI’d like to try living in new countries, too.\n\nAs it stands, the closest I’ve come to this is living in New Zealand. I’m currently here for the 4th time, and I’m renting a place with my girlfriend.\n\nThe irony is it makes me miss the UK! Maybe an update to this life dream would be to have a place to live both in the UK and New Zealand…\n\n30. To Learn an Instrument\n\nI would love to be able to play an instrument.\n\nI can play a few tunes on the piano, but it doesn’t really count!\n\nWhile I’m on the road, a more realistic instrument I could learn is guitar. For now, though, it’s still one of my dreams in life.\n\n31. To Learn Another Language\n\nI speak a little bit of French. But I am definitely not bilingual.\n\nI’d love to be, though.\n\nI’ve actually thought about combining this goal with my desire to live in another country. Living in a new place is a great incentive to master the language.\n\nLikewise, house prices in certain parts of France are so cheap!\n\nHow cool would it be to buy a ramshackle old building in France, do it up, start living there, and learn the language in the process?\n\n32. To Learn How to Cook\n\nOkay, so I can cook! But it’d be cool to be able to do it really well.\n\nI think chefs have the same special ability as musicians: they can bring people together with their craft. It’s a nice thought.\n\n33. To Grow My Own Food\n\nI’ve been born and raised in the city. So, for most of my life, I’ve associated food with the supermarket!\n\nI’m absolutely ignorant when it comes to all things horticulture. The thought of being self-sufficient and growing my own organic produce is a lovely one.\n\n34. To Have My Own Art Studio\n\nOne of my longstanding dreams in life has been to have an art studio.\n\nI’ve loved drawing and painting since I was a kid, and miss having the space and means to do it.\n\nStrangely, I very rarely sit down and do either these days. However, I still like the idea of having a studio in my future house. Hopefully, that would provide the incentive to start it up again…\n\n35. To Surround Myself with Good, Inspiring People\n\nYou’re only as good as the people you surround yourself with.\n\nI want to spend my time with good, kind-hearted people who inspire me. Whether it’s their intellect, skills, achievements, kindness, compassion, or joie de vivre, it doesn’t matter.\n\n36. To Have a Family\n\nWhen I first wrote this post a few years ago, I wrote that, “I can’t imagine a future without having my own family around.”\n\nI had no plans on having kids any time soon! But it’s happening…\n\nMy girlfriend is almost nine months pregnant. So, in the next week or two, I’ll officially be a dad! It’s scary, but exciting!\n\n37. Prioritise Contentment\n\nHappiness is a relative concept. To know it, you have to experience sadness, too. So, by nature, it waxes and wanes.\n\nContentment is the opposite.\n\nIt’s consistent. It exists independent of any other emotion. It means you want for nothing, which sounds like a good way to live to me!\n\n38. Learn to Surf\n\nThis is another relatively new dream of mine.\n\nBut, after my first proper try at surfing in Bali a few years ago (…I was shockingly bad), followed by more attempts in Ireland and then Cornwall (…definitely still a work in progress), it’s something I’d like to do more of!\n\nSurfing’s just an awesome way to spend a day. Not only is it good exercise, but you’re out there in the elements. You focus on nothing but your board, the next wave…and trying not to drown each time you get rolled by one.\n\n39. Complete a Long-Distance Hike\n\nA couple of years ago, I was on a day hike in Italy when I met a girl who’d trekked all the way from Canterbury (southeast England).\n\nShe was doing the Via Francigena Pilgrimage, an epic 1900km thru-hike. By the time I met her, she’d been walking for months and was just a couple of weeks away from her final stop: Rome.\n\nShe was very cool. And inspirational. …And it made me want to do something similar!\n\nAfter running the length of the UK, this is one I feel like I’ve sort of done. But I’d still love to do a proper pilgrimage/thru-hike.\n\n40. Do a Silent Retreat\n\nI want to go on a silent retreat for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, I’m tired of how busy my head can be, and wonder if a week or two of silence might help.\n\nI also know people who have done them and who say it’s an amazing experience. And lastly, I’ve never done one before! What will it be like? What will I learn?\n\nOnly one way to find out…\n\nNow You Know My Dreams In Life, What’s On Your Dreams List?\n\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. It’s also very likely to change over time!\n\nSome of my current goals may become less appealing. I might realize I want to do new and different things instead.\n\nRegardless, I hope it’s been somewhat useful to read about my dreams in life right now.\n\nHas it sparked any ideas of your own? Has it made you think about things you want to do, too?\n\nIf so, I encourage you to write them down. Having a concrete set of goals to refer back to regularly is an excellent first step to making them happen."
