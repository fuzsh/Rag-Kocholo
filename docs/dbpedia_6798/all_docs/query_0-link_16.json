        "text": "The dream about your husband is a good omen, foretelling some pleasant events. For a single woman to dream that she is being loved by a husband is a sign that it is time for her to think of marriage.\n\nThe future marriage will be a happy one. In general, being single and dreaming you are married is a good sign, but it can also refer to an argument with someone dear to you. The dream of a husband is an omen of partnership, questioning your commitments to people in the real life. In the European tradition, the dream of your husband could mean uncertainty and potential disappointment, especially if your husband leaves you or cheats on you. Most of the time, dreaming of your partner suggests you should expect pleasant moments ahead.\n\nDetailed dream interpretation:\n\nThe dream of your husband is, in general, a good omen. However, if in your dream you see yourself laughing and joking with your husband, this foretells an argument regarding an inheritance or a large amount of money. Getting back with your husband is a sign of a future complicated situation. Cuddling with your husband is also an omen of unpleasant events. If a single woman dreams she has a husband and she sees him, this means she is ready for this sort of relationship. If a married woman dreams of her husband, this could mean problems in the family. Family arguments are also foretold by a dream of your husband growing a mustache or a beard or both. If in your dream you are neglecting your husband, this means you make yourself available to help people in the real life.\n\nIf you are dreaming your husband leaves on a trip, this is a sign of tangled things in your family. If your husband is cheating on you in your dream, this suggests you have unfounded fear and suspicion. If you cheat on your husband in the dream, this dream is about your feelings rather than the reality. It is a sign of unfounded guilt and unhappiness, but it can also omen a change that you want to happen in your married life, or in your life in general. If your husband leaves you in your dream, this means you are afraid of your relationship or of the situation of your marriage, perhaps experiencing disappointment. Seeing your husband dead is not a good omen, as it indicates pain and suffering ahead. If you dream of your husband being sick, this is a sign of a fake attitude from your real husband, and uncertainty ahead.\n\nIf in your dream you experience a feeling of fear towards losing your husband to another woman, this is a sign of similar worries in the real life. Seeing your husband being happy in a dream means your relationship with him and other family members in the real life will be peaceful and secure. If your husband is healthy in the dream, this means you will enjoy good support from your husband. Dreaming of divorcing your husband could be a sign that you are actually considering it in the real life, or that you fear such a possibility exists. This can be a sign of some behavioral issues that you need to address as soon as possible, as this behavior disturbs your real husband. If in your dream your husband is old, this means confidence and a sign of happiness. If in the dream your husband is blond, this is the sign of arrogance, while if he has dark hair this means flattery. Seeing your husband being handsome foretells contentment and fulfilled hopes. If you see your husband being fat, this means abundance, while if he is tall this means jealousy.\n\nIn your dream you may have\n\nYou see your husband.\n\nYou see your husband, but you are not married in reality.\n\nYour husband leaves you.\n\nYour husband is sick.\n\nYour husband is dead.\n\nYou argue with your husband.\n\nYou get back with your husband.\n\nYour husband grew a mustache or a beard or both.\n\nYou are cuddling with your husband.\n\nYou are neglecting your husband.\n\nYou are taking care of your husband.\n\nYour husband leaves on a trip.\n\nYour husband cheats on you.\n\nYou divorce your husband.\n\nPositive:\n\nDo not lose yourself in the dream world.\n\nRelease some of your tension with your husband.\n\nYour husband is happy in the dream.\n\nYou feel good seeing your husband.\n\nFeelings that you may have encountered during a dream of my husband:\n\nAstonished.
