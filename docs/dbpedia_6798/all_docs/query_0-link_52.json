        "text": "Personalized dream meanings | Explore dream themes | Find mental clarity\n\nSo, what do those strange dreams really mean? With personalized meanings and therapist guidance, get to know your dreams and yourself at a deeper level with DreamApp.\n\nGrounded in tradition and backed by science, we delve into your dreams so you can understand your subconscious mind. DreamApp is a companion who will listen in a friendly manner, give advice and connect the dots between your dreams and your life.\n\nDiscovering the hidden meanings of your dreams is just the beginning. Do you need help to feel confident in your decisions? Is it difficult to find peace for yourself and your life? Your dreams may be telling you how to take on your biggest challenges. Become one with your step towards overcoming anxiety, and depression, gaining mental clarity and releasing your past.\n\n>>> Here is how DreamApp works if you break down the process into stages >>>\n\nSTAGE ONE | Dreaming and Healing\n\nLet the dreaming do the healing. Your healing journey starts in your bed when you drift off to sleep and enter a dreaming (REM) stage. Your brain is sorting out your emotional concerns. DreamApp has little to do with this process stage, and all the credit goes to its evolution and nature.\n\nSTAGE TWO | Dream Reporting and Journaling\n\nWake up and make sure to log your dream report. Notice how the story you dreamed about makes you feel upon awakening. Does it define your mood for the coming day? Capture your thoughts and feelings before they fizzle out, as they most definitely will. Journaling your dreams sets the ground for asking questions like why you were dreaming, what you were dreaming and how you can use this information to make decisions in your waking life. This self-examination is crucial for noticing and further understanding the states your mind enters, whether during your dreams or waking hours.\n\nSTAGE THREE | Understanding Your Dreams\n\nGet the first raw analysis of the themes that appeared in your dream. Using a range of AI solutions, DreamApp will analyze your dream to give you a rough idea of why you might have dreamed what you dreamed. You will get âthe meaning of your dreamâ with an important caveat that there are no universal meanings (the realm of horoscopes). There are rather dream patterns that can point towards some common emotional concerns reflected in common dreams. Unlike reading your lab exam results, the chart will only show you the statistical norm across the studied populations, and any actionable recommendations can only be prescribed to you according to your specific state and history of health and illness.\n\nSTAGE FOUR | Discussing Your Dreams with a Therapist\n\nYes, you heard it right. DreamApp connects you to a board-certified psychologist specializing in using dream analysis. It doesnât mean that DreamApp thinks you are âmentalâ and connects you to a âdoctorâ. It means that DreamApp believes in the immense power of honest and open conversation in a safe and compassionate setting. DreamApp therapists are here to hear any of your concerns with zero judgment and no expectations of you. Simply put, their only job is to figure out how to make you feel better in your waking life.\n\nSTAGE FIVE | Sound Sleeping\n\nDeep, sound, restful sleep indicates a healthier, happier, more meaningful waking life. Go to sleep, relieved of the emotional baggage of complex past experiences. Find yourself dreaming and living a more content life. If anything goes wrong, go back to stage one."
