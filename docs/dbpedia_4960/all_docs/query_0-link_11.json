        "text": "DANCING With the Stars alum Maks Chmerkovskiy has predicted the Season 32 winner in an exclusive interview with The U.S. Sun and revealed which contestants he believes will make the final three.\n\nAfter nine celebrities and their partners gave their all on Tuesday night's Monster-themed episode, Mauricio Umansky and Emma Slater were sent home during the shocking elimination.\n\nOnly eight couples remain as they prepare for Music Video Night on November 7, which will feature Paula Abdul as a guest judge.\n\nFormer pro dancer Maks Chmerkovskiy has revealed his top three picks and who he thinks will win Season 32.\n\n\"So you have to look at things from a bird's eye view, and I see that Daniella [Karagach] and Jason Mraz are doing amazing.\n\n\"I see Val [Chmerkovskiy] and Xochitl [Gomez] are doing amazing.\n\n\"I think that Artem [Chigvintsev] is doing a great job with Charity [Lawson],\" he spilled in an exclusive interview with The U.S. Sun while promoting his new Maks & Peta skincare line.\n\nHe went on to say that weeks from now, when viewers are going to tune in to see who's going to win, he thinks, \"It'll be between Jason Mraz and Xochitl.\"\n\nAnd as far as who will take home the mirror ball trophy, Maks, 43, revealed: \"In my opinion, I'm going to be Team Val and Xochitl at the moment for the win.\"\n\nWHO'S GOING HOME\n\nWhen asked about Ariana Madix, who landed in second place on the leader board on October 31, Maks said that she is \"doing good.\"\n\nHowever, he said: \"I'm just not going to be the guy who predicts the longevity because I can already point at some things that may or may not lack for somebody like Ariana in a long-term [situation].\"\n\nThe DWTS alum, who was part of the Len Goodman tribute dance piece on the October 24 episode, said that he visits the ballroom every week because his 6-year-old son, Shai, wants to see mom Peta Murgatroyd.\n\nPeta is still in the competition with Brady Bunch's Barry Williams.\n\nMaks shared: \"I just don't think that Peta and Barry are winners.\n\n\"I think that they're winners in my book. Every time they come out and do a performance, it's a win.\n\n\"He's doing amazing for what he's got to work with against an 18-year-old who has no physical or otherwise limitations.\"\n\nIS IT RIGGED?\n\nFans have recently accused the show of being \"rigged\" after contestant Harry Jowsey escaped elimination.\n\nHe and his partner, Rylee Arnold, were at the bottom of the leaderboard on Halloween, earning 28 out of 40 points.\n\nMaks shockingly admitted that he also has the same theory given his \"history with second and third places.\"\n\nDuring his 17 seasons on the show, Maks took home the mirror ball trophy in Season 18 when he was partnered with Meryl Davis.\n\n\"I think that the reality is that it's always entertaining, and yes, we're just too attached, we're too close, we're taking it too personal,\" the Tetya KAPA Vodka founder confessed.\n\n\"I do know everything about this. Now that I'm removed.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that there are a lot of reasons why couples are eliminated at a specific time, including the order in which they perform.\n\n\"If you performed first, [fans] might forget you by the end of the show. If somebody wants to wait until the final performance to know who to vote for, there's some people that vote for their favorites,\" he said.\n\n\"But if you go first, for example, you'll have more time for people to vote for you. If you go last, people may not have enough time to cast the vote.\"\n\nRETURNING TO DWTS?\n\nAfter quitting the ballroom after Season 25, Maks went on to focus on his growing family and explore other projects.\n\nHe and Peta welcomed their second child, a baby boy named Rio, in June.\n\nThe entrepreneur quipped: \"The way these things are going, maybe Peta will be pregnant.\n\n\"She loves to get pregnant while on Dancing With the Stars.\"\n\nFor now, the couple is excited about their new online shop, Maks & Peta, where fans can purchase their soothing line of CBD pain cream, face mist, foot spray, and hand & foot lotion.\n\n\"I'm in a very happy place. I have no regrets. I have no upset feelings. I only want to be good father, husband, person in general. But my goals, dreams, and aspirations are elsewhere nowadays,\" Maks said.\n\nFor one, he hopes to move forward with another stage production project with his brother Val, similar to Savor After Hours.\n\n\"In the meantime, my focus is home and family more than anything. I do like that time. I don't have it free,\" he said.\n\n\"I have to carve it out and always on the go, but I try to stay present and I try to be a real parent, not just make babies, hand them off to help and show up to birthdays. That's not me.\""
