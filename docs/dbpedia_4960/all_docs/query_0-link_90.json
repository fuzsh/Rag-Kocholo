        "text": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy has hinted that he might not return to Dancing with the Stars next season.\n\nChmerkovskiy suggested in September that he would not be renewing his Dancing with the Stars contract, but said he would continue on the series until late 2013.\n\nHe has now written a blog for TV Guide on his and Kirstie Alley's elimination from the competition last week and also included criticism of adding modern dance styles to the show.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm not sure why producers feel they need to throw in these new and non-ballroom dance styles,\" he said in his blog. \"I really do believe that fans want to see good ballroom dancing and it's hard to do so when the pros don't even know the dance styles. If it's not broken, why fix it?\"\n\nHe went on to write: \"I loved Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, but it's the same thing every episode. It's a different family and a different house, but every episode, they just rebuilt houses, but I loved watching it. Take American Idol. Every week, they sing, America votes, and then someone wins.\n\n\"They have theme weeks, but they never ask them to do backflips while you're singing or something. What is a 'Caveman' hustle? What's a 'Surfer' flamenco? Who came up with that? It was amazing that Tom [Bergeron] called them out. I couldn't understand it. I was like, 'Thank god we got eliminated!'\"\n\nChmerkovskiy revealed that he and Alley will participate in the Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars finale, but suggested his future on the series beyond that show is unclear.\n\n\"I have not made a decision about next season yet,\" he hinted. \"To be honest, I have many offers and I might need a break.\"\n\nThe dance professional has made it to the Dancing with the Stars final four times, finishing as runner-up twice and third-place on two occasions.\n\nDancing with the Stars continues on Monday at 8/7c on ABC."
