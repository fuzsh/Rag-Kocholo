        "text": "Things are getting closer to winding down on Season 32 of Dancing With the Stars, and in a few weeks, one team will be officially lifting the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy over their heads as they celebrate their victory.\n\nHowever, of the eight remaining couples, some seem more likely to have a chance at that moment than others.\n\nWhether it is because they are consistently the best performers or have the strongest fan bases, some of the remaining competitors definitely have a bigger advantage when it comes to winning.\n\nMeanwhile, there are some left in the competition who are also a little less likely to make it to that point.\n\nFormer pro Maks Chmerkovskiy, who won the trophy in Season 18, has weighed in with his thoughts, and unfortunately for some of those closest to him, he doesn’t have high hopes.\n\nRead more: DWTS' Ariana Madix 'working hard' to avoid pressure from Carrie Ann Inaba\n\nMaks’ wife, Peta Murgatroyd, is one of the pros competing on the current season, and she has been partnered with The Brady Bunch star Barry Williams.\n\nThe two have been fan-favorites, but have suffered when it comes to the judges’ scores. And while Maks had praise for the pair, he also doesn’t feel they have what it takes to win.\n\n“I just don’t think Peta and Barry are winners,” he told the U.S. Sun. “I think they they’re winners in my book. Every time they come out and do a performance, it’s a win.”\n\n“He’s doing amazing for what he’s got to work with against an 18-year-old who has no physical or otherwise limitations,” he added.\n\nHe also shared his thoughts on Ariana Madix, who was declared a front-runner last week and is now feeling the pressure.\n\nSharing that she was doing well, Maks also cautioned that there are are things that could and couldn’t “lack” for her in the long-term–meaning that she might not make it to the top 3.\n\nAs for who he felt would get there, he shared that he had high hopes for Jason Mraz and Daniella Karagach, Artem Chigvintsev and Charity Lawson and his younger brother, Val Chmerkovskiy, who is competing with Xochitl Gomez.\n\nIn fact, when it comes to who will win, he feels his brother has a great chance at taking home his third mirrorball trophy, which would see him tie with Mark Ballas as the second-most winning pro on the show (the record holder is now judge Derek Hough, who won the show six times).\n\nDon't miss...\n\nDWTS' Xochitl Gomez hits back at claim she 'messed up' by spraining ankle [LATEST]\n\nDWTS having Taylor Swift themed night with guest judge and fans are going wild [UPDATE]\n\nXochitl Gomez admits she has leg issue after battling brutal DWTS injury [INSIGHT]\n\n“It’ll be between Jason Mraz and Xochitl,” he said.\n\n“In my opinion, I’m going to be Team Val and Xochitt at the moment for the win.”\n\nDancing With the Stars airs Tuesdays on ABC and Disney+. Episodes can be streamed the next day on Hulu."
