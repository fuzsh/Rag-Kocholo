        "text": "#20: Freestyle to “Toxic” with Rumer Willis\n\nSeason 20\n\nOh, look at the drama! This dance was one of this duo’s final performances of their season, and they pulled out all of the stops! Willis and Chmerkovskiy had palpable chemistry as partners, and their freestyle to this toned down rendition of Britney Spears’ “Toxic” highlights that intense connection. With a stripped down set, the pair is the centerpiece of the performance. Willis became a bona fide professional throughout her run on “Dancing with the Stars,” so watching her flex her technical skills in this dance is an absolute joy! Plus… did we mention these two have chemistry?\n\n#19: Team Freestyle to \"This Is Halloween\" with Tamar Braxton\n\nSeason 21\n\nIt was spooky season on the “Dancing with the Stars” stage, and this number is bound to give you chills no matter what time of year it is! The Halloween night group performance featured singer and reality TV personality Tamar Braxton, who placed fifth with Val on her season of the show. It’s always a treat to see the pairs work together, and this “Nightmare Before Christmas” themed dance is perfectly executed. The set design only adds to the magic of this performance– especially those incredible tables! Braxton and Chmerkovskiy’s solo is filled with character, and some impressive lifts to boot.\n\n#18: Salsa to “Pucko” with Elizabeth Berkley Lauren & Gleb Savchenko\n\nSeason 17\n\nShe’s one lucky lady! This trio dance challenge teamed up actress Elizabeth Berkley Lauren and her partner Val with a third professional, Gleb Savchenko. And we thought these dances were hard enough to learn and master with only one partner! But together, the three performed an impressive salsa that is so much fun to watch. They’re all so in sync with one another, and nobody robs the spotlight. This showing earned the team a perfect score, however they were sadly eliminated from the competition that week. We demand a recount, judges!\n\n#17: Tango to \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" with Danica McKellar\n\nSeason 18\n\nHeavy is the head that wears the crown! This performance has that signature Val Chmerkovskiy intensity, with staging and light effects to back it up. Star Danica McKellar– best known for her portrayal of Winnie Cooper in “The Wonder Years– was a real trooper during this performance. In rehearsals a few weeks prior to the dance, she broke one of her ribs. But even with such a physical setback, she pushed through her injury and still managed to deliver a beautiful Tango– that’s dedication! We wouldn’t let a broken bone stop us from dancing with Val either!\n\n#16: Argentine Tango & Foxtrot to \"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" with Normani\n\nSeason 24\n\nTwo dance styles are better than one! Fifth Harmony band member and pop artist Normani was a perfect match for Val– she has some serious skills! And through this performance, it’s clear as day that these two have tons of fun dancing with one another. During the final round of the competition, each team was tasked with fusing two genres of dance. Normani and Val seamlessly blended the Foxtrot and the Argentine Tango– major props to the pro’s choreographing skills! Despite the fact that this duo did not ultimately win their season, they surely had some unforgettable numbers together.\n\n#15: Flamenco to \"Malagueña\" with Kelly Monaco\n\nSeason 15\n\nWe love how the unique surf theme and set design of this performance pair with the intensity of the Flamenco. It’s an unexpected combination, but it really works! After having won Season 1 with dancer Alec Mazo, model and actress Kelly Monaco returned to “Dancing with the Stars” for their all-star season. And in this dance, you can certainly tell she knows what she’s doing! She and Val have a strong connection on the dancefloor that really shines through here as well. Also, who isn’t obsessed with these tear away outfits? We can’t get enough!\n\n#14: Paso Doble to \"Blame\" with Janel Parrish\n\nSeason 19\n\nWe’re not exaggerating when we say these two were born to Paso Doble together! This semi-finals performance is easily one of the strongest and most passionate routines from their season. Not to mention, this particular style of dance requires lots of precision and upper body strength– and the pair makes it look totally effortless. The judges awarded this dance a perfect forty out of forty, and it was well deserved to say the least! We love how polished the dancing duo looks, and especially cannot get enough of their super intense facial expressions!\n\n#13: Charleston to \"Bang Bang\" with Victoria Arlen\n\nSeason 25\n\nAll aboard the “Dancing with the Stars” express! We wish we could’ve been in the audience for this amazing number. Let’s travel back to the ‘20s for a roaring Charleston performed by Val and his partner, Paralympic gold medalist Victoria Arlen. Their costumes are perfect period pieces, and the set design is next level – it makes it feel like the first part of the dance is taking place on a moving train! Besides their on-point moves, the two successfully land a ton of incredible lifts and tricks. The pair can’t seem to stop smiling throughout this performance, and honestly, neither can we!\n\n#12: Hip Hop to \"Fine China\" with Zendaya\n\nSeason 16\n\nIt’s not often you see a Hip-Hop dance performed in the “Dancing with the Stars” ballroom. Let’s not forget that Zendaya got her start in acting on the Disney Channel dance series “Shake It Up!” This routine played to her many strengths (though we don’t think she has any weaknesses), and you can tell she is completely in her element. She seems just as natural and professional as her partner does! The performance is mesmerizing– neither dancer misses a single beat! And of course, we love how cute they both look in their costumes– especially Val in those nerdy glasses!\n\n#11: Viennese Waltz to \"Pure Imagination\" with Laurie Hernandez\n\nSeason 23\n\nWatching this routine makes us feel as if we’re the ones who won the golden ticket! On season 23’s Halloween week, Val and his partner, Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez, performed a stunning Willy Wonka themed Viennese Waltz. The routine allows us to see the gentler side of the pro’s dancing and choreography, with Hernandez’s youthful energy definitely softening up some of his edges. The stage design transforms the whole dance into a wonderland, and accentuates the pair’s graceful movements. And yes, this dance earned them a perfect score from the judges!\n\n#10: Argentine Tango to \"Too Close\" with Meryl Davis\n\nSeason 18\n\nIt’s always fun to bring some good, old fashioned, brotherly competition into the mix! The fourth week of “Dancing with the Stars’” 18th season saw the dancers paired with new celebrities for their “switch-up” night. Olympic ice skater Meryl Davis, who was originally dancing with Maksim Chmerkovskiy, was now performing with his brother Val! Davis had already been impressing the judges, but it requires tons of skill to be able to change partners on short notice. And she didn’t disappoint. Their Argentine Tango is super sharp and precise throughout – we hope you weren’t too jealous, Maks!\n\n#9: Dance to “Love Someone” with Jenna Johnson\n\nSeason 27\n\nWho’s a better dance partner than your life partner? We doubt anyone is, especially if both people are professionals on “Dancing with the Stars”! Val married Jenna Johnson, who first started competing in the series as a professional on Season 23, in 2019. Now, it’s not too often you see two pros performing with one another. But this then-engaged couple shared a short dance on the “Most Memorable Year Night” of Season 27. Their love for one another is undeniable, radiating through their movements– it’s obvious that they’re a perfect match! Talk about relationship goals.\n\n#8: Foxtrot to \"Take Me to Church\" with Rumer Willis\n\nSeason 20\n\nRumor has it, we have another Rumer Willis dance on this list! Another installment from their finale week trio of performances, this Foxtrot brings equal parts talent and emotion. Set to Hozier’s “Take Me to Church,” the dance is all about exhibiting the technical ballroom skills that Willis developed throughout her time on the show. She’s having a blast in this routine, and Val’s pride for her growth as a performer is written all over his face! You can tell that he has taught her everything he possibly could have, and she’s blossomed into a Foxtrotting butterfly!\n\n#7: Viennese Waltz to \"I Have Nothing\" with Ginger Zee\n\nSeason 22\n\nYou’re seeing multiples too, right? Sometimes the best prop of all is just… more of you! This routine is proof. Chmerkovskiy and “Good Morning America”’s chief meteorologist Ginger Zee’s classical Viennese Waltz is nothing short of excellent. Zee looks so elegant, floating through the moves swiftly and confidently. Her pro partner is as polished as ever, and genuinely seems to be enjoying having such a well-matched star by his side. We’re surprised these two didn’t take home the Mirrorball Trophy, but they did make it all the way to the end together!\n\n#6: Freestyle to \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" with Janel Parrish\n\nSeason 19\n\nWho doesn’t love a good Freestyle? One of the most exciting moments of any “Dancing with the Stars” season is seeing what the final pairs will cook up for their “anything goes” routine. And knowing Chmerkovskiy’s dance style, his specialty is lots of dramatics! His Freestyle with Janel Parrish to a slowed down rendition of \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" is hauntingly beautiful. These two don’t need any fancy set pieces or flashy backup dancers to deliver an incredible performance. Their emotional and precise movements are more than enough to fill the stage!\n\n#5: Tango to \"Good Girls Go Bad\" with Gabby Windey\n\nSeason 31\n\nWere you rooting for this duo from the minute you saw them? If you weren’t, this dance may have changed your mind! Chmerkovskiy and “The Bachelorette” star Gabby Windey performed a bright and energetic Tango together, set to “Good Girls Go Bad.” It’s exciting to see the pair hit their stride in the competition, with this routine just reinforcing the fact that they were ones to watch. There’s an impressive technicality and personality that shines through them, so it’s no wonder the pair got 10s from each and every judge! They continued their strong streak into the semi-finals with a stunning Waltz and powerful Paso Doble— earning another round of perfect scores and sailing straight through to the finals.\n\n#4: Contemporary to \"Freedom\" with Normani\n\nSeason 24\n\nThis Contemporary routine looks and feels like it belongs on Broadway! Normani absolutely eats it up with her acting and dancing abilities alike. Plus, the backup performers do a great job of highlighting the pair, and help bring a story to life. Each moment of the routine is just as breathtaking as the next, with stunning lifts, evocative expressions, and of course, stellar technique. Val and Normani both seem incredibly moved throughout the duration of the number. They clearly channel that emotion into each of their movements, touching us in the process.\n\n#3: Freestyle to \"Brand New\" with Laurie Hernandez\n\nSeason 23\n\nWatching this freestyle can make anyone feel like a kid again! The duo had such an incredible season dancing together, and this performance feels like the perfect cherry on top. It just exudes celebration and joy. Perhaps the pair anticipated their impending Mirrorball Trophy victory? Hernandez was just sixteen years old at the time, and made history as the youngest champion “Dancing with the Stars” had ever seen. And while her talent and maturity always shone throughout the season, it’s nice to see her partner capture her youthful spirit through this number’s choreography.\n\n#2: Salsa to \"Dança Molengo\" with Zendaya & Gleb Savchenko\n\nSeason 16\n\nThree certainly isn’t a crowd in this performance! Zendaya is the queen of this number – she even has the throne to prove it. In season 16’s trio rounds, she and Chmerkovskiy were matched up with Gleb Savchenko for their Salsa. Just watching their routine makes us feel like we’re at a party! As per usual, Zendaya is as great of a dancer as any of the pros are. And as a trio, they all move in such synchronicity that they’re impossible to look away from! We’re still shocked that Zendaya and Val ultimately finished the competition as runner-ups.\n\n#1: Rumba to \"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\" with Rumer Willis\n\nSeason 20\n\nThese two are so passionate together, steam is coming from the floor! Okay, fine, maybe it’s just a smoke machine – but still! It’s no secret that Willis is one of the greatest partners we’ve seen with Chmerkovskiy, but this dance brought their chemistry to the next level. Aside from just nailing the moves with such elegance, the passion and emotion the pair brought to their Rumba is absolutely unmatched. We say that this performance belongs in the “Dancing with the Stars” hall of fame as one of the greatest of all time!"
