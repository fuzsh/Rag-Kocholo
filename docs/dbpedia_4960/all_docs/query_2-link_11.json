All that, plus our surviving finalists performed their last respective dances (under the heading of “The 24 Hour Fusion challenge).\n\nPHOTOS | Fall TV Preview: Your Guide to What’s New!\n\nHere’s a quick look at tonight’s Top 5 moments, plus the really, really, really big announcement:\n\nTOP 5 MOMENTS (in no particular order)\n\nMERYL’s MAGIC CONTINUES | So what’s next, Miss Perfect? Dancing a fox trot-cha cha fusion, Meryl’s insane tally of perfect 10s continued in the most astonishing style. Carrie Ann dropped all pretentions (“the best part of the season … was you two”) while Len dropped a personal bomb (“this may be my last season…”) and Bruno got romantic (“something’s stirring inside me … it’s like when you discover the passion and the excitement of your first love”). On a side note, can anyone remember the last time Meryl got a 9?\n\nPERFECTION, THY NAME IS AMY | Dancing an Argentine tango-cha cha fusion, Amy and Derek brought the ballroom to its feet, earning a trio of perfect 10s. Len played down the emotions and focused on the footwork (“you are a fantastic dancer”) while Carrie Ann (“there’s so much to say, I could write a novel to you…”) also gave Derek a well-deserved nod. Bruno simply called her “unforgettable” and who can argue with that?\n\nERIN ANDREWS, UNCUT! | Is it just me, or were the unaired segments of Erin’s delightfully snarky highlight-reel clips light years better and more appealing than her live segments? Though Tom Bergeron explained this was Erin’s “R”-rated footage (apparently unfit for prime time), I found this upgraded version of Brooke Burke Charvet’s successor (“want me to smack you now or later?”) exceedingly more entertaining. More naughty, uncensored Erin next season, please!\n\nDRESS REHEARSALS, GONE WILD! | While we’re at it, can we just turn the entire Season 19 into one of those highly appealing, hilarious, and refreshingly real dress-rehearsal clips we saw tonight? Have Tom Bergeron (“you can Tweet as many times as you like, we don’t give a #$%#$”), Bruno Tonioli (“Are we done?”) and Len Goodman (he giggles!) ever been more DVR-worthy? I smell at ratings bonanza, ABC!\n\nWELCOME BACK, AMBER | The season 17 DWTS champ reminded us just how talented, dynamic and joyful she is, stealing the show with her astonishing voice and presence in that happy and healthy dance segment.\n\nNow, onto the results…\n\n3rd PLACE\n\nCandace Cameron Bure & Mark Ballas\n\nFINAL TWO COUPLES COMPETING FOR THE MIRRORBALL\n\nMeryl Davis & Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nAmy Purdy & Derek Hough\n\nMIRRORBALL CHAMPIONS\n\nMeryl Davis & Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\n“It’s just plastic, but it means so much,” said Maks of winning the long-awaited Mirrorball trophy for the first time, before adding, “to do it with Meryl, is a dream come true. There’s a reason why it didn’t happen before, because this was meant to happen with us.”\n\nDid the right couple win it all? If not, who should’ve triumphed? Take our poll below, then sound off in the comments!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shcp5KcTUlQ"
