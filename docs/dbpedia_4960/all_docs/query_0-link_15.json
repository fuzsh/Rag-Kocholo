        "text": "The former Playboy Playmate of the Month and General Hospital star became the first-ever winners of Dancing with the Stars, overcoming tough criticism from the judges, a wardrobe malfunction, and some low scores. Monaco later returned for DWTS: All-Stars, where she came in third place with partner Val Chmerkovskiy.\n\nMost memorable dance: Their freestyle to \"Let's Get Loud\" by Jennifer Lopez.\n\nHis former boy band past (remember 98 Degrees?) may have helped Lachey nab the title, but with the help of Burke, their ranks remained high from the get-go. They got three perfect scores of 30 throughout their time, and Lachey returned to Dancing with the Stars as one of the All-Stars contestants in season 15, where he was partnered with Anna Trebunskaya and became the third couple eliminated from the competition.\n\nMost memorable dance: Their freestyle to Big & Rich's \"Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)\".\n\nSmith was the first in a line of many successful football players crossing over into the world of dance. Burke took home her second Mirrorball Trophy in a row in this pairing, and they nearly lost to Mario Lopez and partner Karina Smirnoff, as both pairs had matching scores going into the finale. The fan vote won out, giving the title to Smith.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: His samba to \"Sir Duke\" by Stevie Wonder.\n\nThe short-track speed skater may be the most decorated U.S. athlete of all time in the Olympic winter games, but he has another title in his pocket: Holder of the Mirrorball Trophy. He and Hough (who won her first title during this season) received five perfect scores throughout the season, setting a record. He returned for the All-Stars season, where he was paired with Karina Smirnoff, and finished in fifth place.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: The samba set to \"I Like to Move It\" by Reel 2 Real.\n\nMarking a second win for Hough, the three-time Indianapolis 500 auto racing champion was shocked he made it past the first week, let alone won the entire series—he only packed enough clothes for two weeks. He told Time, “I accepted the challenge. I said, ‘You know what—what’s the worst that can be? I get eliminated the first week and go back home.’ It was an experience.” The experience was a good one, because Castroneves returned for the All-Stars season, where he was paired with Chelsie Hightower and finished in 10th place.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: His quick-step set to \"Hey Pachuco\" from The Mask.\n\nYamaguchi and Ballas took DWTS to the next level: The pair gained four of the five perfect scores given out this season, and three of them were for their three Finals dances, giving them a perfect 90 out of 90 in the finals. They received the highest score for every single performance that season.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: Oh, duh, the jive to \"Rip it Up\" by Little Richard, of course.\n\nBurke was the recipient of every single perfect 30 score that seaso—first for her foxtrot in week seven, next for her freestyle in the finals, and again in the finals for her repeated Viennese waltz. Burke spent a record-breaking eight weeks at the top of the leaderboard during her season. Despite an injury, Burke and Hough (in his first of six wins, a feat no one else has accomplished) took it all the way to the end. Burke would go on to host the show for three years, replacing Samantha Harris.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: The freestyle dance to \"You're the One That I Want\" by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.\n\nJohnson became one of the youngest DWTS winners of all time when she narrowly (we're talking less than 1 percent) took the title over French actor Gilles Marini. Johnson would make the Dancing with the Stars finals a second time when she competed in the All Stars season, which turned out to be Season 8: The Redemption. She competed alongside Marini and eventual winner Melissa Rycroft (who came in third on season 8) and came in second place with her partner, Derek Hough.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: The cha-cha-cha set to \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" by Michael Jackson.\n\nAt 51, Osmond was the oldest contestant to win Dancing with the Stars and only competed because he wanted to see if he was a better dancer than his sister, Marie, who came in third place on season 5. He achieved his goal, though it wasn't easy.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: The '80s style paso doble set to \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" by Dead or Alive. It may not be necessarily good, but 'memorable' is perfect to describe this dance.\n\nBaby was far from the corner when Jennifer Grey took home the grand prize, back when she was paired with now three-time winner Derek Hough. You might say they...had the time of their lives.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: They took inspiration from Dirty Dancing for a moving Viennese Waltz set to to “These Arms of Mine” by Otis Redding.\n\nFormer Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Ward marked his last dance on Dancing With The Stars with a kiss on his mother's cheek, and he was all smiles when he took home the trophy in 2011 alongside Kym Johnson. Johnson may have suffered an injury during the season, but that didn't stop the two of them from coming out on top.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: Their perfect-scoring Argentine tango set to \"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\" by Doris Day.\n\nVeteran-turned-actor Martinez brought Smirnoff her first win (after several close calls) in the show's 13th season. Martinez was heavily favored to win the season, and rallied in the semi-finals despite a twisted ankle and a rough week. He's a comeback artist, that's for sure.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: Their waltz set to \"What the World Needs Now\" by Burt Bacharach.\n\nSeason 15 of Dancing With The Stars brought an All-Stars edition, and Melissa Rycroft took home the Mirrorball in the show's first all-female final three, beating out former winners Kelly Monaco and Shawn Johnson. This was partner Tony Dovolani's first and only win of his DWTS tenure, and the pair had some of the highest average scores in the series history—an average of 28.0 over the course of 15 dances.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: Their epic super-sized freestyle from the finale, set to \"I Was Here\" by Beyoncé.\n\nSeason 16 marked Hough's continuing run as the professional dancer who has won the most Mirrorball trophies, which he brought home this time alongside country music superstar Pickler. They received perfect 30-point scores on all three of their final dances: a quickstep set to Ludovic Bource's \"Peppy and George,\" a freestyle dance to by Labrinth feat. Emeli Sandé's \"Beneath Your Beautiful,\" and an instant jive to Little Richard's \"Keep-a-Knockin'.\" Their relationship ran so deep that Pickler even featured Hough in her music video for her song \"Someone Somewhere Tonight.\"\n\nMost Memorable Dance: Her finale freestyle has been considered to be one of the best in Dancing history.\n\nRiley and Hough beat out Corbin Bleu and Karina Smirnoff and Jack Osbourne and Cheryl Burke to make history: Riley became the first Black woman to win the series, while Hough received his fifth of six Mirrorball. “I did this competition because, I didn’t know if I [could] do it and anything that scares me I wanna do, so I [want to] let women of all sizes out there know you can do whatever you put your mind to,” Riley said after her win. “It doesn’t matter what size you are, what color you are, you can do whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever you put your mind to!”\n\nMost Memorable Dance: The Charleston that ended all Charlestons.\n\nDavis holds the record for highest overall cumulative average at 28.4, breaking Kristi Yamaguchi's score of 28.33, and tying with Jennifer Grey's record of most perfect scores received in a single season, with 6. But Davis and Chmerkovskiy's chemistry is what really lead them to the title. No, they weren't really dating—that was all performance.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: This freestyle, which will make you sweat.\n\nIt wouldn't be true to say Ribeiro took home the Mirrorball Trophy because he did his famous \"Carlton\" dance from The Fresh Prince, but it sure did help: After fearing he may have had to drop out of the competition due to a back and groin injury, Ribeiro had a tremendous comeback for the grand prize.\n\nMost Memorable Dance: Ladies and gentlemen, he did the The Carlton!"
