He continued on the show sporadically until season nine, but never again placed higher than eighth (with Toni Braxton in 2008).\n\nAfter he left the show for good in 2009, Manzo earned a Master's of Science degree in business management from Stanford University in 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile. He currently works as a general partner at the investment firm DGA Capital and lives in the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nBut Manzo will forever be connected to \"DWTS\" because he met his wife Edyta Śliwińska when she was also a pro dancer on the show. The couple married in 2007 and have two children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheryl Burke is now a podcaster.\n\nCheryl Burke is a two-time \"DWTS\" champion, snagging her trophies back-to-back on seasons two and three with boy-bander Drew Lachey and NFL star Emmitt Smith, respectively.\n\nShe appeared on 18 consecutive seasons of the reality show, starting in 2006 with Lachey. Burke officially retired from the show in 2022 after competing with meteorologist Sam Champion. In total, she danced on 25 seasons of \"DWTS.\"\n\nBurke launched the \"Pretty Messed Up\" podcast with her former dance partner, Backstreet Boy AJ McLean, in 2020. It appears to have last released an episode in December 2022.\n\nIn 2023, she launched the \"DWTS\" rewatch podcast \"Sex, Lies, and Spray Tans,\" with iHeartPodcasts.\n\nIn May 2019, Burke married actor Matthew Lawrence, whom she'd met after his brother Joey was cast on \"DWTS\" in 2006. The couple announced their divorce in February 2022 and finalized it that same year, but the split wasn't exactly amicable. Lawrence and Burke went to court about custody of their dog Ysabella. Burke won.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulianne Hough has literally grown up on \"DWTS.\"\n\nJulianne Hough is another two-time Mirrorball champion on \"DWTS.\" She won the competition in season four, which aired in early 2007, when paired with Olympic gold medalist speed skater Apolo Ohno. It was her first year as a professional dancer on the show.\n\nLike Burke, she won two seasons in a row, claiming the season five trophy later in 2007 with Brazillian race car driver Hélio Castroneves. Hough danced on the show until season eight, which aired in 2009.\n\nShe later became a permanent fourth judge on \"DWTS\" in 2014 for season 19 and was a member of the judging panel for five seasons total.\n\nIn August 2023, ABC announced that Hough would cohost the show with Alfonso Ribeiro, making her one of the most dynamic members of the \"DWTS\" cast in the show's history.\n\nAs for her personal life, Hough dated Ryan Seacrest from about 2010 to 2013. She was married to professional hockey player Brooks Laich from 2017 to 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Ballas officially retired in 2023.\n\nMark Ballas began his \"DWTS\" journey on season five with actor Sabrina Bryan as his partner.

He won again three years later in 2009 with Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Shawn Johnson in season 8. His final win came in 2022 when he was partnered with dancer and TikTok star Charli D'Amelio on season 31.\n\nBallas officially announced his retirement from the show in March 2023. He and his wife BC Jean (who married in 2016) announced they were expecting their first child together in June 2023 on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerek Hough has the most wins in \"Dancing With the Stars\" history.\n\nJulianne Hough's brother, dancer Derek Hough, is the winningest pro in the show's history.

Hough picked up another double-win year in 2013, landing the trophy in season 16 with country singer Kellie Pickler and again in season 17 with \"Glee\" star Amber Riley. His last win came in 2015, when he partnered with zookeeper and TV personality Bindi Irwin on season 21.\n\nAfter leaving the show as a pro, Derek joined the \"DWTS\" judging panel in 2020 for season 29 and has remained in that role since.\n\nHe married his longtime love, fellow dancer Hayley Erbert, in August 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKym Johnson has twins with a \"Shark Tank\" star.\n\nKym Johnson spent a total of 17 seasons on \"DWTS\" starting in 2006 with her season three partner Jerry Springer.\n\nShe went on to win the mirrorball on season nine in 2009, when she competed alongside the oldest winner in the show's history, performer Donny Osmond.
