        "text": "Dancing with The Stars\n\nSeason Seven Review — Intro\n\nBy Dr Matt\n\nHere are the weekly Recaps from the Top Thirteen Couples to the Final Three:\n\nIntro 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 Final 3\n\nHello \"Dancing with the Star\" Fans!\n\nSeason Seven offers something for everyone: the youngest star, the oldest star, two olympic atheletes, the queen of soap opera, an award-winning recording artist, two eye-popping models, a boy-band singer, a celebrity chef, a TV sit-com acter, one in-your-face insult comic, a former pro football player, the youngest professional dancer to date, and a former \"So You Think You Can Dance\" dancer.\n\nHere are the pairings:\n\n1 - LANCE BASS — Lacey Schwimmer (makes her DWTS debut)\n\n2 - TONI BRAXTON — Alec Mazo (one time Champ in his fourth season)\n\n3 - BROOKE BURKE — Derek Hough (his third season)\n\n4 - ROCCO DISPIRITO — Karina Smirnoff (her fifth season)\n\n5 - MAURICE GREENE — Cheryl Burke (2 time Champ in her sixth season)\n\nSee Maurice on Jimmy Kimmel Live—he's a very personalable guy\n\n6 - KIM KARDASHIAN — Mark Ballas (one time Champ in his third season)\n\n7 - CLORIS LEACHMAN — Corky Ballas (his series debut)\n\n8 - CODY LINLEY — Julianne Hough (2 time Champ in her fourth season)\n\n9 - SUSAN LUCCI — Tony Dovolani (returning for his sixth season)\n\n10 - MISTY MAY-TREANOR — Maksim Chmerkovskiy (his fifth season)\n\n11 - TED MCGINLEY — Inna Brayer (pronounced Ee-nah—her first season)\n\n12 - JEFFREY ROSS — Edyta Sliwinska (only pro to dance in all seven seasons)\n\n13 - WARREN SAPP — Kym Johnson (her fifth season)\n\nWatch the announcement of the couple pairings on Entertainment Tonight. And here's a video that has the Pros talking about their partners.\n\nBeing eliminated in the first week has to be embarrassing. So, every year DWTS sets up a few obvious candidates for quick elimination—usually it's an awkward-moving comedian. But last year, Julianne taught her not-so-coordinated comedian to dance well enough, that 3 other Stars were eliminated BEFORE Adam Carollo was tossed in the DWTS Trash Heap.\n\nMisery Loves Company. To make the first week elimination more merciful, DWTS will BOOT OFF TWO couples right from the start. I think it's a good strategy: Distribute the humiliation of being the \"first to go\" among four people!\n\nHere's all the Stars from previous seasons, their partners, and the order in which they were eliminated and humiliated:\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nDancing with the Stars Season Six\n\nOrder of Elimination:\n\nPenn Jillette, Magician & Kym Johnson — 1st male Star eliminated\n\nMonica Seles, retired Tennis Player & Jonathan Roberts — 1st female Star eliminated\n\nSteve Guttenberg, Actor & Anna Trebunskaya — 3rd\n\nAdam Carolla, Comedian & Julianne Hough — 4th\n\nPriscilla Presley, Actress & Louis van Amstel — 5th\n\nMarlee Matlin, Actress & Fabian Sanchez — 6th\n\nShannon Elizabeth, Actress & Derek Hough — 7th\n\nMario, Singer & Karina Smirnoff — 8th\n\nMarissa Jaret Winokur, Broadway Actress & Tony Dovolani — 9th\n\nCristian de la Fuente, Actor & Cheryl Burke — Third Place\n\nJason Taylor, NFL Football player & Edyta Sliwinska — Second Place\n\nKristi Yamaguchi, Olympic Figure Skater & Mark Ballas — DWTS Season 6 Winners\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nDancing with the Stars Season Five\n\nOrder of Elimination:\n\nJosie Maran, Model & Alec Mazo — 1st couple eliminated\n\nAlbert Reed, Model & Anna Trebunskaya — 2nd\n\nWayne Newton, Entertainer & Cheryl Burke — 3rd\n\nFloyd Mayweather, Boxing Champion & Karina Smirnoff — 4th\n\nMark Cuban, Billionaire Entrepreneur & Kym Johnson — 5th\n\nSabrina Bryan, Cheetah Girls member & Mark Ballas — 6th\n\nJane Seymour, Actress & Tony Dovolani — 7th\n\nCameron Mathison, Soap Actor & Edyta Sliwinska — 8 th\n\nJennie Garth, Actress & Derek Hough — 9th\n\nMarie Osmond, Entertainer & Jonathan Roberts — Third Place\n\nMel B, Spice Girls member & Maksim Chmerkovskiy — Second Place\n\nHelio Castroneves, Indy 500 Champion & Julianne Hough — DWTS Season 5 Winners\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nDancing with the Stars — Season Four\n\nOrder of Elimination:\n\nPaulina Porizkova, Supermodel Alec Mazo — 1st couple eliminated\n\nShandi Finnessey, former Miss USA & Brian Fortuna — 2nd\n\nLeeza Gibbons, Talk show host & Tony Dovolani — 3rd\n\nClyde Drexler, Retired NBA player & Elena Grinenko — 4th\n\nHeather Mills, Charity Campaigner & Jonathan Roberts — 5th\n\nJohn Ratzenberger, Actor & Edyta Sliwinska — 6th\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus Country Singer and Actor Karina Smirnoff — 7th\n\nIan Ziering, Actor & Cheryl Burke — 8th\n\nLaila Ali, Boxing World Champion & Maksim Chmerkovskiy — Third Place\n\nJoey Fatone, 'N Sync Member & Kym Johnson — Second Place\n\nApolo Anton Ohno, Olympic Gold Medalist & Julianne Hough — DWTS Season 4 Winners\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nDancing with the Stars — Season Three\n\nOrder of Elimination:\n\nTucker Carlson, Political Pundit & Elena Grinenko — 1st couple eliminated\n\nShanna Moakler, Former Miss USA & Jesse DeSoto — 2nd\n\nHarry Hamlin, Actor & Ashly DelGrosso — 3rd\n\nVivica A.
