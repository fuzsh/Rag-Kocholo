        "text": "Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy have reached a significant milestone in their relationship.\n\nOn Monday, Murgatroyd celebrated seven years of marriage with Chmerkovskiy by sharing a nostalgic throwback photo from their wedding on Instagram.\n\n\"I guess the 7th year itch didn't happen?? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhaha!\" Murgatroyd wrote in her caption. \"I ‚ô•Ô∏è you @maksimc. 7 years married & 10 years together. Thank you for flirting with me way back in 2012 and putting the moves on me to get us 3 children, a dog, and a beautiful life.\"\n\nThe couple's love story began in 2012 when they were both professional dancers on Dancing With the Stars. Over the years, their relationship blossomed, leading to the birth of their first child, Shai Aleksander, in January 2017, and a fairytale wedding in July of the same year.\n\nIn June 2023, the couple welcomed their second son, Rio John, further enriching their family life. This seventh year of marriage holds special significance as they prepare to welcome their third child.\n\nIn February, Murgatroyd joyfully announced her pregnancy. By March, the couple revealed they were expecting another boy. In a recent fun video of them dancing, they captioned, \"Counting down the days. Incoming fam of 5 VERY SOON (6 if we include Hachi).\"\n\nChmerkovskiy, 44, brought his and Murgatroyd's son, Shai, to the Hollywood premiere of The Garfield Movie in May, and he spoke with ET about how he tries to prioritize his kids.\n\n\"I mean, it's always a dad opportunity. If I'm not gonna be away and if I'm at home, I don't justify not spending my every waking moment with him,\" Chmerkovskiy said. \"Because then it's easier for me to go and do my stuff [too].\"\n\n\"I'm taking the opportunity that Peta's pregnant and can't do these things to pile on points,\" Chmerkovskiy said of taking Shai to the red carpet premiere. \"Because at some point, it's an uneven game. [And] I want to be ingrained in their core memory, [and go,] 'This is what we did with dad.'\"\n\nWhen it comes to the question of whether he's ready to be a father of three, Chmerkovskiy quipped, \"Are you ever?\"\n\n\"But now I'm definitely entering an elite club,\" he added with a laugh.\n\nLooking toward the future with regards to their careers, Chmerkovskiy said, \"We have other stuff going on outside of the TV arena that we're very excited about, [but] I'm focused on the family.\"\n\nHe added, \"Peta's doing incredible with her avenues and all that, so I get an opportunity to stay at home till further notice.\""
