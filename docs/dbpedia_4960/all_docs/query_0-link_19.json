        "text": "UPDATE: The \"Dancing with the Stars\" 2013 cast official; complete list and dance pro pairings\n\nLooks like former \"American Idol\" star Kellie Pickler will join the cast of \"Dancing with the Stars\" 2013 when the announcement is made official Tuesday morning on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nAt least several media sources are citing leaked reports that Kellie Pickler, as well as Wynonna Judd, \"Bachelor\" Sean Lowe and Olympian Aly Raisman will be announced on GMA tomorrow morning.\n\nWe know for sure one name is confirmed: Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Jacoby Jones.\n\nHis name came up during Sunday night's Oscars show in a promo for the \"DWTS\" cast announcement.\n\nJones, who ran back a punt return in the Ravens’ Super Bowl victory over the 49ers, told Jimmy Kimmel two weeks ago he’d do the show if asked.\n\n\"The audience will love his outgoing personality, as long as he doesn't stink doing ballroom,\" according to an article in the Washington Times.\n\nA total of 12 contestants will be announced on Tuesday morning. \"GMA\" airs from 7-9 a.m.\n\nIn other \"DWTS\" news, it is rumored that hunky pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy will not return. However, his equally hunky brother Val Chmerkovskiy will return.\n\nMaksim danced with Kirstie Alley in last season's \"All-Stars\" edition, and Val danced with Season 15's third place contestant Kelly Monaco.\n\nAlso, professional dancer Chelsea Hightower reports she was not asked back this season.\n\nThe Season 16 \"DWTS\" premiere is at 8 p.m. March 18. The first results show elimination is at 9 p.m. March 26."
