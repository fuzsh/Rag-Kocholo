        "text": "Professional dancer Maksim Chmerkovskiy set the ballroom ablaze on last night’s episode of ‘Dancing with the Stars’ when he accused head judge Len Goodman of offering inconsistent and confusing feedback.\n\nChmerkovskiy and his partner women’s soccer player Hope Solo have plateaued in their judges’ scores and received harsh criticism in recent weeks. When Goodman told the pair their rumba to “Seasons of Love” from\n\nwas “your worst dance of the whole season,” Chmerkovskiy lost it.\n\n“Everybody is putting in an effort who’s sitting up there on that balcony,” Chmerkovskiy said. “They’re dying, killing themselves over your judgmental comments.”\n\nAfter Goodman fired back that he had been in the profession for 50 years, the shouting among Chmerkovskiy and the judges became unintelligible and host Tom Bergeron ushered Solo and Chmerkovskiy to the balcony to receive their scores.\n\nThe results were rough – a combined judges score of 20, the pair’s lowest in weeks. Only author and activist Chaz Bono, the transgendered son of Cher and Sonny Bono, received a lower score for a lackluster Phantom of the Opera-inspired tango.\n\nDuring a question-answer session with host Brooke Burke Charvet, Chmerkovskiy elaborated on his frustration with the judges’ feedback.\n\n“This is my show. I’ve helped make it what it is,” Chmerkovskiy said. “I love every professional and every celebrity that’s been here, but I’m a little tired we’re being judges some on effort and being on for heel leads.”\n\nThough Solo stayed silent throughout most of the exchange, she told Burke Charvet she was disappointed in the judges’ scores because last night was the first night she went out and danced comfortably without fear of the crowd or the lights.\n\nConsidering Solo’s low judges scores and Bono’s popularity in spite of low judges scores, it will be a nail-biter to see of Solo and Chmerkovskiy get sent home tonight. It certainly seems that the judges let their personal contention with Chmerkovskiy influence their scores for the pair.\n\nControversy and another mediocre performance from Bono and his partner Lacey Schwimmer aside, former talk show host Ricki Lake and military veteran J.R. Martinez finished the night tied for first place on the leader board, both having received two 10s for the first time in the competition.\n\nLake and her partner Derek Hough earned praise for the “impeccable style” and “outstanding choreography they displayed in their quick step to “Luck Be a Lady” from Guys and Dolls.\n\n“You fit like a glove o the score of one of the greatest American musicals,” judge Bruno Tonioli said. “You’re interpretation of the music was beyond belief.”\n\nThe judges complimented Martinez and his partner Karina Smirnoff for performing a quick step that would have “made Bob Fosse proud,” judge Carrie Ann Inaba said.\n\nTune in tonight at 9 p.m. to see if viewers do enough to keep Chmerkovskiy and Solo afloat in the competition.\n\n• Chaz Bono and Lacey Schwimmer – 19\n\n• David Arquette and Kym Johnson – 23\n\n• Hope Solo and Maksim Chmerkovskiy – 20\n\n• J.R. Martinez and Karina Smirnoff – 29\n\n• Nancy Grace and Tristan MacManus – 24\n\n• Ricki Lake and Derek Hough – 29\n\n• Rob Kardashian and Cheryl Burke – 22\n\n'Dancing With The Stars' recap: Chaz Bono makes his debut (gallery)\n\n'Dancing With The Stars' winner: Hines Ward crowned season 12 champion\n\nChaz Bono, Nancy Grace, Elisabetta Canalis among new 'Dancing With the Stars' cast\n\n'DWTS' producer: Give Chaz Bono a chance to dance"
