        "text": "http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/dancing_with_the_stars_5/2007_Nov_26_maksim_marie\n\nMaksim says unlike Marie, Dancing cast did not “burden people with our personal issues”\n\nMaksim Chmerkovskiy, the dancer who’s partnered with Melanie Brown on Dancing with the Stars 5, says that Marie Osmond is using her personal problems to get sympathy and votes.\n\n“I know first hand that there are a lot of other celebrities on the show who went through somewhat similar situations this season and they decided not to make it public … we decided not to burden people with our personal issues. I think that is why our fan base carries us through because they vote for our dancing not whatever happens in our life,” Maks told Extra. He also said, “I think she represents a lot of women out there with all their problems.”\n\nHe says that she doesn’t deserve to be in the finale. “I think Jennie was better than Marie. Frankly, I think there are a lot of other people better than Marie,” he said. But he expects that “either a cute man or somebody with a huge fan base [will win] and I think Marie has both Helio and Mel’s fan base combined times five.”\n\nMore from the story and video with Maksim:\n\nhttp://extratv.warnerbros.com/2007/11/maksim_chmerkovskiys_no-holds-.php\n\nIt's not like Maks has the perfect partner that's oh so deserving of a win. He's been on the show long enough to know what it's all about. If he didn't want to be a part of it, he could have said no before this season or last season. At least he hasn't been stuck with an old man like Edyta and Kym have multiple times. Or a model that nobody will vote for like Alec. It's not a dance contest, it's never really been a dance contest. Just shut up and work with what you've got or leave the show.\n\nThing is: he is working with what he's got. Marie is the one that's a walking soap opera. ITA with Max. He wants it to be about dancing and so do many other people. He is just saying out loud what MANY are thinking and I think he is totally right! Enough with Marie's drama, fainting, etc. She showed just how horrible a dancer she is last night. Poor Sabrina, Jennie, and even Cameron, for having lost to this woman because of her \"Utah fans\" and her Children's Miracle Network contingent, or whatever she is a spokesperson of...\n\nToo bad that it is her so-called \"dancing\" last night that guaranteed that she will not win. Thank God!\n\nI haven't watched the whole clip yet but based on what he's said and that has been written, something about his candor is re/fresh/ing.\n\nI hear ya. I absolutely loved Anna Trebunskaya's candor [\"Proper Tango?!? It's *Blondie*!!\" ]. It's not simply a dance contest. They sure as heck aren't all being judged based on the same criteria anyway. It's luck-of-the-draw, the order of the dances, the mood swings of the judges, and most importantly (as we've been beat-over-the-head-with this season), fan base. That said, honesty is one thing. Making it personal, insulting others, and just plain shooting your mouth off is not attractive or beneficial. I adore Max. I understand he's probably extremely frustrated. But DWTS is *not* a level playing field. Never was. I see it as a vehicle for non-dance people to see how fantastic and _hard_ competitive ballroom and latin dancing is. Most if not all of the stars have a new respect for it, and many absolutely fall in love with it. So as bummed as I get when a personal favorite unjustly gets the shaft or when the judges are smoking wacky weed , if you look at the big picture, DWTS is still a good thing. I won't be surprised if there is a disappointing result tonight, but along the way at least I got to see some kick-@ss dancing\n\nBut Maks has benefitted from the \"reality\" as well. The judges have gone on and on about how wonderful Mel's technique was when she was being obviously dragged around. ABC wanted her in the finale (at least once they lost Sabrina they did) and they did what they had to do to get her in the finale through the judges scores. He's not the only one that's been on the show for multiple seasons without a win. He at least gets strong women. (Who can learn multiple routines with only a couple hours of practice and can bring their own choreographers in to for freestyle routines.) Jonathan got an always unpopular supermodel, a news anchor, a one legged woman who's hated by Beatle's fans and an old woman. He could whine too, but he made the most of what he's got.\n\nYou can't take the benefits of the reality game and then whine the reality game doesn't go your way. Maybe Maks should go and be the next Bachelor. There's a reality show where he could get the perks without too many things to complain about.\n\nYou can't take the benefits of the reality game and then whine the reality game doesn't go your way. Maybe Maks should go and be the next Bachelor. There's a reality show where he could get the perks without too many things to complain about.\n\nOMG, that would be perfect for Max! I could totally see him on the show now. :lol:\n\nWe don't know that yet. Stranger things have happened, and this is reality tv.\n\nActually, we can be pretty sure of it. Marie would have to come in first in viewer votes to not be in third place. Granted, that is possible. But then the final two have a dance off for the judges. I can't recall from past finals whether the judges' scores actually count in determining the winner of if they are just for show. But, I think it is highly unlikely that Marie can win this thing. Oh, and one more thing: When Len was so mean to Helio last night, I think he guaranteed him a lot of sympathy votes. Len knows what happens when he disses someone, and I think he wants Helio to win. For sure, even if that doesn't happen, the \"attitude\" he got from Len gave him a BIG boost.\n\nSo what's going on exactly for tonight? Someone gets the boot then the final two couples dance and the judges get to pick the overall winner? That's different, and probably for the best, not that I even care at this point.\n\nI wonder if this was always the case. Or did ABC change the rules as the finale approached? Was it done this way back in May during season 4?\n\nNo, the person who gets the lowest number of votes combines with judges' scores, gets eliminated right away. Then it's between two couples who dance again but as far as I can tell the judge's comments on those dances, are just that, comments, no? Aren't the results basically already set given how they placed last night and with the viewers?\n\nThe reason I said Marie will not win is because even if she got the highest number of votes, she was 3rd with the judges. This is the opposite of what happened to Stacy Kiebler and we all know what place she got - 3rd... She had the highest score from the judges and the lowest number of votes...\n\nThe reason I said Marie will not win is because even if she got the highest number of votes, she was 3rd with the judges.
