        "text": "Dancing with the Stars is an American reality television show in which celebrity contestants and professional dance partners compete to be the best dancers, as determined by the show's judges and public voting. The series first broadcast in 2005, and thirty-one complete seasons have aired. During each season, competitors are progressively eliminated on the basis of public voting and scores received from the judges until only a few contestants remain. These finalists participate in a finale, from which a winner is determined.[1] Celebrities appearing on Dancing with the Stars include \"actors, singers, comedians, musicians, entrepreneurs, athletes, reality stars, journalists, TV presenters, internet personalities, newsmakers, and where-are-they-now personalities\".[2]\n\nAs of season 32, 381 celebrities have competed. Eleven of those withdrew from the competition: Sara Evans of season three left the show to \"give her family full attention\" after filing for divorce; Misty May-Treanor of season seven was forced to pull out after an ankle injury; Tom DeLay of season nine reportedly withdrew \"due to stress fractures in both of his feet\"; Dorothy Hamill of season sixteen withdrew due to a previous injury that was unrelated to the competition; Billy Dee Williams of season eighteen quit due to a back injury; Kim Zolciak-Biermann of season twenty-one was forced to withdraw after suffering a mini-stroke, which although cleared her to dance, prevented her from flying to California from Atlanta; Tamar Braxton, also of season twenty-one, withdrew due to pulmonary embolisms in her lungs; Christie Brinkley of season twenty-eight withdrew on the day of the season premiere due to an injury to her arm that required surgery; she was replaced by her daughter Sailor; Ray Lewis, also of season twenty-eight, withdrew due to a toe injury sustained during rehearsals; Jeannie Mai of season twenty-nine withdrew due to being hospitalized for epiglottitis; and Selma Blair of season thirty-one withdrew when it became too risky to continue dancing due to her multiple sclerosis.[3][4][5]\n\nForty-nine professional dancers have partnered with the celebrities. The thirty-one winners of the show, in chronological order, are Kelly Monaco, Drew Lachey, Emmitt Smith, Apolo Anton Ohno, HÃ©lio Castroneves, Kristi Yamaguchi, Brooke Burke, Shawn Johnson, Donny Osmond, Nicole Scherzinger, Jennifer Grey, Hines Ward, J. R. Martinez, Donald Driver, Melissa Rycroft, Kellie Pickler, Amber Riley, Meryl Davis, Alfonso Ribeiro, Rumer Willis, Bindi Irwin, Nyle DiMarco, Laurie Hernandez, Rashad Jennings, Jordan Fisher, Adam Rippon, Bobby Bones, Hannah Brown, Kaitlyn Bristowe, Iman Shumpert, Charli D'Amelio, and Xochitl Gomez. The nineteen professional partners who have won, in chronological order by first win, are Alec Mazo, Cheryl Burke (twice), Julianne Hough (twice), Mark Ballas (three times), Derek Hough (six times), Kym Johnson (twice), Karina Smirnoff, Peta Murgatroyd (twice), Tony Dovolani, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Witney Carson, Valentin Chmerkovskiy (three times), Emma Slater, Lindsay Arnold, Jenna Johnson,
