        "text": "LOS ANGELES\n\nAnd at the end of the night, NeNe Leakes was sent home in the latest elimination. Leakes and her partner, Tony Dovolani, lasted for seven weeks on this tough season and the elimination hit her hard.\n\nGet a full dance-by-dance recap of this week's 'Dancing With The Stars'\n\n\"I just wanted us to go, you know, I just wanted Tony to go as far as he could go, but I'm very proud of myself. I went more than half the way, so I'm so proud of myself,\" Leakes said through tears.\n\nRicky Martin sat at the judges' table this week scoring the individual dances and, later, the team dances that were set to his music. Team Vida scored 35 and Team Loca scored 39.\n\n\"They brought entertainment to another level, which is very exciting - and with my music. [I was] very happy to be part of the show and to see, to feel the energy in that studio. It's very magical. I really enjoyed it,\" said Martin.\n\nTeam Loca's high score came from the dress rehearsal performance because Purdy wasn't able to dance. She was taken to the hospital for shoulder and back concerns following her Rumba. Purdy will let us know more about her health sometime Tuesday. She landed second on the judges' leaderboard this week.\n\nMeryl Davis and Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who Salsa-ed their way to a near perfect score, are once again in first after a very demanding week.\n\n\"She's bionic, dude. She just goes. I don't know where this comes from,\" said Chmerkovskiy. \"I'm exhausted. I'm tired. I just want to sleep and be held.\"\n\nSee photos from all the action in week 7 of \"Dancing With The Stars\"\n\nClimbing to third place this week: Candace Cameron Bure and Mark Ballas. Smack dab in the middle: the rib-injured, but determined, Danica McKellar and Val Chmerkovskiy. They're followed by Charlie White and Sharna Burgess. At the bottom of the leaderboard are James Maslow and Peta Murgatroyd.\n\nAbby Lee Miller from \"Dance Moms\" will be next week's guest judge."
