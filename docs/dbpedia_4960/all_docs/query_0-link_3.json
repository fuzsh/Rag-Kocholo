        "text": "The actress and her pro partner won season 32 in 2023! The two closed out the finale with a truly epic freestyle that felt like a culmination of everything they'd brought to the stage throughout the season. The dance earned chanting and a standing ovation, as well as another perfect score -- marking the fourth perfect score they'd received in a row that season.\n\nTheir performances earned them the first Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy.\n\nIman made DWTS history in Season 30 when he became the first NBA player to make it to the finals and then doubled down when he and Daniella were named the new champions. The whole season came down to Iman and Daniella and the season-long frontrunners JoJo Siwa and Jenna Johnson. After both couples delivered back-to-back flawless performances, it really was a clash of the dancing titans. However, Iman and Daniella came out victorious.\n\n\"Hats off to the work that we put in,\" Shumpert told ET's Lauren Zima after their big win. \"I think we just put in a lot of hours and when it was time to perform, it got easy.\"\n\nThis also marked the first win for the dance pro as well, and while Shumpert said he \"couldn't be happier\" to take home the trophy, Karagach told ET that she couldn't think of someone \"more deserving\" to take home DWTS top honor than the former basketball star.\n\nBobby and Sharna shocked the world when they were crowned the champions, beating out Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch and Keo Motsepe, Disney Channel star Milo Manheim and Witney Carson, and Instagram star Alexis Ren and Alan Bersten.\n\nDespite weeks of less-than-stellar scores, the pair got a ton of viewer votes and fan support, which propelled them to victory. The exciting win was so surprising that even Bobby and Sharna admitted they hard a hard time wrapping their heads around it.\n\n\"We were shocked,\" Bones told ET's Katie Krause after the show. \"I cannot believe we won.\"\n\nThe victory also marked Burgess' first Mirrorball trophy in 12 straight seasons on DWTS, and the talented pro said she already knew what she planned to do with the award: \"I think I'm probably going to hold it for quite awhile. It's really heavy, my arms are gonna be an amazing shape... [but] I'm gonna bring it with me everywhere for awhile.\"\n\nThe Olympic figure skater and his pro partner took home the coveted Mirrorball trophy after four weeks of intense rehearsals and competitions in this all-athletes season of DWTS.\n\nRippon and Johnson faced off against NFL star Josh Norman and his pro partner Sharna Burgess, as well as Tonya Harding and her partner, Sasha Farber. And while all three couples danced their hearts out in the finals, Rippon and Johnson's season-long flawlessness earned them the big win.\n\nSpeaking with ET's Cameron Mathison after the finale, #TeamJustFriends opened up about their victory, and the life-long bond they've forged during their time together on the show.\n\n\"This has been such an incredible experience, just pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, and more than that, getting to meet somebody who I'm gonna be friends with for the rest of my life,\" Rippon shared.\n\nThe Hamilton star and his dedicated pro partner took home the coveted trophy after a tough season of competition.\n\nIn the last night of the finals, Fisher and Arnold beat out Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas -- the season's runner-ups -- as well as third place finishers Frankie Muniz and Witney Carson.\n\nThe former Disney Channel star and his partner performed two flawless routines -- first a samba, and then a salsa/paso doble fusion -- both of which earned them perfect 30s in the final night of competition.\n\nIt was also announced during the show that both Fisher and Muniz will be joining the DWTS winter tour, Dancing with the Stars: Live! - Light Up the Night, alongside their partners and some of the show's most popular pros.\n\nFresh off her impressive victories at the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with Team USA, the gymnast -- who won silver on the balance beam and gold in the women's team all-around -- returned to the United States just in time to compete for season 23 of the hit dance competition show. A standout from the beginning, Hernandez beat out former NFL pro Calvin Johnson and IndyCar racer James Hinchcliffe during the finals on Nov. 22, 2016.\n\n\"I'm just so excited I was able to have this opportunity,\" she told ET of her win. \"Even beyond the show, I just feel like i really sprouted as a person and I've surrounded myself with so many amazing people that I can now call family so, that's cool.\"\n\nNext up, the 16-year-old athlete will be joining her pro partner on the Dancing With the Stars! Live tour, which kicks off Dec. 19, 2016 in Reno, Nevada."
