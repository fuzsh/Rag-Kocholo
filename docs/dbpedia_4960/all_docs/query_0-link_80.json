        "text": "LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The contestants on \"Dancing With The Stars\" danced to some of the greatest party anthems of all time on Monday night.\n\nComedian and game show host Drew Carey survived six weeks of ballroom dancing competition. He and partner Cheryl Burke began their adventure with a Foxtrot, got their best scores for their Cha Cha, and ended it all with a Tango.\n\n\"I was really glad I did it and I was really glad to have this little journey with Cheryl. She was great the whole time,\" said Carey. \"It was great. Hats off to her. She pulled off a miracle every week teaching me how to dance. Honestly, she's a miracle worker.\"\n\nBurke said she enjoyed their time together.\n\n\"I grew up kind of watching him, so to be able to dance with him and learn from him and how generous and kind he is, it's pretty amazing,\" Burke said.\n\nNow that his \"Dancing\" days are done, I asked if he would be using this in his stand-up comedy.\n\n\"Yeah, I already have a 'Dancing With The Stars' bit. It's about two minutes, three minutes long. It'll probably end up being about 10 minutes of my act eventually,\" said Carey.\n\nHe gave us a small preview: \"Many of you have seen me on 'Dancing With The Stars,' or as I like to call it, 'Dancing with women who are way out of your league.\"\n\nThe remaining teams had to skip the press line to immediately rehearse for next week's team dances.\n\nAs it stands for this week, Meryl Davis and Maksim Chmerkovskiy are in first place with a perfect score for their Tango. Amy Purdy and Derek Hough are a close second with 38 points for their Jive.\n\nDanica McKellar and Val Chmerkovskiy are tied for third with Charlie White and Sharna Burgess. They're followed by James Maslow and Peta Murgatroyd, NeNe Leakes and Tony Dovolani, and then Candace Cameron Bure and Mark Ballas.\n\nLMFAO front man Redfoo appeared on the show this week as a guest judge, alongside usual show judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba.\n\nNext week is Latin week with guest judge and performer Ricky Martin."
