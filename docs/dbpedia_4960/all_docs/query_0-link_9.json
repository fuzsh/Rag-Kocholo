        "text": "Season 32: Xochitl Gomez and Val Chmerkovskiy\n\nMarvel actress Xochitl Gomez win season 32 of “Dancing with the Stars” on December 5, 2023, besting finalists Jason Mraz, Ariana Madix, Charity Lawson and Alyson Hannigan. She was the front-runner by the end of the season and was at the top of the judges’ leaderboard for most weeks of the competition.\n\nHer pro partner Val Chmerkovskiy won for the third time, tying him with Mark Ballas as the second most decorated pro dancer in the show’s history behind Derek Hough. This was his 19th season on the show. He previously won with Rumer Willis in season 20 and Laurie Hernandez in season 23. And he was a finalist six other times.\n\nSeason 31: Charli D’Amelio and Mark Ballas\n\nTikTok star Charli D’Amelio win season 31 of “Dancing with the Stars” on November 21, 2022, besting finalists Gabby Windey, Wayne Brady, and Shangela. She was the front-runner by the end of the season and was at the top of the judges’ leaderboard every single week of the competition.\n\nHer pro partner Mark Ballas won for the third time, making him the second most decorated pro dancer in the show’s history behind Derek Hough. This was his 20th season on the show, though his first in five years. He previously won with Kristi Yamaguchi in season six and Shawn Johnson in season eight. And he was a finalist seven other times.\n\nSeason 30: Iman Shumpert and Daniella Karagach\n\nBasketball player Iman Shumpert won season 30 of “Dancing with the Stars” on November 22, 2021, besting finalists JoJo Siwa, Cody Rigsby and Amanda Kloots. It was an upset since Siwa led our racetrack odds for most of the season. Shumpert was the first basketball player ever to claim the Mirror Ball Trophy.\n\nHis pro partner Daniella Karagach was a first-time winner. This was just her second season on the show and the second time he made it to the finals. She had previously finished third with Nelly in season 29.\n\nSeason 29: Kaitlyn Bristowe and Artem Chigvintsev\n\n“The Bachelorette” star Kaitlyn Bristowe won season 29 of “Dancing with the Stars” on November 23, 2020, besting finalists Justina Machado, Nelly, and Nev Schulman. It was an upset since Machado and Schulman led our racetrack odds for most of the season.\n\nHer pro partner Artem Chigvintsev was a first-time winner. This was his ninth season of the show and the first time he made it to the finals, let alone won. His previous personal bests had been sixth place finishes with Lea Thompson (season 19) and Nancy Kerrigan (season 24). But Chigvintsev had previously won the British version of the show, “Strictly Come Dancing.”\n\nSeason 28: Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten\n\n“The Bachelorette” star Hannah Brown won season 28 of “Dancing with the Stars” on November 25, 2019, besting finalists Kel Mitchell, Ally Brooke and Lauren Alaina. It was a bit of an upset considering that the front-runner for most of the season, James Van Der Beek, was eliminated in the Semi-Finals. But Brown was the only celeb who never at risk of elimination.\n\nHer pro partner Alan Bersten was a first-time winner. This was only his fourth season on the show, following his partnerships with Debbie Gibson (12th place in season 25), Mirai Nagasu (fourth place in season 26) and Alexis Ren (fourth place in season 27).\n\nSeason 27: Bobby Bones & Sharna Burgess\n\nCountry radio personality Bobby Bones won season 27 of “Dancing with the Stars” on November 19, 2018. It was arguably the biggest upset in “DWTS” history; he bested finalists Milo Manheim, Evanna Lynch, and Alexis Ren, who all had markedly highers scores. In fact, Bones was only the eighth best contestant based on judges’ scores.\n\nHis pro partner Sharna Burgess was a first-time winner. This was her 12th season on the show, but her very first Mirror Ball victory after previously reaching the finals with Noah Galloway (season 20), Nick Carter (season 21), James Hinchcliffe (season 23) and Josh Norman (season 26).\n\nSeason 26: Adam Rippon & Jenna Johnson\n\nAdam Rippon won the special four-week ‘Dancing with the Stars: Athletes’ season on May 21, 2018. He’s the third figure skater to prevail, following Kristi Yamaguchi (season 6) and Meryl Davis (season 18), and he’s the first male figure skater to pull off a victory.\n\nHis pro partner Jenna Johnson was a first-time winner. This was only her second time competing as a pro on ‘DWTS.’ She previously competed in season 23 with Jake T. Austin, but they were the first team eliminated, finishing in 13th place.\n\nSeason 25: Jordan Fisher & Lindsay Arnold\n\nBroadway star Jordan Fisher made history when he became the show’s 25th Mirror Ball champion. He’s the youngest male winner to date at age 23, and he received more perfect scores than any other contestant in history (nine).\n\nThis was the first Mirror Ball victory for his partner Lindsay Arnold, whose previous best finish was second place in season 24 with David Ross.\n\nSeason 24: Rashad Jennings & Emma Slater\n\nFootball player Rashad Jennings became the fourth football player to win the Mirror Ball Trophy, following Emmitt Smith, Hines Ward and Donald Driver. He topped the judges’ leaderboard for three out of the 10 weeks of competition.\n\nThis was the first Mirror Ball victory for his partner Emma Slater, whose previous best finish was fourth place in season 17 with Bill Engvall.\n\nSeason 23: Laurie Hernandez & Val Chmerkovskiy\n\nGymnast Laurie Hernandez made history. Mere months after winning a gold medal with the “Final Five” at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she became the youngest Mirror Ball Trophy winner of all time at age 16. She topped the judges’ leaderboard for six out of the 11 weeks of competition.\n\nThis was the second Mirror Ball victory for her partner Val Chmerkovskiy, who previously won season 20 with Rumer Willis. It also put Val one win ahead of his big brother Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who only won the Mirror Ball once in his “DWTS” career.\n\nSeason 22: Nyle DiMarco & Peta Murgatroyd\n\nNyle DiMarco made history by winning season 22 of “Dancing with the Stars” on March 24, 2016. The model is the first deaf contestant to win the prize, and he’s the first winner since Donald Driver in season 14 to win the title without getting the highest score in the finals.\n\nDiMarco and Driver were both partnered with Peta Murgatroyd, who is now a two-time winner and the sixth pro dancer to win multiple seasons of the show, but she’s still got a long way to go if she wants to catch all-time record-holder Derek Hough with six wins.\n\nSeason 21: Bindi Irwin & Derek Hough\n\nAfter eight times on top of the judges’ leaderboard (nine if you count her perfect score in the final Fusion Challenge), Bindi Irwin took the season 21 title.\n\nHer win was historic in a couple of ways. At age 17, Irwin is now one of the youngest champs in the show’s history. Irwin’s victory also brought Derek Hough his sixth title as a pro dancer, extending his record as the show’s most awarded pro."
