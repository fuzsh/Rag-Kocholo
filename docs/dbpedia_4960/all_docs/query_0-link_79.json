        "text": "The former Bachelorette and the Jersey Shore starstoked dating rumors during their time competing against one another on season 31, thanks to their flirtations on social media and coy responses when asked about their possible romance.\n\n\"You get to know the other celebrities on Dancing with the Stars,\" Gabby told E! News last December. \"So, we formed a friendship right away and I feel like our senses of humor are really similar. I was so tunnel vision during the competition. I was like, 'I'm here to win' and I didn't have room for anything else. So, we live in different states, but we are having fun. We'll see.\"\n\nShowmance or Real Deal: Forget GTL, this one was DOA. The pair never ended up officially dating and Gabby debuted her romance with comedian and TV writer Robby Hoffman in August.\n\nWhile she was partnered with Hayes Grier, the two hit it off during season 21's Switch Up week, with Alek calling her \"so hot.\" After her elimination, Emma spilled that she and Alek had yet to go on a date, saying, \"We'll see.\"\n\nShowmance or Real Deal: Given Alek's tendency to blush and avoid answering questions about his feelings for Emma, telling E! News \"no comment!\" we think this crush was very real. But Emma danced away off the market following Skarlatos' 2015 run, so if it was real, it wasn't that real.\n\nWhich bring us to these two. After dating a little on and off since 2011, the pros got engaged live on the show in October 2016, and were married in March 2018. However, in Aug. 2022, E! News confirmed that after four years of marriage, Slater and Farber were going their separate ways.\n\nShowmance or Real Deal? Despite the outcome, they were still the real deal and have remained close friends and cordial co-stars after their split.\n\n\"It's not a nightmare at all,\" Emma exclusively told E! News in October. \"We support each other so much that I want the very best for Sasha. We support each other, very, very truly.\"\n\nVal and Jenna were dating in 2015, before she was promoted to pro dancer. They got engaged in June of 2018 before making it official and walking down the aisle in April of 2019. In July 2022, they announced they were expecting their first baby together. The two welcomed son Rome Valentin in January 2023.\n\n\"Life is awesome,\" Val told E! News in May. Becoming a dad \"definitely elevated my joy for life, my joy for my family, and every day I learn something new being a father.\"\n\nShowmance or Real Deal? Real deal, y'all!\n\nIn December 2020, E! News learned the Selling Sunset star was dating the Dancing With the Stars pro after they had competed separately on season 29.\n\nHowever, after two months of dating, E! News exclusively confirmed they had called it quits. At the time, a source close to the realtor said, \"They had a fun time together but in the end, decided it would be best if they part ways. They are still friendly and cordial. It wasn't a messy breakup, just wasn't the right fit or right timing.\"\n\nChrishell has since found love with partner G Flip.\n\nShowmance or Real Deal: We're calling Chrishell and Keo's romance the real deal.\n\nModel Alexis and relatively new pro Alan flirted up a storm throughout season 27, and Ren had admitted on the show that she had a crush on him. At the time, a source even told E! News that they \"really enjoy each other's company\" and were \"seeing where things go.\"\n\nShowmance or Real Deal? All for the cameras, unfortunately. Multiple outlets reported their split in December 2018, blaming it on long-distance and demanding schedules.\n\nSoon after the Shark Tank star announced he was separating from his wife of 14 years Diane Plese, sources confirmed to E! News that he and Kym Johnson, his pro partner from season 20, were dating and \"really happy together.\"\n\nWhile Robert and Kym at first played coy about the nature of their relationship, that quickly stopped. They were engaged in February 2016, married by June 2016, and welcomed twins in April 2018.\n\nShowmance or Real Deal: Very very very real.\n\nAfter showing off their insane chemistry during the sixth season, the duo dated for nearly a year before announcing their 2009 breakup in the most cordial way ever: matching tweets! \"Hi everyone, we wanted you all to know directly from us, that Shannon & I have decided to end our relationship as boyfriend & girlfriend...,\" Derek tweeted that August. Finished Shannon, \"However, we love and care about each other very much and will remain friends and in each others lives.\"\n\nDerek is now married to his dance partner Hayley Erbert.\n\nShowmance or Real Deal: Real deal.\n\nOne of DWTS' most playful pairings, rumors continued about their relationship for all of season 10, and they weren't doing anything to stop them! Seriously, they staged an almost-kiss on a bed for one of their finale performances. Their banter continued eight cycles later when Erin signed on as the show's co-host.\n\nErin is now married to Jarret Stoll.\n\nShowmance or Real Deal: We're calling those Erin and Maks rumors a showmance."
