        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Kirstie Alley, Ralph Macchio, Chelsea Kane and Hines Ward have cha-cha’d, tangoed, waltzed and jived their way through 10 weeks of competition on “Dancing With the Stars,“ but one of them will fall short of the finals.\n\nOne celebrity hoofer will be dismissed during tonight’s episode. The remaining three will compete for the mirrorball trophy next week on the hit ABC show.\n\nJudges’ scores are combined with viewer votes to determine who is eliminated from the competition each week, and Kane scored a coup in the points department yesterday: The actress and her professional partner, Mark Ballas, won the show’s first “winner-take-all cha-cha,“ boosting their night’s total by 15 points.\n\nThey come into today’s episode with a leaderboard-topping 73 points.\n\nFootball star Ward and partner Kym Johnson have the second highest score, and it’s a perfect one. They earned a flawless 60 points yesterday for their spunky salsa and emotional Argentine tango.\n\nAlley and her partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, come into the results show in third place with 54 points, after collecting 27 points for each of their two dances yesterday. Macchio and partner Karina Smirnoff are heading into the semifinal showdown in last place with 48 points.\n\nA new “Dancing“ champ will be crowned on May 24."
