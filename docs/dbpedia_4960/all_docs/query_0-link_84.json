On Saturday night in Miami, former Dancing With the Stars pro (and season-18 winner) Maksim Chermkovskiy proposed to his longtime girlfriend, current DWTS pro Peta Murgatroyd. The exciting moment happened during the third night of performances at SWAY: A Dance Trilogy, which is produced by Maks, his brother, Val, and fellow DWTS pro Tony Dovolani. Also in attendance: Maks' season-18 partner, Meryl Davis, as well as Val's season 20 partner, Rumer Willis. While standing in front of a screaming crowd of thousands (and still in their show costumes), Maks announced to Peta, \"I'm in love with you, and I want to be in love with you for the rest of my life.\" Then he got down on one knee to propose. Minutes later, Maks posted a photo of the special moment on his Instagram page, with the caption: \"She said yes.\" She said 'yes' @petamurgatroyd A photo posted by @maksimc on Dec 5, 2015 at 8:02pm PST Even better though?

You have my brother's loyalty, heart, his one and only for the rest of his life. You're family now and that makes you my sister, the second most important woman in my life. What's mine is yours. Forever and always. Petachka your team got numbers now. #trapqueenfolife #famovereverything\"\n\nEarlier this year, Maks exclusively told Glamour that his relationship with Peta (who he's dated on and off previously) worked because \"we're older and time's passed.\" As a sign that things were getting more serious, Peta also confided that Maks would be accompanying her on the DWTS tour over the summer (which ended prematurely due to an ankle injury). The couple made no secret about their romance, consistently posting photos of each other at various events and family gatherings.\n\nStay tuned for more photos and details soon! Congrats to the happy couple!"
