        "text": "Everywhere you look! Val and Maks Chmerkovskiy are set to guest star on Netflix’s upcoming Full House revival, Fuller House, a source confirms to Us Weekly.\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars siblings will play the love interests of sisters Stephanie and D.J. Tanner, played by Jodie Sweetin and Candace Cameron Bure, respectively, in one episode. The source also revealed that Val will be playing Sweetin’s love interest, while Maks plays Bure’s romantic interest, and that the four of them had an “amazing time” on set.\n\n“It’s really cute,” the source told Us. “Maks and Val play dancers and dance with sisters DJ and Stephanie in a club.”\n\nIn August, Bure shared a video on Instagram of herself dancing with Val, leading fans to believe it was for a DWTS All Star episode.\n\nWhile big brother Maks has acted before, most memorably in a guest role on General Hospital, this will be Val’s first big role (he played a reality star contestant on IFC’s Comedy Bang! Bang! earlier this year).\n\nThe View co-host Bure, 39, competed on Dancing With the Stars in 2014, finishing in third place with her partner, Mark Ballas.\n\n“I love everyone on the show and I am just a fan of the show,” Bure told Us last year.\n\nFuller House is the eagerly anticipated revival of the hit ‘90s show Full House. Bure and her former TV boyfriend on the show, Scott Weinger, reunited on set last month.\n\nThe 13-episode series premieres on Netflix in 2016."
