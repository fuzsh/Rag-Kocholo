        "text": "The newest cast of \"Dancing with the Stars\" was revealed Thursday, and two titans of New Jersey reality TV will be a part of it. Teresa Giudice of \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" and Vinny Guadagnino of \"Jersey Shore\" fame are among the celebrities who will take the stage in season 31 of the hit dance competition, which premieres Sept. 19, on Disney+.\n\nAmong others joining Paterson native Giudice and Guadagnino are Wayne Brady, Selma Blair and Cheryl Ladd. \"Good Morning America\" revealed the show's new cast, which also includes its former weathercaster (and current WABC-TV weathercaster) Sam Champion.\n\nGiudice and Guadagnino are not the first two New Jersey residents to appear on the show.\n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" Season 23 winner and Olympic gold medal gymnast Laurie Hernandez is from Old Bridge. Season 25 third-place finisher Frankie Muniz, who starred on \"Malcolm in the Middle,\" was born in Wood-Ridge.\n\nUkrainian-born brothers Maksim and Valentin Chmerkovskiy, who have Bergen County connections, were longtime dancers on the show. Maksim and his father, Aleksandr \"Sasha\" Chmerkovskiy, co-founded Dance With Me Studio in Fort Lee. In March, Maksim was in Kyiv when Russia invaded Ukraine and had to escape his native country, recording his harrowing journey back to Los Angeles. Later that month, Sasha launched a massive donation effort for Ukraine in Fort Lee.\n\nMore:'Jersey Shore' star JWoww shares heartwarming photos of son with autism going to school\n\nGiudice, 50, married Luis Ruelas in East Brunswick in August. Teresa previously agreed to divorce terms with her ex-husband, Joe Giudice, who was deported in 2019 to his native country of Italy after serving 41 months in federal prison for fraud. Teresa served 11 months for similar charges in 2015. She has been on \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" since it began in 2008.\n\nMore:Teresa Giudice & Luis Ruelas marry in East Brunswick.
