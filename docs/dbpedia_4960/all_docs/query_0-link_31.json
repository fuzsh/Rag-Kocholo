        "text": "Dancing with the Stars has been a staple of our television screens since it started airing in 2005 with numerous legendary celebs aiming to prove their worth for the Mirrorball Trophy. With such a long history, sadly some of the stars who've appeared on the show have passed on and these stars are remembered in the show's studio, with senior producer Adam Raia previously sharing a memorial star that carried the names of the deceased.\n\nSince the first season aired back in 2005, an astonishing 381 celebs have put their best foot forward with their celebrity partner. Read on for our tributes to those who are sadly no longer with us.\n\nLen Goodman\n\nLen Goodman was head judge on the show since its beginning, and we loved his mannerisms, catchphrases, and of course his iconic uttering of 'SEV-ERN'! At the end of season 31, he said he was retiring and returning to the UK to spend more time with his family. However, the 78-year-old sadly passed away on April 22, 2023 due to bone cancer.\n\nStars from both Dancing with the Stars and sister show Strictly Come Dancing paid tribute, and DWTS host Alfonso Ribeiro has promised a tear-jerking tribute for the late dancer. \"There won't be a dry eye in the house. It'll be amazing. I mean, he was the best,\" he told People.\n\nShannen Doherty\n\nShannen sadly didn't last long on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars, being eliminated first alongside professional partner Mark Ballas. However, she revealed after the show that she had done her dad \"proud\". The Charmed star died on July 13, 2024 following a battle with breast cancer.\n\nPaying tribute to the 53-year-old, judge Carrie Ann Inaba penned: \"She was a warrior and inspired us all. She taught us how to be brave in the face of fear, and how to start a new life, even when the end was in sight. She had a peace in her eyes that I admired. She never gave up living or fighting for her life, even though you could see she had come to terms with her own mortality.\n\n\"The courage it takes to be able to see your own ending while living your life with passion and your warrior spirit front and center is not easyâ€¦ I wish her eternal peace, that she rests easy now, knowing she inspired so many of us.\"\n\nJacoby Jones\n\nNFL star Jacoby Jones made it all the final of season 16 with Karina Smirnoff, ultimately losing out to Kellie Pickler and Derek Hough. Jacoby sadly died at the age of just 40, passing away in his sleep on July 14, 2024.\n\nFollowing the athlete's death, pro dancer Cheryl Burke said: \"Absolutely devastated by the loss of my dear friend and fellow #dwts co-star, Jacoby Jones, who passed away in his sleep early this morning.\n\n\"While we weren't dance partners, I had the honor of sharing unforgettable moments with him, from being part of his trio dance to supporting his cherished foundation. My heart aches for Jacoby and his family. My prayers are with you all. Rest in peace, Jacoby. You will be deeply missed.\"\n\nJerry Springer\n\nIconic chat show host Jerry Springer passed away on April 27, 2023 following a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Jerry appeared on the third season of the show back in 2006 dancing with Kym Johnson, saying he took part so he could learn to waltz for his daughter's upcoming wedding. His dream came true on week 4, where he received a commendable 22/30 for his routine.\n\nPaying tribute to him in an interview with People, Kym said: \"We instantly connected and he became like a father figure to me. I remember going out to dinner with him and his old buddies that used to do the news with him in Cincinnati. The stories they had, it reminded me of the Anchorman movie. It just so sweet listening to them. From being the news anchorman to the mayor to a politician to hosting The Jerry Springer Show, he was fascinating to talk to.\"\n\nCloris Leachman\n\nLegendary actress Cloris Leachman became the oldest contestant to compete in the show's history when she danced on the show's seventh season with professional Corky Ballas. The couple survived all the way up to week 6, and were eliminated after a cha-cha-cha didn't impress.\n\nCloris died at the age of 94 on January 27, 2021 following a stroke in her sleep.\n\nAaron Carter\n\nSinger Aaron Carter competed on the ninth season of Dancing with the Stars, and he and professional partner Karina Smirnoff made it all the way to fifth place and topped the leaderboard in week 2.

You were one of the most unique people I have ever met and easily one of the brightest moments of my personal and professional life.\"\n\nKirstie passed away at the age of 71 on December 5, 2022, after being diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer earlier in the year.\n\nValerie Harper\n\nValerie Harper was best known for her roles on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rhoda, and she competed on the 17th season of the show with Tristan MacManus, with the pair leaving in the third week.

I mean, she suffered from that disease for over 20 years. So the fact that she remained as classy and as beautiful and always with a smile on her face was pretty awesome.\"\n\nMary Wilson\n\nSupremes singer Mary Wilson danced with Brandon Armstrong on the show's 28th season, but they were ultimately the first couple to be eliminated. Mary died in her sleep on February 8, 2021 at the age of 76 from hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a complication from high blood pressure.\n\nAnne Heche\n\nActress Anne Heche appeared on the 29th season of Dancing with the Stars, making it to week 4 with Keo Motsepe.
