        "text": "\"Dancing With the Stars\" professional partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy and ABC are reportedly considering legal action against Olympic star Hope Solo for comments contained in her controversial new memoir, \"Solo: A Memoir of Hope.\"\n\nSolo, who was a contestant last year on the ABC reality series, was highly critical of dancing partner Chmerkovskiy.\n\nIn the book, the soccer star says of Chmerkovskiy, \"He was often nasty, swearing at me and being harshly critical... He manhandled me in rehearsals from the start, pushing me, whacking my stomach, bending my arms roughly.\"\n\nDuring season 13 of the hit show, Chmerkovskiy was fiercely loyal to Solo. He famously clashed with lead judge Len Goodman over criticism he made of Solo's footwork.\n\nABC and Chmerkovskiy have declined to comment on Solo's book, however, Huffington Post reported that the network and the dancer are weighing legal action against Solo.\n\nChmerkovskiy made veiled remarks on Twitter about Solo. \"Always hated hypocrites and liars...but when someone is both AND an opportunist, I just feel bad for them. Can't win at someone's expense.\"\n\nThe outspoken Solo has drawn considerable media attention in recent weeks.\n\nPrior the start of the London Olympics, she spoke candidly to ESPN magazine about sexual hookups and partying with celebrities at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing."
