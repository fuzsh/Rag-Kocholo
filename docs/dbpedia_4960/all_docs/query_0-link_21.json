        "text": "With the third episode of the new season of Dancing With the Stars airing tonight, it’s safe to say the season is gearing up to be one of the best ones yet. And though the season might’ve had a rocky start, dancing pro newcomer Rylee Arnold, reality TV icon Ariana Madix, music superstar Jason Mraz and many others are making the show definitely worth a watch.\n\nSpeaking of must-see contestants to see this season, there’s also Brady Brunch alum Barry Williams, who could be making history as one of the oldest contestants to grace the ballroom. Alongside Williams is DWTS pro, and a new mama of two, Peta Murgatroyd. “He’s the perfect partner for me,” she tells SheKnows of her season 32 dance partner. “He’s such a TV icon. He’s kind, I’m just super proud of him already. He’s just the loveliest human.”\n\nAs for her opinions on the classic sitcom, luckily Murgatroyd was already a big Greg Brady fan. “He was definitely the best Brady,” she says.\n\nNext to her husband, former DWTS pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy, the pair – who share sons Chai, 6, and Rio, 3 months – sat down with SheKnows to look back at their relationship, and some of their best moments from previous seasons. When remembering their favorite dance moment, Chmerkovskiy remembered the couple’s flirty beginning.\n\n“One of my absolute favorite dance moments was dancing with this one to LMFAO,” Chmerkovskiy says of a number the two danced during season 13 in 2011. “There was some chemistry going on and it was like the beginning of it all,” Murgatroyd adds.\n\n“When you watch it back, just watch Peta and I in the background,” Chmerkovskiy adds. Looking back at the video now, we can definitely see their spark!\n\n“I think that was one of the moments [we started falling for each other],” Murgatroyd remembers. “We were rehearsing it on the stage and my mom was sitting in the audience and she remembers looking at us and just saying, ‘There’s something going on there’ and there was actually nothing going on.” Chmerkovskiy, however, thinks sparks were absolutely already flying. “There was something going on,” he says.\n\nMost recently, Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy partnered with Hallmark and Venmo to launch the first-of-its-kind Hallmark + Venmo Cards, which allow gift givers to send cards with a Venmo balance ready to scan. So, in that spirit, we asked the two of them for their favorite gifts for one another.\n\n“Shai and Rio,” Chmerkovskiy responds in a split second. How adorable!\n\n“I’m so about a handwritten card,” Murgatroyd responds. “This is everything that I keep, I cherish. I store them away. This is something that we’ve spoken about when we got together. He’s a big gift giver, but he would give without a card and I would be like, ‘Well, where’s my card?'” Chmerkovskiy, on the other hand, couldn’t understand how precious writing a card was. “I’m like, ‘Geez, this is what’s important. What about all of this?'” he used to say.\n\nAs they walked down memory lane, the two then remembered their probably most traumatic present: a Louis Vuitton chest Murgatroyd gave Chmerkovskiy on his birthday in 2013. “I got him the most expensive, amazing gift Louis Vuitton luggage,” Murgatroyd remembers. “She got me a freakin’ [chest],” Chmerkovskiy adds. “It was like a relic, some 100-year-old thing. You have a private plane to have that.”\n\n“I could tell something was off when I gave it to him and lo and behold he was ready to break up with me,” Murgatroyd remembers. “It wasn’t because there was anything wrong because I, like a regular dude, freaked out,” Chmerkovskiy says. “I looked over and my closet was full of somebody’s clothes and I’m like, ‘We need to break up right now.'”\n\n“I still have the chest,” Chmerkovskiy admits. Seems like quite a story to tell the kids when they’re older!\n\nAs for Murgatroyd’s decision to return to the show only a few weeks post-partum, it seems like the decision was a no-brainer for her. “I love dancing. I love being on stage. I love performing, that’s what I do best,” she says. “I spent an amazing, you know, nine weeks solid with new baby Rio and now mommy goes back to work,” she says, adding that rehearsals are luckily only “five hours a day.”\n\n“I have my time to do my thing and then I come home to be the best mom that I can be,” she says. Luckily for Murgatroyd, she isn’t the only recent mom in the group. DWTS pros Daniella Karagach and Jenna Johnson also welcomed little ones earlier this year. “They’ve asked me for some advice too along the way ’cause I did it with last time as well six years ago so it was cool to see their experience and how they went through their postpartum journey as well,” she says.\n\nAs for what advice she has for the two, and any other new parents, is to “trust your gut.” “There’s a lot of advice being thrown from all different angles,” she says. “Trust your gut, you know what’s best.”\n\nCheck out Murgatroyd in the ballroom, and Chmerkovskiy in the audience, during Dancing With the Stars‘ season 32 every Tuesday on Disney+!"
