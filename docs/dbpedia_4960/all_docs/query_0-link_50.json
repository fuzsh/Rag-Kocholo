        "text": "Dancing With the Stars first aired in 2005 on ABC and quickly became one of the most popular competition reality shows on television. Over the course of more than fifteen years and more than 30 seasons, there have been quite a few hosts, judges, stars and of course pro dancers who have come in and out of participating on the show. While all eyes are mostly on the “stars” who work to astound judges, their partners and audiences, over the years the recurring pros working with the stars have garnered their own fan base and some have become just as famous as the celebrities they dance with. All the pros are vying for the Mirror Ball Trophy and are getting paid quite well to do so. Along with taking their talents to other projects and even branching out into acting, the dancing professionals aren’t hurting for money.\n\nCheck out how much some of the most popular professionals from DWTS are worth according to Celebrity Net Worth!\n\n17. Lacey Schwimmer\n\nEstimated Net Worth: 1.5 Million\n\nLacey Schwimmer rose to fame in her dancing career when she appeared on So You Think You Can Dance in the show’s third season where she landed fourth. In 2008, Schwimmer became the first So You Think You Can Dance alum cast as a pro dancer for Dancing With the Stars when she joined the series in season seven. She went on to compete in seasons 7 -9, and 11-13, of Dancing With the Stars and placed her best in season 11 with actor Kyle Massey. Although she didn’t stay on Dancing With the Stars for long, she still has a very impressive estimated net worth of $1.5 million.\n\n16. Keo Motsepe\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $300 Thousand\n\nKeoikantse “Keo” Motsepe joined Dancing With the Stars in 2014 for the show’s nineteenth season. Although he was the first pro to be eliminated along with his celebrity partner, Olympian Lolo Jones, Keo quickly won fans over with his charm and extremely easy-going and kind personality. He has since competed on several more seasons and often found himself in the bottom, but things turned around in season 27 when he and Harry Potter actress Evanna Lynch placed third! Keo competed on seasons 28 and 29 before moving on and has an estimated net worth of $300 thousand.\n\n15. Allison Holker\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $2 Million\n\nAllison Holker had quite the resume before even making her way to Dancing With the Stars.
