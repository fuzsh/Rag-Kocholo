        "text": "With another season of \"Dancing with the Stars\" in the history books, now is the perfect time to look back on the show's long legacy.\n\nSeason 1 of the reality competition series premiered on ABC on June 1, 2005. This year, for season 32, \"DWTS\" aired live on the network as well as streamed live on Disney+, with episodes available the next day on Hulu.\n\nEach season, celebrities are paired with a professional dancer for their \"DWTS\" journey. Every week, the pairs tackle a routine in pre-determined style -- and often based on a theme -- and are judged on their performance. The celebrity-pro couple who receive the lowest combined score between judges and the viewers is eliminated, and this continues each week until only one remains: the champions, who win the coveted Mirrorball Trophy.\n\nThere have been 32 winners thus far across 31 seasons of regular competition and one all-star season (season 15), beginning with \"General Hospital\" star Kelly Monaco. Most recently, Marvel star Xochitl Gomez snagged the win.\n\nPrevious winners include legendary sports stars, iconic musicians, beloved Hollywood actors and everything in between.\n\nWhile we wait for another season of ballroom competition, scroll down for a full list of past winners and their pro partners:\n\nSeason 1: Kelly Monaco and Alec Mazo\n\nSeason 2: Drew Lachey and Cheryl Burke\n\nSeason 3: Emmitt Smith and Cheryl Burke\n\nSeason 4: Apolo Ohno and Julianne Hough\n\nSeason 5: HÃ©lio Castroneves and Julianne Hough\n\nSeason 6: Kristi Yamaguchi and Mark Ballas\n\nSeason 7: Brooke Burke and Derek Hough\n\nSeason 8: Shawn Johnson and Mark Ballas\n\nSeason 9: Donny Osmond and Kym Johnson\n\nSeason 10: Nicole Scherzinger and Derek Hough\n\nSeason 11: Jennifer Grey and Derek Hough\n\nSeason 12: Hines Ward and Kym Johnson\n\nSeason 13: J.R. Martinez and Karina Smirnoff\n\nSeason 14: Donald Driver and Peta Murgatroyd\n\nSeason 15: Melissa Rycroft and Tony Dovolani\n\nSeason 16: Kellie Pickler and Derek Hough\n\nSeason 17: Amber Riley and Derek Hough\n\nSeason 18: Meryl Davis and Maksim Chmerkovskiy\n\nSeason 19: Alfonso Ribeiro and Witney Carson\n\nSeason 20: Rumer Willis and Val Chmerkovskiy\n\nSeason 21: Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough\n\nSeason 22: Nyle DiMarco and Peta Murgatroyd\n\nSeason 23: Laurie Hernandez and Val Chmerkovskiy\n\nSeason 24: Rashad Jennings and Emma Slater\n\nSeason 25: Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold\n\nSeason 26: Adam Rippon and Jenna Johnson\n\nSeason 27: Bobby Bones and Sharna Burgess\n\nSeason 28: Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten\n\nSeason 29: Kaitlyn Bristowe and Artem Chigvintsev\n\nSeason 30: Iman Shumpert and Daniella Karagach\n\nSeason 31: Charli D'Amelio and Mark Ballas\n\nSeason 32: Xochitl Gomez and Val Chmerkovskiy\n\nFor more \"DWTS\" coverage from \"GMA,\" click here.\n\nDisney is the parent company of ABC News and \"Good Morning America.\""
