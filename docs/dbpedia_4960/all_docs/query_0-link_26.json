        "text": "PETA Murgatroyd and her husband Maksim Chmerkovskiy have revealed they're expecting their third child just months after welcoming son Rio.\n\nDuring the announcement video, the Dancing with the Stars regular hinted that the pregnancy was unexpected.\n\nOn Monday, Peta, 37, broke the exciting news to fans with an Instagram post.\n\n\"We Are Having A Baby,\" she captioned the post.\n\nThe professional dancer continued, \"Yes we know… we just had a baby… haha! This was very unexpected at (4 months postpartum with Rio) but we are so happy and so ready to be a family of 5 soon!\"\n\nPeta explained, \"Surprising [Peta] on this FaceTime with my two friends secretly filming from different angles made it all the more hilarious.\n\n\"It took one hour for me to get the courage to call him and when he wasn’t catching on we all couldn’t stop laughing in the kitchen. I had the 'I’m so sick story' the pickle and 2 bottles HAHA! Oh Maks.\"\n\nThe dancing competition star concluded the pregnancy reveal by stating, \"Big thank you to [baby service Bobbie] for helping us shake things up and for being a part of this special announcement!\n\n\"After everything we’ve been through with miscarriages and IVF we’re beyond blessed and know we are uber lucky for this miracle to happen to us.\"\n\nShe then added, as a special message to fans, \"We’re just so happy that we can finally tell you guys the good news.\"\n\nThe video captured Peta surprising Maksim, 44, with the pregnancy news during a FaceTime call.\n\nBefore making the call, Peta is shown nervously pacing back and forth and exclaiming, \"He is not gonna know what hit him,\" before adding, \"I just have birth!\"\n\nWhile on the call Pete played it cool, explaining to her husband that she felt \"nauseous\" all day as he prepared for a dancing lesson.\n\nShe teased, \"I did a test\" but then covered her tracks by stating that she doesn't have Covid.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, Peta then told Maksim, \"I think we need to move out of Malibu and get a bigger place.\n\n\"I feel like we need another, extra bedroom.\"\n\nConfused Maksim attempted to end the call but stopped when he noticed the star preparing two bottles of formula.\n\nHe asked, \"Why is there two bottles? What are you doing?\"\n\nPeta then showed him the pregnancy test and admitted, \"This is what I'm trying to tell you.\"\n\nDumbfounded, Maksim stated, \"Babe, stop. No way,\" before asking, \"Babe, you're pregnant?\"\n\nPeta excitedly exclaimed, \"Yes! I'm pregnant!\"\n\nShe then jokingly added, \"Babe, we're in trouble.\"\n\nAs Pete ended the call with the soon-to-be-father of three, Maksim told his wife while tearing up, \"I'm so... I'm very happy.\"\n\nMORE ON PETA\n\nPeta rose to prominence for her appearance as a series regular on the American edition of DWTS.\n\nShe also garnered headlines for her marriage to fellow DWTS cast member, Maksim.\n\nPeta was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on July 14, 1986, and grew up in Perth, Australia.\n\nWidely recognizable to audiences for her work on the dancing competition, Peta signed on to the show for their 12th season - which aired in 2011.\n\nSince signing on to the American edition of DWTS, Peta has been a two-time winner of the hit competition program.\n\nShe came in first place with her dance partner, former NFL star Donald Driver, on season 14 - which aired in March 2012.\n\nIn May of 2016, the professional dancer repeated this feat with model and actor, Nyle DiMarco for the 22nd season of DWTS.\n\nBefore her DWTS stint, Peta was one of the leads on Broadway's 2009 production of Burn the Floor - where she met her future husband, Maksim.\n\nFAMILY LIFE\n\nThroughout their relationship, the couple have welcomed two sons: Shai and Rio.\n\nShai Aleksander was born in January of 2017.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the two welcomed their son, Rio. In an Instagram post, the two wrote: \"Rio John Chmerkovskiy Born 6.18.2023 8.6 oz and thriving!\n\n\"We are overjoyed to share our baby boy with all of you.\"\n\nMaksim and Peta entered a relationship in 2012 - and repeatedly called it quits numerous times before their engagement.\n\nThe two announced their engagement on December 5, 2015, and tied the knot on July 8, 2017.\n\nIn addition to attaining national success on the dancefloor, Peta also increased her popularity with her roles across motion pictures.\n\nHer filmography includes - Faith, Hope & Love, Living on the Fringe, and Why Women Kill."
