Maks Chmerkovskiy, who is best known for his multiple seasons as one of the professional dancers on “Dancing With the Stars,” has teamed with his wife and fellow “Dancing with the Stars” professional, Peta Murgatroyd, to launch a skin care marketplace.

The new platform, called Maks & Peta Marketplace, offers vegan and cruelty-free skin care products, including Foot Spray, Face Mist, CBD Pain Cream and Hand & Foot Lotion.

A portion of the profits will go toward Baranova27, a 501c3 nonprofit organization committed to aiding those affected by the war in Ukraine. Chmerkovskiy, who is Ukrainian, said that as a public figure, he and Murgatroyd felt compelled to use their platform for good.

In addition to his new skin care marketplace, Chmerkovskiy recently launched a line of premium vodka called Tetya Kapa, which is currently available for purchase on napadistillery.com. Only a limited number of bottles were made of the vodka, which is priced at $55.

Chmerkovskiy appeared in Seasons Two through 18 of “Dancing with the Stars.” After winning Season 18, he took a hiatus from the show and returned for Season 23 in 2016. After that, Chmerkovskiy revealed he would officially move on from the program.

Although he is no longer part of the “Dancing With the Stars” family, Chmerkovskiy intends to continue with reality television. In September, the dancer was revealed as a contestant on the second season of Peacock’s “The Traitors.” The show features a group of contestants, where a small group of them are marked as traitors, and the contestants must work to eliminate the traitors so they can achieve the grand prize.
