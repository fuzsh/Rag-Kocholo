        "text": "The differences between mankind are natural. The Qur&#39;an also suggests that differences will continue to exist on this earth in line with the existence of human beings. There are many factors behind the birth of differences among humans, such as religious factors, political factors, ethnic factors, and other factors.This paper examines the phenomenon of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) which is a splinter group of Muslims who often launch acts of terror in the name of Islamic teachings. The emergence of ISIS and other terrorist groups has given a bad effect on the face of Islam in the international world because Islam is then seen by outsiders as a religion that supports radicalism-terrorism. Islam, as a religion of love, has never encouraged its followings to do damage on earth. On the contrary, this religion encourages its people to revive an atmosphere of peace and compassion in all aspects of life. This study finds the fact that the emergence of the ISIS phenomenon is d...\n\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), al-Qaeda, Boko Haram in West Africa and the Muslim Brotherhood are nothing new in history. These takfiri and terrorist groups and organizations are modern-day clones of a number of Islamist sects and factions that emerged throughout Islamic history. In this study, I try to retrace political Islam throughout history. While European decision-makers have grappled with the question of where to draw the line between religion and politics, fundamentalists in the Islamic world have been trying to persuade their publics that no such line should exist.\n\nIn three earlier articles entitled 'Integration of Muslims means Disintegration of Europe' (https://www.academia.edu/24267890/Integration_of_Muslims_means_Disintegration_of_Europe_-_by_Prof._Muhammad_Shamsaddin_Megalommatis), 'Reasons making Muslim Integration in Europe Impossible' (https://www.academia.edu/24268557/Reasons_making_Muslim_Integration_in_Europe_Impossible_-_by_Prof._Muhammad_Shamsaddin_Megalommatis), and 'The Impossibility of Muslims' Integration in Europe' (https://www.academia.edu/24270270/The_Impossibility_of_Muslims_Integration_in_Europe_-_by_Prof._Muhammad_Shamsaddin_Megalommatis), we stressed the importance of Moral Principles in politics, and we briefly analyzed twelve points - reasons that make the Muslims' Integration in Europe an unrealistic option. To help the reader fast recapitulate the points, we enumerate them here: 1) Centuries long European Hatred of Islam, 2) Fallacious Academic – Intellectual Background and Fake Identity of Modern Europe (Hellenism), 3) Misperception of the World History through the Scheme West vs. East, 4) Execrable Disfigurement of the 'Other' (Orientalism), 5) Demolition of the Ottoman Empire, 6) Tragic Termination of the Islamic Civilization and Rise of Barbarism throughout the nominally Islamic territories, 7) Formation of Pan-Arabism / False Identity and Language for the colonized masses, 8) Methodic and Perverse Work of Obliteration of the Berber, Coptic, Aramaic and Yemenite Languages, Cultures and Identities, 9) Severe Distortion of the National Histories of the illegally detached from the Ottoman Empire Peoples, matched with a multi-target confusion of the World academia, 10) Distorted Representation of the Oriental and Islamic Past for average European, Western and World readerships, 11) Forged Disconnection of the Islamic Past from the Pre-Islamic Oriental Past, with catastrophic impact on both, colonized peoples and colonizing states, and 12) Anemic, Anodyne and Fallacious Western Doctrine of Islamology, as the most marginal and obscure doctrine of Orientalism. In the present, fourth, article, we will focus on the most important point – reason of the Muslim immigrants' impossibility to integrate in the European, and in general in the Western societies. Point 13 – Cataclysmically Disastrous Formation of Islamism by the Colonial West First published in AfroArticles, American Chronicle, and Buzzle on 18th August 2007 http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/Article/Islamic-Terrorism--a-European-Creation-Monster-Impossible-to-Integrate/36766\n\nDifferences between humans is natural. The Qur’an also suggests that these differences will continue in line with the existence of humans on this earth. There are many factors behind the birth of differences between humans, such as religious factors, political factors, ethnic factors, and others. This paper examines the phenomenon of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) which is a splinter group of Muslims who often launch acts of terror in the name of Islamic teachings. The emergence of ISIS ultimately gave a bad effect to the face of Islam in the international world because Islam, which is truly a religion of love, was viewed by outsiders as a religion that supported radicalism-terrorism. This study found that the emergence of the ISIS phenomenon was due to misunderstanding in interpreting the verses of the Qur’an about the concepts of jihâd, takfir and caliphate.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the West has mounted a campaign against Islam as the essential source of terrorism and the Muslims as necessarily terrorists. However, the problems of violence and terror are not isolated issues but have epistemological and unspoken real causes. Violence is related to despotism, especially the despotism of hegemony. The US-led war on terrorism is not a simple struggle between good and evil. The hidden reasons behind it makes it difficult for the Muslims and others in the Third World to appreciate the efforts. Constructed mostly by reporters of such powerful TV cables like CNN, intelligence analysts and &quot;experts on Muslim affairs,&quot; the Muslim is perceived as the terrorist, the imminent menace to civilization and the universal values of democracy and freedom. This campaign gained much momentum and became more intense with the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. The untiring rhetoric associating Islam and Muslims with terror..."
