        "text": "TI/TOSCOW 'Radio admits, however, .\n\n-\"-1- there is a serious threat to the\"\n\nRussian left flank on the Byelgorod\n\nfront, where fierce tank battles are\n\nraging. , ,\n\nMoscow claims that in the fight\n\ning, now in its ninth day, the\n\nNazis have lost more than 2500 tanks\n\nand nearly 1100 planes.\n\nBerlin Radio says that since July 5,\n\nwhen the offensive opened, 28,000\n\nRussians as well as 1600 tanks have\n\nbeen captured.\n\nIn the sector north-west of Kursk\n\nI yesterday the enemy launched fur\n\nther attacks with huge infantry\n\nforces, supported by tanks, but\n\nrthese failed. ' .\n\nStormovik i tank-buster) pianes, m\n\na spectacular swoop over the\n\nGerman lines, blasted a division pre\n\nparing to attack, crippling many\n\nvehicles. â€ž\n\nHalted In Wedge\n\nThe Daily Mirror's military corres\n\npondent says that the second week\n\nof the battle finds the Germans still\n\ntrving to exploit the wedge north of\n\nByelgorod. Fortunately the Russians\n\nhave been able to hold up the Nazis\n\nbefore the wedge is wide enough to\n\nallow the troops to pour in. The\n\nbattle therefore remains more or less\n\nstatic.\n\nHe declares that the Germans , ex\n\npected that lightning attacks would\n\nenable them to straighten the line,\n\nsaving 400 miles, and allow Hitler to\n\nrelease more divisions to meet the\n\nAllied invasion forces.\n\nFor the first time Hitler has met\n\nan army employing frustration tac\n\ntics, declares the writer. Field-\n\nMarshal von Kluge is finding his\n\nmaster in Marshal Timoshenko, who\n\nhas long\" prepared for this kind of\n\nattack\n\nThe Nazis have sent in waves of\n\n80 to 90 Messerschmitts and Focke-\n\nwulfs, believing they had to keep the\n\nSoviet fighters separated from the\n\nNazi bombers, but the fighters made\n\na wide detour, attacking the bombers\n\nwhere least expected.\n\nSoviet Air Mastery\n\nThis is upsetting the . Luftwaffe's\n\nplans and giving the Soviet air mas\n\ntery.\n\nRed Air Force planes thus are\n\nable to concentrate against tanks\n\nbecause of the narrowness of the\n\nwedge. This, to; a large extent, ex\n\nplains the high number of Panzer\n\nunits destroyed.\n\nThe correspondent adds that the\n\nRussians are introducing their newest\n\ntank, the 52-ton Kutusov, demonstrat\n\ning that the Soviet feels it has cleaned\n\nup the situation sufficiently to enable\n\nthem to take the initiative.\n\nLast night's . Russian communique\n\nsavs that stubborn fighting is pro\n\nceeding. It claims that 122 enemy\n\ntanks were destroyed and- 17 planes\n\nshot down yesterday."
