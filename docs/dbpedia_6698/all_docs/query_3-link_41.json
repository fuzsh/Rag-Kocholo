        "text": "The conflicts in the “modern Middle Eastern state system” are driven by several factors, some related to weak state formation and the persistence of sub-national identities that supersede national loyalties; some that are the product of authoritarian (or totalitarian) state structures that provide no rights or voice to their citizens; some that are the result of Muslim revolutionary ambitions exemplified by the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the accession to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and the campaigns of al Qaeda and ISIL/Da’esh; and some that derive from sub-regional power politics founded on perceived national interests and security concerns, notably between the KSA and Iran, also influenced by Turkey and Egypt. The impact of external interventions has also been significant. The schism between Washington and Tehran after the Islamic Revolution and the occupation of the U.S. Embassy in 1979; Soviet, Chinese, French and U.S. support for Iraq in its war against Iran from 1980-1988 ; the close alliance between the KSA and the U.S. in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990; the displacement of the Taliban in Afghanistan, followed by the invasion of Iraq, without UNSC authorization, by a U.S.-led coalition in 2003 and the disbandment of the Ba’athist government and Iraqi military forces; U.S. and other Western states’ relations with the governments of Egypt and Syria, notably to bolster peace agreements with Israel; Western ambivalence and Russian strategic purpose in the Syrian civil war; and the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015 between the P5+1 and the Islamic Republic of Iran; all had important impacts on local realities and regional perceptions. Behind all this, the unresolved, perhaps frozen, Israel-Palestine conflict still festers, serving as tinder for radicals competing for support on the street. A successful neighborhood policy in the Middle East requires close attention to five principles: (a) Defining each conflict and its components correctly; (b) Identifying when conflicts are ripe for resolution and engaging each with the appropriate mix of policy instruments, at the correct time; (c) Crafting policy responses specific to the requirements of each conflict, while implementing them within an integrated regional concept; (d) Preparing and implementing integrated programs of post-conflict reconstruction; and (e) Facilitating the emergence and establishment of an inclusive Regional Security Framework.\n\nI was inspired by Hollywood movie in giving a name to this book. Matrix is the name of a fake world which is believed to be fictitious. September 11 was a starting point which differentiates between those who resist and those who don’t and between those who believe and those who don’t. After you read this book you will start to see the September 11 event, the fiction of Matrix from a different point of view. You will either be satisfied with the proofs we introduced, go out of the lantern of Matrix and break the chains which were put in your hearts and brains or you will go on living in the fiction of Matrix calling all the things conspiracy theory and ignoring the realities. 100 thousands ”Internet Investigators” who don’t yield are trying to reveal the lies of Matrix, the brave hearts who try to reveal the realities of September 11. Today, Islam is misunderstood at best. Muslims should say, “In Islam, killing a human is equal to qufr [not believing Allah]."
