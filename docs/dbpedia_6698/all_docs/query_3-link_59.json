This document summarizes the statements of a British spy named Hempher about Britain's colonial ambitions and strategy for weakening Muslim-majority nations. Hempher explains that Britain seeks to fully control its colonies in India, China, and the Middle East. While China and India did not worry Britain much due to their \"dead\" religions, the Islamic countries were a main concern. Britain had made agreements with the Ottoman Empire and Iran that benefited itself. However, it still worked to foment discord, ignorance, poverty, and disease in these regions to break their backbone and prevent Islam from threatening British control.",
