        "text": "In this thesis is explained the transfer of traditional leather production of The Ottoman Empire to The Republic of Turkey via history of leather usage and importance of leather in the part of the human life. Effects of leather production in The Ottoman Empire to the structure of artisan organization and the districts where production had made in Istanbul, also changes that the production process in Europe had made on the traditional leather production of The Ottoman Empire are explained. Changes that Beykoz Leather Shoe Factory arisen by the effects of the Industrial Revolution had been undergone during transition from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey has been tried to be examined. Sümerbank Beykoz Leather and Shoe Factory is an important example in regard of production tradition, because it is one of the first factories in Turkey. Beykoz district with factories had built its presence on production, and it had been a district thriving on the lives of workers. In this research oral historical work is formed by having an interwiev with Yener Kaya who had worked in the Beykoz Leather and Shoe Factory for two generations and had been President of The Leather Employment Syndicate; also it is tried to be explained the structure of Beykoz Leather and Shoe Factory in the republic era, quality of production, working conditions of workers, effects of the factory to Beykoz district, also the economical importance of the leather sector for the New Republic.\n\nThe urban transformation process accelerated immensely by the end of the 20th century is one of the problems Turkey has faced. This process, which is guided by various legal and administrative sanctions for many years, affects historical urban areas negatively. One of these sanctions providing a basis for inappropriate interventions on the historical urban areas is the Law No. 5366 on “Conservation by Renovation and Use by Revitalization of the Deteriorated Historical and Cultural Immovable Property”. This law, the “Renewal Law” in short, carried into effect in 2005, causes irreversible damages and losses through the renewal of the qualified urban sites. The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the urban transformation of the “Land Walls Protection Area”, one of four sites determined as world her- itages in the Historical Peninsula of Istanbul, through a reading of the Law No. 5366. This evaluation is made through “Zeytinburnu Culture Valley Project”, which is the largest renewal project identified among the six renewal zones falls within the Land Walls Protection Area. The paper begins with the history of Zeytinburnu through a chronological narration. After emphasizing the values of the district, “Zeytinburnu Culture Valley Project” is introduced in terms of its purpose, scope and content. The study then focuses on the spatial effects of Law No. 5366 through the final state of the project. Lastly, on its 13th year of force, the consequences of the Renewal Law on the cultural heritage that needs to be protected are specified in the light of the internationally valid charters from a conservation point of view."
