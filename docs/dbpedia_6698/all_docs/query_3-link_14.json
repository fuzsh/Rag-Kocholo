In this section, we introduce the basics of quantitative and qualitative analysis using ICP-MS and how to perform internal standard correction. Please take a look.üëâ Analysis result: https://zurl.co/uaVY Click here to learn about Shimadzu‚Äôs new ICPMS: https://zurl.co/JXpd #ICPMS #InductivelyCoupledPlasmaMassSpectrometry #element #heavymetal\n\n[News] On June 3, Shimadzu Corporation concluded a comprehensive partnership agreement with the Tokushima University, a national university, to acquire innovative technology and create businesses that contribute to solving social issues, as well as for human resource development and personnel exchanges. The two parties will conduct joint research on next-generation light source technology, food technology, and underwater communication technology. They will also foster human resources, including researchers and engineers from both sides, and Tokushima University students.

This can necessitate retakes, resulting in increased exposure dose for the patient and extended overall examination time. With the ‚ÄòMotion Detection‚Äô feature on the RADspeed Pro SR5 Version, the system displays any patient body movement on the screen from the predetermined imaging position. If the patient moves away from the determined position, the optical camera detects the movement and provides notifications through sound and display, thereby reducing the risk of retakes. Learn more about RADspeed Pro SR5 Version here!üëâ https://lnkd.in/eubENbJG #shimadzu #RADspeedProSR5 #xray #radiography #radiology\n\nThe three load cell universal testing machine on AGX-V2 series is able to perform three tests at a time. Using this system, not only can the test be performed in 1/3 of the time, but also statistical processing such as the average value of three lines and the average curve can be displayed by the dedicated data processing software. Key features: ‚úÖ Performing three tests simultaneously reduces test time by 1/3, increasing efficiency. ‚úÖ Dedicated software removes each deflection and displays the graph in real time. ‚úÖ Possible to test either one or two specimens, depending on the test.

Moreover, even the same type of surfactant can take the form of numerous compounds with different chain lengths, making continuous detection essential. Within this context, targeted screening using high-resolution LC-MS is very well suited to surfactant analysis. This Application News describes a case study of comprehensive analysis using the LCMS-9030 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (QTOF) LC-MS system by presenting the results of analysis of tea beverages spiked with surfactants. https://zurl.co/XP8B #shimadzu\n\nFor this month's Learning Portal, we have curated a selection of resources to empower you in the field of analytical science. üëâhttps://zurl.co/VPtg üîç Browse Through Different Categories: 1.
