The Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area extends over an area of 1,455.62 km2 (562.02 sq mi) and its population in 2011 reached a total of 1,006,730 inhabitants.[1]\n\nThessaloniki is Greece's second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre, and a major transportation hub for the rest of southeastern Europe;[6] its commercial port is also of great importance for Greece and the southeastern European hinterland.[6] The city is renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general,[7] and is considered to be Greece's cultural capital.[7] Events such as the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually, while the city also hosts the largest bi-annual meeting of the Greek diaspora.[8]\n\nThessaloniki is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments, including the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures. With a history of over 2,300 years, it is one of Europe's oldest cities. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and in the Balkans.[9]\n\nEtymology\n\nAncient Greek inscription reading \"To Queen Thessalonice, (Daughter) of Philip\".\n\nAll variations of the city's name derive from the original (and current) appellation in Greek: ÎÎµÏÏÎ±Î»Î¿Î½Î¯ÎºÎ·, literally translating to \"Thessalian Victory\" and in origin the name of a princess, Thessalonike of Macedon, who was named so because she was born on the day of the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field.[10]\n\nThe alternative name Salonika or Salonica, derived from the variant form Î£Î±Î»Î¿Î½Î¯ÎºÎ· (SalonÃ­ki) in popular Greek speech, gives rise to several languages' form of the city's name and is formerly the common name used in some western European languages. Names in other languages prominent in the city's history include Ð¡Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¸ (Soluniki) in Old Church Slavonic, Salonika in Ladino, Selanik (also SelÃ¢nik) in Turkish (Ø³ÙØ§ÙÛÙ in Ottoman Turkish), Solun (also written as Ð¡Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ½) in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, Ð¡Ð°Ð»Ð¾Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¸ (SalonÃ­ki) in Russian, and SÃ£runÃ£ in Aromanian. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deepL characteristic of Macedonian Greek accent.[11][12] The name is often written in the abbreviated form ÎÎµÏ/Î½Î¯ÎºÎ·.\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: History of Thessaloniki\n\nThe history of the city of Thessaloniki is a long one, dating back to ancient Macedonia. Since the opening of borders in Southeastern Europe following the collapse of Communism in the Balkans in the early 1990s, it has experienced a strong revival.\n\nFrom antiquity to the Roman Empire\n\nThe Roman forum.\n\nThe city was founded around 315 BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages.[13] He named it after his wife Thessalonike,[14] a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedon as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedon the city retained its own autonomy and parliament[CN] and evolved to become the most important city in Macedon.[14]\n\nAfter the fall of the kingdom of Macedon in 168 BC, Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic.[14] It grew to be an important trade-hub located on the Via Egnatia,[15] the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Thessaloniki,[16] which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centers of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium.[17] The city later became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia.[15] Later it became the capital of all the Greek provinces of the Roman Empire due to the city's importance in the Balkan peninsula. When the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar,[18][19] where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum among others.[19][20][21]\n\nIn 379 when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum.[15] With the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.[17]\n\nMedieval times and Byzantine era\n\nTheodorus Gaza (c. 1400â1475), called \"Thessalonicensis\",[22] a Renaissance humanist and scholar of the 15th century from Thessaloniki.[23]\n\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki asserted itself as the second city in the Empire,[24][25][26] a status it held until it was finally transferred to Venice in 1423. The status of \"second city\" only to Constantinople was both in terms of wealth and size.[24] In the 1300s the city's population exceeded 100,000,[27][28] making it larger than London at the time.[29]\n\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204,[30] when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica[31] â which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor,[32] and the city became the Despotat's capital.[32][33] This era of the Despotate of Epirus is also known as the Empire of Thessalonica.[32][34][35] Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230,[32][34] the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.[32] In 1342,[36] the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor,[37] which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary.[36] The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire,[36][37][38] as it had its own government, a form of republic.[36] The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.[36]\n\nIn 1423, Despot Andronicus, who was in charge of the city, ceded it to the Republic of Venice in the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city (there is no evidence to support the oft-repeated story that he sold the city to them). The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on the 29th of March, 1430.[39]\n\nOttoman period\n\nMurad II took Thessaloniki with a brutal massacre[40] and enslaved roughly one-fifth of the city's native population.[41] Upon the capture and plunder of Thessaloniki, many of its inhabitants escaped,[42] including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza âThessalonicensisâ and Andronicus Callistus.[43] However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub.[44][45] Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs.[44] Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping,[44] but also in manufacturing,[45] while most of the city's trade was controlled by ethnic Greeks.[44]\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's Muslim and Jewish population grew. By 1478 SelÃ¢nik (Ø³ÙØ§ÙÛÙ), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had a population of 4,320 Muslims, 6,094 Greek Orthodox and some Catholics, but no Jews. Soon after the turn of the 16th century, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews had immigrated to Greece from Spain following their expulsion.[40] By 1519, Sephardic Jews numbered 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to the Jews was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population (Eastern Orthodox Christians) from dominating the city.[27]\n\nThe Ottoman Feth-i BÃ¼lend being sunk in Thessaloniki in 1912 by a Greek ship.\n\nSelanik was the capital of the Selanik sanjak within the Rumeli Eyaleti (Balkans)[46] until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Vilayeti[47] (between 1826 and 1864 Selanik Eyaleti).[48] This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.[49] Thessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold[50] where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissary,[50] an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history.[50] From 1870, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.[CN]\n\n20th century onwards\n\nEleftherios Venizelos, political leader of the Movement of National Defence in Thessaloniki, inspects Greek troops on the Macedonian front during the First World War.\n\nDuring the First Balkan War, on 8 November(26 October) 1912 (Old Style),[51] the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius,[51] the Greek Army accepted the surrender of the Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki;[51] after the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913.[52]\n\nIn 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria.[53] This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika Front.[54][55] In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched the Movement of National Defence,[56] creating a pro-Allied[57] temporary government by the name of the \"State of Thessaloniki\"[56][58] that controlled \"new lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece);[56][58] the official government of the King in Athens, the \"State of Athens\",[56] controlled the \"old lands\"[56][58] which were traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.[53][58]\n\nCentral Thessaloniki burning during the Great Fire of 1917.\n\nMost of the old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on the 18th of August 1917.[59] The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless;[59] according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). As many businesses were destroyed, it resulted to 70% of the population being unemployed,[59] while also a number of religious structures of the three major faiths were lost. Nearly one-quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless.[59] Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan[5] prepared by a group of architects, including the British Thomas Mawson, headed by French architect Ernest HÃ©brard.[59] It is indicative that the Jewish community's properties were reduced from a value of 6.5 million Greek drachmas to 750,000.[60] Because of their losses and unable to wait for the rebuilding of the new plan, nearly half of the Jewish Greek population emigrated to France, the United States and Palestine.[CN]\n\nGerman tank in Thessaloniki during the occupation.\n\nAfter the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey.[57] Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks from the former Ottoman Empire resettled in the city,[57] changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people.[61] During the interwar period, Greece granted Jews full civil rights, the same as all other Greek citizens.[60]\n\nDuring World War II, Thessaloniki fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941[62] and remained under German occupation until 30 October 1944 when it was liberated by the Greek People's Liberation Army.[63] The Nazis soon forced the Jews into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation process of the city's 56,000 Jews to its concentration camps.[64][65] They deported over 43,000 of the city's Jews in concentration camps,[64] where most were killed in the gas chambers. The Germans also deported 11,000 Jews to forced labor camps, where most perished.[66] The city suffered considerable damage from Allied bombing as they began to move against the Germans. Only 1,200 Jews live in the city today.\n\nAfter the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988.[67] In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture,[68] sponsoring events across the city and the region, while in 2004 the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.[69]\n\nToday Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and fascilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland.[6] The city also forms one of the largest student centres in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and is a keen canditate for becoming European Youth Capital in 2014,[70] after it celebrates 100 years of union with Greece in 2012.[71]\n\nGeography\n\nPanoramic view of the city.\n\nGeology\n\nThessaloniki and the surrounding areas from space (1996)\n\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\n\nSince midieval times, Thessaloniki was hit by strong earthquakes in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995.[72] On 19â20 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale.[73][74] The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments,[73] but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems.[74] One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many, raising the final death toll to 51.[73][74]\n\nClimate\n\nSituated next to the sea, the city's climate is directly effected by it.[75] The city has a Mediterranean climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification \"Csa\") that borders on a semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification \"BSk\" or \"BSh\" depending on the system used) with annual average precipitation of 460 mm. Snowfalls are sporadic, but happen more or less every winter. Fog is common in the city, with an average of 193 foggy days in a year.[76]\n\nThe city lies in a transitional climatic zone, so its climate displays characteristics of continental and Mediterranean climates. Winters are relatively dry, with common morning frost. Snowfalls occur almost every year, but usually the snow does not stay for more than a few days. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to â10Â°C (14F).[76] The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was â14Â°C (7F).[77] On average, Thessaloniki spends 32 days a year below 0Â°C (32F).[76] The coldest month of the year in the city is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of 6Â°C (42F).[78] Wind is also usual in the winter months, with December and January having an average wind speed of 26 km/h (16 mph).[76]\n\nThessaloniki's summers are hot with rather humid nights.[76] Maximum temperatures usually rise above 30Â°C (86F),[76] but rarely go over 40CÂ° (104F);[76] the average number of days when temperature was above 32Â°C (90F) was 32.[76] The maximum recorded temperature in the city was 42Â°C (108F).[76][77] Rain is seldom in summer, and mainly falls during thunderstorms. In the summer months Thessaloniki also experiences strong heat waves.[79] The hottest month of the year in the city is July, with an average 24-hour temperature of 26Â°C (80F).[78] The average wind speed for June and July in Thessaloniki is 20 km/h (12 mph).[76]\n\nClimate data for Thessaloniki\n\nMonth Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year\n\nAverage high Â°C (Â°F) 9.3\n\n(48.7) 10.9\n\n(51.6) 14.2\n\n(57.6) 19.0\n\n(66.2) 24.5\n\n(76.1) 29.2\n\n(84.6) 31.5\n\n(88.7) 31.1\n\n(88.0) 27.2\n\n(81.0) 21.2\n\n(70.2) 15.4\n\n(59.7) 11.0\n\n(51.8) 20.38\n\nDaily mean Â°C (Â°F) 5.3\n\n(41.5) 6.6\n\n(43.9) 9.4\n\n(48.9) 13.3\n\n(55.9) 18.3\n\n(64.9) 22.8\n\n(73.0) 25.1\n\n(77.2) 24.7\n\n(76.5) 21.1\n\n(70.0) 16.0\n\n(60.8) 11.1\n\n(52.0) 7.0\n\n(44.6) 15.06\n\nAverage low Â°C (Â°F) 1.3\n\n(34.3) 2.2\n\n(36.0) 4.5\n\n(40.1) 7.5\n\n(45.5) 12.1\n\n(53.8) 16.3\n\n(61.3) 18.6\n\n(65.5) 18.3\n\n(64.9) 14.9\n\n(58.8) 10.8\n\n(51.4) 6.8\n\n(44.2) 3.0\n\n(37.4) 9.69\n\nPrecipitation mm (inches) 36.8\n\n(1.449) 38.0\n\n(1.496) 40.6\n\n(1.598) 37.5\n\n(1.476) 44.4\n\n(1.748) 29.6\n\n(1.165) 23.9\n\n(0.941) 20.4\n\n(0.803) 27.4\n\n(1.079) 40.8\n\n(1.606) 54.4\n\n(2.142) 54.9\n\n(2.161) 448.7\n\n(17.665)\n\nAvg. precipitation days 11 8 9 9 10 7 4 3 5 8 11 11 96\n\nSunshine hours 124 140 155 240 279 300 372 341 240 186 120 120 2,620\n\nSource: World Meteorological Organization (UN),[80] BBC weather[81] for data of sunshine hours\n\nGovernment\n\nThe Thessaloniki Urban Area.\n\nLocal government\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Thessaloniki\n\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area (Greek: Î Î¿Î»ÎµÎ¿Î´Î¿Î¼Î¹ÎºÏ Î£Ï Î³ÎºÏÏÏÎ·Î¼Î± ÎÎµÏÏÎ±Î»Î¿Î½Î¯ÎºÎ·Ï) which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities (Greek: ÎÎ®Î¼Î¿Î¹) and one municipal unit (Greek: ÎÎ·Î¼Î¿ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® ÎµÎ½ÏÏÎ·ÏÎ±). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city center and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal unit of Pylaia, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.[82]\n\nThe Command Post, now General Secretariat for Macedonia and Thrace, designed by Vitaliano Poselli in 1891.\n\nOther\n\nSee also: Ministry for Macedonia and Thrace\n\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the Central Macedonia Periphery and the Thessaloniki Prefecture. The General Secretariat for Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, being that the city is the de facto capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.\n\nIt is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.[83]\n\nCityscape\n\nThe School of Education of Aristotle University.\n\nThessaloniki in the late 1910s.\n\nArchitecture\n\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries, the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel / Palestine). Merchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories.\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.[84]\n\nThe expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, due to their proximity near factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours.[85] It destroyed the city's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved way for many modern buildings and changed the city into a thriving European city center.\n\nPanoramic view of Aristotelous Square, one of Thessaloniki's most recognizable areas, which was designed by Ernest Hebrard.\n\nCity Center\n\nSee also: Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917\n\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessalonikiâs city center. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today.[85] It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\n\nToday the city center of Thessaloniki includes the features designed as part of the plan and forms the point in the city where most of the public buildings, historical sites, entertainment venues and stores are located. The center is characterized by its many historical buildings, arcades, laneways and distinct architectural styles such as Art Nouveau and Art Deco, which can be seen on many of its buildings.\n\nThe city center, or as its also called the historic center is divided into several districts, of which include Ladadika (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), Kapani (where the central city market is located), Diagonios, Nauarinou, Rotonta, Agia Sofia and Ippodromio (white tower), which are all located around Thessalonikiâs most central point, Aristotelous Square.\n\nThe west point of the city center is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while on its eastern side stands the cityâs two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center, the cityâs main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parklands and gardens, namely those of the Palios Zoologikos Kipos and Pedio tou Areos. The central road arteries that pass through the city center, designed in the Ernest Hebrard plan, include those of Tsimiski, Egnatia, Nikis, Mitropoleos, Venizelou and St. Demetrius avenues.\n\nThe Acropolis of Thessaloniki, reconstructed during the Byzantine and Ottoman years, which is part of the Walls.\n\nTypical architecture of the Ano Poli (Upper Town) district.\n\nView from Thessaloniki's Ano Poli and its walls. Part of southeastern Thessaloniki can also be seen on the left.\n\nAno Poli\n\nAno Poli (also called Old Town and literally the Upper Town) is the heritage listed district north of Thessalonikiâs city center that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO heritage site by ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessalonikiâs most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture.\n\nAno Poli also, is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the cityâs acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion and the city's remaining walls, with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The area provides access to the Seich Sou Forest National Park[86] and features amphitheatric views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about 100 km (62 mi) away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\n\nSoutheastern Thessaloniki\n\nSoutheastern Thessaloniki up until the 1920s was home to the cityâs most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf coast called Exoches, meaning âthe countrysideâ. Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in someway become a natural extension of the city center, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasilisis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it; and the area extending to Kalamaria and Pylaia, about 9 km (5.59 mi) from the White Tower in the city centre.\n\nSoutheastern Thessaloniki is characterized by is modern architecture and apartment buildings, home to the middle-class and more than half of the municipality of Thessaloniki population. Today this area of the city is also home to 3 of the cityâs main football stadiums, the Thessaloniki concert hall, the Posidonio aquatic and athletic complex and to many restored mansions of past affluent residents of the city, which today serve as museums or cultural centers. The municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and has become this part of the cityâs most sought after areas, with many open spaces and home to high end bars, cafÃ©s and entertainment venues, most notably on Plastira street, along the coast.\n\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki\n\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki had always been associated with industry and the working class due to the fact that as the city grew during the 1920s, many workers had moved there, due to its proximity near factories and industrial activities. Today many factories and industries have been moved further out west and the area is experiencing rapid growth as does the southeast. Many factories in this area have been converted to cultural centres, while past military grounds that are being surrounded by densely built neighborhoods are awaiting transformation into parklands.\n\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Septemvriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city center. The area is home to the Macedonia Central Bus Station (intercity buses terminal), the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery and to large entertainment venues of the city, such as Milos, Fix, Vilka (which are housed in converted old factories). Northwestern Thessaloniki is also home to Moni Lazariston, located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centers for the city.[87]\n\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios, built in the 4th century, is said to be the largest basilica in Greece and is one of the city's most prominent Paleochristian monuments.\n\nPaleochristian and Byzantine monuments (UNESCO)\n\nMain article: Paleochristian and Byzantine Monuments of Thessalonika\n\nSee also: Byzantine architecture\n\nDue to Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia.[67] The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire,[67] when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.[67]\n\nBy the 8th century, the city had become an important administrative center of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs.[88] During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Rotunda of Saint George, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon.[67] When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques,[67] but have survived to this day. Travelers such as Paul Lucas and Abdul Mecid[67] document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of the Ottoman control of the city.\n\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios was burnt down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other of the city's monuments, but it was rebuilt. During the Second World War, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged.[88] Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments.[67] They have been listed since 1988.[67]\n\nThessaloniki 2012 Program\n\nThe upper seaside promenade as it was before work commenced in August 2011.\n\nIn regards to the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, during 1912, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment program for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems[89] that the city faces. More specifically, the program will drastically change the physiognomy of the city[89] by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park,[90] redeveloping the coastal front of the city,[90] relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centers;[90] and the complete redevelopment of the harbor and the Lachanokipoi and Dendropotamos districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a thriving business district,[90] with possible highrise developments.[91]\n\nThe plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city[90] and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city center.[90] Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of Seich Sou Forest National Park[89] and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town.[89] The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.[90]\n\nPart of the plan has been implemented with the revitalization of half the eastern urban waterfront (Greek: ÎÎ­Î± Î Î±ÏÎ±Î»Î¯Î±, Nea Paralia, literally new beach), with a modern and vibrant design. The municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and most notably the rest of the waterfront, is estimated to be around â¬28.2 million (US$39.9 million) for the year 2011 alone.[92] As of August 2011 work on the rest of the plan for the revilatization of the waterfront has began, stretching from the Thessaloniki yacht club to the White Tower.[93] It is estimated that the new parks will be completed within the next two years at a total cost of over 20 million euro.[93] Once complete, the entire city's Nea Paralia will feature thematic parks.[93]\n\nEconomy\n\nThe MS Westerdam at the port of Thessaloniki.\n\nThe building of the National Bank of Greece.\n\nThessaloniki is a major port city and an industrial and commercial centre. The city's industries centre around oil, steel, petrochemicals, textiles, machinery, flour, cement, pharmaceuticals, and liquor.\n\nThessaloniki's old market (Kapani), in the city centre\n\nThe city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland.[6][94] In the first six months of 2010, more that 7.2 million tons of products went through the city's port,[95] making it one of the largest and most used ports in the Balkans. As a result of this, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe,[96] carrying among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries. Recently Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.[94] The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port,[97] and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interested in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations.[97] A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.[97]\n\nIn recent years, the city has suffered industrial restructuring and lost many jobs; while it is moving toward a more service-based economy. A spate of factory shut downs has occurred as companies take advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations in other areas. Among the largest companies to shut down factories are Goodyear,[98] AVEZ (the first industrial factory in northern Greece, built in 1926),[99] and VIAMIL (ÎÎÎÎÎ¥Î). Nevertheless Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry, the Macedonian Milk Industry and Philkeram Johnson. A considerable percentage of the city's working force is employed in small and medium-sized businesses, as well as in the service and the public sectors.\n\nThe GDP of the prefecture of Thessaloniki was â¬18.4 billion (US$25.4 billion) in 2004,[100] and the GDP per capita of the prefecture was â¬17,394 (US$24,027),[100] which was above Greece's GDP per capita at the time (US$20,000).[101]\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical ethnic statistics\n\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of 19th and the beginning of 20th century.\n\nYear Total Population Jewish Population Turkish (Muslim) Population Greek Population Bulgarian Population Roma Population Other groups\n\n1890[102] 118,000 55,000 26,000 16,000 10,000 2,500 8,500\n\naround 1913[103] 157,889 61,439 45,889 39,956 6,263 2,721 1,621\n\nPopulation growth\n\nEthnic composition of Thessaloniki between 1500 and 1950.\n\nThe population growth of the municipality of Thessaloniki since 1348.\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populated municipality of all the municipalities that are part of the Thessaloniki Urban Area and make up the \"City of Thessaloniki\".

Thessaloniki became the largest center of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city la madre de Israel (Israel's mother)[64] and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". [108] It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community comprised more than half the city's population; the Jews were dominant in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the DÃ¶nmeh (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade.[109] Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Ladino, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.[110]\n\nThe great fire of 1917 burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out.[60] Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.[111]\n\nAfter the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the expulsion of Greeks from Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted the Jews the same civil rights as other Greek citizens.[60] In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay.\n\nWorld War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance and Italian forces (before 1943) tried to protect the Jews and managed to save some.[64] By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"[112]\n\nIn 1943 the Nazis began actions against the Jews in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 96% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust.[64] Today, a community of around 1200 remains in the city.[64] Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews â both Sephardic and Romaniote â live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel.[64] Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jews of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\".\n\nYear Total\n\npopulation Jewish\n\npopulation Jewish\n\npercentage Source[60]\n\n1842 70,000 36,000 51% Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer\n\n1870 90,000 50,000 56% Greek schoolbook (G.K.

Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Olympion Theater, the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\n\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\n\nThe city has always been known between Greeks for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafe's and bars per-capita than any other city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Only recently has the city been exposing itself to the world and becoming more known for what it is, with Lonely Planet listing Thessaloniki as the world's fifth-best ultimate party city.[118]\n\nPart of the coastline of the southeastern suburb of Peraia in Thermaikos, with views towards Thessaloniki.\n\nParks and recreation\n\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are low, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of Î§ÎÎÎ/Palios Zoologikos Kipos (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range),[119] the park of Pedio tou Areos, pulling in crowds throughout the year, and the parks of the Nea Paralia (waterfront) that span for 3 km (2 mi) along the coast, from the White Tower to the concert hall.\n\nThe Nea Paralia parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined up with several cafÃ©s and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"the volta\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Today half of the waterfront has been revitalised, while works have already started for the revitalisation of the rest, to include a further 8 thematic gardens with the large modernisation overhaul.[120]\n\nThessalonikiâs proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe, however the city is also right next to the Seich Sou forest national park, just 3.5 km (2 mi) away from Thessalonikiâs city center; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths.[121]\n\nOther recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area include the Fragma Thermis, a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city center; while urban beaches that have continuously been awarded the blue flags,[122] are located along the 10 km (6 mi) coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos, about 20 km (12 mi) away from the city center.\n\nMuseums and galleries\n\nMain article: List of museums in Greece\n\nDue to the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history.

It is also the birthplace of various Saints and other religious figures, such as Cyril and Methodius, creators of the first Slavic alphabet, Saint Mitre, Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople and Archbishop Demetrios of America. Many of Greece's most celebrated musicians and movie stars were born in Thessaloniki, such as Zoe Laskari, Costas Hajihristos, Antonis Remos, Paschalis Terzis, Natassa Theodoridou, Katia Zygouli, Kostas Voutsas, Stavros Damianides, Marios Iliopoulos and Marinella. Additionally, there have been a number of political leaders born in the city Evangelos Venizelos, the current Minister of Finance of Greece, Haris Kastanidis, current Minister for the Interior, Christos Sartzetakis, fourth President of Greece, Kostas Zouraris and Ioannis Passalidis.

Two of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University and the University of Macedonia. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece[9] by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010,[9] and is a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year 2009-2010, Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for arts and humanities and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings,[158] making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide.[159] Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities and the best university in Greece, at number 97.[160] Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki,[161] which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\n\nAdditionally, a TEI (Technological Educational Institute) is located in the western suburb of Sindos, home also to the industrial zone of the city. Numerous public and private vocational institutes (Greek: IEK) provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006 the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.[162]\n\nTransport\n\nBus transport\n\nMain article: Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization\n\nAn OASTH bus.\n\nPublic transport in Thessaloniki is served by buses. The bus company operating in the city is the Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) and is the only public means of transport in Thessaloniki at the moment. It operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area. International and regional bus links are provided at the Macedonia Central Bus Station (intercity buses terminal), located west of the city centre.\n\nRailways\n\nMain article: New Railway Station\n\nSee also: Proastiakos\n\nThe city is a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Moscow, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul, alongside Athens and other destinations in Greece. It is the most important railway hub of Greece and has the biggest marshalling yard in the country.\n\nView of the railway station.\n\nThessaloniki's railway passenger station, is called the \"New Railway Station\" and was completed in 1961,[163] remaining largely unchanged ever since. Currently it features large waiting areas, a central hall, cafes, restaurants and a shopping center. Discussions are underway for the expansion of the station and a general modernisation overhaul, which will also include a hotel and a revamp of the central offices of the Hellenic Railways Organization for northern Greece.[164] A metro station is currently also under construction at the station.\n\nCommuter rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service operates using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 refurbished stations, covering the journey in an 1 hour and 33 minutes. An additional commuter rail service has also been established, although with the use of regional trains, between Thessaloniki and the city of Edessa. The train service within Greece, including the Proastiakos, is operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company. As of 2011, due to the financial crisis international services have been suspended.\n\nThessaloniki Metro\n\nMain article: Thessaloniki Metro\n\nThessaloniki Metro map.\n\nThe construction of the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway began in 2006 and is scheduled for completion in late 2014.[165] The line of Phase 1 is set to extend over 9.6 kilometres (6.0 mi), include 13 stations[166] and it is expected to eventually serve 250,000 passengers daily.[167] Some stations of the Thessaloniki Metro will house a number of archaeological finds.[168]\n\nDiscussions are already underway for future expansions, in order for the metro network to also serve major transport hubs of the city, notably the Macedonia Central Bus Station (intercity buses terminal) and Macedonia International Airport. For the expansion towards the airport, the Attiko Metro company is considering the construction of an overground network or a monorail. The expansion to Kalamaria, a southeast borough of Thessaloniki, has already become part of the initial construction phase, while future expansions are considered and planned for Efkarpia to the north and Evosmos to the west. The strategic plan for the construction of the Thessaloniki Metro envisions that the city will have a system of 3 lines by 2018 or 2020 at the latest.[169]\n\nMacedonia International Airport\n\nMain article: Macedonia International Airport\n\nMacedonia International Airport passengers' terminal.\n\nAir traffic to and from the city is served by Macedonia International Airport for international and domestic flights. The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not currently support intercontinental flights, although a major extension, lengthening one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf is under construction, despite considerable opposition from local environmentalist groups. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. A master-plan, with designs for a new terminal building and apron have also been released; and is seeking for either public and private funding.\n\nMotorways\n\nFurther information: List of Greek roads\n\nRoad map of Thessaloniki and its suburbs from OpenStreetMap.\n\nThe city is bypassed by a C-shaped ring road. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in Lachanagora District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of Seich Sou and through to the southeast borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the ÎÎ67 (in the near future to be expanded as A25) motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs. This route is labeled as the Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: ÎÏÏÏÎµÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® Î ÎµÏÎ¹ÏÎµÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ® ÎÎ´ÏÏ, inner ring road) of Thessaloniki and is generally accepted as the \"boundary\" between the city proper (Thessaloniki Urban Area) and its suburbs.\n\nThe speed limit on this motorway is 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph), it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link. Although the large efford that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features, it still does not feature an emergency lane. New plans have surfaced to upgrade the motorway to address the current issues, while also adding one more lane in each direction.\n\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: ÎÎ¾ÏÏÎµÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® Î ÎµÏÎ¹ÏÎµÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ® ÎÎ´ÏÏ, outer ring road) is planned, with its west part already built and running as part of the A1/A2 motorways, passing through the outer northwestern suburbs of the city.\n\nMotorways:\n\nA1/E75 W (FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) , Athens, Larissa)\n\nA2/E90 N' (Turkey, Alexandroupolis, Kavala, Xanthi, Igoumenitsa, Ioannina, Kozani)\n\nA25(ÎÎ12)/Î79 Î (Serres, Bulgaria)\n\nA25(ÎÎ67) S (Airport, Nea Moudania)\n\nNational Roads:\n\nÎÎ12/Î79 Î (Serres, Drama)\n\nÎÎ16, SW (Polygyros, Ouranopolis)\n\nÎÎ65, Î (Kilkis, Doirani)\n\nInternational relations\n\nCommemorative stele in Melbourne.\n\nTwin towns â Sister cities\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Greece\n\nThessaloniki is twinned with:[170]\n\nTowns\n\nUnited States Hartford, United States since March 5, 1962[171]\n\nEgypt Alexandria, Egypt, since July 12, 1993\n\nItaly Bologna, Italy, since October 20, 1984\n\nSlovakia Bratislava, Slovakia, since April 23, 1986[172]\n\nGermany Cologne, Germany, since May 3, 1988\n\nRomania ConstanÅ£a, Romania, since July 5, 1988\n\nTurkey Akhisar, Turkey, since August 25, 1988\n\nIndia Kolkata, India since January 1, 2005\n\nAlbania KorÃ§Ã«, Albania since October 14, 2005\n\nGermany Leipzig, Germany, since October 17, 1984\n\nCyprus Limassol, Cyprus, since June 30, 1984\n\nAustralia Melbourne, Australia since March 19, 1984[173]\n\nFrance Nice, France, since March 20, 1992\n\nBulgaria Plovdiv, Bulgaria, since February 27, 1984\n\nUnited States San Francisco, United States since August 6, 1990[174]\n\nIsrael Tel Aviv, Israel, since November 24, 1994\n\nTurkey Amasya, Turkey, since August 25, 2001\n\nChina Tianjin, China since March 4, 2002\n\nChina Dongguan, China since October 24, 2008\n\nSouth Korea Busan, South Korea since March 8, 2010\n\nCollaborations\n\nUnited States Boston, United States since April 21, 1996\n\nUnited States Brooklyn Center, United States since July 5, 1992\n\nHungary Budapest, Hungary since April 5, 1993\n\nUkraine Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine since April 18, 2003\n\nArmenia Gyumri, Armenia since November 23, 2000\n\nFrance Marseille, France, since June 4, 1991\n\nUnited States Philadelphia, United States since April 1, 2004\n\nRussia Saint Petersburg, Russia, since 2003\n\nChina Shenyang, China since March 23, 2000\n\nCanada Toronto, Canada since September 5, 1986\n\nItaly Venice, Italy, since July 17, 2003\n\nLibya Tripoli, Libya, since June 23, 2007\n\nTurkey Ä°zmir, Turkey, since February 6, 2009\n\nGallery\n\nDetail from the Arch of Galerius.\n\nView of Yeni Mosque, built during the ottoman period.\n\nAerial view of the City Centre.\n\nThe Metropolitan Church of Saint Gregory Palamas.\n\nThessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum (also known as NOESIS).\n\nArt Nouveau building at the center of the city.\n\nView of the seafront.\n\nView of Thessaloniki center.\n\nPart of Thessaloniki at night.\n\nSee also\n\nHistory of Greece\n\nMacedonians (Greeks)\n\nGreat Thessaloniki Fire of 1917\n\nThessaloniki International Airport\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nApostolos Papagiannopoulos,Monuments of Thessaloniki, Rekos Ltd, date unknown.\n\nApostolos P.
