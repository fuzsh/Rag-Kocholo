On the morning of June 6, 1329, Karadeniz, in late afternoon Gülcemal, left pier at Seman. I also got on board Gülcemal. We've bid farewell to five centuries of Turkish rule of Western Rumelia. When the sun went down, the coast of Albania was gradually ceasing to be visible in front of our eyes. The cession of the part of our homeland, where our ancestors irrigated with their blood for centuries and many old and new martyrs were buried, brought unacceptable heartbreak and nostalgia to our hearts. Today, Western Rumelia that is the victim of ignorance and politics, was fluttering in pathetic sorrows.[19]

On February 15, 1918, he wrote to Erich von Falkenhayn, serious problems with the inefficient lines of communication and the supply and recruiting Zone proportionate with the strength and situation of the army.

Sheikh Said Rebellion and the Reform Plan for the East

Dersim Rebellion

According to Hasan Rıza Soyak, who was Atatürk's secretary, Atatürk said to him about his successor, Of course, the right to speak and elect belongs to nation and its representative Grand National Assembly. But I'll state my opinion about this issue. Firstly İsmet Paşa comes to mind; he has performed many great contributions to this country. However, for some reason he seems not to get public sympathy. So he should not be very attractive. And Mareşal Fevzi Çakmak, he has great contributions in this country and also he fared well with everyone, he always has appreciated opinions of owners of authority; he is in a fight with nobody. In this regard, I think he is the most appropriate friend for the Head of State.[31]

He retired on January 12, 1944.[26]
