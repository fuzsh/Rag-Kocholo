        "text": "The Incredible Hulk (2008) is a superhero film based on the fictional Marvel Comics character The Hulk, and is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nDirected by Louis Leterrier. Written by Zak Penn.\n\nOn June 13, get ready to unleash the beast. (taglines)\n\n[Speaking Portuguese poorly] Don't make me– hungry. You wouldn't like me when I'm– hungry. [Pause, in English] Wait, that's not right.\n\n[After jumping from a helicopter and realizing that he's not transforming] Oh, shit!\n\nI've run into bad situations on crap missions before. I've seen good men go down purely because someone didn't let us in on what we were walking into, I've moved onto the next one, 'cause that's what we do, right? I mean that's the job, but THIS? This is a whole new level of weird, and I don't feel inclined to step away from it. So if you're taking another crack at him…I want in. AND with respect, you should be looking for a team that's prepped and ready to fight, because if that thing shows up again, you're going to have a lot of professional tough guys PISSING in their PANTS, sir.\n\nYou don't deserve this power!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nMaj. Kathleen \"Kat\" Sparr: Here's something interesting. Possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee. Man drank one of those guarana sodas…guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for.\n\n[Scene cuts to a man opening his fridge, reaching for a soda, opening it and drinking.]\n\nMilwaukee Man: Wow. [drops the bottle]\n\n[After Blonsky's mission to Brazil to recapture Banner goes awry.]\n\nEmil Blonsky: Forgive me, sir, but…doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? Because he didn't lose us. And he was not alone, sir. We had him, but then something hit us. Something big hit us. IT THREW A FORKLIFT TRUCK LIKE IT WAS A SOFTBALL! It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: Well, it's gone.\n\nBlonsky: Well, if Banner knows what it is, I'm gonna track him down, I'm gonna put my foot on his throat, and I'm gonna–\n\nGen. Ross: That was Banner. It was Banner.\n\nBlonsky: [understandably confused] You'll have to explain that, sir.\n\nGen. Ross: No, I don't. You've done a good job. Pack up and get our men on a plane. We're going home.\n\n[Ross briefs Blonsky about Banner.]\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: You must realize what I'm about to tell you is very sensitive, both to me and the Army. You know that we have a Bio-Force Department, and that we had a bio-force enhancement project developed during World War II.\n\nEmil Blonsky: A super-soldier.\n\nThaddeus \"Thunderbotl\" Ross: A simplification, but yes. We decided to dust it off and give it another go, aiming to create a better soldier. Banner's work was very early phase. It wasn’t even weapons application. He thought he was working on radiation resistance. I would never have told him what the project really was. But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself. And something went very wrong– or it went very right. As far as I’m concerned, that man’s whole body is property of the U.S. Army.\n\nEmil Blonsky: You said he wasn’t working on weapons, right?\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbotl\" Ross: No.\n\nEmil Blonsky: But you were. You were, weren’t you? You were trying other things.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: One serum we developed…was very promising.\n\nEmil Blonsky: So why did he run?\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: He's a scientist. He is not one of us.\n\nBetty Ross: Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just walk in and talk to my father.\n\nBruce Banner: He told me what he was gonna do. He wants it out of me. He wants to dissect it so he can replicate it. He wants to make it a weapon.\n\nBetty Ross: What is it like? When it happens, what do you experience?\n\nBruce Banner: Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard? Those induced hallucinations? It’s a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified. It’s like someone poured a liter of acid into my brain.\n\nBetty Ross: Do you remember anything?\n\nBruce Banner: Just fragments. Images. There's too much noise, I can never derive anything out of it.\n\nBetty Rose: But then, it's still you, inside of it–\n\nBruce Banner: No. No, it's not.\n\nBetty Ross: I don’t know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me. Maybe your mind is in there, it's just overcharged and can't process what's happening–\n\nBruce Banner: I don't want to control it. I want to get rid of it.\n\n[After Blonsky has every bone in his body shattered during a fight with the Hulk.]\n\nMaj. Kathleen Sparr: Sir, Blonsky.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: [Expecting the worst] Does anyone know if he had any next-of-kin or family?\n\nMaj. Sparr: Ask him yourself.\n\nEmil Blonsky: [In perfect health, salutes Ross] Sir.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: Betty–\n\nBetty Ross: I will never forgive what you've done to him.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: He's a fugitive.\n\nBetty Ross: You made him a fugitive. To cover your failures, and to protect your career. Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: It's only because you're my daughter that you're not in handcuffs too.\n\n[General Ross meets with Betty's boyfriend.]\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: You did the right thing contacting us. Leonard, I need to know where they're going. She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.\n\nDr. Leonard Samson: From who? He protected her, you almost killed her.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.\n\nDr. Leonard Samson: You know, it's a point of professional pride for me that I can tell when somebody's lying. And you are. I don't know where he's going. I know she'll help him if she can.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: Then she's aiding a fugitive. And I can't help either one of them. [Walks off]\n\nDr. Leonard Samson: I used to wonder why she never talked about you. Now I know.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderblot\" Ross: [To himself] Where does she meet these guys?\n\nMaj. Kathleen Sparr: Are you telling me you can make more like him?\n\nDr. Samuel Sterns: No, not yet! I've sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty, if that's what you're asking. He was a freak accident, the goal is to do it better!\n\nMaj. Sparr: So Banner was the only– [Knocked unconscious]\n\nEmil Blonsky: Aah, she's an annoying bitch, isn't she?\n\nDr. Samuel Sterns: Why are you always hitting people?! [Blonsky pulls out his gun and points it at Dr. Sterns] Now what…could I have possibly done…to deserve such aggression?\n\nEmil Blonsky: [Mumbling agitatedly] It's not what you've done, it's what you're gonna do. [Dr. Sterns raises his head, interested] I want what you've got off Banner, I want that.\n\nDr. Samuel Sterns: [Rising] You look like…you've got a little something in you already, don't you?\n\nEmil Blonsky: Yeah, well, I want more. You've seen what he becomes, right?\n\nDr. Samuel Sterns: I have…and it's beautiful. Godlike.\n\nEmil Blonsky: I want that…I need that. Make me that.\n\nDr. Samuel Sterns: I don't know what you've got inside you already. The mixture could become…an abomination. [Blonsky grabs Dr. Sterns by the collar and raises him into the air] I didn't say I was unwilling…I just need informed consent…and you've given it!\n\n[In New York City]\n\nBetty Ross: The subway is probably quickest.\n\nBruce Banner: Me? In a metal tube, deep underground with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?\n\nBetty Ross: …right, let's get a cab.\n\n[One very stressful cab ride later.]\n\nBetty Ross: [Kicking the cab door as she gets out] ASSHOLE!!!\n\nBruce Banner: You know, I know a few techniques that could help you manage that anger effectively—\n\nBetty Ross: You zip it! We're walking.\n\nBruce Banner: …okay.\n\nAbomination: [About to kill Ross with a huge chain] General…any last words?\n\nHulk: [Rouses] HULK…SMASH!! [Smashes the ground]\n\n[Pre-credits scene: General Ross sulks at a bar]\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: [Drinks shot] Reload. [Barkeep gets another shot; Ross chugs the shot] Reload.\n\nTony Stark: [approaches Ross] Mmmm, the smell of stale beer and defeat. Y'know, I hate to say \"I told you so,\" General, but that Super-Soldier program was put on ice for a reason. [Appears as Tony Stark] I've always felt that hardware was much more reliable.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: Stark.\n\nTony Stark: General.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: You always wear such nice suits.\n\nTony Stark: Touché. I hear you have an unusual problem.\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: You should talk.\n\nTony Stark: You should listen. [Ross leans in a bit as Stark whispers] What if I told you we were putting a team together?\n\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: Who's \"we\"?\n\n[Stark clears his throat, looks at Ross, and smiles.]\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 13, get ready to unleash the beast.\n\nThis summer, our only hope is something incredible\n\nThis June, a hero shows his true colors\n\nYou'll like him when he's angry.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nEdward Norton – Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk\n\nLiv Tyler – Betty Ross\n\nTim Roth – Major Emil Blonsky / Abomination\n\nTim Blake Nelson – Dr. Samuel Sterns\n\nTy Burrell – Dr. Leonard Samson\n\nWilliam Hurt – Gen.

Banner is a tortured character, and an alternate opening had him trying to commit suicide on a desolate mountaintop before the Hulk breaks out and crushes the gun. What separates Hulk from his Marvel compatriots is that Banner has no agency in his superpower. He didn’t want to become the Hulk; the best he can do is bury the beast, and when it breaks out, he loses almost all control. That’s not heroism; that’s desperation, and it’s tough to squeeze a fun summer action movie in there.\n\nMatt Goldberg, \"‘The Incredible Hulk’ Revisited: “Leave Me Alone”\" Collider, April 10, 2018\n\nWell, my own feeling is that in the first two (Hulk films), they made him too powerful. I never conceived of him that way, and I didn't think it was necessary for him to be that big. I thought he could’ve been seven and a half feet tall. That's quite enough.\n\nStan Lee \"Why Hulk Movies Didn't Work According to Stan Lee\", by Eric Eisenberg, Cinemablend, 2015.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nThe Incredible Hulk quotes at the Internet Movie Database"
