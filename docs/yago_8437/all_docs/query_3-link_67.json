However, composer Steven Schwartz revealed his intentions to pen “at least two” new songs for the filmed version.\n\nSchwartz told Variety in May 2017 that there are “new songs planned” and the movie won’t be an exact replica of the Broadway show. “There are things that work on stage but won’t work on film. In order to do something that will work on its own merits, you have to do something different,\" he said at the time. “The only concern is people who would be coming expecting to see a filmed version of the play. They’re not going to see that.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Universal Pictures\n\nTwo Movies\n\nChu announced in April 2022 that the film adaptation would be split into two movies.\n\n\"Here's what happened: As we prepared the production over the last year, it became impossible to wrestle the story of WICKED into a single film without doing some real damage to it,” the director wrote in a statement via Twitter. “As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. We decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one WICKED movie but TWO!!!! With more space, we can tell the story of WICKED as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Universal Pictures\n\nHello, Fiyero!\n\nChu confirmed in September 2022 that Bridgerton star Jonathan Bailey would join the cast as leading man Fiyero.\n\n“He’s perfect, they’re perfect. They’d be perfect together. Born to be forever….. I am too excited to pretend this hasn’t been happening. We have a Fiyero,” the director excitedly tweeted at the time, shortly before Bailey and Grande applauded the news via their respective Instagrams.\n\n“I think the fans of the original musical should prepare to get their minds blown,” Bailey told E! News in November 2023. “It's such a psychologically rich material. And we know it as really exciting theater with an incredible score and amazing numbers, but when you put it on film, the reality of these characters and the nuances of their psychology, it's just going to blow everyone's mind.”\n\nBailey told Andy Cohen on his “Radio Andy” show earlier that month that he filmed Wicked, Netflix’s Bridgerton and USA’s Fellow Travelers concurrently.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jon M Chu/Instagram\n\nThat’s a Wrap\n\nAfter taking a filming hiatus during the SAG-AFTRA union strike in late 2023, they resumed production after the winter holidays. Filming concluded in January 2024.\n\n“Thank you to the massive crew and cast and @universalpictures pictures for supporting the most ambitious cinematic production I have ever been a part of or, frankly, ever witnessed,” Chu gushed via Instagram. “We built real Munchkinland! A multi-level Shiz University Campus! I walked and shopped in a real Emerald City and met the actual Wizard head that moved in real time!! And to fill that space with the insane LIVE vocals of [the entire cast]?!! Most of the year my jaw has been on the floor and [my] heart in the clouds.”\n\nGrande also marked the end of filming the “wildly large production” with her own social media tribute.\n\n“With so many brilliant human beings who worked so so hard in every department … every single person that worked on these films was not only the absolute best at what they do but made every single day for over a year feel so incredibly safe,” she penned via Instagram Story. “My heart sincerely, physically aches that I will not be sharing every day with this crew anymore. Thank you for your brilliance and the many handholds and hugs along the way.”\n\nCredit: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nA Dr. Dillamond Is Found\n\nDuring a June 2023 appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Yang confirmed that the talking goat and Shiz University professor Doctor Dillamond will indeed be in the films, much to Andy Cohen's chagrin.\n\n\"The goat is staying, unfortunately, the goat is in,\" the Saturday Night Live personality said as Cohen groaned and rolled his eyes.\n\nWhen asked who was portraying the role, Yang replied: \"Right now it’s a lovely puppeteer. They’re going to cast her later, but right now it’s a puppeteer named Louisa and she’s been doing amazing line reads.”\n\nUniversal Pictures announced at CinemaCon in April 2024 that it had found its goat in Peter Dinklage, who will voice the character of Dr. Dillamond in the movie musical."
