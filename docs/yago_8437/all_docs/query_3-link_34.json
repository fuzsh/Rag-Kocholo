        "text": "Director Sir Ridley Scott has been made a Knight Grand Cross in honour of his services to the UK film industry.\n\nThe 86-year-old, whose films include Gladiator, Blade Runner and Alien, attended a ceremony at Windsor Castle hosted by the Prince of Wales.\n\nSir Ridley, who was born in South Shields and studied at West Hartlepool College of Art, received a knighthood in 2002.\n\nOthers receiving honours on Wednesday included former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton and Uefa Women's Euro 2022-winning goalkeeper Mary Earps.\n\nSir Ridley began his career as a set designer for the BBC but was quickly promoted to director and worked on classic TV shows, including the popular police series Z Cars.\n\nIn 1977, he made his first foray into movies with The Duellists, which won the jury prize for best first work at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHe followed it with the landmark science fiction films Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982).\n\nAlien, starring Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, would go on to become what Bafta described as \"one of the most influential science fiction films of all time\".\n\nSir Ridley was honoured with a Bafta Fellowship in 2018.\n\nPeter Shilton was made a CBE for his services to football and the prevention of gambling harm.\n\nThe 74-year-old holds the England men's team caps record with 125 appearances between 1970 and 1990.\n\nMary Earps, who was named the 2023 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, was made an MBE.\n\nFormer rugby player and chairman of the Rugby Football Union Sir Bill Beaumont saw his knighthood upgraded to a Knight Grand Cross for services to rugby and charity.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA Media"
