        "text": "I'd rather have a Windy City Heat 2 but the The Hammer will have to suffice. | Photo courtesy of Hammer the Movie\n\nI've been a devoted fan of Adam Carolla since his early days on Loveline so don't expect any objectivity in my coverage of The Hammer. I've been waiting to see this movie since it played at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and tomorrow it finally hits theaters. Even non-fans of the Aceman should enjoy this punchy tale about a rundown former boxer who gets back into the ring to give it one last shot (think Rocky but funny). All it's missing is a Carolla beat-down of the dreadful, show-wrecking Danny Bonaduce. Bring back Dave Dameshek!\n\nI'm usually a solid supporter of Judd Apatow and his many creative progeny, but I'm finding it hard to get excited about the Apatow-produced and Seth Rogen-scripted Drillbit Taylor. Since it's rated PG-13, there will be none of the raunchy humor that is a staple of the brand. And let's face it--absent the adult content--would Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin or Superbad really be all that funny? I'm planning to skip Taylor and pin my hopes on Judd's upcoming Pineapple Express. Early word is that it's a hysterical return to form.\n\nAn ill-advised decision to go all-in with 7, 2, off-suit | Photo courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment\n\nI'm a big fan of poker and an even bigger fan of Woody Harrelson so going to see The Grand is a no-brainer for me. I'm not expecting Rounders-level excellence, just a funny take on one of my favorite games. The cast, incidentally, is loaded: David Cross, Dennis Farina, Gabe Kaplan! Plus, Zak Penn previously directed what I consider to be a minor classic, Incident at Loch Ness. Might be a Hammer, Grand double-feature Saturday.\n\nDoes anyone else see an eerie correspondence between Tyler Perry and Judd Apatow? Both seem to have movies they've had a hand in hitting the theaters every couple of weeks. Meet the Browns is Perry's latest. I love Angela Bassett, but Perry's movies seem to be so pathologically life-affirming that I'll probably pass.\n\nNow that Hollywood has started to run out of Japanese horror movies to re-make, they've turned to Thailand for fresh inspiration. Shutter is a re-tread of 2004's Shutter. It stars the cute and bland Joshua Jackson and the cute and equally bland Rachael Taylor. It's a PG-13 rated horror film which means that, on principle, I won't see it.\n\nUnder the Same Moon reeks of cliche so strongly that I'm not sure I can endure it. Basically, a little boy struggles to emigrate from Mexico to the U.S. to reunite with his mother after his grandma dies. I can't be sure, but I'm expecting a negative portrayal of the Border Patrol. Save your money and rent El Norte instead.\n\nAfter its initial explosion in the 1980s, I thought that breakdancing would quickly go the way of the dodo (or parachute pants). As Planet B-Boy demonstrates, though, the dancing sub-culture is thriving all around the world. Having neither rhythm, strength nor flexibility I can only marvel at the wild talent on display.\n\nTickets & Showtimes\n\nThe Hammer\n\nDrillbit Taylor\n\nThe Grand\n\nMeet the Browns\n\nShutter\n\nUnder the Same Moon\n\nPlanet B-Boy\n\nReviews\n\nThe Hammer\n\nDrillbit Taylor\n\nThe Grand\n\nMeet the Browns\n\nShutter\n\nUnder the Same Moon\n\nPlanet B-Boy\n\nPreviews\n\nThe Hammer\n\nDrillbit Taylor\n\nThe Grand\n\nMeet the Browns\n\nShutter\n\nUnder the Same Moon\n\nPlanet B-Boy"
