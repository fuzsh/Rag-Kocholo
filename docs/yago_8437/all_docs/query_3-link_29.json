These films expose and often criticize humanity’s biggest and deadliest conflicts, either by showing it upfront, like Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory, or satirizing it up, like Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator. While execution and delivery differs, the core message of these films stays the same: to depict the inhumanity of war.\n\nDirector Jean Renoir attacked the genre in an intricately…\n\nFrontiers are an invention of men.\n\n-Lieutenant Rosenthal\n\nWhile some films have incredibly interesting stories in regards to it's pre-prodcution and production, Jean Renoir's first huge financial and critical success, La Grande Illusion, took on a life of it's own after it's release and it's lasted over 75 years. It's no exaggeration, film historians to this day disagree on some of the film's most famous underlying themes with some seeing the film as pro-socialist and anti-semitic while others see it as anti-war and pro-democratic.\n\nWhether it's the fact that the film's public perception changed drastically by some a mere two years after it's realease when World War II broke out forcing cuts to be made in the film so the…\n\nGrand Illusion is a pacifist war movie, without any physical battles. It is a story of how men will be men, people are just people, we can find commonality in all of us. It is a humanist masterwork.\n\nClass is the overarching theme of Grand Illusion. Officers are nice to each other, as politeness and civility is part of privilege. Upper class characters are seen as more trustworthy. The trappings of class produce expectations that cannot be avoided. World War One was the end of aristocracy, yet Grand Illusion depicts the delusion of friendship between captor and captive. Aristocrats care for each other above nationality. They have a respect for duty, and the film shows a baseline of racism and…\n\n76/100\n\nThought I loved this but turns out I just strongly admire it. In a way, it's too humanistic for its own good—I've been sitting here for a while trying to convince myself that Renoir intended the title as an indictment of his own utopian vision, but that interpretation is too bonkers even for me. While class trumping nationalism makes for a provocative thesis, I feel like I know too much about war and dehumanization to believe that it's ever been so civilized in practice; even when Von Stroheim's sneering at non-aristocratic names like Maréchal and (egad) Rosenthal, he sounds far more respectful than [extremely contemporary political reference elided; you're welcome]. Renoir's genius is that he makes you want to…\n\nAny film Goebbels cited as ‘Cinematic Public Enemy Number One’ is something to be proud of. Perhaps my hopes were a little too high going in though, the horrific elements of war seeming all too peripheral in this highly revered classic. For 1937, Grand Illusion stepped into uncharted territory like no film had before, its romantic focus on the universal compassion among men remaining influential some 80 years later. It’s impossible to knock the details in Renoir’s depiction of this era, himself having served in the First World War. The very fact this is a war film without any depiction of battle is the source of its genius, and yet part of me feels that to be generally untrue. Although…\n\n“Grand Illusion” is a master class in cinematic simplicity. When a film exists not just onscreen, but in the human soul, it endures without complication or end.\n\nConflict is just a spectre on the horizon in Jean Renoir’s work, even though it unfolds largely inside a German-run prisoner of war camp.\n\nMuch is made of the ‘illusions’ of philosophy, literature, theatre, and painting that help the detained soldiers of the film pass their time. But one not need dig too far into subtext to unearth the truth that these apparitions are the true form of the heart; not the war that surrounds them.\n\nRenoir accomplishes such an astounding amount with what seems like so little in “Illusion.” The plot is…"
