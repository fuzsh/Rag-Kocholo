        "text": "The Golden Nugget is one of the most popular casinos in the world. These are the top 5 films that were partially filmed within the world famous gambling hall. Las Vegas famous for its thriving gambling scene is home to numerous luxurious, first-class hotels and casinos, and needless to say, some of these served as movie sets for many iconic gambling-inspired movies. Located on 129 Fremont Street Las Vegas is the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino. With an unusual Gold Rush theme, this Landry’s Inc. owned and operated venue has over two thousand rooms and of course, a massive casino floor with every imaginable casino game.\n\nThe property’s total gaming space is 38,000 square feet and it was expanded several times since the venue opened its doors in 1946. The Golden Nugget Online Casino opened its virtual doors quite recently following the footsteps of other Las Vegas land-based casinos.\n\nOver the years, many amazing movies were partly filmed at the luxurious property including Viva Las Vegas with Elvis Presley, Vegas Vacation, Diamond Are Forever released in 1971, Smokin’ Aces from 2006, and Next with Nicolas Cage, Wild Card, The Grand, and The Gambler. Further, we take a look at the top five most popular movies associated with the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino.\n\nWild Card\n\nReleased in 2015, Wild Card follows a bodyguard working in Las Vegas with a serious gambling problem. The main character in the movie is Nick Wild played by Jason Statham, while Domini Garcia, Michael Angarano, and Milo Ventimiglia also give extraordinary performances. Nick Wild is forced to take a series of odd jobs to support his gambling addiction. In one scene, Nick heads to the Golden Nugget Hotel $ Casino under disguise to confront an enemy of his.\n\nThe Grand\n\nThe Grand movie directed by Zak Penn stars David Cross, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Farina, and Cheryl Hines. The movie was released in 2007 and it follows an unusual crew of people as they compete in a poker tournament and this poker tournament is held at the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino.\n\nThe Gambler\n\nThe Gambler released in 2015 with Ion Sapdaru, Andi Vasluianu, and Oana Pellea is set in the gambling capital. It follows an Eastern-European family as they explore the thriving gambling scene of Las Vegas. In the movie, the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino appears in several scenes as this wealthy family meets with various characters whose opinion of them is based on deception.\n\nViva Las Vegas\n\nWhen discussing popular movies associated with the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, we have to mention Elver Presley’s Viva Las Vegas movie. The movie was released in 1964 and it follows young Lucky Jackson played by Elves Presley as he prepares for the Grand Prix. Lucky is struggling financially so he has to put his career as a professional race car driver on hold and he takes a job as a waiter at the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino. The movie shows Las Vegas in a fairly glamorous way, a narrative that’s been broken in more recent movies like the Las Vegas Story.\n\nVegas Vacation\n\nFans of comedy movies are probably familiar with Vegas Vacation with Chevy Chase, Randy Quaid, Wayne Newton, and Beverly D’Angelo. The movie was released in 1997 and it follows Clark Griswold played by Chevy Chase and his family as they take a well-deserved vacation. The family heads to Las Vegas and the greatest adventure begins followed by numerous misadventures. The movie was partly filmed at the iconic Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino property."
