        "text": "Actor Terrence Howard — who earned an Academy Award nomination for his lead role in Craig Brewer's locally produced \"Hustle & Flow\" — will return to Memphis Nov. 8 to host the Bluff City debut of his new movie, as part of an event dubbed \"An Evening with Terrence Howard.\"\n\nThe film is \"Showdown at the Grand,\" which apparently mixes appeals to both cinephilia and bloodlust, with Howard cast as the owner of an independent movie theater who enlists a veteran action star (Dolph Lundgren) to battle the corporate thugs seeking to tear down his beloved historic cinema in favor of a more profitable real-estate development.\n\nDistributed by Shout! Studios, the movie appears to be pitched at the audience that made a hit out of \"Violent Night,\" which cast David Harbour as a Ramboesque Santa Claus. As the film's trailer promises: \"Lights — camera — so much action.\" \"Some folks, they'll rob you with a six-shooter and others with a fountain pen,\" says Howard's character in the movie, quoting Woody Guthrie before strapping on a samurai sword.\n\n\"Showdown at the Grand\" will screen during \"An Evening with Terrence Howard,\" which begins at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 8 at the Malco Powerhouse, 540 S. Front. A reception will precede the movie, and later Howard will share stories and perform songs on guitar and piano — \"Tales and Tunes,\" as this portion of the event is billed.\n\nThe event is intended to launch what Howard calls his \"Bring Back the Movie Theatres!\" campaign, aimed to revitalizing independent and family-owned cinema and cinema chains (such as Malco Theatres Inc., which has been owned by the same local family for its entire century-plus history).\n\nHoward will be accompanied by his wife, Mira Pak Howard, who is a producer of the movie, which was written and directed by Orson Oblowitz.\n\nThe movie has not been submitted to the ratings board of the Motion Picture Association, but the film is \"recommended for adults, not children,\" according to a press release from the Memphis & Shelby County Film and Television Commission, which is hosting the event.\n\n\"When Terrence and Mira told me of their passion to 'Bring Back the Movie Theatres,' they spoke to my heart,\" said Film Commissioner Linn Sitler. She said the Howards understand that independent and family-owned theaters have been especially hurt by \"COVID and the streamers.\"\n\nMOVIE NEWS: A reluctant boyfriend goes to the 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' movie. Was he won over?\n\nHoward, 54, previously spent a great deal of time in Memphis in 2004, when he starred as a sensitive pimp who aspired to be a rap recording star in \"Hustle & Flow.\" The film earned Howard a Best Actor Oscar nomination and won a Best Original Song Academy Award for Juicy J, DJ Paul and Frayser Boy, for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.\" Some of his other films include \"Iron Man,\" the 2008 movie that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and \"Crash,\" the 2004 Oscar-winner for Best Picture. He also reunited with this \"Hustle\" co-star Taraji P. Henson to star in the music-industry drama series \"Empire,\" which ran six seasons on Fox.\n\nTickets are $100 each. Produced by Film Commission chair Gale Jones Carson and board member Tajuan Stout Mitchell, the event is a fundraiser for the Film Commission's workshop/apprenticeship program."
