        "text": "The actors certainly look as if they’re having a good time, and if you’re in the right mood, you might too. A disposable, moderately humorous distraction directed by Zak Penn from an idea he cooked up with Matt Bierman, “The Grand” is a strenuously faked, digital-video documentary about the ins and outs, heavy bets and close calls that take place during a high-stakes Las Vegas poker game. In truth, it’s an overcrowded party to which the rest of us have been only grudgingly invited, a would-be laugh-in with various funny types  notably Woody Harrelson, Cheryl Hines and Richard Kind  and a whole lot of slapdash filler.\n\nAlthough too long by half (it would have made a nifty YouTube clip), this 104-minute movie is so modest that you could write a review on a cocktail napkin, which is probably where Mr. Penn and Mr. Bierman outlined the story. (Mr. Penn has said that the movie was entirely improvised.) Essentially, a bunch of characters play poker; somebody wins. There’s more, though not much more, including Mr. Harrelson serenading the ladies while wearing a hairpiece that looks like something the cat coughed up. Also worth a mention is the startling image of the director Werner Herzog, as a player known only as the German, walking into a casino to the throbbing beat of 50 Cent while accompanied by bodyguards and many caged small animals.\n\nDo not ask what Mr. Herzog does with the bunny.\n\n“The Grand” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language most foul."
