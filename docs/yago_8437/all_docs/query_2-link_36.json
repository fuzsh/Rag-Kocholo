        "text": "I just realized that Zak Penn is suppose to write both Captain America and The Avengers. I see this as a huge problem because I think most of us who appreciate good writing can easily see he lacks in the screenplay department. Lets look at his past films and tell me if one of them had good writing\n\nX3\n\nFantastic Four\n\nElektra\n\nBehind Enemy Lines\n\nIncredible Hulk\n\nthe only movie on the list that has decent writing is Incredible Hulk and thats only because \"Edward Harrison\" collaberated with him. I mean C'mon Marvel. DO you honestly want this writer to handle the future of your film buisness. What do you guys think of this? I personally see it as a problem but I want to hear if anyone is fine with it\n\nYou guys need to be educated.\n\nThe new Hulk movie you saw is actually Zak Penn's script! The only thing Norton changed in it were the dialogues and couple of scenes here and there which didn't even make it in the final cut! This is why WGA gave Zak Penn the writing credits since it was his storyline and characters he wrote for this movie that were used.\n\nSeriously guys you should check your facts before posting such stuff.\n\nHell I myself hate Zak Penn for what he did to X3 and all but you need to realize that those films were under FOX stuidos banner so naturally he couldn't give his best.\n\nI thought TIH was awesome and that was under Marvel studios banner so I am all for him to continue working for marvel.\n\nYou guys need to be educated.\n\nThe new Hulk movie you saw is actually Zak Penn's script!

But in any case he could be the man to bring down the Marvel empire right when it should be at the peak of its power.\n\nAnti-Penn Petition is what we need people, lets seriously consider this.\n\nThis monkey seems to have a free pass for being involved in Marvel CB movies, I don't know if this is because he has some influential family, or it was some deal with Mephistopheles... But in any case he could be the man to bring down the Marvel empire right when it should be at the peak of its power.\n\nAnti-Penn Petition is what we need people, lets seriously consider this.\n\nThat's what I want to know!\n\nWhy is Penn the go to guy for Marvel most of the time, and even a bigger question...how did he get in this position of so called power. It's like Marvel isn't even trying to grab any professional Hollywood writers that have years of experience and background...for writing good scripts.\n\nIs it too much money for Marvel to spend, so they go for Zak because he reads comics and maybe they get a better deal with him?\n\nPenn is cheap and desperate. He apparently wrote and pleaded the WGA (who hates when non-members write screenplays) to take Edward \"Harrison\" Norton's name off of the \"written by\" credit for The Incredible Hulk so his paycheck would be bigger. He's your typical hack-for-hire of Hollywood big budget movies -- like Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who threw together screenplays for The Island, The Legend of Zorro (the bad one--the sequel), Mission: Impossible III and Transformers.\n\nPenn is a reliable guy who turns out workmanlike screenplays. His draft was one of over a dozen for X2 and he got a credit for introducing Lady Deathstryke to the screenplay and I think that may be it (but I'm not sure, that is just a rumor I heard).\n\nHe delivered a solid framework for an action movie with TIH, but apparently it was very cliche and Norton rewrote most of the dialogue giving it a more naturalistic feel and added character scenes (which were then removed by Marvel during editing) and took out silly ideas like \"Hulk vs. whales.\" What humanity there is in that movie is probably from Norton. Even so the plot mechanics of a generic script can be still seen though, like how contrived it is that Gen. Ross brings Blonsky into the fold through a short expository scene.\n\nTo see Penn's more unadulterated visions, look at his writings for Elektra, Inspector Gadget, X3 and the Fantastic Four movies. Banal-simple minded platitudes posing as dialogue and generic moments of posturing stand in for \"character development\" that serve as dead time between interesting action scenes he comes up with.\n\nReally, Marvel may just want him because he'll do whatever they say (like when he bent over and took all of Tom Rothman's \"suggestions\" for X3). What is sad is that Marvel already hired an excellent writing team for Iron Man and that should be where they're going with it. I would love to see them go outside of the box as well. Imagine Lawerence Kasadan writing Captain America! Imagine William Monahan penning The Avengers. Okay well getting Edgar Wright for Ant-Man as writer/director was inspired...but who wants to see Ant-Man?\n\nI just feel like there is a very small pool of writers for \"summer blockbusters\" in the last decade and I'd like to see Marvel go outside of that box. It worked on Iron Man, Spider-Man 2 and I'm going to assume TDK as well.\n\nPenn is cheap and desperate. He apparently wrote and pleaded the WGA (who hates when non-members write screenplays) to take Edward \"Harrison\" Norton's name off of the \"written by\" credit for The Incredible Hulk so his paycheck would be bigger.\n\nWow. WOW. Way to completely twist and distort the facts there. Whether you hate Zakk Penn or not he didn't do anything unreasonable there. Penn had a legitimate claim to the credit: He wrote the original screenplay, the plot, and the story structure, and Edward Norton's re-write mostly had to do with dialog. This lead to a dispute over who should get the credit so the WGA had to decide, and of COURSE he's going to plead his case, don't be an idiot, that's what you're SUPPOSED to do, you're supposed to make a statement why you feel you deserve the credit, I'm sure Norton made one too. It's not the \"desperate plea\" you're trying ot make it out to be, and anyway in the end the WGA decided to favour story and plot structure over dialog, which, let's be honest, was the right call. If these where just two anonymous people you had never heard with in the situation, any reasonable person would be able to say \"Well DUH, of course the guy who wrote the plot should get the credit.\"\n\nThere are plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike Zak Penn, but that isn't one of them.\n\nPenn is a useful writer if used properly. He'll give you a three act script with a servicable plot and set pieces on a tight deadline. It will need polishing from there, but he's fast and reliable and that's sometimes a necessary thing. Marvel has already announced Captain America and The Avengers before they even have scripts or directors and they need to get moving forward on these projects if they even want to have a hope of meeting their proposed schedule.\n\nHe's something of the opposite of Joss Whedon who, when attached to WW, took several years, complained about how hard it was to get a handle on the character, and handed in something that sounded like it would set the fanboys on edge on many levels."
