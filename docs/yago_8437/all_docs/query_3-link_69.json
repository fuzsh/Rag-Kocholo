We didn’t know where the journey would lead us, but by the time we landed on the final frame we knew we had experienced something truly mesmerizing. This film tells the story of a family that is broken, but refuses to give up on each other. A film like this can easily slip through the cracks and for that reason we have chosen to shed light on this beautiful piece of cinema and we hope it finds the audience it so well deserves. The U.S. Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic goes to In The Summers.\n\nThe U.S. Grand Jury Prize: Documentary was presented to Porcelain War / U.S.A., Ukraine (Director and Screenwriter: Brendan Bellomo, Director: Slava Leontyev, Producers and Screenwriters: Aniela Sidorska, Paula DuPré Pesmen, Producers: Camilla Mazzaferro, Olivia Ahnemann) — Under roaring fighter jets and missile strikes, Ukrainian artists Slava, Anya, and Andrey choose to stay behind and fight, contending with the soldiers they have become. Defiantly finding beauty amid destruction, they show that although it’s easy to make people afraid, it’s hard to destroy their passion for living. World Premiere. Available online for Public.\n\nJury citation: Resisting totalitarian aggression is necessary but holding on to your humanity amidst the onslaught is the ultimate pursuit of good. The making of this film – a film full of pathos and violence, porcini and dragonlets – is in and of itself this pursuit. For its unwavering voice from inside the brutal war in Ukraine calling us to care about those who would sacrifice their lives to defend their humanity and ours, and since at present there is no Sundance Jury Award for best dog, the U.S. Grand Jury Prize: Documentary goes to Porcelain War.\n\nThe World Cinema Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic was presented to Sujo / Mexico, U.S.A., France (Directors, Screenwriters, and Producers: Astrid Rondero, Fernanda Valadez, Producers: Diana Arcega, Jewerl Keats Ross, Virginie Devesa, Jean-Baptiste Bailly-Maitre) — When a cartel gunman is killed, he leaves behind Sujo, his beloved 4-year-old son.

Available online for Public.\n\nJury citation: A breathtaking film that created its own unique cinematic vocabulary – of a childhood born around violence yet protected by the embrace of women, strangers and family alike. The story came alive with extraordinary cinematography that captured a lyrical intensity of darkness, nature and aspiration. The filmmakers brought us a story as yet unseen, with an originality and power that is deeply affecting and transcendent. The winner of the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic goes to Sujo.\n\nThe World Cinema Grand Jury Prize: Documentary was presented to A New Kind of Wilderness / Norway (Director: Silje Evensmo Jacobsen, Producer: Mari Bakke Riise) — In a forest in Norway, a family lives an isolated lifestyle in an attempt to be wild and free, but a tragic event changes everything, and they are forced to adjust to modern society. World Premiere. Available online for Public.\n\nJury citation: Our jury was immersed in this story from start to finish. The film is embedded with deep humanism and a sensitivity and vulnerability that never veers into sentimentalism. Skillfully edited, beautifully filmed and scored with intimate access inside a very special family. It’s rare to see classically verite films of this caliber. The World Cinema Grand Jury Prize: Documentary goes to A New Kind of Wilderness.\n\nNEXT INNOVATOR AWARD PRESENTED BY ADOBE\n\nThe NEXT Innovator Award presented by Adobe was presented to Little Death / U.S.A.

Led by a filmmaker skilled in construction and tailoring, we travel a path that bends, bucks and veers. I applaud these risks, the strong performances, the desire to wrestle with one’s own blind spots and the desire to eat your cake and then also have it. And why not. And why not at Sundance. The NEXT Innovator award goes to Little Death and its bold filmmaker.\n\nFESTIVAL FAVORITE AWARD\n\nSelected by audience votes from the feature films that screened at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, the Festival Favorite Award was presented to Daughters / U.S.A.
