        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Mubi has snapped up multiple key territories for Portuguese filmmaker Miguel Gomes’ Grand Tour, following the film’s world premiere in Competition at Cannes where it won the Best Director prize.\n\nThe global distributor, streaming service and production company has acquired North America, UK, Ireland, Latin America, Germany, Austria, Turkey and India. The company will unveil release plans in the coming months.\n\nOpening in Rangoon, Burma in 1918, the film follows British civil servant Edward Abbot (Gonçalo Waddington) who flees fiancée Molly Singleton (Crista Alfaiate) the day she arrives for their wedding. Determined to get married and amused by his move, Molly tracks him across Asia.\n\nGrand Tour was Gomes’ first feature to world premiere in Competition at Cannes, after debuting previous critically-acclaimed films Arabian Nights in Cannes Directors’ Fortnight in 2015 and Tabu, which played in competition at the Berlinale in 2012, winning the Silver Bear.\n\nGomes co-wrote the screenplay with Mariana Ricardo, Telmo Churro, and Maureen Fazendeiro. Produced by Filipa Reis, the film was shot in China, the Philippines, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam with three cinematographers, Guo Liang, Rui Poças, and Sayombhu Mukdeeprom.\n\nUma Pedra no Sapato produced the film with Vivo film, Shellac and Cinéma Defacto acting as co-producers and The Match Factory, Rediance and Creatps as associate producers."
