        "text": "\"I've been running away from her like a coward.\" The Match Factory has revealed a first look trailer for a Portuguese film set in Asia premiering at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival next month. This new film is called Grand Tour, and it's the latest feature by Portuguese director Miguel Gomes, best known for his films Tabu (2012), The Tsugua Diaries (2021), and his Arabian Nights trilogy (2015). Grand Tour was already announced as part of the prestigious Competition at Cannes 2024 this year, which is a big deal for a film like this. Edward, civil servant, flees fiancee Molly on their wedding day in Rangoon, Burma, in 1917. His travels replace panic with melancholy. Molly, set on marriage and amused by his escape, trails him across Asia. The film stars Gon√ßalo Waddington & Crista Alfaiate. Variety says it features a mix of \"narrative sequences shot in a studio [which are] intercut with footage of contemporary Asia.\" It is a tragicomedy though it is also \"melancholic and courageous.\" This is a rather wacky trailer, starting out with somber B&W footage then cutting into cheesy flashes of dancing, puppets, & more. Definitely looks like an acquired taste kind of film.\n\nHere's the festival promo trailer for Miguel Gomes' film Grand Tour, direct from YouTube (via TFS):"
