        "text": "I'm Zach Snyder.\n\nLet's answer some questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Filmmaking Support.\n\n[gentle upbeat music]\n\n@ImBaby wants to know\n\nwhy did Rebel Moon's action sequence\n\nhave so much slow motion?\n\nThe obvious answer is slow motion is awesome.\n\nThese movies are physical.\n\nThere's a physicality to what our heroes go through.\n\nThe use of slow motion to me\n\nis a way of just embellishing heroic moments\n\nthat our heroes go through.\n\nBecause I think I'm a fan of beautiful classic artwork\n\nor paintings,\n\nI like to kind of make the moments\n\ninto those iconographic frames that you can hang on and see.\n\nOtherwise, you just go right by\n\nand you'd never have a chance to appreciate\n\nthe like composition,\n\nthe sort of tension that's created by the characters\n\nand how they're pushing the frame\n\nin all the different directions.\n\nSlow motion tableau where you're moving with a character.\n\nI'm not a fan of like action that is hidden by the camera.\n\nThe camera becomes a third character in the fight\n\nwhen it's like looking for the action.\n\nIn the end, even in a sequence with a lot of editing,\n\nI tend to like to see the action unfold.\n\nConankun66 wants to know,\n\nDirector's cut? What does that mean?\n\nWhat happens is in the focus groups\n\nand in the studio screenings,\n\npeople get ideas about the movie.\n\nAnd they're like,\n\nYou know, it's too long. You've got too many shots of this.\n\nYou need to cut that out.\n\nAnd what happens is inevitably for me,\n\nthe movie will get changed based on studio opinion\n\nand things like that,\n\nand I'll be like,\n\nOkay, that's great.\n\nThis is the movie we're releasing in theaters.\n\nThere used to be a thing called DVDs\n\nand I would go over to that department\n\nand I would say,\n\nHey, would you guys be interested\n\nin an extended or director's cut of this film?\n\nYou can sell it alongside the normal version\n\nand people will maybe buy additional DVDs\n\nbased on the fact that this is never before seen.\n\nAnd inevitably DVD would be like,\n\nThat's awesome.\n\nWe can give you some money to make it as cool as you want.\n\nThe Snyder cut of Justice League\n\nis the most on steroids version of that process.\n\nThe studio finally did ask me\n\nafter pressure from the fandom\n\nto finish my version of Justice League.\n\nOne of the things that we restored\n\nwas the original aspect ratio, which was 143.\n\nIf you've seen the other version of Justice League\n\nthat I have never seen,\n\nI think it's in 185,\n\nbut for me the movie was always supposed to be 143,\n\nand I think there was gonna be a compromise\n\nif there was a theatrical wide release\n\nof my version of Justice League.\n\nI did consider 166 as possible other ratio.\n\n@GoBerserkNow wants to know,\n\nWhy did you choose 4:3 format\n\nfor your 'Justice League' cut?\n\nJustice League was originally framed to be 4:3\n\nbecause it was meant for an IMAX release.\n\nNow if you've ever been to an IMAX theater,\n\nthose screens are square.\n\nJustice League originally was composed and shot\n\nfor a square presentation\n\nbecause it was meant to be shown in IMAX.\n\nAnd so that's why when someone says, Why is it 4:3?\n\nIt is 4:3 because it was meant to be in an IMAX theater.\n\n@JoelGetty would like to know\n\nhow much of a fight scene is really up to the writer\n\nand how much is up to the director and fight choreographer?\n\nMy experience is that I like to talk with them\n\nabout what I wanna see, what I want the actress to do,\n\nwhat I want the character to achieve.\n\nI always like to break the fights\n\ninto like little mini three-act movies.\n\nIn the first act of the fight,\n\nthe main character has a lot of confidence\n\nand they're like fighting with a lot of power.\n\nIn the second act, they might make a mistake or get rocked\n\nand they lose confidence and they're now on their back foot.\n\nAnd then the third act,\n\nthey turn it around and they actually are victorious.\n\nThe way I use storyboards and action sequences,\n\nhere's the things I need to see,\n\nwanna really see Kora throw the hatchet\n\nand hit the guy in the forehead with it.\n\nAnd when she's on the guy's body, she blows his brains out\n\nbut she's holding the back of his head, boom,\n\nand he falls and then she's gonna roll and like get the gun.\n\nThose are the two beats I wanna see.\n\nAnd then they'll start linking stuff together\n\nand be like, Okay, we think if she throws the hatchet,\n\nshe's gotta fight her way back\n\nand then get the hatchet out of his head\n\nand then use it later.\n\nThat's how the collaboration works\n\nand then suddenly we have a whole fight.\n\nSo ToksTalks wants to know,\n\nWhat do you find is the best way to pitch an idea?\n\nI like to kind of set it up a little bit\n\nso that it's not a cold pitch.\n\nThis Army of the Dead idea I have,\n\nit's like a zombie heist movie,\n\nbut let me tell you more about it when I see you.\n\nAnd then how much do you have to have worked out?\n\nI think you have to have the whole thing\n\npretty much 100% worked out.\n\nI don't recommend going in without the idea figured up.\n\nI always say this,\n\nThere's one tool that you have\n\nthat everybody has and that really is your point of view.\n\nWhat I want from you is the way you see the world\n\ntranslated into a movie.\n\nSo the way you visualize a scene\n\nis the unique thing that you have that no one but you has.\n\nYou should do it from your personal perspective.\n\nTell me about the way you see and that will engage me\n\nand it will intrigue me,\n\nand I'll see something unique in your vision\n\nand then I'll write you a check for whatever,\n\na hundred million dollars.\n\n@PodcastMovement wants to know,\n\nWhat role does feedback from your audience play\n\nin shaping your creative decisions?\n\nThere's three sort of ways we do it.\n\nA trusted group\n\nwhere I would bring in like a bunch of my friends\n\nwho I like their opinion and I trust their taste,\n\nand I ask 'em a series of questions\n\nafter they watch the movie.\n\nNext is a friends and family screening.\n\nAnd so you could have 200 people at that\n\nand you show 'em the movie.\n\nI find friends and family are the hardest audience.\n\nYou'd think that friends and family would be like,\n\nOh, they're gonna be nice to the movie and say nice stuff.\n\nThey don't.\n\nThen we do a general preview\n\nwhere we go out into the theaters\n\nand we show the movie to just a general audience.\n\nYou know, you're walking by the theater\n\nand someone has a clipboard and goes,\n\nHey, do you wanna come see this movie?\n\nAnd you go and watch it and you give 'em feedback.\n\nMostly feedback from the audience\n\nis related to confusion about the story.\n\nWas it clear that that character\n\nwas the character they were referring to?\n\nOr when they went from this location to that location,\n\nwere you lost?\n\nThose are the three methods that we normally use.\n\nThe sort of online feedback, I don't really look at that.\n\nIf you actually start to look at the internet\n\nfor opinion about your work,\n\nyou can really go down the rabbit hole\n\nand that's a dark place.\n\n@ConcordLibrary wants to know,\n\nHow do you build fictional worlds?\n\nI always like to start with myth.\n\nYour words, your drawings,\n\nyour reference, your own personal taste.\n\nYou sort of set an aesthetic for the world\n\nand in setting aesthetic for the world,\n\nI'm inspired by those conversations to draw and paint.\n\nThose are the ways I start.\n\nIn Rebel Moon, we travel throughout the galaxy\n\nand we go to all these different places.\n\nNow in the script, this place is like a mining colony.\n\nWe go to a place that's like a floating dock.\n\nSo once you have these kind of,\n\nwhat I would say,\n\nthese are images that I like,\n\nthese are drawings that I've done,\n\nwe could give them to a concept painter\n\nand that painter will do a full blown painting\n\nand then I can look at it and go like,\n\nThat's exactly what I want it to look like.\n\nThose paintings,\n\nthey really end up being the sort of touchstones\n\nof each one of the looks for the environments you go to.\n\n@ZoomarPodcast wants to know,\n\nHow on earth do films get funded?\n\nWell, movies are like any business.\n\nWhoever's got the sort of resources to make a movie,\n\nand that is to say they've got a chunk of money set aside,\n\nwhen are they gonna use this money\n\nand they're gonna give it to a filmmaker to make a movie.\n\nThey say, Okay, we really wanted make a horror movie,\n\nyou know?\n\nSo they'll say, Okay,\n\ndo you have any ideas for a horror movie?\n\nBecause we, on our slate, would love a couple horror movies.\n\nAnd so you pitch them and they go,\n\nYeah, it was pretty good.\n\nI think we should at least spend some money\n\nto write a script.\n\nAnd so they pull a small amount of the money off\n\nand they go, Okay, go write your script.\n\nSo you go and you write your script and they'd come back\n\nand they read it and they go like, either, That's awesome,\n\nyou did exactly what you said, we love it.\n\nHere's more money. Go make it into a movie.\n\nOr they'll say,\n\nYou know what? Here's some notes.\n\nIt's not quite what we thought.\n\nHere's a little bit more money, can you fix it up?\n\nThe other way it happens is they go,\n\nthey have this pile of money and they have some ideas.\n\nWe bought this newspaper article\n\nand they're like,\n\nHey, writer, would you write us a script\n\nbased on this article?\n\nWhat do we do with it?\n\nLet's call some directors that we know.\n\nThey read it, they come in and say,\n\nOh, this is how I wanna make that into a movie.\n\nI see it as like black and white, low angles.\n\nYou know what? We love that.\n\nHere's money, go and make that.\n\nAnd then they would go and make it.\n\nThere's also independent films, you know,\n\nwhere like the financing is not raised from a single source.\n\nThat's mostly based on the script and a filmmaker together.\n\nSo you go to different film festivals,\n\ndifferent marketplaces,\n\nand you say like,\n\nI have an idea for a movie,\n\nRobert Downey Jr. wants to be in it\n\nand I think it could be amazing.\n\nBased on that pitch, we can give you like $5 million.\n\nI'm like, Okay, great. I'm gonna put that in my bucket.\n\nNow I go pitch it again in another room\n\nand they might have another five\n\nor European distribution or whatever.\n\nYou can also raise enough money to shoot it that way\n\nand you'd have a bunch of partners.\n\n@Capybanna wants to know,\n\nFor movies, how do directors decide\n\nwhich scenes to do in which order?\n\nThis is my basic philosophy for what order to shoot\n\nthe movie in.\n\nPage one, shot one.\n\nShoot the movie in order as best as you can.\n\nAnd so then the characters are growing or progressing\n\nalong that same timeline as the film itself.\n\nIf you're doing a super complicated fight scene,\n\nsometimes it's good to do it right off the top.\n\nWhat happens with action inevitably is takes a long time.\n\nIt requires a lot of training, choreography.\n\nThe way that happens is they spend time in the gym\n\nwith the fight team learning it.\n\nSo that requires in prep the actors\n\nbecause they're not shooting,\n\nthey have time to learn a really complicated fight.\n\nAnd when they come on the day now\n\nthey're super ready and they can do it incredibly well.\n\n@RizzolDraymon asks,\n\n@ZackSnyder, how did you get your start as a director?\n\nDid you have to do an audition or something to start off?\n\nI'm just asking 'cause I want to be a director\n\nin the future.\n\nWell, I went to a film school to be a movie director,\n\nbut about three quarters of the way\n\nthrough my college career,\n\nI was talking to the head of the department and he said,\n\nLook, to guarantee yourself a job when you get out,\n\nif you'd made a bunch of TV commercials\n\nwhile you're here in school,\n\nyou would have a reel\n\nand you could go get a job immediately.\n\nAnd when I got out of school, I went straight to work.\n\n10 years of TV commercials.\n\nA lot of the Clydesdale Budweiser commercials,\n\nfor BMW, for Subaru.\n\nI've done commercials for Bose speakers,\n\nI've done commercials for pretty much anything\n\nyou could think of.\n\nSo the way you get a TV commercial\n\nis they have a idea for a commercial storyboard\n\nand they're like,\n\nYou know what, Zach Snyder and this storyboard\n\nfeel like a good match.\n\nLet's send it to him. Get him on the phone.\n\nThey get on the phone and I go,\n\nThis is what I would do\n\nif I was directing your TV commercial.\n\nIt would be all these like super cool angles,\n\nlots of slow motion,\n\nall this cool cinematography.\n\nYour product would look amazing\n\nand people are gonna buy it.\n\nAnd so when I went to Universal Studios\n\nto audition to do the movie Dawn of the Dead,\n\nI did have a vast knowledge of filmmaking,\n\nbut I still had to do a song and dance\n\nand tell 'em how the movie would look\n\nand what would be in it\n\nand they seemed to like it.\n\n@SummitPurohit wants to know\n\nhow do filmmakers prepare themselves for the shoots?\n\nAre there people beyond the crew\n\nyou discuss the project with,\n\nyou go into isolation?\n\nDo you focus on fitness before the shoot?\n\nI'm a writer, so I'm normally writing and drawing.\n\nI have drawn the storyboards\n\nfor all the movies that I work on.\n\nAnd so I end up drawing probably about five months\n\nbefore I start shooting for Rebel Moon,\n\nthe movie I just finished.\n\nI created about 3,000 drawings.\n\nAnd as far as fitness goes,\n\nwe do really work on our fitness before the movie starts.\n\nIt does come in handy,\n\nespecially like me, I operate the camera\n\nand I was the director of photography,\n\nso I'm running around all the time.\n\nShooting a movie is a marathon\n\nand you need to be in the best shape you can\n\nbecause it's gonna wear you down.\n\n@Flwersforyou wants to know,\n\nare film directors in charge of scripts\n\nlike planning the whole movie out?\n\nOr do film directors get hired\n\nafter the movie's already completely written\n\nand planned out?\n\nThere are times, like Man of Steel, where I got a script.\n\nBeyond the words there was nothing planned.\n\nSo of course I've written half of the movies\n\nthat I've directed.\n\nWas very involved in all aspects of production,\n\nwhether it be costume design or set design, cinematography.\n\nMy last two movies, I also acted as the cinematographer.\n\nSo not only was I the director,\n\ntelling the actors what to say based on words I had written,\n\nbut I was also making shots based on drawings\n\nthat I had done.\n\n@Jon_Sandler wants to know,\n\nis meddling studio executives are always painted as villains\n\nin film books,\n\nbut I wonder how many films set executives\n\nhave to actually improved.\n\nI don't know. I've had great studio executives\n\nwho have given me amazing feedback.\n\nI just wish this.\n\nI don't know how to do it.\n\nYou're the filmmaker, maybe you have an idea.\n\nSo an answer to your question, I think probably a few.\n\nAlright, so those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching."
