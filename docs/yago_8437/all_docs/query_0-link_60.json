        "text": "Free Guy is a 2021 American science fiction action comedy film directed by Shawn Levy from a screenplay by Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn, and a story by Lieberman. The film stars Ryan Reynolds as a bank teller, named Guy, who discovers that he is actually a non-player character in an open-world video game and becomes the hero of the story, trying to save his friends from deletion by the game's creator. Jodie Comer, Joe Keery, Lil Rel Howery, Utkarsh Ambadkar, and Taika Waititi also star in the film.\n\nThe film premiered at the Piazza Grande section of the 74th Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland on August 10, 2021. Following a year-long delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Free Guy was released theatrically in the United States on August 13, 2021, in RealD 3D, IMAX and Dolby Cinema formats by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through 20th Century Studios. The film has grossed $328 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the clever concept and compared it favorably to a combination of action video games and science fiction films such as Ready Player One, The Truman Show, The Matrix, Grand Theft Auto, and Fortnite.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nPlot[]\n\nA bank teller discovers he's actually an NPC inside a brutal, open world video game.\n\nGenres[]\n\nAction\n\nAdventure\n\nSci-Fi\n\nComedy\n\nMotion Picture Rating[]\n\n13 (Argentina)\n\nM (Australia)\n\n12 (Brazil)\n\nPG (Canada)\n\nTE+7 (Chile)\n\n12 (Colombia)\n\n11 (Denmark)\n\nK-12 (Finland)\n\nTous publics (France)\n\n12 (Germany)\n\n12 (Hungary)\n\nUA (India)\n\n13+ (Indonesia)\n\n12A (Ireland) (theatrical rating)\n\n12 (Ireland) (video rating)\n\nT (Italy)\n\nG (Japan)\n\nA (Mexico)\n\n12 (Netherlands)\n\nM (New Zealand)\n\n12 (Norway)\n\n12 (Poland)\n\nM/12 (Portugal)\n\n12+ (Russia)\n\nPG13 (Singapore)\n\n12 (South Korea)\n\n12 (Spain)\n\n11 (Sweden)\n\n12 (Switzerland)\n\n13A (Turkey)\n\n12A (UK) (theatrical rating)\n\n12 (UK) (video rating)\n\nPG-13 (USA)\n\nPG-15 (United Arab Emirates)\n\nImages[]\n\nCast and Crew[]\n\nDirector[]\n\nShawn Levy\n\nWriting Credits[]\n\nMatt Lieberman (screenplay by) and\n\nZak Penn (screenplay by)\n\nMatt Lieberman (story by)\n\nCast[]\n\nRyan Reynolds - Guy\n\nJodie Comer - Millie / Molotovgirl\n\nLil Rel Howery - Buddy\n\nJoe Keery - Keys\n\nUtkarsh Ambudkar - Mouser\n\nTaika Waititi - Antwan\n\nAaron W.

After it was completed, the screenplay was sold and put into development at 20th Century Fox prior to its acquisition by Disney, and is one of the first Fox films to continue production under Disney ownership, as well as under the studio's new name of 20th Century Studios. Director Shawn Levy originally read the script in 2016 but passed on it. Several years later, Levy was introduced to Ryan Reynolds by Hugh Jackman, a mutual friend, and the pair decided to work on Free Guy after rereading the script together. Reynolds, who also produced the film, said, \"I haven't been this fully immersed and engaged in something since Deadpool.\"\n\nFilming[]\n\nThe film started principal photography in Boston in May 2019, mostly around the city's Financial District. Filming also took place in the Massachusetts cities of Worcester, Framingham (in the former Framingham Savings Bank building), and Weymouth (at the former Naval Air Station), as well as at Revere Beach.\n\nDesign and cultural references[]\n\nWhile the game world was found to compare to those of Grand Theft Auto and Fortnite, production designer Ethan Tobman said that the design of the world drew more inspiration from games like SimCity, The Sims and Red Dead Redemption 2. Throughout the film, several weapons pulled from other video game and film franchises are used, including a Mega Buster, a lightsaber from the Star Wars series, one of Fortnite's pickaxes, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2, the portal gun from Portal, Captain America's shield, and Hulk's fist. After the film was acquired by Disney, which owns the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, the filmmakers asked for permission to use such iconic weapons such as a lightsaber and Captain America's shield and were granted permission to use all of the things that they wanted.\n\nMusic[]\n\nThe film's score was composed by Christophe Beck. Levy had originally intended to use the song \"Your Love\" by The Outfield, but Reynolds suggested using \"Fantasy\" by Mariah Carey instead. Reynolds talked to Carey about getting permission to use it and she allowed them to use the song throughout the film. A cover version of \"Fantasy\" sung by Jodie Comer was also used in the film. The Avengers theme and Star Wars theme, respectively by Alan Silvestri and John Williams, appear in the film.\n\nMarketing[]\n\nIn July 2021, Reynolds released a video on YouTube titled Deadpool and Korg React, in which he reprised his role as Wade Wilson/Deadpool from the X-Men film series and Waititi reprised his role as Korg from the Marvel Cinematic Universe reacting to the trailer for Free Guy.\n\nOn August 12, 2021, the Dude character became an outfit in the video game Fortnite alongside a series of quests placed into the game to allow players to unlock an emote with Reynolds's voice.\n\nFree Guy's marketing team created parody posters in the style of other video games, including Super Mario 64, Minecraft, Among Us, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Mega Man, Street Fighter II, Doom, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nRelease[]\n\nFree Guy was released in the United States on August 13, 2021 in RealD 3D, IMAX, and Dolby Cinema formats. It was the first film from Walt Disney Studios during the pandemic released exclusively in theaters for 45 days before releasing on streaming services such as Disney+ (including Premier Access) or Hulu/Disney+ Star.\n\nThe film was initially scheduled to be released on July 3, 2020, but was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was then moved to December 11, 2020. In November 2020, the studio removed the film, along with Death on the Nile, from its upcoming release schedule until further notice. The next month, the film was rescheduled to May 21, 2021. In March, Ryan Reynolds announced that the film was delayed to its August date.\n\nThe film premiered at the Piazza Grande section of the 74th Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland in August 2021.\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office[]\n\nAs of October 18, 2021, Free Guy has grossed $328,625,708 worldwide on a budget of around $100-125 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Free Guy was released alongside Respect and Don't Breathe 2, and was initially projected to gross $15-18 million from 4,165 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making $10.5 million on its first day (including $2.2 million from Thursday night previews), estimates were raised to $26 million. It went on to debut to $28.4 million, topping the box office. The film made $18.5 million in its second weekend, remaining in first. The drop of just 34% marked the smallest second-weekend decline of any wide release of the summer, and the second-best of Reynolds' career. Although it was dethroned by newcomer Candyman, the film continued to hold well in its third weekend, falling just 27% to $13.6 million.\n\nCritical response[]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 273 reviews, with an average rating of 7.00/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Combining a clever concept, sweet, self-aware humor, and a charming cast, Free Guy is frivolous fun.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The film also has a 7.3/10 rating on IMDb. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWriting for Variety, Peter Debruge called the film an \"at-times unwieldy mashup of multiple-reality blockbusters like The Matrix and The Lego Movie\" and said that \"Free Guy is a lot of fun, despite the fact that Levy and the screenwriters seem to be changing the rules as they go.\" A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+ grade and said, \"For all its casual mayhem, Free Guy turns out to be a rather cuddly crowdpleaser, a high-concept blockbuster trifle with bubblegum ice cream clogging its circuits.\" Dowd contrasted the film with The Truman Show, saying \"Reynolds replicates that slightly unhinged Truman Burbank grin but not the desperation behind it.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times lauded both the \"perfectly cast\" Reynolds and \"superb and charming Jodie Comer.\" Giving the film three out of four stars, he wrote \"Thanks in large part to the vibrant, funny, sweet, endearing work by Reynolds and Comer, Free Guy delivers.\"\n\nCompany Credits[]\n\nProduction Companies[]\n\n20th Century Studios (presents)\n\n21 Laps Entertainment\n\nMaximum Effort\n\nBerlanti Productions\n\nTSG Entertainment\n\nLit Entertainment Group\n\nQuebec Film and Television Tax Credit\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\nDistributors[]\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (2021) (USA) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International (2021) (UK) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International (2021) (France) (theatrical)\n\nFeelgood Entertainment (2021) (Greece) (theatrical)\n\nForum Hungary (2021) (Hungary) (theatrical)\n\nKinomania (2021) (Ukraine) (theatrical)\n\nNOS Audiovisuais (2021) (Portugal) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Argentina (2021) (Argentina) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Finland (2021) (Finland) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Germany (2021) (Germany) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International (2021) (Australia) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International (2021) (Austria) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International (2021) (Italy) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International (2021) (Netherlands) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International (2021) (Singapore) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Mexico (2021) (Mexico) (theatrical)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (2021) (Brazil) (theatrical)\n\nBuena Vista Home Entertainment (2021) (UK) (DVD)\n\nBuena Vista Home Entertainment (2021) (UK) (Blu-Ray)\n\nBuena Vista Home Entertainment (2021) (UK) (4K UHD Blu-Ray)\n\nBuena Vista Home Entertainment (2021) (USA) (DVD)\n\nBuena Vista Home Entertainment (2021) (USA) (Blu-Ray)\n\nBuena Vista Home Entertainment (2021) (USA) (4K UHD Blu-Ray)\n\nSpecial Effects[]\n\nScanline VFX (visual effects)\n\nIndustrial Light and Magic (visual effects and animation)\n\nDigital Domain (visual effects and animation)\n\nLola Visual Effects (visual effects) (as Lola VFX)\n\nRaynault VFX (visual effects)\n\nCantina Creative (visual effects)\n\nHalon Entertainment (visual effects)\n\nBOT VFX (additional visual effects)\n\nCapital T (visual effects)\n\nDimension Imaging (DI4D) (facial performance capture)\n\nGentle Giant Studios (lidar and cyberscanning)\n\nMammal Studios (visual effects)\n\nProof (visualisation services)\n\nStereo D (3D conversion)\n\nTechnical Specs[]\n\nRuntime[]\n\n115 mins\n\nColor[]\n\nColor\n\nAspect Ratio[]\n\n2.35:1\n\n1.78:1 (Small Widescreen prints)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSerena Van der Woodsen from Gossip Girl (2007) makes a cameo as a player's avatar who gets points for brutality. The character was played by Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife.\n\nShortly after Guy does the sunglasses, over his shoulder you can see a power-up on the floor titled \"Blatant Product Placement\", which appears in the shape of a gin bottle. This is likely a reference to Aviation American Gin, which Ryan Reynolds (who plays Guy) had a stake in and maintains an ongoing ownership interest.\n\nJodie Comer admitted that the hardest part for her was to pretend to hate Taika Waititi, because they got along very well on the set.\n\nThe high-end sports cars, tanks, helicopters, motorcycles, etc., in the various strongholds are all real and had to be carefully protected from typical film crew wear and tear. At the end of filming, the helicopter flew away directly from the studio.\n\nThe screenplay for this film was included in the 2016 Black List of \"most liked\" scripts.\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson voiced a robber, and Tina Fey voiced Revenjamin's mother.\n\nThe fictional 'Free City' is based on Liberty City from Grand Theft Auto III (2001) and Grand Theft Auto IV (2008). In turn, Liberty City was inspired by the real-life New York.\n\nDespite Jodie Comer's character using an English accent for her in-game character, it is very different from her accent in real life, the accent she uses is from the general London area whereas in real life she has a distinctive Liverpudlian accent.\n\nThis is the second video game-themed film to be written by Zak Penn, after Ready Player One (2018).\n\nIn one of the scenes in Millie's apartment, there are blocks on her coffee table spelling out \"ANORAK\". Anorak is the name of James Halliday's avatar in the story Ready Player One, a video game-centered book written by Ernest Cline in 2011. The 2018 film version of Ready Player One was written by Zak Penn, who also worked as a writer for Free Guy. According to Wikipedia, \"anorak\" is a British slang word for a person who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects. It is used synonymously with words like \"geek\", \"nerd\" and \"IT professional\", of which there are many in Free Guy.\n\nWhile fighting enemies off in the gamer's stash house, Guy uses a Mega Buster, which is the primary weapon of Mega Man from the assorted video games in that series by Capcom. Mega Man is the main hero of the eponymous franchise, known for stealing the weapons of enemies he defeats, much like what Guy does in this film.\n\nMillie has an N7 sticker on her laptop, which is a reference to the Mass Effect video game series.\n\nThe interior of the Stash House, with its glowing stone walls, is based on the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft. The wall panels are thin enough to allow some natural light to pass through them, while preventing any direct light into the interior, which would damage the books.\n\nSome of the tanks seen in the streets of Free City are Scorpion tanks from the Halo video game franchise.\n\nShawn Levy's daughter Sophie Levy appears as an NPC, credited as Big City Dreamer.\n\nThe movie is set in a fictional, intra-video-game locale called Free City. Its teaser trailer opens with an establishing shot of what is visibly Pittsburgh, however, and its remainder appears to have been filmed in the Boston area. Local landmarks such as Faneuil Hall and the 75 State Street complex are clearly visible.\n\nThe name of Antwan's company is Soonami. This is likely a reference to the real-life worldwide video game company Konami, as well as Blizzard Entertainment, which created the MMORPG franchises World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Soonami's logo appears with a very similar styling to that of Blizzard's.\n\nThe scenes in the real world are shot with anamorphic lenses, while the scenes in the game are shot with standard spherical lenses. However, the entire film is presented in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.\n\nJodie Comer performs a cover of Mariah Carey's \"Fantasy\" during one of the final scenes. Carey's 1995 hit \"Fantasy\" is one of the main songs of the movie, accurately addressing the idea of living in a fantasy world. Some viewers will recognize the song's hook which was sampled from Tom Tom Club's \"Genius of Love\".\n\nDuring one of the bank robbery scenes, the bank robber in armor helms a 'biohazard' symbol on his arm and an 'RPD' symbol on his chest, a reference to the Resident Evil franchise, also known as \"Biohazard\" in Japan.\n\nRyan Reynolds personally talked to Mariah Carey for the rights to use her song \"Fantasy\" in the film.\n\nA Deadpool poster can be seen on the wall behind the gamer using the Channing Tatum avatar played by Matty Cardarople. This is not an accident, as Ryan Reynolds is known for playing Wade Wilson/Deadpool in a number of movies, shorts and assorted live-action appearances.\n\nInitially developed under the 20th Century Fox banner, the film was released by 20th Century Studios following Disney's purchase of the company in March 2019.\n\nAlthough the city in the film is CGI and otherwise unidentifiable, the opening shot of the film shows an aerial shot of Pittsburgh, PA as the city the unnamed \"hero\" is flying into.\n\nThe calendar on the wall by the TV set, while Guy is eating breakfast, has the number 4 missing.\n\nThe Free City logo seen in the movie mimics the logo of the real-life video game franchise Far Cry and the battle royale MMORPG game Free Fire.\n\nThe film has similarities to They Live (1988). In They Live, our world is not what it seems. It is controlled by beings from another world. You can only see the truth by wearing special sunglasses. At one point, the hero tries to make his friend wear the glasses to see the truth. In Free Guy, the world is virtual and run by people from the real world. You can only see the truth via sunglasses which the hero tries to make his friend wear.\n\nIn the gaming office, there is a figurine of Deadpool in the kitchen area. Ryan Reynolds (Guy) plays Wade Wilson/Deadpool in the Deadpool movies.\n\nShawn Levy originally read the script in 2016, and passed on it. He was persuaded to reconsider it by his friend, Ryan Reynolds.\n\nTaika Waititi is wearing the insignia of a Navy Electronics Warfare Technician 3rd Class, and the UIM says USS Damato. Damato (DD-871) was a Gearing Class destroyer, and served from 1945 to 1980.\n\nSome of the game elements from this film have similarities with the Grand Theft Auto franchise and Fortnite (2017).\n\nThis is director Shawn Levy's first movie to be filmed in Panavision (anamorphic).\n\nIn the final scene, one of the cars parked by the curb is the Infiniti Q Inspiration Concept and another one is the Infiniti Prototype 10 concept car.\n\nFour lines into her audition, Shawn Levy knew that Jodie Comer was the perfect choice for Millie/Molotov Girl.\n\nBoth Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer admitted in interviews that they are not gamers.\n\nThis is Ryan Reynolds' third film where he plays a character named \"Guy\", after The Croods (2013) and its sequel The Croods: A New Age (2020). He also plays the boyfriend of a character named Guy in Ted (2012).\n\nThe \"Bombshell\" character, in response to Blue Shirt Guy, says 'Maybe I don't have to be with any guy.', then she writes a 'blistering indictment of gender roles and the patriarchy'. In subsequent scenes, she is often with the \"Barista\" and hugs her twice, then in the final look at Guy's NPC friends, the Bombshell and Barista are embraced. Apparently, the Bombshell did indeed give up men to be with a woman.\n\nMatt Lieberman wrote the first draft of his spec script in just three weeks.\n\nIn the final scene of the movie, a three-wheel car can be seen in the background. The three-wheeled car is a Vanderhall Venice made by Vanderhall Motors.\n\nThe theme score \"Ice Cream\" is the exact same score used in the Disney animated short Paperman (2012).\n\nMouser yells to Guy, \"Get over here!\", a likely reference to Scorpion from the Mortal Kombat franchise.\n\nGuy's ATM pin number in the film appears to be \"1111\".\n\nThe pistol used by Molotov Girl is a Walther PPQ augmented with a golden slide, which is much more recognizable and aesthetic. The unique PPQ grip pattern can be seen when Molotov Girl first shows up and gets the disk from the masked player in the alley.\n\nThe term \"Free Guy\" was used in video games as the more commonly know-how of a \"1-Up\", an extra life your character can obtain to complete the game.\n\nMouser has a Public Enemy sticker on his laptop.\n\nThis is Lara Spencer's film debut.\n\nConnections[]\n\nReferences[]"
