        "text": "Disney's 'Gadget' a disappointment in several areas\n\nWhat: Inspector Gadget\n\nDirected by: David Kellogg\n\nWritten by: Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penn\n\nBased on: A story by Ehrin and Dana Olsen\n\nPhotography by: Adam Greenberg\n\nStarring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Cheri Oteri, Dabney Coleman\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 20 minutes\n\nRating: PG for comic violence, cigar smoking\n\nDistributed by: Walt Disney Pictures\n\nOpens:Today at area theaters\n\nBy Steven Rosen\n\nDenver Post Movie Critic\n\nJuly 23 - A gadget is a small mechanical or electronic device with a clever practical use.\n\nWith that in mind, \"Inspector Gadget'' should have a different title, one that more appropriately reflects the kind of inanimate object it most closely resembles.\n\nInspector Junk.\n\nThis is the worst (semi-)live-action Disney feature since 1997's \"That Darn Cat'' remake. It's a letdown in the storytelling, good humor, thrills and just-plain-fun departments.\n\nAnd it's barely even a full-length movie, needing to use outtakes during credits to pad its length to 80 minutes. But since by then it has fallen into hyperactive children's-actionfilm incoherence and worn out its welcome, that's just as well. It is, one should note, harmless and fastmoving entertainment for younger kids. And since it is based on a cartoon series, it's a presold property. But it's still a poor substitute for a book - or an accomplished movie.\n\nIf not for the money spent on the animatronic- and computer-generated effects plus two relatively high-profile stars, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett, this probably would be a Disney Channel television show. Security guard John Brown (Broderick), after almost dying in a car wreck while chasing the villainous Claw (Everett), gets rebuilt as a cartoonish (what else?) version of \"The Six Million Dollar Man'' called Inspector Gadget.\n\nBudget noticeable\n\nYou can see where this film's budget went. Small gadgets pop out of his hand or his hat, including a parasol, a toothbrush, a lighter, even blades that turn him into a human Gadgetcopter. His arms extend outward as if propelled by giant, coiled Slinky toys. His head can spin - as can his evil twin's, RoboGadget, also played by Broderick with garish false teeth. And he drives a retro powder-blue convertible with purple upholstery and eyeball headlights, as well as a mind and hipster-talking voice all its own. It's like the plant in the musical version of \"Little Shop of Horrors,'' only this one keeps plugging Disney.\n\nAt first, it appears this will be a goofy, loving - and clever - parody of \"Batman'' and James Bond in the way \"George of the Jungle'' sent up Tarzan. The droll Everett even, for a while, plays the onehanded Claw as a kind of mean yet debonair Pierce Brosnan. Some of his early lines are adultoriented, such as his use of the term \"post-modern'' and his stated desire to find a \"dashing appellation.'' (A cohort asks if that's a \"hillbilly with a tuxedo.'')\n\nLevel drops quickly\n\nBut the film can't operate on that level for very long before succumbing to junkiness. If only it had just explored Inspector Gadget's discovery of his weird body with a sense of delicacy and enchantment, like \"Edward Scissorhands.'' Instead, the gimmick is presented with the thudding, speeding gracelessness of a wayward bowling ball. The stunts are vacuous.\n\nFor all the money spent on effects, a nickel or so was invested in the screenplay. Broderick's romantic involvement with the lovely, auburn-haired Joely Fisher is corny, rote stuff. The action sequences, which appear to use an underpopulated Pittsburgh as a background that sometimes looks as fake as a computer screen-saver, are simultaneously half-hearted and cacophonous. And Everett's cackling becomes as annoying as Broderick's teeth.\n\nFirst-time director David Kellogg, who has done television commercials, doesn't capture movie rhythms well; but screenwriters Zak Penn and Kerry Ehrin haven't given up much. (It's based on a story by Ehrin and Dana Olsen.)\n\nIncidentally, if there's a sequel to this film - and one hopes there isn't - might it be called \"Inspector Gadget Goes Hawaiian?''"
