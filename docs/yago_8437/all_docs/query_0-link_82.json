In or out?\n\nIsn't there a time limit\n\non this? Come on.\n\nThe twist is that\n\nthe six of us,\n\nwe're playing\n\nfor $10 million,\n\nwinner takes all.\n\nSo no matter how much\n\nall of us believe\n\nthat we can make\n\nour own fate,\n\nthe truth is that\n\nonly one of us\n\nis going to win,\n\nluck and skill be damned.\n\nThat's why\n\nthis story is called\n\nLuck and Skill Be Damned.\n\nSorry. Wait a second.\n\nIt's not called that.\n\nIt-- It's called The Grand.\n\n[Woman]\n\nHi, I'm picking up\n\nJack Faro.\n\nI'm Renee Jensen.\n\nI called.\n\nRight. Um, I just need you\n\nto sign some paperwork,\n\njust releases acknowledging\n\nhis medical history\n\nand addictions.\n\nSo which ones are his?\n\nThose are all his.\n\nGod.\n\nJust sign at the bottom.\n\nHe's not going to piss blood\n\nin the limo, is he?\n\nProbably not.\n\nYeah, he's in and out\n\nso many times,\n\nit just made\n\nmore sense for him\n\nto, you know, move in\n\nand make this his home.\n\nUgh, that's disgusting.\n\nYou must be thrilled\n\nto be getting rid of him.\n\nNo, actually, I'm not.\n\nI-- I love Jack.\n\n[awkward laugh]\n\nUm, actually,\n\ncould you, uh--\n\ncould you just give me\n\na second to talk to Jack?\n\nUm, I'll just--\n\nI'll just take a minute.\n\nHow's my favorite\n\npatient doing?\n\nHello, Dr. Sellers.\n\nHow are you?\n\nI'm good.\n\nHey, before you talk,\n\nI just wanted to, um...\n\n[clears throat]\n\nplay a song\n\nI wrote for you.\n\nYou wrote a song for me?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, I'd-- I'd love it.\n\nSit here.\n\nYou wrote me a song.\n\nTwelve steps\n\nTwelve steps\n\nOnly got 11 more\n\nIt's a work in progress.\n\nIt's really beautiful.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nI always say\n\nit's progress,\n\nnot perfection.\n\nIf you can smoke it\n\nor drink it\n\nor inject it or snort it,\n\nI've done it.\n\n[snickers]\n\nWhoa!\n\nAnd that really affects\n\nthe mental faculties.\n\nWelcome to\n\nthe Rabbit's Foot Hotel,\n\nthe finest place to--\n\ncasino and the-- the fine--\n\nI've been married, uh...\n\napproximately 74 times.\n\nSeems like a lot,\n\nbut I loved every\n\none of them.\n\nI make it a point\n\nto know my employees,\n\njust like\n\nGrandpa Lucky did.\n\nI want to make a point\n\nto know this one for sure.\n\nUh, hey...Toni.\n\nHow-- How long you been\n\nworking here?\n\nNine years.\n\nAh.\n\nWe were married, Jack.\n\n[camera shutter clicks]\n\n[Renee]\n\nI'm still waiting outside.\n\nHi.

I actually wanted\n\nto talk to you--\n\nOkay.\n\n...for a second\n\nabout that.\n\nCould you give us\n\none second, please?\n\nJust one second.\n\nUm, what I--\n\nwhat I came in here\n\nto talk to you about\n\nwas in terms of your\n\nfeeling like you should\n\nstay or you should go,\n\nit's probably important\n\nthat you stay here.\n\n[whispering]\n\nJack, I don't\n\nlike to do this,\n\nbut, you know, I don't\n\nwant you-- don't go.\n\nWow.\n\nI have to go now.\n\nI've been here for two years.\n\nI know, but I think--\n\nI think you should stay\n\nfor a little--\n\na little while longer.\n\nI'm going to\n\ncall you, okay?\n\nOkay. We should\n\ntalk today, though.\n\nI'll call you later.\n\nYeah.\n\nOr I'll call you.\n\nWell, I mean, this whole\n\nRabbit's Foot thing,\n\nI gotta-- I gotta shoulder\n\nsome of the blame on this,\n\nmaybe a lot of the blame.\n\nOkay, now, what you're\n\nexperiencing here\n\nis the real deal.\n\nThis is the hub\n\nof the wheel,\n\nthe headquarters,\n\nthe main office...\n\nof the Rabbit's Foot,\n\npretty much unchanged\n\nfrom when Lucky was here.\n\nQuite frankly, at times\n\nI was my own worst enemy,\n\nand I didn't do\n\na good job running it.\n\nI wasn't a good steward.\n\nYes, I did get thrown\n\nout of my own casino.\n\nI'm not sure how\n\nexactly that happened,\n\nbut they do say\n\nthat I gave the order.\n\nSo when I was,\n\nshall we say,\n\ndown and out,\n\nI made an unfortunate deal\n\nwith Steve Lavisch.\n\nHe took advantage for 6\n\nor 7 million of a bridge loan.\n\nIf I don't pay it back,\n\nI lose the Rabbit's Foot.\n\nI don't know\n\nif I could bear that.\n\n[Man #1]\n\nWelcome back to the NAIPL\n\nTournament of Champions.\n\n[Man #2]\n\nBrought to you\n\nby PartyPoker.net.\n\nI'm Phil Gordon.\n\nAnd I'm Mike Werbe.\n\nAnd we're here\n\nat the final table\n\nwith heads-up action between\n\ntwo of poker's greatest minds.\n\n[Mike Werbe]\n\nHarold Melvin\n\nand Daniel Negreanu,\n\ntwo guys who did not ride\n\nthe short bus to school.\n\nI only called 2,000 more\n\nfor a pot of 22,000.\n\nI'm getting 11 to 1,\n\nso no matter what\n\nI have, I call.\n\nEven if I have deuce-seven\n\nand you have pocket aces,\n\nthat's still\n\nthe mathematically\n\ncorrect play.\n\nYou should have gone\n\nall in three hours ago\n\nwhen your stack\n\nstill meant something.\n\n[Mike]\n\nSome harsh comments\n\nfrom the chip leader.\n\n[chuckling]\n\nOkay. Here, beat that.\n\n[Phil Gordon]\n\nLet's take a peek\n\nat the river.\n\nTerrible catch\n\nfor Daniel Negreanu.\n\nHarold makes\n\nthe straight.\n\nI was a 2-to-1 underdog,\n\nand the pot paid me 11 to 1.\n\nNot a bad\n\nrisk-return ratio.\n\n[laughing awkwardly]\n\nYou play poorly.\n\n[blender whirring]\n\nHarold can't cook.\n\nAnd he's very particular\n\nabout what he eats, you know?\n\nPlease tell me\n\nthis is not gravy.\n\nOh, you know\n\nit's not gravy.\n\nIt's mushroom barley soup--\n\nyour favorite, honey.\n\nIt's so stupid\n\nthat you don't use\n\nmore efficient\n\ncooking utensils.\n\nI've lived with my mother\n\nsince I was born.\n\nI live with her\n\nbecause it is convenient\n\nand because it is\n\ndifficult for me\n\nto take care of myself.\n\nI'll probably\n\nbe stuck with her\n\nfor the rest of my life.\n\nOr the rest of her life\n\nbecause she's\n\nmuch older than me.\n\nShe will die first.\n\nRuth, if I were\n\na food critic,\n\nI would give your\n\ncooking five stars--\n\nfive stars that if each\n\ncollapsed into a black hole\n\nand merged to form\n\nthe largest black hole\n\nin the universe.\n\nIf I won this tournament,\n\nI would buy a real house\n\nwith secret rooms\n\nand shifting\n\nmirrored passageways\n\nand a garden labyrinth,\n\nall of which would serve\n\nto disorient Ruth\n\nand make it more difficult\n\nfor her to find me.\n\nThe kitchen is such a mess.\n\nI gotta clean it up later.\n\nWe used to have a maid.\n\nShe lasted two weeks.\n\nHarold couldn't\n\ntolerate her.\n\n[Harold]\n\nI have pet peeves.\n\nI hate stinks.\n\nI hate breath stink,\n\nI hate body stink,\n\nI hate pee stink,\n\nlike from when you take\n\na lot of supplements"
