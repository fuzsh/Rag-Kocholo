        "text": "2007 American film\n\nThe GrandDirected byZak PennWritten byZak Penn\n\nMatt BiermanProduced byJeff BowlerStarringCinematographyAnthony HardwickEdited byAbby SchwarzwalderMusic byStephen EndelmanDistributed byAnchor Bay Entertainment\n\nRelease dates\n\nCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$3 million[1]Box office$114,669 (USA)\n\nThe Grand is a 2007 improv comedy film directed by Zak Penn. The film has an ensemble cast including Ray Romano, Woody Harrelson, Chris Parnell, Werner Herzog, Jason Alexander, Dennis Farina, David Cross, Gabe Kaplan, Michael Karnow and Cheryl Hines along with several real Las Vegas poker stars.[1]\n\nAccording to Penn, the film is styled after those of Christopher Guest,[2] in which each actor is given direction concerning their character and the actors are left to improvise each individual scene. The plot of The Grand was somewhat more open-ended than Guest's work, however. The focus of the film is a poker tournament played at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas between the characters in which real poker matches were played by the actors as the scenes were filmed. The film's script did not specify the winner of the tournament, and the ending of the film was determined by the actual game played on set.[2]\n\nThe film debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival, and was distributed by Anchor Bay Entertainment.[1] The film opened in limited release in the United States on March 21, 2008, and opened in wider release on April 4, 2008.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJack Faro is a recovering drug addict who, after many relapses, decides to move into a rehabilitation facility full-time. Having been married 75 times, he is a serial husband and is always on the lookout for number 76. He enters The Grand, a Texas Hold 'Em poker tournament in Las Vegas created by his grandfather Lucky Faro. His main motivation is to win the $10 million prize to cover a loan he got to keep open his family's casino, The Rabbit's Foot, which his grandfather left him when he died and that he has mismanaged since.\n\nThe rest of the players \"won\" their seats in an online poker tournament. They include the Schwartzman twins, Larry and Lainie, who have been forced into a sibling rivalry throughout their lives by their father, Seth. Another player, Harold Melvin, is a genius who still lives with his mother. Other players include Andy Andrews, a math teacher; Deuce Fairbanks, a wily old veteran of Vegas' and \"The German\", a cheater who ritualistically sacrifices small animals to gain luck at cards.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody Harrelson – \"One Eyed\" Jack Faro (The Sentimental Favorite)\n\nCheryl Hines – Lainie Schwartzman (The Woman)\n\nDavid Cross – Larry Schwartzman (The Bad Boy)\n\nRichard Kind – Andy Andrews (The Unknown)\n\nChris Parnell – Harold Melvin (The Lonely Genius)\n\nDennis Farina – Deuce Fairbanks (The Old Timer)\n\nWerner Herzog – The German\n\nRay Romano – Fred Marsh\n\nBarry Corbin – Jiminy \"Lucky\" Faro\n\nMichael McKean – Steve Lavisch\n\nGabe Kaplan – Seth Schwartzman\n\nAndrea Savage – Renee Jensen\n\nEstelle Harris – Ruth Melvin\n\nJudy Greer – Sharon Andrews\n\nJason Alexander – Yakov Achmed\n\nBrett Ratner – \"Sob Story\" Barry Blausteen\n\nHank Azaria – Mike \"The Bike\" Neslo\n\nTom Hodges – Tim \"Tiny Wonder\" Woolrich\n\nShannon Elizabeth – Toni\n\nK.D.
