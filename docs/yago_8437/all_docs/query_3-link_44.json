        "text": "It’s easy to get sucked into the magical, perfectly symmetrical world of Wes Anderson. From the memorable, moving soundtracks to the perfectly whimsical costuming in his films, each detail and every shot is thoughtfully considered and deeply delightful. Whether it’s through the painstaking claymation of Fantastic Mr. Fox or the perfect bows of the pink Mendl’s Patisserie boxes in The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson’s filmmaking is always meticulous, always quirky, and always fun. And with a band of frequent-to-return seasoned actors (Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Frances McDormand, included), Anderson’s films rarely miss.\n\nNow, Asteroid City finally out in the world, and it's exactly as delightful as we hoped. (You can read Esquire's review here.) To mark the occasion, here’s an updated ranking of Anderson’s small but mighty filmography. Spoiler, people: there's a new number one.\n\nWhen we talk about why we enjoy Wes Anderson’s kooky films, we talk about the gorgeous color palettes, the thoughtful shots, the idiosyncratic characters, the perfect comedic timing, the chemistry between his crop of actors, the list goes on. His latest, The French Dispatch has all that. Which leads us to believe that all those reasons aren’t really why we like Anderson’s films after all. As it turns out, we like them for their delightful, gripping stories—the one thing that The French Dispatch is lacking. The magazine-style anthology format perhaps proves that Anderson can get just about any beloved actor to lend themself to even the smallest of roles, but does not a cohesive, engaging movie make.\n\nAmazon"
