        "text": "Where does Wes Anderson find the actors to play those original characters that populate his movies? We spoke to Douglas Aibel, a four-time Anderson collaborator and one of a team of casting directors assigned to THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, for the answer. Anderson's between-the-wars dramedy, set lavishly in what the Texas-born director calls \"Hollywood Europe,\" opens March 7. The Fox Searchlight release boasts a large cast replete with Anderson veterans and newcomers, including F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Léa Seydoux, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson and Owen Wilson. Aibel, who previously worked with Anderson on THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU and MOONRISE KINGDOM (for which he won a C.S.A. Award), is well known in New York theater circles as the Artistic Director of the Vineyard Theatre. He spoke to us from his \"Midtown East\" Manhattan apartment.\n\nHow did you first meet Wes Anderson?\n\nHe approached me to cast his film THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. We hit it off, and it was a lovely collaboration, and I've worked with him since on THE LIFE AQUATIC and MOONRISE KINGDOM and then worked on the U.S. casting of GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, so it's been a nice run. I honestly don't know what drew him to me, but we just clicked the moment we met.\n\nDo you always see eye to eye?\n\nOne of the things that I have loved about working with Wes is that he approaches the entire casting process, but especially the search process, with a spirit of adventure and openness. He is really open to anyone, and I'd say we've been in complete agreement every time.\n\nWhat was your main assignment on THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL?\n\nI did the United States casting – collaborated with Jina Jay, the London-based casting director. There was a casting person in Paris, and also one in Germany. The film shot in Germany and had a rather huge supporting cast, a lot of day players that were seen locally. One of the main jobs I had on the film was leading the search to cast the central role of Zero, who is the young lobby boy in the film. Wes actually approached me, even before I read the script, and just described in the broadest terms what he was looking for. We were told to search for a 16-year-old Middle Eastern boy with no experience. We didn't want a seasoned professional, just a very spirited and charming and intelligent and bright guy. I had an inkling, coming off of my experience on MOONRISE KINGDOM, that this would be a significant role in the film, and then when I read the script I realized that it was one of the leads.\n\nCan you describe the casting process for us?\n\nWhen you're casting the supporting roles, the actors go on tape with me. In the case of the casting of Zero, I auditioned a large gaggle of both professional and nonprofessional actors. We really made it a worldwide search process. We looked exhaustively across the United States, making contacts with Arab-American communities throughout the country – Dearborn, Michigan, for one, and Newark, New Jersey. We were reading kids [for the part] – when I say kids, I mean young people 15 to 21-year-olds – everywhere. We had sessions in Israel. We had sessions in Egypt. Obviously, it's not as easy to have auditions in every Middle Eastern country under the current circumstances, but we really tried to leave no stone unturned. Not that it was necessarily going to be an Arabic person, but that's where we began, and we were exploring actors of other ethnic backgrounds, as well.\n\nAnd the one you chose is from Guatemala?\n\nI think he is part Guatemalan. We saw him in California. He was only about 15 when he first auditioned. I had a pretty good sense of who Wes might connect with, and I remember Tony [Revolori] was, right off the bat, one of them. He was just marvelous. He actually flew out to Europe because Wes was in Paris at the time, and he read for him and met with him and got the part. And then we had to cast his adult self and cast F. Murray Abraham, which was a great gift.\n\nThis story is a period piece, set between the world wars. Do certain actors project another time and place?\n\nI think there are actors that have a particular kind of nuance and elegance who seem to fit well in period, although it never ceases to amaze me that an actor that I think might not be that kind of person connects with the right role and is dressed perfectly and finds the right spirit for it. But there are actors who seem to fit period work well – Kevin Kline, for instance. So many of the actors that work regularly with Wes – there's a core group of actors who obviously can be seen in a number of his films – they just seem to have that sense of je ne sais quoi, that certain sense of style and elegance and wit and understatement and specificity that serves the period so well.\n\nMany of them are also stage actors. Is that a contributing factor?\n\nYes, yes, indeed.\n\nAnderson's films are highly stylized. Do you look for naturalism in your actors?\n\nOh, absolutely. What you find among some of the really fine actors working regularly in Wes' films is that they're utterly real. In MOONRISE KINGDOM, I know the director was attracted to children who could be utterly natural and not so stagey or performer-y, if you know what I mean. Interestingly enough, those two children – I mean, they're grown now, but children when we cast them – neither one of them really had any experience. Kara Hayward came to an open call, but she had never really done any performing at all. So there was no whiff of that sort of stage kid thing. And I think they were both very pure souls, very open, very unaffected, just present and in the moment. And I think that's why they both caught fire in the project.\n\nWith such a large cast, are you looking for actors who make a very strong impression in a short amount of time?\n\nI think when you see the film your question will be answered because there are so many distinctive actors appearing in small doses, but they are indelible. I think of Tilda Swinton in the show. You'll never forget her. She makes every second count. The film is really about the relationship between the Ralph Fiennes character and Zero (Tony). There is a tender and surprising and interesting and subtle relationship that's at the heart of the piece with all these characters swirling around them. That was why it was so key to find absolutely the right person because he's the eye of the hurricane. The world of the film is seen through his eyes. That was the great challenge of finding someone completely unknown who could go toe to toe with all of these actors and, without any screen experience, still carry the project in part, and be the lens through which we're observing this wonderful world… I'm always struck in a callback situation by the way Wes interacts with young actors. He treats them as if they were adults. He's gentle, he's respectful, he's kind. He's really interested in whatever they have to say, what energy and what qualities they bring into the room. There's a lovely synergy there, and it shows when the films come out. If you look carefully, you'll also see several of the kids from MOONRISE KINGDOM in cameo roles here and there in the new film.\n\nAre there any newcomers in this film?\n\nTony is the main one. Obviously, he's the co-star and he's completely unknown. But it's a really vibrant and charming cast. There are a lot of French and German character actors in small roles, and then a lot of familiar faces used in an unfamiliar way. That's one of the things Wes is so brilliant at in the casting process: the way in which he shakes it up. You'll see people you've seen in other Wes Anderson movies before like Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, but they're used innovatively; their roles are nothing like the last role they've done for him. I like to think you'll view their presence as quite refreshing.\n\nHow did you get started in casting?\n\nI have two careers – one as an artistic director in the theater community. I run the Vineyard Theatre. I began in the theater as a director and producer, working with writers, but I always had a knack, in that process, for casting. In my very early days, I was friendly with and worked on a couple of projects with John [Patrick] Shanley [DOUBT, MOONSTRUCK]. The very first show I worked on at my theater was a play by John. I believe his first screenplay that sold was called FIVE CORNERS. Through him, I met the director of that film, Tony Bill, and he offered a job to me to cast the film. Casting became something that I was doing on the sidelines, and then gradually became a rather fulltime moonlighting job until today when I juggle both jobs and, in a way, both worlds.\n\nIs casting a movie different than casting a play?\n\nI think it is very different. I think film is more collaborative. It's somewhat more of a director's medium. One of the things I love about film casting is the intimacy of the process. By that I mean, when I cast a film, especially the early stages, I'll just bring an actor I like into a room and I'll tape them while I meet with them. It's just the two of us with a camera, and we shape an audition, which I then show to the director. So there's very little pressure to the experience for the actor and it's actually a creative and fun experience. It's a little more terrifying in the theater when an actor walks into the room and there are seven people sitting at a table, taking notes and judging them. That judgment comes in the film world at the end of the process, obviously. If you're lucky and you're beginning well before the film really goes into production, the casting director and director have a very close working relationship. You don't have to share them with millions of other people until it gets closer to production time. It's gratifying and wonderful, too, when you can promote and support new and young talent. And when an unknown or somebody you don't expect to be cast in a role gets a great opportunity, it's really thrilling.\n\nThere's a C.S.A. after your name in film credits. What does that mean?\n\nIt's the Casting Society of America, a casting guild. More recently, casting directors also unionized with the Teamsters. There was no official union for casting directors for many, many years. And so C.S.A. was a wonderful guild that was created, and now there is a union, too, so it's a good thing.\n\nCasting is a monumental creative undertaking. Should we start to see more formal recognition of it? Perhaps even an Academy Award?\n\nI do. I know that there's a lot of back-and-forth about that decision. But there are an awful lot of categories, and I think casting, particularly in the last decade or so, has really evolved into a creative process, and a significant one. I think both the individual casting directors and the field deserve that respect and recognition.\n\nYou've seen THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL. What'd you think?\n\nI loved it! I'm biased! But I love it."
