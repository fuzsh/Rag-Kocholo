        "text": "Earlier this week, it was announced that Warner Bros. have plans to reboot The Matrix franchise - however, the writer attached to the project wants to clear a few things up.\n\nNo official word has been spoken on the upcoming film but now Zak Penn has called 'fake news' on many of the articles doing the rounds due to the fact it's being described as a “reboot.”\n\n“Can’t comment yet except to say that the words ‘reboot’ and ‘remake’ were from an article,“ he wrote. ”Let’s stop responding to inaccurate news. All I can say at this point is no one could or should REBOOT The Matrix.\"\n\nHe continued: “People who know Animatrix and the comics understand. Do I want to see more stories set in the universe of The Matrix? Yes. Because it’s a brilliant idea that generates great stories. Look at what people are doing with X-Men universe. Between Logan and Legion and Deadpool, does anyone want them to stop? Not me.”\n\nWhile we can see what Penn is getting at, the fact remains that should Warners develop films based on The Matrix franchise, however tenuously linked to the Wachowskis' seminal originals, then that technically is a reboot.\n\nReports suggest that the plan is to create new stories set in an expanded universe much like Disney and Lucasfilm is doing with the Star Wars franchise.\n\nSure, many fans will remain hesitant to see Hollywood repurpose yet another franchise but it's worth noting that, if done correctly, we could have some seriously entertaining films in store."
