        "text": "As the director Jean-Luc Godard once wrote, ''Reality is too complex,'' especially these days, when entertainment purports to be a blend of fact and fiction.\n\nMore and more, from Steven Soderbergh's 2002 film-and-video feature ''Full Frontal'' to reality television like ''Survivor'' to the Sci-Fi Channel's mockumentary ''The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan,'' it is hard to tell what you're watching.\n\nIs the new thriller ''Open Water'' a documentary? No, it is a fictional scripted film, shot like a documentary and loosely based on a true story. On the other hand ''Touching the Void,'' released in January, is a docudrama that slavishly recreates what really happened to two British climbers in the Peruvian Andes.\n\nAnd then there is ''Incident at Loch Ness,'' the directorial debut of Zak Penn, a stocky young Hollywood screenwriter whose credits include ''Antz'' and ''X-Men 2.'' ''Loch Ness'' revolves around the legendary monster said to lurk near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.\n\n''Are there people here confused about what they saw?'' he asked an audience in June at the Seattle International Film Festival after unveiling the film, which later shared the festival's New American Cinema prize. Quite a few hands shot up.\n\nThe Internet is already buzzing about the movie, which is making the rounds of film festivals and will have an early Los Angeles premiere on Aug. 10 at the American Cinematheque at the Egyptian Theater. ''Is this a film about a documentary or a documentary about a film?'' asks KRr at www .aint-it-cool-news.com, ''Or a documentary about a documentary about a film?''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
