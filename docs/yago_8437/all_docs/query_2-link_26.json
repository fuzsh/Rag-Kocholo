He has worked on numerous Marvel Comics movie transfers including X-Men 2 and X-Men: The Last Stand, Elektra, The Incredible Hulk and The Avengers, to go along with pics like PCU, Behind Enemy Lines and Suspect Zero.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nPenn currently is working on a script for Warner Bros that is set in The Matrix universe hatched by the Wachowskis.
