Wicked[]

Stephanie J. Block (or 'SJB' as she is known by fans) was the original choice for the role of Elphaba, and was the actress Stephen Schwartz thought about while composing the original score of the musical. She read the role of Elphaba during the early stages of development in 2001-2002, before Idina Menzel was cast in late 2002. Block served as Understudy during the San Francisco tryouts of the show, before moving on to The Boy from Oz.

In 2005, Block returned to Wicked, originating the role of Elphaba on the first North American tour. Unfortunately, she injured herself during rehearsals, so original Broadway Understudy Kristy Cates, had to fly over and cover for her. Block returned March 18, and officially opened the tour March 21, 2005. She departed March 5, 2006. During the San Francisco stop on the tour from August to September 2005, original Broadway Standby Eden Espinosa covered the role of Elphaba, due to Block obtaining yet another injury.

She later reprised the role in the Broadway production from October 9, 2007 until June 15, 2008.

During her large career with Wicked she has starred alongside many actresses in the role of Glinda, including Kendra Kassebaum and Annaleigh Ashford.

Block also performed as Elphaba in the Fifth Anniversary one-off performance, The Yellow Brick Road Not Taken, and can be heard on the Fifth Anniversary cast recording singing "Making Good", a song which was originally the first song Elphaba sings. It was later replaced by the hit "The Wizard And I". For this recording, she is accompanied by Stephen Schwartz on the piano.

Block is the one playing Elphaba in the current Wicked Commercial.
