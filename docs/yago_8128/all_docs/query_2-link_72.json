He will also add to the mix a first-ever \"Virtuoso\" series, which launches on June 23rd with Soprano Kelly Glyptis and Eric Anderson at the piano. Summer 2022 marks Mr. Cortale's eleventh season leading the storied Art House. Taking center stage again is the internationally acclaimed Broadway @ series, first launched here by Cortale in 2011 and now in more than a dozen major venues worldwide. For Tickets and information, visit www.ptownarthouse.com or call 800-838-3006.\n\nProvincetown has long reigned as America's Best Beach Town, celebrated as the Best Gay Resort in America, and for over a century many of the nation's greatest artists have called P-Town home. In that tradition of cutting-edge artistry, for this eleventh season, Cortale's celebrated Broadway @ The Art House series will once again be home to an array of the New York stages' greatest stars: Rachel Bay Jones, Tony Award Winner for Broadway's smash hit Dear Evan Hansen and Star of Pippin returns to kick-off the summer 2022 series season on June 25 & 26, with Seth Rudetsky as music director and host.

Beth Malone, Tony nominated star of Fun Home, Angels in America and most recently star of the Off-Broadway revival of The Unsinkable Molly Brown, makes her anticipated PTown Art House return September 30 & October 1 w/Seth Rudetsky as music director & host.\n\nIf that summer star-power were not already strong enough to realign the planets, The Art House adds gravitational pull to its reputation for cutting-edge comedy and music talent originating out of the LGBTQ club scene, and increasingly crossing-over to mainstream success. Summer 2022 builds on that mandate all summer: Unitard, the comedy trio that Time Out NY called \"incredibly vicious and relentlessly hilarious\" returns to Art House stages with their Dangerous Adult Comedy July 12 & 13. RuPaul's Drag Race star and self-described \"women's lifestyle brand\" Miz Cracker arrives for the Provincetown debut of her hilarious stand-up comedy from July 20 through August 6.
