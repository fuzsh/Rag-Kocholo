Tony nominee Block took to Twitter on January 23 to make the announcement and to share an adorable picture of their daughter’s tiny hand holding her husband’s. The proud Dad tweeted that the newborn was named Vivienne Heléna Arcelus.\n\nBlock garnered her first Tony nomination for her portrayal of the title role in The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Her additional Broadway credits include The Boy From Oz, The Pirate Queen, 9 to 5, Anything Goes and off-Broadway’s Little Miss Sunshine. Arcelus most recently appeared on the Great White Way in A Time to Kill; his additional credits include Elf, Jersey Boys and Rent. He can also be seen in Netflix’s House of Cards. The two briefly starred in Wicked together on tour (before the wedding bells) and reprised their performances on the Great White Way.\n\nBlock and Arcelus wed in October 2007."
