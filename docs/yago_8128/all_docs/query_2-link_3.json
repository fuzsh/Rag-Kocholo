        "text": "When the latest Broadway production of “Into the Woods” arrives in Orlando, the leading roles of the Baker and the Baker’s Wife will be played by real-life married couple Stephanie J. Block and Sebastian Arcelus.\n\nShe’s a Tony winner for starring in “The Cher Show,” he’s a veteran stage actor who crossed over to TV and made a splash as adviser Jay Whitman on “Madam Secretary.” They met in 2007 while both starred as eventual outcasts in the national tour of “Wicked” — Block played Elphaba and Arcelus was Fiyero so as in real life, their characters had a happy ending … of sorts.\n\n“He’s made of straw…” Block begins.\n\n“But we end up together,” Arcelus continues, “… God knows where.”\n\nSince then, their characters’ relationship happiness has been decidedly mixed.\n\nBlock guest-starred as Jay’s wife on “Madam Secretary” — but their fictional counterparts divorced. And in a production of “Parade,” they starred as Leo and Lucille Frank, which ends with a stronger relationship for the couple but that’s overshadowed by a horrible tragedy.\n\n“Maybe our real life is too happy,” says Block with a laugh during a Zoom interview from the couple’s hotel room, in Nashville, where Block is recording a Christmas album between “Into the Woods” engagements.\n\nIn Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s hit musical, which debuted in 1987, the Baker and his Wife go through ups and downs as they navigate the tricks and traps of the fairy-tale woods — a metaphor for life.\n\nUnusually, this “Into the Woods” features not only Broadway’s set and costumes, but the closing cast — including Tony nominee Montego Glover as the Witch — as well as the conductor are also traveling as part of the production’s limited engagement. Orlando is one of only 10 cities nationwide to host the show.\n\n“That hasn’t happened since the 1940s,” says Arcelus of having so many New York cast members travel with a show on a nationwide tour.\n\n“Gavin Creel was kind of the ringleader,” says Block, referring to the Tony-winning actor who plays the Wolf (from “Little Red Riding Hood”) and Cinderella’s Prince in “Into the Woods.” As the show wound down in New York, he jumped on board for the mini-tour and planted the bug in his cast mates’ ears, Block says, with some well-placed encouragement: “I’m planning on… would you want to… wouldn’t it be great…”\n\nIt didn’t take much convincing.\n\n“We did not feel done with it, with the storytelling,” Block says. The show, nominated for six Tonys including best revival of a musical, was a critical and audience hit. It had been envisioned as a limited run in New York, though it was extended until its theater was no longer available.\n\nContinuing the show with the same cast has made it even stronger, Block says: “The comfort level we have now has made it a continuation of Broadway.”\n\nThe couple agrees that their real-life relationship adds a layer to their performances.\n\n“We sort of breathe together,” Arcelus says. “We have such a shorthand.”\n\nIn fact, he says, early notes from director Lear DeBessonet told them to tone down their natural connection in places.\n\n“We have to remember the Baker and Baker’s Wife are not on the same path as us,” he says.\n\nBut the couple does share a part of the fictional characters’ story. In the play, the Baker and his Wife yearn to have a child. Block and Arcelus faced the same challenge for five years.\n\n“It was a really difficult journey,” Block says. “It tested us as a couple.”\n\nToday, they have an 8-year-old daughter who is on the road with them. They will spend a few days at Walt Disney World before mom and dad take the stage at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n“We are packing up our trading pins,” says Block, who describes the family as “the nerdiest of nerds for Disney” — and was the original Belle in Disneyland’s “Beauty and the Beast” show.\n\n“We’re ‘lanyard people,'” Arcelus confirms with a laugh.\n\nThey don’t take for granted the privilege of doing what they love and spending time together — though they do maintain separate dressing rooms to accommodate their own preshow preparations. (“Seb has a special knock so I know it’s him if he wants to come in,” Block confides.)\n\nIn fact, their future plans include working more closely together in a production company they have formed that will be behind everything from children’s books to a TV dramedy that Arcelus is writing.\n\n“We want to make sure whatever we’re doing we’re contributing to the world in a lighter sense,” Block says, “doing something our 8-year-old daughter would be able to be proud of.”\n\nArcelus continues with the family theme.\n\n“It’s quite difficult being away from family so often in this business. It can really wear on a person,” he says. “Our prayer was to find a way to work together and be inspired and still be with our family.”\n\nWith “Into the Woods,” he adds, “our prayer was answered.”\n\n‘Into the Woods’\n\nWhere: Walt Disney Theater at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, 445 S. Magnolia Ave. in Orlando\n\nWhen: June 6-11\n\nCost: $49.75 and up\n\nInfo: drphillipscenter.org"
