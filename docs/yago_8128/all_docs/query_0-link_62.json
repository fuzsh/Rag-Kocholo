Arcelus began his acting career in the early 2000s and spent the first decade of his career on Broadway, having played Roger in Rent, Fiyero in Wicked, Bob Gaudio in Jersey Boys, and Buddy in Elf, among other roles.\n\nEarly life and background[]\n\nArcelus was born in New York City, New York, the son of Nobile Fiammetta Farace di Villaforesta (b. Budapest, Hungary, February 19, 1940) and Victor Carlos Arcelus.[1] He is a first generation American, and is of Uruguayan descent on his father's side and of Italian, Russian, Serbian and German descent on his mother's.[2] Through his mother, he is descended from Tsar Nicholas I of Russia (his great-great-great-great grandfather) and is a distant cousin of Prince Charles (third cousin once removed) and Prince William (fourth cousin) of the United Kingdom. He is bilingual in Spanish and English.[2]\n\nArcelus grew up in Port Washington on Long Island, New York.[2] He attended Williams College and graduated in 1999 with a degree in political science.\n\nCareer[]\n\n2000–2011: Early career and Broadway[]\n\nArcelus has made a career in theater on Broadway, regionally, and internationally.

He continued to do this throughout the 2000s and voiced characters in shows including Winx Club and multiple series within the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise. In 2004, Arcelus appeared in the movie musical Temptation, with Broadway stars Alice Ripley, Adam Pascal, and Zoe Saldana, among many others.[7]\n\nDuring the Spring of 2005, he starred as Jan in the original cast of the Beach Boys musical, Good Vibrations.
