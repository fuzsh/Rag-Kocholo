        "text": "Ivy Insights\n\nThe Stages Podcast is a must-listen for anyone in the theatre arts world or those who have a deep appreciation for the craft. Hosted by Stephanie J. Block and Marylee Fairbanks, this podcast brings together engaging conversations with entertainers about their business experiences and personal philosophies. With the perfect balance of humor, humility, and candor, the hosts take the time to prepare thoughtful conversations that go well beyond your standard interview-style show.\n\nOne of the best aspects of The Stages Podcast is the level of preparation and thoughtfulness that goes into each episode. Stephanie and Marylee clearly put in a lot of effort to ensure that their guests feel comfortable and that the conversations are meaningful. They ask interesting questions that prompt guests to delve into deeper topics and share personal stories. This podcast goes beyond just discussing the entertainment industry - it explores life lessons, personal growth, and perspectives on various challenges.\n\nAnother great aspect of this podcast is its ability to blend entertainment with life coaching. The hosts have a great rapport with their guests and create an atmosphere that feels like being part of a group of friends having an engaging conversation. The 5 questions segment adds an element of fun and allows listeners to get to know the guests on a more personal level.\n\nWhile it's difficult to find any negatives about this podcast, one potential downside could be that some episodes may be more specific to the theatre arts world, which may not appeal as much to listeners outside of that realm. However, even for those not intimately familiar with theatre, there are still valuable insights to gain from the conversations about life experiences and personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, The Stages Podcast is a gem within the podcasting world. Stephanie J. Block and Marylee Fairbanks bring together entertaining and insightful conversations with a variety of guests from the entertainment industry. Whether you're interested in theatre arts or simply enjoy hearing genuine conversations filled with humor and wisdom, this podcast is definitely worth a listen. The blend of entertainment, life lessons, and personal growth make each episode a joy to experience.\n\nEmmy-nominated actor John Stamos is a favorite of stage and screen, known widely for his work on hit shows like \"General Hospital, \"ER, \"Full House,\" and the sequel on Netflix, \"Fuller House.\" He has also starred on Broadway in HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, CABARET, NINE, and BYE BYE BIRDIE, and is beloved for his musical collaboration over the years with The Beach Boys.

After spending the last few years on Broadway, Celia can now be seen as \"Nyota Uhura\" in the hit Paramount+ original series, \"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\" In this episode, Celia shares how growing up in a community of \"theater people\" helped spark her own artistry and how she sees diversity in those who create off-stage is just as important as on-stage.
