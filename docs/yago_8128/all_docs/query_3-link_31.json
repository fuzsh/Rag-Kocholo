        "text": "Partly Uruguayan by heritage, and fluent in Spanish, Sebastian Arcelus entered his senior year at Williams College intending to write treatises on Che Guevara and similar revolutionaries after obtaining a degree in Latin American politics and economics.\n\nAn abrupt sea change took place when Arcelus continued a high school pattern of appearing in school musicals and took a part in “Into the Woods,” significant to him because Williams is the alma mater of the show’s composer, Stephen Sondheim.\n\n“All of sudden, my personal temperature changed, and I began soaking up as much as I could about the arts,” Arcelus said during a telephone chat from Boston, where he is currently performing in a tour of “Into the Woods” due at Philadelphia’s Miller Theater on April 4.\n\n“I called my parents and told them I wouldn’t be going to Washington or South America but be heading to New York for what I considered to be my new next step.”\n\nArcelus’ new calling and intuition to pursue it looks like the right call. Within a short time of being in New York, he began getting stage roles.\n\nThese led to two parts on television that made him nationally known, an editor at a Washington newspaper on “House of Cards,” and a frequent chief of staff, Jay Whitman, in more than 100 episodes of “Madame Secretary.”\n\nIn both series, Arcelus’ character had interesting love interests.\n\nHis real-life love interest, Tony-winning actress Stephanie J. Block (“The Cher Show”), appears with him in the tour of “Into the Woods.”\n\nArcelus and Block met while appearing together in a tour of “Wicked” that played in Philadelphia, he as Fiyero, she as Elphaba.\n\n“It is wonderful that I replaced Brian D’Arcy as The Baker in this production and get to tour the country with my wife and daughter. It makes such a difference when your family is with you on the road. It’s a great opportunity to see the country and be able to show it to my daughter.\n\n“Even though I chose the arts, I keep up with events in Latin America and am a major history buff. Having this tour go through Washington, Boston and now Philadelphia is like one huge educational experience. I showed my daughter a replica of the Liberty Bell in D.C.\n\n“I told her when we get to Philly, she’ll see the real thing. It is like when we were in D.C. and got to visit the actual oval office, not one on a television soundstage or in a museum. The real place!\n\n“I’m excited about coming to Philadelphia with enough time (a week) to take in all of the famous sights.\n\n“Theater is so different from television in terms of time. I was fortunate to be in television during the early years of my marriage to Stephanie. Television allows you more regular hours. ‘Madame Secretary’ was shot in New York, so I worked during the day and could usually be home for dinner with the family.\n\n“With theater, you have to pace yourself to do eight shows a week, including days with matinees. You’re not home in the evening, and you have to be mindful of being rested and alert for each performance. It’s a different discipline.\n\n“I can put it this way. Television, with its individual takes and starting and stopping, is like a wind sprint. The theater is like a marathon. You prepare and pace yourself different and accordingly for each.\n\n“I love television and working in front of a camera, but for most actors, I included, the thrill is being on-stage and being one with an ensemble and the audience.\n\n“One of my favorite things about being in smaller, more traditional theaters — theaters with a lot of history — is you’re closer to the audience. You get to play to them and not at them like you might when the stage is more distant from the seats.\n\n“A show like ‘Into the Woods’ benefits from that near a relationship. I can feel it in Boston where plaques on the wall of the Colonial Theatre announce ‘Oklahoma’ first played and was partially written here and commemorate other theater lore.”\n\nExcept for his foray at Williams, circa 1999, Arcelus had not seen any of the Broadway incarnations of “Into the Woods,” although he’d seen the PBS video of the original cast.\n\n“So many people know the show and have seen it since it first came to Broadway, our production, which started at New York’s City Center, moved to Broadway, then took to the road, is less like a revival and more like a revisit,” said Arcelus, who has a writer’s knack for turning a phrase.\n\n“Here I am playing The Baker again after 24 years.\n\n“The difference is during that time, I have become a husband and father, so I am more in tune and able to relate to what Stephen has set to music, and James Lapine has turned into a story.\n\n“My maturity and experience inform what I see in the character. Songs about cooperation and becoming a team rather than individuals are richer now that I am performing them with my wife who happens also to be my stage wife.\n\n“I also think recent politics has made ‘Into the Woods’ more current than it was when it premiered in 1987. It’s about a society banded together to solve a problem they have in common. All the psychology in each of the personalities comes to the fore. Within comedy, there’s something serious happening that has to be faced decisively and by a group working together. In 2023, ‘Into the Woods’ is more than entertainment. Coming out of COVID and seeing wars emerge, its story has become necessary and prescient.\n\n“It taps into an understanding of a need for community, simplicity, and reverence.”\n\nSpeaking to Arcelus is easy. He says he and Block are “grounded” as a couple, that both make their\n\nlivings in the arts. And you hear that in his conversation, along with a sense of contentment and understanding of the world.\n\nAmong the things he spoke about was having to apply the same energy and tenacity he brought to Latin American studies to his choice to embrace the arts.\n\n“I had to work hard. By deciding on the arts so late, I was behind other people who had dedicated their college years to being performers.\n\n“I spent four years doing something else. I don’t regret that. I continue to keep up with events in South America. I just needed to be more diligent about catching up.”\n\nThe arts, Arcelus said, as much as history, have broadened my horizons and prepared me for a stable life.\n\nThat is quite an accolade to the arts when one is in a different city every week.\n\nAs Arcelus says, his touring is easier because his wife and daughter are with him.\n\nNew challenges call Arcelus. Lately, he has begun to write and says he has a novel in the works and has finished scripts for several episodes of a television series.\n\n“Into the Woods” runs from Tuesday, April 4 to Sunday, April 9 at the Miller Theater, 250 S. Broad St.\n\nMontego Glover, Tony-winner Gavin Creel, and veteran Nancy Opel join Arcelus and Block in the cast, most of which performed the show on Broadway prior to the tour.\n\nThe Miller is part of the Kimmel Cultural Campus, and its site, www.kimmelculturalcampus.org is the best place to obtain\n\ninformation and tickets.\n\nPhillies opener\n\nThe Phillies begin playing in earnest on Friday when the 2022 National League champions’ 2023 season starts vs. The Texas Rangers in Dallas.\n\nGame time is 4:05 p.m. on Channel 10 and TeleXitos. The radio carrier is WIP (94.1 FM).\n\nThe television broadcast team for the year is the same as it’s been for several seasons: Tom McCarthy leading the group and doing play-by-play, John Kruk and Ben Davis doing color, with Ruben Amaro Jr. providing additional analysis.\n\nFormer Phils stars Mike Schmidt and Jimmy Rollins will appear occasionally.\n\nScott Franzke heads the radio broadcast squad. With him at the mic will be Larry Andersen, Kevin Stocker and Gregg Murphy.\n\nThe Phillies were dealt a blow last week when its popular star first baseman and reliable home run hitter Rhys Hoskins was declared unavailable for the season after tearing an ACL.\n\nThe Phils also begin the 2023 campaign without the services of the National League’s 2021 Most Valuable Player, Bryce Harper.\n\nThe opening day lineup will still feature some luster with Kyle Schwarber, Alec Bohm, Nick Castellanos and newcomer Trea Turner within its ranks.\n\nStarting pitcher is said to be Aaron Nola. Texas is likely to counter with their newly acquired ace Jacob deGrom.\n\nCoatsey retiring\n\nVeteran Flyers color analyst Steve Coates has announced he will be retiring from the broadcast booth at the end of this ice hockey season.\n\nThe Flyers will celebrate his 43-year association with the NHL club at a pre-game ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoates is known for his incisive commentary in the booth and on post-game programs.\n\nHe first visited Philadelphia when he played right wing for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nHe began broadcasting with the late, great Gene Hart in 1980 and made the radio broadcast booth his home in 1999 with Gary Dornhoefer. Coates moved primarily to television in 2014, working besides Tim Saunders.\n\nSaunders will need a new TV sidekick in 2024. I’m guessing it will be Keith Jones, who now does color commentary on radio with Jim Jackson doing play-by-play.\n\nBrian Boucher and Scott Hartnell are other possibilities.\n\nAnother is veteran hockey commentator, and recently installed Hall of Famer, Al Morganti."
