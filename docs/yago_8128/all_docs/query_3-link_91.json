        "text": "Miscast, the annual gala that benefits the MCC Theater, happened last night at the cavernous Hammerstein Ballroom. The tongue-in-cheek event derives its name from the host of Broadway stars who willingly sing songs for which they are woefully miscast—and to the utter delight of the audience.\n\nDear Evan Hansen star Ben Platt admitted to the crowd that a great deal of his childhood was spent dressed as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz (he divulges he was a huge fan of Judy Garland). The Pitch Perfect star opted to sing a haunting rendition of “The Man That Got Away” from the Garland classic A Star is Born.\n\nStephanie J. Block, who is married to House of Cards actor Sebastian Arcelus, confessed to nursing a huge “talent-crush” on another performer on the stage: Brian d’Arcy James. She paid tribute to the Spotlight actor by killing it with the song “What Is It About Her” from the show The Wild Party that James sang in the original production.\n\nThe first highlight of the evening was a star-studded rendition of “It’s All Over” from Dreamgirls starring, Tony-winning actor Norbert Leo Butz as Effie. Butz then gave a passionate and moving performance of the Broadway classic “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” which earned a standing ovation.\n\nHis rendition was particularly gutsy considering the original Effie —Jennifer Holliday—was sitting on stage. Indeed, when the Bloodline actor finished, he fell to his knees and proceeded to crawl over to Holliday’s feet and supplicate before her.\n\nAnd finally, it seemed fitting that Holliday capped off the evening with a towering rendition of “I Am What I Am” from La Cage Aux Folles, causing spines to tingle just as they did over thirty years ago in Dreamgirls.\n\nThe celebratory evening raised over 1 million dollars for the theater company, which is celebrating its 30th year."
