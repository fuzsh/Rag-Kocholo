        "text": "It’s time for my annual roundup of the pop culture things that were the most memorable to me this year. As always this is not a best of list. It’s just the things that stood out to me this year and that I found the most enjoyable.\n\nMovie I Saw in a Theater\n\nInterestingly the movie that I most enjoyed in a theater this year was not the much ballyhooed Barbie, but the widely panned The Marvels. I loved The Marvels. It was fun. It was funny. It had heart. I could actually tell what was going on in the action sequences, and it didn’t involve 30+ minutes of just watching a bunch CGI smashy smashy. And it was only an hour and forty minutes long. Bring back the 2 hour or less movie! I also mostly really liked Across the Spiderverse, but the fact that they left it on a cliffhanger left me with a bad taste in my mouth. There is a way to wrap up a story and leave things set up for a third installment.\n\nMovie I Watched at Home\n\nI have two movies that I watched at home this year that stood out to me. The first was Nimona. I gather that people who love the book were not entirely fond of this adaptation of it, but as I’ve never read the book and thus have no connection to it I found the movie delightful. Surprisingly, the other movie that I really adored was You are So Not Coming to My Bat Mitzvah. If you had told me that I would put a movie starring Adam Sandler and has family at the top of my list, I would not have believed you. But it’s just a really great family movie. It’s funny and sweet and real. I could still so very much feel those angsty teen feelings.\n\nFiction Book\n\nPeach Blossom Spring by Melissa Fu is a rich decades long story about multiple generations of a Chinese family that also brought my attention to pieces of history that I really didn’t know much about.\n\nHappiness Falls by Angie Kim is at its heart a mystery, but also the story of a family and even more so about the ways we communicate and understand each other.\n\nI adored Charm City Rocks by Matthew Norman. It was a wonderful romance that I loved all the more because it centered on music and was set in Baltimore.\n\nNon-Fiction Book\n\nThe books that go into this section and the previous one are all the books that I’ve rated 5 stars on Goodreads in the past year. It takes a lot for me to give a book 5 stars. I don’t usually hand them out all that frequently, so I was a little surprised when I realized how many non-fiction books I had given 5 stars to this year. Looking at the list I do think they all deserved it. Since there’s so many I’m just going to leave the title here and link you to my full review if you want to know more about why I gave it 5 stars. The only order this is in is reverse chronological order of when I read the books. It has nothing to do with any kind of ranking.\n\nWorld Within a Song: Music that Changed My Life and Life that Changed My Music by Jeff Tweedy\n\nThe Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness by Meghan O’Rourke\n\nVagina Obscura: An Anatomical Voyage by Rachel E. Gross\n\nThe Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny, and Murder by David Grann\n\nAcross the River: Life, Death, and Football in an American City by Kent Babb\n\nIt. Goes. So. Fast.: The Year of No Do-Overs by Mary Louise Kelly\n\nThe Teachers: A Year Inside America’s Most Vulnerable Important Profession by Alexandra Robbins\n\nInvisible Child: Poverty, Survival, & Hope in American City by Andrea Elliott\n\nTV Show\n\nThere were a number to TV shows I really enjoyed this year. At their core, I think the one thing they all have in common is that they are more about characters and spending time with people than they are about any kind of plot machinations. Despite my list here, I feel like they’re still not as prevalent as they once were.\n\nThe Law According to Lidia Poet – An Italian show set in the 1800’s about the first woman lawyer. The costumes in this show are worth the price of admission alone. Her dresses would be so uncomfortable to wear, but I want them all.\n\nFamily Law – A Canadian show airing on the CW about an alcoholic lawyer forced to go work for her estranged father’s family law firm. A perfect throwback to the old network shows that were my favorite. A nice case of the week plus ongoing character story arcs throughout the season.\n\nShrinking – A delightful dramedy about a psychologist played Jason Segal who is struggling to get over the loss of his wife. Harrison Ford and Jessica Williams are wonderful as his co-workers. I am not thrilled with where this season ended as I don’t like what it’s setting up for season 2.\n\nSomebody Somewhere – This show about people living in small town Kansas is just a beautiful show about friendship and family. Nothing much really happens. You just get to feel the joys and pains along with the characters. The first season was great, this second season where you already know the characters and the story doesn’t need to spend time setting up who everyone is just feels incredibly rich.\n\nThe Other Two – This show about two older siblings trying to make it in showbiz on the coattails of their famous teenage brother who is loosely based on Justin Beiber has always been somewhat absurd, but in this third and final season they just completely lean into it. The show is barely even based in reality in this season, and it’s all the better for it. So many brilliant gags.\n\nNever Have I Ever – This year brought the fourth and final season of the teenage coming of age comedy, Never Have I Ever. What a funny, sweet show that I’m going to miss horribly.\n\nFisk – An Australian comedy that perfectly walks the line of creating a socially inept protagonist who is surrounded by people who do insane things that they act like are totally normal making her continue to look like the weird one even though in these instances she’s the one that’s totally sane.\n\nTV Episode\n\nI knew very early on in 2023 what episode was going to slot into this category, and I was correct that nothing else superseded it. It’s the third episode of The Last of Us, “Long, Long Time”. It’s a beautiful love story about two survivalists played by Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett hiding out from the zombie invasion. It barely features the two main protagonists of the show. Yet, in the full context of the show it doesn’t feel like a one off because as the show moves on you often get these sort of short stories about whatever people Joel and Ellie are meeting during their travels. It was the episode that convinced me I did want to keep watching this show even though I wasn’t sure how much I would be interested in it given it’s not generally my genre of show and once they *spoiler alert* killed off Anna Torv’s character in episode 2, I wasn’t sure what I as in it for anymore.\n\nTV Moments\n\nThis is a new category this year. It may or may not last longer than year, but there were a couple of specific scenes in shows that stood out to me even if the entire episodes didn’t. So I wanted to have a way to mention those too. The first is from Somebody Somewhere. The end of the season 2 finale where Sam sings “Gloria” at a wedding is just pure joy. It’s something that’s been built up to all season and just comes to this beautiful fruition.\n\nThe second is from Season 4, Episode 7 of Succession in which Tom and Shiv have an all out confrontation about their entire relationship and everything we’ve seen over the past four seasons. Their relationship was always one of the most interesting things to me about this show, and this scene is just a brilliant encapsulation of everything that has come before and everything that has been building over the course of the show with it being even more cutting because he’s insulting her ability to be a mother without realizing that she’s pregnant.\n\nMy final one is from the show Platonic, which I didn’t like that much overall. However, the use of the song “Let the River Run” as the soundtrack song when Rose Byrne’s stay-at-home mom character goes back to work for the first time in forever was absolutely brilliant.\n\nAlbum\n\nIn order that they came out, my favorite albums of the year.\n\nThe Record by boygenius\n\nThis is the second collaboration between Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker collectively known as boygenius. They put out an EP a few years ago that I adored, but I figured that was all we were ever going to get. So I was super excited when they announced that there would in fact be an actual LP and a tour to go along with it. I do love them all as solo artists, but together they just bring all that power together and create something truly magical. I love the whole album, but “Not Strong Enough” is probably my absolute favorite song from it.\n\nWeathervanes by Jason Isbell\n\nWhen I first listened to the Weathervanes album, I wasn’t sure how I felt about it. I think I was partly primed to not be as keen on it as some of Jason Isbell’s other albums because the first single from it, “Death Wish“, is one of my least favorite songs on the album. Now Weathervanes is probably one of my favorites of his albums. It has no shortage of the typical Jason Isbell brilliant lyrics that will tear your heart out with a spoon. I think most people seem to agree that “King of Oklahoma” is the best song on the album with it’s lyrical specificity, but I disagree. It is a great song, but there is a song whose lyrics kill me even more. I’m saving my favorite song for the next category, but as far as lyrics that just create the most visceral picture in your mind in just a few words you can’t beat this verse from “When We Were Close“\n\n“I saw a picture of you laughing with your child\n\nAnd I hope she will remember how you smiled\n\nBut she probably wasn’t old enough, the night somebody sold you stuff\n\nThat left you on the bathroom tiles”\n\nHe has said the song is about someone who he came up in the music scene with that didn’t make it and he wonders how he got through and this other person didn’t. I’ve never actually heard him say specifically who the song is about, so maybe I’m wrong, but I think it’s pretty clearly about Justin Townes Earle.\n\nThe Returner by Allison Russell\n\nI adored Allison Russell’s first album, so I was very excited to have her sophomore solo release come out this year. It is equally brilliant. It’s garnering her even more attention and more praise than her first album did. It’s even earned her 4 Grammy nominations. All of it extremely well-deserved. The instrumental break in the first single and title song, “The Returner” stole my heart when it came out. “Stay Right Here” is a fun disco inspired song even though the topic of it is less so. I’ll talk about my favorite song in the next category.\n\nSong\n\nThe song that spoke to me the most this year was “Miles Away” by Old Crow Medicine Show. It’s about losing touch with once good friends because as adults life gets busy or you move away and trying to reconnect. It’s been a year when I’ve had 4 friends move away from Baltimore and one more who didn’t leave the area, but moved from within walking distance to a 30 minute drive away. In a time since COVID where it feels increasingly hard to maintain connections it’s felt even harder this year and this song really spoke to that for me.\n\nMy favorite song from Allison Russell’s album is “Eve Was Black“. It’s also the song that’s getting her some of those Grammy nods. I love the musical coda on the song. It’s a song about racism that I’m sure would offend a large number of people, but which I think is brilliant.\n\nI also have a favorite song off of Jason Isbell’s album. “This Ain’t It” is not one of the most lyrically poignant songs, which is generally what I gravitate towards his music for, so it’s a little surprising that it’s my favorite song. It’s just such a fun rock song. It also features his wife Amanda Shires singing back-up which I always love, and I don’t feel like she’s as prominent on this record as previous ones. For awhile they were ending their concerts with The Allman Brothers’ “Whipping Post”, and I feel like this is sort of their tribute to that song. It’s such a good song live. I’ve seen him play it in concert twice now, and it’s so good.\n\nConcert\n\nClearly my top concert of the year was going to the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame induction ceremony for John Prine and Trisha Yearwood. It knocked one of my concert bucket list items off the list and and was a night celebrating two singers I love with performances by a whole lot of other artists I love. There was really no way to beat that.\n\nI did also go to a number of other shows that were fantastic though. Trombone Shorty at the Moody Theater in Austin the night after we went to the ACL HOF induction was amazing. He is such a good performer. Allison Russell will just fill your soul with joy and goodness. You will leave any show of hers feeling a million times better about life than when you went in I promise. Amanda Shires doing an acoustic set at Rams Head on Stage as part of the Annapolis Songwriters Festival felt super special. Seeing Lauren Mayberry on the first night of her solo tour also felt special and she’s just so endearing. I love her. Finally seeing Lionel Richie in concert with Earth, Wind, and Fire opening was super fun. I realize I just listed like 3/4 of the concerts I saw this year, but they were all so good.\n\nBroadway Theatre Production\n\nI made it to New York once this year and saw three shows, Gutenberg!, Sweeney Todd, and Merrily We Roll Along. Gutenberg! may have been the most fun I’ve ever had at a Broadway show, but Merrily We Roll Along I think is my top Broadway production for the year. The performances in it were just so good. I expect it will win all the Tony’s this year.\n\nBaltimore Theatre Production\n\nMy friend and I did renew our Baltimore Center Stage tickets for this season, but like many other regional theatres Center Stage is struggling since the pandemic and has cut the number of productions they’re putting on. So there has only been one show there so far. The remaining three in our package aren’t until 2024. It was Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill, which I did enjoy. However, the show I most loved that I saw locally this year, was the touring production of Six at the Hippodrome. It was a very fun show about the wives of Henry VIII performed as if they were in some pop singing competition.\n\nPodcast\n\nI almost feel like I should retire this category because it barely changes from year-to-year. But I do have a new podcast to mention, so it’s not just me telling you listen to the same ones over and over.\n\nMake Me Smart\n\nMake Me Smart is still my favorite podcast. It’s been the reigning champ for many years now and doesn’t seem like it’s going to get overtaken any time soon. I do still miss Molly Wood, but Kimberly Adams has been a fantastic full-time addition to the show as the new regular co-host along with Kai Rysdaal. The show does in fact make me smart.\n\nToday, Explained\n\nToday, Explained is a daily news explainer podcast hosted by Noel King and Sean Rameswaram. I don’t listen to 100% of the episodes. I only listen if I’m interested in whatever topic they’re covering, but that does wind up being the majority of them. They do a 25 minutes or so deep dive into some news topic of the day, but not necessarily the most prominent things in news headlines. Recent episodes that I found interesting to give you an idea of topics were “How Barnes & Noble Survived”, “Why Millennials Dread Motherhood”, “Are Movies Too Long Now”, and “The American Politics of Israel”.\n\nHow We Survive\n\nAmy Scott was back for another season of How We Survive, which like Make Me Smart is a podcast out of Marketplace. This season she covers the worth of water, specifically focusing on the Colorado River. It’s so much better than it sounds.\n\nPodcast Episode\n\nMy favorite podcast episode of the year was from the podcast You’re Wrong About covering the Donner Party. I realized after listening to this that I actually knew very little about the Donner party. It was extremely fascinating.\n\nMy husband has to be in New York for several weeks for work in November and December so I picked a few days to come up with him and take advantage of a free hotel room. The one Broadway show I knew I was going to see on the trip was Sweeney Todd because I’ve been wanting to see it ever since they announced that Josh Groban and Annaleigh Ashford were going to star in it. I had already told my husband that I needed to get up to New York before the end of the year because based on when they started their run is surely coming to an end. And sure enough shortly after that they announced their end dates and that Aaron Tveit and Sutton Foster would be taking over the roles. I like both of those actors, but I really can’t picture Sutton Foster as Mrs. Lovett. So I’m glad I was finally able to make it happen.\n\nSince we’re already talking about Sweeney Todd we’ll work in reverse order like Merrily We Roll Along, the other show I have to talk about. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a full theater production of Sweeney Todd performed. I’ve seen songs from it performed in other contexts, and I’ve seen the movie with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. This is my first time seeing the actual stage production though. I wasn’t in love with it. I was absolutely correct in wanting to see Annaleigh Ashford in it though. She was fantastic and just as good as I expected. She’s really the reason to see the show. Josh Groban was good too, but unlike most people who were very much there to see him, I was mostly in it for her. Like if I had gone on one of the nights he was out but she was in I wouldn’t have been disappointed. The show itself just didn’t do much for me, which had nothing to do with this particular production of it. It just seems of a very specific time in musicals, but not in the fun retro way that some of the revivals of Sondheim’s 70s set musicals like Company and Merrily are. Also I noticed that the Playbills now have a page in them that literally says you apparently have forgotten how to function in a society, so here are the ways you should behave in the theater. The woman behind us clearly did not read them because she was singing along with the show, which was clearly one of the things they told you not to do. Like no one paid hundreds of dollars to hear you sing lady. Shut up.\n\nIn between Sweeney Todd and Merrily We Roll Along, I wandered over to Bryant Park to kill some time. I figured I could browse the kiosks in their outdoor market and then go check out whatever exhibits the New York Public Library had up as they usually have some interesting exhibits from their collections. This is the first time I’ve been to the Bryant Park winter market not on a weekend, so it was very nice to do it while it wasn’t insanely crowded. I even bought a couple of things. My husband got up there to meet me after work just as I was finishing up shopping. We decided to go ahead and grab an early dinner there since he didn’t eat lunch. There’s a million kiosks selling food, but we decided to sit down in a place they have built up called the Porch that’s a little more like an actual restaurant and has outdoor heaters. The food was mediocre, but it was a nice atmosphere. Since we had about 45 minutes after we were done eating before we needed to head to the theater we popped into the library and looked at their exhibits on the Equal Rights Amendment and some photographer whose name I have already forgotten who created these cool diptych photographs of people in the subway in the 1970s.\n\nI started off the day by seeing Merrily We Roll Along. I had started hearing some buzz about before it officially opened but was like the original production closed after only 16 shows. Is it really that good? By the time I knew when I was actually coming to New York the tickets were already pretty sparse and the lowest priced tickets were already close to $200. I was at least really interested in the cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Jonathan Groff, and Lindsay Mendez. I decided if I was meant to see it there would be a seat I could buy last minute at the box office the day of and at least save myself the online fees. Then the show officially opened and rave reviews made the already limited number of seats dwindle down to practically nothing. By that point my price point was even higher than what I already didn’t want to pay so I really started debating. I knew I didn’t want to buy ahead and be out that much money in case something happened last minute like I got sick and couldn’t go. So I waited. Then while we were on the train yesterday morning I looked and it was down to the last 4 seats in theater, and I realized that if I waited to go to the box office in a couple hours they would be gone. So pulled the trigger and bought one while I was on the train. I justified it to myself because I wasn’t putting out any money for hotels or my train ticket thanks to my husband’s work and reward points. It’s definitely the most money I have ever spent on a single ticket to see a Broadway show or a concert.\n\nPeople kept asking me afterwards if it was worth it. I enjoyed the show. I don’t regret my purchase. In an ideal world the ticket I would have spent the most money on would have been for my favorite show. This was not that. It was very good though. I’m now super curious about the original run. What about that production was so terrible that it closed so quickly or was people’s mindset just so different then they didn’t like it? Were they more idealistic and hated a show that starts off showing you how terrible these people’s lives end up and works backwards to their hopeful youth? Because now we’re probably like yeah that fits. I just don’t know. I need to research this more.\n\nThe cast in this production is fantastic. Jonathan Groff is perfect as Franklin, a man who is more interested in fame and money than his friends and family causing him to destroy both in his pursuit of more. Daniel Radcliffe’s performance of “Franklin Shephard, Inc.” was the highlight of the show. He received the loudest and longest applause for that. I didn’t think we were ever going to stop clapping. Jonathan Groff in that scene is also fantastic. He just sits there and the emotion on his face as Daniel Radcliffe is singing is aces. Actually the person who stole the show was whichever of the little boys that was playing Frankie, Jonathan Groff’s characters son. He was adorable and the audience ate him up. Lindsay Mendez was really the stand out in the show for me though. Part of it is just her character, but a lot if it is her performance of Mary Flynn too. Every scene she wasn’t in felt more lackluster for it. I have nothing else to compare it to, but it’s an excellent revival in my opinion and I expect it to rack up all the Tony’s. I have no idea why the original failed so spectacularly.\n\nMy husband thought he was going to go up to New York for work early in December, so I had been planning on taking advantage of a free hotel room for a night and going up with him and seeing some of the Broadway shows I wanted to see before they close early in the new year. That trip wound up getting nixed, so I was disappointed that I didn’t get to do all the things I had been planning. So after we wound up not going to Boston over Christmas I suggested to my husband that we go up for an overnight trip. We went up on a Wednesday so we could see two shows on Wednesday and then head back first thing the next morning. That helped avoid a lot of traffic and more importantly reduce the insane amount of money we had to pay to park. It’s way more expensive to drive in on a weekday apparently. If we stayed one minute over 24 hours it was going to double our cost. So our goal was to get in and out in under 24 hours.\n\nAlthough I knew I wanted to see Take Me Out and A Strange Loop, I did not buy tickets ahead of time because there were lots of them available. My plan was to try and get them half price from the TKTS booth, and I figured if I didn’t succeed there would still be plenty of seats open that I could pay full price for. I never wait in the line in Times Square because when we’re staying downtown if we’re there for my husband’s work I used to be able to go to the location at the Seaport, which COVID killed, or up to Lincoln Center where there isn’t usually much of a line. As predicted when we walked by the Times Square location the line was crazy long and would have taken hours to get through. We were going to make our way to Lincoln Center, but I looked at the app and saw that it was closed for some reason. So that was a bummer. We decided it wasn’t worth it to wait in the ridiculously long line and just made our way to the box offices and bought tickets. I don’t know what the discount was for, but the woman at the Take Me Out box office gave us some discount. It was still way more expensive than all the people who did get discounted tickets sitting around us, but I guess time is money and we decided that is not how we wanted to spend our time.\n\nTake Me Out is about a baseball team in which one of the players comes out as gay and stuff that happens after that. There is a lot of nudity in the play with most of it taking place inside the team’s locker room, so you had to put your phone in a locked bag that you kept with you so that you couldn’t take photos. Of course some dumb people didn’t listen and didn’t turn their phones off before putting them in the bag, so there were multiple phones ringing during the show which was annoying. I really liked the play a lot. It was way more humorous than I was expecting and lots of good drama too. It went into previews the week after my friend and I went up to New York back in March, so we missed it then and since it had a limited run like most plays I didn’t think I would get to see it. Then they brought it back for a second run, and I’m really glad I got a chance to see it before it closed again.\n\nI don’t really know how to describe what A Strange Loop is about, so I’m not even going to try. You can look some other summary online if you don’t know and you’re curious. I didn’t like this show as much. I did really like the music, which is one of the reasons I wanted to see it. I had really liked all the songs I had heard from it before going, and that was true during the actual show as well. However, overall I that it was just okay. The story didn’t do a whole lot for me. I’m not sad that I spent the time and money to see it though because I did really want to see it, and I don’t think there is any chance that it is going to tour despite winning the Tony Award for Best Musical because it would for sure offend a lot of people who would just be there because it was part of their season ticket package.\n\nMy husband booked us a room at the Millennium Premiere in Times Square. I would not recommend this hotel. We had to move to three different rooms for various reasons and the last one had issues too, but we didn’t realize until late because we were out and I doubt they would have been able to move us again anyway. The first room may have been fine except when we used the key to unlock the door and walked in there were already other people in that room. I’m not entirely surprised, since I don’t understand what the back end of their booking system looks like, but the two people working seemed to be struggling to find people open rooms at check in time and were telling each other room numbers not to use because they were going to use them. So I’m not entirely surprised that they double booked a room. Aside from that error I really don’t have anything bad to say about the staff as they tried to rectify all the issues and immediately brought us to the front of the line every time they saw us show back up in the lobby. After the first room they didn’t have any open rooms with king beds, which is what we booked. So they removed the resort fee from our charges since we only got a queen bed. However, when we went to that room something was clearly very wrong with the AC system as the thermostat was set at 65 and the room was 91 degrees. That was not at all tenable, so we went right back down and they found a third room for us and gave us a box of chocolate as an apology. That one seemed fine, but before bed we were getting chilly and that room had the opposite problem in that when I went to turn the heat up it wouldn’t turn on and there was something on the thermostat that said service. It wasn’t so cold that it was intolerable, but colder than I would have wanted it. Since we were only there for the night and we had already had so much drama I just threw my hoodie on over my pjs and I was mostly fine. They did also have a free to-go breakfast that had a lot of food in it, though we went to get bagels so I didn’t eat it.\n\nWe headed out pretty early, but before we left we walked down to Penn Station so I could get a black and white cookie from Zaro’s. When we take the train up I would always get a cookie to eat on the train home. Since COVID happened I have been up once and my husband has been up once separately from each other and both of us drove, so we each grabbed me a black and white cookie from somewhere else. They were both terrible. So to avoid the disappointment of another terrible, no good, very bad, black and white cookie I went to the source where I knew I would get a good one. There’s also a bagel place near Penn Station that I know I can get good bagels at, so it was easy to accomplish my two food goals right near each other.\n\nIt was a fun, quick trip and I’m glad we were able to make it happen.\n\nIt’s that time of year again where I share my favorite things I experienced in pop culture over the past year. As a reminder these are not necessarily things that came out during 2020 though many of them are. They are however things I enjoyed for the first time this year. This year is a little bit different because some of my standard categories I didn’t really have a choice in thanks to the pandemic. It wasn’t a matter what my favorite thing was. It was a matter of did I even get to do any of these things this year. Although I am sad that I didn’t get to do a lot in the way of seeing things like concerts and theater, which are what I love to do more than anything else in the world, there was thankfully lots of excellent pop culture to keep me entertained while I’ve been stuck at home for most of the year. Let’s get to it.\n\nMovie I Saw in a Theater\n\nThis was an easy pick because I saw exactly one movie in a theater in 2020. At least I enjoyed the film, though I doubt it would be sitting in this spot had I seen other movies over the course of the year. It was Birds of Prey, the Harley Quinn movie starring Margot Robbie. Who knew I was going to be enjoying so much Harley Quinn this year, since I also loved the Harley Quinn animated tv series now available on HBOMax. I actually appreciated the smallness of this movie. While I mostly enjoy a lot of comic book superhero movies I hate when they are too what I call smashy smashy where you have long 20-30 minute CGI fight scenes of characters just smashing on things and each other. They bore me to tears. There was none of that in this movie. The fight scenes were at close range and a lot of fun. It wasn’t a perfect movie, but I found a lot to like about it and am not sad that it gets to be the lone movie I saw in a theater this year.\n\nMovie I Watched at Home\n\nI probably watched more movies at home this year than I normally do because I couldn’t see movies in theaters. I normally prefer to see movies in the theater as I have a hard time concentrating on them for that long at home without getting distracted by other things. I think my favorites though were two documentaries about collecting, The Booksellers and Vinyl Nation. As you might guess The Booksellers were about rare book dealers and collectors while Vinyl Nation was about record stores and record collectors. I am not a collector. I guess I don’t have that kind of personality, but I enjoyed seeing the worlds of these people who are super into collecting their books and vinyl records. Despite being a librarian and avid reader I have no interest in collecting books. I borrow most of the books I read and am happy to send books back out into the world for others to enjoy. I rarely reread books so I don’t see the point of having shelves full of them. I do often wish I was the kind of person who was into vinyl collecting though. Music is obviously something I consume over and over again and the idea of having a collection of records that I look through, select from, and then sit down and listen to appeals to me. In reality though the record player we have is not even out on the floor and the two vinyl albums I own were WXPN pledge drive gifts. Realistically I am never going to be that person, but I enjoyed living in the world of the people who are for a little while.\n\nFiction Book\n\nWithout actually meaning to or seeking them out I feel like I read a number of books having to do with various wars or people living under the constant threat of violence. Although it is to some degree an entirely different thing I also felt like there were a lot of parallels to our current state living through a pandemic with lots of death, living in a constant state of fear, and not knowing if or when it’s ever going to end. The best of these books and the one that is the best fiction book I read all year is Apeirogon by Colum McCann. I am just going to share my review on Goodreads because I don’t think I have anything better to say about the book than that.\n\nNon-Fiction Book\n\nI have two books that qualify for my favorite non-fiction book of the year. Bottle of Lies: The Inside Story of thee Generic Drug Boom by Katherine Eban was the first book I read in 2020 and even then I said this is probably going to be one of my favorite books of the year. I was not wrong about that. It’s the informative and horrifying true story about how generic drugs are made and why there can be so many issues with them. This has made me question everything when it comes to the medications I take.\n\nThe second book, which was no surprise, was Caste: The Origins of our Discontents by Isabel Wilkerson. I was very much looking forward to this book as I loved Wilkerson’s previous masterpiece The Warmth of Other Suns. Caste looks at how the United States really operates on a caste system based on race. She delves into the history and the effects on people and our country. She offers the best explanation I’ve seen as to why it’s important for us to actually address this issue and do what we need to do to repair rather than trying to pretend it doesn’t exist or say it’s not our problem because we’re not the ones who caused it. If you read one of the three books I’ve mentioned here make it this one.\n\nTV Show\n\nI have a few tv shows I want to mention that were the highlights of a year in which I watched a LOT of television and that’s saying something given how much I watched before this. I already alluded to Harley Quinn in the movie section. It’s a fun adults only show that I was sad when I ran out of episodes of.\n\nThe first show I watched in 2020 was Schitt’s Creek. I binge watched it over my winter break last year. I had not watched it for a long time thinking it was not something I would enjoy. I was never into all the Eugene Levy and Catherine O’Hara movies and I generally don’t like shows where people are just awful so on the face of it this show was just not for me. But I had heard so many people talk about how much they loved it that I decided to give it a chance. I’m so glad I did because it is such a delightful show full of so much heart. It is a little rough going in the first half of season one where it felt more like what I was expecting, but eventually the show grows and the characters grow and it’s something that brings me so much joy. If you haven’t watched this show yet please do yourself a favor and do it.\n\nMy second favorite show of the year has sadly already met an untimely death after only one season. Thanks Netflix. It’s Teenage Bounty Hunters. I love this show so much! Talk about a show with so much heart. In some ways it shares a lot of DNA with Schitt’s Creek in that it is a ridiculous over the top story with characters that are somewhat caricatures but who have such heart that you just fall in love with them. Everyone I have convinced to watch this show has loved it and I know the many other people I’ve been telling to watch it but who have been resisting my efforts (you know who you are) would love it too. I saw it on a lot of year end best of television lists too. I wish Netflix had let it stick around and grow an audience because get why based on the name and description it wasn’t something people jumped right into when Netflix put it out, but it’s definitely a show that would have grown an audience through word of mouth if it had only been given time. Even though it does end on a bit of a cliffhanger I still highly recommend treating yourself to the one season of this show that we were gifted.\n\nI also fell in love with the show Wynonna Earp this year. It’s not a show I had ever really heard anyone talk about aside from one guest on a podcast I listen to. Apparently her love of the show was enough to get me to check it out and I’m glad I finally did. I tell people if they were Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans than this show is probably for them. It’s got a strong female lead, actually lots of strong female characters, love stories, and supernatural fun. I can’t wait for the second half of the most recent season to air hopefully sometime soon.\n\nTV Episode\n\nI have two episodes to talk about in this category. First Season 4, Episode 8 of Insecure, “Lowkey Happy”. This is one of those pay off episodes that I love from long running tv shows. Season 4 was mostly about Issa and Molly’s friendship and was an excellent season looking at the fading of friendship, but this episode was about Issa and her ex-boyfriend Lawrence. They reconnect over a long night spent together that reminds me of the Before movies. It was lovely and romantic and something that only could have happened with these characters and their relationship being developed over seasons.\n\nSecond is Schitt’s Creek Season 4, Episode 9, “The Olive Branch”. This is actually another payoff episode in that earlier in the season Patrick sings an acoustic version of the song “The Best” by Tina Turner to David during an event at their store that David both hates and loves. Then as a romantic makeup gesture after a fight in a later episode David does a dance to the song for Patrick. It’s so wonderful. It’s, no pun intended, the best scene from the entire show and is one of the videos I keep in my arsenal to rewatch when I need something to make me happy. Sadly it seems like the videos on YouTube of just that scene have all been pulled down. So you’ll just have to go watch the show to see it.\n\nAlbum\n\nI had far too many albums I loved this year to talk about in this post, so I refer you to the separate post I did recently on my favorite albums of 2020.\n\nSong\n\nMy favorite song of 2020 was Janelle Monae’s “Turntables”. It’s an amazing empowerment anthem that has kept me going through some pretty dark times in this year.\n\nAlso have to give a special mention to the song “It’s Still Alright” by Nathaniel Rateliff. It was the first song I added to my 2020 playlist and it’s a song I came back to a lot. Although the song is about substance abuse and the death of Rateliff’s long time producer Richard Swift, the soothing tones of the song and the lyrics of the chorus repeatedly telling us “and it’s still alright” were a continued gentle reminder in this year full of so much pain and sorrow that there are brighter days ahead.\n\nI will also give a shout out to the following songs that I also loved and listened to a lot this year. “Dreamsicle” by Jason Isbell, “Strangers” by Mt. Joy, “circle the drain” by Soccer Mommy, and “Lockdown on Date Night Tuesday” by Ondara. You can also check out my 2020 playlist on Spotify, which contains all the songs I heard this year that I liked enough to want to listen to again.\n\nConcert\n\nUnlike most years when I would have dozens of concerts to choose from in this spot, this year I only had two. The final concert I went to in 2020 before everything fell apart was Trampled by Turtles at Baltimore Soundstage. It was a fun show and one I would have cherished all the more had I known it was the last show I was going to see for who knows how long.\n\nThe concert that was ultimately my favorite and probably would have been in contention for that even if I had gotten to see everything I already had tickets to in 2020 was traveling to Nashville to meet up with a friend to see Brandi Carlile at the Ryman Auditorium. One of my favorite artists in a fantastic, historical venue with a friend and fellow music lover. Who could ask for more? If I was only going to get to see two concerts in 2020 I can’t complain that this was one of them.\n\nOnline Concert\n\nI’m adding in this new category this year because in lieu of getting to go out and see actual shows I watched a lot of artists perform online this year. Hopefully it’s one that I will only need to use this year because I want nothing more for 2021 than to be able to see live music again. There many, many online shows I watched from artists playing on Instagram and YouTube from their houses for free, shows I paid for with artists playing in their houses or shows I paid for with artists performing in actual venues with no audience. None of it fulfills the same experience as going to an actual live show and sharing the musical experience with a crowd.\n\nThe two things that I’m going to talk about here are things that are/were some of the least produced online music experiences but because of the way they are/were done brought at least a little of that communal experience you get from live music. When the pandemic first started Amanda Shires did 30 straight days of shows from her barn, which she called I So Lounging. Most of them also featured her husband Jason Isbell as well as Seth and Kelly Plemmons who were living with them at the time when we thought this would all be over in a few weeks. Seth is a member of her band and Kelly worked on the behind the scenes stuff. It was something that really kept me going those first weeks of lockdown when everything was so new and raw. It was wonderful to hear them play and just laugh and cry together and there was a little community in the YouTube comments for the shows. Although they were up on YouTube for a long time, sadly it seems like they’ve pulled all the videos down now.\n\nThe other online shows that I have loved have also been because of their regularity and the fact that they feel a little bit more intimate and personal. Almost every Thursday night since the pandemic started Amos Lee has been going live on Instagram on Thursday nights at 7:30. He hasn’t even been collecting tips. I’m not sure how he’s keeping himself going with no touring income. He’s done a couple of fundraisers for various organizations so whenever he does that I make sure to donate to whatever his chosen cause is. I’ve turned Thursday nights into a little bit of date night surrounding these concerts. We get take out and then I make my husband play a board game or card game with me while we listen to Amos Lee play. He’s even saved a lot of them to his IGTV so you can go back and watch if you want.\n\nBroadway Theatre Production\n\nEven though I had tickets to several shows later in the year I did not get to see any Broadway shows in 2020. My Company tickets were refunded. Who knows when or if that show will ever open. Our Music Man tickets were rescheduled twice and we’re now set to see the show in February of 2022. We thought it was hilarious when we were buying tickets for November 2020 in August of 2019. Little did we know.\n\nBaltimore Theatre Production\n\nI did get to see one show in Baltimore this year before everything shut down. It was Richard & Jane & Dick & Sally at Baltimore Center Stage. Unlike with the one movie I saw I can’t say that this was a show I super enjoyed. Sadly I’m not sure that the new artistic director and I see eye to eye on theatre. After loving almost every show I saw there for many years as a season ticket subscriber, this past season I didn’t really like much of anything. I think most of it was chosen in the interim before she actually started so I’m hoping that I’m wrong and that when the finally do get back to being able to have actual shows there that she selects shows that are more to my liking.\n\nOnline Theatre Production\n\nLike with concerts I saw some online theatre productions this year as well. Some were previously taped performances that were released from archives. Some were weird Zoom like things (though not actually on Zoom). And some were live productions in front of no audience. I watched several shows put on at the Old Vic in London that were produced live with no audience. It lead to me watching theatre at some very odd times given the time difference. I think my favorite was Three Kings starring Andrew Scott, who you may know as Hot Priest from Fleabag. Sometimes one person shows where it’s just one long monologue can lose my interest, but I thought he did an excellent job and the story he was telling kept me engaged.\n\nPodcast\n\nI think I’ve mentioned Make Me Smart to some degree in this space every year since it has existed and that is not going to change this year. This year they expanded from their once a week on Tuesday episode to transitioning to a daily podcast after the pandemic started. They still do what they call the big show on Tuesdays, which is usually around a half hour or so. Then the other days they do short 15 minute episodes most of those they each bring a news story and something that makes them happy to talk about. They started naming the episodes at some point: Make Me Smart Mondays, Big Show Tuesdays, Whatta Ya Want to Know Wednesdays (in which they ditch the normal daily show format and spend the whole episode answering listener questions), Hollowed Out Shell Thursdays (because by that point in the week we all feel like hollowed out shells), and Economics on Tap Fridays (their weekly happy hour episode where they would have a drink and would often live tape over YouTube so people could see them and join in in the comments). It’s the first podcast I put on every time there’s a new episode in my feed. It helps me going and I’m so happy they expanded to 5 days a week.\n\nStaying in with Emily and Kumail was a short lived podcast produced by Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani that they put out at the beginning of the pandemic when we were all in lockdown. They basically just talked about their lives and the things they were enjoying and experiencing. Although she is no longer practicing Emily is a trained therapist so she had a lot of great insights to offer about what we were all experiencing and how we were experiencing them. She also is immunocompromised and at high risk for COVID so they were being extremely careful just like my husband and I have been. So it was nice to get their perspective on that as well. It’s not something that would probably make sense to listen to now if you didn’t listen to it when it was first on, but it was super helpful for me in processing everything that was happening and all the feelings I was having at the beginning of the pandemic. I get why it’s not something they kept up, but I do think it would be kind of nice to have a check in episode every once in awhile.\n\nPodcast Episode\n\nMy favorite podcast episode of the year was the Song Exploder episode in which Semisonic broke down their song “Closing Time”. I’m not going to give anything away. You should just go listen to the episode. I will only say this, that song has way more meaning behind it than you think and I will never hear it the same way ever again.\n\nOnce again it’s time for my annual post on the pop culture that was most memorable to me over the past year. As always it doesn’t have to be something created in 2019. It just has to be something I consumed over the past year. And as always I emphasize that these are the things that meant the most to me, not necessarily the things that I think are the best thing made in any given category. In past year’s I’ve mostly tried to limit myself to one thing per category. I’m going against that this year in several categories because who says I have to choose just one thing? Sometimes I enjoy multiple things an equal amount and don’t want to choose between them. These are the things that brought me joy this year and why shouldn’t I want to introduce you to as many great things as possible? I make the rules here, so I say no arbitrary limits on how many things I’m allowed to write about!\n\nMovie I Saw in a Theater\n\nI often lament the lack of good romantic comedies like there once were, so I always try and go see the few and far between rom-coms that make it into movie theaters even when I know they are going to be terrible because I want Hollywood to know there’s a market for them. This year though the one rom-com I saw in a theater was not terrible. In fact it was my favorite movie of the year, The Long Shot starring Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen. I was slightly dubious about it because I don’t love Seth Rogen and all his drug humor. There was some of that in this movie, but just the right amount. I thought it was a very funny and sweet movie with a great modern day rom-com set-up for why the two leads just couldn’t be together.\n\nI’ll also give a shout out to Knives Out, which was a very fun whodunit.\n\nMovie I Watched at Home\n\nThis is the category I always have the hardest time filling out partly because I can never remember what I watched. Last year I kept a list and that worked out really well, so I thought that I would do that again this year. It didn’t really work though because every time I watched a movie at home, which wasn’t that frequently, I thought well that was okay, but I’m not even going to bother adding it to my list because there’s no way I would put it in my end of the year blog post. And that’s how it went for pretty much every movie I watched this year. There were zero movies on that list as of mid-December.\n\nI didn’t initially think to include it because it’s not a traditional movie per se, but I’m going to go with the four hour Tom Petty documentary, Runnin’ Down a Dream. I’ve been meaning to watch it for years because Tom Petty is one of all time favorite artists and I’ve always heard good things about it. I just never wanted to commit 4 hours to it, but this year when I had a snow day back in February I thought today is the perfect day to finally watch this. It was indeed a very good music documentary. It focused mostly on Tom Petty’s musical career and didn’t delve much into his personal life, so I felt like it was a very good companion with the book Petty: The Biography by Warren Zanes which gets much more into Tom Petty as a person.\n\nFiction Book\n\nI have two very different books I’m putting in this category this year. First is The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai, which I recently read for my book club. The book moves back and forth in time between 1980s Chicago during the height of the AIDS crisis and 2015 Paris where you pick up with the sister of one of the young men who died and who nursed many of the men in his friend group as they too succumbed to the disease. The 1980s part is for sure the better half of the story. Some of those characters are still with me. The 2015 half while not as good is still engaging enough as to not drag the entire book down and I appreciated how everything came together at the end.\n\nThe other novel that I really loved this year was Fear of Falling by Georgia Beers. It was just a really great romance about a famous singer who recently lost her manager and whose label assigns a woman to manage her that she winds up having feelings for. It has very realistic obstacles throwing a wrench in their budding romance and I literally couldn’t put it down. We were on vacation in L.A. and my husband finally had to force me to quit reading so we could go out to the Griffith Observatory.\n\nNon-Fiction Book\n\nI actually have three non-fiction books that I want to write about. One Day: The Extraordinary Story of an Ordinary 24 Hours in America by Gene Weingarten. In this book a reporter picks a random day out of a hat and writes a book about what happened on a day that historically we would say nothing really happened. He digs into stories that may not have garnered national attention but that certainly impacted individual people, families, and communities. I found it to be a really fascinating book.\n\nSay Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland by Patrick Radden Keefe is fantastic book covering the modern history of the I.R.A. and the Irish troubles. It’s a really well written book that presents a lot of information in a really accessible way. I learned so much more than I ever knew and it gave me a much better understanding of why a hard border being imposed as part of Brexit would be such a big deal.\n\nMy final non-fiction book is Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment is Killing America’s Heartland by Jonathan Metzl. Physician and sociologist Jonathan Metzl explores how long held ideologies based on both overt and covert racism cause people to create policies that are detrimental to their own lives. Using focus groups and lots of comparative data analysis looking at states both before and after they passed certain laws and comparing them to states with similar demographics with opposite laws. He looks at gun laws in Missouri and how they have led to a huge increase in gun based suicide by white men. In Tennessee he examines the decision to not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act causing significantly worse health outcomes compared to people in Kentucky where the Medicaid expansion was passed. Finally, he looks at tax cuts passed in Kansas particularly focusing on the effects on education. It’s a really well-researched book and a really compelling though maddening read.\n\nTV Show\n\nAs much as I lament the lack of certain types of tv shows that once existed in larger quantities before streaming and prestige television took over there were still a number of tv shows that gave me great pleasure this year. I have already implored you multiple times to watch both Atypical and The Bold Type, and I’m not sure I have much new to say about them. However, as far as I know I haven’t convinced anyone else to watch them yet, so I’m going to keep trying because they are really great shows. I rarely rewatch tv shows because there’s always so much new stuff out there, but I’m already considering an Atypical rewatch because I miss those characters.\n\nChernobyl was an excellent show. I avoided watching it for a long time despite all the rave reviews because I thought it was going to be too depressing. I thought maybe I’ll watch just one episode a week to make it more bearable and then I wound up binge watching it because it was so good.\n\nDerry Girls was pure delight. I also liked that having read Say Nothing meant I had a little better insight into the time and place when the show is set, but it’s not really necessary to know that much about the Irish Troubles to enjoy the show. It’s just a wonderful broad comedy about teenagers in Derry, Ireland in the 80s. The 12 episodes that exist right now are just not enough. I can’t wait until the release more.\n\nSpeechless ended its run on a high note back in the spring. If you’re unfamiliar it’s a sit-com about a family whose oldest son has cerebral palsy and who is played by an actor who does in fact have CP. It was a funny and heartfelt show that I think ended in a perfect way even if I wish we got more episodes. Also a special shout out to two other shows I loved that ended their runs this year Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Jane the Virgin.\n\nUnbelievable was a really well done limited series based on a true story of a young woman who was raped and not believed and the two female cops working on rape cases years later who finally brought her justice. It stars Kaitlyn Dever, Toni Collette, and Merritt Weaver giving excellent performances.\n\nI also really enjoyed Ken Burns’ documentary Country Music. It was well worth the 16 and half hours of my time. I even wanted more because he didn’t go far enough in time for my liking. Maybe he’ll add more onto it down the line at some point.\n\nI also would be remiss to not include Grey’s Anatomy because it’s still one of my favorite shows to watch every week. Last season and this season have felt like somewhat of a resurgence for the show even though I’m super annoyed with all the tie-ins to Station 19 to try and force people to start watching that. Seems like it’s only going to get worse when that show actually returns after the new year, which is just going to make me madder. All they’ve done is make me never, ever want to watch that show just out of principle.\n\nTV Episode\n\nThe best tv episode I watched this year is also the hardest episode of anything I think I’ve ever watched. It was the fifth and final episode of the limited series When They See Us about the Exonerated Five who were wrongly convicted of brutally attacking and raping a woman in Central Park when they were teenagers. The final episode focuses on the experiences of Korey Wise, who was the oldest of the boys and the only one sent to an adult prison. It’s a brutal watch even beyond the rest of this series, which is extremely difficult but important.\n\nIn an entirely different vein, I love episodes of character based tv shows that just feel like a joyous pay-off for the characters where you get to mostly just watch them enjoy themselves. It obviously wouldn’t make for compelling television if every episode were like this, but I love when a show has developed its characters enough that they get a well deserved episode to just have fun and have good things happen to them. Season 2, Episode 9 of Pose, “Life’s a Beach”, felt like that. There were many excellent episodes in season 2 of this show which only got better this season in no small part because they dropped the stupid white characters from season one that were obviously there to sell the show to the network. Anyway, in this episode the ladies get to mostly take a break from their struggles and head away to a weekend at the beach. Their road trip is wonderful and watching them singing together in the car on the drive to the beach brought me great joy.\n\nAlbum\n\nIf you don’t know what’s coming in this category then you obviously have not been paying attention to anything happening here in the past year. There were two albums that dominated my 2019. Way back on January 18 when it was released I predicted that Maggie Rogers’ Heard It in a Past Life would very likely be my album of the year, and I was not wrong. Every amazing album that came after it in 2019 did not manage to unseat it from my heart. It is by far the album I have listened to the most in 2019 (my highly skewed Spotify stats notwithstanding). I adore every song on it, and it’s one I’m sure I’m going to continue to go back to in 2020.\n\nThe album that Spotify thinks is my most played album of 2019 is the other album that deserves a spot here and that’s the debut (and maybe only) album by The Highwomen the country super group composed of Amanda Shires, Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris, and Natalie Hemby. Spotify thinks that because I did for sure listen to this album a lot, but unlike other albums pretty much only on Spotify because I bought the album as a physical CD along with a hoodie and bumper sticker. The CD is still sitting under my coffee table wrapped in cellophane. It’s too much of a pain to drag out the external optical drive to upload the songs from the CD onto my computer (#firstworldproblems).\n\nThe Highwomen’s album is full of amazing songs by these women that seek to uplift other women. As they have said many times it’s more than an album or a group it’s a movement. I adore everything that it stands for. I love these women together and separately. Even though the idea for the group came from Amanda Shires, Brandi Carlile has sort of been the front woman for the project. I’ve heard them call her their quarterback. This is only a small part of what she’s doing to lift up other women in music and there’s a reason I will follow her to the ends of the earth (I already have tickets to see her three times in 2020 in places nowhere near where I live.)\n\nRecently she was awarded the Trailblazer Award for Women in Music by Billboard. It so happens that Maggie Rogers was the one to present the award to her and Maggie’s speech pretty much exemplifies why I love both of these women so much.\n\nSong\n\n2019 was a fantastic year for music. My 2019 playlist of songs I loved during the year is longer than any playlist I’ve created by over half. I’ll share that in a future post, but for now I’m going to focus on a single song here even though I could include a hundred. It’s the title song from The Highwomen called “Highwomen”. It’s a rewrite of the song from The Highwaymen, the 80s and 90s male country super group which they created a female alternative to. It re-imagines the lyrics with each verse telling the story of a woman who was persecuted. It’s an incredibly powerful song. I first heard it before it was even released when they performed it at the Newport Folk Festival. It gave me chills and made me know for sure that this album was going to be something that I loved to my very core.\n\nActually I lied. I have two songs because I was just reviewing the list I keep throughout the year for this blog post and realized that I had Gary Clark Jr.’s song “This Land” listed under this category as a possibility and I think it deserves a mention. It is one of the most powerful songs I can remember hearing and the video just drives it home. When I watched his Austin City Limits episode I was wondering if they were going to bleep the n-word in this song, which they did. But then I saw a promo for the episode that included a snippet of this song that didn’t bleep it. Go figure.\n\nConcert\n\nI usually don’t allow myself to choose a set from The Newport Folk Festival to go in this spot because I’m pretty sure I would never write about anything that didn’t happen at Newport ever again. Perhaps I should just create a new category for the best thing I saw at Newport, but I’m not going to do it this year. I am however going to write about two sets that happened at Newport though because one would have been the highlight of my year if it weren’t for the second and the second is the literally the most amazing musical experience I have ever had in my life so there was no way I couldn’t include it here.\n\nThe first set I’m referring to was The Highwomen’s debut and as of this writing still the only actual full concert set they’ve done. I thought that they would at least do a couple dates in conjunction with the release of their album and was willing to travel anywhere to see them again, but they never did and at this point I don’t know if they ever will. I’ve seen up to three of the four of them join each other for a few songs at each other’s shows, but no other full on performances. I’ll be seeing Brandi Carlile at the Ryman in January and Natalie Hemby is opening for her. Since Amanda Shires and Maren Morris both live in Nashville and it doesn’t look like either one of them will be touring then I’m hoping maybe we can get a little reunion during that show if Maren isn’t in labor since she’ll be hugely pregnant by then. Anyway, I feel so blessed to have seen them perform. The album wasn’t out yet at that point and listening to them play it through I knew it was going to be one of my favorite albums of the year. Since I already embedded my favorite song in this post here’s a song I love, but the best part of this video is the intro.\n\nThe other set was obviously the Saturday night all-female headlining set curated by Brandi Carlile with surprise guest Dolly Parton. It still really don’t have any words for it. It was truly magical to see so many awesome women up on stage together collaborating. It would take me to long to even name them all. One of the stories I read about it after the fact said something to the effect of can someone please go check on Jade Bird and make sure she’s all right. She was smiling so big up on the stage I’m worried she hurt herself. It’s true. I went back and looked at her in some of the video and I don’t think she could have been smiling any harder. That’s how I feel about it. I still smile every time I think about it. Newport always surprises me, but I don’t know how anything can ever possibly top this experience in my book.\n\nBroadway Theatre Production\n\nFor some reason I apparently was very into pop culture reflecting stories about 1980s Northern Ireland and the Irish troubles in 2019. I don’t know why. It’s not something I sought out. It just happened. This is all a lead in to say that my favorite thing I saw on Broadway this year was the play The Ferryman. It’s for certain the longest show I’ve ever seen as a three act play clocking in at 3 hours and 15 minutes including a 15 minute intermission and a 2 minute “pause”. It has a sprawling cast of people from seniors to a real baby about which I jokingly wondered how many babies do they have backstage to make sure they have one that isn’t crying during the show? It pretty much had all your emotions covered bringing you through experiences of great joy and others of sadness. It was also super intense at times particularly the ending, which I did not really see coming. I left that play thinking I have no idea how those actors do that 8 times per week. It’s closed on Broadway now, but if you ever get a chance to see a production I highly recommend it.\n\nBaltimore Theatre Production\n\nI adored Come From Away when I saw it on Broadway and saw it again in 2019 as part of our 2018/2019 season tickets at the Hippodrome. It was just as effecting as when I saw it the first time. It’s definitely one of my all-time favorite musicals ever. It’s still running on Broadway and if you’re ever in New York looking for a show to see I can’t recommend it highly enough. Don’t let the fact that it’s about 9/11 make you think you’ll leave horribly depressed because you won’t. Of course there are sad and difficult parts, but it will also leave you filled with a hope for humanity that seems in very short supply these days. The current cast did a Tiny Desk Concert at NPR this year on the anniversary of 9/11, which will give you a great taste of the show.\n\nPodcast\n\nI still love Make Me Smart, which I’ve mentioned in this category the past two years, but this year I’m branching out and talking about two limited series podcasts. At a total of 19 episodes between the two of them you can listen to them both in less than a day’s time. I seriously did listen to Bhi Bhiman’s Peace of Mind in a single day save for the final episode, which hadn’t dropped yet when I discovered the podcast. It’s billed as the first album released as a podcast. Bhi Bhiman wrote a bunch of songs related to social and political issues and then recorded podcast episodes exploring further the topics he wrote about in his songs. It’s really fascinating and is something I for sure have never seen done before.\n\nThe other podcast I have to recommend to you is Dolly Parton’s America, which I feel like everyone has been listening to. I’ve seen so much written about it, posted on social media, talked about on other podcasts, etc. I even overheard the people at the table next to me at brunch the other week talking about it. Jad Abumrad uses interviews he had with Dolly over the course of several years as a spring board to talk not only about her and her career but how they relate to the larger country and the issues we face as a whole. It’s really great.\n\nPodcast Episode\n\nObviously I thoroughly enjoyed and very much recommend all the episodes of the podcasts I just talked about, but I thought I would branch out a little for my favorite episode and talk about the two episodes (part 1, part 2) of the Out of the Blocks podcast titled “Out of the Docks”. I’m not going to lie. There’s a good chance I picked these episodes just because I love the punny episode title so much. In these episodes rather than visiting a single city block in Baltimore like they normally do they talk to people who live and work on boats in some of Baltimore’s harbors. It was a fascinating look at the difficulties of living on a boat and the reasons why people choose to do it.\n\nI went up to New York this past weekend to see a couple of shows. I usually go up in the fall and spring for a weekend to see a bunch of shows. I had been wanting to see Hadestown for awhile, but just couldn’t commit to when I wanted to go up and see it until Little Shop of Horrors spurred me on. As soon as I saw the announcement that Jonathan Groff and Christian Borle were going to star in an off-Broadway revival of Little Shop of Horrors I knew I had to see it. I love them both and thought they would be perfect in this show. Since it had a limited run I had to commit to a date. I usually try and do three shows on weekends I stay overnight, but when I bought these tickets there wasn’t anything else I had been dying to see except Oklahoma! which I had already made plans to go up and see with friends. In retrospect there were a couple of plays that weren’t open yet when I bought the other tickets that I would have liked to see, but I didn’t feel like paying to change my train ticket. Plus it was nice to get home earlier on Sunday rather than 9 pm.\n\nIf I wind up staying in a hotel that I have to pay for I usually cash in some of our credit card points. In the past I’ve stayed in the Doubletree in Times Square, which is nice because even though it’s in Times Square (ptooey!), it’s in the part that is closed to traffic so it’s quiet. For whatever reason that wasn’t one of my options this time. Based on looking at the reviews of the three hotels available in mid-Town, I went for the Hyatt Centric because it had the least complaints about noise. All three of them had complaints about a tacked on resort fee for each night, which is super annoying and something the Doubletree didn’t have. None of the hotels in question are resorts, so it is really obnoxious. The hotel points don’t cover the resort fee, so I had to pay out of pocket for that $35. They informed me when I checked in that the coffee, tea, and water bottles in my room were covered under the resort fee. Those were some great $17.50 bottles of water I drank.\n\nOther than the dumb resort fee it was a fine place to stay, and I would stay there again. I had a weird deja vu moment when I got to the hotel though. I was like I have been in this place before, and it took me a minute to figure out why because I knew I had never stayed there before. I finally put two and two together and realized that when I met my friend from Minnesota in New York to see Hamilton it was the hotel she stayed at and I had met her in her room when I got to the city.\n\nI didn’t have enough time to do much of anything before Little Shop after getting checked into the hotel, so I wandered through the street festival that was happening on 8th Avenue. I thought I might grab lunch there, but didn’t wind up super inspired by anything so I walked over towards the theatre to see what I could find near there. I wound up going back to Blossom du Jour, which is a little vegan restaurant on 9th Avenue. I had eaten there with friends before and liked it. It’s mostly take away with a little counter seating. Perfect for the quick lunch I was looking to grab.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors was great. The fact that it was in a small 275 seat off-Broadway theatre was perfect for it. I don’t think it would have felt the same on a much larger Broadway stage. Jonathan Groff and Christian Borle were perfectly cast. I can’t think of a better actor to play Seymour than Jonathan Groff. Christian Borle was the dentist plus a dozen other bit parts. Tammy Blanchard was Audrey and was the weakest part of the show. She was a fine actress, but not the greatest of singers, which was very apparent during her big solo song, “Somewhere That’s Green”. Of course it didn’t help that it’s one of the quietest parts of the show and someone’s stupid cell phone went off. Turn off your phones people! It was a delightful show, and I’m really glad I got the chance to see it.\n\nI met a friend that lives in New York for dinner at the newest location of Ainsworth Social, which took over the space where Southern Provisions used to be. Justin Timberlake, great singer, but apparently not so great at owning a bbq restaurant. It was eh. I’m not likely to be back. It was great to catch up with my friend though.\n\nAfter dinner it was on to Hadestown. I felt about Hadestown a little bit like I felt about Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812. I still literally have no idea what that show was about. Turns out turning 70 pages of War and Peace into a sung through musical does not make for the most coherent of narratives. I didn’t mind that it made no sense though because I enjoyed the experience of the show so much. I didn’t have a problem following the plot of Hadestown, I just thought it was BORING and there wasn’t much there, there. Ultimately I didn’t care for the most part though because I love the music in that show so much and it’s a fun show to watch. I have heard some people say that it has a “One Song Glory” problem though, and it does. If you don’t know what I’m referring to that’s the great song that one of the characters in Rent is supposed to be writing during the show, and then of course it can’t possibly live up to how great it’s supposed to be. I think Hadestown has an even worse problem. Unlike apparently some people I don’t hate “One Song Glory”. Is it anywhere close to the best song in Rent? No. But is it anywhere close to the worst song in Rent? Also no. In this case though the fantastic, amazing song that Orpheus is supposedly writing to get Hades to let Persephone go so that spring and fall can return and save the world is not only not the amazing song it’s supposed to be it is decidedly the worst song in Hadestown. He sings little bits of it throughout the show as he’s supposedly writing it and I groaned internally every single time. I still really enjoyed the show and am glad I saw it, but I maybe didn’t like it quite as much as I was hoping going in. “Wait for Me” is definitely being added to my theoretical list of wonderful Broadway songs though because unlike Epic I, II, and III it actually is an amazing song.\n\nMy train home on Sunday was at 11 am, so I didn’t really have time to do much before I left the city. I did however have time to go down to Fabrique Bakery on 14th Street to get a cardamom bun for breakfast. There as an article about them in the New York Times awhile back, and I became obsessed with trying one. Anyone who really knows me knows that I am an avowed hater of cinnamon. Cardamom is one of my favorite flavors though, so I really wanted to try this pastry that was flavored with cardamom instead of cinnamon. Everyone should make cardamom rolls instead of cinnamon rolls. It was well worth the trek down in the rain to try.\n\nSince I didn’t get my normal NYC bagel for breakfast I decided to grab one from Zaro in Penn Station to eat on the train for lunch along with my normal black and white cookie. I can now add a new screwed up bagel order to my list of things that have gone wrong with bagels I’ve ordered in NYC. I should really start checking them carefully before I leave. I have a standard bagel order in NYC, whole wheat bagel with strawberry cream cheese. The worst was the time they accidentally gave me lox cream cheese instead of strawberry. Imagine expecting to bite into something sweet and then it’s smoked fish. I’ve also been given an everything bagel with strawberry cream cheese on it instead of my whole wheat. That is not a combination I recommend. This time I got two different bagel halves. They slice them in half to go in the toaster and someone obviously grabbed half of someone else’s bagel and put it together with mine because I had two top halves and no bottoms. One half was the whole wheat that I ordered. The other half turned out to be cinnamon raisin. Seeing as I just told you how much I dislike cinnamon you can bet how I felt about that. Not to mention that if you’ve been around here for any amount of time you also know that I hate raisins. So not the best bagel experience ever. I’ll be back in the city in about a week and half to see Oklahoma! so maybe I’ll try again."
