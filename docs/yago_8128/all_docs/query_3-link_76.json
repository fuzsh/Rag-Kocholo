        "text": "THERE’S A NEW DEPUTY in town!” says Madam Secretary’s Sebastian Arcelus of the promotion his character, Jay Whitman, earned this season, serving Dr. Elizabeth McCord (played by Téa Leoni). “I’m thrilled,” says the 41-year-old, New York City-born actor and Williams College political science graduate. “I’ve always been drawn to the arena of politics, and considered becoming a journalist”—which he played on House of Cards—“but then I skewed to acting. They’re both the same sort of impetus: digging into stories.”\n\nAfter conquering Broadway in Rent, Wicked, Jersey Boys, and Elf, Arcelus is loving his television gig, as well as his 10-year marriage to Tony nominee Stephanie J. Block (Falsettos) and fathering their 3-year-old daughter. This is what we call living the dream.\n\nMadam Sec’s secretary of state, Elizabeth McCord, and Jay Whitman have been each other’s virtual shadows for four years. You’re the straight man to her out-of-the-box thinker, but it’s a symbiotic relationship. I love the way you’re always there holding her umbrella.\n\nBut what you don’t see is how muddy her shoes are! [Laughs.] Téa’s an amazing leader. She’s got her hand in everything and, unbelievably, can see the whole picture."
