Michelle Williams has revealed that she got married in a secret ceremony last month.

The Oscar-nominated actress was previously married to Heath Ledger after meeting on the set of 'Brokeback Mountain'. Ledger died in 2008 at the age of 28 and they had one daughter together, Matilda, born in 2005.

Her new husband is Phil Elverum, an indie musician best known for performing under the names The Microphones and Mount Eerie. Elverum has also been married once before - his first wife, musician Genevieve Castree, passed away after a battle with cancer in 2016. They also had one daughter together.

The newlyweds tied the knot in a secret ceremony in the Adirondacks in upstate New York last month, "witnessed by only a handful of friends and their two daughters".

Williams told Vanity Fair: "I never gave up on love. I always say to Matilda, 'Your dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes'.

She added: "Obviously I've never once in my life talked about a relationship, but Phil isn't anyone else. And that's worth something. Ultimately the way he loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole. I work to be free inside of the moment.

"I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free."
