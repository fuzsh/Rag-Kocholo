        "text": "Hollywood has had its fair share of celebrity romances, breakups, and makeups over the years. So much so that it’s hard keeping track of who’s dated who in the entertainment industry. While some celebrities make their romances know to the public, others prefer keeping their relationships out of the spotlight. One couple who was good at doing that was Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams.\n\nThough the pair were often spotted out together, they rarely spoke about their relationship publicly. But despite keeping the details of the romance under wraps, Ledger and Williams appeared to have the ideal relationship — that is until things started heading south.\n\nHeath Ledger and Michelle Williams relationship began like a storybook romance\n\nLedger and Williams first met in 2004 on the set of their film Brokeback Mountain.\n\nIn 2012, Williams opened up about her first encounter with Ledger, admitting to GQ that she was instantly drawn to him.\n\n“Our initial meeting, the circumstances of how we first met, were cosmic or something,” she told the outlet. “Yeah, a lot of things happened at once. It’s a bit like, we had a lot of things to do because we didn’t have a lot of time, or something.”\n\nThe pair, who starred as husband and wife in the romantic drama, bonded while filming a sledding scene that ended with a torn ligament in Williams’ knee.\n\nSoon, their chemistry had become undeniable. Even Ledger and Williams’ castmates could see a relationship blossoming between them.\n\n“I remember being in rehearsal, and the two of them had googly eyes with each other,” co-star Jake Gyllenhall confessed, according to E! News. “There were sparks immediately.”\n\nHeath Ledger and Michelle Williams were together for three years\n\nWhile filming Brokeback Mountain, Ledger and Williams began dating.\n\nNot long afterward, the couple welcomed their daughter Matilda Rose (born in October 2005) and had settled into a row home in Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill.\n\nThough they were two of the biggest celebrities in Hollywood at that time, the duo didn’t let their fame stop them from living like any other Brooklyn couple.\n\nWhile Ledger skateboarded through the neighborhood, Williams threw fundraisers for a local anti-development group. But despite their careers and side hobbies, the couple always made time in their schedules to take care of their daughter.\n\n“When Michelle is working, I’m the manny, and when I’m working, she’s the nanny,” the Dark Knight star explained in 2006 (per E! News), adding that family is “everything” to him and “the most important thing” he does.\n\nRELATED: ‘The Dark Knight’: Heath Ledger’s Joker Was So’ Stunning’ Michael Caine Forgot His Lines\n\nHowever, not long after that, things began to change as they started growing distant from each other. Then in September 2007, media outlets revealed that the couple had called it quits after just three years of dating.\n\nMichelle Williams and Heath Ledger broke up because of his drug use\n\nThough their romance started out perfect, it quickly unraveled due to Ledger’s partying and drug use. According to People (per Access), the 10 Things I Hate About You star’s hard-partying ways created a rift between him and Williams, ultimately causing her to pull the plug on their relationship.\n\n“He had a lifestyle that really wasn’t — at least in Michelle William’s eyes — compatible with raising a child and continuing in that relationship,” People Senior Editor JD Heyman shared. “Even though their relationship did not work out, she did love Heath — she loved him very much.”\n\nWhile news of their breakup was sad to hear, some were convinced the couple’s split would only be temporary. Even Williams’ best friend Busy Philipps felt like “it wasn’t the end of the story for them.”\n\n“They were so young and that baby was the light of both of their lives. They were just working all the time and it was complicated,” Philipps wrote in her 2018 memoir This Will Only Hurt a Little. “Sh*t is always complicated. Especially when you’re twenty-eight. And movie stars. With a baby.”\n\nBut according to a friend of the couple, they were just way too different and thought it would be best to live their lives separately.\n\n“In the end, there were too many differences,” the friend revealed, according to Who.com. “She kind of turned her head to those at the beginning, but when Matilda was born was really when she started to reevaluate things. I don’t think they fell out of love; it was probably tough love,”\n\nMichelle Williams never stopped loving Heath Ledger\n\nUnfortunately, Williams and Ledger never got the chance to give love another try because, on January 22, 2008, the Monster’s Ball actor died of an accidental overdose inside his New York City apartment.\n\nFans and celebrities were left devastated over the news of Ledger’s death. But their grief was nothing compared to that of Williams, who was profoundly affected by his passing.\n\nThough she took a break from acting to grieve in private, she ultimately pushed herself to come to grips with this tragic loss. She also helped her daughter Matilda come to grips with the loss too.\n\nAlthough it’s been more than a decade since Ledger’s death, Williams is still reminded of him every day.\n\n“Every time I really miss him and wonder where he’s gone, I just look at [Matilda],” the Dawson Creek actor shared in 2009.\n\nShe also makes sure that she keeps Ledger’s memory alive for her daughter’s sake."
