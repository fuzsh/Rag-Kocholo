She's in her mid 30s and think he's a bit younger. He immediately stated going out with Michelle Williams who has gotten pregnant very quickly so I hope that Michelle isn't heading for heartbreak\n\nI wonder how Naomi Watts feels about it?\n\npairofpants wrote:\n\nWell possibly the only time in my life I've seen this expression 'Straw man argument' used with any degree of solemnity is on this forum. It has become a meme throughout the forum and now basically lots of people use it to discredit an argument.\n\nThere was no argument there to discredit, that's why it's a 'straw man' doh :rolleyes:\n\nmrfreeze wrote:\n\nI can't believe Michelle would get pregnant without being in a long term relationship, I thought she was stronger than that.\n\nShe seems to be searching for a father figure, but that could be just my interpretation. Ledger seems like such a 'rat' I hope it does work out but I can see him cheating on her later on.\n\nNaomi had a lucky escape if you ask me, she can do better than him.\n\nI'm not jealous BTW\n\nsticki-vicki wrote:\n\nNothing wrong with having a baby and not being in a long term relationship, i was with my boyfriend 3 months when i fell pregnant. Was the best thing that happened to us!\n\nOH please, since when has getting knocked up after only being with someone a short time been an admirable quality?\n\nsticki-vicki wrote:\n\nNot admirable but it happens, just beacuse she fell pregnant doesn't make her stupid/weak/and less of a woman.\n\nThings happen and they all happen for a reason!"
