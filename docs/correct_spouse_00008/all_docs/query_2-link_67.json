        "text": "Heath Ledger’s daughter has a sibling after Michelle Williams gave birth to her second child.\n\nWilliams and director Thomas Kail have welcomed their first child together, who will be a sibling to 14-year-old Matilda Ledger.\n\nThe actress confirmed her baby news at the start of the year when her and Kail stepped out at the Golden Globes, with Williams’ growing baby bump on full display.\n\nWhen William took home a gong at the ceremony for her leading role in the series Fosse/Verdon — directed by her now rumoured husband Kail — she used her speech to advocate for freedom of choice.\n\n“I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose, to choose when to have my children and with whom,” Williams said.\n\nThe pair were first linked back in December 2019, but their short relationship has been marred with controversy as the timeline suggests the pair hooked up while they were both married or in a serious relationship with other people.\n\nWilliams called off her marriage to musician Phil Elverum shortly before news of her blossoming romance with Kail broke, while Kail called time on his 13-year relationship with actress Angela Christian, allegedly to be with Williams.\n\nJust months later the pair announced their engagement and Williams’ pregnancy.\n\nWilliams is notoriously private, but last year shared an update on Ledger’s daughter on what would have been the Perth actor’s 40th birthday.\n\n“Every morning we wake up and I wait to see if the transformation has happened and if it’s turned into the next level I keep hearing about, but we’re not there yet,” Williams confessed during an interview with the Live With Kelly and Ryan."
