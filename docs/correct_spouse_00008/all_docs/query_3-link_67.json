        "text": "Michelle Williams had never publicly discussed her split from Heath Ledger just months before his tragic death last month.\n\nBut before Heath died of an accidental drug overdose, Michelle had opened up a bit about the relationship in an interview with the British magazine Wonderland, which has just hit newsstands.\n\nMichelle, 27, has a 2-year-old daughter with Heath, whom she met and fell in love with while they were making “Brokeback Mountain” in 2005.\n\n“Obviously, so much has changed for me in the last few months that I don’t really have an idea of what my life is going to be,” she said.\n\n“I thought I knew certain things and it turned out that I didn’t, so I don’t really try and anticipate so much anymore. I’m not making any bets on the future.”\n\nShe and Ledger had left Los Angeles to live in Brooklyn, N.Y., where they continued to be a paparazzi target.\n\nThat cooled off once they split: “When you’re in a relationship with somebody who is also a public personality, then it doubles the attention from the media. When you minus that equation, it’s just less enticing.\n\n“That’s been a real bonus. It’s the plus side of the breakup for me. It was so pervading, it got bad there for a while. Every time I walk out of the door, I still worry.\n\n“That’s what is so silly about it: Even if the paparazzi aren’t there, you wonder if they are.”\n\nUnfortunately, since Ledger’s death, Michelle again has become a paparazzi target, with the photo-stalkers showing zero compassion for the grieving actress.\n\nClooney, De Niro urge talks\n\nWith the writers strike now settled, Oscar winners George Clooney, Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep have gone public in encouraging the Screen Actors Guild to start negotiating so actors won’t have to suffer a work stoppage as well.\n\nThe stars placed ads in the major industry trade papers Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, urging that talks begin as soon as possible with producers and studios. The actors contract is set to expire June 30.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of strike fatigue, and I think you actually start losing negotiating power,” Variety quotes Clooney as saying at last week’s Oscar nominees luncheon. “I would hope we in the Screen Actors Guild get back to the table.”\n\nFoster’s Oscars kept in bath\n\nIf you were to win an Academy Award, where would you put it? Certainly not with the bowling trophies, I hope! I’d probably make it the hood ornament on my car. Style magazine, in its new issue out today, asked some real Oscar winners where they put Mr. Oscar:\n\nJodie Foster: “I used to keep them in the bathroom because they looked good with the faucets. But when they started getting corroded on the bottom, I had to move them to a trophy case in my den.”\n\nJodie has two Best Actress Oscars to look after, which she won for “The Accused” and “The Silence of the Lambs.”\n\nJennifer Hudson, last year’s supporting actress winner for “Dreamgirls,” confessed: “For the last year, I’ve kept it in my empty new house – I had no time to decorate. But I finally got to shop this Christmas and bought a pedestal for it that I keep lit.”\n\nAl Pacino, a Best Actor winner for “Scent of a Woman,” said: “My Oscar’s in my home in New York. It’s like musical chairs trying to find it.”\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones, a supporting actress winner for “Chicago,” found an island for her Oscar gold: “He’s in our home in Bermuda. I figured that not many Oscars have lived there. Of course, everyone who visits wants a photograph with him.”\n\nFor more celebrity news, go to blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood."
