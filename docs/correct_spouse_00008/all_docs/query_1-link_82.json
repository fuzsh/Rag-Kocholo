        "text": "Actress Michelle Williams said her life has settled since the death of her former fiance, actor Heath Ledger, but his death has affected every facet of her life.\n\nIn an interview in the October 2011 issue of Vogue, the 31-year-old actress said experiencing the loss of Ledger has changed her daily interactions, career and how she acts as a parent and friend.\n\nShe said she now looks at life through a “lens” in which everything is “impermanent.”\n\nLedger, 28, died in January 2008 after an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. In addition to Williams, he left behind a five-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose Ledger.\n\n“It’s changed how I see the world and how I interact on a daily basis,” she said. “It’s changed the parent I am. It’s changed the friend I am. It’s changed the kind of work that I really want to do. It’s become the lens through which I see life — that it’s all permanent.\n\n“For a really long time, I couldn’t stop touching people’s faces. I was like, ‘Look at you! You move! You’re here!’ It all just seemed so fleeting, and I wanted to hold onto it.”\n\nWilliams plays another Hollywood star whose life was cut short, Marilyn Monroe, in the upcoming film, “My Week with Marilyn.”\n\nThe film follows a week of Monroe’s life in 1956 while she filmed the movie “The Prince and the Showgirl.”\n\nWilliams said she tried to gain weight for the role to have some of Monroe’s famous curves, but it all went to her face. She opted instead to fill herself out with padding.\n\nWilliams said playing Monroe was “like being reborn.”\n\n“As soon as I finished the script, I knew I wanted to do it, and then, I spent six months trying to talk myself out of it. But I always knew that I never really had a choice,” she said.\n\nThe October issue of Vogue hits newsstands on Sept. 20. “My Week with Marilyn” opens Nov. 4.\n\nWith Fox News"
