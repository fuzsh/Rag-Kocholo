I will occasionally enjoy a two-hour movie, but any longer and I'm waiting for them to wrap the story up so I can get on with my day.\n\nSo, I want you to tell me the film that you thought was wayyy longer than it needed to be, and WHY.\n\nMaybe you zoned out of Oppenheimer...\n\nPerhaps Funny People dragged on for too long...\n\nDid you struggle to sit through The Irishman?\n\nWhatever it might be, I want you to tell me which movie you think was way too long, and why. Pop it in the comments below and you could be featured in an upcoming BuzzFeed article!\n\nAdditional thumbnail credits: Fox / Nickelodeon / Syndication\n\nShare This Article"
