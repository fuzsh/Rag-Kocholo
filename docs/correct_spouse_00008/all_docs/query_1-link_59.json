        "text": "\"I think the interesting thing about Heath, which maybe people have only really fully discovered in his death, is how vulnerable he was...\n\n\"You can pick it up on it in his performances, but it's easy to overlook because he was so physical and beautiful and strong and masculine,\" she adds. \"But there was always that underlying sensitivity. That's who he was...\n\n\"For as long as I'd known him, he had bouts with insomnia,\" she says. \"He had too much energy. His mind was turning, turning turning -- always turning.\"\n\n• Naomi Watts: \"He was a huge, obsessive, chess freak - and very, very good at it.\"\n\n• Ellen DeGeneres: \"He didn't try to be something that he wasn't. And I appreciated that.\"\n\n• Phillip Seymour Hoffman: \"Whenever Heath talked about something he liked, he did it in the way that any fan would. He wasn't somebody trying to cover up his excitement about something, or someone.\""
