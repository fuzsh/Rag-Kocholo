You know, that's just something that doesn't…I mean, it just won't ever be right.\"\n\n\"I know a handful of women in similar positions [to me], it's kind of like a club,\" she said. \"It's a shitty club and we don't want any new members … and all the current members are exhausted. But man, oh man, it's lifesaving to have [them].\"\n\n\"Talk about a learning process. I think, God, what would I say about [dating]? I feel really sensitive about it and certainly did not expect to still be dating at 36 with an 11-year-old. This is not what I imagined,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm like a cat, I'm a very domestic creature. I just want to stay home and take care of people. But I'm also happy with myself and just because I might have a desire to be with someone…that won't lead me to marry the wrong person.\""
