        "text": "PAPA IN WAITING\n\nApril 19, 2005 -- IT looks like another Hollywood couple is having a baby. Heath Ledger has been telling friends that his girlfriend, Michelle Williams, is pregnant with their child. Williams has been snapped lately by photographers looking rounder than normal. The two met while filming Ang Lee's \"Brokeback Mountain\" soon after Ledger split with his ex, Naomi Watts, who is said to be bitter towards Ledger and his new relationship. Reps for Ledger and Williams didn't call back.\n\nhttp://www.nypost.com/gossip/42948.htm\n\nand another report our of Australia:\n\nHeath's girl bump\n\nFrom Sydney Confidential\n\nApril 01, 2005\n\nFrom:\n\nBaby gossip ... Heath Ledger turns 26 on Monday.\n\nHEATH Ledger's girlfriend Michelle Williams has been spotted attending specialist pre-natal yoga classes near the couple's Eastern Suburbs lovenest.\n\nThe 24-year-old, best known as bad-girl Jen in teen series Dawson's Creek, is reportedly regularly attending a weeknight yoga class which teaches poses and meditation techniques for women in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nWilliams, who has kept a low profile since arriving in Sydney with Ledger earlier this year, has been sporting loose-fitting clothing whenever she appears in public, fuelling speculation she could be expecting the couple's first child.\n\nSeveral readers have contacted Confidential with sightings of Williams at the pre-natal classes.\n\nShe has been in Australia since last year and spent Christmas with Ledger's family in Perth.\n\nLedger, who turns 26 on Monday and is currently filming Candy which also stars Geoffrey Rush and Abbie Cornish, began dating Williams in June last year after meeting her on the set of the Ang Lee-directed gay cowboy flick Brokeback Mountain.\n\nAt the time, Ledger had just come out of a two-year, on-again off-again relationship with actress Naomi Watts which finished because he was unwilling to settle down.\n\nReports at the time also said Watts, 11 years Ledger's senior, was keen to have children. Williams has previously dated scriptwriter Donal Ward and musician Andy Herod who devoted a whole album of songs to their relationship.\n\nhttp://entertainment.news.com.au/story/0,10221,12720342-7485,00.html?name=entertainment\n\nLabel Basher said:\n\nDoes anyone know if this has been confirmed yet? I don't really like Michelle.\n\nIf I was Naomi I'd be pissed. They broke up (well according to US Weekly etc) because he didn't want to settle down and have kids and now he's doing it with his new girlfriend. What a slap in the face.\n\ni dont know man, naomi can do better...he seems like such an ***...i was listening to a local radio station and one of the mtv vjs was on air and talking about the only person who he didnt like who has come through MTV studios was heath ledger because he was arrogent and unwilling to answer any questions...he seems like he is so boring..."
