        "text": "Heath loves to say f***, how do people feel about the use of swear words in TDK?\n\nhttp://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,20840783-10388,00.html\n\nWedding bells for Heath?\n\nFrom correspondents in Brooklyn\n\nNovember 29, 2006 09:00am\n\nHEATH Ledger and Michelle Williams are getting married, it has been claimed.\n\nThe Australian actor was allegedly spotted picking up a marriage licence with his 26-year-old actress fiance - who is the mother of his one-year-old daughter Matilda - in Brooklyn.\n\nThe pair met while they were filming gay cowboy film Brokeback Mountain and recently bought a townhouse together in the New York district.\n\nRepresentatives for the couple have refused to comment on wedding rumours. Heath - who will play The Joker in the next Batman movie The Dark Knight - has previously gushed about how grateful he is to have a family, saying Michelle and their child make him happier than being a movie star.\n\nHe said: \"I'm incredibly grateful to be a successful actor, and it kind of blows me away sometimes.\n\n\"But it's actually less about waking up and thinking how lucky I am to have this family, right now.\n\n\"That, for me, blows my mind. A billion times more that anything else. It's like, everything else? Who gives a f***?\n\nDeFett said:\n\nHeath loves to say f***, how do people feel about the use of swear words in TDK?\n\nI wouldn't mind if they cuss in TDK but then again I really don't care. It's not going to make a big difference in the film. Really it won't make ANY difference.\n\nHeath's Australian, profanity and bad language is alot more acceptable between friends and family in Australia. F**k is like saying damn.\n\nI'm pretty sure my mum would slap me if she heard me say that in place of \"damn\" though I sort of get where you're coming from, a lot of swear words do seem to have become sort of colloquial terms down here.\n\nI sure hope Joker doesn't use slang in Batman because to me he's a much more elevated form of bad guy. It'd be alright if say Joker's henchmen use it. But really now, any idiot can say the f-word. Joker is above that sort of thing. He doesn't say \"I'm gonna f*** you up\". He just f***s you up, while telling a rabi joke or something.\n\nEastwood said:\n\nno swearing i mean there is no need for it it is a batman film comeon\n\noh, come on. one of the best lines in Burton's Batman was \"I say, you're full of s**t, Knox. You can quote me on that.\"\n\nyou can't completely cut out the possibilty of swearing because Bats deals with some rough, scummy guys. those guys tend to swear."
