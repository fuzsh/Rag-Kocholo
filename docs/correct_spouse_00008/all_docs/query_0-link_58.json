        "text": "Michelle Williams has spoken for the first time about how she's coping with the death of her former partner and daughter's father, Heath Ledger. In an interview with Newsweek, the actress said: \"It's so sad. I guess it's always changing. What else can I say? I just wake up each day in a slightly different place—grief is like a moving river, so that's what I mean by 'it's always changing'.\" The actor died unexpectedly in January after accidentally overdosing on sleeping tablets. \"It's a strange thing to say because I'm at heart an optimistic person, but I would say in some ways it just gets worse. It's just that the more time that passes, the more you miss someone. In some ways it gets worse. That's what I would say,\" Michelle added. SOURCE: NEWSWEEK"
