        "text": "It wasn't easy for Michelle Williams to leave behind the home she shared with her ex, the late Heath Ledger.\n\n\"At that time, I was inconsolable,\" Williams told WSJ for its February issue, \"because I felt, 'How will he be able to find us?' \"\n\n\"This is where we lived, and he won't know where we are. And now I can't believe I thought that,\" she continued. \"Maybe that's what's making me cry is I feel sad for the person who thought he won't be able to locate [us].\"\n\nSee more: Michelle Williams Says Raising Daughter Matilda 'Won't Ever Be Right' Without Dad Heath Ledger\n\nLedger died in Jan. 2008 at the age of 28 after an accidental mixture of prescription drugs, four months after the couple -- who share daughter Matilda -- separated.\n\nWilliams even revealed why she hasn't married since the death of her ex, Ledger.\n\n\"I've not gotten married because I have not had a person to whom I would -- so I have not let my sense of conformity or duty override my instincts,\" she said. \"Sometimes [life as a single parent] can feel alienating; at school functions, there's only two of us single mothers. Everyone else has a partner, so we buddy up.\"\n\n\"It's hard to romanticize romance when you're 36. When you've been a parent for 11 years and you've done it alone, you don't have romantic ideals, because you have a practical understanding that you can do it by yourself,\" she continues. \"The romantic idea of meeting your person and having a storybook family life that looks like the model you grew up with -- that doesn't really exist for me.\"\n\nSee more: Michelle Williams Says Being a Working Mother is Exhausting\n\nWilliams added that her daughter, now 11, is in a \"good place.\"\n\n\"Everyone told me to travel while [Matilda's] young, but they hit a certain age, and they want a life,\" she said. \"So we're stuck -- in a good place. There's a lot of constancy. She's in such a good place that I don't worry about the stability of our unit when I have to go back to work.\""
