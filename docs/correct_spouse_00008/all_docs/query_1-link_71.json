        "text": "Michelle Williams has been doing the media rounds ahead of her new film, The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age film.\n\nThe five-time Oscar-nominated actress opened up about finding a balance between Hollywood and raising her three kids.\n\nThe notoriously private star has a 17-year-old daughter, Matilda, with her late partner Heath Ledger and also shares two kids with her husband Thomas Kail.\n\nAnd while the 42-year-old has shared some new insights into the parenthood/career juggle while promoting her film - we can't stop thinking about some golden parenting advice she shared back in 2018.\n\nWant to join the family? Sign up to our Kidspot newsletter for more stories like this.\n\nRELATED: MAFS bride’s brutal hot take\n\n\"Don't settle\"\n\nThe poignant advice came via a 2018 interview with Vanity Fair, where Williams opened up about her relationship with Ledger and how it influenced the love advice she passed down to her daughter.\n\nThe Blue Valentine actress was in a relationship with Heath Ledger from 2004 to 2007. The pair were engaged until they split just four months before his tragic death.\n\nMatilda was just a toddler at the time of her father's overdose.\n\n\"I always say to Matilda, 'Your dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes',\" Williams recounted to Vanity Fair.\n\nShe also said that the \"radical acceptance\" she felt from Ledger inspired her to keep going on her path of finding love.\n\n\"I never gave up on love,\" Williams told the publication.\n\nWhen speaking about her relationship with her then-husband Phil Elverum, Wiliams said, \"I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.\"\n\nAdding to this, she wanted to impart this little bit of wisdom on her daughter too: \"Don't settle. Don't settle for something that feels like a prison, or is hard, or hurts you.\n\n\"If it doesn’t feel like love, it's not love.\"\n\nRELATED: Kit Harington’s news for his son\n\n\"There's a hole in our life\"\n\nIt's not the first time Williams has opened up about Heath's death, as she once described his passing as leaving a \"hole\" that would never be filled.\n\n\"Very obviously for me and for [Matilda], there's a hole in our life,\" she said.\n\nOn the whole, she's historically been reluctant to speak about the grief she and her daughter were left with after Ledger's death.\n\nBut in recent years, her decision to open up more was in the hopes that it could help people struggling with grief and loss.\n\n\"I don't really want to talk about any of it,\" she said. \"But there’s that tease, that lure, that’s like, 'What if this helps somebody? What if somebody who has always journeyed in this way, who has struggled as much as I struggled, and looked as much as I looked, finds something that helps them?'\"\n\nWilliams met Ledger when they both starred in Brokeback Mountain and then she was thrust into the spotlight after his death."
