        "text": "Michelle Williams recently opened up about one of the hardships she faced after her longtime partner, Heath Ledger, died in 2008: Leaving the townhouse they once shared together in Brooklyn. In 2005, Ledger and Williams settled down in a Brooklyn townhouse with their daughter, Matilda. The family became regular fixtures in their neighborhood until Williams and Ledger separated in 2007. Ledger then moved out of the townhouse, but Williams and Matilda stayed. And just five months later, in January 2008, Ledger passed away from a drug overdose.\n\nIn a new interview with WSJ. Magazine, Williams says she stayed in the Brooklyn home she previously had shared with Ledger until 2012. And even four years after his death, saying goodbye to the townhouse proved extremely difficult. \"At that time, I was inconsolable, because I felt, 'How will he be able to find us?'\" she told the mag. \"This is where we lived, and he won’t know where we are.\"\n\nIt's not an uncommon reaction for a grieving partner to have. Matthew Goldfine, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, says it's totally normal for someone who lost a partner to not want to leave the home they shared together. One reason why: Homes can hold many memories of a partner, and leaving the home might feel like you're leaving those memories behind. \"Imagine losing someone and then having to basically give away all the photographs or videos of this person,\" Goldfine tells SELF. \"You’d feel devastated because you'd think, 'These are my memories, these things help keep this person’s memory alive in me.' And I think one’s house represents that in a very, very strong degree.\"\n\nGrieving partners can also feel like they're leaving their beloved behind if they move. \"You see that feeling of, 'I need to stay here. This is our house and me leaving means me leaving my partner or the person who has departed,'\" Goldfine says.\n\nWilliams told WSJ. Magazine that in retrospect, it's hard to remember that difficult detail of her grieving process. \"I can’t believe I thought that,\" she told the mag through tears. \"Maybe what’s making me cry is I feel sad for the person who thought he won’t be able to locate [us]. The past—you might be done with it, but it’s not done with you.\"\n\nGoldfine's advice to people grieving who find themselves in a similar situation: Take the time you need to decide if and when moving is right for you. \"This is part of how Michelle Williams was grieving, and I think it’s totally normal,\" he says. \"The only recommendation anyone could give is that you do what you feel is best. You move on to a new home whenever you feel that time is right. As long as you're still functioning well and your family is functioning well, whether you move tomorrow or 20 years from now it doesn't really matter.\"\n\nIt's important to remember, too, that everyone grieves differently. For Williams, leaving the house she shared with Ledger felt painful. But for other grieving partners, sometimes staying in a shared space can be tough. They might want to move out ASAP—and that's OK too. \"For other people, those memories and feelings are just painful, and they would rather not have them around,\" Goldfine says."
