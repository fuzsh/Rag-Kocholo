        "text": "Heath Ledger's daughter bears a striking resemblance to her father.\n\nMatilda, who was just two when her father died in 2008, has blossomed into the spitting image of Heath in the 15 years since his untimely death.\n\nNow 17, the student, whose mother is actress Michelle Williams, looks just like the 10 Things I Hate About You actor in recent photos, having inherited her dad's wavy, sandy-coloured hair and strong facial features.\n\nAnd it seems the uncanny resemblance doesn't stop there, as Heath's father Kim previously revealed Matilda is also carrying on his legacy with her personality.\n\n'She's got an enormous number of his mannerisms. She's very inquisitive, she's got his energy, because Heath never slept from when he was two and Matilda's like that,' Kim previously told The Project.\n\n'I mean, she's just got this ball of energy and she radiates this little aura. Heath was kind of like that. So it's fabulous really.'\n\nLast year, the star, who is currently living in New York with her mother, stepdad Thomas Kail and a two-year-old sibling expressed interest in travelling to Australia to meet her father's side of the family.\n\n'Michelle is extremely protective of Matilda and has tried so hard to shelter her from public life, but she has accepted Matilda's wishes,' an insider told Women's Day.\n\n'She knows how Heath died, and how much he loved her. Not to mention how much his family loves her and that she always has a home with them,' the source added.\n\nIn March 2012 (sic), an insider claimed Matilda had also recently sparked an interest in one of Heath's old hobbies: chess.\n\n'Heath was obsessed with chess, and now Matilda is getting quite good at it. She even has her dad's old chess board,' the source told New Idea.\n\n'Matilda has the skills to become a Grandmaster. Michelle [Williams] thinks this is a great thing and will prevent her from getting up to no good.'\n\nIn 2019, Michelle gave fans an update on her life raising Matilda as a single mother, on what would have been Heath's 40th birthday.\n\nAppearing on Live with Kelly and Ryan, the Dawson's Creek actress described her parenting experience as: 'So far, so good.'\n\nThe four-time Oscar-nominee admitted she was bracing herself for Matilda's teenage years, which can be a notoriously difficult time for any young person's life.\n\n'Every morning we wake up and I look to see if the transformation has happened and if it's turned into the next level that I keep hearing about, but so far, we're not there yet,' she said.\n\nMichelle was in a relationship with Heath from 2004 until late 2007. The couple welcomed Matilda, their only child, in October 2005.\n\nHeath died in a New York City apartment on January 22, 2008, after accidentally overdosing following months of physical and mental exhaustion.\n\nReportedly a drug user on and off for years, things came to a head when he was juggling too many films - including his last role The Dark Knight - on very little sleep and he started relying on various cocktails of prescriptions to shut his mind off.\n\n'I couldn't stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going,' he told the New York Times in an interview in November - just two months before he died at the age of 28.\n\nHe was found to have taken a lethal combination of six drugs: two types of narcotics, two types of anti-anxiety medicine and two types of sleep medicine.\n\nSource: Daily Mail.com"
