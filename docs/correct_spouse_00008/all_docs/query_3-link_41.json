        "text": "THE stars of Brokeback Mountain have revealed secrets as the film celebrates its 10th anniversary.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, who played Jack Twist in the film, told OUT magazine that there was a great chemistry between himself and his co-stars Heath Ledger (Ennis Del Mar), Michelle Williams (Alma) and Anne Hathaway (Lureen Twist).\n\nGyllenhaal would become godfather to Ledger and Williams’ daughter, Matilda, and go on to team up with Hathaway for Love and Other Drugs.\n\n“For the first month of shooting we all lived by this river in little trailers, and I had my dog there. We all just lived on a campground and would walk to set,” he said.\n\n“You know, in a world driven by commerce, particularly in the movie business, there’s no time spent together — relationships are fleeting. But in the old-school way, people really used to spend their time together. They became a family. And that’s what Ang Lee created on the movie.\n\n“It’s why we are all still close — not just bonded by the success of the film, but bonded by the experience. It was an intimate project in that way. We’d wake up and make breakfast for each other, and hang out. Heath and Michelle fell in love. It was a really special, special time,” he said.\n\nScreenwriter Diana Ossana said she saw the moment where Ledger and Williams fell in love.\n\n“The first day we filmed that scene where Michelle’s character is on the toboggan and falls off the sled, and Ennis is with her — they’re laughing; well on the third take, Michelle fell off the sled, and at the bottom of the hill she was crying. She’d twisted her knee, and we had to call someone to take her to the hospital. Heath was not about to let her go alone, and as he was getting into the vehicle with her he was smoothing her hair back,” she said. “I remember him looking at her, and she looking up at him with these wide eyes. She was almost startled by the attention he was giving her, but you could see it every day from there on. For him it was truly love at first sight. He was so taken with her.”\n\nOssana said Ledger wasn’t the first choice to play Ennis, Mark Wahlberg has said he turned down the role because he was “creeped out” by it, but as soon as she saw Ledger in Monster’s Ball she knew he was her Ennis.\n\n“We suggested Heath to the studio, but they didn’t really take it seriously, and then the actor who’d committed to playing Ennis backed out, and I called Heath’s agent and asked him to get Heath the script,” she recalls. “He read it on the way to Australia with Naomi [Watts] for Christmas, and said it was the most beautiful script he’d ever read.”\n\nOssana said that Williams wasn’t being considered by the role of Alma but she fought for her to get it.\n\n“Michelle [Williams] wasn’t even on the radar. I was the only one who put Michelle on my list, and that was because I’d seen her in Dawson’s Creek and remember thinking, What the heck is this young woman doing on this show? You could see the depths she had,” Ossana said.\n\nHathaway says she was asked to read for the part of Alma but wanted the role of Lureen. The Princess Diaries star said she knew when she watched Ledger act that he will one of a kind.\n\n“I remember getting to watch the shot of Heath walking across their front yard, which is really just dust and dirt more than anything else, and Heath had decided that at some point Ennis had been in an accident and had a limp,” she recalls. “It was so subtle, and it looked like he’d had this limp for about four years, and I just remember looking at Heath in that moment, and thinking, That is one of the greatest actors that has ever been.”\n\nHathaway, who has a gay brother, and Gyllenhaal, who godfathers are gay, said they had no qualms about signing on to the movie, despite many saying it would never work.\n\n“I remember sitting on set and looking at beautiful Heath, and Jake, and Michelle, and it hit me that we were all under 25. It’s funny how recent it was, but at the time we were very far away from this burgeoning humanist moment that we’re having now with gay rights,” Hathaway said. “It felt like a very big and important step — a statement about love, about the need for love, about the consequences of limiting people. And I was just so blown away that these four 25-year-old kids could bring this to life, especially the three of them.”"
