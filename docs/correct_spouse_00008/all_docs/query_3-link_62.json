        "text": "Michelle and Jeremy first met on the set of Baywatch in 1993 and secretly dated for two years. \"We messed around. She was, kind of like, my first crush, puppy dog love . . . (She was) my secret rendezvous girlfriend,\" the actor previously told Howard Stern. \"I was learning the ropes, man. If you want to make an omelette, you've got to break some eggs, right?\"\n\nMichelle and Heath fell in love after meeting on the set of Brokeback Mountain in 2004. They welcomed a daughter named Matilda in 2005, but they eventually split in 2007, one year before he tragically passed away.\n\nFollowing Heath's devastating death, Michelle struck up a romance with the director. The two worked together on the 2008 film Synecdoche, New York, and dated for a year before eventually going their separate ways in September 2009. \"The timing was impossible,\" Michelle confirmed in Vogue magazine. \"I thought falling in love again was the only thing that was going to save me from the pain — this erroneous idea. It just makes things more complicated.\" Michelle also admitted that dating as a single mother played a part in their split. \"I obviously don't know how to do it,\" she said.\n\nThe actress was rumored to have dated another director when she was spotted all cozied up to Cary during an NYC stroll back in June 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Michelle began dating Jason after they were introduced by her best friend, Busy Philipps. \"I've never seen her happier,\" Busy gushed to People about their relationship at the time. Sadly, their romance came to an end a year later, and distance was reportedly the reason for their split (Michelle was living in NYC at the time, while Jason was in LA).\n\nMichelle dated the contemporary artist for a year in 2013. The two kept their relationship pretty private for the most part, but eventually called it quits in May 2014.\n\nThe actress reportedly dated the author in 2015. \"They knew each other through mutual friends,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"I'm not surprised that Michelle is attracted to him. She loves books. She reads almost every day!\" It's still unclear when they broke up.\n\nMichelle and Andrew were first spotted out together in July 2017, and the two were reportedly engaged less than a year later. The pair never actually confirmed their engagement, but Michelle was spotted wearing a huge diamond ring on her left hand in January 2018. However, they eventually parted ways sometime that year.\n\nNot much is known about Michelle's relationship with the Mount Eerie singer, other than the fact that they're married! Michelle surprised everyone when she confirmed to Vanity Fair in July 2018 that she and Phil had tied the knot in a private ceremony in the Adirondack Mountains earlier in the month. \"Ultimately the way [Phil] loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole. I work to be free inside of the moment,\" Michelle gushed to the magazine. \"I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.\""
