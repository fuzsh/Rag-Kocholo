        "text": "Dad confirms Williams and Ledger split\n\nTHE father of Hollywood star Michelle Williams has confirmed that his daughter's relationship with Australian actor Heath Ledger is over - and explained why.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Daily Telegraph, US sharemarket guru Larry Williams said his heart went out to the young couple at this \"hugely difficult time of their lives''.\n\nWilliams, who is grounded in Australia - and based mainly in Sydney - while he faces alleged US tax evasion charges, said he had not spoken to Michelle directly about the split but had recently received a phone call from the actress's mother Carla informing him of the break-up.\n\n\"We've known about their troubles for a while but it's always a very difficult thing in life when these things happen,\" Williams said.\n\n\"I know Heath and Michelle still care about each other deeply and are very committed to being great parents to their daughter.''\n\nSpeaking from Tamania where he is currently holidaying, Williams blamed the demands and pressures of the Hollywood film industry for the demise of his daughter's three year relationship with her Brokeback Mountain co-star.\n\n\"You can never be stunned by what happens in Hollywood - I learned that when we were dealing with Michelle's career when she was younger,'' Williams said.\n\n\"Michelle was grown up at 16, and just like Heath, her life has had an extremely fast pace to it.\n\n\"But they are both very talented artists and they live with their hearts.\n\n\"I feel tremendously for her, and for him and hope they will find what they want in life.''\n\nAs his relationship with his famous daughter is distant, Williams is yet to meet his grand-daughter Matilda, who will turn two next month.\n\nThe 64-year-old also admitted to \"not knowing Heath very well at all'', despite expressing a high opinion of the Oscar nominated star.\n\n\"I have a great respect for Heath and I know he cares tremendously for Michelle,'' Williams said.\n\n\"I was never invited into their world and that's fine, but I care deeply for my daughter and if I can do anything to help her I will.''\n\nAccording to reports, Ledger and Michelle split amicably several weeks ago but reps for the couple have so far not commented on the separation."
