        "text": "Former \"Dawson's Creek\" star Michelle Williams has revealed in a new interview that she got married in Upstate New York.\n\nThe 37-year-old actress told Vanity Fair that she secretly wed indie rock musician Phil Elverum, 40, earlier this month in the Adirondacks. According to the magazine, just a handful of close friends and family attended the wedding, including Williams' 12-year-old daughter, Matilda, and Elverum's 3-year-old daughter, Agathe.\n\nThe four-time Oscar nominee says she has a \"very sacred and very special\" relationship with the Mount Eerie singer, who left Washington state to live with her and their daughters in Brooklyn.\n\nAccording to E! News, they both have tragic losses in common. Williams' partner Health Ledger, died in 2008 at age 28 when their daughter was just 2 years old; Elverum lost his wife, Genevieve Castree, to pancreatic cancer in 2016 when their daughter was an infant.\n\n\"I never gave up on love,\" Williams told Vanity Fair. \"I always say to Matilda, 'Your dad loved me before anybody thought I was talented, or pretty, or had nice clothes.' \"\n\n\"Obviously I've never once in my life talked about a relationship,\" she continued, \"but Phil isn't anyone else. And that's worth something. Ultimately the way he loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole. I work to be free inside of the moment. I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.\"\n\nWilliams, also known for roles in \"Blue Valentine,\" \"Brokeback Mountain,\" and \"Oz the Great and Powerful,\" next appears on the big screen in the Spider-Man spinoff film \"Venom.\" She's also set to star in a Janis Joplin biopic and return to TV for a FX series about Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon, starring opposite Sam Rockwell in her first lead role on the small screen since \"Dawson's Creek.\"\n\nLedger, who won a posthumous Oscar for his role as the Joker in 2008's \"The Dark Knight,\" died just over 10 years ago from an accidental overdose of prescription medications including painkillers, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills."
