        "text": "She was only two years old when her dad passed away\n\nNot only does Matilda have a very famous father, her mother is the equally accomplished actress Michelle Williams. Williams reached international prominence as a teenage actress in the hit 90s television show Dawson’s Creek and recently starred in Marvel’s Venom as Anne Weying.\n\nWilliams and Heath met in 2004 on the set of Brokeback Mountain. Though the couple split in 2007, they welcomed daughter Matilda into the world on October 28, 2005.\n\nFor Heath’s funeral and memorial service, Williams and Matilda flew to his hometown of Perth, Australia. This was in 2008 when she was only two years and three months old. As per Woman’s Day, Matilda has not returned to her late father’s home since.\n\nHer godparents are also Hollywood celebs\n\nBorn to stars like Williams and Heath, it’s unsurprising that there’s an additional famous face or two in Matilda’s life. In fact, her godparents are Heath’s Brokeback co-star and Hollywood A-lister Jake Gyllenhaal and actress Busy Philipps, who co-starred with Williams in Dawson’s Creek.\n\nShe became a sister in June 2020\n\nIn the years since Heath’s death, Williams has avoided intense media attention and publicity, keeping her and her daughters’ lives as private as possible.\n\nIn 2019, however, People reported that Williams was engaged to Thomas Kail, the director of the American musical Hamilton. The couple were also said to be expecting a child, which means that now more than a year later, Matilda is a big sister. True to form, not much is known of Williams’ second child.\n\nShe is apparently very much like her late dad\n\nIn a past interview on Australian talk show The Project, Matilda’s grandad and Heath’s father, racing car driver and mining engineer Kim Ledger, commented on the uncanny similarities between his granddaughter and late son.\n\n“She’s got an enormous number of his mannerisms. She’s very inquisitive, she’s got his energy,” Kim said. “I mean, she’s just got this ball of energy and she radiates this little aura. Heath was kind of like that. So it’s fabulous really.”\n\nA source close to the family also reportedly disclosed that Matilda has taken a keen interest in one of her late dad’s favourite hobbies – chess. “Heath was obsessed with chess, and now Matilda is getting quite good at it. She even has her dad’s old chess board,” the insider revealed to New Idea.\n\nShe plans to return to Australia to spend time with Heath Ledger’s family\n\nAccording to Woman’s Day, following her father’s death, Matilda was raised exclusively in the United States, with her Australian side of the family making the trek from Perth to New York for visits. These visits, however, have been hampered over the past two years by Covid-19 travel restrictions. It’s understandable then that Matilda would be eager to spend time with her dad’s side of the family.\n\nAs per Woman’s Day, a source close to Williams disclosed that the teenager is hoping to visit Perth in the near future to spend more time with Heath’s family, particularly her grandparents and aunt Kate: “It’s heartbreaking for the Ledgers, they’re missing so much. But Matilda is a strong-willed young thing, just like her dad, and she’s informed Michelle that she wants to go to Perth. Michelle is extremely protective of Matilda and has tried so hard to shelter her from public life, but she has accepted Matilda’s wishes.”\n\nIt is expected that when Matilda finally does return to Australia, she will be welcomed very warmly – and not just by her family. There has already been speculation that casting directors and television insiders will vie to get Matilda to feature in an episode of two of Home & Away, the Australian soap opera which gave Ledger his first big acting break."
