        "text": "Laurent Ferrier releases a new variant of its Grand Sport Tourbillon in a red gold case and bracelet with a gradient chocolate dial.\n\nPress Release details with commentary in italics.\n\nLaurent Ferrier Grand Sport Tourbillon\n\nThe Laurent Ferrier Grand Sport Tourbillon Red Gold retails for CHF 225,000(excl. tax). Limited Edition of 25 pieces.\n\nCommentary\n\nOverall, we are very impressed with this new watch from Laurent Ferrier. The new Tourbillon Grand Sport offers a bright gold case that less subtly reserves the real complication, the tourbillon for those who know to know. This novelty is not entirely new, as it first appeared in a stainless steel case, as we reviewed in detail here. Please read the review for the backstory of the watch. What is new is that it is now in a gorgeous red gold execution of the case and bracelet and a magnificent brown fumé style dial.\n\nThe 44mm case feels very nice on the wrist, especially as the heft of the gold making a huge difference. The design communicates a palpable sense of sportiness. Racy, and raring to go, but yet exudes the confidence and elegence of a thoroughbred race horse.\n\nAs with the steel version, the execution is faultless. The overall feel of the watch, especially on the wrist is one which is organic and smooth.\n\nRelease details\n\nThis autumn, to mark the 12th anniversary of the LAURENT FERRIER brand, the team is proud to present a new interpretation of the Grand Sport Tourbillon. This model, initially released in 2019, was inspired by the two founders’ shared love of motor racing. Its case is designed like a beautifully sleek car body, combining clean lines and generous curves with a high-performance engine: the LF619.01 tourbillon calibre with double balance spring.\n\nThis new version of the Grand Sport Tourbillon presents an integrated case and bracelet made entirely of 5N red gold, as well as a sublime dial in graduated shades of chocolate brown. An unchanging, timeless and precious metal, 5N red gold gives this timepiece a noble and sophisticated look. Previously launched in two all-steel versions, each in a limited edition of 12 timepieces, here the brand is offering a version that is even more luxurious than its two predecessors.\n\nThe highly exclusive Grand Sport Tourbillon Golden Brown is issued in a limited edition of just 24 timepieces.\n\nAN APPEALING COLOUR PALETTE\n\nThe graduated dial presents a range of luxurious and delectable chocolate tones, moving from lighter in the centre to darker at the edges. Featuring 5N red-gold appliques and white Super-LumiNova, the dial has an opaline finish that gives the piece a soft and discreet appearance characteristic of the brand’s creations. As on previous versions as well as on the latest Sport Auto, the famous drop-shaped hour-markers as well as the Assegai-shaped hands – a LF signature – both in 5N red gold in this instance, have been enlarged to accommodate the white Super-LumiNova.\n\nThe dial is protected by a domed sapphire crystal, which gives the whole timepiece a rounded appearance when viewed from the side.\n\nThe Case and Dial\n\nThe structure of the Grand Sport case evokes the elegant, timeless curves of racing cars similar to those that Laurent used to drive. Crafted from 5N red gold, the Grand Sport Tourbillon Golden Brown seeks to be more sophisticated and elegant than other more traditional sport-chic timepieces.\n\nThe Grand Sport Tourbillon Golden Brown weighs approximately 310 grammes and measures 44 mm in diameter, asserting a strong presence on the wrist. The unique design of its three-link 5N red-gold bracelet ensures a comfortable and secure fit.\n\nThe case of the Grand Sport Tourbillon consists mainly of satin-brushed components along with numerous mirror-polished parts. The cushion-shaped bezel, complete with a circular satin-brushed finish, features contrasting mirror-polished sides. Similarly, the middle-case, offering a new interpretation of the barrel shape, also plays with several finishes: vertical satin-brushed on the top, with a horizontal satin-brushed profile and contrasting mirror-polished sides. In line with the entire LAURENT FERRIER collection, the case components all come together seamlessly.\n\nThe bracelet is made up of three-link rows with a vertical satin-brushed finish, while the central links are bevelled with contrasting mirror polish. It is these details that give the bracelet-case pairing its vibrant appeal.\n\nThe movement\n\nIn 2010, LAURENT FERRIER won the Men’s Watch prize at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG) for its Classic Tourbillon. This watch was equipped with an ingenious manually wound movement complete with a tourbillon and a double balance spring. The new Grand Sport Tourbillon is driven by this exact same movement, although it has been given a more contemporary finish.\n\nThe carriage holding this double-balance-spring tourbillon, visible through the sapphire crystal case back, is worthy of the most high-performance automobile engines. The complex mechanics of the tourbillon movement pay tribute to centuries-old expertise.\n\nPatented by Abraham-Louis Breguet in 1801, the tourbillon countered the adverse effects of gravity on the regulating organ of a pocket watch when it was held upright. By equipping the balance with two reverse-assembled balance springs, the lateral displacement of the balance’s axis is also neutralised. Integrating these two systems combines their respective advantages for excellent accuracy and a power reserve of over 80 hours.\n\nChronometry lovers will appreciate the accuracy and superior performance of this timepiece, whose beauty is matched only by its precision.\n\nThe movement incorporates a long-blade ratchet system, which, in addition to its aesthetic value with its hand-worked curves, emits a gentle, reassuring sound when the watch is wound. LAURENT FERRIER has embellished the movement with a horizontal satin-brushed finish and ruthenium treatment, which reinforce the sporty style of this timepiece.\n\nThe tourbillon carriage bridge has been meticulously decorated by hand. The movement is also mirror-polished and has 30 hand-worked interior angles.\n\nLaurent Ferrier Grand Sport Tourbillon in Red Gold Specifications\n\nReference: LCF044.R5.B1RC1\n\nCase: 44mm diameter x 13.40mm height – 18k/750 5N red gold, brushed with polished accents – screw-down case middle, crown, bezel and caseback – sapphire crystal front and back – 100m water-resistance\n\nDial: gradient – chocolate-brown, opaline – red gold drop-shaped hour markers and Assegai hands with white Super-LumiNova – small seconds counter at 6 o’clock\n\nMovement: in-house, hand-wound tourbillon – 31.60mm x 5.57mm – 188 mechanical parts/23 jewels – 80h power reserve – 3Hz/21,600vph – Swiss lever escapement – hours, minutes, small seconds\n\nBracelet: integrated red gold three-link bracelet – folding clasp"
