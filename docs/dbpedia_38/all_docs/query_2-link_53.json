        "text": "Watchmakers: Exceptional Pieces of Horology in Rome\n\nTo open in Rome at MAXXI Museum, the exhibition Watchmakers – The Masters of Art Horology is a unique showcase, which presents watchmakers as contemporary artists specialized in the study of horology\n\n«It took us a year to realize this dream» Claudio Proietti revealed in an interview on phillipswatches.com. He is the owner of Maxima, an art gallery located in Rome, specialized in modern and contemporary art, mediating and curating some of the most prominent Italian art collections, now conceiving Watchmakers – The Masters of Art Horology, a very innovative exhibition dedicated to the independent world of horology, which will debut on April 6th at the Extra MAXXI, the National Museum of 21st Century Arts. «Art lovers will be able to discover a different but equally captivating way of making art. For me it is like putting on a show bringing together Picasso, as the greatest representative of 20th-century art, » continue the curator Proietti, who is a watch collector and a passionate supporter of the independents. The idea of this exclusive exhibition was born from his personal interest in watches: « it happened quite suddenly during a visit of Voutilainen's atelier. I said to myself \"I can't believe all these artists are capable of such amazing craftsmanship and so few buyers and collectors in the art world know about it”. So, on the very same day I told him I had this idea to bring watchmakers together for a special exhibition. Having Kari on board was really useful in order to reach out to other watchmakers, and so was the gentlemanly cooperation of my friend Daniel Roth. I was thrilled by the enthusiasm shown by Vianney Halter and the kindness shown by Roger Smith, who believed in the project to the point of allowing me to include the great George Daniels. »The exhibition will showcase unique masterpiece featuring innovative movements and scenic architectures from Hajime Asaoka, Christophe Claret, Ludovic Ballouard, De Bethune, Philippe Dufour, Laurent Ferrier, Romain Gauthier, Vianney Halter, Christian Klings, Jean Daniel Nicolas, Roger W. Smith and Kari Voutilainen. On display also the – Anniversary – the last piece made by the late George Daniels, who many consider to be the father of modern independent watchmaking, and who has directly influenced the work of so many of the men cited above. The project, which is in collaboration with Phillips in association with Bacs and Russo - the Leading Watch Auction House Dedicated to Highest Quality Timepieces- was conceived as a traveling event, debuting in Rome, and later presented in New York, Hong Kong and London.\n\nJean Daniel Nicolas\n\nKari Voutilainen\n\nLaurent Ferrier\n\nVianney Halter\n\n« I can't believe all these artists are capable of such amazing craftsmanship and so few buyers and collectors in the art world know about it »\n\nThe exhibition will showcase unique masterpiece featuring innovative movements and scenic architectures from Hajime Asaoka, Christophe Claret, Ludovic Ballouard, De Bethune, Philippe Dufour, Laurent Ferrier, Romain Gauthier, Vianney Halter, Christian Klings, Jean Daniel Nicolas, Roger W.
