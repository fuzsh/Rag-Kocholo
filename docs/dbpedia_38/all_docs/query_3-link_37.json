        "text": "Regular readers will know that I am quite a fan of independent watchmaking. Since starting my journey with watches, I’ve found it to be an incredibly interesting area, where boundaries are pushed further and creativity reigns supreme.\n\nThe results speak themselves: truly unique and rare watches which are often crafted by the same name as you find on the dial, often made in such small quantities that the likelihood of stumbling across two of the same watch at the same time are slim to none.\n\nThis book is one which caught my eye a while ago, because it is one which covers the work of 13 of the biggest names in independent watchmaking, including – amongst others – De Bethune, Philippe Dufour, George Daniels and Kari Voutilainen, as well two watchmakers I have had the pleasure of interviewing for this site in Ludovic Ballouard and Vianney Halter.\n\nIt seemed to be the perfect book for me to get stuck into over this Christmas break, and as expected it was one that I thoroughly enjoyed!\n\nWatchmakers – The Masters of Art Horology by Claudio Proietti\n\nThe first thing to say about this book is something that I didn’t realise initially, and that is that the book was put together to accompany a travelling exhibition from 2018, featuring the independent watchmakers listed, that started at the MAXXI Gallery in Rome, before travelling to New York, Hong Kong and London.\n\nThis exhibition was done in collaboration with Phillips, and there is an interview available on the Phillips website with Claudio Proietti, owner of the Maxima Art Gallery in Rome and curator of the exhibition.\n\nI just wish it was an exhibition that I knew about at the time, as I think it would have been incredible to visit!\n\nAnyway… “Watchmakers – The Masters of Art Horology” was put together as a 252-page coffee table book to accompany this travelling exhibition. The striking cover is the same as the exhibition poster from 2018 and features the work of Daniel Roth – the Tourbillon 2 Minutes of Jean Daniel Nicolas.\n\nProietti explains why he chose this piece in his acknowledgements, where he describes how Daniel Roth’s work as igniting his passion for handcrafted watchmaking.\n\nTestament to the level of independent watchmaking on display in both the exhibition and book is the volume of introductions, and who has written them, too, including the likes of Nicholas Foulkes (author of the only authorised biography of Patek Philippe), Su Jiaxian of SJX Watches, and auctioneer extraordinaire Aurel Bacs amongst many more.\n\nAs you might expect, the book comprises 13 main sections, one for each of the watchmakers featured.\n\nThe first couple of pages in each section is set aside firstly as an introduction to the watchmaker in question. There is a few paragraphs about the career of each, along with a pull quote from the watchmaker themselves which provides a bit of insight into the thinking and philosophy that goes into their work.\n\nThere is also a photo of the watchmaker, and in some cases of their workshop, so before the section goes into looking at their work you can start to get a bit of a sense about the person, and what it is that they do.\n\nI think this is an integral part of independent watchmaking as so often the pieces that are born of their hands are a real reflection of them as individuals – something which comes across in their work in the exact same way as you would see with any artist.\n\nEach section goes on to highlight some of the works of the watchmakers which, presumably, were part of the travelling exhibition that attendees would have been able to see on display.\n\nThe 13 watchmakers featured are: Hajime Asaoka, Ludovic Ballouard, Christophe Claret, George Daniels, De Bethune (Denis Flageollet), Philippe Dufour, Laurent Ferrier, Romain Gauthier, Vianney Halter, Christian Klings, Jean Daniel Nicolas (Daniel Roth), Roger Smith, and Kari Voutilainen.\n\nWithin each is a wonderful array of close-up photography, which allows the reader to get a sense of the detail and finishing of the watches, as well as some technical specs for the watches and the occasional extra quote from the watchmakers, thrown in for good measure.\n\nWith this in mind it is perhaps unsurprising that once you’ve read past the introductions, there isn’t a great deal more reading to do, save the various synopses of the watchmakers.\n\nHowever, what this does mean is that this makes for a great book to while away an afternoon, getting lost admiring the details some of the finest works of horological art, by some of the biggest names in independent watchmaking… even for those who don’t especially enjoy reading a great deal!\n\nI do think it is perhaps a little expensive at the recommended retail price of £60, primarily owing to the book’s relatively sparse text, however it is one I suspect can quite easily be found with a good discount online.\n\nAlthough, to be fair, it was written as an accompaniment to an exhibition; with the context of having attended the exhibition, I would imagine the book would carry a little more weight than it did for me coming in ‘cold’ in that respect!\n\nAvailable here (commission earned)\n\nIf you have any questions, please get in touch via our Contact page, or via our Instagram.\n\nDon’t forget to check out the Watch Books Page or Amazon Watch Books List for more recommendations!\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nIn Conversation with Ludovic Ballouard\n\nIn Conversation with Vianney Halter\n\nSpotlight: Laurent Ferrier\n\nWatch Stationery and Gift Ideas\n\nWatch Books, Watch Boxes and more at the Watch Affinity Shop on Amazon (commissions earned)\n\nAs an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases – thank you for your support"
