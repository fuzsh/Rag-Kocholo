        "text": "EDITOR'S REVIEW\n\nThe Laurent Ferrier Galet Boréal watch is a gentle evolution of the brand’s first collection, which was unveiled in 2010. Galet, the French term for pebble, has become inextricably linked to Laurent Ferrier, and the smooth, rounded edges that emulate the surface of a small stone remain in this incarnation. The dial is enhanced with varied tones and textures, with a vertical satin-brushed finish on the dial and Super-LumiNova detailing on the assegai-shaped hours and minutes hands, which brings the dial to life in the dark. This Laurent Ferrier watch is powerfully present on the wrist with its 41 x 41mm size, which is in-keeping with the aesthetic codes of the Maison. Powered by a self-winding FBN 229.01 calibre movement, the Galet Boréal is equipped with a unidirectional pawl-fitted micro-rotor, offering a plentiful three-day power reserve.\n\nREAD OUR ARTICLE: Get the glow with neon-bright SuperLumiNova"
