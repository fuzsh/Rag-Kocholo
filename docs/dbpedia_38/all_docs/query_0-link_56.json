        "text": "About Gérald Charles Genta\n\nGenta was born on May 1, 1931, in Geneva, Switzerland. With a Swiss mother and Italian father, Gérald Genta was always a designer at heart. He said that if he had been born in Italy he would have turned his designs into cars. He drove a Ferrari but as a Genevese, he felt destined to enter the great Swiss national calling of watchmaking.\n\nA prolific painter from his teenage years, Gérald Genta would produce at least one watch design every day, amounting to 100,000 timepieces throughout his career, many of which have now been lost or destroyed. Pablo Picasso was Genta’s absolute favorite artist and someone he looked to as a mentor, once refusing to answer a VIP client’s phone call because he was preoccupied admiring painting from the artist’s revered Blue Period.\n\nEach drawing would begin with a single circle drawn with Genta’s compass, to the exact size of the watch, and then developed with extremely fine pencils and paintbrushes. Testament to Genta’s profound understanding of watchmaking, when the final watches were released by the brands, they were identical to his original ‘scaled-to-size’ designs.\n\nAfter concluding his studies as a goldsmith and jeweler, in the early years, when the role of a watch designer was virtually non-existent, he would drive from Geneva to where the watch manufacturers were located in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle, and La Côte aux Fées, and pitch his designs for 10 Swiss francs apiece. He would return home when he’d earned 1,000 francs.\n\nHowever, it was at the young age of 23, that he made his breakthrough while working for Universal Genève, with his design for the SAS Polerouter, a watch which commemorated the polar flights of the Scandinavian airline and which became one of the brand’s greatest successes. From then on the Swiss watchmaking firms began to call upon the young designer themselves, and launched him on a path that would see him design for the likes of Omega, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe, IWC, Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Chaumet, Hamilton, Bulgari, Seiko, Timex and more. Gérald Genta’s career meant that he practically invented the concept of being a “Watch Designer”.\n\nHe created his own company in 1969 and developed his eponymous brand with his wife and business partner Evelyne Genta producing exceptional pieces for unique clients. Constantly creating and innovating, he combined new shapes and materials with major watchmaking complexities, and reimagined traditional mechanisms, such as the perpetual calendar, for the modern-day reminding the industry of the importance of fine watchmaking, at a time when the quartz crisis loomed large in the 1970s. After the sale of his company to an Asian corporation in 1999, Genta could fully dedicate himself to his life as an artist and designer. His vision lives on today in the 3,500 or so beautiful sketches, gouaches, and watercolor designs that survive in his family’s collection.\n\n“For me, watches are the antithesis of liberty. I am an artist, a painter, I hate having to adhere to the constraints of time. It irritates me.” —Gérald Genta\n\n“Gérald was always ahead of his time —it seemed only natural to continue his legacy of pushing boundaries in watchmaking, by reviving these revolutionary sketches with today’s most innovative artform: NFTs.”– Evelyne Genta, Wife and Business Partner of Gérald Genta\n\nIn 1970, Audemars Piguet approached Genta for a watch that would revolutionize the industry. The first luxury sports watch to be made of steel, this was the first time this material was elevated to the level of a precious metal in the watchmaking world. Genta designed The Royal Oak overnight, inspired by a childhood memory of seeing a man being sealed into an old-fashioned diving suit near the Mont Blanc bridge in Geneva. The revolutionary octagonal-shaped bezel mirrors the shape of a vintage diving helmet, with the eight hexagonal screws securing it to the watch as a helmet would attach to the diving suit.\n\n“First and foremost Gérald was an artist. Every morning, he would sit down at his desk in his suit to draw, full of ideas, and we would never know where the day, or his imagination, was going to take him. As a Swiss artist living in Geneva, he felt that he must apply his art to watchmaking, and that is exactly what he dedicated his life to.” —Evelyne Genta\n\nOver the next two years, Genta followed the watch through each stage of the manufacturing process before its launch in 1972. The watch retailed at CHF 3,740 Swiss Francs —approximately $4,000 USD— an astonishing figure for a watch made of steel at the time. Always one step ahead, Genta’s design was not widely appreciated at first, except by the Italian market, and it took three years until the sales began to rocket. Fifty years on, the watch is still in production today and classed among the best-sellers of all time.\n\nA few years later, in 1976, Genta was in the Drei Könige bar during the Basel Fair, and the CEO of Patek Philippe, Philippe Stern happened to walk in. Genta asked himself how he would design a steel sports watch for the brand. The story goes that Genta sketched the watch in just five minutes on a paper napkin when he was quietly observing the Patek Philippe team sitting in the opposite corner of the room. Not so long after, Genta was contacted by Patek Philippe to design a stainless steel luxury watch, for which of course, he already had the design.\n\nSimilar to the Royal Oak, the Nautilus too was inspired by the nautical world, but this time with the soft-angled bezel based on the portholes of the transatlantic ships. Mr. Stern was himself a keen yachtsman, and the blue dial is in the same color as the Swiss lakes where Stern would sail. The watch was named in tribute to Captain Nemo’s submarine in Jules Verne’s novel “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea”.\n\nSadly, Gérald Genta passed on August 17, 2011 at age 80."
