        "text": "Hajime Asaoka\n\nHajime Asaoka realized his first tourbillon in 2009, he's considered one of the leading watchmakers in Japan & Asia. He uses hand-crafted techniques & modern technology such as CAD/CAM, he's designed watches & manufactured movements, cases & dials.\n\n\"For me, ‘haute horlogerie’ is the only measure by which to express myself. I express myself by observing the principles of nature with my five senses, & I then realize what I have observed by designing & manufacturing in watchmaking\" --\n\nHajime Asaoka\n\nIncredible, precious timepieces\n\nA great watch does exactly what great art does – it touches the spirit\n\n13 watchmakers, 13 talented designers, 13 genius inventors: 13 artists!\n\nThey make every component of their creations by hand, innovating within the framework of a distinguished tradition. They're the custodians of a centuries-old culture, that of handcrafted\n\nhaute horlogerie\n\n.\n\nWatchmakers offer the fruit of thousands of hours spent at their workbenches, exceptional skills, great ideas, audacity, ambition and all the horological culture you need to create, slowly & with love, true art.\n\nModern art house, Maxima Gallery presents the first travelling art exhibition featuring the world’s leading independent watchmakers, hosted within prestigious art venues.\n\nRepresents a diversity of artists from Switzerland, France, Germany, United Kingdom and Finland as fine watchmaking springs from the mind rather than a geographical region\n\nA collection of masterful timepieces with impeccable design; pathological attention to detail; meticulous attention to choices of materials, colors, textures, finishes and shapes.\n\nIn 2009, Ballouard embarked on his greatest dream: to create his own watches. With collectors waiting impatiently, Ludovic created his first timepiece, the Upside Down watch. Today Ludovic Ballouard operates out of his workshop in the Genevan countryside. Watch enthusiasts worldwide await his next model.\n\n\"For me watchmaking is a marriage of factors, such as quality, creativity and true craftsmanship, along with rarity. It is the idea that the product is a part of the person who has created the piece, comparable to their DNA. You do not buy a timepiece solely for the sake of time presentation, you acquire a piece that makes you a part of someone’s universe.\" --\n\nLudovic Ballouard\n\nClaret learned his craft alongside Roger Dubuis, before opening his own vintage restoration workshop in the family home in France.\n\nIn 2009, he launched the DualTow, this is when the public at large finally discovered the talents of this exceptional watchmaker, already acclaimed by his peers.\n\nGeorge Daniels was perhaps the most unlikely man to become an outright master of horology. Brought up in abject poverty in London, and spending much of his childhood on the streets, he nevertheless showed early aptitude by taking apart and reconstructing the family’s only alarm clock.In 1968, Daniels created his first pocket-watch for a friend, Sam Clutton, who convinced him that his future lay in handcrafted high-end timepieces.\n\nPhilippe Dufour is one of the world’s finest watchmakers & a passionate ambassador for preserving & promoting the art & craft of\n\nhaute horlogerie\n\nfor the next generation of master watchmakers.\n\nThe first watch he designed the most demanding complication of them all, a grande et petite sonnerie with minute repeater pocket watch.\n\nAs the son and grandson of watchmakers, Laurent Ferrier, the emblematic figure of the brand that bears his name, is attached to the excellence of traditional watchmaking crafts.\n\nNowadays, Laurent Ferrier develops his own watches from conception to production. He is backed by his son, Christian, who carries the art of watchmaking to the fourth generation.\n\nDaniel Roth’s grandfather & great-grandfather were both watchmakers in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland.\n\nIn 2001, he created the Jean Daniel Nicolas two-minute tourbillon. The tourbillon is the only watch Roth makes today.\n\n\"Haute horlogerie’ is an art form, a requirement of the artisans who do not measure their time in order to perfect techniques based on the tradition of creating the most authentic watchmaking masterpieces. The embodiment of my passion for this craft is the rich heritage of the master watchmakers. Since I arrived in the Vallée de Joux, finding myself in this fascinating universe of incredible know-how has been like an electric shock.\" --\n\nJean Daniel Nicolas"
