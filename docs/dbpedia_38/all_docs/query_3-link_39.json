        "text": "History of Rolex Watches\n\nThe True Pursuit of Excellence\n\nRolex watches have a long-standing history of proven reliability under the most extreme conditions, including the deepest trenches in the ocean, the peaks of the world's tallest mountains, and on the wrists of racers competing on land, air, and sea. The entire planet has served as a living laboratory for some of the most durable and beautiful timepieces ever made.\n\nThe history of this wonderful company is just as interesting as the remarkable timepieces it makes. Large successful corporations often make meaningful contributions to society, but very few have ever made such a genuine, concerted effort to serve humanity to the degree that Hans Wilsdorf and Rolex have made in their 100+ year history.\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\n\"Our uncles were not indifferent to our fate; nevertheless, the way in which they made me become self-reliant very early in life made me acquire the habit of looking after my possessions and, looking back, I believe that it is to this that much of my success is due.\"\n\n\"I tried combining the letters of the alphabet in every possible way. This gave some hundred names, but none of them felt quite right. It was one morning when I was sitting on the upper level of a double-decker powered at that time by horses, driving along Cheapside in London, that a good genie whispered in my ear: \"Rolex.\" A few days after this fruitful journey, the Rolex brand was filed, and then officially registered in Switzerland by Wilsdorf & Davis.\"\n\n\"…pocket watches will almost completely disappear and wrist watches will replace them definitively. I am not mistaken in this opinion and you will see that I am right.\n\nThe innovative rotor allowed the mechanism to operate perpetually using only the energy created by the natural waving motion of the wearer's wrist. The mechanism itself has a semicircular-shaped oscillating weight that rotates bi-directionally and feeds a ratcheted winding mechanism, which in turn winds the spiral-shaped mainspring that powers the watch's gears, giving the watch a stable and \"perpetual\" source of power. Previous self-winding movements used rotors that oscillated just 200 degrees, but the new Rolex Perpetual was able to rotate a full 360 degrees which produced an efficiency never achieved before allowing the watch to run on its own for up to 35 hours at rest.\n\n“I have now been using my Rolex watch for a while, and it is keeping perfect time under somewhat strenuous conditions.”\n\nTHE INTREPID EXPLORER\n\nThe Oyster Perpetual Explorer featured the bubbleback, three-piece Ovettone case, a new dial with an inverted triangle at 12 o'clock, and gilt printed Rolex text and coronet. The Explorer also boasted luminous gilt numerals at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, and iconic \"Mercedes\" style Rolex hour and minute hands.\n\nTHE INCOMPARABLE DAYTONA\n\nTHE ROLEX DAY-DATE\n\nThe flagship Rolex model since 1956, the Day-Date, in all of its many variations, is still integral to the brand and its image today.\n\nTHE ROLEX MILGAUSS\n\nThe \"Mil\" in the name was short for the French word \"Mille,\" meaning a thousand and \"Gauss\" is the measurement for magnetic fields. The Milgauss was produced using new components that shielded the movements, including a soft-iron protective case that safeguarded the mechanism. The engineers at CERN called it \"the perfect magnetic shield”.\n\nTHE ROLEX SEA DWELLER\n\nGroundbreaking explorers and expeditions have always served as a major source of inspiration for new Rolex models and innovations, and the Sea Dweller was no different. In 1960, the experimental US Navy bathyscaphe Trieste, captained by Lieutenant Don Walsh and first mate Jacques Piccard, descended into a depression in the Mariana Trench called the Challenger Deep, the deepest place on the surface of the Earth. The Trieste dove to a depth of 10,916 meters (35,800 feet) below the surface of the Pacific with a prototype Rolex Deep Sea Special watch attached to the outside of the craft. The watch was completely unfazed by the trip and after the dive, Piccard messaged Rolex HQ “Happy to announce that your watch works as well at 11,000 metres as it does on the surface”.\n\nTHE GMT MASTER\n\nTHE GMT MASTER II\n\nPearlmaster\n\nYacht-Master\n\nYacht-Master II\n\nLaunched in 2007, the Yacht-Master II bore little resemblance to the standard Yacht Master model beyond its name and was one of the most expensive and mechanically complicated Rolex models ever produced. Initially available in solid 18k yellow gold (ref. 116688) or white gold and platinum (ref. 116689), the Yacht Master II was a true tool watch, albeit a very luxurious one. Designed to help boat skippers keep track of time during the complicated starting sequence of a regatta and to synchronize their boats’ movements with the race’s starting gun, the watch was powered by the caliber 4160 movement which offered a programmable timer with a 10-minute regatta countdown scale set using Rolex’s patented Ring Command bezel. A two-tone steel and Everose gold model, the ref. 116681, was released in 2011 and an all-steel version, the ref. 116680, followed in 2013 powered by the slightly updated caliber 4161 movement.\n\nSky-Dweller\n\nThe Sky Dweller was Rolex's first annual calendar watch with dual time zones. The time is exhibited by the center hands, and the date shows through the traditional aperture window with a cyclops magnifier at 3 o'clock. Small rectangular windows located outside of the Arabic hour markers indicate the month. A red arrow above a 24-hour disc indicates the second time zone.\n\nIn 2014, Rolex expanded the model line by adding more strap and dial options such as a black dial on the white gold Sky-Dweller and a rhodium dial combined with the Everose gold case.\n\nTHE INIMITABLE ROLEX CELLINI\n\nProduced for more than 15 years, there were three distinct generations of the asymmetric King Midas:\n\n● 1st Series: Ref. 9630 Produced from 1962-1972\n\n● 2nd Series: Ref. 3580 Produced 1972/3-1976 with roughly 500 examples made\n\n● 3rd Series: Ref. 4315 Produced 1977-1978/9\n\nLOOKING TO THE FUTURE\n\nIn 2019, Rolex launched a program called Perpetual Planet designed to continue Hans Wilsdorf’s legacy by supporting the explorers of today on a new mission: to make the planet perpetual. As part of the program, the company has partnered with the National Geographic Society to specifically focus on the impacts of climate change and they have also enhanced the brand’s long running support for biologist Sylvia Earle’s Mission Blue initiative for safeguarding the oceans. The final piece of this multi-pronged program is the Rolex Awards for Enterprise. Established in 1976, the program encourages the work of some of the world’s most inspiring individuals including 155 Laureates who have contributed to the fields of science, exploration, health, the environment and cultural heritage.\n\nLong after founder Hans Wilsdorf’s passing at the age of 79 in 1960, Rolex has continued to produce the world's finest watches and to further his legacy of humanitarian action that was established as a cornerstone of the brand. The world’s harshest environments continue to act as Rolex’s proving ground and their watches can still be found on the wrists of pioneers, artists, athletes and visionaries."
