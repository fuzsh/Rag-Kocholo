        "text": "By developing the identity of our point-of-sale corners, we wanted to highlight our values such as craftsmanship, the table and joinery are entirely handmade by a Swiss ebeniste - our history, the relief wall represents the VallÃ©e de Joux from the sky - and our vision, the evolution of tradition through the shape of the table, from bottom to top, from traditional to more modern. #RomainGauthier\n\nGrand Feu blue enamel dial, hand-made by Ana Gauthier ðŸŽ¨ Romain's wife Ana has been painting ceramics for more than 20 years, and she creates the enamel dials for our timepieces using the Grand Feu firing technique - between 780 and 840Â°C - on an 18k white gold dial base. Romain Gauthier dials are enamelled and counter-enamelled using the traditional brush-applied water-based enamel technique. #RomainGauthier #Enamel #Craftsmanship\n\nOn the C by Romain Gauthier Platinum Edition, the tapering, three-dimensional hands, numerals and index are made of 18k white gold. Each index and Roman numerals bring a more traditional feel to the design of the piece â€“ matte-treated and hand-finished with satin-finish that contrasts the overall aesthetics of the piece and harmonizes with the surface of the case. #RomainGauthier #CbyRomainGauthier\n\nFeaturing a platinum case and 18k white gold movement, C by Romain Gauthier Platinum Edition resonates with the most discerning collectors in the watchmaking world. Romain brings a touch of refinement to this timepiece with a sporty profile and assertive character, a combination of noble materials that reveals a traditional side to this very modern timepiece. #RomainGauthier #CbyRomainGauthier\n\nIntroducing the C by Romain Gauthier Titanium Edition Five, featuring an entirely hand-engraved textured dial. A limited edition that further highlights the hand-crafted decorative expertise of Manufacture Romain Gauthier âœ¨ Click on the following link to discover more: https://lnkd.in/eC9wnMmn #RomainGauthier #CbyRomainGauthier\n\nThe man behind the brand. Romain Gauthier, before being a brand, is a child of the VallÃ©e de Joux cradled by the world of watchmaking from an early age. His studies in precision mechanics led him to the manufacture of watch components, and then, like a revelation, he set himself the challenge of creating his own watch. The eponymous Romain Gauthier brand was born in 2005, and his first watch, the prestige HM, was unveiled in 2007. Today, 18 years later, Romain is proud to contribute to the preservation of the rich watchmaking heritage, while improving techniques and professions, exploring new horizons - The Evolution of Tradition. #RomainGauthier"
