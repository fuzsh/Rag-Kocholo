We treat email enquiries about List pictures in strict order of receipt. Please call if you would prefer to talk to us about anything you see on the website, but we strongly advise sending an email first; we are happy to hold works for a short time while they are being considered, or to give time to make a vist.\n\nImages: These are intended as an indication of the work – please telephone or email if you have any questions about the photograph’s relationship to the original. We are always happy to send further photos – frames, versos, inscriptions, something to give scale – so please do ask.\n\nPostage: Most works can be packed and posted, inland and abroad. Quotes can be sent.\n\nApproval Service: We are happy to send works on approval, but this is subject to discussion.\n\nJOIN THE MAILING LIST\n\nIf you would like to receive Email Alerts when ‘Lists’ of new stock and Exhibitions are published online, please Click Here.
