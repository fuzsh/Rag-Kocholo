        "text": "The history of the Carthusian Order is rich and complex. It is not possible to go into it in depth here. We will simply mention a few points of reference.\n\n1. The origins\n\nIn June 1084, Master Bruno and six companions were led by Hugh, bishop of Grenoble, to the Chartreuse desert to establish a hermitage. The Chartreuse valley is a secluded place where Bruno’s soul could rise freely towards God, whom he sought and desired above all things. Bruno had to abandon his beloved solitude to obey the Pope, but soon afterwards, in 1090, he founded a second monastery according to his ideal/project of purely contemplative life: Santa Maria della Torre, in Calabria. Bruno did not leave a written Rule. Nevertheless, inspired by his example and formed by experience, the first Carthusian monks passed on this flame to their successors.\n\nIn 1109 the community of Chartreuse elected Guigo, who was only 27 years old, as its fifth prior. This act of trust was not to be regretted, for under his leadership a period of remarkable fruitfulness began. The fervour and fidelity of the first community would soon have a real influence: from 1115, several communities asked to join the solitary way of life instituted by Bruno: Portes (Ain), Saint-Sulpice (Ain), Meyriat (Ain), Sylve-Bénite (Isère), Bouvante (Drôme), Saint-Hugon (Savoy). These communities urged Guigo to write down for them the customs observed at the Grande Chartreuse. At the insistence of the bishop St Hugh of Grenoble, Guigo drew up the ‘Customs of Chartreuse’. In 1127, he completed this work in which he simply described the customs of his monastery. This work, which constitutes a true monastic rule, was adopted by these and new communities, Les Écouges (Isère), Durbon (Hautes-Alpes), Sylve-Bénite (Isère), Bouvante (Drôme), Saint-Hugon (Savoy), and remained the basis of Carthusian legislation throughout the ages. Under the benevolent vigilance of St Hugh, Guigo organised the Carthusian antiphonary, and left some other writings of great value.\n\nIn 1132, the Chartreuse community was put to a severe test. A large avalanche destroyed the original monastery. Six monks were killed, a seventh was found 12 days later; he was conscious but died the same day. Faced with such a disaster, Guigo transferred the monastery to a safer location, the one it still occupies today, two kilometres further down the valley. By the time of his death in 1136, the Order had nine houses.\n\nThe first General Chapter took place in 1140 under the leadership of St Anthelm, the seventh prior of Chartreuse. This Chapter established the liturgical unity of the houses. Shortly afterwards, the nuns of Prébayon joined the nascent Order.\n\n2. The Middle Ages\n\nFrom 1155, under the Reverend Father Dom Basil, the General Chapter met every year, always at the Grande Chartreuse. The Order was now organically constituted. The prior of the Grande Chartreuse, elected only by the religious of this house, received the prerogatives of Minister General.\n\n1160, first charterhouse in Central Europe: Seitz (in present-day Slovenia).\n\n1162, first Nordic charterhouse in Denmark: Asserbo (Roskilde).\n\n1163, first of the 22 charterhouses in Spain: Scala Dei.\n\n1178, first of the 11 charterhouses in England: Witham.\n\nUnder the Reverend Father D. Jancelin, new liturgical guidelines were adopted and conventual Mass became daily. By the time of his death in 1233, there were already 47 charterhouses in Europe.\n\n1257, foundation of the charterhouse of Paris by King St Louis. In 1300, the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse caught fire for the first time, then again in 1320 and it was almost completely destroyed. In the following centuries, the monastery was seven more times the prey of fire. In 1334, a charterhouse was founded in Cologne, the birthplace of St Bruno, which was to have a remarkable influence for several centuries.\n\nThe Black Death that devastated Europe in 1347-49 claimed almost a thousand victims in the Order. In 1370, the charterhouse of Rome was founded. In 1371, there were 130 charterhouses in the Order.\n\nThe Great Schism of the West, which divided the Church between obedience to the Pope of Rome or to the Pope of Avignon from 1378, also divided the Carthusians: the houses of France and Spain came under the jurisdiction of the Pontiff of Avignon, while the other charterhouses remained attached to the Roman Pontiff. It was not until 1409 that the Schism came to an end, and the Order was able to regain its unity the following year thanks to the simultaneous resignation of the Generals of both obediences: D. Boniface Ferrier (brother of St Vincent Ferrier) and D. Stephen Maconi (disciple of St Catherine of Siena). The General Chapter then elected as their only General the prior of the charterhouse of Paris: John of Griffenberg, born in Sax.\n\nThe foundation of houses continued at a steady pace throughout the late Middle Ages, reaching as far as Sweden and Hungary. The Netherlands knew a great concentration of chartreuses.\n\n3. In the 16th-18th centuries\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the Order was at its peak. In 1513 the Order recovered the house in Calabria, which had become a Cistercian abbey and had fallen into disuse. When the Reverend Father François du Puy, who had begun the process of canonising St Bruno, died in 1521 the Order had almost 200 active charterhouses. But this prosperity was not to last. Following the Protestant Reformation and during the troubles of the Wars of Religion in the 16th century, 40 charterhouses were closed. More than 80 Carthusian monks shed their blood for the faith, among them the very first martyrs of the English Reformation, in 1535. Several charterhouses were burned: the Grande Chartreuse was sacked and burned in 1562 by the Calvinist troops of Baron des Adrets. Many precious manuscripts were lost, including the original scroll of the funeral titles of St Bruno.\n\nIn times of turmoil, civil wars or religious wars, the Carthusian monks were sometimes forced to settle inside the cities: the charterhouse of Molsheim is a good example. Peace treaties were followed by a period of relative numerical stability. The Order had houses from the Kingdom of Portugal to the Duchy of Lithuania (the charterhouse of Bereza, in present-day Belarus, was the furthest house).\n\nThe Grande Chartreuse suffered another devastating fire in 1676, the ninth and last one. The Reverend Father Dom Innocent Le Masson had the monastery rebuilt according to a new plan, as it still exists today. This was only possible thanks to donations from all over the world. It can be said that there is not a single stone that was not donated by one or the other community of the Order. At that time there were about 160 charterhouses in Europe, which explains the importance of the buildings of the present Grande Chartreuse. Hundreds of people had to be accommodated during the General Chapter, which brought together the priors of all the houses with their retinue every year. At that time, the Order reached the number of 2500 fathers, 1300 brothers and 70 nuns.\n\nThe Carthusian Order has always been very united. Only one independent branch existed in its history. The year 1785 saw the appearance of the Spanish National Congregation, the fruit of an ancient separatist spirit supported by the crown. But its existence was short-lived: it disappeared with the suppression of all the monasteries by the liberal government in 1835.\n\n4. The French Revolution\n\nIn the 18th century, the closure of the 24 houses in the Empire of Joseph II of Austria was a harbinger of the Revolution. The revolutionary turmoil that swept through Western Europe shortly afterwards reduced the Order to very little: only a few houses remained in 1805.\n\nThe dominant principles of the revolutionaries were individualism and the absolute sovereignty of a secular state. Any particular grouping became forbidden so that only isolated individuals remained in front of the State. The period can be summarised in a few dates:\n\nFebruary 1790: The Constituent Assembly refuses to recognise monastic vows, considering them to be life-long servitude. The law first opens the door to those who wants to leave the monastery but lets the religious free to follow their rule and keep the habit.\n\n12 July 1790: The Constituent Assembly votes the “Civil Constitution of the Clergy” and imposes the oath. The non-juring priests are persecuted. Several Carthusians are guillotined.\n\nAugust 1792: Religious congregations are suppressed; it is prohibited to wear a religious habit.\n\nOctober 1792: Deadline for the evacuation of the monasteries which become the property of the State with all their goods. All the French Carthusian monks are dispersed, some join the charterhouses in Switzerland or Italy.\n\n1794: All the imprisoned religious under 60 years of age are deported to Bordeaux, Saintes and Rochefort, where more often they die in squalor. There were some Carthusian monks among them.\n\nSeveral Carthusians led dangerous lives in hiding, among them Dom Ephrem Coutarel, the architect of the return to France when calm returned.\n\nGo to top! ↑\n\n5. From the Restoration to the middle of the 20th century\n\nA royal decree from Louis XVIII authorised the return of the monks. The Carthusians returned to the Grande Chartreuse on 8 July 1816. The same year, the surviving nuns resumed the Carthusian life at Beauregard (at Voiron, Isère). At the end of the century, which was a period of reconstruction, 27 houses have already been opened in Europe. Among them, the new charterhouse of Parkminster, in England, where the Carthusians were able to return for the first time after the Reformation.\n\nHowever, a new rise of anticlericalism was emerging. The law of 1901 against religious congregations led to the simultaneous closure of 10 French charterhouses. The community of the Grande Chartreuse was expelled militarily by the public authorities in 1903, and settled in the charterhouse of Farneta in Italy. The other Carthusians had to emigrate.\n\nThe years preceding the Second World War saw the slow resettlement of some houses. In France, three houses of monks and one of nuns. In June 1940, the Reverend Father Dom Ferdinand Vidal, faced with the imminence of Italy’s entry into the war, took advantage of the situation by demanding the return of the religious to France as political refugees. The community was able to resettle in the Grande Chartreuse and the Order could hold the General Chapter in the Mother house again.\n\n6. New horizons\n\nIn 1967 was elected the Reverend Father Dom André Poisson, whose task was to renew, with the help of all the members of the Order, the Carthusian Statutes following the Second Vatican Council and the new Code of Canon Law.\n\nAfter the war, a number of monasteries were reopened or built. In France, Portes was restored in 1971 and Notre-Dame was built in 1978 to receive the nuns of Beauregard. In Germany, Marienau was founded in 1964 to receive the monks of Hain. In Italy, Trinità was built in 1994 to receive the nuns of Riva. In Portugal, Évora was restored in 1960 but closed in 2019. In Spain, Benifaçà was restored in 1967.\n\nFrom the middle of the 20th century new horizons opened up for the Order, which began to spread outside Europe. First in the United States in 1950, then Brazil in 1984 and Argentina in 1998. The most recent foundations were in South Korea, one of monks, and one of nuns in 2002.\n\nFinally, we can mention the historic visit of Pope John Paul II to the charterhouse of Serra San Bruno in Calabria in 1984, on the occasion of the 9th centenary of the Order, his letter to the Carthusians for the 9th centenary of the death of St Bruno in 2001, and the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the same monastery in 2011.\n\nThe Carthusian Order has always been small in number compared to other monastic orders. However, it has endured through the centuries, with its share of troubles and profound transformations. The spirit of St Bruno is still alive, the mission of the Carthusians is still relevant, and the call of the desert continues to attract young vocations all over the world.\n\nFrequently asked questions about history\n\n7. The Carthusian Saints\n\nAs an old saying goes, “Cartusia sanctos facit, sed non patefacit”: “The charterhouse makes saints, but does not make them known.” In keeping with their vocation to the hidden life, the Carthusians do not have a postulator in Rome to request the canonisation of members of their Order. The only exception was in 1514 when the General Chapter asked Pope Leo X to canonise the founder. Most often the memory and cult of a Carthusian is the result of popular devotion. The first of all Carthusians to be raised to the altars was St Hugh of Lincoln, canonised in 1220 by popular acclamation and papal confirmation. The latest are Blessed Claudius and Lazarus, martyred with a group of other witnesses to the faith during the French Revolution, whose trial was promoted by the Diocese of La Rochelle in 1995. For this reason, the list below is not representative of the sanctity of the Carthusian Order throughout the ages, known only to God. Among them are several Carthusians who were known and admired because they became bishops, which is extremely rare. We present here briefly the Carthusian monks officially registered in the Roman martyrology.\n\nBlessed Lanuinus, monk\n\nBlessed Lanuinus the Norman joined the community of the hermitage of La Tour in Calabria, the second foundation of St Bruno, in 1091 or 1092. From then on, the charters were addressed to both him and Bruno, putting them on the same footing from an administrative point of view. Responsible for the temporal affairs of the community, he was elected Master of the hermitage after St Bruno’s death in 1101, despite strong opposition. From 1104, he was entrusted with missions by Pope Paschal II. In 1114, he added to the hermitage a coenobitic house, under the rule of St Benedict, for sick monks and where candidates for the eremitical life were to be trained. He died on 11 April 1116.\n\nBlessed Ayrald, monk and bishop\n\nAyrald was first a regular canon of the cathedral chapter of Grenoble and attested as dean of Saint Andrew in that church from 1102 to 1132. He entered the charterhouse of Portes under Bernard, the first prior of that house. Only a few years after his profession, he was forced to accept the bishopric of Maurienne, where he signed charters between 1135 and 1143. As far as his episcopal office allowed, he remained faithful to the observances of the Order and liked to return to the solitude of Portes for short periods. He died on 2 January 1146.\n\nBlessed John of Spain, monk\n\nBorn in Spain in 1124, Blessed John studied from 1136 in the cloister schools of Provence. In 1139, he took the monastic habit in a hermitage near Prébayon. But in 1141 he entered the charterhouse of Montrieux. Sacristan the following year and prior in 1148, he founded the charterhouse of Le Reposoir in 1151 and was its first prior. He gave the “Customs de Chartreuse” to the nuns of Prébayon and copied the Carthusian liturgical books for them, playing a central role in the affiliation of this monastery to the Carthusian Order. He died in office on 25 June 1160.\n\nSaint Anthelm, monk and bishop\n\nBorn around 1107 not far from Chambéry to the lordly family of Chignin, Anthelm was first provost of Geneva Cathedral and canon of Belley Cathedral. He entered the charterhouse of Portes in 1136 or 1137, and was called to the Grande Chartreuse. He made profession there and became procurator immediately afterwards, before becoming prior in 1139. He convened the first General Chapter in 1140, resigned in 1151 and was elected prior of Portes. Later he was elected bishop of Belley in 1163. He tried in vain to mediate between St Thomas Becket and King Henry II of England. He died on 26 June 1178.\n\nBlessed William of Fenoli, monk\n\nBorn in Garessio and initially a hermit, Blessed William of Fenoli, or Fenoglio, became a lay brother in the Piedmontese charterhouse of Casotto. A man of prayer and simplicity, he led a self-effacing life of service and fervent prayer. He died a hundred years old shortly before 1182. His reputation for holiness spread far and wide.\n\nBlessed Odo of Novara, monk\n\nBlessed Odo was born in Novara in 1140 and made profession at the charterhouse of Casotto. He was appointed first prior of the charterhouse of Jurklošter (Gyrio, Slovenia), but disputes with the bishop prompted him to go and ask Rome to accept his resignation. Passing through the abbey of Tagliacozzo, he was retained as chaplain and confessor by the abbess, a relative of the reigning Pope Clement III, and lived as a hermit outside the convent of the nuns. He was over 100 years of age when he died there on 14 January 1200. Several miracles occurred at his tomb and his cult remains very much alive in his diocese.\n\nSaint Hugh of Lincoln, monk and bishop\n\nHugh entered the Grande Chartreuse where he was procurator. Later, at the request of the King of England, he was commissioned by the Chapter General to confirm the Carthusian life into that kingdom. He was the third prior of the charterhouse of Witham. After twenty-five years of monastic life he was elected Bishop of Lincoln. His zeal and wisdom were combined with a manly courage in the face of the claims of the civil authorities. This earned him the title of “Hammer of the Kings”. He laid the foundations of the magnificent Lincoln Cathedral. He was able to visit the Grande Chartreuse shortly before his death in 1200.\n\nSaint Artold, monk and bishop\n\nArtold, of noble origin, is linked by a tradition that cannot be verified to the Sothonnod family. Born in 1101, he entered the charterhouse of Portes in 1120. In 1132 he founded the charterhouse of Arvières at the request of the Bishop of Geneva and became its first prior. He no longer exercised these functions at the time of the General Chapter of 1140, or at least he did not participate in it. He is attested as prior in 1155 and during his unfortunate intervention in the conflict between priesthood and empire in 1164. In 1188 he was elected bishop of Belley, an office he accepted only out of obedience, but his 87 years of age forced him to resign in 1190. He returned to Arvières, where he died on 6 October 1206 at the age of 104.\n\nSaint Stephen of Châtillon, monk and bishop\n\nStephen of Châtillon, born in 1155, entered the charterhouse of Portes, where he made his profession. In 1183 he was prior. After thirty-one years of Carthusian life, he was elected bishop of Die in 1207 and only accepted by formal order of the Pope and the Superior General of the Carthusians. He died in 1208 after a year as bishop and was canonised for the many miracles due to his intercession.\n\nBlessed Boniface of Savoy, novice monk and bishop\n\nThe eleventh child of Count Thomas I of Savoy and Marguerite de Faucigny, Boniface of Savoy was granted the lordships of Rossillon, Virieu, etc. He entered at the Grande Chartreuse, but left by order of his father before his profession to receive the bishopric of Belley and the priory of Nantua in 1234. In 1239, he also received the administration of the bishopric of Valence on the death of his brother William. Appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1241, he renounced his first two sees in 1242. He died at the castle of Sainte-Hélène in Savoy on 14 July 1270.\n\nBlessed Nicholas Albergati, monk, bishop and cardinal\n\nBorn in 1375 to an ancient Bolognese family of nobility dating back to the 10th century, Nicholas Albergati studied law. He entered the charterhouse of Bologna where he was prior at the age of 32. After twenty-two years of Carthusian life, Nicholas was elected bishop of Bologna against his will, then created cardinal. A diplomat of great talent in the service of the Pope, he re-established peace between France and England. At the Council of Basel he defended papal supremacy, and later presided over the Council of Ferrara. Known as the “Angel of Peace”, he was universally loved for his holiness and goodness. He died on 9 May 1443.\n\nSaints John Houghton, Augustine Webster and Robert Lawrence, monks and martyrs\n\nJohn Houghton, born in 1487, took the degree of bachelor in both Civil and Canon Law at Cambridge. Ordained priest in 1511, he entered the charterhouse of London in 1515. Sacristan in 1523, procurator in 1526, he became prior of Beauvale in 1531, and soon after of London, in the same year. On 29 May 1534, he refused to recognise the supremacy of the king over the Church in England and did not take the oath imposed. On 13 April 1535, he was arrested with Dom Robert Lawrence, prior of the charterhouse of Beauvale, and Dom Augustine Webster, prior of the charterhouse of Axholme. Tried on 29 April, they were executed on 4 May and eviscerated. Fifteen other Carthusian fathers and brothers were martyred in the following five years. They were beatified on 29 December 1886 and canonised on 25 October 1970.\n\nBlessed William Horn, monk and martyr\n\nBlessed William Horn, a professed lay brother of the charterhouse of London, was imprisoned in 1537 with nine other brothers and fathers. While his companions died in prison during the year, he survived for three years and was martyred on 4 August 1540, disembowelled.\n\nBlessed Claudius Béguinot and Lazarus Tiersot, monks and martyrs\n\nFathers Claudius Béguinot (born in Langres in 1736), from the charterhouse of Bourgfontaine, and Lazarus Tiersot (born in Semur-en-Auxois in 1739), from the charterhouse of Notre-Dame de Fontenay, gave their lives for the defence of the faith and the honour of the priesthood during the French Revolution. They died of misery, locked up on the pontoons of Rochefort, one on 16 July 1794 on board the prison ship ‘Deux-Associés’, the other on 10 August 1794 on board the ‘Washington’. They were beatified by John Paul II in 1995.\n\nOther Carthusian monks, about forty, were also martyred during the Revolution for having refused to take the constitutional oath. Among them Dom Pierre Brizard was drowned on the docks of Nantes; Dom André Jacquet, Dom Marcel Liottier, Dom Michel Poncet, Dom Étienne Ballet and Dom Anthelm Monier were guillotined in Lyons at the end of 1791. Also Pacôme Lassus, Carthusian monk of Montmerle, guillotined in Pontarlier on April 25, 1794.\n\nOther Carthusian monks, about forty, were also martyred during the Revolution for having refused to take the constitutional oath.

Also Pacôme Lassus, Carthusian monk of Montmerle, guillotined in Pontarlier on April 25, 1794.\n\nOther monks, without being canonised, have always enjoyed a reputation of sanctity within the Order, such as the Reverend Father Dom John Birelle (+1361), Dom Stephen Maconi (+1424) and Dom John Landsberg (+1539).\n\nFor the holy Carthusian Nuns, see their page on the website\n\n8. The charterhouses through the ages\n\nApproximately 310 charterhouses have existed over the centuries; some have been in operation for a very long time, others have had a short life, some have been revived several times, others are quite recent. The carthusian geography has always been modified by the vagaries of history and by particular initiatives. All the houses of the Order throughout the ages are described in a supplementary page.\n\nThe “Cartes of Chartreuse”\n\nLa Grande Chartreuse has a precious repository of old paintings representing several houses of the Order. At the end of the 17th century, when he was rebuilding the Mother House, Dom Innocent Le Masson had monumental paintings made of each of the houses existing at the time. The tradition continued until the 19th century. These paintings, known as “Cartes of Chartreuse” (“Charterhouse maps”), always in a bird’s eye view, are an exceptional testimony to the life and faith of the Carthusian monks, as well as shedding light on their particular architecture.\n\nSeventy-nine of these paintings have survived and were listed as historical monuments in 2001. They have undergone an ambitious restoration that has revealed their high historical and artistic value. We would like to thank all the patrons and public and private institutions that have collaborated in this restoration. This incomparable collection shows the impressive variety of Carthusian monasteries (styles), the variety of sites where they were built (deserts of rocks and forests, or near cities), and the variety of artists who made them (from the simple craftsman to the confirmed master). Finally, it is life in the Carthusian monastery that these maps illustrate, with a profusion of precious and sometimes tasty details, characters and scenes of daily life.\n\nOther paintings representing the former houses of the Order (originals from the old collection, copies, or others) can be found in various monasteries and museums, especially in Austria (the Klosterneuburg institution has thirty-five paintings, twenty-four of them lended to Gaming). In many cases, these paintings are the only evidence of the appearance of the vanished monasteries.\n\nGo to top! ↑\n\n1. Do the Carthusians follow the Rule of St Benedict?\n\nNo. the Carthusians follow their own Statutes. The first founders were not Benedictines; among them there were canons and diocesan priests. They led a new kind of monastic life, first recorded in the “Customs of Chartreuse”, to which over time were added the ordinances of the General Chapters, which gave the different collections of the Statutes. The Carthusian monks do not have an abbot. The superior of a Carthusian monastery is a simple prior, with nothing to distinguish him from the other monks, except his place in the church, the chapter and the refectory. For their liturgical offices, the Carthusians have taken the great tradition of the Western monks, as described in the Rule of Saint Benedict.\n\n2. What is the origin and meaning of the habit of the Carthusians?\n\nThe garments the Carthusian wears from the beginning consisted of a habit (now called robe) and a cowl (called scapular in other congregations). These two pieces of clothing have always been the traditional clothing of monks. The habit has hardly changed through the ages. In the early days of the Order, it was covered in winter with a pelisse, a kind of sheepskin coat. The hood attached to the cowl has always had a sense of interiority; it also limits one’s view. “The cuculla (cowl) was the most essential of the garments, the sign of the profession. […] The word ‘cuculla’ has been passed unchanged in various languages: from the Coptic of the monks of Egypt to Greek, then to Latin, and finally to French. The Carthusian monks are the only ones who still keep intact today this word which dates back at least 1800 years and which has lost a syllable among the sons of Saint Benedict (cowl)”. Dom Maurice Laporte, Aux sources de la vie cartusienne, Vol. 6, p. 459; 465. (Note: The English-speaking Carthusians have not kept the word ‘cuculla’ and use the diminutive ‘cowl’.) Unlike the habit, the shape and size of the cowl have changed a lot over the centuries. Among the Benedictines, it has given rise to two forms: the cowl, which is a choir garment, and the scapular, which is narrower and used for work. To prevent the scapular from hampering the work, its front and back sides were often connected by stitches. The Carthusian cowl derives more from the scapular because of its shape and of the short bands that originally served only to connect the two sides. Over time, the cowl which was about one metre wide narrowed to 60 cm and the bands were lengthened by the same amount or even more, giving the Carthusian cowl the characteristic appearance that we know today. Some people wanted to see it as the symbol of the cross, but this is a personal and late interpretation that is by no means widespread among the Carthusian monks.\n\n3. Does the colour white have any special significance?\n\nLike the Cistercians, the Carthusians chose to use raw wool in its natural colour. There is no meaning attached to this colour; its raison d’être is simplicity and poverty.\n\n4. Has any Carthusian monk ever become bishop?\n\nYes, for instance, Saint Hugh of Lincoln, Saint Artold (bishop of Belley), Saint Stephen of Die, Blessed Nicholas Albergati (bishop and cardinal). The successor of Saint Hugh of Grenoble was also a Carthusian, as St Hugh had wished. This list is not exhaustive. However, it must be recognised that these are exceptions and it is hardly in the spirit of the Order for a monk to become a bishop, but we are not always asked for our opinion!\n\n5. Has it ever happened in the history of the Church that a Carthusian monk became Pope?\n\nNo, never. But in the middle of the 14th century the Reverend Father Dom Jean Birelle, prior of the Grande Chartreuse, came near being elected pope. In the remoteness of his cell he played a role in the Church and even in the society of his time. On the death of Clement VI in 1352, most of the college of cardinals was determined to vote for him. But Cardinal Talleyrand de Périgord, knowing that he was a man of rigorous justice and unfailing fairness, had undoubtedly some human view and instilled into the cardinals the fear of giving themselves a strict master. Later he regretted it: “Woe to us,” he said, “for not having chosen such a shepherd; woe to me who gave this advice!”.\n\n6. In that case, how could he have observed the Carthusian Statutes?\n\nJust as for a religious appointed bishop, he would be relieved of all observances incompatible with his state, and it would be up to his own conscience to judge what he could still do. For instance, see the life of Saint Hugh of Lincoln.\n\n7. Despite his choice for cloistered life, is it possible for a Carthusian monk to be appointed parish priest, bishop or even pope for any particular reason?\n\nA Carthusian monk cannot be appointed parish priest because the Carthusian Order is an exempt Order, that is, it is not under the authority of the diocesan bishop but depends directly from Rome. A bishop, therefore, cannot ask a Carthusian monk to be a Parish Priest since it would be contrary to his vocation. On the other hand, since bishops are appointed by the Pope, the Pope could very well, in theory, ask a Carthusian to be a bishop and this has been done several times in the past. Today such a choice seems highly unlikely because a Carthusian would be ill-prepared to face the difficulties of pastoral work in the modern world. In theory, the cardinals who elect the Pope can elect any baptised person, but it is even more unlikely that they would ever choose a Carthusian.\n\n8. Is it possible for a Carthusian monk to be sent out of his house to exercise a priestly ministry among the faithful?\n\nNo, it is impossible because it would be directly contrary to our vocation. The only exceptions are Carthusian monks appointed as bishops. The Statutes say: “Since our Order is totally dedicated to contemplation, it is our duty to maintain its separation from the world with the utmost fidelity. Hence, no matter how urgent may be the needs of the active apostolate, we are exempt from all pastoral ministry, so that we may fulfil our proper function in the Mystical Body of Christ.” (Statutes 3.9). Elsewhere we read: “We exhort priors to show themselves reluctant in the matter of confessions of people that do not belong to our Order; indeed, unless necessity demands, they are not to admit such confessions at all, since their admission is completely opposed to the nature of our profession”. If confessions at the monastery are considered to be a ministry incompatible with our vocation, all the more any ministry outside the monastery.\n\n9. What is the etymology of the word “Chartreuse”?\n\nThe term “Chartreuse” predated the settlement of Saint Bruno and his companions in the valley of the same name and, in its original form as “Cha(r)troussa”, it referred to the neighbouring village. The term seems to derive from the words designating a “ploughed meadow”. This Franco-Provençal word was then phonetically transposed into Latin to give the word “Cartusia”, on which was formed “cartusienses”, designating the Carthusian monks. More precisely: the etymology of the word “chartreuse” is still the subject of research and debate; the difficulty of this question stems partly from the fact that, unlike many other words in our language, it is not derived from Latin, but was probably transcribed into Latin from a source in the local language (Franco-Provençal Dauphinois). The place in which Saint Bruno and his companions founded their first monastery was known as “Chatrousse”, which may have meant one or several cabins or cottages (in Grenoble patois, Chatroussa still referred to the village of Saint-Pierre de Chartreuse in the 16th century). According to a first interpretation, this term transposes into the language of the Dauphiné the words “Catorissium” or “Caturissium” (we also find the terms “Catourisa” in the 7th century, and “Catuserias” in the 10th century, to designate this same place), which are probably of Gallic origin (a people from the Cottian Alps was called the Caturiges – from the Gallic catu, “combat”, and riges, plural of rix, “king”). However, the evolution from Caturiges to Chatroussa does not conform to the usual laws of phonetics, which makes this filiation doubtful. Another interpretation allows us to read in Chatroussa the contraction of two terms meaning “ploughed meadow” (calma trossa), and which can be found in the designations of neighbouring places such as Chamechaude and Charme-en-Som: such an origin therefore appears plausible, although its veracity cannot be asserted with certainty. The Latin word “Cartusia” is an approximate phonetic transposition of “Chatroussa”: thus, the disciples of Saint Bruno became Cartusienses because they lived near the village of Chatroussa. The French Chartreuse form can be seen as a compromise between the Dauphiné Chartroussa form and the learned Cartusia form. The Spanish (Cartuja), English (Charterhouse) and German (Kartause) forms were also phonetically modelled on the French word."
