        "text": "A History of F. P. Journe\n\nFrancois-Paul Journe was born in Marseille on March 22, 1957. He entered the watch making school at 14, accepting his path and profession without ever wavering. Like the lives of many of the earliest Swiss watch making pioneers, Journe's artistic and technological calling came early. In 1976 he graduated from the Ecole d'Horlogerie de Paris with a watchmaker's diploma. His first project was initiating the creation of his own tourbillon pocket watch, the only way he could afford to have one. Journe learned a step-by-step process from books by the great contemporary watchmaker George Daniels, who displayed the direct link of horology to art rather than just function. Watchmaking and especially The Art of Breguet directed Journe on his own workbench. In 1977, Francois began his eight-year apprenticeship working in his uncle Michael Journe's antique watch restoration and conservation workshop in Paris, which ultimately led to a partnership. He learned his trade working on high-grade, nineteenth-century watches, and in 1979, at the age of 22, Francois-Paul was commissioned by the Ateliers P-G Brun in Paris, to design a planetarium mechanism for Asprey in London. It was made of white and yellow gold, rubies, and diamonds, with 12 lapis-lazuli sides ornamented with the signs of the zodiac. The planets of the solar system revolved around the sun on a synchronized pendulum that supported and powered a complex wheel train.\n\nIn 1982, after five years of work, Journe finished his first gold and silver tourbillon chronometer pocket watch, as well as an extremely complicated skeleton perpetual clock. Journe began taking commissions full time in 1985, establishing his first workshop in Paris on the rude de Verneuil when his uncle retired. In 1986 Journe produced an automatic chronometer pocket-watch with fusee and chain that housed a five-second remontoir, a detent escapement, and a rock crystal dial displaying a retrograde perpetual calendar mechanism with the equation of time. This was Journe's homage to Abraham-Louis Breguet's watch creation for Marie-Antoinette. In 1987 Journe created a planetary pocket-watch, his sixth timepiece, commissioned by a scientific objects collector; he also received a prize and became a laureate of the Fondation de la Vocation Bleustein-Blanchet, which is only awarded to thirty artisans each year. In 1988 he made three examples of his \"pendule Sympathique\" clock for Asprey's of London. Abraham-Louis Breguet, who invented the first Sympathique, again inspired Journe, although Journe's was a more complex design enhanced with an exquisite modern movement. In 1989 Journe won the Balancier d'Or prize at the Madrid watchmaker's convention.\n\nIn 1992 Journe created his first wristwatch using the novel remontoir system he invented in 1982 for a pocket-watch. The remontoire is a second, small source of power from a weight or spring that runs the caliber mechanism, which is rewound by the mainspring. This became the prototype for his \"Tourbillon Souverain,\" with the gear trains and movement components crafted out of 18K gold. The Musee de l'Homme et du Temps honored Journe with the Gaia Watchmaker of the Year award in 1994, and in Geneva in 1996, Journe formed TIM SA, an organization designed to develop unique calibers in what he called \"Haute Horologie.\" To wind up the century and the millennium, in 1999 the Tourbillon Sourverain and a collection of chronometers – Invenit et Fecit (created and made) – were launched with the F.P. Journe label at the AHCI booth in the Basel Show, meeting tremendous success and acclaim. Invenit et Fecit became the official motto for Journe's company.\n\nThe Twenty-First Century\n\nTo celebrate the new millennium, Journe debuted the \"Sonnerie Souveraine,\" to the marketplace at the Basel show in his own booth under the company name, Montres F.P. Journe in 2000. The Sonnerie was an innovative, complex design with a retrograde minute display and a section of the dial that revealed part of the mechanism. He also debuted the first resonance wristwatch that became the \"Chronometre a Resonance.\" This allowed the balance wheel in the movement to vibrate at a much higher frequency. Also in 2000, the workshops of F.P. Journe were established in the center of Geneva's Plainpalais artist district. The little manufacture now hand built 3 to 4 watches per day, or about 900 per year. In 2001, Francois-Paul's son, Maxime, was born, as was the first automatic movement caliber from the Octa collection that guaranteed five days of precision timekeeping when unworn. The large, 120-hour power reserve promised to support new complications in the future. In addition, FP Journe began an association with Harry Winston Jewelers, designing eighteen exceptional, unique watches called the Opus One collection.\n\nIn 2002, Francois-Paul started the Montres Journe SA antique clock collection by acquiring the resonance regulator made by French horologic genius Antide Janvier in 1780. This clock actually inspired Journe's Chronomètre à résonance, and was one of the world's first timepieces experimenting with high frequency resonance. The first private exhibition for supreme retailers was held at the Montres Journe headquarters in Geneva, with tours of the workshops on the first floor. Of the fifty companies with the ability to sell Journe's watches, he was now represented by 34, finding it unnecessary to exhibit with other watchmakers. Journe also received the special jury award of the \"Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve\" for the Octa Calendrier watch. 2003 saw the opening of the first showroom boutique in Tokyo – the Montres Journe Japon KK – in the Collezione building of the Omotesando district near the Nezu Museum. In a building designed by renowned architect, Tadao Ando, it included a watchmaking library, a lounge, and a bar where watch aficionados gathered to discuss their favorite subject or purchase one of a few hundred chronometers produced for Japan every year. Francois-Paul Journe contributed to his own two-floor store by designing the railings, overhead passage, and the interior staircase. Also in 2003, the automatic winding Octa Lune, with its five-day power reserve, received the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve for Best men's watch. To Journe's delight, the Chronomètre à résonance also won the Watch of the Year Jury Award in Japan.\n\nOnce again at the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve in 2004, Journe was honored with the ultimate, coveted award, \"L'Aiguille d'Or,\" the Golden Hand, for his Tourbillon Souverain, which was also presented the Watch of the Year grand prize in Japan. At the 2005 Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve, the Chronometer Souverain won the Favorite Men's Watch award. That same year, Montres Journe began producing all their movement components in house out of 18K red gold. In 2006, the French Minister of Culture bestowed upon Francois-Paul Journe the title of the \"Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.\" He also won his second \"Aiguille d'Oro (Golden Hand) ultimate award for hisSonnerie Souveraine. The showroom boutique in the historical center of Hong Kong opened on October 3rd in the Princess Building. Moreover, in Tokyo the Watch of the Year award also went to the Sonnerie Souveraine. In 2007 the new showroom boutique opened on Place Longemalle in the center of Geneva on April 17th; on December 4thanother exquisite store opened in Boca Raton, Florida. The new Exhibition Space of the Manufacture held the Exhibition Steel Time from October 15th to December 21st.\n\nIn 2008 the ultra slim, and many claim breathtaking minute repeater, debuted at the annual salon in the Exhibition room from April 7 to 12. In Los Relojes Del Ano 2008, theRepetition Minute Souveraine – equally breathtaking – was named the Watch of the Year in the Grand Complication category. Journe again received the \"Aiguille d'Or\" at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix for the Centigraphe Souverain, and the boutique opened in Paris in December with the customary little sign, F.P. Journe - Invenit et Fecit. In 2009 the slim Minute Repeater won the \"Best Technique Innovation Watch\" at the Champions of Time competition in China. The Centigraphe Souverain was awarded the \"Watch of the Year\" for 2008 on Timezone.com. Elegant F.P. Journe boutiques debuted in New York and Pekin in November. F.P. Journe was now a world renowned watchmaker and retailer. In 2010, revisiting The Champions of Time in China, Journe once again was given the \"Best Technical Innovation\" award for his complicated Vagabondage II. For an unprecedented seventh time, the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve gave him the Grand Complication Prize for the incredibleChronomètre à résonance. The Octa UTC was presented at the January 2011 exhibition at the Manufacture, and Francois-Paul held a world premier for his entirely aluminum (mechanism, case, and bracelet) Centigraphe Sport, the first watch of his newLinesport collection. Number 001 sold at Christie's for ten times its original price, with the proceeds going to the victims of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The Espace F.P. Journe boutique opened in Buenos Aires, Argentina on December 5th with their partner, Simonetta Orsini.\n\nThe great, historical steel time exhibit was held at the Forbes Galleries in New York from April 15th to September 15th, 2012. This included F.P. Journe's collection of 250 burnished steel watches produced between 1850 and 1910. The all aluminum Octa Sport debuted, the second offering from the Linesport models. F.P. Journe entered a partnership with Jean Alesi and Lotus to compete in the Indianapolis 500 on May 27th, and in homage to the driver Alesi, brought out an Indy 500 edition of 99 examples. TheChronometre Optimum was presented in the international Journe boutiques. In 2013, at the annual exhibition in January, the new Quantieme Perpetuel was launched, and for popular culture exposure, an F.P. Journe watch appeared on the wrist of Academy Award winner Jean Dujardin in the new film Mobius."
