        "text": "The Classic Origin Opaline is Laurent Ferrier with maximal restraint and refinement. This is a manual, time-only three hand watch that distills Ferrier's sense of proportion and finishing. For the brand's tenth anniversary, Laurent Ferrier decided to update the design language, create a pebble-like, more sporting titanium case, and do without the tourbillon. The Classic Origin Opaline was born, and it's been widely acclaimed since release as an understated, superbly finished, independent time-only.\n\nThe heart of the design is its calibre, the manual 116.01. It is a 150-component Swiss lever with Breguet overcoil. The exposed reveal at the very top of the calibre is Ferrier's famed long-blade ratchet system which creates a remarkably distinct winding tactility and sound. You can view it articulating as you wind the mainspring. The contemporary and classical mix in the finishing, with microblasted black rhodium bridges, fine hand bevels, grained gearing, and countersunk mirrored screws.\n\nThe dial underscores that elegance with elongated, razor-thin white gold indices to match the Assegai-shaped handset. The dial has a very fine grained texture that only reveals in harsh light. The chapter ring sports deep red hours for 13-24, should one desire a 24-hour scale. The sense of long, thin proportion with ample negative space and a red so subtle that it's almost camouflaged makes for a very refined aesthetic. There is a warmth to the opaline tone that almost comes across a bit vintage. This is all cased in 40mm titanium, a design which maintains the smooth, pebble-like aesthetic of the Galet while thinning down the bezel and optimizing dial legibility.\n\nThis Classic Origin Opaline is independent watchmaking at its most subtle. With its more robust and simplified manual calibre, the Classic Origin Opaline is a Laurent Ferrier that perfectly bridges a more formal attire and casual daily wear. The wrist presence is entirely about understatement, refinement, and simplicity. The majority of its artistic flourishes are on the caseback, for its wearer alone to know and enjoy. It is a watch dedicated to impressing only its wearer, a promise which it does not ever fall short on.\n\nAnd one last bit of trivia. Interestingly, this is quite an early Classic Origin and in the film made by Monochrome and Laurent Ferrier to introduce the model, it is this very movement number which is being assembled and filmed."
