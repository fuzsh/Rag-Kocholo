BIOGRAPHY

If Julie Ferrier belongs to the 8th generation of actors in her family, it was in a tutu that she discovered the world of entertainment, before attending Annie Fratellini ‘s circus school , then taking art lessons drama in 1996. Ten years later (and after having been a columnist for the show 20h10 pêtes ), she really launched her acting career thanks, first of all, to Isabelle Nanty , who directed her one-woman show show ( “Today it’s Ferrier” ), then thanks to Didier Bourdon , who gave him his first appearance on the big screen, in Madame Irma .

A first role which quickly calls for others, since Julie Ferrier continues with A castle in Spain , Didine , Agathe Cléry or 15 years and a half in the same year 2008, before finding herself starring in bigger projects, such as such as Paris , Musée Haut, Musée Bas or even Micmacs à tire-larigot by Jean-Pierre Jeunet in 2009, in which she plays the contortionist Môme Caoutchouc. The following year, she managed the affairs of L’Arnacoeur Romain Duris alongside François Damiens , then played her own role in Mathieu Amalric ‘s new film : the highly acclaimed Tournée .

In full success, the actress continued this great momentum in 2011, by lending her voice to Madame Carlotta in the animated film A Monster in Paris , then by venturing onto the small screen, for an episode of Chez Maupassant in particular . She then returns to the comic vein, her specialty, with Oil on Fire , opposite rising star Vincent Lacoste , and does not hesitate to bring nuance to her hilarious face by playing a deceived woman. by Fred Testot in Sea, No Sex and Sun in 2012.
