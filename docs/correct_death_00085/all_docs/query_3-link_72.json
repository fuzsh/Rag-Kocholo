May b , Sara Maroske b & Lucy Therese Smith c a Australian Tropical Herbarium, James Cook University, Smithfeld, Queensland 4878, Australia Email: john.dowe@jcu.edu.au b Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia c Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Richmond, Surrey, United Kingdom Abstract: Dr Eduard Wehl and Clara Wehl (née Mueller) and their children hold a unique position in the history of South Australian botany because of their association with Clara’s brother and the children’s uncle, Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, Australia’s most significant botanist of the nineteenth century. Both Wehl parents and six of their twelve surviving children collected botanical specimens for Mueller and about 1200 herbarium specimens have been located with most being held in the National Herbarium of Victoria. The majority of specimens were collected in the vicinity of Mount Gambier and Lake Bonney, South Australia. As well as collecting botanical specimens, two daughters, Marie Magdalene Wehl and Henrietta Jane Wehl, illustrated plants and fungi. About 300 illustrations have survived. Of these, about 240 are of flowering plants and contained in three sketchbooks, two of which are at the National Herbarium of Victoria and one at the State Herbarium of South Australia. Marie made a speciality of illustrating fungi, and 36 illustrations are included in an album in the Natural History Museum, London, and 25 others are held as either loose illustrations or associated with herbarium specimens in the National Herbarium of Victoria. Specimens collected by the Wehls have been used in the typification of at least 23 species names. The family is commemorated in three taxa: Clara Wehl in the marine alga Gigartina wehliae Sond.; Eduard and Clara Wehl jointly in the plant genus Wehlia F.Muell. [= Homalocalyx F.Muell.]; and Marie Wehl in the fungus Agaricus wehlianus F.Muell. ex Cooke [= Pluteus wehlianus (F.Muell. ex Cooke) Sacc.]. In this paper we provide a brief history of the Wehl family in South Australia. We assess the herbarium specimens collected by them, examine their illustrations and determine the connections between them and their current importance for typification. Underlying this, we consider the contribution made by the Wehl family toward the botanical work of Baron Ferdinand von Mueller. Keywords: Wehl, Clara, Eduard, Henrietta, Louise, Marie, Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, plant collectors, plant illustrators, South Australia, fungi, algae, Lake Bonney, Mount Gambier Introduction A few plants, particularly the minute annuals, dried for me, will be always welcome, as likely showing new localities of rarer species, which would be recorded under your honoured name in my works. 1 The contributions of amateur botanists have been crucial to the advancement of taxonomic research in Australia (Barker & Barker 1990), and the engagement and involvement of interested laypersons was a significant factor in the success and productivity of Australia’s most significant nineteenth-century botanist, 1 F. Mueller to Louise Wehl, 10 Sep. 1884 (Mueller Correspondence, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, RBGV). 2 F. Mueller to Louise Wehl, 29 Sep. 1884 (Mueller Correspondence, RBGV); F. Mueller to Louise Wehl, 25 Oct. 1887 (Mueller Correspondence, RBGV); F. Mueller to Louise Matthiessen (née Wehl), 2 July 1896 (Mueller Correspondence, RBGV). 3 Sometimes given as Henriette, though Henrietta is used in Baptisms solemnized in the Parochial District of Mount Gambier, South Australia in the year 1868 (Millicent Library Collection). Baron Ferdinand von Mueller (Maroske & Vaughan 2014) (Fig. 1). Mueller’s immediate family, including his youngest sister Clara Wehl (née Mueller) (Fig. 2), her husband Dr. Eduard Wehl (Fig. 3) and six of their surviving twelve children (Table 1), were active in botanical collecting for their “Dear Uncle”. 2 Two of Mueller’s nieces, Marie Magdalene Wehl and Henrietta Jane Wehl, 3 were enthusiastic flower and fungi illustrators, focusing on the flora of the Mt Gambier and Lake Bonney areas in South Australia. This research examines the Wehl family’s interactions with Ferdinand Mueller and their contribution to Australian botany through their botanical collections and illustrations.\n\nSwainsona 34 (2020) 2 Dowe et al. Materials and methods Herbarium specimens associated with the Wehl family were located on online databases and via personal communication with herbarium staff (AVH 2020; Kew 2019). From these data, a master list was generated. Examination of specimens was undertaken in the herbaria of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew by TWM and LTS, and the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria by JLD and TWM. Original illustrations were examined by JLD, TWM and LTS and original correspondence associated with the Wehl family and Ferdinand Mueller were examined in the library of the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria and others online at the Correspondence of Ferdinand von Mueller (by appointment with the editors). Photograph albums maintained by Wehl family descendants were generously made available for examination by JLD, TWM and SM. Current names for algae follow AANI (2020); fungi follow May & Wood (1997) and May et al. (2003), updated as necessary from cited references; and flowering plants follow APC (2020). Herbarium abbreviations follow Index Herbariorum (2019). Digitised newspapers were accessed at Trove (2019), and many literature sources were accessed via Biodiversity Heritage Library (2019). Type specimens of flowering plants were viewed at JSTOR Global Plants (JSTOR 2020). 4 From an untitled and undated (post-Dec. 1875) poem by Clara Wehl referring to her family (Millicent Library). 5 South Australian Register, The “Beckerath,” from Bremen, 18 Dec. 1847, p. 2. The Wehl family and Baron Ferdinand von Mueller May all live long united in brotherly, sisterly love, The burden of life be lighted to all you whom I love. 4 Baron Ferdinand von Mueller (1825–1896) was Australia’s most significant botanist of the nineteenth century (Churchill et al. 1978; Muir 1979; Ross 1996; Orchard 1999). Having completed his doctoral studies in Germany, Dr Ferdinand Müller migrated to Australia in 1847 accompanied by his two surviving sisters Bertha Fredericka (aged 20) and Clara Christiana Marie (aged 14), arriving in Adelaide on the barque Hermann von Beckerath from Bremen via Rio de Janeiro on 15 December 1847 as unassisted cabin passengers (Ships List 2014). 5 As family custodian, Ferdinand had intended to remain in Australia only long enough to establish a new life for his sisters and then return to Germany (Home 1997). However, these intentions were soon reconsidered, firstly because of the potential for scientific investigation in Australia particularly in the field of botany, and secondly by the deteriorating political and social situation in northern Europe (McMullen 1997; Voigt & Sinkora 1996). Following arrival, the Müllers resided in Adelaide, and had a natural affinity with migrants of German origin and especially those with interests in science and natural history (Grandison 1990; Monteath 2011).
