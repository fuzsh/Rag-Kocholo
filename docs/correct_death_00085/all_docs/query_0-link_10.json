        "text": "Caroline Louisa Waring Atkinson (1834-1872), naturalist and writer, was born on 25 February 1834 at Oldbury near Berrima, New South Wales, daughter of James Atkinson and his wife Charlotte, n√©e Waring. She was educated privately, for the most part by her mother, a former teacher with much artistic talent and a warm feeling for natural history. Apparently her freedom from formal schooling, together with her mother's influence and the charm of her environment, caused the girl, who as a child was frail, to acquire at an early age some knowledge of geology and a keen interest in both botany and zoology. This interest strengthened in young womanhood when she and her widowed mother, who had married George Bruce Barton, moved to Fernhurst at Kurrajong Heights west of Sydney.\n\nIn the richly forested area of her new home, supplemented by excursions elsewhere, Caroline studied plants diligently, wrote popular articles on the subject, made many admirable drawings and sent numerous specimens to eminent botanists, including William Woolls and Ferdinand Mueller, a valuable service that caused her name to be applied to a number of new species. There, too, her rudimentary knowledge of birds and insects extended and with it came ability in taxidermy. It would also appear that she was something of a pioneer in dress reform; the long skirts of the period were simply a nuisance in scrubby areas and so this woman naturalist used, both when rambling and pony-riding, attire which is said to have aroused 'some twitterings in the ranks of the colonial Mrs. Grundy'.\n\nHer Gertrude the Emigrant was published in Sydney in 1857 and two years later her Cowanda, the Veteran's Grant; authorship of the first was ascribed to 'an Australian Lady' and of the second to 'the Author of Gertrude'. In both books the writing, in simple moral tone, is distinguished for descriptive passages. This point applies also to a number of her other fictional works which appeared as serials in the Sydney Morning Herald and Sydney Mail between 1861 and 1872. There is, as well, compassion in the stories, a feeling which was expressed in practical fashion by Miss Atkinson in her charitable and church work at Kurrajong. The most notable of her writings, however, are those dealing with natural history, which were contributed to various journals in Sydney, and which, together with her drawings, were acclaimed by Dr Woolls."
