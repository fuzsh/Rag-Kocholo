        "text": "Last year the herbarium celebrated its 150th birthday and as part of the celebrations the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne commissioned its first ever piece of music theatre called Love Death Music and Plants (a musical infringement on the life of Baron Ferdinand von Mueller). It was composed by Matthew Hindson, written by Brian Lipson and produced by Jeannie Marsh. Professor Jim Ross was the Botanic consultant and Sara Maroske the Mueller researcher.\n\nThe performance was staged in Mueller Hall at the National Herbarium of Victoria, which sits within the grounds of the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne. During the performance actual plant specimens collected by Mueller made a rare appearance. (Partly because Mueller collected so many, the Herbarium staff thought they could risk a few by allowing the audience to handle them.) And while this piece of music theatre honours Mueller's achievements, it also notes his disappointments, namely his failure to marry and his loss of the directorship of the Botanic Gardens.\n\nWriter and director Brian Lipson describes Mueller's life as being as spectacular, intense, worrying and disappointing as a box of fireworks going off in the rain. Perhaps it was. But thanks to him, Melbourne hosts the most important herbarium in the southern hemisphere, and an internationally acclaimed botanic garden."
