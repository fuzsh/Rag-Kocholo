According to the information on the plaque, it was established to honour the memory of Baron Sir Ferdinand Jakob Heinrich von Mueller, a prominent scientist and botanist of the 19th century, who explored and identified a great number of Australian flora.\n\nPark website:\n\n(visit link)\n\nFrom wikipedia (abridged):\n\nMueller Park is a park in Subiaco, Western Australia, situated between Perth Modern School and Subiaco Oval. The park is named after German botanist Ferdinand von Mueller who described several hundred species of Australian flora and who participated in and promoted the exploration of Australia in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nIn December 1916 the park was renamed Kitchener Park in response to war-time sensitivities. Present day Roberts Road and Winthrop Avenue (Nedlands) were renamed from Mueller Road and Ferdinand Street respectively at the same time. The park currently comprises 4.3 hectares (11 acres).\n\nIn 1981 the park was renamed back to its original name when the two-tier stand redevelopment of Subiaco Oval was completed.\n\nText of plaque:\n\nThis Park is named to honour the memory of Baron Sir Ferdinand Jakob Heinrich von Mueller a botanist of renown. He was born 30th June 1825, in Rostock,\n\nGermany. Having migrated to South Australia in 1847, he became a\n\nnaturalised British subject shortly afterwards. He undertook\n\njourneys of exploration over large areas of Australia including\n\nWestern Australia, and contributed greately to the botanical knowledge\n\nof this country. He received awards and recognition throughout his\n\nlife. He was created a K.C.M.G. by Queen Victoria, appointed a Baron\n\nby the King of Wurttemburg and was elected a Fellow of the Royal\n\nSociety. In his time he was probably the most famous scientist\n\nin the southern hemisphere. The Australian Association for the\n\nAdvancement of Science created an award, the Mueller Medal, in his\n\nhonour. He died on 10th October 1896 at South Yarra, Melbourne.\n\nThis memorial was erected by the Subiaco City Council.\n\nWebsite with more information on either the memorial or the person(s) it is dedicated to: [Web Link]Location: Mueller Park\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nAdd another photo of the memorial.
