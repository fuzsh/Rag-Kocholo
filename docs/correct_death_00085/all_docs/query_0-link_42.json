        "text": "Cadellia is a monotypic genus of trees in the botanical family Surianaceae. The sole species, Cadellia pentastylis, commonly known as Ooline, is a medium to large tree with bright green leaves and rough tile-pattern bark. It has rain-forest origins dating from the Pleistocene Era when much of Australia was wetter than it is today. It grows on moderately fertile soils. Due to extensive clearing, it is now considered vulnerable in Australia.\n\nStands of Ooline are found in Sundown National Park and Tregole National Park in Queensland. In NSW they may be found in scattered localities in the north of the state; such as around Tenterfield and Terry Hie Hie near Moree.\n\nGallery\n\nOoline - Terry Hie Hie, NSW\n\nOoline covered in lichen - Terry Hie Hie, NSW\n\nOoline foliage - Terry Hie Hie, NSW\n\nBlack Orchids growing on Ooline\n\nBase of an Ooline thicket, with associated mosses - Terry Hie Hie, NSW\n\nReferences"
