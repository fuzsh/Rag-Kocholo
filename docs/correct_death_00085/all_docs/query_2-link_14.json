        "text": "By the death of Baron Sir Ferdinand\n\nVon Mueller, which occurred at Melbourne\n\non Friday night last, not only the\n\ncolony of Victoria but Australia\n\ngenerally has lost one of the most\n\ndistinguished and best known of its\n\npublic men. There is no province of this\n\ncontinent which is not indebted to the\n\ndeceased scientist's truly encyclopaedic\n\nknowledge of plant life, and none more so\n\nthan the colony of Western Australia, in\n\nwhose flora he took a deep and lasting\n\ninterest. The Baron's first personal ac-\n\nquaintance with the western part of this\n\ncontinent dates back to 1856, when, as\n\nnaturalist to the expedition sent out by\n\nthe Duke of Newcastle under Mr. Augustus\n\nGregory, he explored some of the eastern\n\nregions along Sturt's River from latitude\n\n18 deg. to 22deg. 20min. south. Later, in\n\n1867, he visited the Stirling Range and the\n\nsurrounding country and the vicinity of\n\nKing George's Sound, and in 1877 the\n\ncountry from Champion Bay to Sharks Bay,\n\nand also from Perth to Geographie Bay. The\n\nresults of these explorations are to be found\n\nin many of the Baron's scientific works\n\nwhich adorn the shelves of the public\n\nlibraries of these colonies. Some 14 years\n\nago, at the request of the then government\n\nof this colony, the late scientist wrote a\n\nmonograph on the Forest Resources of\n\nWestern Australia, which did much to\n\nbring the commercial woods of this\n\ncolony under favourable public notice.\n\nBaron Von Muller was a wonderful\n\nletter writer, and there is scarcely a\n\ntown or village in Western Australia\n\nwhere his communications to private\n\ncorrespondents did not find their way.\n\nTheir object was always the same\n\na desire to add to his vast store of informa-\n\ntion, and to swell the proportions of his\n\ncollection of specimens by which Victoria\n\nhas been specially enriched. Up to the\n\nlast Sir Ferdinand Von Mueller manifested\n\nhis keen interest in Western Australia,\n\nand only quite recently he cheerfully\n\nundertook, at the request of the Registrar\n\nGeneral, to furnish the specific nomencla-\n\nture of our most popular flowers and plants\n\nfor the use of schools.\n\nSir Ferdinand von Mueller, K.C.M.G.\n\nM.D., P.H.D., F.R.S., was born in Rostock,\n\non the Baltic Sea, in 1825. He studied in\n\nKiel, and went to South Australia to seek\n\na warmer clime against the effects of\n\nhereditary phthisis. Having been engaged\n\npreviously for seven years in the investi-\n\ngation of the plants of Schleswig and\n\nHolstein, he followed the same pursuit\n\nwith arduour in Australia, and tra-\n\nversed nearly all the settled districts of\n\nthe colony until 1852, when he accepted\n\nthe position of Government Botanist.\n\nFrom 1853 to 1855 he travelled extensively\n\nfor botanic investigations, chiefly through\n\nthe colonial territory, instituting also many\n\ngeographic explorations in the then largely\n\nuntraversed Australian Alps. In 1855 and\n\n1856 he accompanied, as naturalist, Mr. A.\n\nC. Gregory during his seventeen months'\n\nexpedition through tropical Australia, and\n\nreturned to Melbourne to assume the\n\ndirectorship of the Botanical Gardens,\n\nwhich he soon raised to one of the leading,\n\namongst similar, institutions of the globe.\n\nThe first palm-house in Australia was built\n\nby him in 1858 ; he was the first to raise the\n\ngreat Victoria Regia water-lily in Victoria ;\n\nhe reared foreign forest trees by hundreds\n\nof thousands, so as subsequently to be dis-\n\ntributed through the colonial public botanic\n\ninstitutions ; he brought numerous new\n\nnative resources before the great exhibi-\n\ntions, of several of which, as far back as\n\n1855, he was one of the local commissioners.\n\nMeanwhile, he was engaged in writing ex-\n\ntensive descriptive works on the plants of\n\nAustralia, amongst which his \"Fragmenta\n\nPhytographiæ Australæ was destined to\n\nbe a receptacle of definitions of all the new\n\nplants which he himself or his correspond-\n\nents discovered. It was the first work\n\nwritten in Latin in Australia. He issued\n\nalso an enlarged English edition of Wetts-\n\nlein's \" Organic Chemistry of Plants ;\" also\n\ntwo volumes, largely illustrated, on the\n\nplants of Victoria ; publications on the\n\nvegetable fossils of the gold-drifts, and a\n\nvolume on industrial plants ; and, irrespec-\n\ntive of these, numerous smaller essays and\n\nreports, a list of which was recently given\n\nin an Australian scientific journal, amount-\n\ning to 152 publications. In 1863 he joined\n\nMr. Bentham in a full elaboration of the\n\nuniversal flora of Australia, for which his\n\nmaterial was larger than all others since\n\nSir J. Banks's time. More than 100,000\n\nspecimens examined by him during seven-\n\nteen successive years were transmitted\n\nwith notes to Mr. Bentham for the seven\n\nvolumes of this work, which is the first\n\nuniversal flora of any of the great divisions\n\nof the globe. His personal travels in\n\nAustralia for botanical researches, on horse-\n\nback and on foot, amount to 27,000 miles.\n\nGeographic pursuits have been fostered\n\nby him incessantly, though, tram-\n\nmelled by official local duties, he\n\nwas, after 1856, prevented from sharing\n\nin the great geographic enterprises.\n\nA search for Dr. Leichhardt, under the\n\ndirection of a ladies' committee, and the\n\nfirst two important expeditions of Mr. E.\n\nGiles, were called forth by him, and his\n\nreturn from the north coast principally\n\ngave rise to the first camel expeditions in\n\nAustralia. Numerous Sovereigns bestowed\n\ndecorations on him, including the Com-\n\nmander Order of St. Isabella of Spain and\n\nof St. Iigo of Portugal. He was one of the\n\nfirst three in Australia who received the\n\nOrder of St. Michael and St. George. On\n\nthe occasion of the celebration of the 25th\n\nmarriage day of the King of Wurtemberg\n\nand the sister of the Czar, he was raised to\n\nhis hereditary rank. He was honorary or\n\ncorresponding member of about 200 scien-\n\ntific unions, representing many branches of\n\nknowledge. A number of geographic\n\nfeatures in Australia, including a river of\n\nvery great length in Queensland, a moun-\n\ntain in Spitzbergen, a glacier in New Zea-\n\nland, etc., bear his name. He initiated the\n\nextension of the planting of eucalypti in\n\nthe countries on the Mediterranean Sea,\n\nand in many other parts of the globe. The\n\nnumber of useful plants from abroad intro-\n\nduced by him into Australia is enormous,\n\nand this, like all his other labours, whether\n\nliterary or horticultural, botanical, chemi-\n\ncal, or geographical, has served not only\n\nthe colony of Victoria, but also all the\n\nother settled portions of Australia.]\n\nTELEGRAMS FROM SIR JOHN\n\nFORREST.\n\nOn receipt of the news of the death of\n\nBaron von Mueller, the Premier (Sir John\n\nForrest) forwarded the following telegrams\n\nto the Premier of Victoria and Mr.\n\nJ. A Panton, C.M.G., Melbourne :-\n\n\" The Hon. the Premier, Melbourne, Vic-\n\ntoria. - On behalf of the Government and\n\npeople of Western Australia, I desire to\n\nplace on record our deep regret at the sad\n\nnews just received of the death of Baron\n\nSir Ferdinand Mueller. The late Baron's\n\nname was honoured throughout this colony\n\nin whose interests and the interests of\n\nscience he laboured for half a century. I\n\nhave asked Mr. Panton, C.M.G., the Police\n\nMagistrate of Melbourne, to be present at\n\nthe funeral on behalf of this colony.\" \" J.\n\nPanton, Esq., C.M.G., Police Magistrate,\n\nMelbourne. - This Government will be\n\nmuch obliged if you will be present and re-\n\npresent this Government at the funeral of\n\nthe late Baron von Mueller. Please also\n\nobtain a suitable floral wreath as a tribute\n\nof high appreciation by the people of this\n\ncolony for his life-long work in the interests\n\nof scientific research in Australia.\""
