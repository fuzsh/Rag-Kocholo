        "text": "THE greatest of all Australian explorers, the chivalrous\n\nand high minded Captain Charles Sturt, has recently\n\npassed into eternity , but history will ever record the\n\nachievements of the man who led us to the largest of the\n\nriver systems of Australia, who called us to the occu-\n\npation of a now and extensivo colonial territory , and who\n\nfirst of all carried the standard of geography really into\n\nCentral Australia.\n\nSecond only to him stands, in our exploratory records,\n\nDr Ludwig Leichhardt. He unfolded to us the second\n\ngreat system of Australian rivers, the vast expanse of the\n\nBurdekin with its numerous tributaries, and he also led\n\nus to the occupation of territories which, at no distant day,\n\nmust become a series of separate colonies, each rivalling in\n\nspace with European kingdoms. But when the biographer\n\nis called upon to sketch the career of the great geographer\n\nof tropical Australia, he will be forced in sadness to admit\n\nthe truth, that the closing scenes in Leichhardt's life were\n\nlong lost in obscurity, and that the actual extent of his\n\nfinal discoveries remained for a long while unknown.\n\nIt is not the intention of the writer to wander away in\n\nsentimentalities, nor to prove by subtle argument the pos-\n\nsibility of Dr. Leichhardt or any of his comrades still\n\nbeing alive. Nor is it the object of these pages to point out\n\nwhy successive efforts to shed light on Leichhardt's fate\n\nseem rather to have increased the darkness which yet sur-\n\nrounds his last expedition, or have augmented even the per-\n\nplexities in our endeavours to prognosticate how he fell.\n\nFour special expeditions, on different plans and under\n\ndifferent leaders have only established that Leichhardt did\n\nnot risk under the hands of the wild hordes of the interior\n\nin places indicated by them.But while those who searched\n\nafter traces of the lost party did not solve the primary\n\nobjects of their mission, their labours have not been with-\n\nout importance to geographical science. The course of one\n\ntraveller connected the southern interior of Queensland in\n\na direct route with the vast pastoral depressions about Lake\n\nTorrens. The researches of another explorer, bent on\n\nascertaining Leichhardt's fate, unfolded to us a tract of\n\nfertile country now already occupied by herds and flocks,\n\nin fact not less in length than that of Sweden 0r Italy.\n\nAnd had the sturdy and trained traveller, who succumbed\n\nto fever in this search, been favoured by the rains of an\n\nordinary season, we were warranted in assuming that he\n\nwould with easo have penetrated from the NE to the\n\nSW of Australia, and would have, on this great intended\n\nbase line of future explorations, disclosed to us also the\n\ncircumstances of Leichhardt's loss.\n\nUndaunted by these prior misfortunes, and with praise-\n\nworthy energy, West Australia came lately to the rescue.\n\nThe intelligence gained within the last months by a young\n\naccomplished explorer, sent out by the generous authorities\n\nat Perth, has also been negative, but while, even as such,\n\nit teaches us anew how little credence can be given to the\n\nstories of the aborigines, it disproves, so it would seem the\n\napproach of Leichhardt to a far southern position in West\n\nAustralia, as has repeatedly been surmised. But also, this\n\ndash into the interior has been winning for us a geogra-\n\nphical acquisition which, if measured by the European\n\nstandard, is all but equal to the length of Scotland or\n\nBavaria.\n\nHighminded intelligence and perseverance give always\n\nthe greatest assurance of success. We see these sterling\n\ncharacters of mankind displayed in noble rivalry at this\n\nvery moment, in endeavouring to penetrate the polar ices\n\nof the north, or to connect two great oceans, barred to direct\n\nnavigation ever since the time of tho Phanicmns Wo live\n\nin n time of grent cntci prises- at n time, also, in which tho\n\ncraving for information 13 commonsurato with tho advance\n\n11 ent of arts nnd science\n\nAustralia, already nscu to greatness, is bound to keep\n\nyaco with tho progress ot other parta of tho world, and\n\namong its national duties, none 13 moro urgent, nono more\n\npro using, than tha careful investigation of the vast\n\ncxpnnso of inland territory not jot traversed bj our race.\n\nImpelled by such fetlmgs, Dr Leichhardt undoi took his\n\nexpeditions, of which tho fust has already proved so ltn\n\nn ensely fruitful, whilo in the last ha sacrificed, as wo fear,\n\nhis life, for science nnd Australian progress\n\nBut when a brrvo man thus, for tho dnect benefit of a\n\nwhole continent, and for tho immediato advantages of largo\n\ncommunities, spent his best j ears and risked his very lifo\n\nand when, moiecver, he undeicd available a rate storo of\n\nrnowledge-ho tcok with him, undoubtedly, a persuasion\n\nthat no cflort would bo spared to troco sut his futo and that\n\nof his party, shculd ho sink in bis enterprise How far\n\nthis (nat undersinnding has been fulftlled, will be road by\n\nfuturo generations in a sal canptor though wo wero\n\nniiFlcd ty tho traditions of tho natives for a dozon of\n\nyears, though wo failed to follow the lost explorer in\n\na soason of unpatiillelol drought, tho dutios of\n\nhumanilv and bia claims on tho gratitude of this\n\ncountry remain tho carat It is idle to tell us\n\nthat Leichhardts tiacts, liko tho tuo't of a ship,\n\nwhich foundered unsoeu in the oeoan, aro now obliterated\n\nWhether the pnrtj succumbed under the spear» nnd clubs\n\nof barbnnans, or whether it wns swept into destruotion by\n\ntuddon floods, 01 whethei it perished in waterlea wastes,\n\nor whether it sunk under exhaustion lllnojs, or starvation\n\n-tho shnrn axe-cuts on the troes wide asunder w ill show\n\nfor half a century vvheiö the implements of tho lost\n\ncxploierB moy jet bo found, and thtrowiih. a eluo to thoir\n\nfate.\n\nMany a philanthropist who may glanco over\n\ntheso pages will perhaps not be aware that up\n\nto theso dajs not oven the buckle of a saddle\n\nstrap belonging to Loicbhnicit s parly has been fourni\n\nm native camps, much less, then, the bones of half a\n\nhundred bowes nnd oxen-bones which, wherever they aro\n\nscattered, will testif J for tho remainder of tho couturv how\n\nfnr tho gallant and venturous man und his followers did\n\nreally penolratc A modest pe uniary support by the\n\nfiublic, an earnest will and fair bush oxperienco on the\n\nendirs part, will lend most undoubtedly to Leichhardt s\n\ndonthrlaco during nny favournblo eea«ou IS or need any\n\nnow dangers to human life be encountcied under ordinary\n\npiudenco and experience Jt is lut a just tributo to an\n\nexplorer, who sinks in bis arduo » task, that by following\n\nI his steps- tho full extent of Ina discoveries shoild ho\n\niel elend known, bi^ j uníais, pel hups, yoi ho I cm J, mid\n\ncredit thus fully bo awarded to him who fie-mon lily can\n\ntimm it no more.

But tho expeditions previous to\n\nlSGt» wtro loft under tho impression that Leichhardts\n\nj ai ty was lost at Cooper's Creek,-a fact only\n\nthen fully disproved A. Gregory's meritorious explora-\n\ntions, moreover, would lie to the north of Leichhaidf s sup-\n\nposed tracks, John MaoDouall Stuart, who so manfully\n\nstruck across tho widest part of the continent, and Burkj\n\nund Wills, who padly perished after accomplishing u\n\nglorious oljcct, would only cross Leichhardts lino on ono\n\nspot-unconscious of the fact, unawaio of his presence so\n\nfar north and perhaps west. Mr. 1 orrest, who so boldly\n\npushed throueh the dense inland sciubs of South-\n\nwest Australia, was led by the natives to a\n\npo'iuon piobably far too much south, whilo tho\n\nsettlers noith of Shark Bay have not crossed tho\n\ndividing mountains, and not yet followed tho inland\n\nwaters of theso ranges. Leichhaidf, intending to skirt the\n\ninhospitable region from which Sturt, in Central Australia,\n\nhad to retreat, intended, nevertheless, to keep aw îy from\n\nthe north coaat as far as circumstances would peí mit, not\n\nmerely to shorten tbo distance of tho enormous way-lino\n\nbefore him, but, also, becau o such a course far inland\n\nwould carrj with it tho charm of absoluto novelty, and\n\nreward him with tho discovery of tho wateis flowing inknd\n\nfrein the elevated countrj south of Carpentaria and of\n\nAinheimS Land and the west coaijt\n\nIo determino tho configuration of that long lino of\n\ncountry, and to ascertain tho sj stems and tho bill of tho\n\ninland water-courses, remains one of tho greatest problema\n\nof geography up to tho pieaent dav The discovery of\n\ncopper mines ot great richness, gold tracts of fabulous\n\nvalue, pastoral basaltic country of extraordinary fertility,\n\nm inland regions only moro recently settled, holds out, be-\n\nsides, to futuro geographic enterprises promises of towards,\n\nwhich ought to give to inland explorations a groat impetus,\n\n-nottos-penk of tho gain, which always arises from oven\n\nordinary geographic exploita, to the maps of the world, nor\n\nto estimate the access to many branches of science, which\n\nnny intelligent observ cr can collaterally enrich. Wo should\n\nalto bear fullv in mind, how a lino in Leichhardts intended\n\ndirection would nt once enable tbo squatters of North-east\n\nAustralia to dnvo their suiplusof flocks and herds easily\n\nacross to n well-watered hilly and grassy counfry within\n\nclose proximity of tho harbours of the nortb-woat coast\n\n'lo accomplish, then, with a new search foi Dr Leich-\n\nhardt, the geographical and industrial objects also, for\n\nwhich (hat great explorer set out on his last entorpiiBe, wo\n\nhavo to thooro between two positions as starting points.\n\nTho next traveller has either to iollow Leichhardt from the\n\nspots to which he was traced on tributaries of the Hinders\n\nUiver, and then to proceed on the southern full of the in-\n\nland country, in o direction towards tho Muicluson Uiver,\n\n01 Eome other position on the west coa't, to which,\n\nby tho features of tho unexplored interior, ho may\n\nbo led, or bo may advance from the remotest\n\nsources of the Murchison Rivti, approximately\n\nou an E N E. couisc, towards Contial Mount\n\nStuart, leaving Termination Lake some degrees to\n\nthe north, thence skirt tho supposeu desert country on his\n\nwuy to Carpentaria. Consideung that tho settlers of\n\nQueensland aro rapidly advancing westward, wo may trust\n\nthat tho eastern half of Austrian will thus, ero long, bo\n\ntxploied Indeed, it is the dark of the western half of the\n\ncontinent into which the torch of science is now to bo ear-\n\nned. The object is one of glory, and worthy of manly\n\nstrides. It would bo the great final stroke for Australian\n\ngeography-it would give us a baso line, from which\n\nfuture detail operations would diverge with facility.\n\nLot us hope, then, that tho next cool season will soo tho\n\ndiscoverer of Lake Barleo again m the field , that he maj\n\nstart from the remotest sources of tho river Murchison m\n\nMarch, and that he may reach the Carpentaria settlements\n\nbefore the heat of the following summer scorehe s tho and\n\njlains, and renders tho toil of his march slül inoro Eovero\n\nAnd, oven if m all his j outhful elasticity nnd energy, ho\n\nshould copo in vam -with a country of inclemency, anda\n\nscascn of terror, a bold man even then can w in for us again\n\nnew remtorial acquisitions from tho vast unknown interior,\n\nand effect, bj good generalship, his retreat alw tys in safety.\n\nIho prospect ia, however, cheeiing The uiouutains of tho\n\ntorth west const, occasionally rising to threo and four\n\nthousand feet, must send long courses of dr image far m an\n\neasterly direction, and thus afford the means of leaning\n\ninsily fora long distance on safo lines of water supply.\n\nWo ulso know that no pcrubs so mi] racticablo exist in tho\n\nnorthern part of the continent ns impede EO much tho pro-\n\ngress in tho dcseits of the south.\n\nIt is to bo regretted that dioinodaries aro not available to\n\nMr. Eoneot, or anj' other leader who mny start from tho\n\nremotest waters of tho Murchison Uiver. But as in all\n\npi obabihty an easy ov erland road from Carpentaria, where\n\ntho Victorian camels aro still kept, would be formed by the\n\nintended expedition from West Australia, the animals might\n\nsoon find then way to tho west coast, where thoy would\n\nmoro readily become available for new inland fraveb,\n\nthrough portitms of ill-watered and groaoltss country, thin\n\nm Queensland.\n\n'Iho writer, m stepp ng ¡with his modest design before\n\nthoso who made Australia then home, and who owe to this\n\ngreat Southern land a happy and prosperous independence,\n\ntimms thut consideration which ia duo to his disinterested\n\nadvenca ii\"( so as the fato of Leichhardt would long\n\nhave been revealed bad ho loft bobiad him in thin country\n\nnny descendant», because fhe»o nevet would have ceased to\n\nurge biB rights Tho writer also claims that consideration\n\nwhich is duo to himself as an extensive traveller in thia\n\ncontinent, for the advancement of which ho has laboured\n\nhero uninteiruptedly for tvventj-two jearB.
