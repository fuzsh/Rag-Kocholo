Soon after receiving his Ph.D., he left Germany for Adelaide, South Australia (1847), where for some time he worked as a pharmacist. The same year he started writing a series of papers on the flora of southern Australia. Appointed as a foundation government botanist of Victoria in 1853, he moved to Melbourne and traveled throughout the surrounding area conducting extensive botanical studies.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science"
