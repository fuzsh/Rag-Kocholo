Marcia M. Gutzman Bielby\n\nBirth: Mar. 18, 1934\n\nDeath: Jul. 6, 2009\n\nMarcia M. Bielby, 75, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister and educator died 6 July 2009 after a valiant battle with cancer. Funeral services were held 10 July 2009 at the United Methodist Church on the corner of 15th and Clark Street in Pocatello with Pastor Craig Strovel officiating. Graveside services were held 11 July 2009 in Salmon. Arrangements were under the direction of the Wilks Funeral Home. She was born in Salmon, Idaho on 18 March 1934, to Johnie and Mae Gutzman. She attended schools in Salmon, graduating as saluatorian from Salmon High School in 1952. She attended Idaho State College for two years then married her childhood sweetheart, Victor C. Bielby, on 25 October 1954, in Fayetteville, North Carolina where he was stationed in the army. Upon returning from the service her husband accepted a position with the Federal Bureau of Public Roads which gave them the opportunity to live and work in many localities in the state of Idaho, including Boise, Salmon, St. Maries, Stanley, Crouch, and Island Park, with each place adding lifelong friendships. During these years, they were blessed with two children, John in 1956 and Vicki in 1959.

Yes, I do find it very interesting. I do already have the names of the children of Carl Ludwig Meyer and Catharine Elisabeth Rockemann along with the dates listed in the research report you sent me. However, I still very much enjoyed reading the information you sent and hope that you will continue to send me any new information you receive. Have you or will you be getting a copy of Carl Ludwig Meier's baptismal record? If you do, I would love to have a copy. I do have a copy of Cord Heinrich Christian Meier's baptism that I could share with you. Richard (Dick) Weide also translated the German, and I have a copy of that.\n\nLet me explain how I received that information. Barbara Bacher Weide used to leave in Germany and did research while she was there. Barbara is the daughter of Alma Meyer and Floyd Bacher. My grandfather, Paul Meyer, was a sister to Alma Meyer. I have met Barbara a couple of times that I remember. You do have Alma Meyer listed under children of Wilhelm Frederick (William) Meyer and Caroline Beckmann. Alma was born January 15, 1905. She married Floyd Bacher, b. April 12, 1911, on May 24, 1936. They had four children:\n\n1. Marilyn Bacher, b. April 1, 1937 (m. 9-1-1960 to Warren Sanderlin, b. 11-18-1934), 2. Marjorie Bacher, b. 3-27-1940, (m. 6-23-1963 to Erh Lin, b. July 1, 1934; divorced 1972 and remarried 1973 to Phil Meyerson; divorced 1975), 3. William R. Bacher, b. 12-5-1941 (m. Ana Elsa Casamiquela, b. 12-28-1934, and Barbara Bacher, b. 9-21-1943 (m. 1-31-1965 to Dick Weide, b. 12-26-1943). (Some of those names and dates I have received from the late Ivan Simmonds who had published a book titled, The Genealogy of Henrich Christian Meyer and Sophie Beckman Meyer. The copy I have is the revised version printed in 1981. Some of the dates also appear in a autobiography written by Alma Meyer Bacher that I have. Anyway, I have a copy of some of the items Barbara was able to find while in Germany. Barbara wrote a paper titled, \"Weides' Trip to Nordhemmern, Germany.\" The trip took place from September 14-16, 1991. I'll tell you about some of the information included in that paper. Dick and Barbara visited the only Lutheran church called \"Kapelle Nordhemmern.\" Nordhemmern had no Gasthauses so they drove through neighboring towns of Hille and Hartum. They ended up staying in Espelkamp at the Birkenhof, a nice hotel. They drove back to Nordhemmern the next morning to attend church services at the church mentioned above. While there they found out some information on the church. They also talked to a farmer, Christian Grannemann, who had many historical books on the town of Nordhemmern and the surrounding area. Barbara and Dick were very fortunate to be able to speak and understand German fairly well. Within half an hour they found the names of her great grandfather and her great great grandparents in Die Familien der Kirchengemeinde Hartum, 1826-1875, compiled by Heinz Riechmann and published in 1986. The book contained all the names of those who lived in Hartum, Hahlen, Holzhausen, and Nordhemmern from 1826-1875. They did find a discrepancy in the marriage date of Carl Ludwig Meier and Catharine Elisabeth Rockemann. The book said they were married in Friedewalde in 1828, but the original baptismal record of Cord Heinrich Christian that they found later said they were married in 1826 in Friedewalde. Herr Grannemann lead Barbara and Dick to #100, just north of Nordhemmern where Carl Ludwig Meier lived. Barbara said the present address was Ovelgonne 36, 4955 Hille 1. The owners at that time were Uwe and Martin Horstmann, brothers. The Horstmann brothers were in the business of building houses. Ivan Simmonds (mentioned earlier) said that Carl Ludwig Meier was a carpenter. The original buildings on #100 were no longer there, except for the possibility of one workshop which had a lot of old carpentry equipment that the brothers inherited from their father. Barbara wondered if Carl has sold his business with the property when he immigrated to America. Barbara and Dick also stayed in Mindern, where her mother's maternal grandmother, Caroline Marie Christine Borgmann Beckmann had been born. They purchased a copy of Heinz Riechmann's book while they were there. (They were actually out of the book but it came in the mail a week later.) Barbara and Dick did meet with the Pastor of Kapelle Nordhemmern and found the baptismal record of Christian Meier. Heinrich Grannemann was one of the godparents. They didn't find Carl Ludwig's birth recorded in the Riechmann's book so they did not look up his information at the church although she wishes she would have. Grannemann being the last name of the person they had talked to earlier, they went back to him to relate this information. Herr Grannemann told him that godparents were usually relatives. Herr Grannemann also had a letter that was written in German and sent from America from a Meier to a Grannemann. Barbara goes on to state that Christian Meier emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1854 at the age of 19. It was about a 50 mile trip up the Weser River from Minden to the port of Bremen. A voyage across the Atlantic from Europe at that time took six weeks, so it was no small undertaking. The Meyers settled in Guttenberg, Clayton County, Iowa. Guttenberg is on the Mississippi River in the northern part of the state near the Wisconsin border. Christian had been apprenticed in Germany as a tailor and followed that trade when he reached Iowa. Some of the information after that is incorrect because she took the information from Ivan Simmonds, and he had some information incorrect.\n\nIvan Simmonds had the F. W. Beckmann that was the pastor of the Old Stone Church (in Nebraska) as being the F. W. Beckmann that was the father of Sophie Beckmann who married Christian. Through your information, I have learned that F. W. Beckmann was her father but not the F. W. Beckmann that was a pastor. Frederick Wilhelm Beckman who married Anna Vonbehrens (according to your records) is my great great great grandfather on the Meyer side. Another Friedrich Wilhelm Beckmann, b. December 21, 1824, (who was the pastor of the Old Stone Church) and married to Johanna (Hanne) Catharine Meiercord, b. December 1, 1817, is my great great grandfather on the Lehmann/Beckmann side.\n\nThe Rockemann family comes into play there, too. Friedrich Beckmann and Johanna Meiercord had a son named Johann Heinrich (Henry) Beckmann, b. March 12, 1854, that married Maria Caroline Sophia (Sophie) Rockemann, b. January 29, 1859. Maria Rockemann Beckmann's parents were Heinrich Friedrich Christian Rockemann, b. April 20, 1824, and Maria Anne Margaretta Elizabeth Sudmeier. (You told me that Marie was first married to Johann Friedrich Christian Rockemann. Then when he died, Marie married Johann's brother, Heinrich Friedrich Christian Rockemann. Heinrich's grandparents were Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Rockemann, b. April 14, 1782, and Anne Catharine Marie Margarethe Grannemann. Catherina (or Katherina) Elizabeth Rockemann's parents were also Johann and Anne Rockemann. So, Katherina, Johann, and Heinrich were all siblings. (Most of this information came from you, but I didn't know if you had made the connection.) When I seen the name \"Grannemann\" in your records I was very excited because I remembered that name from the information from Barbara Weide.\n\nI have been e-mailing Barbara recently and hope to actually visit her this summer. (Barbara and Dick live in the United States now.) I need to find out from her (if she knows) the parents, grandparents, etc. of the farmer they visited with in Germany (Christian Grannemann). That information along with your information may indeed verify that we (Barbara and I and I guess maybe you, too) are related to the Christian Grannemann that Barbara and Dick visited with. I think I gave Barbara your website to check out. She was very excited to learn about the Grannemann connection.\n\nI guess that is probably enough for you to ponder for now. There are a lot of dates typed in this e-mail and I tried to proofread them after I typed them but if something does not seem right, let me know. Also let me know what you think about this information. Hopefully it will help you out. I will let you know other information I have to add to your \"collection' later.\n\nI look forward to meeting you when you come to town. Let me know when you get your schedule.\n\nGod bless you!
