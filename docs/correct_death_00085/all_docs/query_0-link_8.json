        "text": "The greatest of all Australian explorers, the\n\nchivalrous and high minded Captain Charles\n\nSturt, has recently passed into eternity , but\n\nhistory will over record the achievements of the\n\nman who led us to the largest of the river systems\n\nof Australia , who called us to the ocean\n\nnation of a new and extensive colonial tot story,\n\nand who first of all carried the standard of\n\nGeography really into Central Australia\n\nSecond only to him stands in our exploratory\n\nrecords, Dr Ludwig Leichhardt Ho unfolded\n\nto us the second great system of Australian\n\nrivers, the vast expanse of the Burdekin, with\n\nits numerous tributaries, and he also led us to\n\nthe occupation of territories which, at no distant\n\nday, must become a series of separate\n\ncolonies, each rivalling in space with European\n\nkingdoms But when the biographer is called\n\nupon to sketch the career of the great geographer\n\nof tropical Australia, he will be forced in and\n\nness to admit the truth that the closing scenes\n\nin Leichhardt's life were long lost in obscurity,\n\nand that the actual extent of his final discoveries\n\nremained for a long while unknown.\n\nIt is not the intention of the writer to wander\n\naway in sentimentalities, nor to prove by subtle\n\nargument the possibility of Dr Leichhardt or\n\nany of his comrades still being alive Nor is it\n\nthe object of these pages to point out why she\n\ndeserve efforts to shed light on Leichhardt's fate\n\nseem rather to have increased the darkness\n\nwhich yet surrounds his last expedition, embayed\n\naugmented even the perplexities in our endeavors\n\nto prognosticate how he fell Four special\n\nexpeditions, on different plans and under different\n\nleaders, have only established that Leichhardt\n\ndid not sink under the hands of the wild\n\nhordes of the interior in places indicated by\n\nthem But while those who searched after\n\ntraces of the lost party did not solve the primary\n\nobjects of their mission, their labors have\n\nnot been without importance to geographical\n\nscience The course of one traveller connected\n\nthe southern interior of Queensland in a direct\n\nroute with the vast pastoral depressions about\n\nLake Torrens The researches of another explorer,\n\nbent on ascertaining Leichhardt's fate,\n\nunfolded to us a tract of fertile country now\n\nalready occupied by herds and flocks, a tract\n\nnot less in length than that of Sweden or Italy\n\nAnd had the sturdy and trained traveller, who\n\nsuccumbed to fever in this search, been favored\n\nby the rays of an old man season, we are warranted\n\nin assuming that he would with ease\n\nhave penetrated from the N. E. to the S W of\n\nAustralia, and would have, on this great in\n\ntended base line of future explorations, disclosed\n\nto us also the circumstances of Leich\n\nhard the loss\n\nUndaunted by these prior misfortunes, and\n\nwith praiseworthy energy, West Australia came\n\nlately to the rescue The intelligence games\n\nwithin the last months by a young accomplished\n\nexplorer, sent out by the generous authorities\n\nat Perth, has also been negative, but while,\n\neven as such, it teaches us knew how little are\n\ndence can be given to the stones of the\n\naborigines, it disproves, so it would seem, the\n\napproach of Leichhardt to a far southern position\n\nin West Australia, as has repeatedly been surmised\n\nBut also, this dash into the interior\n\nhas been coming for us a geographical acquisi-\n\ntion which, if measured by the European\n\nstandard, is all but equal to the length of Scot-\n\nland 01 Bavaria\n\nHighminded intelligence and perseverance\n\ngive always the greatest assurance of success\n\nWe see these sterling characters of mankind\n\ndisplayed in noble rivalry at this very moment,\n\nin endeavoring to penetrate the polar ices of\n\nthe north, or to connect two great oceans, barred\n\nto direct navigation ever since the time of the\n\nPhoenicians We live in a time of great enter-\n\nprises-at a time, also, in which the craving for\n\ninformation is commensurate with the advance-\n\nment of arts and science\n\nAustralia, already risen to greatness, is bound\n\nto keep pace with the progress of other ports of\n\nthe world, and among its national duties none\n\nis more urgent, none more promising than the\n\ncareful investigation of the vast expanse of in\n\nland territory not yet traversed by our race\n\nImpelled by such feelings, Dr Leichhardt under\n\ntook his expeditions, of which the first has\n\nalready proved so immensely fruitful, while in\n\nthe last he sacrificed, as we fear, his life, for\n\nscience and Australian progress\n\nBut when a brave man thus, for the direct\n\nbenefit of a whole continent, and for the immediate\n\nadvantages of large communities, spent\n\nhis best years and asked his very life and\n\nwhen, moreover, he rendered available a rare\n\nstore of knowledge he took with him, undoubtedly,\n\na persuasion that no effort would be\n\nspared to trace out his fate and that of his\n\nparty, should he sink in his enterprise How\n\nfar this tacit understanding has been fulfilled,\n\nwill be read by future generations in a sad\n\nchapter Though we were misled by the tradi-\n\ntions of the natives for a dozen of years,\n\nthough we failed to follow the lost explorer in\n\na season of unparalleled drought, the duties of\n\nhumanity and his claims on the gratitude of\n\nthis country remain the same It is idle to tell.\n\nus that Leichhardt's traces, like the track of a\n\nship, which foundered unseen in the ocean, are\n\nnow obliterated by better the party succumbed\n\nunder the spears and clubs of barbarians, or\n\nwhether it was swept into destruction by sudden\n\nfloods, or whether it perished in waterless\n\nwastes, or whether it sunk under exhaustion,\n\nillness, or starvation-the sharp axe cuts on the\n\ntrees wide asunder will show for half a century\n\nwhere the implements of the lost explorers may\n\nyet be found and therewith a clue to their fate\n\n\" Many a philanthropist who may glance over\n\nthese pages will perhaps not be aware that up to\n\nthese days not even the outline of a saddle strap\n\nbelonging to Leichhardt's party has been found\n\nin native camps much less, then, the bones of\n\nhalf a hundred horses and oxen bones which,\n\nwherever they are Scattered, will testify for the\n\nremainder of the century how far thogullantand\n\nventurous man and his followers did really gone\n\ntrain A modest pecuniary support by the public,\n\nan earnest will and fair bush experience on the\n\nleader's part, will lead most undoubted to\n\nLeichhardt's death place during any favorable\n\nseason Nor need any new dangers to human life\n\nbe encountered under ordinary prudence and ex\n\npronounce His but ajusttnbute to an explorer who\n\nsinks in his arduous task that by following his\n\nstopS the full extent of his discoveries should be\n\nrendered known, his journals, perhaps, yet be\n\nsecured, and credit thus fully be awarded to\n\nhim who personally can chum it no more\n\nNew searches need not involve an immoderate\n\nexpenditure inasmuch as squatting settlements\n\nhave spread so far in many directions now a\n\ndays, and the maps of former explorers afford\n\nso much guidance, that a light party during\n\nthe cool season, may cross the continent now in\n\nany direction It should also not be forgotten\n\nthat most of Leichhardt's companions would\n\neven now, if she, scarcely Inn o passed middle\n\nage, and that the two natives who accompanied\n\nhim in his last great enterprise may, still more\n\nreadily than his other companions, live up to\n\nthe present day in a hospitable region of the\n\ninterior\n\nIt has often been asked why the various ex-\n\nplorations acrOsS the continent brought us no\n\ntidings of the missing party But the expeditions\n\nprevious to 1865 were left under the impression\n\nthat Leichhardt's party was lost at\n\nCooper's Creek-ufuctonlj then fully disproved\n\nA Gregory's meritorious explorations, motor car,\n\nwould be to the north of Leichhardt's supposed\n\ntracks John MacDouallStuurt,who so manfully\n\nstruck across the widest part of the continent,\n\nand Burke and Wills, who s idly perished after\n\naccomplishing a glorious object, would only\n\ncross I eiehhurdt's line on one spol-uncons-ious\n\nof the fact unaware of his presence so far north\n\nand perhaps west Mr Forrest who is boldly\n\npushed through the dense inland scrubs of\n\nSouth west Australia, was led by the natives to\n\na position probably far too much south , while\n\nthe settlers north of Shark Bay have not crossed\n\nthe dividing mountains, and not yet followed\n\nthe inland waters of these ranges Leichhardt,\n\nintending to skirt the inhospitable region from\n\nwhich Murl, in Central Australia, had to\n\nretreat, intended, nevertheless, to keep away\n\nfrom the north coast as far as circumstances\n\nwould permit not merely to shorten the distance\n\nof the enormous way line before him, but\n\nalso, because such a course far inland would\n\ncarry with it the charm of absolute novelty, and\n\nreward him with the discovery of the waters\n\nflowing inland from the elevated country south\n\nof Carpentaria and of Arnheim's Land and the\n\nwest coast\n\nTo determine the configuration of that long\n\nline of country, and to ascertain the systems\n\nand the fall of the inland water courses, remains\n\nof the greatest problems of geography up to the\n\npresent day The discovery of copper mines of\n\ngreat richness gold tracts of fabulous value,\n\npastoral basaltic country of extraordinary for\n\ntility, in inland regions only more recently\n\nsettled, holds out besides, to future geographic\n\nenterprises promises of rewards, which ought to\n\ngive to inland explorations a great impetus,\n\nnot to speak of the gain which always arises\n\nfrom even ordinary geographic exploits, to the\n\nmaps of the world nor to estimate the access to\n\nmany branches of science, which a by intelligent\n\nobserver can collaterally enrich We should\n\nalso bear fully in mind, how a line to Leichhardt's\n\nintended direction would at once enable\n\nthe squatters of North east Australia to drive\n\ntheir surplus of flocks and herds easily across to\n\na well watered hilly and grassy country within\n\nclose proximity of the harbors of the north west\n\ncoast\n\nto accomplish then, with a new search for\n\nDr Leichhardt, the geographical and industrial\n\nobjects also, for which that great explorer set\n\nout on his last enterprise, we have to choose between\n\ntwo positions as starting points The\n\nnext traveller has either to follow Leichhardt\n\nfrom the spots to which he was traced on\n\ntributaries of the Flinders River, and then to\n\nproceed on the southern full of the inland\n\ncountry, in a direction towards the Murchison\n\nRiver, or some other position on the west coast\n\nto which, by the features of the unexplored in\n\ntenor, he may be led ; or he may advance from\n\nthe remotest resources of the Murchison i River\n\napproximately on an E. N. E. course towards\n\nCentral Mount Stuart leaving Termination\n\nLake some degrees to the north, thence skirt\n\nthe supposed desert country on his way to\n\nCarpentaria Considering that the settlers\n\nof Queensland are rapidly advancing west\n\nward we may trust that the eastern half of\n\nAustralia will thus, ere long, be explored In\n\ndeed, it is the dark of the western half of the\n\ncontinent to which the torch of science is now\n\nto be carried The object is one of glory, and\n\nworthy of manly strides It (would be the great\n\nfinal stroke for Australian geography-it would\n\ngive us a base line, from which future detail\n\noperations would diverge with facility\n\nLet us hope, then, that the next cool season\n\nwill see the discoverer of Lake Barlee again in\n\nthe field, that he may start from the remotest\n\nsources of the river Murchison in March, and\n\nthat he may reach the Carpentaria settlements\n\nbefore the heat of the following summer\n\nscorches the arid plains, and renders the toil of\n\nhis march still more severe And even if, in all\n\nhis youthful elasticity and energy he should\n\ncope in Vam with a country of inclemency and\n\na season of terror, a bold man even then can\n\nwin for us again new territorial acquisitions\n\nfrom the vast unknown interior, and effect,\n\nby good generalship, his retreat always in\n\nsafety The prospect is however, cheering\n\nThe mountains of the north west coast,\n\noccasionally rising to three and four\n\nthousand feet, must send long courses of drum\n\nand in an easterly direction and thus afford\n\nthe means of leaning easily for a long distance\n\non safe lines of water supply We also know\n\nthat no scrubs so impracticable exist in the\n\nnorthern part of the continent as impede so\n\nmuch the progress in the deserts of the south\n\nIt is to be regretted that dromedaries are not\n\navailable to Mr Forrest, or any other leader\n\nwho may start from the remotest waters of the\n\nMurchison River But as in all probability an\n\neasy overland road from Carpentaria, where the\n\nVictorian camels are still kept, would be formed\n\nby the intended expedition from West Aus-\n\ntralia, the animals might soon find their way to\n\nthe west coast, where they would more i caddy\n\nbecome available for new planet travels, through\n\nportions of ill watered and grassless country,\n\nthan in Queensland\n\nThe writer, in stepping with his modest\n\ndesign before those who made Australia their\n\nhome, and who owe to this great Southern land\n\na happy and prosperous independence, claims\n\nthat consideration which is due to his dis\n\ninterested advocacy, more so as the fate of\n\nLeichhardt would long have been revealed had\n\nhe left behind him in this country any descendants,\n\nbecause these never would have\n\nceased to urge his rights The writer also\n\nclaims that consideration which is due to him\n\nself as an extensive traveller in this continent\n\nfor the advancement of which he has labored\n\nhere uninterruptedly for twenty two years He\n\nhopes to be spared in future the pain of being\n\ncalled on to argue Leichhardt's case with those\n\nwho conceal a want of generosity, and an\n\nabsence of recognition of a public duty towards\n\na great, probably perished, man of our time, by\n\npronouncing the search for the living as hope\n\nless He defends his position in upholding\n\nLeichhardt's case, on the grounds of that\n\nhumanity which demands from us to in\n\nquire into his fate, whatever Providence may\n\nhave destined it to be A later age will erect,\n\nin honor of the boat to another and his companions,\n\nmonuments, and will cherish in living gratis\n\nmade, his memory, while columns of marble or\n\nore sink into dust, but it devolves on those\n\ncontemporaneous with Leichhardt to ascertain\n\nthe place and circumstances of his death Co\n\nnumbers, in his western passage, unfolded to the\n\neastern world the wonders of a new continent\n\nSir John Franklin perished among polar fees,\n\nbut did accomplish a north western passage, to\n\nperform which the minds of navigators were\n\nagitated for centuries May not Leichhardt\n\nhave discovered f ><. rib long ago, also, a western\n\npassage, by which the red cross, the commerce,\n\nand the abodes of our great continent or to be\n\nimmeasurably enlarged ?\n\nWithin a few months, a century has elapsed\n\nsince Cook took possession of Australia for the\n\nBritish Crown Let this j Jubilee be the occasion\n\nof redeeming our debt towards the lost explorer,\n\nin drawing the veil which yet obscures his fate\n\nManmno's Preserved Meat Mr Joubert\n\nthe secretary to the Agricultural Society, writing\n\nto Mr Manning says I am instructed\n\nby the council of this society to state that the\n\ncases of meat preserved by you and placed in\n\nmy hands on the 2nd of April last, have been\n\ntested in accordance with the concern is of the\n\nprize schedule of the late Intercolonial I exhibit\n\ntion viz ; 100 lbs of meat preserved uncooked\n\nto be placed in the charge of the Agricultural\n\nSociety for a period of six months, and that the\n\nresults are as follows -- On the 4th of May\n\nseveral tins were opened by the judges and pronounced\n\nto be good, deserving the gold medal of\n\nheredity S Mort Esq 2 On the thor Juno\n\na tin of the same meat was opened by the scion\n\nrifle committee and found in good order 3\n\nOn the 6th instant, in accordance with your request,\n\ntwo tins were examined by the council,\n\nwho unanimously declared the contents to be in\n\nan excellent state of preservation the six\n\nmonths having now expired I inn instructed to\n\nnotify to you that the trial has proved most\n\nsatisfactory, the meat being apparently us fresh\n\nnow as when exhibited in Moj ' Mr. Manning\n\nwrites to the 's 31 Herald as follows\n\n-\"Having received (so enclosed documents\n\nfrom the secretary of the Agriculture Society,\n\nI am advised by my friends to hand them over\n\nto you to make them public, as they are supposed\n\nto have equal interest with the public as\n\nwith myself Imiv herewith mention that I\n\nhave turned up some 17 000 tins of fresh meats\n\nin Queensland during the last winter and that\n\nthe major part of this stock has gone home in\n\nvarious ships from Brisbane and Sydney The\n\nfirst of these new mcatsmuBl have reached Eng\n\nland by this time, in the ship Ramsey from\n\nBrisbane We are waiting results of these ship\n\nmonth before I proceed with the works on an\n\nextensive scale I may mention that I am not\n\nwithout apprehension that we used too first time\n\nfor the weight of meat packed in them no 1 that\n\nany concussion of the parties may lead to the\n\nopening of the seams, and cause some of the\n\n1 a monte to perish lines, however, being only a\n\nJ mere working error, and can be reached in\n\nby future operations, it may, therefore be assumed\n\n9 that meals can be Edit home as safely under my\n\n1 process, as they have kept here \""
