Her father, my grandfather Yaacov, was a shoemaker and was kept alive by the Germans due to this profession, along with his friend, Binyomin Gitlitz, the tailor. My grandmother, now deceased, was born Golda Alperovitz. My mother is now 75; she was 11 to 12 years old during most of these events. Her family ran away from the town prior to the final massacre and lived in the forest until liberation. Thank you for this wonderful site; it has truly touched me. Due to spelling differences and my mother's insistance that she is from Lithuania, not Belarus, I haven't ever found any information before on the town she was from.\n\nLinda Pressman <lindajpr@hotmail.com>\n\n- Tuesday, March 14, 2006 at 19:26:08 (EST) LOS ANGELES, March 10 Three weeks ago, Dr. Wafa Sultan was a largely unknown Syrian-American psychiatrist living outside Los Angeles, nursing a deep anger and despair about her fellow Muslims.----- Today, thanks to an unusually blunt and provocative interview on Al Jazeera television on Feb. 21, she is an international sensation, hailed as a fresh voice of reason by some, and by others as a heretic and infidel who deserves to die. In the interview, which has been viewed on the Internet more than a million times and has reached the e-mail of hundreds of thousands around the world, Dr. Sultan bitterly criticized the Muslim clerics, holy warriors and political leaders who she believes have distorted the teachings of Muhammad and the Koran for 14 centuries. She said the world's Muslims, whom she compares unfavorably with the Jews, have descended into a vortex of self-pity and violence. Dr. Sultan said the world was not witnessing a clash of religions or cultures, but a battle between modernity and barbarism, a battle that the forces of violent, reactionary Islam are destined to lose. In response, clerics throughout the Muslim world have condemned her, and her telephone answering machine has filled with dark threats. But Islamic reformers have praised her for saying out loud, in Arabic and on the most widely seen television network in the Arab world, what few Muslims dare to say even in private. \"I believe our people are hostages to our own beliefs and teachings,\" she said in an interview this week in her home in a Los Angeles suburb. Dr. Sultan, who is 47, wears a prim sweater and skirt, with fleece-lined slippers and heavy stockings. Her eyes and hair are jet black and her modest manner belies her intense words: \"Knowledge has released me from this backward thinking. Somebody has to help free the Muslim people from these wrong beliefs.\" Perhaps her most provocative words on Al Jazeera were those comparing how the Jews and Muslims have reacted to adversity. Speaking of the Holocaust, she said, \"The Jews have come from the tragedy and forced the world to respect them, with their knowledge, not with their terror; with their work, not with their crying and yelling.\" She went on, \"We have not seen a single Jew blow himself up in a German restaurant. We have not seen a single Jew destroy a church. We have not seen a single Jew protest by killing people.\" She concluded, \"Only the Muslims defend their beliefs by burning down churches, killing people and destroying embassies. This path will not yield any results. The Muslims must ask themselves what they can do for humankind, before they demand that humankind respect them.\" Her views caught the ear of the American Jewish Congress, which has invited her to speak in May at a conference in Israel. \"We have been discussing with her the importance of her message and trying to devise the right venue for her to address Jewish leaders,\" said Neil B. Goldstein, executive director of the organization. She is probably more welcome in Tel Aviv than she would be in Damascus. Shortly after the broadcast, clerics in Syria denounced her as an infidel. One said she had done Islam more damage than the Danish cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad, a wire service reported. DR. SULTAN is \"working on a book that if it is published it's going to turn the Islamic world upside down.\" \"I have reached the point that doesn't allow any U-turn. I have no choice. I am questioning every single teaching of our holy book.\" The working title is, \"The Escaped Prisoner: When God Is a Monster.\" Dr. Sultan grew up in a large traditional Muslim family in Banias, Syria, a small city on the Mediterranean about a two-hour drive north of Beirut. Her father was a grain trader and a devout Muslim, and she followed the faith's strictures into adulthood. But, she said, her life changed in 1979 when she was a medical student at the University of Aleppo, in northern Syria. At that time, the radical Muslim Brotherhood was using terrorism to try to undermine the government of President Hafez al-Assad. Gunmen of the Muslim Brotherhood burst into a classroom at the university and killed her professor as she watched, she said. \"They shot hundreds of bullets into him, shouting, 'God is great!' \" she said. \"At that point, I lost my trust in their god and began to question all our teachings. It was the turning point of my life, and it has led me to this present point. I had to leave. I had to look for another god.\" She and her husband, who now goes by the Americanized name of David, laid plans to leave for the United States. Their visas finally came in 1989, and the Sultans and their two children (they have since had a third) settled in with friends in Cerritos, Calif., a prosperous bedroom community on the edge of Los Angeles County. After a succession of jobs and struggles with language, Dr. Sultan has completed her American medical licensing, with the exception of a hospital residency program, which she hopes to do within a year. David operates an automotive-smog-check station. They bought a home in the Los Angeles area and put their children through local public schools. All are now American citizens.BUT even as she settled into a comfortable middle-class American life, Dr. Sultan's anger burned within. She took to writing, first for herself, then for an Islamic reform Web site called Annaqed (The Critic), run by a Syrian expatriate in Phoenix.An angry essay on that site by Dr. Sultan about the Muslim Brotherhood caught the attention of Al Jazeera, which invited her to debate an Algerian cleric on the air last July.In the debate, she questioned the religious teachings that prompt young people to commit suicide in the name of God. \"Why does a young Muslim man, in the prime of life, with a full life ahead, go and blow himself up?\" she asked. \"In our countries, religion is the sole source of education and is the only spring from which that terrorist drank until his thirst was quenched.\"Her remarks set off debates around the globe and her name began appearing in Arabic newspapers and Web sites. But her fame grew exponentially when she appeared on Al Jazeera again on Feb. 21, an appearance that was translated and widely distributed by the Middle East Media Research Institute, known as Memri. Memri said the clip of her February appearance had been viewed more than a million times.\"The clash we are witnessing around the world is not a clash of religions or a clash of civilizations,\" Dr. Sultan said. \"It is a clash between two opposites, between two eras. It is a clash between a mentality that belongs to the Middle Ages and another mentality that belongs to the 21st century. It is a clash between civilization and backwardness, between the civilized and the primitive, between barbarity and rationality.\"She said she no longer practiced Islam. \"I am a secular human being,\" she said.The other guest on the program, identified as an Egyptian professor of religious studies, Dr. Ibrahim al-Khouli, asked, \"Are you a heretic?\" He then said there was no point in rebuking or debating her, because she had blasphemed against Islam, the Prophet Muhammad and the Koran.Dr. Sultan said she took those words as a formal fatwa, a religious condemnation. Since then, she said, she has received numerous death threats on her answering machine and by e-mail. One message said: \"Oh, you are still alive? Wait and see.\" She received an e-mail message the other day, in Arabic, that said, \"If someone were to kill you, it would be me.\"Dr. Sultan said her mother, who still lives in Syria, is afraid to contact her directly, speaking only through a sister who lives in Qatar. She said she worried more about the safety of family members here and in Syria than she did for her own.\"I have no fear,\" she said. \"I believe in my message. It is like a million-mile journey, and I believe I have walked the first and hardest 10 miles.\"\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nUSA - Monday, March 13, 2006 at 15:33:34 (EST) I went to Belarus in September/October of 2005.

Having copies of the ITS records at national Holocaust memorials in their countries would allow survivors and their families, as well as Holocaust scholars, to learn the fates of the victims and better understand the Holocaust itself. Many survivors die each year not knowing details of family members' deportation, incarceration, and death. The international community has a moral obligation to address this injustice. Over 60 years after the end of World War II, the ITS remains one of the few, and certainly the largest, closed archive on the Holocaust. At the end of the war, the Allied powers established the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen, Germany, to help reunite non-German families separated during the war and trace missing family members. Among other information, the vast collection includes massive documentation from concentration camps, slave labor camps and post-war displaced person camps. The ITS has performed important humanitarian functions. However, many families seeking information from the ITS receive responses only years after their requests were submitted, and often the information is inadequate or inaccurate. In addition to the Museum, the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors in New York, and the 24-nation Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research have demanded that the ITS comply with requests to open the archive and copy the records. Similar materials, though not on the same scale, have been available at archives such as Yad Vashem, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and other repositories in Europe. The ITS is failing to live up to the intent of the 2000 Stockholm Declaration to open Holocaust-era archives. All 11 governments on the International Commission of the ITS, the ITS's governing body, have endorsed the Declaration. For the past eight years the ITS and the ICRC in Geneva have said they would open the archive, and during the last two years, intensive negotiations have taken place. In practice, however, the ITS and the ICRC have consistently refused to cooperate with the International Commission board and have kept the archive closed. Museum Chairman Fred Zeidman said: \"There is a moral imperative to make these records available now. It is time for the ITS to give the victims their due and the survivors some closure.\" Ben Meed, president of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, emphasized that, \"At a time when antisemitism and Holocaust denial are on the rise, we survivors deserve access to this information and the reassurance that it will be open to scholars.\" SOURCE United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Web Site: http://www.ushmm.org\n\nhttp://www.ushmm.org\n\nUSA - Thursday, March 09, 2006 at 02:32:33 (EST) I received many emails about a very brave arab woman who said what she felt about killings in the name of Islam and her respect for Jews on Arab T,V- does anyone know who she is?- to see and hear what she said go to; http://switch5.castup.net/frames/20041020_MemriTV_Popup/video_480x360.asp?ai=214&ar;=1050wmv&ak;=null\n\nhttp://switch5.castup.net/frames/20041020_MemriTV_Popup/video_480x360.asp?ai=214&ar=1050wmv&ak=null\n\n- Tuesday, March 07, 2006 at 17:59:54 (EST) A note about the poet Moshe Kulbak. Born in Snorgon to Solmon and Zelda nee Gordon in 1896. His daughter; Raia Kulbak survived and lives in Ramat Gan, Israel since the 1990s'. Moshe and his family; wife, children Raia and Ilia, sister Tonia and her husband and daughter, His parents; Solomon and Zelda Kulbak, all lived in Minsk. Moshe and his wife weres taken to a camp by the soviets in 1937. The entire family, other the Raia and her mother, perished near Minsk in c 1942. It took Raia many years to find the details of her fathers death at the hands of the Soviets in 1937. I would like to thank Leon Koll for emailing a link to a site (in Russian) with a detailed story by Raia and another woman who lived with the family in Minsk during their last years ( 1937- 1942) I found a note; Date: March 18, 2004 From: ptureck@rogers.com Subject: Moyshe Kulbak, Vilne I am seeking material on Moyshe Kulbak's poem \"Vilne\". It can be found in Yiddish, and in translation in \"The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse\", edited by Khome Shmeruk, Irving Howe, and Ruth Wisse. Has anybody written an analysis of this poem, penned by Kulbak? I want to understand the poem, and its description of Vilne. I also would like to know if there is a university course in North America on \"Jewish Vilne\", Yerushalayim D'Lite, or a university course on \"The Multi-Ethnic Make-Up of Wilno/Vilnius\".

The first line of this request says it all. Rachelle Berliner Let no Holocaust Victim be Forgotten It is extremely important that we do not allow the Nazis to obliterate the memory of those they and their cohorts murdered. As you will see below, half of the six million have been remembered at Yad Vashem. But that means that three million are still missing. Please take the time to make certain that each and every members of your family who perished during the Shoah are recorded at Yad Vashem. You can access their website and do your own search. The urgency of the matter is that 60 years after the Shoah ended, those who remember our brothers and sisters who were killed are becoming fewer and fewer. New Community Outreach Guide For Holocaust Remembrance Let no Holocaust Victim be Forgotten Dear Friends, Yad Vashem invites you to join the historic mission of the Jewish people to memorialize every individual Jew who perished in the Holocaust through the collection of the ultimate representation of their identity: their names. To date, half of the six million victims have been recorded in the Central Database of Shoah Victims Names (www.yadvashem.org), where one may access their brief histories and, when available, their photographs, and submit additional names online. Millions of victims may be forgotten forever, unless we recover their names today. We are pleased to offer a new online community outreach guide to initiate local Names Recovery Campaigns. Packed with valuable resources and materials, this free guide will enable Jewish communities to plan and implement meaningful memorial programs, names collection events and related activities around Yom Hashoah - Israels national Holocaust Remembrance Day (this year, 25 April) and other significant dates in the Jewish calendar, such as 10th Tevet, 17th Tammuz, 9th Av, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The guide is designed for use either by an individual or group, such as a synagogue, community center, welfare agency, survivor and next generation group, university or school. You can use it to call upon members of your community or organization to complete a Page of Testimony for each unregistered victim, or to volunteer to assist others with this urgent task. To access the Community Outreach Guide visit: http://www1.yadvashem.org/names/whyCollect.htm Join today, before the generation that remembers is no longer with us.\n\nwww.yadvashem.org\n\n- Tuesday, February 28, 2006 at 17:28:04 (EST) I have carefully, but unsuccessfully, searched the EPSTEIN genealogical tables that Dr. Neil Rosenstein has published in his book \"The Luria Legacy\" for Rabbi Yitzhak Mordechai (HaLevy) EPSTEIN, who lived in either Kossovo or Slonim, or both. He lived c. 1820-1880. His relative Nechemia EPSTEIN (same estimated dates) most likely lived in Slonim. Rabbi Yitzhak Mordechai had six children including a son, Yosef (Joseph) and five daughters. He and Nechemia each had a daughter called Chaya (Ida), both of whom lived in Kossovo prior to their immigration to the U.S.. Can anyone direct me to other sources, preferably in English, or - only if fairly well organized - in Hebrew, but not Yiddish, and where I can find them? I live in Israel and would need to be able to access the material here. If anyone can offer me information on either of the above EPSTEINs, I shall be grateful. Irene Berman Shoham, Israel\n\n-\n\n- Monday, February 27, 2006 at 20:18:00 (EST) Maybe somebody can help me pursue this problem. I found the Volozhin yizkor book and it has a lot of information about my ancestors Rabbi Chaim Volozhin and his son Itzele (1780-1849). It gives the names of four of Itzele's children, Eliyohu Zalmen, Rivke, Reyne-Basye, and Rekhl. But it also mentions two others without giving their names. How can I find out what their names were. I don't think that this is impossible because according to historian Michael Stanislawski, Itzele was probably the best known Russian Jew in his generation.

My mother, Judith, (Yudis), lives here in Florida. 1964--- Sheri G Mantzoor---- Marvin Ginsburg -- Last Residence: 33066 Pompano Beach, Broward, Florida --- Born: 26 Jun 1906 --- Died: 2 Sep 2005 --- State (Year) SSN issued: New York (Before 1951 ) ---- --------\n\nSheri Ginsburg Mantzoor\n\nBoca Raton , USA - Monday, February 20, 2006 at 14:49:57 (EST) Dear Siggers An acrostic on the headstone of my gr grandfather Abraham ben Isaac Levi SOLOVEICHIK (1838-1918) declares him to be a descendent of 'Itsele'. Based on some other facts, I am assuming that Itsele refers to Rabbi Yitskhok ben Khayim VOLOZHINER (1780-1849.) Abraham was an Israel so if he is a descendant of Rabbi Yitskhok who was a Cohen it would have to be on the maternal side. Given their dates it would seem most likely that Abraham's father, Isaac, married a daughter or grand daughter of Rabbi Yitskhok. In the 'Unbroken Chain', R. Yitskhok is shown as having three daughters, Rechl, Reyne-Basye and Rivke, but all married other men. So I am considering three possibilities 1. One of the daughters listed was married more than once and one of her husbands was Isaac. 2. There was another daughter, not listed, who married Isaac. 3. One of R. Yitskhok's grand daughters married Isaac. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has information about this. Regards Charles ----------------------- Charles Nydorf wrote ; I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has information about the daughters of Rabbi Itsele Volozhiner (Itzhok) Moshe Porat, the g g grandson of Rabbi Itsele Volozhiner wrote; As for Charles Nydorf question; Rabbi Itsele Volozhiner (Itzhok) was Rabbi Hayim Volozhiner's (Yeshiva Eytz Hayim Founder) son. Reb Itsele's children were: Daughter; Reine Bashe - married Harav Naftali Zvi Berlin HANAZIV Daughter; Rivka - married Rabbi Eliezer Itzhok Fried Daughter Rehl - married Samuel Landau Son Eliyahu Zalman - He called himself and his children by the second name ITZHAYKIN. His grand daughter; Malka Itshaykin (my father's mother) inherited the big stone house (Beys Harav) on the south rib of the Volozhin Market Place and lived there during the twenties/thirties of the past century.

I compiled tree of his descendants, which is incomplete. I would love to be in touch to add your knowledge to what I have. Part of the family appears in my book THE UNBROKEN CHAIN. Below is what I know about Rehl/Rechel from my FTW file. I also assume that you are connected to the Rivlins as is Menachem Porat?

Freydele di Rebetsn - born in Volozhin deceased in Jerusalem. Freydele's husband Avigdor Derechinski served as Rov in Volozhin (late twenties, early thirties XXth century. Di Rebetsn and my Grandma, Babushka Malka Perlman (born Itshaykin) were best friends. As little boy I was invited to Freidele's Rabbinical Sukot diner. Her first son Moshe Zalman Ben Sasson (Lunz) was the first family member to make Aliya. He replaced his second name to Ben Sasson (Son of Joy - as his mother was called.- Freyd is Joy) The whole family made aliya after Moshe Zalman. Moshe Zalman was murdered by Arab terrorists near Yavniel in 1937. The sons Hayim Hilel and Yona were professors in the Jerusalem University. Her grand kids live now in Jerusalem. Yona's eldest son Professor Menahem Ben Sasson is serving as Rector of the Jerusalem Hebrew University.

You could find many of the family graves in the Volozhin Jewish cemetery. You could find Jewish cemeteries all over Belarus. Some are in very good shape. You need a visa to travel to Belarus. I got a visa in Vilnius a day before I crossed the border ( It took about 2 hours) - Did yoy check the site and the Yizkor book for Ivenits(Ivenec)? Do you have pictures to post on the site?\n\nrichard persky <rpersky@tintsdirect.co.uk>\n\n- Friday, February 17, 2006 at 19:20:04 (EST) By Bradley Burston -----------------Haaretz--- There is something that gives Jews and Muslims alike a perverse thrill in calling the other a Nazi. Maybe that's why we can't seem to stop. Both sides ought to know better. Particularly ours. We know this better than anyone: Whenever the Nazis are invoked to condemn an enemy - no matter how brutal - the enormity, the singularity, the very fact of the Holocaust, is diminished. Leveraging the Holocaust to condemn a foe ultimately plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers. If enough leaders are compared to Adolf Hitler, and if the range is wide enough to include George Bush and Yasser Arafat, we could be excused for concluding that Hitler was, in fact, just one of the gang, no different than the rest, no worse. Knowing this doesn't stop us, though. It doesn't even slow us down. The ink had hardly dried on the Palestinian election figures, when a campaigning Benjamin Netanyahu compared the triumph of Hamas with the rise of Hitler and Nazism in the 1930s. The fact is, never before have there been so many ways to deny the Holocaust. Nor more people so keen on taking part. We know very well, for example, why Muslims worldwide call us Nazis. Because it works. When Palestinians, Iranians, or, for that matter, residents of Detroit, call Israelis Nazis, people listen. Europeans love hearing it, of course, because it gets them off the hook. If the Jews are Nazis, they note, then we're all even. Europeans, hearing this, no longer have to feel guilty about having looked the other way, or having pitched right in, when the actual Nazis turned the world's strongest community of Jews into ash. Western leftists who suffer from the Lawrence of Arabia Complex are especially fond of the image of the IDF soldier as SS man, an analogy that jibes well both with omniscient, oversimplified abused-to-abuser sociobabble, and with many academic leftists' multi-syllabic cartoon vision of world events and foreign peoples. They lap it up when Muslims condemn Israel for Nazification, when they call Gaza the world's biggest concentration camp, or when they cite deportation as evidence of genocide. The Nazified Israeli soldier chestnut also frees Muslims from whatever guilt they might otherwise feel when terrorism cuts down innocent people. When defending oneself against ultimate evil, our Muslim cousins assure us, all means are entirely legitimate. There remains, however, an element of such perversity in calling Israelis Nazis that the lies begin to unravel of their own weight. The perversity is especially evident when radical settlers cast themselves in the role of Holocaust victims, wearing Star of David patches and calling Israeli troops Nazis to their faces. Far more insidious, in some ways, is the collective amnesia of the Internet, which is uniquely suited to Holocaust denial through over-analogization. In the era of the e-news junkie, paranoia is the new pornography. And nothing says My Enemy is a Nazi like paranoia. The compulsion to use the term is such that it has spawned Godwin's Law, which states that \"As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.\" At this point, more than 60 years after the last of the extermination camps was freed, the horror of the Holocaust has so receded from the collective memory that the words Soup Nazi can elicit gales of sitcom laughter. As the shock wears off, the spin-offs multiply: grammar nazi, fashion nazi, feminazi. And as the spin-offs gain currency, the term nazi can stretch to fit any annoyance. At this point, we can apply it to any vaguely persnickety individual we don't much care for. If anyone can be a nazi, perhaps the real Nazis were no worse than the rest of us. To be fair, if we Jews can't keep ourselves from comparing our enemies to the Nazis, we have, if nothing else, two good excuses. One is our tradition. The many sections of our liturgy that inform us that They're Out to Get Us. We drink it in, if not with mothers' milk, then with Passover wine. \"For not one man only has risen up against us to destroy us, but in every generation do men rise up against us to destroy us,\" we intone, warming up for the Ten Plagues. And if not with Passover wine, then with Purim schnapps, as we toast the failure of an ancient, aborted genocide plan for Persian Jewry. The second reason, of course, is that there actually are men who rise up against us, generation after generation, in order to destroy us. And the generation time is growing shorter and shorter. Only 15 years separate Saddam Hussein's declared Gulf War goal of incinerating Israel, and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's recent suggestion that the Jewish state be wiped off the map. All the while, the holy men of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic Jihad have been preaching our elimination. And yet. The Jewish People owe it to the victims of the Holocaust and the survivors still with us, to resist the impulse to liken current threats - as dangerous as and potentially cataclysmic as they may be - to an event of biblical magnitude in the long history of the Jews. The most insidious form of Holocaust denial, after all, reduces the annihilation of six million people to just one more rhetorical argument over current issues. All we can offer the victims and the survivors, is to honor their memory by reminding ourselves and others of the incomparable uniqueness of their unknowable hell. Enough comparisons. Enough cynicism. Let it stop with us.\n\n,\n\n- Friday, February 17, 2006 at 08:44:45 (EST) My father \"Samuel David Bingman\" a survivor of Lodz, just died on his birthday November 24, 2005 Bruce Bingman (brucebingman@gmail.com) Name: Samuel D Bingman Birth Date: 1932 City: Chevy Chase Margaret L Bingman\n\nBruce Bingman <brucebingman@gmail.com>\n\nUSA - Friday, February 17, 2006 at 07:37:55 (EST) A note from the Jewishgen digest;Subject: Success Wainer (Winner) Searching SHEPSENVOL and ZIGLIN From: Bopollack@aol.com Beyond our expectation. I grew up with the name Tzak Springer on my lips. My grandfather lost contact with his sisters during WWII. The only name my mother could remember was that one of his sisters married a Tsak Springer. After 64 years thanks to many most kind and vigilant people including Eilat Gordin, the son of Tzak and Shifra has been found in Israel. His name is Shepsel Shpringer. My cousin, Phyllis Grodzinsky Winstead and I are most grateful and very excited. We now learned that there might be family members in the US. The last names are ZIGLIN (family of Eli Ziglin) and the name SHEPSENVOL. (family of Zalmon and Nehama nee Wainer). Our grandfather was Yehuda (Yudel Mendel) Winner. He came to the US with his sister Rebecca Winner Barofsky. His sisters remained behind. They were Chaya, Nehama, and Shifra. It is the family of Shifra that has been found. There is a possibility that some of Chaya's (Ziglin) and Nehama's (Shepsenvol) family survived also. We are searching in the US for the family of Eli Ziglin who was said to have come here. Perhaps the Shepsenvol family as well. Bonnie Mogelever Pollack You could find a huge family tree of the Shepsenvol family of Horodok and Volozhin in Family tree of the Jewish people. Two daughters of that family ( from Volozin) came out of Vina at the start of the war with \"Shugiara Visa\" .

I came accross your web site while surfing the web (with my daughter's help as I am not very technical). My name is Miki Pear and I am a survivor from Warsaw but was in the Stolin Ghetto then hidden by righteous Christians in a small village nearby. Before that, I was (age 5) with my parents in Luniniecz. I am doing research and writing my memoire. Can you help me? What I am looking for is any and all details regarding the Soviet (then Nazi) occupation and destruction of the region. Memorial Books of both ghettos are being translated for me now from Hebrew and Yiddish to English (I do not speak either), but any additional information or contacts you could provide would be tremendously helpful.

After riveting the attentions of thousands of Jews throughout the world over the past two decades, Jewish genealogy and family history has reached a level of maturity that makes it ripe to take its place in the academic world. To that end, the new Institute has two main aims to engage in Jewish genealogical research and teaching at the university level and to make Jewish Genealogy a recognized academic discipline within the realm of Jewish Studies. The Institute is the only one of its kind in the Jewish world. It plans to operate on an interdisciplinary basis and also in a collaborative way with organizations engaged in aspects of Jewish genealogy. It will put a premium on innovative programmes and projects of practical benefit to individual family historians. Its establishment is the result of efforts over the last two years of an international Founding Committee, headed by Dr. Sallyann Sack, Ph.D., of Washington, DC. Dr. Yosef Lamdan, D.Phil., has been appointed as Director of the Institute. Its telephone numbers are +972-(0)2-658-6967 and +972-(0)526-622-624. Its email address is info@IIJG.org and its home page is located at www.IIJG.org (under construction). Editors/journalists interested in interviews or \"human interest\" stories are invited to contact the Director.\n\nwww.IIJG.org\n\n- Monday, February 06, 2006 at 10:11:56 (EST) Results of search for victims whose family name (including synonyms and maiden names) is 'Szereszewski ' : 339 names ----------------------------------- Shereshevski* Tzvi- Tzvi Shereshevski was born in Kovno, Lithuania to Shmuel and Cheina nee Levitan in 1933.

It was wonderful to find this, as I am currently trying to find out what happened to my father's large family in Poland/Bylorussia after the war. I know that Rabbi Menachem Mendel died in America in 1929 when he was 83. My grandfather (his brother) Abraham recorded this event in the short family hisory he wrote before he died. My grandfather died when I was one, so I never knew him. Therefore, I got a lot of pleasure to see his brother today. Thank you once again.\n\nLouisa Spivack <louspiv@yahoo.co.uk>\n\n- Tuesday, January 31, 2006 at 03:38:22 (EST) seth persky (perskys@comcast.net) on Monday, Message: discovered your site as i am compiling family history. wow! my name is seth persky, son of marshall and sheila persky. i live in the detroit area. i am trying to find information out on my father's side of the family, persky. his mother and father were rita persky (rita Singer before marriage/ family named was Persinger before arriving in america) and Samuel Persky, who died when my father was just 9 years old (would have been around 1953). i know virtually nothing about him. my grandmother recently died and in looking through old photos, no one seemed to recognize anyone. i know little to nothing about my family history, other than they came from Lithuania. have found some helpful information on this website but little else on internet. there is an old family story how one of my ancestors was a guard for the tsar, and when he was killed, the family came to america, but have little information on the name, the area, etc... any help or direction would be g! really appreciated-------------------------------\n\nseth persky <perskys@comcast.net>\n\nUSA - Tuesday, January 31, 2006 at 03:34:36 (EST) Keith Levit (klevit@shaw.ca) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: Comment Home Page: http://www.keithlevitphotography.com Message: You may be interested in my return to the shtetl web-site http://www.keithlevitphotography.com/exhibitions/shtetlindex.html It was an amazing journey back to my roots - my zaida Velodie Levit and baba Malke karasick\n\nKeith Levit (klevit@shaw.ca)\n\n- Tuesday, January 31, 2006 at 03:31:10 (EST) From the internet; Hello, My grandfather's name was Yudel Mendel Winner or Wiener/Wienner. He came over from Minsk with his sister, my tante Becka (Rebecca). His mom's name was Hilda and my cousin says the husband was Gordon ( Gutel). She was a stern one! He had 4 sisters and we lost contact with them after WW2. Hilda and Gordon previously had managed an apple orchard in Minsk. Does this make any sense? Yudel and my baube lived in St.Albans, Vt. They had 10 children (3died at birth, one was mentallly retarded). Make any more sense? My cousin is also looking for those missing sisters--one married Ytzhak Shpringer? Any infor would be appreciated------------- Hello! I'm Phyllis Grodzinsky and my grandfather was Julius (Judel Mendel) Winner. It wasn't originally Winner and I've been scouring the Ellis Isle Website (can't remember how to get back there!) for a Wiener,Wienner, Weiner, Weinner to no avail. He had 5 sisters and I understand he came over with my Tante Becca ( Rebecca Winner married David Barofsky and settled in Elkton, MD.) from Minsk. I guess his parents managed an orchard around there and I guess Minsk was not such a good area for the Jews) (was there any good area?) We don't know what happened to the 4 other sisters. I guess my cousin Bonnie says that one of them married a Springer (interesting, like Jerry) --------------------------- Dear Phyllis, I spoke to Shepsel Shpringer ( born in 1923) today. He told me that his mother; Shifra nee Winer, had a brother Yehuda Winer in America who had many children. He also knows of a sister of his mother who came to America. Three Winer sisters did not come to America. His mother Shifra married Ytzhak Shpringer and Lived in Horodok with 8 children, Only he survived as a partisan and later in the Red Army ( two of his brothers were with him and killed as fighters. Another sister married a Shpsenwol and lived in Horodok with 7 children. They all perished. One married a Zoldin and lived in Minsk. He found her son after the war and they are in touch with the children in Minsk. The family Winer originated in a tiny town east of Minsk Shepsel Shpringer has a son ( Ytzhak Shpringer) and a daughter. He has six grandchildren and some great grandchildren. He was always hoping to find the family of his mother in America and was unable sine Winer is a common name.\n\n.\n\n- Sunday, January 29, 2006 at 14:39:31 (EST) Yves Sobel (webmaster@levinas100.org) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Message: Congratulations for this exceptionally valuable and informative site!

I believe Shepsel (Sabtai)Shpringer to be my second cousin. I believe my mgf Julius (Judel Mendel Winer or Vainer) was his mother's brother. His mother's (Shifra) parents, of course were my great grandparents, Godel and Hilda (Hinda). I used to stare at their picture over the wall in my grandmother's guest bedroom! Julius was the only male with about five sisters and no one even knew their names. Just that all correspondence stopped abruptly and no one ever heard from them again. All me and my cousin Bonnie Mogelever Pollack had was a name Tzak or Jack Shpringer until I went on the Yad Vashem website and pulled up a memory and a tragedy knowing that Shepsel had siblings that also perished. I read that he was a partisan. That would be typical for the \"tough as nails\" Winner (my grandfather changed his name) side of the family. If anyone has any info please, please, e-mail me double quick. I'm 51 and there is so much more I need to know!!

Bronfman was hit by a passing car during a morning walk near her apartment. Her funeral will be held on Friday on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Vice Premier Shimon Peres, who are friends of the family, were notified of her death. In 2002, when Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem, he gave Andrea Bronfman the key to the city. Advertisement Andrea Bronfman was born in Britain in 1945 to parents who were active in the Zionist Movement. Her father, Haim Morrison, headed the United Jewish Appeal in the U.K. In June 1982, she married Charles. The couple did not have children together and Bronfman had three children from a previous marriage. The couple used to divide their time between New York and Jerusalem, where they would stay in Bronfman's parents' apartment in the Talbieh neighborhood. The Bronfmans are among the world's leading Jewish philanthropists. The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Foundation supports a broad spectrum of organizations and institutions in the field of education, welfare and strengthening Jewish identity. Andrea Bronfman was an art collector who devoted much of her time to supporting cultural institutions and artists. She was also active in the campaign for Soviet Jewry. The couple also invested in Israel's business sector over the years and are among the owners of the Koor concern. Jewish Agency chair Ze'ev Bielsky said Bronfman's death was \"a huge loss to the Jewish people and Israel.\" The birthright program, of which Bronfman was one of the founders, said \"Andrea's death is a terrible loss.\" The World Jewish Congress today joined Jews in communities around the world in mourning the untimely passing of Andrea Bronfman. \"Andrea Bronfman was a pillar of her family and the entire Jewish community. She was an activist as well as a philanthropist,\" said Israel Singer and Stephen E. Herbits, chairman of the World Jewish Congress Policy Council and secretary-general. \"Her way was that of the Jewish matriarchs and her passing leaves a void that can never be filled... She was cut off in the prime of her life,\" they added.\n\n.\n\n- Monday, January 23, 2006 at 19:16:02 (EST) Subject: ROSNER From Krakow From: Abuwasta Abuwasta Date: Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:24:15 -0800 (PST) X-Message-Number: 1 My name is Jacob Rosen from Jerusalem. I am the son of the late Leon Leib Rosner (1903-1999) who was the youngest child of Jakub Chiel Rosner and Ittla Borgenicht. My father was convinced until his death that he was the only survivor from his family and barely spoke about his brother and 4 sisters. He never mentioned their given names or married names. Last year I managed to find out that a son of my father's sister Channa, Reuven Orschutzer (b.1925), survived and lives in Israel. He gave me the names of the other siblings of my father. Following that I discovered via Yad Vashem that the son of his brother Abraham Meyer, Rudy (b.1920), survived as well and lives in Florida. We reunited last year in Jerusalem (they had not seen each other since 1938). Now I have more or less the list of my father's siblings: 1. Abraham Meyer b. 1890 in Gdow .Disappeared in the USSR. 2. Channa Orschutzer b. 1894/5 in Gdow. Perished in the Holocaust. 3. Erna /Esther Susskind b.1896? in Gdow .Perished in the Holocaust. 4. Beila /Berta (surname unknown) b. 1897-9 married and lived in Tarnow. Perished in the Holocaust Mechla/ Michalina b.1901 in Dobczyce. Was a Communist,married at a certain stage(surname unknown). Disappeared in USSR. 5. Leon Leib b. 1903 in Dobczyce (my father). My grandfather Jakub Chiel Rosner after whom I am named was born in 1866 in Dabrowa Tarnowska to Rubin Rosner and Malka Perlberg. My grandfather moved around 1905 to Krakowwhere he had a big storehouse of coal. My two surviving cousins are named after our ggrandfather Rubin. Mechla/Michalina is probably named after our ggrandmother Malka. All this info was constructed from www.shoreshim.org, JRI-PL, Yad Vashem and my cousins' memory. I wonder whether any one of you came across these names and may shed some light on the two aunts of me whose married names are not known to me.

Rome) ---- I believe I am a great grandson of one Shmuel Rome, whose son, Abraham Rome(or some Ellis Island variant of our unknown original name) had a brother , Aaron, murdered in a pogrom around 1905. Abraham immediately fled to the U.S. via Britain where relatives named Solomon kept him briefly. Soon after arriving in NYC, he moved on to New Haven, CT, married Fanny Solomon of Brighton Beach and raised a son, Sol (Solly, Zerach, my father) in New Haven. Do we have records of Zuslav gubernia? I'm desperate for more geneology but also would love to trace Grandpa's passage out of Lithuania. I suppose he could have sailed from anywhere- Melmel, Riga, who knows? As an interesting incidental, my maternal great grandfather, Avram Goldstein from Kiev, emmigrated with De Hirsch funds to Oxbow, Saskatchuan, before 1900 but eventually settled in New Haven and constructed all the housing around Yale University\n\nRichard S.

Does the rest of the world who are doing their roots know about it? Do the folks at Jewishgen.org know about it at least? I noticed the \"Gordin\" in your name. One of my great uncles, who I'm trying to track down might have used the name Gordan after leaving Russia. His brother definitely used it after he went to Egypt around the turn of the century (late 1800's). The name used by my great uncle here in the U.S. was \"Rubin.\" Have you traced yourself to Any Rubins, or Calofs, or Adelman? My gg grandfather was named \"Abraham Adelman\" here in the U.S. He settled with his wife Razel and family in Devils Lake North Dakota. They lived near the Calofs (which is rumoured to be our family name before Adelman), and the Mills and Soslofskys. If any of this rings any bells, I'd love to hear from you.

He lived at the home of Shmuel Alperovitz ( his daughter was Chaia Sade of Ramat Hakovesh. Her husband is alive in the Kibbutz and is now age 96! !- Dan Mendelson had relatives; Rudel Kaidanow,( sister of his uncle, Chaim Klotz of Ilja) and her children; Chaim and Alper who lived in Dolhinov. Could you ask the older people if they know anything about them? I did not find them on the list. I know that there was a Kaidanow family in Krivichi. There son ; Jerry ( a survivor) wrote me. I think that he said that his family was from Dolhinov. Thanks, Eilat -------------------- Shalom Eilat, I tried to find some answers to your queries. Yes, there was a Kaidanov family in Dolhinov, this was Laibe and Rutke Kaidanov with their three children: Shirle, Chaim and as you mentioned probably Alper ( I could not find out what was his exact name ). Laibe Kaidanov was Jerry Kaidanov's uncle ( Jerry and his brother survived and they live in the New York area). Rutke Kaidanov as it turned out was a cousin of my father Gavriel Rubin, she had siblings: Michle, Faigl and Avrom-Ele. All of them were murdered by the Germans in Dolhinov. I hope I was of some help. Have a happy Chanukah Holiday.

Sam was the President of the William Morris Theatrical Agency, the most prestigious in the business, and I was his executive secretary for three years, from 1976 to 1979. He was quite a character, quite well known for his savvy business knowledge, and for his idiosyncrasies....if someone there is interested and wants to e-mail me directly, I can relate some amusing and heartwarming stories about Sam. I liked him very much. I was much distressed to learn of his death; at that time I was married and no longer working for him. I hope this helps.

The answer may reveal more about yourself and your family history than you might think. You've heard of the Mason-Dixon Line? The 49th parallel? Well, there's also the \"gefilte fish line\" separating the Eastern European regions where Jewish palates once favored the sweet, from those that preferred the peppery varieties of the tasty traditional dish. Michael Steinlauf, who teaches Jewish studies at Gratz College in Philadelphia, told this to an audience at the 19th annual International Conference on Jewish Genealogy in New York last month. With some 1,200 participants, this year's conference was by far the largest to date, indicating the continued mushrooming of interest in genealogy among Jews. The \"gefilte fish line\" ran though eastern Poland. Jews living to the west -- most of Poland, as well as Germany and the rest of Western Europe -- ate the sweet gefilte fish. Those to the east -- Lithuania, Latvia and Russia -- ate the peppery version. But Steinlauf's tale is not just a fish story. It's also about language. He said the \"gefilte fish line\" roughly overlaps another important line: a linguistic divide between two major variants of Yiddish. Like Henry Higgins, the professor from \"My Fair Lady\" who could place Londoners by their accents, Yiddish linguists can determine a person's native region by his pronunciation of certain words. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that Jews' taste buds carry significant clues about their origins. Steinlauf wasn't the only speaker at the New York gathering to urge family-tree researchers to look around their own dinner tables and elsewhere in their homes for clues about the past. Rafael Guber, an American genealogist, artist and curatorial designer, spoke about \"Using Documents and Ephemera to Retrace Your Ancestors' Footsteps.\" Old prayerbooks, marriage contracts, ritual washing cups and phylacteries are among the items that may help understand how and where one's ancestors lived, Guber said. Prayerbooks, for instance, may indicate whether one's ancestors were Ashkenazim or Sephardim, and if Ashkenazim, whether they were Chassidim or their opponents, the Mitnagdim. Displaying photographs of various types of head coverings worn in the Old World, Guber indicated when and where each regional variant of the fashion could be found. Even a tombstone in an old photograph can offer a geographical clue, he explained, since only in central and western Galicia did tombstone carvers place clearly visible inset stones within larger tombstones. Guber ended his talk with a Jewish version of the popular British TV program \"Antiques Roadshow,\" inviting audience members to come forward with documents, photographs and other ephemera for instant and public evaluation. The boom in Jewish genealogy began in 1977 with the establishment in New York of the first postwar Jewish genealogical society. Today there are more than 80 such societies around the world, including groups in Belarus, Sweden, Jamaica and Brazil. One of the most successful innovations within the genealogical community has been JewishGen -- www.jewishgen.org -- an Internet information service that started in 1986 as a bulletin board for 150 people. It now sends out 30,000 pieces of e-mail daily and receives some 3 million hits on its Web site every day -- an increase of more than 600 percent over last year. Next year's Jewish genealogy conference is scheduled to take place in Salt Lake City in the summer of 2000. http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/12012/format/html/displaystory.html\n\n'\n\n- Tuesday, December 13, 2005 at 18:48:55 (EST) School told Nobel Prize winner in economics, `You're no good at math, try auto mechanics' ------------ By Tamara Traubman ------ At the yeshiva high school where he studied, he was told he was not very good in mathematics, and they advised him to choose something simpler, like auto mechanics. But yesterday, Professor Robert Aumann received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his mathematical research into game theory, together with American Thomas Schelling. Aumann, a professor at Hebrew University, received the $1.3 million prize from the hand of Sweden's king at a ceremony in Stockholm. Following the ceremony, the recipients were hosted at a festive dinner attended by diplomats, politicians, businessmen and members of the royal family. Aumann arrived in Sweden with his 35 children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as his new bride, Batya, the sister of his deceased first wife. \"We had tears in our eyes,\" said his son, Yonatan. \"It doesn't matter that we've known for a long time already; the excitement was enormous.\" According to the official announcement, Aumann and Schelling received the prize \"for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis.\" In remarks during the ceremony, the judges elaborated on this, crediting Aumann with having shown that when a particular situation repeats itself, the very fact that it does so provides opportunities for cooperation, even between parties to a conflict. \"War is not irrational,\" Aumann said earlier last week, adding that military preparedness is the best way to prevent war. \"During the long, dark days of the Cold War, peace was maintained because airplanes carrying nuclear weapons were in the air 24 hours a day.\" Two of Aumann's relatives went to Stockholm a week early to ensure that the arrangements would meet the Orthodox prize winner's religious requirements. In addition to arranging kosher food, they had to ensure that his tuxedo did not contain a forbidden mixture of linen and wool and rent a room near the hall where the ceremony would take place so that he would be able to set out after the end of Shabbat and still arrive on time. At the ceremony, awards were handed out to the prize winners not only in economics, but also in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. In medicine, the award went to Australians Barry Marshall and Robin Warren for proving that ulcers were caused by bacteria rather than stress. The literature prize went to British playwright Harold Pinter, who is ill with cancer and was therefore unable to attend, but gave a prerecorded speech in which he attacked U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair over the war in Iraq. Mohamed ElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency, of which he is the director general, jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize earlier yesterday. In his acceptance speech, ElBaradei said that if the world is to survive, there is no place for nuclear weapons in it. Therefore, he said, we must ensure both that no country obtains nuclear weapons, and that those that already have them, destroy them. Peace prize awards are often controversial, and this year's was no exception: The Greenpeace organization demonstrated both Friday and yesterday against the award to the IAEA, arguing that even nonmilitary uses of atomic energy, which it is the agency's job to promote, ought to be banned, as nuclear energy is dangerous both to the environment and to human beings. However, it is rare for the scientific prizes to arouse controversy. Thus the opposition to Aumann and Schelling's award was exceptional: Close to 1,000 people, including several dozen Israelis, signed a petition proclaiming it \"monstrous\" to award a Nobel prize to \"two war-mongers.\" The petition charged that the theory developed by Schelling encouraged the use of military force and helped inspire the U.S. bombing campaign during the Vietnam War, and it accused Aumann, who is right of center politically and belongs to the rightist organization Professors for a Strong Israel, of using game theory to justify Israeli control over the territories. Last year, two Israelis, Professors Aaron Ciechanover and Avram Hershko, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2002, Professor Daniel Kahneman, an Israeli working at Princeton University, was one of the winners of the economics prize.

He was 86. Mr. Shoolman grew up in Brookline and Marblehead, graduated from Harvard in 1941 and was an aviation cadet in World War II. After a brief career in the movie industry in Hollywood, Shoolman became a real estate developer like his father, Max Shoolman, who built the Metropolitan Theater, now known as the Wang Center, in Boston's theater district. Mr. Shoolman was one of the developers of the controversial Charles River Park residential complex near downtown Boston The upscale Charles River Park was built on 48 acres of the old West End neighborhood after it was cleared for redevelopment in the late 1950s. Critics said it was urban renewal run amok. The gritty neighborhood was home to 10,000 residents, but developers and city officials argued that the new complex would boost Boston's real estate economy and revitalize the city. The apartment and condominium complex, which includes Longfellow Place towers, today is home to 5,000 people. Developers in 1999 sold the last large piece of the complex for about $240 million to Chicago-based Equity Residential Properties Trust. Charles River Park is bounded by North Station, the Charles River, Beacon Hill, and Government Center.
