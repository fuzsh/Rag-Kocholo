Arguably Australia's most prominent 19th-century scientist, after his tenure at the Gardens, he went on to found the @royalsocietyvic . Numerous plants, animals, waterways, mountains, and journals have been named after von Mueller, whose legacy continues today. \n\nVon Mueller was interred just a stone's throw away from Melbourne Gardens in St Kilda Cemetery. It's a quiet place to visit and reflect, filled with history. As moss slowly creeps along with the faded text of long-standing memorials, one can't help but feel that nature is claiming a slow victory over the stones. Perhaps it's fitting that the Gardens first Director's resting place can be found here.\n\nðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¿\n\nIf you are keen to find out more, pop on some headphones, grab your walking shoes and discover Flora and the Baron, a thought-provoking and charming narrative audio tour by Bowerbird Theatre, as it provides an evocative soundtrack to the past, present, and future. ðŸŒ¿\n\nExplore the Gardens with Baron Ferdinand von Mueller's ghost and discover his joy in plants, his pride in exploration, the sadness of his failed love, the frustration of his exile from the Gardens, and his challenges with the impact of colonial science. ðŸŽ§\n\nâœ¨Discover Flora and the Baron through the link in bio.\".",
