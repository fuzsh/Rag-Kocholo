        "text": "23 A pril 1893 Scudder (1879) Ferdinand Muellerâs honours, awards and memberships\n\nThis list of Ferdinand Muellerâs honours, awards and memberships is based on a manuscript list of the same name compiled in the 1940s by the late Jim Willis, Assistant Government Botanist of Victoria, but with corrections and additions. Willisâs list, now in the library, Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne, was in turn based chiefly on a printed list in Latin entitled âLiber baro Ferdinandus de Muellerâ, compiled by Mueller in 1892, identified here by its number in the bibliography of Muellerâs publications as B92.06.01 and translated for the editors by Nancy White. Annotations by Mueller on a copy of the printed list that is now at the Royal Society of London, apparently sent as an enclosure with Muellerâs letter to Lord Kelvin of\n\n, have provided additional information (indicated in the references by âB92.06.01 annotationâ). Transcriptions of the list and Muellerâs annotations accompany the transcription of Muellerâs letter to Lord Kelvin in this edition of Muellerâs correspondence.\n\nThe entries are arranged alphabetically by country or colony as these were recognized in the year of Muellerâs death, 1896 (e.g.Â New South Wales, Queensland etc. and not Australia, but Canada, Germany and Italy as unified nations), and within these countries by city. For each city, entries are arranged chronologically according to Muellerâs earliest known links with the institutions listed.\n\nNames of institutions are as given at the time of Muellerâs election, appointment or so on, with some later variations noted.\n\nhas been used to verify names of scientific societies wherever possible. Institutions the names of which have not been verified independently of Muellerâs own claims are given in square brackets, as are references; âcertificateâ indicates that details have been drawn from a still existing diploma, transcriptions of all of which are included in the present edition of Muellerâs correspondence. Institutions with no fixed address are listed at the end of the appendix under âOtherâ; memberships that Mueller claimed of societies that he appears to have mis-named and that we have been unable to identify are listed under âDoubtfulâ. Where there is doubt about the city in which an organization was based, it is entered under the major or capital city of the relevant state. The names of all foreign institutions are given first in English with the name in the original language following in brackets. The names of countries and cities are given in English, e.g.Â âFlorenceâ not âFirenzeâ.\n\nThe exhibition awards, conference attendances and committee memberships noted are unlikely to be an exhaustive list. References to Muellerâs Fragmenta phytographiae australiae give the first volume in which the information cited appears on the title page.\n\nDates given on Russian documents are Old Style (that is, according to the Julian calendar still in use in Russia at the time); they have not been converted to the Gregorian calendar equivalent.\n\nArgentina\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nRural Society of Argentina (Sociedad Rural Argentina).
