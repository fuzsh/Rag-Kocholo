Emerging methodologies in historical sociolinguistics have enabled increasing attention to be focused on this era, with corpus-based work giving new insights into diverging features of Englishes across the world. Personal correspondence is now understood to be a valuable genre of data for historical analysis, with substantial letters-based research revealing findings in British (e.g. Auer, 2015; Fairman, 2014), Irish (e.g. Amador-Moreno & McCafferty, 2012), Canadian (e.g. Dollinger, 2015), and New Zealand English (e.g. Hundt, 2015).Australia, meanwhile, is a post-colonial setting that is ripe for the picking in exploring 19th-century variation and change in English. While some analysis in this period has been carried out based on published texts (e.g., Burridge, 2010, Collins, 2015, Collins & Yao, 2014), 19th-century personal correspondence presents an under-explored resource. This is due in part to a relative scarcity of data. For example, of the 534 personal letters included in the COOEE Corpus (Fritz, 2007), only 37 are from Australian-born writers.This work-in-progress report showcases a potential data source sitting in the archives of the Royal Botanic Gardens of Victoria (RBG). Between his appointment as Victorian Government Botanist in 1853 and his death in 1896, German-born scientist Ferdinand von Mueller recruited hundreds of amateur botanical collectors across Australia and maintained an extraordinary connection with them through correspondence (for example, see Figure 1 below). At least a thousand letters written to Mueller survive in manuscript form at the RBG library in Melbourne. I summarise findings from a preliminary sociolinguistic survey of this collection undertaken in 2022 with permission and assistance from the Correspondence of Ferdinand von Mueller Project (Home et al., 1987-2022). A total of 265 letters were photographed and described, noting correspondents’ gender, location of residence in Australia, age and birthplace (where known) and apparent social situation, as well as linguistic features that may be of interest for further analysis, such as variability of shall/will future constructions, formality registers and epistolary norms. The survey represents a small sample of a much larger collection. I consider the potential for further data-gathering to create a corpus of 19th-century ‘botanical’ correspondence in Australia covering 30-40 years, thereby adding to the growing field of exploration of letter-writing and language change in Englishes world-wide.ReferencesAmador Moreno, Carolina P. & McCafferty, Kevin (2012).
