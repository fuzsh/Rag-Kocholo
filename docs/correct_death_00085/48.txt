FERDINAND VON MUELLER.

By T. G. A. BARNARD.

Rather more than 50 years ago there ar-

rived in the newly founded colony of Victoria

a comparatively young man, whose

name in the course of a few years, was

destined to become familiar to scientists the

world over, by reason of his enthusiastic

devotion to his all-absorbing study - botany.

I refer to Dr Ferdinand Von Mueller after-

wards known as Baron Von Mueller and

Sir Ferdinand Mueller KCMG.

and, turning towards the cast, reached the

up the Little Yarra, he struck the head

of the Latrobe, in what is now known as

the Fumina Country

Following down the Latrobe, past the present

sites of Neerim, Moe, and Traralgon,

he made for the sea coast, Thinking it mid

way between Lake Reeves and Port Albert.

He next turned towards Wilson's Pioinon

story, to which he devoted some time, exploring

the rugged peaks, and adding to his

collection several species which had previously

been discovered in Tasmania. From

Wilson's Promontory he returned to Melbourne

by way of -Westernport, through

L'ooi film and Dandenong, thus completing

a journey of over fifteen hundred miles,
