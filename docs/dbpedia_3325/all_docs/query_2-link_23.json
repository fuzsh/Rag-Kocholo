        "text": "Mobile learning (or m-learning) is the ability to learn anywhere and at any time using a portable electronic device. Mobile technologies gradually integrate into learnedness. Mobile devices and apps are changing the way learners acquires English. This study aims to develop a mobile Apps based on the Keller Plan Personalized system of instruction (PSI) theory called JuJu English Vocabulary to improve learnersâ€™ vocabulary acquisition. The mobile Apps was developed using ADDIE instructional design model. The developed Apps was investigated using a quasi-experimental research design among 60 students separated into two(2) groups: control and experimental groups. Data were analysed using SPSS software. The outcome shows a significant difference between Post-test experimental (using the mobile app) and the control group (traditional learning). This Mobile Apps design allows personalised growth among the experimental group of students in terms of their vocabulary acquisition. The design mi...\n\nThe study determined the effectiveness of reading modules using the Marungko approach for grade one pupils in selected elementary schools in Zambales, Philippines, during the school year 2020-2021. The study revealed that the pupil-participant is a typical male young pre-schooler, whose parent is a housekeeper and living in the inner town proper. The pupils in the controlled and experimental groups were assessed under frustration level in decoding of words, reading speed and reading comprehension in the first pre-test assessment. The pupils-participant in the controlled and experimental groups were assessed under frustration level in decoding of words, reading speed and reading comprehension in the second pre-test assessment. The pupil-participant in the first post-test assessment, the controlled group were assessed &quot;Instructional level&quot; in decoding of words, slow in reading speed and frustration in the reading comprehension. For the experimental groups assessed independen...\n\nThe poor level of proficiency in the English language among Namibian learners in tertiary education is sometimes attributed to a lack of reading culture and low literacy levels in the Namibian educational system. This may be partly because literature is not taught and examined as a separate subject in public primary and secondary schools. It could also be due in part to the manner in which English is superimposed on all other languages in the country. Before being taught English, most Namibian learners have already acquired a mastery of their indigenous language and tend to transfer features of their first language to English. Using reading and literacy as theoretical strategies, this paper examines the written language of selected undergraduates with the aim of identifying errors and underlying causes. Findings reveal that students are inadequately prepared in their primary and secondary schools for the demands of academic writing in tertiary education. Analysis also reveals a lack...\n\nThis study sought to identify the causes of reading difficulties affecting reading English among the rural Grade Six Learners in Bondamakara Cluster in Mutoko District. It followed a mixed research design approach. To obtain a representative sample of the population of primary schools, purposeful sampling was used, selecting two teachers and 70 learners from Mudzonga primary schools from the six schools in the cluster. Both qualitative and quantitative data was obtained from lesson observations and from reading tests, and findings revealed that, inadequate English reading materials, improper teaching methodology and insufficient English language development were causes of reading difficulties in Bondamakara cluster. Lack of English language development was a result of insufficient teacher-learner interactions during the English lessons. The results from the tests indicated that decoding, phonemic awareness, word recognition skills and comprehension might impede reading proficiency i...\n\nThis descriptive correlational study aimed at the level of Phonemic awareness as a predictor of Word Decoding ability among BS-IT students using a total enumeration technique that involves students enrolled in the course program. Moreover, it sought to determine the significant relationship between the two variables. To verify, three different tests were being utilised to collect the necessary data, i.e., a listening test for measuring the respondents&#39; level of awareness of words with critical sounds; a phonetic transcription test to identify the respondents&#39; level of awareness of sound-symbol relationship; and spelling test to know the respondents&#39; level of ability for transcriptions to be translated to its American Standard English spelling. After the data had been collected and tabulated, it was interpreted that the students have a high level of Phonemic awareness with a mean of 3.66. Moreover, their Word Decoding ability resulted in a high level with a mean of 3.93. ...\n\nLearning to read in a second language is a complex challenge for every child. Children require a range of skills and abilities to learn to read. The ability to read with understanding is one of the most important skills for learners, not only in English language but also in other school subjects. Kenyan primary school pupilsâ€˜ reading performance as indicated in the sources cited in this thesis has for a long time been generally poor. Perhaps, this may be due to the inappropriate instructional practices used by teachers during reading lessons. This study aimed at examining the aetiology of the instructional practices prevalent in the teaching of reading in standard 4 in selected rural primary schools in Kisii central district, Kisii County, Kenya. The study was guided by the following objectives: Explore the nature of instructional practices that characterize the teaching of reading in standard 4, investigate the factors that influence a teachersâ€˜ choice of instructional practices in...\n\nThe poor level of proficiency in the English language among Namibian learners in tertiary education is sometimes attributed to a lack of reading culture and low literacy levels in the Namibian educational system.

It could also be due in part to the manner in which English is superimposed on all other languages in the country. Before being taught English, most Namibian learners have already acquired a mastery of their indigenous language and tend to transfer features of their first language to English. Using reading and literacy as theoretical strategies, this paper examines the written language of selected undergraduates with the aim of identifying errors and underlying causes. Findings reveal that students are inadequately prepared in their primary and secondary schools for the demands of academic writing in tertiary education. Analysis also reveals a lack of fundamental language skills which can only be acquired through directed reading, phonemic awareness and knowledge of English phonemic codes. Based on the findings propositions for re-evaluating and altering the teaching and learning of English in public primary and secondary schools are advocated.\n\nEven a quick glance at international data reveals something troubling: there is an increasing economic and educational gap between Africa and therest of the world. If we look just a bit deeper, we find that economic and educational stagnation may simply be the inevitable outcomes of a broad educational failure for millions of rural African children. Behind that educational failure is a \"gap,\" a chasm that most African learners must leap in order to succeed academically to benefit the entire continent. I suspect it is linguistic to its very core...I propose a series of three language-related strategies aimed at closing the education gap - for all African youth."
