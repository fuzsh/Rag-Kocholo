        "text": "1805\n\nAfrican American slave York entered Montana as a part of the Lewis and Clark expedition. ( Montana Newspaper Association Inserts, January 18, 1929)\n\n1807\n\nManuel Lisa began Montana’s fur trade era by constructing a fort at the confluence of the Yellowstone and Big Horn rivers.\n\nEdward Rose, who later lived for several years among the Crows, served on Lisa’s expedition. Several other African Americans eventually worked in the fur trade in Montana before the industry came to an end by the 1840s. (Kenneth Wiggins Porter, “Negroes and the Fur Trade,” Minnesota History, December 1934, 424-433; Willis Blenkinsop, “Edward Rose,” as found in Leroy R. Hafen, ed., The Mountain Men and the Fur Trade of the Far West, v. IX, pp. 335-345)\n\n1825\n\nJim Beckwourth first entered Montana as a member of William Ashley’s third western expedition. Reputedly born in Virginia of a slave mother and white overseer, Beckwourth became legendary as a mountain man, spending time in Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and California. He gave a detailed—and exaggerated—account of his life which was published as Life and Adventures of Jim Beckwourth (1856). He died near Ft. C.F. Smith in 1866, working as a mediator between the U.S. Army and a group of Crow Indians. (Delmont R. Oswald, “James P. Beckwourth,” as found in Leroy R. Hafen, ed., The Mountain Men and the Fur Trade of the Far West, v. VI, 37-60)\n\n1832\n\nMary Fields was born in Tennessee. She moved to Montana in 1884, where she worked at St. Peter’s Mission near Great Falls. She worked at the school until a falling out with the Catholic administration led to her ouster in 1895. She then moved to Cascade and found work as a mail coach driver for the U.S. Postal Service, leading to her nickname “Stagecoach Mary.” Fields passed away in 1914 and is buried in Cascade’s Hillside Cemetery. (Mary Fields, vertical files, MHS)\n\n1837-1840\n\nSmallpox epidemic killed many Montana Indians.\n\n1841\n\nFather DeSmet built St. Mary's Mission near present-day Stevensville.\n\n1846\n\nAmerican Fur Co. built Ft. Benton on the Upper Missouri River deep in Blackfeet country.\n\nc. 1858\n\nCharles “Smoky” Wilson was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Wilson came to Montana in the late 1860s, travelling as far as the Bozeman area. He worked for Nelson Story as a horse wrangler until he found work as an interpreter for the U.S. Army, after having learned the Crow language. One of his claims to fame was that he helped bury the remains of the Seventh Cavalry soldiers killed at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. After several years as an interpreter, Wilson worked at the Crow reservation, performing such tasks as mailman, interpreter, and policeman. Eventually he was adopted by the Crows, and allowed a full share of benefits and land. One source claims he was married several times, to both Native American and African American women. At the time of his death in 1936, he was survived by a son, John E. Wilson. ( Hardin Tribune-Herald, “Colorful Career of ‘Smoky’ Is at an End,” July 24, 1936; Charles Wilson, vertical file, MHS).\n\n1862\n\nU.S. Congress passed the Homestead Act. Along with whites, African Americans used this and later land legislation to obtain homesteads in Montana.\n\nWhile reports of gold strikes in the Deer Lodge Valley and Gold Creek came from what would become Montana Territory as early as the 1850s, the 1862 strike at Grasshopper Creek and the rise of Bannack, and subsequent strikes at Alder Gulch (Virginia City, 1863), and Last Chance Gulch (Helena 1864), triggered the Montana gold rush.\n\n1863\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation freed forever “...all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States.”\n\n1864\n\nMontana Territory created.\n\n1865\n\nCivil War ended.\n\nThirteenth Amendment passed, abolishing slavery.\n\n1866\n\nSamuel Lewis arrived in Montana. Born in Haiti, Lewis was a well-respected barber and residential developer in Bozeman, where he owned several charming rental properties. He died a prosperous man in 1896; his Bozeman residence is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. (Samuel W. Lewis, vertical files, MHS.)\n\nCongress authorized the creation of six all-African American regiments. Later dubbed “Buffalo Soldiers,” elements of these units served in Montana, most notably at Forts Missoula, Assiniboine, Harrison, Shaw, Custer, and Keogh. (Afro-Americans-Military, vertical file, MHS; AGO General Order No. 56, Aug. 1, 1866, and AGO General Order No. 92, Nov. 23, 1866; Robert M. Utley, Frontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866 – 1891 (1973), p. 12.)\n\n1867\n\n“An Irish Democrat named Lynch” murdered black Helena resident Sammy Hays during a post-election riot. ( Helena Weekly Herald, September 5, 1867, and Helena Daily Herald September 3, 1869.)\n\n1870\n\nThe Census listed 183 African Americans in Montana Territory out of a total population of 20,595.\n\n1872\n\nThe Territorial Legislature voted to segregate African American children in schools. The law was overturned in 1883. (J.W. Smurr, “Jim Crow Out West,” J.W. Smurr and K. Ross Toole, eds., Historical Essays on Montana and the Northwest , pp. 149-203.)\n\n1873\n\nE.T. Johnson elected mayor of the unincorporated city of Helena on May 22, 1873. ( Helena Weekly Herald, May 22, 1873 (p. 7)) This is likely Edward T. Johnson, a Helena resident since at least 1868, who in the 1870 census is identified as a 32-year-old barber from Washington D.C. with a personal estate worth $1000. The 1868 Helena City Directory listed him as E.T. Johnston, born in D.C., working as a barber and residing on Main Street.\n\n1876\n\nAfrican American Isaiah Dorman, an interpreter for the United States Army, died at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. (Robert J. Ege, “Braves of All Colors: The Story of Isaiah Dorman, Killed at the Little Big Horn,” Montana: the Magazine of Western History , January 1966, pp. 35-40; Roland C. McConnell, “ Isaiah Dorman and the Custer Expedition ,” Journal of Negro History, July 1948, pp. 344-352.)\n\n1879\n\nMattie Bost, African American, married white John Castner. Together they built the first cabin in Belt, which eventually evolved into a hotel, restaurant, and stage station that Mattie ran while John built up mining and real estate holdings. She later operated a cattle ranch in the Highwood Mountains, and was well thought of because of her generosity. When Mattie passed away in 1920, her estate was worth $25,000. ( Great Falls Daily Tribune, April 5 and 7, 1920; Ethel Castner Kennedy and Eva Lesell Stober, Belt Valley History, 1877-1979, pp. 21-22; Mattie Bost Castner, vertical file, MHS.)\n\n1880\n\nU.S. Census found 346 African Americans in Montana out of a population of 39,159.\n\n1881\n\nWilliam Woodcock, a U.S. Marshal's servant, sued a Butte restaurant under the 1875 Civil Rights Act after he reported its proprietor asked him to leave. In 1883, the court ruled in his favor and awarded him the minimum settlement of $500. (Smurr, “Jim Crow Out West,” 173–175; “The Two Colors of the Chop House Affair,” The Weekly Miner, December 20, 1881, p. 5; \"Montana News,\" The Daily Enterprise, December 10 1883, p. 4 .)\n\n1882\n\nAnaconda Mine in Butte discovered to have richest vein of copper in the world.\n\nSilver Bow Club founded in Butte. Like the Montana Club in Helena, African Americans often made up a significant part of the staff. ( Butte Daily Miner, Special Edition, January 1, 1886) Grand Union Hotel opened in Fort Benton. Its 11-person staff included nine African Americans. (Ken Robison, “The Jewel in Fort Benton’s Crown: The Grand Union,” Fort Benton River Press Grand Union Edition, November 2, 2007.)\n\n1883\n\nA “golden spike” ceremony on September 8 at Gold Creek, Montana celebrated the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway. Railroad companies across the nation provided steady employment for many African American men, mainly as “ Pullman porters.”\n\nMany members of northern Montana tribes died during Starvation Winter.\n\nCopper boom began in Butte.\n\n1884\n\nHelena businessmen founded the Montana Club in Helena. Several African Americans have worked for this exclusive organization. The most famous was Julian Anderson, who served drinks at the Club from 1893-1953. (“ The Montana Club, Helena, Montana,” MHS; Julian Anderson vertical file, MHS, has a collection of his drink recipes.)\n\n1886\n\nHelena’s African American community convened their annual Emancipation Day celebration on August 2, to commemorate the end of slavery in British colonies, which took effect on August 1, 1834. Stockman Dan Floweree donated $50.00 to help cover expenses for the celebration, and Mayor Theodore H. Kleinschmidt and several other white residents attended. ( Helena Herald, August 3, 1886; Helena Independent, August 3, 1886.)\n\n1887\n\nAfter making a mark as an abolitionist, daguerrotypist, and entrepreneur in Cincinnati and Minneapolis, James Presley (J.P.) Ball Sr. moved to Helena. He immediately became a noted leader among the city’s African Americans. Among other pursuits, he was active in the Republican Party (he was elected to serve on the Republican Party Central Committee for Lewis and Clark County in 1894), and served as president for Helena’s Afro-American Club. At his J.P. Ball & Son studio he took many images of white and black Helena residents and events, including the laying of the cornerstone of the State Capitol building. He moved to Seattle in 1901, eventually dying in Hawaii in 1905. His photographs provide deep insight into of turn-of-the-century Helena. Examples of his work can be viewed at an online exhibit at the Cincinnati Historical Society. (James P. Ball, vertical files, MHS; The Colored Citizen, May 10, 1894; Deborah Willis, ed., J.P. Ball, Daguerrean and Studio Photographer, xiv-xix)\n\n1888\n\nThe Helena black community founded the St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church. The center of social life for many African Americans, it continued as a congregation through the 1940s. ( Helena Weekly Herald, September 27, 1888, p. 7; Helena, MT—Churches—African Methodist Episcopal Church vertical file, MHS.)\n\n1889\n\nMontana became the 41 st state .\n\n1890\n\nThe census reported 142,924 people in Montana, including 1,490 identified as African American.\n\nThe internationally-acclaimed Fisk University’s Jubilee Singers performed a series of shows across the state in early May 1890, benefitting several churches. Stops included Helena, Livingston, Deer Lodge, Boulder, and Anaconda. ( Helena Independent, May 15, 1890; Anaconda Standard , May 6, 1890.)\n\n1891\n\nIts congregation began construction of the first Union Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church building in Great Falls. A second church replaced the original in 1917. The church represents patterns of black community growth in the western U.S., and is closely tied to the historical development of the African American community in Great Falls. In 2003 it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n1893\n\nThe Panic of 1893 devastated the state’s silver mining industry. Nearly one-third of Montanans lost their jobs as banks failed and mines closed.\n\nThe Montana and Illinois Gold Mining Company incorporated to develop claims in the Townsend area. The owner, Charles Porter Grove, traveled the eastern United States to attract capital from African American investors. Unfortunately, the mines never made any money. Grove began to exhibit erratic behavior, and in 1911 froze to death in a gulch near Radersburg. Later, more successful African American concerns in Montana included the Afro-American Mining and Milling Company (incorporated in 1906, with properties near Butte) and the Bernice-Red Rock Mining Company (founded in 1908, with property in Jefferson County near Bernice). (Certificate of Incorporation of Montana and Illinois Gold Mining Company, August 5, 1893, S2007-03, Montana Secretary of State, Business Services Bureau Records, ID# D002152; Helena Independent, February 23, 1894, p. 5; Montana Plaindealer, April 12, 1907, p. 1; Helena Daily Independent, January 7, 1911.)\n\nAfrican American Emma Wall and her white husband John Orr married in Glendive. On their wedding night they were forcibly “alabastined” and “ebonized” by a mob, and given 24-hour notice to leave town. ( Glendive Independent, June 1893 and Kansas City Gazette, May 2, 1895. Montana Historical Society Clippings file: Glendive early June 1893.)\n\nU.S. District Judge Hiram Knowles appointed Libby resident and Montana’s first black attorney, John D. Posten, U.S. Commissioner to the District Court.\n\n1894\n\nMontana’s first black newspaper, The Colored Citizen , was published in Helena from September 3 to December 15, 1894, chiefly to advance the city’s case for designation as the state capital.\n\nFormer slave Annie Morgan settled on an abandoned fox farm near Philipsburg. In 1913, she filed a homestead entry for the property she shared with her white common-law husband, Joseph “Fisher Jack” Case. The Morgan-Case Homestead was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\n\n1896\n\nButte’s black residents established the Afro-American Club of Butte City as a social outlet to pursue interests in music, literature, and science. Anacondans founded the A.J. Campbell Afro American Club in their city two years later. ( Anaconda Standard, October 4, 1898, p. 3. )\n\nLewis and Clark County officials hung William Biggerstaff for the murder of boxer Richard Johnson in Helena. ( Anaconda Standard, June 10, 1895, p. 7 ; Anaconda Standard, April 5, 1896, p. 5 ; Great Falls Weekly Tribune, April 10, 1896, p. 2 . Also see MHS Research Center Photo Archives images #957-610, #957-611, #957-612; and #957-613.)\n\n1897\n\nSoldiers from the Twenty-fifth Infantry stationed at Fort Missoula rode bicycles from Missoula to St. Louis, Missouri—approximately 1,900 miles—in forty days. (United States Army Twenty-fifth Infantry Regiment, vertical files, MHS.)\n\n1900\n\n1,523 African Americans listed in census for Montana (243,329 total population).\n\nAfrican American Sarah Gammon (Brown) Bickford became owner of the Virginia City Water Company upon the death of her husband Stephen. She ran the utility until her death in 1931. ( Madisonian, March 22, 1900, July 24, 1931; Madison County History Association, comp., Pioneer Trails and Trials: Madison County, 1863-1920, pp. 305-306 .)\n\n1901\n\nAn African Methodist Episcopal Church congregation organized in Billings, meeting at 302 North 24 th Street. The church building, called Wayman Chapel, moved to the south side in 1916 and served the community until 2013. The congregation continues to be an active part of the Billings community.\n\nIn June, congregants laid the cornerstone for Shaffer’s Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church on the southeast corner of Idaho and Platinum Streets in Butte. ( Anaconda Standard, June 9, 1901.)\n\nAccording to the Butte City Directory, Bethel Baptist Church, a black congregation, organized in Butte in July 1901. It later moved its church to 217 West Mercury, the site of the original AME church.\n\n1902\n\nThe New Age, published from May 30, 1902, to February 1903 , represented the interests of the black residents of Butte, Montana. In the inaugural edition the editors, John W. Duncan and Chris Dorsey, declared their intention to establish a statewide network of reporters dedicated to bringing the news of the African American community throughout Montana to readers in Butte.\n\nThe Afro-American Women’s Club was founded in Butte, perhaps the first black women’s organization in Montana. Though soon forced to disband, it re-emerged as the Pearl Club in 1918 to help support the American cause during World War I, and became instrumental in creating the Montana Federation of Negro Women’s Clubs. Other black women’s clubs included the Phyllis Wheatley Club (Billings), the Dunbar Art and Study Club (Great Falls), and the Pleasant Hour Club (Helena). (Montana Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, Montana Federation of Colored Women's Clubs records, 1921-1978, MC 281, MHS.)\n\nVaudeville stars Bert Williams and George Walker gave three performances at Sutton’s New Grand in Butte. Williams was the most popular African American entertainer of his era, highly regarded for his singing, dancing, comedy, and composing. A reporter from Butte’s black newspaper, The New Age, noted “A (great) many attended the three performances. This is evidently the best colored play that has yet played a stage in Butte.” Members of Butte’s African American community gave a dinner in their honor. ( The New Age, May 30, 1902, p. 4.)\n\n1903\n\nIn June 1903, members of Anaconda’s Allen Chapel AME church laid the cornerstone and moved an abandoned school building donated by the Anaconda Company to the city’s downtown to serve as a permanent home. ( Anaconda Standard, June 8, 1903, p. 3.)\n\nIn May, President Theodore Roosevelt visited Montana, and African Americans in Montana gave speeches and gifts in honor of his visit; in Helena Roosevelt received an ebony and silver trowel to “continue to spread the cement of human kindness to all mankind”, while in Butte he was given a pair of scales because it was given by citizens who had “weighed his every act” and that Roosevelt had been “so evenly balanced in the scale of justice\". His Butte appearance also featured a speech by C.F. Jones, who represented African Americans in the city. ( Helena Daily Independent, May 28, 1903; Anaconda Standard, May 28, 1903.)\n\n1906\n\nAfrican American Joseph B. Bass began publishing the Montana Plaindealer in Helena, which ran from Mar. 16, 1906 to Sept. 8, 1911. The editors supported the Republican Party. Other black-owned newspapers were The Colored Citizen (which began and ended in Helena in 1894, and existed mainly to support Helena in the capital fight) and The New Age (published in Butte from 1902-1903). (Montana’s African American Heritage Resources website, Newspapers page; Rex C. Myers, “Montana’s Negro Newspapers,” Montana Journalism Review 16, 1973, pp. 17-22.)\n\n1909\n\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded in New York City.\n\nCongress Passed the Enlarged Homestead Act .\n\nThe Montana legislature passed a law making marriage between whites and non-whites illegal. The Montana Legislature repealed the law in 1953. ( Montana Plaindealer, February 12, 1909, p. 1; Loralee Davenport, “A Journey toward Sovereignty and Security: The African American Community of Butte, Montana from 1885-1955,” on file at the Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives, 2001, p. 72.)\n\nBlack citizens in Helena commemorated the 100 th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birth. Lincoln’s birthday was celebrated annually by Montana’s African American communities. ( Montana Plaindealer, February 12, 1909, p. 1.)\n\n1910\n\nThe Census listed 1,834 African Americans in Montana (out of a total population of 376,053).\n\nThe black parishioners of Helena’s Second Baptist Church (Ebenezer Mission) received blueprints for their new church building to be located at 1260 Harrison Avenue. Mrs. Mamie Bridgwater served as an active member of the church, which often met in her home prior to the church building’s construction. ( Montana Plaindealer , October 21, 1910, p. 4. )\n\n1911\n\nButte’s Socialist Mayor Lewis J. Duncan appointed African American Frank Cassels as city policeman. Not long after, the Butte City Council rejected his appointment, as well as four other police officers. ( Daily Missoulian, September 13, 1911, p. 1.)\n\n1912\n\nLast Chance Club organized in Helena “for the social improvement among its members, literary and dramatic entertainments, and benevolent work among those in need of assistance.”\n\n1913\n\nBooker T. Washington lectured in Billings, Bozeman, Butte, and Helena (where he was introduced by Governor Samuel V. Stewart) on black and white relations in the United States. Washington called for accommodation between the races: “I believe there is room enough, justice enough, and good sense enough to enable the two races to live here side by side and work out their own destinies.” Blacks and whites together attended his lectures in the state, and he was hosted by members of black and white organizations in each town. ( Billings Daily Gazette, March 4-5, 1913; Bozeman Daily Chronicle, March 4, 6-7, 1913; Anaconda Standard, March 6-7, 1913; Butte Miner, March 6-7, 1913; Helena Daily Independent, March 8, 1913.)\n\nOn April 4, 1913, a mob in Mondak lynched African American construction camp worker J. C. Collins for killing Sheridan County Sheriff Thomas Courtney and Deputy Sheriff Richard Burmeister. Newspapers reported that Collins killed them when they attempted to apprehend him for assaulting the wife of a fellow camp worker.( Wibaux Pioneer, April 18, 1913, p. 2; Yellowstone Monitor, April 10, 1913, p. 1 ; Poplar Standard, April 10, 1913; Culbertson Searchlight, April 11, 1913; MHS Photograph Archives, PAc 75-78.37 and PAc 75-78.38.)\n\n1914\n\nOn November 3, 1914, Montana men voted 53 to 47 percent in favor of equal suffrage. That year Montana (and Nevada, which also passed a suffrage amendment in 1914) joined nine other western states in extending voting rights to non-Native women. (Indian women would have to wait until passage of the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act to gain access to the ballot.)\n\nWorld War I began.\n\n1916\n\nThe controversial movie Birth of a Nation played in Montana theaters, and protests against its depictions of African Americans were held in Helena and Butte. ( Anaconda Standard, January 26, 1916; Helena Independent , February 22 and 25, 1916.)\n\nArthur C. Ford of Helena graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from Montana State College (now Montana State University), making him one of the first black graduates of that school. Ford was later named president of New York City’s Department of Water Supply, Gas, and Electricity, thus becoming the first African American to be appointed commissioner of a New York city agency. Ford passed away in 1985 at the age of 93. His father Nathianel had been a coachman for Montana Senator T.C. Power. ( Helena Independent, May 31, 1916; New York Times, April 17, 1985; Great Falls Tribune June 19, 1950, as found in MC 55, C.B. Power Papers, box 8, folder 9, MHS; Helena Independent Record, February 2, 1953.)\n\n1917\n\nYears of drought began in Montana that ended homesteading boom.\n\nThree black railroad workers- Leslie Fahley (or Foley), Harrison Gibson, and Henry Hall -were hanged in White Sulphur Springs for the murder of a white transient laborer. Four others received sentences from ten years to life imprisonment.\n\n1919\n\nFifty percent of Montana farmers lost their land over the next six years.\n\nAlice Palmer claimed a homestead in the Lincoln area. She built twenty-two cabins in what would become the Palmer subdivision. Palmer also ran a boarding house in Helena at 199 Ralph Street. (Upper Blackfoot Historical Society, Gold Pans and Single Trees, p. 48-49; Lucille W. Thompson, “Early Montana Negro Pioneers: Sung and Unsung,” Montana Business Quarterly, Summer 1972, pp. 39-42.)\n\n1920\n\nCensus for the year counted 1,658 African Americans in Montana out of a total population of 548,889.\n\n1921\n\nThe Montana Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs was founded, joining together ten organizations. (Montana Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, Montana Federation of Colored Women's Clubs records, 1921-1978, MC 281, MHS).\n\nHenry Baker was named postmaster at the state Capitol; he was believed to be the first Montana state official of African American descent. ( Anaconda Standard, July 3, 1921).\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan (KKK) organized in Montana. Though it counted approximately 5,100 members at its height, evidence suggests that Montana’s KKK held little influence over the lives of black Montanans, as the organization’s anti-Catholic/anti-immigrant stance outweighed whatever anti-black attitudes were found in the state.
