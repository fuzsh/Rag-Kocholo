        "text": "Suffrage\n\nat 100\n\nA Visual History\n\nOn May 18, 1915, crowds streamed into the Polo Grounds in Manhattan to watch the New York Giants take on the Chicago Cubs. But beyond the diamond, a bigger contest was brewing.\n\nThe state of New York was gearing up to hold a referendum, putting the question of women’s suffrage to its (all-male) electorate. Supporters of the cause organized a “suffrage day” game, luring potential voters with the offer of a piece of chocolate cake with every ticket purchased at their headquarters. They festooned the stadium with yellow banners and printed baseball-themed fliers, with exhortations like “Fans, Fair Play” and “Make a Home Run for Suffrage.”\n\nEverybody, The New York Timesnoted, “had a ‘lovely’ time.” But the festive mood would fizzle out come November: The men of New York rejected the suffrage measure, and its women would have to work another two years for the right to vote.\n\nVotes for women was a demand that was both radical and all-American. And the nearly century-long history of how women won that right is as colorful and kaleidoscopic as it is complicated and almost impossible to sum up.\n\nThose who fought for it were heroes, but not always moral paragons. The suffrage movement, like other social movements before and after, often reflected the racism, nativism and other prejudices that pervaded America as a whole.\n\nAt the heart of the suffrage battle was a conundrum: Women gaining the vote required persuading men to share it with them. And there were many who dismissed the cause as ridiculous, if not downright dangerous.\n\n“The benefits of woman suffrage are almost wholly imaginary,” The Times declared in 1913, in one of a long string of anti-suffrage editorials. “Its penalties will be real and hard to bear.”\n\nTo combat such attitudes, suffragists used every weapon in the arsenal, from petitions and speeches to pins, parades and attention-grabbing stunts. The rise of the movement coincided with the birth of photography, and the suffragists deployed the medium to put human faces on their struggle. “They knew how to build a visual identity,” the historian Susan Ware said, “and use it for a political purpose.”\n\nThe fight for the vote was the fight for democracy. No history can sum it all up. But these images help bring into focus how the largest enfranchisement in American history came to pass, and the generations of women who made it happen.\n\nSuffragists fought for the vote in every corner of the country\n\nThe story of the suffrage movement usually starts like this: In July 1848, a group of people got together in Seneca Falls, N.Y., and set forth a series of demands for women’s rights, including the right to vote. But the history of women and voting in the United States extends well before, and beyond, Seneca Falls. In the years after the American Revolution, there were women who voted — in New Jersey. The state’s original constitution assigned voting rights to all free, property-owning residents — regardless of gender or race — and some women, and African-Americans, there voted until 1807, when the state passed a law limiting the franchise to white men. And while the campaign for women’s suffrage may have formally kicked off in Seneca Falls, it quickly expanded across the country.\n\nMany of the movement’s leaders were based in the East, where organizations such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and the National Woman’s Party (N.W.P.) were headquartered, but its earliest victories came in the West. Women including Susan B. Anthony and the NAWSA president Carrie Chapman Catt traveled to states such as Washington and Colorado in the late 1800s, giving speeches and helping them wage successful campaigns for the right to vote, but they continued to be excluded from the franchise themselves back home. As momentum grew in the West, women in the rest of the country asked, “Why not us?”\n\nThe suffrage movement spread to all corners of the country, reaching big cities and small towns in every region and pulling in women from all walks of life. But at a time when large swaths of the nation were segregated, the suffrage movement was no exception. While there were interracial suffrage organizations, for much of the movement’s history they were the exception rather than the rule. Many white groups, particularly in the South, refused to accept Black members, and leaders of NAWSA and other national organizations, fearful of losing support in the region, kowtowed to racist demands to exclude women of color. Black women formed their own groups to fight not only for the right to vote but also for greater equality and justice for their communities.\n\nIn 1872, a woman named Virginia Minor attempted to register to vote in Missouri. When she was turned away, she sued. Her case advanced to the Supreme Court, which unanimously rejected her claim, declaring that “the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone.” This decision helped confirm for many suffragists the need for a constitutional amendment declaring that access to the ballot could not be denied on the basis of sex. A national amendment would require national support in order to pass the House and Senate and be ratified by legislatures in three-fourths of the states. The suffragists roamed far and wide to spread awareness of their cause. And after Congress passed the 19th Amendment in the summer of 1919, the battle came down to the states, with all eyes eventually on Tennessee.\n\nThere was never just one kind of suffragist\n\nWomen’s quest for political power involved Americans of every race, class and walk of life — and it did not start, or end, with the vote. As early as the 1810s, Black women preachers such as Jarena Lee were fighting for more equitable roles in their churches, and inspiring others to do the same. “The Black church is not just a place of spiritual refuge or contemplation but a major political organization,” the historian Martha S. Jones said in a phone interview. “In May 1848, you have a group of Black church women in Philadelphia, from the same community as Lee, who organize and petition for preaching licenses — and win them. And then two months later, in July, another group of women gets together in a little village called Seneca Falls. And among their demands, along with the right to vote, is a demand for equality for women in religion. All of it stems from a critique of the notion that race and sex should determine political power, and a new visioning of what American political culture should look like”\n\nIn 1866, after the end of the Civil War, a coalition including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass formed the American Equal Rights Association, with the goal of securing the right to vote for all American citizens, “irrespective of race, color or sex.” That same year, the first petition for universal suffrage was presented to Congress. But when the government moved to enfranchise Black men with the 14th and 15th Amendments, while continuing to exclude women, many suffragists were indignant. The racism exposed by the debates over these laws festered for decades, and Black suffragists found themselves fighting a difficult battle for equal treatment on two fronts, as women and as African-Americans.\n\nLatinas, Asian-Americans, Indigenous women and immigrants were all part of the multigenerational struggle for the vote. They led marches, gave speeches and organized for their right to a voice in the political system. But when victory did come with the 19th Amendment, some of them would not be included.\n\nSuffragists fought for their rights not only at the ballot box but also in their daily lives. For some of them, that included whom they loved and how they chose to express their identities. The terms “gay” and “lesbian” were not used much at the time, but many women who might identify as part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community today were integral to the campaign for the vote. Several of the most prominent leaders of the suffrage movement were involved in so-called “romantic friendships” or “Boston marriages” that many historians now regard as same-sex relationships: the one-time NAWSA president Dr. Anna Howard Shaw and Lucy Anthony, niece of Susan B. Anthony (who was also believed to have had relationships with women); Mary Burrill and Lucy Diggs Slowe, both prominent members of the same circle of Black suffragists in Washington as Terrell; and Carrie Chapman Catt, another president of NAWSA, and Mary Garrett Hay — just to name a few.\n\nNot all suffragists were women. (And not all women were suffragists.) Male allies were part of women’s campaign for the vote from the beginning. Many of them had collaborated with the suffragists in the movement to end slavery in the United States, and they saw the enfranchisement of women as a natural extension of their work to achieve liberty for all Americans. Among them was Frederick Douglass, who published the abolitionist newspaper The North Star. Its motto was: “Right is of no sex. Truth is of no color. God is the father of us all, and all we are brethren.”\n\nSuffragists were revolutionary political strategists\n\nThe first several decades of the suffrage movement largely revolved around meetings, speeches and petitions. But in the 1910s, things began to shift. “You still have mainstream organizations like NAWSA doing the traditional political grunt work within the system, with their index cards keeping track of votes and which representatives support it and who needs to be swayed,” the historian Susan Ware said in a phone interview. “But that on its own isn’t enough. And so you start to see public spectacles like the marches and parades that really put it in your face.”\n\nInspired in part by the British suffrage movement — led by Emmeline Pankhurst and the Women’s Social and Political Union, whose motto was “Deeds not words” — new leaders including Alice Paul and Lucy Burns and groups such as the N.W.P. emerged that took a more radical tack. While they never adopted their British counterparts’ most violent tactics, which included bombings and arson, they did take to heart the sentiment that, if the vote was finally to be won, they would have to take their fight to the streets, and to the very doorstep of power itself. Many tools of protest that activists use today were honed by the suffragists, from mass marches and picketing outside the White House to wearing badges and pins to express support for a cause. “What these women were so good at was making sure suffrage was a topic on everyone’s mind,” Dr. Ware said. “It was everywhere. And you had to take a stand.”\n\nFrom the earliest days of the movement, the suffragists creatively and relentlessly spread the word about their cause. Renowned orators such as Sojourner Truth, Mary Church Terrell and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw gave speeches. Leaflets and posters made the suffragists’ case in print. And when the mainstream (male-run) press refused to cover the movement for women’s rights, or did so in disparaging terms and with grotesque caricatures, women created their own. Several of the continent’s first publications written by and for women emerged with the suffrage movement, including Amelia Bloomer’s The Lily, which covered issues from suffrage to temperance to dress reform, and Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin’s The Woman’s Era, the first newspaper published by a Black woman in the United States.\n\nThe organizers who fought for women’s right to vote were skilled in the relatively new art of public relations, and they found innovative ways to get their message out — from flashy stunts to all manner of memorabilia. The “suffrage day” baseball game on May 18, 1915, for example, drew plenty of attention to the suffragists’ cause — even if the referendum it promoted failed that fall.\n\nSuffragists fought for more than just the vote\n\nWomen’s struggle for the right to vote intersected with many other social movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries, from abolition to temperance to labor. It collided with wars and grappled with changing social norms. It even had to contend with a pandemic. “Suffragists were never single-issue people,” the historian Ellen Carol DuBois said in a phone interview. “They understood that getting the right to vote was the crucial tool for every important political change in American society — and they had a long list of changes they wanted to be a part of.”\n\nMany of the early suffragists — including organizers of the Seneca Falls convention such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott — were ardent abolitionists, and their experiences in that movement informed how they waged their campaigns for women’s rights. “The early suffragists were schooled in antislavery,” Dr. DuBois said. “They’re sibling movements.” But after the Civil War, the fight over the 15th Amendment, which enfranchised Black men but did nothing to address women’s demand for the vote, divided some white suffragists from their former allies. “Stanton in particular repeatedly used very disturbing racial rhetoric when objecting to what she called the closing of the constitutional door” on women’s suffrage, Dr. DuBois explained. The effects of this schism would continue to ripple through the movement for decades.\n\nAt its heart, the suffrage movement was a fundamental reimagining of the roles of women in American society, not as the dependents of men but as full citizens. Women such as the newspaper publisher Amelia Bloomer and other advocates of dress reform sought liberation, in the first instance, from the corsets and petticoats that constricted their everyday lives. (Bloomer would lend her name to the cohort’s preferred attire: pantaloons worn under a short skirt, also known as bloomers.) For others, it meant fighting for control over one’s body. And for many suffragists, voting meant having a chance to combat the abuse of alcohol, which they saw a main cause of domestic violence: The campaign for the vote became interwoven with the movements for temperance and prohibition.\n\nThe W.C.T.U. did not just advocate suffrage and temperance. Like many other turn-of-the-century women’s groups in the newly industrialized nation, they also pushed for legal protections for the millions of women and children working in factories and mills. Immigrants, who made up a large portion of the work force, would prove instrumental to this campaign. Organizers such as Rose Schneiderman and Margaret Hinchey helped bring many of them into the fight, not just for stronger workplace safety measures but also for a voice in the system that was responsible for such laws.\n\nFrom 1914 to 1918, everyday life was brought to a halt by World War I. Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of NAWSA, believed that being seen as patriotic would help the suffrage cause and threw the group’s support behind President Wilson when the United States entered the conflict in 1917. NAWSA would pour considerable resources into the war effort. But the N.W.P. took a different tack: The Silent Sentinels continued to picket the While House six days a week, demanding the very liberty that the country professed to be defending abroad. Ultimately, women’s highly visible roles in the war effort may have helped. In January 1918, nine months before the war’s end, the House of Representatives approved a suffrage amendment 274-136, and, as it moved through the Senate, Wilson gave it his full support. “We have made partners of the women in this war,” he said on Sept. 30. “Shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not a partnership of privilege and right?” (The Senate rejected the amendment the next day, but would ultimately approve it in June 1919.)\n\nSuffragists transformed America’s democracy\n\nThe 19th Amendment — ratified on Aug. 18, 1920, and added to the constitution eight days later — was the single largest act of enfranchisement in the history of the United States. Millions of women cast their first ballots that fall. But the amendment’s promise was incomplete. Many American women, including some who had fought fiercely for suffrage, were still excluded from the ballot box. Many Native Americans were not able to vote until 1924, when the Snyder Act made them U.S. citizens. Chinese immigrants were similarly barred until the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943. And many Black and Latinx people who, on paper, had an unequivocal right to vote, were functionally disenfranchised for decades by poll taxes, literacy tests, “white primary” laws and other forms of voter suppression. It is for this reason that many scholars point to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which barred racial discrimination in voting, as another milestone in suffrage history.\n\nAnd the fight for suffrage was not just about the right to vote. It was about equality for women in all areas of life. From pay equity to educational resources and access to credit, women have continued to fight for their rights, and for equal representation in the bodies of power that regulate them. The Equal Rights Amendment, Title IX, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act: All are descended from the suffragists and their work. “The suffrage movement is not this finite, discrete thing: It’s part of a much broader story about women’s roles in American society,” the historian Susan Ware said in a phone interview. “This isn’t about one issue from 100 years in the past that a bunch of women in long dresses and big hats cared about. These are issues we’re still fighting for today. And getting the vote was an absolutely necessary step in everything that came afterward.”\n\nAfter the ratification of the 19th Amendment, many suffragists shifted their attention to ensuring that women knew how to use their new right, and to establishing further protections for them under the law. In 1923, Alice Paul and her fellow suffragist Crystal Eastman, a co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, sat down to write what became the Equal Rights Amendment, which built on the promises of the 19th to ensure equality for women in all aspects of the law. The measure was first introduced to Congress that same year. Paul rewrote it in 1943, with the text that stands to this day: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” The E.R.A. was passed by Congress in 1972. It moved to the state legislatures but failed to reach the three-fourths threshold for ratification before a congressional deadline. On Jan. 15, 2020, Virginia finally became the 38th state to ratify the E.R.A. The law’s fate is still uncertain.\n\nAmerican women’s struggle for equality wasn’t just about what laws said: It was about making sure women’s voices were part of the conversation when those laws were made. The first woman elected to Congress — Jeannette Rankin, Republican of Montana — won her seat in the House of Representatives in 1916. But for a long time, she was in a very small club. Ten years, and five elections, after the 19th Amendment became law, there were nine women in the 531-member Congress, all in the House. The first woman elected to the Senate — Hattie Caraway, Democrat of Arkansas — would not win her seat until 1932. By 1970, 50 years after the enfranchisement of America’s women, there were still only 11 of them in Congress; one was Shirley Chisholm, the legislature’s first Black female member.\n\nOne hundred years after millions of American women cast their first ballots, Harris is one of 26 women serving in the Senate. Another 101 are Representatives in the House. Women are governors of nine states, as well as the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam. Four serve as Congressional delegates for American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. There is still progress to be made. But all this would be unimaginable if women had not won the vote.\n\nA project by Veronica Chambers, with Jennifer Harlan, Jennifer Schuessler, Christoph Fuhrmans and Nick Donofrio.
