        "text": "This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nMontana is a state in the Western United States. The western third of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges. Smaller, \"island ranges\" are found in the central third of the state, for a total of 77 named ranges of the Rocky Mountains. This geographical fact is reflected in the state's name, derived from the Spanish word montaña (mountain). Montana has several nicknames,[1] including \"The Treasure State\" and \"Big Sky Country\", and slogans that include \"Land of the Shining Mountains\" and more recently, \"The Last Best Place\". The state ranks fourth in area, but 44th in population, and accordingly has the third-lowest population density in the United States.[2] The economy is primarily based on services, with ranching, wheat farming, oil and coal mining in the east, and lumber, tourism, and hard rock mining in the west.[3] Millions of tourists annually visit Glacier National Park, the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, and three of the five entrances to Yellowstone National Park.[4]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nAcademics from Montana Name Lifetime Montana connection Comments Refs 1936–2002 Lived in Helena during retirement Professor; historian; biographer [5] 1923–2020 Born in Billings Historian specializing in the American Civil War and World War II; chief historian of the National Park Service (1981–1994); National Park Service Historian Emeritus [6] 1954–present Born near Malta; attended college in and lives in Missoula Memoirist; associate professor at the University of Montana [7] 1948–present Lives in Missoula Historian and writer on the Western United States; professor and A.B.

Much of the state was part of a much larger Dakota Territory in 1863 and the westernmost portion of the state became part of the Oregon Territory in 1848. The territory was the realm of fur traders and Native Americans. The first European settlements were Christian missions in the western part of the state (1821). A fur trading settlement at Fort Benton on the Missouri River was established in 1847. In the 1850s, pioneers traveling along the Mormon and Oregon Trails started moving north into the Beaverhead River country establishing Montana's first cattle ranches. Gold was first discovered in Montana at Gold Creek near present day Garrison, Montana in 1852. Major gold strikes were made at Alder Gulch, Montana in 1864 spawning present day Virginia City, Montana and Bannack, Montana, the first territorial capital. In 1883 the Northern Pacific Railway completed its transcontinental route across Montana followed by the Great Northern Railway in 1893. From the first gold strikes to the beginning of the 20th century, pioneers flowed into Montana to establish mines, cattle ranches, lumber mills, banks, mercantiles, tourism, Yellowstone National Park and farms across the state.

The territorial government was first formed at the first territorial capital Bannack. Later the territorial capital was moved to Virginia City (1865), and Helena (1875). On November 8, 1889, Montana became a state and Helena remained the capital. During the territorial period, most senior government positions were appointed by the U.S. President. Once Montana became a state, elections were held for state and federal offices. The U.S. President still appointed judges to the federal courts in Montana. Prominent Montana politicians include the longest serving Senate Majority Leader, Senator Mike Mansfield and first woman Congresswoman, Jeannette Rankin.\n\nState legislators\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Montana State Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Montana.
