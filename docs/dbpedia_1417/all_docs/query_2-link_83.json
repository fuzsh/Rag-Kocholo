        "text": "Phorge Makerspace, located at 1205 Broadway St. in Sheridan, is a community of makers who, share, create, collaborate, research, develop, mentor, cross-pollinate, play, and of course…learn!\n\nSusan Grant, executive director of Phorge, explains what they do\n\nPhorge Makerspace focuses on science, technology, engineering, and math. They are recently in the process of adding a machining and wood shop for those who are interested in working in those areas as well.\n\nCurrently they offer 3D Printing; CAD/CAM (3D Design); Coding; Laser Cutting; Vinyl Cutting and Electronics.\n\nThey recently were a recipient of funding through the Wyoming Innovation Partnership Grant. Grant spoke at the Governor’s Town Hall held on July 23.\n\nPhorge Makerspace has a variety of different tools for members to use for their projects. They have three-D printers, laser and vinyl cutters, sewing machines, and they have kits for those who want to work on different projects.\n\nGrant talked about the 3-D printing devices that they offer at Markerspace.\n\nMembers can come down and do 3-D printing anytime. She said they have monthly and yearly memberships as well as day passes to use the space. They also offer classes, from 3-D printing to leather working and electronics. One of the first classes they offered this year was for the Girl Scouts, who made nature aprons, sewing the aprons and adding a leather pouch to collect nature items.\n\n“They just had a great time” Grant said.\n\nSome of the funds they received were used for an expansion on the space, added a 1260 square foot of ‘dirty space’ that is space for woodworking and metalworking.\n\nJake Mahar shop manager of the wood and metal shop, and he explained some of the machines that they recently added there, but currently they are not ready for use. They hope to have everything ready for use before the first of the year.\n\nHe said that Makerspace is a place where people can come and develop prototypes of projects, and he added,\n\nThe three major impacts of sustaining a community makerspace in a rural community include: Supporting local, state and national education STEAM/STEM priorities; building of entrepreneurial skills, prototyping and culture; development of workforce skills with a technology base.\n\nThey have several business and community partnerships in the Sheridan area. Some of their business partners have designed protypes at Phorge. They are a member of Sheridan County Chamber of Commerce as well.\n\nGrant added they are always looking for volunteers, as well as volunteer teachers to help with the workshops they offer. She urged the community to take advantage of the membership vouchers that they are offering this year.\n\nContact Phorge for more information.
