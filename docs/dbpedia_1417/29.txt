Appointed to fill a vacancy on October 3, 1922, Rebecca Felton of Georgia took the oath of office on November 21, 1922, becoming the first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Felton served only 24 hours after taking the oath, but her historic appointment paved the way for other women senators. Hattie Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman to win election to the Senate in 1932, and the first to chair a Senate committee. In 1949 Margaret Chase Smith of Maine took the oath of office, becoming the first woman to serve in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. To date, 60 women have served in the Senate, with 25 serving at this time (indicated in bold below).
