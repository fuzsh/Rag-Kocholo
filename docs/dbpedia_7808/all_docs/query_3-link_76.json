        "text": "Like the Federalist Papers that urged New York to ratify our Constitution, this is the first in a series of papers aimed at individuating it. According to the psychologist Carl Jung, “individuation” is the ultimate state of psychic wholeness through the union of opposites. He furthermore worked with the physicist Wolfgang Pauli to develop a theory according to which the laws of physics and psychology mirror each other because mind and matter both emerge from the same archetypes of the collective unconscious, all of which radiate from the ultimate archetype of wholeness through the union of opposites, the Unus Mundus, or Self. I argue that the psychic mandala images that emerge from the Unus Mundus to compensate an ego that is pulled by opposing demands are mirrored in the material world by black holes (including the inside-out black hole universe). I also argue that the succinct parallels between Jung’s psychology (especially his near-death experience of the cosmic horizon) and Leonard Susskind’s holographic string theory indicate that each psyche is rooted in the central singularity and holographic horizon of the cosmos. With that foundation in place I ask: What is the fewest number of updates we can give our Constitution in order to least disruptively achieve its primary goal of forming a more perfect Union? First, add an Amendment to serve as a Preface to the Preamble explaining why We the People now identify each individual self with the central singularity and surrounding horizon of the cosmos. Second, add a fourth branch of government dedicated to helping the other three branches harmonize their decision-making processes with this central organizing principle, Psyche = Singularity, specifically by creating alternative futures scenarios aimed at enabling our Posterity to assimilate it ever more perfectly.\n\nClassic psychology cannot cope with an explanation of the nature of archetypes and the collective unconscious in terms of Carl G. Jung. In explanation of these phenomena we can use, however, quantum psychology which takes the paradigm of electronic processes of life that accepts quantum processes occurring in the receptor cells and tissues. This model goes back to the Quantum Foundations, and believes that a living system is an electronic device capable of recording information by electronic means. This allows for explaining the mechanism of archetypes' action in a biological system as well as functioning of the collective unconscious. This means that, thanks to the electronic properties of the biological mass, this system has many possibilities of recording information about the experiences of individuals and the environment in which they live, but it has also the ability to record this information throughout ontogeny, and some of the phenomena within the scope of human phylogeny.\n\nThis article begins by putting basic themes in Jung's psychoanalytic in the context of present-day conceptual predilec-tions that warrant questioning, specifically in relation to feeling and to being a body. The questioning leads to insights into the dynamic congruency of emotions and movement, to the political reality of demonstrations, protests , marches and so on, and from there to Jung's notion of a \"psychic epidemic,\" an epidemic that takes hold by way of a \"totalitarian mass state.\" At one point, Jung states that such epidemics can be mitigated only by \"collective therapy .\" Jung does not describe this form of therapy. On the way to specifying and describing just what practice might constitute \"collective therapy,\" the article focuses on what Jung specifies as the interconnected nature of the self, the living body, symbolic thought and the basic unity of psyche and body. The article's specification and description of \"col-lective therapy\" is anchored first in a real-life, real-time 20th-century description of the international power of kinetic silence. The article then documents the historical nature of that power by way of classicists' descriptions of real-life, real-time community circle dances that silently attest to the value of moving in concert. K E Y W O R D S circle dances, collective hysteria and collective therapy, emotions, feeling, living body and symbols of the self, our mother tongue, spirit and matter\n\nIt is impossible to do justice to the question of Jung's relationship to science if it is approached solely from within Jungian discourse. Until Shamdasani's (2003) groundbreaking Jung and the Making of Modern Psychology, there had been little scholarly interest in locating analytical psychology in a wider cultural or historical context [1]. Writings about analytical psychology tended to come from a narrowly Jungian perspective, and were mostly aimed at a narrowly Jungian audience. With regard to the question of science, this endemic parochialism shows up in the form of two contrasting approaches: one characterized by a persistent tone of embattled intellectual defensiveness (Zurich as bunker), and the other which enthusiastically trumpeted any scientific discovery (whether in ethology, quantum physics, or evolutionary science) which could be shown (however implausibly) to prove that Jung had been right all along. Behind these equally unedifying approaches it is possible to distinguish two distinct positions within the tradition of analytical psychology: the first approach, which we might describe as aggressively archetypalist, recognises science as only one archetypal or mythic mode amongst many, while the second derives from a defensive need to obtain recognition for Jungian psychology within the official scientific world at all costs (in order that it might eventually take up its rightful place as a true science). Each of these responses derives from, and can be defended by, a partial reading of Jung; and each reading maintains its claim to validity for as long as its alternative is ignored. It is my contention that a reading of Jung which attempts to overcome this partiality by acknowledging the importance of both aspects to Jung's thought not only has the advantage of being truer to Jung's psychology as a whole psychology, but also offers the only way to gain an better understanding of what Jung intended to achieve with that psychology. My contention is that while Jung's psychology does indeed seek to be seen as part of the western scientific tradition, it does so by offering a radical re-visioning of certain aspects of the very science within which it operates. In order to understand this, we need to recognise the context of Jung's ideas within the wider history of European thought. Such a recognition is in no way intended to diminish the value of Jung's psychology, but rather to allow its full heuristic potential to be released.\n\nDespite it being the focal point of his theoretical system, I argue that Jung&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s notion of the archetypes is one of his least understood concepts because it was nebulous to Jung himself. Jung vacillated between viewing archetypes as analogous to primordial images and ideas inherited from our ancestral past, formal a priori categories of mind, cosmic projections, emotional and valuational agencies, and numinous mystical experience, but the question remains whether a ‘suprapersonal’ or ‘transubjective’ psyche exists. In what follows, I will be preoccupied with tracing the theoretical development of Jung&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s thesis on the collective unconscious, with a special emphasis on the archetypes, and hence pointing out the metaphysical implications of his thought. It is not possible to critique his entire body of work in the context of this abbreviated article; therefore, the reader should be aware that I am limiting myself to a narrow scope of interest in explicating and analyzing the philosophical viability of his major concepts. The greater question is whether the archetypes adequately answer to the question of origins, of an omnipresent and eternal dimension to the nature and structure of psychic reality."
