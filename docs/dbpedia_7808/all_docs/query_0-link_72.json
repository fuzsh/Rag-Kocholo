        "text": "Yesterday, the 2013 installment of Rencontres de Moriond got underway at La Thuile, in the Aosta Valley of the Italian Alps, roughly where Italy, France, and Switzerland come together. (La Thuile is smack-dab between Lyon, France and Milano, Italy, just southeast of Geneva, Switzerland. I would gladly part with a few organs to be there.) This high energy particle physics conference, which runs through March 14, gathers together some of the best and brightest experimentalists and theorists from the world of particle physics.\n\nThe sessions from Wednesday, March 6 will be webcast, and are anticipated to include the latest results of analysis of data from CERN‘s Large Hadron Collider, including the latest info regarding the quest to determine whether the “Higgs-like boson” announced last July 4 is indeed the Standard Model Higgs boson. (Keep in mind that, as of around Valentine’s Day, the LHC is offline until 2015 for repairs and upgrades.) While the July 4, 2012 announcement was a major milestone, further data was still needed to verify that the newly-discovered boson is in fact a spin-0 boson (as opposed to a spin-1 boson such as a photon, W or Z boson, or spin-2 such as the hypothetical graviton), and whether the branching ratios for its decay products are as predicted by the Standard Model. (Gamma-gamma counts were a bit high at that point, although still within error bars, and the rare tau-anti-tau signal had yet to be observed by CMS.) I don’t expect breakthrough-level announcements on this front just yet, as that will likely have to wait until more data is collected after the LHC upgrade, but the picture painted by the data collected thus far should start to grow a bit more clear as statistical fluctuations start to get dampened by larger and larger datasets.\n\nBut what I am really interested in seeing is news about supersymmetry (or SUSY for short). To see why, it might be fruitful to step back and take a look at the announcements from the last major conference like this.\n\nBack in November of 2012, theoretical and experimental particle physicists from around the globe, especially those involved with experiments at CERN‘s Large Hadron Collider, gathered in Kyoto, Japan to attend the Hadron Collider Physics Conference (HCP 2012). Events such as this are a big deal for physicists. Not only are they golden opportunities to network with colleagues from around the world, swapping phone numbers, email addresses, and ideas, but they are also prime opportunities to present results.\n\nAnd boy were there results.\n\nThe results are perhaps not as earth-shaking as July’s announcement of the tentative discovery of the Higgs boson, but big nonetheless. There was more analysis related to characterizing the Higgs discovery based upon more data, the observation of a new composite particle, observation of mixing, and, perhaps biggest at all, data which casts the body of theories known as supersymmetry into further doubt (or not: more on that in a bit).\n\nSo, what the heck is SUSY, anyway?\n\nI’ll start with the big one, SUSY. But perhaps I should first clarify what the heck it is.\n\nSupersymmetry (or SUSY for short) is a concept conceived in the early seventies. SUSY is a proposed approach to extending the Standard Model of Particle Physics in such a way that, for every particle in the Standard Model, there exists a corresponding supersymmetric partner particle of opposite spin type. For each SM fermion (electron, neutrino, quark), there is a supersymmetric boson (selectron, sneutrino, squark). For each SM boson (photon, W or Z boson, Higgs), there is a corresponding supersymmetric fermion (photino, wino, zino, Higgsino). Ordinarily, the superpartners would be expected to have the same masses as their SM partners, so they would have been observed already; but, via a spontaneous symmetry breaking process, the superpartners are imbued with higher mass. Most versions of SUSY models put the masses for the lighter superpartners (such as sneutrinos and gluinos) within a range detectable by the LHC.\n\nThe beauty of SUSY models is that they provide mechanisms for explaining some phenomena which the Standard Model fails to answer, such as the Hierarchy Problem and providing candidate particles for dark matter. By the early eighties, SUSY theories had grown quite popular among theoretical physicists, so much so that they came to be incorporated into many variants of string theory (to such a degree that many, but not all, versions of string theory depend upon SUSY being correct). All that has been left has been the detection of these supersymmetric partner particles.\n\nYes, and?\n\nWell, thus far, results from the LHC have not been very promising for SUSY. With each data release, the parameter space of possible SUSY models gets more and more constrained as various SUSY versions get ruled out. Already, portions of the parameter space which make SUSY useful for addressing the Hierarchy Problem have largely been ruled out. The latest round of results released in Kyoto are no different. However, as the blog postings listed below by Professor Matt Strassler point out below, not all of the results reported at Kyoto were a blow to SUSY. While more mass ranges for potential supersymmetric partners have been excluded, revised figures regarding the decay of Bs mesons actually relax other constraints on the SUSY parameter space. In short, the results announced at Kyoto put us no closer to knowing whether SUSY is valid or not.\n\nBBC News – LHC results put supersymmetry theory ‘on the spot’ (from 2011)\n\nIs there any particle physics beyond the standard model? – Starts With A Bang\n\nString Theory Now on Life Support – Blog\n\nSignificance In Presence Of Systematics, And The LHCb Observation Of Bs Decays To Pion Pairs\n\nRÉSONAANCES: BS and SUSY\n\nPhysicists Debate Future of Supersymmetry | Simons Foundation\n\nFirst News from Kyoto Conference | Of Particular Significance\n\nTheory Killers at the HCP conference | Of Particular Significance\n\nWhy Theories Don’t Go Into Hospitals | Of Particular Significance\n\nRemember That “Blow” to Supersymmetry (And Other Theories)? | Of Particular Significance\n\nDetails Behind Last Week’s Supersymmetry Story | Of Particular Significance\n\nThe State of SUSY | Not Even Wrong\n\nMeanwhile, on the Higgs front….\n\nNothing earth-shattering was reported on the Higgs front. Results were presented based upon twice as much data as was used for the July 4 announcement. Error bars were tightened at bit, and the data was looking a little better for the tau-anti-tau channel. Still more data is needed.\n\nThe mystery remains on the Higgs boson | Quantum Diaries\n\nRÉSONAANCES: Higgs: what’s new\n\nHiggs update: steady as she goes | Jon Butterworth | Life & Physics | Science | guardian.co.uk\n\nNew Higgs results bring relief—and disappointment : Nature News & Comment\n\nHiggs Results at Kyoto | Of Particular Significance\n\nSummary of New Higgs Results | Of Particular Significance\n\nA new particle!\n\nWell, it isn’t a new elementary particle, but rather a composite particle made up of quarks.

Neutral meson mixing had long been predicted, and had in fact been confirmed with kaons, B-mesons, and strange B-mesons, but this was a first for D-mesons.\n\nBasically, what is happening here is that what starts off as a neutral D-meson can later be detected as a neutral anti-D-meson. This oscillation occurs for exactly the same reason that neutrino flavor oscillation can take place: the mass and flavor eigenstates are different. But that is a discussion for another time.\n\nMixing it up | Quantum Diaries\n\narxiv.org/pdf/1211.1230.pdf “Observation of D0-D0 oscillations” by the LHCb collaboration.\n\nSumming Up, and Looking Forward\n\nSo that was the news out of Kyoto in November. I’m a bit late getting around to commenting on it (life getting in the way and such); but, with Moriond getting underway, it seemed worth a look back. Now to wait and see what tidbits trickle out from the Alps….\n\nIn the wee hours of tomorrow morning, the latest crop of recipients for the Nobel Prize in Physics will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. As always, there is considerable speculation about who will get the nod. Contrary to what many might assume, it is doubtful that Peter Higgs and his cohorts will be announced as recipients, at least not this year. More on why in a bit.\n\nSo, who will be snagging the prize? As outlined at ScienceWatch (as well as numerous other places), the front runners are:\n\nStephen E. Harris and Lene V. Hau for their work with “slow light“.\n\nLeight T. Canham for his discovery of photoluminescence in porous silicon.\n\nCharles H. Bennett, Gilles Brassard, and William K. Wootters for their work on quantum teleportation. (Cue non-applicable Star Trek references in 3…2…1.)\n\nFor other predictions, see the following:\n\nThomson Reuters Predicts 2012 Nobel Laureates | Reuters\n\nNobel Prize 2012: The scientists, writers, and peace-mongers who are favored to win the famous awards. – Slate Magazine\n\nNobel prize predictions released – USATODAY.com\n\nNobel Prizes 2012: predicted winners | Dean Burnett | Science | guardian.co.uk\n\nPhysics Buzz: Standing at the Wavefront of Scientific Discovery: A leadup to the Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nSo, why not Peter Higgs?\n\nGiven that the discovery of the Higgs boson has been hailed as one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs thus far this century, why wouldn’t the prize go to those who predicted it almost half a century ago?\n\nWell, eventually Higgs and his cohorts will undoubtedly be recognized by the Nobel Committee. The problem right now is that the discovery of the predicted Higgs boson is still somewhat preliminary, and the Nobel Committee prefers to award the Physics prize on the basis of work that is on a firm footing. A new boson has been discovered at the Large Hadron Collider. Of that there is no doubt at this time. At least at a cursory level, it looks pretty much like the Higgs boson as predicted by the Standard Model, but more data collection and analysis are needed to confirm this. That confirmation needs to take place on two fronts: branching ratios, and spin. It is these final confirmations which will ultimately determine whether it is the Standard Model Higgs that has been discovered (which, frankly, would be a rather anti-climactic outcome), a variant of the Higgs from an extension of the Standard Model (wee, new physics), or something completely unexpected (double wee, REALLY new physics).\n\nBranching Ratios\n\nA long-standing maxim in particle physics is that if it is possible for something to happen, it will happen. It might happen rarely, but it will happen.\n\nWhen a particle decays, there are generally many decay paths it can take. A sufficiently large population of such particles will take all available decay paths. The percentages of events that follow each decay path are collectively referred to as the branching ratios for that decay, and a given theoretical model can provide predictions of what those branching ratios will be.\n\nThis is no less the case with the Higgs boson. Of the decays observed thus far for the newly-discovered boson, there seems to be a slight excess in the rates for the di-photon decay mode compared to Standard Model predictions. There is also a lack of already-rare double-tau decays. If these deviations are just statistical anomalies, they should go away as more data is collected. Otherwise, we may be looking at new physics! The remainder of this year’s data collection run at the LHC should settle this issue once and for all.\n\nSpin\n\nThe other aspect the requires clarification is spin. LHC researchers know from the decay products detected thus far that the new particle is not a fermion (a particle with half-integer spin, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons), but is instead a boson (a particle with integer spin). There is simply no way to add up the spins of the decay products to add up to a fermionic parent particle. The new particle must have integer spin. The question now is what that integer is. Intermediate vector bosons such as photons and W and Z bosons have a vector spin of 1. The hypothetical quantum intermediary for gravitation, the graviton, is expected to have a spin of 2 if it exists. (Why this is the case is, in of itself, an interesting story, but we’ll save that for another day.)\n\nThe Higgs boson, as predicted by the Standard Model, should be a spin 0 scalar boson. If the new boson has any spin other than 0, we know right off the bat that we are not dealing with a Standard Model Higgs. So, how do we make that determination?\n\nOne somewhat complicated way is by studying the angular distribution of the decay products. This approach is described here. A somewhat more straightforward approach is to take advantage of the data collected for confirming the branching ratios, because the decay products help constrain the possibilities. Here’s how.\n\nFirst of all, there is something basic to the way these spins work that needs to be understood to follow the line of reasoning that I’m about to describe. Due to the fact that they have mass, the W and Z bosons can do something that photons can’t do. Whereas a photon can be measured as having a spin of +1 (spin “up”) or -1 (spin “down”) along a given axis (usually taken to be the direction in which the particle is travelling), W and Z bosons can also have a “sideways” spin, and can thus be measured as having a spin of +1, -1, or 0 along a given axis (with the spin vector of length 1 being perpendicular to the measured axis). This impacts the spin math below.\n\nSupposing we have a spin 0 particle (like the SM Higgs boson). What combinations of decay products can it have to balance that spin?\n\nDecay Products Spins Photons +1 + -1 Fermions +½ + -½ W, Z bosons 0 + 0\n\n+1 + -1\n\nNote that a spin 1 particle cannot decay to two photons. The math doesn’t add up. Since the new particle has been seen to decay to two photons, we can rule it out as being a spin 1 particle.\n\nFor the spin 2 case, such a particle cannot decay to a pair of fermions. Again, the spins don’t add up properly. A spin 2 particle CAN decay to a pair of fermions plus a gluon (spin 1) though. If we see, for example, a decay to two tau leptons without anything else (which is predicted by the Standard Model for Higgs decays, but has not yet been detected), we know that we can’t be looking at a spin 2 particle.\n\nIn summary, to crib a graphic from Aidan Randle-Conde over at the Quantum Diaries blog, here is the summary of our quest to determine the spin of our new boson:\n\nFor more info on this, have a look at this lovely paper.\n\nSo, Who Gets It?\n\nSo, assuming that all of this does get hammered out (which could quite possibly happen by the end of this year), a Nobel Prize is quite likely in the offing for this breakthrough, at least at some point in the near future. But, as I’ve pointed out in a previous post, this raises the question of who gets it. Although the name of this new boson is inextricably tied to that of Peter Higgs, he did not work on this in isolation. Hammering out the theoretical underpinnings of the Higgs mechanism involved contributions from several individuals, and a single Nobel Prize can only be split among three (living) people at most. Those involved include:\n\nPhillip Anderson, who first crafted the broad strokes of the mechanism\n\nPeter Higgs, who first pointed out that a boson would be produced by the field in question\n\nRobert Brout (deceased)\n\nFrançois Englert\n\nGerald Guralnik\n\nC. R. Hagen\n\nTom Kibble\n\nOne of these gentlemen, sadly, has already passed away. All are well advanced in years. With the passage of a little time, the difficulty of choosing which three to recognize may be rendered moot. But that hardly seems a fair way to settle the issue.\n\nFor more on the history of the Higgs mechanism, see Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism (history) – Scholarpedia.\n\nI’m sure you’ve seen the headlines. In case you’ve been hiding under a rock for the last few weeks, or at least tuning out the news (understandable, given that this is election season), here is a sampling:\n\nStar Trek’s faster-than-light travel possible: NASA scientist | Business Standard\n\nNASA Scientist Developing Star Trek ‘Warp Drive’ « CBS Houston\n\n‘Warp drive’ may be more feasible than thought, scientists say | Fox News\n\nNasa physicist says warp drive is more feasible than thought (Wired UK)\n\nWarp Drives Might Be More Realistic Than Thought | Wired Science | Wired.com\n\nStar Trek’s faster-than-light travel possible: NASA scientist | Business Standard\n\nNASA: Warp drive is ‘plausible and worth further investigation’ | DVICE\n\nNASA Starts Work on Real Life Star Trek Warp Drive\n\nWarp drive at NASA « The Gauge Connection\n\nScientists ponder interstellar travel at NASA-backed space summit | The Raw Story\n\nBut it all traces back to this article:\n\nWarp Drive More Possible Than Thought, Scientists Say | Space.com\n\nThe media frenzy was triggered by comments made by physicist Dr. Harold “Sonny” White of the Eagleworks Lab at NASA’s Johnson Space Center at the 100 Year Starship 2012 Symposium, held September 13-16, 2012 in Houston. The event, branded with the theme “Transition to Transformation … The Journey Begins,” featured numerous guest speakers, mostly scientists, but also including Star Trek actors Levar Burton and Nichelle Nichols (who has a long and successful history of working with NASA on initiatives to recruit women and minorities into science and technology fields).\n\n(This is the second such symposium. The first was held in Orlando in October of last year.)\n\nBacked by the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, the Foundation for Enterprise Development, Icarus Interstellar, and grants from DARPA and NASA, the 100 Year Starship Initiative is a non-government entity founded in January of this year with the goal of persuing and encouraging public and private initiatives to make interstellar space flight achievable within a century.\n\nSo, what did Dr. White say at this symposium to create such buzz?\n\n“There is hope.”\n\nWell, he said a bit more than that, but explaining requires a bit of back story.\n\nIn the Beginning, there was Alcubierre\n\nFor many decades, the bending of space-time has been a conceit long favored by science fiction writers as a workaround for dealing with the daunting (and, literally, astronomical) distances involved in interstellar space flight. But, within the scientific community itself, the idea of “warp drive” had been mainly a topic of idle speculation, with few scientists finding the prospect realistic as a practical means of spacecraft propulsion.\n\nThen, in 1994, Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre published a paper 1 outlining what has come to be known as the Alcubierre drive, the first example of a physicist earnestly tackling the mathematical heavy lifting of exploring the concept in depth. In the paper, Alcubierre defined a space-time metric (and its associated stress-energy tensor) in which space in front of the ship is contracted, and the space behind the ship is expanded. These contracting and expanding regions of space-time propagate as waves, with the spacecraft riding along in a flat region inside this warp bubble, not moving with respect to the space in which it sits, and thus experiencing no inertial effects.\n\nWhat makes this conceptually possible is that at no point is the spacecraft itself moving faster than light with respect to the space-time manifold in which it is embedded. Such superluminal motion is of course forbidden by relativity. However, relativity does not forbid space-time itself from expanding or contracting faster than lightspeed. In fact, an important component of modern cosmology is the concept of “inflation,” a brief period during the beginning moments of the universe in which space-time expanded at a superluminal rate.\n\nBut, as intriguing as this is, there are problems with Alcubierre’s idea. First of all, while Alcubierre showed that it is indeed theoretically possible for such a warp bubble to exist, we still have no idea how to generate one. Krasnikov and Coule2,3 have argued that constructing such a field would require constructing the fields in motion such they are already moving at superluminal velocities. In other words, creating a warp drive requires the existence of a warp drive.\n\nIn 2002, a paper appeared4 arguing that it would be impossible for the crew of a ship utilizing an Alcubierre drive to send signals to the front of the warp bubble, rendering it impossible for them to steer or stop the ship. A 2009 paper5 suggested that the crew of such a ship would be subjected to intense amounts of Hawking radiation; although, in this context, it might be more accurate to refer to it as Unruh radiation.\n\nBut, perhaps the biggest obstacle was one of energy. This problem was two-fold. One was a requirement for the creation of a region of intense negative energy density, a feat which would require the existence of some form of exotic matter with properties which, while not forbidden by the laws of physics, is not known to exist. The other aspect of the problem was one of magnitude. Pfenning and Ford6 estimated that the energy equivalent of -1064 kg would be needed, a magnitude greater than the estimated mass of the known universe. Furthermore, it was argued in the same paper that the exotic matter ring required to establish the needed negative energy density geometry would have to be an impossibly thin structure.\n\nIn a 1999 paper7, Chris Van Den Broeck tackled the issue of how much energy would be required to produce a warp bubble. By modifying the geometry of the bubble, he came up with a configuration which reduced the energy needed to transport a handful of atoms to roughly three solar masses. Krasnikov8,9 then built upon this work to reduce the energy requirements to just a few milligrams. (Remember, this is for generating a warp bubble containing just a TINY amount of matter.)\n\nDr. White’s Findings\n\nA paper has yet to be published (or even pre-printed on arXiv.org) outlining Dr. White’s latest work, but in his presentation at the 100YSS conference, he revealed that his calculations show that by replacing the flat ring of exotic material with more of a toroidal shape, the energy requirements for a 10m warp bubble traveling at 10c would be reduced from the equivalent energy bound up in the mass of Jupiter to that of a mass of 500 kg. On top of that, he claimed that his calculations show that causing the intensity of the space warp to oscillate reduces the energy requirement even more.\n\n“The math would allow you to go to Alpha Centauri in two weeks as measured by clocks here on Earth,” White said. “So somebody’s clock onboard the spacecraft has the same rate of time as somebody in mission control here in Houston might have. There are no tidal forces, no undue issues, and the proper acceleration is zero. When you turn the field on, everybody doesn’t go slamming against the bulkhead, (which) would be a very short and sad trip.”\n\n“The findings I presented today change it from impractical to plausible and worth further investigation,” he told SPACE.com. “The additional energy reduction realized by oscillating the bubble intensity is an interesting conjecture that we will enjoy looking at in the lab.”\n\nThe lab? Yes, the lab. Dr. White has devised an apparatus to test this concept on a table-top scale at Johnson Space Center. Known as the White-Juday Warp Field Interferometer, this experiment is designed to look for perturbations in space-time on a scale of one part in 10 million. Not enough to propel a space craft, but enough to provide a proof of concept. If it works.\n\n“Although this is just a tiny instance of the phenomena, it will be existence proof for the idea of perturbing space time-a “Chicago pile” moment, as it were. Recall that December of 1942 saw the first demonstration of a controlled nuclear reaction that generated a whopping half watt. This existence proof was followed by the activation of a ~ four megawatt reactor in November of 1943. Existence proof for the practical application of a scientific idea can be a tipping point for technology development.”\n\nSomewhat similar to the Michelson-Morley experiment used to disprove the existence of the luminiferous æther in the late 19th century, the device can also be thought of as a scaled-down version of the interferometer experiments currently being used in attempts to detect gravitational waves, a phenomenon predicted by general relativity. The primary difference with the White-Juday Warp Field Interferometer is that one arm of the light path passes through a 1 cm diameter toroidal capacitor ring.\n\nOf course, this ring will generate a region of positive energy density, not a region of negative energy density as needed by the Alcubierre drive concept. Nevertheless, if it works, it would be a splendid proof of the ability to manipulate space-time in an energy-efficient manner. And if anyone happens to have a few tons of negative energy density unobtainium on hand, I’m sure that Dr. White and his team would love to hear from them.\n\nReferences:\n\nAlcubierre, Miguel (1994). “The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity”.

Since I suspect that it is something a great many other folks are probably unclear about, I thought I would share my response here.\n\nBasically, the point of confusion is regarding the phrasing of the official statements out of CERN indicating that they have found a particle that is “Higgs-like.” Why not come right out and say they have found the Higgs boson? Have they or haven’t they?\n\nYes and no.\n\nThe current situation brings to mind a joke that was circulating around December’s announcement of preliminary results:\n\n“We have not yet found the Higgs, and it has a mass of 125 GeV.”\n\nPhysicists have to be a little circumspect with their claims. The researchers at CERN can currently state with a high degree of confidence that they have discovered a new particle, and that particle possesses properties which STRONGLY resemble those of the Higgs particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\nHiggs decay channels:\n\npp → h → bbˉ\n\npp → h → γγ\n\npp → h → τ+τ−\n\npp → h → W+W−\n\npp → h → ZZ\n\nBut the resemblance is not exact. The Standard Model (SM) Higgs can decay in multiple ways, and the Standard Model provides mathematical tools for predicting the probability for the decays to occur along these different channels. (Physicists call these probabilities “branching ratios.”) The particle observed at CERN is seen to decay with same decay products, but with branching ratios similar to, but not quite the same, as those predicted for the SM Higgs. For example, decays to a pair of photons (di-gamma decays) are being seen slightly more frequently than expected, but decays to tau-antitau lepton pairs are hardly being seen.\n\nTo be fair, the tau-antitau decays are tricky to discriminate from the background anyway, so their scarcity (and the di-gamma excess) may merely be a statistical fluke which will fade away as even more data is collected. Analysis of LHC data is very much a numbers game. The more data that is collected, the better. If these discrepancies vanish with the collection of more data, then we will eventually be able to say that we have discovered the SM Higgs.\n\nBut there is another possibility. This new particle may not be exactly the SM Higgs. It may be “a” Higgs boson, but slightly different in nature to the one predicted by the Standard Model. And this prospect is actually more exciting to physicists, because that implies new physics beyond the Standard Model. Although the Standard Model has been wildly successful over the last few decades, having been experimentally verified time and time again with excruciating precision, it has holes in it. It doesn’t get along with General Relativity, and thus does not explain gravity. It does not address several recently discovered phenomena such as dark energy, dark matter, and neutrino mass. And it does not address the hierarchy problem, which has to do with why the fundamental interactions of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force) have such different strengths.\n\nPhysicists know that they need to move beyond the Standard Model to address these problems, and over the last several decades, many extensions to the Standard Model have been proposed to accomplish this, including string theory, supersymmetry (SUSY), and technicolor theories. As it turns out, most of these alternative theories also incorporate the Higgs interaction, with some variants predicting MULTIPLE types of Higgs boson. String theory has turned out to be agonizingly difficult to test since it is flexible enough to accomodate just about any experimental outcome by twiddling its parameters, and data from the LHC has already eliminated many variants of SUSY and technicolor theory. It remains to be seen if some variant of one of these theories will eventually supplant the Standard Model, or something else entirely, but such an advancement would need to be based upon hard data. Finding a non-SM Higgs boson and measuring its properties would provide that. And finding multiple sorts of Higgs bosons, well, that would be a bonanza, greatly narrowing down the types of extensions to the Standard Model that would work.\n\nIn other words, this discovery isn’t the end of the story. It is just the beginning of another chapter.\n\nWhat It Means to Find “a Higgs”: Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, Day 3 | Observations, Scientific American Blog Network\n\nBackreaction: Hello, Higgs.
