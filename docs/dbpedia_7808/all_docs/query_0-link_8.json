Particles and atoms that have whole-number spin are described by other rules and equations than those that have half-number spin. Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein predicted in 1924 that at very low temperatures atoms with whole-number spin would be able to concentrate themselves in the lowest energy state and form a Bose-Einstein condensate. In 1995 Carl Wieman and Eric Cornell succeeded in proving the phenomenon in a rarefied gas of rubidium atoms at an extremely low temperature.\n\nCarl E. Wieman – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2022.\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations”\n\nPrize share: 1/3\n\nWork\n\nThe Hall effect refers to the fact that if an electrical current flows lengthwise through a metal band and a magnetic field is placed against the surface of the band at a right angle, a charge arises diagonally in the band. In interfaces in certain materials a quantum Hall effect occurs. After Horst Störmer and Daniel Tsui discovered that changes in the magnetic field result in changes in Hall conductance that vary in steps that represent fractions of a constant, Robert Laughlin explained the phenomenon in 1983 with the formation of quasiparticles and a kind of quantum fluid.\n\nRobert B. Laughlin – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2022.\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light”\n\nPrize share: 1/3\n\nLife\n\nStephen Chu was born in St. Louis, Missouri, into an academic family of Chinese heritage. He excelled at school and as a child liked to build models before becoming interested in chemistry experiments. He studied physics at the University of Rochester and continued his studies at UC Berkeley. There he began with theoretical physics until he realized that experimental physics was his calling. After Berkeley he did his Nobel Prize-awarded work at Bell Labs. Chu served as United States Secretary of Energy from 2009 to 2013. He is married to physicist Jean Fetter, and the couple has two sons, Geoffrey and Michael.\n\nWork\n\nAt room temperature atoms and molecules in the air move about at breakneck speed. In order for them to be studied, they need to be slowed down or chilled. During the 1980s Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, and William Phillips developed different methods for this. When atoms come in contact with light particles with fixed energies, photons, their movement is affected as if they had been bumped. With the aid of laser light from different directions and adjustment of the photon’s energy for Doppler effects, the atoms can be cooled to extremely low temperatures and captured in a trap.\n\nSteven Chu – Facts.

Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2022.\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for their discovery of superfluidity in helium-3”\n\nPrize share: 1/3\n\nLife\n\nDouglas Osheroff was born in Aberdeen, Washington, into a family with Eastern European roots and many medical professionals. He became interested in science early and engaged in dangerous experiments in his free time. He studied at Caltech, an inspiring environment where Richard Feynman lectured, and continued his education at Cornell, where he studied low temperature physics and met his wife, Phyllis Liu. After a subsequent 15 years at Bell Labs, he moved to Stanford to pursue his talent as a teacher.\n\nWork\n\nWhen certain substances are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they become superfluid, flowing without any friction. This applies to helium-4, the most common form of helium, but for a long time the superfluidity of helium-3 was in dispute. The different types of helium are described by different quantum mechanical rules and equations under which helium-4 has a whole-number spin while helium-3 has a half-number spin. In 1972 Douglas Osheroff, David Lee and Robert Richardson verified that helium-3 also becomes superfluid at extremely low temperatures.\n\nDouglas D. Osheroff – Facts. NobelPrize.org.

Melvin Schwartz, Leon Lederman, and Jack Steinberger managed to create a beam of neutrinos using a high-energy accelerator. In 1962, they discovered that, in some cases, instead of producing an electron, a muon (200 times heavier than an electron) was produced, proving the existence of a new type of neutrino, the muon neutrino. These particles, collectively called “leptons”, could then be systematically classified in families.\n\nMelvin Schwartz – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2022.\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for their contribution to the development of laser spectroscopy”\n\nPrize share: 1/4\n\nWork\n\nElectrons in atoms and molecules have fixed energy levels, according to the principles of quantum physics. When there are transitions among different energy levels, light with certain frequencies is emitted or absorbed. This allows atoms and molecules to be analyzed with the help of the absorbed light’s spectrum. With the laser’s coherent and intense light, the measurement phenomenon can occur. In the 1960s, Arthur Schawlow made use of this to eliminate the Doppler effect, allowing him to determine energy levels with great precision.\n\nArthur L. Schawlow – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2022.\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for his pioneering studies of electron scattering in atomic nuclei and for his thereby achieved discoveries concerning the structure of the nucleons”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nWork\n\nMatter is composed of atoms with small nuclei surrounded by electrons. Robert Hofstadter developed apparatus for studying nuclei’s internal structure. A high-energy electron beam from an accelerator was directed towards nuclei and by examining the scattering of the electrons, he could investigate how charges were distributed. He could also investigate how the magnetic moment within the nuclei’s protons and neutrons was distributed. Nuclei were thereby proven not to be homogeneous, but to have internal structures.\n\nRobert Hofstadter – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2022.\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for his discoveries concerning the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nWork\n\nAccording to Niels Bohr’s atomic model, a photon is emitted when an electron descends to a lower energy level. This results in a spectrum with lines corresponding to the different energy levels of different atoms. It appeared that the lines were divided into several lines close to one another, which Paul Dirac tried to explain in a theory. However, in 1947 Willis Lamb used precise measurements to establish what became known as the Lamb shift: what ought to have been a single energy level in the hydrogen atom according to Dirac’s theory actually was two nearby levels with a small difference in energy.\n\nWillis E. Lamb – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2022.\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\nPrize motivation: “for their development of new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements and discoveries in connection therewith”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nLife\n\nFelix Bloch was born in Zurich, Switzerland, the son of a merchant, and studied at ETH and elsewhere. When the Nazis took power in 1933, he left Europe to work at Stanford University. After becoming an American citizen, he worked on atomic energy in Los Alamos during World War II and later on radar at Harvard University. Immediately after the war, he did his Nobel Prize-awarded work at Stanford. He became the first head of CERN outside Geneva in 1954-1955. Bloch was married and had four children.\n\nWork\n\nProtons and neutrons in nuclei act like small, rotating magnets. Atoms and molecules therefore align in a magnetic field. Radio waves can disturb their direction of rotation, but only in certain stages, in accordance with quantum mechanics. When the atoms return to their original positions, they emit electromagnetic radio waves with frequencies characteristic of different elements and isotopes. In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell developed methods for precise measurement, making it possible to study different materials’ compositions.\n\nFelix Bloch – Facts. NobelPrize.org.
