        "text": "Here's my conversation with Craig Jones all about jiu jitsu. Craig is a legendary jiu jitsu personality, competitor, and organizer of the CJI tournament that offers over $2 million in prize money. Basically, he is running a tournament where most of the money goes to the athletes and ticket profits go to charity. https://lnkd.in/gN9zmTEV\n\nI think that neither Trump nor Harris will destroy America if elected president. Call me crazy, but I think that Trump is not a fascist and Harris is not a communist. I think this is a reasonable rational position, but according to the internet it's insane ü§£ Either way, getting attacked by both sides has been mentally exhausting for me. Perhaps that's the design of the current political climate: anyone with moderate open-mindedness needs to be pushed out in favor of a \"battle\" between dogmatic extremes. This doesn't seem like the right path toward truth.\n\nI'm putting together a page where people can make suggestions on how I can improve. This is a quick early draft. Please take the survey & let me know how it can be improved: https://lnkd.in/gqWKvY4y\n\nI'm looking to host a long-form debate on politics: Trump, Harris & the presidential election. Let me know if you have suggestions for who can represent the left and the right. My goal is for it to be a good-faith, interesting discussion between 3-5 people, and go for 5+ hours.\n\nIOC is copyright-striking clips of the Olympics. This goes against the spirit of the Olympic Games. As the charter states, the IOC must \"ensure the widest possible audience in the world for the Olympic Games.\" Make it accessible to everyone, everywhere on all platforms.\n\nIt's always a cool experience when I'm thinking deeply about a problem for awhile, and a good idea suddenly appears. It really feels like that idea came from somewhere else, like my brain is connected to some bigger collective intelligence that I can query subconsciously. What a weird and beautiful mystery this whole thing is.\n\nTwo supermassive black holes (Phoenix A and TON 618) compared to our solar system (white oval at the center). This reminds me how weird the universe is and how vulnerable our existence is here on Earth. We're lucky to be here. Let's try not to mess it up ‚ù§"
