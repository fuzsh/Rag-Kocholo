        "text": "copyright 2019, Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media\n\nJump Cut, No. 59, fall 2019\n\nContemporary Tamil cinema and its departure from the mainstream:\n\nManusangada/Cry Humanity and To Let\n\nby Swarnavel Eswaran\n\nTamil cinema and its discontents\n\nTamil-language cinema during the 1970s had little art cinema or a parallel cinema movement as occurred in Malayalam or Kannada. While Telugu-language cinema, the other major film industry in South India, has had occasional art films by famous directorsâlike Oka Oori Katha (The Marginal Ones, dir. Mrinal Sen, 1977), Anugraham (Grace, dir. Shyam Benegal, 1978), which was simultaneously made in Hindi as Kondura, Maa Bhoomi (Our Land, dir. Goutam Ghose, 1979), Daasi (The Courtesan, dir. B. Narsing Rao, 1988), and Matti Manushulu (Mud People, dir. B. Narsing Rao, 1990)âTamil cinema still lacks the aura of such art cinema legends. Even though the iconic John Abraham made his film Agraharathil Kazhuthai (Donkey in a Brahmin Village, 1977) in Tamil, it was not enough to deflect criticism regarding the lack of seriousness in Tamil film. There’s also been occasional experimentation within the mainstream, as seen in Tamil films like Andha Naal (That Day, dir. S. Balachandar, 1954), and in that middle-of-the-road cinema between the arthouse and the mainstream, like Uthiripookkal (Strewn Flowers, dir. J. Mahendran, 1979). However, particularly in the last two years, a more consistent effort at challenging the norms of mainstream cinema could be perceived in the films of Amshan Kumar (Manusangada), Ra. Chezhiyan (To Let), and Lenin Bharathi (Merku Thodarchimalai/Western Ghats, 2018). The first two of these films are closely examined here. In spite of a popular Tamil saying, “Thani maram thoppagaathu/A single tree cannot be considered as a grove,” these two films point to a hopeful beginning of a more serious, parallel Tamil cinema. Â Â\n\nTamil cinema usually incorporates the popular narratives interspersed with song sequences. Some experiments have gone on within this tradition, and certain decades have been distinct. For instance, in the 1970s, Tamil cinema broke the shackles of the studio system and moved outdoors, particularly to actual locales in villages, in order to realistically narrate the predicament of people living away from the capital city of Madras (now known as Chennai). Filmed locales also moved away from artificially constructed village sets in places like Kundrathur in the outskirts of the city, the headquarters of many of the significant studios and the South Indian film industry. Still, serious film critics during the 1970s castigated Tamil cinema for its lack of investment in an alternative cinema. For instance, Chidanand Das Gupta writes,\n\n“In spite of the brief promise held out by the powerful if literary work of writer D. Jayakantan more than a decade ago (Unnaipol Oruvan, Someone Like You, 1966), the Tamil cinema has failed to throw up any major talent or movement outside of the commercial cinema whose mores, if anything, are worse than those of Bombay. With taxes rationalized by a film actor chief minister, the commercial cinema is burgeoning, its success preventing the emergence of any counterforce. In the remaining South Indian language of Telegu, the only notable work, in spite of governmental incentives, has been that of outsiders Mrinal Sen and Shyam Benegal.”[1] [open endnotes in new window]\n\nWhen Das Gupta wrote this in 1980, he is referring to the state of Tamilnadu’s iconic film star MGR (M.G. Ramachandran) who became its Chief Minister in July 1977. Unlike the neighboring state of Karnataka, which gave subsidies to and helped small budget productions, Tamilnadu’s restructuring of the entertainment tax and other concessions favored commercial cinema, which drew large audiences, rather than small budget productions, which had little entertainment value and ran in smaller theaters. Also, Das Gupta points to the literary nature of supposedly “different” Tamil films like Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal (Some People Sometimes, dir. A. Bhimsingh, 1976), which was an adaptation of the well-known Tamil writer Jayakanthan’s novel of the same name. In that case, Tamil cinema historian Theodore S. Baskaran criticized the verbose nature of the film.[2] And he has repeatedly pointed to Tamil cinema’s failure to develop a visual narrative style, a problem from its very beginnings when it was inspired by Parsi drama.[3]\n\nSimilarly, Tamil’s celebrated painter Marudu Trotsky notes how filmmakers’ reliance till the mid-1930s on studios in the state of Maharashtra due to the lack of studios in Tamilnadu’s capital Madras (Chennai) led to the influence of the ornate mythology-inflected painting style of Marathi cinemaâfor instance, as reflected in the Indian cinema pioneer Dadasaheb Phalke’s films, India’s first film Raja Harischandra (1913) and Kaliya Mardhan (Krishna’s Childhood, 1919), among others. According to Trotsky, this trend in Tamil cinema during its early decades has had a lasting impact and has led to the disavowal of the specificity of Tamil culture. This artificiality went on till the mid-1970s when the film society movement brought more awareness about using an aesthetics of realism and depicting an ethnography of communities of people on the social fringes.[4]\n\nCritics like Das Gupta were also responsible for projecting Indian art cinemas in festival circuits abroad, such as the revered Pather Panchali (Song of the Road, dir. Satyajit Ray, 1955). Ironically, this international exposure to art cinema rendered Indian popular cinema less visible outside India, at least till the 1980s. Later, when Indian cinema studies flourished in Western academia, many eminent scholars from the late 1990s on were then invested in recovering the centrality of Hindi popular cinema. Only recently do we see India's regional cinemas, like Tamil, Marathi, and Bengali, etc., getting scholarly attention. But if you look at the international film festivals, Tamil cinema was literally absent during the critical period of the 1970s. This became important in terms of subsequent film studies because for scholars like Aruna Vasudev the 70s was the period of a “New Indian Cinema,” that is, the Indian art film that challenged a cliched and stereotypical mainstream product. To many film scholars, New Indian Cinema means the rise of a new, parallel cinema with new aesthetics, as seen in the work of filmmakers like Shyam Benegal, Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, and Adoor Gopalakrishnan.[5]\n\nHowever, Tamil cinema is conspicuous in its absence from Aruna Vasudev’s book, even if,\n\n“films such as Aval Appadithan (That’s the Way She Is, dir. Arumugam Rudraiah, 1978), Agraharathil Kazhuthai (1978), 16 Vayathinile (At Age 16, dir. Bharathiraja, 1977) and Uthiripookkal (Strewn Flowers, dir. J. Mahendran, 1979), marked by ambiguous and dark protagonists, avoidance of clichÃ©d and cathartic closures, experiments in cinematography and editing, and shooting on locations and new subjectivity, signaled the transition of Tamil cinema from the classical period of the studio system to the post-classical.”[6]\n\nIn fact, there had been Tamil films like Pasi (Hunger, dir. Durai, 1979) which was unique in its portrayal of the extramarital love affair of the truck driver Rangan (Delhi Ganesh) with the ragpicker Kuppamma (Shobha); Pasi juxtaposed melodrama with the realism of shooting on actual locales in the slums in Madras (Chennai). Among recent films, Leena Manimekalai’s Sengadal (The Dead Sea, 2011) is another significant film which addressed the issue of the disappearing fisherman in the backdrop of the displacement of Tamils from Sri Lanka. And in the contemporary period, Vetrimaaran’s Visaranai (Interrogation, 2015) has engaged with police torture through reenactments in a profoundly realistic way. In this trajectory, the iconic cinematographer/director of Tamil cinema, Balu Mahendra’s Veedu (The House, 1988) could be argued to be the inspiration for To Let.[7]\n\nWith Nemai Ghosh`s Pathai Theriyuthu Paar (Look at the New Path! 1960) began \"parallel\" Tamil cinema since the director collected funds from friends so as not to make the compromises that mainstream cinema necessitates. He did not approach regular financiers, so his film was a collaborative effort with many of the investors playing an active role in the production as well. This was the case of the music director, M.B. Srinivasan. The script revolved around workers organizing themselves under oppressive conditions, and in real life, too, the director Nemai Ghosh played an active role in fighting for the reasonable wages of film workers and technicians and organizing and unionizing them in the South. Such a practice of avoiding professional financiers was later followed by Jayakanthan and continues with filmmakers like Amshan Kumar and Chezhiyan. In the films I will analyze here, Manusangada and To Let, the filmmakers’ families were also involved as investors.\n\nDespite some filmmakers’ attempts at working in a parallel cinema so as to create a new aesthetic and subject matter, particularly during the 1970s, the main Tamil film industry has always been perceived as being aligned with mainstream cinema, its popular form evolving over the years by strictly adhering to unwritten rules like dependence on the star system and using tropes of masala, for instance, song and dance and action sequences, and popular genres like melodrama, romance, action and comedy. But in this essay, I wish to challenge such a preconceived notion regarding the “perennial” tendencies of Tamil cinema through a reversal of sorts. Here I draw attention to two very recent films, Manusangada (Cry Humanity! dir. Amshan Kumar, 2017) and To Let (dir. Chezhiyan, 2017). They are now Tamil’s art cinema, appearing during the centennial year of Tamil cinema â the first Tamil film was Keechaka Vadham (The Extermination of Keechaka, dir. R. Nataraja Mudaliar, 1917).\n\nThese two films disavow Tamil cinema’s penchant for heightened melodrama even if the content of both is highly emotional. Mainstream Tamil cinema is marked not only by melos/music and drama but also by the pacing dictated by the cause-effect logic used in Hollywood film. Most Tamil films have a lack of silence in the soundtrack that would give time for the audience to internalize the narrative and from a distance reflect on the problems faced by the protagonists. Even supposedly alternative or different films by iconic filmmakers like K. Balachandar or Bharathiraja are no exception since some of their significant works are even louder and more highly theatrical, particularly in their climactic moments, than normative mainstream Tamil movies. Tamil films have a general aversion to long-duration shots or long takesâthe primary marker of realism to engage with the lived reality of the quotidian protagonists in most art filmsâand they abuse close-ups.\n\nMoreover, even experimentation in the 1970s was punctuated by the indiscriminate use of the zoom lens; this served neither a Hollywood-driven seamless identification with characters nor art cinema’s privileging of a Brechtian aesthetics of distanciation. The two films I am discussing challenge such a mechanical approach, found both in mainstream and off-mainstream Tamil cinema, by seeking a form that suits their content and that disavows the stereotypes of Tamil cinema. For instance, Manusangada and To Let use songs but not in the playback style of much Tamil cinema where the characters lip-synch the song and dance; Manusangada uses the eponymous song for its Dalit politics of protest and To Let recycles older Tamil film songs from the 1980s for nostalgia and romance.\n\nNonetheless, Manusangada and To Let, even as they astutely challenge popular Tamil film conventions, are far removed from each other in terms of their subject matter and style. For instance, if Manusangada recalls Italian neorealism in its aesthetics, it also combines it with the Third Cinema politics of the Latin American films, particularly in presenting the community as an ensemble who seek justice against the state; it attempts to address a contemporary issue with a style that matches its fiery content. In contrast, To Let draws from the languid pace of various art cinema movements across the world that focus on the interiority and alienation of the nuclear family; here, to depict a couple’s struggle and failure to rent an apartment in a global city like Chennai (erstwhile Madras), the film seems to stretch time infinitely.\n\nRealism, long duration shots, and Indian art cinema\n\nOne of the dominant ways in which Indian art cinema marks itself as different is through its investment in realism both in terms of subject matter and style. Even if Bimal Roy’s films like Do Bhiga Zameen (Two Bighas of Land, 1953) were released earlier, Satyajit Ray’s Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road, 1955) marked the beginning of the art cinema movement in India, mainly because of Ray’s consistency in engaging with realism. By 1960, five years from the release of his internationally acclaimed debut film, Ray had five more films to his credit: Aparajito (The Unvanquished, 1956), Paras Pathar (The Philosopher’s Stone, 1958), Jalsaghar (The Music Room, 1958), Apur Sansar (The World of Apu, 1959), Devi (The Goddess, 1960). As Ray himself acknowledged, Italian Neorealism had a significant influence on him, in particular, Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves (1948). Certain production practices tie Ray to the Italian neorealists: use of non-professional actors except for some eminent artists who had a theatrical background, location shooting, minimal use of background music, unhurried narration, and more importantly, the use of long takes or long duration shots that marked a relatively decelerated pace. Ray staged his key moments cinematically, for instance, the passing away of the grandmother or Durga in Pather Panchali, indicating he believed in showing rather than telling.\n\nRay had a strong influence on Indian filmmakers, and his legacy continues till this day in the work of directors like Girish Kasaravalli and Adoor Gopalakrishnan. As far as Tamil cinema is concerned, one could argue such an aesthetic of realism could be found only in Chezhiyan’s To Let. In this context, in one of his recent interviews, Chezhiyan recalls the impact of Bicycle Thieves, speaking of the film in the context of his grandfather:\n\n“His grandfather owned a shop that offered cycles on rent. Often, his grandfather will be missing from home for days chasing a cycle that was not returned on time, coming back not always successfully.”[8]\n\nFilms like Sengadal and Visaranai offered a new kind of social content. For example, Sengadal has a script that focuses on the predicament of Tamilnadu fisherfolk and their struggle against oppression and state violence; Visaranai uses the aesthetic of realism, mainly through its sedate pacing of events, to foreground the plight of tortured innocent prisoners. But Manusangada could be argued to push the envelope further as far as socially committed films in Tamil are concerned as the script engages with the denial of burial for Dalits without any subplot. The film style uses extensive long duration shots with a handheld camera which tirelessly follows the main characters throughout the film.\n\nUsing the long take to frame a narrative is not new to Indian cinema; for instance, in Ketan Mehta's Holi (1984) the style foregrounds rebellion, containment, and oppression. Ghashiram Kotwal (dirs. K. Hariharan, Mani Kaul, Kamal Swaroop, and Saeed Mirza, 1976) also uses predominantly long duration shots to choreograph chunks of its narrative in its imperative to weave history and (contemporary) politics in an experimental mode. That film could also be read as a homage to the Hungarian director MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³, famous for his aesthetics of interrogating history through long duration shots in the vast landscape of Hungary. Manusangada focuses on a burning social issue, and its objective is to protest caste oppression and Hindu hegemony; the point of its script is clear from the beginning. In terms of its investment in subaltern politics, that film is more aligned with the works of leftist thinkers and committed filmmakers like Mrinal Sen, though its style is far removed from his aesthetics, for instance, as in his famous Calcutta TrilogyâInterview (1971), Calcutta 71 (1972) and Padatik (The Guerilla Fighter, 1973). Manusangada in its juxtaposition of the aesthetics of realism and Dalit politics recalls the Third Cinema movement of Latin America which began in the 1960s [9]. More important, the persistent use of the long takes in Manusangada resonates with the tenacity of its protagonist Kolappan and the filmmaker’s own resolve to protest against social injustice based on caste.\n\nManusangada/Cry Humanity:Â a humane cry against persecution of the Dalits\n\nManusangada’s script (written by Amshan Kumar) is inspired by real events that took place in Tamilnadu in 2016 and focuses on the plight of its protagonist Kolappan (Rajeev Anand), who struggles to bury his father. Upper-caste Hindus who live in his neighborhood block him from taking the corpse of his father through the only path in his village that leads to the burial ground. Kolappan is denied his right because he is a Dalit, the lowest caste under Hindu hegemony.\n\nDirector Amshan Kumar has an eye for social issues and is an accomplished documentarian. Manusangada is his second fiction feature after Oruthi (A Woman, 2003), which was based on Kidai (Goat Pen/Enclosure), a novella by Tamil’s critically acclaimed novelist Ki. Rajanarayanan that was set during the colonial period.[10] In this film, the Dalit rebellion is a subtext and is mainly represented through the depiction of the life and times of its young Dalit woman protagonist, Sevani (Poorvaja) who loves a higher caste Hindu man Ellappan (Ganesh Babu), who rear goats for a living in the drought-prone village Aalampatti.\n\n“Without qualms you have Ellappan telling her that even if caste comes in the way of their marriage, he would marry her as his second wife. Sevani agrees since it is a norm.”[11]\n\nOn the one hand Sevani adheres to the prevailing norms of accepting the unwritten laws of a patriarchal polygamous society, but on the other she also rebels against the system by drawing the attention of the British Revenue Officer to the misdeeds of the zamindar/landlord who keeps harassing the villagers after squandering the tax he has collected from them. As a result, the officer orders the people to pay their dues directly to the Government. Nonetheless, as the Hindu critic Malathi Rangarajan points out,\n\n“The irony is that the entire village which is grateful to Sevani for relieving them from the zamindar's turmoil, does not want to come out in the open and support her when she appeals to them for help, when Ellappan's marriage to two women from his own caste is fixed.”[12]\n\nSevani’s protesting voice thus could be heard in Oruthi, but it is subdued. The Dalit rebellion, as epitomized by Sevani during the colonial period, is not emphasized in Oruthi, which focuses on her zest to live despite the odds and on her poignant love story. But in Manusangada, set in contemporary times, the Dalit protest and fight against injustice and claim for equality are in the foreground and explicitly inform the script; here, in contrast to Oruthi, the subtext is the strength that the protagonist Kolappan derives from his community of friends and family to withstand the onslaught of higher caste Hindus, their unjust prejudices and hate politics, and their defiance of law with the connivance of police officers.\n\nManusangada begins with Kolappan as a young man in his mid-20s working in a steel company in Chennai and sharing an apartment with his friends. He receives a phone call from his brother-in-law (Sasi Kumar) that his father died suddenly from a heart attack. He rushes to his village immediately to make arrangements for his father’s burial. On arrival, he is not only overwhelmed by the grief of his father’s demise but the violent bullying of higher-caste Hindus and their refusal to allow his father’s body to be taken along the only common path to the burial ground.Â They want to block the funeral procession through their social power and their ability to silence authorities and ignore the law. Kolappan and his friends rely on the advice of Anna (Sethu Darwin), a benevolent social activist, and meet the police and government officials but to no avail. At this point, Kolappan’s woman friend Revathi (Sheela Rajkumar) arrives to lend him emotional support.\n\nThe next day, Kolappan files a writ in the Chennai High Court to make the upper-caste Hindus abide by the law regarding his freedom to carry the bier with his father’s corpse and give it a decent burial. The judgment favors Kolappan’s reasonable and humane demand, and the judge directs the state machinery to protect Kolappan and his kin from any violence by the members of the upper caste. But when Kolappan and his friends and relatives arrange for the funeral the next day, the police forbid them from carrying the corpse via the regular path reserved for all the castes, saying violence might break out. Kolappan and his friends insist the police execute the court verdict, but the police are adamant; they do not heed Kolappan and his friends’ plea for a peaceful burial and forcefully try to snatch the corpse.Â\n\nLeft with no alternatives, Kolappan and his friends and relatives take the body inside his small house and lock themselves in; they threaten to immolate themselves if the police tried to forcibly enter. As Kolappan and his people are claustrophobically locked inside the room around the body with little space to move, the police become anxious about the immolation threat and its potential legal fallout. Finally, the police seem to give in when the Revenue Divisional Officer (Meenakshi Sundaram) assures Kolappan, who is inside the house, that way is now cleared for them to take the bier along the regular path through the village. On hearing this Kolappan comes outside and proceeds with the tradition of tonsuring his hair before the burial; the funeral rites of decking the bier and the body begin. However, as the bier is carried through the village street, the police, who have been waiting around the street corner, obstruct and halt Kolappan and his people. They swiftly arrest them and forcibly take the body away from them. Then police carry the body through an alternate path full of bushes and thorns away from the village. Kolappan and his people are released later at midnight.Â\n\nÂ\n\nNext morning, when Kolappan and his relatives go to the burial ground to do the final rites for his father, an overnight rain has obscured the site's location, and they can only guess a probable gravesite in the marshy wetland surrounded by thorny bushes. An overwhelmed Kolappan falls on the ground with an agonizing cry. The exact grave cannot be found. Speaking about the probability of something like this happening in daily life, the director Amshan Kumar says:\n\n“The practice of the Dalits [forcibly] obeying and carrying out the will and dictates of upper caste in India had been taking place for a very long time. Not only are they denied sites for burying the dead but even carrying their dead through the streets populated by the upper castes is fiercely opposed. But in recent times, among other things, they have begun to question the age-old practices and customs that undermine their rights for equality in public places. Such occasions are few and far between though.”[13]\n\nIn terms of its script, then, Manusangada fictionally represents events surrounding one such act of Dalit protest which took place in 2016 in a village in Nagapattinam District in the southeastern coast of India. The fictional village, Ammaiyappan, located near Chidambaram, was chosen due to its resemblance to the actual village, and it too had an ambience based on the geopolitics of caste hierarchy. We see that in the placement of Kolappan’s modest house, the town’s main street as the pathway to the burial ground, and the street corner where the police suddenly obstruct the funeral procession.Â Most importantly, Amshan Kumar found it dangerous to film subject matter involving Dalit persecution in actual locales:Â\n\n“Since every village is clamped down by the same caste structure, enacting the events in broad daylight was very hard. The intimidating prospects of shooting getting obstructed and the film crew harmed by the upper caste were looming large every hour. Amidst great difficulty, the film was completed without compromising on the accuracy of details.”\n\nKumar’s objective throughout was to “depict the signaling of the rise of Dalit struggles in contemporary India against long-standing human rights violations.”[14] As he explains, his difficulty doing so points to village upper-caste hegemony and control of many locations; so there is still difficulty portraying the social and physical reality surrounding Dalit oppression now. Kumar’s production goals also reflexively critique the long history of Madras Studios and Tamil film production, which was dominated by the upper castes as stars/actors, technicians, and producers, both in front and behind the camera. Therefore, only recently has it become possible for scriptwriters and directors to clearly mark a film’s main characters as Dalits and narratively engage with upper-caste oppression and segregation.\n\nAll of India has been affected by the rise of the virulent Hindutva political movement. Politicians support lynch mobs who are mainly targeting Dalits, Muslims, and Christians. In particular, the gangs use public beatings and other violent acts to enforce their agenda of “love jihad,” which puts in extreme danger the lives of the Dalits and any upper-caste Hindu girls or boys who fall in love/marry out of caste. The bullying groups also enforce an undemocratic ban on cow slaughter/beef eating.Â Just as the limit event of the Emergency of the mid-1970s, which undermined Indian democracy, sparked the popularity of a film hero who was a rebellious “angry young man,” especially as played by Amitabh Bachchan, India’s present sociopolitics, bordering on religious fascism, may well be the source for contemporary artists’ incisive voice of protest.[15]\n\nManusangada and the centrality of time\n\nThe script of Masusangada is carefully structured. The narrative revolves around the centrality of time due to the burial’s urgency. A commonly occurring \"power cut\" or disruption to the steady supply of electric power to villages prohibits any convenience of delayed burial, particularly for the poor. Beyond the plot, time has significance in Manusangada because the film makes it clear that redressing Dalits’ grievance is an urgent and immediate need. They are the most persecuted and the least privileged community in India from times immemorial to the present. Manusangada’s theme of urgency, articulated here via the imminence surrounding a burial, is not limited to the narrative. It is also visually showcased through the meticulous handheld camerawork of the cinematographer P.S. Dharan, Amshan Kumar’s long-time collaborator. Both the grittiness and raw edge of the handheld camerawork and also the figure of the corpse could be read as metaphors for human anxieties surrounding the immediacy of time/decay. But here the metaphors extend to the (dead) rights of the Dalits as the protagonist is constantly bogged down. He comes back home to face the curtailing of his freedom (and the continually moving camera) to bury his father in the ground reserved for all the social groups in his village.\n\nBy the director’s using a wider lens through most of the sequences, he avoids the more common dramatic aesthetics of frontality and staging.[16] Instead, he chooses a constantly moving camera and its precise framing privilege of an ensemble of characters representing a community on the move despite the odds against them. The actors, most of them with rich experience in prestigious theater groups, also play a significant role in the composition of fluid long takes that defy dramatic frontality and emphasize group process. In this regard, Amshan Kumar has discussed how his documentary filmmaking experience made him rethink about the aesthetics of frontality, here referring to his documentary on the Third Theatre of Badal Sirkar:\n\n“Sirkar was critical of the proscenium arch mode of the traditional theatre wherein the performers have to talk directly to their audience rather than to the fellow characters on the stage. When I watched Sarkar’s play in Calcutta, the artistes acted/played their roles moving amidst the benches in the hall. There were multiple characters at times conversing with other characters in the play at various distances from where we were sitting. While watching it, it dawned on me that it is as the audience that we have to make an adjustment to listen and sparse what is significant for the play and not the other way around.”[17]\n\nSuch an aesthetic of the Third Theatre, which is essentially a people’s or community theatre, is perceptible in Manusangada as well, especially when Kolappan and his friends engage with the police in a heated conversation. Additionally, the improvisational aspect of the re-enactments and the long-take aesthetics provoke a sense of realism as described years earlier by AndrÃ© Bazin about Italian Neorealism,[18] seen here in the bonding between Kolappan and his friends and relatives. The realistic style also is used to lay out Kolappan's apprehensions regarding the arrogance and evil designs of those in powerâthe nexus of upper-caste Hindus and the state, particularly as we see him with police officials and his lawyer.Â\n\nNonetheless, as the unsteady camera frames him, Kolappan's disquietude and restlessness are multi-layered, and various film styles are used to depict his psychological state. He worries about a decent burial of his father's dead body also because of his cultural milieu and ethos. Final rites like the beating of the drum, while carrying the bier to the burial ground and shaving the son’s head, are considered essential aspects of the family's duties towards the departed soul, and here they cannot be performed. All this weighs heavily on Kolappan's mind as he is running against time (and rushing along with the moving camera) right from the film’s very beginning. His troubled face expresses his feelings vividly throughout the film.\n\nAnd in a switch of film styles, Kolappan's such suppressed concerns and fears come to the surface in a distinctly dark dream he has on the night when he returns from the court: He is lying next to his father`s dead body, and in the dream, he falls into a pit. When he begs for help to climb up and out of the slippery mud walls that surround him, he finds to his dismay that people above, instead of lending a hand, are throwing mud on him to bury him alive. It is shot from his point of view, with an avalanche of blurred bodies and the upper-caste people standing above literally and metaphorically making it impossible to haul himself up. The nightmare forebodes his own death as it reflects his deep-rooted apprehensions and grief about living in a heartless society. Here too, Manusangada disavows the general tendency of Tamil cinema to associate dreams with romance and love but instead uses it to summarize a political nightmare.\n\nIn Manusangada’s narrative all the events take place within four days. The film gives a blow by blow account of the significant events, particularly Kolappan’s struggle with authorities to peacefully transport his father’s corpse into the burial ground.Â Time is punctuated on the soundtrack throughout by the dialogue of various characters, reminding Kolappan and us about the dead body and its decomposition. What should usually be family time for grieving together here gets replaced by apprehensive visits to the police station and futile meetings with state officials for permission, useless even if the law is on Kolappan’s side. More importantly, the film acquires its urgency because of the village custom that a dead body has to be buried within a specified time, generally within two days, except in case of certain situations like a post-mortem or waiting for a close relative who has to arrive from a long distance. Otherwise, delaying the burial means disrespecting the dead.\n\nLet us look in detail at the Kolappan’s race against time in this film. Just before dawn, Kolappan receives the news of his father`s death through his cell phone from his brother-in-law, soon after his father had passed away. A shocked Kolappan asks, “Did he die just minutes before at 4.30 a.m.?” Therefore, we can presume that the time he is informed could not be beyond 5 a.m. His roommate offers to drive him in his motorbike to the bus station, and as they ride on the motorbike, the streets are still dark, and the vehicles have their headlights on, informing us it’s before sunrise.Â\n\nWhen his roommate offers to drive him all the way to his village, Kolappan refuses the man’s kind gesture. Instead, he catches a bus and travels, informing us of the reasonable distance he has to travel to reach his village. On his arrival, he learns that upper-caste Hindus are denying them use of the path to the burial ground. Kolappan, along with his brother- in- law and friends plan to visit their advisor, Anna`s house for guidance. They wait for one of their friends to join which results in a delay.\n\nSo when they reach Anna`s house, they find that he had already left for Collector`s/County Administrator’s office. Anna`s wife says that “they missed him just by five minutes.” They know of Anna’s commitments and presume it might take at least two hours for him to return from the Collector`s office. The handheld camera during the above sequences suits the anguished movement of Kolappan.\n\nMeanwhile, they go and meet the Police Inspector and the Revenue Divisional Officer. Their meeting is unproductive, and they return home and wait for Anna. When Anna arrives, it is already late in the day, and he says that nothing more could be done that day. He tells Kolappan that “they would start for Chennai very early morning next day” to meet his lawyer friend. They meet the committed lawyer (Karuna Prasad) who reads out the writ-appeal he has prepared on behalf of Kolappan. However, Kolappan expresses his apprehension that “it might take a long time” since court cases tend to prolong resolution. The lawyer says it is a writ of mandamus, which “is an order from a court to an inferior government official ordering the government official to properly fulfill their official duties or correct an abuse of discretion,”[19] and hence “they will get the verdict the same day.” He asks them “to be in the court at 10 am.”\n\nThe wall clock at his office shows the time is 7.40 a.m. They reach the court on time. After talking to the officials, the lawyer tells them that their case will be taken up in the afternoon. An anxious Kolappan reminds the lawyer that his father`s body is lying unburied. The lawyer consoles him by saying that he will do what’s needed. Unlike in the earlier sequences, the camera is on a tripod and remains steady inside the court during the above scene. The rare moments of steadiness in the film points to the thin ray of hope for justice in an utterly corrupt system due to the presence of the compassionate lawyer, who epitomizes a small minority of lawyers invested in the civil liberties of people on the fringes. The steadiness and the lawyer also bring solace to the despairing Kolappan. The anxieties of Kolappan, framed by the speedily moving handheld camera, seem to dissipate inside the court, due to hoping the possibilities of law and justice will bring balance, as emblematized by the steadiness of the camera on a tripod inside the court.\n\nAfter the favorable verdict, as a goodwill gesture, Anna asks the lawyer to have coffee with them. But the lawyer refuses and urges them “to proceed immediately and not waste time” with such expressions of gratitude. Meanwhile, on the third day, people in the village begin the preparation for the burial. Notices are posted everywhere announcing their victory in the court of law and the time when the funeral would take place. The Police Inspector reminds Kolappan`s family that they have kept the body unburied for three days and thus puts the blame on them for this unnecessary delay. Later when the police do an about turn and threaten to take the body away by force, the villagers take the body inside the hut. The Police warn those inside that “it would not even take five minutes to break open and enter the hut.” Outside Kolappan’s house, a television journalist with cameraman is recording her report on camera. She says that “they have been inside for three hours.” Later, inside the house, Kolappan’s girlfriend Revathi swoons due to feeling suffocated. We hear Kolappan`s relatives say that “the authorities had disconnected power for two hours, so the body kept in the freezer box might begin to rot.” They also express their concern about whether decomposition would provide an excuse for the police to take the body forcibly.\n\nFinally, very late in the day, as they take the body in a procession to the burial ground, their journey is intercepted. A police constable says that “since morning they had not even drunk a cup of tea” and begs them to take the alternate path. After that, the body is snatched away from them, and Kolappan and his kin are taken into police custody. Around midnight (of the third day) they are released. One of the relatives, a woman, taken into custody by the police, says that they were released at 1 a.m. (of the fourth day). On the fourth morning, the wet roads remind us of the rain which fell late last night, and Kolappan now struggles to find the place of the burial by the arrogant and unlawful police. Because he is a Dalit, his civil rightâupheld by the courtâis snatched away. In such a conclusion the film makes a poignant statement about the predicament of and injustice to Dalits: the injustice extends even after their death. The camera remains handheld during these final sequences, but slightly at a distance when compared to the earlier scenes, recalling the Third Cinema aesthetics of privileging the subjectivity of an oppressed community while at the same time offering a distance for us to contemplate their situation. This style changes at the very end when Kolappan falls on the ground and cries in a heartrending way.\n\nRacing against time as a narrative ploy is ubiquitous in Tamil cinema, as instanced by the title of the late director Manivannan’s film; 24 Mani NeramÂ (24 Hours, 1984) where the hero vows and takes revenge on his father’s murderers within 24 hours. Similarly, the recent Chennaiyil Oru Naal (One Day in Chennai, dir. Shaheed Kadar, 2013), a remake of the critically acclaimed Malayalam film Traffic (dir, Rajesh Pillai, 2011), showcases the events that take place at Chennai on a single day â September 16. What distinguishes Manusangada is that, as illustrated above, its painstaking attention to the progression of time also is a meticulous depiction of the protagonist Kolappan’s journey from his village to Anna's house in the vicinity and then to Chennai and back; the film sheds light on how the village itself has changed now. It is no more the village of yesteryears when Dalits were segregated and excluded from the village by being forced to live in a colony on the outskirts (Cheri).\n\nGradually the landscape of a Tamil village is changing and, with lands becoming scarce and expensive, it has one road at the center which passes through the village like the lifeline linking all the houses even as it divides them as separate rows on either side. Caste segregation, instead of disappearing with the colony at the fringes, is now even more strident as higher caste Hindus’ capacity to block the road and deny others’ passage means depriving the Dalits of their freedom to move through town, bringing their life to a standstill. In this context, Kolappan and his friends driving their motorcycles on the highway attains new meaning. The community of friends re-signifies the space, and it is juxtaposed against (their race against) time.\n\n\"On November 4, 1948, [the unparalleled Dalit intellectual and leader, Dr. Babasaheb] Ambedkar said, ‘What is a village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and communalism.'\"[20]\n\nHis words resonate with Kolappan’s village even after sixty years of independence. Nothing much has changed in terms of upper-caste prejudices, communalism, and virulence. Many contemporary Dalit intellectuals have pointed to the Brahmin and upper-caste hegemony in cities and their domination of state institutions and how this dominance deprives Dalits of their legitimate right for education and jobs. For example, the preeminent contemporary Dalit intellectual, Anand Teltumbde, in his critique of the ethnic violence which Hindutva forces inflicted on the Muslims (and Dalits) during the Gujarat carnage, points to the Bania-Brahmin nexus.[21] But Manusangada uses a village, which is anticipating its transition into a small town in these times of globalization, for its narrative. Thus I would argue that by interrogating the predicament of Dalits in an in-between space, between a metropolis like Chennai and a typical village in southern Tamilnadu, Manusangada foregrounds even more clearly the fascistic tendencies of the upper caste and the oppression of Dalits in contemporary India with its unabashed policies of liberalization and privatization and the slogan of “India on the move.”\n\nÂ Â\n\nIn a spirit of protest, the film ends with a song to challenge and confront inequality and injustice: “Manusangada” by the leftist Tamil poet, the late Inquilab:\n\n“We are humans, hey, we are humans\n\nOur anatomy is the same as every one of you.\n\nDo you think we have no iota of self-respect?\n\nDo you expect us to prostrate before your whims?\n\nDoes your soil become impure when we till it?\n\nDoes the food you get through our toil turn impure?\n\nHow do you imagine our corpse impure and yours pure?Â\n\n(Manusangada/We are humans, hey, we are humans)\n\nOur fond dreams, why, our lives too float with the feces we clean in the sewage\n\nOur huts sail in the floods with garbage\n\nOur cries for help reach deaf ears\n\nCaste enmity doesn’t spare killing of one`s own daughter\n\nOn the railway track, our bodies are strewn like wastes\n\n(Manusangada/We are humans, hey, we are humans).”[22]\n\nInquilab’s poem has not only inspired the film’s title and rebellious spirit to take on the might of the higher caste establishment and the state but also the ensemble spirit of the film’s narrative and visual style. We never see heroics from Kolappan. Instead, we experience the spirit of his community, symbolized by his close group of friends both at Chennai and in the village.\n\nThe community of friends in Manusangada\n\nGenerally, in Tamil films, the hero`s friend plays a significant role. He often acts as an ambassador between the hero and his lady love, and he tries to bring about a solution when the hero is caught in the throes of conflict and misunderstanding. In most Tamil films, he is also the virtuous and highly supportive sidekick. Films with big stars generally replace the sidekick with a group of friends. They contribute to the comedy plotline, for instance in the films of Kamal Hassan, or they act as henchmen in attacking a gang of villains, as in the films of Tamil cinema's action heroes like Rajinikanth, Vijay, and Ajit.\n\nManusangada too uses the trope of a community of friends but repurposes it to mark a Â community’s strength against a corrupt and oppressive society. This film’s spatiality, like its temporality, is also insightfully and compellingly designed. In fact, Manusangada is more invested in depicting communal space than geographical. Towards this end, it strives to juxtapose its various characters, mostly in groups of three, four or more, vs. oppressive forces in the following locales: state bureaucracies, the path through town that leads to the burial ground, and the interior and exterior of Kolappan’s home, when the police surround those inside as a threatening dark force. Despite the foreboding tone cast by the oppressive power of the upper-caste townspeople and the state, there is a humane space that Manusangada harnesses from the beginning. Visually we see the mobilization of friends and family at every moment of crisis, and this kind of dramatic blocking sheds light on the film’s investment in the collective voice of the Dalits as a sociopolitical force that is on the move; unlike in the past, this collective force cannot be suppressed. If narrative/social/physical temporality forces Kolappan and his people to rush against time and submit to the verticality of hierarchical caste oppression, the clustered spatiality of friends and (extended) family provides Kolappan a space of solace, comfort, and support to fight the injustice and inequality.\n\nIn terms of cinematography, the consistent use of a wide-angle lens allows for the continued presence of one or other friends in the frame to emphasize their unity for a common causeâto help Kolappan against the ruthlessly brutal acts that prevent the burial. The script sets up two sets of friends in Manusangada. One set is comprised of Kolappan’s friends in Chennai where the workers share accommodation. When they learn about the death of Kolappan`s father, they worry if he has money for funeral expenses, and one of them drops him at the bus stand on his bike. Later, two of them are at Kolappan`s house in the village and have come from the city to participate in the mourning. Also, two of Kolappan's friends from the village stay by him once he lands up in the village. They follow him like his shadow; one of them Murugan (Vidhur) had a mother who had died a few months ago. Murugan too wanted to take her body for burial via the common pathway, but the police had intervened. They seized the body the second day saying it was not kept frozen, and that was the reason why Kolappan ensured that a body-freezer arrive on time.\n\nThe friends go with Kolappan to meet the Revenue Divisional Officer, the Police Inspector and the do-gooder Anna. They do not accompany him to court since they know he is taken care of by Anna, their leader. Otherwise, they stay with Kolappan on all the three days. During the third day, when the electric power supply is cut, Murugan suspects that the police cut the power so as to build a similar case against his family and snatch this body by force as well. The same friends are also charged and taken in the police van when they protest the atrocities at the seizure of the casket and are last seen in the film when released by police at midnight. However, they do not go with Kolappan to the burial site on the fourth morning as his ritual, called Pal Theliyal/Sprinkling of milk, is meant only for relatives. The extreme solidarity they show as a group, their understanding of caste disparity, their questioning attitude, and their belief in non-violence all stand in sharp contrast to the violent hostility of the higher-caste Hindus and the bureaucracy.\n\nManusangada’s importance lies in the Dalit perspective of its narration, as the film is structured through Kolappan’s subjectivity. This is in contrast to earlier Tamil films which often centered around caste disparities, but those films looked down from the top at the Dalit issue, focusing on the upper-caste characters’ point of view. And often in those films, seeming villains ill-treat the Dalits but are reformed by the end as they take pity on the poor. For instance, Tamil cinema’s preeminent film director K. Balachander’s Unnal Mudiyum Thambi (You Can Do It, Bro! 1988). Murugadasa’s Nandhanar (Murugadasa, 1942) is the classic prototype of this genre. Other significant films include Bharati Kannamma (Cheran, 1997) and the poignant Kaadhal (Love, Balaji Sakthivel, 2004) in which the girl’s community of the upper-caste Hindus will not let her reciprocate a Dalit boy's love, and this denial of true love leads him to insanity. In that film, finally, as if to atone for the sins of the community, the husband to whom the girl gets forcibly married steps in to take care of the Dalit. In contrast to that kind of condescending plotline, the film Oruthi was remarkable as it was the first Tamil film to entirely adopt a Dalit perspective. Manusangada incorporates the Dalit perspective in both its script and its visual presentation. For example, it meticulously juxtaposes Dalit subjectivity against the gnawing presence of the upper caste in Dalit lives by framing both groups together in long shots, as in the scene of the failed funeral procession. As the body is taken out on to the main path for burial, the upper caste people silently/connivingly witness from their houses in the background when the body is snatched away by the police.\n\nDalit subjectivity in Manusangada is also expressed by the sound of the Parai (drum), a symbol of the specificity of Tamil Dalits. Within that community, this sound encompasses the history of their oppression and their voices of rebellion, besides being the instrument for expressing their joy and grief. Manusangada aesthetically incorporates Parai discourse as part of its Dalit expressiveness. Parai, which is more popularly known in Tamil as Thappuâan onomatopoeic word, recalling the sound the Parai drum makes when struckâis not appreciated by all Dalits, however.[23] Some want to disassociate themselves from it because they think it reinforces the caste identity/hierarchy, but others believe the drum reasserts their tradition and identity as part of their sociocultural politics. Manusangada thus refrains from a stereotypical use of Thappu as an instrument of mourning. Instead, Thappu is used for celebration. After the court scene, one of the friends (Anand Sampath) in the village tells Kolappan`s brother-in-law that Thappu players will be brought in to celebrate the verdict. Although Kolappan`s brother-in-law cautions against angering the brooding Hindus who lost their case in court, while Thappu is being played, Kolappan responds spontaneously by feverishly dancing to its beat as a release to his pent-up grief.\n\nÂ\n\nThus, through a carefully constructed script, detailed characterizations, and meticulous attention to form, Manusangada fills a void in Tamil cinemaâthe previous lack of a film with finesse and commitment to a cause.\n\nTo Let: a small family in a big city\n\nTo Let (dir. Ra. Chezhiyan, 2017), too, engages with time and space in a unique way. It depicts the restrictions on and constraints of urban family life in a realist way yet unseen in Tamil cinema. Early in the film, the unsympathetic, avaricious, middle-aged female apartment owner (Aathira Pandilakshmi) asks the protagonist Elango (Santhosh Sriram) who lives with his wife Amudha (Suseela) and five-year-old son Siddharth aka Siddhu (Dharun) to vacate his small single-bedroom apartment. To Let, as the title indicates showcases the couple’s persistent, unproductive journey for rental housing in the concrete jungle of Chennai. The director Chezhiyan Ramalingam (aka Ra. Chezhiyan) has a career as a leading cinematographer of contemporary Tamil cinema; his critically acclaimed, award-winning films include Kalloori ((College, dir. Balaji Sakthivel, 2007), Thenmerku Paruvakatru (Southwest Monsoon, dir. Seenu Ramasamy, 2010), Paradesi (Vagabond, dir. Bala, 2013), and Joker (dir. Raju Murugan, 2016). To Let marks Chezhiyan’s debut as a director, and on this film, he is also writer and cinematographer. In his work as a cinematographer, he has worked on exceptional films in Tamil mainstream cinema, and even his dance sequences are not the stereotypical masala (spicy) attractions wherein young men and women gyrate before the camera. He has also picked films with scripts superior to the regular fare of melodrama, comedy, and horror of much Tamil cinema.\n\nWith To Let, Chezhiyan makes a bold move by moving further from the center, particularly at a time when he is in demand as a cinematographer in the prolific and lucrative Tamil film industry. He marks himself as an uncompromising artist, invested in exploring cinema as an art form and pushing its limits. For example, To Let has no scored music track, usually a core element of Tamil cinema. Apart from the sparse dialogue, the soundscape incorporates effects both diegetic and non-diegetic. The absence of a background score is even more unusual considering Chezhiyan is trained in Western classical music and has comprehensively written about it in Tamil, mainly for students interested in learning it. And his wife Prema, producer of the film, herself runs a school in Chennai for Western classical music.\n\nNonetheless, the soundscape is layered with diegetic use old film songs, most of them from the Tamil cinema canon. Chezhiyan is careful not to use contemporary film songs which, in fact, intrude on every aspect of Tamil life and culture. In fact, in an interview, Chezhiyan talks about the predominance of noise which permeates contemporary Indian urban life. He also discusses his interest in invoking old film songs that coexist with other sounds of daily life and have become part of people’s lived reality through their constant presence on radio and television.[24] By layering a soundtrack where these songs standout amidst ambient sound, he is also able to punctuate the nostalgia surrounding these songs, for they provide a much-needed deceleration of pace and offer solace in a global city, which abounds with people’s dreams, expectations, and uncertainties. The old recycled songs are heard in the background during key moments of reflection in the film, and they range from the nostalgic and mellifluous Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathile: “While entranced by this alluring evening” to En Vaanilae Orae Vennilaa: “The solitary moon in my sky.” While the former is heard through an (offscreen) television set, the latter emanates from the transistor radio in the house. Both the songs provide space for enchantment and fascination with the infinite sky, dusk, moon, and stars, away from confinement within walls and a dreary, uncertain life. Here nostalgia refers less to the longing for a past home than to an association with places where Ilango and Amudha were happy, ensconced within the spaces of lovers’ dreams.\n\nTo Let, as the title indicates, deals with their journey searching for a place to live in Chennai. “To Let” indicates the announcement is in English rather than Tamil. Those words appear not only on eagerly viewed signs/billboards advertising some (single bedroom) apartment space but also symbolize the couple’s expectations and apprehensions. More important, the sign also epitomizes the predicament faced by contract laborers in these times of globalization, where getting a place to live depends on a (long) distant buyer/boss who is invisible but pulls the strings. Four minutes into the film, the doorbell rings and by the 7th minute we learn that this family has to vacate their flat. Thereafter, a ringing doorbell triggers anxiety as the landlord and prospective tenants keep barging in and out of their small home, where the owner lives on the floor above.Â\n\nThe film starts with a title card that informs us that with the new millennium, mainly from 2007 onward, with the arrival of the multinationals in Chennai, the information technology sector grew by leaps and bounds, leading to an increasing demand for accommodation from the relatively higher-paid IT professionals. Rents skyrocketed, which profoundly affected middle-class people working in other sectors. From the very beginning, the film informs us of the impact of globalization and the arrival of multinational capital in Chennai, arguably the biggest city in South India. This socioeconomic information prefigures the plight of the protagonist Ilango, who is an aspiring film director and a freelance writer for a modest advertising agency. We then see Amudha and Ilango, who is carrying the sleeping Siddharth, enter their home. The screen is dark initially with scattered light filtering in through the windows on either side of the main door as Amudha comes in, followed by Ilango and Siddharth, and she switches on the light. Such a composition indicates that To Let will be invested in an aesthetic of realism with a focus on place. Through shots edited in linear coherence as the three primary actors move around the house, the interior of their home as well their characters are revealed.\n\nThe sparse living room shows the smallness of the place. From the entrance to the left is a door to the bedroom where Amudha goes to change into her nightie, and at the far end of the house, beyond the living room, to the left is the toilet and to the right is a narrow hallway to the small kitchen. Through successive shots, the constrained space inside the home is traced through the characters’ movements. More about their individual lives is also revealed as they move through the various rooms/places within their home: As Amudha goes inside the door (of the bedroom) to change, Ilango gets busy with draining a clogged toilet. In the meanwhile, Siddharth who was playing with a cardboard fan takes change from his father's shirt pocket and runs to the far right and puts it in his little bank, a small terracotta ball-shaped box, sitting on a cement shelf in the wall near the kitchen.\n\nThere is off and onscreen action in the short hallway to the kitchen wherein Ilango drinks water from a pot and enters the kitchen (offscreen). Through the sound and shadows on the wall, we\n\nsee Ilango's advances and Amudha's (willing) reluctance, giving the awake Siddharth as her reason for hesitancy. She comes in, onscreen, and reacts, expressing her shyness at the moment of intimacy; Ilango had tried to steal a kiss (off-screen) inside the kitchen. Then Ilango enters the frame and stands across from her, his back to the camera, as she expresses her thanks for the outing (to the beach). Then the electricity goes off, and when it comes back on, the doorbell rings, the landlady's daughter enters and says that her mother wants Amudha to come upstairs.\n\nAt this point, Amudha removes the garland of jasmine flowers on her head before she leaves. The jasmine flower is highly significant in Tamil culture, an expression of joy and festivity, beauty and happiness, more importantly of romance and (an invitation to) love. The fact that Amudha chooses not to reveal her delighted state of mind, even as she informs the landlady of her trip to the beach with her husband and son, tells us the owner is happy to see the tenant cringe with the banality of their life. The landlady curtly asks Amudha to vacate in a month's time. In this way To Let initiates its rushing-against-time scenario; they have to leave by the 4th of May, now marked on the family calendar. And indeed, the month-long story of the film ends precisely on the morning of the 4th of May.\n\nThe deadline to vacate hangs even more heavily because the haughty landlady is contemptuous of her tenants and belittles them at every opportunity. Temporal urgency is set right away as the hook for the audience to identify and empathize with the main characters. Amudha’s mood changes when she comes down from the landlady's home, and she behaves curtly with Ilango. First, she gets angry when he leaves the dosa (rice crepe) on the cast iron skillet too long despite her telling him to pay attention to it when she went up, and then she scolds and vents her anger on Siddharth who is wearing the paper-mache mask of a lion and wants to play with Ilango. Amudha then takes out her annoyance on the heavily roasted dosa that is sticking to the pan by aggressively taking it out with the spatula and throwing it the trash can nearby. Earlier, when the electric supply gets cut momentarily, in the darkness Siddharth asks whether his dad is afraid of the dark or the huge dinosaur; Ilango says no to both. Then the boy mocks his dad by querying whether he is scared of his mom. Ilango bears the brunt of Amudha’s anger in the scene, as he too feels helpless and angry. He had expected the usual three months’ notice. The playful Siddharth sneaks in and names his game with a mask as the lion and the mouse game. The masked lion, whose fortune depends on the swings in a global economy, terrorizes the helpless mouse.\n\nThe storyline begins by contrasting a couple’s highs and lows. They do not have a steady flow of income, just like most contract workers in a global economy. Their quotidian happiness with an outing to a beach is cut short by a notice to vacate. Nonetheless, the couple’s intimacy, left mainly offscreen for us to imagine, and their togetherness as a close-knit family come through strongly. This especially happens because of the visual focus on fragmented places to stage the mise-en-scene. Filming in narrow places, informing us of the restricted rooms and hallway, let us understand that the characters encounter each other in close proximity throughout the film whatever be their mood. The places are also indicative of the spaces of hope and despair. When Ilango drinks a glass of water from the stainless-steel pot, the song that is played in the transistor-radio on the nearby stand in the narrow hallway to the kitchen gives us a glimpse into the interiority of Amudha, who is offscreen in the kitchen:\n\n“En Vaanilae Orae Vennilaa\n\nKaadhal Megangal Kavidhai Thaaragai\n\nOorvalam...\n\nThe solitary moon in my sky\n\nThe clouds of love and the poetic star\n\non a procession.\"\n\nAs the song is almost played in its entirety, across changing images that keep Amudha at the center, the editing plus the continuous song underscore how these small fragments of the place called home that we have just witnessed are the space that makes up her entire world. Within the confined space her subjectivity contains the endless sky and the moon, and the stars and the passing clouds. We realize that Amudha's heart revolves around her husband (the Hindu) Ilango, for whom she had cut off her links with her (Christian) family, and their son Siddharth, who is intelligent and creative. Even if she admonishes the little boy for drawing on the walls, she is also proud of his creativity. Indeed, later, in a scene where Ilango arrives late from work, Amudha informs him about the child’s school award and shows the certificate of merit for “Art” won by Siddharth, from his Ravindra Bharathi “Global” school.\n\nShe also says then that Siddharth had stayed awake for a long time to share his joy with his dad. The global city, thus, intrudes into their life and colors their dream, through its assurance of “giving wings to the thoughts” of Siddharth and the promise of a better future for him. Amudha also expresses her hope that Siddharth will go abroad in the future and marry a girl of his choice. In a crucial moment in the film, Amudha asks Ilango if he could go abroad, with his deserving qualifications, and work for two years so that they could buy a house and be economically secure before he follows his dreams of becoming a film director. She shares such thoughts regarding the future when she is lying on the bed near Ilango, who is sitting up and watching a film on (the offscreen) television. He gets irritated by her interruptions.\n\nAt this point, the offscreen sound reveals that the scene he watches is from Andrei Rublev (dir. Andrei Tarkovsky, 1966)âthe moment when the proper clay has been selected for building a mold for the bronze bell. It is important to note that 2007 was also the time when global art cinema in its pirated DVD versions at an affordable cost was easily available in Chennai. Earlier, at the beginning of the film, Ilango also alludes to a probable assignment which might take them abroad. But the film pits their tender dreams, almost like the bubbles inside the warmth of their sparse home, against the rough edge of the gritty and callous city. For instance, in the scene immediately after we hear the sounds from Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev, Ilango is in a sound booth, separated by a glass partition from the technicians near the sound mixer, where he is dubbing the sound for a stereotypical fight scene of the hero, the superstar from the south. It helps him bring some cash home.\n\nAbout one-third of the way in, the film again uses punctuation with darknessâthe electricity is cut when Siddharth is on Ilango’s lap watching television. In that darkness, we hear Siddharth, as usual asking his father questions: “If the television and the scooter (which we constantly use) are ours, why not this home?” This question sums up the predicament of millions of families who want to live in the concrete jungle of a metropolis like Chennai, but the city is indifferent to their plea regarding their emotional investment in a home.\n\nIn fact, when the prospective tenants barge in without any notice, just after ringing their doorbell, Ilango and Amudha stand frozen in a corner, feeling humiliated as their privacy is intruded upon, particularly when they are eating a meal. Even worse, later Amudha covers herself with her wet Paavadai (undergarment worn under the saree) after a bath and comes out casually expecting the door to be shut as usual. She is shocked (by an offscreen guest at an odd hour) and dismayed at such denying of their dignity as tenants. This happened because the landlady retains the right to the key to their house. She opens the bolts and lets in interested tenants any time of the day. Literally, one of the curious tenants opens the door to the dresser on the wall; Amudha cringes as she feels molested while a stranger is looking at her undergarments and pads that fall on the floor.\n\nNevertheless, when their repeated efforts to find an alternative accommodation fail, Amudha suggests to Ilango if they should ask the landlady whether they can continue to stay by paying a higher rent. Gradually, however, the place inside this apartment’s four walls also becomes a space filled with anxieties of displacement and despair; one door after the other keeps closing in on them, on one pretext or another. Their encounters outside occur in a world literally on the move, where construction abounds and \"To Let\" signboards are aplenty. That space is juxtaposed against the intensifying inner turmoil that Ilango and Amudha feel and the increasing claustrophobia within their home. Consider, for instance, the penultimate scene, the night before they have to leave, the night of May 3rd. A long take shot with a wide-angle lens frames the uneasy and much worried Amudha, who is unable to control her emotions as she is weeping and Ilango is sitting by her side consoling her, while Siddharth is sleeping on the floor resting his head on a pillow in the adjacent room.\n\nThis profound static shot of the family captures the emotions that stand in contrast to the many cuts of fragmented places inside their home in the beginning which were full of the many colors of their vibrant emotions, joy and grief, anxiety and anger, and desires and dreams. As they fail to successfully negotiate getting another accommodation proclaiming \"To (be) Let,\" the signboard \"To Let\" outside their own home on the gate also speaks to the conditions more generally for contract workers. Ilango has had sparse takers for his creative talents. In fact, he could get the attention of and pitch his story only to one solitary producer (Marudhu Mohan), despite his desire \"To Let\" his services as a writer/director in the big city of Chennai and its colossal film industry.\n\nTo Let and place\n\n“Global totality cannot be thought without reckoning the local specificity. In other words, place in its specific concreteness, does not act as a hurdle to abstract and generalizing thought but instead is the means through which such thought is able to articulate and materialize itself. This is the inversion of the bumper sticker’s imperative to ‘think globally; act locally’; rather to think locally, [Fredric] Jameson suggests, is to make way for the possibility of acting (and, of course, continuing to think) globally.”[25]\n\nTo Let is anchored locally through its focus on place, which is but one specific aspect of space, in its critique of the globalizing metropolis, Chennai. This is represented in the script not only through the aspirations of Ilango and Amudha for a better future for Siddharth through the \"Global\" school where he studies, but also by the script which a producer of an advertisement (Marudhu Mohan) asks Ilango to writeâa video advertising maa vadu/tender-mango pickle. The producer tells him about facing competition from three other pickle firms. In fact, demand for pickles, particularly from Chennai, has increased over the last decade, mainly due to exports that cater to the large population of non-resident Indians in the West, most of whom work in the information technology sector. To Let addresses through local produceâthe tender-mango pickle and its rising global demandâ something which is directly proportional to the scarcity of rented places in Chennai due to the rapid expansion of the IT sector. Thus, the film could be argued to \"think locally and act globally,\" not just in terms of its narrative but regarding the objects foregrounded by the film.\n\nReflexively, the tender-pickle seems to be an allegory for the film itself. Chezhiyan's To Let, as an art film with an unhurried pace, does not pretend to be a \"different\" film within the mainstream. It is entirely different in its approach and aesthetics. These conscious choices also mark To Let as a film made for the festival circuit and an international audience, along with an appeal to the multiplex audiences in India who may have preferences for cinema which disavows stereotypes and explores new styles and themes, expanding how film can narrate hitherto untold stories in a fresh language. Here the transnational objective of To Let is predicated on a local theme/subject at the same time that the difficulty of finding accommodation is universal, particularly for a struggling filmmaker with an unstable income. In this aspect, the script implicitly invokes Nimai Ghosh and his efforts to unionize film workers in Tamilnadu and recalls the theme of Ghosh's pathbreaking film Pathai Theriyuthu Paar (Look at the New Path!), based on the subject of workers organizing themselves. But the fact that Ilango eats nonvegetarian food, a signifier of not belonging to the upper caste, means he’s denied accommodation, and this fact is specific to the local culture and its prejudices related to religion and caste. By anchoring the agony of its protagonists to place, To Let seems to reaffirm the significance of this specific place in the lives of its rather ordinary protagonists; their life exemplifies the lived reality of most middle-class people in India, where identities like caste and religion are visual signifiers used to keep vulnerable people segregated and at a distance.\n\nWhile the notion of the “nonplace,” as explored by the French anthropologist Marc AugÃ©, and as exemplified internationally by ubiquitous malls, multiplexes and airports,[26] has impinged upon life in Chennai, particularly in the new millennium, it has not impacted the lives of people like Ilango who still lead a hand-to-mouth existence. To Let, therefore, in emphasizing the plight of a family on the fringes of the middle-class, draws attention to place both to reveal this sector’s identity and their hopes and despair. The initial search of Ilango for an accommodation is framed by a fluid subjective shot, through a handheld camera, of the rooms inside the apartment he’s looking at, where the camera moves along with Ilango through a dimly-lit narrow hallway into the apartment on the left and continues to pan onto a gloomy living room with a window and goes towards a kitchen revealing the sink with the vessels to be washed.\n\nOn the soundtrack, during the above long take, we hear a woman's authoritative voice telling matter-of-factly the cost for rent (4000 Rupees rent and 40000 advance) and other cumulative details (maintenance 500 and electricity 6 Rupees per unit). She also says that she will charge 300 Rupees extra for Kolam, the traditional rice flour-drawing in front of the house around a grid pattern of dots which is considered auspicious in Tamil/most Indian culture. She also warns that rent may go up after eleven months when the contract has to be renewed. And then she says that there will be only one hour in the evening when water will be available to collect and store; that’s when she puts on the motor.\n\nIn the following shot, the owner of the voice/place is revealedâthe tough landlady, Ramuthai. As we see her in the frame with Ilango and the broker, she cautions against using nails on the walls and playing the TV at a loud volume. As she says this, her cell phone rings with a loud dial tone of a song on Mariaththa/Goddess Mari. The sequence is thus framed in the beginning by showing the calendars of gods and goddesses outside on a wall near a temple, where the real estate broker joined Ilango on his moped; and it is bookended by the sound of the religious song at the end. The name Ramuthai and her preference for the goddess Mariamman and her language marks her as someone from the lower rung of the caste hierarchy, yet she is revealed to be pragmatic and not concerned with the plight of a fellow human being; she’s overwhelmed by the opiate of religion, her insulation against any guilt about exploitation.\n\nThe protagonist’s subsequent search for a place to rent is framed by a fluid POV shot as well. This time we see the old broker under a tree with a To Let signboard leading Ilango to the spot through an alley, where we see a woman pumping water from a borewell. Thereafter, the camera moves through a narrow staircase to reveal a young girl who is watering a plant in a vase on the sidewall above. The continuously moving subjective camera opens onto a terrace where boys sitting on steps are reading their lessons about Tenali Raman, the 16th-century poet known for his wit and wisdom in his critique of a self-centered society and its avariciousness.\n\nThen we hear the sound of an offscreen man as he reads news about the successful recruitment for training in Vedas, the Hindu scriptures. As the moving camera pans right, we see a young woman arranging clothes to dry on a cord, and a man across her sitting at the entrance to his home reading from a newspaper about Sunita Williams and her participation in the Boston Marathon from a treadmill in the space station orbiting the earth. The moving camera pans and moves left to reveal a narrow room enclosed by walls, and the scene ends with off-screen dialogue: When Ilango expresses his shock at and disapproval of the common toilet, the broker tells him, \"That's what you can expect for the money you're willing to pay.\"\n\nThe dimly-lit, restricted spaces and narrow staircase in both these subjective scenes from Ilango’s point of view emphasize place, sending the message that you can’t escape these constraints without money in a big city. These subjective shots, in fact, offer an objective look at the houses Ilango could afford to rent. The realistic images imply that this is the reality of the vast majority of people whose lives have not been touched by the affluence or upward mobility, promised by globalization, and ironically by the advertisement industry Ilango works for. The smooth handheld camera work reflexively draws our attention not only to the anxious tenant Ilango who is looking for a place to move, but also to the aspiring filmmaker in him. He too could design such a shot in this digital era where steady camera movement is easily possible through affordable equipment like the Gimbal. In terms of film history, instead of a subjective shot mainly offering insight into the interiority of a character, here it contributes to an assemblage of observational shots, recalling the aesthetics of Neorealismâfor instance, the famous long take at the vast thieves' market in Bicycle Thieves.\n\nMoreover, the subjective shots in To Let do not privilege Ilango as the viewer but, through editing, directly reveal physical circumstances to us as an audience. The usual trajectory of a moving subjective shot is to immediately open up the space inside and draw us into the interiority of the character, here Ilango. But the editing here disavows that by the sharp ending of the sequence with the stern landlady and the constricting image of the folding toilet walls, due to the wide-angle lens. The visuals thus layer subjectivity to punctuate the ever-widening gap between the characters’ dreams and the hardcore reality surrounding people like them in this “ever-shrinking global” world. Rather than emphasize the inner world of Ilango and the environment’s effect on his psyche, these long-held shots reflexively draw attention to the effect such a disorienting glimpse of a claustrophobic apartment on lease would have on any prospective tenant. In this way, the emphasis on fragments of place, either empty or occupied by people who do not react to the moving camera, enables the cinematographer to frame a specific place for its universal resonance. According to film scholars Rhodes and Gorfinkel,\n\n“Our experience of moving in and out of a moving image’s emplaced geographic particularity and our ability through the image, to know places we can/not ever know grant us a model for an engagement with the world, which is both a world and worlds. The moving image offers us a means of placing ourselves in others’ places, not to annihilate their specificity or ours, or the specificity of these places, but rather so that we find a way of finding in the world’s manifold particularity a universality worth sharing-everywhere.”[27]\n\nHere, cinema’s emplaced geographic particularity also recalls and resonates with the lopsided urban development common in most countries of the Global South. The shots of residential urban locale delineate an outcome of the postcolonial world’s struggles to come to terms with the neo-colonization; a city like Chennai simultaneously profits and suffers from global outsourcing and consequent local exploitation by means of sweatshops. The juxtaposition of the moving camera and the fixity of a tangible place showcase the characters’ dreaming in a vacuum and disregarding grounded realities in aspiring for a world/place elsewhere.Â Â Â\n\nThereafter, as Ilango is forced to rapidly search for a place due to the approaching deadline, Amudha and Siddharth join him. At one point, when Ilango's moped reaches a spot where they see a To Let sign on the gate, Siddharth is happy. But as they expectantly approach the entrance, an old man stands there in his traditional attire of the veshti/a rectangular piece of white cloth worn around the waist, and poonool/a sacred thread across his chest, and a namam/a flame-like mark on his forehead, with his wife behind him in the panchakacham/five-yards saree; these clothes bespeak their religion (Vaishnava Hindu) and caste (Brahmin). The man comes out and asks: “Are you vegetarian?” The scene ends with a silent and defeated Ilango and Amudha returning to their moped with Siddharth.\n\nIt is worth looking closely at this sequence’s visual development. It begins with Ilango, Amudha and Siddharth on a moped behind a tracking camera in front of them, followed by a subjective shot in a wider frame of a spacious locality, a rarity because of the narrow-hallways and claustrophobic-rooms we have seen in To Let; looking from the side of Ilango's moped, a relatively wealthier place with houses surrounded by compound walls is established as the neighborhood. As the moped comes to a halt, Ilango sees the signboard \"To Let,\" and this spontaneously leads him to inquire of the old owner, who is coming out of his home, the status of the accommodation. But the old man's counter question crushes Ilango and Amudha's hopes. We learn in this way that Ilango and his family are nonvegetarians and so are rejected by the vegetarian upper-caste Brahmin, whose attire loudly asserts his exclusivity/supremacy.\n\nThus, the brief moment of relief through seeing a wider frame and the relatively spacious houses comes to a halt when literally Ilango is shown his place and alerted to the grim reality of his being an outsider in that place. The roomy place with a compound wall now becomes, as we see the old man framed between the gate and the main door to his house, a source of discrimination. Here too there is \"emplaced geographic particularity\" and caste specificityâof both the old man inside his compound wall and Ilango, Amudha, and Siddharth on the street outside. But this sequence, with all its local specificity, then has a resonance with the universality of color and race segregation; within the film, it recalls an earlier scene where the old broker apprehensively asks if Ilango is a Muslim.\n\nSuch discrimination where religion and caste intersect extends to a subsequent scene where the Hindu landlord is from the Saiva Vellalar caste. Here the setting is a living room. The landlord wears vibhuthi/the religious marking of white ash on his forehead, and we see a calendar on the adjacent wall with an image of V.O. Chidambaram Pillai, a rebel against the British now appropriated as an icon for Pillai’s caste followers. These visual indicators clearly show that the landlord is upper caste but not a Brahmin. His tone is suspicious and unfriendly from the beginning as he cynically asks: “Do you pray?” He further says admonishingly: “Do not wear the black shirt.” By that, he is referring to the black shirt as the emblem of the spirit of the rationality of Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, an iconic social reformer who rebelled against blind faith and religion and the caste system and its oppression. Further, when the conservative landlord arrogantly interrogates his prospective and silent/ humiliated tenant and expresses his disgust at his working in the film industry, the compassionate Selva (T. Arul Ezhilan) who had arranged the meeting comes to the rescue of his friend and tries to salvage the situation by saying that Ilango is a creative author who writes scripts. Later when the landlord directly asks about Ilango's caste, Selva lies by saying he is from the (vegetarian) Saiva Vellala caste.\n\nNonetheless, the landlord seems to be cold and indifferent as he asks them to have a look at the house on the adjacent street. Next day when Ilango and his friend meet him to pay the advance, the opportunistic landlord tells them that he has taken an advance from an IT guyâmeaning someone who has a more stable and higher income. In this scene, though the apartment is spacious, it is hostile and antagonistic. Despite the well-lit atmosphere, a gloom pervades it from the beginning due to the malicious nature of the upper-caste landlord who seems to hate Ilango and makes him feel unwelcome. Despite the spacious and well-furnished living room, it's a place where Ilango feels disrespected and confined due to his social and economic disadvantage. The oppressed Ilango’s state of mind, which is seething with anger, is punctuated by images at key moments in the film; for instance, Ilango watches a house being demolished when he is on his moped on the road after a quarrel with Amudha at home.\n\nThe focus on place in To Let, through Ilango’s searches, thus travels the range of castes as well; the initial landlady seems to be from a relatively lower caste whereas the last two are from the top of the hierarchy. But Ilango’s caste combined with his class or weak economic power makes him an “undesirable” candidate to find an accommodation in Chennai, where multiple layers of discrimination always shape social interaction in any given place at every instance.Â\n\nTo Let and space\n\nThe last segment of the film focuses both on place and on Ilango’s interiority as the approaching deadline to vacate does not give him any reprieve. The characters are juxtaposed against various places to evoke their interiority. For example, almost halfway through the film, around the 44th minute, Ilango participates in making an ad for cherry tomatoes. As a shot is being set up, the director of that ad film (Mani) has a chat with Ilango. When Ilango tells him about the difficulty of getting an apartment due to his working in the film industry, the director points out the hypocrisy. He says that Tamilians could trust the film industry people for fifty years to govern their state but cannot trust them for a (paltry) monthly rent.[28]\n\nLater, the director flashes a visiting card that reads “M. Sivakumar, Sys Analyst, Orchid Computers,” and tells Ilango how in his case his cousin, who owns the company, helped him out. He justifies his deception of posing as a computer professional that he used to rent an apartment by saying, “after all we’re going to pay the same rent” as others. He gives the card to Ilango, since “only the name will be changed” on the card. This moment in the film was prefigured by an earlier sequence, when after returning from the old Brahmin’s house, Ilango and Amudha are taken aback by the “To Let” signboard on their own gate. The innocent Siddharth is full of smiles and goes near the sign and loudly spells it out before going in. The next shot is that of a scene from Bresson’s Pickpocket (1959) on the television screen, where we see the protagonist approaching a crowd. Over the ringing of the doorbell, the film is paused on the television screen.\n\nIn that sequence, when we see the signboard on the gate at their home, our attention is not on the place, which we are familiar with, but with the mindset of Ilango and Amudha. The rental sign presages the increasing turmoil they are going to endure due to the approaching deadline and the revelation of the fact that their home is now available for any taker. This anxious feeling about the deadline stands in contrast to the more leisurely-paced subjective shot of the apartments for rent, where we could get a glimpse of the unaccommodating society at large.\n\nLater, Siddharth adds “To Let” to the painting of his home. Earlier, the painting was crushed by the haughty landlady when she took Amudha (and Siddharth) to task for the dirty walls and pulled the painting down and threw it away. Now, it was straightened by Ilango when he was ironing his clothes. The home drawn by pencils and crayons serves as a metaphor for the family’s togetherness and resilience despite the odds. Siddharth’s paintings also provide a space into a child’s mind as it is full of playfulness and eagerness to learn new letters but also gets affected by the atmosphere around.\n\nIn his school he struggles to answer the question, “What’s your father?” With his family, as they leave the house the last time, Siddharth points to his painting of the plant, which now has a big flower, on the wall. Looking at it, Ilango smiles. Siddharth’s paintings provide a space for us to understand the child’s cheerful and meditative mind, which is always in the present. His subjectivity stands in contrast to that of his parents, who have been forced to dwell on the future with the sudden notice to vacate.\n\nIn a similar vein, the final segment of the film is also underscored by an image that parallels Ilango and Amudha’s predicament. Between two skyscrapers, we see Siddharth standing with his mom and dad and letting go of his balloon. As the balloon ascends towards the blue sky between the tall buildings, even as it offers a beautiful image, it also emphasizes loss for Siddharth. The very next shot is that of Ilango, Amudha, and Siddharth crossing the road amidst goats and traffic to reach the North Indian Shantilal’s new house under construction. Shantilal and his wife are warm and welcoming, and the interior is well lit, and the kitchen is laid with granite and the walls with marble, and Amudha is happy with the house. It is a brief moment of hope.\n\nBut the cautious owner postpones taking the advance, as he wants to discuss this rental with his wife. Later, when Ilango meets him in his office, Shantilal asks him for 500 over the 6000 Rupees as rent; a reluctant Ilango agrees and pays him a token advance. He also asks for Ilango’s ID and Employment Proofs, and Ilango gives a copy of his ration card and the visiting card. Unlike with the earlier encounter with landlords, none of the scenes in this sequence are staged at Shantilal’s home. Subjectively, the space inside his potential new apartment seduces Ilango and Amudha and us. The cautious Shantilal, who is a recent migrant to Chennai city, is picky and wants to check the veracity of Ilango’s current tenancy. Since Ilango and Amudha are busy planning to leave and packing their goods, they are relieved when Shantilal says he is not able to make it to their residence.\n\nThus, when everything seems to go well, Ilango’s lie backfires and comes to haunt him. The night before their departure, since everything is packed, Ilango buys food at a roadside kiosk and is returning when his cellphone rings. We come to know from the conversation interrupted by the traffic that Shantilal wants to verify the employment of Ilango from the (fake) visiting card that he has given, as Ilango is telling him the phone number on the card. The tense Ilango immediately calls the ad film director so as to alert his cousin regarding the situation; the director asks him to call him later as he is in a screening.\n\nThe above sequence takes place on a busy city road with heavy traffic at night, with Ilango and his parked moped in the foreground. The locale and composition create a visual space that encourages reflection on his uneasiness and portends the impending loss of the promised place. Smoke pervades the scene and cars pass perilously close by under yellowish sodium lamps, their color adding to the grimness of the situation. Traffic noise interferes with Ilango’s phone conversation, and his tone becomes increasingly anxious due to the decreasing amount of money on the sim-card in his cellphone. This scene points to the finale since we can guess the consequences of Shantilal’s verification. Here the director uses the space of the big city at night as a canvas to paint its blues in regard to the people living on its fringes. Finally, To Let ends with the reversal of its very first shot: The camera is inside the living room hall, and we see Amudha going out, leaving after Ilango and Siddharth on the morning of May 4th. It recalls the ending of Manusangada wherein a disconsolate Kolappan falls down on the ground, seeking solace, in contrast to the beginning when he is peacefully sleeping at night. In the concluding shot, Amudha shuts the door and locks it from outside, and the screen goes dark. To Let suggests through Ilango’s earlier dialogue that they might leave the city. Or their search for a new house may continue.\n\nInterestingly, the road thus becomes a signifier of exclusion in both the films. In To Let, it is a marker of the in-between space where Ilango, Amudha and their son Siddhu are finally displaced to when expelled from their home and from where they keep searching for a shelter throughout the film, but in vain. In Manusangada, the road signifies a stage where the unlawful and forcible exclusion of people, oppressed through caste, is played out with the connivance of the state. In a way, both the films engage with the idea of space and exclusion. If To Let revolves around the theme of dwelling, Manusangada focuses on the subject of resting in peace. Both themes are about universal quotidian desires, but in each case, the space to enact those desires is denied. If Ilango’s unstable income as a film worker or his class is the dominant reason for exclusion in To Let, the ubiquitous and venomous prejudice surrounding caste becomes the cause of Kollappan’s poignant situation in Manusangada. Ilango and Kolappan and their families bitterly signify “matter out of place,” as they face a consistent effort to keep them out.\n\nIn this light, drawing from Mary Douglas’s classical definition of dirt,[29] Mark Cousins rearticulates the revolutionary potential inherent in dirt,[30] particularly for the purposes of my essay, in the context of Kolappan’s perseverance and persistence in claiming his rights to carry the bier through the official road and bury his father’s body despite the attempts of the upper-caste people and the police to block/prohibit it:\n\n“â¦ in so far as dirt is matter out of place it must have passed a boundary, limit or threshold into a space where it should not be. The dirt is an ugly deduction from ‘good’ space, not simply by virtue of occupying the space, but by threatening to contaminate all the good space around it. In this light, ‘dirt’, the ugly object, has a spatial power quite lacking in the beautiful object” (p. 63).”[31]\n\nHowever, the Dalit corpse and cortege represent a threatening intrusion and the beautifully decked object on the bier has a spatial power that is offensive to those with more power. Thus it is contained by the police as they snatch the body away and arrest Kolappan and his friends and relatives. Julia Kristeva’s ideas on dirt also apply to the abject figure of the corpse in Manusangada,[32] which lies in a poor neighborhood adjacent to upper-caste houses. She furthers our understanding of such contiguity when her idea of abjection is expanded to consider spaces:\n\n“The abject, in contrast with interpretations of Douglas that polarise the binary between ‘dirty’ and ‘clean’, leaves more room for the ideas that â¦ one might desire to see and experience abject spaces; that the marginalised may exist next to the mainstream, the excluded next to the included, and that degeneration might be produced within processes of regeneration. Abject urban [as well as rapidly transforming rural] spaces necessitate such an interpretation in accounting for interactions between notions of material, spatial, psychological, and social degradation and systems for imposing, or attempting to achieve, purity. Responses to stigmatised public spacesâincluding obsessive surveillance, the patrol of boundariesâparallel the process of abjection on a collective scale.”[33]\n\nTo conclude, I would like to call attention to another vital space for such significant films as Manusangada and To Letâthat of international film festivals. I have noted how the films fill a historical lack/void in Tamil cinema in terms of their innovative style, politically astute subject matter, and uncompromising stance on creating a film language that is historically informed yet unique to Tamil cinema. Both these films have done exceptionally well in the festival circuit and have won many awards. Manusangada was screened at the prestigious Cairo International Film Festival and in the highly competitive Mumbai Film Festival, besides being an official selection in the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India. Similarly, To Let too has traveled far and wide in the festival circuit from Armenia to Spain. It won the best picture award at the Kolkata International Film Festival and the Best Film in Tamil in the prestigious national awards. Nonetheless, both these films are yet to be released in the theaters in Tamilnadu. Because of media coverage and critical acclaim following their success in the festival circuit, Amshan Kumar and Chezhiyan are optimistic about the theatrical release of their films at home.\n\nWhile digital technology has enabled the productions of quality films, digital distribution and exhibition are still monopolized, as before. A few men/groups/corporations control the fate of films in reaching an audience; the rich own/lease the real estateâthe theatrical spaces. The rise of multiplexes has led to an increase in a discerning audience for art films, but at the same time, even highly deserving films made with modest budgets must make way for the films with big stars and transnational blockbusters. In such a situation, if Tamil cinema will see a renaissance in this digital age, it will need the patronage of discerning young viewers who go to cinemas in these times of live streaming and web uploads. I am hopeful that Manusangada and To Let can keep such an audience engaged.\n\nNotes\n\nAcknowledgments: I am grateful to directors Amshan Kumar and Ra. Chezhiyan for their time and Profs.
