        "text": "Hyderabad historian V K Bawa passes away\n\nTNN / Jan 10, 2023, 04:56 (IST)\n\nIn a great loss to the heritage community in the city, Dr VK Bawa, the founding vice-chairperson of Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (HUDA), now HMDA, passed away on Monday at the age of 93 in Hyderabad.\n\nHyderabad: Lac bangles jingle on pearl strings, jatras and urs blend\n\nTNN / Nov 23, 2022, 13:53 (IST)\n\nAhmedabad and Jaipur secured the world heritage city status not just on the strength of their ancient monuments. The intangible or cultural heritage of the cities too aided them in bagging Unesco’s coveted tag. Hyderabad also has a rich history of such elements.​\n\nReviving a slice of history in hi-tech Hyderabad\n\nTNN / Dec 26, 2022, 19:03 (IST)\n\nSurrounded by modern homes on three sides, the over five centuries old Shaikpet Sarai feels like a slice of history sitting at the centre of ‘hi-tech’ Hyderabad. Though the burden of age and neglect is evident on its exteriors, the intricate architecture and carvings on its walls, arches and columns are more than fascinating. So is the story behind the Sarai — an inn or resting place for travellers, in Arabic. Heritage experts say people who came to meet the Qutub Shahi rulers, lodged in the Golconda Fort, first checked in here for security clearance.\n\nHyderabad: ‘Lion’ of villains Ajit’s birth centenary today\n\nTNN / Jan 27, 2022, 03:49 (IST)\n\nFilm buffs and city heritage activists are all set to mark the birth centenary of legendary Bollywood villain Ajit on Thursday. Hamid Ali Khan, better known by his screen name Ajit, was born on January 27, 1922, in Golconda in Hyderabad.\n\nWhen Musi rose in fury: 111 years later, history serves as a reminder\n\nTNN / Sep 29, 2019, 04:35 (IST)\n\nOver the past few days, Hyderabad, including various parts of Old City, was lashed by rain, causing immense inconvenience to citizens. The impact of the rain was reminiscent of the monsoon fury that rocked the city 111 years ago, on September 28, 1908, during the great floods of Musi. Thousands of people were killed, over 80,000 houses damaged, and many others left homeless.\n\nMany trees have potential for translocation, says World Wide Fund for nature director\n\nTNN / Apr 20, 2016, 00:36 (IST)\n\nCivil society representatives who are part of the tree protection committee on Tuesday began an inspection of the city's green belts proposed to be razed to make way for the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP).\n\nAfghan actor's question to panellists goes unanswered\n\nTNN / Nov 16, 2013, 02:02 (IST)\n\nAn Afghan actor's pointed question on why there was not a single child actor among the panellists who were discussing rights of child artistes at the 18th International Children's Film Festival on Friday left the organisers red-faced."
