        "text": "When Puri Jagannadh announced a new film with Ravi Teja, they said, \"What? Yet another film?\" When they were told that the title is Devudu Chesina Manushulu, it kind of triggered speculation. The film is, in fact, a new story.\n\nThe film was extensively shot in Bangkok, where Ravi Teja, Illeana and Prakash Raj participated. Producer BVSN Prasad says that DCM will, like the other films in the combination of the director and the hero, belong to that category of films which will be remembered for long.\n\nDCM will begin with this message: Watch this film only if you believe that god exists for real. Saying this PJ added that the film is a cent per cent entertainer. The God, who shares a relationship with the principal characters, happens to be Lord Balaji, going by the logo. Prakash Raj is playing an important role here. Brahmanandam, Ali, MS and Kovai Sarala have comedy roles. Subbu Raju has a key role. Raghu Kunche is the music director. Photography is by Shyam K Naidu. Presented by Reliance Entertainment.\n\nAfter Itlu Sravani Subramanyam, Idiot, Amma Nanna O Tamila Ammayi, Neninthe, will the combo work wonders?"
