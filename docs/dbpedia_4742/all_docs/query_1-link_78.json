        "text": "Ghattamaneni Siva Rama Krishna (Telugu: ఘట్టమనేని శివరామ కృష్ణ) (born on the 31 May 1943), commonly referred to as Super Star Krishna, is one of Tollywood's most prolific actors. He is one of his kind of actor. A prolific risk taker, his derring-dos have played an instrumental role in enabling the Telugu film industry take a giant leap forward.\n\nHaving acted in more than 350 movies, He is credited with introducing many firsts in Telugu film Industry like first Colour movie (Tene Manasulu(1965)), first Cinemascope movie ( Alluri Seetharama Raju ), first 70mm movie(Simhasanam), first DTS Movie(Telugu Veera Levara). He is very experimental and the first ever hero to introduce cowboy and James bond style to Telugu screen. In addition to acting he also directed 17 feature films and produced many films under his Padmalaya Film Studio banner. He was also elected as a Member of Parliament from Eluru under Congress Party. In 2009, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his contributions towards Indian Cinema.\n\nEarly life\n\nKrishna was born on May 31, 1943 to Ghattamaneni Veeraraghavayya Chowdhary and Ghattamaneni Nagaratnamma in a remote village called Burripallem, near Tenali in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, India. He was the eldest of the five children from a middle income agrarian family. He could not afford to have convent education, so he attended the school in his village to get his primary education before moving to Tenali and Narsapur to do his S.S.C and Intermediate. Impressed by his scholastic achievements, his father raised money to send his son to the prestigious C.R.R. college in Eluru to finish degree in BSc. There, he shared a room with two aspiring actors, Sobhan Babu and Murali Mohan, who later became stars in their own right. Krishna played an active role in various cultural events organized by his college. His performance in the play \"Cheesina Paapam Kaasiki Velleena\" brought him critical acclaim, thus encouraging him to pursue acting more seriously.\n\nFilm Career\n\n1962-1977\n\nAfter graduating in Science from C.R.Reddy College in Eluru. Offers did not come his way easily and he had to be content with playing insignificant roles in films like Padandi Mundhuku,Kulagothralu and Paruvu Prathishta. It was during these unsettling times that he bumped into an advertisement, which mentioned that Babu Movies was scouting profiles for their next film Tenemanasulu. Like several wannabe actors of his time, Krishna quickly responded to the advertisement and got selected to play one of the male leads amidst tight competition. Half way through the film Adurthi Subba Rao, the film director was subject to lot of pressure by its distributors (Navayuga) to drop Krishna from the film. But Adurthi persisted with his choice and released the film as planned. Its phenomenal success helped Krishna trespass the archetypal show-biz struggle as Adurthi repeated the cast for his next film Kannemanasulu. Krishna was also selected to play the lead role in Sunderlal Nehta and Doondee's Gudachaari 116 during this time. Though Kannemanasulu failed at the box-office, the unexpected success of this action flick established Krishna in the industry and he was often chosen to play the lead role in what came to be known as crime pictures in cinema patois. Krishna grabbed every opportunity that came his way and several hits followed in the next few years. Though action films were his forte, Krishna also delivered in soft films like Marapurani Katha, Atthagaaru Kotthakodalu, and Undamma Bottu Pedathaa. The upcoming actor also got a chance to work with more established actors like N.T.R. and A.N.R. in films like Sthree Janma, Niluvu Dopidi, Vichithra Kutumbam, Akka Chellellu and Manchi Kutumbam during this period. Success did not get into his head and Krishna consciously chose not to increase his remuneration even after becoming one of the minimum guaranteed stars in the industry. Most producers, who made films with Krishna, repeated him in their next projects regardless of how their earlier films fared. Some became so endeared with his consummate professionalism that they even tried pitting him against actors higher up in the echelon (Retired action hero Kantha Rao recently confessed this in his bio-graphy) . But Krishna had no time for these behind the scene endeavors as he was super busy acting in multiple shifts round the years.\n\nKrishna also set up his flag-ship production house Padmalaya films and produced several high budget films like Mosagallaki Mosagaadu, Pandanti Kapuram, Devudu Cheesina Manushulu and Alluri Seetharama Raju after a low profile maiden home production Agnipariksha. Huge casting was a standard feature in all these films and the production standards of these movies were far ahead of their times. With in a very short period, Padmalaya was recognized as a leading production house and its films were the biggest hits of the calendar years 1972, 1973 and 1974. Krishna also set up another production house VijayaKrishna movies with his soul-mate Vijaya Nirmala and produced some critically acclaimed films like Meena, Devadasu on it.\n\nIn spite of producing such high profile movies, Krishna continued working for producers with moderate budgets. With these tight budgets, the film-makers sometimes could not provide the padding that is often required for a film's commercial success and hence some of Krishna's films released in 1971, 1972 and 1973 bit the dust. Though these failures reduced his success rate in early seventies, the years 1974 and 1975 can be considered as the real quiet period in his professional life. Except Cheekati Velugulu, none of his films released in these years made any impact at the box-office as people were reluctant to watch Krishna in softer roles after his riveting portrayal of Alluri Seethaa Rama Raju in the eponymous film. Krishna was also seriously taken aback with the box-office failure of his labor of love Devadasu, which was released in 1974. The year also saw Krishna straining his relationship with N.T.R. and A.N.R as they were against the idea of Krishna making Alluri Seetharama Raju and Devadasu respectively. Critics started questioning his box-office salability and most of them even predicted his career to end soon.\n\n1978-1989\n\nKrishna showed great resolve during these testing times and with supreme self-belief, he released his lavishly made home production Paadi Pantalu for Sankranthi 1976. The film, which dealt with several agrarian issues of its time, was a run away hit at the box-office. Krishna was also equally appreciated for his performance in Raja Rajeswari Coffee Vilas Club, his second film in the famous Vijaya banner. Krishna also produced and released another movie called Rama Rajyamloo Raktha Paasam in 1976. This is another instance where Krishna showcased his ability to ably deal with exigencies when he changed the film's title and supplied new publicity material overnight to all regions when censor officials refused to certify the film unless they did so. The officials, apparently, opined that the original title Rama Rajyamloo Raktha Paatham; was too provocative and a dig on the prevailing socio-political unrest. Krishna did two roles in this average farer, which revolves around how two siblings unite their estranged parents. Kolleti Kapuram,Bhalee Dongalu and Devudee Gelichaadu are other films in which he acted in 1976. While K.B. Thilak's Kolleti Kapuram was critically acclaimed for its thought provoking dialogues and for capturing the serenity of Lake Kolleru in West Godavari District, Bhalee Dongalu, a re-make of the Hindi film Chor Machaayee Shoor, hit the bull's eye. But Devudee Gelichaadu left a sour pill in Krishna's mouth that year. Krishna became a top newsmaker again in the same year when he announced Kurukshethram as his next home production. This surprised N.T.R. the most as he also wanted to make a movie Daana Veera Sura Karna based on the epic. The relationship between the two strained further when Krishna expressed his inability to drop his project and both started producing their films at frenetic pace. While Daana Veera Soora Karna was made with a limited budget and featured N.T.R. in all the keyroles, Kurukshethram was made on a larger canvass with a huge casting ensemble. Though Daana Veera Sura Karna had an emphatic victory over its rival during Sankranthi season in 1977, Kurukshethram proved Krishna bravado once again. His good run at the box-office continued with Saavaasagallu and the actor further penetrated into the urban mass segment with the super-hit film Dongalaku Donga.\n\nKrishna's career reached greater heights between the years 1978 and 1986. During this period, Krishna acted in several hit movies, increased his fan-following manifold, maintained an edge over his junior rivals and made his seniors run for their money. More importantly, Krishna's stature also increased a lot due his philanthropy. In 1978, Krishna acted in hit films like Anna Dammula Sawaal, Kumara Raja and Agent Gopi and other commercially successful films like Indradanassu and Allari Bulloodu. The craze for him was so great that some of his flop films like Mugguroo Mugguree created records before petering out at the box-office. Six of his films fared very well in 1979. While Viyyalavaari Kayyaalu, Mandeegundelu, Hema-Heemeelu and Kottha Alludu set the cash registers ringing, Burripalem Bulloodu was another commercially successful film in Krishna's repertoire. Krishna and Sridevi became a hit-pair in 1980 and the two acted together in Gharana Donga, Maama Allulla Sawaal, Chuttaalunnaaru Jagrattha, and Ram Robert Rahim. Krishna also scored big against all his competitors when his Ooriki Monagaadu became the biggest hit among all films released during Sankranthi in 1981. This film is a watershed event in his life as it increased his craze and fan following in several remote areas too. Krishna was also the most consistent hero in 1981 as almost all his films performed well at the box-office. 1982 was another eventful year in his life and he started it with the super-hit film Bangaaru Bhoomi, which was an improvisation of his Paadipantalu. Towards the end of the year, Krishna became the fastest to complete 200 films in a lead role. He also became a studio owner and produced Eeenaadu as it's maiden venture. This film was another feather in his cap and the satirical film acted as a catalyst in bringing a regime change in AP. A string of super successful films like Mundhadugu, Kiraayi Kotigaadu, Adavi Simhaalu,Sakthi and Prajaarajyam catapulted him to the top position in 1983. Krishna's reign at the box-office continued in 1984 with films like Iddharu Dongalu, Bangaaru Kaapuram, Mukyamanthri and the lavishly made Kanchukaagada. This high profile movie opened splendidly and illustrated Krishna's box-office prowess by collecting Eighty Two Lakh Rupees in its first week. The Superstar ended the year on a high note with his last film for the year Dongalu Baabooy Dongalu, running for 100 days run in a single theater in Vijayawada.\n\nKrishna's career was at its pinnacle in 1985. The Superstar acted in swash buckling hits like Agniparvatham, Palnati Simham, Vajrayudham in this year. Krishna's fantastic portrayal of the larger than life characters created by the writer duo Paruchuri Brothers helped these films have spectacular runs at the box-office. In fact, his performances in these roles were so graceful and his histrionics so natural that fans across the state either started or re-named some of their associations/fan clubs on the characters names. He also acted in other hit films Suryachandra,Pacchani Kapuram and Mahasangramam with his peer Sobhan Babu. Krishna started 1986 on a low key as audience turned down both his early releases Krishnagaaradi and Brahmasthram. But he bounced bank with his maiden directorial venture Simhaasanam. Made with a budget of about four crore rupees in two languages and released on a grand-scale in more than 150 theaters in A.P. alone, Simhaasanam collected One and half crore rupees in its first week and completed its direct hundred days run in six major cities in the state.\n\nKhaidhi Rudrayya was another smash musical hit in his career and the film created several records at the box-office. The Superstar continued his slugfest against his political beliefs by satirizing some of the policies of Telugu Desam Party in his home production Naa Pilupee Prabhanjanam. Disgruntled supporters and leaders of this regional Party protested against screening of this film in several places. But their ruckuses, ironically, generated more publicity for it and helped the film succeed. Though Krishna starred in the record breaking Muddayi, and in other hits like Dongodocchaadu and Thandri Kodukula Challenge, 1987 was, by and large, a disappointing year in his career as some of his highly expected movies like Sardar Krishnama Naidu, Viswanatha Nayakudu, Maa Voori Magaadu and Makutamleeni Mahaaraaju fared dismally. Despite these professional setbacks, Krishna would still cherish the year because his elder son Ramesh Babu debuted as a full fledged actor with Saamraat on October 2nd. 1988 was another mediocre year in his professional life because only four Kaliyuga Karnudu, Aswaddhama, Rowdy No 1 and & Mugguru Kodukulu of his ten releases had some kind of impact at the box-office. The next year, however, was a very gratifying one for the Superstar because he not only acted in successful films like Koduku Diddina Kapuram, Saahasamee Naa Oopiri, Gudachaari 117 and Goondaarajyam (collected~ 74 Lakh rupees in its first week) but also for getting elected to the lower house of the Parliament from Eluru (W.G.) in the general elections held in 1989.\n\n1990-Present\n\nThe years 1990-92 can be termed as the darkest period in his life because nothing went right for him both during this period. None of his films, barring Nagaasthram, fared well at the box-office and the actor took his longest break from work after Raktha Tharpanam, his last directorial venture in Telugu, tanked at the marquee. Ramesh's failure to capitalize on his blockbuster Bazaar Rowdy would have presumably upset him further during those unsettling times. Like other years ending with number 3 in the last two decades, 1993 also proved lucky to this Superstar and he came back strongly with the unexpected super success of Pacchani Samsaaram. But it was Vaaraasudu, his second release in the year, which made him the cynosure of the film fraternity again. The super-hit film, in which Krishna played a supporting role after a long time, however, incurred the wrath of his fans as it contained some scenes, which they thought, deprecated his image. Infact, the dissent was so great that the film-makers had to reach out to them through the print media requesting them to patronize the movie after chopping of those scenes and adding an action episode on him. But it was the film Number 1, which was another important turning point in his career as it helped him to cross-over to a new segment of audience. Released amidst tight competition during the festive season in January 1994, the film featured Krishna wearing flashy outfits and dancing with verve and energy. Audience, who were inundated with the lengthy dialogues in his movies, welcomed this image makeover and gave two-thumbs up for it. The film went on to become a phenomenal success and paradoxically, several producers requested him to appear in a song to help their film's cause. Amma Dongaa! (1995) was another thumping success in his career and the actor, instead of treading carefully to consolidate his re-gained stardom, went on a signing binge again while others were drastically reducing the number of films they acted to maximize revenues for each of their films. A string of flops followed Superstar Krishna and though Krishna became the fastest to reach the 300 films milestone (in a lead role), he was no longer a box-office phenomenon. This time, time was also not on his side to increase his personal stock as he was in his early fifties by then. The aged war-horse has since then been doing supporting roles in several insignificant films.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAfter he graduated from college, he married Indira Devi on November 1, 1962, with whom he has five children: two sons, Ramesh Babu (film producer) & actor Mahesh Babu; and three daughters; Padmavati, Manjula (film producer) and Priyadarshani. She provided him emotional support during his salad days. In 1965, she gave birth to their first child Ramesh Babu. In 1968, Krishna's daughter Padmavathi was born and in 1969, Krishna married his frequent leading lady Vijaya Nirmala.[1] and this created fodder for the gossip columns as they were still married to their respective spouses with children. Krishna continues to be married to his first wife Indira Devi and would have three more children with her: Manjula in 1970, Mahesh Babu in 1975, and Priyadarshini in 1979. He never had children with Vijayanirmala but he apparently raised her son Naresh from her first marriage as his own. He also supported Vijayanirmala's directorial aspirations by starring in the films she directed and was later proud when she made the Guiness Book of Records as the most prolific female director in 2002. Today he continues to act in small but significant roles in telugu films. His son Mahesh Babu has also become one of the top actors in the industry today. He has stated that Mahesh will not enter into any political business what-so-ever.\n\n1 Taene Manasulu (1st Movie) Sukanya Adurti Subbarao 31.03.65\n\n2 Kanne Manasulu Aduriti Subbarao 22.07.65\n\n3 Gudachari 116 Jayalalitha K.S.R.Das 11.08.66\n\n4 Iddaru Mongallu Sandhya rani B.Vitalacharya 03.03.67\n\n5 Saakshi Vijaya Nirmala Bapu 01.01.67\n\n6 Marapurani Katha Vanisri V.Rama Chandra Rao 27.07.67\n\n7 Stree Janma Vijayalakshmi K.S.Prakasa Rao 31.08.67\n\n8 Upayamlo Apayam Vijayalakshmi T.Krishna 07.09.67\n\n9 Private Master Sukanya K.Viswanath 14.09.67\n\n10 Ave kallu Kanchana A.C.Trilok Chandar 14.12.67\n\n11 Asadhyudu K.
