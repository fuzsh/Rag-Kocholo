        "text": "Shamili\n\nRemember Baby Shamili of Anjali fame? Yes, that Manirathnam flick! Well, many producers and directors wanted this girl, now grown up, to make her debut in their films but Shamili’s family had turned down the offers. Shamili is none other than sister of Shalini, Ajith Kumar’s wife.\n\nThe family that had said no till today, now wants Shamili to make her debut. And Fazil, who earlier introduced Shalini, will now introduce Shamili in a yet-to-be named Malayalam film. Will Shamili shine as much as her sister did?\n\nShamili acted in super hit films like 'Anjali', 'Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari' and many more. Her acting prowess was known to people when she was very young. Recently she was spotted in a function in Chennai. When enquired it was said that she is about to hit silver screen with a film in the combination of Siddhartha.\n\nWe already know that her brother Rishi is an actor on big screen. And Shalini stopped acting after marriage. Now Shamili also enters the acting league in her family.\n\nFilmography\n\nActress:\n\n1. Kandukondain Kandukondain (2000)\n\n2. Harikrishnans (1998) .... Ammalu\n\n3. Chinna Kannamma (1993) (as Baby Shamili)\n\n4. Joker (1993) (as Baby Shamili)\n\n5. Malootty (1992) (as Baby Shyamili) .... Malootty\n\n6. Kilukkampetti (1991) (as Baby Shamili) .... Chikkumol\n\n7. Pookkalam Varavayi (1991) .... Geethu\n\n8. Jagadeka Veerudu Attilokasundari (1990) (as Baby Shamili)\n\n9. Anjali (1990) (as Baby Shamili) .... Anjali\n\nSeetha has worked with some of the leading stars of the South Indian cinema. Her focus is now in small screen. She is synonymous with the success of the soap opera \"Penn\". Seetha talks about her career in cinema.\n\nTill now I have done over 125 films in all South Indian languages. Even today, I remember my first day of shooting for \"Aan Pavam,\" directed by R. Pandiarajan. I was studying in class 10 when I was asked to work in films. The director saw me in a video, taken during my friend's wedding. He made enquiries and approached me. Though I was not keen in acting, my father wanted to see me on the silver screen. After working in \"Aan Pavam,\" I decided that I must do justice to my roles.\n\nAfter my entry into films I became busy and in fact I worked all days for years till I got married. For about 12 years I did not work, as I wanted to take care of my children.\n\nSome of my best films were \"Pennmani Aval Kannmani\" and \"Puthiyapathai\" in which I liked my character very much. I liked my role in \"Unnal Mudiyum Thambi\" and in the recent film \"Parijatham.\" I enjoyed my character in \"Pranam,\" a Telugu film.\n\nI got offers in small screen even when I was busy in films. But it was not possible for me to give dates. When I came back after a lay off for nearly twelve years, I felt small screen was best suited to me. And I told producers and directors that I would not work on holidays and my schedules would be only from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. I also said a big NO to working in locations outside Chennai. My first serial was \"Velan\".\n\nWhen Radhika wanted me to work in \"Chitti\" I excused myself as I did not want to go outdoors. Even now, I come back home after 6 p.m. The basic thing is I am enjoying each and every day of my work.\n\nSeetha Parthiban\n\nFilmography\n\nActress:\n\n1. Bunny (2005)\n\n2.

She fought against all odds with dedication in her work until she died of breast cancer. Srividya was born on 24 July 1953 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India to Tamil film comedian Krishnamurthy and Carnatic classical singer M. L. Vasanthakumari. She had a brother, Sankararaman. Her father had to stop acting in the year she was born because of a disease which affected his facial musclesHer family fell into financial crisis. Her mother worked long hours to meet the family's financial needs. Srividya once reportedly said that her mother didn't even have time to breastfeed her.[Srividya debuted in acting very early in age. When her parent's marriage faced problems due to financial difficulties , Srividya's youth was blighted. She got a marriage proposal from a scientist based in the U.S., but the marriage did not materialize due to financial problems faced by her family Srividya launched her career in Malayalam films with a dance scene in Kumarasambhavam , directed by P.

She acted in films such as Sollathan Ninakkiren and Apoorva Raagangal, both directed by K. Balachander. The film Apoorva Raagangal(1975), in which she acted opposite the then-rising stars and now superstars of Tamil films, Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, virtually changed her life.

They had the support of their families, but they broke up. Later she fell in love with George Thomas, an assistant director in her Malayalam film Teekkanal She married him on 1978 January 9, despite opposition from her family.
