iPhone developer Tapulous has now sold more than five million songs through the in-game music store for its Tap Tap Revenge games.

What’s more, every week the store’s featured track – which is made available for free – is racking up more than 500,000 downloads from players.

The news comes as Tapulous announces a licensing deal with major label Warner Music Group to make four new premium games based on its artists in the next year.

The companies aren’t saying which artists, just that the games will include a mixture of hits, remixes, live tracks and rarities.
