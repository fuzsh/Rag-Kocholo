        "text": "In Kaniesâ words, this yet-undiscovered software is the âcommercial product that causes people to keep putting coins in the machine, to be slightly crass about it.â He hopes brand loyalty will get clients to buy the next Puppet product.\n\nIf Puppet Labs fails to develop this, the company will rapidly find itself reduced to a customer-service center for its free software.\n\nKanies admits this the same way he says everything: rapid-fire and brusque, his mouth curled between a smile and a sneer. Raised on a commune, Kanies got a Reed College chemistry degree and worked seven tech jobs in 2 1/2 years, developing a specialty in programs that manage large numbers of computers. His office is almost entirely undecorated, save for a few jagged streaks of red dry-erase marker painted on the walls by his 2-year-old twin daughters.\n\nHis talk often veers toward the dramatic: âEvery time somebody chooses not to use Puppet, itâs like a stake in my heart. Every time somebody says a good thing about a competitor on Twitter, I get this soul-crushing fear of total and utter destruction.â\n\nBut Kanies waves away the suggestion that it ran against good sense to start a company with software nobody pays for.\n\nâItâs counterintuitive that Facebook would build a website that doesnât charge,â he says. âItâs counterintuitive that Twitter doesnât charge for its website. Google doesnât charge you to use their website. Everything seems counterintuitive until itâs obvious.â\n\nFull disclosure: An employee at Willamette Weekâneither the author nor the editors of this pieceâis married to an employee at Puppet Labs.\n\nThe Speed Freak\n\nName: Scott Kveton\n\nAge: 37\n\nTitle: CEO, Urban Airship\n\nVenture capital funding: $6.5 million\n\nWhat colleagues say: âI donât think Scott ever met an opportunity he couldnât angle his way into. If he wasnât running a startup, heâd probably be running a drug cartel.â\n\nScott Kveton began attracting clients to his mobile application company Urban Airship with a bake sale. Actually, more of a bake giveaway.\n\nIt was the 2009 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, and Kveton didnât have a ticket to the âStevenoteââSteve Jobsâ annual speech, where the Apple CEO would debut the iPhone 3GS smartphone. But Kveton had heard that Apple devotees began lining up for the speech the night before. So he flew down from Portland, bought $1,500 worth of Danishes and muffins from Costco, and took a cab to the Moscone Center at 5 am to start handing out Urban Airship handbills and pastries to the people in line.\n\nâIt turns out,â says Kveton, still sounding genuinely surprised, âitâs a captive audience that doesnât tend to plan ahead, so theyâre all really hungry. And itâs the perfect target audience for us, because theyâre rabid, fanatical app developers. Probably the best 1,500 bucks we ever spent.â\n\nKveton later learned the stunt caught the attention of video-game maker Tapulous and sports behemoth ESPN, who joined a roster of Urban Airship clients that includes Warner Brothers, Disney and Groupon. Urban Airship makes apps for apps: It makes the programs that allow app companies to send out mass texts and take your money. The startup grew fast: In two years, it has sent 3.6 billion notifications, and its 16,000 production apps are currently used on 160 million mobile devices. It became profitable in six months, but is already back in the red as it prepares for expansion.\n\nThat speed and improvisation is typical of Kveton, who has flipped through entrepreneurial projects like other people move through the buffet line at Izzyâs. After graduating from Oregon State University, he co-founded the schoolâs influential development tank Open Source Labs, and was an executive at Portland startups Janrain and Vidoop.\n\nIn 2008, he created a company to sell bacon on the Internetâcalled bacn.com, because âthat vowel is an extraordinarily expensive vowelââand, after building sales to 400 to 600 pounds of pig daily, sold it to a rival bacon-selling website, baconfreak.com. He then co-authored a book about the project, From Idea to Web Start-up in 21 Days: Creating bacn.com. He confidently misremembers the title of the book, published last October, as âMakinâ Bacon.â Kveton doesnât look back.\n\nâYou have to go at this frenetic pace,â he says, flexing his thick shoulders as if preparing for his next barrage of words. âYou have to fail faster.â\n\nIt is perhaps for this reason that one of Urban Airshipâs principle hiring criteria is âthe airport testâ: âIf you were stuck in an airport with this person for eight hours because your flight was delayed, would you be psyched about that?â\n\nYet Kveton is convinced that his company is no flash in the pan.\n\nâWeâre a pickax-and-shovel business,â he says. âWhen you saw everybody run to the gold rush back in the 1800s, it was the folks that were selling pickaxes and shovels that did really well. I mean, Leviâs is a great example. They sold clothes to the people that were there. And they found, âJeez, thereâs a market for people who want these kinds of clothes,â and they grew a business from that. Our goal is to grow a sustainable business thatâs interesting, regardless of if itâs a gold rush or not.â\n\nThe State Secret\n\nName: Danielle Forsyth\n\nAge: 51\n\nTitle: CEO, Thetus Corporation\n\nVenture capital funding: $4.6 million\n\nWhat colleagues say: âSheâs a dork, like all great CEOs are dorks. And she is just killing it. Knocking it out of the park.â\n\nDanielle Forsyth likes to say that Thetus Corporation makes Internet software for âpeople who donât know what they donât know.â\n\nThat Rumsfeldian phrase is fitting: Few people in Portland have any idea that a woman CEOâa rare sight on the tech landscapeâis helming one of the cityâs fastest-growing software startups, a company thatâs been profitable for five years mostly thanks to federal government contracts.\n\nThetus has intentionally maintained a low profile locally. âWe donât have clients here,â Forsyth says, âand weâre really focused on growth.â\n\nOne of the companyâs first clients was in fact the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a wing of the Department of Defense that handles satellite imagery and maps. As Thetus took two rounds of venture capital after its 2003 founding, it also got an undisclosed amount of funding in 2005 from I-Q-Tel, a nonprofit venture fund created by the Central Intelligence Agency. Thetus now has a range of private clients, but its backbone is contracts with the Departments of Intelligence, Justice and Agriculture, as well as several Department of Defense commands. It is working on software for âaccountability for things like Terrorist Watch Lists.â\n\nAll of this sounds almost comically un-Portland, and it may not help that Forsyth is clandestine about personal information: She wonât even say where she went to school. But sheâs eager to talk about what Thetus makes, how it has moved into the private sector to work with groups like Mercy Corps, and how she believes every software product it develops is used to prevent war.\n\nWhat Thetus makes for the feds is Web applications, like its new release Savanna 2.0, that provide âmultidimensional analysisâ of dataâa fancy way of saying it builds online three-dimensional spreadsheets and models that show, in pictures, the differences and similarities between different groups, and displays them from different perspectives. Thatâs catnip for intelligence agencies working in unfamiliar countries and trying to guess at the connections between cultures they donât know much about.\n\nâSo, say Iâm negotiating a grocery-store contract in Turkey,â Forsyth says, âand I know as much as an American might know about Turkey, and Iâm looking at demographics and economics of where my grocery stores might fit. But there are certain things in any foreign environment that youâve got to consider: Are you close to religious institutions that might be offended by you being open? Our world has a lot of maps of relationships, maps of how affected things are by other things. Thatâs what our thing does.â\n\nThe outside of Thetusâ Old Town office looks nothing like a tech companyâitâs just another stately building on the downtown MAX line. But the company headquarters is a 20,000-square-foot space covered floor to ceiling with dry-erase boards and windows covered in equations and technical doodles.\n\nThe companyâs real secret may be that itâs a defense contractor with a decidedly liberal culture. âWe do business what we call âthe Left Coast way,ââ Forsyth says. The company built its hardwood floors out of reclaimed timber taken from defunct Vancouver basketball gym the Hoop. It offers free college courses to all of its 70 employees. It switched its health insurance company to provide benefits to gay couples.\n\nForsyth, whose gentle mannerisms resemble a dean of students at a touchy-feely college, is especially proud of Thetusâ in-house jam band, which plays about once a week and consists of any programmer who can play an instrument. Which is how, at the 2010 company retreat, 25 Thetus musicians improvised tunes into the night in the meeting room of the Hotel Oregon in McMinnville. Forsyth played flute.\n\nThe Banker 2.0\n\nName: Alex Payne\n\nAge: 27\n\nTitle: Chief product & technology officer, BankSimple\n\nVenture capital funding: $3.1 million\n\nWhat colleagues say: âAlex Payne, in terms of the Web, is very much a celebrity.â\n\nâPotentially revolutionary, but they donât know much about banking, so itâs a massively naive plan as well.â\n\nAlex Payne was once a Bank of America customer. He says this explains why heâs now mounting a direct challenge to the financial giant.\n\nâI havenât met too many happy Bank of America customers, Iâll tell you that,â he laughs.\n\nPayne has one of the hottest rÃ©sumÃ©s of any Portland programmer: He was one of the first employees hired by Twitter, where he worked for four years in San Francisco on the social networkâs developer platformâthe program that allows outside programmers to link their applications to Twitter.\n\nHis arrival in Portland last summer caused a buzz in tech circlesâespecially when he quit Twitter one week later to join BankSimple, a Brooklyn-based startup, founded by New Yorkers Josh Reich and Shamir Karkal.\n\nLetâs clarify one thing: BankSimple isnât a bank. Instead, it is a front end for banks: A Web application company that plans to partner with established commercial banks with no previous retail presence to provide checking and savings accounts and debit cards, as well as credit lines and personal loans.\n\nPayne contends that this pared-down, exclusively online and mobile banking can beat Wall Street firms by targeting people who find most bank policies byzantine and daunting, and offering them great customer service.\n\nâThe [major] banks are more interested in earning revenue from fees and charges than they are from doing traditional banking and helping their customers out,â Payne says. âThose banks have, in some cases, actually invested in custom software that is designed to re-order transactions in such a way that more fees happen. If you donât mind alienating your customers en masse, itâs a great way to make a pile of money.â\n\nBankSimple will charge no overdraft or maintenance fees. (It plans to make money from interest on loans, plus the small earnings every bank gets when a debit card is used.) The company will eliminate the distinction between checking and savings accounts, automatically transferring funds to earn the most possible interest. It will provide customers with a âsafe to spendâ balance based on bill-payment patterns. Most daringly, it will automate budgeting for customers trying to save toward individual goals.\n\nThe company will begin a gradual launch this summerâPayne and his Brooklyn partners are testing their own debit cards this monthâbut it already has a waiting list of 50,000 people who have signed up to bank with anonymous lending institutions through BankSimple.\n\nPayne expects the major banks to retaliate with their own reforms, but doesnât think they can keep up. And heâs not worried about being muscled out through the regulatory system: âWe certainly have our own lawyers, we have our own banking-industry consultants.â\n\nAs BankSimpleâs anchor in Portland, Payne sees an opportunity to combine the cityâs famed liberal conscience with digital innovation.\n\nâWhen I look at a lot of other young techie folks,â he says, âtheyâre working for gaming companies. I think there are some more fundamental problems. When you pick up the paper every morning and you see people losing their homes and losing their jobs due to a massive financial crisis and a clear lack of ethics and compassion in that industryâthereâs clearly a problem there that technology could help solve.â\n\nBespectacled and soft-spoken, Payne is most immediately noticeable for some very loud tattoos. On his right shoulder is a multicolored portrait of Ada Lovelace, Lord Byronâs daughter, who helped write the first computer algorithms in the 19th century. On his left forearm are two Chinese characters: âThis is a reminder that everything changes.â\n\nThe Exit Strategist\n\nName: Nitin Khanna\n\nAge: 40\n\nTitle: CEO, MergerTech Advisors\n\nVenture capital funding: None\n\nWhat colleagues say: âHeâs actually been quite a lightning rod in the [startup] community. Heâs an entrepreneurâs entrepreneur.â\n\nWhile most Portland tech executives are trying to get into the software business, Nitin Khanna is interested in getting them out. His formula is simple: Heâs a multimillionaire who thinks Portland urgently needs more people as rich as he is.\n\nâThe only way to create the kind of investing thatâs going on in Seattle and the Bay Area is to create tech millionaires here in town,â Khanna says. âIf weâre not keeping them in town and not helping them exit [their companies], that workâs never converting into wealthâand therefore not being multiplied for future companies.â\n\nKhanna says this from a couch in the lobby of the Hotel Lucia. Parked outside on Southwest Broadway is his white Maserati with the license plate âKHANNA.â Itâs the second one heâs bought since selling Saber Corp., the software company he founded with his brother Karan, for $420 million to Electronic Data Systems in 2007. Saber started by making voter registration and driverâs license-processing software for the state of Oregon, and by the time the Khannas exited, the company had expanded to provide similar software to elections, DMV and child-services departments in 46 states.\n\nKhanna, who was born in Ambala, India, and spent his childhood watching his uncle sell wood and coal, now lives in a condo in the South Waterfrontâs John Ross tower. (âHelps my liver not being by all the bars,â he says, though he adds that heâs thinking of opening his own pub there.) He says the millions havenât changed his life. âHardly. I probably travel over a hundred days a year for pleasure, but other than that freedom, Iâm much more deeply involved with my kids.â\n\nBut heâs sure that enough fellow tech millionaires would create a groundswell for software investment and mentoringâand local entrepreneurs who can start a second company with plenty of cash on hand. So he and Karan have started MergerTech, an investment bank designed to help startups âexitâ by selling to a buyer.\n\nThe bank aims only for startups trying to sell for less than $100 million: âThe big banks wonât look at youâ if your company is that size, he says. âIn my mind, there was an almost complete gapâthere was almost no solution for that entrepreneur to say, âI want, not a broker, not somebody who knows a few guys, but an actual investment bank with investment bankers who are very tech-savvy and whoâll actually market me on a global basis.ââ\n\nMergerTechâs first big sale was last month, when it struck a deal for the purchase of year-old Portland startup SecondPorchâwhich links vacation homeowners with potential rentersâto a similar company in Austin, Texas, called HomeAway.\n\nIn April, Khanna announced the start of another groupâthis one a private-public partnershipâwith the same millionaire-producing goal: Portland 100, a Portland Development Commission-led initiative that seeks to identify 100 local companies in technology, apparel and alcohol that could eventually be sold for millions. The project officially kicks off this week, with the vocal support of Oregon State Treasurer Ted Wheeler.\n\nSo, how soon can Portlandâs software scene compete nationally? Khanna mulls that question.\n\nâThree to five years, maybe,â he says. âBecause itâs been a drought, and we need to fix that. Over a 15-year period, with two bubbles, we havenât had one company be north of a half-billion valuation from start to finish. None that I can think of.â"
