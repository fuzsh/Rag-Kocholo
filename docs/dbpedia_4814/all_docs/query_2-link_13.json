We've just added a bot to our match3 game, Token Smash, to enhance the multiplayer experience. In early-stage multiplayer games, finding an opponent on the same server can be challenging. Our new bot solves this by identifying possible swaps and making moves from the server side, ensuring that players always have a worthy opponent to play against. This bot also allows players to continue the game if their opponent gets disconnected.
