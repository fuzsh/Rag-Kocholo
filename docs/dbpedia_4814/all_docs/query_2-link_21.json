I was able to locate Tap Tap Revenge 3 in my purchase history, download it, and install it on my iPhone 5c running iOS 8.3. The game doesn't function anymore as the game servers have shut down, but it was able to run beyond the launch image at least, which suggests that the app can indeed run provided it doesn't have compatibility issues or depend on any servers that have been taken offline.\n\nTapulous shut down in January 2014 and I don't expect their developer account to still be active today. According to the linked article, IAPs cannot be restored, so there is that. I can confirm that the app itself is still available for download in my purchase history, however.\n\nanswered Jun 16, 2015 at 9:34\n\nBoltClockBoltClock\n\n718k164164 gold badges1.4k1.4k silver badges1.4k1.4k bronze badges"
