        "text": "Hello, and happy Friday, everyone! If you missed yesterday’s newsletter in your inbox, it’s here. For the email version today’s newsletter (it’s easier to read), click here.\n\nAlso, a quick reminder that we’re stepping away for two weeks beginning this Monday for some downtime at home with the kiddos. In our place, we’re excited to feature Semil Shah, a smartypants when it comes to consumer products, a consultant to various venture firms, and an investor with Haystack Fund. He’ll be publishing an abbreviated version of the newsletter and if you don’t like it, feel to complain to him on Twitter at@semil. (Just kidding! Keep your complaints to yourself.) You can see some of the good stuff he has lined up here. Thank you again, Semil.:)\n\n—–\n\nTop News in the A.M.\n\nMicrosoft has to fork over customer’s e-mails held in a server overseas, a federal judge ruled yesterday. Writes the Washington Post, “”The case — the first of its kind in the United States — is a test of whether the government can assert a right to digital content wherever in the world it is stored.” More here.\n\n—–\n\nHomer is a Good Idea; Now, Will it Work?\n\nA week ago, the latest creation to come out of Max Levchin’s R&D lab, HVF, was publicly released. Unfortunately for Levchin, a widely read review suggested the app, called Homer, was “creepily intimate” because it allows users to view other people’s home screens.\n\nGiven that users have to choose to make a conscious decision to upload their own home screens with Homer and have full control over what apps they share, it’s hard to see how the app is truly intrusive. On the contrary, in an era where an endless supply of apps now compete for attention, Homer can help users discover useful new apps that their friends enjoy. It also comes with more privacy protections than that initial review suggested.\n\nHomer’s bigger problem, seemingly, is that it wasn’t ready for prime time when it launched. Though some VCs immediately began talking up the iOS app, users weren’t so charitable, giving Homer three out of five stars. Two called it “very buggy,” and a third commented, “Nice concept but can’t even use the app.” Perhaps not surprisingly, HVF says it doesn’t have a timeline for an Android version.\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, Homer’s creators, fellow Stanford grads Elliot Babchick and Jason Riggs, quickly volunteered that the app, which they began working on in April, isn’t perfect. “We’re still working on it full-time,” said Riggs. “There’s still plenty to do, like making it faster and fixing bugs … this is basically a [minimum viable product], and we’re making it better.”\n\nThe question is whether they’ll get another shot from users. Apple’s approval process can take days; it can also take weeks. That’s a lot of time for a buggy app to be out in the wild.\n\nThere’s also a slight risk that Apple will decide it doesn’t like the app after all, especially given the early public impression that it’s somehow meddlesome. Babchick noted that while “someone at Apple did check a box and let us through,” its guidelines are somewhat squishy. “Years ago, the rule was that you weren’t allowed to feature any other app within your app. Since then, the clause has evolved to say that you can’t promote an app unless it’s to a specific set of people for a specific use case.” Apple, he added, “is leaving itself the opportunity to interpret [new apps] how they wish.”\n\nHVF is a member of Apple’s affiliate program — reason for the team to feel some degree of confidence. In fact, Homer can “technically be making money off apps that we refer people to,” though “we’re not doing that yet,” Babchick says.\n\nAsked how long it makes sense to give an app a chance, Babchick told me, “We don’t set an arbitrary guideline that we’ll work on [this or that project] for an amount of time and if it doesn’t make it, [we’ll move on]. Once you start seeing solid retention, for a significant period of time, that’s when you know you have a thing. For something that [came out last Friday], we don’t have the answer.”\n\n—–\n\nNew Fundings\n\nEfficient Drivetrains, an eight-year-old, Beijing-based maker of hybrid and electric drivetrains, has raised $3.5M in Series A funding led by Jinyuan Development Company, with participation from Silicon Valley China Venture Partners and the Shanghai Gui Guo Assets Management Partnership.\n\nForage, a new, San Francisco-based meal-kit delivery startup focused on chef-approved recipes that customers can create at home in 20 minutes, has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding, reports Venture Capital Dispatch.

Nautilus, its new program, will invest $100,000 in as many as 10 projects at a time, according to an earlier Reuters report out of Jerusalem that notes AOL already has a development center in Israel. Merav Rotem-Naaman, formerly of Better Place, is directing the program. More information is coming soon, suggests Nautilus’s new site.\n\nCanaan Partners, the 27-year-old venture firm, with offices in the U.S., Israel, and India, is raising a $600 million fund with a $650 million cap, reports peHUB. “The fundraising will go fast, their numbers are really good,” one unnamed LP tells the outlet.

TechCrunch has much more here.\n\n—–\n\nExits\n\nMitro, a two-year-old, New York-based that stores and allows users to share cloud service credentials, has been acquired by Twitter, Mitro announced yesterday. The terms were undisclosed, but as TechCrunch notes, Twitter isn’t shutting down the service. Instead, Mitro is becoming an open source project, at least through year end. Mitro had raised $1.2 million in seed funding from Google Ventures and Matrix Partners.\n\nPropeller, a one-year-old, San Francisco-based mobile startup that helps users create their own apps, has been acquired by the data analysis company Palantir for undisclosed terms.

The deal marks the second acquisition that Palantir has announced this week. It’s other purchase: Poptip, a two-year-old, New York-based startup that helps companies conduct social media surveys and analyze online conversations and other unstructured conversation. Palantir has raised nearly $900 million from investors over its 10-year history, including a $107.5 million round last year that valued the company at $9 billion.\n\nSimbionix, a 17-year-old, Cleveland, Oh.-based maker of 3D virtual reality surgical simulation and training, has been acquired for $120 million in cash by publicly traded 3D Systems.

ZDNet has a bit more here.\n\n—–\n\nPeople\n\nAll right, eBay. Finally, a tech giant that’s not so white, and not so male.\n\nVenture capitalist Tim Draper is profiled in BusinessWeek, which reports that his father, Bill Draper, is “skeptical about [the younger Draper’s] Six Californias plan but has learned not to doubt his son. ‘He got hit three times by automobiles on his bicycle. He’s kind of a lucky guy as well as a risk-taker,’ he says, going on to recount a time when, in China, Tim at midnight walked up to a street vendor who was selling what he claimed was snake blood that would improve one’s brain. Tim downed a cup and was fine. ‘Tim has a way of getting away with murder, almost,’ Bill says.”\n\nSnapchat’s VP of Engineering, Peter Magnusson, has left the company just six months after being lured away from Google.

Such is the case with Collaborative Fund, a three-year-old, New York-based venture fund focused on collaborative-consumption models and backed by some big wheels, including former Sequoia Capital general partner Tom McMurray, private equity veteran Doug Smith, and Jay Kim, a venture partner and investor in Collaborative who co-founded the video game developer Nexon Corp in 1994. (The bootstrapped company went public in 2011 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is now valued in the billions of dollars.)\n\nIndeed, the same group of investors to back Collaborative are today rolling out a new, special purpose entity called Alignment Holdings that counts Collaborative founder Craig Shapiro as one general partner and Smith — who will be leading the outfit’s day-to-day affairs — the other. The idea, says Shapiro, is to work with companies that are producing real revenue, without forcing them to adhere to the constraints of a typical fund. “The life of most funds is 10 years, and you have a three- or four-year investment period after which you’re expected to harvest investments.” With Alignment, “We can invest in a business and hold it for 20 years or more.”\n\nI talked with Shapiro yesterday about how Alignment works, who would use it, and why he’s suddenly involved with two very disparate funds.\n\nWhat was the impetus for Alignment?\n\nIt kind of came together because we were seeing mission-driven founders not being excited about their current liquidity options. Some feel like selling their business would detract from their mission and that going public is arduous and expensive and makes them beholden to a quarterly result. This is targeting companies whose early-stage investors may be looking to exit. It’s almost like a leveraged buyout, where we say, “At this price, we’re going to purchase your preferred shares.”\n\nDon’t secondary sales address this issue?\n\nYou’re seeing some people solve for that problem through secondary markets, but it can also be really distracting, deciding who gets to sell their shares and for how much. It’s why we chose to create vehicle that’s evergreen. While the purchase side is the same — we won’t be doing anything different than, say, a private equity firm that buys shares on the secondary market — the difference is that the private equity firm will expect [to receive several times their investment] within a few years. With us, companies have a significantly longer time period to [produce a return] through smaller chunks based on revenue. It’s more like a mortgage on your house.\n\nHave you raised the capital yet? If not, how much are you targeting?\n\nWe’ve raised money; Jay [Kim] is our anchor investor, but it’s still open, so our attorneys have advised us to be cautious about what we share.\n\nDoes this kind of structure rule out syndicates?\n\nWe could partner with an entity that has a similar return profile, but yes, it wouldn’t work if we were working with a private equity or venture shop that’s hoping a company is going go public. If I’m a VC, I’m saying, “Reinvest everything so we can get to the IPO.” Alignment is targeting companies that don’t want to rush, that would rather buy [their shares] back from employees and shareholders and refinance the company.\n\nWhat size checks will you be writing, what kind of return do you expect, and how long will these terms be?\n\nThe size of checks will vary pretty greatly, and we can structure [these arrangements] in different ways. If a company is throwing off a lot of cash, it can carry a larger debt component at a lower rate. If it isn’t throwing off a lot of cash, you can extend the life [of the loan] but have additional equity, so if the company has a liquidity event, Alignment gets some upside.\n\nDo you expect that some of Collaborative’s portfolio companies [which include Kickstarter, Lyft, TaskRabbit, and Hampton Creek Foods] will eventually be candidates for Alignment? If so, would that be a conflict?\n\nWe’ve formed an external investment committee to deal with any conflicts. The truth, though, is that because Collaborative Fund is investing so early, it will likely be years before any of our companies would be ready for Alignment Holdings. But I think it would be a great thing.\n\n—–\n\nNew Fundings\n\n1006.tv, a five-year-old, Beijing-based mobile game media company, has raised $10 million in Series B funding led by Sequoia Capital, with ClearVue Partners participating. China Money Network reports that last year, the company raised “several million” dollars in Series A funding led by Matrix Partners, which had also provided the company with seed funding in 2011.\n\nABA English, a three-year-old, Barcelona-based online English-learning platform, has raised $3.4 million from the venture firm Nauta Capital.\n\nBluegrass Vascular Technologies, a four-year-old, Lexington, Ky.-based medical device maker focused on vascular access, has raised $4.5 million in Series A funding led by Targeted Technology Fund II, with unnamed individual investors participating. As part of the deal, Bluegrass will move to San Antonio, Tx., where Targeted Technology is based.\n\nCold Genesys, a nearly four-year-old, Newport Beach, Ca.-based company that’s been developing a drug to treat bladder cancer, has raised $13.57 million in Series A financing from Ally Bridge Group.\n\nDstillery, a six-year-old, New York-based ad tech company, has raised $24 million in Series C funding led by NewSpring Capital. Earlier backers U.S. Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures and Venrock also participated in the round, which brings the company’s total funding to $52 million, shows Crunchbase.\n\nGetYourGuide, a five-year-old, Zurich-based compendium of tourism activities that works with more than 1,000 partners whose products it uploads, bookings it manages and payments it processes through a central system, has raised $25 million in new funding from two earlier investors, Spark Capital and Highland Capital Partners Europe. “I like this business because no one’s really aggregated this before,” says Spark Capital’s Alex Finkelstein to Dealbook. The company has now raised $45.5 million altogether.\n\nGreen Charge Networks, a five-year-old, Santa Clara, Ca.-based energy storage company, has raised $56 million in funding from the New York-based power producer K Road DG. Forbes has more here.\n\nMoogsoft, 2.5-year-old, San Francisco-based company whose software detects and repairs outages that its customers’ IT monitoring systems can’t see, has raised $11.3 million in Series B funding led by Wing Venture Capital. Earlier investors, including Redpoint Ventures, also participated in the round, which brings the company’s total funding to $18 million.\n\nPagerDuty, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based software-as-a-service company that helps IT ops resolve problems faster by sending them automatic alerts about errors, has raised $27.2 million in Series B funding by Bessemer Venture Partners. Earlier investors Andreessen Horowitz, Baseline Ventures, and Harrison Metal also joined the round, which brings the company’s total funding to roughly $40 million.\n\nSocialCops, a two-year-old, Delhi, India-based social analytics and reporting app that helps users report problems in their vicinity, like potholes, has raised $350,000 in seed funding from 500 Startups, Rajan Anandan, Manoj Menon and other angels, reports DealCurry.\n\n—–\n\nIPOs\n\nIt isn’t just Mobileye.

Terms of the transaction, expected to close next month, are not being disclosed. Gyft had raised $6 million in Series A funding, including from Karlin Ventures, Google Ventures, A-Grade Investments, Canyon Creek Capital, The Social+Capital Partnership, and individual investors David Sacks and Haas Portman.\n\nIcebergs, a 1.5-year-old, Barcelona-based online collaboration service that helps users organize their research and projects, has been acquired by Pinterest for an undisclosed amount. Its two co-founders are relocating from Spain to San Francisco to join Pinterest, the company tells TechCrunch. Meanwhile, the Iceberg service will be shut down on September 1.\n\nSifteo, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based interactive game platform, has been acquired by 3D Robotics, the unmanned aerial vehicle company led by former Wired editor Chris Anderson. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Sifteo had raised $16 million from investors, including True Ventures, Foundry Group, and Foundation Capital. 3D Robotics, meanwhile, has raised $35 million to date, including from some of those same investors. GigaOm has more here.\n\nSnapchat, the mobile-messaging phenomenon, is talking with Alibaba about a new round of funding that could value the three-year-old company at $10 billion dollars, with a B.

If it isn’t throwing off a lot of cash, you can extend the life [of the loan] but have additional equity, so if the company has a liquidity event, Alignment gets some upside.\n\nDo you expect that some of Collaborative’s portfolio companies [which include Kickstarter, Lyft, TaskRabbit, and Hampton Creek Foods] will eventually be candidates for Alignment? If so, would that be a conflict?\n\nWe’ve formed an external investment committee to deal with any conflicts. The truth, though, is that because Collaborative Fund is investing so early, it will likely be years before any of our companies would be ready for Alignment Holdings. But I think it would be a great thing.\n\nSign up for our morning missive, StrictlyVC, featuring all the venture-related news you need to start you day.\n\nIt is Wednesday, people.

CEO Dick Costolo tells Business Insider how the company did it.\n\n—–\n\nA New Venture Firm Bets on India\n\nOne of the biggest venture fundings ever was confirmed yesterday, a billion-dollar round for the India-based e-commerce company, Flipkart.\n\nVispi Daver and Murli Ravi hope it’s a good omen for their new venture capital firm, Unicorn Venture Capital — named not after a popular blog post, they say, but a mythological creature in East Asian culture associated with prosperity. Indeed, with a little luck, they’ll raise the $50 million they’re targeting for their debut fund, which they intend to invest in early-stage tech startups in India, Singapore and Southeast Asia.\n\nTheir backgrounds should help. Daver spent eight years at Sierra Venture Partners, where he led several deals in India-based companies, including Makemytrip, one of India’s largest online travel companies. (It went public on Nasdaq almost exactly four years ago.) Ravi, meanwhile, spent the last five years as the head of South Asia investments for JAFCO Asia in Singapore. I spoke with Daver earlier this week about the duo’s plans.\n\nMurli is staying in Singapore while you move from the U.S. to India. What’s the competition like where you’re headed?\n\nThere are only about 40 people on the tech side of VC with early-stage investing experience in India and that’s probably across 10 groups, from indigenous funds to Sand Hill Road firms. It’s still very early there. MakeMyTrip is just one of three [India-based] venture-backed public tech companies, and the only one on Nasdaq.\n\nDo LPs think it’s still too early? I’d read that $190 million was invested in early-stage tech firms in India last year, up 25 percent from 2012. But those are still small numbers.\n\nNo, the growth metrics are too exciting. Talk with any tech bellwether – Facebook, Google, Evernote, Dropbox, Salesforce – and they’ll tell you about downloads from India. Growth on the smart phone side has wowed everyone. Facebook already has 100 million users in India – the second biggest base of users after the U.S. If you take into consideration [other] app stats, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Vietnam – they’re all in the top 30 [in terms of users] and they’ll be in the top 10 soon, based on economic and population [trends].\n\nHow well do you and Murli know each other? Have you made investments together?\n\nWe’ve known each other for a year and looked at 75 companies together — two of which we’ve invested in and will grandfather into the new fund. We both grew up in Mumbai. He was one of those really smart kids who the Singaporean government sucks into the system, sending them to premier educational institutions and to a premier investment house after. [Before joining JAFCO, Ravi was a senior associate at Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings.]\n\nWhy does it make sense to operate from two different posts?\n\nNo tech company is focused on Singapore alone, where just five million people live, and similarly we think that Indian startups will be expanding into Southeast Asia and that having a presence there will be helpful. From a legal and regulatory perspective, it makes a lot of sense for India companies to [plant their] headquarters there. It’s very developed, with a government that works really well. There are also lots of positives in terms of easy living.\n\nHow do you feel personally about returning to India?\n\nI’m excited. The environment in India is interesting. Entrepreneurship is generally in a lot of people’s blood. There weren’t as many professional jobs for the last generation, so a lot of people were entrepreneurs and it’s not a big convincing act to get people to [take the plunge]. It’s also the case the young developers are less and less different than their counterparts elsewhere. They’re using the same apps and learning the same ways to code. Big ideas can come out of India, too.\n\n—–\n\nNew Fundings\n\nAbodo, a 3.5-year-old, Madison, Wi.-based apartment listing service, has raised $1.25 million in Series A funding led by American Family Ventures.

They might be disappointed, reports Recode.\n\n—–\n\nMeritech Capital Just Raised $500 Million; Here’s Why It Didn’t Raise More\n\nMeritech Capital Partners has just finished raising a fifth, $500 million fund, the firm tells StrictlyVC.\n\nThat’s a lot of money, but the 15-year-old, Palo Alto, Ca.-based late-stage venture firm could have raised much more. Fully 38 of the firm’s portfolio companies have either been acquired or gone public since the second half of 2009. Among them: Facebook, which went public in 2012; the e-commerce company Zulily, which held its IPO last November; and the social networking network Yammer, acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion in cash in 2012. In fact, Meritech’s fourth, $425 million fund, closed just three years ago, has already reaped nearly as much as investors poured into it.\n\nSo why didn’t Meritech collect more than it did, especially when startups are eschewing public markets longer and raising more of their capital from private investors? Because the firm’s five partners think the trend is temporary and not part of a permanent restructuring. Yesterday, I talked about it with Meritech’s cofounder and managing director, Paul Madera.\n\nYou’ve had loads of exits over the last five years. What do you see happening over the next 6 to 12 months in terms of IPOs and M&A?\n\nI think we’ll continue to have a strong IPO market – which also helps M&A. A healthy IPO market means valuations are generally stable and increasing, and since acquirers rely on having stability and ever more valuable currency, it makes them more comfortable about reaching out and making acquisitions. It will also continue to be a great time to harvest liquidity from our venture portfolio.\n\nInteresting phrasing. Do you think it’s a better time for exits than new investments?\n\nIt’s a wonderful time to harvest and a time to be very careful with new investments. I say that as someone who invests in later-stage companies, where the value is running ahead of the economic opportunity. Valuations are just horrific. Now is just not a great time to put a lot of money into later-stage companies. Now is a time to be cautious and slow and careful.\n\nHow much have valuations jumped in the last year, would you say?\n\nI think they may be two or three times where they were a year ago, with similar performance parameters. Of course, that doesn’t apply to everything out there. But it does apply to a narrower group of companies that tend to be within certain sectors where you can show tremendous growth very quickly and that are backed by great, brand-name early-stage firms.\n\nSoaring valuations are obviously being driven, at least in part, by “outside” investors, including mutual funds and hedge funds. Do you have any sense that their days of offering sky-high valuations are numbered?\n\nA lot of groups pulled back from March through early June given the downturn in the public markets, but they’re back investing at full speed once again right now. They’re in a new sector of investing. It used to be early-, mid-, and late-stage investing. Now there’s this pre-IPO stage that’s growing dramatically in terms of the money going in, and it’s the functional result of companies staying private longer, which these private IPOs allow them to do and that companies have gotten quite smart about. They’re hiring agents and advisors who will let them get [in front of] these groups in an efficient way, and they’re running processes that let them get the best valuation and terms.\n\nIs this the new normal?\n\nI think it’s [part of] a cycle, that it’s transitory, and that’s why we didn’t raise more money. I think some of these groups are doing, and will do, fine. But the last time we saw firms doing pre-IPO stuff was in 1999 and 2000. And they aren’t doing it anymore.\n\n—–\n\nNew Fundings\n\nBaifendian, a five-year-old, Beijing-based company that develops recommendation engines for e-commerce sites, has raised $25 million in Series C funding from undisclosed sources, according to China Money Network.

Shahin Farshchi tends to contemplate, well, harder stuff.\n\n“I stay away from the rent-your couch or parking space [startups],” says Farshchi, who joined Lux Capital as a principal in 2006 and was made a partner last month. “I have a semiconductor background, so I spend time looking at technology in the hardware space, from materials that enable higher-performance electronics, to devices like transistors and memories, to systems and software to run on those systems.”\n\nGiven his education – including a PhD in electrical engineering from UCLA – it’s no wonder. I recently caught up with Farshchi over an egg-white brunch at the Creamery in Palo Alto, Ca. There, we talked more about his new job and how he plans to put his stamp on the industry.\n\nFirst, let’s get readers up to speed on Lux Capital. Give us the broad brushstrokes.\n\nSure, we’ve been around for 14 years, and we’ve invested in more than 35 companies over three funds, including a $250 million fund we closed last year. Until recently, we focused on cutting checks in the millions [of dollars] as the Series A or B lead; over the last 12 months, we’ve also been experimenting with a seed-stage strategy to monitor companies closely and bring value to them [as a front-seat passenger], with the goal of converting those seed positions into Series A positions.\n\nOur biggest check would be in the higher single digits, but we set aside $10 million to $15 million per company; we want to maintain double digital ownership of [any] billion dollar outcome.\n\nYou focus largely on chips, which aren’t really being built in the U.S. anymore. So what’s happening here that’s interesting to you?\n\nIt’s true that a lot of core technology is moving to Asia. A lot of fabless semiconductor companies, Qualcomm, Broadcom – all their manufacturing is taking place in Asia, and a lot of bleeding edge technology companies in semiconductors are Asian companies.\n\nBut there’s still a lot of innovation that needs to be done, and you’d be surprised by how much is happening here. One of my companies, Molecular Imprints, [an Austin, Tx.-based company] which makes a next-generation semiconductor manufacturing technology [called nanoimprint lithography], sold to Canon earlier this year.\n\nHow do these next-generation technologies get around or reduce the considerable expense — which is something like $100 million, right? — involved in designing a new chip?\n\nI just invested in a stealth company that’s playing into this challenge — the $100 million upfront cost associated with building a new chip. If you’re a semiconductor company making a chip, it has to go into every single one of these smartphones [that we all use]. Otherwise, you aren’t going to make money. But not all products have the same requirements, so you wind up making a chip that’s okay for most of the devices out there but not optimized for anything [specific].\n\nThis stealth company is introducing software programmable silicon, where you can configure that portion that you need, so the chips become far less like Sunday papers of yore, where you threw out a lot of sections, and more like iPads, where you’re actually viewing and getting what you want.\n\nThis technology doesn’t already exist today?\n\nIt does, with field programmable data arrays. But they come at a huge expense in terms of area and power and make no sense unless you’re making a $10,000 chip that will go into a Cisco switch. But this [startup’s] technology is making it accessible for [a broader array of technologies].\n\nIt’s also much cheaper. Right now, it costs orders of magnitude more in terms of price and power and performance to make something programmable instead of hard-baking it, so it makes better sense to make things redundant versus having things programmable. But this technology makes things programmable without the huge cost and performance penalties.\n\nLux was founded in New York and only opened an office here a year or so ago, but it seems like the firm is succeeding in raising its profile on the West Coast. What’s that process been like?\n\nFor years, I was working out of my car and basically borrowing office space. We had a $100 million fund, so the economics didn’t support [a second office]. I basically spent all my time walking up and down the halls of Stanford, Caltech, UC Berkeley, UCLA. My first deals were all university spin-outs. Now, we have an office and we’ve become more broadly founder focused. That’s maybe why you’re hearing more about us.\n\n—–\n\nNew Fundings\n\nBirdi, a year-old, Brooklyn, Ny.-based company that makes a smart smoke detector that also gauges air quality, has raised $700,000 in new seed funding, including from Jason Calacanis and his AngelList syndicate; Kapor Capital; Eric Ries; and John Galbraith.

The firm was founded by Brian Lee, a co-founder of Legalzoom, Shoedazzle and The Honest Company. A second managing director listed on the filing is Richard Jun, who spent four-and-a-half years as the general counsel of Shoedazzle. The firm says it is focused on early-stage opportunities across a variety of sectors, with a particular focus on L.A.- and Southern California-based companies.\n\n—–\n\nIPOs\n\nOcular Therapeutix, an eight-year-old, Bedford, Ma.-based biopharmaceutical company that’s developing therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, including a gel to treat glaucoma, saw its shares rise 1.5 percent on Friday, its first day of trading on the Nasdaq. The company sold 5 million shares at $13 per share.\n\nThis week, 22 U.S. IPOs are planned. Here’s a look at what’s coming.\n\n—–\n\nExits\n\nBookLamp, a seven-year-old, Boise, Id.-based book recommendation service, has been acquired by Apple for between $10 million and $15 million, reports TechCrunch.\n\n—–\n\nPeople\n\nY Combinator president Sam Altman talks to EconTalk host Russ Roberts about Y Combinator’s strategy for discovering, funding, and coaching startups and Silicon Valley’s attitude toward entrenched firms.\n\nYou might think so from the daily headlines, but Silicon Valley’s highest paid female executive is not Marissa Mayer, Meg Whitman, or Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nLyft president John Zimmer on the the company’s New York debut, regulation, and the taxi industry: “The Department of Financial Services reached out a few weeks ago. We met with them, and we thought the meeting went very well. But then, when we tried to reach back out, we weren’t hearing anything.”\n\n—–\n\nJob Listings\n\nDropbox is looking to add someone who is well-versed in mobile partnerships to its strategic partner development team. The job is in San Francisco.\n\n—–\n\nData\n\nHalf of iOS developers and 64 percent of Android developers earn less than $500 in revenue per app per month, with just 1.6 percent of developers generating most of the app store revenue.\n\nEuropean startups raised more than $2.8 billion in the second quarter, the highest quarterly total since 2001, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource.\n\n—–\n\nEssential Reads\n\nAmazon is launching a Web store for 3D customizable products.\n\nPsst, illicit drugs are part of Silicon Valley work culture.\n\nSpaceX‘s lawsuit against the Air Force is gaining steam.\n\nBitcoin mining can be a giant pain in the arse.
