        "text": "\"It definitely is a strategic move and it highlights the importance we put on mobile,\" Steve Wadsworth, president of Disney Interactive Media Group, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe initial focus will be on making games for Apple's iPhone, iPad and other emerging mobile platforms, he said.\n\nTapulous already has 30 million users on Apple platforms with games such as Tap Tap Revenge, for which it has put out versions with artists such as Metallica, Coldplay, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber. A new game called Riddim Ribbon features The Black Eyed Peas.\n\nTapulous's small staff will remain at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, which Mr Wadsworth said is a benefit because it is in the high-tech developer community around San Francisco. Disney also owns Pixar Animation Studios in nearby Emeryville.\n\nHe did not disclose the terms of the acquisition.\n\nTapulous founder and chief executive Bart Decrem and chief operating officer Andrew Lacy will take on mobile business development roles at Disney as part of the deal, Mr Wadsworth said.\n\nAs a possible benefit, Disney could usher artists such as Plain White T's from its label, Hollywood Records, onto Tap Tap platforms, but Wadsworth declined to speculate on future products.\n\nDisney has had some success of its own in mobile applications. It recorded more than a million downloads of such apps as Alice in Wonderland Lite and JellyCar2."
