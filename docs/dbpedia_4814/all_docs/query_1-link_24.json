        "text": "Warner Music Group may not like the licensing terms for selling music through the Rock Band video game franchise, but it likes mobile rhythm game Tap Tap Revenge just fine.\n\nThe label struck a deal with the game’s developer, Tapulous, to both promote and sell WMG artists’ music through the series.\n\nFrom the release:\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, over the next year Tapulous will release and promote four premium games featuring top WMG artists. Premium paid games will include the artist’s greatest hits and bonus tracks of remixes, previously unreleased material or live recordings. In addition, Tapulous will sell downloadable songs from WMG’s artists as part of its wildly popular Tap Tap Revenge game and its groundbreaking new release Riddim Ribbon.\n\nTapulous will also roll out an in-game Warner Music Group Channel featuring WMG’s music catalog and premium games. To date, Tapulous has sold more than five million songs in its store, and each week users download a half million copies of the Tapulous featured track.\n\nTapulous struck a similar deal with Universal Music Group earlier this year.\n\nRelated stories:\n\n– Kings Of Leon Take ‘Revenge’ On iPhone Gamers\n\n– UMG Pushes More Aggressive App Strategy\n\n– The App Kings"
