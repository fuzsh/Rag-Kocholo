        "text": "Disney Interactive Studios, Inc. (initially Walt Disney Computer Software, later Disney Interactive and Buena Vista Games, Inc.) was a worldwide American video game company. It self-published and distributed multi-platform video games and interactive entertainment worldwide.\n\nHistory[]\n\nDisney Interactive[]\n\nIn its early period, Disney Interactive often worked as a developer rather than a publisher (though it also marketed games on its own for select platforms), establishing development/publishing alliances with interactive-gaming industry leaders, such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo, Activision, Capcom (the most allianced), Konami, Square-Enix, and Ubisoft. Disney Interactive dealt with mass-market, global development, publishing, and distribution of interactive entertainment software based on its intellectual property (including Disney characters and other franchises).\n\nIn 2000, Disney Interactive formed a separate publishing subsidiary - Buena Vista Interactive. Buena Vista Interactive developed titles across multiple platforms for creative content from the businesses within The Walt Disney Company.\n\nBuena Vista Games (2003-2007)[]\n\nTo diversify its portfolio, the company re-established itself as Buena Vista Games in 2003. Retaining the Disney Interactive and Buena Vista Interactive names as publishing labels. In 2005, all titles were released under the Buena Vista Games label, no matter what type of game it was.\n\nDisney Interactive Studios (2007-2016)[]\n\nIn 2007, the Walt Disney Company re-merged its productions under the name Disney Interactive Studios. The studio publishes both Disney and non-Disney branded video games for all platforms worldwide, with titles that feature its consumer brands including Disney, ABC, ESPN, Touchstone (which is used as a label for Disney Interactive), and Disney/Pixar. The studio has selectively licensed Disney intellectual property to other video game publishers such as Activision and THQ. In June 2008, Disney Interactive Studios was spun off of Disney Consumer Products and taken up under the new division Disney Interactive Media Group.\n\nExit from video game publishing[]\n\nOn May 10, 2016, following disappointing financial results for the year's second fiscal quarter, Disney announced that it would take a $147 million write-down to discontinue its self-publishing console games operations, ending Disney's involvement in the video game publishing industry after more than a decade. As a result of Disney's departure from video game publishing, Disney Infinity was announced discontinued, and INFINITY developer Avalanche Software closed. Disney Interactive Studios will license its intellectual property to third party developers under the new structure, rather than oversee their own games. The Kingdom Hearts franchise and the Star Wars video games from Electronic Arts were not affected by this reorganization.\n\nList of games[]\n\nMain article: List of Disney Interactive Studios titles\n\nDisney Interactive Studios has licensed and published many titles under their umbrella, mostly based on Disney properties.\n\nOn occasion, the company has published non-Disney titles, such examples include games from Q Entertainment worldwide except Asia: Lumines II, the sequel to the puzzle game for the PSP system; Lumines Plus, a new version of Lumines for the PlayStation 2; Every Extend Extra, a puzzle shooter; and a Disney Interactive Studios's Meteos: Disney Edition, the popular Meteos game for the Nintendo DS with Disney characters.\n\nThe company revealed a line-up of games at E3 2006, which include DIE's Turok, a re-imagining of the video game series of the same name, and Desperate Housewives: The Game, based on the hit television show.\n\nDisney Interactive Studios is credited in all entries to the Kingdom Hearts franchise, with the original release box art of each entry to the series having different logos and name of the company seeing as coincidently, the company is re-branded in between the releases.
