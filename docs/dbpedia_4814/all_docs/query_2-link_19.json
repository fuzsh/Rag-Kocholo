        "text": "This article is written from a\n\nReal World perspective.\n\nDisney Interactive Studios is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nIn its early period,[when?] Disney Interactive often worked as a developer rather than a publisher (though it also marketed games on its own for select platforms), establishing development/publishing alliances with interactive-gaming industry leaders such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo, Activision, Capcom (the most allianced), Konami, [[Square-Enix and Ubisoft. Disney Interactive dealt with mass-market, global development, publishing and distribution of interactive entertainment software based on its intellectual property (including Disney characters and other franchises).\n\nBuena Vista Games[]\n\nTo diversify its portfolio, the company re-established itself as Buena Vista Games and divided productions across two publishing labels -- Buena Vista Interactive developed titles across multiple platforms for creative content from the businesses within The Walt Disney Company, and Disney Interactive marketed and distributed children's entertainment and learning software. Buena Vista Games is probably best known for the Kingdom Hearts series along with Japanese developer Square Enix.\n\nDisney Interactive Studios[]\n\nIn 2007, The Walt Disney Company re-merged its productions under the name Disney Interactive Studios. The studio publishes both Disney and non-Disney branded video games for all platforms worldwide, with titles that feature its consumer brands including Disney, ABC, ESPN, Touchstone (which is used as a label for Disney Interactive), Disney/Pixar, and Square Enix. The studio has selectively licensed Disney intellectual property to other video game publishers such as Activision and THQ.\n\nIn June 2008 Disney Interactive Studios was spun off of Disney Consumer Products and taken up under the new division Disney Interactive Media Group.[1]\n\nList of games[]\n\nThe company also publishes games from Q Entertainment worldwide except Asia: Lumines II, the sequel to the puzzle game for the PSP system; Lumines Plus, a new version of Lumines for the PlayStation 2; Every Extend Extra, a puzzle shooter; and a Disney Interactive Studios' Meteos: Disney Edition, the popular Meteos game for the Nintendo DS with Disney characters.\n\nDisney Interactive Studios has also announced the formation of a new development studio Fall Line Studio dedicated to creating games exclusively for Nintendo consoles Wii and Nintendo DS. Fall Line Studio will operate as a sister studio to Avalanche Software, both companies being based out of Salt Lake City. The studio will focus on small-team projects using Disney's brand. Former general manager of Rainbow Studios Scott Novis has been chosen to serve as vice president and general manager of Fall Line Studio.\n\nDisney Interactive Studios has been a strong supporter of Nintendo platforms and is the number three publisher of Game Boy Advance titles in North America. And Fall Line marks the company's plan to cut back on outsourced game development and focus on internally developed software.\n\nThe company revealed a line up of games at E3 2006, which include DIE's Turok, a re-imagining of the video game series of the same name and Desperate Housewives: The Game, based on the hit television show.\n\nLive-action remake[]\n\n0-9[]\n\n101 Dalmatians Print Studio (TBA)\n\n101 Dalmatians: Escape from DeVil Manor (TBA)\n\n102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue (Published by Eidos Interactive) (TBA)\n\n102 Dalmatians Activity Center (TBA)\n\nA[]\n\nA Bug's Life (TBA) (Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Game Boy Color)\n\nDisney's Aladdin (TBA) (Sega Genesis)\n\nDisney's Aladdin - SIMS (TBA)\n\nAladdin Activity Center (2019) (Microsoft Windows, Macintosh)\n\nDisney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge (TBA)\n\nB[]\n\nBig Hero 6: Battle in the Bay (TBA) (Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS)(Published by GameMill Entertainment)\n\nBolt (TBA) (Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS)\n\nBrave: The Video Game (TBA) (Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS)\n\nBrother Bear (TBA) (Game Boy Advance)\n\nBuzz Lightyear of Star Command (TBA) (Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Dreamcast, Game Boy Color) (Published by Activision)\n\nC[]\n\nCars (TBA) (Published by THQ) (Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, Xbox, Wii, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PSP)\n\nCars 2 (TBA) (Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PSP)\n\nCars: Race-O-Rama (TBA) (Published by THQ) (Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS, PSP)\n\nCars Toon: Mater's Tall Tales (TBA) (Wii)\n\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010) (Nintendo DS)\n\nChicken Little (TBA) (Microsoft Windows, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance)\n\nChicken Little: Ace in Action (TBA) (Wii, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS)\n\nCoaster (1993)\n\nClub Penguin: Elite Penguin Force (TBA) (Nintendo DS)\n\nClub Penguin: Elite Penguin Force: Herbert's Revenge (TBA) (Nintendo DS)\n\nClub Penguin:Game Day!
