        "text": "Gameplay[]\n\nThe game features a series of notes falling down the screen of the Android, iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. It is similar in gameplay to Guitar Hero and Rock Band, and is controlled via touching the notes on the Android/iPhone/iPod Touch's touch screen, or shaking the device left, right, or back when an arrow is displayed. There are four difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extreme. It has basic songs at the start when you download the app. The basic songs at the start are \"Sing\" by My Chemical Romance, \"House Music\" by Benny Benassi and \"Waiting for the End\" by Linkin Park.\n\nTap Tap Revenge 4 retains many of the actions that can be performed in Tap Tap Revenge 3. These include but are not limited to: fully customizable avatars, online group chat and private messaging, online battles, brand new free track every week and a character leveling system.\n\n[edit]New features[]\n\nIn Tap Tap Revenge 4, a variety of new features were introduced such as Arcade Mode and Retina Display Capability.\n\nTapulous has included new global leaderboards with up-to-the-minute scores. They also redesigned the interface."
