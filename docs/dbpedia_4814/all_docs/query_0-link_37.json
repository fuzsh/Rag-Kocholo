        "text": "TechCrunch is reporting that Disney has acquired Tapulous, the makers of popular iPhone game Tap Tap Revenge. Very few details are given around this news or its source, but the publication says Tapulous founder Bart Decrem, who will join Disney as a VP.\n\n\"We have over 30 million users and have been #1 on the App Store 5 times over, with Tap Tap Revenge 3 at #1 for 20 straight days,\" Tapulous boasts on its about page. \"In February of 2010 we debuted Riddim Ribbon, a ground-breaking music racing game co-produced with will.i.am. Riddim Ribbon became the #1 grossing app on the App Store within 3 days after launch.\"\n\nRecently the company announced a partnership with Warner Music Group, which includes labels like Atlantic, Reprise, Roadrunner, and Warner Bros. The company made headlines earlier this week when it launched a Nickelback-themed game.\n\nI imagine the Disney-related details will be available soon, provided the news is accurate. Erick Schonfeld promises more soon.\n\nUpdate: Mashable says it has confirmed the news, though still does not name sources. Ben Parr does give more alleged detials, however. These include Tapulous staying put in Palo Alto and Decrem and COO Andrew Lacy becoming Senior VPs , and reporting directly to Disney Interactive President Steve Wadsworth."
