        "text": "Matt Haughey:\n\nI have a feeling that if you’ve only seen blogs in the past five years (which is probably 95+ percent of people reading blogs today) you consider comments to be de rigueur and they are entirely divorced from the original concept of a conversation between the reader and the author of the original post. It’s not an intimate conversation, it’s just another content management feature available to you on the web.\n\nDrobo ★\n\nMy thanks to Data Robotics for sponsoring this week’s Daring Fireball RSS feed. Their original Drobo was a terrific and innovative storage device. Their new second-generation Drobo, with FireWire 800, is even better. Drobo features data redundancy, instant expansion to more storage, and plug-and-play ease of use. For more info, here’s Macworld’s 4.5-mouse review of the original Drobo.\n\nMad Men Gets All the Details Right — Except One ★\n\nAndrew Hearst on the art direction of Mad Men:\n\nThe art direction is so immersive that there are no clangy wrong notes to distract you from the rich psychological world the characters inhabit.\n\nUntil the show ends, that is. When the last frame flickers off the screen and the credits start to roll, careful observers — okay, just the font freaks — will notice a curious thing: The end credits are set not in the iconic sans serif used in the opening-credits sequence, and not in, say, Helvetica, which was designed in 1957 and became popular soon thereafter, but in Arial, the controversial Helvetica knockoff that Monotype cobbled together in the late 1980s to avoid paying license fees on Helvetica.\n\nNow That’s Gratitude ★\n\nThe page is in Dutch, but DF reader Rene Brouwer sent the following translation:\n\n27 year old Frisian developer Eric Wijngaard won $275,000 in Google’s Android Developer Challenge for his ‘PicSay’ application.\n\nIn an interview with a Dutch website he says he likes Google’s SDK but “What I really wanted to do was develop an iPhone app. The iPhone SDK wasn’t out yet, though.”\n\nAsked what he would do with the cash, his response was “I guess I could invest it in my software company, but first I want to port PicSay to the iPhone.”\n\nHere’s a Google translation of the whole article.\n\nUpdate: Wijngaard objects to the above translation.\n\nAndroid Market ★\n\nEric Chu:\n\nDevelopers will be able to make their content available on an open service hosted by Google that features a feedback and rating system similar to YouTube. We chose the term “market” rather than “store” because we feel that developers should have an open and unobstructed environment to make their content available. Similar to YouTube, content can debut in the marketplace after only three simple steps: register as a merchant, upload and describe your content and publish it. We also intend to provide developers with a useful dashboard and analytics to help drive their business and ultimately improve their offerings.\n\nI have a tangentially related question. I wonder whether anyone is planning to create an iPod Touch-like Android device? Something without the phone features but with Wi-Fi.\n\nRed 3K Scarlet ★\n\nUpcoming (“early 2009”) prosumer-range camera from Red. Sign me up. (Via Uncrate.)\n\nApple Adds ‘Blocks’ to Clang ★\n\nChris Lattner, who manages the Clang, LLVM, and GCC groups at Apple, announces Blocks support for Clang. Blocks are, more or less, closures for C and Objective-C — and Clang, the C language front-end for LLVM, will soon be Apple’s replacement for GCC.\n\nAndroid Developer Challenge Gallery ★\n\nGenerous cash prizes — 10 developers were awarded $275,000; another 10 got $100,000. Most of the apps look interesting, but I can’t say any of them really jumps out to me.\n\nUpdate: Not much visual consistency in the UIs, either. This gets back to the iPhone having no SDK until March, and the App Store not debuting until a year after the original iPhone. By the time the SDK arrived, developers had a sense of what an iPhone app should look and feel like. With these initial Android apps, developers created apps without ever being able to use them on an actual phone.\n\nInstant Messaging Market Share by Country ★\n\nInteresting data. AIM leads in the U.S., but not by much. MSN and Yahoo lead in most of the rest of the world.\n\nAdam Engst on BBEdit 9 ★\n\nAdam Engst:\n\nAnother related feature that has changed significantly, and for the better, is BBEdit’s Find Differences. In BBEdit 8.5, Bare Bones added the capability to display which characters within a line were different between two similar files. That was huge for us, since it enabled us to use BBEdit in conjunction with the Subversion version control system to work with TidBITS articles. Though code may have relatively short lines, a line of prose is a paragraph, and without knowing what within a paragraph has changed, knowing only that two paragraphs are not the same isn’t particularly helpful. In BBEdit 9.0, Bare Bones has enhanced the Find Differences feature such that it not only shows the changed lines, and the changed characters within each line, it also lets you see and replace individual spans of differing characters within each changed line.\n\nThis, along with the live word count and auto-completion that ties into the system-wide dictionary, makes BBEdit an even better tool for prose than before.\n\nMichael Tsai on BBEdit 9 ★\n\nI forgot to mention the new non-modal Find dialog in my blurb yesterday.\n\nSome Quick Comparisons Between the New Kodak Zi6 and the Flip Ultra ★\n\nI got my Kodak Zi6 last week, and have been shooting footage side-by-side with my Flip Ultra. Here are two examples I’ve posted to Vimeo. Be sure to turn on the HD option for the clips from the Zi6. More soon.\n\nChase Jarvis: Advance Testing the Nikon D90 ★\n\nSpeaking of amazing cameras, the upcoming Nikon D90 DSLR shoots video. Video, I say, with all the exposure and depth-of-field control of an SLR camera. Should sell for around $1300.\n\nI’m not aware of any other SLR that shoots video, included the just-released and similarly-priced Canon EOS 50D.\n\nPCalc for iPhone 1.0.2 ★\n\nMy favorite App Store app keeps getting better. New in version 1.0.2 is a very nifty multiple-undo implementation — just swipe the numeric display to go back one level in the undo stack. (In addition to being a better calculator than Apple’s, PCalc is a full-fledged unit calculator too.)\n\niPhone Password Lock Can Be Bypassed With Double-Tap of Home Button ★\n\nThe worst part is Apple fixed this months ago for the 1.1 OS.\n\nRed Digital Cinema ★\n\nTerrific profile in Wired by Michael Behar on Red Digital Cinema. Founded and led by Oakley founder Jim Jannard, their Red One movie camera is, dollar-for-dollar, the best and most amazing camera in the world. It sells for $17,500 — but if you think that sounds expensive, consider that the equivalent film camera rents for $25,000 per month, not including the (very expensive) cost of film.\n\nThe most amazing part is that the core technology didn’t come from a company like Canon or Sony — Red created it themselves.\n\nSocial Networks: The Case for a ‘Pause’ Button ★\n\nMerlin Mann on FriendFeed’s “fake follow” feature.\n\n‘All the Parts’ ★\n\niPhone commercial banned in the U.K. for claiming “all the parts of the Internet are on the iPhone”. Flash and Java are cited as exceptions.\n\nAnother iPhone SSH Client Comparison ★\n\nIncluding a brief look at a fourth SSH client in the App Store, the plainly-named “SSH”.\n\nWhat Makes for a Good Blog? ★\n\nPretty good list from Merlin Mann.\n\nAin’t That the Truth? ★\n\nNedra Pickler, reporting for the AP on McCain’s vice presidential selection (emphasis added):\n\nHis top contenders are said to include Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Less traditional choices mentioned include former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, an abortion-rights supporter, and Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent.\n\n(Via Atrios.)\n\nThings Touch 1.1 ★\n\nCultured Code’s $10 iPhone task manager now syncs with the Mac version of Things via Wi-Fi.\n\nComparing Apple’s MobileMe Contrition With Google and Netflix ★\n\nAdam Engst nails it:\n\nBoth MobileMe Mail and Google’s Gmail went down on 11-Aug-08 for a few hours. Apple’s recent email doesn’t mention that outage as part of the rocky transition, and the only acknowledgment I could find of it was a pair of entries in the MobileMe System Status page (bookmark this page, folks!). There was no mention of the outage on the semi-anonymous MobileMe Status blog at all, with the most recent posting being from 29-Jul-08, claiming that lost email had been restored and promising (but not delivering) another post later in the week.\n\nGoogle, in contrast, quickly posted a highly apologetic message on the Official Gmail Blog titled “We feel your pain, and we’re sorry.” It outlines in reasonable detail what went wrong, why it happened, and what Google is doing to prevent the problem in the future. I don’t know if Google offered paying subscribers for Google Apps for Domains Premier Edition (who are guaranteed 99.9 percent uptime) a credit, but since Gmail is free to most users, an apology is mostly what’s warranted.\n\nThe kicker is that the MobileMe Status blog was in fact updated today, but only to state that the blog will no longer be updated. Apple’s biggest problem isn’t with its product quality (which, overall, remains very high), but with its communication to customers. The insulting “Bug fixes” release notes for the 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 iPhone OS updates are another example.\n\nThree iPhone SSH Clients Reviewed ★\n\nBen Gross reviews iSSH, pTerm, and TouchTerm.\n\nBlockbuster CEO ‘Confused by This Fascination That Everybody Has With Netflix’ ★\n\nHow does Jim Keyes still have the job as CEO? Netflix is kicking his company’s ass and he thinks Netflix is the company that’s doing it wrong:\n\nEqually bewildering to Mr. Keyes is the emphasis on catalog size. Why would anyone want to watch anything other than new releases, he wonders.\n\n“I don’t care how many movies are available to me. As my personal taste as a customer, I want to watch the new stuff so whether we have 10,000 movies or 200 movies doesn’t matter if I don’t want to see any of the movies that we have … our assortment is heavily weighted toward newer releases and mainstream staple titles.”\n\n‘Flailing’, Eh? ★\n\nMike Arrington, extrapolating from his own personal experience with some apparent lemon MacBooks:\n\nThey need to get their house in order or they risk alienating all these new customers they’ve added over the last few years. The new buyers aren’t Apple fanatics and won’t sit quietly as they try to access broken services via failing hardware.\n\nLet’s see what the just-released 2008 American Customer Satisfaction Index says:\n\nApple Inc. trounced rival computer makers selling Windows-equipped PCs by historic margins in an annual customer satisfaction survey, the poll’s chief researcher said today.\n\n“We haven’t seen anything like this before, where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival,” said Claes Fornell, the head of the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), conducted quarterly by the University of Michigan.\n\nApple’s customer satisfaction score of 85, an ACSI record in the personal computer category, was 10 points higher than the closest competitor, Dell Inc.; 12 points higher than Hewlett-Packard Co.; and 13 higher than Gateway, which was acquired by Acer last year.\n\nIs Apple perfect? No. Does it suck when you buy a new Mac that doesn’t work right? Yes. But is Apple doing a far better job than any of its competitors? Yes.\n\nA heads-up to anyone considering sponsoring the DF RSS feed: summer’s sold out and fall is selling fast. There are only five unsold weeks for the remainder of 2008. If you have a product or service you’d like to promote to the DF audience, get in touch.\n\nApple Offers Additional 60-Day MobileMe Extension ★\n\nThis is in addition to the previous 30-day extension. At this rate, they’re either going to fix it or we’ll never have to pay again.\n\nI wonder how many MobileMe customers there are? If there are a million — and I’m pretty sure they hit the million-customer mark a few years ago — then three free months of service costs Apple at least $25 million.\n\nTim O’Reilly:\n\nAt the time, I noted the way that more and more information that was once delivered by independent web sites was now being delivered directly by search engines, and that rather than linking out to others, there were strong signs of a trend towards keeping the link flow to themselves.\n\nThis thought re-surfaced when TechCrunch launched CrunchBase. Now, rather than linking directly to companies covered in its stories, TechCrunch links to one of its own properties to provide additional information about them. I noticed the same behavior the other day on the New York Times, when I followed a link, and was taken to a search result for articles on the subject at the Times (with lots of ads, even if there were few results).\n\nThis is the natural tendency for any site using an ad model where page views are directly correlated to revenue. This is why news sites break up stories over multiple pages, too. It’s a crummy practice, and in the long run, sites that succumb to this temptation are doing so at the expense of their credibility. Readers learn, remember, and resent when links on a certain site tend to be a waste of their time.\n\niPhone OS 2.0.2 ★\n\nEntire release notes: “Bug fixes.”\n\n‘Someone Is Clearly Doing Their Job Horribly Wrong’ ★\n\nXkcd on the recent news that Premier Election Solutions (née Diebold) is blaming Windows anti-virus software for their voting machines “dropping votes” in Ohio.\n\nMobileMe and (Lack of) Encryption ★\n\nThomas Robinson on the lack of SSL support in MobileMe’s web apps.\n\nMost Wine Should Be Sold in Boxes ★\n\nTyler Colman, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nA standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and generates about 5.2 pounds of carbon-dioxide emissions when it travels from a vineyard in California to a store in New York. A 3-liter box generates about half the emissions per 750 milliliters. Switching to wine in a box for the 97 percent of wines that are made to be consumed within a year would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about two million tons, or the equivalent of retiring 400,000 cars.[…]\n\nWhat’s more, boxed wine is superior to glass bottle storage in resolving that age-old problem of not being able to finish a bottle in one sitting. Once open, a box preserves wine for about four weeks compared with only a day or two for a bottle. Boxed wine may be short on charm, but it is long on practicality.\n\nVia Atrios, who notes that the problem with most boxed wine in the U.S. today is that it’s crap wine.\n\nDell Denied Trademark for ‘Cloud Computing’ ★\n\nSam Johnston on a decision by the USPTO to deny Dell a trademark for the term “cloud computing”:\n\nFurthermore, they have declared “cloud computing” generic, in that it is “incapable of functioning as a source-identifier for applicant’s services”. This makes sense given that few of us think “Dell” when we think of “cloud computing”, even in this context.\n\nI’d say no one thinks of Dell when thinking about “cloud computing”, except for their silly trademark application for the term.\n\n1 in 3 Business PCs Drop Vista for Windows XP ★\n\nThey just haven’t realized yet how awesome Vista really is.\n\nJens Alfke on MobileMe Web App Security ★\n\nJens Alfke, regarding the security of Apple’s MobileMe web apps:\n\nThe most glaring problem is that, since the main page resource (HTML and JavaScript) aren’t loaded over SSL, there’s no way to tell whether they’re genuine. By now everyone ought to be aware of DNS forgery attacks; if the coffeeshop where you’ve gone online has an infected WiFi router, it would be nice to know whether its DNS record for “me.com” points to Apple’s servers or to a phishing site. But without SSL there’s no way to tell. Obviously, if you’ve loaded a hacked forgery of me.com’s web-app, any assurances made about “authenticated handling of JSON exchanges” are completely pointless, because your JSON exchanges are probably going straight to a pwned server in Uzbekistan.\n\nWhen Apple’s Reach Exceeds Its Grasp ★\n\nI hate to pick nits in an otherwise insightful article, but I think Jason Snell overemphasizes the importance of Apple’s “size” in this piece.\n\nWhen the iPhone first shipped, developers immediately began clamoring for a system that would allow them to write programs for it. Apple had no doubt been planning for such a system from the earliest days of iPhone development. But the company didn’t unveil it until March 2008.\n\nI don’t think being bigger, whether in terms of employee head count or in terms of cash on hand, could have made the iPhone SDK appear significantly sooner. Most companies that are bigger than Apple tend to move slower, not faster. I don’t think the lesson to be learned from July 11 is that Apple needs to get bigger, but rather that they need to ease off slightly on the accelerator.\n\nAlthough when you do compare employee head counts between Microsoft (91,000) and Apple (21,000), it’s essential to note that at least half of Apple’s employees work in its retail stores. (And, also — who am I kidding? — I love to pick nits in otherwise insightful articles.)\n\nApple’s Market Cap Passes Google’s ★\n\nStill $100 billion short of the big one, though.\n\nOn the Intertwinement of Design and Engineering ★\n\nJack Shedd, “The Great Divide”:\n\nThe idea of there being these two separate things has to be forced away from our thinking. They are one team, which produce one product.\n\nMac OS X Tip: Text Field Auto-Completion ★\n\nThis is one of those great tips that I suspect many Mac users don’t know about. The unmodified Esc key works in most contexts, too.\n\nThe History of Predictive Text Swearing ★\n\nPerhaps this explains why the iPhone OS 2.0 now auto-corrects “fucking” to “ducking”.\n\nThe Curious Job of Kevin Cornell ★\n\nKevin Cornell on his work as the illustrator for a graphic novel adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Looks gorgeous. The hardcover is available now for pre-order through Amazon.\n\nRolling Stone Switching to a Smaller, Rack-Friendly Size ★\n\nUnderstandable, but a bit sad nonetheless. The large format is definitely part of Rolling Stone’s brand. But don’t give me this bunk about the new size being “advertiser-friendly” — this is about printing and shipping costs, the same reason why newspapers have gotten so small.\n\nBest Buy to Start Selling iPhones in September ★\n\nThe Associated Press:\n\nBest Buy Co. will start selling the iPhone on Sept. 7, becoming the first U.S. chain to do so outside of Apple Inc.’s and AT&T Inc.’s own stores.\n\n(Why does the AP use those “Co.” and “Inc.” abbreviations? The sentence would read so much cleaner without them.)\n\nBecause They’re Spiteful Small-Minded Idiots Who Hate Their Own Customers ★\n\nThe number two item in PC World’s “11 Things We Hate About iTunes” list is “DRM (Boo!)”:\n\niTunes gave us the 99-cent song download, thus paving the way for honest people to buy music at a fair price. So why does the iTunes Store still employ digital rights management (DRM) for the majority of songs in its library? Blaming the record labels no longer holds water: AmazonMP3 and Rhapsody are among a growing number of services selling DRM-free MP3s from all the major labels, not just EMI. At least iTunes no longer charges extra for the latter’s “iTunes Plus” selections, but why hasn’t Apple given DRM the heave-ho once and for all?\n\nBecause the music labels (other than EMI) won’t let them.\n\nPirating the Olympics, Then and Now ★\n\nAndy Baio:\n\nBack in 2004, the place to go for illegal Olympic videos wasn’t BitTorrent, popular trackers like Suprnova, or mainstream P2P clients. The best coverage, surprisingly, was found in the old-school Usenet binaries. It was a mish-mash of events, skewed heavily towards events with bikini-clad women, Brazilians, or bikini-clad Brazilian women, but other popular events and the opening ceremonies also showed up.\n\niPhone-Optimized Google Translate ★\n\nTerrific web site for the iPhone.\n\nKottke’s Jakob Nielsen Winamp Skin ★\n\nStill funny, eight years later. (Thanks to Dave Miller.)\n\nSteve Jobs on ‘Concept Cars’ ★\n\nSpeaking of Apple and “concept designs”, here’s an apt bit from Lev Grossman’s 2005 “How Apple Does It” profile for Time magazine:\n\nAsk Apple CEO Steve Jobs about it, and he’ll tell you an instructive little story. Call it the Parable of the Concept Car. “Here’s what you find at a lot of companies,” he says, kicking back in a conference room at Apple’s gleaming white Silicon Valley headquarters, which looks something like a cross between an Ivy League university and an iPod. “You know how you see a show car, and it’s really cool, and then four years later you see the production car, and it sucks? And you go, What happened? They had it! They had it in the palm of their hands! They grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory!\n\n“What happened was, the designers came up with this really great idea. Then they take it to the engineers, and the engineers go, ‘Nah, we can’t do that. That’s impossible.’ And so it gets a lot worse. Then they take it to the manufacturing people, and they go, ‘We can’t build that!’ And it gets a lot worse.”\n\n(Thanks to Scott Stevenson.)\n\nWhy Apple Doesn’t Do ‘Concept Products’ ★\n\nBrilliant essay by Kontra at Counternotions:\n\nWhy hasn’t Apple, the most innovative and visionary company in computing, produced a single concept product or vision in over a decade? Because, to paraphrase Jobs, real artists ship.\n\nHank Williams: UI Guru Jakob Nielsen’s Site Is Unreadable ★\n\nThe conventional wisdom on Jakob Nielsen and useit.com has always been something along the lines of, Sure, his site is ugly, but his advice is great. I’ll just come out and say it: I think Jakob Nielsen’s advice tends to be trite. And his writing style never comes across as actual prose; rather than feeling like reading an essay, reading Jakob Nielsen always feels like reading a summary of an essay.\n\nAnd then there are the people who declare that useit.com is in fact brilliantly designed, and that those who criticize it as ugly or cluttered or childish just don’t see how brilliant it really is.\n\nThe Onion Weighs In ★\n\nInsightful as ever.\n\nLaunchpad Chicken ★\n\nJean-Louis Gassée on the MobileMe launch:\n\nSimple is hard. Easy is harder. Invisible is hardest.\n\nGary Krakow, Jackass or Just Stupid? ★\n\nThis piece by TheStreet.com’s Gary Krakow is so jacktastic it’s hard to know where to start. (See also: this not-jacktastic-but-still-wrongheaded piece by Tom Yager, upon which Krakow’s “analysis” is based.)\n\nWhat I wrote in October still stands: unsupported means “not supported”. Jailbreaking has never been supported, and has only worked because of bugs in the iPhone software that have been exploited. When Apple fixes those bugs, they’re not taking anything away that they had previously allowed.\n\nGroup and Organize Your iTunes Sales Stats ★\n\nOf possible interest to iPhone developers: Jonathan Johnson has written a Python script to parse the sales data from the App Store:\n\nIntroducing appstats.py, a simple script that scans its own directory looking for daily dumps from the iTunes store. It will then gather all the statistics and output several reports in a tab delimited format that Numbers (and I’m sure Excel) can read. It makes it a couple clicks to get a great graph for your data.\n\nChuq Von Rospach on MobileMe ★\n\nUnlike everyone else who’s commenting on MobileMe and Apple’s ability to do large-scale web infrastructure, Von Rospach speaks from experience inside Apple.\n\nThe $1000 iPhone App ★\n\nKottke makes the case for “I Am Rich”, the $1000 do-nothing iPhone App:\n\nExcluding I Am Rich would be excluding for taste…because some feel that it costs too much for what it does. (And this isn’t the only example. There have been many cries of too many poor quality (but otherwise functional) apps in the store and that Apple should address the problem.) App Store shoppers should get to make the choice of whether or not to buy an iPhone app, not Apple, particularly since the App Store is the only way to legitimately purchase consumer iPhone apps. Imagine if Apple chose which music they stocked in the iTunes store based on the company’s taste.\n\nBut on the flip side, here’s a screenshot of a comment from I Am Rich’s App Store page, from someone who claims to have purchased and been charged for the app accidentally. If everyone who “buys” this app is then demanding a refund or credit card chargeback, you can see why Apple, or perhaps its author, Armin Heinrich, would take the app down. And what makes me think it was Heinrich, not Apple, who pulled the app is that with the App Store, developers pay the refund fee. It’s entirely possible that Mr. Heinrich is already on the hook for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars in refund fees.\n\nDerek Sivers: ‘Ideas Are Just a Multiplier of Execution’ ★\n\nI love this short piece by Derek Sivers from back in 2005:\n\nTo me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.\n\nUsing OpenDNS for Phishing Protection ★\n\nRob Griffiths:\n\nConsumer Reports touted Firefox or Opera over Safari because of the built-in anti-phishing tools in those first two browsers; Safari has no such built-in capability. There is, however, a free service you can use that will give every browser on your Mac a full set of anti-phishing tools (and additional tools, if you choose to use them). This service is called OpenDNS, and it’s a free replacement for your Internet service provider’s (ISP) domain name servers.\n\nThe other thing about OpenDNS is that it is fast, fast, fast — for me, it makes web surfing noticeably faster than using the default DNS servers I get from Comcast. I was on the other side of the fence about OpenDNS’s “DNS+” a few months ago, but I’ve come around again.\n\nApple’s Ability to Deactivate Malicious App Store Apps ★\n\nJonathan Zdziarski claims to have identified the URL of a blacklist Apple has created in case it needs to remotely disable an app distributed through the App Store.\n\nScott McNulty Joins MacUser ★\n\nEver notice how good writers leave TUAW for other weblogs, but never the other way around?\n\nMicrosoft Misses Windows Mobile Sales Target ★\n\nGood post from Paul Thurrott on the news that Microsoft, after proclaiming several times over the last year that it would sell “more than 20 million” Windows Mobile licenses in fiscal year 2008, missed the mark by over 2 million, and is now trying to spin it as no big deal.\n\nIf, say, Apple were to fall short by 10 percent on its prediction of 10 million iPhones sold in calendar 2008, somehow I’m guessing it’d be considered a big deal.\n\nThe Lightroom vs. Aperture Plugin Situation ★\n\nJohn Nack:\n\nPound for pound & click for click, “external editor presets” in Lightroom 2 and “plug-ins” in Aperture are the same thing. In both cases you pick the external engine that you want to use on your image; jump into that editing environment to make adjustments; and return to your LR/Aperture library with an edited bitmap image that sits alongside your original raw file. You get the same results with the same number of clicks.\n\nI upgraded to Lightroom 2 last week, and I’ve only had time to scratch the surface with regard to learning what’s new. But so far, every single change that I’ve noticed has been for the better. It’s a remarkable improvement over what was already one of my favorite pieces of software ever.\n\nThe Ampersand ★\n\nNow this is a focused weblog. (Via Bryan Bedell.)\n\nThe Talk Show, Ep. 25 ★\n\nNew episode of America’s favorite podcast; this week’s topics include the upcoming Kodak Zi6, NetShare, the 2.0.1 update to the iPhone OS, and our new Talk Show Call-In Hotline. I don’t know if it’s a good episode, but the ending is great.\n\nFrom the DF Archives: Ronco Spray-on Usability ★\n\nThanks to a link at the end of Matthew Paul Thomas’s free software usability piece and subsequent discussion on Slashdot, etc., this piece I wrote four years ago is the most popular article on DF this week. Holds up pretty well.\n\nAT&T’s iPhone Data Plan Terms and Conditions Forbid Tethering ★\n\nFrom AT&T’s iPhone Terms and Conditions:\n\nFurthermore, unlimited plans (except for DataConnect and BlackBerry tethered) cannot be used for any applications that tether the device (through use of, including without limitation, connection kits, other phone/PDA-to-computer accessories, Bluetooth or any other wireless technology) to laptops, PCs, or other equipment for any purpose.\n\nThe question is whether Apple is obligated to enforce this.\n\nWSJ Backtracking From Sketchy ‘Beanpole’ Obama Story ★\n\nThe Wall Street Journal ran the following “correction” for that shoddy “Is Obama Too Fit to Be President?” story from a few days ago:\n\nA Weekend Journal article Friday about Barack Obama’s weight included a quote from a Yahoo bulletin board that was posted in response to a question from a Wall Street Journal reporter who initiated the discussion. The article should have disclosed that the reporter used the bulletin board to elicit the comment, “I won’t vote for any beanpole guy.”\n\nIt’s not so much a correction as it is an admission that the story never should have run.\n\nOm Malik on MobileMe’s Infrastructure ★\n\nOm Malik:\n\nOne of my sources opined that Apple clearly wasn’t too savvy about all the progress made in infrastructure over the past few years. If this insinuation is indeed true, then there is no way Apple can get over its current spate of problems. It needs a crash course in infrastructure and Internet services. Apple’s problem is that it doesn’t seem to have recognized the fact that it’s in the business of network-enabled hardware.\n\nBut the iTunes Store does gangbuster traffic and has a terrific track record for uptime. The message I read from yesterday’s reorg that put MobileMe under Eddy Cue (Apple’s VP for iTunes) is that MobileMe could and should be as responsive and reliable as the iTunes Store.\n\nThrowing the Baby Out With the Bath Water ★\n\nRene Ritchie reviews MagicPad, the $4 iPhone notes app that offers text selection, styled text, and copy/paste, and gives it a rating of 4.5 out of 5. Here’s his list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\nWorking cut, copy, and paste on the iPhone, come on!\n\nRich text styling\n\nDid I mention CUT and PASTE\n\nCons\n\nNo auto-correction for spelling\n\nUses 3rd party email server\n\nI bought and have been testing MagicPad for the last few days, and I’d pretty much create the same list of pros and cons. But for a rating, I’d assign it a zero. Without auto-correction, the app is utterly useless. Half the words I type are misspelled, some beyond recognition. It’s an interesting test of how important the iPhone’s auto-correction is in making its on-screen keyboard usable. The answer is “utterly essential”.\n\nThe text selection UI works pretty well and copy/paste is nice to have, but you still can’t copy/paste between different applications. So you can change the font and text size, but you can’t actually type.\n\nNetShare Coming Back to App Store? ★\n\nNullriver:\n\nWe’ve finally gotten in contact with Apple. Looks like the lack of communication was due to automated e-mail systems being employed on both ends, which resulted in e-mails being lost in transit. We’re working with Apple to get NetShare back up on the AppStore.\n\nThe NPD Group: iTunes Continues to Lead U.S. Music Retailers ★\n\nThe only two download stores that matter are iTunes and Amazon. And CD stores are mattering less and less.\n\nUpdate: From the description of the methodology used to compile the list: “NPD only tracks digital music sold by the song or album, not music purchased under subscription from services like eMusic, or subscription revenues from Rhapsody and Napster.” Thanks to reader Eduardo Leoni for catching this.\n\nLarrabee: Intel’s Biggest Leap Since the Pentium Pro ★\n\nJon Stokes on “Larrabee”, Intel’s forthcoming big-deal new product:\n\nIndeed, if a computer maker who controls the whole OS and firmware stack for its desktop systems were to support symmetric multiprocessing over the PCIe bus, and if that computer maker had some kind of cooperative task system that let it assign threads to specific cores, then it could probably make very good use of Larrabee as a many-core x86 coprocessor with robust media processing capabilities.\n\nIt seems likely we’re going to be hearing a lot more about Larrabee soon.\n\nMobileMe Reorg ★\n\nThe clusterfuck that has been the first month of MobileMe — a botched launch, permanently lost email messages, and syncing features that sometimes don’t sync — has resulted in the inevitable: a reorg. “Reorg” being Apple-speak for “this shit had better change”.\n\nIn a company-wide email, Steve Jobs today announced that Eddy Cue, whose former title was Vice President of iTunes, has taken on what I believe to be the new title of Vice President of Internet Services, overseeing both the iTunes Store and MobileMe. Jobs:\n\nIt was a mistake to launch MobileMe at the same time as iPhone 3G, iPhone 2.0 software and the App Store. We all had more than enough to do, and MobileMe could have been delayed without consequence.\n\nTap Tap Tap Reveals Last Week’s iPhone App Sales ★\n\nJohn Casasanta reveals Tap Tap Tap’s App Store sales from last week for Where To and Tipulator ($9,547 and $349, respectively, for a post-Apple take-home cut of $6,928), and has some good words regarding the efficacy of sponsoring the DF RSS feed.\n\nMore on the iPhone NDA ★\n\nA correspondent of Chuq Von Rospach suggests an interesting, and plausible, reason why Apple has not lifted the iPhone SDK NDA: because it prevents people who work at competitors from looking at it.\n\n‘Why Your Computer Is Running Slow’ ★\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed in the hour or so in which I’ve been running iPhone OS 2.0.1 is that the UI, system-wide, is snappier — typing, animations, launching apps. It feels like the 1.1 OS in this regard. Perhaps this old Spamusement comic from Steven Frank explains what changed with those unspecified “bug fixes”.\n\niPhone OS 2.0.1 ★\n\nIn the history of Apple’s crummy release notes, this one might take the cake:\n\nThis version of the software includes the following improvements and supercedes all previous versions.\n\nBug fixes\n\nOne can hope, given how many bugs there were in 2.0.0, that the full list of fixes is actually pretty long. I’m also hoping that Apple soon updates the “recent security updates” page I’m linking to with at least some of the specific changes in 2.0.1.\n\nDistorted for Readability ★\n\nInteresting parking garage signage designed by Axel Peemöller. (Thanks to DF reader Derek Matyas.)\n\nTidBITS on Security Update 2008-005 ★\n\nGlenn Fleishman and Adam Engst:\n\nTwenty-four days after the rest of the industry mobilized to patch a serious flaw in the domain name system (DNS) protocol that’s core to the functioning of the Internet, Apple has at long last released Security Update 2008-005, which includes its fix for the regular and server flavors of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and 10.5 Leopard. If 24 days doesn’t sound like a long time, note that Apple was notified privately on 05-May-08, nearly 3 months ago, and this is for a vulnerability with significant exposure that had the potential to be disastrous for Apple’s business and hosting customers, as amply described in an opinion piece for Macworld by Mac system administrator John Welch.\n\nToday’s issue of MDJ had this to say:\n\nIn the face of theoretical zero-day exploits, the question had remained: can Apple produce a zero-day patch if a real exploit shows up? Now we have the answer: no. The company’s deliberative and opaque security process can benefit customers by not rushing ill-considered patches out the door that might need subsequent patches a day or two later. Yet when a real zero-day exploit arrives, Apple has shown it has no mechanism for dealing with it.\n\nAmazon Rebates on Mac Hardware ★\n\nRebates between $50 and $150 for various MacBooks, and $200 on the Mac Pro. Use this link and I’ll get a juicy kickback from Amazon, which I’ll in turn almost certainly squander on something else from Apple.\n\nApple’s Lack of Candor ★\n\nMichael Tsai simply nails it.\n\nMike Ash: ‘Welcome to iPhone: Your Crappy Mac of Tomorrow, Today!’ ★\n\nMike Ash argues the other side:\n\nBut as they say, familiarity breeds contempt, and after using it more these past few weeks, I’ve come to realize that the iPhone platform is really pretty crappy in a lot of ways. And these ways are mostly not due to hardware limitations, but rather artificial limitations put in place by Apple. And mostly these are limitations which have been put in place For Our Own Protection, and which have been, shockingly, praised from many quarters.\n\nUpdate: The problem with Ash’s argument is that it all hangs on this:\n\nI am concerned that a lot of people have forgotten how resource constrained their once-powerful desktop systems of yesteryear were. 128 MB of RAM and a 600 MHz ARM is more than enough to run a modern mobile operating system, a music player, a chat client, and a web browser.\n\nThey might be enough to run a modern mobile OS, but they’re not enough to run the one that Apple has actually built. MobileSafari, by itself, can barely keep two typical pages in memory for me with iPhone OS 2.0. The number one complaint about the iPhone 3G is battery life — and battery life would be worse if third-party apps could run in the background.\n\nMatt Gemmell: ‘iPhone Developer Complaints’ ★\n\nMatt Gemmell:\n\nI’ll just never understand this magical thinking process; it seems that whenever we don’t get access to a juicy API, or when Apple uses a new type of window appearance that isn’t yet publicly available, or when something gets locked down so that we can get access to it at all, normally sane and rational people contract some kind of temporary freetard rabies.\n\nI think Gemmell is spot-on regarding the current limitations in the iPhone APIs, and whether it’s fair that Apple’s own software isn’t similarly limited. But I don’t see why he’s so sure that there’s a good reason behind the non-lifting of the NDA, or that it’ll be lifted any time soon. Game console development for Sony or Nintendo is under permanent NDA — I certainly hope that’s not what Apple plans for the iPhone, but I’ve seen no evidence that it’s not.\n\nRob Enderle Is a Hack ★\n\nDan Moren on the latest “column” from Rob Enderle, wherein Enderle is bullish on the prospects of Dell’s purported upcoming music player, but doesn’t mention that he was (is?) a paid consultant for Dell on the project.\n\nBlack Hat Talk on FileVault Encryption Flaw Pulled ★\n\nBrian Krebs:\n\nCharles Edge, a researcher from Georgia, had been slated to discuss his research on a weakness that could be used to defeat FileVault encryption on the Mac. But sometime last week, Black Hat organizers pulled his name and presentation listing from its schedule of talks.\n\nContacted via cell phone, Edge said he signed confidentiality agreements with Apple, which prevents him from speaking on the topic and from discussing the matter further.\n\nMe, Myself, and I ★\n\nCaroline Winter, subbing for the on-vacation William Safire:\n\nWhy do we capitalize the word “I”? There’s no grammatical reason for doing so, and oddly enough, the majuscule “I” appears only in English.\n\nMPT: ‘Why Free Software Has Poor Usability, and How to Improve It’ ★\n\nMatthew Paul Thomas is back with a thoughtful and detailed look at the reasons why open source software tends to suffer from poor user interfaces. But he’s dancing around the root problem, which is that of authority.\n\nI posit that the usability and elegance of any product, software or hardware, tends to reach and seldom surpasses the level that satisfies the taste of whoever is in charge of the product. This applies universally, not just to free and open source software. For example, it explains why Microsoft produces such crummy software even though the company employees thousands of talented programmers and even designers — Microsoft’s decision makers have no taste. But the problem is endemic to open source.\n\nThe people in charge of most free and open source software products tend to have poor taste in user interfaces; people with good taste in user interface design are seldom in charge of open source software projects.\n\nPut another way, if you have to ask for better design, you will lose. You need to be in a position to demand it.\n\nHard to Believe Some People Thought The Wall Street Journal Would Go to Hell After Rupert Murdoch Bought It ★\n\nThe Wall Street Journal ran a 1,400-word news article today addressing the issue of whether Barack Obama is “too physically fit” to be elected president. Reporter Amy Chozick’s source for this nonsense? An anonymous comment on a Yahoo message board thread that she herself started.\n\nI especially enjoy seeing a Wall Street Journal reporter sign off with a “Thanks!”.\n\nC4[2] ★\n\nWolf Rentzsch’s very fun, very smart Mac developer nerd conference is back for a third edition. The session line-up looks terrific. My understanding is that it’s already nearly sold-out, so I’d act quickly if I hadn’t registered already. Here’s my write-up from last year’s C4[1].\n\nUpdate: Sold out.\n\nThe Talk Show, Ep. 24 ★\n\nA half-hearted run through the last month worth of news, including the new iPhone and MobileMe.\n\nHoudahSpot 2 ★\n\nMy thanks to Houdah Software for sponsoring this week’s DF RSS feed. HoudahSpot 2.2 is a terrific search utility for Mac OS X. It uses Spotlight for the back-end, but provides its own interface for queries and results, which interface is better than Mac OS X’s built-in Spotlight interface in every single way. Complex queries are easier to build and more precise. Simple queries, using HoudahSpot’s new “Blitz Search” feature, feel much faster than with the Spotlight menu item, because HoudahSpot doesn’t mimic Apple’s asinine “start trying to show results after you’ve typed a single character” behavior.\n\nCheck out Houdah’s screencasts for more info on how it works. HoudahSpot costs €15 (US$23 at this moment), but DF readers can save 20 percent using the coupon code “DF2008”.\n\nNullriver NetShare ★\n\nThis story is downright bizarre. Nullriver — the company that spearheaded the Installer.app jailbreak installer project — created an App Store app called NetShare, which enables an iPhone to share its EDGE or 3G Internet connection with a Mac or PC via Wi-Fi. That seems like a crazy app to build, given that there’d seemingly be no chance that Apple would accept it. But Apple did accept it, and it appeared on the App Store yesterday, selling for $10, and it apparently works as advertised.\n\nSoon thereafter, though, NetShare disappeared from the store. Assuming that Apple does not wish to allow phone network tethering, it seems crazy that this app got through in the first place. The name alone — let alone the product description, or the fact that it came from the creators of Installer.app — makes it very clear what it does.\n\nUpdate: As of this moment, NetShare is back in the App Store. I just bought a license a moment ago, as did Andy Baio.\n\nFlip Ultra vs. Creative Vado ★\n\nYou know the picture quality of a camera is bad when it’s described as “not quite good enough for YouTube”.\n\nMcCain Makes Historic First Visit to Internet ★\n\nThe Borowitz Report:\n\nIn a daring bid to wrench attention from his Democratic rival in the 2008 presidential race, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) today embarked on an historic first-ever visit to the Internet.\n\nPerhaps the Name ‘Jongeorge’ Was Already Taken ★\n\nNeven Mrgan on the new Palringo multi-network IM app for the iPhone."
