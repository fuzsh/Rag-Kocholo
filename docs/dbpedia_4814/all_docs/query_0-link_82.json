        "text": "Sorry Folks, No Image Is Here.\n\nSource:link\n\nChristmas With Weezer: Six Exclusive Weezer Christmas Songs For iPhone and iPod touch from the Makers of Tap Tap Revenge\n\nLos Angeles, CA., – December 4, 2008 – Weezer, one of the most\n\noriginal and beloved bands around, and Tapulous, the leading iPhone\n\napplications developer, today announced Christmas With Weezer, an\n\noriginal game for the iPhone and iPod touch that will go on sale\n\nwithin the next few days. Featuring new music by Weezer, the game\n\ntakes full advantage of the innovative Multi-Touch\n\ncapabilities and accelerometer as players tap and shake their phones\n\nto the tunes of six classic Christmas songs covered by Weezer.\n\n“The guys here at Tapulous all love Weezer so we’re delighted to offer\n\nthis game on the Apple App Store just in time for the holidays,” said\n\nBart Decrem, Tapulous CEO. “Today’s announcement underscores how\n\nartists and record labels are realizing the value of this new platform\n\nfor distributing music to fans on the most exciting mobile devices on\n\nthe planet.”\n\n“I agreed to do these special recordings for the game because I am a\n\nfan of each of the songs. The melody and vocal lines are incredible\n\nand it was fun to sing them,” added Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo.\n\nChristmas With Weezer is built on the powerful next-generation engine\n\nof Tap Tap Revenge, the popular music game for iPhone and iPod touch,\n\nwhere users tap and shake their devices to the tunes of the music, but\n\nwith rich new features and a fun, family-friendly look to fit the\n\nholiday spirit. The music is funky but authentic, since Weezer kept\n\nthe original lyrics in these favorite Christmas songs. Weezer fans can\n\nhear the band performing six Christmas classics, including “We Wish\n\nYou A Merry Christmas”, “Silent Night”, “O Holy Night”, “First Noel”,\n\n“Hark The Herald Angels Sing” and “O Come, All Ye Faithful”, along\n\nwith two bonus tracks. The six Christmas cover tracks were recorded\n\nexclusively for this game, and are not available anywhere else.\n\n“I love my iPhone and all the apps that you can download,” said Weezer\n\ndrummer Pat Wilson. “I love that our band is the first to actually\n\nrecord songs specifically for an app and Tap Tap Revenge seemed like\n\nthe perfect one. I am excited to tap along to what we recorded and\n\nhope it brings holiday cheer to all kinds of different thumbs and\n\nfingers.”\n\nWeezer recently finished up a hugely successful and critically\n\nacclaimed North American tour in support of their sixth album Weezer\n\n(often referred as the Red Album). The band’s third eponymous album\n\nwhich the Chicago Sun Times lauded as “some of the most intricate\n\nsongwriting, since the band’s debut album,” has spawned the number one\n\nalternative radio hit “Pork and Beans” and “Troublemaker” which was\n\nnumber two at that format.\n\nChristmas With Weezer will be available worldwide for $4.99 from\n\nApple’s App Store on iPhone and iPod touch or at\n\nwww.itunes.com/appstore/ in the next few days.\n\nFor more information please visit www.tapulous.com"
