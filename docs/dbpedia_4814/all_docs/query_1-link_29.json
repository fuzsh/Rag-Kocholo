        "text": "(AP) -- Following the success of \"Tap Tap Metallica,\" Warner Music Group Corp. is opening up its roster of artists to be featured on other versions of the popular play-along iPhone game.\n\nArtists such as B.O.B., Neil Young and Paramore will be featured in songs that come in two-, four- and six-pack bundles from 99 cents to $1.99. The main version of the game, \"Tap Tap Revenge 3,\" is free.\n\nFour artists, who have yet to be announced, will be featured in premium versions that delve into their catalog of music and sell for $4.99 each over the next year.\n\nFor developer Tapulous Inc., which is based in Palo Alto, the deal with Warner rounds out agreements with all the major recording companies. It concluded deals with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and EMI Group Ltd. over the last year and a half.\n\n\"This is the icing on the cake,\" said Tim O'Brien, Tapulous' vice president of business development.\n\nWarner gets more exposure for its artists as well as getting a cut of game sales.\n\n\"Tap Tap Metallica\" has sold 150,000 units since being released in October, and remains among the top 10 music games on the iTunes store.\n\nMark Pinkus, senior vice president of worldwide licensing for Warner's catalog division, Rhino Entertainment, said an active listener makes for a more popular artist, and can spur further song sales.\n\n\"You can't just sit back and listen to the song, you have to be playing, otherwise you fail and the game shuts down,\" he said. \"It's a very hands-on experience. It makes the music and artist more popular and it benefits us from a sales point of view.\"\n\nÂ©2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
