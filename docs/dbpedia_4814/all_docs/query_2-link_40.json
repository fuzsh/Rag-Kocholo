        "text": "Esquire: ‘Steve Jobs and the Portal to the Invisible’ ★\n\nLong piece for Esquire by Tom Junod. Doesn’t cover new ground, but it’s a good attempt to place Steve Jobs — his influence and lasting impact on the world — in context.\n\nMy only significant gripe is that Junod trots out the old the Mac got crushed because Apple kept the Mac closed and the DOS/Windows PC was open chestnut, and attributes the decision to Jobs’s penchant for control. But Junod also acknowledges that Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985, just a year or so after the original Mac shipped. Whatever happened to the Mac between 1985 and 1996 had nothing to do with Jobs.\n\nDell Opens Movie Store With One Title ★\n\nHeck of a job, Bucher.\n\nStainless 0.1 ★\n\nVery impressive work from Mesa Dynamics: Stainless is a new multi-process WebKit-based browser for Leopard, inspired by Google Chrome. Same basic architecture as Chrome, in that each browser tab gets its own process. It’s a “technology demo” at this point, missing all sorts of stuff like bookmarks, history management, and even shortcuts for switching between tabs, but it definitely works.\n\nIncomplete though it may be, what’s there now is very nice. The tabs offer better dragability than Safari’s, and I love the visual feedback for a tab in “private” mode.\n\nUsing iPhone-Optimized Web Apps on the Mac ★\n\nDan Cederholm is using Hahlo (an iPhone web app Twitter client) on his Mac, via Fluid.\n\nNIN Edition of Tap Tap Revenge ★\n\nThis is a brilliant idea: a licensed version of Tap Tap Revenge with a visual theme and music from a specific band. I predict big sales and lots of press about it. Why settle for selling music when you can sell games? No surprise that Trent Reznor is ahead of the curve on this.\n\n(The announcement also notes that Tapulous has hired my good friend and former Joyent colleague Bryan Bell.)\n\nThe Survey That Squashed AAPL ★\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt takes a close look at the IT purchasing-plan survey that sparked the dramatic sell-off on Apple’s stock yesterday:\n\nSo there are indeed signs of a cooling trend for Apple, but it’s not at all clear that they justify an 18% drop in its share price. Dell, by comparison, dropped 5.9% on Monday and its ChangeWave chart is disaster.\n\nIn short, it seems like Apple’s stock took a disproportionate hit for a downward turn in IT purchasing industry-wide. Plus, quite obviously, it was the single worst day in 20 years for a bad forecast about any publicly-traded company to be released.\n\nTechnologizer’s iPhone Survey Results ★\n\nUnsurprising but interesting nonetheless. For example, 97 percent of respondents were running the updated 2.1 OS; I don’t think any other cell phone maker could get that sort of number. It’s a testimony to Apple’s tight iTunes/iPhone integration. Also, three-quarters of respondents have downloaded 10 or more apps from the App Store.\n\nDifferences Between Google Update Engine and Sparkle ★\n\nGoogle Groups thread with comments from Google’s Greg Miller and Sparkle creator Andy Matuschak.\n\nFocus and Recompose ★\n\nDuncan Davidson has a splendid, illustrated explanation regarding the shortcomings of focus-and-recompose. A good follow-up to his piece about the shortcomings in the auto-focus system in Canon’s just-announced EOS 5D Mark II.\n\nApple Selling Unlocked iPhones in Hong Kong ★\n\nFrom an AP report on Apple’s official unlocked phones in Hong Kong:\n\n“Phone 3G purchased at the Apple Online Store can be activated with any wireless carrier,” it said on the site.\n\nOffering free shipping, the 8-gigabyte phone goes for $5,400 Hong Kong dollars ($695) while the 16-gigabyte version costs HK$6,200 ($798).\n\nSince the global rollout in July, Hong Kong buyers could only purchase the multimedia phone from Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd. with a two-year mobile contract, even though the device was widely available on the black market.\n\nAt those prices — roughly $700/800 for 8/16 GB, respectively — I would presume it’s just as profitable for Apple, if not more so, than the subsidized iPhones including the carrier kick-back.\n\nBut why only in Hong Kong? Why not sell unlocked iPhone 3Gs at those prices everywhere? Is it that Hong Kong consumers are particularly willing to spend $800 on an unlocked phone? Or is it that the black market was particularly strong there?\n\nJon Hicks on Billings 3.0 ★\n\nBillings 3 sounds like exactly the app I always wished for back when I was freelancing.\n\nNew open source Mac OS X software update engine from Google. Unclear at a glance how it compares to Sparkle.\n\nSousChef 1.0 ★\n\nNew $30 “digital cooking assistant” from Acacia Tree Software. Lets you publish and share recipes with other SousChef users, and will find recipes based on the ingredients you have at hand. And I love this idea:\n\nIt doesn’t make any sense to print out a recipe every time you want to cook, so SousChef includes a ten foot mode so you can place your computer somewhere safe but still read your recipes from across the room. Ten foot mode features a high contrast fullscreen display with smooth transitions and only the info you need to know. While in ten foot mode SousChef can read your recipes to you and can be controlled via speech or a remote.\n\n‘You Can’t Fight in Here!’ ★\n\nBrief interview with production designer Ken Adam, regarding the iconic war room set he designed for Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove. (Thanks to Gord Locke.)\n\nHere’s a small scan of Adam’s final concept drawing.\n\nTop Draw 1.0 ★\n\nDaniel Waylonis, from Google’s Mac team:\n\nTop Draw is an image generation program just launched in the Google Mac Playground. By using simple text scripts, based on JavaScript, Top Draw can create surprisingly complex and interesting images. Even cooler is that the program has built-in support for installing any image of yours as your desktop image.\n\nOddica Returns ★\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, my friends at Oddica — with whom I’ve partnered to sell DF t-shirts the last two years — are back with some excellent new shirt designs. Also check out the new Oddica weblog, which today features an interview with Schtock.com’s Ben Pieratt.\n\nAdmit It, Brushed Metal Was Ugly ★\n\nHere’s GUIdebook’s archive of screenshots from Mac OS X 10.3, released five years ago, at the height of you-know-who’s infatuation with brushed metal. It’s worse than you remember.\n\nPaul Goracke on the ‘iPhone Black’ UI Look ★\n\nPaul Goracke:\n\nGratuitous use of a black UI only serves to distance an application from this smooth interface flow — maybe not as bad as a yellow, green or pale blue background, or an application that doesn’t even use standard navigation, tool and tab bars — but distanced nonetheless. Ironically, as more applications use the black UI, any one app using it is no longer differentiated — it’s now just noticeably “not Apple.”\n\nHis comparison to brushed metal is interesting and apt, but I do see one important difference: brushed metal looked bad, in and of itself. The black iPhone UI look doesn’t look bad, per se, it’s just different than the standard theme.\n\nAAPL Taking a Bath Today ★\n\nBunch of analysts downgrade Apple stock. As of this moment, the stock’s down 14 percent for the day.\n\nYou Wild, Beautiful Thing. You Crazy Handful of Nothin’ ★\n\nRoger Ebert:\n\nPaul Newman seemed to represent the best of what we could hope for. He was handsome, yes. He had those blue eyes, yes. Helpful in making him a star, but inconsequential to his ultimate achievement. What he expressed above all was grace, and comfort within his own skin.\n\nThe Big Picture: The Singapore Grand Prix ★\n\nGorgeous photographs from the first-ever Formula One race held at night.\n\nLate ’80s Apple France Ad ★\n\nTerrific old commercial for Apple by Claude Miller. (Via Coudal.)\n\nLarry Ellison on Cloud Computing ★\n\nSay what you want about Larry Ellison, but he’s not much for bullshit.\n\nTechnologizer’s iPhone Satisfaction Survey ★\n\nHarry McCracken:\n\nEnter Technologizer’s iPhone Satisfaction Survey. We’re going to collect data from a bunch of iPhone users (both the original model and the 3G) on what they like, what they don’t like, what they’re doing with the phone, and what they’d like to see future iPhones do.\n\nLoopt ★\n\nMy thanks to Loopt for sponsoring this week’s DF RSS feed. In a nut, Loopt is a location-aware social network that can link to other services like Facebook, Twitter, and Yelp. It lets you do things like find nearby restaurants that are recommended by your own friends. Version 1.1 of their free iPhone app just hit the App Store last night.\n\nLoopt, you may recall, had an onstage demo during the WWDC keynote this year, which I mocked on Twitter. What was cool is that when they contacted me to inquire about sponsoring the DF feed, they took the jokes in stride, and offered to pay for the ad in polo shirts.\n\nSonic Lighter ★\n\nMike Arrington on Sonic Lighter, a $1 “virtual lighter” iPhone app that is spreading quickly thanks to being location-aware. When you light it up, it registers on a global map.\n\nImpressive when you consider that every dot on the map is a dollar. Update: My mistake, apparently every dot is just an “ignition”, so each dot doesn’t correlate to a unique user. Still, though, the thing looks crazy popular.\n\nA New Interrobang Design!? ★\n\nStephen Coles:\n\nI submit that the reason the interrobang didn’t catch on is due mostly to its design. The smashing of straight and curved vertical strokes atop each other is hardly a graceful combination, and it gets especially messy at text sizes (‽). Were it drawn more thoughtfully like those of Christian Schwartz’s Amplitude and Fritz, the interrobang might be part of our standard punctuation today, a member of the basic Latin character set, and common in our written vernacular.\n\nI’ve never been a fan of the interrobang, but Schwartz’s designs for it are so clever that they might change my mind. I think Coles is right that the problem with the interrobang as we know it is that it’s ugly. To my eyes, in most typefaces that have an interrobang glyph, it always looks better to just use adjacent exclamation and question marks — ‘!?’ rather than ‘‽’.\n\n‘Organizing Our Marvellous Neighbours’ ★\n\nJoe Clark’s new e-book, subtitled “How to Feel Good About Canadian English”. $17.83 (CAD, of course). Just bought my copy.\n\nLightsaber Unleashed ★\n\nFinally, some good news regarding an app that had been removed from the App Store. The Mac Box’s PhoneSaber was a fun little accelerometer-based lightsaber simulator — fire it up, wave your iPhone around, and it made lightsaber sounds. The developers pulled it from the App Store shortly after release, however, due to licensing concerns.\n\nAs of today, it’s back, renamed Lightsaber Unleashed, as a free (and apparently licensed) promotion for the new Force Unleashed game.\n\nThird, Never-Aired Seinfeld Ad for Microsoft Was Filmed? ★\n\nAsher Moses, reporting for the Sydney Morning Herald:\n\nMicrosoft has already run two ad spots featuring Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld awkwardly meeting in a discount shoe shop and attempting to reconnect with real people by moving in with a normal family.\n\nBut even though a third ad featuring Seinfeld was filmed, Microsoft dumped the comic last week in favour of new ads featuring more current celebrities such as actress Eva Longoria, singer Pharrell Williams and even author Deepak Chopra declaring “I’m a PC”.\n\nBut all three are Mac fans, Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag revealed.\n\nI don’t care about the fact that the ads themselves were produced on Macs. I think you’d be hard-pressed to find any major ad agency that doesn’t produce their creative work on Macs. Making fun of Microsoft for this would be like making fun of Apple because they use Windows PCs for things like SAP.\n\nWhat’s interesting to me is the report of a third, never-aired Seinfeld spot. I heard the same thing last week, privately, from a friend in Seattle. But now here it is in print. If true, it’s proof that Microsoft’s claim that they’d only ever planned to run two Seinfeld ads and for just two weeks is, in fact, a crock.\n\nHead of Skate ★\n\nApropos given the previous link.\n\nSarah Palin on Russia ★\n\nVice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, in her own words, on her previous claims that Alaska’s proximity to Russia lends her foreign policy experience:\n\n“It’s very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia, as Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America, where do they go? It’s Alaska. It’s just right over the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, Russia, because they are right there, right next to our state.”\n\nYou really need to watch the video to get the full effect. Taken at her word, she seems to believe that Vladimir Putin is preparing to launch an air strike against the United States, and that she as governor of Alaska would play a role in our response.\n\nDesigning the UI of Things for iPhone ★\n\nI don’t agree with all their decisions, but I do love the way the Cultured Code guys are so willing to share their design iterations.\n\nThe Dark Bailout ★\n\n“Why don’t you call me when you want to start taking things a little more... seriously.” (Via Rands.)\n\nBad Satire ★\n\nP.Z. Myers on Roger Ebert’s attempted satire of young-earth creationism (the belief that the entire universe is just 6,000 years old):\n\nBut Ebert is no Jonathan Swift. Imagine if, in 1729, there had been a number of letters to the editor by various authors proposing that Irish children be exterminated and eaten. Imagine that laws of that nature were being seriously debated in Parliament, and that one of the parties had made it a part of their platform. While the laws were being regularly defeated, opponents still had to stand up and seriously debate why it was unethical to eat babies. Imagine that a candidate for prime minister actually solemnly suggested that we ought to at least consider the merits of eating Irish children.\n\nIn that context, Swift’s essay would have fallen flat as a cowflop dropped from the Tower of London.\n\nTo satirize the creationism movement, you’d have to, say, posit that the earth is just 60 years old.\n\nW. ★\n\nYou got to admit it’s a good title.\n\nLetterCult ★\n\nNew web site dedicated to custom letter design, from Ray Frenden and Brian Jaramillo. First up: an interview with Doyald Young.\n\nUpdate: Alas, popularity has knocked LetterCult temporarily offline.\n\nNow This Is How You Make a TV Commercial ★\n\nFantastic. (Via Andrew Sullivan). Update: Changed the link to a higher-quality version hosted by Hovis.\n\nT-Mobile Lifts 1 GB Bandwidth Cap for Google Phone ★\n\nThat didn’t take long.\n\nDavid Letterman Reacts to John McCain Suspending Campaign ★\n\nHighlights from last night’s show. Very funny.\n\nJason Snell: ‘Don’t Drive iPhone Developers Away, Apple’ ★\n\nJason Snell goes deep with a comprehensive look at the App Store situation:\n\nIf you don’t want to sympathize with developers, let me rephrase it to describe how this will affect users: If developers are afraid to write programs for the iPhone that aren’t games, to-do lists, and tip calculators, for fear that all their hard work will be wasted by a malicious or capricious Apple rejection notice, they will stop writing programs for the platform. And the well of innovative, interesting iPhone software will dry up.\n\nA must-read essay. Apple’s stewardship of the App Store, to date, can only be explained by malevolence or incompetence. Either way, they should change course.\n\n‘Killing Our Enthusiasm’ ★\n\nCraig Hockenberry:\n\nYou should also be aware that much of the discontent is being masked by the NDA that’s currently in place. I, and many others, do not want to anger Apple and there are no forums to voice our concerns privately.\n\nBecause of the NDA, and because of some unpublicized incidents of petty intimidation from people at Apple to iPhone developers, there is a climate of fear in the Mac/iPhone developer community. You cannot judge the depth of long-time Apple developers’ unhappiness with the current situation by the available public comments, because it isn’t being expressed publicly. It’s a tip-of-the-iceberg situation.\n\nPragmatic Cancels iPhone Programming Book ★\n\nThe Pragmatic Programmers:\n\nWe’ve had the iPhone book ready to go beta for some months, but were prevented from publishing it because of the iPhone SDK’s Non-Disclosure Agreement (which affects all publishers regarding this material, regardless of whether the reader is a member of the ADC or not). [...]\n\nIt now appears that Apple does not intend to lift the NDA any time soon. Regrettably, this means we are pulling our iPhone book out of production.\n\nDan Moren on the iPhone NDA ★\n\nDan Moren:\n\nThere may very well be a good reason for the NDA to remain in place—but that shouldn’t prohibit Apple from explaining that reason to its developers.\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\nT-Mobile G1 Video Hands-On ★\n\nGood example footage of a G1 in use side-by-side with an iPhone 3G.\n\nBeneath Apple ★\n\nBrent Simmons:\n\nThis behavior is definitely beneath the company that makes the software and hardware I adore and love developing for.\n\nI’m starting to get The Fear.\n\nAndroid and T-Mobile G1’s Five Worst Flaws ★\n\nThe lack of multi-touch is a hardware deficiency in the G1, not an Android deficiency. But it highlights the problems developers will have if they want to create iPhone-quality experiences. If you require multi-touch in your app then your app won’t work on some Android phones. If you don’t require multi-touch, then you’re stuck writing extra code and designing alternative interface gestures.\n\nIf Android developers tend to take the easy way out and just target the lowest common denominator of device capabilities, then the platform will never rival the iPhone — and it will only fall further behind each successive year.\n\nWalt Mossberg on the G1 ★\n\nWalt Mossberg:\n\nIn sum, the G1 is a powerful, versatile device which will offer users a real alternative in the new handheld computing category the iPhone has occupied alone.\n\nHTC G1 Specs ★\n\nUpdate: I’ve updated the link to point to HTC’s official page. Corrections below.\n\nAt $179, it costs $20 less than an 8 GB iPhone 3G, but the G1 only comes with a 1 GB SD card. It also only has 64 MB of RAM. The G1, however, comes with 192 MB of RAM; the iPhone has just 128 (although Apple doesn’t publicly state how much RAM it has). The overall size is about the same, except the G1 is 16mm thick, vs. 12 mm for the iPhone. The display has the same pixel count (480 x 320), but is smaller at 3.2 inches vs. 3.5 for the iPhone.\n\nSome limitations are much like the iPhone’s: it’s SIM-locked to the carrier, has no VOIP app yet, and doesn’t allow tethering the data network to a PC.\n\nThe G1’s Achilles Heel: T-Mobile’s Network ★\n\nDSL Reports on the G1:\n\nT-Mobile insists that they’ll have HSDPA up and running in 21 markets by mid-october when the phone officially launches — and 27 markets by year’s end. AT&T got a pretty sound beating for releasing the iPhone 3G with more than 200 HSDPA-enabled markets\n\nAnd, worse, “unlimited data usage” means “limited to 1 GB”. From T-Mobile’s fine print:\n\nIf your total data usage in any billing cycle is more than 1 GB, your data throughput for the remainder of that cycle may be reduced to 50 kbps or less.\n\nI just checked, and for my last AT&T billing cycle, I used 360 MB of data on my iPhone 3G. That cycle includes five days at the Jersey shore and three days in Chicago for C4, both of which trips I used the data network for as long as the battery would allow. Other than that, though I spent the rest of the month at home, where I use the AT&T data network just a few times a day. I can see how someone who uses the cell network for data every day would go over 1 GB a month easily.\n\nApple ‘Solves’ Problem With App Store Rejections ★\n\nArnold Kim:\n\nAparently, Apple has now started labeling their rejection letters with Non-Disclosure (NDA) warnings:\n\nTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS MESSAGE IS UNDER NON-DISCLOSURE\n\nI.e. if you’re a developer whose app has been rejected from the App Store, you are not allowed to say that your app has been rejected from the App Store.\n\n(Via Paul Kafasis.)\n\nG1 Overview ★\n\nRob Beschizza has a nice overview of today’s HTC/T-Mobile/Google G1 announcement. Highlights include that it doesn’t do any sort of desktop syncing; it syncs only with Google servers. It costs $179 and requires a contract with T-Mobile, so it’s only $20 cheaper than an iPhone.\n\nI’m still rooting for it to be good.\n\nThe World, Justified ★\n\nTypography meets cartography.\n\nT-Mobile G1 Has No 3.5mm Headphone Jack ★\n\nGiven how many complaints there were about the original iPhone’s recessed headphone jack, it seems weird that HTC would make this decision with the G1. The accompanying photo also serves as a good illustration of how much thicker than an iPhone the G1 (which features a slide-out keyboard) is.\n\nGood Ideas and Lies ★\n\nThis strikes me as a very good rule of thumb:\n\nGood ideas do not need lots of lies told about them in order to gain public acceptance.\n\nCheap, Easy Audio Transcription With Mechanical Turk ★\n\nHow Andy Baio used Mechanical Turk to get a 36-minute audio interview transcribed for just $15.40.\n\nField Notes Brand Calendar Pre-Order ★\n\nFrom my pals at Coudal Partners and Drapin Design Co., the best-designed calendar you’re likely to see. Update: The site was down for a bit, but is back up now.\n\nNetNewsWire for iPhone Stats ★\n\nOver 200,000 users; average user subscribes to 26 feeds.\n\nI subscribe to far fewer feeds in NetNewsWire on my iPhone than I do on my Mac. On my Mac, I use NetNewsWire to track feeds for everything I’m interested in. On my iPhone, I use it only for those feeds which are the most important and/or most interesting.\n\nFive iPhone Racing Games Reviewed ★\n\nI bought Freeverse’s Wingnuts Moto Chaser. Pretty good game.\n\n‘Reverie’, Sample Video From the Upcoming Canon 5D Mark II ★\n\nShort from by Vincent Laforet, shot using a pre-production EOS 5D Mark II. Unbelievable quality. No jelly movement here. This is film-quality motion picture footage in a $2,700 camera. Update: With regard to jelly movement, several readers point out that the film doesn’t feature much panning, and what panning it does feature is slow, so jelly movement may well be a problem.\n\nCS4: Sweating the Details ★\n\nAdobe’s John Nack:\n\nI’m a perfectionist, and I deeply, viscerally want to smooth & polish every aspect of Photoshop. Doing it all in any one cycle is impossible, but I’m proud to say we’ve put a ton of effort into sweating the details in CS4.\n\nYou’re going to see tons of flashier features in other write-ups, and of course I’ll cover them here, but for this cycle I want to lead with the little stuff — things you might not read about otherwise, but which can make a big difference while working.\n\nI love weblog posts like this. Some good news for Mac users, too, such as:\n\nCmd-~ (tilde) is now assigned to switching among open documents, as is Ctrl-Tab, meaning Photoshop is now consistent with both Mac and Windows conventions.\n\n(Not sure why Nack’s post is riddled with underlined phrases that aren’t links, though. I keep trying to click on them. The use of underlining for any purpose other than indicating hypertext links died a decade ago. Update: Perhaps it was a formatting error; the underlines are gone now.)\n\nAdobe Creative Suite 4 ★\n\nMaybe I’ll finally upgrade from CS1 this time.\n\nWil Shipley on the App Store: ‘Let the Market Decide’ ★\n\nWil Shipley has a very good proposal for how Apple should be handling the App Store:\n\nThe App Store needs to think of itself as two different parts - it already implements these parts, but the people who run the store need to understand that these two parts are fundamentally separate. [...]\n\nEveryone can get into the warehouse. Only the select few can get into the storefront.\n\nLights Off ★\n\nCraig Hockenberry took the source code to Lights Off — a simple, fun iPhone game from Lucas Newman and Adam Betts written against the jailbreak APIs a year ago — got it working under the official iPhone APIs, and has released it as open source.\n\n‘All of a Sudden’ ★\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders:\n\nFor years now, they’ve told us that we can’t afford — that the government providing healthcare to all people is just unimaginable; it can’t be done. We don’t have the money to rebuild our infrastructure. We don’t have the money to wipe out poverty. We can’t do it. But all of a sudden, yeah, we do have $700 billion for a bailout of Wall Street.\n\nIn just one week.\n\nVia µ Slabs.\n\nBadass Pony ★\n\nArmin Vit on Ford’s subtle but very effective redesign of the Mustang badge.\n\nDeliberation ★\n\nNewt Gingrich, on the Bush administration’s “hurry up and immediately approve a $700 billion bailout” push, and the Democratic congress’s apparent willingness to go along with it:\n\nCongress was designed by the Founding Fathers to move slowly, precisely to avoid the sudden panic of a one-week solution that becomes a 20-year mess.\n\nAnd so we’ve now reached the point where I’m in full agreement with Newt Gingrich on the most pressing political debate of the day.\n\n‘Nuh-Uh, My Mom Thinks I’m Cool’ ★\n\nKottke:\n\nThat’s the problem with Microsoft’s ads. They’re still #1 and the bigger company, but by referencing Apple’s successful ad campaign, they’re acting like Apple is #1.\n\nWe Are All PCs ★\n\nAmelie Gillette on Microsoft’s new “I’m a PC” ads:\n\nAlso, it would have been simpler for Deepak Chopra to just say, “I’m a PC, and I will gradually wear down your patience with verbal slingshot after verbal slingshot filled with bullshit.”\n\nUpdate, December 2016: The commercial in question can be seen here.\n\nWhat Advertising Can’t Fix ★\n\nSeth Godin on Microsoft’s Apple envy:\n\nMicrosoft may very well not be broken. The world needs reliable bureaucracies that mollify the needs of corporations and individuals in the center of the market. But if it is broken, advertising isn’t going to fix it.\n\nMicrosoft’s cultural problem is that they seem utterly dissatisfied with the perception that they are a company that makes boatloads of money selling (a) boring but profitable business software and (b) the lowest common denominator PC operating system, even though that’s exactly what they do.\n\nA Nation Turns Its Lonely Eyes to You ★\n\nLast night the Yankees beat the Orioles 7-3, in the final baseball game ever played in the most celebrated sporting venue in the world, Yankee Stadium.\n\nNikon’s New AF-S Nikkor 50mm ƒ/1.4G Lens ★\n\nIf you own a Nikon SLR, you should buy this lens.\n\nNeven Mrgan Joins Panic ★\n\nGood for Neven, good for Panic. What a great fit.\n\nFacebuster ★\n\nNew extra-blocky block serif by Silas Dilworth.\n\nThe Value of Keeping an Open Mind ★\n\nJason Santa Maria on Jan Tschichold’s change of heart regarding sans serif typefaces. Without an open mind, we’d have never had Sabon.\n\nCisco to Buy Jabber ★\n\nNot sure if I should care.\n\nWhere To? GPS Points of Interest 1.1 (iTunes Link) ★\n\nMy thanks to TapTapTap for once again sponsoring the DF RSS feed. They’ve just released version 1.1 of “Where To? GPS Points of Interest”, their $3 location-based “find stuff near you” app for the iPhone. Locate everything from restaurants to hotels to stores, using a thoughtful, very slick UI.\n\nCheck out TapTapTap’s weblog for more info and an inside look at their development process.\n\n‘Jelly Movement’ ★\n\nSo DSLRs from Canon and Nikon now shoot video. And Red, the upstart digital video camera company, is planning to start making digital still cameras. Red CEO Jim Jannard claims that it’s easier for Red to move from video to still than for Canon and Nikon to move the other way, and he points to this example footage from a Nikon D90 as proof.\n\nMore JavaScript Engine Benchmarks ★\n\nSome interesting performance differences between Mac and Windows with the Dromaeo benchmark: Safari and Firefox nightlies come out just about even on Windows, but Safari wins big on Mac OS X.\n\nJavaScript Engine Performance Leapfrog Continues ★\n\nAs I suspected, SquirrelFish retakes the lead.\n\nSquirrelFish Extreme ★\n\nMaciej Stachowiak introducing a “major revamp” of WebKit’s next-generation JavaScript engine, now available in the nightly builds. More than twice as fast as the version of SquirrelFish announced on June 2, and more than three times faster than the shipping JavaScript engine in Safari 3.1. I’m pretty sure it out-benchmarks Google’s V8 and Mozilla’s TraceMonkey, at least for now. JavaScript engines may well be the most competitive field in applied computer science today.\n\nHere’s Stachowiak on the improvements they’ve made since June:\n\nSquirrelFish Extreme uses four different technologies to deliver much better performance than the original SquirrelFish: bytecode optimizations, polymorphic inline caching, a lightweight “context threaded” JIT compiler, and a new regular expression engine that uses our JIT infrastructure.\n\nThe new regex engine is near and dear to the nerdiest regions of my heart:\n\nNot all code spends a bunch of time in regexps, but with the speed of our new regular expression engine, WREC (the WebKit Regular Expression Compiler), you can write the kind of text processing code you’d want to do in Perl or Python or Ruby, and do it in JavaScript instead. In fact we believe that in many cases our regular expression engine will beat the highly tuned regexp processing in those other languages.\n\nThat’s a bold statement.\n\nMicrosoft Aims to Redefine ‘I’m a PC’ ★\n\nThis Microsoft advertising story just gets weirder. Now they’re rolling out a commercial with a John Hodgman lookalike who declares, “Hello, I’m a PC, and I’ve been made into a stereotype.”\n\nDirectly responding to Apple’s campaign is weak. It’s playing Pepsi to Apple’s Coke, Burger King to Apple’s McDonald’s. It’s an explicit acknowledgement that Microsoft is the second-place brand.\n\nValleywag: Microsoft to Announce Jerry Seinfeld Ads Cancelled Tomorrow ★\n\nWhat a mess Microsoft is in.\n\nWhat’s the Deal With the 4 GB Fourth-Gen iPod Nanos? ★\n\nOddly, in addition to the two advertised capacities for the new Nanos (8 and 16 GB), there are also 4 GB models available in some European stores. Jeremy Horwitz speculates that Apple was originally planning 4 and 8 GB capacities, and moved to 8/16 late in the game in response to the new Zunes from Microsoft.\n\nInside the iPhone App Store Acceptance Process ★\n\nNiall Kennedy on the App Store and the Podcaster saga. Includes this fascinating nugget regarding Podcaster developer Alex Sokirynsky’s decision to sell the app on his own, via ad hoc provisioning:\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon Podcaster had provisioned 1130 devices for distribution across 12 different copies of the application hosted on Google Code. Each new uploaded build included up to new 100 authorized devices after the publisher received payment via PayPal. It’s stretching the Ad-Hoc distribution model a bit but the application may have collected approximately $11,000 over the weekend through suggested donations of $10 per handset. At the time of writing Apple has not pulled the application or developer certificates from their central certificate authority.\n\nRegarding the Original iPod’s October 2001 Debut ★\n\nIn my “Greatly Exaggerated” piece last week, I wrote:\n\nTo claim that this week’s [iPod/iTunes] event was in any way not normal is to ignore the fact that Apple has scheduled an event just like Tuesday’s during September every year since the iPod debuted in 2001.\n\nThis was followed by a footnote, which read:\n\nThe original iPod debut was in October, not September, 2001, pushed back one month in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nI based this footnote on my recollection of an interview with Steve Jobs in Steven Levy’s book about the iPod, The Perfect Thing. My recollection was wrong, however. Here’s the relevant passage from the book:\n\nThe subject turned to September 11. A lot of conversations back then did that. Jobs said that after the attack, Apple had given the introduction a lot of thought, fearing that the wrong note might offend. “I think that we’re feeling good about coming out with this at a difficult time,” he said. “Hopefully it will bring a little joy to people.” Such questions led to a discussion of Apple’s relatively low-key iPod launch event, which in other circumstances might have been held in a big city — if not San Francisco, maybe even New York. “It’s a tough time,” Jobs finally said. “But life goes on. It must go on.”\n\nAnd so while the scale of the introduction was scaled back in light of the September 11 attacks, there is no indication that the date was changed. I’ve edited the footnote accordingly, and I regret the error.\n\nCanon EOS 5D Mark II ★\n\n21 MP, improved high-ISO performance, and a 1080p video mode. MSRP $2700, on sale in November.\n\nSample pictures and video footage here, but be warned that the link will resize browser windows.\n\nMy Gal ★\n\nGeorge Saunders’s piece on Sarah Palin in this week’s New Yorker is an instant classic:\n\nI’m finding it hard to concentrate, as my eyes are killing me, due to I have not blinked since I started writing this. And, me being Regular, it takes a long time for me to write something this long.\n\nWhere was I? Ah, yes: I hate Élites. Which is why, whenever I am having brain surgery, or eye surgery, which is sometimes necessary due to all my non-blinking, I always hire some random Regular guy, with shaking hands if possible, who is also a drunk, scared of the sight of blood, and harbors a secret dislike for me.\n\nDFW: ‘Roger Federer as Religious Experience’ ★\n\nAnother terrific non-fiction piece by David Foster Wallace: this August 2006 piece on Roger Federer for The New York Times’s Play Magazine.\n\nFrom the DF Archive: Closed Is Open ★\n\nVis a vis the aforelinked item regarding Microsoft’s “choice” mantra, here’s a DF piece from 2003: “Reading between the lines as Dave Fester, general manager of the Windows Digital Media division, lays out Microsoft’s shamelessly Orwellian party line regarding digital music.”\n\nJoe Wilcox on Microsoft’s ‘Choice’ Strategy for Windows Mobile ★\n\nJoe Wilcox on Windows Mobile:\n\nMicrosoft executives harp on about choice. That’s fine if businesses or consumers choose your product. The local supermarket offers lots of choice, but I can walk to the pricier convenience store. The point: Choice is good but it’s not a market differentiator. People need good choices, and Windows Mobile doesn’t feel like one of them right now.\n\nThe “choice” mantra was Microsoft’s oft-repeated response to the iPod back circa 2002–2004, and their entire explanation as to why PlaysForSure was going to win and the iPod would be relegated to some sort of Macintosh-sized niche. I’ll have to do some research to see how that turned out.\n\nPeter Cohen reviews TouchGrove’s LED Football game for iPhone — a replica of the late-’70s handheld electronic game from Mattel. Could just be that, at age 35, I’m in the bull’s-eye for this game’s demographic, but I love it. At just $1, it’s a steal.\n\nHP Working on Their Own Desktop OS? ★\n\nInteresting report by Aaron Ricadela at BusinessWeek:\n\nThe ecosystem that Microsoft has built up around its Windows operating system is showing signs of strain. In one of several recent moves by partners that sell or support the company’s software, Hewlett-Packard, the world’s No. 1 PC maker, has quietly assembled a group of engineers to develop software that will let customers bypass certain features of Vista, the latest version of Windows. Employees on a separate skunk works team are even angling to replace Windows with an HP-assembled operating system, say three sources close to the company.\n\nIt’d be a big bite to chew, but if there’s any company in the world that could do it, it might be HP. I hope it’s true.\n\nMac OS X 10.5.5 Update ★\n\nIn Software Update now. Long list of fixes in the release notes.\n\nBest Buy Buys Napster for $121 Million ★\n\nSeems like a clear response to the iTunes Store’s rise to the top spot in the U.S. retail market. Selling music on CDs is quickly turning into a niche.\n\nYou’d think they could have built their own online store from scratch for less than $121 million, though. I think Best Buy’s been taken to the cleaners on this deal.\n\nA Modest Proposal ★\n\nJeffrey Zeldman:\n\nIf you’re selling toothpaste, your claims must be vetted by legal and medical professionals. But not if you’re selling a candidate.\n\nIf you’re selling a candidate, not only can you lie about his record, but more to the point, you can lie about his opponent.\n\nHarper’s Magazine: David Foster Wallace, in Memoriam ★\n\nHarper’s has published its collection of work by David Foster Wallace. “Ticket to the Fair” and “Tense Present: Democracy, English, and the Wars Over Usage” are two of my favorites, but it’s all good. “Shipping Out: On the (Nearly Lethal) Comforts of a Luxury Cruise” became the title piece of his essay collection A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again.\n\nAir Sharing 1.0 ★\n\nAir Sharing is a terrific utility for the iPhone. It uses Bonjour networking to run a WebDAV file server. You mount the server as a volume in the Finder (or on Windows or Linux), and you can send files back and forth to your iPhone. On the iPhone, it provides file viewers/players for a slew of common formats, such as iWork, Safari web archives, PDF, RTF, movies, audio, and images.\n\nThe regular price is $7, but the introductory price is free. (Via Michael Tsai.)\n\nFinancial Russian Roulette ★\n\nPaul Krugman on today’s Wall Street news:\n\nFor example, today much of the Fed’s portfolio is tied up in loans backed by dubious collateral. Also, officials are worried that their rescue efforts will encourage even more risky behavior in the future. After all, it’s starting to look as if the rule is heads you win, tails the taxpayers lose.\n\nHope ★\n\nPhotograph by Michael David Murphy.\n\nTrip Cubby ★\n\nRemember TripLog/1040, the mileage and expense logging app for the iPhone with the, uh, questionable UI aesthetic? Trip Cubby is the same idea, done right. Looks like a winner if you need this sort of app.\n\nApple’s New Accessibility Web Site ★\n\nWith sections for Mac OS X, iPhone, and iPod/iTunes.\n\nApple Publishes Actual List of Changes in iPhone OS 2.1 for iPod Touch ★\n\nScreenshot captured by Patrick McCarron. Included in the list is a fix for the “backups to iTunes take way too long” bug.\n\nAnother Accessibility Win: Spoken Menus on New iPod Nanos ★\n\nGreat feature. I wonder if the new iPod Classics get this too? Update: The answer is no, only the Nanos have this feature.\n\nQuickTime Stream of Today’s Special Event ★\n\nStill wish they’d go back to streaming them live, somehow.\n\nMichael Quinion on ‘Funner’ and ‘Funnest’ ★\n\nInteresting history of fun as an adjective, apropos Apple’s description of the new iPod Touch as “The funnest iPod ever.” The word is certainly legitimate enough for use in advertising copy, but it doesn’t sound good to my ears. I’m not outright offended, though, as many seemingly are. A more substantial gripe than questioning the word’s legitimacy is that it’s too easily misread as funniest. (Via Paul Kafasis.)\n\nSwitch Off the iTunes 8 Genre Browser ★\n\nPaul Mison has the scoop on the defaults command that disables “Genre” column in the browser view in iTunes 8. The visible preference to control this was removed from the iTunes prefs dialog.\n\nGizmodo: Nike-Plus Only Works With New Second Generation iPod Touch ★\n\nThe built-in Nike-Plus integration requires hardware that isn’t present in the iPhone or original iPod Touch.\n\niTunes 8 Now Available ★\n\n“Genius” playlists (and Store recommendations), a new grid view, HD TV shows, and a new visualizer. On the accessibility front, iTunes is now “screen reader friendly” on both Mac OS X and Windows.\n\nMacworld’s Live Coverage of Apple’s ‘Let’s Rock’ Event ★\n\nGizmodo has good coverage too. I’m jotting notes on Twitter.\n\nLove the way Jobs opened the event.\n\nHow Videogames Blind Us With Science ★\n\nClive Thompson, on kids using the scientific method to get better at video games:\n\nOne of the reasons kids get bored by science is that too many teachers present it as a fusty collection of facts for memorization. This is precisely wrong. Science isn’t about facts. It’s about the quest for facts — the scientific method, the process by which we hash through confusing thickets of ignorance. It’s dynamic, argumentative, collaborative, competitive, filled with flashes of crazy excitement and hours of drudgework, and driven by ego: Our desire to be the one who figures it out, at least for now. It’s dramatic and nutty and fun.\n\n(Via Tim O’Reilly.)\n\nDesktopCoreLocation ★\n\nPhilippe Casgrain’s entry to the C4[2] IronCoder contest: “a clean-room implementation of Apple’s CoreLocation.framework, complete with sample application.”\n\nThe Continuing Correlation Between Apple’s Share Price and Steve Jobs’s Weight ★\n\nSpeaking of Dan Frommer, he sums up the thinking on Wall Street regarding tomorrow’s “Let’s Rock” special event:\n\nNew iPods — expected to be announced during an Apple media event tomorrow — are key to Apple’s holiday sales. But key to Apple’s (AAPL) stock activity tomorrow: How CEO Steve Jobs — who’s expected to deliver a keynote — looks on stage.\n\nRobert Holmes, writing for TheStreet.com, questions whether Jobs will even appear on stage:\n\nJobs has previously battled pancreatic cancer, but his frail appearance during the launch of the iPhone 3G in early June ignited speculation that he is continuing to battle the disease, sending Apple shares tumbling more than 7% during the week. Many Apple shareholders hope Jobs will be the keynote speaker during tomorrow’s event, assuaging fears.\n\nSpoiler: Jobs will be on stage, in his usual role. But he remains just as thin as he was in June. This isn’t some sort of state secret, though. Jobs is a common presence on the Apple campus. He eats in the cafeteria, he walks around between buildings. He’s not and has never been a recluse.\n\nDan Frommer: ‘Zune Gets New Features That Won’t Help Sell Zunes’ ★\n\nSometimes the whole story fits in the headline.\n\nTony Kaye About Kubrick ★\n\nA few weeks back, I linked to Armen Antranikian’s “Kubrick”, a short film for the UK’s Channel 4 featuring people talking about their personal experiences watching the films of Stanley Kubrick. The whole thing is just three minutes long, but Antranikian posted to YouTube a 20-minute outtake of Tony Kaye’s interview.\n\nThe film is terrific, but the Kaye interview is just fantastic. The URL for the YouTube version recently changed, so I’m re-linking to it here.\n\nUmbrella Today? ★\n\n“It’s like totally the simplest weather report ever, Julie.”\n\n(Via Rands.)\n\nRyan Block Disassembles Dan Lyons’s ‘Apple as Monopolist’ Newsweek Piece ★\n\nRyan Block:\n\nMaybe it’s just me, but I think Dan did a much better job at cutting to the heart of what makes Cupertino tick when he was doing so with subversive parody.\n\nLaptops Go Live ★\n\nSasha Frere-Jones in The New Yorker, on the growing use of computers in live music performances:\n\nLast December, a friend and I went to a release party for Mary J. Blige’s “Growing Pains” album. Near huge screens showing Blige videos, a d.j. was playing records on two turntables. The d.j.’s eyes, however, were trained on an Apple MacBook on a shelf above them. As a succession of Blige songs faded from one into the next, the d.j. never changed the records. My friend asked, “Is there a new Mary medley I don’t know about?”\n\nThe answer was no. The d.j., like many today, was using a program called Serato Scratch Live, which uses a turntable as a knob or a switch.\n\nShoe Circus ★\n\nThe first Jerry Seinfeld/Bill Gates commercial for Microsoft. Not a bad skit, but I’m not sure how this does anything for the Microsoft brand. Makes Gates seem cool, though.\n\nUSB Hub Slows Down iPhone Syncing? ★\n\nWith both my original iPhone after upgrading to the 2.0 OS and with my iPhone 3G, syncing with iTunes has been a lugubrious affair, typically taking an hour or more. After quipping about it on Twitter today, Scott Paterson directed me to this write-up of his, describing how his hours-long syncs were reduced to 5 minutes after switching from plugging his iPod into a USB hub to a direct connection on his Mac.\n\nI use a USB hub, too. I tried the direct connection, and damn if it didn’t complete a full sync in five minutes.\n\nUpdate: A lot of readers are reporting that even without a hub, they still get hour-plus iPhone sync times. Could be that my fast syncs yesterday were the result of having just completed a full sync and backup earlier in the evening.\n\nThe Story Behind Google Chrome ★\n\nNiall Kennedy’s comprehensive look at the people and the teams Google has assembled to build Chrome.\n\nSteven Levy: Inside Chrome ★\n\nGood line from Steven Levy’s behind-the-scenes look at Google’s Chrome project:\n\nSpeed may be Chrome’s most significant advance. When you improve things by an order of magnitude, you haven’t made something better — you’ve made something new.\n\niPhone Stencils for OmniGraffle ★\n\nAlong the lines of this library of iPhone UI elements for use mocking up interfaces in Photoshop, Patrick Crowley has released a comprehensive set of stencils for use with OmniGraffle.\n\nObjective-J and Cappuccino Released ★\n\nJavaScript library and web app framework modeled after Objective-C and Cocoa released as open source. See them in action in the Keynote-esque 280 Slides.\n\n‘MLB At Bat’ Adds Gameday ★\n\nOne of my favorite iPhone apps gets even better.\n\nNikon D3 Shutter Release in Super Slow Motion ★\n\nNice frame-by-frame animation from Jeffrey Friedl and Marianne Oelund illustrating how an SLR works. (Thanks to Jacob Rus.)\n\nApple Rejects Fart-Joke iPhone App ★\n\nMacRumors has a story on Pull My Finger, an iPhone App that plays a variety of fart sounds. The demo video shows that the app is clearly well done for what it is — it even vibrates the phone while it toots — but Apple rejected it:\n\nWe’ve reviewed your application Pull My Finger. We have determined that this application is of limited utility to the broad iPhone and iPod touch user community, and will not be published to the App Store.\n\nWith all the absolute crap that has made it into the store, which includes apps based on nothing more than sample code from Apple’s SDK, it seems ridiculous for Pull My Finger to be rejected on these grounds. The current number one app in the store is Koi Pond, which is utterly useless but extremely well-done.\n\nI’ve already heard from a top-tier developer this morning who, in response to this story, is dropping an idea for a very cool iPhone app out of fear that the work to create it would be for naught as Apple might reject it.\n\nGoogle Chrome’s Full List of Special about: Pages ★\n\nIf Apple did this, the pages would feature good graphic design.\n\njParallax ★\n\nStephen Band:\n\nParallax turns a selected element into a ‘window’, or viewport, and all its children into absolutely positioned layers that can be seen through the viewport. These layers move in response to the mouse, and, depending on their dimensions (and options for layer initialisation), they move by different amounts, in a parallaxy kind of way.\n\nVery cool. Try the demo and you’ll be impressed. (Thanks to Daniel Bogan.)\n\nThe Torrances ★\n\nArt by Kirk Demarais. (Via Coudal.)\n\nStraight Out of Compton ★\n\nJohn Siracusa:\n\nIt’s not that any particular feature of Chrome is so wonderful, or even that the sum of those features puts Safari back on its heels in the browser wars. It’s the idea that someone other than Apple has taken such clear leadership in this area. Google Chrome makes Safari’s user interface look conservative; it makes Apple look timid.\n\nTilt Scrolling in Instapaper Pro ★\n\nAdam Lisagor on the innovative “tilt scrolling” feature in Instapaper Pro.\n\nThe Future of the Instapaper iPhone App ★\n\nMarco Arment, developer of the terrific Instapaper iPhone app (and the Instapaper web site):\n\nI compiled a feature list for what I want in Instapaper.app 2.0, and it’s huge. It’s easily 6 months of work. I can’t do this and anything else — it has to just be this. I can only devote a few hours per week to Instapaper as it is. But if I can pull off the product I want for 2.0, I’ll really have something amazing.\n\nInstapaper (and, now, the new $10 Instapaper Pro) is one of my very favorite iPhone apps. In a nut, you set up a free account (super quick setup!), then use a bookmarklet in MobileSafari (or any desktop browser) to flag web pages you wish to read later. The Instapaper iPhone app stores local versions of these web pages, so you can read them (a) offline; and (b) in a text-only iPhone-optimized format.\n\nIf you like to read and haven’t at least tried the free version of Instapaper, you’re missing out.\n\nBeing the Platform ★\n\nDavid Weiss, reacting to Chrome:\n\nToday, it’s clear to me why I’ve felt this way: Google isn’t interested at all in “being a citizen” or part of a platform, they are interested in being the platform. If you look at the way Chrome is designed, it’s not so much designed to be a good browser, as much as it is a good operating system for web applications. Google’s desire is very much the same as Microsoft’s, except abstracted a little higher up the stack. They want to own the platform upon which web applications are built, just like Microsoft wants to own the platform upon which desktop applications are built.\n\nHence the “each tab is a separate process” architecture behind Chrome. The idea is that it makes every web app an independent citizen. It turns Chrome into a meta platform that sits atop a traditional “OS”. Chrome is to web apps what preemptive multitasking is to an operating system — a way to keep one wedged or crashed task from bringing down the whole environment.\n\nNFL TV Distribution Maps ★\n\nVia Kottke, a terrific resource for NFL fans wondering which games will be available on their local TV stations.\n\nMcCain’s Voice Mail to Palin ★\n\n“Is this some sort of joke? Am I getting punked here?” (Via Scott Simpson.)\n\nPinkerton ★\n\nMike Pinkerton, long-time Mac web browser developer, and one of the leaders behind the Gecko-based Camino, is also involved in Google’s efforts to create a Mac browser based on Chromium.\n\nAdvice From James Baker on Selecting a Vice Presidential Nominee ★\n\nJames Baker, former secretary of state and long-time Bush family counselor, on the lesson to be learned from Bush 41’s selection of Dan Quayle:\n\nThe best way to handle a proposed vice presidential nominee who has not been tested in national or big-state politics or high appointive office — and I have the obvious benefit of hindsight — is to float the name a few weeks before the convention and let the games begin. By opening gavel, the candidate will have run the gauntlet of press scrutiny or opposition research, or have dropped out. This approach wouldn’t necessarily work in a contested convention, and, unfortunately, it eliminates the drama of dropping the name at the convention. But it would pretty well guarantee that the news from the convention would not be dominated by questions about the vice presidential selection.\n\nJesper on Chrome ★\n\n“Google Chrome is a funny creature.”\n\nHow Far Along Is Chrome for Mac? ★\n\nGoogle engineer Amanda Walker on the status of Mac (and Linux) versions of Chrome:\n\nRight now, both are in the “pieces build and pass tests, but there’s no Chromium application yet.” While we’re working hard and fast on catching up to the Windows version, we’re not setting an artificial date for when they’ll be ready—we simply can’t predict enough to make a solid estimate, and we expect to learn a lot from the Windows public beta as well.\n\nIn other words, not very far along.\n\nChrome UI Notes ★\n\nI don’t have a copy of Windows handy, so I haven’t used Chrome yet. Just gleaning from the screenshots and from notes John Siracusa (who is using it) sent me via IM:\n\nOverall, the UI takes minimalism much further than Safari. Google has rethought far more of the standard “web browser” conventions that we’ve been saddled with since Netscape 1.0.\n\nNo menu bar. Just two pop-up menus in the toolbar: a “document” and a “wrench”.\n\nNo persistent status bar. Just a “status bubble” that pops up contextually.\n\nTab dragging works the way I wish Safari’s did: you can drag a tab out of a window no matter which direction you initially drag, but there are 40 pixels of vertical slop space before it switches from “rearrange tabs within window” to “move to another window” mode.\n\nNo bookmarks menu or window. You create bookmarks by clicking the “star” button in the toolbar; after that, you retrieve them by typing their name, URL, or text from the page content in the location field.\n\nChromium Developer Documentation ★\n\nDeveloper documentation for Google’s new Chrome browser. Most interesting to me is the User Experience section:\n\nIn the long term, we think of Chromium as a tabbed window manager or shell for the web rather than a browser application. We avoid putting things into our UI in the same way you would hope that Apple and Microsoft would avoid putting things into the standard window frames of applications on their operating systems.\n\nGoogle Chrome vs. Safari 3.1 Rendering Comparison ★\n\nFaruk Ates compares the just-released Google Chrome to Safari 3.1 for Windows:\n\nSadly, it seems the WebKit build that Google Chrome uses has been mutilated to an extent: the text-shadow property has been stripped out (Why?!) and, worse, the CSS border-radius rendering is not anti-aliased (Why?!?!).\n\nGmail Account Hacking Tool ★\n\nThis is why it matters that MobileMe’s web apps don’t use SSL.\n\nPleaseDressMe ★\n\nNew t-shirt search engine.\n\nAnnual New iPod Event: Next Week ★\n\n“Let’s Rock” is the invitation theme.\n\nGetting Closure With Objective-C ★\n\nDrew McCormack on the new “blocks” feature Apple is adding to C and Objective-C.\n\nKiller Kowalski, Wrestler, Dies at 81 ★\n\nOne of the original stars of professional wrestling."
