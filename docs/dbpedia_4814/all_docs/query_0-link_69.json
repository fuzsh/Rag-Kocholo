        "text": "(CBS) - Little monsters, rejoice! Disney's Tapulous just launched Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" Revenge, a music-tapping game for the iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nThe game will set you back $4.99, but provides minutes of pleasure (or perhaps hours if you've got a lot of time on your hands). All players have to do is tap the touchscreen in tandem with the rhythm of the song as little triangles speed across. Sounds like mindless fun to us!\n\nAlthough Tapulous has already created other Lady Gaga games, this is the first one with social features, like the ability to connect to Gaga's Facebook page and Twitter feed, chat with fellow fans, get lyrics, find Gaga-related events, and receive updates on other Gaga games.\n\nLady Gaga sure knows how to keep in touch with fans. No wonder she beat Oprah Winfrey on Forbes' \"Most Powerful Celebrities\" list!\n\nAre you going to tap to Lady Gaga?"
