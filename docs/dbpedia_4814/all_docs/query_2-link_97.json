        "text": "\"In 2013, online radio reached 45% of the US population but only 13% of the Japanese population (Arbitron 2013; RIAJ 2013). Why had the development of online radio and music streaming followed divergent trajectories in these two countries? Based on interviews with media executives, consumer surveys, and strategic analysis, this chapter posits that differences in the conception of traditional radio, as well as business practices, led to higher acceptance of online radio and music streaming in the US than in Japan. In the US, the existing culture of listening to radio as a passive music player, coupled with rapid diffusion of the smartphone, fueled the growth of services such as Pandora and Slacker. As recounted by Pandora founder Tim Westergren and Slacker vice president Jonathan Sasse, these two services operated under different conceptions of online radio—the former as a way to discover music of similar attributes, the other as a curated experience—which were reflected in their marketing and their methods for building playlists. In Japan, the diffusion of smartphones lagged that in the US, as they were initially not so attractive for either cell phone carriers, who found feature phones more profitable, or consumers, who already enjoyed high functionality on their feature phones. Radio was not as popular a medium in Japan as in the US, and music programs on radio were more focused on talk than in the US. The lack of statutory licenses for online radio and the reluctance of record companies to provide music to streaming services also hampered growth. The chapter is based on research in 2009–10, with a postscript on conditions in 2013. A short conference paper that summarizes the findings and updates them can be seen at https://www.academia.edu/6879626/Online_Radio_How_Markets_in_Japan_and_the_US_Hear_Things_Differently ."
