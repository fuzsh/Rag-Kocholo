        "text": "QUESTION:\n\nI don’t want to waste time on angels who aren’t actively investing. Who are the most active angels and super angels? What’s the best way to find out this type of information?\n\nANSWER:\n\nby Naomi Kokubo, Cofounder of LavaMind\n\nAs a rule of thumb, people investing other people’s money tend to more active than people investing their own money. Naturally, we’re always more cautious with our own bank account.\n\nThat said, here are some of the more active angels and super angels:\n\nJeff Clavier (Investor in Mint)\n\nMatt Mullenweg (Angel in DailyBurn)\n\nGeorge Zachary (Charles River)\n\nChris Yeh (Angel in EtherPad)\n\nJeff Fagnan (Atlas)\n\nBrian Norgard (Angel in ad.ly)\n\nMike Hirshland (Polaris)\n\nAlex Finkelstein (Spark Capital)\n\nDavid Cohen (Techstars)\n\nBill Lee (Angel in Posterous)\n\nMichael Dearing (Angel in Aardvark)\n\nRob Go (Spark Capital)\n\nRichard Chen (Angel in Aardvark)\n\nJoe Greenstein (Angel in Eventbrite)\n\nAnn Miura-Ko (Investor in Modcloth)\n\nAndrew Parker (Union Square Ventures)\n\nJon Callaghan (Investor in Meebo)\n\nHo Nam (Investor in JS-Kit)\n\nRob Lord (Investor in Grockit)\n\nPejman Nozad (Investor in Dropbox)\n\nFadi Bishara (Investor in Bebo)\n\nThomas Korte (Investor in Heroku)\n\nSalil Deshpande (Investor in Engine Yard)\n\nMark Suster (Investor in awe.sm)\n\nPeter Chane (Investor in Aardvark)\n\nSaar Gur (Investor in Admob)\n\nDharmesh Shah (Investor in Backupify)\n\nThomas McInerney (Investor in Mochi Media)\n\nAaron Patzer (Investor in Milo)\n\nPhineas Barnes (First Round Capital)\n\nShervin Pishevar (Investor in Gowalla)\n\nGabriel Weinberg (Investor in Wakemate)\n\nDavid Cowan (Top 10 on Forbes Midas List)\n\nBijan Sabet (Investor in Twitter)\n\nBob Shapiro (Sandbox Industries)\n\nChris Sheehan (Investor in Carbonite)\n\nSim Simeonov (Investor in Veracode)\n\nSatish Dharmaraj (Investor in Posterous)\n\nKeith Rabois (Investor in YouTube)\n\nManu Kumar (Investor in CrowdFlower)\n\nAngel List:\n\nhttp://angel.co/\n\nBloomberg Top Angel Investors:\n\nhttp://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/future_of_tech_2010.html\n\nMORE MATERIAL:\n\nThis article just came out in San Francisco Magazine:\n\nhttp://www.sanfranmag.com/story/25-tech-angels-11-good-angels-and-18-geeks-everyone-wants-fly-with\n\nThe 25 tech angels, 11 good angels, and 18 geeks everyone wants to fly with\n\nBy Nic Buron, Justine Sharrock, and Diana Kapp\n\nArchangels\n\nThese guys have the power to swoop in from on high and grab the deals that lesser angels can only envy.\n\nMarc Andreessen\n\nAndreessen Horowitz\n\nHow big is his fund: $950 million total, in two funds.\n\nCred: Serves on boards of eBay and Facebook; chairman at Ning, which he cofounded in 2005; cofounder of Netscape, which launched the dot-com boom.\n\nSeeds: 28 currently (before that, he and cofounder Ben Horowitz invested in many other companies going back to 2004).\n\nHow he thinks: “I sit down at my desk before I go to sleep, pull up my to-do list…and pick out the 3 to 5 things I am going to get done tomorrow. I write those things on a fresh 3×5 card, lay the card out with my car keys, and go to bed. Then, the next day, I try like hell to get just those things done. If I do, it was a successful day.”\n\nSuper bets: Aliph; Linked­In; Twitter; Foursquare.\n\nTwitter followers: 3,898.\n\nTypical tweet: His one and only tweet, back in 2007, was “twittering!”\n\nRon Conway\n\nSV Angel\n\nHow big is his fund: $20 million.\n\nCred: A rep so towering that 5,000 or so people refer deals to him.\n\nSeeds: 500, with more than 200 exits.\n\nHow he thinks: “I love it when we invest in a company with an 18-year-old because it’s going to be much more exciting. The world is their oyster, and anything’s possible in their minds. That is the best entrepreneur ever.”\n\nSuper bets: Google; PayPal; Ask Jeeves; Good Technology; Facebook; Zappos. (But he turned down Salesforce.com, to his eternal regret.)\n\nTwitter followers: 1,953—though he has yet to tweet.\n\nReid Hoffman\n\nGreylock Partners\n\nHow big is his fund: $20 million of Greylock’s money to play around with.\n\nCred: Cofounder of LinkedIn; former exec at PayPal.\n\nSeeds: 80+ investments (and that’s pre-Greylock).\n\nHow he thinks: “Few business plans ever pan out like their owners intend. PayPal started as a plan to beam payments between Palm Pilots…. After five minutes of a pitch, I know if I’m not going to invest, and after 30 minutes to an hour, I generally know if I will.”\n\nSuper bets: Facebook; Zynga; Digg; Flickr.\n\nTwitter followers: 16,015.\n\nTypical tweet: “What is hard about making decisions: making decisions reduces opportunity in the short term. but decisions mean long term opportunity.”\n\nPeter Thiel\n\nFounders Fund\n\nHow big is his fund: $250 million.\n\nCred: Cofounder of PayPal; first outside investor in Facebook.\n\nSeeds: Hard to say, but 36 through Founders Fund alone.\n\nHow he thinks: “The angel-VC thing feels very crowded. To invest, you want to always be fundamental and contrarian, and while I think there’s a fundamental story of how the Internet’s going to grow,\n\nit’s not as contrarian as it was three or four years ago.”\n\nSuper bets: Facebook; Twilio; SpaceX; Spotify.\n\nTwitter followers: 420, also without posting a single tweet.\n\nSuper angels\n\nVets of some of web 2.0’s biggest success stories, they’ve proved over and over that they still know how to pick ’em—for themselves and for their investors.\n\nSteve Anderson\n\nBaseline Ventures\n\nHow big is his fund: Unknown.\n\nCred: Kleiner Perkins; Starbucks; Microsoft; eBay.\n\nSeeds: 37.\n\nHit rate: 10 exits.\n\nHow he thinks: “Don’t worry so much about figuring out the ‘path’….Make decisions. Go. Try.”\n\nSuper bets: Twitter (which acquired another of his bets, Mixer Labs); Aardvark (sold to Google); Parakey (to Facebook); Formspring; Rupture (to Electronic Arts).\n\nTwitter followers: 542.\n\nTypical tweet: “Quote from an iPhone dev: ‘Apple is like the drunk abusive husband. you never know when they are going to come home drunk and smash skulls.’ ”\n\nJeff Clavier\n\nSoftTech VC\n\nHow big is his fund: $15 million.\n\nCred: 22 years in enterprise software as an entrepreneur, senior exec, or VC; dubbed one of the 13 “Web 2.0 King Makers” by the late Business 2.0.\n\nSeeds: 59 since 2007.\n\nHit rate: 16 exits.\n\nHow he thinks: “We help people fulfill their dreams and, if we can, make some money along the way.”\n\nSuper bets: Mint (sold to Intuit for $170 million); Userplane (to AOL); MyBlogLog (to Yahoo!); Kaboodle (to Hearst); Maya’s Mom (to John­son & Johnson’s BabyCenter).\n\nTwitter followers: 12,055.\n\nTypical tweet: “I just ousted @ifindkarma as the mayor of Gyros Gyros on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/6cFXFb.”\n\nMichael Dearing\n\nHarrison Metal\n\nHow big is his fund: He won’t say.\n\nCred: Ex-eBay top exec; Stanford prof; “the start­up whisperer.”\n\nSeeds: 29 portfolio companies on the Harrison Metal site.\n\nHit rate: 5 of those 29 have been acquired.\n\nHow he thinks: Friendly but notoriously tight-lipped—you have to take one of his courses (sample title: “Creating Infectious Action”) to find out.\n\nSuper bets: AdMob, Aardvark, and DocVerse (all acquired by Google); Xoopit (by Yahoo!); Mixer Labs.\n\nTwitter followers: 564.\n\nTypical tweet: “Open tweet to @mikebloomberg: Please can’t you come to California and be the governor?”\n\nMike Maples\n\nFloodGate Fund\n\nHow big is his fund: $73.5 million.\n\nCred: One of Fortune’s “Eight Rising VC Stars” in 2008.\n\nSeeds: 38.\n\nHit rate: 6 exits.\n\nHow he thinks: Referencing Godzilla, he looks for “Thunderlizards”—“a company that disrupts its industry, earns a 100-fold return, and makes up for all of a fund’s bad bets.” But of consumer Web 2.0, he warns: “It’s starting to get a little played out.”\n\nSuper bets: Chegg (textbook rental site); Digg; Twitter; partnering with Stanford lecturer Ann Miura-Ko (according to Forbes, “the most powerful woman in startups”). He was also an entrepreneur in a broadband-software play that IPO’d in ’04. But nobody’s perfect—he passed on Zynga.\n\nTwitter followers: 3,654.\n\nTypical tweet: “Pondering: which eagles song was better ‘sad cafe’ or ‘new kid in town’? A very tough call…”\n\nDave McClure\n\n500 Startups\n\nHow big is his fund: He’s raising $30 million.\n\nCred: One of those PayPal mafiosos.\n\nSeeds: 100 in the past 2.5 years.\n\nHit rate: 6 exits.\n\nHow he thinks: “Invest early at low cost in people who you think are smart and have built some promising products, know how to iterate, and understand conversion metrics.”\n\nSuper bet: Mint.\n\nTwitter followers: 36,373.\n\nTypical tweet: “so if i make the Economist as a SuperVillain/SuperDevil VC, should i still show my Mom? #JustSpellMyNameRight.”\n\nNaval Ravikant\n\nHow big is his fund: $22 million.\n\nCred: Epinions founder and serial entrepreneur.\n\nSeeds: 50.\n\nHit rate: 5 exits.\n\nHow he thinks: To paraphrase: Have humility; be dispassionate; build your personal brand; don’t move in a herd but do be a pack animal. And remember: Not everyone has all the information.\n\nSuper bet: Twitter.\n\nTwitter followers: 4,014.\n\nTypical tweet: “4:30AM EDT. Brain shutting down. Heart rate slowing. Fingers going numb. But somehow…still tweeting.”\n\nChris Sacca\n\nLowercase Capital\n\nHow big is his fund: He’s cagey about details, but he claims funds in excess of $200 million.\n\nCred: Google’s former head of special initiatives; “possibly the most influential businessman in America,” says the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSeeds: 40.\n\nHit rate: Says he doesn’t keep count, then adds, “I have had substantially more money come out than go in.”\n\nHow he thinks: “I only work with teams I’m proud to work with.”\n\nSuper bets: Twitter; DailyBooth; Posterous; 280 North (acquired by Motorola).\n\nTwitter followers: 1,305,712.\n\nTypical tweet: “I bust Zuck’s balls frequently, as you all know.

Mercenaries are motivated by financial statements; missionaries are all about value state­ments. Mercenaries have got an incredible lust for making money; missionaries are interested in making meaning—and also money.”\n\nKevin Efrusy\n\nAccel Partners\n\nHow big: $1 billion to invest in the U.S. alone.\n\nCred: Former Kleiner Perkins entrepreneur-in-residence; former CEO of IronPlanet (annual gross $500 million); brought Facebook to Accel.\n\nVC deals: Groupon; BranchOut; Metacafe (whose cofounder Eyal Hertzog has said, “Working with [Efrusy] is the first time I’m getting real value-add from a VC”).\n\nHow he thinks: “You have to pick your poison, take risks, and stick your neck out—that’s what our business is about….We try to do things that are really, really early and help build these teams when we can.”\n\nSameer Gandhi\n\nAccel Partners\n\nHow big: $480 million in Accel’s growth fund alone.\n\nCred: Former Sequoia Capital partner; led deals with eHarmony and Gracenote (sold to Sony for $260 million).\n\nVC deals: Dropbox; StumbleUpon; Quidsi (parent company of Diapers.com and Soap.com).\n\nHow he thinks: Must be the strong, silent type, because we couldn’t find a single quote worth printing.\n\nGreg McAdoo\n\nSequoia Capital\n\nHow big: Sits on 9 boards.\n\nCred: Former president and CEO of Sentient Networks (acquired by Cisco, alongside another company, for $445 million).\n\nVC deals: Bump; ImageShack; Loopt; PowerFile; RockYou—and the hottest incubator out there, Y Combinator.\n\nHow he thinks: “At the end of the day, without that great [market] wave, even if you’re a great entrepreneur, you’re not going to build a really great business.” The company should be able “to create an inferno with a single match.”\n\nDavid Weiden\n\nKhosla Ventures\n\nHow big: The firm is huge; as an individual angel, he’s planning at least four deals at about $500,000 each this year (or so he told AngelList).\n\nCred: Worked with what are now T-Mobile and Verizon while at Morgan Stanley in the ’90s; early employee at Netscape and AOL; advises Slide (recently bought by Google for $228 million).\n\nVC deals: Bitfone; Good Technology; Ingenio; LogMeIn; Opsware; Tellme; iLike.\n\nHow he thinks: “My perspective on angel and VC investors is shaped by my own experiences as an entrepreneur on the firing line, trying to get revenue in the door.” He looks for “companies [that] aspire to be worth billions.”\n\nSoaring angels\n\nYoung, rich, and very smart, these solo investors can spot a great idea a mile away. the goal isn’t necessarily to get richer, though they’d be fine with that.\n\nChristina Brodbeck\n\nCred: YouTube’s first user-interface designer; preparing to launch TheIceBreak (“I can’t give too many details, but it’s relationship focused”).\n\nDeals to date: 7.\n\nHow she thinks: “I like to invest in things that are fun—it’s a big thing for me.”\n\nBest bets: Greplin; HeyZap; InDinero.\n\nPaul Buchheit\n\nCred: Hire number 23 at Google (where he created Gmail and coined the company’s “Don’t be evil” mantra); founded FriendFeed and sold it to Facebook; currently working at Facebook.\n\nDeals to date: Around 50, with 10 or so exits.\n\nHow he thinks: “There’s a tendency for [angel wannabes] to say, ‘Wow, that’s really great’ and want to put in all their money. You shouldn’t invest anything that you would mind losing.”\n\nBest bets: 280 North; Y Combinator; Opzi; Rapportive; ReMail (acquired by Google); AppJet (ditto); Optimizely.\n\nDave Morin\n\nCred: Ex-Facebook and -Apple; CEO of Napster founder Shawn Fanning’s hot new startup, Path.\n\nDeals to date: 18.\n\nHow he thinks: “Technology will continue to move faster than our ability to set public policy within our current processes.
