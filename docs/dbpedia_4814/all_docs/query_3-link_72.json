This will work on ipod touch as well (suburb precision).\n\nIt's literally 10 lines of code and the javascript will work without change on Firefox 3.5. Far easier than scrape some third party website.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can't do what you want directly.\n\nThe best idea I can come up with is to \"reuse\" an iPhone app that records location and makes it accessible on the web. Take Twitter for example. If I'm not mistaken, Tapulous' app Twinkle will grab your location and post it to your Twitter.com user profile. Here's an example of what that looks like:\n\nFrom your webapp, you could then scrape the user page for each person whose location you're interested in. It's a pain in the butt, but like I said, this is the best I could come up with.\n\nAgain, if you don't want to mess with Twitter, there may be other apps out there that do this as well, but I don't personally know of any. Good luck."
