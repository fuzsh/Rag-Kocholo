        "text": "Last month saw Breaktime Studios step up to the plate after Kiloo Games kicked things off in October. Rounding out 2012 with yet another stellar developer partner is Get Set Games, the maker of the fantastically addictive “Mega” series and one of the best licensed games we’ve seen on the App Store with Monsters, Inc. Run.\n\nWe’ve once again partnered with PocketGamer.biz to shed a bit more light on our Developer Spotlight. They sat down with Nick Coombe, co-founder of Get Set Games to discuss their partnership with Disney, why they love Chartboost and quite a bit more.\n\nQuestion: Get Set has always been a fairly indie-minded studio so what was your first reaction when Disney approached you?\n\nNick Coombe, Co-Founder, Get Set Games: Our goal has always been to make the games that we want to make, and to grow carefully and steadily building up our own IP. Mega Run, Mega Jump and our little red hero Redford are strong games and characters that we want to build on, and we had, and have exciting new plans for those games. That was our roadmap, alongside plans for other new projects, just after we launched Mega Run at the end of May.\n\nThe Disney Pixar proposal came out of the blue and caught us by surprise in the summer after we’d launched our first update for Mega Run.\n\nThere are so many horror stories about little guys working with big companies that it did give us pause. On the other hand Keith and Natalya at Imangi had a good experience working with Disney, and Temple Run: Brave did (and is still doing) very well for them. Disney also has a very successful track record on the App Store, so we knew we’d learn a lot from the collaboration.\n\nSecondly, we’d be using Mega Run as the base for Monsters, Inc. Run, so that was a known quantity. If the proposal had been to create a brand new game, the decision would have been much harder. We figured the tie-in could also only help get more visibility for Mega Run in the long run, as it were, so that would be a good thing.\n\nThird, the game was targeted for release around the launch of Monsters, Inc. 3D, so that meant an 8 week (at the time) dev cycle! It seemed slightly insane to try and produce a Disney/Pixar quality game under that pressure, but at the same time it meant we weren’t looking at carving half a year out of our in-house dev time. If the project didn’t work out, we wouldn’t have lost too much time.\n\nThe last hurdle really was in finding out how the partnership would work. As it turned out Disney was straightforward and put us very much on an equal footing with them for the development of the project, even to the extent of giving us the lead on how the game was designed and developed. Disney put their trust in our ability to execute on the project and make the core decisions on gameplay, features and design, so we felt ownership of the project, which was crucial for us. Bart Decrem and Ed Baraf at Disney really helped seal the deal because it was clear that they were excited about the project and that they trusted us to be able to do a good job with the game, which I think we did, judging by the reviews for Monsters, Inc. Run.\n\nGiven your success with Mega Jump and Mega Run, what’s the reason to work with a company like Disney? Is it just the cash?\n\nAs much as we all love Monsters, Inc. and Pixar in general (we’re all big fans of the studio), and the idea of working on a game based on the movie was really exciting to us, we were hesitant at first. Like many indie companies that have done well, we’ve had pressure to sell the company, or work with publishers and what have you. We’ve always turned down those offers because, as lucrative as they might have been in the short term, they were counter to our goal of owning our work and our future. When the Disney offer came along, we discussed the pros and cons as a team, and debated about whether it would be good for us and our other projects – after all, this would be an outside company telling us what to do and how to do it. Or so we might have thought.\n\nAs we learned more about the proposal, and the fact that this would be a partnership, not a white-label deal, and that we would be able to design the game as we saw fit, and that the guys at Disney Mobile were just as passionate (and nerdy) about games as we are, then the equation changed.\n\nOne draw was the fact that, as a small company in equal partnership with Disney for this project, we knew that this would help shine a spotlight on us and get visibility for our own games, and that could only be a good thing. That was predicated on making a good game, however, and we wouldn’t be satisfied with just creating a phoned-in movie-licensed game, so our highest priority was to make the best game we could in the time we had. If people liked it, it would help our other games as well, and I think we achieved that.\n\nYes, the potential revenue was good (although not guaranteed, especially if the game was terrible) – that shouldn’t to be discounted, but we’re quite comfortable as it is with our own games. The biggest benefit for us in the long term was that we knew we would learn a huge amount from the partnership and the process. Disney Mobile has had a string of hit games with Where’s My Water, Where’s My Perry, Tap Tap Revenge (with Tapulous), Temple Run: Brave etc. They know what they’re doing, and we still have a lot to learn in terms of process, production, promotion, you name it. And learn we did.\n\nCreating Monsters, Inc. Run was a formative experience for us. It validated a lot of what we’ve learned over the past year working on Mega Run, and it taught us a lot about scheduling, quality control and teamwork that will prove to be invaluable in future. Mostly though, it proved to us as a team of 10 that we could turn around a project we could be proud of in 10 weeks with minimal changes to our original plan. That was a big success for us.\n\nGet Set has always been quick to experiment with business models - F2P, Kiip, Chartboost etc so what’s your current thinking about how small studios can monetise best across iOS and Android?\n\nThe market is always changing, so there’s never one surefire way to make money on the app store. That being said, it looks like free to play is here to stay (and that’s all I have to…say?). This is especially true on Android, where paid games tend to suffer. We actually can’t say enough good things about the reach and inclusivity that free to play brings.\n\nPaid games have a place – it’s how games have always been sold until now, and should be an option even for smaller devs, although it is a tougher market to crack when you’re just starting out. There’s also an element of prestige that goes along with paid games (even at 99c or 69p!), that free games somehow lose out on. We’re excited to have created a paid game in the form of Monsters, Inc. Run; we think it’s appropriate and that the game can compete with the other big games on the paid charts since Monsters, Inc. Run features well-loved characters and is based on a well-loved game, so people know it’ll be a good purchase.\n\nHere’s where I come out swinging for the free to play option though: paid games are a gamble for players. They are like an exclusive club with an entrance fee, and a lot of people aren’t willing to take the risk to get in, which is understandable. Free games, on the other hand, have to live or die on their own merits, since players can figuratively walk away. There’s no barrier to entry, which also means free to play games are more inclusive, and can reach far, far more people. I think it’s important to emphasize the positives of free games for small devs, because the reach can be so crucial, especially when you’re just starting out, and if you do it the right way.\n\nWe love the fact that kids who have run out of pocket money (or are saving it for something else) can still download and play our games, and we don’t care if they don’t pay a penny. If players like our games, they’ll tell a friend or two and we’ll reach more people and make more people happy, and in the end we’ll generate more revenue that way and grow a huge and happy fan base to boot. Like most free to play games, a tiny fraction of players actually pay any money for, or in, our games. And that’s fine.\n\nWhat it means though, is that we can’t aggressively promote our games by throwing money around. There’s no ad budget for free to play when it costs more to get a player to download your game than you’ll ever make back from them. Networks like Chartboost have been invaluable for us in that regard. Using Chartboost we’ve been able to cross-promote with other partners via click-exchange, essentially, and reach huge numbers of people via a quid-pro-quo arrangement with developers we work well with. Chartboost also generates healthy revenue for us via interstitials that we run (very minimally) in our games.\n\nWe also run opt-in video ads from Flurry, Ad Colony and Vungle that work well for us. The nice thing about those is that players never have to see them unless they choose to, but they still generate good revenue, so everybody’s happy.\n\nKiip has been great for the feel-good factor, and they’ve run some great competitions (including Guinness Book of Records attempts and some big-prize giveaways), giving out real-world prizes willy-nilly to our players for doing well in the game, which players really seem to like!\n\nWe’re always on the look-out for ways to promote our games with a zero dollar budget, and generate revenue in ways that aren’t awful or force the player to pay for things they shouldn’t have to. We could probably make more money by being more aggressive with our IAP or in-game advertising, but we’re gamers and we hate that stuff too, so we try to keep it respectful and appropriate, so that players know that they have a choice and so that the IAP or monetization options don’t get in the way of the game, which always comes first.\n\nHow active are you in terms of metrics/analytics and feeding back results into your games?\n\nWe do generate a lot of anonymous data from our games, which has been very useful, but to be honest we think we could do more with it. Next year we’re going to be more pro-active with our data to try and improve our games (for instance to see where people are struggling, or what feature players use the most). We’ve already started making changes to our games based on some of the metrics, and to put the focus of new feature updates on to things that players will appreciate the most.\n\nHow important is cross promotion between your games and can you pony up any numbers that back up your no-doubt positive general assertions?\n\nCross promotion is really our best bet as far as free to play goes, and we rely on it along with word of mouth to gain new players. It’s one of the few viable options for small company giving away games for free. We used to cross-promote “manually” using our home-brewed system for a while, and that worked quite well, but over time we noticed that this upstart company called Chartboost was making a bit of noise among developers we worked with so we looked into it. Hooking in to the Chartboost network has really helped to take a huge amount of the legwork out of the process, which saves us time and money. We don’t have a marketing department. We have one guy, so that really helps. In general, on a weekly basis we send hundreds of thousands of clicks to and from our games via cross promos, so yes, it’s effective!\n\nWhat are your plans for 2013? Is it time for a new Mega game yet?\n\nWell at least one of our games is getting a little long in the tooth, so we’re about overdue for a jump-start there perhaps. 2012 was a phenomenal year for Get Set, and we think 2013 could be even better, including for Android players, who have been neglected for too long! We’re very excited for what we have planned.\n\nHappy New Year, everyone! After last week’s big news we’ve now returned with our sixth installment of everyone’s favorite series. The aim of What We’re Playing is to shine some light on games that might otherwise go unnoticed and to give you a peek into our twisted definition of “fun” when it comes to mobile games.\n\nOne thing to note: While we here at Chartboost truly do love our game developer partners and play just about every game that uses our technology, not every game you see here will be a partner title. This is what we play when we’re home from the office with our feet up on the couch looking for a bit of gaming R&R.\n\nHave a game we should be playing but aren’t? Tell us about it @Chartboost.\n\n*Look at that cell phone! Those were the days…\n\nDevon McLaughlin - Business Development Extern\n\nPlaying Tilt to Live by One Man Left Studios\n\nAn oldie but a goodie, this tilt-based game has had me hooked since the days before I had a smartphone when I would ask my friends to let me play on their phones. With five game modes, there is enough to keep you entertained for a long time, but the basic object is to tilt the arrow around the screen to destroy the red dots using the various power ups. This game is very fast-paced and challenging, and it has unique and entertaining commentary in all of the load screens. The only downside is that since this game relies on very precise tilts, playing in a car or on a subway is extremely challenging.\n\nNate Barker - Publisher Relations Manager\n\n@kneyght\n\nPlaying Middle Manager of Justice by Double Fine Productions\n\nI’m tired of super heroes getting all the credit. Seriously, anyone can don some ill-fitting spandex and throw themselves in the way of a few villainous punches. Nowadays, real talent lies in developing the budding Batmen and sophmoric Superwomen of today into the venerated vindicators of tomorrow. Middle Manager of Justice allows you to accomplish just that. The game borrows elements from simulation games like Hayday and RPGs like Pokemon. In the game you hire, train, and deploy super heroes to crime hotspots. Along the way, you fight evil bosses, collect coins to upgrade your team, and clean up the town.\n\nThe real trick is managing the time of multiple heroes, who often join the organization at different experience levels. You also get to upgrade yourself (the manager) with fun abilities like “Pep Talk” and “Paradigm Shift.”\n\nThis fun title could use a little more story overall, but the hours spent vanquishing evil and perfecting my super-team kept me extremely entertained.\n\nSachin Goel - Coding Things and Eating Wings\n\n@sachingoel\n\nPlaying Earn to Die by Not Doppler\n\nEarn to Die is not the first game to get on the zombie-crazed bandwagon, however it brings an interesting take of the genre to the table and kept me entertained for a couple of days. The game starts out in a zombie infested West Texas and challenges you make your way to the escape location in Washington State by plowing over said zombies with increasingly violent vehicles and guns over a series of levels. Unfortunately, the game is rather short but there is an option to replay the levels with the modified cars that you acquired during the game. Earn to Die is definitely worth the buck if you need to satisfy your zombie slaying cravings.\n\nBoram Lee - Korea Account Manager\n\nPlaying Anipang for Kakao by Sundaytoz\n\nIt’s the game that attracted huge attention (#1 in Korea for longest time) and also made the SMS platform Kakao Talk become profitable and popular among Korean game developers. The game itself is simple - it’s a casual puzzle game where you match 3 or more identical characters by moving characters left, right, up, or down. Each game is limited to only 60 sec. You have to move your fingers fast to score highest possible points in the given timeframe. It’s also fun as you get to compare with your friends’ score and you can also send heart-shaped bonuses to your friends - some people even use it to reconnect with their exes…\n\nCori Savaiano - Publisher Relations Manager\n\n@crunkboost\n\nPlaying Hungry Shark Evolution by Future Games of London\n\nI’ve been pouring hours of “research” this week into Hungry Shark Evolution. In the game, you’re a ferocious shark roaming the dark depths and sea shores for schools of fish, sea turtles, and sun bathing tourists to satiate your appetite. Too long between a meal and you’ll starve to death. As you progress, you can level your tiny reef shark up through tiger sharks and finally, the great white. But really, this game is all about eating tourists.\n\nNate Ahearn - Marketing Manager\n\n@Nate_Ahearn\n\nPlaying Temple Run 2 by Imangi Studios\n\nThe first Temple Run was largely responsible for starting the endlress runner craze that still permeates the mobile gaming world today. It may not have been the first of its kind, but it sure was the best. Now Imangi is back with a new rendition, and while it doesn’t turn the endless runner on its head, there’s no doubt that it’s a much prettier, more refined package than the first time around.\n\nThe first thing that will strike players is the visual upgrade. It’s a true leap forward with enhanced lighting, some very nice texture work and - get this - paths that actually curve and change altitudes. Not exactly mind-melting material, but it provides enough differentiation from the first to warrant the entry fee of zero dollars. Just when you thought you’d never have a reason to delete the first Temple Run from your phone, Imangi gives us the best reason yet to do so.\n\nThanks for reading! Check back in two weeks for our next installment of What We’re Playing! Until then, be sure to hit us up on Twitter @Chartboost.\n\nWe’re kicking off 2013 with one of our favorite developers from across the pond, Neon Play, located in Cirencester, UK. They’re behind iOS games like The Big Quiz series, Carpark Carnage, Traffic Panic London and many, many more.\n\nOli Christie, CEO of Neon Play, was nice enough to take some time to answer some of our questions about his company, his games, and he even imparted some knowledge to help other mobile game developers that are just starting out. Read on for all the juicy details.\n\nChartboost: What do you LOVE about making games?\n\nOli Christie, Neon Play: I always say to my team that if you can’t enjoying making games for a living, then you’re in the wrong industry or you need your head tested. Quite simply, we’re all just very lucky to have the skills to make games as it’s a wonderful job to have - hugely fun, very rewarding and always interesting. There aren’t many careers where you create products which have to be fun, so we’re blessed to be paid to do this.\n\nI love the process of coming up with a good idea that is simple enough to be picked up quickly and addicitve enough to keep people coming back time after time. I love the art side of the process where the look and feel of the game seems right for the target audience and the game. And I love making a game playable and the feeling where you know you’ve cracked it.\n\nWhat’s the most important thing you’ve learned about your users since you started Neon Play?\n\nThey’re unpredictable! When we started Neon Play in 2010, we had a strategy to build different genres of games for different users. Sports games like Flick Football and Golf Putt Pro; casual games like Paper Glider and Crazy Copter; shooting games like Bravo Force: Last Stand; and car games like Traffic Panic London.\n\nThe reviews you get sometimes make you proud of the work you’ve done, sometimes they make you angry with the sheer stupidity of what people are saying, and sometimes you get really valuable feedback. It’s filtering the important bits that is key.\n\nBut having had over 45 million downloads in under 3 years, it’s hugely rewarding that we’ve got our games into millions and millions of people’s hands all around the world.\n\nTraffic Panic London\n\nAs you’ve built your company, what’s the one special thing that makes Neon Play different from other gaming companies out there?\n\nI believe our culture and ethos has helped us grow into a strong and close-knit studio in the untraditional gaming hub that is Cirencester in the Cotswolds in the UK.\n\nWhen I started the company, I knew I wanted to build a company where people were the most important thing and we respected the fact that everyone, no matter how junior or senior, had good ideas - everything was up for discussion and the best idea would win.\n\nClick here to read all about our company culture.\n\nWe also created a list of 10 reasons to join Neon Play, which included a posh bog roll guarantee, your birthday as a free day off, free beer on Fridays and we give 1% of our profits to local charities. These 10 reasons have proved really popular. Click here to read the full list.\n\nIf you could give one piece of advice to a game developer that’s just starting out, what would it be?\n\nI think it’s the best job in the world when everything is going well, but I have to say that the mobile market has got hugely competitive in the last two years and without decent funding, a stunningly unique standout game or bucketloads of luck, it will be hard to succeed in 2013.\n\nNew starters need to thoroughlly research the market before they create a new game, work out ways to monetise a free game with a deep and long-lasting experiences and do all they can to get editorial coverage with Apple and Google, which are the two stores currently worth launching for.\n\nBravo Force: Last Stand\n\nWhat are the markets you’re focusing on? Any interesting trends you’ve seen when looking at users around the world?\n\nTo date, we’ve focussed on the main global territories and the majority of our games have only been in English. But our latest game will be translated into all the EFIGS countries, plus Russian, Chinese, Japanese, etc, so we will be truly targeting all markets.\n\nClearly the emerging BRIC markets are exciting new areas of growth, and Asia is an untapped market for us with monster potential, as is the whole booming smartphone market.\n\nWhy are you working with Chartboost? What makes us stand out from the rest?\n\nChartboost has created a service that is just what mobile developers were crying out for. The ability to cross-promote your own games, do install swaps with other developers, plus earn revenue from your inventory, which makes for a strong product.\n\nOn top of that, everyone at Chartboost we’ve worked with are friendly, decent, fun people and those are the sort of companies we like working with.\n\nGive us a glimpse into one of your upcoming projects for 2013. What can people expect from Neon Play?\n\nWell boringly, it’s all a little bit top secret, but we are working on a much larger game than we’ve ever done before and we truly believe it will make big waves in the mobile and games industry.\n\nWhile we make that game, we are also working on a series of Big Quiz apps (launched through our sister developer Jick Jack) and these are starting to make some good traction. To date, we have the Big Movie Quiz, Big App Quiz, Big Celeb Quiz, with the Big Book Quiz about to launch as well. They’re a well-branded series of apps and we really hope and believe they will catch on.\n\nClick here to see the Big Movie Quiz.\n\nBig thanks to Oli and the whole Neon Play team for their time. Check back at the end of February for the next installment in our Developer Spotlight series!\n\nThe series everyone loves to love is back with its seventh installment! We’ve been busy this month with our Chartboost University: Boot Camp announcement as well as featuring Neon Play in our January Developer Spotlight.\n\nFor those that don’t know (shame on you), the aim of What We’re Playing is to shine some light on games that might otherwise go unnoticed and to give you a peek into our twisted definition of “fun” when it comes to mobile games. One thing to note: While we here at Chartboost truly do love our game developer partners and play just about every game that uses our technology, not every game you see here will be a partner title. This is what we play when we’re home from the office with our feet up on the couch looking for a bit of gaming R&R.\n\nHave a game we should be playing but aren’t? Tell us about it @Chartboost.\n\n*How far we’ve come!\n\nChristine Lee - Business Development Lead, North America\n\n@TheCircusCafe\n\nPlaying Fairway Solitaire by Big Fish Games\n\nI used to think card games were boring, and then I found Fairway Solitaire. The game has a catchy storyline with an adorable but obnoxious gopher that takes you through the golf course. If you play golf, you’ll see how the entire experience is as if you are on the fairway as you travel to various golf courses and holes around the world. Each hole is a game of Solitaire, increasing in difficulty and variety level by level- but scored similar to golf with techniques such as par, birdie etc. It’s highly addictive and I’ve been playing it for months now- not sure if I could ever get bored of this game.\n\nNate Barker - Publisher Relations Manager\n\n@kneyght\n\nPlaying Infestor by Ravenous Games\n\nI spent my Middle School days dreaming I was an Andalite, shape-shifting into cool animals and battling Yeerks. If that sounded like gibberish to you, I recommend skipping to the next review. If your interest is piqued, however, then you will enjoy playing Infestor, the innovative puzzle game by Ravenous Games. In Infestor, you play the part of a brain slug that is trying to escape the clutches of an invading army of human colonists. The fun of the game is infesting (get it?) human characters to take advantage of their unique characteristics. The puzzles are fairly simple, save for level 57 which is technically impossible (and will require an update to fix).\n\nSachin Goal - Coding Things and Eating Wings\n\n@sachingoel\n\nPlaying Whale Trail by ustwo\n\nWhale Trail is my all-time favorite mobile game. What’s not to like? The colors are HYPNOTIC. The music is so uplifting it will brighten you up on a bad day. The game play is pretty similar to other cave runners like Jetpack Joyride, but in this game the object is to continue scrolling to the right by collecting energy orbs and by avoiding evil storm clouds. The game even has a complimentary music video if you can’t get enough of the tunes!!\n\nYena Park - Graphic Designer\n\nPlaying Hanging With Friends by Zynga\n\nI have been playing this game for awhile now on both my old Android and now with my iPhone. One of the reasons I like this game is that it’s not an addictive mobile game but it keeps you occupied when you are waiting for a doctor’s appointment, on the bus, waiting on commercials, etc. I also like it because I get to learn words that I didn’t know existed by playing with others. For me, english is my second language, so it’s fun way to get to know some crazy words. My favorite part of playing Hanging with Friends is described by its name. I play with some smart ass friends who like to beat me and it’s exciting when beat them instead. The other way around too. Sometimes it’s fun to beat some same friends all the time and see if they can beat me this time. Also, on that excitement, it’s always fun to use chat interaction on Hanging with friends to throw some comment on each other. :) This is the game that always will be on my phone to play. :)\n\nNate Ahearn - Marketing Manager\n\n@Nate_Ahearn\n\nPlaying Zombie Road Trip by Noodlecake Studios\n\nZombie Road Trip is easily one of the most addictive games I’ve played on iOS, thanks in large part to its game mechanics and GameCenter challenge system. It’s an endless runner that combines Tiny Wings jumps with aerial tricks and weapons on the ground. The need to beat my friends has been a constant theme in my life and this game capitalizes on it wonderfully. I’m notified whenever a friend bests my score, thus making me want to hop back in the game and plow through some zombies, flipping my way to victory. The only downside is the feeling of loss that happens after you’ve been on a great run for 10 minutes, only to have the zombie horde catch up to you and fall short of beating a friend’s score.\n\nAs we prep for the arrival of the participants for the first ever Chartboost University: Boot Camp, we here at Chartboost thought now would be a good time to regale our faithful readers with what we’ve been playing on our smart devices these last few weeks.\n\nFor those that don’t know (shame on you), the aim of What We’re Playing is to shine some light on games that might otherwise go unnoticed and to give you a peek into our twisted definition of “fun” when it comes to mobile games. One thing to note: While we here at Chartboost truly do love our game developer partners and play just about every game that uses our technology, not every game you see here will be a partner title. This is what we play when we’re home from the office with our feet up on the couch looking for a bit of gaming R&R.\n\nHave a game we should be playing but aren’t? Tell us about it @Chartboost.\n\n*Where it all began (not really)\n\nAusten Chen - Scout Sales Associate\n\n@AustenChen\n\nPlaying Pocket League Story by Kairosoft\n\nAnytime an 8-Bit simulation comes out, I know that everything else takes a backseat. Emails? See you tomorrow. Reports? Sorry, that’ll have to wait. Pocket League Story, similar to the other games from Kairosoft, put you in charge of developing a soccer club from the local level to a World Class organization. As the General Manager, you have control over a lot of different decisions. You get to decide on the players and coaches that you hire (or fire), the training regimen, the starting 11, even the formations that your team will start in.\n\nWhile the game doesn’t give you control over what happens in matches, I found myself happily becoming a spectator for a few minutes at a time. My only complaint is that I wish I had more time to develop my team. You only have 8 years to develop your organization before the game generates your score. You can continue playing but nothing else counts unless you start over. Regardless, if you’re into soccer and management, look no further than Pocket League Story.\n\nSachin Goal - Coding Things and Eating Wings\n\n@sachingoel\n\nPlaying 10000000 by EightyEight Games\n\n10000000 is an immensely difficult game. When you first turn it on, your character is sleeping in a bedroom with access to a bunch of dungeon entrances. Upon entering one of the dungeons, you are faced with traversing through bad guys and locked doors by matching rows of three action blocks on the bottom of the screen. As you spend time swiping through the blocks to make a match, your character starts to inch off the screen until the screen scrolls past your hero and you lose. People with great predictive pattern matching abilities should play this game right now!\n\nDavid Hom - Director of Special Things\n\n@DavidRHom\n\nPlaying Spaceteam by Henry Smith\n\nThis game brings party games to the next level. All of the players team up and are flying a spaceship. Together they must work together by flipping switching, pressing buttons, and turning dials. The catch, everyone has a different space console and must execute commands for each other. Mix that in with a geeky, almost unpronounceable phrases, asteroid fields, and worm holes, and you’ll soon find yourself shouting, laughing and taking a deep sigh of relieve when you get through the level.\n\nMark Kinsella - Head Groundskeeper and Assistant to the Architect\n\n@MarkKinsella\n\nPlaying Pixel People by Chillingo\n\nI love building things. And Pixel People’s crazy twist on creating your city through job discovery is a fresh take on world building. Starting with a Mayor and Mechanic, you splice genes to create new professions. Mayor + Mechanic = Engineer. Engineer + Mayor = Architect. Simple, right? What about Preacher + Weather Reporter? Just wait until you create a Time Traveler, a Deep See Diver, or a Wizard.\n\nMichael Golden - The Man With The Silver Touch (weird, I know)\n\n@DaliLemma\n\nPlaying Bridge Constructor by Headup Games\n\nMy brother turned me on to this game a little while ago, with it’s addictive bridge building puzzles. You play an intrepid civil engineer with the task of rebuilding all the bridges on a earthquake ravaged island nation. As you progress, the spans get more complicated, but new materials become available making it possible to try everything from trundle bridges to full Golden Gate style suspension bridges. The developers seem to be using real structural engineering principles most of the time as well, rather than just making things up. So if you ace every bridge on your first try maybe it’s time to consider a career change!\n\nNate Ahearn - Marketing Manager\n\n@Nate_Ahearn\n\nPlaying Real Racing 3 by Electronic Arts\n\nThe Real Racing series has a favorite of mine since its debut years ago. After being acquired by EA, the developers elected to go with the tried and true free-to-play model for the third installation and the result is a winning combination of slightly aggressive monetization mechanics with some of the best racing gameplay you’ll find on mobile. The social mechanics have also taken a step forward since Real Racing 2, as your GameCenter friends now populate every race you’re in. The result is a much more satisfying experience. Nothing compares to the feeling of taking down your friend’s best time, snapping a screenshot and gloating about your victory via text message.\n\nThanks for checking out this week’s entry in our What We’re Playing series. We’ll see you in two weeks!"
