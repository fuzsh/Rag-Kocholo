        "text": "Tap Tap Revenge, a music game for the iPhone and iPod Touch that's like a touchscreen version of Guitar Hero, has been installed by over 1.2 million people in under a month and is played about 250,000 times per day, according to the game's developer, Tapulous. Our collective appetite for music games appears to be strong as ever.\n\nThe game is available for free in the iTunes App Store (iTunes link), and can be plaed in one or two player mode (players use opposite sides of the screen), in one of four difficulty levels. A simple profile feature lets you add your photo and username for potential interaction with other users, and more tracks can be downloaded, once you've mastered the ones that are available.\n\nStarting towards the end of this week, Tapulous says it will start including ads inside the game, which will continue to be free. I haven't heard of any of the artists featured in the game, which mustbe nice for them, since inclusion in the game promotes their music to a wideraudience.\n\nNo guitar is involved, of course, so the game may as well be described as \"Dance Dance Revolution\" for the iPhone. More interesting is the question of whether labels and bands will start embracing the iPhone App platform on a wider level. Why not sell an application that gets updated with new music releases from a label or some other curating entity? The payment and distribution mechanisms are already in place.\n\nSee Also:\n\nIs JamLegend's Guitar Hero-Style Game the Next Scrabulous?\n\nReport: Beatles Eye Rock Band, Guitar Hero\n\nGuitar Hero Is a Gateway Drug\n\n'Guitar Hero' For Real Guitars\n\nThe Time Is Right for a Folding iPhone\n\nIf Apple really does come out with a foldable smartphone, it’ll be late to the party—but will somehow arrive just as the real fun is starting.\n\nWildflower’s iPhone Cases Are Perfect for the Very Clumsy\n\nSay goodbye to shattered displays, dreadful screen protectors, and worn-out phone cases.\n\nWhich iPhone Should You Buy (or Avoid) Right Now?\n\nThe iPhone 16 arrives in September.
