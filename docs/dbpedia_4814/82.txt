Tapulous has revealed the benefits for record labels who license tracks for use in its iPhone game Tap Tap Revenge.

The company's head of business development says that when it offered the Katy Perry song Hot N Cold for download in the game, more than 250,000 players took advantage.

But more importantly (if you're Perry's label, EMI), 56,000 of them also clicked through from the game to buy the song on Apple's iTunes Store.

Tapulous is at the forefront of this kind of licensing for mobile games, although it's becoming a standard part of console franchises like Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

Record labels are notoriously risk-averse when it comes to licensing their music for free, so it's to be hoped that this Katy Perry stat will encourage more to work with Tapulous and other mobile developers in this way.
