Tapulous' iPhone rhythm game, Tap Tap Revenge, has proven to be quite the popular App Store title, winning an award for the most downloaded free game. Music labels seem to have taken note of its success and are now working with Tapulous on label-specific versions of the game. As pointed out by Reuters, EMI is the first label to collaborate with Tapulous on its iPhone rhythm game, and the resulting Tap Tap Dance was recently released on the App Store.

Tapulous had already licensed some Nine Inch Nails music for an application, but working with EMI allows access to more artists. Tap Tap Dance includes 10 songs from nine EMI artists, many of whom are quite well-known. Moby, Daft Punk, the Chemical Brothers, and Basement Jaxx all have songs in the game, as do Digitalism, Justice, Junkie XL, Soul Magic Orchestra, and Morgan Page. The digital soundtrack for Tap Tap Dance is also slated to be released on the iTunes Store, and should be available before December is out.

The new game retails for $4.99 and, according to EMI, will be promoted entirely by the artists involved. Tap Tap releases with music from other labels should follow as soon, as all of the licensing and revenue issues can be worked out, too. But until then, there's always the Christmas with Weezer edition, as well as new songs and remixes licensed by Tapulous every Thursday.
