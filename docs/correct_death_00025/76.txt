Ricci Martin, the musician son of entertainment legend Dean Martin, has died. He was 62.

Martin died Wednesday at his home in Utah, his family announced Saturday. A cause of death has not been determined.

The youngest son of Dean Martin, Ricci Martin became an entertainer, himself. In the 1990s, he joined the band Dino, taking the place of his late brother Dean Paul Martin. Martin later performed a touring tribute show to his father, singing his hits and telling stories.

In 2002, Martin wrote a memoir, "That's Amore," about growing up in Beverly Hills, California, as a member of the famous family.

Martin is survived by three daughters, Pepper, Montana and Rio; his mother, Jeanne Martin; his older brother, Craig; and four sisters, Gail, Deana, Gina and Sasha.

His loss was felt locally as well.

Rose Angelica, one of the organizers of the Steubenville Dean Martin Festival in Steubenville, was in Connecticut last week, performing with Ricci's sister Deanna.

Deana has since flown to California to be with family.

"Steubenville and the Dean Martin Committee want to convey our deepest condolences and say how sorry we are for this terrible loss at this time,” Angelica said. “We’re just all so shocked about it. It was just so sudden and unexpected, so no one really know what’s going on.

There is still no word on a funeral date. Angelica says she expects it will be sometime this week.
