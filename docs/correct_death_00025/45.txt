Dean Martin, who was born on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville and died on Dec, 25, 1995, in Beverly Hills, Calif., was an Italian-American singer, actor, comedian and film producer. He was one of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century.

This past week marked Martin’s centennial birthday and I prepared the following 10 brainteasers in his memory:

¯ Martin’s 99th birthday last year (2016) was numerically special. Why? If numbers one to 26 are assigned to the letters of the English alphabet as A being one, B being two, C being three, etc., the sum of the numbers assigned to the letters of Dean Martin equals 99.

¯ The square of the sum of the digits of 2017 equals 100, signifying the 100th birthday of Martin.

¯ Furthermore, if 2017 is split in the middle as 20 and 17, the difference of the squares of these two numbers gives 111. Interestingly enough, the 111th prime number is 607, coinciding with Martin’s birth date, June 7 (6/07).

¯ Split, Martin’s centennial birthday 7 June 2017 expressed as 7/06/2017 as 706 and 2017. Number 706 equals two times 353 where the sum and the difference of these two numbers equal 355 and 351, respectively. Note that 355 equals five times 71 where 5 plus 71 is 76, namely, 7 June (7/6). Additionally, twice the reverse of 351, namely 153, yields 306, and the 306th prime number is 2017.

¯ The reverse of 306, namely 603, equals nine times 67 where 67 coincides with Martin’s birth date June 7 (6/7).

¯ The reverse of 2017, namely 7102, equals 2 x 53 x 67, where 67 is Martin’s birth date June 7 and reverse of 53, namely 35, to the power 2 yields 1225 (Dec. 25), the day Martin died in 1995.

¯ Martin’s 101st birthday to occur next year (2018) also will be special. Why? Martin’s birth date — June 7 — coincides with the 158th day of a non-leap year and twice the sum of 158 and its reverse, namely 851, yields 2018.

¯ Moreover, Martin died in the 79th year of his life where twice 79 equals 158.

¯ Martin died on the 359th day of 1995, where 359 is the 72nd prime number. Interestingly enough, one less than 72, namely 71, times the reverse of 72, namely 27, results in Martin’s birth year, 1917.

¯ Last, Martin died 201 days after his 78th birthday, where 201 equals three times 67, that is, Martin’s birth date, June 7. Further, three times 201 equals 603, which is the reverse of 306 and note that as indicated earlier, the 306th prime number is 2017, the year Martin would have turned 100 years old.

Happy centennial birthday to Dean Martin!
