        "text": "It’s Oct 8th.. Haven't reflected on my dads page for a bit, but this year is a lil harder for me.. I have gone through some medical hardships as well as trying to raise 2 teenagers during the Covid pandemic, as you all are. If I haven’t thanked you all personally, do not think that I left you out! I read all messages and am so very thankful that I have my LE family always on top of things reminding us of how much we contributed and still do as survivors to our loved ones who are gone but never forgotten! Words keep us survivors strong and let us know that someone is out there to support..\n\nSadly, I have to say, there is no longer a BIA Law Enforcement Services on my reservation with whom my dad worked for and gave his life for.. They have since demolished the Hopi Jail and have transferred services to the Hopi Tribal Police. There have been no efforts to reach out to our family for support as we have had held memorial runs at the Hopi Police Dept for a few years. I don’t understand how you can not come out and support one of your own who gave their life!!\n\nDenelle James\n\nDaughter"
