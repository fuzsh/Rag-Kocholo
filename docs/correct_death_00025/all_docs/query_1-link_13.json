        "text": "Dean Martin (7 June 1917 – 25 December 1995), born Dino Paul Crocetti, was an American singer, actor, comedian, and film producer. He was nicknamed \"the King of Cool\" for his effortless charisma and self-assurance, becoming one of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century. Martin was well-known for being Jerry Lewis' partner in the popular \"Martin and Lewis\" comedy duo, and he was also known to be a member of the \"Rat Pack\".\n\nBiography[]\n\nDino Paul Crocetti was born on 7 June 1917 in Steubenville, Ohio to an Italian father and an Italian-American mother, and he spoke Abruzzese Italian at home. Martin dropped out of high school in sophomore year because he felt that he was smarter than his teachers, and he bootlegged liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill, and boxed as a welterweight. He later attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, and he became a member of the \"Martin and Lewis\" comedy duo with Jerry Lewis. Martin became a popular singer and actor during the 1950s, becoming a member of the \"Rat Pack\" with Frank Sinatra. Martin was a star in concert stages, nightclubs, recordings, motion pictures, and television, and he later hosted the variety program The Dean Martin Show from 1965 to 1974 and The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast from 1974 to 1984.\n\nDean Martin was a lifelong Republican Party member, although he supported Democratic Party presidential nominee John F. Kennedy in 1960, owing to Sinatra's close friendship with the president. However, some of his more important connections were with the American Mafia, which helped to kickstart his career; he performed at their events and clubs."
