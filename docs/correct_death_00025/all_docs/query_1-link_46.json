        "text": "I'm so glad I wasn't around when he was big - all the movies, TV shows and records. He must have really been in people's faces for years.\n\nYUCK!\n\nHere he is being all goofy and charming and mugging at the camera. Crazy kooky guy!\n\nR6 It has been established that more often than not, his glass while performing was actually Martinelli's apple juice. It was just an act, because that was what was expected of him, like Marylin Monroe playing dumb. After his son Dean Paul Martin died in a military training flight in the 1980s, however he started really drinking heavily until he died in 1995.\n\nI don't find him slimy at all. To me he was just a cool guy, with a playboy persona. He and Sammy Davis, Jr. were the real talents in the Rat Pack.\n\nMy partner was especially close to Joey Bishop and Sammy Davis. His dad put Ava Garner back together after she was beaten up as a favor to Sinatra and he lived with Ava in London for a summer, he got to know David Niven then. Sinatra used to fly my partner around in his plane. Sinatra did not take much notice of him. He hated Jerry Lewis who was mean to him and used to insult him because he was fat.\n\nYears ago we posted many stories about him and Ava in the DataLounge. My partner really liked her and it was just him and Ava in the house. She had friends over for dinner and that's how he met David Niven and others. He has nothing to say except good things about Ava - actually mostly boring things. His father was very close to her and Frank. His parents sent him to school in Cambridge for a short time and then he worked in London for a while. I was surprised he was so close to Sammy. There was a movie or special on his life and he just started talking about him. Joey Bishop was very close to him right up until the last year of his life. He sort of had adopted him. Joey had him as a guest on all of this TV shows - I mean he watched them from backstage.\n\nI read this book on Dean back in the fall and would recommend it to anyone wanting an unbiased portrayal of him. A real page-turner, to say the least. I've always considered him the epitome of cool, and I'm 40. Most on here know, I'm sure, but it was written into his contract for 'The Dean Martin Show' that he didn't have to rehearse. They'd give him outline tapes he could listen to as he golfed, and then he'd show up to tape the show and that was it. The book also expounds on the Martin-Lewis falling out, and Jerry Lewis is quoted liberally in the book about how they just went different directions. Such is life.\n\nA different era back when stumbling around drunk was thought of as cute and funny. Just listen to all the drunk driving jokes from those times. It's hard to believe now that something causing death on the highways got crowds laughing hours on end. Sinatra was the mean one out of that Rat Pack bunch. What's hard to watch are old clips of Dean & the others of that group making jokes about Sammy Davis being black. In the era of Jim Crow I guess it fit right in but must have been hard for Davis to take from so-called friends. When Sammy was in that accident which cost him his eye he was turned away from a hospital because he was black.\n\nDean was a tragic case in the end as after his son died he just faded away. I read somewhere a long time ago someone summing up his life by saying \"Dean found the void and lived in it.\" I actually like his voice on some songs where he isn't singing in such a drunken sounding state. Out of those times I'll take Bobby Darin any day. In my view he had Sinatra beat hands down.\n\n[quote] What's hard to watch are old clips of Dean & the others of that group making jokes about Sammy Davis being black. In the era of Jim Crow I guess it fit right in but must have been hard for Davis to take from so-called friends.\n\nThat was comedy then. You can’t look at it with today’s eyes.\n\nAlso, they WERE his friends. They refused to play any club or stay at any hotel where Sammy had to walk through a door other than the rest of them walking through. Or couldn’t stay on the same floor as them or what have you. And they’d make a big deal of it, too.\n\nSammy, right up until his death, never had an unkind word to say about any of them. That says something.\n\n[quote] What's hard to watch are old clips of Dean & the others of that group making jokes about Sammy Davis being black. In the era of Jim Crow I guess it fit right in but must have been hard for Davis to take from so-called friends.\n\nI see it completely different, by making jokes about his blackness, it showed that he fit in and was one of the group. They joked about Sinatra and Deano being Italian and Peter Lawford being English. While not being really member of the Rat Pack, everyone joked about Danny Thomas being Lebanese. And, that's the way things were, if your friend was Jewish, you made jokes about him being Jewish, if he was Irish you joked about him being Irish, Polish, etc. There is a major difference between hurtful ethnic jokes and friendly ribbing. Such as Dean or Frank could crack such jokes, but I'm sure they wouldn't have tolerated someone outside the group doing it, in their presence.\n\nR26 \"That was comedy then. You can’t look at it with today’s eyes.\"\n\nPeople say the same thing about the homophobia in comedy that was endemic during my adolescence.\n\nHere's the problem with that excuse though. My eyes looked at that comedy *at that time* and saw it for what it was--repugnant.\n\nSomething being popularly acceptable doesn't excuse it. There have always been people pointing out bigotry in popular culture and those people have always been actively ignored and criticized.\n\nR32, that was an interesting read. There was another thread on here that pointed out the crafty editing on 'The Dean Martin Roast' specials, and once I knew what to look for, you can tell there's no way 23 people were on the dais in Vegas at once! My favourite at the roasts was Georgia Engel, who would blatantly read off the cue cards and then immediately apologize to whomever was being roasted, repeatedly saying, \"I don't know why they make me say these terrible things about you! I'm so sorry.\"\n\nR39\n\nYou missed the point of my reply in R31.\n\nThe point was that there were people at the time who saw bigoted comedy for what it was and spoke against it. So, the argument that 'you can't judge art by modern eyes' as an excuse for that sort of thing is bogus. There were critics of racist comedy AT. THAT. TIME. They were ridiculed and/or ignored regularly.\n\nThe fact that you twisted my statement into suggesting that I think black performers shouldn't have been represented at all is... ridiculous and out-of-nowhere. And the fact that you used the prepackaged conservative mockery of liberal critique with \"You're problematic\" suggests to me that you're a conservative and aren't interested in a good-faith conversation about this. So, I'm finished with you.\n\nI always thought Dean Martin was an asshole, from the time I discovered him in the early 1970s when his ridiculous program was on its last legs, and he wore a bleached wig. Btw, he may have mourned his son after death, but he never paid an instant of attention to the kid when he was ALIVE.\n\n\"Is it me or is Lainie imitating Streisand's speaking voice here? \"\n\nLainie copied mightily from Lena Horne and admits it. Unlike Miss Streisand who did the same but insists she was a total original. Barf.\n\n[quote]My favorite Dean Martin story was told by one of his kids. He would have a party at his house and later go to the pool house and call the police with a noise complaint pretending to be a neighbor. The cops would show up and then Dean would say sorry folks we have to break up this party, the neighbors need their sleep.\n\nthat wouldn't have worked they would have checked with the neighbors first.\n\nLAME fake story alert.\n\nNich Tosches makes a pretty good case in his book on Dean Martin that Martin simply did not give a shit about much of anything. The act where he would get (or pretend to get drunk) and then later on in the spy spoof movies where he just looked exhausted and irritated was apparently not much of an act.\n\nThe problem was that by the time he was playing Matt Helm, he was too old to really come across as too-cool-to-care, at least to our modern eyes. These days we expect cool older people to have their own thing, not merely mimic what younger people were doing. I think that's partly why he comes across as sleazy.\n\nHe also very obviously didn't care if he hurt a lot of the people around him, and sometimes hurt people on purpose, so that's likely another factor.\n\n[quote]The fact that you twisted my statement into suggesting that I think black performers shouldn't have been represented at all is... ridiculous and out-of-nowhere.\n\nThere's been discussion for decades on whether it's better for various minorities to be represented as stereotype or unflatteringly, or not represented at all. It's a legit discussion.\n\nUnfortunately, the guy you were talking to is trying to push the fallacy that it's either-or, that in the old days you either had only racist depictions of blacks or else no blacks at all. People do that a lot, but as you noted, it's not the truth.\n\nI'm thinking of the old Bette Davis movie \"In This Our Life\" which had a really modern, non-racist portrayal of a falsely-accused black man. It could be done, and sometimes was.\n\nI watched the excellent Sinatra documentary \"All Or Nothing At All\" that was made a few years ago and they talked about the changing times of the 60s and how Sinatra and his peers had a really hard time trying to deal with it. Sinatra, Dean, etc. were the top dogs for years, the Rat Pack was the coolest thing in the early Sixties, but then the culture went through such a radical change in the mid-late 60s when a new generation took over. Sinatra and co. were getting older and were no longer at the center of things, it was all about The Beatles and The Rolling Stones and the whole youth culture took over the narrative. To say that Sinatra and his generation were pissed as hell is an understatement. They were now the \"old guys\" and not the movers and shakers anymore and they all had a lot of resentment towards it.\n\nIf Martin is remembered at all, it's as part of the Rat Pack.\n\nThey're remembered, but I don't know if they're remembered fondly. They represented the idea of \"cool\" that was prevalent for a few years - posh, grown-up, smug, superior, cruel, treating people outside the group like toys and reinforcing a strict heirarchy in the group with cruelty, with an undercurrent of menace - in short, massive douches. Fortunately, that idea of cool lost popularity in the mid-sixties, but it never really died. There are still people who wish they could do the same, mostly the modern white douches who wish they could get away with treating people as badly as Sinatra and his pals did.\n\nI'm just someone who's realistic about how Rat Pack types see me, R148, and it seems you aren't. Their kind of cool is smug and exclusionary, people like that treat anyone outside the group as inferior and a figure of fun if they notice them at all, and I know which side of that dividing line I'm on in real life.\n\nPeople who like the Rat Pack usually think they're cool enough to be part of that In Crowd, included in making jokes about their inferiors and feeling smug, but that's bullshit. If you met them, they'd call you a \"fag\" and make mean jokes, and threaten to have Sinatra's \"boys\" break your leg if you tried to make trouble about it. Martin wasn't the worst of the Rat Pack by all accounts, but he was still part of a group of real dirtbags.\n\nIt is really unfair to call them all dirt bags. They were all different personalities. some were really nice - even kind to my partner who knew most of them well. His dad, a Jew, was friends with most them. Some of them were at my partner's house in Beverly Hills every week. His dad had a weekly poker game that they all came My partner heard stars use the n-word, f-g word, wop and kike. This kind of talk was common and was used around his dad and Sammy. they didn't think twice about it.\n\nI think most DLers are too young to know how HUGELY popular Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin were as a team in the early and mid-50s. They were like mega-rock stars, with screaming fans, both women and men. The films they made together, all raucous comedies (with occasional musical numbers), like That's My Boy, Sailor Beware, Living It Up, You're Never Too Young, Hollywood or Bust and Artists and Models are mostly forgotten now but were enormous hits. And their TV appearances on variety hours were national events, the must-see TV of its time.\n\nWhen they broke up, it was comparable to the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn for LA. Much grieving and wailing and incomprehension, an American tragedy! Everyone assumed that Dean would be lost without Jerry but, though it took Dean a few years, he became a surprisingly well-respected dramatic actor with The Young Lions and Some Came Running, while Jerry just continued to make....formulaic Jerry Lewis comedies.\n\nIt wasn't really until the later 1960s, when Dean mainly focused on silly lazy sex comedies that his reputation as an actor dipped, though he remained popular with general audiences well into the 70s through his TV show and those stupid roasts.\n\nDean Martin, though he played a stumbling lush thru most of the 60s and 70s, was arguably the least sleazy member of the Rat Pack. While he admittedly bedded many women in his time, he was a low key family man. More at peace watching Westerns at home or out golfing most of the day. Peter Lawford however? Total sleazeball. Sinatra couldn't stand him. An opportunist in the truest sense.\n\nDean was the King of Cool -- and had a charm and ease on stage and in front of the camera that Sinatra couldn't approach (try as he might). Sinatra might have been the better singer, but Dean had WAY more fun doing it. I think that's why I always preferred Dean Martin, Bobby Darin and Sammy Davis to balladeers like Sinatra and Tony Bennett. Darin and Davis in particular were widely versatile...great actors, impressionists, dancers and singers who could handle a lot of different genres well.\n\nFor those who have a hard time understanding Martin's appeal today, take a peek at this clip of him and the great Phil Harris. Do you think a Buble or Harry Connick could pull that off today?\n\nR170 -- haha, not young or ignorant. I've read nearly every book on the subject. I didn't say Sinatra wasn't sleazy, only that it wasn't a fair moniker for Martin. And yes, Sinatra used Lawford to get closer to the Kennedys but privately, Frank couldn't stand the guy, even before the fallout. This is well documented. Considering Frank and Giancana (and the entire Chicago outfit) basically swung the vote for Kennedy, it's understandable how pissed off he was when the Kennedys rebuffed the invitation (not to mention RFK making it his crusade to go after the very people who got them elected)\n\nI love seeing Peter Lawford in his late 1940s MGM musicals like Easter Parade, Good News and Royal Marriage. He was so incredibly handsome and charming.\n\nBut can anyone explain why MGM never seemed to consider dubbing him in all the singing he did in those films? Was his voice so distinctive that it couldn't be convincingly duplicated? I'm surprised his name never comes up in discussions of film dubbing (which I happen to be reading about a lot lately online).\n\nI always disliked Peter Lawford. As an actor he was smarminess personified. As a human being he was total trash. Nobody remembers him for his acting; if he's remembered at all it's for supposedly being the last person Marilyn Monroe spoke to on the phone before she died. She supposedly said to him \"Say goodbye to Pat (his wife), say goodbye to the President, and say goodbye to yourself, because you're a nice guy.\" I myself believe she said no such thing. Anyway, Lawford was a repulsive creep. Maybe he became a sleazebag because he was molested as a child. I heard he was a child when he was deflowered by an adult woman, a maid or somebody like that. That might have fucked him up really bad.\n\nPeter dated Dorothy Dandridge but had to keep it under wraps because of people's views on mixed marriages. Understandable. I read that he was heartbroken when she died. He was one of her pallbearers.\n\nI don't know why he went off the rails like he did. He really turned into a dirtball in his later years; his toupee in the 70s was so awful, looking like a mogwai on his head.\n\nMaybe Lawford was just the kind of straight sleazeball who thought that his parents should have been buying him prostitutes when he was still a kid.\n\nAs for jokes about drunk driving getting laughs, in the sixties and seventies, any show of concern for consequences marked you as a total square and a buzzkill and probably a Nixon supporter. This lasted until the 1980s, when the MADD people started campaigning for the legal system to take drunk driving seriously, and AIDS started killing people. And even then, any attempt to save lives through prevention would get you called a sex-negative right-wing prude.\n\nI found Lawford to be very sad. His cunt of a mother should have been charged with child abuse. She psychologically tormented him. He hero worshiped JFK, but the Kennedys treated him like a joke, and JFK just used him as pimp to provide women for him to fuck. When JFK was killed,Lawford collapsed on the floor, vomiting and sobbing. A very tragic, sad man. His death was horrifying. It is reported that he sat up in bed, suddenly bleeding from every pore of his body. When that pos Sinatra's son was kidnapped, FS had the fucking gall to call Lawford, asking for help from the Kennedys. In spite of being treated with cruelty by FS and blacklisted from working in Hollywood, PL helped him by asking Kennedy to intervene. FS never thanked him or spoke to him again. I despise Frank Sinatra. I loved Dean Martin and still do. Dean was everything FS WISHED he could be . Suave, charming , cool,calm , collected. Talented actor, better singer (imo) . But mostly Dean was self assured. He did not give a fuck about what others thought of him. That included the mafia, whose dicks FS disgustingly sucked. To feel like a big man. A bully. FS was a small man in every way. Dean was a real man. A very kind man who felt no need to step on others to make himself feel big. FS was an ugly bully. I never understood what the beautiful Ava saw in him. FS was cruel to people who helped him and befriended him. Lawford, Montgomery Cliff, for years that included Sammy Davis. Sorry, but I loathe him for his cruelty to others, especially Lawford.\n\n\"Why would his mother warn Mayer? To get her son fired?\"\n\nBecause in those days people believed that sending their fey boy to a psychiatrist would turn him into the rough, butch, manly, straight, but well-behaved young he-man she and Mayer wanted. The first half of the 20th century was the heyday of psychoanalysis, when people believed that talking to a shrink could cure everything from schizophrenia to scrofula, and that they could most definitely turn gay children straight.\n\nHell, half a century of debunking and admissions of error still haven't convinced everyone, people still want to believed that \"conversion therapy\" works.\n\nI could go either way with Dino but he was part of a very ugly incident in an Atlantic City casino where he and Sinatra were appearing in I believe the late 70s. They went to a black jack table where the dealer was an Asian woman. Sinatra wanted to do something that was against house rules. The dealer wouldn't allow him. He insisted. Things got ugly real fast. Does anyone remember the specifics of this?\n\nGavone!\n\nWhat my Italian Hoboken born and bred mother called Sinatra. Dialect for cafone- a low class jerk. She was younger than him by a number of year but her parents knew Dolly his mother who knew all the Italian immigrants there and was known as to be what can be called politely a 'fixer.' She was never charmed by his singing. Just another young italian male asshole full of himself.\n\nHer older sister was crazy about him. Tried to see him at the Paramount in Times Square. One of the thousands of screaming bobby soxxers outside who couldn't get in. She turned on him when Hoboken gave Sinatra a welcome home parade and thousands of people lined the streets and there were bands and the mood was at fever pitch. Sinatra didn't show and after that she had no use for him.\n\nR207- No, not at all. I was too young and never found him to be desirable in any way. I have read many books on the Kennedys, Sinatra, ect. I do remember being very young and watching Dean's show and the DM roasts. Peter Lawford's fetish was S&M according to his last live in girlfriend. She said he had to be whipped and humiliated. His mother seemed to take sadist delight in humiliating him and I never read why she did that. He had no self esteem because of her. I think the bitch was demonic. PL had nothing to do with the kennedys decision. Nothing. FS blacklisted him in Hollywood and PL never really got any real work after FS did that to him . FS also was fucking Lauren Bacall In Humphrey Bogarts house as he lay dying upstairs. I never could stand either of them after that .\n\n\"Again, why would the mother give Mayer something the could be used against her son? She could have sent him to a psychiatrist herself.:\"\n\nBecause if she sent him herself, she'd have to pay for the treatment out of her own pocket! Telling Mayer presumably meant the studio would pay.\n\nAs for telling Mayer, well, if I'm right about her expecting Mayer to send him to a de-gaying psychiatrist, then she didn't expect his behavior to ever develop into a real problem. He was a kid at the time, presumably not doing anything blackmailable, and if she believed that a shrink could turn him straight, then there never would be. All speculation on my part, of course.\n\n[quote] Again, why would the mother give Mayer something the could be used against her son?\n\nMaybe she didn’t want to see his career blow up if it came out and wanted Mayer to do what studios did back then, which is set him up with what we nowadays call a beard.\n\nTrue, R225, but I wouldn't trust his permanently drug altered memory. I don't think Lawford \"not talking\" had anything to do with nobility or tastefulness. I also don't buy this blame the mother shit. Your parents are not responsible for what you do as an adult. Then when you're 40, you own your life completely and cannot blame anyone for where you are at that point.\n\nMy main memories of Peter Lawford are of the bloated, pretentious asshole who did game shows and played TV host or the husband/boyfriend of the lead. His acting/hosting was nothing more than perfunctory. Other than the Kennedy association, I saw nothing remotely special or interesting about Lawford.\n\n“I also don't buy this blame the mother shit. Your parents are not responsible for what you do as an adult. Then when you're 40, you own your life completely and cannot blame anyone for where you are at that point.”\n\nYou sound clueless. I have known several people who were absolutely destroyed by their shitty parents, you can’t come back from that.\n\nR233, you MUST come back from that. Most everyone has parents who did endless amounts of damage, but 90% of the population does not walk around in a dysfunctional haze. You work it out, learn how to deal with it and move on. If one is 40 and over crying over what daddy did when they were 15, it's time to get therapy and move the fuck on.\n\nThanks R236. My own therapist told me that. It helped me to focus on what I could do for myself rather than stay in a rut because I kept blaming my parents. True, they left my brain a toxic wasteland, but I had to find my way out of it on my own. And once I quit drinking like a fish the way that they did, I became a lot clearer to me.\n\nDino's daughter Deana wrote a thing/book about what a crappy Dad he was, although it was mostly due to him not being around or showing much interest in the kids from his first family. His first wife was a raging alcoholic who couldn't take them. The evil stepmother Jeanne became the reluctant guardian. According to Deana, Pops sometimes groused about people thinking he was actually a drunk when he only had 5-7 drinks a day spread out from breakfast. Deana says she responded by pointing out all the prescription meds and mood enhancers he was on. Dean argued they were harmless because they came from a doctor. The guy was drugged out of his mind.\n\nr248 that's very true. What constituted alcoholism was very different back then. An \"alcoholic\" was someone who got blitzed drunk and fell down and behaved like an ass. It was more the \"embarrassing\" part of drinking that was thought of as being alcoholism. You could put away a fifth of hard liquor a day but as long as you were able to hold your shit together you weren't thought of as a \"problem drinker.\"\n\nSimilarly, a person who smoked a pack of cigarette a day was a \"light smoker.\" Two packs a day was pretty much the norm.\n\nI don't know what you think you read but Deana said right in the introduction that people would ask her if Dean was a good Dad and she was \"sad\" because she had to say no. True, she didn't use the word crap.\n\nDean's second wife Jeanne refused to let Dean's son from his first family in the front door when they were having a memorial for Dean Jr. after his crash. She told him it was for \"family only.\" Literally shut the door on him. It's in the fucking book.\n\n“Dean's second wife Jeanne refused to let Dean's son from his first family in the front door when they were having a memorial for Dean Jr. after his crash. She told him it was for \"family only.\" Literally shut the door on him. It's in the fucking book.”\n\nThat was a strange thing to do but for YEARS she provided a stable home to Dean’s kids from his first marriage and Martin’s daughter stayed in touch even after they divorced.\n\nMartin was in showbiz so frequently gone but was not a crap father, his daughter loved him very much and none of his kids were estranged from him.\n\nSounds like reading comprehension isn’t your forte.\n\n[quote]I'm so glad I wasn't around when he was big - all the movies, TV shows and records. He must have really been in people's faces for years.\n\nYeah people really hated him, that's why they went to all his movies, watched his TV shows and bought his records. The guy was talented, modest, funny and likeable. You don't seem overly bright.\n\n\"Martin was in showbiz so frequently gone but was not a crap father, his daughter loved him very much and none of his kids were estranged from him.\"\n\nThat's because they craved the love and attention that they never got from Dean. A very typical story. My own brother idolized our father and was crushed when he died from lung cancer after smoking for 65 years. I wrote that guy off when I was 22 because he was a mostly absent egotistical drunk father who couldn't hold a job.\n\nI've read a lot of memoirs and bios on the Rat Pack, and Dean's drinking really wasn't an issue until the death of his son in the late 80s. Sure, he likely had a cocktail or two in the evening (as was the fashion of the era) but he was NOT the hard partier that Sinatra and his entourage were. And even Sammy would give Frank a run for his money in the partying dept (he was admittedly out of control in the late 60s/early 70s). Even during the height of 'the Summit' era, Dean followed a pretty low key routine. He got up early to golf, would breeze in to tape his show, then spend the early evening watching Westerns on TV, eating butter sandwiches. Yes, butter sandwiches.\n\nNick Tosches (terrific) book really paints Dean as a talented loner who really didn't get a shit about too much. His daughter Deana's book confirms this view through her own experience. He was a detached figure. Warm and kind enough to those around him but definitely remote. Deana only really felt a deeper connection to the man in his final years when she'd cook and bring over her grandmother Angela's Pasta Fagioli.\n\nR272, you're dreaming. .That didn't mean he wasn't drinking alone in the hotel room.\n\n\"Dean's drinking really wasn't an issue\"\n\nMeans he was still awake at 10PM.\n\n\"he was NOT the hard partier that Sinatra and his entourage were\"\n\nSure. The trouble is with you kiddies is that you read books and books and books and BELIEVE THEM. You have no knowledge of the era except what you read in books.\n\nFACT: Dean Martin drank enough to out you under the table.\n\nR278, Whence your knowledge of \"the era\" and specifically Dean Martin the man?\n\nI'm 71 and remember the heyday of the Rat Pack and the JFK Administration.\n\nNevertheless, I would hesitate to claim to know more about a star's drinking habits than several biographers. Unless I knew him. So if you knew Dino, tell us more!\n\nAfter Martin and Lewis broke up it was assumed that Jerry Lewis would have a fabulous career and that Dean Martin would just fade away! How wrong they were! His career continued on very well; he was a respected actor, had hit records and a successful tv series. Supposedly Jerry Lewis tried quite a few times to have a hit tv series but all his efforts flopped and of course he never had an success as a singer. All Jerry Lewis could do was keep making dopey comedies.\n\n[quote]I would mention that many people think she was killed by the mob or CIA, because she was critical of the Warren Commission conclusions about the death of JFK.\n\nI always heard that she was killed, not because she was critical of the Warren Commission conclusions, but because she had obtained inside information about the plot to kill Kennedy that she was about to reveal.\n\nR297 Very much less known than the others. The only reason I know anything about him was I found a boxed set of one of the seasons of his early 60s sitcom for $3.00 at some closeout store. It wasn't great. It was a spinoff of The Danny Thomas Show, and is little more than a pale derivative of that classic series. I wonder if his talk show was better.\n\nJoey was a bastard. When his co-stars on his TV show got bigger laughs than him (Joe Flynn, Guy Marks) , they were canned.\n\nThe only time I liked Joey was in a scene from the movie \"A Guide For The Married Man\". His wife catches him in bed with a floozy (nice bod on Joey, by the way). He denies it, even while he and the bimbo are getting dressed right in front of the wife. Hilarious scene.\n\n[quote]My favorite Dean Martin story was told by one of his kids. He would have a party at his house and later go to the pool house and call the police with a noise complaint pretending to be a neighbor. The cops would show up and then Dean would say sorry folks we have to break up this party, the neighbors need their sleep.\n\n[quote] that wouldn't have worked they would have checked with the neighbors first. LAME fake story alert.\n\nYou think it's far farfetched that the Beverly Hills Police would indulge the biggest stars in the world? Now that's LAME\n\nWhen Rob came out to his dad his father rent his garments, and chanted the kadish. He disowned him. What a horrible thing to have happen. Joey knew about it and made a point of making sure that he knew about it and supported Rob. It seems like Joey saw himself as a substitute dad. Later his dad changed his tune and accepted him. He even let him hold gay parties in their house - that had a great pool! His family welcomed me with open arms and made me a member of the family - for good or bad. That was in 1990 when we met.\n\nI was never particularly a fan of Sammy Davis but, as a teen, saw him on Broadway in GOLDEN BOY (1965-66?), in which he was truly fantastic. The unstoppable energy and charisma were off the charts and gave him an unlikely sex appeal, the kind you never see on a Broadway stage any more. Totally believable as a bantam weight boxer, dancing a choreographed championship match.\n\nI'll never forget that after the curtain call, he sat on stage for at least 20 minutes and sang several songs, most memorably \"What Kind of Fool Am I?\" to enormous cheering. The audience was in love with him.\n\n\"Davis was talented for sure, but I find him unendurable.\n\nLikewise. He was an excellent singer and dancer and undoubtedly had charisma, but he just tried so damn hard! He was PERFORMING at all times, grabbing your attention by the throat and gripping with all his strength.\n\nHe must have been fantastic as a stage performer, but very irritating in TV shows and movies.\n\nR147 You're right in your description of the Rat Pack's antics. Anytime I watch the old clips of this click it makes me cringe. Sinatra was over rated as a singer. Bobby Darin had him beat by a mile. They treated Sammy Davis Jr with public ridicule using the old watermelon jokes and usual trash that people actually thought was acceptable in those times. I hate seeing how the public laughed and laughed at the foolish drivel during some of these Vegas shows. Remember this was back when being or acting drunk was considered funny and cool. They were all pretty much a bunch of jerks in their private lives. Sinatra was the worst."
