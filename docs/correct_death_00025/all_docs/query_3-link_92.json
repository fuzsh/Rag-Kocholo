One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century, Martin was nicknamed the \"King of Cool\" for his seemingly effortless charisma and self-assurance. He and Jerry Lewis formed the immensely popular comedy duo Martin and Lewis, with Martin serving as the straight man to Lewis' slapstick hijinks. Afterwards he was a star in concert stages, nightclubs, recordings, motion pictures and television. He was also a member of the \"Rat Pack\". Martin was diagnosed with lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993, and in early 1995 retired from public life. He died of acute respiratory failure resulting from emphysema at his Beverly Hills home on Christmas morning 1995, at age 78.
