        "text": "American actor and singer (1951–1987)\n\nFor the English soccer player of the same name, see Dean Martin (footballer born 1957).\n\nDean Paul Martin Jr. (born Dino Paul Crocetti Jr.; November 17, 1951 – March 21, 1987) was an American pop singer and film and television actor. A member of the California Air National Guard, Martin died in a crash during a military training flight. He was the son of entertainer Dean Martin.\n\nMartin's parents were the singer and entertainer Dean Martin and his second wife, Jeanne Biegger. Dean Paul was the fifth of Dean Martin's eight children and Jeanne's eldest son.[1] He attended the Urban Military Academy in Brentwood, California. As a youth, he was encouraged toward a singing career. At age 13, he joined Desi Arnaz Jr. and Billy Hinsche in the pop group Dino, Desi & Billy, which had a few minor hits in the US in 1965, entering the Billboard U.S. top 30 twice with \"I'm a Fool\" (#17)[2] and \"Not the Lovin' Kind\" (#25).[3]\n\nMartin began to go by his given name of Dean Paul instead of the nickname \"Dino\" in his late teens. He became a successful tennis player who competed in the qualifying competition for Wimbledon[4] and an actor.[5] He co-starred with Ali MacGraw in the 1979 film Players, starring as a professional tennis player,[6] for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as New Star of the Year – Actor.[7] He later starred in the TV series Misfits of Science, broadcast during the 1985-1986 television season.[8] The series co-starred Courteney Cox.[9]\n\nHis final film appearance was in Backfire, co-starring Karen Allen and Keith Carradine, released in 1988 after Martin's death.[10] The film was dedicated to his memory.\n\nMartin, an avid pilot, obtained his pilot's license at age 16 and became an officer in the California Air National Guard in 1980.[8] He entered active duty for officer training in the U.S. Air Force under the Palace Chase program (permitting direct entry into the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve), was commissioned as a second lieutenant and completed pilot training at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, in 1981. Following transition training in the F-4 Phantom II jet fighter at Homestead AFB, Florida, in the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron, he was assigned to the California Air National Guard's 196th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 163rd Tactical Fighter Group at March AFB, California, flying the F-4C Phantom II as a part-time Air National Guardsman. He eventually rose to the rank of captain.[11]\n\nDuring a 1987 training mission from March AFB, Martin's F-4 jet crashed in California's San Bernardino Mountains during a snowstorm, killing him and his weapons systems officer, Captain Ramon Ortiz.[12] Martin was 35 years old.[13][8] Officials stated that Martin's jet plunged approximately 4,000 feet from its last radar altitude reading of 9,300 feet and hit the side of the mountain at approximately 400 miles pre hour. The plane's wreckage was found on the east side of Wood Canyon in Riverside County.[14] As per reports from Air National Guard and the Air Force, Martin may have experienced vertigo in a snowstorm and did not hear the command from the Ontario Airport controller to change directions to avoid the mountain peak.[15]\n\nHis remains were interred at the Los Angeles National Cemetery, a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs cemetery, in Los Angeles, California.[16]\n\nMartin married the actress Olivia Hussey in 1971.[17] They had one child, Alexander (b. 1973), and divorced in 1978.[18] He married the Olympic gold medalist ice skater Dorothy Hamill in 1982,[19] and they divorced in 1984.[20] Martin also dated Candice Bergen and Tina Sinatra.[8]"
