        "text": "Dean Martin wasn't called the 'king of cool' for nothing. His charisma and stage presence were like no other, making him one of the most popular singers of the 20th century. He was a member of the Rat Pack, an actor, a television host, comedian and star of the concert stage. Martin was married three times and had seven children. Dean Martin was born in 1917 in Steubenville, Ohio. Born to Catholic parents, his father Gaetano was Italian born and his mother Angela, Italian-American. His upbringing was storied and would inform much of his later work. Martin was a high school dropout: believing himself to be smarter than his teachers but also due to being bullied for his heavy Italian accent. At the age of 15 Martin began boxing and is said to have won 11 out of his 12 matches. His rugged good looks were likely a result of the bare-knuckle boxing rounds he held in his apartment with Sonny King. During this time Martin also worked as a bootlegger, dealer and stock boy in an illegal casino and eventually, a bit performer in local nightclubs. During much of the 1940s, Martin was a relatively unknown nightclub singer, once opening for Frank Sinatra but flopping nonetheless. Martin met Jerry Lewis in 1946 and their friendship would eventually lead them both to their own television series. Martin and Lewis eventually parted ways and Martin began starring in television shows movies on his own. His big breaks were on the drama “The Young Lions” and in the movie “Some Came Running”. Martin starred in more than 60 movies, had a long running variety show on NBC and recorded more than 100 albums. His most iconic roll was likely in the Rat Pack: a singing/comedy foursome with Frank Sinatra, Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. In 1993 Dean Martin was diagnosed with lung cancer. He passed away by December 1995. Martin died at home surrounded by family and loved ones at the age of 78. “Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime” is engraved on his tombstone."
