The cause of death has not yet been determined, family members announced on Saturday. He was 62.\n\nGone But Not Forgotten: In Memoriam 2016\n\nIn recent years, Martin had been performing in a touring tribute show to his famous father. In the 1970s, he released the single “Stop, Look Around” and album Beached, collaborating with Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys, who produced the album and would later become his brother-in-law.\n\nMartin performed at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas and other clubs in the 1990s with Desi Arnaz, Jr. and Billy Hinsche, taking the place of his late brother Dean Paul, who in the 1970s had formed a successful rock band called Dino, Desi and Billy with the others. Dean Paul Martin was killed in a military jet crash in 1987.\n\nMartin authored a 2002 book, That’s Amore, about growing up in Beverly Hills, Calif., as part of his large and colorful family. In the memoir, he recalled a party that was thrown at his family’s home for his 21st birthday that was attended by, among others, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Elizabeth Taylor, David Bowie and Elton John.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nHe was born on Sept. 20, 1953. Divorced, he is survived by three daughters, Pepper, Montana and Rio; by his mother, Jeanne Martin; an older brother, Craig, and by four sisters, Gail, Deana, Gina and Sasha."
