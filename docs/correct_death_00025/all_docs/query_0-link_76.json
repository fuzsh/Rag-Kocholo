        "text": "Here’s a dilemma: How do you maintain a home’s iconic spirit of Rat Pack cool, yet make it attractive to buyers of luxury homes who demand the latest amenities?\n\nIt was quite a challenge, according to developer Patrik Mirahmadi. He bought crooner Dean Martin‘s former Beverly Hills, CA, residence in 2014, and spent the past three years getting every little detail just right. The home is finally on the market for $27.95 million.\n\n“I try to consider the heritage of all my properties,” says Mirahmadi. In this case, there was little of the original home that could be saved and brought up to code, so he expanded the footprint and carried on the Martin tradition of consummately cool entertaining.\n\nThe Rat Pack legend lived in the property from 1988 to 1995. He’d likely be blown away by the new waterfall-style bar in the great room, which can accommodate 150 to 200 party people.\n\nAnd the eventual buyer will be able to make a grand entrance in this modern palace. The 10,047-square-foot, single-story home is accessed by crossing a modern moat and passing through a walnut pivoting door set in walls of glass and marble.\n\nMartin was known for throwing swinging dinner parties, so Mirahmadi designed a “floating” dining room—surrounded on two sides by the moat—guaranteed to impress even the most jaded guests.\n\nOn one wall, there’s a glass-enclosed, temperature-controlled wine room which displays up to 450 bottles.\n\nAnd when the party spills outside through the motorized Fleetwood glass doors, guests will find open patios, a fireplace, deck with built-in seating and fire pit, pool and spa, and kitchen with barbecue, range, beer tap, and refrigerator.\n\nThe home now has five bedrooms, six baths, and three half-baths. There’s also a gym and spa with massage room and sauna. The master suite features a fireplace, his-and-her closets, and a lavish bathroom.\n\n“This house has the most amazing feeling,” says listing agent Jade Mills, of Coldwell Banker Global Luxury. “It’s contemporary, but it has a very warm feeling. It’s cozy yet elegant.”\n\nMirahmadi credits the warmth to the walls of glass with views of the mature foliage and green canyon. The developer says he left as much of the original greenery as possible in place, but he also started new landscaping as soon as he bought the one-acre lot so that it would look lush and verdant when he was ready to sell.\n\nMartin was not the only member of the Hollywood glitterati to own this posh property. Actor David Janssen, star of the “The Fugitive” TV series, also lived there.\n\nOf course this part of Beverly Hills, known as Trousdale Estates, has always been a favorite of the A-list—Frank Sinatra, Tony Curtis, Elvis Presley, and Ray Charles have all called the neighborhood home."
