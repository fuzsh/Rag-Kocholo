        "text": "Did someone say “amore”? The Beverly Hills estate where Dean Martin lived from 1988 to 1995 is on the market for $27.95 million. Developer Patrik Mirahmadi bought the 10,047-square-foot home in 2014 and spent three years heavily remodeling the property after Martin lived there, according to Trulia and other records. Perhaps one of the most notable features of the home is the unusual entrance: A 200-foot driveway leads to a privacy gate and then a modern-day moat. Secure walnut, glass, and marble front doors are the final step to enter the crooner's former home. The spirit of the Rat Pack member, who was known for his dinner parties, lives on in the property with a great room that can hold 150 to 200 guests with a waterfall-style bar area. The glass-enclosed dining room opens up to an outdoor patio with a fireplace, fire pit, pool, and kitchen with a barbecue and beer tap. Inside the living quarters, the home features five bedrooms, six full bathrooms, and three half-baths, as well as an office, a movie theater, a gym, and a spa with a massage room and sauna.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nNicole Richie and Joel Madden List Their Beverly Hills Estate for $17.4 Million\n\nReports of the listing come just a few days after Joel’s twin, Benji Madden, and his wife, Cameron Diaz, listed their own Beverly Hills property for $17.8 million\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck List $68 Million Beverly Hills Compound\n\nAmid divorce speculation, the couple’s 12-bedroom mansion has officially hit the market\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nCameron Diaz and Benji Madden List Their Beverly Hills Farmhouse for $17.8 Million\n\nThe couple, who recently welcomed their second child, have owned the seven-bedroom manse since 2020\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nRyan Seacrest’s Napa Valley Estate Lists for $22 Million\n\nThe Northern California property spans more than 40 acres"
