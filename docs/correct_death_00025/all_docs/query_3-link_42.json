        "text": "Ricci Martin, a musician, entertainer and youngest son of show-business legend Dean Martin, was found dead Wednesday at his Utah home, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. The cause of death has not yet been determined, family members announced on Saturday. He was 62.\n\nIn recent years, Martin had been performing in a touring tribute show to his famous father. In the 1970s, he released the single “Stop, Look Around” and album Beached, collaborating with Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys, who produced the album and would later become his brother-in-law.\n\nMartin performed at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas and other clubs in the 1990s with Desi Arnaz Jr. and Billy Hinsche, taking the place of his late brother Dean Paul Martin, who in the 1970s had formed a successful rock band called Dino, Desi and Billy with the others. Dean Paul was killed in a military jet crash in 1987.\n\nMartin authored a 2002 book, That’s Amore, about growing up in Beverly Hills as part of his large and colorful family. In the memoir, he recalled a party that was thrown at his family’s home for his 21st birthday that was attended by, among others, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Elizabeth Taylor, David Bowie and Elton John.\n\nMartin was born on Sept. 20, 1953. Divorced, he is survived by three daughters, Pepper, Montana and Rio; his mother, Jeanne Martin; an older brother, Craig; and four sisters, Gail, Deana, Gina and Sasha."
