        "text": "HOMES OF THE WESTERN STARS\n\nDEAN MARTIN\n\nby\n\nSPECIAL GUEST BLOGGER\n\nBOB SILER\n\nPART TWO\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD YEARS – 1948 – 1995\n\nIn 1948 Dean and Jerry Lewis packed up their broods and left New York City for the film capitol of the world, Hollywood, California. The team of Lewis and Martin may not have lasted, but Dean became one of the busiest and most beloved film stars of all time, which is something one could never say about Jerry.\n\n1948 – 1949\n\n850 STONE CANYON ROAD – LOS ANGELES\n\nHe and Betty rented this house for $600 a month. It was their first Hollywood home.\n\n1949\n\n8800 SUNSET BOULEVARD – WEST HOLLYWOOD\n\nWhen Dean and Betty split up he moved out of their home and rented a small, funrished house here. They soon divorced.\n\nCIRO’S\n\n8433 SUNSET BOULEVARD – HOLLYWOOD\n\n606 NORTH BEDFORD DRIVE – BEVERLY HILLS\n\nHERMAN HOVER\n\nHover was the proprieter of ‘Ciro’s’, (now The Comedy Store) and was living here in the 1940s.

Their ‘wood and firestone’ house had three servents, six cars, swimming pool and tennis court. He paid $225,000 for the joint. He moved out in 1972 and he and Jeanne divorced.\n\nJANUARY 1973 – JUNE 25, 1976\n\n363 COPA DE ORO ROAD – BEL AIR\n\nDean married his third and final wife, Catherine Hawn, and they moved into this joint, which he shelled out $500,000 for. They moved out on June 25, 1976 and he sold the place to Tom Jones. In recent years Nicholes Cage has lived here.\n\nWith Catherine Hawn\n\nJUNE 25, 1976 – AUGUST 1976\n\n23544 MALIBU COLONY DRIVE – MALIBU\n\nDean and Catherine moved to this beach house.

DIED HERE.\n\nWESTWOOD\n\nBob Siler grew up in Burbank, not far from Universal Studios and Warner Brothers where they made his favorite monster movies. A long-time fan of Westerns, he still has a hard time believing that the great John Wayne could die. Bob has created many lists detailing where the famous and infamous lived, are buried, and the cars they drove. He has recently completed this list of Western Stars homes after many years. Burbank Bob now resides in Portland, Oregon.\n\nHOMES OF THE WESTERN STARS\n\nDEAN MARTIN\n\nby\n\nSPECIAL GUEST BLOGGER\n\nBOB SILER\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHowdy Fellow Film Lovers\n\nThis is your tour guide, Bob, with another trip to the homes of one one of yesterdays western film favorites. This time we’ll be visiting places where Dean Martin once lived.\n\nNow, some of you might think of Dean as nothing more than a singer, actor, comic and straight man to Jerry Lewis. But he was much more than that. He was a lover of western movies and a great western film actor. Dean wasn’t into the movie star social life of nightclubs and partys and when his wife, Jeanne would throw a big gathering at their home on Mountain Drive, Dean could always be found in the den watching a western instead of hob nobbing with the elite of the film world. He didn’t care if anyone was insulted either, producers, actors, actresses, if didn’t matter. He would not play the star game for anyone, not even his wife or best friend, Frank Sinatra. I’ve read several books on Dean and the one thing that comes across about him was that he was a decent guy.\n\nNo one seemed to have a bad thing to say about him. After twenty odd years of marriage, he and Jeanne divorced and he married a much younger babe. That marriage was short lived. In the end, it was Jeanne who took care of him until the day he died. And he made sure that she and their children never had to ask for anything. He was a good man.\n\nSo, put on your favorite Dean Martin album and lets stroll through the places he had called home.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nBob\n\n(By the way, my original tour also listed the homes of Jerry Lewis, which I did not include here. If you would like to have a list of Jerry’s homes just drop me an e – mail and I’ll get it to you.)\n\nTHE DEAN MARTIN TOUR\n\n(RIO BRAVO)\n\nPART 0NE\n\nFROM STUBENVILLE TO MANHATTAN\n\n1917 – 1940s\n\nSTUBENVILLE, OHIO\n\n1917 – 1930\n\n319 SOUTH 6th STREET\n\nHe was born here at the family home on June 7, 1917.\n\n1930\n\n118 BRADY AVENUE\n\nThe family moved to this house located on the northern end of town.\n\n1931\n\n630 GRAND VIEW AVENUE\n\nPLEASANT HEIGHTS\n\nThey next moved into this small brick house.\n\n1933\n\n1210 RIVERVIEW AVENUE\n\nThey moved into this small two – story gabled house with a backyard.\n\nIt overlooked the Ohio and West Virginia hills.\n\n1936\n\nNORTH SEVENTH STREET\n\nLived here for awhile.\n\n1941\n\nCLEVELAND HEIGHTS, OHIO\n\n2820 MAYFIELD ROAD\n\nDean and his first wife, Betty, moved here, their first home, after getting married.\n\n(With Betty)\n\nSTUBENVILLE, OHIO\n\n2130 SUNSET BOULEVARD\n\nDean’s parents were now living here.\n\n1943 – 1948\n\nNEW YORK CITY\n\n1943 – 1944\n\nLONDON TERRACE APARTMENTS – MANHATTAN (Chelsea area)\n\nDean and Betty’s first New York apartment.\n\n1945\n\nSTUBENVILLE, OHIO\n\n1101 CARDINAL AVENUE\n\nDean’s parents were living here.
