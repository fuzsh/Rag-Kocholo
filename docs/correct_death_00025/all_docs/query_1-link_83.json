        "text": "Ricci Martin, the youngest son of musical legend Dean Martin and a musician & entertainer in his own right who most recently performed in a touring tribute to his father died Wednesday in his home in Utah. His family made the news public today; no cause of death has yet been determined.\n\nBorn Ricci James Martin on Sept. 20, 1953, Martin grew up in Beverly Hills surrounded by Dean Martin’s famous friends and associates, experiences he recounted in his 2002 autobiography “That’s Amore,” which among other things detailed his 21st birthday party attended by the likes of John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Elizabeth Taylor, David Bowie and Elton John.\n\nAs an adult, Martin followed his father into the music business, releasing one album, “Beached,” with Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys producing, and a single called “Stop, Look Around” in the 1970s. In the 1990s he performed in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand with Billy Hinsche and Desi Arnaz, Jr., replacing his late brother Dean Paul Martin who had formed pop band Dino, Desi and Billy with Arnaz and Hinsche in the 1960s and died in 1987.\n\nMost recently, Martin toured in a tribute show to his late father, an example of which can be seen in the video below.\n\nMartin is survived by his three daughters, his mother, Jeanne Martin, his an older brother, Craig, and his four sisters, Gail, Deana, Gina and Sasha."
