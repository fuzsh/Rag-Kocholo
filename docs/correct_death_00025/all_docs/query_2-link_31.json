        "text": "Dean Paul Martin’s career encompassed a number diverse talents, showcasing his versatility and ambition. While his father was known as a world-famous entertainer, the younger Martin earned much of his early fame as a professional tennis player – he was even good enough to compete in the qualifiers at Wimbledon.\n\nDespite his aptitude for the sport, Martin decided to follow in his father’s footsteps and venture into the world of entertainment. Drawing upon his own experience, he was cast as a tennis pro alongside Ali MacGraw in the 1979 movie, Players. This was well received, and he was nominated for the Golden Globe for New Star of the Year – Actor.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Martin starred alongside Courteney Cox in the short-lived television series, Misfits of Science (1985-86). His final production was the 1987 film, Backfire – although, he wouldn’t live to see it.\n\nEnlistment in the California National Guard\n\nDean Paul Martin certainly had no shortage of pastimes, and flying was yet another; he earned his pilot’s license when he was just 16 years old. While carrying out his Hollywood career, he decided to enlist with the California Air National Guard in 1980. From there, he went into officer training with the US Air Force, via the Palace Chase program, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.\n\nMartin officially completed his training in 1981, having flown the Cessna T-37 Tweet and Northrop T-38A Talon. He briefly trained with the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with whom he flew a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, before being transferred."
