        "text": "He bought it in 1968. He and his 2nd wife Jeanne lived there until they divorced in 1973 and the house became her property. She owned it until she died in 1989, but it's not known if she lived there full time.\n\nYou'd think someone would have been able to snap this place up at a good price at some point and turned it back into a showplace. It seems in much better condition inside than outside.\n\nYep, you're right R8. I got the numbers wrong. She didn't die in 89, she was 89 when she died in 2016.\n\nSome said Dean died alone and was found the next day by his house help. But Jeanne said she was with him when he died and had crawled into bed with him and held him.\n\nA few things. As someone else pointed the trash cans look like new cans. So does the ac unit. Someone obviously cleans the interior. The driveway would get a power wash and look great. It is a shame that the exterior has not had jack shit done to it in years. I could see Dino sitting by the pool all tan and shit. Last, what is with the metal pull up down in the back?\n\nR10, I'm no real estate guru, but aren't property taxes based on the original selling price of the home? If Jeanne has owned it forever, the taxes wouldn't be as high as someone just buying it. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nJeanne's daughter Gina is still alive at age 64 and would potentially be the sole heir. (Dean and Jeanne's son Ricci died three weeks before Jeanne, and golden child Dean Paul infamously died in the plane crash in '87.) I don't know if Dean's children with his first wife would've been in Jeanne's will, but they seemed to have a good relationship with her. Dean Paul also had a son with Olivia Hussey when he was married to her; it would be interesting to find out who actually inherited the house, and why it's not been kept up or sold. They could easily sell the house for $1 million+ as is, just based on the lineage.\n\nR16, the metal pull-down thing in the back is installed often on homes that go unoccupied for a length of time. The last condo complex I lived in had a lot of snowbird owners, and most all of them had the pull-downs over their windows to prevent theft. It's odd--yet again--that there would only be one installed on this house, and on the back side. The ones in my condo complex had them over each window."
