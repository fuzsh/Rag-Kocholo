        "text": "Ricci Martin, the musician son of entertainment legend Dean Martin, has died. He was 62.\n\nMartin died Wednesday at his home in Utah, his family announced Saturday. A cause of death has not been determined.\n\nThe youngest son of Dean Martin, Ricci Martin became an entertainer, himself. In the 1990s, he joined the band Dino, taking the place of his late brother Dean Paul Martin. Martin later performed a touring tribute show to his father, singing his hits and telling stories.\n\nIn 2002, Martin wrote a memoir, \"That's Amore,\" about growing up in Beverly Hills, California, as a member of the famous family.\n\nMartin is survived by three daughters, Pepper, Montana and Rio; his mother, Jeanne Martin; his older brother, Craig; and four sisters, Gail, Deana, Gina and Sasha.\n\nHis loss was felt locally as well.\n\nRose Angelica, one of the organizers of the Steubenville Dean Martin Festival in Steubenville, was in Connecticut last week, performing with Ricci's sister Deanna.\n\nDeana has since flown to California to be with family.\n\n\"Steubenville and the Dean Martin Committee want to convey our deepest condolences and say how sorry we are for this terrible loss at this time,” Angelica said. “We’re just all so shocked about it. It was just so sudden and unexpected, so no one really know what’s going on.\n\nThere is still no word on a funeral date. Angelica says she expects it will be sometime this week."
