Dean Martin, the pop crooner and movie actor who with Jerry Lewis formed one of the most popular comedy teams in movie history, died Monday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 78.

"Dino," as he was known to his old-time show biz cronies and generations of fans, died of acute respiratory failure at 3:30 a.m., said his longtime publicist, Warren Cowan.

"Dean was my brother _ not through blood, but through choice," said Frank Sinatra in a written statement. "Our friendship has traveled down many roads over the years and there will always be a special place in my heart and soul for Dean.

"He has been like the air I breathe _ always there, always close by," the statement said.

Lewis, on tour Monday, was "completely shattered and grief-stricken" at news of Martin's death, said Lewis' manager, Joe Stabile.

The multifaceted Martin, with rugged good looks and a melodic baritone voice, perfected an on-camera and on-stage image of a laid-back alcoholic.

More than one guest on his phenomenally popular television variety show, which regularly attracted 40-million viewers from 1965 to 1974, went to Martin's dressing room after the show expecting to find a paralytic drunk only to be offered coffee and cake. The glass Martin carried on-stage usually contained nothing stronger than apple juice.

"You son of a . . . " one guest said, cracking up the joke-loving star, "You're stone cold sober!"

Although the image of an alcoholic was largely an invention, Nick Tosches' 1992 biography of the singer, Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams, portrayed him as a heavy drinker late in his life.

Known as chief deputy to the chairman of the board in Sinatra's "Rat Pack," Martin followed in the tradition of Sinatra, Perry Como and other Italian singers, frequently commenting that they all copied the style of veteran crooner Bing Crosby.

Although he was best known for comedy, Martin's more than 50 films include a handful of critically acclaimed serious acting roles, as in The Young Lions with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift in 1958, Some Came Running with Sinatra in 1959, and Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo with John Wayne also in 1959.

The son of an Italian immigrant barber, Martin was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917 in Steubenville, Ohio. Bored with high school, he dropped out in 10th grade, only to spend his adult life embarrassed by his poor English grammar and lack of education.

He boxed in the welterweight class as Kid Crocetti, permanently scarring his hands. He also stole hubcaps, bootlegged booze, and worked as a gas jockey, a soda jerk and a steel mill laborer.

Then he got into gambling in the Ohio "Little Chicago" area where he grew up, working as a stick man on roulette and a croupier on blackjack. He hummed as he worked, to patrons' delight, and sang after hours with a band at Walker's Cafe.

He first sang professionally in Columbus, Ohio, as Dino Martini, a name picked because of its similarity to a popular opera star. He got $50 a week _ an amount he said he could steal each week in the gaming rooms. Then he got a contract to sing in Cleveland, and he became Dean Martin.

In 1946, Martin met the young Jerry Lewis when both were appearing at the Glass Hat in New York. Soon after they were put on the same bill at the 500 Club in Atlantic City, N.J.

Making up their own material, Martin attempted to sing while Lewis interrupted as a bumbling bus boy. A legendary team that was to delight the nation for a decade was born.

The odd couple _ the handsome crooner and the awkward, goofy kid _ moved on to New York's Copacabana, television's Ed Sullivan Show and in 1948 to Hollywood.

Martin and Lewis made 16 movies from My Friend Irma in 1949 to perhaps their best remembered and final Hollywood or Bust in 1956.

But the partnership broke up in 1956 when Martin refused Lewis' directive that he play a lowly policeman in The Delicate Delinquent, which Lewis wrote. Martin claimed he could no longer deal with Lewis' egocentric demands.

"Two of the greatest turnin' points in my career were, first, meetin' Jerry Lewis, second, leavin' Jerry Lewis," Martin said in 1967. "I became a real actor because of these two things."

After foundering for a couple of years after splitting with Lewis, Martin rebounded, recording Volare, which sold 3-million records in 1958.

About that time, he got a bid to join Brando and Clift in The Young Lions, at a miserly salary of $20,000, considerably less than he was used to earning for a film. He leaped at the chance, however, saying he would have done it for nothing to work with the acclaimed dramatic stars.

In 1964, Martin was one of the few non-rockers to top the charts, when his Everybody Loves Somebody hit No. 1.

Martin was married and divorced three times _ to Elizabeth McDonald from 1940 to 1949, with whom he had four children, Craig, Claudia, Gail and Deana; to Jeanne Riegger from 1950 to 1973, with whom he had three children, Dean Jr. known as Dino, Ricci and Gina; and to beauty parlor receptionist Cathy Hawn from 1973 to 1976.

Dino, an actor who was also a captain in the Air Force National Guard, was killed in 1987 when his Phantom jet fighter crashed into a California mountain in a storm.

Despite repeated bouts with ulcers, which belied his relaxed style, Martin kept himself in relatively good physical condition with daily golf and other exercise and a reasonable diet.

"With all the children and grandchildren, I'm old," he joked in 1984. "But I don't feel old. . . . Death don't come to me. I'm not going."
