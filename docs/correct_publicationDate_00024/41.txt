Iain Banks (1954-2013) was a Scottish novelist who wrote science fiction as Iain M. Banks, adding his middle initial, to differentiate between his regular literary fiction and his science fiction novels. He is perhaps best known for his The Culture series of books. Banks has been named one of “The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945” by The Times daily newspaper in the UK.

Banks made his debut as a published author with The Wasp Factory in 1984. Since that time, he has split his time between his Culture books (the series started in ’87) and standalone novels such as Stonemouth. Below is a list of Iain M. Banks’ books in order of publication and in chronological order:
