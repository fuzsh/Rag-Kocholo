It didn't leave me thirsting for more, though I will have a look at one of the novels at some stage just because people whose opinions I respect rave about them.\n\nThere were too Culture stories, I found the second one (The State Of The Art, of the title) irritating and smarmy, maybe you're supposed to. Or does that mean I wouldn't like the novels at all?\n\nI loved the first story, Road of Skulls - it begins feeling a bit like something out of Thomas Hardy, but then....!!!\n\nDescendent was also a very powerful tale.\n\nAnd then he threw in that Lockerbie story\n\nThe woodcut style illustratrions by Nick Day are terrific and refreshingly unusual for an SF collection.\n\nHe's also good when he's wearing his Thriller writer's trousers, as Iain Banks - COMPLICITY was raw, witty and very entertaining.\n\nOriginally posted by Rumfuddle\n\nI've only read The State Of The Art, a collection of stories. It didn't leave me thirsting for more, though I will have a look at one of the novels at some stage just because people whose opinions I respect rave about them.\n\nThere were too Culture stories, I found the second one (The State Of The Art, of the title) irritating and smarmy, maybe you're supposed to. Or does that mean I wouldn't like the novels at all?\n\n[SNIPPAGE]\n\nThe Culture does come across as smug but then it is after a society that believes that it has achieved the nearest thing to Utopia this side of death and purposefully maintains this state of affairs. See this: http://cdr.sine.com/cdr/shell.cfm?action=article&id=139 for more Culture background info by the author.\n\nThink of the Culture as the boy scout who interferes because he *knows* that it is for your own good. The Culture books on the other hand, are stories of what happens when things don't go the Culture's way or when the Culture's interference goes disastrously wrong.\n\nJust adding to the chorus of Iain M. Banks fans suggesting that you check them out.\n\nS"
