I don't have copy's of them any more but would like to get some idea as to how long they were, and some people must have them on kindle.\n\nI'm specifically looking for the Player of Games and Excession, but all would be useful.\n\nThanks\n\nWord count is a bit too much of an e-measure for me, but old fashioned pages is another way of describing the length of a book, if I recall.\n\nPlayer of Games 309 pp\n\nExcession 451 pp\n\n(Both Orbit paperbacks)\n\nHow accurate does it need to be? All I want to know going in is, it is a long book, a short book, or somewhere in between. I guess pages work for me as I'm used to thinking in pages. I guess word count works for folk who are used to that.\n\nI guess word count is more accurate, but when deciding if a book seems long or short I definitely look at the number of pages first. I've just seen that Matter is 204,000 words long, but not sure about others.\n\nThese include all the text, so it includes the copyright and publishing stuff and the beginning and end of the book:\n\n174,567 Consider Phlebas\n\n115,264 The Player of Games\n\n62,517 The State of the Art\n\n134,937 Use of Weapons\n\n152,359 Excession\n\n119,445 Inversions\n\n119,539 Look To Windward\n\n183,775 Matter\n\n201,058 Surface Detail\n\nFair bit of variation there so I guess it would be fair to say Banks used however many words he felt each story needed!"
