Writes fiction (including science fiction) and one factual book.\n\nQ.When is Iain Banks' next reading/promo tour?\n\nA. Iain will be appearing at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on Wednesday 16th August 2006. He will also be at 'alt.fiction' in Derby on the 28th of April 2007.\n\nCheck the appearances thread of the official forum for up-to-date info. As he cut up his passport in protest over the last Gulf War, don't expect any non-UK appearances in the near future.\n\nQ. Have any of Iain Banks' books been made into films or TV shows?\n\nA.'The Crow Road' was adapted into a TV mini-series for the BBC in 1996. 'Complicity' was released as a film in 2000. Rights to film 'The Wasp Factory' are still the subject of lengthy legal dispute. Iain has said he'd like to see 'Consider Phlebas' filmed now that special effects technology could handle the scenarios: \"I wouldn't even mind if they changed the ending, have Arnold Schwartzenegger play Horza - he wins and gets the girl! But what I'm really dreading is they're going to make the spaceships look all wrong.\" <back to top of page>\n\nQ.Are any of Iain Banks' works available as an audiobook?\n\nA. Several of his books have been recorded. Unabridged books include Dead Air, The Business, Raw Spirit. Abridged books include The Algebraist, Song Of Stone, The Wasp Factory, Whit, Walking On Glass and, ahem, The Bridge.\n\nQ.When is Iain Banks next appearing on TV/Radio?\n\nA. The Radio 4 'history of science-fiction' series 'Imagining Albion' featured Iain in two episodes, talking mainly about the Culture. It also featured some brief readings of his work. Links to these excerpts can be found at the top of the page.\n\nHe was TVon over Christmas 2005, winning his episode of Celebrity Mastermind with 'malt whisky and the distilleries of Scotland' as his specialist subject. Follow this link for those questions, along with educational and informative hyperlinks ;) As captain of the Writers team, he also made two winning appearances on University Challenge; questions to follow if I get a really slow day at work.\n\n<back to top of page>\n\nLATEST PROJECTS\n\nQ.What is Iain working on at the moment?\n\nA. His next non-science fiction work, \"The Steep Approach to\n\nGarbadale\" (formerly known as 'Matter') is listed for release in March 2007. Banks originally said that this novel would be 'more surreal and not entirely based on our reality'.\n\nThe Little,Brown website decribes the book as follows: \"Dark family secrets, a long-lost love affair and a multi-million pound gaming business lie at the heart of Iain Banks' fabulous new novel . The Wopuld family have built their fortune on a board game called EMPIRE. It has transferred remarkably well to the computer generation and now the American Spraint corporation want to buy them out. Alban, who has been evading the family tentacles for the last few years, thinks the yanks should be treated with suspicion - but he also has other things on his mind. What was it that drove his mother to take her own life? And has he ever really got over Sophie, the girl he had a teenage love affair with and who will be present at the forthcoming family gathering in their highland castle?\".\n\nQ When is the next Culture novel out?\n\nA.Well, the next 'M' is probably due in 2008 and that could well be feature the Culture.\n\n<back to top of page>\n\nON WRITING\n\nQ.Does Iain Banks base his ideas on people he knows?\n\nHe has said not - \"too dangerous - I need all the friends I can get and have no desire to get biffed on the nose because someone thought their portrait was unflattering\". For the Iain Banks 'food processor' approach to using real world characters and events in novels see issue 7 of the Banksoniain\n\nQ.Was Iain Banks' first novel autobiographical?\n\nA.Whichever way you define his 'first novel', the answer's No.\n\nQ.Do any novels cover both science fiction and 'normal' fiction?\n\nA.Yes - 'State of the Art' (Iain Banks has said so in interview). Possibly also 'The Business' (possible starting point of something like the Culture on earth) and, as often mentioned on the Iain Banks Forum, 'The Bridge'.\n\nQ. Does Iain Banks write to an outline?\n\nA. Yes. \"Making it up as you go along doesn't work for me, I like to know what I'm doing. You allow yourself some leeway and sometimes thing go off in an unexpected direction. Having said that 'The Business' didn't quite work that way and turned out the most different to all of my works... it did have an outline, but it was more honored in the departure than the execution of it. It turned out fine and it actually looked like it was all totally planned. Which was probably more luck than anything else. It was a slightly unsettling experience.\n\nQ. Does Iain Banks carry out much research before writing his books?\n\nA. Direct quote: \"as little as possible\"\n\nQ. Will Iain Banks publish work in other literary genres than science fiction?\n\nA. Unlikely given his aversion to research, he once said that he'd \"found his two niches\".\n\nQ. How long does it take for Iain Banks to write a book?\n\nA. He usually seems to start writing in September and aim to finish by the year end: '3000 words a day, eight hours a day, five days a week' (source: Guardian interview, 1999)\n\nQ. What was Iain Banks' first novel?\n\nA. His first novel, written when he was 14, is unpublished. It was a spy story heavily influenced by the works of Alister MacLean. His first published work was The Wasp Factory.\n\nQ. Has Iain Banks had any unpublished work?\n\nA. Well, his first novel (see question above) is unpublished. As is his second novel, a 'near-future satire/comedy). Influenced by Joseph Heller's Catch 22 and John Brunner's Stand On Zanzibar, it ran to over 400,000 words. His next three books - Use of Weapons, Against A Dark Background and Player of Games - were unpublished in their original form.\n\nQ. Why does Iain Banks write in two different genres?\n\nA. He had no joy in finding a publisher for his first three SF books (see question above) and so wrote The Wasp Factory to try and make a name for himself via 'mainstream' fiction. He has said that if Player of Games had been published the first time around, he may have only written SF and so feels 'privileged' to be writing in two genres.\n\nQ. Why did Iain Banks become a writer?\n\nA. He has said that there was no single incident; he enjoyed writing at school, his teachers were impressed, his parents were happy about this and so was he when he found out that people called 'writers' got paid for writing!\n\nQ. Has Iain Banks ever experienced writer's block?\n\nA. Not really, in his words 'trivial' compared to other writers. He did suffer a hiatus during the Gulf War whilst writing Crow Road - he ended up watching the TV news instead of writing.\n\n<back to top of page>\n\nWITH AN M\n\nQ.Is there a list of the Culture ships?\n\nA.Indeedy. See the link at the top of the page.\n\nQ.Why does he use a middle initial for some of his work?\n\nA.It's to identify his science fiction works. M is for Menzies.\n\nQ.Which of his books feature The Culture?\n\nA.In published chronological order; Consider Phlebas, The Player Of Games ,Use Of Weapons,(short bits in State of the Art), Excession, Inversion, Look To Windward\n\nQ.What timescale (in Earth terms) do the Culture novels cover?\n\nA.7000 BC - Birth of the Culture\n\n14th Century AD - Consider Phlebas\n\n19th - 21st Century AD - Use Of Weapons\n\n1977 AD - \"The State Of The Art\"\n\n22nd Century AD - Look To Windward\n\nAnd this version takes in more detail from the novels (source: alt.books.iain-banks Culture FAQ)\n\n7250 BC : Phage Rock first inhabited.

Note: +/- 100 years but Excession events definitely after The Player Of Games.\n\n2170 AD : Light from the Twin Novae Battle reaches Masaq' Orbital; events of Look To Windward.

When did the Culture first appear in an Iain Banks book?\n\nA. Strictly speaking, it was in 'Use of Weapons' which was first drafted in 1974. The first published novel featuring the Culture was 'Consider Phlebas' in 1987.\n\nQ. If the Culture is Iain Banks' image of utopia, was the Idiran empire his image of dystopia?\n\nA. \"Pretty much. The Idiran empire was to be the antithesis of the Culture; deeply religious, racist (well, speciesist), centralist, warlike and basically fascisistic\".\n\nQ. How does Iain Banks think up the names for the aliens in his work?\n\nA. Direct quote from interview: \"I could tell you, but then I'd have to wipe your memory\"\n\nQ. Apart from the book covers, have illustrators used Iain Banks' books as inspiration?\n\nA. Yes - take a look at the excellent work over on www.fastness.co.uk\n\nQ. Why doesn't Iain Banks always write about the Culture in his SF work?\n\nA. He says that he feels very protective towards his non-Culture SF novels; although he finds writing about the Culture enjoyable he's \"terribly reluctant\" to be seen to be only writing a book series to give \"SF junkies\" their \"regular fix\".\n\nQ. Where can I find the epilogue to Against A Dark Background, not included in the book?\n\nThe Culture Data Repository site has a copy here (opens in new window).\n\n<back to top of page>\n\nWITHOUT AN M\n\nQ.Has he written any non-fiction?\n\nA.Yes - Raw Spirit, 2003. He visits lots of Scotch malt distilleries, gives his opinions on the whiskies, all wrapped up in a travelogue/semi-autobiographical style.\n\nQ.Does the 'happy ending' of the Bridge really appear in another of his novels?\n\nA.Yes - it's in Complicity\n\nQ.Will there be a sequel to 'The Wasp Factory'?\n\nA.Asked this in an interview he said: \"I'd do it if I thought of a total cracker of an idea that would carry the book beyond the initial idea (though I think this is unlikely to happen). I don't think I would if it was just for money. But then ask me when/if I'm poor and maybe I'd change my mind.\" He's also said that \"I had an idea that Frank was going to go in search of his mother - that was the plot. I even had a title, The Lost Wax Method.\"\n\nQ.Which of his 'non-M' books is Iain Banks' favourite?\n\nA.'The Bridge' (also his overall favourite as well, with 'Use Of Weapons' being his second fave)\n\nQ. Is Crow Road autobiographical?\n\nA. 'Very, very small bits' are biographical (he did have an aunt who fell through a greenhouse) but he's said that Prentice's life hasn't got anything to do with his own (source: interview, 1999)\n\nQ. Is there such a place as Espedair Street? And does Wykes Folly exist?\n\nA. Yes and No. Espedair Street can be found in Charleston, Paisley. Wykes Folly is \"kind of an amalgam of various things, slightly weird properties on that side of Glasgow...the exact place is fairly well-defined, because it's on a corner between three different streets. I think when I wrote it, it was an old tenement, a block of flats, and I think they'd already boarded it up because it was about to be knocked down. I think it's now an office building or something, in the exact position.\" (source: Time Off interview, 1995)\n\n<back to top of page>\n\nOTHER STUFF\n\nQ.What tracks did IMB choose for his Personal Effects Songbook CD?\n\nA.1.

Who are Iain Bank's favourite authors?\n\nA. \"Jane Austen, Tolstoy, Graham Greene and Saul Bellow. Loads of underrated science fiction authors - M. John Harrison should be a megastar, but he probably couldn't be because he's too rarefied a taste, I suppose; John Sladeck, who should have been the Terry Pratchett of the Seventies; and I've always had a soft spot for Barrington J. Bayley.\"\n\nAnd a few scince fiction writers to add to that list; Brian Aldiss, Bester, Jorge Luis Borges, John Brunner, Arthur C. Clarke, Samuel Delaney, Alasdair Gray, Ursula LeGuin, Frank Herbert, Aldous Huxley, Ken MacLeod, Jeff Noon, Kim Stanley Robinson, Dan Simmons, Olaf Stapledon, Vernor Vinge, Kurt Vonnegut, Ian Watson, Gene Wolfe\n\nQ. What books have had an impact on Iain Banks?\n\nA. Catch 22 and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are the last two books which had an enormous effect on me before I started to get my own stuff together. These are the two most influential books of my formative years. Everything you read affects you to some extent.\n\nQ. Does Iain Banks have a favourite whisky?\n\nA. In interviews he's said that his favourite blend is Johnnie Walker Black Label and his favourite single malt is The Macallan (he toyed with the idea of using the name John B.
