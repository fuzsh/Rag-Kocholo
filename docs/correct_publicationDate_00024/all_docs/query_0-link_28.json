        "text": "Iain Banks (1954-2013) was a Scottish novelist who wrote science fiction as Iain M. Banks, adding his middle initial, to differentiate between his regular literary fiction and his science fiction novels. He is perhaps best known for his The Culture series of books. Banks has been named one of “The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945” by The Times daily newspaper in the UK.\n\nBanks made his debut as a published author with The Wasp Factory in 1984. Since that time, he has split his time between his Culture books (the series started in ’87) and standalone novels such as Stonemouth. Below is a list of Iain M. Banks’ books in order of publication and in chronological order:\n\nPublication Order of Culture Books\n\nConsider Phlebas (1987)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Player of Games (1988)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe State of the Art (1989)Amazon.com | Amazon.deUse of Weapons (1990)Amazon.com | Amazon.deExcession (1996)Amazon.com | Amazon.deInversions (1998)Amazon.com | Amazon.deLook to Windward (2000)Amazon.com | Amazon.deMatter (2008)Amazon.com | Amazon.deSurface Detail (2010)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Hydrogen Sonata (2012)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Culture: The Drawings (2023)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nArrows Of Eros(1989)Amazon.com | Amazon.deDark(2000)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Space Opera Renaissance(2006)Amazon.com | Amazon.deCrime Scenes Revisited: Scottish Popular Fiction(2006)Amazon.com | Amazon.deShoreline of Infinity 8½: Edinburgh International Book Festival Special Edition(2017)Amazon.com | Amazon.deBurning Brightly(2021)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nIf You Like Iain M.
