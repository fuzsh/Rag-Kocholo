        "text": "Iain Menzies Banks (1954-2013) was born in Fife, and was educated at Stirling University, where he studied English Literature, Philosophy and Psychology. Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984.\n\nHis first science fiction novel, CONSIDER PHLEBAS, was published in 1987. He continued to write both mainstream fiction (as Iain Banks) and science fiction (as Iain M. Banks), and was acclaimed as one of the most powerful, innovative and exciting writers of his generation. He died in 2013."
