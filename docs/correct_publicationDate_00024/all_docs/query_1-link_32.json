        "text": "It is not specifically called a \"cauldron\", but this could well be the \"cooking pot\" communication device, described in The Algebraist. This Iain M. Banks novel, published in 2004, indeed falls outside his Culture series.\n\nThe device is described as:\n\nAn incongruous-looking device which looked like an ancient iron cooking pot: a black-bellied urn a couple of metres in diameter, capped with a shallow dome and sitting on a tripod of stubby legs on the buttery sheen of the solid gold floor. Its surface was pinstriped with thin vanes, but otherwise it resembled something almost prehistoric.\n\nThe cooking pot device received a transmission in the form of an artificial intelligence construct, which manifested as a hologram of an admiral. Having artificial intelligence, the construct could indeed respond to questions in a limited way, making communication more efficient.\n\nThis seems like a mix of two things from The Algebraist: the precompiled chatbot is the \"emissarial projection\" Fassin talks to which is described as:\n\na many-branched array of statements, questions and answers, with a set of rules governing the order in which they are expressed, [which] is able to carry out what seems like an intelligent conversation.\n\nI think you're getting the cauldron part from the actual AI that he meets later, which is described as being housed in a 'cooking pot device\"."
