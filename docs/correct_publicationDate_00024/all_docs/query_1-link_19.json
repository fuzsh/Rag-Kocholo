        "text": "I’ve just now needed to look back at something I wrote in Iain M. Banks, and I was reminded again how complex the chronology of his work is. The order in which his books were published is not the same as the order in which they were composed, and both differ again from the internal chronology of the Culture sequence.\n\nSo here, just for the record, and just to keep things clear in my own mind, are the three chronologies (for extra clarity, I’ve highlighted the Culture novels):\n\nOrder of composition\n\nThe Top of Poseidon (unpublished)\n\nThe Hungarian Lift-Jet (unpublished)\n\nThe Tashkent Rambler (unpublished)\n\nUse of Weapons\n\nAgainst a Dark Background\n\nThe State of the Art\n\nThe Player of Games\n\nThe Wasp FactoryConsider Phlebas\n\nWalking on Glass\n\nO (unpublished)\n\nThe Bridge\n\nEspedair Street\n\nCanal Dreams\n\nThe Crow Road\n\nComplicity\n\nFeersum Endjinn\n\nWhit\n\nExcession\n\nA Song of Stone\n\nInversions\n\nThe Business\n\nLook to Windward\n\nDead Air\n\nRaw Spirit\n\nThe Algebraist\n\nThe Steep Approach to Garbadale\n\nMatter\n\nTransition\n\nSurface Detail\n\nStonemouth\n\nThe Hydrogen Sonata\n\nThe Quarry\n\nNote the long gap, more than a decade, between writing Consider Phlebas and the next Culture novel, Excession. The gap doesn’t look so huge when you consider the next chronology:\n\nOrder of Publication\n\nThe Wasp Factory (1984)\n\nWalking on Glass (1985)\n\nThe Bridge (1986)\n\nConsider Phlebas (1987)\n\nEspedair Street (1987)\n\nThe Player of Games (1988)\n\nCanal Dreams (1989)\n\nThe State of the Art (novella, 1989)\n\nUse of Weapons (1990)\n\nThe Crow Road (1991)\n\nThe State of the Art (collection, 1991)\n\nAgainst a Dark Background (1993)\n\nComplicity (1993)\n\nFeersum Endjinn (1994)\n\nWilt (1995)\n\nExcession (1996)\n\nA Song of Stone (1997)\n\nInversions (1998)\n\nThe Business (1999)\n\nLook to Windward (2000)\n\nDead Air (2002)\n\nRaw Spirit (2003)\n\nThe Algebraist (2004)\n\nThe Steep Approach to Garbadale (2007)\n\nMatter (2008)\n\nTransition (2009)\n\nSurface Detail (2010)\n\nStonemouth (2012)\n\nThe Hydrogen Sonata (2012)\n\nThe Quarry (2013)\n\nHere, the long gap in the composition of Culture novels is less apparent, but what does become noticeable is the stutter in the first decade of this century, when various personal issues broke up the smooth sequence of a book a year.\n\nBut the order in which the various Culture novels should be read is different again:\n\nInternal chronology of the Culture novels\n\nConsider Phlebas\n\nExcession (500 years later)\n\nThe State of the Art (100 years later)\n\nMatter (60 years later)\n\nThe Player of Games and Use of Weapons (both around 55 years later)\n\nLook to Windward (75 years later)\n\nThe Hydrogen Sonata (200 years later)\n\nSurface Detail (500 years later)\n\nThe whole sequence, therefore, covers some 1,500 years. These time periods can be calculated from internal evidence, usually references to the war in Consider Phlebas, (for instance, Look to Windward is built around the 800th anniversary of the war) though there are direct connections between The State of the Art and Use of Weapons. Inversions is the one Culture novel that does not have any obvious dating information."
