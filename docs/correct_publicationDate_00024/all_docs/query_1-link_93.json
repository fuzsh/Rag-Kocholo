        "text": "Walking on Glass by Iain Banks\n\nWell…this is a strange one. Iain Banks’ second novel, Walking on Glass, is not quite as well regarded as some of his others, but I really liked it. Banks had a rare talent for vastly varying styles; he was capable of big, imaginative ideas but also rreveled in the dirty and the grotty, the sordid and the nasty. Published before his first sci-fi novel as Iain M. Banks, Consider Phlebas, we see Banks begin to flirt with the big imaginative ideas in a novel which feels like a crossover between the Banks’ with and without the M.\n\nWalking on Glass follows three storylines. First is Graham Park, a young man who is hopelessly in love with the enigmatic Sara Ffitch. Second we have Steven Grout, who is beset by paranoid delusions that he is an alien General of an intergalactic war banished to Earth by his enemies. The final and most interesting storyline follows Quiss who, along with Ajayi, has been banished into a mysterious ramshackle castle, forced to play obscure and impossible games until he can solve the riddle ‘what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?’ The three seemingly disparate stories eventually tie together in a bewitching and unpredictable fashion.\n\nI’ll mention the weakness of Walking on Glass first; if this novel has any kind of meaningful message, and it does feel as if there is one straining to get out, it’s not particularly well conveyed. The slight hollowness to the book may be the cause of its less than rapturous reception, but if you just relax and enjoy the story Walking on Glass becomes much more palatable. Although the Quiss storyline is the most immediately interesting, with more than a little Mervyn Peake thrown in, all three hold interest. The connections between them are slight and insubstantial, but taken as three separate novellas I enjoyed all of them. In earlier moments this book seemed tame by Banks’ standards, but it isn’t too long until the grim edge of cheerful horror creeps in.\n\nAll three are well written, but it’s the description of the Gormenghast-esque castle that will stick in my mind. Banks wears his influences on his sleeve and makes no effort to hide them, but he also creates something which feels unique enough to make its own impact. Banks suffuses his setting with a palpable sense of despair and ennui and following Quiss as he prowls around the castle was, for me, the chief pleasure of this novel.\n\nAlthough the characters themselves aren’t among his most memorable, Banks does a wonderful job at articulating the neuroses and darkness which lure in the back of the human mind, particularly when in a state of shock. More than once I was left feeling deeply uncomfortable by the articulation of mental processes than I recognise in myself. I’m normally not a fan of lengthy descriptions of characters’ mental states, preferring a showing not telling approach, but Banks does it just so damn well!\n\nWalking on Glass is far from my favourite Banks novel, but it’s definitely not my least either. I’m rationing Banks, reading a couple a year because when they’re done they’re done. I’m looking forward to seeing whatever strange and twisted world Banks transfers me to next.\n\nComplicity by Iain Banks\n\nIt’s always a bit sad going through the left over books of a favourite author after they’ve died. You just know that the remaining number is finite, there’s a counter in the corner. I’ve thankfully still got lots of the non-sci-fi Iain Banks stuff to go thankfully, with Complicity being my favourite of these so far.\n\nCameron Cooley is a journalist in Edinburgh who gets through each day with a lethal cocktail of drugs and alcohol. He’s been receiving anonymous tips related to a series of unsolved murders from several years prior, against powerful and corrupt figures which seem to have been political in nature. As he investigates, it becomes clearer that he has some personal connection to these crimes. Meanwhile, we see a series of grisly and inventive new murders occur in the second person.\n\nComplicity is a very clever book with an entertaining, slightly pulpy edge. The visceral descriptions of brutal murders and kinky sex are designed to titillate and there’s a self consciously unpleasant pornographic edge to the whole thing, which I believe is the point. The title is Complicity and is all about the shared responsibility that all people have for the world that we live in, with the protagonist and antagonist having very different views on how this should be acted upon. By making the murders so weirdly fascinating the reader becomes complicit in them; however, maybe I’m just a sociopath who’s reading too much into it. Regardless, Complicity is a clever book which deals with weighty themes whilst never forgetting to be entertaining.\n\nThere’s really no one who captures that combination of a sardonic, one eyebrow cocked irony with crushing cynicism quite like Iain Banks. This book was frequently hilarious but left me feeling queasy and upset; that genuine gamut of emotional reaction is vital to his writing. I’m not sure if there’s anyone who walks that line as confidently as Banks did.\n\nCameron is a deeply flawed protagonist who’s done some pretty dreadful stuff, but he’s hard not to root for. I can’t really talk about the best character without spoiling the plot, all I’ll say is that one character delivers a multipage monologue about their motivations and it’s genuinely electrifying reading. Banks does a good job of ensuring that even minor characters have at least one trait to make them memorable.\n\nComplicity is a complicated and interesting book which is all about showing the worst of the world and bringing out that worst in the reader. It sounds negative and unpleasant and…well, it is, but it’s also an enjoyable read. This is a difficult trick to pull off and one that Iain Banks showed himself capable of time and time again.\n\nA Song of Stone by Iain Banks\n\nI’m slowly making my way through Iain Bank’s entire back catalogue; he was an incredibly diverse author, capable of tackling many different genres, tones and themes. A Song of Stone actually reminds me most of one of Bank’s sci-fi novels, Inversions. Both are clever, but neither are favourites.\n\nA Song of Stone takes place in an unknown country torn apart by civil war. Abel and his lover Morgan are aristocrats fleeing their ancestral castle, when a group of bandits led by a charismatic woman known only as The Lieutenant capture them and take them back to the castle, making it their base of operations. Abel’s entire sheltered existence is shattered by The Lieutenant and her men.\n\nIf there’s one thing Iain Banks wasn’t scared of, it was tackling taboos. A Song of Stone is disturbing in many ways, with a truly complex and unpleasant relationship at its core. The narrator Abel recounts everything in the present tense, giving an unpleasant immediacy to the whole thing. Still, this is also a novel about history, and how casually history can be destroyed by the present. It descends a little bit too much into long winded philosophising for my tastes, although generally the insights themselves are beautifully expressed and highly thought provoking. There’s a bit too much of a gulf between this and the narrative however; it’s actually a really good idea for a story, but it tries a little bit too hard and that damages the central narrative.\n\nAs I said though, the actual writing itself is gorgeous. A Song of Stone is written in a self-consciously arch style, with the irreverence and humour which characterised his Culture books not in attendance. It’s frequently beautiful, but I’ve got to say I prefer the irreverence. You can tell how much fun Banks was having when he wrote like that, whereas this book seems to come from a much darker place, the same place that provided The Wasp Factory. The Wasp Factory was brilliant though and A Song of Stone cannot quite compete.\n\nAbel is an interesting protagonist, not very likeable and difficult to trust. He’s haughty, seeing himself above the common folk who have suffered even worse than him. His treatment of the mostly silent Morgan is deeply unpleasant, reflecting inner weakness in Abel more than anything else. The real star is The Lieutenant, a fascinating character, possessed of an awareness and intelligence greater than that of her men. Unlike her soldiers who trash Abel’s castle with no thought to its grandeur, the Lieutenant understands exactly what is being done, and sanctions it. The desecration of the castle is a victory for her against those who had put themselves above her. Everything else fades in this novel behind the brilliance of the Lieutenant, and she’ll be the character I remember.\n\nA Song of Stone is far from Bank’s best work, but it’s an interesting one nonetheless. I don’t regret reading it, but there are much better books by him out there.\n\nThe Business by Iain Banks\n\nSince his death a few weeks ago, I’ve wanted to redouble my efforts to read Iain Bank’s entire breadth of fiction. I’ve read all of his sci-fi stuff, and The Wasp Factory, and still have plenty more to go. The Business was my next ‘Iain without the M’, and although it lacks the scope of the sci-fi or the compelling horror of The Wasp Factory, it’s still a damn good read.\n\nThe eponymous ‘Business’ is an ancient corporation which predates the Christian Church, with origins in the Roman Empire. The Business has fingers in many pies, with tendrils which extend around the world. Katie Telman was adopted into the Business at a young age, and has made a meteoric rise through the ranks for her accurate insights into developing technologies. She is summoned to Blysecrag, a Yorkshire stately home and Business base, to discuss the most bold plan by the Business in their history. The Business seek to purchase a small nation so that they can gain a seat at the United Nation, and Katie becomes a vital part of this plan, which unsurprisingly has more to it than it first seems.\n\nThe Business is an interesting idea, and Banks avoids going the obvious dystopian Orwellian vision route, but instead shows a more balanced view of this corporation and those who run it. In many ways, the presentation of the Business reminded me oddly of Iain Bank’s utopian Culture. The Business is not obviously sinister; in fact, they’re internally democratic and uniquely tough on corruption, but, much as with ‘The Culture’ we get the feeling that this utopian vision conceals a more sordid underbelly. By not presenting The Business as evil, Banks avoids the obvious route and instead does something much more interesting. Banks also gets to stretch his worldbuilding muscles, through the fictional Bhutan-esque Himalayan micro nation Thulahn, in which is a large portion of this novel takes place.\n\nThe actual story is interesting, although the central mysteries which Katie investigates throughout the stories are put on hold for much of the middle part of the book. A good mystery should weave throughout an entire novel, but instead we largely just engage with the actual main question at the beginning and end of The Business. Most of the middle is set traipsing around Thulahn, which while entertaining, charming and often very funny, takes us too far from the core narrative of the book. This stuff is important, don’t get me wrong, but it’s made all too easy to forget about the mysteries that should drive the book.\n\nBanks was such a great writer, with prose which can be utterly beautiful (and oddly psychedelic) but without getting ponderous and dull. He’s also incredibly funny, with his characteristically droll and sardonic outlook at its best here. Bank’s writing often feels like the literary equivalent of a sigh, a slight shaking of the head and a wry grin.\n\nThe Business is written in the first person from Katie’s perspective, and she makes a great protagonist; very flawed, but human and hard not to like. In his science fiction, his female characters could sometimes tend a bit too much towards the badass warrior chick cliché, although there are plenty of exceptions, but Katie is a well rounded and interesting protagonist. The supporting cast are usually entertaining caricatures, but that’s not really a problem.\n\nThe Business may not be Iain Banks at his best, but it’s proof that even when not firing on all cylinders her was an immensely talented, human and compassionate writer whose sardonic look at the world was unique. Banks wrote some truly transcendentally wonderful books, some enjoyable and entertaining ones (of which I count The Business) and yes, a couple of duds, but considering how much this guy wrote we can forgive that. Iain Banks; thank you for Use of Weapons, thank you for The Wasp Factory, thank you for Surface Detail, and thank you for the many other books of yours that I’ve loved. Reading the rest and discovering new favourites is going to be a hell of a ride.\n\nThe Wasp Factory by Iain Banks\n\nI’ve now read everything by Iain M. Banks, containing some of the most entertaining and thought provoking science fiction that I’ve ever read. There are two sides to him though, as he also stands as a critical darling of non-genre fiction, without the ‘M’ in his name. The Wasp Factory was Iain Bank’s first novel, and the first of his that I’ve read without the ‘M’; it’s one of the most deeply unpleasant books that I’ve ever read, but it’s also a work of absolute genius.\n\nThe Wasp Factory is narrated by Frank Cauldhame, a sixteen year old boy who had been crippled at a young age in an, at first, unspecified accident. Frank is a strange young man, observing a bunch of bizarre rituals of his own invention, and tormenting the animals around his house. Frank nurtures even darker secrets, as we are informed right at the beginning of the novel that he is responsible for the deaths of three children in his family. The manner and motivations for these murders are explained as the novel goes on. In the present day, Frank’s brother Eric has escaped from a mental asylum and is planning to come home.\n\nBanks conjures a great sense of place in his small Scottish island in which The Wasp Factory is set. Although likely a fairly normal island, Frank’s narrative turns it into a semi-mystical place, with every change of weather a portentous omen, protected only by the rituals which Frank enacts. Worldbuilding is a strongpoint of Iain M. Bank’s writing, and although he obviously isn’t crafting an alien culture as Iain Banks, he still creates a vivid and powerful setting.\n\nThe actual plot of The Wasp Factory is interesting, with the imminent return of the dangerously insane Eric lending the entire novel a foreboding feel. This feeling of foreboding is really the dominant characteristic of this novel; we don’t just fear the events coming, we fear discovery about the past. Frank’s actually not unlikeable as a character, and it’s easy to forget the terrible things that he’s done, so we fear discovering the stories behind his murders. Those who like a tightly structured plot may not be too enamoured with The Wasp Factory, but for atmosphere it really can’t be beat.\n\nBank’s ability to revel in darkly amusing sadism is something which I’d seen before in his science fiction, particularly the monstrous Archimandrite Luseferous from The Algebraist, but The Wasp Factory out nasties that novel hands down. The pain and torture in this novel is viscerally horrible, but Banks writes with this infectious energy that makes a little part of me amused. It’s this element of the novel which has most offended people, with the Daily Express comparing this novel to a ‘video nasty’ back when it was first released. The Daily Express, being the tawdry rag that it is, utterly missed the point here. There’s a constant ironic distance between the reader and Frank, but also between the murderous cruel part of Frank and another detached voice who is aware of how ridiculous his fantasies are. It’s this ironic voice which provides the sick laughs.\n\nFrank is similar to Alex from A Clockwork Orange, with a dash of Holden Caulfield thrown in for good measure. He’s not beholden to these characters however, and develops a pretty fascinating narrative voice. All of Iain Bank’s best characters are damaged, and Frank certainly deserves to stand alongside his best creations. Bank’s characterisation isn’t always brilliant; I wasn’t too impressed with his most recent release, The Hydrogen Sonata, but it’s absolutely top notch here.\n\nThe Wasp Factory is a nasty, unpleasant book. The squeamish will hate it, and many will write it off as gratuitous horribleness. If you have a dark sense of humour, and an interest in the darker sides of humanity, give The Wasp Factory a go, you won’t regret it.\n\nFeersum Endjinn by Iain M. Banks\n\nIain M. Bank’s novels have a tendency to be rather aggressively baffling, usually only revealing what’s going on right at the end if he does reveal it at all. I thought that The Algebraist and Against a Dark Background were confusing, but Feersum Endjinn reveals new layers of confusing to contend with. Is Feersum Enjinn worth the (substantial) effort that it requires? I would say yes. Just about.\n\nFeersum Endjinn is set in a distant future on an Earth almost unrecognisable to our own. A wave of settlers had already left Earth to colonise the stars, but this novel follows the ancestors of those who stayed behind, living like parasites in the shell of the grand constructions of the humans who had come before. Most of the novel takes place in Serehfa Fastness, a castle built to the proportions of giants, the origin or purpose of which is shrouded in mystery, ruled by King Adijine. Almost all of humanity are linked into vast computer network, a far flung evolution of the internet, known as the ‘cryptosphere.’ All human minds can have their states stored at the time of death, so resurrection is easy, although these resurrections are limited to eight in the physical world and then a following eight in the artificial reality of the ‘crypt.’ Time in the ‘crypt’ runs at a much slower pace to the base reality, with an hour in the real world corresponding to days in the ‘crypt.’ Humanity has stagnated, regressing into a feudalist social structure, with all this threatened by the Encroachment, a vast molecular cloud which threatens to dim the sun to the point of obliterating all life on Earth.\n\nFeersum Endjinn follows four characters, with their independent narratives alternating with each other in a repetitive structure. First, we have a mysterious, unnamed young woman who awakens in the gardens of a noble family with absolutely no memory of how she got there, who she is, or basic social norms, to serve a mysterious and oblique purpose. Next we have Gadfium, the chief scientific advisor to the King, who is part of a conspiracy to find a true solution to the issue of the Encroachment, believing that the King and the ruling elite are holding back this revelation for their own purposes. After Gadfium we have Count Sessine, a military general who is assassinated almost immediately and sent into the ‘crypt’ to live his afterlife, in which we follow him for most of the novel. Finally we have the child Bascule, a ‘teller’ who communicates with elements of the ‘crypt’, and is recruited by them to try to find a solution to the Encroachment. These disparate plot strands begin to spiral together as the novel wends towards its conclusion, but are still largely separate for most of the work.\n\nThe setting of Feersum Endjinn is really rather fascinating, and breathtakingly original as Bank’s settings tend to be. The ‘crypt’ makes for an interesting setting as well, with the artificial realities allowing some truly bizarre and intriguing figures and structures to exist. Feersum Endjinn can get somewhat self indulgent in its silliness at times; all of Bank’s best novels tread this line, but Feersum Endjinn teeters much more closely to the wrong side for comfort. There were plenty times that I felt myself rolling my eyes at the latest ridiculous vision Banks conjured, rather than enjoying them as I should.\n\nThe rigid rotating structure of the novel is interesting, but the plot is something of a mess. Feersum Endjinn feels at times like a melting pot of interesting and fun ideas all thrown together, but failing to cohere into a whole. It certainly doesn’t help that certain themes have been explored much more successfully in later novels, such as the issue of virtual afterlives in Surface Detail and time dilation in The Algebraist, which unfavourably colour this novel.\n\nThe use of language in this novel is…interesting to say the least. The young Bascule is dyslexic, with his entire narrative told phonetically in the first person. This is, at first, rather difficult and actually quite off putting. I wrote it off as a gimmick at first, but I found myself warming to it before the end. There’s something of Holden Caulfield in Bascule, such as in his regular repetition of particular turns of phrase, something which is very Holden-esque. Although he lacks Holden’s complexity, he makes up for it with a charm and likeability which Holden never manages to attain. A whole novel written in this style would have been a struggle, but thankfully Bascule only makes up a quarter of the book, so it doesn’t gain an opportunity to wear thin. As interesting, and eventually enjoyable, as this style is, as with many elements of this novel, there isn’t really a point to it. Is the central thrust of the plot, or the themes, boosted by this addition? I’m not convinced that it is. As it stands, Bascule’s odd and charming narrative is another nice ingredient thrown into the messy stew pot, but it doesn’t all come together into the best of meals.\n\nThe characterisation is a bit of a mixed bag as well; Bascule is charming, but no one else seems to have much of a personality. I quite enjoyed the odd moment following the sociopathic and disinterested King Adijine, the sort of villain which Banks excels in writing. Bank’s villains aren’t usually full blown violent psychopaths (well, Archimandrite Luseferous from The Algebraist excepted), but cold, uncaring, yet oddly charming figures with absolutely no interest in anything approaching a conscience, almost innocent in the depths of their selfishness. It was nice to see a female protagonist who isn’t a highly trained/genetically modified warrior badass (Sharrow from Against a Dark Background, Diziet Sma from Use of Weapons, Lededje from Surface Detail), but she still doesn’t have much in the way of a personality. Characterisation often isn’t Bank’s strongest area, but when he gets it right he gets it very right, and Bascule makes up for the less impressive other main members of the cast. Bascule, you can stand up there next to Zakalwe from Use of Weapons. You earnt it.\n\nFeersum Endjinn is an absolute mess of a novel, filled with great ideas and fun moments which never manage to come together to create something great. Feersum Endjinn is one thing though; fearlessly innovative and original, and many readers, myself included, will be able to look past the many flaws of this work to enjoy the good stuff. It all depends on what your tolerance for this sort of stuff is, and if it isn’t high, I’d give Feersum Endjinn a miss.\n\nThe Hydrogen Sonata by Iain M. Banks\n\nThe Hydrogen Sonata is the newest novel from Iain M. Banks, and his first return to ‘The Culture’ since 2010’s Surface Detail (which I loved). I always look forward to Bank’s ‘Culture’ novels, as I’m convinced that ‘The Culture’ is one of the most unique and entertaining sci-fi settings ever created. In many ways, the setting is one of almost limitless possibilities, acting as a unified setting for the box of literary toys which Banks brings out to play. However, as much as I love the series, not every novel is great (I remember really struggling with Excession) and sadly The Hydrogen Sonata is not one of his best.\n\nThis novel actually deals indirectly with the Culture, instead taking place in the civilisation of the ‘Gzlit’, a humanoid species who helped form the Culture ten thousand years before this novel takes place but decided to retain their independence at the last minute. Plenty of ‘Culture’ mainstays make an appearance, with a prominent role given to the multitude of amusingly eccentric ‘Minds’ which have always been one of the most entertaining aspects of the series. This novel explores one of the most interesting aspects of Banks’ universe, Subliming. We learnt all the way back in Consider Phlebas that certain civilisations reach a state of advancement that they ‘Sublime’ from the base reality into some greater one, somewhere between a parallel universe and heaven. The Hydrogen Sonata takes place in the month running down to the Subliming of the Gzlit people, and rather than giving us a lot of explanations as to exactly what Subliming is (although we do get some meaty clues to chew upon), Banks instead opts to explore the effect that such a humungous change would have upon a people.\n\nThe Hydrogen Sonata features a wide range of view points and characters, but the central narrative revolves around Vyr Cossont, a young woman who has had an extra pair of arms grafted onto her so that she can master an infamously difficult piece of music, the eponymous ‘Hydrogen Sonata.’ During her youth, she had journeyed in the Culture, and had met a man named Ngaroe QiRia, who claims to be almost ten thousand years old and to have been present at the original foundation of the Culture. A ship bearing a shocking revelation is destroyed by a Gzlit regiment to keep its message a secret, and suspecting that the truth of this message lies with QiRia, Cossont is recruited by another regiment to find her old friend and discover the truth about the ancient past of the parallel Gzlit civilisation and the Culture.\n\nThis central narrative is a lot of fun, and the most compelling of the novel. Sadly, many of the side plots serve only the confuse and slow down the pace of the novel. Although not hugely long by the standards of genre fiction, not a huge amount happens in this central arc due to constant flashes to other, somewhat less compelling, story arcs. This story contains far too much of something which really bugged me in Excession; Culture Minds talking to each other. The Minds are my absolute favourite part about the Culture series, but they are entertaining and interesting in comparison to the organics they interact with, and when a bunch of them spend most of their time talking with each other it is difficult to gather a real sense of personality from any of them. I firmly believe that Banks is at his best when focusing upon a relatively small group of characters in a tightly structured narrative, such as with Use of Weapons and The Player of Games, although one of my personal favourites, Surface Detail,was an exception to this. If Banks had focused more specifically upon Cossont, I believe that this could have been up there with his best.\n\nIf there is anything that I will remember from The Hydrogen Sonata it will be some of the wonderfully bizarre and hilarious images that he conjures. Banks’ talents as a comic writer are on full display, most notably in a description of an orgy featuring a man with over forty penises (penii?) which had me in stitches. Although I wouldn’t call any of Bank’s works ‘comedies’, he remains possibly the funniest writer in the genre today. The snappy and naturalistic dialogue that is one of Bank’s trademarks is very much present, but sadly the author’s flaws are on full display too. The action scenes remain as impenetrable and difficult to envision as ever, and we never get a particularly coherent vision as to what the Gzlit are actually like. There’s a potentially interesting aspect of Gzlit culture which is entirely unexplored; all Gzlit are enrolled into military service and hold rank, yet they are also a profoundly peaceful people. This intriguing disconnect begs for exploration which just isn’t there. Banks is such a wonderful writer, but he very often falls into these same traps with his sci-fi. Despite these criticisms Banks is still a joy to read, but perhaps he needs to hire a better editor or take slightly more time honing some of the action scenes.\n\nWhile Banks’ characters are not always necessarily the most complex, they are always entertaining. A motley crew of characters are almost all interesting and well defined, such as the neurotic sentient blanket Pyan, the sleazy and manipulative politician Banstegeyn and the usual bunch of eccentric AIs which populate the ‘Culture’ universe. Cossont is something of a departure from the incredibly competent hardened fighters who often act as his protagonists such as Sharrow in Against a Dark Background and Zakalwe in Use of Weapons, exceptional only in her musical talent. There’s often a feeling with Banks’ protagonists that they’ve seen it all before, that the events of the novel in question is simply a culmination of dramatic and often violent events which have shaped their past. Cossont on the other hand is not scarred and traumatised by her past, is in fact relatively normal (four arms notwithstanding), which far from making her boring serves instead to raise the narrative stakes, as we are dealing with someone who doesn’t possess a honed fighting instinct, and would rather be at home practicing the Hydrogen Sonata.\n\nIf you’re as big a fan of the ‘Culture’ books as I am, this review is somewhat irrelevant, as you’ll be getting this book either way. The Hydrogen Sonata isn’t a bad book by any stretch, but I must confess to being somewhat disappointed. This in no way shakes my faith in the series however, and I still eagerly await the next novel. For anyone who hasn’t read a ‘Culture’ novel before, and they can be read in pretty much any order (although you should read Use of Weapons before Surface Detail), this isn’t necessarily a great place to start. If you do want to give the series a go, start out with The Player of Games, which is also one of the shorter novels in the series so if you hate it you won’t have sunk too much time into it.\n\nAgainst a Dark Background by Iain M. Banks\n\nAgainst a Dark Background was Iain M. Banks first sci-fi work not set in ‘The Culture, and was written at a relatively early point in his career. Where The Algebraist is a story which simply could not have been told within ‘The Culture’, I’m not so sure that this is the case for Against a Dark Background, with Banks creating possibly his least coherent setting I’ve encountered, although also one of the most evocative and thought provoking.\n\nAgainst a Dark Background takes place in the Golterian system, in particular it’s capitol planet Golter, but with the odd visit to other planets. The relationship of the Golter system to Earth is not made clear, but it appears that these humans have no knowledge of Earth, and that Golter is in a state of stagnation. Although humanity has the technology to expand and reach beyond the cluttered mess that is the Golter system, they are held back by their own petty cultural rivalries. Golter is ostensibly ruled by a group known as the ‘World Court’, but significant influence is wielded by criminal gangs and bizarre religious cults. These varying cults are by far the best and most amusing part of the book; of particular note are the ‘Solipsists’, in which each individual member believes themselves to be God and all those around them to be their creations, yet somehow managed to bond together into a group despite this seemingly insurmountable obstacle. Also entertaining is the Kingdom of Pharpech, which are not atheists but ‘anti-deists’, who bitterly and loathe all gods and are ruled by a deluded man child. Banks isn’t an author who is particularly concerned with internal history and consistency of setting in his novels, but Against a Dark Background feels chaotic even by his standards. However, it is unfair to criticise the novel for not achieving something that it did not set out to do. Golter is a compelling setting, with a strong feeling of decay and stagnation. Banks provides a vivid portrait of a civilisation ruled by pettiness and corruption, which at times can feel uncomfortably close to our own poor beleaguered planet. If you are someone who is all about world building in their sci-fi however, I’m not sure that Golter will be for you.\n\nThe protagonist of the novel is Sharrow, a member of the aristocracy and former soldier. Sharrow’s ancestor had stolen an item of great worth from a violent cult known as the Huhsz, who in vengeance swore that the entire female line of his house must die before their Messiah can be born. The item stolen was one of the eight ‘Lazy Guns’, devastating weapons the nature of which become apparent as the novel rolls on, which has since vanished. The novel opens as the Huhsz have gained a legal licence to hunt Sharrow for a year; if she can survive the year or return the Lazy Gun to them she is saved. Sharrow goes about reuniting her old combat team to find the Lazy Gun, and what follows is a caper of sorts, as the team of vivid and entertaining characters travel the Golter system following trails and leads which can lead them closer to the mysterious Lazy Gun.\n\nThe story is a fun one, but is, like The Algebraist which I have previously reviewed, a structural mess. Sporadically throughout the novel, Banks flirts with a non-linear structure, a structure to which I am no means opposed if implemented thoughtfully and consistently with clarity. To see a great example of non-linear storytelling done right one should look no further than Banks own Use of Weapons (one of my favourite novels I’ve ever read), which used it’s non-linear and ambiguous nature to great effect as we explored the fascinating character of Cheradenine Zakalwe. However, I’m not convinced that Banks has achieved this so well here, which is surprising considering that Use of Weapons came out three years before Against a Dark Background. There are frequent chapters which flit back and forth between the present and the past almost at random, leading to an extremely jarring reading experience. Perhaps this was Banks’ intention, but the fact remains that this novel can at times be a chore to read. Other moments soar however, particularly the quiet moments in which Sharrow and her squad banter and reminisce, creating a wonderful sense of a group who went through hell together and made it out the other side.\n\nBanks remains an ambitious and eloquent writer, with this novel showing off some of the best dialogue I’ve encountered from him, particularly from some of the deliciously malevolent villains. Banks is excellent at conveying a tone, and the tone of Against a Dark Background is that of decay and darkness, somewhat lightened by a brutal and cynical sort of humour. It’s an interesting tone, completely at odds with the utopian Culture. Not every aspect of the novel is so successful however; I’ve never been particularly convinced of Banks’ ability to write action scenes, as many of them devolve into a confusing mess of explosions, gunfire and somewhat impenetrable futuristic lingo. I remember feeling the same way about Consider Phlebas, Banks’ first sci-fi novel. These problems are sadly on full display here, and it can just be very difficult to visualise what is actually happening. Again, this could be a conscious attempt to replicate the chaos and confusion of combat, but since Sharrow is so competent and in command of her surroundings, perhaps the readers should be allowed to share her clarity? Despite some flaws, Banks is doubtless one of the most ambitious writers in the genre, and is not content to simply rely on the plain prose generally favoured by many of his contemporaries.\n\nSharrow is an excellent protagonist, deeply flawed with a pronounced vindictive streak, yet fundamentally sympathetic despite that. It’s easy to grow attached to Sharrow’s team, such as the voluptuous and fun-loving Zefla and her stoic brother Dloan. These characters aren’t necessarily hugely well developed, but they are more than the simple caricatures which sci-fi military squads often become. The most entertaining characters are the secondary and tertiary ones, characters who only appear for a few chapters and then vanish again, or appear sporadically throughout the story. Really, the true protagonist of the novel is Golter itself, a sad, decaying system dying a slow and ignoble death.\n\nOf all of Banks’ works, this is probably the one that I struggled with most. Oddly enough, I can’t help but feel that this story would have made a better movie than it does a novel, as it would allow the snipping of some of the fat that bogs the novel down whilst also giving the action scenes some much needed clarity. I haven’t been overly impressed with Banks’ non-Culture works that I have read so far (although I much preferred The Algebraist to Against a Dark Background), so I look forward to getting back to the Culture with the recent release of the new novel in the series, The Hydrogen Sonata,which I shall be reading soon.\n\nThe Algebraist by Iain M. Banks\n\nIain Banks is something of an odd one; he’s achieved significant critical success through his ‘mainstream’ novels such as his 1984 debut The Wasp Factory. Critics with nothing but contempt for science fiction and fantasy adore him, yet he lives a secret double life as a strong candidate for the greatest living writer of science fiction. All of his sci-fi is published under Iain M. Banks, with his ‘mainstream’ literature released without the ‘M.’ The majority of his science fiction take place in a utopian galactic civilisation known as ‘The Culture’, beginning with 1987’s Consider Phlebas up until 2010’s Surface Detail. The links between these novels are relatively tenuous, with the odd cameo from a character from a previous novel or oblique references to the events of other novels forming the only real continuity. The Algebraist is the first science fiction book by Banks that I have read not set within The Culture, and Banks uses the new setting to craft a story which simply couldn’t happen within the confines of The Culture, whilst retaining much of what made the Culture books so entertaining.\n\nThe Algebraist takes place around two thousand years into the future, and humanity has reached the stars, entering into the benevolent tyranny of the Mercatoria, a bureaucratic empire built upon the belief that the entire known universe is a simulation and that when half of the population of the galaxy converts to this view, we shall be freed from it and enter into a greater reality beyond. Where AIs form a large part of the Culture books, with the sentient ships and drones generally being the most entertaining and amusing characters in whatever novel they appear, within the Mercatoria they are ruthlessly hunted down and destroyed due to an AI rebellion thousands of years earlier. Faster than Light travel has yet to be discovered within this setting, so interstellar travel is achieved entirely through wormholes which can only be stabilised within a ‘Lagrange Point’, a point where the gravitational force of two objects are equal, meaning that rather than orbiting one or another, the point stays relatively still…or something. I’m not a physics student, leave me alone! The construction of a wormhole is incredibly time consuming, taking centuries to stabilise, and so the destruction of a wormhole entrance is a major coup for anti-Mercatoria forces, leaving the system containing the wormhole utterly isolated for centuries at a time.\n\nRumours of secret system of wormholes, which would utterly revitalise the stagnating galactic community, leads a force from an alliance of long disconnected system which has fallen under the sway of the charismatic sadist Archimandrite Luseferous who launches an attack upon the Ulubis system, which he believes to contain the information needed to access this wormhole network, giving his fledgling empire the power to thwart even the galaxy spanning Mercatoria. The Dwellers, those who supposedly created this network, are creatures who exist within 99% of the gas giants of the galaxy (though not Jupiter or Saturn). They are a truly ancient civilisation, older than any other and one of the few independent species of the Mercatoria, with individuals living up to a billion years. The protagonist, Fassin Taak is a human ‘seer’, scholars who goes amongst the Dwellers to learn their secrets, artificially slowing their metabolism so that they may perceive time in a similar fashion to their ancient objects of study. Taak is drafted into the Mercatoria after they learn that the forces of Luseferous are descending upon Ulubis, and that the Mercatorial fleet shall not reach Ulubis for a year, as the Ulubis wormhole had been destroyed a century earlier. Taak is sent to Nasqueron, the gas giant of Ulubis, to go amongst the Dwellers and attempt to learn the truth of the secret wormhole network, so that he can lead a Mercatorial fleet to defend the system.\n\nPhew. Sound complicated? It is. The barrage of terms that the reader is almost immediately beaten around the head with can be off putting, as it makes earlier passages utterly difficult to follow. I don’t normally like glossaries during my books, feeling them almost always unnecessary, but one would certainly help here. When you finally wrap your head around this world though, it’s utterly fascinating, and a setting which I would love to read more novels within. The plot moves along fairly briskly, although there is an utterly unnecessary revenge subplot featuring two characters from Fassin’s past. A subplot must in some way support or complement the main story, but this story line seems to take place utterly independently from it, with the conclusion bearing no consequence on the wider narrative. This story is interesting, and would perhaps make a nice little novella to parallel the main story whatsoever, but inserted as it is throughout the novel it only serves to break the pace and bring us away from the much more compelling storyline of Fassin and the Dwellers. Banks has never been the most structurally tight author, but it feels particularly evident here, but where he usually surprises us in other novels by bringing together these disparate elements into an interesting convergence, he fails to do so in The Algebraist. Consequently, the novel is about 100 pages too long, and it can be difficult to not check out somewhat during the subplots.\n\nThe writing is as top notch as ever however. The somewhat staid writing style of a large amount of ‘hard’ science fiction is absent here, with Banks exhibiting a flair for language greater than perhaps any other in the genre. The comedy of the Culture books is exhibited here in full force; where it is usually the AIs in the Culture books, particularly the ships, which provide most of the laughs, here it is the absent minded and ancient Dwellers who provide the best comedy. These millennia spanning creatures are so utterly checked out from reality and the ‘earthly’ concerns of the wider galaxy that they view the human Fassin with nothing more than a bemused benevolence, constantly amused by our fast paced and violent ways. This is certainly one of the funniest novels which I have read in a long time. Banks is not a one trick pony, he conveys some pretty horrific scenes with a wonderful compassion and eloquence, without ever feeling the need to preach to the reader.\n\nWhilst the protagonist Fassin is a relatively bland figure, he is surrounded by some hilarious and interesting characters. Y’sul, his Dweller companion through Nasqueron, is constantly amusing and will likely end up everyone’s favourite character. The villain, Archimandrite Luseferous, is very much in the ‘Joffrey’ class of villain, a completely irredeemable and horrible sadist who is nonetheless oh-so fun to read about. The inventive tortures conjured by Luseferous upon those who defy him never cease to be hilarious in an ‘oh dear lord that is so unbelievably horrible’ sort of way. Banks has never been as much about his characters as about the world they inhabit, and his novels have never offered particularly complex character studies (with perhaps the exception of Cheradenine Zakalwe in Use of Weapons), and The Algebraist is no exception. The fast pace of the novel means that no single character is allowed much time to develop, but instead we are treated a long succession of entertaining and interesting caricatures, such as Fassin’s Uncle Slovious, who has chosen to live the remainder of his life in the form of a walrus and Quercer & Janath, a pair of Dweller minds who reside within one body. This isn’t really a problem in my opinion, but if you read novels for complex character studies, then this probably isn’t for you.\n\nThere are many things wrong with The Algebraist; it’s a mess structurally and seems wilfully difficult to read at first, but it successes outweigh these flaws. The novel is consistently funny, awe inspiring and original, with Banks dropping ideas and concepts which are always novel and interesting, showing an admirable effort to steer clear of cliché. If you’ve read other Banks science fiction and enjoyed it, I recommend this highly, it’s comfortably up to the standard of the Culture novels and easily eclipses weaker instalments such as Look to Windward and Excession. If you haven’t read any Banks before, I can’t say that this is a great place to start (The Player of Games is a far better launching point). The Algebraist is a very good book, falling just short of being great, yet I nonetheless recommend to anyone who has read Banks before or who enjoys science fiction which plays with utterly new and alien ideas."
