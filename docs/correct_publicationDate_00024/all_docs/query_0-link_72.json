        "text": "Matter - Signed First Edition of Science Fiction - 2008\n\nOnly the sister is not what she once was; Djan Seriy Anaplian has become an agent of the Culture's Special Circumstances section, charged with high-level interference in civilisations throughout the greater galaxy.\n\nConcealing her new identity - and her particular set of abilities - might be a dangerous strategy. In the world to which Anaplian returns, nothing is quite as it seems; and determining the appropriate level of interference in someone elseâ€™s war is never a simple matter.\n\nIain M. Banks quotes"
