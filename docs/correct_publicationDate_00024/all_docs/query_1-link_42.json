Banks, first published in 1988. It was the second published Culture novel. Like most of Banks' early SF work, it was a reworking of an earlier version, in this case from 1979. A film version was planned by Pathé in the 1990s, but was abandoned.\n\nAuthor : Iain Banks\n\nFirst Published : 1988\n\nSubjects : Anarchism\n\nGenres (Book) : Speculative fiction, Science Fiction\n\nOriginal Language : English Language\n\nThe Crow Road is a novel by the Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1992.\n\nAuthor : Iain Banks\n\nFirst Published : 1992\n\nSubjects : Scotland\n\nGenres (Book) : Suspense, Mystery, Fiction, Novel\n\nOriginal Language : English Language\n\nThe Wasp Factory is the first novel by Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1984. Before the publication of The Wasp Factory, Banks had written several science fiction novels that had not been accepted for publication. Banks decided to try a more mainstream novel in the hopes that it would be more readily accepted, and wrote about a psychopathic teenager living on a remote Scottish island. According to Banks, this allowed him to treat the story as something resembling science fiction – the island could be envisaged as a planet, and Frank, the protagonist, almost as an alien. Following the success of The Wasp Factory, Banks began to write full-time. The Wasp Factory is written from a first person perspective, told by 16-year-old Francis Cauldhame (\"Frank\"), describing his childhood and all that remains of it. Frank observes many shamanistic rituals of his own invention, and it is soon revealed that Frank killed three children before he reached the age of ten himself. The book sold well, but was greeted with a mixture of acclaim and criticism, due to its gruesome depiction of violence. The Irish Times called it \"a work of unparalleled depravity.\"\n\nAuthor : Iain Banks\n\nFirst Published : 1984\n\nSubjects : Scotland\n\nGenres (Book) : Fiction, Novel\n\nOriginal Language : English Language\n\nExcession, first published in 1996, is Scottish writer Iain M. Banks's fourth science fiction novel to feature the Culture, a fictional interstellar society. It concerns the response of the Culture and other interstellar societies to an unprecedented alien artifact, the Excession of the title. The book is largely about the response of the Culture's Minds to the Excession itself and the way in which another society, the Affront, whose systematic brutality horrifies the Culture, tries to use the Excession to increase its power. As in Banks' other Culture novels the main themes are the moral dilemmas which confront a hyperpower and how biological characters find ways to give their lives meaning in a post-scarcity society which is presided over by benign super-intelligent machines. The book features a large collection of Culture ship names, some of which give subtle clues about the roles these ships' Minds play in the story. In terms of style, the book is also notable for the way in which many important conversations between Minds resemble email messages complete with headers.\n\nAuthor : Iain Banks\n\nFirst Published : 1996\n\nSubjects : Anarchism\n\nGenres (Book) : Speculative fiction, Science Fiction\n\nOriginal Language : English Language\n\nUse of Weapons is a science fiction novel by Scottish writer Iain M.
