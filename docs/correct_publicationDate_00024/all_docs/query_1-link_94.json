        "text": "Writer of some popular novels televised over recent years, such as The Crow Road and The Wasp Factory. He also writes scifi novels under the name Iain M. Banks.\n\nGenerally I prefer the scifi novels, although these can be a bit hit-and-miss - he can release a book that's not particularly well-received in between two fantastic reads. Many of the books are known as Culture novels, in that they all take place in the same universe populated by the Culture, although the ones that don't tend to be similar in style. There's no need to read them in order however, as they involve different characters & there's no story arcs (as far as I know - I haven't read them all yet).\n\nAlthough I prefer the scifi, my all-time favourite is the non-scifi novel Whit. It's about a girl who lives a rather sheltered life in a religious cult started by her grandfather in Scotland. Sounds like an odd topic, but it's brilliant! The characters are all so full, that even though the cult is a strange one, you really feel for the girl on her painful spiritual journey. Iain signed my tatty old copy at a reading for The Algebraist, & I couldn't help but feel that he was secretly pleased to be signing such an ancient well-read book. Of course, all I managed to say was \"'nk you\"\n\nIain Banks is the one British author who I would really like to meet (I met TP, years ago!)\n\nPlayer of Games, Use of Weapons and all thosebooks were superb - until I got stuck in Feersum Enjin I had loved all his books, both sci-fi and general.\n\nSong of Stone also frustrated me a bit TBH, but there are so many that I regard as absolutely first rate - Complicity, Crow Road and the recent ones. I have the boxed limited signed edition of the one about the games company.\n\n\"Raw Spirit\" is a good read too. I have lost it through loaning it out!\n\nIain, Ben Elton and TP were the authors that I would always buy the new novels of, confident that 19 times out of 20, I'd love the book.\n\nI think that arguably Banks is the best British sci-fi writer of the last 40 years.\n\nDotsie said:\n\nGood to meet another fan! Have you read Matter yet? I've got it, but I haven't had time to sit down to it yet.\n\nNo, for some reason I don't think I have. Must have overlooked it - I was trying to include a wider selection of books in my reading and must have missed it.\n\nDotsie said:\n\nGood to meet another fan! Have you read Matter yet? I've got it, but I haven't had time to sit down to it yet.\n\nI was at the Con in Northamton last year where Iain and his mate Ken MacLeod were two of the GOH's, went to by Matter there and could not find it anywhere."
