However, the history of Chinese \"elegant gatherings\" suggests they were much more, such that they could quite naturally be viewed - and presented - as multimedia events.3\n\nThe following are some early examples of gatherings - perhaps types of or models for literary gatherings. They may include artistic expression, though in the past they would not necessarily have been considered as what we usually call performances.4\n\nGatherings of Confucius with his students (as described with the qin melody Apricot Tree Forum)\n\nConfucius is often depicted playing qin while teaching, and at a gathering described in Lun Yu his disciple Zeng Dian plays se (some say qin) then extolls gathering together to recite poetry and generally relax.\n\nThird century gatherings of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (including Ruan Ji, who could often be Wine Mad)\n\nDepictions of this perhaps inspired the painting by Chen Hongshou linked below\n\nThe late 3rd century gatherings at Jin Gu, the estate of Shi Chong (249 - 300), as mentioned in the Longing to Return Prelude.\n\nThese apparently involved music and painting as well as poetry.\n\nThe gathering at the Orchid Pavilion (Lanting) in 353 CE, as immortalized by Wang Xizhi (music for his preface)\n\nSuch events involving poetry and Floating Wine Cups were originally ritual events (\"xiuxi\") but the term might later have had more general use.\n\nGatherings inspired by tbe Song dynasty Western Garden Elegant Gathering\n\nVarious artistic depictions of this are listed below\n\nGatherings themed around the Four arts\n\nArtistic depictions may show 18 Scholars, inspiring the melody Yingzhou\n\nGatherings of women\n\nThe focus here may often be on music. See, for example, Court Ladies, \"after Zhou Wenju\".\n\nMany old paintings depict gatherings such as those mentioned above. One example is shown above right; others are linked here. At such gatherings the literati are said to inspire each other through their arts: seeing calligraphy may inspire qin music; the music may inspire a poem, and so forth. There is some further discussion of this, with more associated art, under Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar. Based on the images there and here it may be tempting to distinguish between these two expressions by applying the term \"yaji\" to gatherings where the participants are all collected together, and the term \"Four Arts\" where they seem to be gathered within the same space but within this there are separate focuses; this, however, is quite likely reading too much into the images.5\n\nLiterati gatherings could also be literary gatherings (ææ wenhui) focused on conversation and not necessarily include other arts. An early example of a depiction of such a gathering is Literary Garden, \"after Zhou Wenju\".6 \"Literary Garden\" apparently did not catch on as a generic title; one that did was \"True Simplicity Gatherings\",7 the originals of which were apparently organized by Sima Guang (1019â1086). There does not seem to be any evidence that Sima Guang's gatherings included qin, but later depictions sometimes do include them.8\n\nThe ideal of a multi-media artistic gathering is underlined by the many paintings that were done of the best-known event specifically referred to as a \"yaji\", already mentioned and depicted above, said to have taken place in 1087 in the Western Gardens of çè©µ Wang Shen (1037-ca.1093), a noted calligrapher and connoisseur who had married a daughter of the Song emperor Yingzhong and lived in the capital city, Kaifeng. The famous guests said to have been in attendance at this gathering includes quite a few mentioned elsewhere on this site.9\n\nThere is extant today an account of this gathering. It is attributed to Mi Fu himself, but most likely it was actually written several centuries later.10 Just as likely, at the time of its writing its account of a multi-media event involving various arts was not a presentation of a new idea. But how far back one can trace such gatherings perhaps depends on how one defines them. For example, how many arts must be included? As already mentioned, today qin players usually use the term yaji for occasions when they get together simply to play for each other. There may be a long history of such qin gatherings with this term applied to it, but have there been any proper studies of this? Would parties where people would be expected to write poems have been considered as ya ji\"? Have there been any writings that satirize as pretentious the claims by people who call their own gatherings \"elegant\"?\n\nFurther research is necessary to show the true origins and various natures of historical yaji. In this another interesting comparison might be with the \"clear talk\" (Qing Tan) meetings popular around the time of the Six Dynasties.\n\nFor further connections with the qin one can always look for the sort of melodies that might have been inspired by such a gathering. For example, the Account of the Elegant Gathering in the Western Garden by Mi Fu, copied below, mentions Gui Qu Lai, a poem by Tao Yuanming set for qin in a handbook publishedin 1511. In this context it would also be natural to listen to any such melodies while looking at the sort of paintings or calligraphy the scholars themselves might have been looking at during the gathering.\n\nFootnotes (Numbers refer to entries in Zhongwen Dacidian)\n\n1.

Liu Songnian (compare other early gatherings)\n\nLittle is known of this painter other than he lived in Hangzhou during the Southern Song dynasty. According to the website of the National Palace Museum, Taiwan,\n\nThis volume depicts the grand meeting of Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu, Yuan Tong and other eminent dignitaries in the Song Dynasty in Wangshen West Garden. Sixteen people were divided into four groups: Wang Shen, Cai Zhao and Li Zhiyi watched Su Shi write calligraphy; Qin Guanting listened to Chen Jingyuan playing Ruan; Wang Qinchen watched Mi Fu's inscription on stones; Tao Qian went back and came back for pictures; Liu Jing talked with Master Yuantong about the theory of non-existence. Despite this extensive description of the people said to have been at the gathering, many scholars say this event never actually happened. Nevertheless, depictions of the Elegant Gathering in the Western Gardens (often, as here, with the names of the famous people written above them) are said to date back to one attributed to æå ¬éº Li Gonglin (1049-1106; further), one of the supposed attendees. Although the attribution of that painting to Li is questionable, the idea of such meetings became very popular during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and they were often depicted in classical and popular art. Many of these can be found online, the one here having been selected because it is one of the ones that shows someone holding a qin: see left of center.\n\nThe following list of people said to have attended the Western Garden Elegant Gathering includes the following names.

The accompanying description says, According to legend, in 1088 a group of sixteen famous statesmen, literati, and artists gathered in the Western Garden of Wang Shen, an imperial son-in-law. The scholar and artist Mi Fu (1052â1107) purportedly wrote an account commemorating the occasion, and Li Gonglin (d. 1106) is said to have painted a scene of the gathering. Regardless of whether this event indeed took place, it entered the cultural imagination and became both a model for later literary gatherings and a theme in painting. Here, the scholar Su Shi is seated at one table practicing calligraphy while Wang Shen and others look on. At another table, Li Gonglin paints a scene taken from literature. Behind them, Mi Fu stands with a brush in hand, inscribing a stone face, and across a bridge a Buddhist sits in a bamboo grove engaged in a discussion on Nirvana.\n\nThe famous people said to have attended this gathering are discussed further above.\n\nMeanwhile, searching the National Palace Museum website for \"ææå\" yields quite a number of paintings on the the following paintings on the literary gathering theme\n\n(Return)\n\n3. Yaji as student recital\n\nIn the qin world today \"yaji\" most commonly refers to a gathering at which qin players play for each other. The most common attendees at such gatherings are the students of one teacher, though often their friends or other guests are invited. Such an event might include some social activities or a lecture; in other cases it might be compared in some ways to a student recital.\n\nI do not know to what extent such gatherings for students of other instruments are also called \"yaji\", nor is it clear what the history is for this usage of the term.\n\n(Return)\n\n4.
