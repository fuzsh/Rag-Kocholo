        "text": "Address the recipient appropriately (both title and name)\n\nDouble-check the spelling of your lecturer or tutor’s name and their title. Use 'Professor' or 'Prof.' only for academics with the title 'Professor'. Try to avoid gendered addresses like ‘Mr.’ or ‘Mrs.’\n\nSome lecturers and tutors might allow you to address them by their first name, but it's better to wait until they have told you that's how they'd prefer you address them. In some cases, you can address your tutor or lecturer by their first name if they have routinely used their first name only to sign off on emails sent to students.\n\nIntroduce yourself\n\nTell your lecturer who you are, especially if this is the first email you are writing to them. They may have to deal with dozens of emails and students per day.\n\nTry to figure out the problem by yourself first\n\nIf you cannot find a suitable answer, then email. Check the information that is already available on the websites before emailing.\n\nProofread before sending\n\nAlways read through your email before you click the ‘Send' button. Have you included an appropriate salutation, title and sign off? Is your spelling and grammar correct? Grammarly is a useful (and free) tool for identifying mistakes."
