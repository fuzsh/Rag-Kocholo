        "text": "Du Fu, one of the two most celebrated poets of the Tang, was very much a product of his era in the way that he found a usable past in Han-dynasty verse, episodes, and people. From 750 on, his writings were replete with allusions to the Han, some subtle and others more forthright. Taken together, these allusions suggest his firm beliefs in the course of history determined by human moral agency, in morality as “a man's own charge”; also in the role of fate determining the succession of dynasties, even as he deplored the workings of capricious fate on individual lives. Such beliefs are unremarkable in content, being much closer to conventional Tang concepts of the individual than most commentaries on Du Fu allow.\n\n27. Du Fu’s poems on meeting Zheng and Li at Jingzhou are listed in Quanji, 8.16.4857–58, n. 49. Poem II was printed in full, though without translation, by James Legge, The Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, The She King or Book of Poetry (London: Oxford University Press, preface dated 1871), 123–25. For Du Fu’s intention to leave Kuizhou, which he considered barbarous and dangerous, see his fine poem Quanji, 7.14.3940–43; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 4, 202–5, Poem 15.57 (766); and n. 168 below. For an important study of Du Fu’s Kuizhou period verses, see Gregory M. Patterson, “History Channels: Commemoration and Communication in Du Fu’s Kuizhou Poems,” in Reading Du Fu: Nine Views, ed. Xiaofei Tian (Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2020), 41–55.\n\n33. Quanji, 10.20.5876–86; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 6, 127–31, Poem 23.3 (769). For Liu Wenjing and Pei Ji, paired in Jiu Tang shu, see Jiu Tang shu 57.2285–95, and historian’s assessment on p. 2303. Xiao He and Cao Shen had been paired by Ban Gu in his “Liang du fu” 兩都賦; see Hou Han shu 40A.1321 and 1344n13. Both men were from Pei 沛, the native place of the Western Han founder. See also Zizhi tongjian, 183.5730.\n\n45. Also, Quanji, 2.3.824–40; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 1, 284–86, Poems 5.3–5.5. Here, the phrase xingzaisuo is taken from Hou Han shu 後漢書 (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1965), 1A.15 (更始立光武為蕭王悉罷兵詣行在所). For Guangwudi as sili 司隸, see Hou Han shu, 1A.9; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 2, 284–87, Poems 5.3–5. The final couplet is: 今朝漢社稷 / 新數中興年.\n\n47. Quanji, 11.21.6168 and 6185–86nn71–72; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 6, 276–77, lines 158–59. The double nature of King Xuan’s reputation arises from the Han interpretations of two Odes believed to have referred to him. See James Legge’s annotation in The Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, The She King or Book of Poetry on “Liu yue” 六月, 281, for King Xuan as “a monarch of great merit”; and “Huang niao” 黃鳥, 301, traditionally written “in condemnation of king Seuen” [Xuan]). See also n. 55 below.\n\n54. Quanji, 5.10.2856–62; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 3, 236–39, Poem 12.40 (763). Quanji, 5.10.2866–70; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 3, 246–48, Poem 12.47. For Zhu You, see Hou Han shu, 22.769–71 and the lun 論 (pp. 787–88). Suzong in the crisis of 756 at Lingwu 靈武, praising Du Fu’s clansman Du Hongjian 杜鴻漸 (709–69) had compared him to both Xiao He and Kou Xi; see Wen yuan ying hua 文苑英華 (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1966), 885.3a.\n\n98. Eva Chou has provided a significant analysis on Du Fu’s use of the yuefu tradition. This turns on the distinction she makes between realistic and specific accounts of popular misery, for which the natural vehicle was “ancient style” (gu shi 古詩) verse and generalized treatments for which the yuefu style was the main model. See Chapter 2 in Reconsidering Tu Fu: Literary Greatness and Cultural Context (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 61–106.\n\n107. Wen xuan, 23.498; Wang Can, “Qi ai shi”; Du Fu in Quanji, 6.11.3240–45; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 3, 408–11, Poem 13.73 (764), has 傷心不忍問, where Wang has 遠身適荊蠻. Du Fu in Quanji, 5.10.3005–11; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 3, 296–301, Poem 12.85 (763), has 終作適荊蠻, where Wang has 獨夜不能寐. Du Fu in Quanji, 9.17.5191–94; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 5, 274–75, Poem 20.55 (767), has 天寒不成. See also David K. Schneider, Confucian Prophet: Political Thought in Du Fu’s Poetry (752–757) (Amherst, NY: Cambria Press, 2012), 138–41.\n\n119. Shi ji, 30.1428; Han shu, 6.177; Quanji, 7.13.3824–30; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 4, 358–59, Poem 17.32 (766), Poem I, 1646n7. See also Mei Tsu-lin 梅祖麟 and Kao Yu-kung 高友工, “Tu Fu’s ‘Autumn Meditations’: An Exercise in Linguistic Criticism,” Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 28 (1968), 60. Cf. Wen yuan ying hua, 710.4a–5a for record of a feast at the lake in 730 or 731; Shuofu 説孚 (Siku quanshu ed.) 46B.4a, for the lake as a place for recreation associated with Xuanzong.\n\n167. For Zhang Jiuling’s comment, see Wenyuan ying hua 709.13b; Quanji, 11.21.6165–93; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 6, 262–63. Yuan Jie, writing a letter to the senior official Wei Zhi 韋陟 in 759, cited “collecting common children’s ditties” as an indication of how a man living in the countryside was closer to popular opinion. See Yuan Cishan ji 6.92, dated to 759.\n\n171. Translation of fanzhao here following Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 1, 237–43, although the expression also has the Buddhist connotation of “introspection.” See Quanji, 7.14.3940–43; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 4, 202–5, Poem 15.57 (766, but possibly the following year) (cf. n. 26 above). This interpretation differs from that in Xiao Difei’s commentary and from the translations of both Stephen Owen and Martin Kern. See Kern, “Du Fu’s Long Gaze,” 154–57. See Quanji, 4.7.1785, n. 4. See Hanyu da cidian 漢語大辭典 (Shanghai: Hanyu dacidian, 1990), vol. 6, 517–18, which likewise quotes both this line and Chou Zhao’ao citing Zhu Xi’s comment on another Du Fu line, “The ancients’ rite of summoning the soul is not applied only to the deceased.” For later instances in Tang verse in which this expression suggests contacting old friends still living rather than the deceased, see, e.g., Quan Tang shi 540.6205, citing Li Shangyin 李商隱, “Chou Yang Shilang pingjian ji” 酬楊侍郎憑見寄; also Quan Tang shi 624.7178, citing Lu Guimeng’s 陸龜蒙 “Xu fang ping hou wen she yin ji Ximei” 徐方平後聞赦因寄襲美.\n\n192. Quanji, 7.14.4083–110, at p. 4085; Owen, The Poetry of Du Fu, vol. 4, 302–13, Poem 16.18 (766 at Kuizhou), quoted by Gregory M. Patterson, “Elegies for Empire: The Poetics of Memory in the Late Work of Du Fu (712–770)” Ph.D. dissertation (Columbia University, 2013), 233. See Analects 7.8, for the phrase lidai xingwang zhi you 歷代興亡之由.\n\n194.
