        "text": "Feb 5, 2012 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nFu Xi ä¼ç¾², also written ä¼ç§ or ä¼æ², also called Mi Xi å®ç¾² (also written å®ç§), or Pao Xi å ç§, (also written å ç¾², ç®ç§ or åºç§), is one of the Three Augusts ä¸ç or Five Emperors äºå¸ of Chinese mythology. He is therefore known as Xi Huang ç§ç or Huang Xi çç¾² \"August Shepherd\". His cognomen is Tai Hao å¤ªç (also written å¤ªæ) \"Great Brightness\", his tribal name Huang Xiong é»çæ°.\n\nFu Xi was the brother and husband of NÃ¼ Wa å¥³åª§. The couple was, according to legend, the creators of the world. Han period æ¼¢ (206 BCE-220 CE) stone bricks therefore depict Fu Xi and NÃ¼ wa with a human body ending in intertwining dragon tails, each of them holding an instrument of architects, namely compasses (ju æ¦) and rulers (gui è¦). The story of the couple was very widespread in southern China, where the Miao people è saw themselves as descendants of Fu Xi and NÃ¼ Wa. The two of them were, in other words, the parents of mankind.\n\nFigure 1. Fu Xi and NÃ¼ Wa\n\nRubbing of a relief stone from the Han period, showing Fu Xi and NÃ¼ Wa. The bodies of both end in dragon tails, but still have legs with claws. They hold compasses and rulers in one their hands each, while the other hand of each person reaches up to hold sun and moon. NÃ¼ Wa holds the moon, in the disk of which a toad and a tree are seen, and Fu Xi supports the sun, on which a bird is visible. 56 Ã 67 cm. Unearthed in Chongqing å´æ ¶, Sichuan, and kept in the Provincial Museum of Sichuan (Sichuan Sheng Bowuguan åå·çåç©é¤¨).

According to the books Huainanzi æ·®åå­ and LÃ¼shi chunqiu åæ°æ¥ç§, he is assisted by the spirit Gou Mang å¥è who pulls out the sprouts of all plants in spring.\n\nA story in the Shanhaijing å±±æµ·ç¶ says that the mother of Fu Xi was Lady Huaxu è¯è¥æ° who conceived when she tread on the footpint of the God of Thunder (Leishen é·ç¥).\n\nFu Xi is credited by several inventions, like the Eight Trigrams (bagua å «å¦) used for prognostication. Each one of the trigrams represented a formation of the cosm, like Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers, wind and thunder, and so on. According to the book Baopuzi æ±æ´å­ Fu Xi is also credited with the invention of the fishing net. In the song collection Chuci æ¥è¾­ he is called the inventor of music. The book Yishi ç¹¹å² says he invented matrimonial rites that are otherwise attributed to his sister NÃ¼ Wa. The Hetu ting fuzuo æ²³åæºè¼ä½ praises him as the one who told men how to use the fire.\n\nEmperor Tai Hao is not always identified with Fu Xi. According to other legends, Tai Hao had the surname Feng é¢¨. His officials had the designations of dragons. His residence was Chen é³ (modern Huaiyang æ·®é½, Henan), and he reigned over the lower course of the Yellow River. The families of this region with the surnames Ren ä»», Su å®¿, Xugou é å¥ and Zhuansou é è¾ (rather the ruling houses of these minor statelets of the Spring and Autumn period æ¥ç§, 770-5th cent. BCE) are said to be his descendants. Tai Hao or Fu Xi are also called Green Emperor (Qing Di éå¸ or Cang Di è¼å¸) and ruled over the East.\n\nSources:\n\nChen Quanli é³å ¨å, Hou Xinyi ä¾¯æ¬£ä¸, ed. (1988).
