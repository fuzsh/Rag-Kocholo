Mi Fu placed the cursive style of the Jin dynasty (265-420) in high regards as the standard, but he was critical about that of the Tang dynasty (618-907). This work is a written discourse about the cursive style, and is done in the cursive style fully similar to that of the Jin dynasty. The content includes hints of criticism for Tang calligraphers, such as the named Zhang Xu (張旭; appearing as 張顛, because of a taboo character due to Emperor Shenzong's name), Huaisu (懷素), Gaoxian (高閑), and Bianguang (辯光).. Dated: 2016. Topics: calligraphy in the national palace museum, chinese calligraphy, chinese cursive script, mi fu, china, tang dynasty",
