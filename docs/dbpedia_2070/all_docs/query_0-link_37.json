        "text": "Since the mid-1980s Chinese Calligraphy Art has undergone a radical change and has opened itself to experimentation. Contemporary Chinese Calligraphy has gradually lost its connection with Chinese language and has gradually strayed from the concept of linguistic unity which comprehends sound, signified and graphic sign. A vivid debate on Contemporary Chinese Calligraphy is involving art critics in China nowadays. Wang Dongling and the Modernists think that, despite many changes and influences, we can still refer to the traditional calligraphic lexicon to describe the calligraphic production of contemporary Chinese Art. They still remain deeply rooted in the signified system of Chinese writing, even if they break with the strict rules of Chinese classical aesthetic, contaminating their art with Western elements, especially from abstract art, and focusing on the stylistic exploration (which means a pictorial approach to calligraphy, a drastic reduction of the number of characters, a reshaping of characters). Wang Nanming and the Avant-garde think that “contemporary calligraphy is not calligraphy yet”. It is “anti-calligraphy”: the contrary, the deconstruction, and the negation of the traditional calligraphy. Their Art aims at a radical and total transformation of calligraphic art, annihilates Chinese tradition, rejects the use of legible characters, experiments with new languages and new media within the idiom of international contemporary art, in order to make people reflect upon human condition or to challenge conventional thinking. The result is the creation of works of art that could be assimilated to universally comprehensible forms of art, such as: Abstract art, Abstract expressionism, Conceptual art, Performance art, Contemporary dance, Multimedia art, and even Street art. This paper aims at showing how still valid and extremely productive are both these two theoretical and creative/practical approaches to Chinese calligraphy in China nowadays. Both of them reflect the aim of Chinese contemporary society at dialectically facing their past tradition and at opening to a new one as well. For all of these artists, Chinese calligraphy represents the starting point of the creative process but not the finishing line. The author thinks there can be no finishing line at all, but just an attempt to create a new artistic language that turned the art of calligraphy into a medium for global comprehension and communication."
