        "text": "Please watch it on the horizontal screen of your mobile phone\n\n[Northern Song Dynasty] Mi Fu Tiaoxi poetry volume paper running script 30.3cm × 189.5cm Palace Museum Collection\n\nMi Fu (1051-1107), whose initial name was Fu, with a Chinese character seal, was named lumen resident and Xiangyang Manshi, and later changed its name to Fu. His ancestral home was Taiyuan and later settled in Runzhou (now Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). The official went to wailang, a member of the Ministry of rites, and Zhao Ji, Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, called him a doctor of painting, known as “Minan Palace”. Mi Fu is good at calligraphy and painting, proficient in the art of identification and fond of collection. He has written the history of books, the history of paintings, the record of treasure chapter to be visited and the collection of mountains and forests. Mi Fu has worked hard and achieved the most in calligraphy all his life. There are many calligraphy works in the world, including Tiaoxi poem, Shu suti, Hongxian poem, duojinglou poem, elegy to the empress dowager, etc.\n\n“Tiaoxi poetry” has 35 lines and 394 words in total. It was last signed as “made on August 8, Yuanyou Wuchen”. It is known that it was written in Wuchen (1088), the third year of Yuanyou, the emperor of Song Dynasty. Mi Fu was 38 years old. It was only more than 40 days earlier than his other running calligraphy masterpiece Shu Sutie. It is not only a work in the period when his calligraphy and painting style gradually matured, but also a masterpiece advocating the style of calligraphy and painting in the Song Dynasty. At the beginning, there is a sentence “presenting Tiaoxi opera to all friends and Xiangyang Manshi”. It is known that his book is self written poetry, with a total of six poems.\n\nThis volume is written with a straight center and thick fiber. It is written quickly and freely. In particular, Yunfeng has rich changes in front, side, Tibet and dew. The twists and turns of stippling are transitional and coherent, and the lifting and pressing are natural and elegant without any trace of carving. Its structure is comfortable, the middle palace is slightly restrained, maintaining the balance of the center of gravity. At the same time, it is long and horizontal, stretching freely, and full of ups and downs. The font of the whole article leans slightly to the left, with a tendency of many sides, so as to level out in danger and strength. The style of the whole volume is natural, lively, varied and interesting, which reflects the typical appearance of Mi Fu’s calligraphy in his middle age. The composition layout has tended to be perfect. Although there is no visual and intuitive joint relationship between words, the movement is smooth and natural, such as flowing clouds and flowing water, reflecting freely, and the density of composition is unique. Wu Qizhen commented on this post in the book of calligraphy and painting, saying: “the pen is natural and unrestrained, the structure is comfortable, and it is similar to Yan Lu’s public calligraphy.” It shows the patriarchal clan system of this book and the artistic characteristics of Yan Zhenqing’s new ideas.\n\nAt the end of this volume, there is its son Mi Youren’s postscript: “on the right, there are poems by various friends, the authentic works of the former minister Fu, and the minister Mi Youren identifies Gong postscript.” After the paper, there is another Ming Li Dongyang ba. The collection seal includes “Ruisi palace seal”, “Shaoxing”, “Baiji seal”, “Xianyu”, “Luyou”, “Kou’s mouth longevity treasures”, “the grandson of the Western Chu”, “the seal of Shi Qi”, “Yang’s family collection”, “Quanqing treasure”, “Quanqing” (half seal), “Wulin qianzizhangyu appreciation books”, Xiang yuanbian, Liang Qingbiao and the internal seals of Qianlong, Jiaqing and Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty. And Xiang’s “Du” number. This post was once sent to Shaoxing’s inner house in the Song Dynasty of southern Tibet, and collectors’ offices such as Yang Shiqi, Lushui village, Xiang yuanbian and Liang Qingbiao in the Ming Dynasty. Lushui village re framed this post in the 10th year of mingzhengde (1516). Please quote Li Dongyang’s seal script: “Minan palace poetry Han” and inscribe it. Later, he went to Qianlong’s inner house in the Qing Dynasty and engraved the sanshitang Sutra. During the period of the Republic of China, Puyi brought it to Changchun and then flowed into the people. When the National Palace Museum was acquired in 1963, the six words “read, nourish, heart, work, don’t and hate” had been torn off, the word “carry wine” had been half lost, the word “do, feel and Ming” had been slightly lost, the seal head of Li Dongyang and the tail of Xiang yuanbian’s inscription had been lost, which had been re framed by the National Palace Museum, and the damaged words had been completed according to the photos before the damage.\n\nThe postscript of coral net, the postscript of Yu’s continued calligraphy and painting, and the first edition of Shiqu Baoji have been recorded."
