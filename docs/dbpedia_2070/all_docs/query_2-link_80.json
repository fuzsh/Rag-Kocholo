It's from the Long Fist (chang quan) lineage:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fict-rt_a1I\n\nTan Tui sets are used to teach basic footwork, stances, and strikes. It's given to beginner students usually before moving on to full forms. There are typically 12 of these that are performed, with movement usually on a straight line across the floor. You'll see these sets in styles founded on the Jing Wu curriculum. You'll see it in Chang Quan. I learned it while studying Mi Tsung Lo Han kung-fu.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nanswered Mar 30, 2021 at 14:20\n\nSteve WeigandSteve Weigand\n\n19.4k11 gold badge3434 silver badges7171 bronze badges"
