        "text": "Niu Yubo, Born in 1982, BA from Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts and MFA from China National Art Academy. A member of China National Art Association. As an award winning new generation ink painting artist, Niu Yubo has won numerous acclaims for his fine ink painting works of various figures both nation wide and worldwide. He's held a number of solo exhibitions across China and in SEA, Netherlands, Spain, etc. while participating in major art exhibitions such as France-China Joint Art Exhibition, World Expo China Art Exhibition (Gold Prize),Venice Biennale, etc. His artworks are permanently collected by China National Art Museum and various professional art organizations as well as personal collectors. in 2021, his ink painting of a young lady in summer dress (68×136cm) was auctioned by Artron Museum of Art for over USD36518.5. With solid academic training, Niu is famous for his use of lines to set base tone for his figure while using sfumato technique to blend the figure naturally with the background, as well as his subtle shifts between wet and dry brushes. his aesthetic pursuit is to build a world of tranquility and harmony outside the daily mundane and the chaos of modern life. his use of lines are delicate, fluent, often gives a sense of music rhythm, yet they are so natural that the viewer often are drawn by the mood created without noticing any techniques. Meanwhile, he likes to use colors to create a vintage feeling with a modern touch, and carefully chooses the type of paper that collaborates well with the overall feeling he's trying to achieve. this painting is hand attached with a protection layer underneath for easy keeping or framing."
