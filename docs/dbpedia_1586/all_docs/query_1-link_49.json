        "text": "agile\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\nAgile works great...to a certain size\n\nThe home team convenes to discuss AI deepfakes, the legal implications of generating an AI version of a dead comedian or a famous singer-songwriter, whether leaderboard rankings for AI models reflect reality, and the relationship between agile development and burnout.\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nForget the 10X engineer—it’s about building a 10X culture\n\nOn today’s sponsored episode, Ben and Ryan talk with James Simmonds and Tristan Sheppard, both principal software engineers and engineering leads in the power trading department at Shell, about how a century-old company is working to evolve into a place where developers and engineers love to work.\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\nHow terrifying is giving a conference talk? (Ep. 589)\n\nConnell, a UK-based .NET developer and senior software engineer at Stack Overflow, tells the home team about his path to software development via text-based RPGs, his work on Stack Overflow’s Community Enablement team, why Agile gets so much hate, and what he’s learned giving conference talks to developers.\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nThe meeting that changed how we build software (Ep. 579)\n\nJim Highsmith, an original signatory on the Agile Manifesto, tells Ben and Ryan about what software development looked like at the time of the Apollo program, the evolution of user interface, and the meeting where “17 adventurous techies changed the world.”\n\nSeptember 23, 2022\n\nWe hate Scrum and Agile...when it's done wrong (Ep. 489)\n\nWhen it's done wrong, it becomes punitive micromanagement. When it's done right, it empowers everyone to tackle the problems they handle best.\n\nAugust 4, 2022\n\nGreat engineering cultures are built on social learning communities\n\nFor a successful Agile and DevOps practice, organizations need to think beyond tooling. Engineering organizations need a strong community of practice culture that supports the collecting and distributing of knowledge, greater cross-organizational collaboration, and breaks down the silos that can happen in companies of all sizes.\n\nJune 29, 2020\n\nDoes scrum ruin great engineers or are you doing it wrong?\n\nA question on Stack Overflow’s Software Engineering site caught our attention recently. It tries to come to terms with the impact of scrum on developers' ability to do a great job. The claim is a bold one: Scrum is turning good developers into average ones. Could that be true?\n\nFebruary 20, 2020\n\nRequirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering\n\nIt's now been more than 50 years since the first IFIP Conference on Software Engineering, and in that time there have been many different software engineering methodologies, processes, and models proposed to help software developers achieve that predictable and cost-effective process. But 50 years later, we still seem to see the same kinds of problems we always have: late delivery, unsatisfactory results, and complete project failures."
