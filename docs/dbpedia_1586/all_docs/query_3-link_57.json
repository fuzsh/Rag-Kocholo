        "text": "WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — A Wilmington native and Pittsburgh Steelers player made a surprise visit to an elementary school on Monday.\n\nThe Alex Highsmith Family Foundation gave away dozens of backpacks with essential supplies to the 4th and 5th grade classes of Snipes Academy in Wilmington. Highsmith himself made an appearance virtually, answering any questions students had about football and the NFL. As Highsmith and his father Sam explained, giving back to schools is a centerpiece of their foundation.\n\n“One of the reasons that we have our foundation, the Alex Highsmith Family Foundation is to give back to you guys through education because we know how important it is to have good grades and stay in school,” Alex Highsmith said.\n\n“This community helped raised him, and we as educators, me and my wife, we’re both retired but we know the importance of what schools do and we understand that all kids don’t have all the supplies. You know some do, but you know, if this is a small gift that can help a few kids, we’ve done our part,” Sam Highsmith added\n\nMonday’s visit is one of many the foundation has made to schools, but this is the first supply giveaway in Wilmington."
