        "text": "(Cross posted from The Agile Executive.)\n\nTo listen to this podcast, download the podcast directly, subscribe to the blog/podcast feed in iTunes (or whatever), or click play below to hear it:\n\nIn this episode, Israel and I talk with Jim Highsmith. We center the discusion around the new edition of Jim’s book, Agile Project Management, but this pulls in all sorts of general discussion about Agile:\n\nHow did Jim get into Agile? Going from traditional software development to Agile.\n\nHow does Rapid Development compare to Agile? Tools in RAD vs. tools in Agile.\n\nPivoting on a mention of Jim being in China, I ask him about cultural differences of applying Agile, for instance, based on geo-cultural differences.\n\nWhat’s new in the new edition that leads into larger applications of Agile? Release planning, “scaling” self-organizing teams, governance issues, and measuring.\n\nHow does Agile work in a systems, or hardware plus software situation.\n\nIsrael asks Jim for some advice on synching up software developed in an Agile fashion with hardware folks. There’s primarily more coordination and dependency management between teams and features.\n\nRelease planning – most Agile teams focus on iteration planning, without peaking up to concerns at the release level, e.g., budgeting, timing, and marketing concerns.\n\nHow can “the business” get involved with the process to make sure focus is kept on the release?\n\nWhat’s this “scaling” business? Scaling a team up in size, or scaling a team out in a distributed process.\n\nIsrael and Jim then dig into distributed scaling, adding in off-premise teams and collaboration.\n\nTracking and measuring things from a (business) strategic orientation. This hits on keeping track of value (will this software make us money?), quality and other “metrics” over time. Who is that determines this “value” ongoing? Getting people to figure out “value points.”\n\nIsrael then asks Jim for a retrospective on where we’ve been and are after the Agile Manifesto."
