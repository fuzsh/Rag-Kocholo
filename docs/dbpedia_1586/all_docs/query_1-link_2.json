He has held technical and management positions with software, computer hardware, banking, and energy companies. Jim's degrees are in Electrical Engineering and Management. He speaks at conferences worldwide, and has published dozens of articles in major industry publications. Jim is a semi-regular blogger and infrequent tweeter.\n\nMajor Publications\n\nAdaptive Leadership: Accelerating Enterprise Agility (Addison-Wesley 2013).\n\nAgile Project Management: Creating Innovative Products (Addison-Wesley 2004, 2009)\n\nAgile Software Development Ecosystems(Addison-Wesley, 2002)\n\nAdaptive Software Development: A Collaborative Approach to Managing Complex Systems(Dorset House, 2000) which won the prestigious Jolt Award\n\nCo-editor, with Alistair Cockburn, of the Agile Software Development Series of books from Addison Wesley\n\nIndustry Contributions & Affiliations\n\nCoauthor of the Agile Manifesto\n\nFounding member and on the first board of The AgileAlliance\n\nCoauthor of the Declaration Interdependence for project leaders\n\nCofounder and first president of the Agile Leadership Network\n\nAwards & Recognition"
