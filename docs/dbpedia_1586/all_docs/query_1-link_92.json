        "text": "Reviewer: Will Wallace\n\nIf you are looking for a step-by-step guide to agile software development methodologies, specifically, extreme programming (XP), then this book is not the book for you. Agile software development ecosystems (ASDEs) are not checklist oriented; they are designed to adapt to the current project?s environment. Four parts make up the book: ?Problems and Solutions,? ?Principles and People,? ?Agile Software Development Ecosystems,? and ?Developing an ASDE.? The first three parts present historical information on the agile software design movement, and major agile software design methodologies. Part 4 provides guidelines for developing your own agile methodology. Each part is summarized in the introduction. As part of the historical information, the book contains recaps of how real companies used various ASDEs to develop successful real-world projects. Many companies ended up, consciously or unconsciously, using parts of several ASDEs to develop a methodology that worked for their project and culture. Different projects within the same company usually required a different methodology, however. Also included in the book are conversations with some of the main players in the development of the various ASDEs; while interesting, they don?t really add much in the way of understanding the various ASDEs. Early in the book, Highsmith explains how agile methodologies can be accepted: ?Ultimately, if agile engineering processes are to be useful and widely applied, they must be tied to business goals that stretch the boundaries of tradition and therefore require agility, rapid response, and innovation.? Highsmith continually emphasizes that success when using an agile methodology is determined by whether the delivered software provides the user with business value. ?Our control variable is results, not plans. The real measure of success is whether or not business value was delivered to our customers, at an acceptable level of quality, within a reasonable time frame, at an acceptable cost.? The author also repeatedly emphasizes the importance of technical excellence. ?Agilists? barely sufficient approach is based on the belief that technical excellence depends mainly upon talent and skill, not methodology. Methodology forms a framework within which people can work effectively together, but it cannot, and does not, substitute for talent and skill.? A critical element recommended for any agile approach is a daily meeting as a coordination and collaboration activity. Highsmith recommends a daily scrum-type meeting. ?The daily scrum meeting enables the team to monitor status, focus on the work to be done, and raise problems and issues.? Scrum meeting characteristics include having all team members attend (developers, users, testers, and so on), and having managers attend to keep track of the project status, but not to participate. Highsmith does admit that no ASDE, or combination of ASDEs, is a silver bullet for project success. He says that ?projects of medium to high complexity have a significant possibility of failure?no matter what approach is used.? Agile methodologies, and any methodology for that matter, are used within the organization?s culture. Cultures are neither good nor bad, they just are. Highsmith explains: ?Any attempt to implement a methodology requires that an organization analyze its own fundamental culture?its core values. Many methodology failures are caused by a problem definition followed by a solution design, with little analysis of whether or not the solution design fits the company or the project team?s culture.? After years of struggling in various companies to implement one rigorous software methodology after another, this book provides an easy-to-read look at some ?light? methodologies, concerned with results, rather than complying with a plan that no longer reflects reality, even before the ink on the plan is dry. Sprinkled throughout the book are recommendations for additional reading, and well-documented sources. The book also has a good, functional index, and a very extensive bibliography. This book provides an excellent overview of agile software development ecosystems, but does not provide the reader with enough information to implement any of the ASDEs. Even though Part 4 is dedicated to helping readers develop their own methodology, the first three parts don¿t provide enough information to actually develop an agile methodology. So if readers are trying to develop their own methodologies, they should be prepared to look for other sources, with more detail on the various ASDEs. Online Computing Reviews Service"
