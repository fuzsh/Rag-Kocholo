        "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers released their first depth chart of 2024 on Tuesday. Very few spots were surprising. But there is still plenty to discuss.\n\nQuarterback\n\nMuch to the dismay of many national media outlets who are trying to invent a quarterback controversy in Pittsburgh for the sake of content, Russell Wilson is still listed as the starter in front of Justin Fields.\n\nThat’s despite Wilson failing to take a lot of the reps in camp because of a calf injury.\n\nFields has shown wonderful flashes at times. He’s also been inconsistent.\n\nThis job is Wilson’s until he proves he can’t handle it.\n\nWide receiver\n\nGeorge Pickens, Van Jefferson and Calvin Austin III are the three top receivers.\n\nUnless Brandon Aiyuk is a Steeler by the time the regular season starts, don’t expect this to change.\n\nIn other words, that’s me telling you, “I hope that it changes.”\n\nTight end\n\nPat Freiermuth is the No. 1, Darnell Washington is the No. 2 and Connor Heyward is the No. 3.\n\nSo long as Heyward is also listed as the No. 1 fullback in front of Jack Colletto (which he is), then there is nothing to see here.\n\nRunning backs\n\nSome fans wanted to see Jaylen Warren listed in front of Najee Harris. That was never going to happen.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson and La’Mical Perine the third-string and fourth-string RBs. That’s fine for now.\n\nBut Patterson is mainly a return specialist. And I’m interested to see who wins out when it comes to the third RB job between Perine and Daijun Edwards.\n\nPerine is a 26-year-old veteran with more NFL experience, but let’s see what the rookie Edwards looks like in games.\n\nMore sports\n\n• First Call: Christian McCaffrey's 'former teammate' slip about Brandon Aiyuk; former Steeler DL has new AFC home\n\n• Mark Madden: Brandon Aiyuk fills a desperate need for Steelers. Go get him\n\n• Top pick Troy Fautanu gets 1st-team reps at right tackle as Steelers build toward preseason opener\n\nOffensive line\n\nFirst-round pick Troy Fautanu is slotted as the backup at left tackle to Dan Moore Jr. instead of right tackle. That’s despite the fact that Fautanu has played more on the right side than the left side since rookie mini-camp. Dylan Cook is listed as the top replacement behind Broderick Jones on the right side.\n\nAll I know is that the Steelers have spent their last two No. 1 picks on Jones and Fautanu. They were both primarily left tackles in college. Neither of them are currently the starting left tackle.\n\nThat’s odd. Especially given that Moore Jr. is a former fourth-rounder, but not much pedigree beyond that. In his Pittsburgh career, though, he has 49 starts.\n\nThen again, 2024 second-rounder Zach Frazier is still listed as the backup center to Nate Herbig. Yet, Herbig has just 48 NFL snaps at center.\n\nSo, let’s see how long it takes for that to change before we get to the tackle conundrum.\n\nDefensive line\n\nI’ve got nothing. No surprises here.\n\nCameron Heyward, Keeanu Benton and Larry Ogunjobi are the starters. Dean Lowry and DeMarvin Leal flanking Montravius Adams in the second wave is fine. Isaiahh Loudermilk, Breiden Fehoko and Logan Lee are after that.\n\nGiven that Lowry was slowed down by an injury at the start of camp, I may slide Loudermilk in front of him. But that’s splitting hairs.\n\nOutside linebackers\n\nT.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith are the starters. Nick Herbig and Jeremiah Moon are the top backups.\n\nMarkus Golden just resigned over the weekend. Don’t be surprised if he overtakes Moon. However, defensive coordinator Teryl Austin has already said he likes what Moon could offer.\n\nInside linebackers\n\nPatrick Queen and Elandon Roberts are atop the depth chart as expected. But rookie Payton Wilson may warrant close to as many snaps as Roberts before too long.\n\nTyler Matakevich is still a valuable special teams asset, and I like Mark Robinson. I hope they both make the club. Cole Holcomb’s leg injury has him relegated to “third-line status” for now.\n\nSecondary\n\nThree starters are no brainers. Joey Porter Jr. and Donte Jackson are your cornerbacks. Minkah Fitzpatrick is an every down safety.\n\nDeShon Elliott has been very impressive in camp thus far and is listed as the other starter at safety. But he and Damontae Kazee will see the field together quite a bit.\n\nBeanie Bishop Jr. is atop the depth chart as the nickelback. He and Kazee and Elliott will all be interchangeable at times.\n\nCory Trice Jr. and Darius Rush as the second-level outside corners is what I wanted to see. Ryan Watts is intriguing as a future piece, and Anthony Averett has made a few plays once the ball was snapped here at training camp.\n\nMiles Killebrew as Fitzpatrick’s backup makes sense, given Killebrew’s special teams expertise. Cameron Sutton will find a home somewhere once he returns from suspension after Week 8."
