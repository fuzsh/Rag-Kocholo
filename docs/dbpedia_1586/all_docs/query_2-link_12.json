        "text": "Last Updated : 02 Aug, 2024\n\nImprove\n\nThe Manifesto for Agile Software Development is a foundational document produced by 17 developers at Snowbird, Utah in 2001. This document consists of 4 Agile Values and 12 Agile Principles, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction. These 12 principles and 4 agile values provide a guide to Software Developers. The Manifesto for Agile Software Development emerged as a transformative guide to Software Development.\n\nHistory of Agile Manifesto\n\nIn the late 1990s, traditional software development methodologies faced challenges with adapting to changing project requirements. A group of visionary software developers, including Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, and Alistair Cockburn gathered and collaborated in 2001, and formulated the Agile Manifesto.\n\nIt’s a document that outlines a set of guiding principles for adaptive and customer-centric software development. This manifesto was officially released on February 13, 2001. This has marked a turning point in the industry, with Agile methodologies gaining attraction globally. After 2001, practices like Scrum and Extreme Programming became popular. This extends the influence of Agile beyond software development into diverse sectors. This Agile Manifesto’s enduring legacy continues to shape how teams approach projects, fostering adaptability, collaboration, and customer focus in the dynamic landscape of technology and business.\n\nPurpose of Manifesto for Agile Software Development\n\nThe primary purpose of the Agile Manifesto is to provide a foundation for developing software in a way that responds effectively to changing requirements and delivers value to customers. It aims to shift the focus from rigid processes and extensive documentation to individuals and interactions, working software, and customer collaboration.\n\nWhat is the Agile Manifesto?\n\nThe Agile Manifesto is a set of foundational principles for agile software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It Outlines 4 core Values and 12 Principles guide agile practices.\n\n4 Core Values of the tackleAgile Manifesto\n\nIndividuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools: Focuses on the importance of effective communication and collaboration among team members.\n\nWorking Software over Comprehensive Documentation: Prioritizes the delivery of functional software as the primary measure of progress.\n\nCustomer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation: Encourages customers and stakeholders to have active involvement throughout the development process.\n\nResponding to Change over Following a Plan: On changing requirements, embracing flexibility and ability to adapt even late in the development process.\n\n12 Principles of Agile Manifesto\n\nThis Agile Manifesto is supported by 12 principles that help to implement the values.\n\nBelow are the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto:\n\nCustomer Satisfaction through Early and Continuous Delivery: This principle concentrates on the importance of customer satisfaction by providing information to customers early on time and also with consistency throughout the development process.\n\nWelcome Changing Requirements, Even Late in Development: Agile processes tackle change for the customer’s competitive advantage. Even late in development, changes in requirements are welcomed to ensure the delivered software meets the evolving requirements of the customer.\n\nDeliver Working Software Frequently: This principle encourages the regular release of functional software increments in short iterations. This enables faster feedback and adaptation to changing requirements.\n\nCollaboration between Business Stakeholders and Developers: This says the businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project. There should be communication and collaboration between stakeholders and the development team regularly. This is crucial for understanding and prioritizing requirements effectively.\n\nBuild Projects around Motivated Individuals: This promotes in giving developers the environment and support they need and trusts them to complete the job successfully. Motivated and empowered individuals are more likely to produce work with quality and make valuable contributions to the project.\n\nFace-to-face communication is the Most Effective: Face-to-face communication is the most effective method of discussion and conveying information. This principle depicts the importance of direct interaction which helps minimize misunderstandings, and hence effective communication is achieved.\n\nWorking Software is the Primary Measure of Progress: This principle emphasizes delivering functional and working software as the primary metric for project advancement. It encourages teams to prioritize the continuous delivery of valuable features, so it ensures that good progress is consistently achieved throughout the process. The primary goal is to provide customers with incremental value and also gather feedback early in the project life cycle.\n\nMaintain a Sustainable Pace of Work: Agile promotes sustainable development. All people involved: The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. This principle depicts the need for a sustainable and consistent development pace. This helps in avoiding burnout and ensures long-term project success.\n\nContinuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good design: This principle is on the importance of maintaining high standards of technical craft and design, so it ensures the long-term ability in maintenance and adaptability of the software.\n\nSimplicity—the Art of Maximizing the Amount of Work Not Done: Simplicity is essential. The objective here is to concentrate on the most valuable features and tasks and avoid unnecessary complexity as the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is crucial.\n\nSelf-Organizing Teams: Self-organizing teams provide the best architectures, requirements, and designs. These help in empowering teams to make decisions and organize to optimize efficiency and creativity.\n\nRegular Reflection on Team Effectiveness: This makes the team reflect on how to become more effective at regular intervals and then adjust accordingly. Continuous improvement is very crucial for adapting to changing circumstances and optimizing the team’s performance over time.\n\nWhy is the Agile Manifesto important?\n\nIt is a revolutionized Software Development that focuses on a more flexible and Adaptive approach rather than a rigid approach.\n\nIt enhances Team collaboration where individuals can interact openly and freely, also agile focuses on a collaborative work environment where team members can share their ideas openly, communicate with each other and work efficiently.\n\nIt helps in increasing customer satisfaction, Customers are also involved in the process which ensures the product aligns with their needs and expectations, leading to higher satisfaction and a better end product.\n\nPromote Flexibility and Adaptability, agile allows for ‘responding to change’, means allows teams to adapt to evolving requirements and market dynamics and reduces the risk of project failure.\n\nAccelerate Delivery, by focusing on working software, Agile encourages iterative development and frequent releases, enabling faster delivery of valuable features to customers.\n\nHow to use the Agile Manifesto?\n\nImplementing an Agile Manifesto is not about only adopting the principles, it is also about how an organization shifts its culture from a rigid one to a more flexible approach.\n\nHere are some steps to use the Agile Manifesto\n\nFocuses on Agile Core Values first by encouraging your team, they can internalize and prioritize the four core values in their daily work.\n\nAdopt Agile Frameworks Implement Agile frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming that align with your team’s needs and project requirements.\n\nFoster Open Communication, and, encourage regular communication among team members and stakeholders freely, allowing them to share their ideas by creating an environment where team members feel comfortable.\n\nIterate and Improve, according to change in response, continuously assess your process, and as per the feedback from the user make changes and adjustments. Agile is about continuous improvement and learning.\n\nEngage with Customers Maintain ongoing collaboration with customers to gather feedback and ensure the product aligns with their needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Agile Manifesto for Software Development has enhanced the approach for project management in the software industry. Agile methodologies have become a guide for teams to succeed the complexities of modern software development by prioritizing individuals, collaboration, and responsiveness to change.\n\nFAQ’s\n\nWhat is the Agile Manifesto for Software Development?\n\nThe Agile Manifesto is a documentation that identifies four key values and 12 principles that its authors believe Software Developers should use to guide their work. Manifesto for Agile Software Development was produced by 17 developers during an outing on Feb.\n\nWhat are the 4 statements of the Agile Manifesto?\n\nThe Agile Manifesto consists of four key values: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.\n\nWhat is principle 5 of the Agile Manifesto?\n\nHere’s what the Agile Principle 5 says: “Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”\n\nWhich statement is a part of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development?\n\nThe Manifesto for Agile Software Development states: “We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.\n\nPlease Login to comment..."
