        "text": "‚òù HURRAH for the AI Hype üòä. AI Bubble, AI Winder, AI OverHyped‚Äîthese are GOOD things!! Think back to the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and 2000s‚Äîhype, hype, hype. But, by 2007 the internet was changing everything‚Äîsocial media, smartphones, big-data, cloud, Uber, Amazon (started in the 90s),etc. The image below shows the time-compression of the Hype Curve (attributed to Gartner) and the Technology Adoption Curve (Geoffrey Moore‚Äôs chasm version). If the blossoming of the internet took 5-7 years (yes, I do realize that the internet was created in 1787), maybe the blossoming of AI will take 2-3 years. But it will come, there is just too much momentum, investment and promise behind AI. We will still have a hype cycle, it will just rotate faster than before. There was a lot of money lost during the dotcom era, an era in which dozens of tiny companies were acquired for astronomical sums, where companies wondered whether to embrace the web or ignore it. Some jumped in too soon with unfounded investments, some jumped in too late as newcomers devastated their markets. AI will have similar outcomes. In the 1980s we used mainframe computers to ‚Äúpave the cow paths‚Äù (a long ago used term that meant automating existing business processes as they existed, rather than re-designing processes based on newfangled computer/database capabilities). AI will follow a similar path, we will pave existing cow paths while we learn how to use AI to build entirely new enterprise business models. So what the hype cycle does for us is gives us a bit more time, a bit more. Use it wisely!! For an in-depth look at AI hype, see \"Is AI Overhyped? 5 Leaders Weigh In\" https://lnkd.in/dzmXi_6P. Pete Behrens, Charles Fleet, Christopher Morales, EMBA, ICP-LEA, Frederic Miskawi, Leonard Greski, Allison Cooper The image shows how the time cycle for these curves is are getting squeezed.\n\nAgile organizations need practices, not processes! Long ago and far away I worked with a U.S. based financial software product company that had significant sales in Europe. At that time customer requirements included the software meet ISO certification. The company jumped through all the hoops to become certified, which included documenting processes, gate reviews, sign-offs, etc. They quickly learned that following their own newly minted ISO processes and documentation standards slowed development work considerably, so the development staff of course created ‚Äúwork around‚Äù practices. Auditors would write up deficiency reports, which took time to respond to. The auditors would say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that‚Äù and the company staff would say ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt do that again,‚Äù which of course they did as soon as the auditors left. The company could have updated their processes to correspond to actual practices, but that required a certification update that they didn‚Äôt want to go through because of the time involved. As time went on, the divide between process and practice increased and staff continued to ride the merry-go-round of process and practice, which nobody‚Äîfrom programmers to managers‚Äîliked. This story points out the basic differences between processes and practices: *There is always a discrepancy between process standards and practical practices. * The larger the discrepancy, the more time gets wasted. * The larger the discrepancy, the larger the negative impact on staff morale. * The larger the discrepancy, the more tension arises between management and development staff. Don't assume I am against regulatory compliance. Regulations serve a useful purpose (until they get out of hand, which they usually do, but hey, that's another post). However, my observation is that over time regulated organizations become risk averse and compliance becomes the desired outcome, not customer value. From a betting regulator in Australia to a biotech company in Canada, I found that a statement like \"Compliance requirements keeps us from doing XYZ,\" is often a lame excuse, not a reason. At a medical software company the development staff had interpreted an FDA compliance \"You must show a match of all requirements to code\" to mean they had to use a waterfall process. When I pointed out that they could easily meet the requirement during iterative development and at the project end, they realized the requirement was not a barrier to iterative development after all. There's usually a way to design a process/practice blend that satisfies both customer and compliance requirements, it just takes some old-fashion ingenuity. ------ Milestone!!!
