        "text": "What is the Agile Manifesto?\n\nKnown officially as âThe Manifesto for Agile Software Developmentâ, the manifesto detailing 4 Values and 12 Principles.Â\n\nActing as a proclamation, it is designed to improve software development methodologies, and directly responds to the inefficiency of traditional development processes. Namely, their reliance on weighty documentation and opportunity for oversight.Â\n\nWhile the original document specifically set out to help software developers build business solutions in a faster and more efficient way, it has had a huge impact on the wider development industry and beyond.\n\nToday, groups as diverse as PR and marketing departments, coders, restaurateurs, and even The Boy Scouts of America use the manifesto in one way or another, and its influence only continues to expand.\n\nSo, what are the core values and principles of the Agile Manifesto?\n\nLetâs break it down...\n\nThe 4 agile values\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation.\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation.\n\nResponding to change over following a plan.\n\nThe 12 agile principles:\n\nThe highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early, and continuous, delivery of valuable software.\n\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.\n\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.\n\nClients and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to, and within a development team, is face-to-face conversation.\n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\n\nAgile processes promote sustainable development â the sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n\nSimplicity â the art of maximizing the amount of work not done â is essential.\n\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\nHistory of the Agile Manifesto\n\nAlthough various agile principles have been around since the 1970s, the manifesto itself â and the full definition of the agile philosophy â was created at the dawn of the new millennium.Â\n\nIn early 2001, a group of 17 developers held two meetings â the first in Oregon, the second in Snowbird, Utah â to discuss issues and solutions in software development, which is how the manifesto was firstborn.Â\n\nPut simply, the manifesto was written as a response to major frustration with the traditional development processes of the 1990s.Â\n\nThe explosion of personal computing meant that product and software development had undergone significant changes, and developers at the meetings â and indeed, across the wider industry â felt that the status quo was no longer working.Â\n\nThe lag time between business needs and solutions being developed was an average of three years, and the standard processes at this point were unwieldy, unsatisfactory, and overburdened with documentation and oversight.Â\n\nThe 17 developers who met in Oregon and Utah named themselves âThe Agile Allianceâ, and proposed a new way of working based around a set of values and principles that would ârestore credibility to the word âmethodologyââ.\n\nThe manifesto was designed to empower developers, speed up processes, and help encourage working practices that focus more directly on the user.\n\nThe values and principles allow teams to be adaptive, to respond quickly and effectively to change, and to be in a state of constant reimagination underpinned by frequent customer feedback.Â\n\nPublished in February 2001, the manifesto has since formed the basis of a vast array of frameworks, methodologies, and different ways of working.\n\nWho is the Agile Alliance?\n\nThe original signatories to the Agile Manifesto were a group of 17 developers, scientists, programmers, and authors who came together to find a solution to the perceived ills of the software development industry.\n\nAgile philosophy pre-dated the Agile Manifesto, and the group included a number of inventors and creators of earlier agile frameworks. Kent Back of extreme programming, Jim Highsmith of adaptive software development, and Jeff Sutherland of Scrum, to name a few.Â\n\nThe full list of signatories is:\n\nKent Beck, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, James Grenning, Jim Highsmith, Andrew Hunt, Ron Jeffries, Jon Kern, Brian Marick, Robert C. Martin, Steve Mellor, Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, and Dave Thomas.\n\nIs the Agile Manifesto still relevant today?\n\nThe beauty of the Agile Manifesto is that despite changes the industry has seen, despite the passage of time, and despite the fact that it has been applied to sectors and organizations far and beyond its original scope â the manifestoâs flexibility and adaptive nature mean that it continues to be relevant today.Â\n\nAgile is a mentality â a philosophy â and the manifesto sets out principles and values, rather than prescribing certain processes. This means that plenty of developers work with an agile mindset without even realizing it. The manifesto merely formalizes how many successful teams have always worked.Â\n\nThe real problem with the manifesto today is not whether it is relevant, but how it is applied â or rather how it is applied incorrectly.Â\n\nIn part due to its flexibility, one of the biggest problems with agile is that some teams describe themselves as such without properly applying or understanding the underlying principles.Â\n\nPlenty of âagileâ teams, for example, sometimes use the manifesto as an âexcuseâ to abandon traditional development processes and to reject rigor, without ever really considering the fundamentals behind an agile mindset.Â\n\nWhen used correctly, though, the manifesto remains as relevant today as it did when it was written, and can be a hugely valuable tool for developers, teams, and even entire organizations.\n\nAfter more than 20 years...has the agile manifesto achieved its vision?\n\nFebruary 2021 marked the 20th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto. The world has changed dramatically since its introduction both in terms of society and the way we work. Despite this, the Agile Manifesto still holds up. While the concept isnât new anymore, it still guides many of our practices and strategies. But has it achieved the vision like its creators hoped? Yes and no.\n\nSome feel that we are far from achieving the vision laid out by the original Agile Manifesto.\n\nThis is especially true for enterprise-level businesses, which, as described by Brian Dawson, DevOps evangelist with CloudBees, is like a âtankerâ being turned slowly and incrementally.Â\n\nUnfortunately, many companies still treat âagileâ as a buzzword. They will introduce agile to the office and expect everyone to jump on board but then do little to implement and maintain agile practices.\n\nThey try to make agile work around their existing processes rather than building new processes around agile principles. They see it as a medicine to heal the companyâs problems when theyâre just applying a bandaid and hoping for the best.\n\nEnterprise-level businesses will also see agile as purely related to product development. They will only roll out Agile to those specific departments and hope it results in higher quality products and increased output. But, as those familiar with Agile already know, the Agile principles need to be embraced at an organizational level to benefit from its true value.Â\n\nThereâs a tendency to pigeonhole agile into rigid processes. Some see Agile as a simple process that you can immediately do and start calling the business Agile.\n\nThis leads to processes created for the sake of having processes which only serve to disconnect businesses and their workers. By viewing Agile as a rigid process, you lose almost all of the benefits of working with Agile.\n\nYet, at the same time, thereâs a tendency to stray too far away from rigidity. Some see Agile as a free-for-all methodology that lets teams aimlessly go with the flow. While this can occasionally produce great results, fooling businesses into thinking their version of Agile is working, it simply leads to a lack of discipline within your teams. An Agile coach may seem like an unnecessary cost, but having one is essential to keep your team working hard while still embracing Agile practices.\n\nThankfully, start-ups are much better at adopting the values of the Agile Manifesto. Since they donât already have established processes baked into the company culture, they can build their practices around the agile principles so that they are front and center during everything they do.\n\nThis is great news for agile fans, because todayâs start-ups will grow to be tomorrow's enterprises.Â\n\nSo while weâre not quite there yet, weâre certainly on our way to achieving the vision of the Agile Manifesto."
