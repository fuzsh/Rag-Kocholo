        "text": "As with other agile methods, ASD is used to make teams more adaptable to changing customer demand, requirements and market needs. Specifically, ASD does this by promoting lightweight planning and ongoing learning, through a three-phase process: speculate, collaborate, and learn.Â\n\nThe definition given by ASDâs creators, Jim Highsmith and Sam Bayer, is that ASD âembodies the principle that continuous adaptation of the process to the work at hand is the normal state of affairs.â\n\nPut simply: that change is to be expected, and welcomed, within the development process.\n\nHistory of adaptive software development\n\nAdaptive software development grew out of the work by Jim Highsmith and Sam Bayer, two project managers, on RAD in the early 1990s. ASD was designed to replace the traditional waterfall cycle with a three-element repeating series of âspeculateâ, âcollaborateâ, and âlearnâ.Â\n\nItâs important to note that ASDâs three phases are nonlinear and, as such, they will overlap:\n\nYou cannot collaborate without learning, or learn without collaborating.\n\nYou cannot speculate without learning, or learn without speculating.\n\nYou cannot speculate without collaborating, or collaborate without speculating.\n\nSo if you feel like youâre performing all three phases of ASD at the same time, you probably are!Â\n\nThese three phases reflect the dynamic and fluid nature of ASD, which was designed to go beyond a mere change in the project lifecycle to a deeper change in management style.\n\nHighsmith and Bayer used this new project management approach to complete more than 100 real-world commercial software projects that were deployed across several industries.Â\n\nThe duo wrote about their new approach Highsmithâs 2000 book, Adaptive Software Development.\n\nAdvantages of adaptive software developmentÂ\n\nThere are several benefits to the ASD approach. These include:\n\nA better and stronger overall end product.\n\nIncreased transparency between developers and customers.\n\nA user-first approach which leads to a more intuitive piece of software.\n\nHigher likelihood of on-time (or early!) delivery, thanks to the repeating three-step process which allows potential problems to be identified and solved early.\n\nDisadvantages of adaptive software development drawbacks\n\nHowever, no agile framework is perfect! With ASD, there are a few drawbacks that need to be weighed against the benefits:\n\nExtensive testing can lead to higher project costs.\n\nThe level of user involvement required can be difficult to resource.\n\nAn emphasis on constant product iteration and feedback can lead to burnout.\n\nLastly, ASD works better where teams can be dedicated solely to a single project.\n\nIs adaptive software development right for your team?\n\nBy its nature, adaptive software development works best when an organization is able to suitably prioritize the rapid delivery of products.Â\n\nBoutique software houses where small teams work on single projects, for example, may find ASD fits nicely with their workflow. Whereas larger multi-service firms, where teams work on multiple projects at once, may find it harder to implement.\n\nThat being said, any company that can draw value from the continuous iteration and evolution of product offerings could consider ASD as a working method."
