        "text": "Podcasting with Jim Highsmith, co-author of Agile Manifesto, is an honor.\n\nJim is more than a legend to me, he’s a great person. Can you imagine that he helped me with my book without even knowing me? That’s what happened.\n\nSome time ago I wrote something quite provocative, “Agile Manifesto Is Long Gone! We Need a Product Manifesto!” Jim dropped me a message and we chatted about it.\n\nAfter some time, I decided to write a book. Then, I asked Jim to have a look at it. He shared his honest feedback, which helped me improve the structure, content, and flow. After that he gave me a generous foreword. I’m humbled.\n\nYou can learn more about my book, launched two months ago. The feedback has been awesome. Get the book if you’re up for defeating bullshit management.\n\nComing back to the podcast. It’s a 55 minutes of insights, history, and personal stories. In case you’re not up for that, here are 5 key takeaways directly from this talk:\n\n1. Embrace Change\n\nThe future is uncertain. Nobody knows what and how will change for businesses and roles within the fast-paced advancement of AI and Biotech.\n\nBeing adaptable is crucial for future success.\n\n2. Values First\n\nIf you want a new way of working, start with the values, then you can work out a process from that, not the other way around.\n\nThe agile movement's core strength lies in its values and principles, not methodologies. Stick to the basics for meaningful progress.\n\n3. Communication is a Core Skill\n\nEffective communication is what opens your doors and helps you grow.\n\nCommunication tops the list of desired skills, even above technical capabilities.\n\n4. Leadership Evolution\n\nFuture leaders must create environments that foster innovation and autonomy. The way forward is to manage through intent rather than control.\n\n5. Lifelong Learning\n\nContinuous learning and adapting are vital. Do what boosts your energy, and don't be afraid of reinventing yourself, be afraid of becoming outdated.\n\nLet's rock the product world together!\n\nHere are a few ways I can help you even more:\n\nGet my Book, Untrapping Product Teams\n\nUpgrade your subscription to Premium and get one deeply thought newsletter per month (20+ minutes reading) plus access to 300+ episodes\n\nLearn How to Craft a Product Strategy that Works\n\nDevelop the Necessary Skills to Beat Bullshit Management\n\nJoin my cohort, Product Discovery Done Right\n\nHave a lovely day"
