        "text": "May 5, 2010\n\nThis book covers a great deal of material: Martin talks about the basic practices of agile software development, the principles of good object-oriented design, and common OO design patterns.\n\nThis book is, in my opinion, a career-changer. Having a single book that teaches what it essentially means to move from being a programmer to a real software craftsman is invaluable. I'd recommend this for any experienced programmer who wants to transition to a more professional approach to writing high quality, maintainable code.\n\nIn this book, Martin avoids a problem that plagued Clean Code - most of the code examples here are short, making it less problematic that they lack any kind of formatting to aid readability. My main problem with the book was that I personally don't think C++ code ever \"looks\" good, so examples that illustrated how to clean C++ code weren't as impactful for me as the Java examples. I think I would have preferred the C-based code to be in C# instead.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent book that really helped me grow into a software craftsman. Occasionally, some of the code examples drag on a bit long, and occasionally the examples look overengineered (a common problem when using code short enough to illustrate a single thing), but the book is so good otherwise that it's worth slogging through the occasional rough patches.\n\nFebruary 11, 2017\n\nA must-read for developers willing to build maintainable, testable and scalable software. It teaches you the basics for agile \"software development\", TDD, SOLID principles, design patterns and much more. Also, you really need to try out the patterns and practices presented in this book so you can feel how it is to create a \"Clean Architecture\". On the other hand, the reader might need some programming experience before trying to understand all the reasons and solutions proposed in this book.\n\nJanuary 4, 2013\n\nThis book alternates between incredibly useful and frustratingly complex. Its explanations of the practical use of software design patterns as well as various principles of object-oriented design are so clear and pragmatic that I can safely say this book has shaped my programming practices. For that, I want to give it 5 stars. Then suddenly comes one of these monster case studies in which he describes in painful detail some programming problem in the most convoluted way possible, including UML diagrams that look like a jigsaw puzzle and pages of code that are both unnecessary and unhelpful. For that, I want to give it 1 star. I'm left with no choice but to settle for an average of 3 stars. My advice: Read the chapters about design patterns and object-oriented principles, and skip the mind-numbing case studies.\n\nJuly 12, 2019\n\nI've read it for 1.5 years. 🙄 Just because I've overestimated its complexity.\n\nThe book actually consists of SOLID principles, bunch of GoF patterns with fancy modifications, and a chapter on packaging. There are a lot of case studies here.\n\nThe style is very good, while sometimes too verbose. I liked that some decisions are explained so many times that I've understood 😀.\n\nSo, having a paperback copy of a classic book is a good idea.\n\nNovember 20, 2019\n\nبلاخره تموم شد! یک انتخاب نادرست برای این زمان! یک کتاب سخت خوان و انگیزه کم کن، حداقل برای کسی مثل من که هنوز در ابتدای راه دیزاین هست. اصلا توصیه نمی کنم اگر هنوز به درک نسبتا خوبی از مفاهیم پایه نرسیدید این کتاب رو بخونید. چون به نظرم سخت نوشته شده و خسته و گیجتون می کنه. بعدها، شاید وقتی مفاهیم برام بیشتر جا افتاد، به عنوان یک کتاب که از تجارب واقعی نوشته شده، باز این کتاب رو بخونم.\n\nAugust 19, 2016\n\nThis book is a great overview of patterns & workflows for writing code in an agile process. There isn't a lot of new information in the book, as most of it can be found in more detail elsewhere, but if you're looking for a consolidated overview or refresher, I highly recommend it. It's also great for the case studies, which are well-written examples of how to do some of this stuff in real-world scenarios.\n\nJanuary 25, 2012\n\nA lot of this was really good. Some of it was just over my head. I may have to revisit this book sometime in the future when I'm smarter.\n\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\nThe first chapters of the book explain a little bit about Agile and its methodologies, practices, and background. The subsequences are all about reviews of refactoring, design patterns, testing, and related stuff. Also, there are some study cases at the end of each topic.\n\nEven though this book is not a breakthrough--there isn't something new--but the depth of the reviews makes the book worth reading. You'll recall many topics like Refactoring, XP, TTD, etc etc. You'll learn it more deeply because the author gives different perspectives on how to use certain techniques.\n\nWhat bothers me a lot about this book is the author's word selection. Bob is a Sesquipedalian: he likes using big words. Some selections cause the book to be unreadable.\n\nAlso, some explanations are just too shallow. Sometimes, the author likes to assume that the readers have an understanding of the prerequisites, so he didn't give so much time explaining it or explaining it in a vague way. This is frustrating. I had to skip two case studies because of their lack of explanations. I'd tried it hard, seriously, but I don't think I would ever understand with that level of unclarity.\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\nUsed this book to brush up on the SOLID principles and they are indeed explained in much detail and depth. However, the approach to explaining these principles primarily focuses on the \"HOW\" aspect, with only a minimal emphasis on the \"why.\" It could be a matter of personal preference, but I find it more effective when the rationale behind these principles is thoroughly explained before delving into the details of how to implement them. Nonetheless, thanks to the guidance from this book, I was able to conduct some additional research independently for a better understanding of the topic. Hence, if you are embarking on a journey of software design, this book could prove to be a valuable companion.\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\nAgile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices\" is a comprehensive guide for mastering agile methodologies. It emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability. For those looking to apply agile principles in mobile apps development, consider exploring the features discussed in this insightful blog post. It provides valuable insights on creating a robust and user-friendly travel mobile app aligned with agile principles, enhancing the development process.\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nAgile software development has become a cornerstone in modern software engineering, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. If you're interested in learning more about Agile principles, patterns, and practices, I recommend checking out the comprehensive guide available at Springs. Software Development Services for Startups It covers essential aspects of Agile development and offers valuable insights for both beginners and experienced practitioners. Happy reading!\n\nJuly 17, 2024\n\nI recently ordered the end-to-end development service for my project. I was looking for a company that could take over the entire development process, from concept to final product. It was important to find a team with experience and good reviews. I chose a company that offered a full range of services: design, development, testing and support. Development took place in several stages, with regular updates and testing. As a result, I received a quality product that fully met my expectations.\n\nMarch 23, 2024\n\nLong thought and ordered desktop software development for my project covering the most popular platforms. The development team displayed outstanding skills and professionalism, creating a bug-free application that is simply impressive in its functionality and aesthetics. The results exceeded my expectations and my idea is now a reality thanks to their talent and efforts. I can't wait to share this with my users.\n\nDecember 20, 2017\n\nI've read up this book up to the Packaging the Payroll System, right before starting the ETS Study Case. The reason for this abandon is that this book is very large (at least for me, a novice in reading technical books).\n\nIt is a great book for learning Design Patterns. Also, it is a nice read as the author has a good sense of humor, and inserts funny stuff here and there.\n\nFebruary 17, 2019\n\nIt’s a bit dated but the book provides a lot of useful information on making software projects successful. It’s the kind of book I wish I read a long time ago at the beginning of my career. Still, it’s valuable to revisit these concepts once in a while.\n\nI would categorize this book as recommended reading for budding software engineers.\n\nSeptember 28, 2022\n\nAs there is now a lot of literature that is useful, but to find something you need that you can use later, in practice. I read this book and gladly recommended it to my friend who is a programmer working for the IT company SCAND I always mark such literature and keep it and advise everyone.\n\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\nVery good book, my friend who works at a custom software development company recommended this book to me. The book covers all of the basics that you need to know as a beginner that are typically overlooked in other books for beginners. All of this information is presented in an easy-to-understand format with lots of examples along the way.\n\nApril 8, 2023\n\nI was always looking for a trusted solution in order how to develop my own business in a proper way. After a long search of a proper solution I faced with https://chisw.com/ that is a special modern software development firm that is helping with finding the best way about how to improve my own company.\n\nRead\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nThis book is a useful resource for programmers who want to blend Agile development with good software engineering practices. It covers the core ideas of Agile and object-oriented design. Just remember, since it was published in 2002, some of the specific practices might be a bit different these days.\n\nMalaika from https://www.sqlops.com/\n\nApril 10, 2018\n\nExcelent book. Every developer must read this book, at least, once in your professional life. It hasn't just talking about design patterns, but how to get there and when and if makes sense. Give you a critical vision about design patterns, refactoring, TDD and process development.\n\nAugust 8, 2018\n\nNice explanation of SOLID principles. Some of the stuff is outdated but conveys the message good enough\n\nSeptember 4, 2020\n\nThe first few chapters until SOLID and design patterns are more relevant to Agile.\n\nSeptember 5, 2020\n\nClench your teeth or you will not finish this magnificent piece of art. It's packed with C++ and Java snippets, UMLs, case studies, etc. It's more like having a job than reading a book.\n\nDecember 12, 2020\n\nIt was big changer in my career. It teached me how to be a developer. Not just a coder."
