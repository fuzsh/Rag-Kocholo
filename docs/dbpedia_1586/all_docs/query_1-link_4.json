        "text": "The Agile Manifesto is a brief document built on 4 values and 12 principles for agile software development. The Agile Manifesto was published in February 2001 and is the work of 17 software development practitioners who observed the increasing need for an alternative to documentation-driven and heavyweight software development processes.\n\nWhat Is the History of the Agile Manifesto?\n\nIn February 2001, 17 software development practitioners gathered at a ski resort in Utah. Of course, they were there to ski, relax, and eat and drink. But most importantly, they were there to lament, pontificate, and solve problems.\n\nDespite having widely varying opinions on the right way to approach software development, the crew agreed on at least one thing: the status quo was not working. There was an increasing need for an alternative to documentation-driven and heavyweight software development processes.\n\nThe group named themselves “The Agile Alliance.” Out of their gathering in Utah that winter came The Agile Manifesto, a brief document built on 4 values and 12 principles for agile software development.\n\nIt’s important to note that agile in itself wasn’t born then. Before this, its creators and many other software development practitioners had long been applying various agile values and principles piecemeal. But The Agile Manifesto made concrete the ideas that had been permeating the software development world for the last decade or so.\n\nWho Created the Agile Manifesto?\n\nAs stated above, software practitioners from various backgrounds gathered to form the Agile Alliance who created The Agile Manifesto. But who exactly were they? Here’s who signed the original Agile Manifesto back in 2001:\n\nKent Beck, who co-created eXtreme Programming (XP)\n\nMike Beedle, co-author of Agile Software Development with Scrum\n\nArie van Bennekum, owner of Integrated Agile\n\nAlistair Cockburn, IT strategist and creator of the Crystal Agile Methodology\n\nWard Cunningham, inventor of wiki and first to coin term technical debt\n\nMartin Fowler, software practitioner, and partner at Thoughtworks\n\nJames Grenning, author of Test-Driven Development\n\nJim Highsmith, creator of Adaptive Software Development (ASD)\n\nAndrew Hunt, co-author of The Pragmatic Programmer\n\nRon Jeffries, co-creator of eXtreme Programming (XP)\n\nJon Kern, who still helps organizations with agile today\n\nBrian Marick, a computer scientist and author of several books on programming\n\nRobert C. Martin, also known as “Uncle Bob,” who consults via Clean Coding\n\nSteve Mellor, a computer scientist also credited with inventing Object-Oriented System Analysis (OOSA)\n\nKen Schwaber, who co-created Scrum with Jeff Sutherland\n\nJeff Sutherland, the inventor, and co-creator of Scrum\n\nDave Thomas, programmer, and co-author of The Pragmatic Programmer\n\nWhat Does The Agile Manifesto Say?\n\nThe Agile Manifesto outlines a set of 4 values and 12 principles for agile software development.\n\nThe 4 Agile Values\n\nThe agile mentality has 4 overarching values differentiating it from traditional software development processes.\n\nFor more information about the 4 values of agile software development, read our overview of the 4 agile values.\n\nThe 12 Agile Principles\n\nIn addition to its 4 values, The Agile Manifesto also outlines 12 principles for agile development practices. These 12 principles emphasize things like “early and continuous delivery of valuable software” and “continuous attention to technical excellence.” Ready for more? Read our full overview of the 12 agile principles.\n\nAgile Is a Mentality\n\nWhile the 12 agile principles and 4 values for agile provide useful guidance for those hoping to practice agile software development, they are not prescriptive."
