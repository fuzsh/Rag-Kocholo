        "text": "Agile Software Development is a set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.\n\nPrinciples\n\nThe Agile Manifesto, which was created by a group of software developers in 2001, outlines the key principles of Agile Software Development:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools: Agile methodologies place a premium on effective communication and collaboration.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation: Agile developers focus on delivering working software as quickly as possible and then improving it over multiple iterations.\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation: Agile development involves the customer in the development process to ensure the product meets their needs.\n\nResponding to change over following a plan: Agile development is all about being able to respond to changes in the business environment or technology landscape.\n\nPractices\n\nAgile Software Development is not a methodology in itself, but it encompasses various methodologies and practices, including:\n\nScrum: This is a framework that involves a set of practices for managing and incrementing a productâ€™s development in a flexible and holistic manner. It's based on a sprint-based project timeline.\n\nKanban: This is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. It visualizes both the process and the actual work passing through that process.\n\nExtreme Programming (XP): This methodology emphasizes customer satisfaction and promotes the delivery of high-quality software quickly and continuously.\n\nBenefits\n\nAgile Software Development offers several benefits:"
