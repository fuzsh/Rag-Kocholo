        "text": "Agile software development values\n\nBased on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value:\n\n- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\n- Working software over comprehensive documentation\n\n- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\nThat is to say, the items on the left are valued more than the items on the right. It is not to say that the items on the right should be excluded in favor of the items on the left. Both sides have value, but from an Agile Development point of view the authors of the manifesto tip the balance in favor of the items on the left.\n\nAs Scott Ambler elucidated:\n\nTools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.\n\nGood documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.\n\nA contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.\n\nA project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders' priorities, and people's understanding of the problem and its solution.\n\nSome of the authors formed the Agile Alliance, a non-profit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto's values and principles. Introducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance, Jim Highsmith said,\n\nThe Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as \"hackers\" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.\n\nâ€” Jim Highsmith, History: The Agile Manifesto\n\nAgile software development principles"
