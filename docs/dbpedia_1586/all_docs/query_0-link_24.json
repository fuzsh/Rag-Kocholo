In this book he looks back at more than fifty years in software, reflecting on the evolution of the discipline from the “wild west” of the late 1960s to the age of Agile in the twenty-first century\n\nAs we grapple with questions about the future of software development, Jim Highsmith’s compelling stories and reflections provide us with an essential insight into how to navigate change and remain adaptive and inventive in an industry that continues to shape the way the world lives and works."
