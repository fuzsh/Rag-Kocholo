        "text": "The Agile Manifesto, also known as the Manifesto for Agile software development, was created by 17 software developers in 2001 while on an outing in Utah, US. They aimed to develop an alternate development process to the existing software development process, which they considered complicated and focused too much on documentation.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto contains 12 principles and 4 core values that guide software developers in their work. The Agile Manifesto declares, \"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to do it.\" Here, we will describe the 12 principles and 4 values of the Agile manifesto embedded in the present way of developing software. Let us have a look at the 4 Agile values first.\n\nImportance of Agile Manifesto:\n\nThe Agile Manifesto, a foundational software development and project management document, embodies principles that prioritize collaboration, flexibility, and customer-centricity. Its importance transcends its origins in software development, making it relevant to various industries.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Agile Manifesto champions customer satisfaction by continuously delivering valuable products or services. Agile methodology prioritizes customer needs and feedback, ensuring adaptability and alignment with evolving requirements.\n\nAgile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, enhance teamwork and communication. Frequent meetings and iterative development cycles foster collaboration among cross-functional teams, breaking down silos and improving productivity. Moreover, Agile encourages the embrace of change. Its iterative approach allows for adjustments throughout a project's lifecycle, reducing the risk of costly late-stage modifications.\n\nThe 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto are:\n\n1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery:\n\nIn traditional methodologies, the product is given to the customer after it has been fully developed and many tests and checks have been carried out. So, the customer is kept guessing about the product, and the team finds it difficult to make any changes at that stage. But the first principle of Agile says, \"highest priority is to be given to customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of software.\" But it can be applied outside the software industry also.\n\nThe customer is given an early and continuous delivery, which keeps the customer in the loop throughout the development process. This means the team finds making changes possible and accessible at any point. This also keeps customers happy as they are regularly delivered value. Moreover, they can provide feedback to the team so they do not have to make significant changes later.\n\n2. Welcome changes in requirements all through the process:\n\nThis is the second of the 12 Agile principles. To welcome changes at any stage of the process. The customer's requirements may change or ask for new features anytime during development. It should be embraced rather than moving ahead despite these requests for changes. The point is that you should be prepared to accept uncertainty and that such changes at any stage can bring the customer more value.\n\nThe earlier methods of development were not flexible enough to embrace change. They were carried out according to a fixed plan and would keep moving despite change requests. However, this Agile principle emphasizes changing customer needs and making course corrections wherever necessary. Product development teams constantly monitor the market and value customer feedback. So, the teams are helped by Agile's iterative process in responding to changes quickly and timely.\n\n3. The value should be delivered frequently:\n\nAs per Agile principles, teams should embrace changes at any stage and avoid strict schedules. The original wording of this principle states, \"Deliver the working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for a shorter timescale.\"\n\nThis indicates that the customer should receive value at shorter intervals instead of waiting for the entire product to be completed. Following this principle ensures less time is spent on documentation and more on product development, accelerating the process. The frequent, small releases also help in getting the product validated by qualified stakeholders. To achieve this, there should be agreement within the team and with other stakeholders on Agile release planning, which sets the frequency of product releases.\n\n4. All developers and other stakeholders must work together all through the process:\n\nTraditional methodologies often isolate stakeholders from the development team, leaving them in the dark about the project's progress until the end. However, Agile methodology emphasizes constant communication between business people and developers, as both parties play a crucial role in the project's success. This collaboration must occur daily, enabling regular feedback that adds value to the final product. A more valuable product can be created by combining technical and business expertise. This is possible only when both sides work together closely, exchanging ideas and feedback and communicating regularly. Therefore, everyone must speak the same language to ensure the product's success.\n\n5. Build projects around motivated individuals:\n\nTrust your best product team by empowering them to work autonomously. Avoid micro-management as it may demotivate the team. Provide the necessary environment and support, monitor their work, and step in when necessary. Encourage them to share ideas and opinions. Centralized decision-making hinders progress and may prevent the delivery of desired value to the customer. Stay out of their regular working routine and ensure your team remains motivated.\n\n6. Encourage face-to-face conversations:\n\nThe sixth of the Agile Manifesto principles states, \"The most effective and efficient way of conveying information is through face-to-face conversations.\" Not only is it the most efficient and effective, but it is also the quickest way of asking questions and getting answers. Communicating through emails, documents, or some software may be good, but it involves time. But when there is an urgent need to move quickly, you can't just sit back and wait for a reply. So, a face-to-face conversation must be carried out to clear the matters. The purpose is to let the product team and the developers communicate in real time about the product, requirements, ideas, and strategies. This becomes all the more important in today's working environment, where so many remote teams are at work. A video conferencing call is a great tool for getting quick responses. Agile principles emphasize face-to-face conversations for better collaboration within the teams and between the teams.\n\n7. Working software is the primary measure of progress:\n\nNo matter how much time and effort you and your team have put into developing your software or any other product, the ultimate measure of progress is the final product's functionality. Success is determined by how satisfied your customers are with your product. It is not about how many tasks you have completed but how effectively the final product works. The Agile philosophy emphasizes the importance of developing software and dedicating time rather than getting bogged down in documentation. Therefore, working software is the ultimate measure of progress for any team. Remain focused on the success of your product and the satisfaction of your customers, and you will achieve success.\n\n8. Agile processes encourage sustainable development:\n\nThis is the eighth principle of the Agile Manifesto. The important thing here is that teams should maintain a constant pace of work. The short sprints in the Agile methodology help embrace change quickly and inspire the teams throughout the process. The aim should be not to quickly lead the team to burnout and compromise the quality of work. So, the work pattern should be such that it encourages sustainable development. The team should be able to carry out work for a longer time at a constant pace. Ensure that your team does not get overwhelmed and that work progresses smoothly. Put the right team that believes in working hard but does not overstretch itself.\n\n9. Pay continuous attention to technical excellence that will enhance Agility:\n\nAlthough the Agile methodology works in small cycles and promotes frequent releases, it also stresses the importance of keeping the process clean and orderly to avoid future problems. You must ensure that whatever work you are doing improves after each iteration. This means you don't have to create only a working product but a high-quality one. Maintaining operational excellence will help you accept the changes more efficiently, which, in turn, will help keep Agility. The final goal of every Agile team is to deliver value to the customer. And maintaining excellence at all times is the way to do it.\n\n10. Maintaining simplicity is vital:\n\nIn Agile, simplicity is the art of maximizing the amount of work not being done. In simpler terms, you don't want unnecessary complications when trying to move through a project quickly. Try to keep it simple. This Agile principle emphasizes the need to do the most impactful things. You will not get paid for the time or effort you spend on a product. Customers are going to pay you for the ultimate outcome. So, cut out the complexities and do what is essential. Focus on the solution asked for by the customer. This is an excellent way of streamlining your process. Make use of the Agile tools that help in cutting out unnecessary tasks and give you better control over every aspect of the project.\n\n11. Encourage the teams to self-organize:\n\nAgile methodology champions the principle of self-organization within teams. By working collaboratively, each team member is empowered to take responsibility for delivering value and satisfaction to customers. This approach promotes motivation and a sense of ownership, creating a more coherent and agile team. \"The best architectures, designs, and requirements emerge from the self-organizing teams\" because they are driven by a shared vision that inspires them to work together towards a common goal.\n\n12. Reflect regularly and improve continuously:\n\nAgile methodologies are built on the foundation of iteration, where teams learn from their previous mistakes and consistently enhance their performance. Project managers should proactively promote team reflection sessions to discuss ways to improve technical and management skills, encouraging the team to be confident in their abilities to excel.\n\nCheck:Latest Agile Trends\n\n4 values of the Agile Manifesto:\n\n1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools:\n\nThe first value of the Agile manifesto prioritizes individuals over processes and tools. It underscores the importance of valuing people, as they directly address business requirements. When techniques and tools drive development, it can hinder responsiveness to customer needs and the delivery of desired value. Agile emphasizes the significance of interacting with customers to understand their unique requirements, which processes and tools cannot achieve. Effective communication is the key, where individuals excel in prompt and explicit interactions, swiftly addressing customer inquiries and suggestions, unlike the rigid schedules and fixed content of processes and tools. Thus, Agile gives precedence to individuals over processes and tools.\n\n2. Working software over comprehensive documentation:\n\nThe second of the Agile manifesto values removes overemphasis on documentation. Earlier, much time was spent documenting the development process and delivery. Sometimes, it was so overemphasized that it was done at the cost of the product. The list of documents was long, like technical specifications, requirements, and prospectus, and each needed approvals. All this resulted in long delays in the development of the product.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto does not entirely remove the need for documentation. Still, it reduces it to the extent that developers do not get entangled in it but are more focused on the ultimate deliverable, i.e., the product. The difference is that the Agile manifesto does not entirely ignore the value of documentation but puts more importance on working software. So, the team's focus moves from the process to the result.\n\n3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:\n\nIn the past, during the waterfall approach or traditional methodologies, negotiations with the customer took place before the actual development started. The customer's requirements were discussed in great detail before beginning work. However, the customer only interacted with the product manager or development team before and after the development process. They had no involvement during the process, and deliverables were decided before development started. This resulted in a waste of time and resources.\n\nHowever, the Agile Manifesto gives the customer more value and is involved with the development team throughout the process. This enables the development team to continuously focus on the customer's needs and collaborate with them throughout the process. The end-user becomes a part of all the development team meetings and is provided with regular conversations to evaluate the product's performance.\n\n4. Responding to change by following a plan:\n\nThe traditional software development process is not too adaptive to change, so making any changes involves high costs. Making detailed plans and rigidly adhering to them isn't conducive to smooth processes because change is inevitable. However, traditional methodologies avoid change because of the expenses involved.\n\nAgile is open to change. The focus is on releasing a minimum working product for evaluation and adjusting per the customer's requirements or suggestions. Small iterations in Agile help shift priorities and add to the flexibility of the process. This also means that the customer can be delivered additional value. Therefore, in Agile, whenever the scope of the project changes, the development team can quickly adjust to the change and provide complete customer satisfaction. This is the last of the 4 Agile values.\n\nAlso, Check:\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn a world characterized by rapidly growing technological advancement and shifting market dynamics, the Agile Manifesto's emphasis on responsiveness and Agility is paramount. It empowers organizations to stay competitive, innovate, and remain customer-focused.\n\nIn essence, the Agile Manifesto is not just a framework for software development; it's a philosophy that underpins modern business strategies, offering a dynamic, customer-centric approach that helps organizations thrive in an ever-evolving landscape."
