        "text": "Matt Damon Explained Why He Had “Trouble” Watching Andrew Scott’s “Ripley” Adaptation, And It Makes Total Sense\n\nMatt’s comments come after he and Andrew Scott — who both portrayed Tom Ripley — had a surprise moment at the Met Gala with Jude Law.\n\nMatt Damon has mixed emotions about the latest Ripley adaptation.\n\nBack in 1999, Matt starred as Tom Ripley in The Talented Mr. Ripley, which was adapted from Patricia Highsmith’s 1955 novel of the same name.\n\nBecause the original film is so beloved, anticipation was high earlier this year when Netflix released Ripley, another adaptation of the 1955 novel, starring Andrew Scott as the titular character.\n\nAfter Ripley premiered in April, the eight-episode series — shot in black and white — received predominantly positive reviews, with many praising Andrew’s “spellbinding” performance in the lead role.\n\nBut despite the critical acclaim for Netflix’s Ripley, Matt explained in a new interview that it wasn’t all that easy for him to watch — but not for the reasons you might expect.\n\nIn an interview with IndieWire, Matt was asked if he’d ever revisit the iconic role. In his response, the Good Will Hunting star revealed his mixed emotions about the new adaptation following the death of Anthony Minghella, who directed him in The Talented Mr. Ripley 25 years ago.\n\nBack in May, Matt enjoyed a Ripley reunion at the Met Gala, where he was seated at the same table as Jude Law, who starred alongside him as Dickie Greenleaf in the 1999 movie. Andrew was also at the same table.\n\nYou can find Matt’s full interview with IndieWire here.\n\nShare This Article"
