        "text": "The title above was not created by an organizational consultant. These are the words of a software engineer and developer. But not just any developer.\n\nWe seem to have arrived at a point where the term “agile” is being used and applied in a variety of different ways. Perhaps it could be helpful to refer back in history to the origins. This is kind of like referring back to words of the “Founding Fathers” of the US Constitution. In 2001, a gathering of 17 “independent thinkers about software development”, who described themselves as “organizational anarchists,” created the Agile Manifesto. One of them, Jim Highsmith, wrote the following:\n\n“At the core, I believe Agile Methodologists are really about \"mushy\" stuff—about delivering good products to customers by operating in an environment that does more than talk about \"people as our most important asset\" but actually \"acts\" as if people were the most important, and lose the word \"asset\". So in the final analysis, the meteoric rise of interest in—and sometimes tremendous criticism of—Agile Methodologies is about the mushy stuff of values and culture.” Jim Highsmith, https://agilemanifesto.org/\n\nThe Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto\n\n“We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value”:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\n“That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”\n\nWe follow these principles:\n\nOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.\n\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\n\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\n\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\n\nSimplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.\n\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\nAs stated in the words of the Manifesto above, this is about culture, values, employee value proposition, behavior, communication, motivation, decision-making, quality, customer orientation, change, adaptability, sustainability:\n\nCustomer focused (outside in) and more: collaboration with customers\n\nWelcoming (adapting to) continuous change\n\nBusiness and software developers working together (inclusive, horizontal, cross-functional, silo-busting, diversity of perspectives)\n\nSelf-organizing teams (autonomous, decentralized, “hierarchical” in a sense, but not industrial top down structures)\n\nContinuous reflection, learning and adjustment of behaviors working together (leaders create climate for constructive “radical candor,” direct feedback)\n\nArt of minimizing unproductive work (simplicity and efficiency, not measured by volume of output, Minimal Viable Traction principles)\n\nTechnical excellence and design (motivated and rewarded for quality of outcomes)\n\nFrequent delivery of “working” software (minimal, outcomes oriented, rapid feedback loops)\n\nSustainable pace of human work (people, talent, motivation, work environment, lifestyle, employee value proposition)\n\nAgile. The mushy stuff."
