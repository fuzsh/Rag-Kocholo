        "text": "What is the Agile Manifesto?\n\nWritten in 2001, The Manifesto for Agile Software Development was created by a small group of software development luminaries who gathered to discuss how to solve some of the issues plaguing the software development industry.\n\nDetailed within are the 12 Agile Principles and 4 Agile Values. These ideas were created to address the inefficiency of existing software development methods which relied heavily on cumbersome documentation procedures and other unhelpful processes.\n\nWhat the authors did not predict is the impact this document would have beyond the software development industry. Today, businesses in every industry from public relations to advertising make use of Agile in one way or another. That is because the authors of the Agile Manifesto created simple guidance that benefits both business owners and employees.\n\nAgile aids product development by stripping away unproductive processes and choosing to focus on activities that directly contribute to aiding development.\n\nIn doing so, Agile not only speeds development and aids the implementation of creative solutions but indirectly benefits workers by making the entire process easier, less stressful, and more rewarding.\n\nThese Agile ideas are still used today in contemporary agile project management methods. If you choose to take an agile project management course for example, you’ll notice the themes and principles therein closely resemble the ideas of the Agile Manifesto.\n\nWhile the implementation of the agile framework may vary depending on which industry-specific methodology you are studying, understanding why the Agile Manifesto was written and why it is still relevant today is an ideal way to start your agile education!\n\nThe 4 Agile Manifesto Values\n\nThe 4 Agile Values demonstrate how Agile differentiates itself from the traditional methodologies used to manage projects:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\nPeople respond to business needs and drive the development process, not tools. Tools are, by their very nature, less responsive to change and unable to meet customer needs.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\nAgile is about streamlining rather than eliminating documentation. Documentation has its’ value but should never be prioritized over the product.\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\nIn traditional project management, customers dictate requirements for a product before work starts and have little to no interaction with developers. Agile however, considers the customer to be an integral member of the development team\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\nAgile works in short development iterations. This short timescale allows for changes to be implement quickly and cost-effectively. Agile sees change as a way to improve a project.\n\nIs the Agile Manifesto still relevant?\n\nDespite industry changes and technological improvements, the Agile Manifesto’s flexibility, adaptive nature, and liberal use of common-sense makes it just as relevant today as it was more than two decades ago.\n\nBeyond the many agile methods and frameworks, Agile is a mindset and a philosophy. It sets out some guiding principles and values, not rules. Being ‘agile’ doesn’t require that you use any particular agile tool, process or framework. The principles and values of Agile simply encourage business owners and developers to use a little common sense in their approach to project development.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Agile Manifesto is no more than a document which describes how successful teams can better work together."
