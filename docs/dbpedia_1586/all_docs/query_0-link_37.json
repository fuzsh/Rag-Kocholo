        "text": "If you haven’t been watching this space, then you should know that the async-first manifesto is in its second draft now. It’s a collaborative exercise - everyone can comment and if you want to co-author, introduce yourself to me and I’ll share access. If you’re curious to know about how I started with the idea of a manifesto, you can read this explanatory post, or watch the video below.\n\nBut all this said, why do we need a new manifesto? Isn’t the agile manifesto enough to describe how knowledge-working teams should collaborate? I want to address that question in today’s post.\n\nSnowbird hosted a generational shift\n\nI was only a student of computing in 2001 when the agile manifesto came into being. None of the textbooks I read at the time had a word about agile. We learned instead, about the software development life cycle - i.e. SDLC. Of course, you only had to jump onto an open-source mailing list, to hear murmurs about software development countercultures. At the time, we read about curiously named frameworks like Scrum, Crystal or XP. I can assure you though, that when I started working, soon after the Snowbird meeting, agile software development wasn’t mainstream. In fact, I would have my first brush with professional, agile software development, only when I join Thoughtworks in 2007.\n\nWhen you read the reflections of the 17 men who authored the manifesto, back in the day, their vision was to free makers (the developer community) “from the baggage of Dilbertesque corporations”. As Jim Highsmith wrote back in the day, the idea was to restore balance.\n\nIndeed, the manifesto was a revolutionary document back then. And it marks the beginning of what some people call the agile movement. To paraphrase Ron Jeffries - the manifesto described a thing called “agile”. That thing grows and updates all the time and it’s up to us, as practitioners, to build the body of knowledge that the manifesto inspires.\n\nWe’re in a new generation now\n\nThe “Dilbertesque corporation” of 2023 looks quite different from its 2001 avatar. Back in the day, the makers’ battle was against “process for the sake of process”. Developers hated wading through voluminous, turgid and unclear documents, for example. They’d rather build software iteratively and cleanly, so the code can serve as documentation, and customer feedback could guide future development. Over the last two decades, knowledge workers have embraced the truisms of the manifesto so deeply, that we now see a different Dilbert story.\n\nUnoriginal as it may seem, we are borrowing the agile manifesto’s approach to stating its values as tradeoffs. We’re also describing the principles that inspire these values. Like the agile manifesto took inspiration from many existing methodologies, we too take inspiration from existing, but promising models of executing and describing knowledge work. Deep work, TeamOps, DevEx and my work on “async-first” are only some sources of inspiration. This isn’t the only manifesto of its kind either. You’ll see many others who’ve taken a crack at this problem before (see here, here, here, here and here). So there’s a need to band together and build a statement that’s more than an individual’s opinion.\n\nThere’s no rush and no deadline, except one that we impose on ourselves. We can take all the time we need to feel comfortable with the document. I’d like to iterate through this statement with anyone interested to contribute. So if today’s post convinces you that modern collaboration could benefit from a manifesto, I invite you to join the conversation and help shape the document. Let’s imagine the future of work together!\n\n* The references to Dilbert are not an endorsement of Scott Adams’s racist comments."
