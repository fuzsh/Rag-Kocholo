        "text": "The Agile Manifesto is a document that outlines the core ideas and principles that underpin the Agile mindset. It is intended to assist development teams in becoming more efficient and sustainable in their work.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto for Agile Software Development, which is officially known as ‘The Manifesto for Agile Software Development,’ is a document that details four values and twelve principles.\n\nThe manifesto includes two agile principles and four agile values that provide valuable direction for anyone interested in practicing agile product management and software development, although they are not prescriptive.\n\nThere are no explicit processes, procedures, or best practices for agile in the Agile Manifesto. This is done on purpose. The designers had no intention of creating a prescriptive framework or technique. Instead, they developed a philosophical approach to software development.\n\nThe History Of The Agile Manifesto\n\nEven though many agile concepts have been there since the 1970s, the manifesto itself and the entire explanation of the agile mindset were created around the beginning of this century.\n\nIn the spring of 2001, 17 software developers met twice, once in Portland, Oregon, and again in Snowbird, Utah, to discuss difficulties and solutions in software development. At these sessions, the manifesto was born for the first time.\n\nThe manifesto was drafted to respond to widespread dissatisfaction with traditional development approaches prevalent in the 1990s.\n\nWith the rise of personal computing, the product and software development landscape have shifted dramatically. Developers present at the meeting — and across the whole industry — expressed concern that the existing quo was no longer viable.\n\nA three-year lag period existed between business requirements and the development of appropriate solutions, and the conventional processes in place at the time were clunky, inadequate, and overburdened with documentation and monitoring.\n\nIt was the 17 developers who convened in Oregon and Utah that formed the ‘Agile Alliance,’ which advocated a new way of working that was built around a set of values and principles that would “return credibility to the word methodology,'” according to the group’s mission statement.\n\nThe manifesto was created to empower developers, speed up procedures, and encourage working styles that are more directly focused on users’ needs.\n\nBecause of the values and principles, teams may be more adaptive, respond more quickly and effectively to change, and remain in a continuous reimagination fueled by frequent consumer input, among other things.\n\nThe manifesto, which was first published in February 2001, has served as the foundation for many frameworks, approaches, and various ways of working.\n\nThe Purpose Of the Agile Manifesto\n\nThe agile manifesto is intended to serve as a declaration to improve software development practices. It is also designed to respond directly to the inefficiency of traditional development procedures that rely on extensive documentation and provide slight supervision possibilities.\n\nWhile the initial document was intended to aid software developers in developing business solutions in a more timely and efficient manner, it has significantly impacted the more extensive development industry and its surrounding communities.\n\n12 Agile Principles\n\nThe main objective of the 12 Agile principles is to satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software to them as soon as possible and consistently.\n\nEven late in the development process, it is acceptable to accommodate changing requirements. Agile procedures harness change to benefit the customer’s competitive advantage.\n\nDelivery of working software regularly (every few weeks to every few months), with a preference for the shorter timescales, is required.\n\nClients and developers must collaborate daily throughout the project.\n\nCreate projects that are centered on highly motivated individuals. Please provide them with the environment and support they require and put your faith in their ability to complete the task.\n\nTo effectively communicate information to and within a development team, face-to-face communication is the most efficient and practical approach.\n\nThe primary indicator of progress is the presence of functional software.\n\nAgile approaches encourage long-term development by requiring sponsors, developers, and users to be able to keep up with a continuous pace for an extended time.\n\nAgility is enhanced by paying close attention to technical quality and intelligent design.\n\nSimplicity — the art of minimizing the effort to be done — is critical to success.\n\nIt is self-organizing teams that produce the most effective architectures, requirements, and designs.\n\nThe team takes time off at regular intervals to consider how it may become more productive and then tunes and alters its behavior in response.\n\nAgile alliance\n\nThere were 17 original signatories to the Agile Manifesto who got together to find a solution to the perceived evils of the software development business. A collection wrote the Agile Manifesto of developers, scientists, programmers, and authors.\n\nThis group featured several innovators and producers of prior agile frameworks, and the Agile Manifesto was written before the group’s founding principles were established. A few examples include Kent Back of extreme programming, Jim Highsmith of adaptive software development, and Jeff Sutherland of agile software development, to mention a few.\n\nThe complete list of signatures is as follows:\n\nKent Beck, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, James Grenning, Jim Highsmith, Andrew Hunt, Ron Jeffries, Jon Kern, Brian Marick, Robert C. Martin, Steve Mellor, Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, and Dave Thomas are among the actors who have appeared in the film as well as in the television series.\n\nThis group was later known as the Agile Alliance. After the Manifesto was released, the alliance formed a global NGO, which now has a community of more than 72,000 members. The Agile Alliance hosts regular Meetings and organizes initiatives to support local groups.\n\nToday, we are More than two decades after the birth of the Agile Manifesto. In that time, teams worldwide have embraced the four values and 12 principles within the document. At the 14th Annual State of Agile mansion, more than 95% of respondents confirmed that their organizations practiced Agile development methods.\n\nAlthough the Agile Manifesto was made for the software development community, it has been a critical resource for planning projects. The State of Agile report mentioned numerous sectors outside software development that have adopted Agile practices, including IT, operations, marketing, HR, and sales.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto Today\n\nWhether or not the Agile Manifesto is still relevant today is debatable.\n\nAlthough the industry has changed, time has passed, and the Agile Manifesto has been applied to sectors and organizations. Beyond its original scope, the manifesto’s flexibility and adaptive nature have ensured that it remains relevant in today’s world.\n\nSomewhat dictating specific techniques, the Agile Manifesto establishes idea management and ideals that guide the way people think about and approach their work. As a result, many developers operate with an agile attitude without knowing and recognizing they do so. Essentially, the manifesto formalizes how many successful teams have historically used it.\n\nThe main issue with the manifesto today is not whether or not it is still relevant but rather how it is being applied — or, more specifically, how it is being misused.\n\nIn part because of its adaptability, one of the most severe challenges with agile is that some teams refer to themselves as such without adequately applying or comprehending the core concepts of the methodology.\n\nThe manifesto is occasionally used as an ‘excuse’ by many ‘agile teams, who, for example, will sometimes abandon traditional development procedures and reject rigor without ever correctly understanding the fundamentals that underpin an agile mindset.\n\nIn the right hands, though, the manifesto is still as relevant now as it was first created. It may be a tremendously beneficial tool for individual developers, teams, and even entire companies.\n\nIn conclusion, while the 12 agile principles and four values for agile provide helpful guidance for the people who wish to practice agile software development, they are not prescriptive.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto does not mention any specific processes, procedures, or best methods for agile. And that it is how they intended it to be. The creators did not set out to develop a rigid framework or methodology. Instead, they created a philosophical mindset for software development."
