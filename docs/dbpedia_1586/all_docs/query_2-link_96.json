        "text": "More than two decades ago, the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development,” including the “Principles behind the Agile Manifesto,” was documented and published by seventeen men. One of the twelve principles is the statement, “Agile processes promote sustainable development.” This post attempts to clarify the definition of “agile processes” and “sustainable development.” To understand the term “agile processes,” there is a discussion about the historical background of working agile—secondly, a discussion of Scrum as one agile idea that teams use. Thirdly, there is an assessment as to whether there could be a problem for a Religious believer to work agile. The “Principles behind the Agile Manifesto” contains a kind of definition for the term “sustainable development.” This definition is revealed, and another quite modern explanation is presented. The main part of this paper is the description of three major stumbling blocks that prevent a team from working agile. These three are “not enough people or time”, “no acceptance of the agile way of work,” and “misunderstanding of agile.” There will be a possible explanation or reaction for each stumbling block to remove or shorten the block described in each case. Finally, the paper summarizes the most important findings.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver two decades ago, the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” was published (Beck et al., 2001). This manifesto is accompanied by twelve “Principles behind the Agile Manifesto” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto). One of them started with the sentence, “Agile processes promote sustainable development” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto). In this paper, I will determine whether or not the statement is fulfilled. First, there is a chapter about the definition of “agile processes,” and second about the definition of “sustainable development”. After that, the question is asked: What prevents “agile processes” from promoting “sustainable development”?\n\nWhat is Meant by Agile Processes?\n\nThe term “agile processes” is mentioned two times in the principles (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto). Both sentences do not define what is meant by “agile processes”. Therefore, we will look closely at the history of agile project management to find an explanation. I differentiate between “agile” and “agility”. “Agility is the ability of a business as a whole” (Schoor, 2022), and “agile is for single teams” (Schoor, 2022). Focusing on teams, I only use the term “agile”.\n\nA Brief History of Agile Project Management\n\nIn the early 20s of the 21st century, agile is an umbrella term for many methods, frameworks, and ideas created to help people become more and more effective and efficient at their work. But how did it start? “Agile project management goes back to agile software development. The first books about agile software development were published in the 90s” (Kessler, 2019, p.165). One of them was a book about Extreme Programming (see Beck, 1999), often shortened as XP. Because the first people writing about agile were not the first persons ever working, some of their ideas feel outdated and obvious. So I want to remind you that software development is quite a new industry (at least, compared to theology). Just a little over two decades ago, seventeen men wrote the text that is known as “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” (Beck et al., 2001). This text also includes the “Principles behind the Agile Manifesto” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto).\n\nSome people just read the manifesto and ignore the principles. But both belong together. The manifesto only describes values, the principles go much deeper. Together, they describe the mindset that is necessary for agile development. (Kessler, 2019, p.167)\n\nInterestingly, neither the manifesto nor the principles answer the question, “How do I work in an agile way in detail?”. Extreme Programming, Scrum, and others each give a part of the answer, so many teams combine different agile methods and frameworks. (Kessler, 2019, p.169)\n\nToday, many methods, frameworks, and ideas are summarized under the umbrella term agile. Some older ideas got a new coat of paint. Therefore, a complete list of agile processes is nearly impossible to write and will be outdated very soon. However, there are agile processes that have become quite popular. The framework Scrum (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.4) and the Kanban Method (Anderson and Carmichael, 2016, p. 1), for example, were named by Lambers (2018) and Pein (2018) in their articles as pars pro toto for agile project management.\n\nThe Framework Scrum\n\nBeing aware that the framework Scrum is just one of the many agile ideas, I will describe it further. The Scrum framework needs agile principles as the foundation.[1] “Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.3). The official Scrum Guide, written by Schwaber and Sutherland (2020), explains the whole framework. For further information, I recommend Wolf and Rock (2021).\n\nThe important time unit in Scrum is the Sprint. “Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.8). “A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.8). All the other events and all the activities at the framework happen at one specific Sprint. “The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. Scrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.5). One accountability is the Product Owner. “The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.5). To be able to do this, the Product Owner must be aware of the needs and wishes of the customers, users, and stakeholders.\n\nWith this background about the history and this first insight into one framework, we could ask: Is this way of working suitable for Religious believers? Are there similarities between work in an agile way and the Religious faith?\n\nAgile Project Management and Religion\n\nIs agile project management something religious? “A religious book is not a handbook on leadership” (Kessler, 2013, p.6), nor is it a book about project management. Of course, I could force some biblical stories to fit in agile work. Yet, I do not think this is an appropriate way of using the Holy Scripture.\n\nBeing agile and being religious have in common the idea of “never done all”. I cannot imagine a point where the Religious have prayed enough, read the bible enough, and so on. To quote another principle: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto). That is also a never-ending task.\n\nIn their different views, both see humankind as humans on the way. In Religious literature, there are several books about this theme. A quite famous one is “Pilgrim’s Progress,” written by John Bunyan. This book contains two parts. Both describe the allegory of a believing person (see Bunyan, 2014). Other authors, for example, Lewis (1985) and Taylor (n.d.), also adopted this idea. And if we look at the agile framework Scrum, we have the “Sprint.” Using the sports metaphor “Sprint,” we can see the “idea of moving forward”. Living in both worlds, I am convinced that the Religious could work agilely and that churches could profit from adapting agile ideas. Identifying and describing them for the churches would be enough material for another article.\n\nThis is quite a short overview of “agile processes.” In a later chapter, some books about specific ideas are mentioned. They are useful for a deeper insight into a specific theme. However, let us look at how “sustainable development” was defined.\n\nWhat Is Meant by “Sustainable Development”?\n\nThe principle quoted in this article's title is longer than the presently used quote. The principle is that “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto). So, an aim is “a constant pace indefinitely” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto). “So, sustainability in this sense will ensure people will not be burned out by an insane deadline. Instead, a sustainable pace ensures a delivery speed that can be kept up for an infinite time” (Eckstein, 2021). The constant pace contains a time buffer (see Kessler, 2022) and vacation (see Milner, 2021). It does not contain work overtime.[2] At XP, one practice is: “The XP rule is simple—you can't work a second week of overtime” (Beck, 1999, p.60). At Scrum, sprints are called the “heartbeat of Scrum” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.8) The linguistic image heartbeat implies a constant pace. Too abrupt changes of speed are to be avoided. Following the rules (and the spirit) of this agile idea, “a constant pace indefinitely” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto) is possible. So, we can state that working agilely leads to a “sustainable development”, as described here.\n\nYet, this “sustainable development” definition could feel a bit sub-complex. Another interpretation could be the point of “sustainable development” using energy to run the deployed software. This point starts with the question as to where the software is running. “The cloud sounds light and weightless, yet the opposite is true. The server farms the cloud runs on use much energy, and we can make a difference depending on the server farm we choose” (Eckstein, 2021). This interpretation is not yet that common in the agile world, so I focus on the point described before.\n\nAfter this explanation of “sustainable development”, we can clarify, what can prevent a team to get it. There are three major stumbling blocks.\n\nThree Stumbling Blocks (And How to Deal Within)\n\nThe sentence “Agile processes promote sustainable development” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto) is cleverly worded. If we find teams that would disagree, the authors always could go back to “We just started promoting, not creating”. However, some stumbling blocks make it difficult to succeed without help from a team working agile. To identify them, we change the focus. What do we need to become successful? “The main building blocks for the success of an agile project specifically are time, acceptance and understanding of agile methodologies, quality, budget and scope”. (Chiyangwa and Mnkandla, 2017, p.2) This quote names three potential stumbling blocks. To remove or shorten these blocks, the agile way of work sometimes needs help from other disciplines.\n\nNot Enough People or Time\n\nSometimes, companies start projects. Lack of personnel (or unwilling to pay enough) or lack of time results in someone deciding to work agile to compensate for the deficiency.\n\nThe main problem of lack of personnel can be seen in a short metaphor: Imagine a rowing boat designed for eight rowers. Sometimes, just six rowers are set into the boat. They will never succeed and win, which will not change even if they row agilely.\n\nThere is also a metaphor about the time: A flight between Frankfurt and Oslo lasts two hours. One main factor is the distance. The distance does not change no matter how you work. Yet, an airline company can become agile: more focus on the passengers, faster or better quality in responding to questions, better ways of boarding, and so on. Only their core competency, flying from one place to another, will only become faster with improving the planes.\n\nHow would you like to handle this? At Scrum, the “Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.5). The important question is: What can maximize “the value of the product” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.5)? Features that don't benefit this aim are less important.[3] If a team lacks personnel or time, the decisions made by the Product Owner become increasingly important. But most people do not want their (emotional) preferred feature to come later or never.\n\nNo Acceptance for the Agile Way of Work\n\nWorking in an agile way can disrupt the people and the company. This includes the people working as well as the people not working agile. Some frameworks and methods have very specific rules on how to work. This also contains the communication to the outside. So, all have to accept the new game rules. Not accepting them or as an executive to override them, blocks the agile way of work. If we look at Scrum again: “For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions” (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.6). This also includes respecting the “Product Owner is one person, not a committee”(Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020, p.6). A Product Owner committee or a committee that the Product Owner has to ask for permission contrasts the Scrum guide.\n\nIt is necessary to understand why people behave this way in disturbing the change. Is it just part of the change process? There are different change curves to describe the reactions to change. One that is quite popular is the “Kubler-Ross change curve” (Malone, 2018, p.36). “The first reaction to significant change typically is shock, followed quickly by denial. People in this phase may not be fully functioning and may need additional reassurance and guidance” (Malone, 2018, p.37). The next step is frustration. “Frustration is followed by depression or the ‘pit of despair’” (Malone, 2018, p.37). “After depression, things typically start to get better” (Malone, 2018, p.37).\n\nIn this case, there are solutions in all the literature about the change process. Another solution must be found if the change process cannot explain this behavior. It may have to do with missing knowledge.\n\nMisunderstanding of Agile\n\nThere are no set rules regarding who can speak or teach about agile. In Germany, everyone who wants to can call himself an agile coach. Some people already teach about agile without knowing the methods, frameworks, and ideas. Some even confuse agile with a (only in German) same-name model of Talcott Parsons (see Kühl, 2020). People who were taught that way may never have heard about the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development” (Beck et al., 2001) or the “Principles behind the Agile Manifesto” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto). Of course, someone could argue that these teams are not working agile but rather pretending to. But, they think they are working agile. I would accept that as a misunderstanding of Agile.\n\nLuckily, there are good books, articles, and blogs about methods, frameworks, and ideas. Just as examples, there are books about Extreme Programming (see Beck, 1999), the Kanban Method (see Anderson and Carmichael, 2016), and Scrum (see Wolf and Roock, 2021). However, how could you check that people have read the books, articles, and blogs they claimed to read?\n\nSome methods and frameworks now have certified learn paths (see Certification Types & Tracks and Kanban University Development Path). Of course, more than certifications will be needed to solve this problem. Certificates are no silver bullets. A certificate can only prove the Learning, not the Understanding. The first sentence of the Manifesto is, “We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it” (Beck et al., 2001). (software) practitioners wrote the manifesto. The agile community needs learning from people doing what they teach, not from teaching all day.\n\nAnd what about the people who have to work agile without understanding it? Of course, they could and should visit some “in a nutshell” - courses. Or, the learning could be integrated into the daily work. Stein describes one version used with a Scrum team: every day, the team got a fifteen-minute input about one special Scrum aspect (see Stein, 2022). Because of the expected outcome, they called it “Scrum Shots” (Stein, 2022). Stein described the idea as a field report that could be tried in other teams or contexts (Stein, 2022).\n\nConclusion\n\nAgile working can support “sustainable development” as defined here. But success also depends on the context, which, unfortunately, agile teams do not always have fully under control.\n\nAll projects have constraints. A project for which the team has seven people and the team cannot be expanded needs to be agile within that context. A team that is told to deliver by a certain date must be agile within that context. (Cohn, 2021)\n\nOne consequence could be that “a constant pace indefinitely” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto) in this context is impossible. Even a unachievable goal can inspire everyone to get as close as possible. So, “Agile processes promote sustainable development” (Principles behind the Agile Manifesto), as long as “Agile processes” are understood and followed carefully by all involved.\n\n[1] “Die Scrum-Mechanik nützt wenig, wenn die agilen Werte und Prinzipien nicht gelebt werden” (Wolf and Roock, 2021, p.144).\n\n[2] At one agile company, there is work overtime not even allowed. “Daher gilt bei uns die Devise: Keine Überstunden!” (Mois and Baldauf, 2018, p.45)\n\n[3] What about features that generate no value but are necessary by law? My preferred reaction is that a product not allowed by law has no value at all.\n\nBibliography\n\nAnderson, D. J. & Carmichael, A. (2016). ESSENTIAL KANBAN CONDENSED [E-Book] 28 July 2016.
