        "text": "Thoughtworks, a global technology company, today announced the launch of Jim Highsmith’s Adaptive Leadership: Accelerating Enterprise Agility, an original eBook from Pearson available through InformIT, Amazon, and other eBook resellers. The title is published in eBook formats – ePub, PDF, and Mobi – to be compatible with a range of eBook readers including the iPad, Nook and Kindle. It is also available on Safari Books Online.\n\nIn Adaptive Leadership, Highsmith has compiled, updated, and extended his best writings about agile and lean methods for a management audience. Key themes include:\n\nDrawing on what’s been learned in application development, this guide shows how to use adaptive leadership techniques to transform the way you deliver complete solutions, whatever form they take.\n\nHow enterprise agility can enable the ambitious organizational missions that matter most.\n\nHow leaders can deliver a continuous stream of value.\n\nHow to think disruptively about opportunities and how to respond quickly by creating more adaptive, innovative organizations.\n\nIntegrating economics, products, and social responsibility.\n\nUnderstanding the financial implications of technical debt.\n\n\"We are at a tipping point. Technology—cloud, big data, mobility, social media—tops CEOs’ list of concerns per a recent IBM study. Companies that emerge successfully from this havoc will need to build agility into the very fabric of their organizations and develop the technological savvy to enable that agility. Adaptive Leadership provides a framework for such a transformation,\" said Highsmith.\n\n\"Adaptive leadership throughout the organization is crucial. It’s not just about how the initial hypotheses of a business team may have been wrong, or how the velocity of a delivery team falls below expectations, or how either group must inpidually solve the problem. It’s now about how the entire organization can quickly understand and rapidly act upon this situation,” said Thoughtworks’ client John Crosby, VP of Product and Technology, lastminute.com.\n\nTo learn more about Thoughtworks’ Agile Project Management Services please visit: www.thoughtworks.com/agile-project-management\n\nAbout Jim Highsmith\n\nRecognized globally as a founder of the “Adaptive” Agile methodology and a co-author of the Agile Manifesto, Jim Highsmith is one of the most sought after for guidance through an Agile transformation.
