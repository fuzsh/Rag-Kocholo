        "text": "Psychological thrillers have always held a special place in the minds of avid readers, not only because of their intricate twists, but because of the pulse-pounding action that comes with diving into the plots, characters and themes that define each story. Although the genre kicked off between the late 19th and early 20th century, these stories continue to inspire intrigue and fascination decades later, with some also inspiring TV adaptations.\n\nTop Thriller Books\n\nA good psychological thriller book earns readers’ respect by capturing their attention with high-stakes conflict, unforgettable tension and unpredictable twists. Unlike mystery books, which focus on whodunits, thrillers emphasize the danger and psychological pressure faced by the protagonist and those around them. Suspense novels on the other hand, build slow, escalating anxiety, while thrillers deliver fast-paced excitement and looming danger. Some well-known psychological thriller authors include the king of horror, Stephen King, Gillian Flynn, whose Gone Girl revolutionized modern thrillers, and Patricia Highsmith, whose The Talented Mr. Ripley made Ripley a pop-culture phenom, even recognized in rap songs. With a growing search volume for terms like “psychological thriller books” and “thriller novels,” these stories continue to interest critics and avid readers. Here are 15 great psychological thrillers that have defined the core of the genre over decades, making a lasting impact on reading culture, public acceptance and popularity.\n\n15.
