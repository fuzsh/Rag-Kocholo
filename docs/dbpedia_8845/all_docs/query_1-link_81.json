        "text": "HENGE TRAVEL\n\nA city with a multifaceted past, Beirut is a combination of arts and cultures that span time and space, finding themselves in a condensed metropolis that continuously evolves without losing its historical roots.\n\nConsidered one of the most important cultural capitals in the Middle East, the Lebanese city of Beirut is located on the coast, at the foot of the mountain range that extends across the country. If, at the topographical level, Beirut already shows signs of dualities, this relatively big city is a combination of cultures, religions, and origins that spans centuries, millennia, and spatial boundaries. Beirut’s origins date back to a Canaanite settlement from the Bronze Age, but the earliest evidence can be dated back to the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. Etymology associates the probable Phoenician and Akkadian name Bêrūt to the meaning of “wells” or “water sources”, linking it to the Lebanese territory, the only Arab and Asian country entirely devoid of desert areas.\n\nIt is a place with ancient origins, a name that has remained unchanged for over 4,000 years and whose discoveries have revolutionized the entire world: from the first ship made by the Phoenician people to the first syllabary discovered in Byblos.\n\nThe best way to learn about the history of Beirut is to get lost along its streets and discover its cultures and places. The iconic idiosyncrasy of the Robert Mouawad Private Museum, for example, is worth a visit even just for its eclectic architecture. It verges on the absurd, placing in the same exhibition space both impressive prints of the Koran and the $11 million Victoria’s Secret “Fantasy Bra” worn by Heidi Klum. Beirut owes its historical inclusiveness to the populations that have inhabited it and that have dominated its territory. By following principles of tolerance over the centuries, various ethnic and religious groups have been able to coexist and thrive despite a large setback during the civil war. Home to many universities and museums, cultural centers, galleries, and art festivals, Beirut is certainly a city of international scope, in practice and in the collective imagination. How, therefore, do you enter this chaotic mix of colors, music, perfumes, foods, and artistic experiences? You can start with its popular tourist attractions and then discover the secrets of true Beirut. A must-see for a complete stay in this fast-paced city is undoubtedly the walk along the Corniche, a boardwalk that offers moments of pure magic when the sunset illuminates the entire city. Many fishermen line up along the coastal rock guards known as Pigeon Rocks, highlighting the city’s nature side. On the other side of the road, in this star capital for shopping and luxury, are the numerous Lamborghinis looking for a parking spot in front of the big names in fashion and restaurants. However, the real shopping in Beirut is hidden in the Sunday markets. Souk Al Ahad, where streets full of people are filled with desks, products, and colors, one can find absolutely everything. This market is certainly not for the faint of heart but is the place to breathe and taste the authentic souk identity.\n\nBeirut has earned the nickname of the Phoenix city, not only for its past dominations but for being destroyed and rebuilt seven times.\n\nBeirut’s multifaceted soul is reflected in the mosque of Al-Omari, built under the Mamluks to celebrate the expulsion of the Crusaders in 1291: a sanctuary in which the Mamluk, Ottoman, Greek, and Byzantine art blend together in a unique balance. The cult of beauty and the will to always maintain a mystical veil of uniqueness has accompanied the various rulers of the city, sometimes with very aggressive methods: the Emir Bashir Chehab II ensured that no other buildings was constructed using the same Beited-dine-style by cutting off the hands of any builder who took part in their completion. Speaking of chills, even if in a much more pleasant way, one cannot fail to mention the nine-minute cableway ride that links the Bay of Jounieh to Our Lady of Lebanon in Harissa, an incredible experience just outside of Beirut with a panoramic view that follows along the tree-lined mountain range to its peak.\n\nHome to art, architecture, culture, and entertainment, passions shared by many of its residents, Beirut has been reborn from the ashes of civil war. The city has become a hub for contemporary artistic development, halfway between two worlds and is a destination left to be discovered with its most iconic and surprising nuances.\n\nConsidered one of the most important cultural capitals in the Middle East, the Lebanese city of Beirut is located on the coast, at the foot of the mountain range that extends across the country. If, at the topographical level, Beirut already shows signs of dualities, this relatively big city is a combination of cultures, religions, and origins that spans centuries, millennia, and spatial boundaries.
