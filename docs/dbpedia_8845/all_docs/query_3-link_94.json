Lebanon was home to the Canaanites and the Phoenicians and their kingdoms made up a maritime culture that thrived for more than a thousand years (1550-539 BC). In 64 BC, the country came under the Roman Empire rule, and ultimately became one of the Empire’s leading Christianity centers. The Maronite Church, a monastic tradition, was established in the Mount Lebanon range during this era. Arab Muslims, later on, conquered the area, but the Maronites were able to hold onto their religion. A new religious group was, however, established in Mount Lebanon. This was known as the Druze and it lasted for centuries. The Maronites were able to re-establish contact with the Roman Catholic Church during the Crusades.
