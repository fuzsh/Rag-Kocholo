For other uses of \"Lebanon\", see Lebanon (disambiguation), Liban (disambiguation), and Libnan (disambiguation).\n\nLebanon ( LEB-ə-non, -⁠nən; Arabic: لُبْنَان, romanized:Lubnān, local pronunciation: [lɪbˈneːn]), officially the Republic of Lebanon,[lower-alpha 3] is a country in the Levant region of West Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east, by Israel to the south, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the west; Cyprus lies a short distance away from the country's coastline. Lebanon is located at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterlands.[13] Lebanon has a population of more than five million people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi). Beirut is the country's capital and largest city.\n\n\"Lebanese Republic\" redirects here. Not to be confused with the predecessor state (1926–1946).\n\nQuick Facts Republic of Lebanonالجمهورية اللبنانية (Arabic)al-Jumhūrīyah al-Lubnānīyah, Capitaland largest city ...\n\nClose\n\nThe earliest evidence of human civilization in Lebanon dates back to 5000 BCE.[14] From 3200 to 539 BC, what was to become Lebanon was part of Phoenicia, a maritime empire that stretched the Mediterranean Basin.[15] In 64 BC, the region of Lebanon became part of the Roman Empire, which soon became a major center for Christianity under the aegis of the Byzantine Empire. After the 7th century, the region came under the rule of different caliphates, including the Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates. The 11th century saw the beginning of the Crusades and the establishment of Crusader states, which later fell to the Ayyubids and the Mamluks, and eventually to the Ottomans. Under Ottoman ruler Abdulmejid I, the first Lebanese proto-state was established in the form of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, created in the 19th century as a home for Maronite Christians under the Ottoman Tanzimat period.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, the region of modern-day Lebanon came under the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, to be administered by France, which established Greater Lebanon. However, French rule over the region weakened significantly in the aftermath of the German invasion of France in 1940, during World War II. By 1943, Lebanon had gained independence from Free France and subsequently established a distinct form of confessionalist government, with the state's major religious groups being apportioned specific political powers. The new Lebanese state was relatively stable for a short period after independence,[16] but this was ultimately shattered by the outbreak of large-scale fighting in the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). Amidst the internal hostilities of this period, Lebanon was also subjugated by two overlapping military occupations: by Syria from 1976 to 2005 and by Israel from 1985 to 2000. Since the end of the conflicts, there have been extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure.[17]"
