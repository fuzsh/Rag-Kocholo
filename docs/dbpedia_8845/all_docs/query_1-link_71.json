This land area is approximately 100% of the area of Hawaii. Lebanon is thus one of the smallest countries in Asia by area and ranked 169th worldwide. With 512 inhabitants per km², it is also one of the most densely populated countries. An exceptionally high proportion of residents (89%) belongs to the urban population."
