        "text": "Extract\n\n[...] The treaty was seen as a victory for the Allied Powers and a defeat for the Ottoman Empire, as it imposed harsh terms on the latter, including the loss of territories, the forced disarmament of the Ottoman military, and the occupation of Constantinople by Allied forces. The treaty was never fully implemented, as it was rejected by the Turkish National Movement, which fought against the Allied occupation and ultimately succeeded in establishing the Republic of Turkey. This treaty split up the Ottoman Empire. [...]\n\n[...] It was a means of reaffirming the French mandate. The constitution establishes the spirit of the laws, it marks the personality of the state (the relationship between the governors and the governed and the source of power, the supreme principle). We still speak of \"local\" power because \"national\" power is subject to the mandate, it is in the hands of France. The duty of the mandatary was to provide the inhabitants with an organic status. The mandate allowed the Lebanese to create a state and thus their own administration, justice and politics.

Druze had equal claim to Lebanon so the Christians attempted to establish an autonomous Lebanon which took no account of Druze aspirations. [...]\n\n[...] It faced a number of challenges, including the resistance of the Ottoman authorities and the competing interests of the different religious and ethnic groups within Lebanon. The Declaration of Greater Lebanon and French Mandate B.1) Paris Peace Conference in 1919 Then, the Paris Peace Conference. In 1919, Batrak Elias Howayek, a Maronite patriarch, went to the Peace Conference in Versailles and asked for an enlarged independent Lebanon. The Delegation from Lebanon was composed of Emile Edde, two other Christians, a Druze, and a Muslim. [...]\n\n[...] Great Lebanon opiate under his executive and legislative authority, he is assisted by a secretary general. The two men represent the supreme authority of the state. The High Commissioner and Chief of the Army of the Levant manage the strategic Syria-Lebanon relationship. He reports to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the local stage, the local administrators, the sandjaks, are under the control of French military advisors, officers often from North Africa and Indochina. The executive power is delegated to a French governor appointed by the high commissioner on whom he depends on and to whom he is responsible for order, security and administration. [...]"
