        "text": "Located at the intersection of the Mediterranean west and Arabian east, Lebanon's culture has been shaped by its diverse influences, and has been referred to as the 'Switzerland of the East' and the 'Paris of the Middle East'. Beirut is Lebanon's capital and largest city, as well as its political and economic center. Unusually, no official population census has been carried out in Lebanon since 1932, but most recent estimates suggest that the population of Beirut is between around 940,000 and 1.3 million, with as many as 2.2 million in the greater metropolitan area. Beirut is one of the oldest cities in the world, and has been inhabited for more than five thousand years.\n\nThe northern city of Tripoli is the second-largest city in Lebanon, with an approximate population of 730,000. Tripoli overlooks the Mediterranean Sea, and the Palm Islands – the only islands in Lebanon and a protected area for rare turtles, seals and birds – lie off the coast of the city. The mountainous city of Zahlé is the third-largest in the country. It is known for its moderate and pleasant climate and beautiful scenery, and is home to a predominantly Greek Catholic population of 120,000 residents known as Zahlawis."
