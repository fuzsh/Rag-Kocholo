        "text": "• 1951\n\nRiad al-Solh is assassinated in Jordan by a member of the Syrian Social National Party. The party alleged that Solh had played a role in the thwarting of their coup, which subsequently led to the arrest and execution of their leader, Antoine Saadeh.\n\n• 1958\n\nIn 1958, Muslims opposed the extension of President Camille Chamoun's term owing to his pro-Western stance. They participated in a brief civil uprising orchestrated by Saeb Salam and the socialist Druze leader Kamal Jumblatt, backed by the United Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria.\n\n• 1970\n\nFollowing the election of President Suleiman Franjieh, Prime Minister Saeb Salam spearheads an initiative to dismantle the influence of the \"Second Bureau,\" which had wielded significant control over Lebanese political affairs during the presidencies of Fouad Chehab and Charles Helou.\n\n• 1973\n\nA major political crisis unfolds after the Israeli Operation Spring of Youth (The Vedrun Massacre), leading Christians to advocate for the deployment of the army to control Palestinian camps. Nevertheless, this proposition encounters resistance from Muslims aligned with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, as well as leftist political factions.\n\n• 1973\n\nSaeb Salam steps down as prime minister in response to the crisis surrounding the deployment of the army and the ensuing confrontation with the Palestinians.\n\n• 1975\n\nLebanon's civil war begins. Lebanese Sunnis become involved in limited armed involvement, confined mainly to certain peripheral Nasserite groups and joining Palestinian and leftist organisations. Other Sunni figures enjoy prominent roles within various entities throughout this tumultuous period, led by Saeb Salam, Grand Mufti Hassan Khaled, and subsequently Prime Minister Salim Hoss.\n\n• 1989\n\nThe assassination of Grand Mufti Hassan Khaled is seen as a chilling warning to the Lebanese Sunni community for opposing Syrian policies in Lebanon.\n\nThe same year, the Taif Agreement is reached in Saudi Arabia, which ends Lebanon's civil war. It underscores the role of the Sunni sect in Lebanon as a bridge for national reconciliation and the subsequent reconstruction of the country.\n\nThis transformative phase is notably steered by businessman Rafik Hariri, who assumed the position of prime minister in 1992.\n\n• 2005\n\nHariri is assassinated by a car bomb, which deals a significant blow to both the reconstruction efforts and the influential role of the Sunni community in Lebanese politics.\n\nRead more: The legacy of Rafik Hariri and the collapse of the Lebanese state\n\n• 2008\n\nHezbollah forces occupy the Sunni-majority capital, Beirut, and establish a new political dynamic in favour of their party and its allies following the implementation of the Doha Agreement.\n\n• 2019\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri resigns following mass protests against corruption and worsening living conditions. Many Sunnis perceive this as yet another effort to marginalise their influence — especially in light of the ruling coalition's resistance to making concessions or stepping down.\n\n• 2020\n\nA catastrophic explosion rips through the capital's seaport, heavily damaging parts of east Beirut. Subsequently, the Hezbollah-backed government led by Hassan Diab resigns, resulting in a further weakening of the Sunni position.\n\n• 2022\n\nSaad Hariri declares the suspension of his political engagements. The Future Movement, under his leadership, which has historically held sway over the majority of Sunni seats in both parliament and the government since the 1990s, opts to abstain from participating in the parliamentary elections despite some of its supporters joining Najib Mikati's government.\n\nThis decision places the Sunni sect in an unprecedented situation. They lack representation within the present-day power-sharing arrangements in the Lebanese political system and have limited ability to push for their interests."
