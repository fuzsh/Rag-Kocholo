        "text": "What would it take for Lebanon to a. not be as sectarian in its politics for a century and a half (and steadily being more so over that time) and b. be more strongly Christian (especially Maronite), such that it avoids the civil war of 1975-90, increased corruption among the political elites after that, and the economic collapse ongoing since 2019 (and to this day remaining the financial and tourist centre of the Arab Middle East the way it was until 1975)?\n\nSome choices for a point of divergence from reality:\n\na) a Crusader victory in the Levant as a whole in the Middle Ages (though that would have massive implications both in the entire Levant and elsewhere in the known world)\n\nb) heavier Western missionary activity in the Levant in general or Lebanon specifically (probably accompanied by higher French settlement, perhaps sort of in the style of Algeria)\n\nc) less European colonialism than in real life\n\nd) less Maronite and other Christian emigration to destinations like Egypt, West Africa, France, the Americas, etc. than in reality\n\ne) any one of the numerous Maronite-Druze conflicts in the Mt. Lebanon area in the mid-19th century (whether the big one in 1860 or lesser ones beforehand) are either averted or are less severe, thus saving scores of Maronite lives\n\nf) a less severe Mt. Lebanon famine in 1915-18 (e.g. no locust outbreak - though some sort of famine would be inevitable given the multiple and often interlocking causes) such that significantly fewer Maronites die than in real life\n\ng) no (or less) expansion of Greater Lebanon into the mainly-Shiite Bekaa Valley and the south\n\nh) a Christian-Muslim population exchange between the newly formed French mandates of Lebanon and Syria in the early 1920s (at the same time that the Christians and Muslims have a population exchange between Greece and Turkey)\n\ni) a different National Pact in 1943 from reality\n\nj) being a firm ally of Israel\n\nk) somehow beating all the odds that Lebanon already had against it even in the 1920s-1950s, sort of like how the emergence (and sustainability) of the State of Israel in 1948 was an upset victory that required many multiple points of divergence\n\nl) have the legacy of Fouad Chehab, who - as president from 1958 to 1964 - promoted a strong sense of Lebanese nationality as such and encouraged unity among all Lebanese of different faiths, continue - though my take on that is that having immediate successors continue his legacy might just have pushed off the inevitable (first and foremost the long and bloody civil war) for 5-10 years if not sooner\n\nm) many fewer Palestinian refugees move to Lebanon than in reality, and preferably only Palestinian Christians\n\nn) the PLO doesn't move its headquarters to Beirut from Amman in 1970, but instead to another Arab capital\n\nA combination of choices is acceptable, though preferably the fewer the better.\n\nWe visited Lebanon in '74, just after the YK War and just before the civil war. I was just a kid then. What I remember:\n\nBeirut was beautiful. Clean, nice beaches, worldly people.\n\nWe engaged a driver for our stay. One day he took us to the local souk. As we were walking around, we heard a couple of loud bangs. Our driver just smiled at us and said \"That's the Israelis. They fly over now and then and remind us who's boss\".\n\nWe also toured the south of the country. Near the border, there were signs basically saying \"You're under Israeli observation here. Do not stop\". In one area you could still see the wrecks of Syrian vehicles, in the distance.\n\nI was interested in archaeology at the time. We toured the old Roman ruins in Baalbek, in the eastern part of the country. Really interesting.\n\nOverall, very positive experience. We were saddened when we heard of the outbreak of the civil war and saw the pictures."
