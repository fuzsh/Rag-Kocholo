        "text": "What image do you have in your mind when you think of the capital of Lebanon – Beirut?\n\nI bet the majority of you think of the dangerous, war torn country that now is flooded with refugees and garbage.\n\nThat’s the stereotype we hear about Lebanon and that’s what the media tell us. (Side note: many people wonder what is the capital of Lebanon anyway, not knowing it’s actually Beirut…)\n\nEven if I always half believe in what we see in the news this time I fell for the rumors and had a mini panic attack before my trip to visit Beirut, at some point I even started reconsidering this whole journey.\n\nBut as it turned our Beirut was nothing that I imagined! Visiting Beirut was a really interesting and eye-opening experience for me!\n\nSo how is the capital of Lebanon (at least in my eyes)?\n\nOf course I’m not an expert here, I’ve only spent one week visiting Beirut and only seen couple of areas of the Lebanon capital (Gemmayze where I’ve stayed, Downtown, Hamra just to name few) but it was enough to show me how wrong I was in my expectations.\n\nMost of all Beirut (and Lebanon) turned out to be really safe! Yet another lesson I’ve learnt from my travels.\n\nThe worst thing about visiting Beirut is crazy traffic\n\nOK, that’s the only thing I actually expected before visiting Beirut.\n\nI was lucky as I arrived on Sunday, it was the 1st of May weekend, so the city was less hectic than usual and I could remind myself how to deal with crazy drivers in the Middle East.\n\nAfter spending a few days in the Lebanon capital I kind of had nightmares with beeping cars!\n\nBut also I quickly started playing by their rules. I was crossing the street at the red light, I was navigating easily between the driving cars, I somehow managed to cross the road.\n\nI figured that the key to success there is to look confident (and it doesn’t matter if you’re shaking inside).\n\nI even got used to the drivers not caring about the red light and stopping in the middle of the crossing (if at all).\n\nMy only problem in Beirut were scooters – their drivers don’t follow any rules at all and it doesn’t matter if it’s a one way street, they will go in the wrong direction.\n\nSo many times I was this close to getting hit by a scooter…\n\nBeirut, Lebanon capital, is modern\n\nThe cruel civil war in Lebanon ended only in 1990.\n\nWhen you google pictures from the time of the conflict you will see images similar to what Warsaw after World War 2 or Syria these days looked like.\n\nThat’s why I’m not really surprised people still kind of expect to see a battlefield when visiting Beirut.\n\nBut the capital of Lebanon was rebuilt very quickly and in a modern manner.\n\nThe downtown and the seaside area are full of skyscrapers, some of them being a masterpiece of the modern architecture.\n\nThe city seems to be still under construction, on every second street new tall buildings are being worked on.\n\nThe area of downtown close to the clock tower and the parliament reminded me a little bit of the Northern Avenue in my favorite Yerevan, Armenia – all made up and modern but soulless.\n\nThen the sea promenade looked much like I imagine Tel Aviv to be: high buildings, trendy people, something going on for all the time.\n\nBeirut definitely looks much different than I’ve thought it’d be.\n\nI was expecting a city similar to Amman, a crazy Middle East capital, yet I got a modern Mediterranean metropolis.\n\nBeirut is wealthy\n\nI’m not saying I was expecting a poor city with crumbling houses but I definitely didn’t expect this level of wealth.\n\nThe majority of the cars on the road are really good ones (and most have dark windows too), the downtown is full of fancy shops of world famous designers.\n\nThe souk is where you will find most of these shops – the place is busy with people, the whole families (including African / Asian help) hang out there, spending lots and lots of money.\n\nApparently it’s completely normal to have the help from developing countries here, even if very often there’s a dark story behind.\n\nWhen I arrived to Beirut I witnessed an interesting scene at the airport: a big group of African women probably from Ethiopia (as the flights was from Addis Abeba) arrived and local wealthy families were waiting for them, after the paper work was done each woman could leave with their new employers.\n\nTo be honest it looked a little bit disturbing to me…\n\nOf course Beirut has poor areas too, every city has them, but overall I didn’t expect to see such a wealthy city!\n\nBeirut is multicultural\n\nAgain, my mistake for not preparing myself properly before I got to visit Beirut.\n\nI was expecting a rather homogenous society, with a Muslim majority as that’s the image we mostly get in the media.\n\nAnd even if I knew that the civil war, to simplify, was between western (Muslim) and eastern (Christian) part of the city, even if I knew there’s a significant Armenian Diaspora living in Beirut I still didn’t make any conclusion out of it.\n\nAnd then I was almost jaw dropping surprised when I saw a mosque neighboring with catholic cathedral, with Armenian and Orthodox churches within the eyesight.\n\nWhen walking around Gemmayze or Mar Mikhael I’ve spotted numerous small shrines, showing St. Mary, Jesus and various saints. They were literally on every street.\n\nThe multicultural face of Beirut can be also seen in the local food scene.\n\nNot only you can eat amazing Lebanese food (which I believe is one of the best cuisines in the world) but you have so many other delicious options to choose from.\n\nAnd everything is at the very high level, the best you can ask for!\n\nThe capital of Lebanon is tolerant\n\nOr at least so it seems.\n\nAfter all after the horrible experience of civil war that ended a little bit over 20 years ago it must be difficult to live in somehow peaceful atmosphere. Yet Beirut manages it, at least on the surface.\n\nThe downtown is the epicenter of religions coexisting that paints a perfect image of tolerant Beirut.\n\nBut when you look closer at the neighborhoods you can notice that they are divided by the religion, Bourj Hamoud being the Armenian one, Gemmayze – Christian and Hamra Muslim.\n\nIt doesn’t take much research, just careful looking around at the buildings and people and you can figure it out.\n\nBut still, despite the tragic past, caused mostly be the religious differences, these days people can live together next to each other without too much tension.\n\nAnd in the places like the Corniche all these cultures mingle, creating an interesting mix of people of Beirut.\n\nBeirut is progressive\n\nOf all the Middle East cities I’ve visited Beirut was the most progressive one, or at least that was the impression I got.\n\nIt was the best seen in the outfits of people around, many of the young inhabitants of Beirut barely wore any clothes on, and that was just fine.\n\nModest Muslims passing them by didn’t give them reproachful looks, they were used to such freedom.\n\nThe party scene of Beirut is pretty epic as well.\n\nIn the day the Armenia street – the main artery of Mar Mikhael – is a hectic yet rather sleepy place but come the evening and it turns into the major nightlife hub.\n\nIt’s hard to believe this is actually the same place where nothing was going on just few hours before!\n\nBeirut nightlife is considered one of the best in the region and the party areas of the city change constantly.\n\nPreviously it was Hamra, then Gemmayze. These days it’s Mar Mikhael but there’re already bets what will be next.\n\nBeirut is chic\n\nI’m very far from being the fashion victim and usually I don’t care about the clothes at all. But there were moments in Beirut (pretty many of them actually) when I really felt underdressed.\n\nThe wealth and designer shops really have an impact on people of Beirut as the places like the souk or Corniche felt like runways.\n\nNot something you’d expect from the recently war torn country!\n\nBeirut is cool\n\nI found Beirut to be a cool and rather alternative place to visit.\n\nThe cafe scene is thriving, the street art is booming and the vibe is too cool to describe.\n\nThis is especially seen in Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael, currently the trendiest neighborhoods of Beirut.\n\nWander around the streets of these districts, without any plan or map, and you will see what I’m talking about.\n\nEvery single corner hides some wonders, whether it is a cool street art, a small shrine, a charming cafe, a small craft store or an independent art gallery.\n\nI was lucky to stay there too, in probably the coolest place in Beirut -Saifi Urban Garden.\n\nBesides accommodation they also offer school of Arabic language, a rooftop nightclub and a cafe with awesome yet affordable food, probably your best choice when you visit Beirut.\n\nIf you want to experience the coolest that Beirut has to offer this is the place to go (even if you’re staying somewhere else you need to visit Saifi Urban Gardens!).\n\nBeirut is artistic\n\nNot only the walls of Beirut are full of street art.\n\nThe city is full of art galleries, most of them of independent and contemporary pieces.\n\nI can’t recall any other city I’ve visited that would have so many decent galleries to visit.\n\nThey are spread all over the city, it’s not easy to get to some of them (though really worth it) and if you’d like to visit only the best ones you’d still need at least few days to only fully explore the local art scene.\n\nBeirut is amazing\n\nI guess it’s pretty obvious by now that I really enjoyed my time visiting Beirut and found it to be simply an amazing place.\n\nThe city took me by surprise and I loved almost every single moment I’ve spent there.\n\nI had pretty high expectations of the capital of Lebanon and I was slightly afraid the city will disappoint me but there was really nothing to worry about. Beirut was simply amazing.\n\nOK, sometimes it was overwhelming too (like the time when I didn’t manage to get to the bus stop to go for a day out of the city) but that’s how the Middle East is supposed to be.\n\nEven if I spent a week in Beirut and walked like crazy just about everywhere I limited myself only to some parts of the city.\n\nNot because I wanted to but because it was a wise thing to do.\n\nThe news and warning we get aren’t made up and Beirut, as well as whole Lebanon, is dealing with a lot of problems these days.\n\nBut if you stick to the awesome areas of Gemmayze, Mar Mikhael, Achrafieh, Downtown, Hamra and Corniche you will be more than fine and I’m sure you will enjoy Beirut as much as I did!\n\nFor the end I left a few announcements that might interest you:\n\nIf you don’t want to miss new posts and news from me click here to sign to my newsletter!
