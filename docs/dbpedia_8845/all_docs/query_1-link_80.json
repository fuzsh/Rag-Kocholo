        "text": "Over the years Lebanon has faced a myriad of crises. Since 2011, 1.5 million refugees have arrived in Lebanon, inevitably adding pressure on already overstretched public services and resources, particularly affecting urban areas where the majority have settled. The COVID-19 outbreak in Lebanon, a severe and deepening economic depression and currency devaluation since 2019, and the effects of the Beirut Port explosions in mid-2020 have together driven an overwhelming 74 per cent of the population into income poverty in 2021, up from 25 per cent in 2019.\n\nAdditionally the late 2019 civil uprising and mass protests against economic stagnation and perceived government corruption erupted in cities across the country, with the onset at that time of what has since emerged as a banking system crisis and devastating local currency devaluation.\n\nMore than ever, there is an urgent need to address disparities in Lebanon – where nearly 90 per cent of its population lives in urban areas – and to uphold people’s human rights to housing, water, sanitation and other essential services and resources.\n\nThe years 2015 & 2016 have, and will witness two major events: the endorsement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Sustainable Urban Development Conference - Habitat III. Both are expected to shortly achieve positive impacts on the lives of people worldwide, especially on poor and vulnerable groups.\n\nOn 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled ”Transforming our world”. 17 Sustainable Development Goals were adopted with a will that each government with its relevant partners and actors will be working on achieving the identified targets under each SDG.\n\nGoal 11 of the SDGs states that cities and human settlements should become inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The 10 targets set under this goal imply exceptional efforts and collective work in order to be achieved by 2030. This involves amongst others, ensuring access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, sustainable transport systems, road safety, enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, protecting cultural and natural heritage, etc.\n\nThe Habitat III conference that will be organized by the United Nations in October 2016 in Quito – Ecuador, will endorse the “New Urban Agenda” which should be implemented by all governments in the coming 20 years.\n\nUN-Habitat, globally, and at the regional and country levels, will be aligning its strategies, programmes and action plans to become consistent with the targets of SDG 11 and with the recommendations of the New Urban Agenda.\n\nIn Lebanon, with the absence of a national urban policy and urban planning actors, the Country Programme will have to devote enormous efforts to lobby, promote, and implement programs and interventions that will contribute to achieving the targets of Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda.\n\nThe Country Programme Document that will be prepared shortly, and which will reflect the strategy and planning of UN-Habitat Lebanon for the coming 5 years, will clearly indicate the planned activities, the adopted approaches, and proposed strategies, and their link in achieving SDG 11 and the New Urban Agenda.\n\nTarek Osseiran\n\nUN-Habitat Lebanon\n\nUN-Habitat Partners\n\nDonors\n\nThe Government of Finland\n\nThe Government of Netherlands\n\nThe Government of Cyprus\n\nEuropean Union (EU)\n\nThe Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nSwiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)\n\nUN Agencies\n\nUnited Nations Development Program (UNDP)\n\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\n\nUnited Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF)\n\nUN-Women\n\nNational Government\n\nMinistry of Social Affairs\n\nMinistry of Public Health\n\nMinistry of Energy and Water\n\nMinistry of Education and High Education\n\nMinistry of Interior\n\nLocal Authorities\n\nMunicipality of Beirut\n\nUnion of Municipalities\n\nNational and International Organizations\n\nCouncil for Development and Reconstruction (CDR)\n\nAmerican University of Beirut (AUB)\n\nWorld Vision\n\nDevelopment for People and Nature Association (DPNA)\n\nMakassed Philanthropic association\n\nYoung Men’s Christian Association (YMCA)\n\nLebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee (LPDC)"
