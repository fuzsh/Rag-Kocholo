        "text": "Only daughter of Augustus (by Scribonia), was born in 39 bc and betrothed in 37 to Marcus Antonius Antyllus, son of Mark Antony and Fulvia. She was brought up strictly by her father and stepmother Livia Drusilla. In 25 she married her cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus and in 21 Marcus Agrippa, to whom she bore Gaius Julius Caesar and Lucius Julius Caesar, Julia, Vipsania Agrippina, and Agrippa Julius Caesar (Agrippa Postumus). Her third marriage, to Tiberius (in 11) is said to have been happy at first, but estrangement followed, and her behaviour may have contributed to Tiberius' decision to retire from Rome in 6. In 2 bc Augustus learned of her alleged adulteries (e.g. with Iullus Antonius, second son of Mark Antony and Fulvia, and banished her to Pandateria; in ad 4 she was allowed to move to Rhegium. Scribonia voluntarily shared her exile. Augustus forbade her burial in his mausoleum, and Tiberius kept her closely confined and stopped her allowance, so that she died of malnutrition before the end of ad 14. Macrobius (Sat. 2. 5) speaks of her gentle disposition and learning, and gives anecdotes attesting her wit.\n\nTheodore John Cadoux; Robin J. Seager"
