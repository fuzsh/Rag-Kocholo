        "text": "Author: * Xtreemli Curius - 6 on this thread out of 1,547 sitewide.\n\nDate: May 12, 2006 - 02:58\n\nJulia The Elder~ I, Claudius Project.\n\nKnown to her contemporaries as Julia Caesaris filia or Julia Augusti filia (PIR2 I 634) (October 39 BC - 14 AD) and widely referred to today as Julia the Elder, she was the daughter and only natural child of Caesar Augustus (Octavian). Augustus subsequently adopted several male members of his close family as sons. Julia resulted from Augustus' second marriage with Scribonia, her birth occurring on the same day as Scribonia's divorce by Augustus who wished to marry Livia Drusilla.\n\nJulia's childhood was far from happy. Almost as soon as she was born, she was taken from her biological mother, whom Augustus divorced the very same day. In accordance with Roman custom, Augustus claimed complete parental control over her. Once she became old enough, she was sent to live with her step-mother, Livia, where she underwent the education as an aristocratic Roman girl. Augustus desired that Julia should be exemplary, and so her education was strict and somewhat dated for the times. As well as her studies, Suetonius informs us she was taught spinning and weaving (Suetonius Vita Augusti 64). Macrobius mentions \"her love of literature and considerable culture, a thing easy to come by in that household\" (Saturnalia 2.5.1-10).\n\nHer social life was severely controlled, and she was only allowed to talk to people whom her father had vetted (Vita Augusti 64). However, Julia must have been a very attractive child, and she was the subject of much attention from many people. Augustus showed great affection for his daughter and made sure she had the best teachers.\n\nDaughter of Octavian: The career of Octavian progressed steadily after Julia's birth. In 37 BC, during the time his daughter's infancy, Octavian's friends, Gaius Maecenas and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, concluded a deal with Marc Antony. The deal was sealed with an engagement - Antony's ten year old son, Marcus Antonius Antyllus, was to marry Julia, who was now two years old. The engagement never led to a marriage as civil war broke out. In 31 BC, at the Battle of Actium, Octavian and Agrippa defeated Antony and Cleopatra, who both committed suicide.\n\nAs with most aristocratic Roman women of the period, the career of Julia focused squarely on her successive marriages and family alliances. She had two failed alliances, first with Antyllus, son of Marcus Antonius, and second with Cotiso (M. Antonius scribit primum eum Antonio filio suo despondisse Iuliam, dein Cotisoni Getarum regi, Suetonius, LXIII, Life of Augustus). Like many Roman girls, she was married off in her early teens. Macrobius records a remark by Augustus: \"There are two wayward daughters that I have to put up with - the Roman commonwealth and Julia.\" (Saturnalia 2.5)\n\nFirst marriage: In 25 BC, at the age of fourteen, Julia married her cousin, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who was some three years older. Julia's father was not present: he was fighting a war in Spain and had fallen ill. Agrippa presided over the ceremony. There were rumors that Marcellus had been chosen as Augustus' successor. Marcellus organized splendid games sponsored by the emperor himself. Yet Marcellus died in September 23 BC, when Julia was but sixteen. The union produced no children."
