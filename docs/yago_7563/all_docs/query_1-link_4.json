The marriage was not happy, as Tiberius was forced to divorce his previous wife whom he loved, and Julia was frequently unfaithful and cheated on him.\n\nI cannot find the exact date in which Tiberillus was born, but it was between 11 BC and 6 BC (when Tiberius left for Rhodes).

He could change Rome's early Imperial History quite a bit by butterflying the reigns of both Caligula and Claudius. Could be a very interesting TL..."
