        "text": "Julia the Elder, the only legitimate biological child of Augustus (which makes her the daughter of the son of god), was definitely hot stuff. She had what you might politely call “a reputation”.\n\nWe don’t know much about Julia’s childhood or early teenage years. But by her late teens she had become a popular figure in Roman society. How did she feel about getting married to her father’s best friend, a man she’s known since her birth? Whatever she thought, she quickly bore him two sons. I’m sure it’s all going to work out well for those boys.\n\n[powerpress]\n\nHOW TO LISTEN\n\nIf you’re seeing this message, it means you aren’t logged in as a subscriber.
