        "text": "\"Half of what I say is meaningless.\"\n\nSuch a perfect lyric for Julia the Elder:\n\nThe most impactful woman that time forgot. Who 2059 years ago on the 30th of October was born to Augustus and Scribonia, before Augy would leave her mother for a young married woman named Livia, Julia Agusta. Mother to her future husband.\n\nHaving already read a thorough and knowledgeable write up by a very trusted peer (how didn't this one get featured???): https://www.cointalk.com/threads/wo...hrough-experiences-of-julia-the-elder.371673/\n\nI've no need to reinvent the principate.\n\nWith her possibly being my favorite Julia, I felt it worth a mention.\n\nBeing Augustus' only child and wife to the man behind the mask, Agrippa... and Tiberius. And throw in that she was Caligula's gammy.\n\nThis makes her one of the most impactful women in history, that barely anyone knows of:\n\nPosthumous Coinage of Augustus\n\nLivia and Julia under Augustus. Bronze\n\n10-2 BC, Pergamum/Mysia. LIBIAN\n\nHPAN XAPINOS Draped bust of Livia\n\n(as Hera) to r. Rev.( IO)YLIAN\n\n(AFP)ODIT(HN) Draped bust of Julia\n\n(as Venus)! to r 18 mm,. 3,79 g. BMC\n\n248. RPC 2359. Vagi 370248. Very rare\n\nJulia Daughter of Augustus by his first\n\nwife Scribonia. Born 39 BC, she was the\n\nwife of Marcellus, Agrippa and Tiberius,\n\nrespectively. Banished by her father to\n\nthe island of Pandataria in 2 BC, she\n\nremained there 5 years and then was\n\nallowed to reside in Rhegium, where\n\nshe died in 14 AD.\n\nDad:\n\nStepmother:\n\nHubbies:\n\nGrandson:\n\nAnd on and on we could go with the world shaking and ruling relations she had until Nero killed the rest of the Julio-Claudian line and himself.\n\nAs with all of the ancient scandalous stories of sexual depravity from the Augustas, that lord I wish were true, we have to take it all with a huge grain of salt. Look at who the sources were and served at the time they wrote their versions of history.\n\nPlease share your coins of hers, her kin, thoughts or anything that shakes Augustus to his core!"
