        "text": "Julia Augusta Livia, the daughter of Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, was born on 30 January 58 BC.\n\nIn 42 BC, her father married her to Tiberius Claudius Nero. Her father committed suicide in the Battle of Philippi, but her husband continued fighting against Augustus, now on behalf of Mark Antony and his brother. In 40 BC, the family was forced to flee Italy.\n\nA general amnesty was announced, and Livia returned to Rome, where she was personally introduced to Augustus in 39 BC. At this time, Livia already had a son, the future emperor Tiberius, and was pregnant with Drusus the Elder. Octavian fell in love with her, despite the fact that he was still married to Scribonia. Octavian divorced Scribonia in 39 BC and Tiberius Claudius Nero was forced to divorce Livia. Octavian and Livia married on 17th January. Her second child was born three days later.\n\nLivia was an extremely intelligent woman who had a great influence on how Augustus ran the Roman Empire. From their surviving letters, it is clear that Augustus listened very carefully to what she had to say. Many Roman politicians resented Livia's political power and this is probably why Roman historians tend to say unpleasant things about her.\n\nAfter her marriage to Augustus, Livia did not have any more children. Augustus chose Tiberius, Livia's son by her first marriage, to become the next emperor. As part of the deal, Tiberius had to marry Augustus' daughter Julia. Tiberius, who was already happily married, objected but eventually agreed to accept the orders of Augustus.\n\nAugustus died in AD 14, (the month that he died, Sextilis, was then changed to August). Augustus was one of the most outstanding leaders the world has ever known. In the fifty years of his rule, he completely reformed the Roman Empire, and in doing so, made it so strong that the system he installed lasted for hundreds of years. Although he had taken much of their power away, the Senate recognised his greatness and within a month of his death declared him to be a god.\n\nLivia died in AD 29."
