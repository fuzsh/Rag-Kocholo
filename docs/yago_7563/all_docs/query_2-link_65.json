She was the daughter of the Egyptian Greek Thrasyllus of Mendes otherwise Tiberius Claudius Thrasyllus, and a Greek Princess, Aka II of Commagene, who was granddaughter or great-granddaughter of Antiochus I Theos of Commagene. Her father was an Alexandrian grammarian, editor of Plato and Democritus, and a noted astrologer, who became a friend to Tiberius. Eunia married the Praetorian prefect Naevius Sutorius Macro, appointed to replace Sejanus in 31AD. Through Macro’s position, Macro and Eunia gained considerable influence. Sometime in 38AD, they fell out of favour with Caligula and both committed suicide.\n\nBookFourXII She was reputedly seduced by Caligula.\n\nBookFourXXVI Condemned by Caligula.\n\nEnnius, or Quintus (c. 239BC - c. 169BC) was a writer during the period of the Roman Republic, and is often considered the father of Roman poetry. He was of Calabrian descent born at Rudiae, a Messapian town near Lecce. Here the Messapian, Greek, Oscan, and Latin languages were in contact with one another. Ennius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing praetextae, tragedies, and palliatae, as well as his most famous work, a historic epic called the Annales an epic poem in eighteen books, covering Roman history from the fall of Troy in 1184BC down to the censorship of Cato the Elder in 184BC. It was the first Latin poem to adopt the dactylic hexameter used in Greek poetry, which become a standard metre in Latin. The Annales became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by Virgil’s Aeneid. About 600 lines survive.\n\nBookTwoVI A quotation from the Annales, 155.\n\nBookThreeXXI Augustus adapts a line, Annales, 363, replacing cunctando with vigilando.\n\nEpaphroditus was a freedman and favourite of the Emperor Nero, and employed by him as a private secretary.\n\nBookSixXLIX He assisted Nero’s suicide.\n\nBookEightL Executed by Domitian.\n\nEpidius Marullus, Gaius, a tribune of the people was deposed from office by Caesar in 44BC, after removing a royal emblem from Caesar’s statue.\n\nBookOneLXXIX BookOneLXXX Mentioned.\n\nEsquiline, the Esquiline Hill is one of the Seven Hills of Rome.

It was a fashionable residential district.\n\nBookThreeXV Tiberius lived there prior to his accession.\n\nBookFourLIX The Lamian Gardens were located on the summit of the Esquiline, in the area around the present Piazza Vittorio Emanuele. They were originally the gardens of the consul Aelius Lamia, a friend of Tiberius, and by the time of Caligula were imperial property.\n\nBookFiveXXV The Esquiline Field occupied both sides of the Servian Wall, and was occupied in part by the Gardens of Maecenas. The place of execution was probably outside the Porta Esquilina.\n\nBookSixXXXI Nero’s Golden House, the Domus Aurea complex, covered parts of the slopes of the Palatine, Esquiline and Caelian hills.\n\nEthiopians are the inhabitants of Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa. The country is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, and Kenya to the south. A monarchy for most of its history, the Ethiopian dynasty traces its roots to the 10th century BC.\n\nBookOneLII The country mentioned.\n\nEtruria was a region of Central Italy, located in an area that covered parts of what now are Tuscany, Latium, Emilia-Romagna and Umbria. Its inhabitants were the Etruscans, whose isolate language Etruscan survives only in a few limited texts and in loan words to other languages. A few hundred individual words are understood with certainty.\n\nBookOneXXXIV Overrun by Caesar.\n\nBookTwoXCVII The word’ aesar’ in Etruscan meant ‘god’.\n\nBookFiveXLII Claudius wrote a twenty-volume Etruscan history.\n\nBookSevenXXIV Otho claimed descent from Etrurian princes.\n\nEunoe was the Moorish wife of Bogudes, King of Mauretania, and a mistress of Julius Caesar. She may have replaced Cleopatra in Caesar’s affections, when he arrived in North Africa prior to the Battle of Thapsus in 46BC.\n\nBookOneLII She reputedly had an affair with Julius Caesar.\n\nEuphorion was a Greek poet and grammarian, born at Chalcis in Euboea c. 275BC. He spent much of his life in Athens, where he amassed great wealth. About 221BC he assisted in creating the royal library at Antioch, and was librarian till his death. He wrote mythological epics, amatory elegies, epigrams and a satirical poem in the manner of the Ibis of Callimachus. Prose works on antiquities and history are also attributed to him. He was imitated or translated by Cornelius Gallus and also by Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeLXX One of Tiberius’s favourite poets.\n\nEuripides, (c. 480BC – 406BC) was the last of the three great tragedians of classical Athens (the other two being Aeschylus and Sophocles).\n\nBookOneXXX Quoted by Caesar.\n\nBookSixXXXVIII The quotation is believed to be from Euripides’ lost play Bellerephon.\n\nEutychus was a charioteer of the Greens in the arena, who was a favourite of Caligula.\n\nBookFourLV Caligula rewarded him with expensive gifts.\n\nEutychus was a peasant driving an ass, Nicon, their two names Prosper and Victor being an omen of Augustus’ victory at Actium.\n\nBookTwoXCVI Augustus set up statues to them to commemorate the prophecy.\n\nFabius Maximus, Africanus was the younger son of Quintus Fabius Maximus (consul 45BC). He was consul in 10BC and proconsul of Africa in 6/5BC.\n\nBookFiveII Claudius was born during his consulship.\n\nFalacrinae has been recently identified with modern Cittareale, 35km northeast of Rieti, near which an extensive villa has been excavated (2009), possibly Vespasian’s summer palace and the place where he died.\n\nBookEightII Vespasian’s birthplace.\n\nFannius Caepio was the senatorial leader of a plot against Augustus in 23BC, which failed.\n\nBookTwoXIX He was executed by Augustus in 22BC for conspiring against him.\n\nBookThreeVIII Tiberius prosecuted him on the treason charge in 23BC.\n\nFaunus was the Roman horned god of nature. He was equated in literature with the Greek god Pan. Faunus was one of the oldest Roman deities, known as the di indigetes. According to Virgil, he was a king of the Latins who came with his people from Arcadia. His shade was consulted as a god of prophecy under the name of Fatuus, with oracles in the sacred grove of Tibur, around the well Albunea, and on the Aventine Hill.\n\nBookSevenXXXVI King of the Aborigines.\n\nFavonius, Marcus (c. 90BC – 42BC) was noted for his imitation of Cato the Younger, and his espousal of the Cynic philosophy. With Cato’s support he was chosen aedile around 52BC, and was later quaestor and legatus in Sicily. Cassius Dio wrote that Favonius ‘imitated Cato in everything’ while Plutarch wrote that Favonius ‘…supposed his own petulance and abusive manner of speech a copy of Cato’s directness’ Despite opposing Caesar, Favonius was not invited to participate in the assassination. After Caesar’s death Favonius opposed the Second Triumvirate, and was proscribed by them, and imprisoned, and subsequently killed, after Philippi. Favonius’ slave Sarmentus became a catamite of Augustus. Sarmentus was the subject of Quintus Dellius’ complaint to Cleopatra that while he and other dignitaries were served sour wine by Antony in Greece, Augustus’ catamite was drinking Falernian in Rome.\n\nBookTwoXIII His imitation of Cato the Younger in everything.\n\nFavor was a leading mimic who wore the death-mask at Vespasian’s funeral.\n\nBookEightXIX His mockery of Vespasian’s stinginess.\n\nFelix, Marcus Antonius, was a freedman of Claudius, whom Claudius made Procurator of Judaea 52AD - 58AD, in succession to Ventidius Cumanus.

His first wife was princess Drusilla of Mauretania, his second also named Drusilla, was the daughter of the King of Judea, Herod Agrippa I.\n\nBookFiveXXVIII A favourite of Claudius’s.\n\nFerentiumwas a town in ancient Etruria. Later rebuilt by the Romans as Ferento, near Viterbo, it was razed and abandoned in 1172AD.\n\nBookSevenXXIV The home of Otho’s ancestors.\n\nBookEightIII The home of Flavius Liberalis.\n\nFidenae or Fidenes, home of the Fidenates, was an ancient town of Latium, situated about 8km north of Rome on the Via Salaria, which ran between it and the Tiber. As the Tiber was the border between Etruria and Latium, the left-bank settlement of Fidenae represented an extension of Etruscan presence into Latium. The site of the ancient town is probably on the hill on which lies the Villa Spada, though no traces of early buildings or defences are to be seen: pre-Roman tombs are to be found in the cliffs to the north. In 27AD, a wooden amphitheatre collapsed in Fidenae resulting in 20,000 dead out of a total probable audience of 50,000.\n\nBookThreeXL BookFourXXXI Mentioned.\n\nFlamen Dialis, was the high priest of Jupiter. The flamen dialis was one of three flamines maiores (of the fifteen flamines in total) serving the three gods of the Archaic Triad. According to tradition the flamines were forbidden to touch metal, ride a horse, or see a corpse. The office of flamen dialis, and the offices of the other flamines maiores, were created by Numa Pompilius, who himself performed many of the rites of the flamen dialis\n\nBookTwoXXXI Augustus revived the office, possibly in 11BC.\n\nFlavia Domitilla the Younger (c. 45AD – c.66AD) was the only daughter of Vespasian and Flavia Domitilla the Elder. At the age of fifteen, she was married to Quintus Petillius Cerialis, with whom she had a daughter, the later Christian saint Flavia Domitilla. She died before Vespasian became emperor in 69AD. She was later deified by her younger brother Domitian, who also bestowed the honorific title of Augusta upon her.\n\nBookEightIII Her birth mentioned.\n\nFlavia Domitilla was daughter of Domitilla the Younger by an unknown father, perhaps Quintus Petillius Cerialis. She married her cousin, the consul Titus Flavius Clemens, whom Domitian had executed. She herself was banished to Pandataria. Both apparently converted to Judaism, and Domitilla was subsequently claimed as a saint by the Catholic Church.\n\nBookEightLIII Her steward Stephanus was involved in the successful plot to kill Domitian.\n\nFlavia Domitilla, or Domitilla the Elder (d. before 69AD, perhaps c. 65AD) was the wife of the Roman Emperor Vespasian. She was a daughter of Flavius Liberalis, a quaestor’s clerk from Ferentium. Vespasian married her c. 38AD. She was the mother of Domitilla the Younger and of the emperors Titus and Domitian and died before Vespasian became Emperor.\n\nBookEightIII Mentioned.\n\nFlavia Julia Titi (64AD – 91AD) was the daughter of Titus and Marcia Furnilla. Titus offered her in marriage to his brother Domitian, who declined because of his infatuation with Domitia Longina. Later Julia married her second paternal cousin Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul in 82AD), brother to consul (95AD) Titus Flavius Clemens, who married her first cousin Flavia Domitilla. When her father and husband died, Domitian lived with her, though reconciled with Domitia. Julia died of what was rumoured to be a forced abortion. She was deified and her ashes later mingled with Domitian’s in the Temple of the Flavians, by her former nurse, Phyllis.\n\nBookEightXXIX BookEightLIII BookEightXLVIII Mentioned.\n\nBookEightXXX Titus conquered Jerusalem on her birthday, according to Suetonius. Traditionally the city was taken and the Second Temple destroyed on the 9th of Av in the Jewish Calendar, the 10th of August 70AD.\n\nFlavius, see Domitian, Titus, Vespasian\n\nFlavius Clemens was the son of Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 69AD), brother to Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 82AD) and a second cousin to Roman Emperors Titus and Domitian. Clemens married Flavia Domitilla (Vespasian’s granddaughter). He appears to have converted to Judaism, and is claimed as a saint by the Catholic Church.\n\nBookEightLI He was executed by Domitian. Flavius had two sons both named Titus Flavius, born c. 88AD and c. 90AD, who were educated by Quintilian. Domitian named them as his heirs, changing their former names and calling the one Vespasian and the other Domitian.\n\nFlavius Liberalis was of equestrian rank, from Ferentium (Ferento). A quaestor’s clerk, his daughter Flavia Domitilla married the future Emperor Vespasian.\n\nBookEightIII Mentioned.\n\nFlavius Petro, Titus was the paternal grandfather of the Emperor Vespasian. He married Tertulla (c. 40BC – after 9AD) and had a son Titus Flavius Sabinus.\n\nBookEightI A brief life given.\n\nFlavius Sabinus, Titus (c. 20BC - after 9AD) was the son of Flavius Petro and father of Vespasian and his brother Titus.

He served as legate in 43AD, during the Roman conquest of Britain under Claudius. He was consul suffectus in 47AD, Governor of Moesia from c. 53AD to 56AD, and served two terms as Prefect of Rome, 56AD - 60AD and 62AD - 69AD. In 69AD, the Year of the Four Emperors, as Vespasian’s forces advanced towards Rome, Sabinus was besieged on the Capitoline Hill before being killed.\n\nBookSevenL Vitellius bargained for his life with Flavius.\n\nBookEightI His birth.\n\nBookEightII His Senatorial rank.\n\nBookEightIV Vespasian mortaged his estates to him.\n\nBookEightXXXVII Domitian took refuge with Flavius in 69AD.\n\nFlavius Sabinus, Titus, was the son of Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul suffectus in 47AD). He was suffect consul in May and June 69AD and one of the generals who fought for Otho against Vitellius during the Year of the Four Emperors, although he submitted to Vitellius once Otho had been defeated. He was besieged with his father in the Capitol, but escaped when it was burnt down. He was a cousin of Domitian, who later executed him on a pretext.\n\nBookEightXLVI His death.\n\nFlavius Sabinus, Titus, the son of Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 69AD), and brother to Titus Flavius Clemens, was consul in 82AD. He married his paternal second cousin Julia Flavia.\n\nBookEightXLIX Mentioned as causing annoyance to Domitian.\n\nBookEightXLVIII Domitian seduced his wife Julia.\n\nFloralia. Also known as the Florifertum, the Floralia was the ancient festival dedicated to Flora, the goddess of flowers and vegetation. It was held on the IV Calends of May, April 27 to May 3, and symbolized the renewal of the cycle of life, marked with dancing, drinking, and flowers. These days were considered by the prostitutes of Rome to be their own. While flowers decked the temples, Roman citizens wore colorful clothing instead of the usual white, and offerings were made of milk and honey.\n\nBookSevenVI Galba ran the Games at the festival in AD20.\n\nFonteius Capito, Gaius, was the son of the father of the same name, who had been a friend of Mark Antony.

As governor of Lower Germany, he drove Julius Civilis, leader of the Batavians, to rebellion in 69AD. He was replaced by Vitellius under Galba.\n\nBookSevenXI Mentioned as a rival to Galba.\n\nFormiae, the modern Formia, is located halfway between Rome and Naples. Cicero was assassinated on the Appian Way outside the town in 43BC, and a tower-tomb traditionally claimed to be his still stands.\n\nBookSevenXLII Vitellius embezzled the town’s public revenues.\n\nForum: the Forum was located between the Palatine Hill and the Capitoline Hill. Citizens of the ancient city also referred to the location as the ‘Forum Magnum’. The oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located in or near the Forum. The Rostra was an oratorical platform originally in the Comitium adjoining the Forum, and moved by Caesar into the Forum when he had the area remodeled.\n\nBookOneX BookOneXXVI BookOneXXXIX BookOneLXXXIV BookTwoLXXII Mentioned.\n\nBookOneLXXXV The column of yellow Numidian marble was removed by the anti-Caesararian party almost immediately.\n\nBookTwoXXXI BookTwoLVI BookFiveXXXIII Augustus’ Forum was built between c. 20BC and 2BC when it was dedicated.\n\nBookTwoLXXVI The Regia was located in the Forum, and was originally the residence or headquarters of the Kings of Rome and later the office of the Pontifex Maximus, or high priest. It was restored in 36BC, in marble, by Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, on the original foundations.\n\nBookThreeVII Tiberius as a young man gave gladiatorial displays there.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula burned documents relating to accusations against his mother and brothers burnt there.\n\nBookFourXXII Caligula incorporated the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Forum into the Palace complex, as its vestibule.\n\nBookFiveXVIII Claudius accosted by a crowd there during the grain shortages.\n\nBookFiveXXV Claudius concluded treaties there, accompanied by sacrifice of a sow.\n\nBookSixXXV Nero’s triumphal procession passed through it on his return from Greece in 67AD.\n\nBookSixXLVII Nero hoped to deliver a plea for mercy from the Rostra.\n\nBookSevenL The Temple of Concord, dedicated to the Roman goddess Concordia, at the western end of the Forum was built in the 4th century BC as a symbol of peace after a period of civil war. It was restored 7AD - 10AD under Tiberius.\n\nBookEightIX The Forum of Vespasian and the Temple of Peace that dominated the complex was vowed by Vespasian in 71AD after the capture of Jerusalem and dedicated four years later.\n\nForum Appii is the modern Foro Appio, named for Appius Claudius Caecus builder of the Via Appia. It was an ancient post station on the Via Appia, 43 miles southeast of Rome.\n\nBookThreeII Mentioned.\n\nFucinus, the Fucine Lake (Lago Fucino or Lago di Celano) was a large lake in central Italy, stretching from Avezzano in the North West to Ortuccio in the South East, and touching Trassaco in the South West. It was drained in 1875.\n\nBookOneXLIV Caesar’s plans to drain the lake.\n\nBookFiveXX BookFiveXXXII Claudius attempted to drain the lake by digging a tunnel through Monte Salviano, with the effect perhaps of halving the sixe of the original lake.\n\nBookFiveXXI Claudius mounted a mock naval battle on the lake.\n\nFulvia Flacca Bambula (c. 83BC – 40BC), commonly referred to simply as Fulvia, was married to three of the best known Romans of her generation, Publius Clodius Pulcher, Gaius Scribonius Curio the Younger and Mark Antony. All three husbands were politically active tribunes, and supported Julius Caesar. Fulvia’s third and final marriage to Mark Antony took place in 47BC or 46BC, a few years after Curio’s death, though Cicero suggested that Fulvia and Antony had been in a relationship since 58BC. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised eight legions in Italy to fight for Antony against Octavian. Fulvia died of an unknown illness in exile in Sicyon, near Corinth. Her son Marcus Antonius Antyllus was executed by Octavian in Alexandria in 30BC. Her youngest child, Iullus Antonius, was spared by Octavian and raised from 40BC by Octavia the Younger.\n\nBookTwoXVII Her son Antyllus’ death.\n\nBookTwoLXII Her daughter Claudia, by Publius Clodius Pulcher married Octavian in 43BC.\n\nFundi, modern Fondi, is a city halfway between Rome and Naples, an important settlement on the Via Appia, In 338BC at the time of the Latin War, its inhabitants (together with those of nearby Formia) gained minor Roman citizenship status (civitas sine suffragio). After a failed attempt at revolt led by Vitruvius Vaccus (330BC), Fondi remained a Roman prefecture; later (188BC) it received full citizenship, with a government led by 3 aediles.\n\nBookThreeV BookFourXXIII Tiberius’ maternal grandmother, Aufidia, came from there.\n\nBookSevenIV Mentioned.\n\nBookSevenVIII Galba living there when appointed to Spain.\n\nFuries. In Greek mythology the three Erinyes or Eumenídes (literally the ‘Kindly Ones’), equivalent to the Dirae in Roman mythology, were Alecto (unceasing), Megaera (grudging), and Tisiphone (avenging), female chthonic deities of vengeance or supernatural personifications of the anger of the dead.\n\nBookSixXXXIV Nero was hounded by them after murdering his mother.\n\nFurius Camillus, Marcus (c. 446BC – 365BC) was a Roman soldier and statesman of patrician descent.

He instigated a revolt against Claudius in 42AD while governor of Dalmatia.\n\nBookFiveXIII BookFiveXXXV BookSevenXXIV His attempt at revolution.\n\nBookSevenXXV Otho born during his consulate.\n\nFurius Leptinus was a praetorian who fought in a gladiatorial contest.\n\nBookOneXXXIX Mentioned.\n\nGabinius, Aulus, was military tribune under Sulla and later his envoy to Mithradates VI. As tribune of the people in 67BC, he passed a law against the pirates, intended for Pompey’s use. He served under Pompey in the east and was made consul for 58BC by the Triumvirate, along with Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus. The consuls supported Clodius Pulcher against Cicero, and Gabinius received and exploited the rich province of Syria as his reward. He restored Ptolemy XII as king of Egypt and intervened in Judaea. He was prosecuted on his return and finally convicted of extortion, his enemy Cicero being forced by Pompey to defend him. He went into exile (54BC), was recalled by Caesar and fought for him in Illyria.\n\nBookOneL Caesar was reputed to have had an affair with his wife, Lollia.\n\nGabinius Secundus Cauchius, Publius, was a governor of Germania Inferior, who supposedly recovered the last of the three standards lost in the Teutoberg Forest disaster of 9AD.\n\nBookFiveXXIV Granted the surname Cauchius by Claudius after his conquest of a German tribe, the Cauchi.\n\nGades, ancient Gadir, modern Cadiz, in Spain, fell to Rome in 206BC, to forces under Scipio Africanus. Under the Romans, the city’s Greek name was modified to Gades and it flourished as a naval base. By the time of Augustus, Cadiz was home to more than five hundred equites (members of one of the two upper social classes), a concentration of notable citizens rivalled only by Padua and Rome itself. According to Greek legend, Gadir was traditionally founded by Hercules after performing his fabled tenth labor, the slaying of Geryon. One of the city’s notable features during antiquity was the temple (later the Heraklion) dedicated to the Phoenician god Melqart, who was associated with Hercules by the Greeks.\n\nBookOneVII Caesar saw the statue of Alexander the Great in the Heraklion there.\n\nGaius (Emperor) see Caligula\n\nGalba Caesar Augustus, Servius Sulpicius (3BC - 69AD) was Emperor for seven months, from 8 June 68AD until his assassination on 15 January 69AD. He was the first emperor of the Year of the Four Emperors. He came from a noble and wealthy family, but was unconnected either by birth or adoption with the first six Caesars. He became Praetor in 20AD and consul in 33AD; he earned a reputation in the provinces of Gaul, Germania, Africa and Hispania, for military ability, strictness and impartiality. On the death of Caligula, he refused to make a bid for the empire, and loyally served Claudius. For the first half of Nero’s reign he lived in retirement, until 61AD when Nero granted him the province of Hispania Tarraconensis.\n\nBookSixXXXII Galba recast the images of the Household Gods of Rome which Nero had melted down.\n\nBookSixXL Galba, born in December 3BC, did not reach 70 years old (or enter his seventy-first year) until December 68AD, which makes the Latin text, indicating the seventy-third as the year for Nero to beware of, suspect. Either Suetonius miscalculated or there is some other significance to the number.\n\nBookSixXLII BookEightVI His insurrection in Spain in 68AD.\n\nBookSixXLVII Nero considered throwing himself on Galba’s mercy during his last days.\n\nBookSixXLVIII Support for Galba from the army in Rome.\n\nBookSixXLIX His freedman Icelus.\n\nBookSevenII Suetonius’ life of Galba follows.\n\nBookSevenXX The Aurelian Way left Rome by the Aemilian Bridge and ran north-west to the coastal towns of Etruria. Galba’s gardens were somewhere on the right bank of the Tiber.\n\nBookSevenXXVII BookSevenXXVIII Otho initially supported his cause, and hoped to be adopted by him as his successor.\n\nBookSevenXXIX BookSevenXXXV Otho plans to overthrow him, and sends soldiers to kill him.\n\nBookSevenXXX Otho haunted by his shade, tries to propitiate Galba’s ghost.\n\nBookSevenXXXIII Otho anticipated a bloodless coup against him.\n\nBookSevenXLII He appointed Vitellius to Lower Germany in 68AD. The army there was disaffected towards Galba, and on the verge of mutiny. The army of Upper Germany subsequently gave Vitellius their allegiance also.\n\nBookSevenXLIV BookEightV Vitellius sent his army against Otho after the news of Galba’s assassination.\n\nBookSevenXLV Vitellius punished the Praetorian Guard for their disloyalty to Galba.\n\nBookEightV Galba was consul for a second time in 69AD.\n\nBookEightXVI Vespasian reinstated taxes that Galba had repealed.\n\nBookEightXXX Titus was sent to congratulate Galba on his accession but turned back on seeing the chaotic state of the empire.\n\nGaleria Fundana (c. 40AD – after 69AD) was the daughter of an ex-praetor and the second wife (c. 50AD) of Vitellius. Her son, Vitellius the Younger, who was renamed Germanicus by his father in 69AD, was killed during the Flavian Revolt, together with Vitellius himself. Galeria’s life was spared and Vespasian enabled her daughter Vitellia to marry well.\n\nBookSevenXLI Mentioned.\n\nGallius, Marcus, was a praetor (c. 44BC?) who fought for Antony at Mutina in 43BC.\n\nBookThreeVI He adopted Tiberius as his heir in his will.\n\nGallius, Quintus was a praetor, imprisoned, tortured and exiled by Augustus. Appian (Civil Wars, 95AD) says that he was brother to Marcus Gallius, who was serving with Antony, and that he had asked Augustus for a command in Africa.\n\nBookTwoXXVII Mentioned.\n\nGamala, or Gamla, was situated at the southern part of the Golan on a steep hill shaped like a camel’s hump, from which it derives its name. The city was founded as a Seleucid fort during the Syrian Wars (3rd century BC). It was annexed to the Hasmonean state under Alexander Jannaeus c. 81BC. Josephus Flavius, Commander of Galilee during the Jewish Revolt of 66AD, fortified Gamla as his main stronghold on the Golan. Josephus gives a description of the Roman siege and conquest of Gamla in 67AD by components of legions X Fretensis, XV Apollinaris and XV Macedonica, under Titus.\n\nBookEightXXIX Subjugated by Titus in 67AD.\n\nGaul is the Roman name for the region of Western Europe approximating present day France, Luxembourg and Belgium, but also sometimes including the Po Valley, western Switzerland, and the parts of the Netherlands and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. In English, the word Gaul may also refer to an inhabitant of that region although the expression may be used more generally for all ancient speakers of the Gaulish language (an early variety of Celtic).\n\nBookOneXXV Gaul was subdued by Caesar.\n\nBookFourXLVII Caligula’s Gallic allies.\n\nBookSixXL The Gallic rebellion of 67/68AD under Julius Vindex.\n\nGemonian Stairs. The stairs were steps leading from the Capitoline Hill down to the Forum. As viewed from the Forum, they were flanked by the Tabularium and Temple of Concord on the left, and the Mamertine Prison on the right, roughly coinciding with the modern Via di San Pietro in Carcere. It is believed the stairs were built some time before the rule of Tiberius (14AD – 37AD), as they are not mentioned in prior texts. The condemned were strangled before their bodies were bound and thrown down the stairs. Among those executed there were Sejanus, and the Emperor Vitellius.\n\nBookThreeLIII BookThreeLXI BookThreeLXXV Mentioned.\n\nBookSevenLII Vitellius was killed there in 69AD.\n\nGergovia, in Gaul, the chief town of the Arverni, is identified with Merdogne, now called Gergovie, a village located on a hill within the township of La Roche-Blanche, near Clermont-Ferrand, in south central France. Some walls and earthworks still survive from the pre-Roman Iron Age. The Battle of Gergovia, won by the Gauls, took place in 52BC, fought between the Roman Republic’s army, led by pro-consul Julius Caesar, and the Gallic forces led by Vercingetorix. The Gauls won the battle.\n\nBookOneXXV Mentioned as an example of a rare setback for Caesar.\n\nGermanicus, Julius Caesar (c. 16BC - 19AD) was was born in Lugdunum, Gaul (modern Lyon). At birth he was named either Nero Claudius Drusus after his father or Tiberius Claudius Nero after his uncle. He received the agnomen Germanicus, in 9BC, when it was posthumously awarded to his father in honour of his victories in Germania. Germanicus was the grandson-in-law and great-nephew of the Emperor Augustus, nephew and adoptive son of the Emperor Tiberius, father of the Emperor Caligula, brother of the Emperor Claudius, and the maternal grandfather of the Emperor Nero. He married his maternal second cousin Agrippina the Elder, a granddaughter of Augustus, between 5BC and 1BC. The couple had nine children. Two died very young; another, Gaius Julius Caesar, died in early childhood. The remaining six were: Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar, the Emperor Caligula, the Empress Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, and Julia Livilla. Augustus compelled Tiberius to adopt Germanicus as a son and name him as his heir. Upon this adoption, Germanicus’ name was changed to Germanicus Julius Caesar. He also became the adoptive brother of Tiberius’ natural son Drusus the Younger. Germanicus held several military commands, campaigning in Pannonia and Dalmatia. After Augustus’ death in 14AD, the Senate appointed Germanicus commander of the forces in Germania. After major campaigns which also resulted in the recovery of two of the three eagles lost in 9AD, Germanicus was then sent to Asia, where in 18AD he conquered Cappadocia and Commagene, turning them into Roman provinces. Germanicus died suddenly in Antioch, with Tiberius suspected in some quarters of involvement in his death. In 37AD, when Germanicus’ only remaining son, Caligula, became emperor, he renamed September Germanicus in honor of his father.\n\nBookTwoXXXIV BookFourVII BookSevenXXIV His children.\n\nBookTwoLXIV His marriage to Agrippina the Elder. He was the grandson of Octavia the Younger (his mother Antonia the Younger, was her daughter by Mark Antony)\n\nBookTwoCI He and his sons were named as heirs of the second degree in Augustus’ will.\n\nBookThreeXV BookFourIV BookFiveII His adoption by Tiberius in 4AD.\n\nBookThreeXXV BookFourXVIII The army in Germany mutinied in 14AD and Germanicus, as commander, quelled the uprising.\n\nBookThreeXXXIX BookThreeLII BookFourII His death in 19AD.\n\nBookThreeLIV BookThreeLV BookThreeLXI His sons.\n\nBookThreeLXXVI His son Caligula was named as co-heir in Tiberius’ will.\n\nBookFourI Suetonius gives a brief life of Germanicus.\n\nBookFourIII Suetonius gives a character description of Germanicus.\n\nBookFourV BookFourVI The grief at Germanicus’s death.\n\nBookFourVIII He was consul in 12AD when Gaius (Caligula) his son was born.\n\nBookFourX Caligula accompanied him to Syria in 19AD.\n\nBookFourXIII His memory was revered in Rome.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula renamed September ‘Germanicus’ after his father.\n\nBookFiveI BookFiveVII Brother of Claudius.\n\nBookFiveXI Claudius produced a Greek comedy of Germanicus’s in his honour.\n\nBookFiveXXVI His daughter Agrippina the Younger was the fourth wife of Claudius.\n\nBookFiveXXIX His daughter Julia Livilla was executed on Claudius’s orders.\n\nBookSixV His daughter Agrippina the Younger was also married to Domitius, the father of Nero by her.\n\nBookSevenXXXVII Publius Vitellius was on his staff and successfully prosecuted Piso for his murder.\n\nBookSevenXLIII Aulus Vitellius took the surname Germanicus.\n\nGesoriacum, modern Boulogne, probably also to be identified with Portus Itius, was known to the Romans also as Bononia, the major port connecting Britain to the Empire. Claudius used it as his base for the invasion of Britain, in AD43, and until 296AD it was the base of the Classis Britannica, the Channel Fleet.\n\nBookFiveXVII Claudius launched his campaign in Britain from there in 43AD.\n\nGlycias or Glicia, Marcus Claudius, was a freedman of Publius Claudius Pulcher, and nominated by him as dictator. The nomination was refused by the Senate.\n\nBookThreeII Mentioned.\n\nGlyco, was the physician who treated Vibius Pansa’s mortal wound.\n\nBookTwoXI He was arrested on suspicion of poisoning Pansa, though Brutus refused to believe it and wrote to Cicero accordingly.\n\nGracchi Brothers, Tiberius and Gaius Cracchus both served as tribunes Tiberius c. 133BC and Gaius c. 123BC. They attempted to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major patrician landholdings among the plebeians. After achieving some early success as tribunes, both were soon assassinated.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned.\n\nHadrian, Publius Aelius Hadrianus (as Emperor, Imperator Caesar Divi Traiani filius Traianus Hadrianus Augustus, and Divus Hadrianus after his apotheosis,) (76AD – 138AD) was the fourteenth emperor of Rome (from 117AD - 138AD), as well as a Stoic and Epicurean philosopher.\n\nBookTwoVI Suetonius gifted him a statuette of Augustus.\n\nHadrumetum was a Phoenician colony that pre-dated Carthage and stood on the site of modern-day Sousse, Tunisia. It was one of the most important communities within the Roman territory in North Africa because of its strategic location on the coast of the fertile Sahel region.\n\nBookEightIV Vespasian faced a riot there.\n\nHalotus (c. 30AD – c.80AD), a eunuch, served Claudius as taster and chief steward, and was a suspect in the murder of the latter by poison. Nero retained Halotus as chief steward and taster until his, Nero’s, death in 68AD. Shortly after Galba became Emperor, he granted Halotus a procuratorship.\n\nBookFiveXLIV Suspected of poisoning Claudius.\n\nBookSevenXV Honoured by Galba.\n\nHannibal (248BC – c. 182BC) was the leading Carthaginian commander in the Second Punic War, and one of the most talented military leaders in history. His father Hamilcar Barca had been the leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War. Hasdrubal was a younger brother.\n\nBookThreeII BookEightXLVI Mentioned.\n\nHarpocras was a freedman of Claudius.\n\nBookFiveXXVIII Claudius granted him special privileges.\n\nHasdrubal (d. 207BC) was Hamilcar Barca’s second son and a Carthaginian general in the Second Punic War. He was a younger brother of Hannibal.\n\nBookThreeII Defeated by Claudius Tiberius Nero at the Metaurus River in 207BC.\n\nHaterius, Quintus (d. 27AD) was father to consul Decimus Haterius Agrippa and grandfather to consul Quintus Haterius Antoninus. He was consul himself in 5BC. In 16AD, in the senate, he denounced the extravagance of senators.\n\nBookThreeXXIX Mentioned.\n\nHector, was a Trojan hero in Homer’s Iliad. Killed by Achilles, his body was dragged behind Achille’s chariot.\n\nBookThreeLII Tiberius jokingly refers to his death.\n\nBookSixXXII The young Nero refers to his death.\n\nHecuba was the wife of Priam in Homer’s Iliad. Hecuba was of Phrygian birth, her father being Dymas, and her mother Eunoë, who was said to be a daughter of Sangarius, god of the Sangarius River, the principal river of ancient Phrygia.\n\nBookThreeLXX The name of her mother was the subject of one of Tiberius’s questions to the grammarians.\n\nHelius was a freedman of Nero.\n\nBookSixXXIII Mentioned.\n\nHelvetii were a people of the Swiss plateau, between the Rhine River, the Jura Mountains, Lake Geneva and the Rhone River. They feature prominently in Caesar’s commentaries on the Gallic War, which describes his conquest of Gaul, beginning with the Helvetii.\n\nBookEightI Vespasian’s father was a banker among the Helvetii.\n\nHelvidius Priscus, Gaius was a Stoic philosopher and statesman, under the emperors from Nero to Vespasian. Like his father-in-law, Thrasea Paetus, he was distinguished for his ardent republicanism. During Nero’s reign he was quaestor of Achaea (Peloponnese) and tribune of the plebs (56AD); he restored peace in Armenia but his declared sympathy with Brutus and Cassius occasioned his banishment in 66AD. He was recalled to Rome by Galba in 68AD. As praetor elect he opposed Vitellius in the senate, and as praetor in 70AD opposed Vespasian. He was again banished, and afterwards executed. His life, by Herennius Senecio, caused its author’s death in the reign of Domitian.\n\nBookEightXV Exiled and executed under Vespasian.\n\nBookEightXLVI His eulogy by Junius Rusticus (Suetonius) or Herennius Senecio (Tacitus, Pliny).\n\nHelvidius Priscus the Younger, the son of Helvidius Priscus by his first marriage, and a friend of Tacitus and Pliny the Younger, became consul under Domitian but was executed c. 93AD.\n\nBookEightXLVI Executed by order of Domitian.\n\nHelvius Cinna, Gaius, was a poet of the late Roman Republic, a little older than the generation of Catullus and Licinius Calvus. His magnum opus Smyrna established his literary fame; a mythological epic poem focused on the incestuous love of Smyrna (or Myrrha) for her father Cinyras. Suetonius, Valerius Maximus, Appian and Dio Cassius all state that, at Julius Caesar’s funeral in 44BC, a certain Helvius Cinna was killed because he was mistaken for Cornelius Cinna, the conspirator. The last three writers mentioned above add that he was a tribune of the people, while Plutarch, referring to the affair, gives the further information that the Cinna who was killed by the mob was a poet. This suggests the identity of Helvius Cinna the tribune with Helvius Cinna the poet. Shakespeare adopted Plutarch's version of Cinna’s death in his Julius Caesar.\n\nBookOneLII He was apparently the author of a draft bill to give Caesar the right to marry anyone he chose for the purposes of begetting an heir.\n\nBookOneLXXXV Killed by the mob.\n\nHercules, the Greek mythological hero (Heracles), had a famous oracular temple, the Heraklion, at Cadiz (Gades), on the promontory which is now the island of Sancta Petri. The Roman historian Pomponio Mela claimed that Hercules’ remains were buried beneath the temple leading to its fame.\n\nBookOneVII Alexander the Great’s statue in Hercules’ temple in Cadiz. Caesar consulted the oracle there regarding his dream.\n\nBookTwoXXIX The Temple of Hercules and the Muses in the Circus Flaminius was erected by Marcus Fulvius Nobilior after his capture of Ambracia in 189BC.\n\nBookTwoLXXII BookFourVIII The Temple of Hercules Victor at Tibur (Tivoli) used by Augustus.\n\nBookFourXXXIV Caligula swears (mehercule) by the hero/god, with whom he identified.\n\nBookSixLIII Nero aspired to be his equal.\n\nBookEightXII There was an attempt to trace Vespasian’s origins to a companion of Hercules.\n\nHermogenes of Tarsus was apparently a historian at the time of Domitian, not to be confused with the later rhetorician who flourished under Marcus Aurelius.\n\nBookEightXLVI Executed by Domitian.\n\nHiempsal II was King of Numidia, the son of Gauda, the half-brother of Jugurtha. In 81BC Hiempsal was driven from his throne by the Numidians themselves, or by Hiarbas, ruler of part of the kingdom, supported by Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, leader of the Marian party in Africa. Soon afterwards Pompey was sent to Africa by Sulla to reinstate Hiempsal. It is evident from the reference below that Hiempsal was alive in 62BC.\n\nBookOneLXXI Caesar protects Masintha from the king.\n\nHilarion was a freedman secretary of Augustus.\n\nBookTwoCI He helped transcribe Augustus’ last will in 13AD.\n\nHipparchus was a wealthy client of the lawyer Salvius Liberalis.\n\nBookEightXIII Mentioned.\n\nHirtius, Aulus (c. 90BC - 43BC) was a legate of Caesar’s from 54BC and served as an envoy to Pompey in 50BC. During the Civil Wars he served in Spain, and in 47BC was at Antioch. He was a praetor in 46BC and governor of Transalpine Gaul in 45BC. Hirtius and Pansa became consuls in 43BC. Initially a supporter of Mark Antony, Hirtius was successfully lobbied by Cicero (a personal friend) and switched allegiance to the senatorial party. He then attacked Antony who was besieging Mutina. In concert with Pansa and Octavian, Hirtius forced Antony to retire but was killed in the fighting He was honored with a public funeral, along with Pansa who died a few days later. Hirtius added an eighth book to Caesar’s De Bello Gallico and is probably the author of De Bello Alexandrino. The ancients thought he also wrote the De Bello Africo and De Bello Hispaniensis, but it is now considered more likely that he acted as an editor. Hirtius’ correspondence with Cicero was published in nine books, but has not survived.\n\nBookOneLVI His authorship of some of Caesar’s memoirs.\n\nBookTwoX His death at Mutina.\n\nBookTwoXI Claims that Augustus killed him, during the battle.\n\nBookTwoLXVII Augustus accused of unnatural acts with him.\n\nBookThreeV His consulship in 43BC.\n\nHomer (8th century BC) was an Ionian Greek poet, the presumed author of the Iliad and Odyssey.\n\nBookTwoLXV The quotation is from Iliad 3:40.\n\nBookThreeXXI The quotation is from Iliad 10:246.\n\nBookFourXXII The first quotation is from Iliad 2:204. The second, spoken by Ajax to Odysseus in their wrestling match, is from Iliad 23:724.\n\nBookFourXXXIV Caligula considered banning his works, out of envy and malice.\n\nBookFiveXLII The line is a partial quotation from Iliad 24:369, which is identical with Odyssey: 21:133.\n\nBookSixXLVII Nero’s favourite crystal drinking cups were engraved with scenes from Homer’s verse.\n\nBookSixXLIX The quotation is from Iliad 10:535.\n\nBookSevenXX The line is a partial quotation from Iliad 5:254 which is identical with Odyssey 21:426\n\nBookEightXXIII The quotation is from Iliad 7:213.\n\nBookEightXLIX The quotation is from Iliad 2:204.\n\nBookEightLIV The quotation is from Iliad 21:108.\n\nHortensius Hortalus, Quintus (114BC - 50BC), was a Roman orator and advocate. Having served during two campaigns (90BC - 89BC) in the Social War, he became quaestor in 81BC, aedile in 75BC, praetor in 72BC, and consul in 69BC. After Pompey’s return from the East in 61BC, Hortensius withdrew from public life and devoted himself to his profession. In 50BC, the year of his death, he successfully defended Appius Claudius Pulcher when accused of treason and corrupt practices by Publius Cornelius Dolabella, afterwards Cicero’s son-in-law.\n\nBookTwoLXXII Augustus acquired Hortensius’ house on the Palatine.\n\nBookThreeXLVII Mentioned.\n\nHortensius Hortalus, Marcus was the grandson of the orator. He was supported in maintaining a Senator’s rank by Augustus.\n\nBookThreeXLVII He was pleading poverty again, under Tiberius, in 16AD.\n\nHylas, a pantomimic actor who exceeded the licence allowed his profession and was punished by Augustus. Pantomimics wore masks, were silent, and used only gesture and movement in performance. The accompanying story text was sung by a singer, or chorus, or accompanied by a flute.\n\nBookTwoXLV Mentioned.\n\nIcarus, in Greek mythology was the son of Daedalus. His father made wax wings for him, but he attempted to fly too near the sun, fell into the sea, and was drowned.\n\nBookSixXII The myth was enacted at Nero’s entertainment.\n\nIcelus, Marcianus, was a freedman of Galba’s arrested by Nero on news of Galba’s rebellion but then freed. He agreed to the arrangements for Nero’s cremation before carrying the news of the Emperor’s suicide to Galba in Spain, as well as the news of the Senate and army’s endorsement of Galba for the succession. He was rewarded with the rank of knight, and the addition of Marcianus to his name. He supported Cornelius Laco and opposed Otho, who executed him after gaining power.\n\nBookSixXLIX His agreement to Nero’s cremation.\n\nBookSevenXIV His influence over Galba.\n\nBookSevenXXII A sexual intimate of Galba.\n\nIlerda is the modern Lleida, in western Catalonia. The Battle of Ilerda took place in June 49BC between the forces of Julius Caesar and the Spanish army of Pompey the Great, led by his legates Lucius Afranius and Marcus Petreius. Unlike many other of the battles of the civil war, this was more a campaign of manoeuvre than actual fighting.\n\nBookOneLXXV Caesar’s restrained behaviour there.\n\nIllyricum, the Roman province, comprised most of the ancient Balkan region of Illyria. It stretched from the Drilon River in modern northern Albania to Istria (Croatia) in the west and to the Sava River (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the north. Salona (near modern Split in Croatia) functioned as its capital. The regions which it included changed through the centuries though a large part of ancient Illyria remained part of Illyricum as a province, while south Illyria became Epirus Nova, part of Roman Macedonia.\n\nBookOneXXIX BookTwoXXI Part of Caesar’s Governorship and a provincia or area of responsibility, rather than a province. The Roman administration did not establish a full province until Octavian’s wars in Illyricum, 35BC - 33BC.\n\nBookOneXXXVI The defeats of Gaius Antonius and Dolabella there in 49BC.\n\nBookTwoVIII Augustus there in 45BC - 44BC.\n\nBookTwoXIX An orderly from the army stationed there tried to assassinate Augustus.\n\nBookTwoXXV Freedmen used to guard the border colonies.\n\nBookTwoXCVII BookTwoXCVIII BookThreeXXI Tiberius, sets off for Illyricum in 14AD, Augustus accompanying him part of the way, but returns due to Augustus’ last illness.\n\nBookThreeXVI Tiberius’ successful campaign there in 7AD - 9AD.\n\nBookThreeXXV The army mutinied there in AD14 and Drusus the Younger was sent by Tiberius to quell the uprising.\n\nBookSevenXXIV Otho’s father Lucius helped quell Camillus’s rebellion in Dalmatia in 42AD.\n\nIncitatus, meaning Speedy or Swift, was Caligula’s horse, which he provided with luxurious appointments and a lavish establishment for entertaining guests at the Games.\n\nBookFourLV Caligula intended to make his horse Consul.\n\nIndians, are the inhabitants of the Indian sub-continent, who apparently maintained overland and maritime trade relations with Augustan Rome, particularly after the conquest of Egypt.\n\nBookTwoXXI Augustus received embassies from Indian kings in 26 and 20BC.\n\nIsidorus the Cynic, was a philosopher who dared to taunt Nero.\n\nBookSixXXXIX Banished by Nero.\n\nIsis was a goddess in Ancient Egyptian religious belief. She was worshipped as the idealised mother and wife as well as the patronness of nature and magic. Following the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great her worship spread throughout the Graeco-Roman world. According to Josephus, Caligula wore female garb and took part in her mysteries which he endorsed in Rome. Vespasian and Titus practised incubation in the Roman Iseum while Domitian built a further Iseum and a Serapeum.\n\nBookSevenXXXV Otho was said to celebrate her rites, publicly.\n\nBookEightXXXVII The young Domitian disguised himself as a follower of Isis in 69AD to escape his enemies.\n\nIsthmus of Corinth, the Isthmus is the narrow land bridge which connects the Peloponnesian peninsula with the mainland of Greece, near the city of Corinth. The word ‘isthmus’ comes from the Ancient Greek word for ‘neck’ and refers to the narrowness of the land. To the west of the Isthmus is the Gulf of Corinth, to the east the Saronic Gulf. A canal was cut in 1893.\n\nBookOneXLIV Caesar’s plans to cut a canal through the Isthmus.\n\nBookFourXXI Caligula intended to cut a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth, and carry out the project initially planned by Caesar.\n\nBookSixXIX Nero attempted to cut a canal through the Isthmus.\n\nBookSixXXIV The Isthmian Games were one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece, held on the Isthmus of Corinth.\n\nJanus was the god of gates, doors, doorways, beginnings and endings, and probably related to the Indian god Ganesh. His month of January begins the New Year. He is most often depicted as having two faces or heads, facing in opposite directions, possibly to look both into the future and the past. The main Temple of Janus stood in the Roman Forum, and the temple doors were closed in times of peace and open in times of war. The closing of the temple was a rare event, said to have taken place for the first time under Numa Pompilius, for the second time under Titus Manlius in 235BC, a third time by Augustus in 29BC, a fourth time by Nero in 66AD and a fifth time under Vespasian in 70AD.\n\nBookTwoXXII The gates closed under Augustus in 29BC.\n\nBookSixXIII The gates closed under Nero in 66AD.\n\nJerusalem is the ancient city in the Judean Mountains, between the Mediterranean Sea and the northern edge of the Dead Sea. It was the Jewish capital of the Kingdom of David, and is sacred to a number of faiths. In 6AD, the city, and much of the surrounding area came under direct Roman rule as the Province of Judaea.\n\nBookSixXL Astrologers predicted Nero would rule the East from Jerusalem after his deposition from the rule of Rome.\n\nBookEightXXX Titus took the city, destroying the Second Temple, on the 10th of August 70AD (by tradition, the 9th of Av in the Jewish Calendar)\n\nJewish People, the Jewish community in the Roman Diaspora dates back to the second century BC and was comparatively large, perhaps fifty thousand upwards in the time of Augustus.\n\nBookOneLXXXIV The Jewish community in Rome mourned Caesar who had not only opposed Pompey, the subjugator of Judaea in 63BC, but had acted mildly towards them, and was regarded as a benefactor.\n\nBookTwoLXXVI There are seven official fast days in the Jewish calendar, none of which coincide with the Sabbath, contrary to the original text of Augustus’ letter.\n\nBookTwoXCIII Augustus praised Gaius Caesar for not offering prayers at the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nBookThreeXXXII The use of the Jewish term Sabbath for Saturday, was widespread in Roman times. The Christian use of Sabbath for Sunday was a later introduction.\n\nBookThreeXXXVI Tiberius banned the Jewish religion from Rome, and expelled the Jews under threat of slavery if they refused to obey.\n\nBookFiveXXV Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome, possibly in 41AD or 49AD.\n\nBookEightIV BookEightV Vespasian was sent to tackle the Jewish rebellion of 66AD in Judaea.\n\nBookEightVI The Judaean legions swore allegiance to Vespasian in 69AD.\n\nBookEightXXIX Titus commanded a legion in Judaea 66AD - 68AD.\n\nBookEightXLVIII The Fiscus Judaicus was an agency instituted to collect the tax of that name imposed on Jews in the Empire after the destruction of the Temple in 70AD, for the upkeep of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in Rome. The tax of two denarii was initially imposed by Vespasian in place of the levy payable towards the upkeep of the Temple in Jerusalem. Domitian expanded its scope to include not only those born Jewish, and all converts to Judaism, but also those who concealed the fact that they were Jews or merely observed Jewish customs.\n\nJosephus (37AD – c. 100AD) born Yosef Ben Matityahu (Joseph son of Matthias) and later taking the name Titus Flavius Josephus, was a first-century Romano-Jewish historian and hagiographer of priestly and royal ancestry. He fought in the First Jewish-Roman War of 66AD – 73AD as a Jewish military leader in Galilee. Prior to this, however, he had been sent to negotiatiate with Nero for the release of Jewish priests. He later returned to Jerusalem and was drafted as a commander of the Galilean forces. He surrendered to the Roman forces led by Vespasian and his son Titus, in July 67AD. In 69AD he was released, and according to his own account, played a role as a negotiator with the defenders during the Siege of Jerusalem in 70AD. In 71AD, he reached Rome in the entourage of Titus, becoming a Roman citizen and client of the ruling Flavian dynasty. His most important works are The Jewish War (c. 75AD) and Antiquities of the Jews (c. 94AD).\n\nBookEightV His prophecy regarding Vespasian.\n\nJuba I, King of Numidia (c. 85BC - 46BC, r. 60BC - 46BC) was the son and successor to Hiempsal II. Later Juba became Pompey’s ally. At the Battle of Thapsus seeing the certain defeat of Scipio’s army, Juba did not take part in the battle and fled with the Roman general Petreius. Finding their retreat cut off, they made a suicide pact, in which Petreius probably killed Juba and then committed suicide with the assistance of a slave.\n\nBookOneXXXV BookOneLIX BookOneLXVI Defeated by Caesar at Thapsus.\n\nBookOneLXXI Mentioned.\n\nJuba II of Numidia (c. 50BC - 23AD) was initially king of Numidia and then later transferred to Mauretania. Augustus restored Juba as king of Numidia between 29BC - 27BC. In 25BC he was allocated Mauretania, and Numidia was divided between Mauretania and Afria Nova. In 21AD, Juba II made his son Ptolemy co-ruler. Juba died in 23AD.\n\nJugurtha or Jugurthen (c. 160BC – 104BC) was a Libyan King of Numidia, (North Africa), born in Cirta (modern Constantine). He fought against Rome in 112BC, was defeated, and died in prison in Rome.\n\nBookOneXI Defeated by Marius (112BC)\n\nJulia Caesaris (c. 130BC - 69BC) was a daughter of Gaius Julius Caesar II and Marcia (daughter of consul Quintus Marcius Rex). She was a sister of Gaius Julius Caesar III (the father of Julius Caesar) and Sextus Julius Caesar III. Around 110 BC she married Gaius Marius. They had a son, Gaius Marius the Younger. According to Plutarch, it was through the marriage to her, a patrician, that Marius launched his political career. Her reputation for virtue protected her even after Sulla’s persecution of Marius and his allies.\n\nBookOneVI Julius Caesar delived her funeral eulogy.\n\nJulia is the name of two daughters of praetor Gaius Julius Caesar and Aurelia Cotta, the parents of dictator Gaius Julius Caesar. The sisters were born and raised in Rome. The elder of the two sisters is only known from Suetonius’ mention (LXXXIII) of her two grandsons, Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius. The second sister (101BC - 51BC) married Marcus Atius Balbus, a praetor and commissioner who came from a senatorial family of plebs status. Julia bore Balbus three daughters: Balbus died in 52BC and Julia died a year later. Julia’s youngest grandchild, her grandson Octavian (later the Emperor Augustus) delivered her funeral oration at age 12.\n\nBookOneLXXIV One of the two sisters offered evidence at the trial of Publius Clodius.\n\nBookTwoIV BookTwoXCIV Julia the Younger was the grandmother of Augustus.\n\nBookTwoVIII Augustus delivered Julia the Younger’s funeral oration\n\nJulia (Caesar’s daughter, d. 54BC) The daughter of Gaius Julius Caesar the Roman dictator, by his first wife, Cornelia Cinna, and his only child in marriage, Julia became the fourth wife of Pompey the Great in 59BC.\n\nBookOneI Mentioned.\n\nBookOneXXI Married to Pompey.\n\nBookOneXXVI Her death in 54BC.

Augustus subsequently adopted several male members of his close family as sons. Julia resulted from Augustus’ second marriage with Scribonia. In 25BC she married her cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus who died in 23BC. In 21BC Julia married Agrippa. The marriage resulted in five children: Gaius Caesar, Julia the Younger, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Agrippina the Elder (mother of Caligula), and Agrippa Postumus. Tiberius then married her in 11BC forced by Augustus to divorce Vipsania Agrippina (daughter of a previous marriage of Agrippa’s). By 6BC the couple had separated. In 2BC she was arrested for adultery and treason. Reluctant to execute her, Augustus exiled her to the island of Pandateria (modern Ventotene). Five years later, Julia was allowed to return to the mainland, though Augustus never forgave her and ordered her to remain in Rhegium. He explicitly gave instructions that she should not be buried in his Mausoleum. When Tiberius became emperor, he ordered that she be confined to one room and deprived of human company. She died from malnutrition some time after Augustus' death in 14AD, but before 15AD.\n\nBookTwoXIX BookTwoLXXI Mentioned.\n\nBookTwoLXIII BookThreeVII Her marriages.\n\nBookTwoLXIV Her five children by Agrippa.\n\nBookTwoLXV BookThreeX BookThreeXI Banished in 2BC.\n\nBookTwoLXXIII She made clothes for Augustus.\n\nBookTwoCI Augustus decreed in his will that she should not be buried in the family Mausoleum after her death.\n\nBookThreeX Tiberius leaves her behind in Rome in 6BC.\n\nBookThreeL Tiberius’ severity towards her.\n\nBookFourVII Her daughter Vipsania Agrippina the Elder married Germanicus.\n\nBookFourXXIII Caligula claimed his mother Agrippina was the product of incest between Julia and her father Augustus.\n\nJulia the Younger (19BC – c. 29AD) also known as Julilla (little Julia), Vipsania Julia Agrippina, and Julia Caesaris Minor, was the first daughter and second child of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder. Along with her sister Agrippina the Elder, Julia was raised and educated by her maternal grandfather Augustus and her maternal step-grandmother Livia Drusilla. Julia the Younger was the elder granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus, sister-in-law, stepdaughter and daughter-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, maternal aunt of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, second cousin of the Emperor Claudius, and maternal great-aunt of the Emperor Nero. In 8AD Julia was exiled for having an affair with, and possibly secretly marrying, Decimus Junius Silanus, a Roman Senator. She was sent to Trimerus, a small Italian island, where she gave birth to a child. Augustus rejected the infant and ordered its death. Silanus went into voluntary exile, but returned under Tiberius. Sometime between 1AD and 14AD, her husband Aemilius Paulus was executed as a conspirator and it may be that Julia’s exile was in fact for involvement in the conspiracy. Julia died on the island to which she had been exiled. Due to the accusation of adultery, Augustus stated in his will that she should never be buried in Rome. It may be that Ovid’s banishment for a ‘book and an error’ may be linked to the conspiracy (due to him witnessing the secret marriage?).\n\nBookTwoXIX BookTwoLXXII Mentioned.\n\nBookTwoLXIV Her upbringing.\n\nBookTwoLXV BookFiveXXVI Banished c. 8AD.\n\nBookTwoCI Augustus decreed in his will that she should not be buried in the family Mausoleum after her death.\n\nJulia, Titus’ daughter: see Flavia Julia Titi\n\nJulia Augusta, see Livia Drusilla\n\nJulia Drusi, Caesaris Filia (5AD - 43AD) was the daughter of Drusus the Younger and Livilla and granddaughter to the Emperor Tiberius.

However, after Caligula became emperor in 37AD, he ordered their divorce and remarried his sister to his friend, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. During Caligula’s illness in 37AD, he changed his will to name Drusilla his heir, making her the first woman to be named heir in an imperial will, in an attempt to continue the Julio-Claudian line through any children she might have, leaving her husband to rule in the meantime. However, her brother recovered and in 38AD, Drusilla died, at the age of twenty-two.

In 39AD, she was involved in the failed conspiracy to overthrow Caligula and to replace him by his brother-in-law Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Livilla and her sister Agrippina the Younger were banished to the Pontine Islands. She returned from exile on the orders of her paternal uncle, the Emperor Claudius. Later in 41AD, she fell out of favour with Messalina and was charged with adultery with Seneca. Both were exiled. She was most likely sent to Pandateria. In late 41AD or early 42AD, Claudius ordered her execution, apparently by starvation, on unsupported charges.

As such, it was left to Cato to force through the decision to actually execute them.\n\nJunius Silanus, Lucius (d. 49AD) was praetor in 48AD. Claudius betrothed him to his daughter Claudia Octavia in 41AD, but this was broken off in 48AD when Empress Agrippina the Younger, hoping to secure Octavia as bride for her son Nero, falsely charged him with open affection toward his sister Junia Calvina.
