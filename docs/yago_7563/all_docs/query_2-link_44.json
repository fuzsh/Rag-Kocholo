Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTiberius Caesar Augustus reigned as the second Roman Emperor from 14 BCE until 37 BCE. While Tiberius was an accomplished military leader and administrator, his rule was ultimately associated with brutality and terror, leaving the Roman Empire with a troubled history.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information about Tiberius Caesar Augustus, or you can download our 28-page Tiberius Caesar Augustus worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nTiberius Caesar Augustus, born Tiberius Claudius Nero, was the second Roman Emperor who reigned from BCE 14 to 37.\n\nHis parents, Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla, gave birth to him on November 16, 42 BCE.\n\nTiberius’ father was a member of a famous Roman family, while his mother was a Roman noblewoman descended from the Claudians, a highly regarded aristocratic clan.\n\nBorn in 38 BCE, Nero Claudius Drusus also known as Drusus the Elder, was his brother who served in the Roman military and held high-ranking administrative positions.\n\nHowever, in 39 BCE, their mother, Livia, divorced their biological father and married Octavian, later known as Emperor Augustus.\n\nAugustus raised Tiberius in his household, providing him with military and administrative training suitable for a Roman noble.\n\nAugustus noticed Tiberius’ potential and eventually trained him for leadership.\n\nAugustus dispatched him to various military operations, where he demonstrated his effectiveness as a commander and garnered numerous military awards.\n\nHis preparation for leadership included participation in diplomatic missions and government posts in several provinces.\n\nTiberius established that he was both a skilled military leader and a good student, both of which proved important as Emperor.\n\nWhen Tiberius’s father died in 32 BCE, he was nine years old.\n\nAt a young age, he had already delivered a eulogy at the rostra.\n\nIn 29 BCE, he joined his stepfather in a triumphal chariot ride to commemorate Antony and Cleopatra’s defeat at Actium.\n\nMARRIAGE\n\nTiberius Caesar Augustus’ challenging marriage history had a significant impact on his political career. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Augustus’ commander and personal friend, allowed the marriage of his daughter Vipsania Agrippina to Tiberius.\n\nReports suggest that Tiberius harbored a deep affection for his first wife, Vipsania, with whom he fathered a son named Drusus Julius Caesar.\n\nHowever, in order to preserve the imperial succession, Augustus ordered Tiberius to marry Julia the Elder, Augustus’ own daughter, who had recently become widowed.\n\nHe divorced Vipsania in 11 BCE.\n\nTiberius and Julia’s opposing personalities, along with the emotional distress resulting from the arranged marriage, made this marriage unhappy for both parties.\n\nThe fact that they were childless when they married increased Tiberius’ growing dissatisfaction with his position in the Julian family and the imperial court.\n\nSUCCESSION AND REIGN\n\nHe started his career in the military and excelled in many missions.\n\nTiberius led successful battles in Gaul and Germania, expanding the Roman Empire’s borders and bringing calm to the dangerous frontier provinces.\n\nHis military prowess earned him the respect of both the legions and the Roman Senate.\n\nNotably, during his co-consulship with Augustus in 12 BCE, he strengthened his political position among Rome’s aristocracy.\n\nDespite his military skill and status as Augustus’ apparent heir apparent, Tiberius was dissatisfied with his role in the imperial succession and Roman political maneuvering.\n\nAround 6 BCE, he abruptly decided to retire to Rhodes, where he spent several years.\n\nTiberius’ retirement was defined by his self-imposed exile from political and military activity, during which he spent time studying and contemplating.\n\nAlthough the reasons for his retirement remain unclear, it was assumed that it was due to his troubled relationship with Augustus and discontent with imperial politics, especially after his forced divorce from Vipsania and marriage to Julia.\n\nTiberius’ retirement lasted until 2 BCE, when Augustus called him back to Rome, most likely due to the deaths of his planned heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, which created a vacancy in the succession.\n\nWhen Tiberius returned, he resumed his responsibilities and continued to serve in high-ranking positions, eventually succeeding Augustus as Emperor in 14 BCE.\n\nHis time at Rhodes, however, remained a distinct and somewhat perplexing chapter in his life, demonstrating the complex interaction between his own wants and the demands of his dynastic position.\n\nEmperor Augustus, Tiberius Caesar’s stepfather, orchestrated a sophisticated and strategically planned procedure to ascend to the Roman throne.\n\nInitially, Augustus preferred his direct descendants to succeed him, namely his grandsons through Julia the Elder, Gaius, and Lucius Caesar.\n\nHowever, their early deaths, combined with the death of Tiberius’ own brother, Drusus the Elder, left Augustus with minimal options.\n\nAs a result, Augustus accepted Tiberius as his son and successor, but not until Tiberius had to take on his nephew Germanicus, the popular son of his brother Drusus, as his own heir.\n\nTiberius’ succession was also dependent on his famed military prowess, which he had demonstrated in numerous campaigns, strengthening his eligibility as a ruler in the eyes of Rome’s elite and armed forces.\n\nBoth the Senate and Tiberius himself, known for his reluctance to embrace the title of Emperor and its obligations, welcomed Tiberius’ ascent to the throne in 14 BCE with a mix of acceptance and hesitation.\n\nDuring his early reign, he pursued Augustus’ policies, cementing the Roman Empire’s dominance and expanding its borders through military conquests, particularly in Pannonia, Germania, and Raetia.\n\nHe also proceeded to expand the Roman administrative infrastructure, which included legal and financial changes.\n\nHe is known for budgetary conservatism, which helped to preserve a strong state treasury, as well as judicial reforms, which included limiting the power of specific authorities in order to reduce corruption and abuse of power.\n\nThe aftermath of the devastating Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 BCE, in which Germanic tribes led by Arminius defeated three Roman legions under Publius Quinctilius Varus, was one of the most difficult military circumstances Tiberius faced.\n\nTiberius was instrumental in restoring order on the German frontier following this catastrophic loss.\n\nTiberius was able to maintain the frontier by restoring discipline and morale in the soldiers and redefining Rome’s defensive boundaries to avoid similar assaults by Germanic tribes.\n\nIntricate senatorial politics and an increasingly strained relationship with the Roman Senate and nobility marked Tiberius’ political reign.\n\nHe was known for his cold and quiet attitude, preferring to work via surrogates like his Praetorian prefect, Sejanus, who wielded considerable power in Rome.\n\nThis reliance on Sejanus eventually backfired, as he gained authority and began to function as a de facto ruler, even indulging in conspiratorial operations.\n\nTiberius eventually recognized Sejanus’ threats and organized his downfall and execution in 31 BCE, which sparked a series of purges of reputed Sejanus allies, creating an environment of mistrust and terror throughout Rome’s upper ranks.\n\nTiberius grew increasingly reclusive after Sejanus’ death, retiring to his house on Capri, from where he reigned until his death in 37 BCE.\n\nTiberius’ final years of leadership were marked by growing reclusiveness as he withdrew to the island of Capri.\n\nHe then monitored and oversaw state affairs from afar, sparking suspicions of decadence and paranoia.\n\nMeanwhile, additional treason trials and deaths worsened the political situation, leaving Rome in the hands of administrators.\n\nWhile Tiberius’ legacy is a mix of admiration for his administrative ability and condemnation for his later autocratic leadership, his reign was unquestionably crucial to the building of a solid imperial government in the early Roman Empire.\n\nHis reign laid the groundwork for future emperors, but it also contributed to the harsher ideas of imperial power that defined the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nThroughout history, Tiberius’ era remains difficult, with researchers constantly reassessing his accomplishments and flaws.\n\nCHALLENGES OF TIBERIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS\n\nAs emperor, Tiberius Caesar Augustus faced numerous problems, including political intrigues, administrative changes, military concerns, and personal issues, all of which put his leadership to the test.\n\nTiberius, despite being Augustus’ stepson, was not the first option for succession, resulting in tension and a need to show legitimacy.\n\nHis path to succession was complicated, and he frequently appeared hesitant to take on the position of Emperor.\n\nTiberius had to deal with the Roman Senate and other political personalities, each with their own agenda.\n\nHis relationship with the Senate was difficult; they were accustomed to Augustus’ charismatic authority, and Tiberius’ more quiet style drew fewer followers.\n\nTiberius trusted his Praetorian prefect, Sejanus, who had tremendous political power in Rome.\n\nHowever, Sejanus’ ambition and subsequent collapse fostered an environment of fear and mistrust, resulting in countless charges and purges of accused traitors among the Roman elite.\n\nTiberius implemented administrative reforms to uphold Augustus’ objectives and ensure the empire’s stability.\n\nDespite being economically prudent, his frugality may not have won over those who benefited from a more liberal approach to imperial expenditures.\n\nTiberius had military challenges, including maintaining Rome’s frontiers and dealing with rebellions in provinces such as Illyricum.\n\nHe also had to deal with the aftermath of the Teutoburg Forest tragedy, which dealt a major blow to Roman military prestige and strategy.\n\nTiberius’ quiet and enigmatic personality hindered his ability to develop a dominant public image.\n\nThis resulted in a lack of popularity among the general public, who frequently admired emperors with greater charisma and prominence.\n\nTiberius withdrew to Capri during his rule, delegating administration to talented but ambitious lieutenants.\n\nThis retreat fueled bad rumors about his actions and oversight of the government.\n\nTiberius struggled to select a suitable heir after his death.\n\nDEATH\n\nIt is widely assumed that Tiberius died on March 16, 37 BCE, following an almost 23-year reign as Emperor.\n\nAs Tiberius grew older, the subject of succession became increasingly important. His own son, Drusus, had died under suspicious circumstances, so attention went to his grandnephew Caligula and his potential as Rome’s next emperor.\n\nTiberius spent his final years in self-imposed solitude on the island of Capri, where he controlled the empire’s affairs from a distance.\n\nHis health was declining, and some ancient historians reported that his behavior had grown increasingly unpredictable and delusional.\n\nThe Praetorian Prefects and other Roman authorities successfully administered the empire during this time.\n\nTiberius summoned his future successor, Caligula, his great-nephew and adopted grandson, to his side as his health deteriorated.\n\nAfter Tiberius died, the Praetorian Guard hastily declared Caligula Emperor.\n\nThe Senate and troops quickly embraced the new emperor, while Tiberius’ death elicited mixed feelings because of his eventual image as an autocratic and remote ruler.\n\nThe specific circumstances of Tiberius’ death remain unknown.\n\nHowever, Tiberius’ death signaled the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty’s second rule, paving the way for Caligula’s brief and turbulent reign.\n\nTiberius Caesar Augustus Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Tiberius Caesar Augustus across 28 in-depth pages.
