        "text": "She was the antithesis of Livia and Octavia, the only biological child of Augustus, and was not one for following the rule book. By getting herself exiled from Rome by her own father, Julia was the embodiment of the defiance and resistance meeting the new moral legislation and would serve to encourage later generations of women to defy their conventional role within society.\n\nWith a father as princeps and restorer of traditional Roman values, Julia carried a particularly heavy burden. Her marriages would have been incredibly important as they functioned as tools for the emperor’s succession. And while Augustus’ moral legislation was attempting to renew the virtuous and domestic Roman woman, his daughter effectively rejected these policies and revolted against them. Her adultery represented the political undermining of her father’s legislation (Edwards 1993, 61).\n\nIn a character sketch written about Julia, we obtain information about her personality and her relationship with her father;\n\n‘She loved poetry and was very well-read, as was easy in that household, and her mild courtesy and good-humoured spirit won the woman immense popularity, as those who knew her vices marvelled at her contrasting merits.’\n\n(Macrobius Saturnalia 2.5.1-9)\n\nWriting four centuries after Julia’s lifetime, Macrobius used an earlier source, Domitius Marsus’ works, to compose a witty reflection that imparts a unique insight into Julia’s character. Her infidelity, disobedience and ill-fated marriage are all brought to the attention of the reader, and Macrobius additionally presents Julia as being especially aware of the power she yielded as the daughter of Augustus (Sat. 2.5.8). This depiction as bold and cocksure, allows the account Tacitus offers over Julia’s attitude towards her marriage with Tiberius to seem conceivable (Fantham 2006, 86);\n\n‘She had been the wife of Tiberius while Gaius and Lucius Caesar were in their glory, and had disdained him as an unequal match. This was Tiberius’s special reason for retiring to Rhodes’ (Tac. Ann. 1.53).\n\nHaving said this, Julia does participate in the marriage to her stepbrother; she bore him a son (although he unfortunately died in infancy); she followed him to Illyria where he received provincial command; and herself and Livia hosted a dinner for elite women in honour of Tiberius’ equestrian triumph (Dio.55.2.4). However, the relationship inevitably broke down and Julia is reported to have engaged in illegal and scandalous acts which resulted in her arrest and exile.\n\nDio reports on Julia’s hanky-panky and alcohol consumption;\n\n‘Julia was so dissolute in her conduct as actually to take part in revels and drinking bouts at night in the Forum and on the very rostra’ (55.10.12).\n\nAs does Suetonius;\n\n‘He found the two Julias, his daughter and granddaughter, guilty of every form of vice, and banished them’ (Aug.65.1).\n\n‘Julia had been banished because of her immorality and adulteries’ (Tib.11.4).\n\nAnd Seneca;\n\n‘Unchaste beyond the curse of unchastity…she turned from adultery to prostitution and sought the right to every form of licence with any unknown adulterer’ (De Beneficiis 6.32).\n\nNevertheless, throughout years of scandalous behaviour, Julia had a powerful card to play; she had the public on her side. According to Cassius Dio there was public demand for her release from exile and the public pressure resulted in her being moved from the island of Pandataria where she was banished, back to the mainland (Dio.55.13.1).\n\nAlthough operating in a very different way to Fulvia, Livia and Octavia, who were all involved in influencing political and domestic affairs through more standard means, Julia was nevertheless of value to developments occurring within Augustan politics. It was through her ‘indecent’ and ‘improper’ behaviour, that she contributed to the gradual liberation of women, who had no desire to sit at home, spin wool and serve their bureaucratic husbands. With her own daughter Julia also being exiled for committing adultery (Suet. Aug. 65.1; Tac. Ann.3.24; 4.71), Julia set the tone for women to rip off their restrictive, domestic shackles, and live a less constraining, more public lifestyle.\n\nThe Augustan reforms unlocked new social and economic opportunities for elite women, which later trickled down to also impact the lives of women from outside of the elite classes (Culham 1997, 203)."
