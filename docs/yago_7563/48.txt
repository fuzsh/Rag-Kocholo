born: 30 October 39 BCE and died 14 CE

Julia Caesaris filia or Julia Augusti filia, known as Julia the Elder was the daughter and only biological child of Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, and his second wife, Scribonia. Julia was also the stepsister and second wife of the emperor Tiberius; maternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and the Empress Agrippina the Younger; grandmother-in-law of the Emperor Claudius; and maternal great-grandmother of the Emperor Nero. Her epithet "the Elder" distinguishes her from her daughter, Julia the Younger.

She was married three times, each husband being the expected heir of Augustus. The first two marriages, to Marcellus and Agrippa, left her widowed while Augustus was still alive. The third marriage was to the future emperor Tiberius.

The marriage to Tiberius was not happy. Tiberius was forced to divorce a wife that he truly loved, and she felt he was beneath her. They separated after 5 years, and Tiberius went into a self-imposed exile on Rhodes. On her own, Julie engaged in several affairs that resulted in divorce from Tiberius and her arrest for adultery in 2 BCE.

After being arrested, Julia was exiled and never allowed to return to Rome. After 5 years she was allowed to move to a nicer place and given an annual income. Julia died in 14 CE shortly after her father. The circumstances of her death are unclear. Many historians have accused Tiberius having taken actions that caused her death either from debility or starvation.
