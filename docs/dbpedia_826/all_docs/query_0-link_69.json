        "text": "My Original transfers of the first 8 shows(excluding episode 2) have been copied and sold everywhere on the internet. As the years passed and I purchased new equipment, I learned more about getting the most out of the VHS to DVD process. Curious to see how much I could improve these shows, I went back to the original tapes and made a new pass at it. I was very surprised and happy with the results. I also added some beautiful menus and chapter points. What I now have is the Best and Only one of its' kind.\n\n1st episode aired on November 13, 1976.
