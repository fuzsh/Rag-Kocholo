        "text": "Fans of a summer outdoor wrestling tradition in Verona know the party doesn’t stop until someone goes home in an ambulance.\n\nKeystone State Wrestling Alliance superstars are returning to the “spot that’s more than a dot” for Battle in the Borough 6.\n\nMatches still are being finalized for the annual fundraiser at Cribbs Field. Tickets, $10 each, benefit the borough’s parks and recreation committee.\n\nGates open at 3 p.m. with bell time at 6 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 17.\n\nKSWA owner Bobby Orkowis said all four championship titles will be on the line. Other matches include a Lumberjack Match with local first responders set up outside the ring.\n\nOrkowis said the Verona tour stop is one that many of the competitors look forward to.\n\n“It continues the great summer that the KSWA always seems to have, which begins at the Brawl Under the Bridge (in Homestead) and ends at Millvale Days,” Orkowis said.\n\n“This event has grown every year, and we are proud to be involved with a great all-day event in Verona. For the sixth year, KSWA is proud to partner with our friends at the Verona Parks and Recreation Board and at the Lower Valley Athletic Foundation. These folks do such great work for the community, and we are proud to be able to support them in their efforts.”\n\nThere is usually an intermission after a few opening bouts. Several superstars use the break to mingle with fans, sign autographs and take photos.\n\nGolden Triangle Champion Freek E. Doyle, Five Star Champion Man Child and tag team champions New Glory — Hunter Huffman and Tony Onyx — will be defending their respective belts for the first time.\n\nKSWA heavyweight champion “The Face of Pittsburgh” Lou Martin plans to further cement his Steel City legacy with a win over one of the promotion’s top challengers.\n\nThe evening concludes, as is tradition, with an ambulance match.\n\nIt ends when one of the competitors can stuff his opponent inside the ambulance and shut the doors. Accommodations are provided by Lower Valley EMS.\n\nSupport local\n\nThe event first began with 100 or so fans as a way to raise funds and get families to use the park and generate some interest in Verona’s best-known recreation sites.\n\nVince Flotta, councilman and parks and recreations board president, said he has seen it grow by at least 30 to 50 people each year.\n\nLast year, there were 350 paid attendees and 500 people total, including police, fire, EMS and special guests.\n\n“I think the kids love it,” Flotta said. “It’s kind of like the last thing for the kids to do before summer is over, and it’s something local that they can take pride in. A lot of towns don’t have wrestling events.\n\n“Wrestling in the gym is different than outside in a field. It’s a lot more seasonal instead of in a stuffy building. I think it is better for parents, too. They don’t have to keep their kids sitting down the whole time. They can let them get up and run.”\n\nLifelong Verona resident Ryan “Bubs” Alberts is scheduled to sing the national anthem.\n\nInner Groove Brewing will serve drinks from 5 to 7 p.m. Verona ice cream shop Gilbert’s Creamery will have some treats available."
