Some would even argue we were raised by TV, and that assessment is not without merit.\n\nEven our children’s programming was indisputably created by a bunch of artsy hippies tripping heavily on acid. I’m not trying to make this sound like a bad thing. At all. It made us creative and weird and awesome.\n\nHere are a few of the mildly bizarre TV trends that shaped my mildly bizarre age group.\n\nBattle of the Network Stars\n\nThank ye gods for YouTube, or you whippersnappers would be thinking us geriatrics were just making this shit up.\n\nLet’s just be frank. We all knew that 95% of the appeal of Battle of the Network Stars was watching Lynda Carter and Adrienne Barbeau’s boobies bounce in triple time. For the straight dudes anyway. And some of the ladies, I suppose."
