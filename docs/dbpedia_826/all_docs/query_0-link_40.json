        "text": "ABC announced the cast of its latest reboot - Battle of the Network Stars - which is set to air this summer. The show will feature television stars competing in various themes (cops vs. sitcoms, doctors vs. famous TV families, for example) and promises to be the sleeper hit of the summer. How do I know? Well, I just spent 30 minutes combing through photos of the original series and they are pop culture gold. See for yourself.\n\nIf the star power of a young Michael J. Fox, Kurt Russell and Heather Locklear doesn't excite you, I don't know how to help you. And while the reboot will feature stars from the original version including Erik Estrada, Barry Williams and Kim Fields, it'll be up to newcomers like Lance Bass, Mischa Barton and TayeDiggs to keep the BOTNS legend alive. We can't wait.\n\nâ€¢ GALLERY: Classic photos of the original Battle of the Network Stars"
