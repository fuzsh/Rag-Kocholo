        "text": "Dick Ebersol, the czar of all things Olympic at NBC, has already declared Thursday a really big night for TV.\n\n“This, without a doubt, is shaping up as the most competitive night in the history of American television,” Ebersol told the New York Times last week.\n\nThat may be a bit of a stretch, but it is unprecedented for four franchise shows to go head-to-head on the same evening. The 8 p.m. clash for viewer eyeballs features the Olympics with its premier event, women’s figure skating; “American Idol,” which will eliminate its first two semifinalists; “Survivor,” the venerable and still popular reality show; and “Dancing With the Stars,” which will air its penultimate episode.\n\nIf there’s a surprise entry in the field, it’s “Dancing” (8 p.m., ABC). The first edition of the competition show matching D-list celebrities in the quick step, the waltz and the fox trot was an unexpected hit over the summer. Still, it was up against repeats and lame summer replacements on the other networks, so when ABC announced it would return in the fall, people in the business were skeptical it could hold its own against first-run programming.\n\nBut “Dancing” not only held its own, its viewership soared, giving ABC a hit on Thursdays (the competition show) and Fridays (the results show). It has beaten “Survivor” the past two Thursdays, the first show to do since “Friends” went off the air. It also won the ratings gold medal last Thursday and Friday against the Olympics.\n\nSome of the success can be chalked up to clever scheduling and promotion on the part of ABC. But “Dancing” has an appeal that is undeniable. Many viewers empathize with celebrities trying to learn ballroom dances that flourished in World War II. (How many of us have suffered through trying to do a passable waltz for some special occasion?) That most of the D-listers actually threw themselves into training with their professional partners gives “Dancing” even more of a feel-good vibe.\n\nAnd with all due respect to Kelly Monaco and John O’Hurley, the finalists in the summer, the show actually got some first-rate hoofers this time around.\n\nTwo of the three “stars” left standing are pop singer Drew Lachey (bro of Nick, formerly of Nick and Jessica) and Stacy Keibler, the ex-WWE poster babe. They have worked with pros Cheryl Burke and Tony Dovolani to become creditable pair dancers. And the third, ex-49er Jerry Rice, has come a long way quickly, working with San Jose dancer Anna Trebunskaya.\n\nIf I had to vote based on recent performances, I’d go with Keibler, but it would be close.\n\nThursday night, the three couples will dance for the gold, as it were, with the results (a combination of the judges’ scores and viewer votes) to be announced Sunday at 8 p.m. Given how well “Dancing” has done so far, you can expect it to end with a ratings flourish.\n\nThe return of “The Sopranos” for its sixth season is now just two weeks away. (Has it really been almost two years since season five? Seemed longer.) But if you want to remind yourself just where the series left off, HBO is showing the finale of season five on Sunday at 9 p.m. The hour was loaded with twists and turns, and you may need to refresh your memory about what happened to Tony Blundetto and Johnny Sack.\n\nIf you’re a fan of “Everwood” (9 p.m. Monday, WB, when it returns with new episodes on March 27), this is not good news. According to several sources, the strong family drama hasn’t made any of the early schedules being tossed around for the new CW, the combination of the WB and UPN, which starts this fall. Interestingly, there are rumors that the CW is trying to work out a deal where another WB family show, “7th Heaven,” would return for at least one more year. “Heaven” is now scheduled to end its run this May, after 10 seasons.\n\nCBS will shuffle the sitcom deck in March. “Old Christine,” a new comedy starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, will get the cushy spot behind “Two and a Half Men” on Mondays, when it debuts March 13. “Courting Alex,” which has been in that spot since last month, will move to Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. March 22, where it will be matched up with “Out of Practice” (8 p.m.), returning from a lengthy hiatus. The shows currently occupying the hour, “Still Standing” and “Yes, Dear,” will end their shortened seasons on March 15.\n\nNBC has decided to stretch out the season for “The Office” (9:30 p.m. Thursday). It had been announced the series would have its season finale in late March so star Steve Carell could make a movie. But with one new episode and repeats, the show won’t actually be ending its season until mid-May.\n\nAnd speaking of laughs, or maybe not, NBC will finally bring back “Joey” but not on Thursdays. The “Friends” spin-off, one of the biggest busts in recent TV history, will air what will almost certainly be its final episodes on Tuesdays at 8 p.m., starting March 7."
