A total of 19 of these competitions were held between 1976 and 1988, all of which were aired by ABC.\n\nIn 2003, NBC attempted to revive Battle of the Network Stars with a two-hour special.\n\nIn 2005, Bravo premiered a revived version of the show named Battle of the Network Reality Stars. Also in 2005, ESPN premiered a short-lived, sports-themed spinoff version of Battle of the Network Stars as Battle of the Gridiron Stars featuring twenty players from the AFC and NFC competing in a variety of tasks that had nothing to do with football."
