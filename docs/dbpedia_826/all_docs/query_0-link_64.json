        "text": "By:\n\nWednesday, August 7, 2024 | 6:01 AM\n\nTurning the page to a new quarterback wasn’t going to be easy for the Penn Hills football program. For the previous four seasons, the Indians could depend on Julian Dugger, now a freshman at Pitt, to lead the offense.\n\nDugger passed for 4,984 yards and ran for 1,939 yards during his four years as a starter. Now, Penn Hills will have a battle between a returning player and a transfer for the spot under center.\n\nDevin Harris transferred into the district after starting for Shady Side Academy last season. Harris threw for more than 1,600 yards and helped the Bulldogs make the playoffs.\n\nJaymere Ellis played at wide receiver for the Indians last season.\n\n“It’s always going to be hard to replace a talented kid like Julian,” Penn Hills coach Charles Morris said. “We have a couple of guys competing for the starting quarterback spot. Jaymere knows the offense more. With Devin, we are getting him up to speed. He is grabbing it and learning it quickly.”\n\nPenn Hills hopes that Harris and Ellis can get up to speed quickly. The Indians would like to defend their Northeast Conference title. Penn Hills finished last season 9-3, advancing to the WPIAL Class 5A semifinals before losing a heartbreaker to section rival Pine-Richland.\n\nMorris, who is in his third year at coach, believes this team will be equipped to challenge for the playoffs in a difficult conference. In addition to playing North Hills and Pine-Richland, the Indians will have a few difficult nonconference tests — most notably Aliquippa on Sept. 20.\n\n“They hold each other accountable,” Morris said. “They work extremely hard. They have a belief and willingness to compete for each other. That’s a fun and exciting thing.”\n\nThe Indians offense will see quite a bit of turnover beyond the quarterback. Penn Hills will also need to replace long-time starter Amir Key at running back and Cam Thomas at wide receiver.\n\nNaytell Mitchell will be one of several players to be counted on to carry the ball out of the backfield.\n\nMartel Palmer, Darrell Banks and Ellis are all pass-catching options.\n\nGerald Jones and Donovan Burnett will both be counted on to help out on the offensive and defensive line.\n\nPenn Hills is hoping to fine tune things from last year in order to make a serious run in the WPIAL playoffs. Morris said there are improvements to be made everywhere.\n\n“We could improve with situational football with things here and there,” Morris said. “We could have better clock management. We need to make sure we secure the ball and not put the ball on the turf. We want to finish tackles and make plays. I thought we did a better job with our special teams and we want to have the same dynamic.”\n\nPenn Hills\n\nCoach: Charles Morris\n\n2023 record: 9-3, 5-0 in Class 5A Northeast Conference\n\nAll-time record: 542-324-22\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nDate, Opponent, Time\n\n8.24 Susquehanna Township at York Suburban, 4\n\n8.30 at Woodland Hills, 7\n\n9.6 North Allegheny, 7\n\n9.13 at Fox Chapel*, 7\n\n9.20 Aliquippa*, 7\n\n9.27 Shaler*, 7\n\n10.4 at Pine-Richland*, 7\n\n10.11 Mt.
