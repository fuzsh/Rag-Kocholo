Thank goodness for “Big Brother,” right Leslie Moonves?\n\nCBS was first in ratings with a 1.0 rating/5 share in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic and in total viewers with an average of 4.7 million, according to preliminary numbers. Following reruns, “Big Brother” at 9 p.m. earned a 1.6/7 and 5.3 million viewers. “Zoo” at 10 managed just a 0.5/2 and 3.1 million viewers.\n\nNBC was second in ratings with a 0.9/4 and in viewers with 4.3 million. “Hollywood Game Night” at 8 had a 0.9/4 and 3.9 million viewers. At 9, “The Wall” put up a 1.0/4 and 4.7 million viewers. “The Night Shift” at 10 got a 0.7/3 and 4.2 million viewers.\n\nABC and Fox tied for third in ratings, both with a 0.8/4. ABC was third in total viewers with 3.4 million, Fox was fourth with 2.8 million.\n\nFor ABC, “Boy Band” at 8 settled for a 0.5/3 and 2.7 million viewers. “Battle of the Network Stars” at 9 premiered to a 1.0/4 and 4 million viewers.
