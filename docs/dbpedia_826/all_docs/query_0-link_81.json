        "text": "ABC’s revival ofÂ Battle of the Network Stars announced its 100 competitors, and said the revival of the 1976 to 1988 show “will beÂ a nostalgic throwback to the original series, where TV celebrities blended athleticism with hilarious antics while featuring an array of fan favorites from numerous TV series.”\n\n20 of those people competed on the 1970s and 1980s version, includingÂ Facts of Life and SurvivorÂ star Lisa Welchel.
