DESCRIPTION:

(from ABC's press release, April 2017) The '70s and '80s television pop-culture classic, "Battle of the Network Stars," is revived when it returns to television this summer. "Battle of the Network Stars" is a nostalgic throwback to the original series where TV celebrities blended athleticism with hilarious antics. The 10-episode summer event will pit teams of current and classic TV stars from multiple eras and different genres against one another in a variety of athletic games. Viewers can look forward to seeing a fresh take at some of the classic show's sporting "events" like Tug o' War, the Obstacle Course and the Dunk Tank. In the original "Battle of the Network Stars," TV stars representing the three major networks at that time - ABC, CBS and NBC - teamed up to compete in physical challenges that were originally broadcast on ABC starting in 1976 and continuing for 13 years. Legendary sports broadcaster Howard Cosell hosted all but one of those 19 episodes, commenting on the action with a semi-serious version of the style for which he was famous.
