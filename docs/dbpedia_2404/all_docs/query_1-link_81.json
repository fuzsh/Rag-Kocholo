        "text": "Over two decades after School of Rock, comedian and musician Jack Black is still inspiring kids’ love for rock and roll! Students from Ringwood Secondary College in Australia reached out to the celebrity via social media with a very special invitation. Their school happened to be putting on a production of School of Rock around the same time that Black’s band, Tenacious D, would be performing in the area. So, these kids begged him to come by for a visit.\n\nObviously, these talented students weren’t going to waste an opportunity to put on a hilarious sketch. Their creative video request to Jack Black is filled with great references to School of Rock. At the end of the clip, they literally fell to their knees and begged the “lord of rock” to “please, grace us with your mighty love!” Then, they started chanting the star’s name over and over again.\n\nNot only did Black love this video, but he also responded to the students with a shoutout of his own.\n\n“So moved by your video and the fact that you’re gonna rock,” the celebrity said.\n\nJack Black was thrilled to be invited to the School of Rock rehearsal, which he told them was his “favorite movie I ever did.” Sadly, though, he was forced to decline. His tour schedule while in Australia would be way too hectic.\n\n“I wish I could come see it, but unfortunately I’m going to be rocking,” he said.\n\nHowever, he ended the video by singing a line from the movie just for them!\n\nJack Black’s reply was epic.\n\nRingwood Secondary College shared the actor’s video reply on social media, along with a live reaction from the students. They couldn’t believe that Black was taking the time to personally respond to them like this!\n\nEven though he couldn’t make their rehearsal, it was still so amazing of Jack Black to encourage his young fans to keep on rocking. These kids are going to remember this moment forever!"
