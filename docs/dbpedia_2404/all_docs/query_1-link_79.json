        "text": "More than 2,000 images of female students from 71 schools have been posted or traded online in what is being referred to as a perverse pornography ring.\n\nYesterday, News.com.au reported that young men use the site to nominate specific schools or regions where they are seeking nude photos from, along with the full names of those they are “hunting”.\n\nOnce a name is provided, other members of the group then contribute by posting identifying data about the intended victim, including which school they go to, their photograph, home address and phone number.\n\nMany of the images show the girls engaging in sex acts – some while wearing their school’s uniform.\n\nIn some cases, the victims have pleaded with the posters for their images to be removed, but have been scorned and laughed at in response. Police have been made aware of the website but say they are unable to act as it is hosted overseas.\n\nIn total the site mentions 28 high schools in NSW, 18 in Queensland, 15 in Victoria, five in the ACT, two in South Australia and two in Tasmania.\n\nThe NSW Sex Crimes Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent, Linda Howlett, told The Educator that it was a criminal offence “to take, transmit or possess images that are considered child pornography”.\n\n“This also applies to teenagers, who are reminded that the dissemination of any material depicting nudity or sexual activity involving young people could constitute a criminal offence,” she said.\n\n“They should be aware they could be arrested and charged and, if convicted, end up with a criminal record.”\n\nShe urged anyone with information that may assist in the investigation to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\n\n*Below is a full state-by-state breakdown of the schools identified on the site.\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES\n\nBlaxland High School\n\nColo High School\n\nEastview High School\n\nElderslie High School\n\nElizabeth Macarthur High School\n\nFrancis Greenway High School\n\nGrafton High School\n\nGreenpoint Christian College\n\nHolsworthy High School\n\nIngleburn High School\n\nJohn Therry Catholic High School\n\nLake Munmorah High School\n\nLeumeah High School\n\nLisarow High School\n\nMagdelene Catholic High School\n\nMaitland High School\n\nMount Annan High NSW\n\nMullumbimby High School\n\nPlumpton High School\n\nRutherford Technology High School\n\nSouth Grafton High School\n\nSt Catherine’s Catholic College, Singleton\n\nSt Lukes Grammar School\n\nSt Patricks College, Campbelltown\n\nThe Jannali High School\n\nThomas Hassall Anglican College\n\nTurramurra High School\n\nWenona\n\nWyong High School\n\nQUEENSLAND\n\nAllhallows’ School\n\nCaloundra State High School\n\nCavendish Road State High School\n\nClontarf Beach State High School\n\nGrace Lutheran College\n\nGrace Lutheran College\n\nKirwan State High School\n\nMatthew Flinders Anglican College\n\nMiami State High School\n\nOrmiston College\n\nRedlands College\n\nRuncorn State High School Wins\n\nRyan Catholic College\n\nSheldon College\n\nSouthern Cross Catholic College, Redcliffe\n\nSpringwood State High School\n\nSt Andrews Anglican College QLD\n\nWoodridge State High School\n\nVICTORIA\n\nBacchus Marsh Grammar School\n\nBairnsdale Secondary College\n\nBayswater Secondary College\n\nCarrum Downs High School\n\nChristian College Geelong- Surf Coast Campus\n\nFrankston High school\n\nHillcrest Christian College\n\nKambrya College\n\nLakeside College, Pakenham\n\nLilydale High School\n\nNorwood secondary college\n\nPakenham Secondary College\n\nPatterson River secondary\n\nRingwood Secondary College\n\nWerribee Secondary College\n\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\nGlossop High School\n\nThomas More College\n\nAUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY\n\nCanberra College\n\nGungahlin College\n\nRadford College\n\nSt Clares College Canberra\n\nSt Mary MacKillop College\n\nTASMANIA\n\nClaremont College\n\nMontrose Bay High School"
