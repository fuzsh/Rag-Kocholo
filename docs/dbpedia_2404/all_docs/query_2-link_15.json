        "text": "From Mrs Stathatos\n\nNAPLAN\n\nThe past fortnight has been busy with the National Assessment Program- Literacy and Numeracy being a prime focus for our Year 7 and 9 students. The students conducted themselves impeccably during the examination period and the college managed to accommodate this necessary challenge during the preliminary stages of our building program by informing students and staff and planning for the examinations in a timely manner. The next stage in the process is notifying parents when we receive the results.\n\nSTUDENT VOICE\n\nAs part of a BASTOW briefing we attended, Ms Fedrizzi and I were asked to find out student responses to the following questions:\n\nWhat did students say about the learning that inspired them? Try to find out as much as you can about WHAT they were learning and WHY this was so significant to them?\n\nTheir responses were shared in a collaborative forum with other teachers from across Victoria as part of a wider discussion about what stimulates student interest at school. Here is a sample:\n\nPassionate and engaged teachers helped them see the passion and purpose in any content.\n\nNot having hierarchical relationships – where the position of teacher gets in the way of the purpose of learning…\n\nPositive relationships between teachers and students “when the teacher has faith about my work and trusts that it will be good.”\n\nLinks drawn between the work/task and the wider world, or with their areas of interest – metaphors that make them see the links between their classroom learning and the wider world.\n\nKnowing the purpose or ideas behind subjects and the work that is on offer\n\nHaving a supportive class – not just the teacher – sometimes this is harder in the upper levels when you have many different classes without the same people from one class to another – can feel some disconnect…\n\nWhen teachers cater for the variety of learning approaches, needs and styles in the class\n\nIn Year 10 I was involved in the Ladder program, a program which aims to spread awareness for youth homelessness whilst providing refuge and aid for many homeless people all across Melbourne, South Australia and Western Australia. Through the program, I was able to go to their headquarters in Collingwood and meet the founder of the organisation, and learn all about the development of the organisation, its partnership with the AFL (as the organisation was founded by ex-players) and its expansion from one refuge in the CBD to many different refuges across 3 states. As I learned more about the programs foundation, I was very inspired by the compassionate and heartfelt work of the founders and the impact their organisation is having on the lives of young people. It was really significant for me as it was really moving to witness just how great an impact these people were making on the lives of at-risk Australians.\n\nI have always been quite inspired by learning about different aspects of real life – whether this is language (taboos, how and why we use language the way we do), religion (Buddhism and otherwise), or international affairs (why different events are occurring in the world). But what really inspires me is when I am learning about something that will impact my future – like how to critically think (refer to the philosophy course).\n\nThe Victorian Curriculum\n\nOur Curriculum Committee met this week and discussed the audit that was administered by Ms Niven which highlighted the discrepancies between the old AUSVELS curriculum and the new Victorian Curriculum. A briefing with the Outer Eastern Network of Principals also focused on the key points of implementation and provided schools with resources and support for the implementation stage. It was noted that feedback, metacognition and self regulation are effective drivers in enhancing student learning. We are continuing our work in this area.\n\nEDUCATION WEEK\n\nRingwood Secondary College’s Education week program will be published on Monday and outlines a whole range of activities that we offer students. Thank you to all our dedicated staff for their time and energy.\n\nThe Department’s website has free activities to involve families in this symbolic week and can be accessed via this link http://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/events/Pages/edweek2016calendar.aspx\n\nEleni Stathatos\n\nAssistant Principal\n\nSenior School\n\nWinter Sleep Out\n\nAs you read and peruse this newsletter, a number of Year 12 students and several staff are preparing for the annual winter sleep out here at the College. The commitment of the Year 12 cohort to social service and justice is to be acknowledged and commended. The wonderful work done by our prefects in organising such an event speaks volumes for their willingness to think and act globally. A more detailed report will be available in the next newsletter. We look forward to a very successful event.\n\nFurther to the Wellbeing report, our Year 11 students enjoyed a very successful Positive Education Day here at the College. Starting with a session on study skills delivered by Elevate, students chose a variety of activities that focussed on new learning experiences, outside their normal timetabled classes. Thank you to so many staff that contributed to the smooth running and celebratory feeling of the day.\n\nExams and the GAT\n\nThe examination period is upon as and all students in Year 11 will have exams from Thursday, 2nd of June until Monday, 6th of June.\n\nMoreover, any student that is currently studying a Unit 3 and 4 subject, will be sitting the 3 hour General Achievement Test (GAT), on Tuesday, 7th of June, starting at 10.00am. This exam is a VCAA requirement and is completed across the state, by all secondary schools, at the same time.\n\nAny questions about the GAT or exams can be directed through to the Senior School on 9870 2002.\n\nJames Barut\n\nAssistant Principal\n\nMiddle School\n\nAs we near the halfway point of the term, it is amazing to think about the many fantastic learning experiences our middle school students have already been involved in this term.\n\nAt our recent Year 9 and 10 assemblies, our Year 10 coordinator, Mr Benn Jamieson, shared a moving story about a number of his ancestors’ experiences as ANZAC’s, which had the audience enthralled.\n\nThis week has seen our Year 9 students complete NAPLAN testing in reading, writing, language and numeracy. Results will be available in late August and we hope that the results will show students and their families the progress they have made over the past two years.\n\nA large number of students have also been involved in extra-curricular activities with 40 Year 9 students travelling to Mount Buffalo, as part of the Duke of Ed program. Supported by Duke of Ed leaders Ms. Usher and Ms. Benson, along with Mr. Ricci, Ms. Urbano, Ms. Aveling and Mr. Saunders, the students showed incredible perseverance and resilience as they stepped outside of their comfort zones, trekking, caving and abseiling.\n\nOver the last weekend 46 middle school students travelled with the stage bands, choir and vocal ensemble to the Mt Gambier Generations in Jazz Festival. Thank you to Mr. Mackay, Mr. Bonnett, Mr. Jaques, Ms. Sedergreen, Mr. Binotto and Ms. Kenna who not only accompanied them on the trip, but also spent countless hours preparing students for the festival.\n\nAnother highlight has been 111 students represented Ringwood Secondary College at the Year 9 and 10 Winter round robin, competing in Football, Soccer, Badminton and Netball. Congratulations to all students who participated and best of luck to the teams that will now progress through to Region level.\n\nOver 50 Year 9 and 10 students, have also been busily preparing for this year’s production, Anything Goes, as members of the cast, orchestra, stage and tech crew. A large team of staff led by Mr. Moody, Ms. Borlase and Mr. Kent have been conducting rehearsals since the first week of this term and all the hard work will no doubt result in a fantastic show yet again this year.\n\nPlease be sure to read Ms. Kim Watson’s Middle School Report for further details of these and many other activities that the Year 9 and 10 levels have been involved in over the past month.\n\nYear 10 exams\n\nExams for Year 10 students commence on Friday 3rd of June and students’ exam times should now appear on their Compass schedule. Students are encouraged to start their revision program early in order to develop their skills in preparing for exams, which will assist them as they progress into VCE study.\n\nKyle Simkin\n\nActing Assistant Principal\n\nFrom Junior School\n\nEveryone could think about performing a random act of kindness. The list is endless but one to think about is to…visit someone who may be lonely.\n\nPeople can become lonely for any number of reasons, regardless of their age. Some people are alone because they don’t feel like they fit in, while others may become lonely after the death of a close friend or relative. Other people might just suffer from an illness that doesn't allow them to see many people. Children with family troubles will often become lonely as a result of the tough issues they face at home. Offer your companionship to someone who is lonely in exchange for his or her wisdom or a lifetime of stories.\n\nUpcoming reports\n\nThe end of semester one is fast approaching and it is an important time for all students to continue to focus and complete all tasks to the highest-level possible. With ongoing reporting underway, it is vital that any missed or incomplete work is submitted for assessment. Parents are encouraged to access Compass to check progress of their son or daughter and contact staff if the need arises. Mid-year reports will be available, as in Term 1, via Compass.\n\nOpen Night 2016\n\nWhat a team effort!\n\nThe College Open Night 2016 for 2017 incoming students was a great success, due the hard work from many staff and students. Speaking to prospective parents on the evening the Year 7 students, Daniel Watson and Flynn Commins, were interviewed by Year 12 Prefects Caleb Lindner and Rebecca Allsop about their transition into Ringwood Secondary College. During the evening the junior ambassadors partnered with the Year 12 Prefects to lead tours, usher parents and provide refreshments. Congratulations to Mrs Keenan, the Junior School Community Heads and all staff who carefully planned and organised the evening to make it such a success.\n\nNAPLAN\n\nCongratulations to all students on their performance and dedicated approach during the NAPLAN tests held this week. Thank you to all staff that supervised the tests with special thanks to all staff that managed the process.\n\nHomework Tutor Group\n\nIf your son or daughter needs a tutor in a subject, they could join the homework tutor group. Senior students tutor the junior students in a range of subjects, in a warm and caring environment with Ringwood Secondary College staff supervising the sessions at all times. Contact the General Office for information.\n\nJazz Night Concert\n\nOn Monday, May 2nd all Stage Bands performed at Doncaster Shopping Town. It was a great evening that showcased our talented students from Years 7 to 12. They played to a packed house of parents, students and staff. A special thank you to the Music Association who worked tirelessly to support our budding musicians and all students and staff who assisted with supervision or leading the bands throughout the evening.\n\nBiggest Morning Tea\n\nEvery year Ringwood Secondary College staff holds the ‘Biggest Morning Tea’. We work together to help raise vital funds for the Cancer Council. With your help, we can make this year’s event the biggest yet! Our target for 2016 is $500.
