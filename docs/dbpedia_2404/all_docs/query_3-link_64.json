        "text": "Major works underway\n\nWe’re removing the dangerous and congested level crossings at Dublin Road, Ringwood East and Bedford Road, Ringwood and delivering a brand-new Ringwood East Station by 2025.\n\nWe’ve settled into our new construction sites at Bedford Road and Dublin Road and have started early works as we prepare for major construction.\n\nDublin Road\n\nWe've set up construction sites at Ringwood East Station and have started installing the piles for the rail trench. Piles play an important role in making sure the walls of the trench are solid. See page 2 for more information on how piling is done.\n\nBedford Road\n\nWe’ve set up our construction sites at Rosewarne Lane and Bedford Road, with further work to continue. This includes establishing areas for storage of our materials and equipment.\n\nChanges to the way you travel\n\nBuses will replace trains on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines between Blackburn and Belgrave/Lilydale from 8.30pm Wednesday 9 August to last service Tuesday 15 August.\n\nBedford Road, Ringwood will be closed at the level crossing from 8pm Thursday 10 August to 6am Monday 14 August.\n\nDublin Road, Ringwood East will be closed at the level crossing from 10am to 8pm Thursday 10 August.\n\nDublin Road, Ringwood East will be closed at the level crossing from Tuesday 5 September to Tuesday 17 October.\n\nMajor works kicking off in August\n\nYou may have noticed more activity near Bedford Road and Dublin Road since we set up sites and started early works.\n\nIn the coming months, we'll be doing more investigations such as soil sampling and using non-destructive digging equipment to understand more about what's underground. This helps to inform the construction process as we prepare for major works.\n\nDuring this period, we'll also install and relocate major underground services such as water, drainage, gas and rail signalling.\n\nWe've also begun piling works which involves drilling circular holes in the ground. Once these holes are drilled, we fill the holes with steel frame reinforcements and then fill them with concrete to create the foundations for the rail trench.\n\nIn the coming months, you may be impacted by road closures or disruptions to the Belgrave and Lilydale lines as detailed above. These works will be around-the-clock at times to minimise the duration of the disruptions, and access to Railway Avenue shops will be maintained.\n\nAccess to Ringwood Secondary College, local businesses and homes along Bedford Road and Rosewarne Lane will be maintained.\n\nThere will be limited parking available at Ringwood East Station. Alternative parking is available at Pratt Street, Ringwood – a 500m walk to Ringwood Station.\n\nAs we continue our work on these level crossing removals, we encourage you to sign up for regular email updates.\n\nOnce complete, there will be:\n\nimproved safety and less congested roads for more than 23,000 drivers every day\n\nnew and safer pedestrian and cycling paths including the new connection between Bedford Park and the Heathmont Rail Trail\n\naround 60,000 new native trees, shrubs and grasses — a new Ringwood East Station with around 460 upgraded car parking spaces built to modern standards.\n\nMore about piling\n\nFor more information on piling at Dublin Road, view the piling fact sheet.\n\nKeep shopping local and be rewarded\n\nShops are still open while we work, so we encourage you to be rewarded for shopping locally with Stamp Me, our digital loyalty card app for Ringwood East.\n\nWe'll ensure access to local businesses is maintained and will continue to work closely with local businesses and the local traders' association.\n\nGet involved with Stamp Me by spending $10 or more in one transaction at participating shops and scan an in-store QR code at the time of purchase to get a stamp.\n\nOnce nine stamps are collected, shoppers will be rewarded with a $10 voucher to be spent in the local area.\n\nTo be part of Stamp Me, download Stamp Me from the app store, register an account and search for Ringwood East. Happy stamping!\n\nIf you're a local business that wants to get in touch, please call 1800 105 105 or email contact@levelcrossings.vic.gov.au.\n\nSeed collection: what is it and how do we do it?\n\nSeed collection involves an ecologist identifying trees and assessing if there are seeds ripe and ready to collect.\n\nThe process plays an important role in the local environment. It can help increase biodiversity in the local area, as well as supporting local fauna with a food source, habitat and shelter.\n\nMost seeds we’ve collected are indigenous in origin and have been identified as Eucalyptus species including wallaby grass and acacias.\n\nOur team have successfully collected seeds in Dublin Road, Ringwood East that have gone to local nurseries for propagation.\n\nFrom our conversations and engagement with the community, we understand the importance of native vegetation and greenery to the local Ringwood community.\n\nWe'll work to retain as many trees as possible and will plant around 60,000 new trees, shrubs and grasses as part of the project.\n\nMeeting our new neighbourhood\n\nThank you to locals for stopping by and having a chat with our team, whether it’s been at the station, at the shops or at an event. We look forward to meeting more of you and encourage you to say hi the next time you see us!\n\nProject timeline\n\nEarly 2022\n\nInitial concept designs released.\n\nMid 2022\n\nUpdated designs released.\n\n2023\n\nMajor construction starts.\n\n2025\n\nLevel crossings gone for good. Ringwood East Station opens.\n\n* Timeline subject to change.\n\nStay connected to the project"
