        "text": "We’re removing the level crossings at Dublin Road, Ringwood East and Bedford Road, Ringwood, which will make Ringwood level crossing free in 2024, a year ahead of schedule.\n\nA boom gate free Bedford Road has reopened to traffic and train services have resumed on the Belgrave Line following a 2 month construction blitz to build the new rail trench under the road.\n\nThis is the 75th level crossing to be removed as part of the Victorian Government’s commitment to remove 110 dangerous and congested level crossings across Melbourne by 2030, the largest project of its kind in Victoria's history.\n\nWe thank the community for their patience while we undertook these major construction works.\n\nDuring this time we:\n\ndug out 22,000 cubic metres of dirt from the rail trench\n\ninstalled a 380m rail trench underneath Bedford Road\n\ninstalled more than 1km of new rail track\n\ninstalled more than 4km of overhead wiring\n\nbuilt a new road bridge over the rail trench.\n\nFinishing works at Bedford Road\n\nWhile our major construction blitz is complete, we will undertake ongoing finishing works around Bedford Road and the rail corridor, such as building the missing walking and cycling link between the Heathmont Rail Trail and Bedford Park. The new shared use path will remove the need to travel on-road via Lena Grove and improves walking and cycling options in the area. ​\n\nOver the next month, we’ll continue to work during the day from 7am to 6pm in and around the rail corridor from Monday 25 March until Thursday 28 March. We will then take a break over Easter and return on Thursday 4 April.\n\nWorks will include:\n\nremoving temporary fencing\n\nremoving worker crib sheds\n\nfinishing footpath reinstatement on a section of Pitt and Great Ryrie Street\n\nbuilding the shared use path in the rail corridor.\n\nWe'll keep the community informed on impacts and what to expect.\n\nReinstatement of on-street parking\n\nAs we continue works on the shared use path along the rail corridor, we will need to maintain intermittent access for construction vehicles and machinery from Lena Grove. From Monday 25 March, Lena Grove will retain one side of the street as ‘no-standing’ to allow room for machinery and vehicles. On-street parking will be available on the other side.\n\nOn-street parking on Ford Street, Best Street, David Street, Campbell Street, Fremont Street and Tudor Court will be available again from Monday 25 March.\n\nImpacts to local roads and parking\n\nLena Grove amd Heathmont Rail Trail\n\n7pm to 6pm, Monday 25 March to Thursday 28 March and Thursday 4 April to July:\n\nConstruction vehicles and machinery accessing the rail corridor intermittently from Lena Grove.\n\nGreat Ryrie Street\n\nMonday 25 March to late April:\n\nReinstatement of a section of footpath on Great Ryrie Street between the Bedford Road intersection and Best Street. The footpath on the opposite side will remain open.\n\nPitt Street\n\nMonday 25 March to late April:\n\nA section of the footpath on the rail side will remain closed. The footpath on the opposite side will remain open.\n\nLena Grove\n\nMonday 25 March to July:\n\nOne side of Lena Grove will have ‘no standing’ with the other side reinstated for street parking.\n\nFord Street, Best Street and David Street, Campbell Street, Freemont Street, Tudor Court\n\nFrom Monday 25 March:\n\nReinstatement of on-street parking.\n\nPTV and school bus services return to regular route\n\nPTV 380 and 679 bus services have returned to their regular routes. Check the PTV website for further information.\n\nSchool bus services have also returned to regular routes, with the bus stop outside Ringwood Secondary College re-opening for drop off and pick up of students.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nIntermittent onsite traffic management will be in place to help road users and pedestrians navigate around the local area safely.\n\nContinued presence of workers, truck movements and construction equipment.\n\nPlease be aware works can sometimes take longer than expected or need to be rescheduled due to weather and other factors outside of our control.\n\nThere may be times where we need to adjust our works and will advise when this is happening.\n\nMore information"
