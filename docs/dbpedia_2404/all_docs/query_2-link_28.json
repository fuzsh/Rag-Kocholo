        "text": "The Ringwood to Croydon Connects project aims to complete the missing 6.5km link in the regional bicycle network between Ringwood Metropolitan Activity Centre (RMAC) and Croydon Major Activity Centre (CMAC). A map of the current bike networks in Maroondah is detailed below.\n\nThe strategic importance of this cycling link is recognised within the Victorian Strategic Cycling Corridors, the Metropolitan Trails Network and the Eastern Regional Trails Strategy.\n\nThe existing bicycle facility along Bedford Road are shared bicycle/parking lanes. The lanes have insufficient width for bicycles to pass parked vehicles within the lane, causing a stressful riding environment in which cyclists need to merge into the traffic lane to pass parked vehicles.\n\nResearch has shown that many Victorians are interested to cycle more but are concerned about safety in “high stress” cycling environments. More information is available on the Transport Victoria website.\n\nThe Bedford Road bicycle path is part the wider Ringwood to Croydon Connects off-road path project, which aims to complete the ‘missing link’ in the regional bicycle path network. The bicycle path will be a high-quality facility designed in accordance with best practice guidelines to cater for a wide range of cycling abilities in the community. At a couple of constrained locations, the separated bicycle path and footpath merges into a shared use path (SUP) similar to the existing SUP along Bedford Road and Station Street west of Warrandyte Road.\n\nThe Bedford Road bicycle path will provide a direct off-road connection to the Ringwood Metropolitan Activity Centre, nearby schools and other local cycling paths.\n\nNorth side of Bedford Road\n\nThe existing parking supply along residential frontages on the north side will generally be retained as per current conditions. Kerb outstands will be provided at several locations to cater for the bus stops and improved landscaping, which results in a slight reduction of 2 car spaces along residential frontages.\n\nSouth side of Bedford Road\n\nThe current functional design proposes to remove the shared bicycle/parking lane and install 10 indented car parking spaces on the south side.\n\nWhy is a parking lanes proposed on the north side and not the south side?\n\nThe road needs to be narrowed to accommodate a separated bicycle path on the north side. Accordingly, one of the parking lanes needs to be removed.\n\nThe north side supplies more on-street parking opportunities than the south side which is limited by intersecting side streets.\n\nOn-street parking in the north side parking lane or south side indented car spaces is a public resource available for use by residents of, and visitor to, both sides of the road, as well as other community members.\n\nWill there be enough car parking?\n\nSurveys were undertaken during peak parking periods to understand current parking utilisation rates along Bedford Road. The surveys indicate that the existing car parking supply is under utilised.\n\nThe on-street supply via the north parking lane and south indented spaces as proposed in the Functional Design more than accommodates the surveyed peak parking demand.\n\nShould the project proceed to construction, Council Engineers would monitor the parking demand to maintain an appropriate management of car parking supply.\n\nNorthern side of Bedford Road\n\nProperty crossovers will be maintained in current locations. Drivers in vehicles entering or exiting properties will need to give way to pedestrians on the footpath and cyclists on the bicycle path in accordance with the Victorian Road Safety Rules.\n\nThe proposed separated footpath and bicycle path design facilitates best practice safety outcomes where it can be achieved, as the offset from property boundary to the bicycle path provided by the footpath (and drain invert) provides better sight lines between residents exiting properties and oncoming cyclists.\n\nSouthern side of Bedford Road\n\nNo change is proposed to property access.\n\nBoth sides of Bedford Road\n\nVehicles entering or exiting properties would need to give way to pedestrians and cyclists on the paths in accordance with the Victorian Road Safety Road Rules.\n\nThe design will link to the existing shared use path along Bedford Road west of Warrandyte Road, and to a separated bicycle path east of Great Ryrie Street incorporated into the Bedford Road Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP). Also included in the LXRP works is the extension of a shared use path along the rail corridor between Bedford Road and Lena Grove. For further information on the Bedford Road LXRP proposal go to www.bigbuild.vic.gov.au/projects/level-crossing-removal-project/projects/bedford-road-ringwood\n\nAs part of the wider Ringwood to Croydon Connects path, it is proposed to install a sealed shared use path from Bedford Road through Bedford Park and adjacent the rail corridor behind Ringwood Secondary College to Dublin Road."
