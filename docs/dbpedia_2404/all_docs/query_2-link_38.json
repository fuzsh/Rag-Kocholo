        "text": "This morning in Victoria, the state Education Minister launched what she called a \"virtual classroom\".\n\nLike the Federal Government's My School website, the ultranet is intended to give parents more information about their child's schooling.\n\nThe Victorian Government says the $60 million initiative will allow parents to see their children's attendance, test results, homework and lessons, online.\n\nThe ultranet was officially launched this morning, by the Victorian Education Minister Bronwyn Pike.\n\n\"This ultranet will provide an online environment for teachers, to share curriculum and resources, to interact with their students; for students to have access to a huge range of additional opportunities and for parents to be able log online and monitor the progress of their student,\" she said.\n\n\"So the ultranet will break down the classroom walls.\"\n\nEach student will have an online workspace.\n\nParents will have a login too. They can use the site to view information about their children's lessons, homework, results and attendance.\n\nThe ultranet has been switched on for about a week, at two schools in Melbourne's east.\n\nMichael Phillips is the principal of Ringwood Secondary College and says teaching staff there have been enthusiastic about the site.\n\n\"The opportunity to do something once and then to share it with many is a great feature of the ultranet because all of your resources are going to be in the one place,\" he said.\n\nThe Australian Education Union supports the project, but Victorian president, Mary Bluett is worried about increased teacher workload.\n\n\"There are concerns around the time for training and preparation. There are concerns around expectations of students and parents in terms of 24-7 contact,\" she said.\n\n\"All of that is being addressed by a set of protocols that we're currently negotiating with our department.\"\n\nGail McHardy of Parents Victoria says the ultranet will improve communication between schools and families but steps must be taken to ensure those without internet access at home are not disadvantaged.\n\n\"We've made this very clear to the department of education, about making sure that people to have access and it will be reliant on the local school community to ensure that where information bytes are going through this platform that those families don't miss out,\" she said.\n\nThe network will be introduced at 1,500 public schools by September and its progress will be watched closely by other states."
