        "text": "Parents/guardians can register their child for the ISEB Pre-Tests between 10 June 2024 and early May 2025.\n\nThe ISEB Pre-Tests can be taken any time between 3 September 2024 and late May 2025.\n\nThe last date for registration and testing will be confirmed shortly, and all schools, parents and guardians will be contacted.\n\nParents/guardians should register their child on the Guardian Portal to create an ‘Applicant Profile’ and unique shareable ‘Applicant ID’.\n\nWe recommend that pupils take the tests in their current junior/prep school to reduce anxiety and save applicants from having to take days out of school.\n\nPupils can only sit the ISEB Pre-Tests once in any academic year, i.e. between 3 September 2024 and late May 2025.\n\nThe ISEB Pre-Tests comprise four online, adaptive and multiple-choice tests covering English, mathematics, verbal reasoning and non-verbal reasoning.\n\nAs an adaptive test, questions presented to pupils during their tests are unique, and it is highly unlikely that two pupils will see the same series of questions.\n\nThe test system will assess the pupil’s ability after each response and select the next question to have the most appropriate level of difficulty.\n\nThis means that a pupil will not spend time answering questions that are too hard or too easy for them, and the whole test can be shorter while still providing an accurate score.\n\nIn an adaptive test, pupils may be presented with differing numbers of questions, and the system does not allow them to go back and change previous answers, e.g. if they think they have made a mistake.\n\nThe length of the test has been designed to provide an accurate score for every pupil and allows for any errors uncharacteristic of the general level of ability shown in a pupil’s responses.\n\nTextbooks, calculators, mobile devices, and other materials which might assist an applicant must not be accessible during the ISEB Pre-Tests.\n\nApplicants should have access to a pen/pencil and paper for their rough work during the tests. It is the responsibility of the invigilation centre to provide a pen/pencil and paper.\n\nThe ISEB Test Walkthrough demonstrates the look and feel of the tests. Schools can share the link to it with applicants’ parents/guardians.\n\nAccess the ISEB Test Walkthrough\n\nFor more details about the structure and content of the test, download the ISEB Pre-Test Framework.\n\nThe ISEB Pre-Tests are designed to identify attainment and potential.\n\nAttainment: The English and mathematics tests are designed in line with topics and knowledge that pupils will be taught in class. They, therefore, assess a child’s ability to recall what they have been taught and apply this knowledge to solve problems in core areas of the curriculum.\n\nPotential: The verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests enable pupils to demonstrate their academic potential through a range of question types that may be unfamiliar to them. It is the pupil’s ability to analyse, think critically, find patterns, and problem-solve that is assessed. These abilities are important indicators of potential as they indicate a pupil’s ability to acquire new information and apply this to situations they have not previously come across.\n\nISEB recommends pupils use the ISEB Test Walkthrough to familiarise themselves with the test platform, explore the accessibility features and see the styles of questions that might be asked during the test.\n\nFor further information about the content of the tests, you can download the ISEB Pre-Tests Framework.\n\nPremium practice platforms\n\nAs a direct result of feedback from families and schools, we have worked with our partners, CENTURY and Bond (Oxford University Press), to develop and introduce the only ISEB-endorsed test practice platform, Bond Online Premium Plus.\n\nBond Online Premium Plus contains thousands of questions provided by ISEB, all of which are in line with the topics for the current testing session.\n\nPractice questions include:\n\nEnglish: questions on reading comprehension and grammar (including spelling)\n\nMathematics: questions are based on the National Curriculum for Mathematics until the end of Year 5.\n\nVerbal reasoning: questions assess a range of English language skills, including word meaning, comprehension, reasoning and logic.\n\nNon-verbal reasoning: questions assess non-verbal reasoning and spatial reasoning.\n\nBond Online Premium Plus is the only AI-powered practice platform that adapts to the pace of each learner to keep them challenged, engaged and motivated.\n\nISEB cannot guarantee the accuracy of third-party Common Pre-Tests practice resources that are not endorsed by ISEB. They may not accurately reflect the presentation, difficulty, test content and scoring of the live ISEB Pre-Tests.\n\nApplicants with SEND\n\nWhere appropriate and in agreement with senior schools, applicants with SEND can be given additional time of 25% to complete each test element. Applicants requiring extra time should have extra time requested for them by their parent/guardian when completing registration through the Guardian Portal.\n\nEvidence of SEND status\n\nParents/guardians should check with the senior school what documentation is needed as evidence for this request before registering. It is usually an Educational Psychologist’s report (or other suitably qualified professional).\n\nAs different senior schools have different SEND policies, ISEB recommends speaking with the SEND departments of the relevant senior schools. The parent/guardian will need to upload this evidence as part of the registration process in order to request extra time. A senior school will be able to view the applicant’s record and evidence. If the information does not meet their requirements for extra time, they will appeal the request for extra time.\n\nSenior schools should take into account the potential impact of any specific needs in their overall assessment of an applicant’s application.\n\nParents/guardians can still register without this information as they will create an account meaning their child’s record can be amended.\n\nDuring registration on the Guardian Portal, parents/guardians can include any other adjustments for access arrangements. The ISEB Pre-Tests have been designed to be accessible to applicants with a range of special educational needs or disabilities. Reasonable adjustments may be applied, the nature of which will depend on the applicant’s specific needs. In individual cases, schools may decide that not all test elements are a suitable form of assessment for a particular applicant.\n\nTest features\n\nThere are three features built into the online testing platform, specifically to support applicants with SEND.\n\nApplicants will be able to select a coloured overlay to help improve the visibility of the questions, particularly for applicants who face visual discomfort and disturbance when reading.\n\nThe font size can be adjusted, making it easier to read on screen.\n\nThe timer for the test will be visible to all applicants (even those with 25% extra time), and it can be hidden from view if the countdown makes a pupil anxious.\n\nFurther information\n\nTo support applicants with SEND, the ISEB SEND Guidance has been created for parents/guardians, senior schools and invigilation centres. This document explains in detail how the tests are constructed and how the questions have been designed to reduce the load on working memory to be more inclusive for applicants with SEND. It also contains further guidance on the registration process and where to go for support.\n\nThe ISEB Pre-Tests are accessible to applicants for whom English is an additional language. Reasonable adjustments may be applied, the nature of which will depend on the applicant’s specific needs. For applicants with EAL, this may include the use of a standard bilingual paper dictionary. In individual cases, schools may decide that not all test elements are a suitable form of assessment for an applicant whose first language is not English.\n\nParents/guardians should include what reasonable adjustments are required for their child when they register for the tests. There is no extra time element for applicants with EAL. A senior school will be able to view the applicants record and evidence. If they have any issues with the reasonable adjustments they will contact the parents/guardians and/or the current school directly."
