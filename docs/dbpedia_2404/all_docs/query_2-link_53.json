        "text": "Members of the Ringwood Level Crossing Removal Project team were invited to speak with students from Ringwood Secondary College, providing insights into their career paths and what project work on Bedford Road, Ringwood and Dublin Road, Ringwood East entails. The session kicked off with an overview of the Level Crossing Removal Project, highlighting the different construction technologies and the different roles available across projects, with team members from engineering, environment, project management and communications discussing their roles and career progression. The students showed great interest in the project, keeping the speakers on their toes with questions about disruptions, rail infrastructure and heritage findings. The panel was held as part of a broader workshop at the Yarra Ranges Tech School - Box Hill Institute, which has worked with LXRP’s Industry Capability and Inclusion (ICI) team to deliver industry events.

Not only was this the first time this method of submarine pipeline construction had been undertaken in the Southern Hemisphere, it was also the first time in the world that the two pipes had been bundled together and directionally drilled simultaneously. It has been more than 30 years since these 'firsts’, and we are still improving on this HDD technology and continually looking for ways to bring innovation and efficiency to the projects we deliver.\n\nIt’s been one massive year since we started work to build the new Mordialloc Freeway, which will link the Mornington Peninsula Freeway and Dingley Bypass. More than 600,000 hours of work has been completed since October 2019 and it shows.
