        "text": "At Norwood we are proud to offer an Enrichment Program (EP) beginning at Year 7, for students identified as highly motivated to achieve academically. These students tend to be intellectually curious, enjoy the challenge of extra academic stimulation and are able to work both independently and collaboratively to achieve their goals. Students can apply for the Enrichment Program after they have been notified by their Primary School that their “High School Placement Notification’ is Norwood Secondary College.\n\nEnrichment not Acceleration\n\nThe program is designed to emphasise an enrichment of the current curriculum and to assist in the development of critical thinking skills that are universally important to achieve educational excellence.\n\nThere is an expectation that these students will involve themselves in all aspects of College life, such as national competitions, sports, performing arts and leadership.\n\nThe Program\n\nThere will be one class of 25 students per year level, with students expected to undertake a full six years of study. The class will stay together for the first three years.\n\nThere will be a greater emphasis placed on the study of more complex and abstract concepts, with opportunities to undertake self-directed inquiry based learning. Students can expect the work to be challenging but rewarding at the same time. Our goal is to develop the critical thinking skills that are so closely associated with the academic excellence and success beyond school.\n\nEntry\n\nEntry is by application only. The selection process considers external achievement testing, parent input and student academic performance, as well as strong student commitment to the program. Any queries can be directed to Alexis Watson on 9871 0400.\n\nAs the selection process considers students holistically, applicants are required to submit a student portfolio. The portfolio can be submitted to our general office in person on testing day or via Australia Post.\n\nEdutest Date: Saturday, 12 October 2024\n\n9am-12pm at Norwood Secondary College\n\nCost: $88.00\n\nRegistration Closing Date: Friday, 4 October 2024\n\n*Late applications will not be accepted\n\nNote: Payment is made at the end of this registration process online. If payment is not made, your registration WILL NOT be valid.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Edutest or placement requests, please do not hesitate to contact Mrs Alexis Watson, Director of Curriculum/EP Coordinator or Ms Nicole Pratt, Head of Year 7 and Transition.\n\nAs the selection process considers students holistically, Norwood requires applicants to the Enrichment Program to submit a student portfolio consisting of:\n\nA letter written/typed by the student detailing their interest in and suitability for the program\n\nA letter from the parent endorsing the student’s application\n\nA copy of the Grade 5 Naplan\n\nA copy of the most recent semester report\n\nAny additional documentation to support the application (i.e. awards, co-curricular involvement, community service, work/writing samples)\n\nNote: Primary Schools may be contacted for further information to support the selection process.\n\nTo register for testing, please click on the link below to complete the Edutest application form and make payment."
