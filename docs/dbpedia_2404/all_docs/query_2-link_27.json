        "text": "“It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied into a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. We are made to live together because of the interrelated structure of reality.” — Martin Luther King Jr\n\nBenefit mindset (Ash Buchanan, 2021) is a belief that we are not separate individuals going it alone that we are interdependent beings who belong to an ecosystem where every one of us has a role to play in creating positive and healthy conditions no matter our interests, passions, or expertise. If we believe that we can continue to learn to grow using a growth mindset and take responsibility for transforming and understanding our place in the world we can realise our potential in a way that affirms life and supports others with doing the same.\n\nThis ‘community of life’ as Buchanan describes, can be fostered through increased awareness of our environment, the nurturing our existing relationships and being adaptable and flexible. RSC is alive and well with the reignition of numerous events and activities which will help reconnect our community using a benefit mindset!\n\nRingwood Secondary College’s School Strategic Plan (SSP) will align in 2022 with FISO 2.0. (Framework for Improving Student Outcomes) which is the continuous improvement framework for all Victorian government schools. To provide context, FISO 2.0 has been redesigned to place learning and wellbeing at the centre of school improvement and is a direct response to the findings of the Royal Commission into Victoria’s Mental Health System. Our Annual Implementation Plan (AIP) is the co designed plan to implement FISO 2.0, aiming to improve the learning growth and wellbeing for our students and is available on our website. The Annual School Report to the School Community outlining 2021 student achievement, engagement, and wellbeing will be available on the college website following approved by the VRQA.\n\nThe Executive Committee of Council is made up of the College Principal, Council President - Teresa Lodge, Council Vice President - Sarah Szubanski. Other nominated council members include Adam Bryant, Shayne van der Heide, Terry Bebe, Agatha Fedrizzi, Andrew Philp, Corey Lucas-Evans, and Ian Roadnight.\n\nI extend a warm welcome to new Council members Grant Jack, Felicity Mason and Michael Ward and thank Joe Gleeson for his fine contribution to School Council. I would like to congratulate Noah Philp and Jackson Smith both Year 11 students, who were elected to our School Council for the next year and thank all students who nominated. The increased number of student nominations was a very positive sign that student voice and agency is alive and well at RSC and I would encourage more students think about becoming a leader and engage in the numerous and diverse opportunities available at RSC.\n\nThe recent Year 12 Prefects induction celebrated the pinnacle of our student leadership program. Our guest speaker, former Head Prefect (1995) Keith Wolahan, spoke about his professional and successful career in law and the Australian Army. He focussed on the necessary elements to be a leader and encouraged our student leaders to tune into world news and become ‘curious’.\n\nPrefects 2022\n\nThe Car Show held last Friday evening was a great success with a large ‘turn out’ of classic cars and motorbikes, a BBQ, coffee van and beautiful sunny weather. This dual-purpose event was a perfect opportunity to raise awareness of our Chaplaincy program and showcase engineering and automotive courses at Ringwood Training. Our college Chaplains, Adam Bryant and Jen Farmilo organised this event, together with the Chaplaincy Committee. They work tirelessly to ensure our staff and students are well cared for and supported.\n\nThe Year 9 Phillip Island camp occurred this week providing a great opportunity for student social inclusion and connectedness. Students were involved in a range of outdoor recreational events including swimming, canoeing, surfing, and ropes courses.\n\nThe STEM building project is steadily moving ahead with Clark Hopkins Clarke announcing the end of the tender process with the builder to be assigned. Commencement of building works will occur early in Term 2. The access ramp between the Performing Arts Centre and Tennis Courts is nearing completion and will provide improved access for all students and staff to the oval.\n\nThe Bedford Rd Railway Crossing removal project will commence late this year with a reduction of access to Rosewarne Lane and Bedford Rd traffic impacted. Public information sessions have been held and more information will be provided prior to commencement of the project.\n\nThe naming of the Senior School building ‘YANNA MUDJIRR’ meaning ‘Stepping Stones’ is underway signalling the integral link to our Mullum Mullum indigenous heritage.\n\nOur college Open Night will be held next term, on May 3rd, and will showcase a range of student activities and performances, Junior and Senior School buildings and displays from all learning areas. Tours and two information sessions will be led by our student leaders together with our staff. I do look forward to this opportunity to meet potential students and their families. Details are available on our college website and bookings are essential.\n\nFinally, as this term comes to an end, I would like to extend my gratitude to both the Principal and Leadership teams for their great support and respected consultation. To all staff, I wish you a well-earned restful holiday and thank you for your hard work, resilience, determination, and perseverance. RSC students are very fortunate to have such professional teachers and support staff that care, nurture, and support you.\n\nTo every RSC student, you have shown what perseverance is displayed in your ability to show up each day, being considerate to your teachers and showing compassion and empathy to your peers. Enjoy a well-deserved Easter holiday!\n\nMaria Allison"
