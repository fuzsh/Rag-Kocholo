The relevant Principal of Junior School or Senior School will then contact you regarding your child’s application.\n\nPlease note: At this stage, we can only accept enrolments in Years 8 – 12 from ‘in zone’ applicants and siblings, as we have reached our enrolment capacity for 2024. We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.\n\nWe can accept enrolment requests for out-of-zone students starting 2025.\n\nEnrolment Enquiry Documentation\n\nEnrolment Enquiry Form\n\nEvidence for demonstrating permanent residential address\n\nEvidence of student’s name and date of birth\n\nAcademic report for the previous semester\n\nYear 7 Transition\n\nTours are conducted from February to May each year for prospective Year 7 students and their parents. Tours commence at 9.30am from the General Office and are approximately one hour in duration. Bookings are necessary, tour dates and the booking link are listed on the Home page.\n\nThe enrolment process begins in May when students submit their placement form to their primary school. Norwood also accepts Out of Zone placement requests at this time. In August placements are confirmed and students subsequently receive an enrolment pack.\n\nNorwood Secondary College zone is available on findmyschool.vic.gov.au which hosts the most up-to-date information about Victorian school zones for 2022 onwards.\n\nStudents residing in this zone are guaranteed a place at our school, which is determined on the basis of your permanent residential address.\n\nThe Department provides guidance through the School Placement Policy to ensure that students have access to their designated neighbourhood school and the freedom to choose other schools, subject to capacity.\n\nYou can find more information and answers to frequently asked questions on the Department’s website under School zones."
