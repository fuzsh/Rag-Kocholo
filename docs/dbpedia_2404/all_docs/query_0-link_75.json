Year 11 and 12 students undertake the VCE program. There are currently approximately 1460 students enrolled at the school.\n\nRSC offers an extensive range of Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) subjects as well as the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) programme. The college has developed a centre of excellence for Automotive, Engineering and Manufacturing.\n\nThe celebrated Music and Performing Arts Program at Ringwood Secondary College includes three concert bands, four stage bands, three string ensembles and two choirs. In recent competitions, Melbourne School Bands Festival, Mt Gambier Generations in Jazz and the Royal South Street Competition, the school has received awards for its stage bands, strings ensembles and symphonic orchestra.\n\nThe RSC Musical Production is a major highlight of the College Calendar each year. The full-scale theatrical event brings together students from all of the performing arts areas of the college. The professional shows draw crowds of over 3000 each year, with some students having gone on to successful careers both on stage and in the technical areas of theatre production."
