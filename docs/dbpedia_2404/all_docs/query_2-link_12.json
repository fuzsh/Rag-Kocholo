Most of our yearly intake is obviously in Foundation (Prep) but it’s also common for children to transfer from other schools into ours. Whichever level you are coming in – you will hear from the teachers within that level. We hope it will give you a great insight into what is on offer here at our wonderful school!\n\nFollow the links to our online tour.\n\nWe can’t wait to share our story with you!\n\nUpschool\n\nA community resource by Holy Spirit Community School, North Ringwood\n\nWe take education seriously.\n\nSo seriously in fact that we want to extend education beyond the classroom and have it filter into the community.\n\nOne of the foundations of strong communities with healthy people (both mind and body) is access to education.\n\nUpSchool is an online resource we invite you to explore, immerse in and be inspired by.\n\nThis free and growing resource is our way of sharing positive and inspiring messages that we feel will have a direct and positive impact on our community.\n\nSomething in here for all ages"
