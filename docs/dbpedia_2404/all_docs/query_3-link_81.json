        "text": "Award Winning Adventures\n\nIn 2024, the Go Ape Moors Valley Treetop Adventure Plus experience won the Gold Award from Dorset Tourism for \"Experience of the Year\".\n\nPacked full of excitement in the great outdoors, Treetop Adventure Plus is the place for confident youngsters to take their day out higher into the tree tops.\n\nWobbly crossings will put your skills to the test, as your Tribe journeys through the canopy. Then, it's even higher above the forest floor for your thrilling zip wire ride to that superhero feeling!\n\nTripadvisor Travelers' Choice Award Winner\n\nIn 2024 Go Ape Moors Valley was awarded the Tripadvisor Travelers' Choice Award. Here's a recent review:\n\n\"We came in May to do segaways with the family. This is our third time doing it and this was the best one yet. Furthest we've been with an instructor too! We had Will who was an amazing instructor who ensured that we had a fun, safe time as well as talking to us about where we were. Best experience ever with Go Ape and we'll certainly be back again in the summer.\"\n\nJess\n\nStay Nearby with Forest Holidays\n\nNot too far away from Go Ape at Moors Valley Country Park, Southampton, Alice Holt and Bracknell, cabins are nestled among tall beech trees in a corner of secluded forest. From woodland den building to marshmallow melting, surround yourself with nature in a cabin in the heart of one of Britain's beautiful forests.\n\nExplore the Hampshire countryside on riverside and forest walks; hike across the downs and stop off at quaint village pubs; climb hills and walk along chalkland ridges for fabulous views all the way down to the south coast."
