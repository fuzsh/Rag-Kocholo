        "text": "Dedicated in 1984, the garden is the culmination of two eras of landscape architecture under the direction of Francis Lynde Stetson, owner of Skylands from 1891 to 1922. The garden contains an extensive variety of plants, evergreens and deciduous trees and shrubs in specialty areas. Of particular interest are the crabapple vista, terraced gardens, perennial and annual gardens and woodland paths. The extensive vistas of the garden and view of Ramapo Mountains frame this 96-acre botanical showplace. Visitors can tour the gardens and surrounding woods year round.\n\nFrom the delicate shades of a tiny wildflower to the vibrant colors of massed annual plantings, Skylands is a place of beauty in any season. Here you can wander through the elegance of formal gardens or along gentle paths winding through the woods. Skylands is also a safe haven for unusual plant species from around the world.\n\nThe NJBG/Skylands Assocation is a member-supported, non-profit organization of volunteers founded in 1976 to help the state of New Jersey preserve and restore the gardens and Manor House, and to develop programs for public education and enjoyment throughout the year.\n\nPicnics, barbecues, blankets, lawn chairs, lawn games, and ball playing are not permitted in the Skylands section of the park. For these activities, please visit either the Ringwood Manor or Shepherd Lake picnic areas.\n\nThis beautiful country house, which was home for a succession of well-known iron masters for nearly 200 years, sits comfortably on a low hill overlooking a landscape that looks as if it escaped from a painting. Iron production in this area began in the 1740s. In the mid-19 century, Peter Cooper and Abram S. Hewitt, owners of the successful Cooper and Hewitt Ironworks Company, owned Ringwood Manor. Their families utilized the 51-room Victorian mansion as a summer residence. In 1938, Ringwood Manor was donated fully-furnished to the state of New Jersey. It is now preserved and interpreted as a historic house museum. Ringwood Manor has been designated a National Historic Landmark District.\n\nTours of Ringwood Manor are generally available Wednesday through Sunday from April through October. Groups of 10 or more or with special accommodation requests should call at least two weeks in advance in order to schedule a tour. Information on Ringwood Manorâs history, tours, events, and educational programming can be found through the North Jersey Highlands Historical Society (link if external).\n\nFor more information visit Ringwood Manor web page.\n\nSkylands Manor, with its English Jacobean architecture common in the English countryside 400 years ago, was designed by John Russell Pope for Clarence McKenzie Lewis, a stockbroker and civil engineer. Built in the 1920s, it is constructed of native stone and half-timbers. The weathered stone facade of this 44-room mansion blends into the landscape. The mansion contains rooms with antique paneling as well as new American Oak paneling and large windows, some of which contain 16th-century stained glass medallions. Molded plaster ceilings and an elaborately carved staircase add the finishing touches to this impressive country house.\n\nTours and special events are offered through the NJBG/Skylands Association (link is external).\n\nSkylands Manor is available for weddings and special events hosted by Frungillo Caterers (link is external).\n\nTrail Map\n\nBiking\n\nThe park's multiuse trails offer a variety of terrain for the adventurous biker. Shepherd Lake and Skylands Parking Lot C are good starting points for mountain bikers to park and access the trails. While the majority of the park's trails are geared toward mountain biking, visitors may enjoy biking along sections of gravel carriage roads in the Ringwood Manor and Skylands areas, or along the paved park roads through the Skylands Botanical Gardens.\n\nCross-Country Skiing\n\nThe grounds and trails in the Ringwood Manor and Shepherd Lake areas offer numerous opportunities for cross country skiing in the winter, however, there are no groomed trails and there are no rentals available.\n\nHiking\n\nHiking trails are accessible from all three sections of the park and cover a variety of terrain. Trail maps and trail guides for some of the more popular trails are available online and in the park office.\n\nHorseback Riding\n\nHorseback riding is a popular activity on the park's multiuse trail system. Parking for horse trailers and access for the trails is available from the main lot at Shepherd Lake, with trail access from behind the boathouse or from Parking Lot C in the Skylands Section.\n\nSnowmobiling\n\nThe multiuse trail system offers a unique opportunity for snowmobile enthusiasts. Parking and access for the trails is available from the main lot at Shepherd Lake, with trial access from behind the boathouse, or from Parking Lot C in the Skylands section. Operators and passengers must wear helmets and maintain safe speeds at all times. Snowmobiles are not permitted on any body of water within the park.\n\nActivities that fall outside the normal park uses outlined above may require a Special Use Permit and are subject to approval. Some of the more frequent permits issued have shortform versions below. Please see the individual applications for more information.\n\nPaid / Professional Photography This permit is required for photographers who are taking pictures for clients within the park for their personal use PRIOR to any scheduled shoots. Examples include wedding and engagement shoots, prom photos, holiday card photos, or any other instance in which a photographer is being paid for their service, but the photography itself is not being used commercially. Shoots involving equipment, props, or otherwise interfering with normal park operations may also be subject to the permit process.\n\nRingwood Manor Garden Ceremony Small wedding ceremonies are permitted in designated areas of the Ringwood Manor grounds.\n\nBrushwood Permit This permit grants vehicle access to the system of fire roads in the wooded areas adjacent to Skylands for the purposes of fishing or hunting only.\n\nSlash Wood Permit This permit allows the permitholder to take downed wood from designated areas for their own personal use.\n\nEvents or activities that require a permit but do not fall into the above categories would likely require the full Special Use Permit application package. Examples include adventure races, filming for movies and TV, paid classes (dog training, art, etc.) taught in the park, car shows, concerts, or other organized group events.\n\nPlease contact the park office if you think your event might require a permit.\n\nActivities that fall outside the normal park uses outlined above may require a Special Use Permit, and are subject to approval. Please contact the park office for more information.\n\nAll-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs)\n\nRecreational use of ATVs is not permitted on NJ State Park Service property.

Whatever you carry into the park, plan on carrying it out too. Itâs like crowdsourcing trash management! Bring a bag or two for trash, recycling and cleaning up after your pet. There are no trash receptacles in this park. Thank you!\n\nSwimming\n\nNo swimming.\n\nPets\n\nPets must always be on a leash no longer than six feet in length and under the control of the owner. Please clean up after your pets.\n\nTick Protection\n\nUse insect repellent, wear light-colored clothing, tuck pants into socks, stay on trails, check yourself when you get home, shower and wash clothes immediately.\n\nBe Bear Aware\n\nBlack bears are found throughout New Jersey.

To report an aggressive bear, call 1-877-WARN-DEP (1-877-927-6337) immediately. Please report any damage or nuisance behavior to the park office.
