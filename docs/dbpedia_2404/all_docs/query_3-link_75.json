        "text": "2024/25 Season: Funding Eligibility Form now open\n\nWe are pleased to confirm that our Funding Eligibility Form for UEFA C Licence courses in the 2024/25 season is now open.\n\nAs part of our changes for the coming season, this is how you can check whether you’re eligible for a Partially Funded Place.\n\nWe also recommend you complete this form if you’re currently coaching at a Grassroots Affiliated club, as you may be entitled to a discount. You will be required to provide your clubs National Club ID number so please make sure you have this to hand.\n\nTo get started and check your eligibility, please use the form below.\n\nFunding Eligibility Form\n\nThe Funding Eligibility Form will be open from Thursday 1 August 2024 and will close on Wednesday 14 August at 11:59pm.\n\nCompleting this form is optional and will not affect your ability to take part on any UEFA C Licence course.\n\nWe will inform all learners who complete this form whether they have been awarded funding in September 2024.\n\nEnrolment changes for the 2024/25 season\n\nWe've made changes to the way coaches secure places on next season's UEFA C Licence courses. For the 2024-25 season, the following changes are taking place:\n\nMore places available - You will have access to twice the number of UEFA C Licence places, giving you a greater chance of securing a place.\n\nOngoing release of courses during the season – We intend to release courses gradually on the England Football Learning website during the season, rather than releasing courses in bulk on specific dates like last season. Where courses/areas sell out, we will aim to release further courses in a timely manner. The first set of courses will be open for booking from August 2024 and further courses will be released during the season. We recommend you keep checking the website for the latest courses as we will not be promoting new courses when they get released.\n\nNo more applications -You no longer need to submit a course application. You can book directly onto any course of your choice through the new open booking process via the England Football Learning website.\n\nNew price - The price of UEFA C Licence is now £650. However, you will still be able to access a discount if you currently coach at a Grassroots Affiliated club. This will reduce the price to £550.\n\nNew Partially Funded Places Programme - Our previous fully funded places scheme has been replaced with a partially funded scheme. If you’re eligible, you’ll only need to pay 15% towards the cost of the course and England Football Learning will pay the remaining 85%.\n\nNew Funding Eligibility Form - To apply for a partially funded place or a grassroots affiliated discount on the UEFA C Licence in the 24/25 season you will need to complete our new Funding Eligibility Form. This will be available through our website on the UEFA C Licence course page.\n\nThe Funding Eligibility Form will open for two-weeks at the beginning of every month during the first part of the season. This means you’ll have multiple opportunities to check if you’re eligible for a discount on the UEFA C Licence course in the coming season.\n\nAll coaches who are eligible for a discount will be contacted at the end of each month.\n\nFor more information on our Funding Eligibility Form or any of the other updatesplease see our FAQs here.\n\nYou can view our UEFA C Licence course policy here.\n\nWe’re hoping these changes will improve the process and allow more coaches to secure a place on the UEFA C Licence in 2024-25.\n\nWe are expecting demand to be high which will likely put pressure on our booking system. If you experience any system issues, please be patient whilst we work to resolve them. We will make sure enrolment is back available as quickly as possible.\n\nAbout the course\n\nDelivered through a blend of virtual and face-to-face learning, our expert Coach Developers will guide you through the UEFA C Licence, supporting you as you tailor it to your players.\n\nThe course will provide you with practical resources and signpost you to future learning to help you continue to develop as a coach.\n\nThe course will last for approximately 16-20 weeks, supporting the principles of spaced learning and giving you the opportunity to reflect and practice what you’ve learnt in real-time.\n\nThis course has replaced The FA Level 2 in Coaching Football.\n\nReasonable adjustments\n\nTo request a reasonable adjustment on this course, please follow this link.\n\nDownload a copy of our Reasonable Adjustments Policy."
