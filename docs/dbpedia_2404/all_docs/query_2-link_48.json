        "text": "In order to demonstrate eligibility applicants are required to provide:\n\nDriver’s Licenses, Permits, Passports, Voter registrations, School/College ID, Employee ID, or other photo identification, valid or expired, that has been issued by a public entity or private third party.\n\nAnd one or more of the following:\n\nProperty tax bills; deeds; contracts of sale; leases; mortgages; signed letters from landlords; and other evidence of property ownership, tenancy, or residency;\n\nFinancial account information; utility bills; delivery receipts; and other evidence of personal attachment to a particular location;\n\nCourt orders; State agency agreements; and other evidence of court or agency placements or directives;\n\nReceipts; bills; cancelled checks; insurance claims or payments; and other evidence of expenditures demonstrating personal attachment to a particular location or to support the test taker\n\nMedical reports; counselor or social worker assessments; employment documents; unemployment claims; benefit statements; and other evidence of circumstances demonstrating family or economic hardship, or temporary residency;\n\nAffidavits, certifications, and sworn attestations pertaining to statutory criteria from the parent, guardian, person keeping an “affidavit student,\" adult student, person(s) with whom a family is living, or others, as appropriate;\n\nDocuments pertaining to military status and assignment; and\n\nAny other business record or document issued by a governmental entity.\n\nVendor (Test) Cost\n\n(Non-Refundable) Fee per Subtest\n\nNote: GED allows two free retests if taken within the same calendar year. Test centers can charge the administrative fee above based on whether they retest on the complete battery or a single subset. After the two free retests are taken in a calendar year, any other retests will include the test vendor subtest fee as well as an administrative fee.\n\nIf a school or employer requires you to obtain a higher total score or a higher score on specific sections of the test,\n\nyou may retest even after you have passed the GED. However, the test center and the NJDOE need written\n\nverification from the employer or school requesting the higher score. Any new scores will be updated on your\n\ntranscript.\n\nThe following public libraries are allowing adults who do not have access to a computer/laptop at home, to come in and take the GED online test at their facility. You must contact the library to find out when they allow the testing to take place.\n\nThe libraries are not a GED testing center but are offering the space to take the GED online test. You can find out more about the GED online test at https://ged.com/take-the-ged-test-online/ . To take the GED subject tests online, you must pass a GED ready test for each subject test. The cost of each GED ready test is $6.99. The cost of each GED subject test is $36.00. You need to pass the four subject tests (Language Arts, math, science, and social studies) to earn a State-issued diploma.\n\nReminder: For those who are 16 and 17 years of age, a Consent to Participate form must be completed and taken to a test center for the Chief Examiner to sign the form and lift the hold.\n\nBergen County\n\nBergenfield Public Library\n\n50 West Clinton Ave\n\nBergenfield, NJ 07621\n\nContact: John Capps\n\nPhone: 201-387-4040 ext. 2845 Email: jcapps@bergenfieldlibrary.org\n\nFree Public Library of Hasbrouck Heights\n\n320 Boulevard (second floor of Municipal Bldg),â¯Hasbrouck Heights, NJ 07604\n\nContact: Laura Rios - Head of Adult Services or Mimi Hui – Library Director\n\nPhone: 201-288-0484, main number; 201-288-6653 – Laura Rios\n\nEmail: reference@hasbrouckheights.bccls.org\n\nBurlington County\n\nBurlington County Library\n\n5 Pioneer Blvd\n\nWestampton, NJ 08060\n\nContact: Naju Johnson\n\nPhone: 609-267-9660 ext. 3050 Email: njohnson@bcls.lib.nj.us\n\nMoorestown Library\n\n111 West Second Street\n\nMoorestown, NJ 08057\n\nContact: Joanne Parra\n\nPhone:856-234-0333 ext. 4011\n\nEmail: jparra@moorestownlibrary.org\n\nWillingboro Public Library\n\n220 Willingboro Parkway\n\nWillingboro, NJ 08046\n\nContact: Paulette Doe-Williams\n\nPhone: 609-877-6668\n\nEmail: wipl@willingboro.org\n\nCamden County\n\nPennsauken Free Public Library\n\n5605 N.
