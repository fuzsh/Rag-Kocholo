        "text": "The euphoric concept that everyone is special and everyone is a winner, even though no commitment and effort is made by the so called \"special\", creates delusive sense of victory. This leads to a dopamine addiction which everyone must get every now and then to feel good. This habit after some time, becomes a routine requirement amd sense of entitlement to get a quick appreciation without genuine effort. In the long term, this creates an army of narcissistic citizens who are used to a 'certificate of attendance'. In the long term such \"baseless winning\" prevents the need for grit and consistent efforts to achieve anything significant and meaningful since the mental reward system that push us to perform consistently towards a certain goal would have already received its dopamine. This is dangerous and one of the biggest inhibitor in the way of realising one's TRUE POTENTIAL. Agree?\n\nAbsolutely correct. Don‚Äôt waste your vote on an Independent candidate - only 1 team can truly win, it‚Äôs either R or D for the W and it‚Äôs not about the man (or woman), it‚Äôs actually about which PARTY and the ideology they collectively represent. Who should you vote for? Easy! One only need decide which PARTY you hate the least: The team who loves to tax&spend, has given record amounts of taxpayer monies to foreign governments, has driven every aspect of the US economy into the dumpster and set it on fire, who has sold out to China, has allowed our S border to be infiltrated by millions, who has caused historically record inflation and gas prices even higher than under Obama‚Äôs reign. OR The team who fostered a strong domestic economy with record LOW gas prices, increased US oil production (not relying on countries who detest us for oil); who stood up for the US and the American people on many levels (withdrawal from the TPP, renegotiated NAFTA [USMCA], stood up to Russia, N Korea and China, the list goes on - your mileage may vary. Like I said, it‚Äôs not who you like the most but it‚Äôs actually which PARTY you hate the least. Only YOU can decide that for yourself. Go!\n\nIt was an honor to serve as Keynote Speaker for the Class of 2024 at Clarksburg High School. One key message I would like all to take with them along their journey, ... \"Be who you are and be that well.‚Äù I have reminded every class of students of the following words: ‚ÄúBe careful of your thoughts because your thoughts become your words; Be careful of your words because your words become your actions; Be careful of your actions because your actions become your habits; Be careful of your habits because your habits become your character; Be careful of your character because your character becomes your destiny.‚Äù But if you can‚Äôt remember all that, just remember four words. Be Good. Do Good. BE ‚Äì Good. DO ‚Äì Good. Listen to the full speech here... (go to 1:36:00)\n\nSummer is a great time to make the most of college visits. If the East Coast is on your radar, consider visiting NYC and checking all types of colleges off your list. From #IvyLeague #NationalUniversities to small #liberalarts colleges, #NYC is excellent for helping you figure out what kind of college suits you. Not to mention making the most of a trip with pizza, theater, and historical monuments! Our top tip: if you can register for a tour, do! Attendance of official tours and visits is a form of demonstrated interest. #collegeapplications #collegeapplicationseason #highschool #sat #application #highereducation #senior #educationmatters #onlinecourse #collegeadmissions #collegeprep #collegebound #admissions #studentsuccess #testprep #satprep #collegeready #admission #highschoolsenior #collegecounseling #collegecounselor #collegeadvice #collegeplanning #collegeapps #collegeessay #collegeapplication #collegepreparation #collegetips #applyingtocollege #collegeadvisor\n\nOur Head of Admissions Lindi Smit had the pleasure of sitting down with David Bell from the PCD GROUP to give an overview of our school in which she shares essential information that sets us apart.

Now, I'm passionate about supporting and advocating for community college student-athletes. That's why I pursued my Masters in College Counseling and Student Development ‚Äì to give back to students aiming for higher education and athletic success.
