        "text": "Sleek, sophisticated and premium – the three keywords that were prerequisites when we redesigned the website on our latest project feature: the newly launched site for Urbanity Premium Detailing. We were ecstatic to work on such a dynamic project alongside the Urbanity team and rebuild a new website from the ground up that best represents their quality of work and craftsmanship. Stay tuned for more to come as we continue to show this one off!\n\nHappy Friday! This final post concludes our showcase of the Yarra Ranges Tech School website. It was an absolute pleasure working with the YRTS team to design, develop and deploy their new website, and we can't wait to see how they continue to expand upon it in the future with the foundations that we put in place. If you would like to explore more of the project, visit our website and see our portfolio, or go to the YRTS website to experience it for yourself. Stay tuned for the next project that we'll be showcasing from next week – it's one that we can't wait to share with our community. The Project: https://lnkd.in/gaDmKrJS The Site: https://lnkd.in/gr_H54ar\n\nContent management can be a challenging task for larger organisations that have very busy schedules and many regular updates that they need to publish to their website to notify the community. On some websites, the content can only be updated by a developer or somebody that has the technical know-how to operate the backend of the site. For the Yarra Ranges Tech School website, we streamlined the process to ensure everything on the website is editable with a user-friendly, drag-and-drop content editor. This eliminates the learning curve for updating content and allows users of all technical skill levels to make instant updates to the website, right when they need them.\n\nWhen working within the education space, there's many essential aspects that must be considered throughout the design stage, but one of the most important considerations is ensuring accessibility for as many users as possible. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) covers a broad range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for vision impaired, limited movement, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations. Across the Yarra Ranges Tech School - Box Hill Institute website, we utilise various WCAG checks to enhance accessibility for users. It's often a challenge to balance the aesthetic design components with accessibility user experience considerations, but we love a good challenge and always strive to produce the best results for our clients and their unique users.\n\nAcross the new Yarra Ranges Tech School - Box Hill Institute website, we integrated various segments into the site to allow users to navigate to the areas that are most relevant to them. This has been done by creating four core areas of the site – Schools, Partners, Community & Media. Each core segment has it's own content that is most relevant to that audience type. This allows the tech school to share relevant information with school users, industry partners, the broader Yarra Ranges community, and an outlet for general media content. The key benefit of this is that industry partners don't need to deep dive through school-related content, and the general community can easily access public events and news without sorting through everything else. As a result, this website contains many different CMS types throughout the site and a range of advanced filters, custom fields and a complex sitemap containing hundreds of pages. Navigating the site is a breeze though, as the user-interface (UI) has been designed for optimal user-experience (UX). Check it out for yourself today! https://bit.ly/3QukaD2\n\nKicking off the latest project feature with a website designed for Yarra Ranges Tech School - Box Hill Institute! We were tasked with giving the old website a complete re-design whilst keeping the overall layout simple and user friendly for both adults and students. One of the important factors was considering all of the different segments for schools, partners, community and media related users, so we factored this into the entire infrastructure of the site. More info on this soon...\n\nWith over 30% of people accessing our website via mobile devices, the new Spacey Studios website needed to be designed in a way that allows users to have a positive experience across smaller screens. We built and tested this site with the intention of maximizing usability, improving navigation and increasing the performance, readability and simplicity for mobile users. Additionally, this was done while tying it all in together with the desktop design for a completely cohesive site optimised for all devices. Explore the new site for yourself!\n\nWhen designing the new Spacey Studios website, one of the most important considerations was the ease of use across all device types. Whether a user is exploring the site on Desktop, Tablet or Mobile, we’ve built the site with a user friendly style that provides a positive experience for all. Focusing on a modern, clean style makes the content easy to digest and navigate across each platform. Check it out for yourself today!\n\nIt's finally here! We are excited to present our latest in-house project - the brand new Spacey Studios website! This has been in the making for quite some time, spanning over 130 hours over the past 6 months. The project is a result of perfecting all of our specialties and design techniques to demonstrate them to you in one of our favourite services - web design. Check it out and let us know what you think! Be sure to explore the site on both Desktop & Mobile devices to see the visual differences across the fully responsive design.
