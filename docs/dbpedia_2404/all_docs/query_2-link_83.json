        "text": "2023 Vision Continues\n\nOur vision at Emerald Secondary College is ‘Engagement’. We strive to enable and equip all our young learners to reach their full potential. The vision is underpinned by a community that is willing to learn and grow together. We want our learners to display positive school behaviours:\n\nSet high expectations for themselves\n\nEngage proactively in their class\n\nComplete their school work\n\nBe curious and enquiring learners\n\nBuild strong, valuable, healthy relationships\n\nBuild strong mental and physical wellbeing\n\nGet involved in all the extra-curricular programs the school has to offer\n\nAs we continue to grow and develop together, we will reinforce our message to our students and to our broader community, using a few improvement strategies, processes and procedures to bring our vision to life.\n\nRespect for each other is a non-negotiable value at our college, and at the core of everything we do.\n\nSchool Facilities\n\nStage One of college upgrade is now complete, and students are enjoying working and learning in the new spaces. A Block, Food, new staffrooms, new toilets, and a new resource centre make our college look amazing. I ask all students to take care of all our facilities.\n\nNAPLAN preparations\n\nOur school preparations for NAPLAN continue. NAPLAN is the once every two years literacy and numeracy testing for all students in Australia, for our secondary school students that occurs in Year 7 and Year 9. It is used as a measure of student progress and allows schools to target further support, along with our own internal testing and teacher judgement based on student needs.\n\nNAPLAN will be held in the coming weeks, having been moved forward to March from its usual scheduling in May.\n\nOur staff have been working with students and supporting them with activities that provide NAPLAN like tasks, with a particular focus for our Year 7 and 9 students on reading, writing and numeracy tasks. Thank you to Ms Janine McMahon and Ms Tiana Clayworth for all their work in setting up the testing.\n\nConsistent Attendance – Every Lesson – Every Day\n\nMichael Grose has said, ‘When young people miss school, not only is their academic progress impeded, forcing them to catch up on missed work (which some never do), they often miss important interactions with their peers which can compound issues of social isolation and low self-esteem. One of the most important things you can do to ensure your child has a bright future is to make sure they go to school every day (and get there on time). It sounds simple and it’s true. The correlation between school attendance and children’s achievement levels is well established. The more time kids spend at school, the more likely they are to experience school success.’\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=michael+grose+on+attendance&oq=michael+grose+on+attendance&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2.9236j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=No.%201%20parenting,%E2%80%BA%20Documents%20%E2%80%BA%20in…\n\nOf course, most people know this intuitively, yet school absenteeism is a problem – and much of it is parent-condoned. If a student misses an average of 12 and 15 days per school year, that adds up to a year’s lost schooling over the school-life of a child. In today’s highly competitive world, this rate of absenteeism is alarming, putting our young people at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nCollege Uniform\n\nThe Puffa jacket is in, and the soft shell jacket is out.\n\nWhilst the soft shell jacket is still part of school uniform, it is not warm enough for the winter Emerald clime.\n\nThe College is holding some limited stock of the soft shell jacket, and once it is distributed to certain departments in the school, some limited sizes will be available for purchase at a heavily discounted price from the front office – please watch Compass, as we organise our stock.\n\nUniform expectations have not changed and I am pleased to report that most of our students look exemplary! We will continue to work closely with some students who choose not to wear our uniform. Measures will be supportive, aligning with college expectations and student voice and agency.\n\nPlease make sure that if there are any issues with uniform and you need support that you contact the relevant Learning Engagement Leader.\n\nJames Barut – College Principal\n\nCurriculum and Assessment\n\nOur students have settled into the school year and the teaching and learning program. Senior students have either undertaken a practice school assessed coursework task, followed by a SAC, or are about to. We have had several students remain after school to collaborate with their peers in preparation for these tasks.\n\nJunior students have been working on their course and classwork tasks and will be soon undertaking their first common assessment tasks.\n\nWe are observing some amazing creativity in Middle Years Electives. Including the design of fighter jets for 3D printing and ceramic shoe creation!\n\nProgress reports have been completed by teachers and can be accessed on the parent portal on compass on Friday at 4pm. Unfortunately, there are still some classes without a consistent teacher. Even though these classes are being supported by ESC staff in a number of ways, unfortunately, the completion of progress reports for these classes have not been possible for this cycle of progress reports.\n\nNAPLAN\n\nOur year seven and nine student undertook practice NAPLAN tasks recently. Students were able to undertake a small writing and numeracy task in a relaxed time frame which allowed them to familiarise themselves with the online NAPLAN portal. Any technical issues were resolved, and students will be able to feel more knowledgeable and confident as they approach their upcoming NAPLAN tasks.\n\nBuilding and Grounds\n\nWe have come to the end of our capital works program with the opening of A Block at the start of the term. We have been busily adding some finishing touches to rooms such as installing projectors, speakers, and plants in planter boxes in the corridors and library. We are currently researching the replacement of some of our existing furniture in some of our teaching spaces to further brighten up and make the rooms a comfortable learning environment for our students and staff.\n\nA Block is also known as our Year 7 centre, where Year 7 students are located for the majority of their classes when a specialist room is not required. The building program has provided us with designated spaces for lockers at either end of the building. This has seen a reduction in congestion to the alternative of having the entire cohort of students together with their lockers in the corridor. The alteration to the building plan has also allowed the architects to provide break out spaces for flexible learning opportunities within the corridor of A block and also in some of the classrooms.\n\nStudents (and staff) have been enjoying our shiny new food technology kitchens. The new building designs have not only been a well needed upgrade to facilities, but with windows into the classrooms, we can now see the learning in action from outside the classroom. As I write, students are finishing up creating banana bread. Some wonderful aromas could be detected!\n\nWe have been busily maintaining our grounds and garden beds, including spreading mulch, trimming and pruning greenery, and feel very lucky to have such a wonderful garden on a school site. We have also finalised another round of bushfire mitigation work around the boundary of the College.\n\nThe Vocational Major students have been tending to the kitchen garden space. With the help of Rotary who have donated some funds to help regenerate this space into a thriving space again.\n\nWe have recently acquired a grant for a shade sail and have been seeking quotes for this work to begin also.\n\nWe thank our building and grounds team for all their work they do for our college community.\n\nBEST\n\nRecently in BEST, many of our students engaged in Mindmapping as part of our sessions on study and research skills. Mindmapping is an easy way to brainstorm thoughts organically – it allows students to visually structure ideas to help with analysis and recall. The mindmap diagrap represents words or concepts that link to a central subject. It’s a highly organised diagram that works in line with the brain’s natural way of doing things.\n\nStudents came up with some incredibly original, creative and thorough mindmaps on a subject of their choice.\n\nSpecial mention is made of the following students who produced terrific mindmaps:\n\nCharlize Wallace 8G\n\nKiara Flavel 12D\n\nAlice Nielson 10A\n\nMonique Fabien 10A\n\nCharlie Eyssens 10A\n\nIzzy Adams 12D\n\nThese students will receive a canteen voucher. Congratulations and keep mindmapping – it’s a great study and revision strategy!\n\nSenior Subschool students have been spending some time discussing and looking at self-care.\n\nHere are some of the self-care practice some Year 11 students have committed themselves to in the coming weeks:\n\nPlay and listen to music\n\nGo to Gym everyday\n\nLimit phone use\n\nHave good rest periods where I can relax and reset\n\nLess procrastination about homework just get on and do it\n\nGet better at chess\n\nSave money\n\nLive, Love, Laugh\n\nGo to training\n\nGo on more walks\n\nI promise to eat properly\n\nGet enough Sleep\n\nWe commend and encourage all of our students to balance their school, work, and social commitments and prioritise their own self-care. “Self-care is any activity that we do deliberately in order to take care of our mental, emotional and physical health. Although it’s a simple concept in theory, it’s something we very often overlook. Good self-care is key to improved mood and reduced anxiety. It’s also key to a good relationship with oneself and others.“ (Psych Central).\n\nStudent Leadership\n\nWe were (delightfully!) inundated with interest from students from Years 7-12 for our new Student Leadership roles, and positions of responsibility. Many of our staff will be leading crews/teams of students in interest-based areas across the College and have created positions especially for students to lead, exercise their voice and contribute significantly to the success of college events, activities and progression in each of these areas.\n\nIt is my pleasure to announce the following recipients – students will also be acknowledged in a special Investiture Ceremony led by our College Captains Ethan Crosher, Caiti Ellis, Hayley Marshall and Jackson Acott, and their parents/carers will be invited.\n\nStudent Leadership Positions\n\nSRC Leaders – Keilah Dewar Yr11, Jayden Regan Yr8\n\nSRC Assistant Leaders – Ebony Ellis & Lacie-Joy McMahon, Yr7\n\nYear 7 Leaders – Jazzy Rule & Lani Bach\n\nYear 8 Leaders – Liam Sharp & Ellie Hastings\n\nYear 10 Leader – Milla Boyd\n\nYear 11 Leader – Cadence Tyrrell\n\nJunior Subschool Leader – Claire Aspinall\n\nCommunications Team – Safi Drummond Yr7 & Daniel McAllister Yr 12\n\nGeysen House Leader – Darcy Langhorrne Yr8\n\nGreetham House Leader – Sydney Neilson Yr8\n\nJeffreys House Leader – Kaylee Loguidice Yr12\n\nONeil House Leader – Lily Cochrane Yr11\n\nPortfolio Representative Positions\n\nAmbassadors – Ebony Ellis, Ellie Hastings, Jayden Regan, Lani Bach, Milla Boyd, Safi Drummond, Olivia Ellis\n\nArts – Aidan Bailey, Ebony Ellis, Lily Cochrane, Matilda Forsythe, Taesha Korsten, Xavier Soeteman\n\nAstronomy – Christine Burgess, Lily Forster, Noah McKenzie, Robert Jackson, Ruby Emmott, Sienna Connolly, Xavier Hole\n\nCommunity Service – Olivia Ellis, Taesha Korsten\n\nEnvironmental Pride – Nami Nguyen, Liam Sharp\n\neSports – Cooper Wade Moran, Lachie Duncan, Noah Grant, Thomas Morelli\n\nHPV – Harry Closter, Lily Cochrane\n\nInfo Tech – Cooper Wade Moran, Thomas Morelli, William Grenness, William Latter\n\nKitchen Garden – Akira Petterson, Elly Stopford, Maddi Roach, Willow Glidden\n\nMaintenance – William Grenness, Jack Spry\n\nMusic – Jacob Hennig, Claire Aspinall, Keilah Dewar, Lily Forster, Nicky Closter\n\nPeer Support – Ellie Hastings, Ethan Crosher, Kai Hughes\n\nProduction – Ellie Hastings, Amelia Walker, Charlize Wallace, Jazzy Rule, Lily Forster, Lucy Frauenfelder, Matilda Forsythe, Olivia Ellis, Tamsyn Penketh, Ruby Emmott, Sally Hope\n\nRadio – Akira Petterson, Angus Devenish, Joe Stonyer, Rhys Nickell, Rose Harris, Willow Glidden\n\nRespectful Relationships – Mollie Harmer\n\nSports – Chelsea Mainnie, Gemma Whyte, Lily Cochrane, Nate Turner, Sydney Neilson\n\nTheatre Tech – Jude Penketh, Lucas Bramich, Jeremy Doyle, Sienna Connolly\n\nTransition – Amelia Walker, Ellie Hastings, Lucas Bramich, Maddi Roach, Milla Boyd, Taesha Korsten\n\nLots of Socks Day\n\nWorld Down Syndrome Day is coming up on 21st March.\n\nEmerald Secondary College look forward to acknowledging this Day and would like to encourage all students and staff to celebrate and help raise awareness by wearing mismatched and/or colourful socks to school along with their college uniform. The idea behind the Lots of Socks initiative is that all types, shapes, and sizes of the same thing can be unique in their own way. No two socks are the same! This is a campaign to create conversation around diversity, uniqueness, inclusion and acceptance.\n\nDown Syndrome is a genetic condition – not an illness or disease. It occurs because of an extra chromosome – that’s all! This extra chromosome results in a range of physical characteristics, health and developmental indications and some level of intellectual disability. Although it is known how Down syndrome happens, it is not yet known why it happens. It’s nobody’s fault, there is no cure and it does not go away. At Emerald Secondary College we have two magnificent students with Down Syndrome who both love music, love to perform and love to share a smile and be included in college life. In BEST lessons in Week 9, we will be talking about what makes us all unique – about inclusion and how we can all help each other to feel included.\n\nWear your brightest, most colourful and unique socks to school on World Down Syndrome Day – 21st March!\n\nUniform – New Puffa Jacket\n\nESC new Puffer jacket is now ready for purchase at PSW. All sizes are available in store and online. The soft-shell jackets are being phased out due to a much warmer option required for our students during cooler months. A consultation process with parents and students was undertaken during this change over process.\n\nAfter our initial stocktake some remaining soft-shell jackets will still be up for sale, at the College.\n\nLimited sizes apply.\n\nYear 7 Coffee Morning Tea\n\nThe Junior School Team is hosting a ‘Coffee Catch-Up’ morning for Year 7 parents. We would love to see you there! Coffee and light refreshments will be provided on Thursday March 16 from 9:15am – 10:00am in the canteen. Please sign in at the general office on arrival.\n\nUse the link below to RSVP, we look forward to seeing you again.\n\nhttps://form.jotform.com/230298909110051\n\nEmerald Secondary College School Tours\n\nSchool tours run every Wednesday morning at 10.15am.\n\nTo book please click the link below.\n\nBook a School Tour Here\n\nAlternatively, please scan the QR code below:\n\nWe also offer School Tours for prospective Select Entry Accelerated Learning (SEAL) parents/students Wednesday at 11.30am.

A lot of change has occurred within the last 7 weeks, and the Senior Sub School commend our Year 10 cohort for the efforts they have brought academically.\n\nPart of the change included moving the Year 10 cohort to be part of the Senior Sub School to encourage the academic standards at a senior level. Year 10s have been encouraged to become leaders of their learning and have shown immense resilience to build respectful relationships with their teachers and fellow peers.\n\nNew Middle Years Electives\n\nObservations and visits have been completed in our new middle-year program electives and there are happy reports of engagement in the classroom from both teachers and students.\n\nStudents have been busy in their chosen elective subjects whether that be baking pies or completing some coding to create a virtual game.\n\nYear 10 students have been collaborating with their Year 9 peers in these classrooms and it has been illuminating to observe the positive role models they can be.\n\nGeneral College Expectations\n\nWhole cohort assemblies have been conducted where students have been reminded about college expectations surrounding; uniform, attendance, respect and being ready to learn. The Senior School office works hard to ensure that students are supported in these areas, although as always students are strongly reminded and encouraged to take responsibility for the best opportunities in their learning.\n\nMaintaining the theme of respect has been a strong theme in conversations with Year 10 students, whether that be one on one or projected at an assembly. The Senior School has awarded students for 98% and above attendance and for showing positive learning behaviours each week. We hope that this recognition does not go unnoticed and shows how immensely proud the senior school is of Year 10s.\n\nCoursework Checks\n\nYear 10s are now senior students which implies that there are high expectations regarding completing learning tasks and submitting work requirements for assessment on time. Students have been re-taught study and organisational techniques within their BEST lessons and are encouraged to reflect on these within their classes. Coursework checks are being conducted by Year 10 teachers and will be followed up to ensure that students are staying up to date with work posted on Compass. If students do fall behind, coursework ‘catch up’ sessions will be held outside of classroom time to maintain and support student learning.\n\nAll coursework is listed on Compass under ‘Learning Tasks’ can be identified via the orange Assignment tab.\n\nIf parents or guardians have any queries on coursework, the Senior School are always open to discuss and chat.\n\nWe look forward for the rest of the year to come and know that there are only more positive movements to come!\n\nJack Talbot (Senior School Leader), Grace Sleit and Liam McManus (Year 10 Learning Engagement Leaders)\n\nOpportunity to take part in a research study – 2 x free cognitive assessments for your child\n\nEmerald Secondary College is participating in a new research study. Qualified researchers will provide two free neuropsychological assessments to participating students. Families will also receive a free report for each session. These reports will assist in better understanding how students think & learn and how their thinking skills develop. More details below.\n\nTanja Korsten\n\nDear Parent/Guardian,\n\nI am writing to let you know about a new research study being run by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, The Royal Children’s Hospital and The University of Melbourne. You and your child may be interested in taking part in this project.\n\nYou might also like to view The COGNITION Study Animated Video which provides a visual summary of what it means for you and your child to be involved in this research project. The video can be accessed via the following website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyCFrEDy64U, or by scanning the following QR code:\n\nWhat is this project about?\n\nWe are inviting you and your child take part in a research project called The COGNITION Study.\n\nCognition or cognitive development are words that we use to explain how you think, explore and figure things out. This can include tasks such as learning, memory and attention.\n\nWe will be using a cognitive assessment called the CANTAB to collect information about children’s cognition. The CANTAB stands for Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, it is owned by a company overseas called Cambridge Cognition.\n\nChildren and adolescents will be invited to participate in a number of assessments on 2 occasions, 9-12 months apart. This will include assessments of cognition, problem solving, and academic achievement. Additionally, we are interested in collecting information on children and adolescents’ quality of life and behavioural and emotional symptoms from both students and parents.\n\nThe main aims of this research project are:\n\nTo have 1300 school aged children (5-18 years old) complete the CANTAB across Victorian schools. This will form what we call a ‘normative data set’ and this will allow us to compare cognitive performance of children and adolescents.\n\nTo create a chart which maps typically developing cognition based on age and gender. This is similar to charts which map weight and height as you get older. For example, it might tell us if children have normal or expected cognitive performance in comparison to other children their age and gender.\n\nTo understand the links between cognition and children’s level of problem solving and academic achievement. We also want to know the links between cognition and children’s feelings/emotions and behaviours and children’s overall level of health and happiness.\n\nWhy am I being asked?\n\nYou and your child are being invited to participate in this project because your school has agreed to participate in this research study.\n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nThe cognitive assessments, testing of problem solving, academic achievement, quality of life and behavioural and emotional symptoms will be administered by researchers at your child’s school over 1.5 hours (2 school periods). These assessments will be done on iPads provided by the research team.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIf you and your child are interested in taking part in this research, please complete the bottom of this letter and either return it to the Emerald Secondary College front office (Att: Tanja Korsten), email to Tanja (Assistant Principal) via [email protected] OR send it directly to the research team via [email protected]\n\nIf you indicate that you and your child are interested AND you provide permission to provide your contact details to the research team, a member of the research team will be in contact with you by phone to talk to you about the project. Your contact details will remain confidential, and the research team will only use them to contact you regarding this research.\n\nWe will discuss whether the research study is suitable for you and your child and provide further information about the research study in detail for you to read through via email.\n\nFollowing this we will ask you and/or your child to formally provide consent to participate in the research study. We will also give you the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about the research.\n\nWhen consent has been provided, you and your child will be considered enrolled in The COGNITION Study and we will be in contact with your school to organise when the first assessments will occur.\n\nQuestions?\n\nPlease email us at [email protected] with any of your questions. A member of our research team will get back to you.\n\nYou can also call the study coordinator Yasemin Mehmed on (03) 9936 6475.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nProf David Coghill\n\nPrincipal Investigator, The COGNITION Study\n\nMurdoch Children’s Research Institute\n\nPlease click on the link below for a printable copy of the Permission to Contact form\n\nCognitive study Permission to Contact form\n\nPlease return this permission slip to the Emerald Secondary College front office (Att: Tanja Korsten), email to Tanja (Assistant Principal) via [email protected] OR send it directly to the research team via [email protected]"
