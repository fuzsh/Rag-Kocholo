Principal’s Welcome

It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Ringwood Secondary College website.

We are a truly dynamic, vibrant and globally engaged school located at the gateway to the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The website will provide you with a wealth of information about the College, its programs, policies, activities and opportunities to be involved as active members of our community.

Our College has a long and successful tradition of academic excellence and innovative learning practices. Our staff take great pride in providing a safe and secure learning environment, whilst at the same time providing a full range of dynamic and challenging academic and extracurricular programs.

Regular updates of this website will keep visitors, and particularly current and prospective parents, in touch with the latest news and excitement of school life at Ringwood.

Our Values

Ringwood Secondary College is an inclusive learning community that caters for the development of the whole person, allowing them to reach their full potential. Our aim is for every child to experience growth and success.

This vision is underpinned by the core values of Respect, Resilience and Achievement; these values are the cornerstone of culture at our school.

Ringwood’s core objectives are to ensure that students have all the skills, knowledge and attributes that would be expected after 13 years of schooling, so that their personal growth enables them to have the capacity to participate as responsible and productive citizens in a global community.
