        "text": "A member of Russia’s ill-fated Romanov dynasty has died a pauper in the Northern Territory.\n\nLeonid Kulikovsky — an heir to the defunct Russian crown and a great-grandson of Tsar Alexander III — suffered a heart attack while walking his dog and died under a tree in Katherine in September.\n\nBut his body lay in the morgue for two months because no one knew who he was.\n\nHis identity was only discovered after the involvement of the Russian Orthodox Church and a member of the Russian community in Darwin, Simon Andropov.\n\nMr Kulikovsky’s funeral was held yesterday. About 50 people — including NT Multicultural Affairs Minister Peter Styles and a representative from the Russian embassy — attended the Serbian Orthodox service in Darwin.\n\nAnd Mr Andropov has confirmed the Paspaley family — operator of pearling farms across northern WA — have offered to inter Mr Kulikovsky’s body in one of their family plots in Darwin.\n\n“It is a remarkable offer — and a remarkable end to a remarkable story,” Mr Andropov said.\n\nMr Kulikovsky’s grandmother was Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna — sister of Tsar Nicholas II who, along with his wife and five children, were killed in the 1918 Russian Revolution. Olga, her husband Nikolai Kulikovsky and their sons Tikhon and Guri fled to Denmark and then Canada.\n\nLeonid, Guri’s son, was born in 1943. At the age of 24, he migrated to Australia and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity.\n\nMr Kulikovsky lived at the North Bank Caravan Park in Katherine for about five years and was known as “Old Nick”.\n\n“He got on with everybody,” one local said. “He loved his dog and took great care of him. He was a great reader and had a huge number of books on Vikings.”\n\nPolice contacted his sister in Denmark, who asked he be buried in the NT.\n\nMr Kulikovsky also had links to Britain’s royal family. His great-grandmother’s brother was King George of Greece and his son Andrew is the father of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nHis great-grandmother’s sister was the wife of Edward VII, great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth."
