In April 1916, Nicholas II annulled his sister's 15-year marriage. In November that year, while serving as a nurse at Kiev, she married Colonel Nikolai Kulikovsky. When it became possible to leave Russia in 1920, Olga's mother Dagmar (Empress Marie Feodorovna) summoned her to Hvidore, where Olga for a time acted as her secretary. The couple then bought a farm which they worked to earn a living, supplemented by the sale of Olga's paintings. Olga was a focus of help for Russian emigrés, and also the target of imposters, including Anna Andersen, whom she quickly realized was not her niece. After the war they gave up the farm and took an opportunity to move to Canada, after spending time at Hampton Court with Olga's sister Xenia. - Splendid Large unsigned Portrait Photograph, (1882-1960, younger daughter of Alexander III, and her 2nd husband Colonel of Cavalry Nikolai KULIKOVSKY (1881-1958)]",
