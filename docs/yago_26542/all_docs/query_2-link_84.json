        "text": "We are looking forward to this walk. S√∏ller√∏d Naturpark always offers beautiful views.\n\nThe walk passes the beautiful thatched farm: Ryg√•rd.\n\nTo my surprise, I find that Olga, the last Grand Duchess of Russia, lived at Ryg√•rd after fleeing the Russian Revolution in 1917.\n\nThere is always a story hidden somewhere. The exciting thing is finding it üòäüòé\n\nShe moved to Ryg√•rd north of Copenhagen in 1930 with her husband and sons, after living in a small apartment in the Copenhagen.\n\nShe enjoyed the peaceful and rural surroundings of Ryg√•rd, where she could paint and tend to her garden. She also befriended the local people and helped them with various tasks. She stayed at Ryg√•rd until 1948, when she left for Canada.\n\nRyg√•rd is now part of the S√∏ller√∏d Naturpark, a protected area of natural and cultural heritage.\n\nOlga Alexandrovna was the youngest daughter of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the sister of Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia. She grew up in a tense political atmosphere, marked by several assassination attempts on her father and brother. She married Duke Peter of Oldenburg, in a loveless and unconsummated marriage. She later divorced him and married her true love, Colonel Nikolai Kulikovsky, with whom she had two sons.\n\nDuring the First World War, she served as a nurse and was awarded a medal for bravery.\n\nShe witnessed the downfall of the Romanov dynasty in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and escaped with her family to Crimea, where they lived under constant threat of execution. Her brother and his family were brutally murdered by the Bolsheviks. She managed to flee Russia with her husband and sons in 1920 and joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark.\n\nShe moved to Canada in 1948, fearing Stalin‚Äôs regime, and died there in 1960. She was the last surviving member of the Romanov family.\n\nHappy New Week to You All‚ù§Ô∏è"
