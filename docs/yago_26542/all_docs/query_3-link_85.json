Perhaps because of this she was not high ranking enough, while her sister was a political asset for the Brits.\n\nOlga's second husband Nikolai Kulikovsky was never made count.\n\nHis grandmother was Countess Natalia Gudovich, daughter of a General, Count Kirill Gudovich and Princess Varvara Galitzine...through them Nikolai Kulikovsky also descended from some other great families such as Razumovsky, Lopukhin, Naryshkin, Bariatinsky, Obolensky etc. which means he also has Rurik blood.\n\nKulikovsky family belonged to the untitled nobility originated from Moldavia and Wallachia who came to Russia as entourage of Prince Dimitri Cantemir at the beginning of the 18th century, but never actually held any title.\n\nWikipedia...\n\nHi, @Marc23!\n\nI got this from the german Wikipedia. It is claimed there, that the Emperor, Olga's brother, made Kulikovsky a count at the occasion of the marriage and that Olga lost her title as a Grand Duchess:\n\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kulikowski\n\nBut the article is a stub and obviously is your knowledge about this subject much greater, than this of the german Wikipedia - so I stand corrected. Thank you! This is a lot of information!\n\nI realize this isn't the correct place but I'm a tad lost. I'm curious why the sisters of the last Czar were treated so differently. One witha grace and favor at Hampton Court and the other an apartment in Ottawa?\n\nXenia remained in London, and had been made administrator of her brother's estate. When finances were desperate, her cousin the king granted her a home.\n\nOlga on the other hand chose to remain with their mother. Her and her husband and sons lived with Maria in Denmark until her death, Olga working as her secratary. They chose a quieter life, buy a farm, after her death. But when fear of Stalin drive them from Scandinavia, they chose to settle in Canada. They had a house in Ottawa, she moved into the apartment when her husband died and her health was failing.\n\nIt seems more a reflection of the life they chose to live. Married to a soldier, Olga was happier with a simpler commoner life. Xenia desired the life she had as a grand duchess and found a way to sustain it."
