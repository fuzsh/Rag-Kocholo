        "text": "I have always been extremely interested in the Romanovs. The Romanovs were such an interesting family in the history of Europe, dating all the way back to the early 17th century and had a profound impact. But their fate is what the most tragic thing is about them. Because of the two subsequent Russian Revolutions, the family was removed from power in February 1917 (or March 1917, as Russia did not use the Georgian calendar yet) and placed under house arrest. They were moved several times across the country. Finally, when the second revolution occurred, the October Revolution, where the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government, they were forced to Yekaterinburg, into the Ipatiev House. Nicholas the II, his wife and his five children, along with some servants were murdered by Bolshevik revolutionaries on the night of July 16-17th, 1918. This was done on the personal orders of Vladimir Lenin. For decades afterwards, rumours persisted that it was possible that members of the main ruling Romanov family survived, particularly young Anastasia, with many prominent fakes appearing over the years.\n\nThe rumours of Anastasia living though were later disproven when the bodies of the Romanovs were found in a pit outside the woods of Yekaterinburg. While a lot of focus is placed upon the main ruling Romanov family, many relatives managed to escape Russia and their various descendants are still alive today.\n\nThe head of the current house of Romanov is under dispute as different branches have different claims. One of the leading heirs of the house just passed away in 2021.\n\nHowever, today I wish to focus on one Romanov who has a connection to my beloved hometown of Toronto, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia.\n\nOlga was born on June 12, 1882 in Saint Petersburg, Russia being the youngest child of Emperor Alexander the III and the younger sister of Nicholas the II. Her mother was Empress Marie, the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark. She had a very strained relationship with her mother, remaining distant. However, her and her father were close. Her father would often take her and her siblings on hikes and hunting trips in the woods. To quote Olga’s relationship with her father:\n\n“My father was everything to me. Immersed in work as he was, he always spared that daily half-hour. … once my father showed me a very old album full of most exciting pen and ink sketches of an imaginary city called Mopsopolis, inhabited by Mopses [pug dogs]. He showed it to me in secret, and I was thrilled to have him share his own childhood secrets with me.”\n\nGrowing up, she later married Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg. It was not a marriage of love, as Peter was secretly rumoured to be gay. Olga asked several times to divorce but he said no each time. Their marriage was finally annulled by Emperor Nicholas in October 1916. She later married a cavalry officer, named Nikolai Kulikovsky. Things would change dramatically for Olga come 1917 though.\n\nWith the outset of the Russian Revolution, Olga travelled to Crimea with her husband, her mother, Marie and her sister Xenia. When they arrived there, they were placed under house arrest and she later gave birth to her first son in August 1917 at Ay-Todor, an estate located 19 KM from Yalta. This town is where the famous Yalta conference would take place 28 years later that would decide the fate of Europe and Japan after the Second World War. Her mother and sister were later snuck out of Crimea, on the HMS Marlborough, at the request of the British royal family. They had been under the watch of Russian guards, then German guards when they controlled Crimea and finally Allied ones once the war ended. The entire royal family in Crimea had been condemned to death in Yalta by the Bolsheviks, but the order was delayed on account of political tensions between the local Soviets in Yalta and at the national level.\n\nHer family was isolated from the outside world, and did not know the final fate of Nicholas the II and his family, beyond that of Nicholas himself. They knew that he had been killed, and correctly assumed that his wife and children had been killed. They did not learn the truth until they left Russia.\n\nAfter the escape of her mother and sister, Olga and her husband briefly moved to the Caucasus. They stayed there under the watch of a local Cossack named Timofei Yatchik, an imperial bodyguard. They stayed in a local village called Novominskaya and she gave birth to her second son there. They later escaped to the Danish consul in Novorossiysk. She later escaped via Turkey to Yugoslavia and finally to her ancestral homeland of Denmark, where her mother had summoned her there.\n\nHer mother, Marie died ten years after the Revolution occurred. In 1925, she met the famous Anastasia imposter, Anna Anderson, being the only true Romanov to do so in Berlin. Olga believed her to be a fake and was heartbroken when she discovered the truth about her lying.\n\nIn exile in Denmark, Olga lived on a farm in Ballerup, about 24 KM outside of Copenhagen and it became a major centre of the Russian immigrant community and the Russian monarchy movement. Her sons later served in World War II, on the side of the Danish and were briefly imprisoned. With the end of World War II, the Soviets occupied the Danish island of Bornholm, causing a problem for her. The Soviet government wrote to the Danish government trying to frame Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop for a conspiracy against the Soviet government in 1948. Joseph Stalin had a role in this personally as well, as he forged the orders to accuse Olga of being part of it.\n\nOlga, fearing for her and her family’s safety, decided to make the move across the Atlantic, to the relative safety of rural Canada.\n\nOlga and her husband later settled on a 200-acre farm they bought in Campbellville, Ontario with her husband, her sons and her grandchildren. By 1952, due to her health and her husband’s health, taking care of the farm became too much to bear. They were very old at this point, their sons had moved away and Nikolai was nearing his death. She later moved into a smaller home in Cooksville, Ontario at 2130 Camilla Road, which you can still visit today. However, it’s a private residence. She lived here with her beloved servant, but she passed away in 1954. Finally, in 1958, her husband passed away.\n\nMany people were very interested in Olga, especially foreign heads of state. She was visited many times by ambassadors and dignarties. She was visited by her extended family, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent and Louis Mountbatten in 1959. In June 1959, she met with Queen Elizabeth the II and Prince Phillip aboard the Royal Yacht, HMS. Britannia. Her home was also a magnet for Romanov imposters, which drove her family crazy.\n\nIn 1959, she became more and more infirm after the death of her husband and moved into a small apartment above 716 Gerrard Street in Toronto. During her lifetime, she had taken up a hobby of painting, which provided most of her income until she died in 1960. She was also unaware of or not told about the death of her sister, Xenia in London in April 1960. She would later herself slip into a coma on November 21, 1960 and would later die at Toronto General Hosptial at the age of 78. She only had a net worth of $350 when she died, along with only a few items such as a photo of her husband, a saucer and a Faberge Dog. Her estate was worth $200,000 which was split up among her sons.\n\nShe would later be buried in York Ceteremy next to her husband on November 30, 1960. For most of her life, she was considered the last true Grand Duchess of Russia.\n\nIt’s amazing to think, not too far from where I live in Toronto, that one of the oldest and most famous ruling dystanies in the world, came to an end. Olga, herself traumatized by her family’s murder, was never sour or sullen. To quote an article from T.V.O:\n\n“\n\nDespite the bloody murder of her family and the forced estrangement from her country, Olga never appeared dour or sullen. She joked often, and in her old age, her face was furrowed with deep wrinkles and laughter lines.\n\n“I always laugh,” she said, “for if I ever start crying I will never stop.”\n\nAfter the fall of the U.S.S.R, there could have a been very small chance that the monarchy could have returned, but it did not happen. Many people in Russia blamed the Romanovs for the rise of the communists, but they were allowed to return and become citizens again.\n\nToday, the Romanovs are reduced to a squabbling royal house with no real power or influence anywhere. It’s a damn shame Olga never got to return home or experience the return of the monarchy in Russia. Her legacy is best preserved in her paintings.\n\n“Her paintings, vivid and sensitive, are immersed in the subdued light of her beloved Russia. Besides her numerous landscapes and flower pictures that reveal her inherent love for nature, she often also dwells on scenes from simple daily life … executed with a sensitive eye for composition, expression and detail. Her work exudes peace, serenity and a spirit of love that mirror her own character, in total contrast to the suffering she experienced through most of her life”"
