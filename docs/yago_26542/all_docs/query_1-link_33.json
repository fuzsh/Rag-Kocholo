        "text": "Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna (Japanese: オルガ アレクサンドロブナ, Oruga Arekusandorobuna) of Andalor, Nero Austria, and Jefrouvania (Russian: Великая Княжна О́льга Алекса́ндровна, IPA: [vʲɪˈlʲikəjə knʲɪˈʐna]) (Velikaya Knyazhna Ol'ga Aleksandrovna); 30 April [O.S. 18 April] 1820 – 19 May 1995) was the eldest child of the 19th Tsar of the Nero Austrian Empire, Nicholas II, and of Empress Tatiana of Nero Austria and Jefrouvania. She was the Tsarina of Sous Novia through marriage to Tsar Richard Nikolaevich and become both a Widow and the Dowager Empress due to his death.\n\nShe was raised at the Leningrad Palace outside Saint Margaret. Olga`s relationship with her mother, Empress Tatiana, the daughter of Prince Michael of the United Kingdom, was strained and distant from the time she was growing until her death on the day that her youngest sibling (while she was still alive) was born. In contrast, she and her father were incredibly close, while both of them were alive and Olga was often called \"Wolf Girl\" by her father; an affectionate nickname that would later transfer to Anastasia Alexandrovna; her posthumous younger sister. She died when Maria (b. 1908) was 87, Sophie (b. 1919) was 76, Alexei (b. 1926) was 69, Nikolai (b. 1976) was 19, Dimitri (b. 1977) was 18, Igor (b. 1979) was 16 with Annika (b. 1990) being 5. In 1837, at 17, she married Emperor Richard Nikolaevich of Sous Novia, with their happy, though short-lived, marriage serving to produce many children. Included among these children are: Princess Imperial Elizabeth, Empress Louise of Corthe Star and Queen Maud of Atlantis. With the death of her husband at the age of 27 in 1849, a single month after the 29th birthday of Olga, Olga became the Dowager Empress of Sous Novia, becoming the ruler of the country. Her death at the age of 175, perpetuated a long and extremely extended period of mourning, with the eldest of her children: Elizabeth becoming the new Empress. In the late 1990s, her preserved body was dug up from it`s previous resting place at the Chapel of Princess Elizabeth (constructed in 1023) and was reburied at the \"neutral point\" upon which the Sous Novian and Nero Austrian Empires connect; upon the center of this \"neutral point\" sits the Chapel of Grace, where the Empress Dowager was reburied.\n\nAppearance and Personality[]\n\nOlga had chestnut-blonde hair, bright blue eyes, a fair skin complexion and a deceptively frail-appearing body frame; she was considered the most beautiful of Grand Duchess Anastasia Alexandrovna`s siblings and her husband even called the \"most beautiful woman that I know.\" When she was 10, she was described as rather fair, with rather quite \"gentle eyes that glimmered with hidden intelligence,\" a \"slightly retroussé nose,\" and a \"unnatural-looking symbol on her forehead, that seemed almost akin to a tattoo but was actually a beauty mark.\" Many of her complementarians wrote that \"[she] was fair and quite tall for her young age, with a rather wane smile, beautiful blue eyes, a fragile build, a somewhat short nose and simply lovely teeth.\" \"As a child she was cute and rather fragile-looking, at nineteen she was simply a pinnacle of beauty\", Elisabeth Dehn later wrote in her diary. \"The most beautiful of the Tsar and Tsarina`s children; she was simply put a treasure of Nero Austria and once married, she became the most revered Empress of Sous Novia.\"\n\nOlga was compassionate and often acted upon her desire to help others; often unintentionally endangering herself to help others, a trait that her husband was exasperated with her for. As a child, she saw a little girl crying in the road. She dismounted from her horse and approached the girl, saying, \"I`m here to help you, little girl, so please let me help you.\" Such an action caught the attention of Richard Nikolaevich who was then still a Grand Duke of Sous Novia as the eldest son of Tsar Richard Petrovich II and his wife, Tsarina Emilia Feodorovna. A generous figure, she was regarded as the highest degree \"that one can get to in order to be with the Angels or even God himself. She was a true Saint and Apostle among all of the Saints and Apostles of Nero Austrian Russian Orthodoxy.\" Her generous nature ended in her adopting several orphaned immigrant children who all married into respectful, blue-blooded families."
