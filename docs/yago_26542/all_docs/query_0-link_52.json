        "text": "Three cards written in English by Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna (1882-1960), sister of Nicholas II, to her mother – Empress Maria Feodorovna.\n\nCard No.1, in original envelope decorated with embossed and gilded name of the Grand Duchess under Imperial crown.\n\n2 3/4 x 4 1/4 in. (7 x 10,7 cm)\n\nInscription on the envelope in ink in Russian “To Her Majesty” and date in pencil.\n\n“1900 28 Nov. Darling Motherdear. I am so awfully sorry you are poorly and feel so bad. I feel much better this evening. Last night was very bad full of awful “cauchmars” (‘nightmares’, Russian word written in Latin transcription). My temperature is nearly normal. I hope you will have a better night & will be better tomorrow. Good-night Mamadear, I kiss you – from a distance. Nana is very sorry for you. Your loving Baby Olga”\n\nCard No.2, after the painting “The Horse Guards” by N.Samokish , published by Felten, St.Petersburg, text on front in Russian written in pencil below the image “Robust is the Horse Guard!”, on reverse in English (language spoken at home in the Romanov family at that time) “I am so glad I need not go, but now I feel quite well. Peter (name written in Russian – Petya) is still in bed but feels better. If you want me for tea or dinner I will of course come with great pleasure. I am awfully sorry it is so cold. I kiss you heartily my darling Mama. Your loving Olga (name in Russian)”.\n\nThe card is not dated but almost certainly is written between 1901 and 1903. Peter, who is mentioned in the letter, is Peter Alexandrovich, Prince of Oldenburg, first husband of Olga. They got married in 1901 but in 1903 she met Nicholas Kulikovsky (who later on became her second husband) and asked for divorce.\n\nGrand Duchess Olga and her husband Prince of Oldenburg (photo 1901).\n\nCard No.3, after the painting “Autumn” by Polish artist A.Kozakiewicz , written in black ink in English: “St Petersburg. 11 Dec. 1910. Good morning Mamadear, I am sorry to say that I cough & sneeze – principably – because of the cough – Nana says I must not go out. I perspire every minute so it would be too easy to catch a chill – which might turn out badly for me – so I, with great resignation must stay indoors! I was rejoicing so to Kate… I have said nothing yet to Sonya (name written in Russian) about this evening & await a word from you. A loving Kiss Mamadear. So sorry. Your loving Olga (name in Russian).”\n\nGrand Duchess Olga with her brother – czar Nicholas II, circa 1910.\n\nEmpress Maria Feodorovna and her daughter Olga, circa 1890s.\n\nEmpress Maria Feodorovna, Nicholas II, Grand Duchess Olga, circa 1896."
