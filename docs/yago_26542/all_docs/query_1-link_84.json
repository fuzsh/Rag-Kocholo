        "text": "Biography (AI generated)\n\nOlga Alexandrovna was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 3, 1882, the third daughter of Tsar Alexander III and his wife Maria Feodorovna. She was the beloved eldest sister of the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, who was executed in 1918 along with his family. Olga was the first grand duchess of the Romanov dynasty, and she was an important part of the familyâ€™s life.\n\nOlga was educated by private tutors, including the famous French educator Pierre de Coubertin. She was an excellent student and excelled in languages, literature, music, and art. As a young woman, Olga was described as a beautiful, graceful, and intelligent woman who was both modest and kind. She was also known for her compassion and generosity towards the less fortunate.\n\nIn 1901, Olga married Prince Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, a Russian naval officer. She and Peter had two children, a son, Tikhon, and a daughter, Irina. The couple had a happy marriage, and Olga was an attentive, caring mother to her children.\n\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, Olga and her family were forced to flee to the Crimea. Olga and Peter were separated for much of the war, and he was killed in 1916 when his ship was sunk by a German U-boat. Olga was devastated by his death, but she was determined to continue to serve her country. She volunteered as a nurse in military hospitals and worked in a munitions factory.\n\nIn 1918, Olga was arrested by the Bolsheviks and placed under house arrest. When the Romanovs were executed in July of that year, Olga was spared, although she was kept under close watch. She remained in captivity until 1920, when she was allowed to escape to England. Olga settled in London, where she lived for the rest of her life. She worked as a governess and later as a bookkeeper at a hospital. Olga also wrote her memoirs, which were published in 1924.\n\nOlga Alexandrovna died in her sleep in 1960, at the age of 77. She was buried at the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Mary Magdalene in London. Despite her tragic life, she was remembered for her courage and dedication to her family and her country. Olga was a symbol of hope and resilience for the Russian people, and her memory continues to live on in the hearts of many."
