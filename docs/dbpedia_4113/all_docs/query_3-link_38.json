        "text": "Susan Collins (born December 7, 1952, Caribou, Maine, U.S.) is an American politician who was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1996 and began representing Maine in that body the following year.\n\nCollins was born in Caribou, Maine, to a family involved in both the lumber industry and state politics. She was president of her high-school class, and she completed the U.S. Senate Youth Program. Collins then attended St. Lawrence University and graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. (1975) in government.\n\nCollins subsequently became a legislative assistant to U.S. Rep. William Cohen, who moved to the Senate in 1979. During that time she met Thomas A. Daffron, who was then Cohen’s chief of staff, and the couple married in 2012. Collins continued to work for Cohen—holding various administrative posts—until 1987. That year she joined the cabinet of Gov. John R. McKernan, Jr., serving as commissioner of the state’s Department of Professional and Financial Regulation until 1992. After working as a regional director (1992) in the U.S. Small Business Administration, she became deputy state treasurer of Massachusetts in 1993.\n\nCollins returned to Maine in 1994 to run for governor, losing in the general election to Angus King. Later that year she founded the Center for Family Business at Husson College, where she served as executive director. In 1996 she ran for the Senate seat held by Cohen, who was stepping down to become secretary of defense. Collins won and took office the following year.\n\nLong characterized as a centrist and moderate, Collins was attacked as a “Republican in name only” by challengers from the political right, especially because she was willing to work with Democratic members of the Senate and with Pres. Barack Obama. Breaking with the majority of her party, Collins supported marriage equality, gun control, and abortion rights. However, she joined with other Republicans by advocating for increased policing of the country’s borders and by opposing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010; PPACA)—though she later rejected most initiatives to repeal the PPACA. By the end of the 113th Congress in 2015, she had never missed a single Senate vote.\n\nCollins made headlines in 2016 when she wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post, in which she stated that she would not be voting for her party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, whom she accused of having a “complete disregard for common decency.” Trump eventually won the presidential election, and Republicans secured majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. With a Republican-controlled Congress, repeal of the PPACA seemed likely. However, Collins helped kill several repeal bills in 2017 by refusing to support the measures. That year she also helped pass a massive tax-reform bill.\n\nCollins garnered additional attention in 2018, when she expressed uncertainty over Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who some saw as a threat to Roe v. Wade and who was accused of sexual assault. Collins, a supporter of abortion rights, ultimately voted for Kavanaugh, and he was confirmed 50–48. In 2019 the U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump, who was accused of withholding aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into opening a corruption investigation into Joe Biden (Biden later became the Democratic presidential nominee). In the Senate trial early the next year, Collins voted not to charge the president, and he was acquitted in an almost party-line vote. Later in 2020 she voted against another Trump pick for the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, stating that the vote should be delayed until after the presidential election; Republicans had used that argument to block the confirmation of Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, in 2016. Barrett, however, was ultimately confirmed. These developments came as Collins faced an increasingly difficult reelection bid. Amid growing polarization within the country and Maine, her moderate approach drew criticism from both parties. However, she won another term in 2020."
