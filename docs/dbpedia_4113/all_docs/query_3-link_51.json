        "text": "Of Boston's evolving urban landscape: ​“The Town of Boston is so grown you would scarce know it for your native place, almost every spit of land is cover’d with brick buildings & the paved streets and hackney coaches make it very noisy. The old mansion house in State Street is converted into a Bank, the outside handsomely ornamented. A large and elegant State House is built near the Common, both the building and the situation are the admiration of strangers. The old Town House neatly fitted up & divided into Ships & Stores where all the variety of manufacturers from different parts of the world are exhibited to draw the attention of the young and the gay. We have a spacious Alms House built at Nor Boston which you will recollect b the name of Barton’s Point. The old Almes House Taken down and a number of handsome houses placed upon the land. The Common still remains free & we hope always will as we really begin to be crowded. The three Churches remain as they were, several new Meeting Houses one just completed at the North end on the spot where Old Dr. ?? stood.”\n\nOf her love of family: “I am the universal Grand Mama of all my young acquaintances & delight to contribute to their pleasures, convinced that the life abounds with sources of enjoyment the season for improving them is transient and should not be ungratefully neglected.”\n\nOf the Great Gale of 1804: \"​We have melancholy accounts of storms in different parts of the Continent & just now we have a tremendous one here. It commenced yesterday morning & now at 12 o’clock it seems to be abating. Steeples of churches are blown off to a considerable distance, large trees torn up by the roots of which we have a specimen in our own garden we have at least nine-inches diameter & supposed 50 feet in length lying prostrate in one fine large weeping willow not finding room enough to spread itself on the ground has fallen against the house but done no other damage than breaking a few windows...I have reached my seventieth year and do not recollect any storm equal to the present.\"\n\nOf her love of reading: “The greatest pleasure I have is in reading. Mr. C[oolidge] has a pretty library and is continually adding to it. I generally get the cutting of the new books and the first reading, have lately gone through [James] Macknight upon the Apostolical Epistles with great pleasure and satisfaction. He comes the nearest to my ideas of the character and mission of our Saviour of any one whose works I have read, deny his pac-existence, some his Divinity, & his free agency, Macknight seems to be pretty clearly to write and prove them all… I have entertained myself with the old poems of Dante, tho[ugh] partly visionary I have been pleased with them, his Inferno is full of Fable and Horror. I was most delighted with the Purgatorio some lines of which I thought very beautiful.”"
