        "text": "On November 5th, I photographed Tina and Joe’s Fall Wedding at Renault Winery in Egg Harbor City, NJ! Their classic and romantic wedding began at Chateau Renault followed by a traditional ceremony at St. James Roman Catholic Church in Ventnor City. Once these two said “I do”, we photographed the two of them all over the grounds of Renault Winery with the most perfect Fall lighting before they partied the night away in the Champagne Ballroom with the Barcelona Band. Their black tie wedding was one of my favorites of the year and I am so excited to share images from their Fall wedding at Renault Winery!\n\nTina and Joe have known each other since they were kids. Tina had a summer home in Margate growing up and knew Joe through family. Tina moved to Margate in high school and while her and Joe attended the same school, he was two years older than her and graduated a year after she moved there. Life went on and Tina went to St. Joseph’s University and he went to Rowan University. Going into her junior year of college, she transferred to Rowan and they briefly dated, but life took them separate ways – careers, moves, other relationships, etc. Two years after college, they both ended up back in Margate and single. He started working for her family’s restaurant during the summer and they flirted all summer long! She would make him a double espresso everyday before work. One night, everyone went out after work and while on the dance floor, she screamed over the music, “I have a crush on you! I like you. Why do you think I always make you espresso? Don’t you like me?” And, as they say, the rest is history!\n\nEngaged on 12/24/2020, the proposal from Tina: “The proposal started off a little rocky. To get the whole story we have to start the day before, December 23rd. I was hosting the traditional Christmas Eve Seven Fish dinner (for the first time!) for our family – a big Italian family! My parents were short workers at their restaurant on December 23rd. I asked Joe to go into work and he said no, he had other plans – he had to pick something up in Philly for his boss. Well now I’m in panic mode because I have nothing done and left Joe with a list of things to do. I called Joe while at work to ask if he followed the list. He told me he did not because he was putting up the fire place mantel. Well, Joe and I don’t really fight, we get in little everyday arguments but this night….We got into a fight! I was stressed about hosting our first Christmas Eve dinner and he’s hanging up a mantle! Fast forward to Christmas Eve, and the dinner turned out perfect. Joe ended the night by proposing to me by the fireplace (with the mantle) and the Christmas tree surrounded by our family! It was perfect. He explained that he had to pick up the ring in Philly and that he wanted the fireplace to look perfect for the proposal with the mantel on! We both laughed about the fight and I apologized for my choice of words I used the night before!” And last Summer, I captured their engagement session!\n\nTheir advice for couple’s currently planning their weddings is to do what you want and don’t second guess your decisions! Tina was most looking forward to the church doors opening and seeing Joe for the first time and Joe couldn’t wait to see Tina in her wedding dress. They both couldn’t wait to dance and party with all of their friends and family! Now married, their dreams include traveling and they’d like to continue to do renovations on their home. Shortly after, they want to start their family, Tina says Joe will be the best Dad!\n\nThank you to Tina and Joe for choosing me to photograph your stunning Fall Wedding at Renault Winery!\n\nContributing Vendors:\n\nPhotography: Susan Hennessey Photography\n\nVenue: Renault Winery\n\nChurch: St. James Roman Catholic Church, Ventnor City, NJ\n\nWedding Dress: Mari Mi Bridal – Pronovias\n\nShoes: badgley mischka\n\nVeils and Head Piece: Mari Mi Bridal\n\nRings: Pietro Jewelers\n\nBridesmaid Dresses: Bridal Garden – Amsale – Champagne\n\nMenswear: formal dimensions\n\nInvitations: Joelle’s Invitations and More\n\nHair stylist: Mane Bridal\n\nMakeup Artist: Smoke Bomb Beauty\n\nFlorist: Rain Florist\n\nCake: The Bake Works\n\nVideographer: Ethan Hoover\n\nBand: EBE Entertainment Barcelona\n\nTransportation: Shooboo\n\nPhoto Booth: Center City Photo"
