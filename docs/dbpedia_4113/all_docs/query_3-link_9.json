Since then she has established herself as one of the most prominent musical artists in Contemporary Christian music (CCM), with five additional full-length studio albums: Transform, Worship God, If I Had One Chance to Tell You Something, I Will Praise You, and Kingdom Come. Staple songs such as \"Wait for Me\", \"Reborn\", \"Song of Love\", \"Alive\", \"Shine Your Glory Down\", and \"Battle Is the Lord's\" have all been derived from these releases. She has earned nine No. 1 hits on Christian radio and has sold nearly two million albums since starting her career.[2][3]\n\nSt. James is also an accomplished author and actress.
