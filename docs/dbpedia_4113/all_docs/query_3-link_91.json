As an Amazon Associate I earn money from qualifying purchases.\n\nPublication Order of Covenant of Ascent: O'Sheerans Books\n\nPublication Order of Dark Patriots Books\n\nPublication Order of Dublin Falls' Archangel's Warriors MC Books\n\nPublication Order of Hunters Creek Archangel's Warriors MC Books\n\nPublication Order of Iron Punishers MC Books\n\nPublication Order of Pagan Souls of Cherokee MC Books\n\nPublication Order of Tenillo Guardians AIMC Books\n\nPublication Order of Tenillo, Texas Universe Books\n\nCiara St. James is a romantic suspense author from Tennessee best known for the “Dublin Falls Archangel’s Warriors MC” series of novels.\n\nShe first got interested in reading as a six year old and through the years has been a lover of the written word and a variety of genres. Still romance has always been her favorite type of fiction that she devours as if it were food.\n\nSt. James currently makes her home in Tennessee, where she lives with her two bugs that are always trying to stop her from writing. She has said that she can become antsy whenever she does not read but since she is often writing, she has to do her reading on Sundays.\n\nShe took the plunge into writing in 2019 when she quit her job as a nurse to become a full time author, which had been a lifelong dream. She is a fan of the romance genre as a whole but is most taken by the steamy romances that usually come with sassy females, alpha males, suspense and sometimes danger.\n\nSt. James was brought up in Southeastern Ohio on the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. It was a small village of no more than 4,000 people that had no more than five stop lights. The favorite pastime for almost everyone in the village was to sit by the porch counting cars.\n\nAs such, books were her only escape and she spent hours reading. As a seventeen year old, she met the next door neighbor’s son who was just leaving to go join the navy. It was such an enthralling encounter, it completely changed her life.\n\nIt took quite a while for Ciara St. James to adapt to life in the big city. Going from living in a small village of no more than 4,000 to millions in San Diego was not a walk in the park. She often felt overwhelmed and had it not been for her husband’s support she would not have made it.\n\nCiara St James loves to call herself a sassy Libra that is addicted to books, which started when she was still very young as it was sometimes the only escape she had. As she grew up, her reading habits only grew more obsessive and she no longer just wanted to read but also write.\n\nHer mind kept saying that she needed to write a romance novel, even though she pushed the thought away for years. She always thought she had no time given that she was raising two kids and was working as a healthcare nurse and manager.\n\nSome days she could not even get enough sleep, even with her husband helping and working with her. In 2019, her husband told her to go for it and she jumped in legs first learning how to become an indie author. She now has crazy, long and sometimes frustrating days but would never give it up for anything in the world.\n\nShe now spends much of her days researching, writing, and reading the books of her favorite authors. She usually reads every day and loves hot romances spiced with danger and hot sex, which is what she also writes about in her works.\n\n“Terror’s Temptress” by Ciara St James is a compelling story filled with action, drama, danger and great characters. The lead in the novel is the Dublin Falls Archangels Warriors Motorcycle Club President Declan Moran otherwise nicknamed Terror.\n\nUnlike other clubs, they run a legitimate business and have never been involved in the seedier criminal elements other clubs usually do. President Bull is the leader of another branch of the club, who receives a letter claling him for a meeting with Terror.\n\nWhat Terror does not know is that Harley his daughter had been responsible for the meeting. She is a tough woman who had been raised in the MC way and can usually hold her own in many tough and dangerous situations. While she can hold her own, Terror knows how dangerous such meetings can be.\n\nHe acknowledges that the only way to be safe and be a force to be reckoned with is for Harley to be right by his side.\n\nCiara St. James’s novel “Savages’s Princess” is the story of Savage who is the Dublin Fall’s Archangel Warrior’s vice president. He happens to be a former Navy Seal and there is no one more loyal to the club. He is determined to defend and protect the club and his family the same way he protected his country when he was in the Army.\n\nWhen he meets a waitress in the bar named Janessa, he discovers that he is more interested in a full life rather than just living in the moment. The president has his Temptress and he thinks she can have such a life with Janessa. But what he does not know is that Janssa has a dark past that she has been hiding from.\n\nShe has been working as a waitress for the Archangel Warriors’ bar, even as she studies to become a nursing student. She is a reserved and quiet girl who is afraid of her past. When her stalker finds her, Savage and his brothers are determined to do everything to protect and save her.\n\nShe is finding it hard to accept the attention and protection of Savage, as she knows it would be impossible to stay away from him if she does.\n\n“Steel & Hammer’s Hellcat” by Ciara St. James is the story of two men that have been best friends right from their childhood.\n\nHammer and Steel have grown up together, joined the MC club together and have shared women over the years. They always knew that they should have one woman to share forever. Still, they will all have to find the woman first.\n\nThey had the perfect opportunity when Regan came to the compound to deal with a man that had beaten up Trish, her roommate. Evan used to hang around the Archangel’s Warriors and he happened to be at the party when Trish and Regan arrived.\n\nRegan always stands up for herself and intends to do the same for her roommate. She is a loyal, independent and strong woman that wouldn’t let anyone hurt anyone she loves. The nurse practitioner works in the psych unit and often consults on patients who come into the ER.\n\nWhen Hammer and Steel see her in action they know she is just the woman for them. But they will have to convince her of their way of thinking.\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » Ciara St. James\n\n8 Responses to “Ciara St. James”"
