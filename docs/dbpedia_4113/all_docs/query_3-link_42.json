        "text": "For almost 25 years, Susan Richbourg Parker has enlightened St. Augustine Record readers about people, events and places that have shaped St. Johns County’s centuries of history.\n\nHer Sunday column, “The Oldest City,” is a fitting commentary for Parker, who describes herself as growing up in St. Augustine “surrounded by vestiges of centuries of history.”\n\nParker, who holds a doctorate in history from the University of Florida, is a self-employed research, writer and editor of historic projects.\n\nThe column started in 1996, Parker said in a recent interview as one of The St. Augustine Record’s 2019 10 Who Make a Difference in St. Johns County.\n\n“I was working for the Preservation Board here and (Editor) Jim Sutton came to see me and said The Record was interested in putting a rail (on the left-hand column) the front page. He wanted me to give reporters information about St. Augustine history, not something you would typically find in history books. As we talked, I told him it was much easier for me to write it than to give it to someone else. He wanted 200 words at the start. When they moved it inside, it now averages 600-700 words.”\n\nShe continues to write the column because people show an interest in it. A few years ago, she met a woman at a party.\n\n“She had lived here three years, and the columns made her feel like she had lived here longer. … She knew the (back) stories about St. Augustine,” Parker said.\n\nAmong her regular readers is longtime friend and colleague, Kathleen Deagan, an internationally recognized archaeologist who has been digging up St. Augustine’s past since the 1970s.\n\nThe columns, Deagan said, are “remarkable in the way she connects current events to the comparable events in the past. And it reaches so many people (me included) who wouldn’t ordinarily have access to the documentary information that Susan shares. It really heightens everyone’s awareness of and pride in our town.”\n\nAnother major contribution, Deagan said, was Parker’s nine years as executive director of the St. Augustine Historical Society. She said Parker increased its visibility, raised the standards for El Escibano, the Society’s annual history journal, and secured grants to improve the Society’s physical plant and its research library.\n\nSeveral objectives and motivating influences drive Parker.\n\nFirst, curiosity.\n\n“If you are not curious, you don’t pay a lot of attention to anything going on in life,” she said.\n\nThen, the past.\n\n“History is all around us,” she said.\n\nAnd while every place has history, St. Augustine lives it daily.\n\n“It is the economic engine for the community,” she said. “People come here for the history. It employs many people. It pays the bills.”\n\nA knack for ‘historical connections’\n\nParker originally wanted to pursue a career overseas but that did not happen. She joined the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board in 1987 as a volunteer researcher under Dr. Amy Bushnell, then research historian. Bushnell is adjunct Associate Professor, Department of History at Brown University and Researcher in Residence, The John Carter Brown Library.\n\nBushnell spoke to a woman’s group in the living history museum, San Agustin Antiguo.\n\n“I invited the women to help in the research library,” she said. “Susan Parker introduced herself to me as a former Spanish teacher who did title searches for her husband, a real estate lawyer. I told her that she would be a real asset to the Library, and that I only wished it were possible to pay her.”\n\nParker volunteered, and later the preservation board received an Institute of Museum Services grant to catalog the research library according to the Library of Congress system.\n\n“Susan went on the payroll,” Bushnell said.\n\nParker said Bushnell was her first mentor. She suggested that Parker pursue a doctorate.\n\nBushnell said, “She had already shown that she was good at research; it now became evident that she also had an aptitude for historical connections.”\n\nIn addition to Bushnell’s mentoring, Parker credits Deagan’s influence.\n\n“It was not a mentee-mentor relationship,” she said. “I admire the way Kathy does her research and presents it. I know I can rely on her research.”\n\nWhen Parker was at the preservation board as its historian, the late Luis Arana, longtime historian of the Castillo de San Marcos, was a strong resource for his knowledge of the military history and the social history of soldiers living in the city, and of the inner workings of government agencies.\n\nThe late Michael Gannon, historian and author, guided Parker’s dissertation and provided encouragement and expertise on St. Augustine and Florida’s early Spanish history and the Florida missions period over Parker’s career.\n\nA reach beyond the city\n\nJames Cusick Jr., curator of the P.K. Yonge Library of Florida History, said Parker’s presence reaches beyond St. Augustine.\n\nShe designed and implemented the teacher workshops that the Florida Humanities Council held each summer in St. Augustine from 2004 to 2014.\n\n“Teachers took back to their classrooms Susan's talks on how St. Augustine came to be founded, the importance of the sea to life in town, and an understanding of daily life in colonial times,” he said.\n\nShe was also a principal scholar on the PBS program “The Secrets of Spanish Florida,” helping people understand the history of colonial women and families through records such as church documents, court cases and wills, Cusick said.\n\nParker is invited to present papers at national and international conferences, is a featured source in newspapers, on radio and television.\n\nIn January, she will speak on early women property owners to the American Historical Association’s international conference in New York City.\n\nShe was interviewed extensively regionally and nationally on St. Augustine’s history during the city’s 450th anniversary celebration in 2015.\n\nAmong those interviews was an hour-long talk show on the Sirius XM Trucking Channel program about St. Augustine and the Old Spanish Trail that went from here to California.\n\nParker’s recent major project was editor of the St. Augustine Historical Society’s second history book, “The Oldest City”. The book is a collection of chapters about the city’s history written by several authors, including Parker. The first book was published in 1983.\n\n“We know so much more about the city’s history now than we did 30 years ago,” she said.\n\nThe book includes the impact of Native Americans and the city’s modern civil rights struggles.\n\nWith a Parker’s commitment to history, it’s obvious that her legacy is rooted in St. Augustine’s past. But, there’s a twist.\n\n“People get down and depressed about what’s happening today,” she said. “I want them to see the big picture, that in St. Augustine’s long history there were also times when people were down and depressed, but the city’s still here.\n\n“I want to put faces on the ordinary people who lived here, whose names are written in the parish records.”\n\nParker, as her biographical information attests, makes it her business to be part of the community at large.\n\nHere’s her advice from experience:\n\n“Be willing to go through some of the tedium to make the organization (or activity) work. It sounds boring, but somebody has to do it. Nobody wants to do the tedium. They want to do only the high-profile things.”\n\nParker has writing projects under way but isn’t sharing them.\n\nAs her mentor Gannon often said, “I don’t talk about them (in process) or I’ll never get them done.”\n\nHow long have you been in our community? Almost all my life.\n\nFamily:\n\nChildren, Christopher Parker, Chapel Hill; Amanda Parker Struckhoff, New Orleans; Robert Parker, St. Augustine; and four granddaughters. Both her parents moved to St. Augustine as toddlers, so they grew up in St. Augustine. Her brother is deceased.\n\nOccupation:\n\nCurrently an independent consultant for historical projects, exhibits, media productions and preservation projects.\n\nExecutive director of St. Augustine Historical Society 2007-2016; Region Preservation consultant for State Historic Preservation Office, 2002-2007; Historian for State Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board, 1987-1997.
