        "text": "When one thinks of Hammer film’s I suppose like many you automatically think of the likes of Dracula, Frankenstein and other creatures of the night such as Vampires. It is surprising that Hammer never did more films that had werewolves as their focus. The Curse of the Werewolf being the studios only foray into the lupine department. Released in 1961 the movie in my opinion was and still is excellent, it was the first major starring role for Oliver Reed who played the werewolf. For a movie released in the very early sixties it was violent, brutal and blood spattered.\n\nAlthough the censors did call for cuts before allowing it loose in cinemas in the UK. The film was directed by Terence Fisher and starred Clifford Evans and Yvonne Romain. The screenplay was by John Elder who based it upon the novel The Werewolf of Paris by Guy Endore. The stunning cinematography was the work of Arthur Grant, with the movie containing a complex soundtrack by composer Benjamin Frankel. I say complex because it was rare in film music at that time to utilise the twelve-tone serialism approach. But it was an approach that worked wonderfully within the movie, complimenting and supporting the action, the score also boasts a particularly haunting pastoral theme which is heard at various points throughout the story. The movie was also the first werewolf film to be filmed in colour, and I think that was probably the attraction of the film, before werewolf movies had been in black and white, but the movie being in colour added even more realism to the story that was unfolding up on the screen. The producer Anthony Hinds decided to move the location of where the story was set to Spain, which worked so well.\n\nSet in the 18th-century the film opens with the focus on a beggar who has been imprisoned by a cruel Marqués after making inappropriate remarks at the nobleman’s wedding feast. The beggar is thrown into the deepest dungeons and then forgotten is forgotten, but miraculously survives for another fifteen years his only contact with outside life being the jailer who attends to him and his stunningly beautiful daughter. The now old and even more bitter Marques, harasses the young girl while she is cleaning his room, but she rebuffs his advances and the Marques who is outraged throw her into the dungeons too.\n\nThe beggar who has been driven insane by his many years of incarceration rapes the girl, but then dies. The girl is soon released and is sent to the Marques where again he attempts to have his wicked way with her. This time however the girl fights back and kills the nobleman then runs away. She is found by a kind and gentle man Don Alfredo Corledo (Clifford Evans) who takes her in giving her food and shelter the man’s housekeeper Teresa nurses the girl back to health and it is discovered she is pregnant. She gives birth to a baby boy on Christmas day but then sadly dies, the housekeeper is very superstitious and considers that a baby born on Christmas day is a bad omen.\n\nThe man and the housekeeper raise the boy and name him Leon, but things begin to become sinister and chilling when the boy starts to behave oddly. On a hunting trip Leon gets his first taste of blood, but represses his urges to kill, helped by his carers. However, several goats are found dead and initially the herder’s dog is blamed. Leon grows into adulthood and moves away from his home to work in a vineyard which is owned by Don Fernando, who puts Leon to work in the wine cellar with Jose whom Leon soon becomes good friends with.\n\nThirteen years later, the adult Leon (Oliver Reed) leaves home to seek work at the Gomez vineyard. The vintner, Don Fernando, sets Leon to work in the wine cellar with Jose Amadeo, who becomes Leon’s friend. Leon falls in love with Fernando’s daughter, Cristina, and becomes despondent at the seeming impossibility of marrying her. He allows Jose to take him to a nearby brothel, where he transforms and kills Vera, one of the girls. He also kills Jose, before returning to Alfredo’s house. Too late, he learns that Cristina’s loving presence prevents his transformation; he is about to run away with her when he is arrested and jailed on suspicion of murder.\n\nHe begs to be executed before he changes again, but the mayor does not believe him. His wolf nature rising to the surface, he breaks out of his cell, killing an old soak and the gaoler. Shocked and disgusted by his appearance, the local people summon his adoptive father, who has obtained a silver bullet made from a crucifix blessed by an archbishop. Though torn with grief, Alfredo shoots Leon dead, and tearfully covers his body with a cloak.\n\nTerence Fisher.\n\nDirector Terence Fisher had worked on a handful of movies for Hammer previously before stepping into the world of the Gothic horror, five years before The Curse of Frankenstein he had directed The Last Page and in the ensuing half a decade the filmmaker was involved with several productions, Stolen Face, Blood Orange, The Four-Sided Triangle, Mantrap, and Mask of Dust to highlight just a few. After the success of both The Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula Fisher was to become a much-applauded horror director and Hammer studios returned to the filmmaker many times to make sequels of their first forays into gothic horror territory.\n\nFisher however never restricted himself to directing movies that focused upon these two iconic figures in horror history, for example he turned to the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1958 when he directed The Hound of the Baskervilles, and in the same year was responsible for the less successful feature film The Man Who Could Cheat Death.\n\nAs the decade of the 1950,s drew to a close, Fisher triumphed again in 1959 when he was the director on The Stranglers of Bombay and The Two Faces of Dr Jekyll, it was also in this year that the director brought to the screen an exciting and dramatic full colour version of The Mummy, a year later the filmmaker was responsible for introducing actor Oliver Reed to cinema audiences in the now classic horror movie The Curse of the Werewolf. The 1960,s became a busy time for the director as he worked on a number of projects which were varied and above all entertaining. The Devil Rides Out, The Phantom of the Opera, and a few movies in the Hammer Dracula and Frankenstein cycle. The decade of the 1960,s came to an end with Fisher taking up his familiar position behind the camera on Frankenstein Must be Destroyed (1969).\n\nIt was at this time that Fisher was to be involved in two accidents which kept him away from filmmaking for around three to four years, however when he was fully recovered, he soon returned to making movies and in 1973 was responsible for Hammer’s Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell.\n\nTerence Fisher went to sea as a young man, his mother thought that after the death of his father in 1908 this career would be the making of him and stand him in good stead for what life might throw at him. However, Fisher never stayed at sea and after a period of some eight years he decided to return to dry land. He began to work in the textile or clothing industry and became an assistant display manager at Peter Jones. Whilst pursuing this career Fisher began thinking about going into the film industry, at first, he could not decide in what area of filmmaking he wanted to work in, but eventually became a film editor working his way up the ladder at Shepherds Bush film studios from a clapper board operative ending up in the editing room where he began to work on the films of Will Hay. Fisher then changed studios and went to the Teddington Studios which were run by Warner Brothers.\n\nIn 1947 Fisher was invited to take up a position at the Highbury studios by the rank organisation who were offering an apprenticeship of sorts for aspiring young filmmakers. Fisher made a handful of shorts whilst there and was picked out by Sidney Box, who gave him a chance to try his hand at directing a full-length feature. The rest as they say is history. Born in Maida vale, London on February 23rd, 1904, Terence Fisher passed away on June 18th 1980, I know that we will never see his like again in British cinema.\n\nBenjamin Frankel.\n\nBenjamin Frankel was born in London in 1906, he had originally served as an apprentice to a watchmaker, he became a proficient pianist and played violin, he began to study music composition at the Guildhall School of Music in London in 1923. His career in music began as a jazz violinist, mainly in night clubs and he also performed with bands aboard ships. He worked as a musical director in London’s West End which included working on productions and shows by Cochrane and Noel Coward. In 1949 Frankel scored the thriller Night and The City, but his music was removed from the film outside of England because of contractual disputes with the movie was re-scored by Franz Waxman.\n\nIt was not until 2003 that Frankel’s music for the movie was heard outside of the U.K. It is thought that if his music had remained intact on the American print of the movie it would have been the breakthrough that the composer so richly deserved. One of his best loved pieces of music was an enchanting number which is essentially light music but was featured in the movie So Long at the Fair (1950) which starred a fresh-faced Jean Simmons and a handsome young actor named Dirk Bogarde. When the film was first released it was this piece that attracted most people and because of its popularity was recorded by Charles Williams and his orchestra, and more recently has appeared on a recording from the Marco Polo stable. The composer also wrote a similar haunting piece for A Kid for Two Farthings which was an enchanting British movie from 1955, starring Diana Dors and David Kosoff, again Frankel’s music was recorded by another orchestra, and it is composer/conductor George Melachrinois that many think wrote the music.\n\nFrankel worked on a few Ealing comedies one of the most prominent being The Man in the White Suit (1951) for example. But it is probably the composers more robust and complex writing for cinema that he is best remembered for, Battle of the Bulge and Night of the Iguana coming to mind. Both examples contained striking and vibrant scores.\n\nFrankel seemed to be more at home or at least more comfortable when writing complex and even more extreme sounding music for film, but even within the extreme music for The Curse of the Werewolf, the composer does at one point return to a more simple, melodic style in a delightful pastoral piece which itself in many ways echoes the composers work on So Long at the Fair, and A Kid for Two Farthings. As well as his music for film the composer has written extensively for the concert hall and based many of his compositions of serious music on a personal version of the twelve-tone serial technique, which he also employed within many of his scores for cinema to great effect. Often stretching the tonality of his music to the limit, with effective and resounding results, fashioning a wonderfully innovative sound.\n\nHe died on February 12th, 1973, in London. The complete original score for the Hammer movie The Curse of the Werewolf has never been released, but a suite of music from the film was included on the Silva Screen compilation entitled Horror, and then later Carl Davies conducted a re-recording of the score for Naxos records. Which included other film music by Frankel.\n\nWhen I Heard the sad news that Michael Jones had passed away, I was devastated, it was like losing a family member. Michael was a pioneer in soundtracks he was responsible for introducing many fans to the delights of Italian film music. It was mainly the music of the spaghetti westerns that he is credited for bringing into the UK. He started out at Soundtrack which was situated in the foyer of the famous Arts Theatre club in Gt Newport Street in London’s west end, deep in the heart of theatre land. The place was an Aladdin’s cave for collectors on my first trip I must admit to being a little dizzy, as a 15-year-old that knew very little about Italian scores and composers and to see this marvellous stock of all kinds of soundtracks was a bit breathtaking. However, thanks to Michael my ill-informed brain soon became full of facts and names. He was a wealth of knowledge and not just about Italian soundtracks but about everything from Max Steiner to Jerry Goldsmith and more. He always had time to talk and would always say “You must have this, or if you like that you will love this”.\n\nAnd he was always right. At one time he even put me in touch with Epic records about a single that no one could get, it was Italian pop music and at the time in the British clubs it was big, Adriano Celentano – Prisencolinensinainciusol, Michael could not see the attraction, and said here’s the phone number call them. I did and got hold of around fifty copies, which I sold.\n\nMichael would produce a catalogue with so many titles all of which he had in stock. The catalogue was fifteen pence, and I think the highest priced LP was £3.50. and 15p postage. He operated an efficient Mail order service, which too was something new for Britain, and you could guarantee your selected title would be with you in either one or two days. He was the 1970s equivalent of Amazon Prime.\n\nAfter a few visits I got to know Mike quite well even going to lunch with him. I remember one time he asked for a glass of water which the waitress brought to him but charged him fifty pence which he could not believe. I think he was still talking about that two years later. When I first met him, he was twenty-one, but had the knowledge and business mind of someone much older.\n\nI think I spent all my wages at Soundtrack which considering I got less than ten pounds a week wasn’t bad as I got maybe two or three Lps a week. I remember Mike meeting his future wife Carol they met at the G.P.O. (now British telecom) where they both worked.\n\nMike moved from Soundtrack to 58 Dean Street under the name of Soundtracks Unlimited, another iconic soundtrack shop with Derek Breager. Mike was there behind the counter and in front of it talking to people, playing them records and making sure that the stock was outstanding. His enthusiasm never depleted in fact I think it grew. It was at Dean Street that he started to venture into releasing soundtracks on LP one that stands out is Taras Bulba by Franz Waxman. The LP came in a white cover with a stick on illustration of the poster.\n\nIt was also at Dean Street that the Japanese Import first became available, collectors loved these imports because the artwork was so eye catching, he would take the first Japanese imports to the Japanese Steak house in Wardour Street to have the credits and track titles translated.\n\nThese would have been Sabata, The Seven Samurai, Catlow, Get Carter, and the double LP The Best of the Bloody Westerns, which were on Toho or King records. In later years scores such as Orca Killer Whale and Around the World with the lovers of Peynet were released.\n\nHe also introduced many to the single 45rpm record with picture covers, Companeros, The Hunting Party, Four Fly’s of Grey Velvet, Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion, Queimada, The Nicest Wife, they were all there. He told me about so many composers and was I think like a mentor he taught me so much, and not just me everyone that met Mike came away richer in knowledge, and he even inspired people to go on and do what he was doing, Lionel Woodman for example.\n\nAfter Dean Street he went to Thats Entertainment for a short time then from there he headed south across the Thames to Brockley and Soundtrack and General was born with the help of Jeff Proctor who was a big Morricone fan. The shop was in Kilgour Road.\n\nMike also would promote others as in the book Opera of Violence by Laurence Staig and Tony Williams who called him (Michael I Have Run out of 2ps Jones) And other record dealers as in the likes of Bongiovanni in Bologna Italy and Consorti in Rome, where I started to import from to sell to department stores in Brighton my hometown. He was someone who was instantly likeable he went on to become a successful record producer releasing compilations of tv themes such as the A Team and Hill Street Blues on the Indiana label.\n\nI met Mike a couple of times at his home in London and spoke on the phone about things he was doing. At one time he was even putting together his own music tracks using samples. (and they were good). Soundtrack shops changed a lot and became fewer and fewer and finally the Internet took over. It’s a very different world now but if it had not been for Michael the soundtrack specialist would probably look very different or maybe not existed at all.\n\nHe was a pioneer, a friend, a mentor, and a man that was passionate about everything he did. Rest in peace Michael take time now to sit back and listen to all that music you introduced to us. For that and more I thank you with all my heart. You shaped my life and sent me on a wonderful musical journey as well as influencing my music tastes you also directed me towards the Italian films, because I had heard the music I wanted to see the movies they were from. so much. If it was not for Michael, I would never have met the likes of Lionel Woodman, Jeff Proctor and Laurence Staig. Or met James Fitzpatrick, Derek Breager, George Ginn, David Stoner, Luc Van de Ven, Geoff at Backtrack and so many others. Then there were the composers such as Alessandro Alessandroni, Franco Micalizzi, Stelvio Cipriani, Nico Fidenco, Carlo Rustichelli, Nora Orlandi, Gianni Ferrio, De Angelis, Franco De Gemini, Francesco De Masi, and so many others, because Mike acquainted me with their music, and I wanted to find out more, I ended up interviewing them. Mr. Jones you will be missed so much, but never forgotten.\n\nLet’s leave the last words to Micheal.\n\nThis was an interview he did a few years ago.\n\n“I started a soundtrack shop in 1970, specialising in film soundtracks and shows initially. This was Soundtrack at The Arts and Theatre club. It was not long – six months or so – before I was swayed by customer requests and became a specialist within a specialised area and concentrated on importing Ennio Morricone records and Italian soundtrack LPs by other composers. It was Laurence Staig mostly, because he nagged me about which records he wanted. He showed me the RCA catalogue, so I began importing Morricone albums first, then Italian westerns by other composers, and then eventually all the other Italian thrillers and suchlike. It was what the customers were asking for.\n\nI suppose I was a pioneer in those days, introducing Italian film music to soundtrack collectors. But it was not just in England. What we started in London spread to other parts of Europe and the world. I had customers everywhere. When the first shop opened, I was lucky enough to have a free reign and have the market pretty much to myself for a few years. Funnily enough, several of my biggest customers were guys who eventually started soundtrack businesses of their own, such as Lionel Woodman (Soundtrack deletions and later Hillside CD Productions) and Derek at 58 Dean Street and Johnny Yap (That’s Entertainment) and a few others.\n\nThe original United Artists soundtrack album for The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was available everywhere and once I decided to go into importing Morricone, Queimada was one of the first soundtracks to arrive, and then The Five Man Army.\n\nMy shop changed premises a few times. I was Soundtracks Unlimited in Dean Street, and eventually finished up as Soundtrack and General in Brockley, South London. I did a one-sheet soundtrack newsletter for many years on coloured paper which went out to all my customers, detailing new releases.\n\nWe built up a substantial mail-order business as well as customers visiting the shop. My wife remembers all the names of my customers from back then because she was the one who religiously wrote out by hand all the names and addresses on the envelopes every few weeks. By 1975 I think I was selling about 150 different Morricone albums”…"
