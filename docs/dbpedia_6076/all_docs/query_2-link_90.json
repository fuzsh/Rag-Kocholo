        "text": "I can't say that I \"hate\" opera, because I have many operas in my CD\n\ncollection, and some of them are among my all-time favorites. But most of\n\nthem are not from the opera-house \"standard repertoire.\" I have operas by\n\nHaydn, Janacek, Thomson, Adams, Nielsen, Sallinen, Tubin, etc. I have\n\nsome of Mozart's operas and will probably get most of them eventually.\n\nAnd I have two and a half Ring cycles. (If you've been reading some of\n\nthe other current threads in this group, you can probably guess where the\n\nhalf-cycle comes from.)\n\nBut I don't have *any* of the standard Italian repertoire, except for some\n\nvideos taped from PBS broadcasts. For some reason, those operas simply\n\nhaven't \"grabbed\" me. Perhaps it's the 19th-century Italian romantic\n\nstyle. I'm not a big fan of the romantic style in itself, and most of\n\nthe Romantic-period composers that I like either have some distinctive\n\n\"flavor\" (e.g. the Russians) or else are crossing over into the \"modern\"\n\nperiod (e.g. Mahler).\n\nMaybe I could put it this way: I like classical-period music (Mozart,\n\nHaydn, Beethoven) because of the \"cleanness\" of style, rhythmic vigor,\n\nstructure, etc. I like 20th-century music because of the incredible\n\nvariety of styles and interesting sonorities. I can enjoy many operas\n\nfrom those periods just as pure music, without burying my nose in a\n\nlibretto or watching a video to follow the action.\n\nBut the standard Italian opera repertoire doesn't seem (to me) very\n\n\"interesting\" from the harmonic or structural point of view. The\n\nfundamental characteristic seems to me to be the emotional content, and\n\nits expression in vocal display. To get into the emotions, I have to\n\n*watch* what's happening; and I'm not strongly into vocal display in\n\nitself.\n\n--\n\nJon Bell <jtb...@presby.edu>\n\n(the following input comes from an opera neophyte)\n\nIt has taken we quite a while to appreciate opera (yet I used to like\n\npunk rock, go figure). I still can't help but feeling that I missing\n\na lot because I seldom see an actual opera performance and my exposure\n\nis limited to the snippets that I hear on the radio or the few cd's to\n\nwhich I have access. I generally have no idea what it is that they\n\nare saying (even when the opera is in English!) and rarely have no\n\nidea what is actually happening in the opera. But some of these\n\npeople have some of the most amazing voices, many of which could never\n\nbe described with words. It took me a while to figure this out\n\nbecause I used to change the station whenever an opera came on.\n\nI consider myself a serious music lover (a few words that do leave\n\nmuch to the imagination) in that I like almost all styles of music\n\n(country and western are not music! :>).\n\n==================================================\n\nhttp://snake.srv.net/~got/adam.html - my homepage\n\n==================================================\n\nIt has come to my attention that a certain fool is\n\nnow forging messages suposedly from myself.\n\n==================================================\n\nOn Tue, 5 May 1998 02:45:08 -0400, babsd...@webtv.net (robert\n\nseigler) wrote:\n\n>some years ago, this question was asked on the opera quiz, and it\n\n>continues to bother me. on the 'detested composer' thread, for example,\n\n>several people dismissed as intolerable the true giants of the operatic\n\n>literature. why?\n\n>\n\n>whoever mentioned rossini must have forgot his wonderful overtures, and\n\n>i'm sure verdi's requiem is enjoyed by those who can't abide rigoletto.\n\n>so it's not their music that's hated, but the whole concept of opera.\n\n>why?\n\n>\n\n>as an opera lover, i'm stumped. what do you opera haters have to say?\n\n>\n\n>bob seigler\n\nI know some very serious and talented musicians who love opera.\n\nI myself, however, am in the camp of which you speak: I don't much\n\ncare for opera. This even extends to Mozart. I have over 2000\n\nclassical CDs, but the only operas I have are:\n\nMozart: Cosi & Zauberfloete\n\nGershwin: Porgy & Bess\n\nMartinu: Julietta & The Greek Passion and a couple\n\nof short operas\n\nA guy I knew once described all vocal classical music as\n\neither moaning (Renaissance) or shreiking (opera).\n\nIt's not only opera: it's vocal Classical and Romantic classical\n\nmusic in general that I don't care for. I don't object to vocal\n\nmusic in Josquin or Bach, or, off the other end, in Ives. I do\n\nhowever really wish Bach had written 200-odd concerti and\n\nsuites instead of 200-odd cantatas. I find Ives' vocal music\n\nto be downright wonderful stuff, though I'm not fond of\n\nSchoenberg's vocal music. Come to think of it, Ives' vocal\n\nmusic by itself constitutes more than half the classical vocal\n\nmusic after Bach that I can really get into. One characteristic\n\nthese share is that they treat the voices as instruments rather\n\nthan as peacocks (ISTM). However, Mozart does that too,\n\nbut I rarely listen to his operas.\n\nA couple of objections I often proffer are that the sopranos\n\nhurt my ears and the tenors usually offend my sensibilities.\n\nNobody sane writes continuously for instruments at the shrill\n\nupper extreme of their ranges: why is that considered so\n\nwonderful in sopranos? It turns music into an unpleasant\n\nathletic exhibit for me. Re tenors, I must have a personal\n\npsychosis. Surely they can't mostly be the flaming and\n\nidiotic egomaniacs that their execution suggests to me.\n\nOn the other hand, I very much enjoy the vocals in popular\n\nmusic. Most jazz and pop singers don't shreik at the top of\n\ntheir ranges, or at least not the ones I listen to. They also\n\nseem to me much more at one with their music, as opposed\n\nto their execution, than most classical singers. I've never\n\nheard a classical singer who can do to me what Gladys\n\nKnight or Janis Joplin does to me.\n\nIt's just a question of taste I guess. Someone else in this\n\nthread mentioned his/her dislike of Romantic music in general.\n\nI'm in sympathy with that myself. About the only composer\n\nbetween the Classical and Early Modern periods that I\n\nunreservedly enjoy is Brahms. Even Beethoven is sometimes\n\ntoo full of himself for me to be able to ignore, though certainly\n\nI love most of his music and don't deny his greatness. From\n\npostings in this newsgroup, I gather it's a common dichotomy\n\nfor people to either prefer or disfavor Romantic music. I'm in\n\nthe disfavor camp myself. Music for me went to sleep, for the\n\nmost part, after Haydn, and re-awakened with Schoenberg\n\nand Ives.\n\n--\n\nPlease remove the two capital X's from my e-mail address before replying via e-mail.\n\n(They are an attempt to thwart unsolicited commercial mail.)\n\n> as an opera lover, i'm stumped. what do you opera haters have to say?\n\n>\n\n> bob seigler\n\nI can agree with many of the opinions expressed in this thread. I don't\n\nhate opera per se, and have many in my collection. However, it seems to\n\nme that:\n\n1) The standard repertoire as, eg, broadcast by the Met, or on the radio,\n\nis extremely narrow.\n\nIn fact, I wouldn't call the Met an opera house at all; it is an economic\n\ninstitution. Any provincial opera house in Germany has a far greater\n\nrepertoire. The Met is strictly Italian with a dose of Wagner. Their idea\n\nof being adventurous is to stage Khovanshchina.\n\nAccording to several sources only 10 percent of all operas ever written\n\nhave been performed. Some unknown operas have been mentioned in this\n\nthread. There are dozens of wonderful ones. Martinu, who I think a\n\ncouple people mentioned,\n\nwrote about a dozen operas, if I remember. There is the extraordinary\n\nOresteia of Tanyeev; Blood Wedding of Szokolay; Absalom and Eteri, a beautiful\n\nopera of Paliashvili, is Georgia's national opera; never staged here. There\n\nare even unknown Tchiakovsky operas--the Oprichnik is terrific.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov wrote 15 operas, at least five of which deserve to be in\n\nthe standard repetoire.\n\nNielsen, even Prokofiev's Fiery Angel rarely gets a hearing here. One can\n\ngo on and on.\n\n2) The singing isn't the problem. Many people who like choral music don't\n\nlike opera. It seems to me that too much opera music is in the service of\n\nthe singer, rather than vice versa. Listening to a coloratura perform\n\nvocal acrobatics gets as quickly tiring as listening to the Liszt\n\ntranscendental etudes. A little goes a long way.\n\n3) Opera fans don't help by promoting the cult of the singer over the\n\nmusic. This far exceeds the adoration of even the most famous pianists. I\n\nknow one guy who won't even speak to me because I don't like Wagner.\n\n4) As several people have mentioned,the story lines in operas can be\n\npretty silly. Luckily most are in foreign languages and you can invent\n\nyour own plot as you go. It's usually better not to know what's going on.\n\n--\n\nTony Rothman\n\nUT Austin\n\nrobert seigler (babsd...@webtv.net) wrote:\n\n>some years ago, this question was asked on the opera quiz, and it\n\n>continues to bother me. on the 'detested composer' thread, for example,\n\n>several people dismissed as intolerable the true giants of the operatic\n\n>literature. why?\n\n>whoever mentioned rossini must have forgot his wonderful overtures, and\n\n>i'm sure verdi's requiem is enjoyed by those who can't abide rigoletto.\n\n>so it's not their music that's hated, but the whole concept of opera.\n\n>why?\n\nSpeaking only for myself- and I suspect others' answers differ- I love\n\nopera.

Verdi's operas are through-composed - especially his late\n\noperas. Otello and Aida as merely vocal acrobatics? It's all in the\n\nservice of the plot and characterization, as much as the Wagner you\n\nlove is.\n\nAnd as for Rossini, I love his operas, but you need bel canto singers\n\n(and instrumentalists!) to perform them well, and very few are around\n\nnowadays. But there's another point: A couple of years ago, I saw an\n\ninterview with a good Italian conductor on RAI-2. He explained the\n\nRossini was in many ways the last BAROQUE composer, and that the\n\nDoctrine of the Affections applies to his opera arias: each one\n\nexpresses one particular emotion which a character feels in relation\n\nto what's happening in the plot. Vocal display? Sure! But there's a\n\nrhyme and reason to it. I would cite La Cenerentola as a good example\n\nof an opera with a coherent plot that is quite well served by the\n\nmusic. Donizetti is from the next generation, so he comes out of\n\nRossini but is more Romantic. I think that the Donizetti operas I know\n\nare very dramatic and, again, the vocal display expresses emotion.\n\nThink of the Mad Scene from Lucia di Lamermoor. Is that just an excuse\n\nfor vocal (and flute) display, or is it a real attempt to musically\n\nportray a person at her wits' end?\n\nDo you dislike Carmen, too? That opera is full of vocal display and,\n\nindeed, instrumental display. And I couldn't think of a more dramatic\n\nopera.\n\n[snip]\n\n>I'm inclined to call the opera I'm most likely to enjoy \"symphonic\"\n\n>opera; the orchestra not only has a role, but there is an overall\n\n>sense and often real depth (not always of the depressing kind- joy and\n\n>grief are both consistent with frivolity and with depth- though\n\n>my favorite opera, The Fiery Angel, is depressing indeed) and a linear\n\n>direction to the goings-on.\n\n[snip]\n\nAnd how is this not true of the late operas of Verdi and the mature\n\noperas of Puccini?

His opera \"Alfonso und Estrella\" was probably the first\n\nGerman opera not containing spoken dialogue (predating Weber's \"Euryanthe\"\n\nby a year). And he most certainly *aspired* to do so -- he felt he could\n\nnot be considered a real success unless he was a successful opera\n\ncomposer.\n\nSchubert's operas and other works for theater include:\n\nOperas / Singspiele:\n\nAlfonso and Estrella, D.732\n\nDer Minnesanger (lost), D.981\n\nDer vierjährige Posten, D.190\n\nDes Teufels Lustschloss, D.84\n\nDie Freunde von Salamanka, D.326\n\nDie Verschworenen (Der häusliche Krieg), D.787\n\nDie Zwillingsbrüder, D.647\n\nFernando, D.220\n\nFierrabras, D.796\n\nIncomplete Operas / Singspiele or Fragments:\n\nAdrast, D.137\n\nDer Teufel als Hydraulicus\n\nDer Spiegelritter, D.11\n\nDie Burgschaft, D.435\n\nClaudine von Villa Bella, D.239\n\nSakuntala, D.701\n\nSketches:\n\nDer Graf von Gleichen (Schubert's death intervened), D.918\n\nRüdiger (sketches for two acts), D.791\n\n\"Sofie,\" D.982 (the name of the main character)\n\nMelodrama:\n\nDie Zauberharfe, D.664\n\nIncidental Music:\n\nRosamunde, D.797\n\nArias for insertion into other composers' operas:\n\nDuet and aria for Hérold's Das Zauberglöcken, D.723\n\nThe only one of his operas Schubert is known to have seen produced is \"Die\n\nZwillingsbrüder\" in 1820. The music was a huge success.\n\nOne of Schubert's problems was that in 1821 the Vienna Court Opera was\n\nleased to the Italian impresario from the operas in Milan and Naples and\n\nhe basically took over the opera house in Vienna until 1827 or 1828\n\n(during his some of Schubert's most productive years -- he died in 1828).\n\nThe Italian brought Rossini to Vienna to conduct. Rossini-mania swept\n\nVienna and German opera was not heard in Vienna during that time. (One\n\nvisitor to Vienna in 1827 wrote: \"It has been said that the people of\n\nVienna are Rossini mad, but they are not onlky mad for him, but mad for\n\nhis worst imitations.\" Therefore, none of Schubert's later pieces, which\n\nwere written in German, was given a real production. This means, of\n\ncourse, that he was unable to make any revisions to his that might have\n\nbecome evident based on rehearsals of the works.\n\nAnother reason Schubert's operas are not so well known is that he seemed\n\nto have been quite uncritical when it came to working with his\n\nlibrettists. He worked with whatever he was given, and had no sense of\n\nwhether it would be theatrically successful or not. So weak librettos\n\nresulted in somewhat weak results, but the music Schubert composed is\n\noutstanding. Listening to the brass that opens the overture to \"Alfonso\n\nund Estrella\" composed in 1821, you would think you were listening to\n\nBruckner -- Schubert was quite adventurous and ahead of his time in his\n\nmusic for the theater, more so than in his symphonic output.\n\nSo maybe Brahms and Bruckner didn't write opera, but the same can't be\n\nsaid about Schubert.\n\n\n\nI would say that anyone who considers him/herself an opera hater cannot\n\npossibly be a serious music lover.\n\nThe posted question - and many of the responses to the same - seem to divide\n\nclassical listeners into two catagories: stupid people who like all of that\n\noperatic \"screaming,\" and intelligent sorts for whom music must be a deep\n\nmental exercise to be enjoyed at the highest levels.\n\nThis is so much poppycock. I suggest that those who find opera and/or singing\n\nrepulsive or below their appreciation level get a grip and make the effort to\n\nlearn what is in this art form that makes it both popular AND intellectually\n\nsatisfying. None of us sprang fully formed in our appreciation of the classics.\n\nVocal music is simply another challenge to face...and the rewards are there to\n\nbe had.\n\nThe trouble people have stems from 1) the language barrier and 2) the fact that\n\nthis music is not considered to be \"absolute\" in that it's tied to the stage\n\nmachinery. I would remind you that many of the greatest strides in\n\ncompositional form were made through the lowly forms of opera (and other vocal\n\nforms) where composers felt the freedom to break the rules (and new ground)\n\nbecause they could count on the tenor stamping his foot or the audience\n\nclapping over some compositional indiscretion (I'm speaking metaphorically\n\nhere, of course).\n\nAlmost every great composer wrote operas or aspired to do so. Is it any wonder\n\nthat notable exceptions (or failures) include Brahms, Bruckner, and Schubert?\n\nOh, yes...they're all Germans, and weren't we all taught (thank you, Virgil\n\nThomson) that the Germans were the \"smart\" composers and all of those Italians\n\nwrote \"easy\" music, pretty tunes with a bunch of non-intellectual oom-pah\n\naccompaniments under them (of course, we don't disparage Mozart, Beethoven &\n\nHaydn using the Alberti bass in their piano sonatas!)?\n\nSomeone in this thread complained about opera plots being unbelieveable, citing\n\nCavalleria rusticana as an example.

And it\n\nused to be a common practice even in the 18th century to sell the book\n\nof words in opera houses.\n\nThe problem is also, of course, that opera is a visual art.

You will be listening to opera music, not opera, just\n\nas ballet music on CD is not ballet. Not to mention the whole atmosphere\n\nof a theatre and the knowledge that there is not going to be a major\n\ninterruption until the end of each act.

(Quite apart from such\n\nhorrors of attending live music as candy unwrapping, beepers, snoring,\n\nchattering, fidgeting, etc., etc.)\n\n: So, if you usually listen to music on CDs, you'll never have a real\n\n: opera experience.

But if the ballet music is any good, that can be satisfying;\n\nunfortunately most of it isn't good enough to be self-supporting (the\n\nsame is true, but less so, of opera).\n\nSimon\n\nBecause 99% of the singers sing with uncontrolled vibrato and poor\n\ndynamic expression. On high notes they scream. Why this is tolerated by\n\nopera lovers is beyond my comprehension. There are some good singers in\n\nthis world, but most of them do not have the innate vocal power or\n\ndiscipline that it takes to be an opera singer. And how can ANY music\n\nlover sing the same lines of recitative, night after night? It is a\n\nboring job! Only the 5 or 6 best opera singers who ever lived are even\n\nmusical by the standards we apply to instrumentalists.\n\nI am an opera lover. I have listened to many hundreds of hours worth of\n\nopera, and have often said to myself, wow, that is great music, I wonder\n\nif there is a good recording of it? I have spent 20 years looking for\n\nrecordings of good opera singers, and a present I have only one that I\n\nstill listen to. It is and old LP that I found in a used record store.\n\nIt is an OLD LP, a London issued in 1950, of the first LP recording of\n\nthe young Renatata Tebaldi. The title is \"An Operatic Recital,\" with\n\nRenata Tebaldi's name in relatively small print, recorded in a concert\n\nhall with an ordinary symphony orchestra. There are two arias on it\n\nwhich are sung with control, which I like, even the others evolveing\n\ninto a bit of screaming. I think she probably reached her prime\n\nprevious to this recording, and everything else that follows it is\n\ninferior in quality. If anyone knows of a recording of Renata previous\n\nto 1950, please let me know.\n\nJust an opinion of an opera lover who hates opera performances.\n\nBill Bailer\n\nwba...@cris.com, Rochester NY USA, tel:716-473-9556\n\nAcoustics, piano technology, music theory, JSBach"
