        "text": "British film music in the 1930s might be defined by its variety. Unlike its Hollywood counterpart, there was no fully developed 'production line' system to the creation of film scores. However most studios still had a musical director, who was responsible for brokering composer deals and seeing a project to completion. This paper will examine a few individuals working in Britain at the time, including Muir Mathieson, Arthur Bliss and Mischa Spolianski, and will unpack some of the diplomacy that had to be negotiated to produce some of the major scores of the period. I will ask to what extent MDs actually engineered the stylistic direction of the music, and why some working relationships lasted whilst others withered.\n\nProduction files detailing the construction of the musical score for the film Spellbound reveal an intense and complicated collaboration involving music editor Audray Granville, director Alfred Hitchcock, composer Miklós Rózsa, and producer David O. Selznick. Tracing the formation of the score from initial outlines through composition and editing shows how these four individuals contributed to the score’s development. Conflicting instructions from Hitchcock and Selznick as well as Granville’s preview score influenced Rózsa’s compositional decisions, and Granville’s revisions of Rózsa’s recorded music affected the content of the score. The music of Spellbound does not represent a single or even shared vision, but rather an intricate conglomeration of ideas, revisions, and interpolations. Illuminating these layers of discourse enriches musico-cinematic analysis by challenging conventional notions of authorship and artistic control in the Hollywood film score.\n\n[This article was published 17 years ago in 1998, in the online journal Screening the Past: http://www.screeningthepast.com/2014/12/composing-the-past-music-and-the-sense-of-history-in-hollywood-spectacles-of-the-1950s-and-early-1960s/ ] The sound of history has long been a neglected area in the study of historical film. This is somewhat surprising when we think about the fact that historical films have always made auditive comments on the past, not only on how people spoke in the ancient times but also how the bygone period sounded, what kind of auditive elements did that particular historical era have: in ancient spectacle we hear noisy marketplaces of Jerusalem, roaring masses of Roman circuses, echoing catacombes of Rome. Films have not only given an illusion of seeing but also of hearing the past. This article emphasizes three specific questions. The first one is: How did composers themselves conceive the problem of historicity, the difference between ancient music and our modern perspective. Historical narration, no matter written or audiovisual, is always a dialogue between historical horizons, past and present. How was this dealt with in the case of film music? This problem is illuminated by analyzing Miklós Rózsa’s methods of composing. The next question is: How did film music encompass the interplay of historicity and universality, especially in the case of Biblical films that wanted to stress their ever-relevant message. Third question is: Did music have any real commentative role in these filmic historical narratives or did it only have a supporting function? To this end, Dimitri Tiomkin’s score for The Fall of the Roman Empire will be examined to consider whether music can make a serious contribution to the historical interpretation within a film.\n\nThis project examines how music expresses the complexities of urban existence in contemporary Hollywood films. To do this I trace the history of Hollywood film music, while surveying existing literature on film scores. Significantly, I include commentary from practitioners to authenticate an evolving model of scoring practices, in addition to ideas from musicologists, film studies and film music academics. The early chapters describe the development of the specially-composed classical score, the rise of the pre-existing pop score, and the introduction of hybrid scores. Paying equal attention to classical and pop scores, I conduct a film musicological analysis of three contemporary existentialist films - Heat (1995), Magnolia (1999) and Moulin Rouge (2001). I explore ideas expressed by, among others, Claudia Gorbman on the persuasive power of the &#39;unheard&#39; classical score, and by Anahid Kassabian on the open-ended permutations of the &#39;heard&#39; pop score, in order to unr..."
