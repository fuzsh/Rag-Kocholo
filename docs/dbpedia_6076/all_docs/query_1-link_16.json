        "text": "Film\n\nStephen Holden\n\nTwo recent, smart French films  “Angel of Mine” and “The Joy of Singing”  can be seen on IFC Films video-on-demand service. “ANGEL OF MINE,” directed by Safy Nebbou, stars Catherine Frot as Elsa, an emotionally unstable woman in the midst of a divorce who spots a pretty little girl at a birthday party attended by her son and is convinced that the girl is her daughter, who died in a hospital fire days after her birth. Elsa stalks the girl’s mother, Claire (Sandrine Bonnaire), by posing as a prospective buyer for the house of the family, which is moving to Canada. There is an inevitable showdown. The beautifully acted film suggests a sophisticated descendant of “The Great Lie,” the 1941 weepie starring Bette Davis and Mary Astor.\n\n“THE JOY OF SINGING” is a multisexual comedy involving the search for a missing USB flash drive in the possession of a classical voice teacher who is the widow of a uranium trafficker. After undercover agents and spies from here and there enroll in her class, a great deal of comic bed hopping ensues among some very unlikely couples in search of information. Although characters die, this fizzy, semicoherent movie sustains an airy screwball tone from start to finish. It also works as libidinal stimulant.\n\nThe movies are available on demand on the following cable systems: Brighthouse, Cablevision, Comcast and Time Warner.\n\nTheater\n\nJason Zinoman\n\nIf William Shakespeare did return Sir John Falstaff to life on the orders of the queen, as the legend about the origins of “The Merry Wives of Windsor” goes, what does that say about the playwright? The idea that Shakespeare would do such a thing usually draws knowing chuckles from college professors, but since it’s been more than four centuries now, and the guy’s reputation is pretty secure, can’t we say that “Merry Wives” may have been something of a sellout? If Harry S. Truman asked Arthur Miller to bring back that wonderful Willy Loman in the early 1950s, I’d like to think that Miller would have balked. Bill Cain’s speculative historical drama, “Equivocation,” imagines the thought process of a Shakespeare-like character under pressure from the state. That character, named Shag and played by John Pankow, is ordered by King James to write a friendly drama about the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 that fabricates history to serve the purposes of the government. Filled with historical digressions, literary in-jokes and plays within plays (expect scenes from “Macbeth” and “King Lear”), the ambitious comic play, which has received stellar reviews in regional productions, presents a pragmatic artist struggling with his conscience, among other considerations. The great Garry Hynes (“The Beauty Queen of Leenane”) directs. Starts previews on Tuesday, Manhattan Theater Club at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, mtc-nyc.org; $75.\n\nTelevision\n\nNeil Genzlinger\n\nThis week brings assorted season finales and premieres (for instance, CBS rolls out “Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains” on Thursday), not to mention the Super Bowl and the start of the Winter Olympics. So PBS’s “Independent Lens” offering (Tuesday night on many stations; check local listings) may have even more trouble than usual getting noticed. But it’s a good one, and a different sort of film for this consistently rewarding series.\n\nThe film, by Gabriel Noble, is called “P-STAR RISING,” and it chronicles the aspirations of one of the most self-assured kids you’ll ever see. She is Priscilla Star Diaz  known by the stage name P-Star  who is 9 when the film begins and already working Harlem clubs late at night, honing a rap act under the tutelage of her father, Jesse.\n\nThough P-Star is now a teenager and has achieved modest success (most notably as a cast member of the children’s show “The Electric Company”), this is no feel-good story. It’s a study of a fractured family’s daily struggles juxtaposed against a child’s dreams of transcending those struggles through a stardom that proves elusive. Jesse Diaz, who has served prison time, is raising P-Star and her sister alone. Where’s Mom? “She was pretty,” P-Star says bluntly. “My aunt and her. But they all became crackheads.”\n\nDance\n\nJack Anderson\n\nLooking up at lighted apartment windows at night, it’s easy to wonder about the people inside. Who are they? What are they feeling? What do they hope? What do they fear? How has life treated them? In 1955 Anna Sokolow, a choreographer with a strong social conscience who must often have mulled over such matters, put her wonderings onstage in “Rooms.” She created a portrait gallery of city dwellers  most of them lonely or unhappy  in a shabby apartment house, and she theatrically symbolized their rooms with arrangements of chairs. Sokolow, who died in 2000, would have been 100 years old this year, and the LIMÓN DANCE COMPANY is honoring her with a revival of “Rooms,” with its searing jazz score by Kenyon Hopkins played live by performers from the Manhattan School of Music jazz department, conducted by Justin DiCioccio. The Limón company’s program also includes one of José Limón’s best-known works of the ’50s, “There Is a Time” (1956), a dance interpretation of the passage from Ecclesiastes that in the English Standard Version begins, “For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die” and “a time for war, and a time for peace.” Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-3353, Ext. 10; $50.\n\nPop\n\nNate Chinen\n\nFor any young jazz pianist, especially one with a working trio, no symbol of arrival is more potent than a booking at the Village Vanguard. So there’s some built-in pressure behind next week’s first go-round by the GERALD CLAYTON TRIO. Not that the band’s leader seems inclined to let nerves get in the way.\n\nQuite the contrary: Gerald Clayton, whose father is the bassist John Clayton, comes to the club at 25 with a wealth of composure, an abundance of charisma and a useful range of experience. In 2006 he placed a strong second at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition, and since then he has served in bands led by the trumpeter Roy Hargrove. Last week he was at the Grammy Awards: a track from “Two-Shade” (ArtistShare), his self-assured debut, had earned him a nomination for best improvised jazz solo. Among the other nominees was Mr. Hargrove, for an album on which Mr. Clayton appears.\n\n“Two-Shade” features the same crisp rhythm team behind Mr. Clayton next week: Joe Sanders on bass and Justin Brown on drums. (Mr. Sanders, oddly enough, also came in second at the Monk Competition, last year.) The album captures a group laying claim to the postbop mainstream, with acres of talent and style. Of course it also augurs well for the Vanguard, which has always found room for another piano trio with its own point to prove. Tuesday through next Sunday at Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.\n\nClassical\n\nVivien Schweitzer\n\nIn the summer of 2008 at the Mostly Mozart Festival, KARI KRIIKKU offered a remarkable performance of Mozart’s glorious Clarinet Concerto with the Minnesota Orchestra, performing with a ravishing tone and alluring sensitivity. On Saturday at Carnegie Hall he joins the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC for the United States premiere of the Clarinet Concerto by Magnus Lindberg, the Philharmonic’s composer in residence. In this welcome chance to hear the orchestra away from Avery Fisher Hall, the music director, Alan Gilbert, also conducts Wagner’s “Rienzi” Overture and Sibelius’s Symphony No. 2. Saturday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $116.\n\nThe George London Foundation recital series (named for the renowned American bass-baritone) pairs established singers and recent winners of the foundation’s awards. On Sunday at the Morgan Library & Museum, the tenor SEAN PANIKKAR  whose vibrant performance of “Ah, la paterna mano” from “Macbeth” garnered him an award during the foundation’s annual competition in March  partners with the soprano JUNE ANDERSON for a program featuring works by Beethoven, Rossini, Bellini, Tchaikovsky, Duparc, Bizet, Weill and Parry. Sunday at 4:30 p.m., Gilder Lehrman Hall, Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org or georgelondon.org; $45.\n\nArt\n\nCarol Vogel\n\nWhile most of us might not fancy wearing a dress fashioned from wool cobwebs or cheesecloth, metallic mohair fringe or twine, it’s fascinating stuff to appreciate as 21st-century wearable art. Clothes made from all of the above can be found at “QUICKTAKE: RODARTE,” an exhibition at the Smithsonian’s COOPER-HEWITT, NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM from Thursday through March 14.\n\nKate and Laura Mulleavy, sisters from Pasadena, Calif., founded the fashion label Rodarte in 2005. Since then they have won all kinds of design awards and received a lot of attention for the celebrities they dress: Michelle Obama as well as movie stars like Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman and Reese Witherspoon. Their designs, on sale in department stores, have also landed in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute and the Fashion Institute of Technology.\n\nCooper-Hewitt’s show, the second in a series of installations featuring emerging names, will include many of Rodarte’s most inventive designs. Like sculptures on mannequins, the pieces in the exhibition will highlight the unusual level of detail and workmanship that goes into every garment. It will also illustrate the sisters’ imaginative use of traditional materials.\n\nDestruction is a recurring theme in their work. Materials like silk, cheesecloth and lace, for instance, are burned, sandpapered, ripped and painted to look as though they emerged from a ravaged desert landscape. Leather is aged and hand-painted so it takes on a marbled effect. Some of their designs are Gothic, others almost space age, and then there are those so sophisticated and beautiful they could well have been lifted off a Paris runway. Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan; (212) 849-8400."
