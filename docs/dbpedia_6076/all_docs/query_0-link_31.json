Come as early as 6:30 to meet and greet your fellow singers. Our 46th season opens with “Baroque Brilliance: 1685 — It was a Very Good Year!” , 2:00 November 24 at Maynard High School. We open with Giovanni Gabrieli’s stunning “Jubilate Duo” for double chorus and brass, then feature the three great Baroque composers all born in 1685 — Scarlotti (two beautiful motets), Handel (delightful and sensuous selections from Solomon); and Bach’s profound “Gerechte kommt um”, closing the program with his familiar “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring. All are accompanied by full orchestra. Once again we have been invited to sing in three performances of “Christmas Magic” with the Vista Philharmonic at the spectacular, world-class performance venue, Groton Hill Performance Center. What a wonderful way to welcome the holiday season, and to experience the Gabrieli and other popular favorites from the stage of this extraordinary hall! “Romantic Riches: music by Mendelssohn and Brahms” explores the emotional depths of these great composer, including Mendelssohn’s Psalm 42 and Brahms’ motets, Nanie and Schicksalslied, again with full orchestra. Concert is April 13 at Littleton High School. The season closes June 1 with “A Garden of Song”, featuring music by diverse composers such as Sarah Quartel, Elaine Hagenberg, Melanie DeMore and others. We are a friendly and welcoming group whose singers hail from 20+ towns in the Metrowest area and beyond. Membership is open to anyone who can match pitch, learn the music, and blend with the other voices. We particularly need some strong Tenor voices to join our group for the upcoming year. Artistic Director Barbara Jones and Assistant Artistic Director Christina Kennedy promote serious musicianship at weekly rehearsals that are lively, challenging, educational, and always fun!

We teach children to recognize colors and to categorize objects by similarities and differences, but when a child remarks on someone's skin color, eye shape, or other physical characteristics, many caregivers feel embarrassed and don't know what to say, because we were taught not to talk about race. We now know that talking explicitly with children about skin color, race, ethnicity and discrimination is the best way to prevent them from absorbing the racist ideas prevalent in our culture and media. But it's hard to know where to start and what to say. If you're wondering how to have these conversations with your children, join Ellie Springer, M.Ed., for a discussion with tips about how to talk about race and racism with young children, receive information on quality children's books on this topic, and recommended websites for further adult learning. This program is appropriate for parents of babies through elementary school. Please join us on Thursday, August 22, 7-8:30 p.m., and bring your questions. First Connections is the local CFCE through the Mass. Dept. of Early Education and Care, providing free playgroups, new parent support, parenting topics and resources to families with children age 0-6. To receive the link for this program, email lmatthews@jri.org.\n\nComedy Night in Littleton!\n\nStart the new season off on a high note. Sit down for some epic stand-up comedy. On Friday night September 6, a trio of comedians will entertain you at the Congregational Church of Littleton, 330 King St. First up: Mark Shea and John Kelly, who will likely share their experiences with road trips gone wrong, social commentary, relatable medical experiences, and personal foibles that will make you laugh at them and, gently, at yourself. Both are experienced performers at clubs, on campuses, and at community events. The headliner is Frank O’Donnell, who was inducted into the Rhode Island Comedy Hall of Fame. The honor finds him in stellar company, including his close friend, writer Danny Smith of “Family Guy.” Frank has written for comics like Bob Hope and Jay Leno. Frank’s passion, besides comedy, is a foundation he started, The Keri Anne O’Donnell Memorial Fund. The foundation commemorates his daughter Keri, a dancer and performer, who died in an auto accident. It provides scholarships for students of performance who need a financial hand up. You never know what Frank will talk about: weight loss (and gain), shows gone very, very wrong, and maybe what it is like to be the quiet kid who made everybody laugh. There may be an extra treat: the church’s pastor is Reverend Jen Munroe Nathans, a friend of Frank’s and a seasoned comic herself with experience at Chicago’s famous Second City in her resume. Tickets are $15 until September and $20 thereafter, including at the door if the event isn’t sold out. Get your tickets by calling the church office at 978 486 3245. The fun begins at 7 pm; doors open at 6:30. This is a great way to kick off the fall school-and-overwhelming-calendars season with good hearty laughs, which are actually healthy. Imagine that: something fun that’s actually good for you.

With that, the Hudson Eagles are pleased to invite you to join us in support of our 14th Annual Ride for Why Me-Sherry's House on Sunday Sept 8th at the Hudson MA Eagles-271 Cox Street. Registrations begin at 9:00am with Kick Stands up at 11:00am. Donation of $20 for rider and the passenger $10. Don't ride? Join us at 1:00 for the BBQ for a donation of $10.00.\n\nEnjoy the great ride up to Princeton and arrive back at the Eagles around 1:15 for cookout and chances for some great donations.\n\nWhy Me is a Worcester Based non-profit organization created to help families who are being treated at Boston Children's Hospital and UMass Oncology cope with childhood cancer. Why Me is not affiliated with any national organization. These children come from all over the world to be treated at our great hospitals.\n\nWhy Me was started in 1985 by 13-year-old Sherry Shepherd during her four year battle with cancer. In the last months of her life, Sherry became determined to do something that would have a lasting value in the community to help children with cancer. With the help of her dad, she founded the non-profit organization WHY ME, which stands for Worcester Help for Youth, Memories Everlasting.\n\nToday, over 36 years later, Why Me offers a comprehensive approach to supporting the entire family through a pediatric cancer diagnosis. We are here from the moment a family hears the words “your child has cancer” and continues throughout every step of their journey. When a child is diagnosed with cancer, the effect on the entire family is profound and pervasive. The initial diagnosis is devastating, followed by fear and anxiety for all that lies ahead. Pediatric cancer protocols can last years and life is disrupted not just emotionally but financially as well. Through our all-encompassing support services and programs, families find the tools and assistance needed to manage these changes. The organization continues to be managed in part by individuals who have had a child with cancer and wish to help others who now face the same challenge. This deeply felt personal perspective serves as a guiding light in delivering services that are essential, compassionate and life affirming.\n\nWhat “support” means:\n\nWhile a childhood cancer diagnosis may be the most difficult challenge a family can face, with tangible support, guidance and friendship, together we can make this difficult time a little easier. Through family fun events, dinners, group outings, summer camp and other programs, families forge enduring bonds of friendship through the power of a shared common experience. From support groups, to logistical and financial support, as well as staff visits – whether at home, hospital or clinic – families receive support to address the specific ways their families’ lives have been disrupted. At Why Me we are always striving to meet the unique and increased needs of every family with ever-expanding programming that benefits each child and each family here in our community now, when they need it most. All support and services Why Me provides are free of charge.\n\nThe challenges facing today’s kids: Free sessions offer solutions\n\nResearch shows that American kids today are more likely to be anxious or depressed than American kids from a couple of decades ago. It also shows an alarmingly widening gender gap in academic achievement: the boys are getting left in the dust. This is not because girls are doing better (although they are), but primarily because boys are doing worse. Yet girls have their own challenges. While alcohol and drug use among boys has remained stable or even dropped over the last 40 years, use among girls has soared. As if these challenges weren’t enough, any parent today knows that guiding kids safely through the obstacles of social media and video games is an exhausting and uphill climb.\n\nDr. Leonard Sax will share evidence-based insights and research-backed solutions related to these topics and more in a series of informational sessions titled Improving the Odds for Our Kids and hosted by Mt. Calvary Church in Acton, MA, in September. A physician, psychologist, and author of the New York Times bestseller The Collapse of Parenting, Dr. Sax has spoken about topics relevant to raising and working with today’s youth at more than 500 schools, juvenile correctional facilities, communities of faith, and other venues around the world.\n\n“I’m really excited to be bringing Dr. Sax and his message to the greater Acton community,” says Kerry Evans, one of the event organizers and a Harvard resident. “I first read his book Boys Adrift when my teenage sons were little, and it left a huge impression on me. It changed the way I raised my kids.”\n\n“As a grandmother raising two grandchildren with ADHD, I’m excited to hear Dr. Sax’s evidence-based advice for guiding our kids to become capable, confident adults,” adds co-organizer Dawn Phelan, who is planning to attend all sessions.\n\nBut the sessions aren’t just for parents and grandparents. Educators, medical professionals, and anyone interested in supporting kids will find them relevant.\n\n“I first heard Dr. Sax interviewed as a guest on a podcast, and I was really interested in what he had to say about the importance of ‘rites of passage’ for girls and boys on their journey to becoming healthy women and men,” says Acton resident Naomi Veeder. “Even though I don't have children of my own, I have nieces, nephews and friends' children that are in my life and that I care deeply about, and so I'm looking forward to hearing more from him on how I can support them on their journey to adulthood.”\n\nThe sessions take place Friday and Saturday, September 27 and 28 and are free and open to the public. However, because space is limited, the organizers suggest that people register ahead of time to reserve their spot. For more information and to register, visit www.mtcalvaryacton.org/improvingtheodds. If you have questions, email workshops@mtcalvaryacton.org or call (978) 263-5156. Mt. Calvary is located at 472 Massachusetts Avenue, Acton, MA. Parking (including handicap) is available behind the church, off Prospect Street. Parking attendants will direct attendees to overflow parking options.\n\nDiscovery Day Open House at Concord Conservatory of Music\n\nInstrument Exploration for Kids & Adults on Saturday, September 7, from 1 – 3 pm\n\nJoin us for a free, fun, and interactive afternoon event for kids and adults!

Mangiaratti announces that the Town of Acton will share in a $187,450 grant from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) to implement a bike share program.\n\nThe grant will be divided among Acton, Concord, Maynard, and Lincoln.\n\nThe Town of Acton will use the funding to implement a three-year regional bike share program. The program will consist of seven stations and 42 bikes,\n\nincluding seven adaptive bikes across the four communities. These bikes can be used for recreational purposes or to commute to and from one of the four commuter rail stations along the bike share's route. The program stations will be located at Brook Street, Concord Road/East Acton Village Green, and the South Acton Commuter Lot Station.\n\nMaking bikes accessible to residents increases bike connections across the region while improving the Town's health, equity, and environmental preservation. The program also aims to improve access to existing public transportation.\n\nMassDOT awarded $6.5 million in funding to 28 municipalities and two Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs) as part of the Healey-Driscoll Administration’s Shared Streets and Spaces Program. The program provides project funding to help municipalities design and implement changes to curbs, streets, and parking areas in support of public health, safe mobility, and community growth and revitalization.\n\nThe four towns applied for the grant after the success of the 2023 Minuteman Bike Share pilot program, in the hopes of closing last mile connections to public transportation and lowering emissions in the transportation sector by decreasing community-wide dependency on vehicles.\n\n\"This funding is essential in expanding our efforts to provide accessible recreation and transportation options to our community,\" said Town Manager Mangiaratti. \"Residents received the pilot program positively, and we are happy to be able to continue and expand this program.\"\n\nCommunity Blood Drive.

This Climate Café looks at three elements of the travel dilemma. 1) What are the climate costs of travel? 2) Can we reimagine or re-prioritize how we travel? And 3) when we do need to travel long distances, are there sustainability tips to help lessen the CO2 consequences of transportation? We will explore how people, near and far, are addressing these issues with some innovative approaches. Please come and share your thoughts and ideas! More info at EnergizeActon.org or at the Acton Memorial Library.\n\nBecome an Adult ESOL or Basic Literacy Tutor!\n\nHave you been looking for a great volunteer opportunity?

These programs are open to the public, free of charge.\n\n“The conservation movement often acts as if we all enjoy nature in the same way, and have the same access, but this is simply not true, ” said Sally Purrington Hild, Engagement and Events Manager for the organization.\n\nThe Outdoor Voices series kicks off on August 24 at Wolbach Farm in Sudbury. The program will feature Amarachukwu Ifeji, Director of Policy at the Maine Environmental Education Association.\n\nMs. Ifeji, who is of Igbo descent, will explore the history of the conservation movement in the United States, which has traditionally excluded people of color from outdoor spaces. She will share her personal experiences of environmental exclusion, discuss how she combats these injustices through environmental education, and highlight the critical importance of centering historically marginalized voices in environmental, climate, and conservation movements.\n\nThe August 24 program is co-sponsored by Professionals of Color in the Environment (POCIE), a statewide community that strives to dismantle barriers and advance racial equity within the environmental discipline.\n\nNia Keith, cofounder of POCIE and vice president for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Justice at Mass Audubon, will moderate a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of Ms. Ifeji’s presentation.\n\n“Amara is a brilliant and poetic speaker who wowed a crowd of 185 guests at an SVT event this past spring,” said Cecil Hynds-Riddle, Director of Development at SVT. “Prepare to challenge your assumptions and think deeply about how conservation and social justice interact in our local community.”\n\nMs. Ifeji’s presentation will be held on Saturday, August 24, from 10:00 a.m. to noon in the Barn at Wolbach Farm, 18 Wolbach Road, Sudbury. The public is invited to attend this free event, but registration is required at www.svtweb.org/voices.\n\nSVT is a nonprofit land trust that conserves natural areas and farmland in 36 communities around the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers.

The primary goal of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant is to meet the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and non-affiliated emergency medical service organizations.\n\nAccording to FEMA, 2,300 people died in home fires in the United States in 2023, including 85 firefighters. Through the AFG grants, recipients will be able to fund critically needed resources to better equip and train emergency response personnel, enhance operational efficiencies, foster communications interoperability between emergency responders and support community risk reduction and resilience.\n\nThe Concord Fire Department will use the funding to cover the costs of a paramedic program, including employee salary, tuition, and educational materials to train existing staff. Currently, Concord Fire provides ambulance service at the Basic Life Support (BLS) level. This grant will allow the department to increase the service model to the Advanced Life Support (ALS) level, which will reduce the response time to have a paramedic at the patient’s side and increase ALS availability, resulting in better outcomes.\n\nThe Concord Fire Department has received past AFG grants, $93,348 in 2022 and $286,666 in 2021.\n\n\"This grant allows us to enhance our ability to protect our community by providing a higher level of EMS service,\" said Chief Judge. \"We are extremely grateful to have this funding to strengthen the efficiency of our Department. We are excited to begin our next steps.\" This is a message from the Concord Fire Department.\n\nMemory Lane Café at the Acton Senior Center\n\nAugust 27, 2024, 12:00-1:30 pm at the Acton Senior Center, 30 Sudbury Road, Rear, Acton.

As usual, scammers are taking advantage of the building excitement. This time, they are cashing in with phony tickets—and even fake events.\n\nHow the scam works:\n\nYou see a fantastic deal on tickets to a summer festival in your area, usually through a link on social media. The event promises live music, all-you-can-eat meals, craft beer or wine, or other fun activities.\n\nWhen you click the social media link, it takes you to a professional website with fantastic pictures. You enter your credit card information to buy tickets and think you are all set. But before you buy, do a little research. Whether the event is non-existent, merely disappointing, or you just bought phony tickets, the result is the same: someone pockets your hard-earned money!\n\nBBB Scam Tracker has received numerous reports from people who purchased fake tickets to actual events or events that have yet to materialize.\n\nA customer in Memphis reported buying tickets for $220 for a concert: \"I saw an offer for presale tickets for the group Khruangbin for a concert in May. I clicked on the links and it lead me to what looked like a legit site until I realized that they are a resellers site and had marked up the ticket prices tremendously. The prices were also in USD and the service charge was astounding. I contacted the company right away but they just dismiss and ignore. They are SCAMMERS and need to be off the market. They have scammed lots of people and it is very humiliating and stressful.\"\n\nOne consumer who purchased tickets to a fake beer crawl reported: “Reviews across multiple platforms make it clear that these events are at best extremely misleading or at worst canceled. No refunds are given, even when their inconsistent and mostly-unreachable customer service email address responds to confirm a refund will be provided.”\n\nHow to spot a fake festival:\n\n*Research before you buy. Search online for the festival's name and ensure the name advertised matches the website. Scammers often use names that sound similar to those of real festivals.\n\n*Check for (working) contact information. The festival website should have a real phone number and email address.\n\n*Watch out for prices that sound too good to be true. There is no way a festival can offer tickets at extremely low prices without losing money. If the prices are much lower than elsewhere, it's likely a scam.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n*Pay with a credit card. You can dispute the charges if the business doesn't come through. Be wary of online sellers that don’t accept credit cards.\n\n*Look for secure sites. The website should begin with HTTPS (the extra “s” is for security) and have a lock symbol on the address bar.\n\n*Avoid tickets sold on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and other free online listings. Scammers are skilled at providing realistic tickets and fake receipts. Check out third-party ticket sites at BBB.org before making purchases.\n\nFor more information:\n\nRead BBB's tips for buying tickets to an event.

Making changes to your eating habits can be done at your own pace and with little financial investment — but it can have a big climate impact! This topic will be explored by EnergizeActon.org at its annual potluck picnic, A Celebration of Plant-Based Food, on Wednesday, July 17th, 6-8pm, at NARA Park Pavilion. The aim of the potluck is to share delicious options in plant-based meals and to highlight the carbon savings when we eat lower on the food chain. Community members are invited to participate by bringing a plant-based dish, plus the recipe, to the event. Energize Acton will also display vegetarian/vegan cookbooks and food/climate titles at the potluck. Feel free to contribute your favorite \"foodie book\" for the evening. This will be a low-waste event.

All proceeds from the race will support Open Table’s mission to address food insecurity in the Metrowest area.\n\nThe Sunrise Classic is co-organized by two recent Concord Carlisle High School graduates, Thomas Rivier of Carlisle and William Anstey of Concord. Both ran a full season of track, cross country and indoor track as students and wanted to create a fun summer event for local runners that would also give back to the community.\n\n“We already knew about Open Table because of the food drives conducted by the CCHS cross country team. We needed an official 501(c)(3) organization to partner with in order to get sponsors and insurance for The Sunrise Classic. Open Table was the perfect fit,” said William Anstey.\n\n“Both the 5K and mile races will be run on Emerson Field Track so that all runners record official times that will help them set their goals and training programs for the fall track season,” said Thomas Rivier. William and Thomas chose the early morning start time to steer clear of the summer heat and are unphased by questions about the “Sunrise” aspect of the event. Thomas remarked, “The local running community is always up for something unique and crazy. You’d be surprised how many people will wake up in the dark to take part in a race that starts at dawn.”\n\nThanks to race sponsors Middlesex Bank, ASICS, Carlisle Cutters, and Run House, the Sunrise Classic will offer medals across multiple age groups for each event. In addition, all participants will receive a free Sunrise Classic T-shirt.\n\nRegistration is $35 for each event and will remain open until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, August 2. To register, go to: https://runsignup.com/Race/MA/Concord/TheSunriseClassic2024\n\nFree Playgroups for Babies\n\nFirst Connections is offering free playgroups this summer for babies and their caregivers, beginning the week of July 15.

The Merry Wives of Windsor will be presented on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays, July 20-27 at 5 PM.\n\nOne of Shakespeare’s funniest and most accessible comedies, The Merry Wives of Windsor is, in many ways, a thoroughly modern production. “I think of Merry Wives as a contemporary soap opera,” says Director Jim Porter. “Everything is just pitched a little higher, everything is a bit more over the top, it’s all very dramatic … which, of course, makes for great comedy.”\n\nThe two Merry Wives, played by Hannah Clifford (Mistress Ford) and Jacey Lynn Rutledge (Mistress Page) are simultaneously wooed by the arrogant yet oblivious Falstaff (played by Mike Haddad). Once they discover his brazen pursuit, they decide to have a little fun at his expense and go to extensive lengths to make him look like a fool.\n\n“Hannah and I have several scenes where we team up to undermine Falstaff’s egotism and self-importance,” says Jacey. “Our characters know what’s going on. The audience knows what’s going on. But Falstaff has no idea, which is a lot of fun.”\n\nMike Haddad, a frequent performer and director with The World’s A Stage Players, turns Falstaff’s foibles into comic gold. “His cluelessness is what makes him fun,” says Mike. “He thinks he’s God’s gift to humanity, and assumes everyone else thinks so too. It’s a great role to play and a funny one to watch.”\n\nThe show features some of Shakespeare’s best wordplay. Shakespeare creates several hilarious characters with non-traditional and/or non-English accents – the French Doctor Caius (played by Andrew Harrington) struggles mightily with his English, while the Welsh parson Sir Hugh Evans’ (played by John Small, making his World’s A Stage Players’ debut) malapropisms add to the humor. Andrew’s real-life wife, Jasmine Yong Hall, plays the inn-keeper Mistress Quickly with a full-on cockney accent.\n\nMerry Wives also features strong women characters, which creates a sense of female empowerment that feels distinctly feminist.\n\n“One of the best things about the show is that the women are firmly in charge,” notes Director Jim Porter. “The men range from jovial to profoundly jealous to utterly moronic, but the women are smart, clever and very funny.”\n\nAs always, The World’s A Stage Players draws on a cast of both regulars, occasional returnees and newcomers. Returnees from last summer include Ava Enoch, Michael Jay, Darin Kimball and AJ Gaudreau, along with newcomer Cherry Lynn Zinger and Rutledge. Other familiar faces include Katie Speed, Mike Lague, Julian Willard, Kathleen O’Connor (who is also producing the show) and Ed Bernard. Ed and Andrew Harrington are the only two performers who have\n\nappeared in every World’s A Stage Players’ production. “This is the first time in several years where my character is both alive and married at the end of the show,” says Ed, a Concord resident. “Usually, I’m either dead or alone or both.”\n\nPerformances are scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, July 20, 21, 27 and 28 at 5 PM on the lawn of the Concord Free Public Library, with a rain venue at 51 Walden Street. There is also an indoor air-conditioned performance on Friday, July 26 at 7 PM.\n\nPatrons are invited to bring blankets or chairs and sit on the lawn; a limited number of chairs will be provided.
