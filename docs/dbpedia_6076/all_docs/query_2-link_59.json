Our collaboration with Attack Theatre will be the most groundbreaking for us. In March, we're mounting a completely new production of Igor Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale in which our musicians will accompany a brilliant group of actor/dancers who will bring this brilliant World War I piece to life.

The version of The Buddy Holly Story that we are doing at Flat Rock Playhouse is completely unique and involves some of the most talented performers and musicians in the country. … Our version of The Buddy Holly Story incorporates both live action and pre-recorded scenes. The trick is, there is no line between the pre-recorded moments and the live moments. The characters talk to other characters on the screen as if the screen is simply an extension of the stage. That requires a tremendous amount of planning and rehearsal to make it feel like characters can seamlessly walk off of the stage and onto the screen and vice-versa. — Vincent Marini, producing artistic director\n\nShear Madness (Improvisational armchair-detective comedy)\n\nThrough Oct. 4, downtown\n\nCapitol Steps (non-partisan political satire group)\n\nSept.14-25, main stage\n\nThe British Invasion: The Beatles, The Stones, The Who and Many More (Music on the Rock series)\n\nSept. 25-Oct. 4, second stage\n\nBuddy — The Buddy Holly Story (rock ’n’ roll musical)\n\nOct. 5-30, main stage\n\nThe Kings of Country (Music on the Rock series)\n\nOct. 16-Nov.1, second stage\n\nDoubt (drama)\n\nNov. 3-20, downtown\n\nWalt Disney's Peter Pan Jr. (musical adaptation of the classic film)\n\nNov. 10-20, main stage\n\nStriking 12 (alternative to standard holiday fare)\n\nNov. 28-Dec. 22, downtown\n\nPlaid Tidings (musical revue)\n\nNov. 30-Dec. 22, main stage\n\nA Flat Rock Family Christmas (Music on the Rock series)\n\nDec. 11-20, second stage\n\nSomething Wonderful: The Music of Rodgers and Hammerstein\n\nMarch 28-April 22, 2012, main stage\n\nSay Goodnight, Gracie (uplifting comedy)\n\nApril 18-May 6, 2012, downtown\n\nYour Show of Shows (revisiting 1950s comedy skits from the TV series)\n\nMay 3-May 20, 2012, main stage\n\nNunsense (musical comedy)\n\nMay 16-June 10, 2012, downtown\n\nThe Spitfire Grill (musical)\n\nMay 30-June 24, 2012, main stage\n\nRED (emotional drama about artist Mark Rothko)\n\nJune 20-July 8, 2012, downtown\n\nThe Fox On The Fairway (comedy about golf)\n\nJune 28-July 15, 2012, main stage\n\nProof (drama about mathematics and mental illness)\n\nJuly 18-Aug. 5, 2012, downtown\n\nGuys and Dolls (1950s musical)\n\nJuly 25-Aug. 23, 2012, main stage\n\nThe Marvelous Wonderettes (musical comedy)\n\nAug. 16-Sept. 9, 2012, downtown\n\nNoises Off (comedy)\n\nAug. 23-Sept.9, 2012, main stage\n\nAlmost Maine (comedy about love)\n\nSept. 13-Sept. 23, 2012, main stage\n\nZelda: An American Love Story (musical)\n\nOct. 3-Oct. 28, 2012, main stage\n\nThe Rocky Horror Show (deliberately kitschy, rock 'n' roll cult classic)\n\nOctober 10-31, 2012, downtown\n\nCat On A Hot Tin Roof (Southern drama)\n\nNov. 1-Nov. 18, 2012, main stage\n\nThe Nutcracker\n\nNov. 24-Dec. 22, 2012, main stage\n\nHaywood Arts Regional Theatre\n\nhttp://www.harttheater.com / 456-6322\n\nFounded in 1985, HART produces a year-round schedule of plays and musicals.

Our summer productions are free, and during our winter production season, we've set aside Thursday performances as ‘pay what we're worth nights.’ See the show, then pay what you think we're worth!” — John Russell, managing director\n\nRomeo and Juliet\n\nOct. 13-Oct. 23\n\nA Christmas Carol (new take on Charles Dickens’ infamous ghost story)\n\nDec 8-Dec 18\n\nTartuffe, by Molière,\n\nApril 12-29\n\nComplete Works of William.

Stage is celebrating its 10th Anniversary season this year with an exciting lineup across mainstage performances, the Catalyst Series and The (For) Play Series.\n\n“For nine seasons, N.C. Stage has consistently created some incredibly memorable theater. People say it's like being a fly on the wall when they come here and that it doesn't feel like they're watching a play, but that they're watching a relationship between the characters unfold before their eyes.” — Charlie Flynn-McIver, artistic director\n\nHedwig and the Angry Inch (glam-rock musical theater)\n\nThrough Sept. 25\n\nBard-a-thon 2011 (48-hour festival of Shakespeare)\n\nSept. 30-Oct. 2\n\nAngels in America, Parts 1 and 2, running in repertory (drama)\n\nOct. 13-Nov. 13\n\nLive From WVL Radio Theatre: It's a Wonderful Life adapted by W.V.R.

Many of them are written for Parkway by area writers and tell stories that directly connect us to our heritage as well as to the current moment. I love the fact that in 2011 we showcased the work of seven N.C. writers. In 2012 we are doing four plays from N.C. area writers, and there are not any other theaters that I know of in a rural area that have this kind of commitment to original work.” — Andrew Gall, producing artistic director\n\nDracula\n\nSept. 30-Oct. 8\n\nBeautiful Star: An Appalachian Nativity (a down-home holiday musical)\n\nDec. 8-10\n\nOutlander\n\nMay 4-12, 2012 (tentative)\n\nElvis Has Left the Building (comedy)\n\nMay 26-June 9, 2012\n\nBig River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (adventure drama)\n\nJune 23-July 7, 2012\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun (musical)\n\nJuly 21-August 4, 2012\n\nRomeo & Juliet\n\nAugust 17-25, 2012\n\nEvery Season (drama)\n\nSept. 8-22, 2012\n\nA Christmas Carol (holiday musical)\n\nDec. 2012\n\nTerpsicorps\n\nterpsicorps.org / 252-6342\n\nSince 2003, Terpsicorps has been bringing in principle dancers from companies around the country for its summer performances. Most other dance companies lay off their dancers in the summertime when theater going tends to taper off. This has given Terpsicorps the opportunity to hire first-rate principal dancers for a short period of time during Asheville’s most vibrant season.\n\n“The dancer playing Edward Gorey [in The Many Deaths of Edward Gorey] creates each vignette and marvels at each character's bizarre death, until he meets his own simple ending surrounded by his favorite characters. There will be additional music composed by the original artists: Nathan Koci, Evan Bivins and Bill Carson, giving choreographer Heather Maloy a chance to create a more in depth look at the scope of his work and allowing audiences more time to immerse themselves in the ‘Gorey’ world she creates.” — Heather Maloy, artistic director\n\nThe Many Deaths of Edward Gorey (narrative driven contemporary ballet)\n\nJune 28-30, 2012\n\nUNC Asheville Theatre\n\ndrama.unca.edu/theatre-unca / 232-2291\n\nThe drama program at UNCA is focusing this season’s production and many of their outreach activities, to “creating stronger community connections” with the campus and with the Asheville area.\n\n“We are partnering with the Asheville Performing Arts Academy, providing the Carol Belk Theatre and technical support for their production of Pippin. Our advanced student directors will also produce six short plays in late November and December, and they are encouraged to consider “found spaces” in our community where their plays would be performed. We also have students participating in internships with Altamont Theatre, N.C.

Oddly enough, doing a season of light rather than dark shows, and popular ones at that, is a bit out of our comfort zone. We're often more comfortable with unique approaches to classics or lesser-known, experimental work, usually on the dark side. So, doing a much-loved and much-seen show like Little Shop and still wowing the audience is a challenge in itself.” — Graham Paul, chair, Department of Theatre\n\nOn the Verge (comedy)\n\nNov. 17-20\n\nThe 39 Steps (farce adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller)\n\nFeb. 9-12\n\nThe Little Shop of Horrors (rock musical)\n\nApril 19-22\n\nWestern Carolina University Theatre\n\nwcu.edu/4853.asp / 227-2479\n\nPlacing a strong emphasis on narrative, the School of Stage and Screen prepares students to work in the art, craft and business of film and theatre by taking an interdisciplinary approach and engaging students in collaboration with musicians, designers and graphic artists.\n\n“Challenges for us will be, No. 1, controlling the blood splatter in Sweeney Todd. As you know there is a lot of throat cutting in the show. No. 2, preventing crashes with the Vespas as they are riding on stage during the Taming of the Shrew. During this modern telling of the story the characters arrive into the city on Vespas instead of horses.” — Thomas Salzman, director, School of Stage and Screen\n\nI Hate Hamlet (dramatic comedy)\n\nOct. 5-8\n\nSweeney Todd (musical thriller)\n\nNov. 10-13\n\nDracula, a Live Radio Drama\n\nJanuary 24, 2012\n\nMusic Is (musical adaptation of Shakespere’s Twelfh Night)\n\nFebruary 4-5, 2012\n\nTaming of the Shrew (modernized telling of Shakespeare’s comedy)\n\nMarch 22 – 25, 2012"
