        "text": "CHARLEY’S AUNT\n\nThe Crescent Theatre, Birmingham, Saturday 29th June 2024\n\nI manage to catch the production’s last in-house performance in the Ron Barber Studio before it embarks on a tour of stately homes around the region. First appearing in 1892, Brandon Thomas’s play is a quintessential old-school farce that basically involves two well-to-do cheps at Oxford recruiting a third to impersonate a visiting aunt in order to secure the affections of their respective young ladies… It’s convoluted and daft but unimportant. The Why is irrelevant compared to the How.\n\nDirector Michael Barry pulls out all the stops to give an evening of fast and frenetic comedy. The pace is unrelenting, and the larger-than-life playing renders the exaggerated accents even funnier.\n\nElliot McDowell sets both pace and tone from the orf as Jack Chesney seeking ways to tell the object of his affections of his affections. McDowell exaggerates to the point of being a cartoon character, or a tightly-wound Bertie Wooster. That is not to say he overacts. No one does. The heightened performance style is maintained by all, with McDowell as the forerunner. He is joined by the eponymous Charley, played by Charles Michael. They’re a couple of posh twits and no mistake. Providing contrast is an excellent Pat Dixon-Dale as Mrs Brassett the servant. Staying shy of out-and-out gor blimey, Dixon-Dale is a delight as the longsuffering help. While the others mangle vowels and say silly things like, “Don’t play the giddy goat!”, she does much with a look or the drop of a silver platter.\n\nLola Hill and Katie Newman are perfectly charming as the young ladies in question, Kitty and Amy. And there is also pleasing character work from Stephen Message as Sir Francis Chesney and Steve Davis as the increasingly frustrated Stephen Spettigue. Jenny Thurston brings elegance and restraint as the genuine Aunt Lucia, with Helena Lima sweet as the ingenue, Miss Delahay.\n\nBut it is the mighty Mark Shaun Walsh in the title role who takes the cake. Perfectly foppish as Lord Fancourt Babberley, he somehow becomes more masculine when he dons his disguise as Donna Lucia. Sweet faced and deep voiced, Walsh makes being hilarious seem effortless. There is something eternally funny to us about someone taking on gender markers and then confounding them. Walsh never caricatures or lampoons his female role, but plays it with truth – as much as the farcical action allows. There is a beautifully played moment when Babberley, still clad in an outfit Whistler’s Mother would baulk at, shows us the emotional toll the deception is having on him. It’s surprisingly touching amid all the running around.\n\nThe silly plot is somehow all neatly resolved. In 1895, Oscar Wilde was to parody (and elevate) this kind of thing with his Importance of Being Earnest. Brandon Thomas may not have Wilde’s epigrammatic wit but his play is effervescent with funny lines nevertheless.\n\nBarry keeps his set to a minimum – a few elegantly white tables and chairs, a piano in a corner – to afford his cast room to manoeuvre. As ever at the Crescent, the costumes are top notch and go a long way to creating a sense of the period. Kudos to Jennet Marshall and her team.\n\nThe production goes to show there is life in the old farce yet, and the heightened playing style will do well at the outdoor venues. As will the inclusion of music hall standards between the acts.\n\nI don’t know whether to be dismayed or chuffed that I know all the words to Joshua and The Old Bull and Bush. Am I really so terribly old?\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nTaking a breather: Mark Shaun Walsh as Lord Fancourt Babberley as Charley’s Aunt\n\n(Photo: Graeme Braidwood)\n\nROMEO & JULIET\n\nThe Duke of York’s Theatre, London, Thursday 27th June 2024\n\nThe best production of this play I’ve ever seen was many years ago. Six actors performing in the grounds of Sudeley Castle, the audience on blankets, snacking from picnic hampers. The only liberties taken with the text were to facilitate the doubling-trebling-quadrupling of roles. There was live music and singing. There were swords and candles and lamps, oh my, and we all laughed at and cried for Mercutio, thrilled at the action, and were moved by the lovers’ inevitable fate. It was Shakespeare, the actors, and us and our wine boxes. It was perfection.\n\nRadical director Jamie Lloyd also presents a stripped-back staging. It’s 1592 in Verona, so says a projected date and a set of big letters as if the Hollywood sign had been made by Spinal Tap’s designers. It seems back then Verona was a dark and empty space, furnished only by microphones on stands. The show begins with Benvolio and Tybalt at two of these mics whispering dialogue to each other. There is no movement, no violence. It’s like two competing ASMR podcasts. The mic stands give the impression that characters are going to launch into some blistering stand-up routine or drop a few Rat Pack numbers. They never do, though.\n\nThe (spider) man most people have come to see, Tom Holland is Romeo in a hoodie. He spends a lot of time sitting at the edge of the stage, down centre, but what is most annoying is, he doesn’t get to give us the full-throated performance of which he is evidently capable. Lloyd has him recite a large proportion of his lines, deadpan and quietly. There’s too much of this from everyone, in fact. Emotional moments are reduced to whispering, as though Verona is a library, a big, dark empty library.\n\nOh, and there are on-stage camera operators, throwing huge close-ups of characters onto a massive screen. My blood runs cold. It was this rotten gimmick that ruined Ivo Van Hove’s Opening Night. And so, at moments when characters should engage with each other, they’re looking at a lens. They may not even be on stage – Actually, this sometimes works well: Capulet’s party is set in the foyer bar, which is a place more opulent than the black box staging. Characters conspire in the theatre corridors, and the action is opened out without the burden of any scenery. But on the whole, it keeps us at a distance. Infuriatingly, when Lloyd lets the actors emote, we are drawn into their plight, only to be shoved away again by the next radical idea.\n\nHolland does OK within these constraints; he’s used to screen acting, after all. There is a scene where Romeo having been banished to Mantua (the theatre roof) receives news of Juliet’s ‘death’ and – well, it’s just embarrassing.\n\nThe violence (the murders of Mercutio and Tybalt) happens in sudden blackout, then it’s lights up and everyone has blood on their shirts and hands. That’s quite startling, but when you have R and J, Friar Lawrence and the Nurse standing in a row behind microphones and never looking at each other, the scene may as well be an audiobook. This facing-out puts the audience in the p.o.v. of the character being addressed, which is great, if the actors are acting. If they’re just reciting, devoid of emotion, it pulls us out of the scene to wait for the next ‘good bit’.\n\nThe casting of Francesca Amewudah-Rivers as Juliet attracted a lot of hoo-hah from racist twats. They remain twats. She is excellent. She and Holland bring youthfulness and the awkwardness of adolescence to their scenes — when they are allowed to interact.\n\nJoshua Alexander Williams’s Mercutio delivers a chilling Queen Mab speech; Daniel Quinn Toye’s Paris, though much reduced, makes a humorous impact; Ray Sesay’s Tybalt has physical presence, despite being denied action; Michael Baldgun’s Friar is both avuncular and authoritative – but why the Apothecary is a disembodied demonic voice escapes me.\n\nBest of the entire lot is Freema Adyeman as the Nurse. Despite all of Lloyd’s radical ideas, Adyeman’s Nurse remains human, a living, breathing, emoting human. Even during the cold reciting, her eyes betray her humanity, while the rest would have trouble identifying photographs with traffic lights in.\n\nMoments of brilliance when the concept actually works, aren’t enough to save this production from being a disappointment. The point of staging Shakespeare is that he still speaks to us over 400 years later. Lloyd seems to be doing all he can to get in Shakespeare’s way. And that’s a shame when this cast is brimming with underused talent.\n\nOh, and I can’t wait for this fad for big screens and cameras has run its course. I want theatrical experiences at the theatre, not half-arsed cinema.\n\n☆ ☆\n\nThey made eye-to-eye contact — but only rarely! Tom Holland and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers\n\nPhoto: Marc Brenner\n\nTWELFTH NIGHT: A Cornish Tale\n\nGatehouse Theatre, Stafford, Tuesday 25th June 2024\n\nI will admit that 1950s Cornwall doesn’t immediately spring to mind when I think of Illyria, but there is where director Sean Turner sets his production of one of Shakespeare’s finest comedies. And I will also admit it is, for the most part, a good fit.\n\nWe begin, not with Orsino’s famous opening line, but with a stylised depiction of the shipwreck that separates twins Viola and Sebastian. It is beautifully done, slow-motion physicality and superb lighting (kudos to lighting designer Barry Smith). It’s a powerful, theatrically impactful moment. The show never quite lives up to this, but it comes close a few times.\n\nMolly Windsor’s Viola lets herself down either by garbling the dialogue (that first scene zips by) or reciting it almost deadpan. Usually, it can take a few minutes for the ear to get accustomed to Shakespeare’s language, whoever’s doing it. Windsor doesn’t give us a chance. She rushes through this expositional scene quite remarkably for a character who only seconds ago was spitting up seawater. Elsewhere, she is a bit one-note. This Viola needs tuning, to give us more light and shade.\n\nNatalie Anderson’s Olivia has no shortage of vim and vigour. She is a flighty young woman, mourning her dead brother in a black cocktail dress (her not him) and is certainly not ‘addicted to melancholy’ as she is later described. Here, then, her show of grieving is precisely that, a show to keep the amorous Orsino at bay, rather than a more genuine depression she casts off in light of her attraction to Cesario (Viola in disguise). Anderson is funny, almost over-the-top, wearing all her emotions on her non-existent sleeves.\n\nStand-up genius Seann Walsh is a surprising spot of casting as Malvolio. It turns out to be quite a coup. Walsh, already having proved himself a decent actor on the small screen, acquits himself excellently well, bringing us the steward’s haughtiness and pomposity, his arrogance, and expresses it through physical comedy. There are undertones of Leslie Phillips and Frankie Howerd in his characterisation – and I mean that as a compliment.\n\nAlso strong are Bob Golding as a fun-loving Sir Toby Belch, partnered with Callum Sim’s nice-but-dim Andrew Aguecheek and his ever-present surfboard. Liz Jadav is superb as the scheming Maria, and Benedict Landsbert-Noon makes a fine impression as Sebastian, the supposedly drowned twin brother. Andre Bullock’s Antonio brings a touch of pathos — especially now in Pride Month, when we realise in the 1950s, homosexuality was still regarded as a crime. Peter Watts is a burly Orsino. Imagine Captain Haddock drawn by Tom of Finland. He’s definitely a man of action, toting anachronistic plastic receptacles around, but his outbursts of finer feelings are as heartfelt as we could wish.\n\nSha Dessi is a gender-swapped Feste the jester, treating us to her fine singing voice at intervals throughout proceedings. She’s a lively figure, with all the impudence and cheek required of the role but I think Alfie Heywood’s costume design could give her something, some detail, that marks her out as the ‘allowed fool’, the entertainer. Dessi’s talent makes her stand out, but a splash of colour or a touch of face paint would help us distinguish her position within this coastal community.\n\nHeywood is also responsible for the remarkable set on which it all plays out. There’s a revolving pub (Olivia’s late father was the landlord), stone walls (are they called groynes? The schoolboy in me thinks they might be) and plenty of fishing nets festooned around. It grounds the drama in its reality, aided by Hattie North’s evocative sound design — the waves are never far away — but what really sets the scene, mood, and tone of this most melancholic comedy is the three-piece folk band, Evolution of Fishermen. This trio entertain before the show, during, and after – you can join them on stage for a jig around, if you’re so inclined.\n\nAll in all, it’s a hugely enjoyable evening of theatre. While some (like me) might quibble with some of the choices, if you look beyond that, you’re in for an entertaining show, with moments that touch (the final reunion of the twins, for example). You might even feel sorry for Malvolio!\n\nThe brilliance of Shakespeare shines through, even though some of his nuance slips through the net.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nStar in garters: Seann Walsh as Malvolio\n\nGLORIOUS!\n\nBear Pit Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Monday 17th June 2024\n\nN.B. I attended a preview performance prior to opening night.\n\nBased on the life of American eccentric, Florence Foster Jenkins, Peter Quilter’s play is never short of amusing, often hilarious and ultimately touching. Director Phil Beeson handles the humour well. The ‘singing’ scenes are especially well done, with as much of the comedy coming from characters’ reactions as from Jenkins’s vocal stylings.\n\nJenkins was an eccentric (we call her that because she was hella rich, and not just your common or garden delusional crackpot) with a joie de vivre born no doubt from her traumatic early life. Angela Minto gives us glimpses of that joy in living, and while she is right to be deadly earnest during her recitals (which have to be heard to be believed) she could do with lightening up during the dialogue. Jenkins was both intentionally and unintentionally funny; Minto needs a more consistent sparkle to bring the woman to life. Smiling more would help.\n\nMark Ewins is a delight as closeted pianist Cosme McMoon, drawn into Jenkins’s world as we are and ending up loving her. His asides, muttered for our benefit, undercut the sweetness-and-light Jenkins engenders. Viv Tomlinson warms into her role as socialite and best friend Dorothy, who has her own delusions about her dressmaking prowess. Paul Tomlinson is the perfect hollow man actor, St Clair Byfield (Jenkins’s life partner) – there is a touch of ambiguity here: does he really love her or is he just a sponge?\n\nAnd there is a striking appearance by Margot McCleary as stick-in-the-mud and killjoy Mrs Verrinder-Gedge, who actually objects to Florence’s efforts to spread her unique brand of joy. She is the lone voice saying the emperor is naked and gets short shrift accordingly. We wonder how much Jenkins realised about her lack of talent and technique. And whether she even cared. Lynn Taylor gives a scene-stealing performance as irascible Mexican maid Maria, a dour foil to Florence’s brio.\n\nBeeson’s NYC set bears enlarged, iconic scenes from around the city (the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, and so on) along with judiciously chosen pieces of furniture that conjure up the time and place. Rebekah Artner and Elizabeth Foster’s wardrobe dresses Jenkins in some outlandish yet twee outfits for her stage appearances.\n\nIt all builds to a performance of Mozart’s Queen of the Night at Carnegie Hall, no less. Here Minto goes at full pelt and it’s, literally, a scream. Beeson should bring her down stage during this climactic moment rather than keeping her static throughout. There is potential throughout for more comic business, like the stumbling over her own dress and the casting of the flowers into the audience, but by and large, this is a splendidly cosy evening at the theatre. You will laugh a lot and the more you learn about this remarkable person, the more you will admire her.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAngela Minto, Mark Ewins, and Viv Tomlinson (Photo: Chris Clarke Photography)\n\nTHE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR\n\nRoyal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, Thursday 13th June 2024\n\nUnusual among Shakespeare’s plays, this comedy does not concern itself with the ruling class. The characters are ‘ordinary’ albeit middle-class figures, by and large, with only the knighted John Falstaff representing the upper echelons – and he is lampooned and ill-treated with aplomb. Is Shakespeare commenting on the rise of the self-made, and the tottering of the ancient regime? Possibly, but probably not.\n\nI prefer to see the play as an antidote to The Taming of the Shrew, a play that always gets the hackles up, with its perceived treatment of women. Here though, it is the women who have the upper hand in all things. The men, for all their scheming, come off second best. But I believe the piece goes beyond tit-for-tat sexual politics.\n\nThere is a rule of comedy that there are two types of people: those who seek to enjoy life and those who seek to prevent them, the latter being ripe for fooling.\n\nBlanche McIntyre’s production is not short on laughs. Along with the physical business she has her cast go through, the performances bring out the humour of one of Shakespeare’s funniest scripts. There are some zingers here, and it’s a shame not all of the performers have the timing or the inflection to capitalise on them. For example, Pistol’s line, “Then did sun on dunghill shine,” is what the kids would call a ‘sick burn’, but Omar Bynon throws it away. Some of the cast are too naturalistic to manage the heightened delivery that comedy requires.\n\nThankfully, the main players are in top form. John Hodgkinson’s Falstaff begins as a blue-suited Tory-like figure, the material straining against the belly born of his indulgences. He is rapidly mocked and besmirched, his suit covered in filth, before his humiliation in disguise as a ‘fat woman’ and roundly beaten and pinched – all because he is driven by his appetites. Hodgkinson achieves god tier by downing two pints of beer in quick succession. This is theatre!\n\nAs the merry wives, Samantha Spiro (Mistress Page) and Siubhan Harrison (Mistress Ford) are tremendous fun, as they plot to humiliate Falstaff at every turn. This is quite the double act; their enjoyment is infectious, and their scenes together are definite highlights. We get a real sense of their friendship.\n\nThe men, on the other hand, are a bunch of idiots. Patrick Walshe McBride is an absolute hoot as the socially inept Slender, using his height to, well, heighten the physical comedy, while delivering the lines with exquisite timing. A joy in every scene he plays. Ian Hughes’s Welsh clergyman is a pompous, language mangling twit, a knicker-nicking vicar. Jason Thorpe’s Doctor Caius is French, in the Inspector Clouseau/’Allo ‘Allo vein, leading to some hilarious linguistic fun. We don’t take Frank Ford’s (Richard Goulding) anguish seriously: we know his rampant jealousy is unfounded, but later, his repentance comes across as sincere. Men can be mended, the play seems to say.\n\nTara Tijani is sweet and lively as Ann Page, the target of unsuitable suitors, while John Leader warms into his role as a rather nerdy Fenton, her chosen one. Shazia Nicholls is splendid as go-between Mistress Quickly and there is strong support from Emily Houghton, sporting a blue Mohawk as the Host of the Garter. Of the lesser roles, Jessica Alade and Tadeo Martinez stand out as servants to Slender and Sir John respectively, with Martinez being especially effective in a largely wordless part.\n\nThe contemporary setting of mock-Tudor detached houses and beer gardens gives the production an old-fashioned sit-com feel. Much of British humour can be traced back to this anomaly among Shakespeare’s comedies. You can easily imagine Terry and June rocking up onto set and fitting right in.\n\nThe action goes beyond a battle of the sexes. Those who seek to curb the enjoyment of others must be mocked and thwarted. And so, even the merry wives, who each prefer a different unsuitable suitor for young Ann, must be foiled and made to see reason.\n\nThere is much to enjoy and to savour in this hilarious production. After a patchy first half, the second half in particular is eye-wateringly, relentlessly funny, with everyone going at full pelt.\n\nThe show presents us with a version of England that has only existed in stage farces and TV sitcoms, where you can make fun of foreigners with impunity, where gender roles are clearly defined and transgressors of these are to be mocked. The diversity of the performers suggests that that kind of world is out-of-date and not to be desired. This version of Windsor is a fantasy land and not a design for life!\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nBelly laughs! Samantha Spiro and John Hodgkinson (Photo: Manuel Harlan)\n\nTHE WIZARD OF OZ\n\nBirmingham Hippodrome, Wednesday 12th June 2024\n\nThe much beloved film version of L Frank Baum’s classic novel has so many elements that have entered the public consciousness, any stage version had better proceed with caution.\n\nThis revamp doesn’t seek to copy the movie, and this proves a wise move. The setting is brought forward from the time of the novel to the time when the film came out: 1930s dustbowl America. We don’t get a black-and-white opening, but what we do get are sweeping aerial shots of the Kansas landscape, projected on the curtain during the overture. Throughout the rest of the show, video projection is used artfully, principally on the cyclorama but also on other scenic elements: the cyclone scene, for example, becomes an all-encompassing cascade of visuals. When the projections work at their best is when they tie in with practical scenery and the actions of the cast.\n\nSo, it’s an extremely effective show in terms of visuals and – I have to say it – in terms of everything else. Production values are higher than Dorothy’s house in the storm.\n\nDorothy herself is brought to life by the remarkable Aviva Tulley. Her version of Over The Rainbow, near the top of the show, is stunning. It’s the best song in the piece and Tulley makes it entirely her own. She brings the house down, you might say…\n\nHeadlining is Craig Revel Horwood as the Wicked Witch of the West, but this is not just a case of stunt casting. Horwood, as the nasty Ms Gulch, quickly establishes himself as a fine character actor. Later, his Witch is a glamorous, camp creation, gravelly voiced (where the film’s version was famously squawky). Horwood keeps to the right side of pantomime villain. Even the odd nods to his celebrity (a ‘Sev-ennn!’ and a ‘Fab-u-lous!’) don’t quite break the fourth wall. He can carry a tune too, and of course, the moves go without saying. A star turn.\n\nThe other name on the poster is JLS’s Aston Merrygold, appearing as the Tin Man. Because the production design is all dystopian Americana, he is more robotic than usual. Cue some excellent moves, although he doesn’t get a real opportunity to show off his vocal talents.\n\nThe structure of the plot means the Tin Man is overshadowed by the Scarecrow – here a saucy, camp cowboy in the form of the beautiful Benjamin Yates. Yates, an excellent song-and-dance man, turns out to be something of a scene-stealer – until the Cowardly Lion shows up, a toweringly larger-than-life performance by Nic Greenshields, more of a cuddly Wookiee than a lion. Yates and Greenshields provide most of the comedy, fast becoming audience favourites (or mine, at least!).\n\nSpecial mention must be made of Abigail Matthews who operates the Toto puppet, rounding out the character in its own right. Magically, Matthews seems to disappear and we only watch the dog.\n\nThere is strong support from Emily Bull as a motorcycle riding Glinda and Aunt Em, David Burrows as Uncle Henry, and Allan Stewart as Professor Marvel and the eponymous Wizard.\n\nThere are additional songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, and while Rice’s lyrics are recognisably clever and Lloyd Webber’s musical phrasings are suitably dramatic, these new numbers can’t match the sheer unadulterated charms of Harold Arlen and E Y Harburg’s original score.\n\nThe well-known story, the much loved characters, and the famous lines of dialogue, are all present and correct in this vibrant production that makes the material seem absolutely fresh.\n\nMagical.\n\nScarecrow, I’ll miss you most of all.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nStraw blimey! Benjamin Yates shows us what he’s made of\n\nPhoto: Marc Brenner\n\nCONSENT\n\nCrescent Theatre, Birmingham, Saturday 8th June 2024\n\nFirst produced at the National Theatre in 2017, Nina Raine’s contemporary drama is still as sharp and as pertinent, but let’s face it, seven years is not long enough for human behaviour to evolve!\n\nWe are presented with a case of rape through the eyes of the barristers who are conducting the trial. Even barristers have home lives, who knew? We meet them during a drinks party. It’s a somewhat airified atmosphere, as these educated, high-achievers, through the medium of urbane wit, show how like everyone else they are with talk about giving birth, moving in, and so on. But then their work enters the chat. Speaking in the first person, they claim they’ve been doing rape all week, or murder, taking the alleged crimes of their clients as their own. It’s darkly funny, and I suppose being a barrister is one of those jobs where you need some kind of gallows humour in order to cope with the horrors you encounter.\n\nThe domestic rows are interspersed with testimony from rape victim Gayle (Katie Merriman) whose treatment at the hands of the legal system is shocking. The accused is protected but the victim’s past is fair game. Merriman is compelling and utterly convincing in her delivery of a harrowing ordeal.\n\nBarrister Tim (Mark Payne) combines professional detachment with personal awkwardness, sparring with the more cynical Ed (Scott Westwood) with whose wife he is suspected of having an affair… Matters come to a head between Ed and Katy (Grace Cheatle) who accuses her husband of behaving like a barrister in their private life. Meanwhile, Jake and Rachel (James David Knapp and Perdita Lawton) go through their own rocky patch when Jake’s infidelities are brought to light.\n\nThe play covers a lot of ground in terms of social commentary and making the point of the political is personal, when the notion of consent is brought into an explosive row between Katy and Ed… It’s also fascinating to hear about the courtroom techniques that barristers use to shape and coerce witness statements. There is also consideration of the common ground shared between actors and barristers when Zara (Steph Urquhart) recruits Tim and Ed to help her research for an audition to play a barrister on the telly.\n\nAcross the board, the acting is excellent. Everyone involved is at the height of their powers and, directed by the assured hand of Andrew Cowie, the material is handled perfectly. The tone in each scene is spot on, with nuanced naturalistic performances making the characters’ most grandstanding moments totally believable. The sparse setting – a bare floor, a set of white chairs – highlights the actors, who sit at the side of the performance space when not in a scene. Somehow, the stylisation accentuates the credibility of the piece. We paint the scene in our imaginations, picturing the furniture just as easily as poor Gayle’s ordeal.\n\nThe subject matter might seem heavy going but there is a rich vein of humour that makes the contentious topic palatable. We are able to think about the issues raised while we are impacted by the intense emotions of the performances.\n\nIt all makes for a perfect, provocative night at the theatre, as yet again the Crescent Theatre delivers the best drama currently available in Birmingham. .\n\nFlawless.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nThe party’s over.

What ensues is a lot of running around, a lot of costume changes and non-stop fun. The script offers plenty of opportunities for ad libs and for topical references (which are razor sharp).\n\nThe whole morass is delivered by just three performers. John-Robert Partridge, Joshua Chandos, and George Ormerod. Partridge, company director and leading man is a dependable talent for drama and for comedy, but he’s never been sillier than he is here. Having handed over the director’s reins to Ash Bayliss and assistant director Andrew Woolley, Partridge is let loose to deliver his daftest performance yet. Chandos makes further progress in cementing his reputation as the funniest actor in Stratford with a range of quickfire characters, augmented by some impressive vocal impersonations: Sean Connery as Macbeth, for example. Ormerod matches the other two in terms of energy and silliness, with some excellent accent work and (spoiler) a moment during a frantic Hamlet that surprises us with its emotional impact and reminds us there is more to these actors than rushing around and dressing up.\n\nIf you know the plays, you’ll probably laugh more than someone who doesn’t, but you don’t have to be a Shakespeare expert to derive a lot of pleasure from the comedy, some of which involves backstage squabbles between the cast members, and there are those topical references I mentioned. Titus Andronicus as a Nigella-style cooking show is a particular highlight, and the reduced version of Macbeth is where the silliness reaches its apogee.\n\nThe comedies all being reduced to one story illustrates the point that they’re all rip-offs of each other, but it’s the weakest part of the show. We are denied, for example, having The Merchant of Venice as a game show or Much Ado as Love Island. All to keep the running time down, of course. Reducing all the histories to a slow-motion rugby match, on the other hand, works brilliantly.\n\nThe second half is almost entirely devoted to Hamlet, with Chandos giving us a ridiculous Olivier-style delivery, Ormerod at his most wild-eyed, and Partridge’s inexplicably Brummie Horatio bringing delight. Audience members are involved, in a satire of the kind of pretentious ‘exploration’ work directors put actors through – so be prepared to wave your arms about and/or repeat lines at the top of your voice, to add to the atmosphere.\n\nThe sheer exuberance of the performers goes a long way to masking the patchiness of the material, guaranteeing that the laughs come thick and fast. The comic business that goes along with Will’s well-worn words is breathtakingly funny, and the overall pacing sweeps us along, making an irresistible, hugely enjoyable event.\n\nWorth seeing for the wigs alone!\n\nAnd the puppets.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nThe puppet show’s the thing!

Presenter Danny Robins emerges from a glitchy video backdrop of a spooky forest, sporting his trademark red anorak. He’s a lively, friendly figure, our guide into the unknown.\n\n“Who believes in ghosts?” he asks for a show of hands early on. I don’t do a head count, but I suspect the self-selecting audience holds a majority of believers.\n\nTwo experts join Robins on stage: psychologist Ciaran O’Keeffe and parapsychologist Evelyn Hollow. The pair offer possible explanations for the weird phenomena experienced by the (on video) witnesses to a couple of hauntings. O’Keefe is the sceptic, suggesting infrasound from a nearby railway station and sleep paralysis. Hollow largely pokes holes in O’Keeffe’s ideas, relating how closely or not the witness accounts align with ‘accepted’ categorisations of, say, poltergeist activity. It’s a game of one-upmanship with O’Keefe conceding ground more often than not.\n\nRobins solicits views and opinions from audience members, bounding up and down the aisles with the energy and haircut of a younger man. It is Robins’s enthusiastic delivery that keeps us hooked. He re-enacts key moments from the witnesses’ stories, making use of a freestanding doorway and a minimal number of props.\n\nDirector Sam Hodges does the utmost to keep us on edge. Unsettling music quietly plays in the background. Wisps of dry ice continually cloud the set: four tall, barren tree trunks bearing the show’s title in rope lights which fizzle on and off to punctuate the action. It’s all extremely effective. Rapid plunges into blackouts enable things to change position and for people to leave the stage.\n\nNaturally, the presentation is skewed towards belief, with just enough seeds of doubt to keep us thinking, keep us questioning. If either side produced irrefutable proof one way or the other, the show would be over, just like if Tom managed to kill Jerry.\n\nHighly entertaining, provocative, and more than slightly disturbing, Uncanny: I Know What I Saw gives rise to more questions than it answers. Perhaps there are no answers. Perhaps some things will never be explained – but because science does not (currently) have an answer, that does not necessarily mean that supernatural forces must be at work.\n\nThat said, even the most entrenched sceptics can thrill at a good ghost story told well, and tonight certainly gives us that. There is even mention of ghostly presences in this very theatre, which sends a shiver down the old spinal column.\n\nChilling – and not in the relaxing sense!\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nTO MOVE IN TIME\n\nThe Door, Birmingham Rep, Thursday 24th May 2024\n\nDelivered by Tyrone Huggins, this monologue by an unnamed protagonist concerns everything he would do to make the world a better place if he had the power to move through time. It’s an interesting premise and one I’m sure we’ve all considered at some point, possibly in a pub after a few jars. If we haven’t, the piece invites us to do so.\n\nAt first, he’d go back and change little things, for example making sure a friend didn’t lose his wallet. Then he considers more life-changing scenarios: saving a child from being crushed by a tram. So far, so altruistic.\n\nThen he considers money-making ideas: going forward to learn the lottery numbers, to see how stocks pan out on the market… Before moving on to the mischief and mayhem he could create…\n\nBut he swiftly realises there’s a knock-on effect, how changing one small detail could impact on the world. The Butterfly Effect, it’s called. And so he realises he’ll have to have several versions of himself from the future, each going back and tweaking and fine-tuning… He ties himself up in knots. Making the world a better place could be a full-time job! And we go giddy trying to keep up with him.\n\nHuggins is effortlessly spellbinding in his oration. Gradually the character emerges: a nobody or indeed an Everyman. His thoughts are ones we all might have in that situation. There is humour, warmth, frustration. The hour passes quickly, Huggins moving us forward to the future!\n\nIt’s a powerful yet playful performance.\n\nThe piece is written and directed by Tim Etchells, and while it perhaps doesn’t offer anything we wouldn’t think of for ourselves in these speculations, surely that is the point. As humans we share a desire to make the world a better place – if not for everyone, then for ourselves at least! And it is from these kind of speculative fantasies that human advancement is born. The piece illustrates how the mind works to create possibilities. Unlike other animals, we can think in the conditional tense, the What-Ifs.\n\nAnd that’s what’s got us where we are today.\n\nFascinating.\n\n☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nTyrone Huggins comes full circle.
