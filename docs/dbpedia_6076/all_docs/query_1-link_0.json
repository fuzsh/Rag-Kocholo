It was made by the state-owned DEFA studio on a large budget.[1]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was highly successful by East German standards,[2] and drew 6,090,329 viewers to the cinemas.[3] Ernst Richter noted that while \"the socially critical tone was unmistakably present in the film\", it was free of \"heavy-handed communist propaganda.\"[4] Heinz Kersten characterized it as one of the last apolitical entertainment pictures produced by DEFA before the Socialist Unity Party of Germany tightened its control on the national film industry.[5] Albert Wilkening wrote it was \"a significant step forward in making movies in the GDR... Wildhagen's directing was quite skillful.\"[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nSabine Hake, John Davidson (editors). Framing the Fifties: Cinema in a Divided Germany.
