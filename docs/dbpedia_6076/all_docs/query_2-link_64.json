        "text": "By Lynn Venhaus\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, we’re back with our round-up of people, places, and events in the St. Louis region, a tad behind in posting our September/summer swan song.\n\nIN COMES COMPANY: Stephen Sondheim’s groundbreaking musical “Company” – the female-led revival that won the Tony in 2022, kicks off its 25-city national tour on Oct. 8 in Schenectady, N.Y., with the St. Louis stop Feb. 27-March 10 at the Fox Theatre.\n\nBelleville native Ann Beyersdorfer, associate set designer for the Broadway revival, worked with production designer Bunny Christie, who won her fourth Olivier Award for the London production design. And she’s on the team that has been preparing the hilarious and sophisticated show for the road.\n\n(Three-time Tony Award winner Jack Lane, co-founder and executive producer emeritus of Stages St. Louis, was one of the Broadway show’s co-producers.)\n\nAnn was back in town this summer, as scenic designer for “Disney’s Beauty and the Beast” and “West Side Story” at The Muny, and I was fortunate to interview her then for the Belleville News-Democrat.\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/belleville-native-designs-sets-broadway-120000176.html\n\nFor a deeper dive into the mechanics of getting a Broadway show transferred to the road, read about her journey here on PopLifeSTL.com:\n\nA winner of best set design of a play for “Afterglow” at the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards, she’ll be part of the team taking the production to London Oct. 17–Nov. 24, with an official opening Oct. 22.\n\nAnd as an art director on the visual shorts for “Saturday Night Live,” hopefully you will be able to see more of her work when the show resumes on Oct. 14. You may have seen the elaborate “HBO Mario Kart Trailer” she worked on when Emmy-nominated Pedro Pascal hosted.\n\nCheers to Ann and the tour launch! (We’ll drink to that!). For more information, visit: https://companymusical.com/\n\nBRAND NEW DAY: “The Wiz,” the 1974 super-soul musical adaptation of L. Frank Baum’s beloved children’s novel “The Wizard of Oz,” which was given a reworking for The Muny’s 2018 season, is Broadway-bound in 2024, with St. Louis-connected producers, but this new revival is touring first. Opening night was Sept. 23 at the Hippodrome Theatre in Baltimore, and the reviews were raves.\n\n“The audience and the whole evening was full of joy and energy, extended applause, and standing ovations,” stated the Maryland Theatre Guide on Sept. 29. “Powerhouse performances and stunning choreography,” enthused the Baltimore Sun.\n\nThe first-ever revival will be easing down the road to 12 other cities, including Chicago (Nov. 28 – Dec. 10). For more information, visit: https://wizmusical.com/\n\nThe producing team of Kristin Caskey and Mike Isaacson (Muny artistic director and executive producer) and a long list of others, including Terry Schnuck, is behind this show. Caskey, now of the Ambassador Theatre Group, spent 20 years with Fox Theatricals. She and Isaacson produced the Tony-winning “Fun Home” in 2015 and this year’s Best Revival winner “Parade.”\n\nIsaacson said they have been working on a revival for eight years, and plans are to mount another national tour after the Broadway limited engagement. In preparation for The Muny, he received permission from the original creators to make some changes. Amber Ruffin, recent Tony nominee for “Some Like It Hot,” wrote additional material – and had worked on the Muny script – from William F. Brown’s original book. You may know her as a writer on “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” as she frequently appears.\n\nIsaacson revealed that in a terrific Broadway World interview with James Lindhorst, who also talked with producers Jack Lane, Mike Bosner and Terry Schnuck – heavy-hitters at this year’s Tonys (“& Juliet,” “Shucked” and “Parade”).\n\nhttps://www.broadwayworld.com/st-louis/article/Interview-St-Louis-Area-Producers-Mike-Bosner-Mike-Isaacson-Jack-Lane-and-Terry-Schnuck-Nominated-for-Tony-Awards-20230512\n\nSchele Williams is helming this show, with Wayne Brady as The Wiz from Jan. 16 to Broadway engagement, and Alan Mingo Jr. in the title role Sept. 23 – Jan. 14, 2024, and newcomer Nichelle Lewis as Dorothy.\n\nThe original 1974 production, directed by Geoffrey Holder and choreographed by George Faison, won seven Tony Awards including Best Musical, and was adapted into a movie in 1978 starring Diana Ross, Richard Pryor, and Michael Jackson. NBC broadcast a live version in 2015, but a planned revival then did not materialize.\n\nBRUSH WITH GREATNESS: Speaking of the musical “Fun Home,” composer Jeanine Tesori — the most honored and most prolific female theatrical composer in history, was in St. Louis this summer, and stopped in to visit with the local cast rehearing “Caroline, or Change,” produced by Fly North Theatricals.\n\nTo get the opportunity to talk with Tesori, who has written five Broadway musicals and received six Tony Award nominations, winning for “Fun Home” and the recent “Kimberly Akimbo,” was one of the best moments ever, according to music director Colin Healy.\n\nHealy summed it up this way on Facebook: “She and Mike Isaacson (producer) offered such wonderful insight into the process of writing, building, and producing ‘Caroline, Or Change,’ validating what is already apparent when hearing the score: how much a labor of love and Herculean creative endeavor ‘Caroline’ was and continues to be… She spoke to us for over an hour and took questions from everyone.”\n\n(Photo: Colin Healy and Jeanine Tesori)\n\nNEW HORIZONS: All good wishes for theater and media folks moving on, changing directions and making the most of opportunities.\n\nBravo to Taylor Gruenloh, whose new musical “Cascade’s Fire,” a modern Antigone story co-written by Kyle Wernkel, will premiere Oct. 12 and run 13-15 and 19-21 in the Black Box Theatre at Missouri Science and Technology in Rolla, where he is on the Arts, Languages and Philosophy faculty. Taylor wrote the book and lyrics while Wernkel wrote the music.\n\nTaylor recently stepped down as Creative Director at The Tesseract Theatre Company at the end of August, after their successful run of “Kinky Boots.” One of the most prolific and creative folks in town, I can’t wait to see what else he will accomplish.\n\nCongratulations to Joe Gfaller, who has been managing director of Metro Theater Company since 2019, on becoming managing director of Clear Space Theatre Company, a 20-year-old regional theater in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He’ll be leaving in mid-October. Jessie Youngblood, the current development director, will serve as interim managing director beginning Oct. 9. Always enjoyed working with Joe, starting with the Opera Theater of St. Louis in 2014. Joe has served Metro, St. Louis’s premiere professional theater for youth and families, well.\n\nBest wishes to Julia Flood, Metro artistic director for the past 10 years, who has announced her retirement after the 51st season. Of Joe’s departure, she said: “Joe has had boundless energy and enthusiasm for the mission and work of Metro Theater Company. I feel lucky to have had the benefit of his partnership through the complexities of the pandemic times and wish him much success and happiness in his new venture.” (They both can be very proud of their endeavors).\n\nA free Fall Family Festival to celebrate MTC’s 50 years of service to the community will be held on Oct. 21 and 22. A toast in Gfaller’s honor will be held at that event on Sunday, Oct. 22 at 1 p.m.\n\nCarol Daniel may have retired from one prominent longtime gig, but she is embarking on a fantastic journey. The award-winning St. Louis journalist, reporter, host, columnist, and author has joined Nine PBS as a Senior Producer and Host.\n\nDaniel said she looks forward to telling the stories of her community in a new way — with a podcast about people making an impact here, and also produce interviews and stories that celebrate and showcase underrepresented voices for Nine PBS’s content flagship, Living St. Louis. Yes to this! I look forward to seeing her next chapter.\n\nDaniel has more than 40 years of experience as a host on KMOX Radio, as well as work on Great Day St. Louis on KMOV/Channel 4, and a columnist for the St. Louis American. She’s been honored as a Living Legend by the National Association of Black Journalists–St. Louis, was recently inducted into the Lincoln University Alumni Hall of Fame, and was a 2022 inductee into the St. Louis Media Hall of Fame.\n\nLongtime public relations and marketing maestros Eric Pugh and Dylan Stanley have departed our fair river city for beachier pastures. Last at the Muny, Eric is now promoting The Asolo Repertory Theatre in Sarasota, Fla., the largest Equity theatre in Florida, and the largest Repertory theatre in Southeastern U.S. Just wonderful to work with both, and I’m glad we had time together.\n\nDylan, who has moved to Los Angeles with his fiancé, Nicolas Valdez, who is embarking on a fellowship at USC, will keep us posted on his next challenge after giving us his all at Stifel Theatre and Enterprise Center (and performing in Tesseract Theatre Company’s triumphant “Kinky Boots.”\n\nBest wishes to Lee Anne Mathews in her new role as Education and Artistic Director for the Fox Performing Arts Charitable Foundation! Before May, she was making things happen at Westport Playhouse.\n\nCongratulations to Brian McKinley on his new role as Director of Education and Community Program at the Black Repertory Theatre of St. Louis.\n\nHOMETOWNERS: Comedian-actor Cedric the Entertainer’s new book, crime caper “Flipping Boxcars,” fictionalizes his grandfather, Floyd “Babe” Boyce.\n\nJon Hamm is in two, not one, television series this fall. He joined the cast of “The Morning Show” for season 3, now streaming on Apple TV+, and will be in “Fargo,” season 5, which starts Nov. 21 on FX and Hulu.\n\nBest wishes to Nicholas “Sifu” Alsup of O’Fallon, Ill., who was chosen as one of 18 contestants on the 45th season of CBS’ “Survivor” that started Sept. 27.He is a larger-than-life personality, and I was able to interview him through permission with CBS. https://news.yahoo.com/o-fallon-gym-owner-one-120000863.html\n\nCHEERS: Congratulations to New Jewish Theatre on their 25th anniversary as a regional professional theatre in St. Louis; and Gateway Center for Performing Arts school, and youth theater company, on their 10th anniversary in Webster Groves. A feature article by me will be in the Webster-Kirkwood Times soon.\n\nOUT AND ABOUT: Two Colins in the ‘Lou news!\n\nCo-owners Colin Healy and Bradley Rohlf of Fly North Theatricals, have opened their new home and social hangout, The Greenfinch Theater and Dive, at 2525 South Jefferson Avenue (the old Way Out Club).. The bar is open every night from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. You won’t want to miss Stool Pigeon Open Mic Comedy Night on Mondays and Drunk Voice Lessons karaoke with live piano accompaniment (and critiques) by Colin Healy on Wednesdays, plus Burlesque Bingo’s in the rotation too. They are also accepting reservations for their black box theater.\n\nSNL Head Writer Colin Jost was the Celebrity Guest Host at the Foundation for Barnes-Jewish Hospital’s Illumination Gala on June 3 at The Ritz-Carlton, a major fundraising event for the Siteman Cancer Center. Not sure what he said about “The Square Beyond Compare” but Imo’s posted his photo.\n\nSince 2007, the event has raised more than $42 million to support research funds\n\nMEMORY LANE: Last month in pop culture history.\n\nSept. 26, 1975: “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” opened in Westwood, Calif., and tanked at the box office, but later would become the definition of a cult classic, inspiring interactive screenings with toast, toilet paper and more.\n\nIf you attended midnight screenings in the late ‘70s at the Varsity Theatre in St. Louis (where Vintage Vinyl is now), you might have run in to a teenage Michael Stipe, future alt-rock band REM frontman, who is dressed as Frank-n-Furter here in this vintage newsclip on KSDK’s “Newsbeat.” He told the reporter: “We’re all normal, really.”\n\nWhy on earth was Stipe, now 63, in St. Louis then? His dad was in the Army, and they moved to several states during his childhood. In the late ‘70s, he lived in Collinsville, Ill., and attended high school there and went on to Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville.. Later, he would move to Athens, Ga., for college, and met record store clerk Peter Buck, which led to forming a band with Mike Mills and Bill Berry…and the rest is history..\n\nRocky Horror played midnights at the Varsity Theatre from April 1976 until Jan. 3, 1988 when it closed for good. It was one of the first 30 theatres in the U.S. to do so.\n\nI was fortunate to interview Barry Bostwick (Brad in the movie) when he had been scheduled to appear at Wizard World in St. Louis, but had to cancel, and he graciously talked about making the movie by phone. True delight to talk with and write about — here’s my BND feature from 2017.\n\nhttps://www.bnd.com/entertainment/article142667129.html\n\nIN MEMORIAM: Frequent visitor to Gaslight Square with the infamous Compass players, RIP Alan Arkin (March 26, 1934 – June 29, 2023). Archival photo is at Crystal Palace with Anne Meara.\n\nFrom William Roth, the founder and artistic director of St. Louis Actors’ Studio, who renovated The Gaslight Theatre in the Central West End, on Arkin:\n\n“He made his off-Broadway debut in the late 1950s and joined the St Louis improvisational group the Compass Players in 1959. This led to a stint with the Chicago improv troupe Second City and his Broadway debut, in 1961, in the company’s show ‘From the Second City, which he co-wrote.’\n\nTony-winning actor Michael McGrath, whose last show was at the Muny this summer – he did a fine job as Mr. Mushnik in “Little Shop of Horrors,” passed away in his sleep Sept. 14 at his home in Bloomfield, N.J. He was 65. That wasn’t his first show in St. Louis – in 1990, he played John Adams in Theater Factory’s “1776.” He was first nominated for a Tony in “Spamalot,” and won for “Nice Work If You Can Get It,” playing a bootlegger, in 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/theater/michael-mcgrath-dead.html\n\nMaggie Ryan, founder of Insight Theatre and inspiration to many, who spent 36 years as an English teacher and director of theater at Nerinx Hall, died Sept. 10, at age 80, after a short battle with leukemia. She was a lovely woman to interact with and cared passionately about theater. Insight operated for 12 years, won several St. Louis Theater Circle Awards including a legendary “Death of a Salesman” directed by Wayne Loui and starring father-son duo John and Jason Contini. Unfortunately, Insight closed in 2020.\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/stltoday/name/margaret-ryan-obituary?id=53065958\n\nCalvin Wilson, St. Louis Post-Dispatch movie and theater critic, died Aug. 29, from an undisclosed illness. He was 70. I worked with Calvin, both in the St. Louis Film Critics Association, and with the St. Louis Theater Circle, and much admired his writing skill. His insight and passion for the arts will be missed.\n\nhttps://www.stltoday.com/life-entertainment/local/art-theater/post-dispatch-writer-calvin-wilson-a-passionate-advocate-for-the-arts-dies-at-70/article_8fc9b7bc-46b5-11ee-a3a5-0bdd24dc5828.html\n\nCALENDAR NOTES: John Cusack’s screening of “Say Anything,” originally scheduled for October 28 at Stifel Theatre, has been rescheduled for Saturday, March 30. All tickets for the Oct. 28 performance will be honored at the rescheduled date. The popular actor will follow the screening with a conversation regarding his career and the making of the film. Fans will get the opportunity to experience a moderated discussion, with John answering audience questions as well.\n\nSHAMELESS NAME-DROPPING: Before she had the biggest movie of the summer (“Barbie”!) and her second son in February, Greta Gerwig was pleasantly accommodating us press troops at the New York Film Festival 2022 (for “White Noise”). The accomplished actress-writer-director is exactly as she seems, a lovely person in person. I had to compliment her on the 2019 “Little Women,” and she said she had a great time working with the cast of that movie. Hopefully, we will be seeing her during the upcoming awards season. On Aug. 6, the film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide, making her the first woman with sole director credit to have a movie make more than $1 billion.\n\n(My film review: https://poplifestl.com/unexpected-unpredictable-barbie-is-an-irresistible-pop-o-culture/)\n\nOur coda has been added for this issue:\n\nRANDOM THOUGHTS: As you can probably tell, I enjoy waltzing down memory lane, and yes, I was one of the early attendees of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” midnight showings at the Varsity Theatre in 1977, which was so much fun. If you are a lover of cosplay, I have spied folks in Barbie and Ken outfits at “Barbie” — my prediction for hottest Halloween costumes — and I hear from Abe Goldfarb, hilarious as Otho in the touring company of “Beetlejuice,” who was on the weekly PopLifeSTL.com podcast co-hosted by Carl “The Intern” Middleman and myself on Oct. 4, that there’s many folks dressing up at the shows. He’s excited that they’re here Oct. 13.\n\nThe St. Louis Blues open at home Oct. 12. Just once I’d like to buy a team T-shirt where the player I selected isn’t traded. (I bought an Alexander Pietrangelo one — with a C — before the playoffs in ’19 and a Ryan O’Reilly in 2022.)\n\nAre we having the Daylight Savings Time ‘fall back’ happen this year or is it over? Anyone? I’m so confused.\n\nWhere in the world is Lynn this weekend? Judging the costume contest at the sensational annual Witches and Wizards Festival in O’Fallon, Ill., a really fun event\n\nLynn (Zipfel) Venhaus has had a continuous byline in St. Louis metro region publications since 1978. She writes features and news for Belleville News-Democrat and contributes to St. Louis magazine and other publications.\n\nShe is a Rotten Tomatoes-approved film critic, currently reviews films for Webster-Kirkwood Times and KTRS Radio, covers entertainment for PopLifeSTL.com and co-hosts podcast PopLifeSTL.com…Presents.\n\nShe is a member of Critics Choice Association, where she serves on the women’s and marketing committees; Alliance of Women Film Journalists; and on the board of the St. Louis Film Critics Association. She is a founding and board member of the St. Louis Theater Circle.\n\nShe is retired from teaching journalism/media as an adjunct college instructor.\n\nBy Lynn Venhaus\n\nWith its big heart and lofty ambitions, Tesseract Theatre Company has performed its first big splashy musical in St. Louis, and “Kinky Boots” is a chef’s kiss of a show, a celebration of possibilities and a tour-de-force performance by Tielere Cheatem as Simon/Lola.\n\nCheatem, a standout local performer and St. Louis Theater Circle Award winner, as housekeeper Jacob in New Line Theatre’s “La Cage Aux Folles” in 2019, has always had a ‘je ne sais quoi’ quality on stage, but as Lola, they are magnificent.\n\nCheatem makes the role that won Billy Porter a Tony Award their own and seizes that stage in authentic diva mode, with a ferocity and a passion that is remarkable to behold. It’s a fully realized, multi-layered performance.\n\nOvercoming obstacles is the ebullient show’s theme, along with acceptance and tolerance, so it is understandable that moving to a larger space than they are used to, The Grandel Theatre, would present its own challenges. Opening night Aug. 17 was marred by sound problems, but Gruenloh said they have worked to solve those issues.\n\nTesseract’s previous small-scale musicals, “Ordinary Days” in November 2022 and “The Last Five Years” in February 2023, were performed at the .Zack Theatre. Tesseract’s “Kinky Boots” is also the second regional production after the Muny’s premiere in 2019.\n\nCheatem has a sweet chemistry with co-lead Kelvin Urday as Charlie Price, who inherited a failing shoe factory from his dad. They are a palpable pairing, and when they duet to “Not My Father’s Son,” their harmony tugs at the heartstrings.\n\nIn fact, the ballads about parental expectations and other relationships are memorable – Lola’s tearful “Hold Me in Your Heart” and Charlie’s “Soul of a Man.”\n\nUrday displays confidence in his characterization of Charlie, who reluctantly took over the fourth-generation family business, Price & Son, which is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the weight of his father’s legacy leads him to much soul-searching. His earnest delivery of his “Step One” solo is also noteworthy.\n\nInspired by the life force that is the eccentric Lola, whose drag attire includes unsteady stilettos, the factory begins a niche business model, and those glittery sturdy “kinky boots” are made well to meet the needs of flamboyant performers-in-drag.\n\nThe musical “Kinky Boots” is based on a 2005 British film starring Chiwetel Ejiofor as Simon/Lola and Joel Edgerton as Charlie, which was based on a true story and a BBC documentary, and premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, catching the eye of some Broadway producers.\n\nThus began its journey to the stage. It premiered on Broadway in 2013, the adaptation by four-time Tony winner Harvey Fierstein and music and lyrics by first-timer Cyndi Lauper, the Grammy-winning pop icon, who won a Tony for the score, which is an infectious mix of club music and heartfelt ballads. The musical won six Tonys, including best musical, from a season-high 13 nominations.\n\nIt also won London’s Olivier Award for Best Musical and the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theatre album. It ran for six years and 1,400 performances until April 7, 2019.\n\nThe Tesseract ensemble includes some seasoned veterans, like versatile Marshall Jennings as the intimidating and homophobic foreman Don, dynamic Carrie Wenos as sassy line worker Trish, Loren Goudreau in her local debut as amiable worker Pat, who are all seamless. Kent Coffel, ‘an iron man’ in local theater this summer, is a good fit as Charlie’s proud hard-working dad and briefly seen as manager George.\n\nKaitlin Gant announces her presence as factory worker Lauren who fancies Charlie. Her standout number is the humorous “The History of Wrong Guys.”\n\nStrong singer Chelsie Johnston, recently seen in “Nine” at New Line, has the thankless role as Charlie’s posh girlfriend Nicola, who is a status conscious social climber and meant to not be likable.\n\nAnd there are some new-to-St. Louis performers, so to feel their joy is inspiring. They look like they are so happy to be on that stage, relatable in that ‘work family’ way, and emphasizing the message “You can change the world if you change your mind.”\n\nLindsey Grojean, Sarah Lueken, David Pisoni, Tori Ray, Corinna Redford, Michelle Sauer, Josie Schnelten and Aaron Tucker Jr. are a merry bunch as the factory ensemble. Tucker is stellar giving advice as Charlie’s childhood pal in a spirited “Take What You Got” and Redford is hilarious as the stage manager in Milan.\n\nSplendid are The Angels – Lola’s six drag queen back-up singers at the seedy nightclub where they perform a cabaret act, notable with their in-your-face bravado. The always outstanding Mike Hodges and Jordan Woods, also local choreographers, as well as the ever-radiant Dylan Stanley, with their effervescent energy are matched by flashy newbies Todd Garten, Ronnie Wingbermuehle, and Nick Zobrist. They sparkle in “Land of Lola” and “Sex is in the Heel.”\n\nAsher Woodward and Mark Ambrose Hill are impressive as the young Charlie and Lola respectively.\n\nThe cast brings the fun out in the cheery Act 1 finale “Everybody Say Yeah,” and is ecstatic in the up-on-your-feet anthem closer “Raise You Up/Just Be,” which is a marvelous way to spread hope in a universal message.\n\nTaylor Gruenloh, who directed this musical first at the Missouri University Science & Technology in the spring, where he is an assistant professor in theatre, has honored the uplifting nature of the book, focusing on humanity – and made the humor zing. He knows how to get laughs, too, and deftly works in physical comedy.\n\nHe also ensured that the British accents were spot on – hurray!\n\nHe shares the same affection for the material as celebrated music director Nicolas Valdez and experienced choreographer Maggie Nold, with Michelle Sauer the dance captain.\n\nHowever, Valdez is not conducting a 12-piece orchestra but using recorded tracks from the publisher Music Theatre International that includes orchestrations and arrangements by Stephen Oremus for the performances. Charlie Heil was a music supervisor.\n\nZachary Phelps’ costume designs are stunning, and to learn that he’s a 19-year-old college student makes it even more astonishing. He also was the makeup assistant. The well-fitted wigs were designed by Sarah Gene Dowling and the wig supervisor was Analyse Thropic.\n\nTechnical director Kevin Salwasser and sound designer/supervisor Phillip Evans had to master the issues at the Grandel, as did lighting designer Max Demski.\n\nScenic designer Taylor Gruenloh created a believable and modest set, with a working conveyor belt, and was able to keep the action flowing. He also kept the focus on the performers.\n\nOn one level, it’s a feel-good dance party. Yet, Tesseract’s production is another exclamation point on the need for inclusion and individuality. And that is “The Most Beautiful Thing in the World.”\n\nYou may fall head-over-high-heels with this cast and crew, and you could be singing “Raise You Up” at the jubilant curtain call, which should empower everyone to “Feed your fire,” and perhaps like me, leave dancing in the aisles.\n\nTesseract Theatre Company presents “Kinky Boots” Thursday through Saturday, Aug. 17-27, at 7:30 p.m., with Sunday matinees at 2 p.m., at the Grandel Theatre, 3610 Grandel Square, St. Louis.

That was definitely the vibe at Power Hall on October 2 when these two local cultural titans combined talents for “A Little Sondheim Music,” a concert to celebrate composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim, a titan of different sort. The last time the Symphony and Muny combined forces was to celebrate the The Muny’s 100th birthday.\n\nWith Mike Isaacson, the Muny’s Artistic Director and Executive Producer, at the helm as host and master of ceremony, the lively event perked along through a well-curated roster of songs from Sondheim’s career. This was no jukebox jaunt through Sondheim’s songbook. It was a journey into Sondheim’s impressive range of songs and characters, some of which aren’t among his greatest hits.\n\nSo, along with the familiar titles from “Follies,” “A Little Night Music,” “Company” and “Sweeney Todd,” the audience was also to treated to selections from the lesser-known “Saturday Night,” “Evening Primrose” and “Anyone Can Whistle.” Another entire concert or two could be created from Sondheim’s deep cuts from other shows. To borrow a line from “Send In the Clowns, “…well, maybe next year.” (hint, hint).\n\nIn his opening, Isaacson quoted the three guiding principles that Sondheim hewed to during his career: content dictates form, less is more and God is in the details. To which Sondheim also added, “All in service of Clarity, without which nothing else matters.”\n\nClarity ruled the afternoon performance and elevated the achievements of Sondheim rather than mourn his passing last November at age 91. Lending their vocal talents to the celebration were some of Broadway’s brightest babies: Ben Davis, Bryonha Marie, Matthew Scott, Emily Skinner and Elizabeth Stanley. Their talents were on full display, whether performing individually, in duets or as an ensemble. And it would be unfair if not impossible to cite any one performance as a standout because they were all standouts.\n\nAsk 10 audience members what their favorite was, and you’d probably get 10 different answers. My own personal favorite was Skinner’s interpretation of “Send In the Clowns.” Her use of pauses and emphasis provided new insight into the lyrics’ meanings and to the rueful ruminations of the character Desirée in “A Little Night Music.” I’m just a sucker for that song.\n\nClarity was certainly one of the concert’s throughlines. Songs such as ”If You Can Find Me, I’m Here,” sung by Scott, and “Broadway Baby,” sung by Marie, exemplify Sondheim’s ability to pack an entire show’s worth of characterization into a single lyric. And Scott interpreted his song by channeling an inner Dustin Hoffman, ala “The Graduate,” and Marie delivered sass, sashay and plenty of boop-oop-a-doop to hers.\n\nEach Sondheim song is its own mini-musical. All of the performers tapped into this with brio and moxie, moving across the narrow strip of stag and conjuring the spirit of the actual musicals. Even if you didn’t know the show, you understood it from the song itself. That’s part Sondheim genius, part musical magic and part high-caliber performance from the artists.\n\nCases in point: Davis, fresh off this last summer’s successful Muny production of “Sweeney Todd,” reprised his take on the chilling “My Friends” by pivoting from fetishistic heavy petting of cutlery to the abrupt declaration, “At last, my arm is complete again!” Dexter should be so lucky.\n\nAnd Stanley provided a disarmingly plaintive interpretation of “In Buddy’s Eyes” from “Follies” that reworked the breathless suffering usually associated with this song – written for an older character – into an ironic conscience examination of someone younger.\n\nAlso providing clarity to the concert was the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Maestro Ben Whiteley, who has long been a member of the Muny artistic family. Host Isaacson thanked Whiteley “…who really created this program, bringing his incredible knowledge and passion to the creation of this program.”\n\nThe orchestra launched the performance with the opening overture to “Merrily We Roll Along” and was featured post-intermission with the overture to “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” as well as a smooth and graceful “Night Waltz” from “A Little Night Music” in the second half. These were a potent reminder of the beauty of Sondheim’s compositions and how much a fine performance of them deepens their impact.\n\nAlso in the second half was a special appearance by St. Louis native Ken Page who sang “Anyone Can Whistle” with a sage-like preciousness that did the Old Deuteronomy cat proud.\n\nAs the concert drew to a close, Isaacson quoted Sondheim who answered an interviewer’s question about what he hoped his legacy would be. “Oh, I just would like the shows to keep getting done. Whether on Broadway, or in regional theaters, or schools or communities, I would just like the stuff to be done. Just done and done and done and done and done.”\n\nWith a concert like “A Little Sondheim Music,” The Muny and the Symphony have ensured that at least one of those done’s was accomplished – and done to perfection. It doesn’t get much clearer than that.\n\nFeatured Photo: Ben Whiteley, Michael Baxter, Nicolas Valdez, Bryonha Marie, Ben Davis, Matthew Scott, Emily Skinner..

It is the regional premiere of the wild, sexy, modern musical fairy tale where Once Upon a Time is now.\n\n“Head Over Heels” is the bold new musical comedy from the visionaries that rocked Broadway with Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Avenue Q and Spring Awakening.\n\nConceived by Jeff Whitty, with an original book by Whitty, adapted by James Magruder, originally directed by Michael Mayer, and set to the music of the iconic 1980s all-girl rock band The Go-Go’s, this high-octane, laugh-out-loud love story includes hit songs like, “We Got the Beat,” “Our Lips Are Sealed,” “Vacation,” “Heaven is a Place on Earth” and “Mad About You.”\n\nThe wild story follows the escapades of a royal family who set out on a journey to save their beloved kingdom from extinction, only to discover the key to their realm’s survival lies within each of their own hearts — though not always in the way they expect — and in their willingness to let go of rigid tradition and change with the times.\n\nWith band and vocal arrangements by Broadway composer Tom Kitt (Next to Normal, If/Then, High Fidelity), and eleven amazing dance numbers, choreographed by New Liners Michelle Sauer and Sara Rae Womack, this is the heaviest dance show New Line has produced since Chicago in 2002.\n\nHead Over Heels originally premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2015, then opened on Broadway in 2018. The show was nominated for Best Musical by the Drama League and the Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n\nThe New Line cast includes Grace Langford (Princess Pamela), Melissa Felps (Princess Philoclea), Clayton Humburg (Musidorus), Jaclyn Amber (Mopsa), Zachary Allen Farmer (King Basilius), Carrie Priesmeyer (Queen Gynecia), Aaron Allen (Dametas), Tiélere Cheatem (Pythio), Kevin Corpuz, Evan Fornachon, Chris Kernan, Chris Moore, Maggie Nold, Michelle Sauer, Alyssa Wolf, and Sara Rae Womack.\n\nThe New Line production will be directed by Scott Miller and Mike Dowdy-Windsor, with music direction by Nicolas Valdez, choreography by Michelle Sauer and Sara Rae Womack, scenic design by Rob Lippert, costume design by Sarah Porter, lighting design by Kenneth Zinkl, and sound design by Ryan Day.\n\nThe Daily Beast said, “Head Over Heels is a raucously choreographed joy — intelligent, winningly comic, and surprisingly-for-Broadway radical when it comes to its presentation of gender and sexuality.” Entertainment Weekly said, “The show is an ode to female independence with the winking spirit of a Shakespearean fairy and the neon edge of a rebellious ‘80s teenager, teaming up to beckon people into the woods. Forty years after The Go-Go’s’ formation, Head Over Heels does more than preserve the band’s iconic hits in amber. For two hours and 15 minutes, it’s enough to pull the world back into sync.”\n\nTimeOut NY said, “It grafts a 2010s sensibility onto songs from the 1980s — by the all-girl pop-punk quintet the Go-Go’s (plus two hits from lead singer Belinda Carlisle’s solo career) — and fits them into a 16th-century story that is set in ancient Greece. . . Head Over Heels is a fantasy and celebration of nonconformity, and it puts its casting where its mouth is with an ensemble that is diverse in race, gender and size. Honoring the beat, in this merry Arcadia, means making room for different drummers.”\n\nHead Over Heels contains adult content. Produced by arrangement with Broadway Licensing, New York.\n\nTickets\n\nHEAD OVER HEELS runs March 5-28, 2020, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, all at 8:00 p.m., at the Marcelle Theater, 3310 Samuel Shepard Drive, three blocks east of Grand, in the Grand Center Arts District.

My generation of Baby\n\nBoomers had “Hair,” Gen X had “Rent,” Millennials had “Spring Awakening” and\n\nnow Generation Z has the current cultural sensation “Be More Chill.” It’s\n\nfierce, fun and frisky.\n\nThis is not just another teen misfit story, although it taps into familiar themes, bearing some resemblance to “Mean Girls,” Dear Evan Hansen” and “Heathers.”\n\nWith more dimensions than stock characters, the kids work\n\nthrough messy life things – and as an adult, you just want to tell them “It\n\ngets better,” but then we’d have no story conflicts, would we? It’s set in\n\nsuburban New Jersey and the time is now.\n\nIs it ever. You’ll identify right away, as the dialogue is\n\na contemporary bulls-eye.\n\nBesides being incredibly clever, another aspect that sets this realistic cautionary\n\ntale apart is its sci-fi framework. To understand just what a big-bang this musical\n\nclearly is, look at how it has tapped into a youthful energy that’s contagious,\n\nno matter what demographic.\n\nGiving this show both a relevancy and a relatability, New\n\nLine Theatre is presenting the original regional version, which premiered in Red\n\nBank, New Jersey in 2015, with music and lyrics by the Tony-nominated Joe\n\nIconis and book by Joe Tracz, which is adapted from Ned Vizzini’s 2004 novel. An\n\noff-Broadway smash hit in 2018, “Be More Chill” moved to Broadway in February\n\nwith an expanded version that is more ‘bigger is better.’\n\nNew Line keeps it focused with a tidy production, marked by\n\nco-directors Mike Dowdy-Windsor’s and Scott Miller’s high-spirited and insightful\n\ninterpretation. This is arguably a defining moment for this fearless theater\n\ntroupe, and not only because they obtained the rights before its Broadway run, but\n\nalso because it’s a major leap forward as the company ends its 28th\n\nseason.\n\nThe well-cast ensemble, playing 11 characters, sparkles.\n\nEach one has taken this show to heart with so much enthusiasm that it carries\n\nover to the audience, which included many young fans expressing their delight\n\nat every opportunity on opening night. Their joyous embrace of a show that\n\ndefines how they feel, look and act is refreshing. The powerful connection\n\nbetween actors and theatergoers is electric and palpable. The performers feel\n\nevery word and the audience responds in kind.\n\nJayde Mitchell and Grace Langford\n\nIn one of the more memorable NLT debuts, Jayde Mitchell genuinely captured the teenage angst of nerdy Jeremy, who goes from zero to hero after a square little pill “from Japan” takes root in his brain, and this supercomputer communicates with a Squip (Super Quantum Unit Intel Processor). The Squip will guide his moves to become more popular at school. Mitchell announces himself as one to watch with his opening number, “More Than Survive,” and then transforms convincingly throughout, leading this finely tuned ensemble. The mysterious Squip, played with potent authority by Dominic Dowdy-Windsor, is stunningly dressed in a dapper black crocodile coat made by costume designer Sarah Porter. He is the catalyst for action good, bad and ugly. If he looks like Laurence Fishburne in “The Matrix,” it’s intentional.\n\nJayde Mitchell and Dominic Dowdy-WindsorDowdy-Windsor, always a strong singer, manages the beats of\n\nthe darker role, as he is usually cast in heroic or romantic leads, a la “Yeast\n\nNation” and “Zorba the Greek.” He’s terrific leading “Be More Chill” and\n\nrevealing more of his intentions in “The Pitiful Children.”\n\nAs we know from every John Hughes movie in the 1980s, being\n\na “Cool Kid” has its price, and losing/not valuing true-blue friends is one of\n\nthe harshest costs. Jeremy’s bestie, Michael Mell, must be sacrificed in his all-consuming\n\nmake-over quest to fit in and be liked – and not be invisible..\n\nAs Michael, dynamo Kevin Corpuz shines in a major supporting\n\nrole, giving his all – it’s a heartfelt performance, easily tugging at the\n\nemotions in not only his delivery, but in his solo number, ‘Michael in the\n\nBathroom.”\n\nIrrepressible Evan Fornachon plays Rich, a jerky Big Man on\n\nCampus who likes to bully both Jeremy and Michael, displaying a menace that\n\nmakes his ‘a-ha’ moment all the better.\n\nJayde Mitchell and Evan FornachonJeremy’s Dad is played with marvelously droll delivery by\n\nZak Farmer, depressed over his recent divorce, who wanders around in a robe,\n\nmortifying his son, who would like to have him put on some pants. How can you\n\nnot love a composer who gives you “The Pants Song”?\n\nFarmer also doubles as Mr. Reyes, the cynical and animated\n\ndrama teacher. He is very funny, both in appearance with an interesting platinum\n\nwig and in line delivery.\n\nAnother standout is Grace Langford playing ditzy Christine,\n\nwho had been the object of Jeremy’s affection before the hotter, sluttier girls\n\nmade a beeline for him once he had cool street cred. Her off-the-charts exuberance\n\nover acting in school plays is a ‘been there, done that’ bright spot,\n\nespecially “I Love Play Rehearsal” and her candid “A Guy That I’d Kinda Be Into.”\n\nGossip girl Jenna is all attitude in the hands of Isabel\n\nGarcia, who plays snarky, sassy and snotty with a duplicitous beaming smile.\n\nLaura Renfro, as shallow Chloe, and Melissa Felps, as vapid Brooke, are\n\nmercurial marvels here, powering through their characters’ hormones, secrets and\n\nlies with glee, quickly flipping moods. Ian McCreary also displays the viper girls’\n\ndistasteful qualities as their shameless male counterpart Jake.\n\nThe meticulous attention to detail is evident in every\n\ncreative aspect, which are all in sync to create “a moment,” providing theater\n\npatrons with an entirely memorable experience.\n\nThe simplicity of the music, with its repetitive lyrics and\n\ncatchy hooks, is deceptive, for music director Nicolas Valdez and his ace band\n\n– Assistant music director Marc Vincent as conductor/keyboard, Jake Heberlie on\n\nguitar, Joseph Henricks on reeds and keyboard, Clancy Newell on percussion and\n\nJake Stergos on bass are extremely tight in pacing and master the score’s\n\nintricacies.\n\nChoreographers Michelle Sauer and Sara Rae Womack gave both\n\na playful bounce and a vitality to the group musical numbers.\n\nCombined with the ensemble’s exquisite harmonies, the peppy\n\ngroup numbers “Be More Chill,” “Upgrade” and “Voices in My Head” get stuck,\n\nwell, in your head. And yes, “The\n\nSmartphone Hour” is literal, funny and nails the cellphone phenomenon.\n\nScenic designer Rob Lippert’s set is a clever mix of effective\n\nfuturistic symbols and as always, his set is supremely functional. Everything\n\nhas a purpose for being there. Propmaster Kimi Short did a dandy job assembling\n\npieces that suit the décor and lifestyles.\n\nLippert, also the lighting designer, has excelled in\n\ncreating precarious teen moods and a fantasy futuristic element with his illuminating\n\nplan. Ryan Day’s sound work is seamless.\n\nIn her wheelhouse, Porter has populated the oh-so-fun and\n\ncringe-worthy Halloween Party with a variety of spot-on costumes, showcasing\n\nboth personality and pop culture references. Her work throughout is accurate –\n\nand cheeky. She gets the ‘90s love.\n\n“Be More Chill” is fresh and funny, and not in a jaded\n\n‘we’re so clever and smart’ way, but with real heart, and that may be the most\n\nimportant aspect – the emphasis on real.\n\nThe musical, in\n\nlyrics and book, speaks to us in a captivating way that transcends labels and\n\ngenres. It\n\ntargets our humanity. To make people feel less alone in this world is\n\na remarkable thing.\n\n(There is a wall of Post-It Notes at The Marcelle indicating what people imagine as their Squip. I didn’t take marker to paper opening night, but I’ve thought about it since, and mine would be Oprah. What’s yours?)\n\nThe New Line Theatre is presenting “Be More Chill” through June 22 but is sold out for its complete run.

Their unbridled enthusiasm for a\n\nshow celebrating “Be Yourself” is obvious, and underneath their wigs and cosmetic\n\nenhancements, it’s endearing.\n\nIn fact, one strongly feels the liberation of the drag chorus, supporting players and in the tour-de-force performance from Zachary Allen Farmer as the drag diva Zaza/Albin. That palpable sense of freedom is one of the production’s most enduring qualities.\n\nSet in the 1980s on the French Riviera, Georges (Robert\n\nDoyle) and Albin (Farmer) have lived as a married couple for years and work\n\ntogether – Georges runs the nightclub downstairs and Albin is the star\n\nperformer Zaza. They have raised the now-grown Jean-Michel (Kevin Corpuz) as\n\ntheir son since birth, in their own version of a loving nuclear family. Biologically,\n\nhe’s Georges’ son, born from a one-night dalliance with a woman who has chosen\n\nnot to be an integral factor in the boy’s life.\n\nWhen Jean-Michel becomes engaged to Anne (Zora Vredeveld), her\n\nultra-conservative parents, politician dad Dindon (Kent Coffel) and mom (Mara\n\nBollini), are invited to dinner, prompting panic, for fear of exposing their ‘alternative’\n\nlifestyle to disapproval, and ultimately, difficulties for Jean-Michel.\n\nThe ensuing melodrama and potential disasters are more akin\n\nto an episode of “I Love Lucy” – and it’s all because of trying to hide who\n\nthey really are. But then, what the hell – dignity eventually reigns. In the\n\nmeantime, wackiness ensues for plenty of side-splitting laughs, with co-directors’\n\nScott Miller and Mike Dowdy-Windsor’s deft touch.\n\nFocusing on characters who are loud, proud and know who they are is the hallmark of “La Cage Aux Folles” in all its art forms, from the hilarious 1973 French play by Jean Poiret, to the French film adaptation in 1978 to the Tony-winning Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein Broadway musical in 1983 to the American movie version in 1996 “The Birdcage” to the Tony-winning Broadway revivals in 2004 and 2010.\n\nIt’s not a new view, by any means. You would think by now,\n\npeople wouldn’t have to keep defending themselves, but homophobia still exists\n\nin the most insidious and cruel ways in the 21st century. Therefore,\n\n“La Cage Aux Folles” remains timely, and important, and most importantly, fun.\n\nAs always, “La Cage” boldly stands up to hypocrisy, ignorance and self-righteous prigs with sharp social commentary wrapped in light-hearted comedy and hummable music. This delectable confection as a crowd-pleaser is a brilliant offense, and Fierstein’s smart script is redolent with both zingers and heartfelt moments.\n\nBut this cast emphasizes it with their own perceptible\n\nfeeling of family, that intangible quality that sells the show, and underlined\n\nby the confident directors.\n\nZora Vredeveld, Kevin Corpuz, Kent Coffel and Mara Bollini. Photo by Jill Ritter Lindberg.Farmer triumphantly leads this family in one of his finest performances. The actor, with multiple St. Louis Theater Circle nominations spanning seven years, has long since proven his versatility. He has been moving before – as the loner in “The Night of the Living Dead” and the slighted genius Leo Szilard in “Atomic,” and charming — the protective dad in “The Zombies of Penzance” and befuddled Sir Evelyn Oakleigh in “Anything Goes,” and comical as the iconoclast “Butkowski” and villain in “Celebration,” but the high-wire demands of Zaza/Albin go beyond the physical and present the biggest challenge.\n\nFarmer is believable as this temperamental drama queen,\n\nboth in carriage and conviction. He looks fabulous, rocking the outfits – especially\n\nthat gorgeous lilac gown in the show-stopping “I Am What I Am,” notably after a\n\nreal-life 163-lb. weight loss. He projects effeminate airs, but not in a campy,\n\ncartoonish way – they are organic to his character.\n\nBecause he isn’t merely window-dressing, Farmer’s transparency\n\nshowing the quicksilver mood swings — the hurt, the love and the defiance — ring\n\ntrue. That makes him genuinely affecting as a transvestite man, while pushed to\n\nthe sidelines by convention, who refuses to be a cliché.\n\nRobert Doyle and Zak Farmer. Photo by Jill Ritter Lindberg.Farmer is so sensational that perhaps Georges suffers in\n\ncomparison. As written, the part is in the parlance of a ‘straight man’ in a\n\ncomedy duo, and Robert Doyle is rather bland in the role, more in the shadow of\n\nthe very flamboyant characters. A few of the early songs seem a little shaky –\n\nthe duet “With You on My Arm” and “Song on the Sand,” but it could have been a\n\nlower range issue on opening night. In the second act, “Look Over There” was\n\nmuch more assertive.\n\nThe young engaged couple – Corpuz and Vredeveld – also are\n\nsecondary to the daffy proceedings because of the big personalities unleashed\n\nhere. They have a sweet dance interlude and competently convey their roles, but\n\nreally, the focus is pulled more towards the outrageous goings-on.\n\nTielere Cheatem as Jacob. Photo by Jill Ritter Lindberg.As the mercurial butler Jacob, Tielere Cheatem is dandy cavorting\n\nin whirlwind prima donna mode. Strutting like a peacock, all attitude and\n\nmotion, Cheatem is a nimble laugh-riot making numerous scene-stealing entrances\n\nin a procession of increasingly over-the-top outfits. His comic timing is\n\nimpressive.\n\nWhen a pompous bigoted politician is set up for comeuppance, you know good humor will result, and the expressive Coffel milks it for laughs. And Bollini, as the snobbish wife and mother, is a good sport.\n\nBoth also play progressive restaurateurs M. and Madame\n\nRenaud, and their “Masculinity” scene giving Albin tips on how to be macho is a\n\nstandout.\n\nLindsey Jones and Zak Farmer. Photo by Jill Ritter Lindberg.Lindsey Jones is used effectively as Jacqueline, a chic\n\nrestaurant owner whose place is the setting for some fireworks and several\n\nterrific numbers – “La Cage aux Folles” and “The Best of Times.”\n\nAs previously mentioned, the spirited Les Cagelles are a\n\nhigh point with their ebullience and energy — Jake Blonstein, Dominic\n\nDowdy-Windsor, Evan Fornachon, Tim Kaniecki, Clayton Humburg and Ian McCreary are\n\ngleeful as real accomplished showmen.\n\nPhoto by Jill Ritter Lindberg.Fornachon, as the dominatrix Hanna, is quite comfortable\n\ncracking a whip. A running gag is his ‘physical’ relationship with nightclub stage\n\nmanager Francis (Joel Hackbarth).\n\nAs a cohesive cast, it does not matter who’s really gay or\n\nstraight, all are convincing and display a commitment to their characters by\n\nnot relying on superficial stereotypes.\n\nBehind the scenes are several unsung heroes – namely, stellar costume designer Sarah Porter, whose work is stunning. She also guided the make-up and wig applications with outstanding results.\n\nSara Rae Womack and Michelle Sauer choreographed the peppy musical numbers, moving Les Cagelles well in the provided space.\n\nNicolas Valdez’ work as music director is also exceptional –\n\nhe leads the Jerry Herman score with vitality, and the vocalists enunciate the\n\nlyrics well. Herman, who crafted such iconic shows as “Hello, Dolly!” and “Mame,”\n\nsucceeded here with a traditional score but with a definitive light touch.\n\nValdez’ band – Kelly Austermann on reeds, Ron Foster on trumpet, Tom Hanson on trombone, Clancy Newell on percussion and Jake Sergos on bass – is a finely tuned ensemble that created a smooth, effortless flow of upbeat tempos and poignant ballads. They are hidden behind a scrim, which worked out well.\n\nNext to the grand “I Am What I Am,” my favorite number was “The\n\nBest of Times,” delivered crisply as a robust, sentimental tune summing up the\n\nshow’s poignancy – and a swell sing-a-long moment.\n\nRob Lippert’s colorful scenic design had plenty of pizzazz –\n\na functional combination of glitzy showplace and living quarters. And his\n\nlighting design competently alternated between daylight and nightlife. Ryan Day’s\n\nexpert sound design is consistently good.\n\nThere is an obvious joy and compassion in this work, and because everyone involved is having such a good time, it carries over to the audience. After all, love is love is love is love.\n\nNone of us need permission to be who we are, but “La Cage Aux Folles” reminds us that we are all free to be you and me. And that’s mighty fine any time.\n\nPhoto by Jill Ritter LIndbergNew Line Theatre presents “La Cage Aux Folles” March 1 through March 23, Thursday through Saturdays at 8 p.m. at The Marcelle Theatre in the Grand Arts District.

Hence, this calling card — an original and clever “The Zombies of Penzance,” where he makes the walking dead kick in a chorus line and put moves on sheltered single ladies.\n\nThese silly components make this quirky world premiere a dip into Monty Python territory. Miller has substituted singing and dancing zombies for musical comedy pirate characters, using the same structure of Gilbert and Sullivan’s famous comic opera, which makes it funnier. It may be one-joke, but it’s laugh-out-loud fun.\n\nTurns out zombies have personalities in sync with pirates! Stranger things have happened, so just go with it, and enjoy the playful spirit. I mean, songs have titles like “Eat Their Flesh,” “Poor Walking Dead,” and “Hail, Zombies!” We can’t be serious, no matter how straight the characters play their predicaments.\n\nThe 1879 comic opera “The Pirates of Penzance,” by the British team of librettist W.S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan, was given new life in a Joseph Papp 1981 revival that won Kevin Kline the Tony as the swashbuckling Pirate King. It spawned many imitations and parodies, and a 1983 feature film. Here, you think of both those cartoonish roles and the roaming zombies that rule movie and TV screens, particularly this time of year.\n\nThe flimsy 19th century plot should be played for laughs – Frederic, 21, is released from his apprenticeship from tender-hearted pirates, but a technicality – he is a Leap Day baby — means he must serve another 63 years, but his true-love Mabel agrees to wait. We’re not talking “The Great Gatsby” level tragic romance.\n\nNow, New Line has rewired the “Slave of Duty” to be a fresh zombie! Frederic is a new flesh eater, a pawn in the other zombie maneuvers as they aim their mark on Major-General Stanley and his nubile brood.\n\nLet the wackiness ensue with Miller’s smart book and quick-witted lyrics, using Gilbert’s template. Listen carefully for laugh-out-loud humor, utilizing contemporary snarkiness.\n\nSt. Louis composer and orchestrator John Gerdes reconstructed Sullivan’s music, and it’s a mighty fine re-working. In music director Nicolas Valdez’s capable hands, he conducts a snazzy nine-piece band, including Gerdes on French horn, Lea Gerdes on reeds, Joseph Hendricks on bassoon, Emily Trista Lane on cello, Twinda Murry on violin and Kely Austermann/Hope Walker on reeds. Valdez is on keyboards. Their efforts are exquisite – love those strings!\n\nDowdy-Windsor, an oft-nominated director with Miller for St. Louis Theater Circle Awards (and winner for “Bonnie & Clyde”), also has a keen eye and sharp attention to detail.\n\nThe pair has moved the cast around – you hear the flesh-eaters before the heavily made-up zombies shamble through the audience to the Stanley home. Yet, this is not intended to be slick staging, but a motley crew invasion with a rag-tag feel.\n\nThose dastardly decaying dudes have their eyes on Stanley’s bevy of beauties. However, Major-General Stanley, who professes to be a zombie, is actually a great zombie hunter.\n\nZak Farmer is as sharp as ever as the fearless father, but what stands out is his impeccable delivery of the difficult songs, particularly the often parodied “Major-General’s Song,” which is now “Modern Era Zombie Killer,” and “When the World Went Bad.” His impressive performance indicates how deceptively hard farcical fun is.\n\nThe charade will be up soon enough, but in the meantime, romantic entanglements are on the minds of those frisky young ones, who wish they were not at a disadvantage.\n\nDominic Dowdy-WindsorWith his strong voice, Dominic Dowdy-Windsor delivers superb vocals as the Zombie King, including the solo “Oh Better Far, to Live as Dead,” and his many duets and company numbers. Given the confines of the part, he can’t swashbuckle like the role model Pirate King, and I wish he could have more swagger.\n\nSean Michael and Melissa FelpsSean Michael, as the dullard Frederic, and Melissa Felps, as a rather colorless Mabel, are saddled with a drippy romance that’s the show’s centerpiece. Voices are fine and so is their earnestness, but those roles remain insipid. Their lack of chemistry doesn’t help either. (The 1981 revival starred Rex Smith and Linda Ronstadt).\n\nSo, the supporting cast’s efforts enliven the puffy piece.\n\nThe ladies play the giggly girly magnets up to a point, then reveal they’re no helpless ingenues. That’s a nice twist.\n\nWith Lindsay Jones as Kate, Christina Rios as Edith, Kimi Short as Isabel and Mara Bollini, Melanie Kozak and Sarah Porter as other daughters, you knew they weren’t going to be powder puffs, but amp up their grrrl power. Armed already with gorgeous voices, they are demure to a point, but then turn into warrior princesses.\n\nKent Coffel goes all in as Zombie Sam, playing everything for laughs – and he’s a delight. Other goofy zombies Robert Doyle, Matt Hill, Tim Kaniecki and Kyle Kelesoma physically turn into animated creatures.\n\nScenic designer Rob Lippert paid homage to George A. Romero, director of the 1968 cult classic, “The Night of the Living Dead,” the granddaddy of zombie lore, in his ornate home interior, a cool touch. The set has the period look, but also a show within a show accents.\n\nCostume designer Sarah Porter has outfitted everyone in appropriate garb for the tonal shifts — the frilly feminine dresses and petticoats for the girls and the natty Zombie attire for the guys. Kenneth Zinkl’s lighting design emphasizes the bewitching tone while Ryan Day’s sound work makes all those fast-paced lyrics easily understood.\n\nThese zombies might not terrify, after all, but they certainly provide a fun, frothy look in a lighter vein — at both vintage opera and the horror archetypes who proliferate this time of year. Barbara, they are coming — only armed with songs, dances and feelings.\n\nOne can’t resist the pull of brainy and talented people who set out for a road not taken before.\n\n“The Zombies of Penzance” is presented by New Line Theatre Sept. 27 – Oct. 20, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. at The Marcelle Theater, 3310 Samuel Shepard Drive in Grand Arts Center.
