        "text": "by Michael Shell\n\n“That is well said, but we must cultivate our garden.” – Voltaire, Candide (1759)\n\nAs a director of opera and a musical theater enthusiast, it has been a great privilege and honor to have directed two of Leonard Bernstein’s seminal works: West Side Story and now Candide. I can remember at conservatory listening to, or rather wearing out, the recording of Leonard Bernstein conducting Candide. All the music was etched into my brain, but I knew very little of the story. The show is kaleidoscopic, filled with diverse locations, characters, and situations. It is as irreverent as any Mel Brooks movie and as dramatically potent as the most celebrated operas. The many versions of the show have left a legacy of attempts to bring focus to this episodic musical, and one of the exciting parts of directing Candide is to discover how best to tell the story.\n\nIt wasn’t until I was approached to direct Candide that I fully entered the wild and crazy journey as penned by Voltaire. After reading the original story, I realized that all the core questions and themes that Candide and his fellow travelers wrestle with on their “worldwide” journey are still present in our modern-day existence: Why are we here? What is our purpose? And why do things happen the way they do? Voltaire’s frustrations with religious zealots who proclaim to be faithful followers of Christianity yet kill people who do not believe, the corrupting power of money and greed, inequality of class, gender, and race, and a philosophy that encourages acceptance of the status quo that is supposed to justify these things and any natural disaster, mirrors our own today.\n\nBernstein’s version of Candide is a product of its time, just as Voltaire’s was a product of his. In both cases, there are questions about the political viability of the language that’s used, of ideas that are espoused, of philosophies set forth. Both Voltaire and Bernstein fight against notions with which they disagree; they also set up new questions to be examined and debated by later generations. The current generation of students is acutely aware of the inequities and complications of their own time and are heroically trying to solve them. Our performers wince at the use of words like “slave” and “whore,” yet they are part of the text and part of the history of the work. These words remain in the piece under the care and challenge of this new group of artists, who carry them forward toward a more equitable future.\n\nI am sure by now you are thinking, “I thought this was supposed to be a funny show.” It is, but not for humor’s sake. It’s through the absurdity that we’re able to laugh at ourselves and the hypocrisy that we are confronted with daily. As we set about designing this production, I decided to have the work emerge from the imagination of Voltaire as if he is writing it on the spot. By theatricalizing the story in this context, we, as the audience, can watch the characters deal with how they feel about the world and what happens to them on their journey as possibly similar to our life paths.\n\nIn Candide, we have a hero for whom learning is slow to arrive, injuring many on the way and leaving some in its wake. In the theater, learning usually comes more quickly, with fewer injuries. Candide’s lessons seem absolutely lost, again and again, yet in the end, we’re in a new position. Like a garden, things remain subterranean for quite a while and then spring to life.\n\nAs a place of earth, insects, and decay, the garden is a detailed and humbling metaphor of world-making. A garden requires time, patience, and repetitive action; it highlights the futility of force. New life and growth won’t happen overnight, and there is no one to blame when things die.\n\nWhen the characters are left alone and confronted with no direction from the author, they begin to ask, “What’s the use?” Like us, they want to know, “What is it all about?” They long to find a reason for the racism, inequalities, pain, and sufferings that occurred and rebel against the author, their creator. Hopefully, this production finds a fresh answer to that question each night.\n\nby Freja Cole\n\n(M.A. Student in Musicology and Music Library Science)\n\nThe struggle to find meaning amid the uncertainties of life is central to the human condition. When faced with environmental disaster, international conflict, or personal suffering, how do we respond to uncertainty or endure tragedy? How do we cope? Leonard Bernstein’s comic operetta Candide brings some comic relief to the overwhelming task of living in a far-from-perfect world. Bernstein and playwright Lillian Hellman chose to adapt Voltaire’s eighteenth-century novella Candide in 1954, recognizing the timelessness of the book’s themes and irreverent humor. Upon having the idea, Hellman immediately wrote to Bernstein, “It’s so obviously right that I wonder nobody has done it before.” The creative process soon got off to a rocky start—Bernstein, frustrated by the slow progress made by their lyricist John Latouche, excused him from the project well before its completion. With help from author Dorothy Parker and poet Richard Wilbur, Bernstein and Hellman wrote their own words, bringing the total count of Candide’s lyricists to five before the show’s premiere on Broadway in 1956.\n\nReceiving mixed reviews, the production closed after only two months and 73 performances at the Martin Beck Theatre. However, the brilliant overture immediately stood out as a gem, earning a firm place in the symphonic repertoire. Bernstein was not done quite yet—five major adaptations of Candide emerged over the next few decades that proved to be rather different from this early version of the operetta. In addition to many changes made to the show’s lyrics (Stephen Sondheim later made contributions as lyricist number six), Hellman’s script was withdrawn from performance due to the writer’s dissatisfaction with subsequent adaptations of her work. The 1974 revival—often called the Chelsea version for its commission by the Chelsea Theater Center in Brooklyn—therefore required a new script; Hugh Wheeler was enlisted to rewrite the book, adding yet another adaptation to the already complicated history of Candide revisions. It was the 1988 Scottish Opera version that finally pleased critics, audiences, and Bernstein, who a year later, adapted the score into the “final revised version” that he conducted at London’s Barbican Centre. Even so, earlier versions continue to be performed, as their versatility makes them suitable for a variety of contexts from the opera house to the concert hall. It is the Scottish Opera version that IU presents today.\n\nThe novella Candide, ou l’Optimisme follows naive and blindly optimistic Candide as he travels Europe and the Americas, witnessing massacres, catastrophes, and evils that contradict his teacher Pangloss’s philosophy that this is the “best of all possible worlds.” Inspired by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake that devastated the city and killed thousands, Voltaire satirizes philosopher Gottfried Leibniz’s doctrine of optimism and his corresponding argument: if God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, then he must have created the most perfect world possible. If there were the possibility of a better world, God would have brought it into being. Disillusioned by the tragedy in Lisbon, Voltaire found this idea inconceivable. How could a compassionate God’s ideal world include such pain and suffering? Voltaire’s critique of optimism is revealed most clearly by the character Pangloss, who serves as a parody of Leibniz. Despite the torments that Candide and his mentor endure and witness, Pangloss always finds a way to rationalize their circumstances to the point of absurdity. In the operetta, when asked how war could be explained, Pangloss states matter-of-factly, “War makes equal, as it were, / The noble and the commoner; / Thus war improves relations.”\n\nVoltaire’s satire also proved to be particularly relevant to U.S. audiences in the 1950s. Bernstein and Hellman were collaborating on Candide at the height of the McCarthy era, a period characterized by fear and suspicion of communist influence in America and propelled by strict political censorship and propaganda. The House Un-American Activities Committee hearings and ongoing investigations of suspected communists find stark parallels in the first act “Auto-da-fé.” Candide and Pangloss are interrogated and arrested as heretics in this number recalling the persecution of Jews by the Church during the Portuguese Inquisition; autos-da-fé, or acts of faith, were public rituals surrounding the sentencing and punishment of enemies of the Church. Early versions of the scene included overt jabs at McCarthy that were cut before the show’s Broadway premiere, weakening the biting social criticism that Hellman originally intended. This episode from Voltaire’s novella would have resonated with the creators on a personal level; Hellman, Bernstein, Latouche, and Parker were cited in Red Channels, a 1950 publication that blacklisted and damaged the careers of many important artists by exposing their “un-American” activities to the public.\n\nIn Bernstein’s version of Candide, the characters face adversity that prompts them to engage with their optimistic worldviews differently. Candide struggles to reconcile his outlook with the awful realities of war, disease, death, and persecution. His love interest, Cunegonde, is subjected to equally horrific experiences when she is attacked by Bulgar soldiers and later sold to two wealthy men in Paris. In the aria “Glitter and Be Gay,” Cunegonde expresses despair over the loss of her virtue and laments the façade of gaiety she must maintain to cope—“forced to glitter, forced to be gay.” The second section of the aria is light and bubbly; Cunegonde disguises her pain with laughter and adopts the optimistic attitude of her teacher Pangloss, exclaiming, “If I’m not pure, at least my jewels are!” As the characters find themselves in less-than-perfect circumstances, they consider what it means to live in the best of all possible worlds. Candide and Cunegonde find their own methods of surviving by choosing to settle down in a new home in the finale, “Make Our Garden Grow.” They begin to cultivate something meaningful for themselves and those around them, doing the best they can to create a better world."
