        "text": "Petershausen Abbey (Kloster, Reichskloster or Abtei Petershausen) was a Benedictine monastery situated at Petershausen, now a part of Konstanz in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.\n\nHistory\n\nIt was founded in 983 by Bishop Gebhard of Constance, and settled from Einsiedeln Abbey. Under Abbot Theodoric (1086 - 1116), the Hirsau Reforms were introduced. Because it sided with the papacy in the Investiture Controversy, the abbey was closed between 1103 and 1106.\n\nIn 1159 it burnt down, and was rebuilt and extended between 1162 and 1180. Under Emperor Frederick II it became \"reichsfrei\" (territorially independent). The abbey however declined during the 13th and 14th centuries and suffered during the Reformation.\n\nIt was secularised and dissolved in 1802; the library was bought by the University of Heidelberg.\n\nThe church was demolished. The remaining premises were used among other things as a psychiatric hospital and as a barracks. They now accommodate a number of administrative and educational functions and the Archaeological Museum of Baden-Württemberg."
