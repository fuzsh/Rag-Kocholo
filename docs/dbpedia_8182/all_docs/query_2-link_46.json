Search results include description text snippets that contain the search term and, depending on the search, either a link to the beginning of the appropriate manuscript or a direct link to the desired location in the text (Incipit or Text title, for example). Results for search by Decoration also include sample page images. The Search function currently supports the following commands and operators:\n\n* (Wildcard): a search for Gall* will find St. Gallen and Gallus. Wildcards can be used at the beginning and at the end of a search term.\n\nQuotation marks: quotation marks can be used to find entire sentences or groups of search terms in a particular order (exact phrase queries). If multiple search terms are entered without quotation marks, an either-or search is conducted. This means that Freiburger Perikopen will produce many more results than \"Freiburger Perikopen\".\n\n~ (Fuzzy search, search for similar words): using the ~ (Tilde), all words similar to the search term will also be returned. This means a search for Stricker~ will also find Strickler, Strecker and Strichen."
