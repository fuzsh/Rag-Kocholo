Both are good when both are possible. Otherwise, prayer is better than reading. If a man wants to be always in God's company, he must pray regularly and read regularly. When we pray, we talk to God; when we read, God talks to us. All spiritual growth comes from reading and reflection. By reading we learn what we did not know; by reflection we retain what we have learned. Reading the holy Scriptures confers two benefits. It trains the mind to understand them; it turns man's attention from the follies of the world and leads him to the love of God. The conscientious reader will be more concerned to carry out what he has read than merely to acquire knowledge of it. In reading we aim at knowing, but we must put into practice what we have learned in our course of study. The more you devote yourself to study of the sacred utterances, the richer will be your understanding of them, just as the more the soil is tilled, the richer the harvest. The man who is slow to grasp things but who really tries hard is rewarded, equally he who does not cultivate his God-given intellectual ability is condemned for despising his gifts and sinning by sloth. Learning unsupported by grace may get into our ears; it never reaches the heart. But when God's grace touches our innermost minds to bring understanding, his word which has been received by the ear sinks deep into the heart. - from Book of Maxims by Saint Isidore\n\nHeresy is from the Greek word meaning 'choice'.... But we are not permitted to believe whatever we choose, nor to choose whatever someone else has believed. We have the Apostles of God as authorities, who did not...choose what they would believe but faithfully transmitted the teachings of Christ. So, even if an angel from heaven should preach otherwise, he shall be called anathema. - Saint Isidore\n\nIf a man wants to be always in God's company, he must pray regularly and read spiritual books regularly. When we pray, we talk to God; when we read, God talks to us. â Saint Isidore\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-isidore-of-seville/\n\nSaint Plato\n\nAlso known as\n\nPlaton\n\nProfile\n\nPlato's wealthy parents died of disease before he was 13. Raised and educated by an uncle who was a treasurer, and Plato soon handled much of his uncle's business. Excellent student. Pious from youth, he turned away from the world of the royal court, freed his slaves, sold his estates, gave the money to his sisters and the poor, and at age 24 he moved to the monastery at Symbolean on Mount Olympus, though he never took holy orders and remained a layman. He spent his days in prayer, menial labour, and copying holy books. Abbot in 770. Given to severe fasts and self-deprivation.\n\nIn 775 Plato made a journey to Constantinople on business, and managed to inspire many of the citizens of all stations to better, more pious lives. The patriarch Paul tried to make him bishop of Nicomedia, but Plato retreated to his monastery.\n\nHis sister Theoctista's entire family embraced a religious state, founded a monastery of Saccudion, near Constantinople, and prevailed upon Plato to direct it in 782. In 794 he turned it over to his nephew, Saint Theodorus.\n\nThe emperor Constantine repudiated his empress, Mary, and married Theodota, a relative of Plato; Plato and Theodorus published a sentence of excommunication against him. Joseph, the treasurer of the church, and several other mercenary priests and monks, tried to convince Plato to approve the emperor's divorce, but he refused, scolded the emperor to his face, and was imprisoned until Constantine's death in 797.\n\nIn the face of the Saracen invasions, the monks of Saccudion abandoned their settlement for Studius where Plato vowed obedience to his nephew Theodorus, and lived as a recluse in a narrow cell, in perpetual prayer and manual labor, one foot fastened to the ground with a heavy iron chain which he hid with his cloak when anyone came to see him.\n\nIn 807, Joseph, the priest who had presided at the wedding of Constantine and Theodoat, was restored to his position and made treasurer of the church by order of emperor Nicephorus. Plato considered this scandalous, and loudly condemned it. The emperor had him guarded for a year by a troop of insolent soldiers and false monks after which Plato was unjustly condemned by a council of court bishops, then banished to be conducted from place to place in the isles of Bosphorus for four years until freed in 811 by the new emperor Michael I. Plato then returned to his cell and his life of prayer.\n\nIn 813, Plato saw that his end was near, directed his grave be dug, had himself carried to it, lived laying in it, spending his last days in prayer and receiving guests from his grave including his former enemy, the priest Joseph who came to ask for Plato's prayers.\n\nBorn\n\nc.734\n\nDied\n\n• 19 March 813 of natural causes\n\n• funeral obsequies were performed by Saint Nicephorus\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-plato/\n\nSaint Gaetano Catanoso\n\nAlso known as\n\nCajetan Catanoso\n\nAdditional Memorial\n\n20 September\n\nProfile\n\nBorn to a wealthy, pious family. Ordained on 20 September 1902, he served as a parish priest. Established a Confraternity of the Holy Face in his parish, which spread through a newsletter launched in 1920. Founded the Poor Clerics to encourage priestly vocations. Transferred to Santa Maria de la Candelaria parish in Reggio Calabria, Italy in 1921. There he revived Marian and Eucharistic devotions, improved catechesis, and worked for observance of liturgical feasts. Worked for cooperation among local priests to provide missions by preaching and hearing confessions in each others parishes. Spiritual director for several religious institutions, a prison, hospital and seminary for decades. Founded the Congregation of the Daughters of Saint Veronica (Missionaries of the Holy Face) in 1935 to teach, offer perpetual prayers, and work with the poor; they received diocesan approval in 1958.\n\nBorn\n\n14 February 1879 at Chorio di San Lorenzo, Reggio Calabria, Italy\n\nDied\n\n4 April 1953 in Reggio Calabria, Italy of natural causes\n\nCanonized\n\n23 October 2005 by Pope Benedict XVI at Rome, Italy\n\nPatronage\n\nReggio Calabria, Italy (given on 10 March 2010)\n\nReadings\n\nSaint Gaetano Catanoso was a lover and apostle of the Holy Face of Jesus. âThe Holy Faceâ, he affirmed, âis my life. He is my strengthâ. With joyful intuition he joined this devotion to Eucharistic piety. He would say: âIf we wish to adore the real Face of Jesusâ¦, we can find it in the divine Eucharist, where with the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, the Face of Our Lord is hidden under the white veil of the Hostâ. Daily Mass and frequent adoration of the Sacrament of the Altar were the soul of his priesthood: with ardent and untiring pastoral charity he dedicated himself to preaching, catechesis, the ministry of confession, and to the poor, the sick and the care of priestly vocations. To the Congregation of the Daughters of Saint Veronica, Missionaries of the Holy Face, which he founded, he transmitted the spirit of charity, humility and sacrifice which enlivened his entire life. â from the canonization homily by Pope Benedict XVI, 23 October 2005\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-gaetano-catanoso/\n\nSaint Benedict the Black\n\nAlso known as\n\n• Benedict of Palermo\n\n• Benedict of San Philadelphio\n\n• Benedict of Sanfratello\n\n• Benedict the African\n\n• Benedict the Moor\n\n• il Moro\n\nProfile\n\nHis parents, Christopher and Diana, were slaves who had been taken from Africa to Sicily. Benedict was granted his freedom at age 18, but remained as an employee of his former master. Scorned and mocked by others as poor as himself, due to his origin and skin, he retained a natural cheerfulness.\n\nHe met with, and became enamored of a group of Franciscan hermits near Palermo. Benedict sold what little he had, gave away the money to the poor, and joined this group. Novice master and reluctant superior of the friars in Palermo. When his term ended, he happily returned to working in the friary kitchen. Benedict never referred to possessions as \"mine\" but always \"ours.\" He had gifts for prayer and the guidance of souls. His humility and cheerfulness set an example that helped reform his order. On his death, King Philip III of Spain paid for a special tomb for the simple friar.\n\nBenedict was not a Moor, but the Italian \"il Moro\" for \"the Black\" has been misinterpreted as referring to a Moorish heritage.\n\nBorn\n\n1526 at Messina, Italy on the estate of Chevalier de Lanza a San Fratello\n\nDied\n\n• 1589 of natural causes\n\n• body reported incorrupt when exhumed several years later\n\nBeatified\n\n15 May 1743 by Pope Benedict XIV\n\nCanonized\n\n24 May 1807 by Pope Pius VIII\n\nPatronage\n\n• African missions\n\n• African-Americans\n\n• black people\n\n• Palermo, Sicily, Italy\n\nVideo\n\nYouTube PlayList\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-benedict-the-black/\n\nBlessed Giuseppe Benedetto Dusmet\n\nProfile\n\nBorn to the Sicilian nobility, the son of Marquis Luigi Dusmet.
