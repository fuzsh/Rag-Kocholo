        "text": "One of the aims of the reform of female monastic life undertaken at the Council of Trent was the strict isolation of the virgins devoted to God from the outside world, designed to guarantee their chasteness and their concentration on inner life. In reality, however, even in Italy, where special efforts were made to observe enclosure, convent walls were not entirely impenetrable, and music was one of the more important 'channels' of cultural exchange between a convent and the world around it. In Pomerania, part of the Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, strict enclosure was an unrealistic aspiration, given that for the monastic orders, reviving after the period of Reform, this was a time of the building, rebuilding and expansion of convents, numerous trials over property owing to the orders, the establishing of new foundations and the acquisition of founders and benefactors. All these activities were carried on by the reformer of the Polish Benedictine nuns, the energetic prioress of the Chełmno convent Magdalena Mortęska, and also the Toruń prioress Zofia Dulska, who both, as the chronicles of their convents show, undertook numerous journeys in the company of trusted nuns, and also frequently received secular and clerical guests. The two chronicles testify that the nunnery was not a socially isolated environment. Quite the opposite: their pages include much information on events of importance for the city and the country and on the deaths of members of families connected with the convent. Some of the information 'from the city' has a clearly gossipy character and it sometimes also reveals a hostility towards the local Protestants. 1\n\nDespite the social climate of individualism and freedom of choice which pervades the early twenty-first century, men and women still feel called to enter monastic life, a decision which brings with it not only vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Monastic life also involves a serious commitment to living in community and, as such community living often presents interrelational problems, the aim of this paper is to use ethnographic data to show the ways in which music acts as a crucial element in communal health and the resolution of social conflict in modern-day monastic communities. A monastic community brings together highly disparate individuals with the sole common aim of a personal theocentric existence: every individual will bring their own attitudes into community, and one of the hardest lessons to be learnt is that of giving up their own will and agenda to pursue this goal, while simultaneously establishing themselves within their own community. Music has always played a...\n\nIn the past, living together within a community was a form of isolating oneself from the world as well as a means to perfect oneself through the observance of several moral precepts. Generally speaking, what defined life within a convent, besides the reclusion from society and the solitary life that it entailed, was a very strict spiritual program that included not only prayer, but also attending to the Divine Offices. A careful reading of the expense books prepared by the treasurer nuns reveals the costs spent on musical practice, as well as other expenses with which it is compared in this article. This study, carried out by analyzing costs relating to Music in Benedictine and Clare monasteries and, in particular, in the Cistercian Monastery of St. Benedict of Castris (Evora, Portugal) in the post Trento period, shows that a significant part of the monasteries budget was devoted to expenses with guest musicians, musical instruments, choir books, special food and &quot;gifts&quot; f...\n\nOver the centuries, the rich musical culture of the convent in Benedictine Monastery in Staniątki took a variety of forms. The foundation of the musical life was always the sung Officium. As one of nuns wrote: &quot;[...] we have proven that in a Benedictine convent the maintenance of a choir, which implied the solemn singing of the breviary was the first duty of the convent. In compliance with the celebrations of the church year and in accordance with the content arrangement of the Benedictine breviary used by the nuns of Staniątki, all feasts of the Holy Virgin Mary are at times celebrated very solemnly &quot; The main aim of the article is to show different examples of how musical life of the abbey looked like during the centuries. What remains an extremely interesting issue is the matter of the possible engagement of nuns in the performance of vocal-instrumental music by an ensemble. The practising of such solutions in Polish Benedictine convents has been confirmed by research o..."
