        "text": "A leisurely cycle tour past fields and orchards to the historic old town of Ravensburg and back to the starting point - always with a view of the beautiful natural landscape.\n\nThe cycle tour starts at the Friedrichshafen tourist information office and takes you westwards towards Seemoos. Here you leave the Lake Constance cycle path in the direction of Schnetzenhausen. The route takes you past orchards, forests and individual farms with impressive views of the Alps. The small farm stores along the route provide fresh fruit directly from the producer. After Unterteuringen and Oberteuringen, the route passes through the small village of Bibruck and on to the Wammeratswatt water conservation area. You cycle through the Upper Swabian natural landscape to the old town of Ravensburg. Here, the pedestrian zone invites you to take a leisurely stroll. Browsing in the stores can be perfectly combined with a tour of the historic old town and the charming cafés and restaurants promise pure enjoyment."
