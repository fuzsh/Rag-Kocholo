Ravensburg

The GRIESHABER Logistics Park in Ravensburg, GLR for short, is the largest continuous logistics area in the Lake Constance-Upper Swabian region, with more than 100,000 m² of land.

Ravensburg, the former free city, now has more than 50,000 inhabitants. The town gained in importance and had a major trading tradition thanks to the Humpis family, well before the Fugger trading family started wielding its influence. The traditional rood festival (Rutenfest) is a well-known and regular feature in the calendar of many visitors well beyond the borders of Württemberg.

GRIESHABER Logistik GmbH started with a partial purchase of the former Ulmia plot in 2007, right next to the Weissenau Monastery – a major capacity expansion. The advantages of the location were, however, of such excellent quality that the entire plot of land was bought in 2013.
