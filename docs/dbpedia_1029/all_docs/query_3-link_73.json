Some films occur more than once under different subject headings. Under each subsection heading films are organised in the rough chronological order of the period they cover, not the year they were made. They are arranged thematically following the general plan of the Internet Ancient History Sourcebook.\n\nThe following data, when available, are given for each film [Title] [Alternative title] [Year] [Country of Production] [Genre] [Duration in minutes] [BW/Color] [Lang] [Director] [Cast] -[Comments]\n\nContents\n\nPre-Historic Humans\n\nMesopotamia\n\nEgypt\n\nBiblical Epic/Ancient Israel\n\nClassical Greece\n\nHellenistic Greece\n\nRoman Empire\n\nLate Antiquity/Decline of the Roman Empire\n\nBiblical Epic/Life of Christ\n\nBiblical Epic/Early Christian\n\nHomosexual/LGBT/Transgendered Characters\n\nLists\n\nA: Worst Ancient History Movies\n\nB: Best Ancient History Movies - for accuracy\n\nC: Best Ancient History Movies - as films\n\nD: Ancient Movie Misconceptions (also known as \"myths\")\n\nFurther Reading on Ancient History and Film\n\nFilms and TV series set in the past can help students (and teachers) of history to visualize the period they are studying. But film makers are usually much more concerned with making an entertaining film rather than a historically accurate depiction. This is especially the case with ancient history.\n\nThe movies here are claim some loose connection to historical events, but many are purely fictional -- such as Ben Hur. Note that some of the best of these movies are the films made of plays by classical authors.\n\nIn general, I recommend seeing foreign language films in the original language with subtitles rather than dubbed into English. [Try watching John Wayne dubbed into French someday - and you'll see why dubbing almost never works.]\n\nIn reviewing a film from the viewpoint of history, rather than entertainments, here are the sort of questions you should aim to answer.\n\nWhat seems to be accurate in the film? What sources are you using to assess accuracy?\n\nIn what ways does the film impact your reading of any of the documents you have read.\n\nWhat liberties does the film take with the past? Why?\n\nIs the film primarily entertainment, or is it really trying to work within a historical period? How can you determine the film maker's intention?\n\nWhat, if any, modern point is the film trying make?\n\nMy essay Thinking about Historical Film (PDF) or here (HTML) may be of interest for readers of this web page\n\nNotes\n\nBy clicking on the title of the movie, you will be taken to the Internet Movie Database record on that movie. The link marked [Wikipedia] will take you to the corresponding Wikipedia page.\n\nWhere there are links to YouTube or other video sites, it cannot be guaranteed that such links will remain stable. If they don't work, try search for the title at YouTube. They should all work as of June 2023.\n\nOther Lists like this\n\nWikipedia: List of historical films set in Near Eastern and Western civilization [Very helpful in updating this list]\n\nWikipedia: List of historical films set in Asia\n\nIMDb: List of movies concerning history and literature of the Ancient World\n\nL'AntiquitÃ© au CinÃ©ma [In French, with reference to documentaries as well as feature films]\n\nPre-Historic Humans\n\nQuest for Fire [Aka La Guerre du feu] (1981) [Wikipedia] [Full film available on YouTube]\n\nUS, fantasy adventure, 97,Color\n\nDir.

Pier Paol Pasolini; Cast includes Enrique Irazoqui as Jesus.\n\n-Pasolini, an agnostic or atheist Marxist, made what is often considered the purest Jesus movie by using only the Gospel of Matthew (he left out the \"Saint\" in the Italian title) and the services of local non-professional actors.\n\nThe Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) [Wikipedia] [Full film available on DailyMotion]\n\nUS, 268 mins, Color\n\nDir.

Franco Zeffirelli; Cast includes Robert Powell as Jesus, Anne Bancroft, Olivia Hussey, James Earl Jones, Ian McShane, Laurence Olivier, Christopher Plummer, Rod Steiger, Peter Ustinov, Michael York.\n\n-As a made-for-TV series, Zeffirelli was able to take longer with his story, and his is probably the most faithful to the Gospels' telling of the story. Although no actor has satisfactorily played Jesus, Robert Powell looked the part (at least as established in Western art), and played it without the gaucheness (Hunter) or sheer weirdness (von Sydow, Neely) of others.\n\nKarunamaydu (1978) [Wikipedia] [Full film available on YouTube]\n\nIndia, 160, Color, Telugu\n\nDir.
